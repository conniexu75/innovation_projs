https://openalex.org/W3082479853,"Summary Plasmodium species, the causative agent of malaria, rely on glucose for energy supply during blood stage. Inhibition of glucose uptake thus represents a potential strategy for the development of antimalarial drugs. Here, we present the crystal structures of PfHT1, the sole hexose transporter in the genome of Plasmodium species, at resolutions of 2.6 A in complex with D-glucose and 3.7 A with a moderately selective inhibitor, C3361. Although both structures exhibit occluded conformations, binding of C3361 induces marked rearrangements that result in an additional pocket. This inhibitor-binding-induced pocket presents an opportunity for the rational design of PfHT1-specific inhibitors. Among our designed C3361 derivatives, several exhibited improved inhibition of PfHT1 and cellular potency against P. falciparum, with excellent selectivity to human GLUT1. These findings serve as a proof of concept for the development of the next-generation antimalarial chemotherapeutics by simultaneously targeting the orthosteric and allosteric sites of PfHT1."
https://openalex.org/W3082047744,"Inflammation plays a pivotal role in atherothrombosis. Colchicine is an anti-inflammatory drug that may attenuate this process. Cardiovascular protective effects of anti-inflammatory drugs, however, seem to be limited to patients with a biochemical response. We therefore investigated whether short-term exposure to colchicine reduced inflammatory markers and whether additional laboratory changes occur in patients with chronic coronary artery disease.In 138 consecutive patients with chronic coronary artery disease and a high sensitivity C-reactive Protein (hs-CRP) ≥ 2 mg/L, inflammatory markers, lipids, haematologic parameters and renal function were measured at baseline and after 30 days exposure to colchicine 0.5mg once daily. Hs-CRP decreased from baseline 4.40 mg/L (interquartile range [IQR] 2.83-6.99 mg/L) to 2.33 mg/L (IQR 1.41-4.17, median of the differences -1.66 mg/L, 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.17 - -1.22 mg/L, p-value <0.01), corresponding to a median change from baseline of -40%. Interleukin-6 decreased from 2.51 ng/L (IQR 1.59-4.32 ng/L) to 2.22 ng/L (median of the differences -0.36 ng/L, 95%CI -0.70 - -0.01 ng/L, p-value 0.04), corresponding to a median change from baseline of -16%. No clinically relevant changes in lipid fractions were observed. Both leukocyte and thrombocyte count decreased (median change from baseline -7% and -4% respectively). Estimated glomerular filtration rate decreased with a mean change from baseline of -2%.In patients with chronic coronary artery disease and elevated hs-CRP, one-month exposure to colchicine 0.5 mg once daily was associated with a reduction of inflammatory markers. A small effect was seen on white blood cell count and platelet count, as well as a small decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate."
https://openalex.org/W3082553627,"Academic dishonesty is a common problem at universities around the world, leading to undesirable consequences for both students and the education system. To effectively address this problem, it is necessary to identify specific predispositions that promote cheating. In Polish undergraduate students (N = 390), we examined the role of psychopathy, achievement goals, and self-efficacy as predictors of academic dishonesty. We found that the disinhibition aspect of psychopathy and mastery-goal orientation predicted the frequency of students’ academic dishonesty and mastery-goal orientation mediated the relationship between the disinhibition and meanness aspects of psychopathy and dishonesty. Furthermore, general self-efficacy moderated the indirect effect of disinhibition on academic dishonesty through mastery-goal orientation. The practical implications of the study include the identification of risk factors and potential mechanisms leading to students’ dishonest behavior that can be used to plan personalized interventions to prevent or deal with academic dishonesty."
https://openalex.org/W3081612540,"The role of questing ticks in the epidemiology of tick-borne diseases in Kenya’s Maasai Mara National Reserve (MMNR), an ecosystem with intensified human-wildlife-livestock interactions, remains poorly understood. We surveyed the diversity of questing ticks, their blood-meal hosts, and tick-borne pathogens to understand potential effects on human and livestock health. By flagging and hand-picking from vegetation in 25 localities, we collected 1,465 host-seeking ticks, mostly Rhipicephalus and Amblyomma species identified by morphology and molecular analysis. We used PCR with high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis and sequencing to identify Anaplasma, Babesia, Coxiella, Ehrlichia, Rickettsia, and Theileria pathogens and blood-meal remnants in 231 tick pools. We detected blood-meals from humans, wildebeest, and African buffalo in Rh. appendiculatus, goat in Rh. evertsi, sheep in Am. gemma, and cattle in Am. variegatum. Rickettsia africae was detected in Am. gemma (MIR = 3.10) that had fed on sheep and in Am. variegatum (MIR = 250) that had fed on cattle. We found Rickettsia spp. in Am. gemma (MIR = 9.29) and Rh. evertsi (MIR = 200), Anaplasma ovis in Rh. appendiculatus (MIR = 0.89) and Rh. evertsi (MIR = 200), Anaplasma bovis in Rh. appendiculatus (MIR = 0.89), and Theileria parva in Rh. appendiculatus (MIR = 24). No Babesia, Ehrlichia, or Coxiella pathogens were detected. Unexpectedly, species-specific Coxiella sp. endosymbionts were detected in all tick genera (174/231 pools), which may affect tick physiology and vector competence. These findings show that ticks from the MMNR are infected with zoonotic R. africae and unclassified Rickettsia spp., demonstrating risk of African tick-bite fever and other spotted-fever group rickettsioses to locals and visitors. The protozoan pathogens identified may also pose risk to livestock production. The diverse vertebrate blood-meals of questing ticks in this ecosystem including humans, wildlife, and domestic animals, may amplify transmission of tick-borne zoonoses and livestock diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3082551057,"Aim To establish a gene co-expression network for identifying principal modules and hub genes that are associated with drought resistance mechanisms, analyzing their mechanisms, and exploring candidate genes. Methods and findings 42 data sets including PRJNA380841 and PRJNA369686 were used to construct the co-expression network through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). A total of 1,896,897,901 (284.30 Gb) clean reads and 35,021 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained from 42 samples. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that photosynthesis, DNA replication, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, starch and sucrose metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, and cell cycle were significantly influenced by drought stress. Furthermore, the DEGs with similar expression patterns, detected by K-means clustering, were grouped into 29 clusters. Genes involved in the modules, such as dark turquoise, yellow, and brown, were found to be appreciably linked with drought resistance. Twelve central, greatly correlated genes in stage-specific modules were subsequently confirmed and validated at the transcription levels, including TraesCS7D01G417600.1 (PP2C), TraesCS5B01G565300.1 (ERF), TraesCS4A01G068200.1 (HSP), TraesCS2D01G033200.1 (HSP90), TraesCS6B01G425300.1 (RBD), TraesCS7A01G499200.1 (P450), TraesCS4A01G118400.1 (MYB), TraesCS2B01G415500.1 (STK), TraesCS1A01G129300.1 (MYB), TraesCS2D01G326900.1 (ALDH), TraesCS3D01G227400.1 (WRKY), and TraesCS3B01G144800.1 (GT). Conclusions Analyzing the response of wheat to drought stress during different growth stages, we have detected three modules and 12 hub genes that are associated with drought resistance mechanisms, and five of those genes are newly identified for drought resistance. The references provided by these modules will promote the understanding of the drought-resistance mechanism. In addition, the candidate genes can be used as a basis of transgenic or molecular marker-assisted selection for improving the drought resistance and increasing the yields of wheat."
https://openalex.org/W3082186530,"The filamentous fungus Acremonium chrysogenum is the main industrial producer of cephalosporin C (CPC), one of the major precursors for manufacturing of cephalosporin antibiotics. The plasma membrane H+-ATPase (PMA) plays a key role in numerous fungal physiological processes. Previously we observed a decrease of PMA activity in A. chrysogenum overproducing strain RNCM 408D (HY) as compared to the level the wild-type strain A. chrysogenum ATCC 11550. Here we report the relationship between PMA activity and CPC biosynthesis in A. chrysogenum strains. The elevation of PMA activity in HY strain through overexpression of PMA1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, under the control of the constitutive gpdA promoter from Aspergillus nidulans, results in a 1.2 to 10-fold decrease in CPC production, shift in beta-lactam intermediates content, and is accompanied by the decrease in cef genes expression in the fermentation process; the characteristic colony morphology on agar media is also changed. The level of PMA activity in A. chrysogenum HY OE::PMA1 strains has been increased by 50–100%, up to the level observed in WT strain, and was interrelated with ATP consumption; the more PMA activity is elevated, the more ATP level is depleted. The reduced PMA activity in A. chrysogenum HY strain may be one of the selected events during classical strain improvement, aimed at elevating the ATP content available for CPC production."

This research surveyed a random sample of an entire campus population at a Northeast University in two surveys (spring 2017, n = 1,037 and fall 2017, n = 1,123). Analysis of variance, t-tests, and multivariable logit models were used to understand food insecurity outcomes and comparisons among groups. The overall rate of food insecurity on campus was 19.6% (spring) and 15.0% (fall). Food insecurity rates were highest among undergraduates, graduate and medical students, and staff as compared to faculty. First generation students and off-campus students were also more likely to be food insecure in both surveys, while people of color were more likely to be food insecure in the spring survey. Findings suggest university members beyond undergraduates also face high rates of food insecurity, which has important implications for efforts to reduce food insecurity on college campuses."
https://openalex.org/W3081953875,"Isokinetic dynamometry is the gold standard for testing maximal strength in elite sport and rehabilitation settings. To be clinically useful, such tests should be valid and reliable. Despite some evidence regarding the relative test vs retest reliability of knee dynamometry, there is still a paucity of research regarding the absolute reliability parameters. The purpose of this study was to assess the absolute and relative intra-device reproducibility of isokinetic knee flexion and extension using the novel SMM iMoment dynamometer. A total of 19 participants (13 males and 6 females, aged 24 (2) years, height 178 (9) cm and weight 76 (11) kg) performed two identical knee isokinetic tests with at least a week of rest between measurements. Peak torque of knee extension and flexion were determined at 60°/s. Moderate (0.892) to excellent (0.988) relative reliability using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was obtained for peak knee torque. Absolute reliability assessed with a standard error of measurement (SEM %) was low, ranging from 2.54% to 6.93%, whereas the smallest real difference (SRD %) was moderate, ranging from 7.04% to 19.22%. Furthermore, there were no significant correlations between means and differences of two measurements, and Bland-Altman plots also showed no signs of heteroscedasticity. Our measurement protocol established the moderate to excellent reliability of the novel SMM iMoment isokinetic dynamometer. Therefore, this dynamometer can be applied in sport rehabilitation settings to measure maximal knee strength."
https://openalex.org/W3082378753,"Korean peninsula weather is rapidly becoming subtropical due to global warming. In summer 2018, South Korea experienced the highest temperatures since the meteorological observations recorded in 1907. Heat stress has a negative effect on Holstein cows, the most popular breed of dairy cattle in South Korea, which is susceptible to heat. To examine physiological changes in dairy cows under heat stress conditions, we analyzed the profiles circulating microRNAs isolated from whole blood samples collected under heat stress and non-heat stress conditions using small RNA sequencing. We compared the expression profiles in lactating cows under heat stress and non-heat stress conditions to understand the regulation of biological processes in heat-stressed cows. Moreover, we measured several heat stress indicators, such as rectal temperature, milk yield, and average daily gain. All these assessments showed that pregnant cows were more susceptible to heat stress than non-pregnant cows. In addition, we found the differential expression of 11 miRNAs (bta-miR-19a, bta-miR-19b, bta-miR-30a-5p, and several from the bta-miR-2284 family) in both pregnant and non-pregnant cows under heat stress conditions. In target gene prediction and gene set enrichment analysis, these miRNAs were found to be associated with the cytoskeleton, cell junction, vasculogenesis, cell proliferation, ATP synthesis, oxidative stress, and immune responses involved in heat response. These miRNAs can be used as potential biomarkers for heat stress."
https://openalex.org/W3082285027,"Chronic prostatitis and chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) is a complicated syndrome characterized by genitourinary pain in the absence of bacterial infection. Th17 cell-driven autoimmunity has been proposed as a cause of CP/CPPS. However, the factors that promote Th17-driven autoimmunity in experimental autoimmune prostatitis (EAP) and the molecular mechanisms are still largely unknown. Here, we showed that Th17 cells were excessively activated, and blockade of IL-17A could effectively ameliorate various symptoms in EAP. Furthermore, we revealed that calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase Ⅳ (CaMK4), especially Thr196 p-CaMK4 was increased in the Th17 cells of the EAP group, which were activated by intracellular cytosolic Ca2+. Pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of CaMK4 decreased the proportion of Th17 cells, and the protein and mRNA level of IL-17A, IL-22, and RORγt. The phosphorylation of CaMK4 was dependent on the increase in intracellular cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in Th17 cells. A mechanistic study demonstrated that inhibition of CaMK4 reduced IL-17A production by decreasing the phosphorylation of Akt-mTOR, which was well accepted to positively regulate Th17 differentiation. Collectively, our results demonstrated that Ca2+-CaMK4-Akt/mTOR-IL-17A axis inhibition may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy for CP/CPPS."
https://openalex.org/W3081766937,"The aim of this study was to assess the impact of a 6-week specialized training program aimed at strengthening core muscles to improve the effectiveness of selected elements of a swimming race on a group of Polish swimmers. Sixteen male national level swimmers (21.6 ± 2.2 years) participated in the research. The competitors were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups before the data collection process: an experimental (EG, n = 8) and a control (CG, n = 8) group. Both groups of swimmers underwent the same training program in the water environment (volume and intensity), while swimmers from the EG additionally performed specific core muscle training. The task of the swimmers was an individual front crawl swim of 50 m, during which the kinematic parameters of the start jump, turn and swimming techniques were recorded using a video camera system. In both groups, a minor increase in the flight phase was observed at the start (EG = 0.06 m, 1.8%; p = 0.088; CG = 0.08 m, 2.7%; p = 0.013). The time to cover a distance of 5 m after the turn and the recorded average speed in swimming this distance for the EG statistically significantly improved by 0.1 s (-28.6%; p < 0.001) and 3.56 m∙s-1 (23.2%; p = 0.001), respectively. In the EG, a statistically significant improvement in 50 m front crawl swimming performance of 0.3 s (-1.2%, p = 0.001) was observed. The results of the research show that the implementation of isolated strengthening of the stabilizing muscles seems to be a valuable addition to the standard training of swimmers."
https://openalex.org/W3082734412,"Wood is a porous, hygroscopic material with engineering properties that depend significantly on the amount of water (moisture) in the material. Water in wood can be present in both cell walls and the porous void-structure of the material, but it is only water in cell walls that affects the engineering properties. An important characteristic of wood is therefore the capacity for water of its solid cell walls, i.e. the maximum cell wall moisture content. However, this quantity is not straight-forward to determine experimentally, and the measured value may depend on the experimental technique used. In this study, we used a triangulation approach to determine the maximum cell wall moisture content by using three experimental techniques based on different measurement principles: low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (LFNMR) relaxometry, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and the solute exclusion technique (SET). The LFNMR data were furthermore analysed by two varieties of exponential decay analysis. These techniques were used to determine the maximum cell wall moisture contents of nine different wood species, covering a wide range of densities. The results from statistical analysis showed that LFNMR yielded lower cell wall moisture contents than DSC and SET, which were fairly similar. Both of the latter methods include factors that could either under-estimate or over-estimate the measured cell wall moisture content. Because of this and the fact that the DSC and SET methods are based on different measurement principles, it is likely that they provide realistic values of the cell wall moisture content in the water-saturated state."
https://openalex.org/W3082133745,"Amine oxidases (AOs) including copper containing amine oxidases (CuAOs) and FAD-dependent polyamine oxidases (PAOs) are associated with polyamine catabolism in the peroxisome, apoplast and cytoplasm and play an essential role in growth and developmental processes and response to biotic and abiotic stresses. Here, we identified PAO genes in common wheat (Triticum aestivum), T. urartu and Aegilops tauschii and reported the genome organization, evolutionary features and expression profiles of the wheat PAO genes (TaPAO). Expression analysis using publicly available RNASeq data showed that TaPAO genes are expressed redundantly in various tissues and developmental stages. A large percentage of TaPAOs respond significantly to abiotic stresses, especially temperature (i.e. heat and cold stress). Some TaPAOs were also involved in response to other stresses such as powdery mildew, stripe rust and Fusarium infection. Overall, TaPAOs may have various functions in stress tolerances responses, and play vital roles in different tissues and developmental stages. Our results provided a reference for further functional investigation of TaPAO proteins."
https://openalex.org/W3082500444,"White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are among the most commonly observed marker of cerebrovascular disease. Age is a key risk factor for WMH development. Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is associated with increased vessel compliance, but it remains unknown if high CRF affects WMH volume. This study explored the effects of CRF on WMH volume in community-dwelling older adults. We further tested the possibility of an interaction between CRF and age on WMH volume. Participants were 76 adults between the ages of 59 and 77 (mean age = 65.36 years, SD = 3.92) who underwent a maximal graded exercise test and structural brain imaging. Results indicated that age was a predictor of WMH volume (beta = .32, p = .015). However, an age-by-CRF interaction was observed such that higher CRF was associated with lower WMH volume in older participants (beta = -.25, p = .040). Our findings suggest that higher levels of aerobic fitness may protect cerebrovascular health in older adults."
https://openalex.org/W3082761489,"The Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) is one of the most widely used instruments for assessing the ability to recognize emotion. To examine the psychometric properties of the Korean version of the RMET and to explore the possible implications of poor performance on this task, 200 adults aged 19–32 years completed the RMET and the Korean version of the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20K), the cognitive empathy domain of the Korean version of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI-C), and the Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory-Aggression (BDHI-A). In the present study, confirmatory factor analyses confirmed that the hypothesized three-factor solution based on three different emotional valences of the items (positive, negative, or neutral) had a good fit to the data. The Korean version of the RMET also showed good test-retest reliability over a 4-week time interval. Convergent validity was also supported by significant correlations with subscales of the TAS-20K, and discriminant validity was identified by nonsignificant associations with IRI-C scores. In addition, no difference was found in RMET performance according to the sex of the photographed individuals or the sex or educational attainment of the participants. Individuals with poor RMET performance were more likely to experience alexithymia and aggression. The current findings will facilitate not only future research on emotion processing but also the assessment of conditions related to the decreased ability to decode emotional stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W3081914638,"Nucleosomes consist of small fragments of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer core. Diseases such as cancer or inflammation lead to cell death, which causes fragmentation and release of nucleosomes into the blood. The Nu.Q™ technology measures circulating nucleosome levels and exploits the different compositions of cancer derived nucleosomes in blood to detect and identify cancer even at early stages. The objectives of this study are to identify the optimal sample type for the Nu.Q™ H3.1 assay and to determine if it can accurately detect nucleosomes in the blood of healthy canines as well as those with cancer.Blood samples from healthy canine volunteers as well as dogs newly diagnosed with lymphoma were used. The blood was processed at a variety of times under a variety of conditions to determine the most reliable sample type and conditions, and to develop an appropriate processing strategy to ensure reliably accurate results.Nucleosomes could be detected using a variety of sample collection and processing protocols. Nucleosome signals were highest in EDTA plasma and serum samples and most consistent in plasma. Samples should be processed within an hour of collection. Experiments showed that samples were able to withstand several freeze thaw cycles. Processing time and tcollection tube type did affect nucleosome detection levels. Finally, significantly elevated concentrations of nucleosomes were seen in a small cohort of dogs that had been newly diagnosed with lymphoma.When samples are collected and processed appropriately, the Nu.Q™ platform can reliably detect nucleosomes in the plasma of dogs. Further testing is underway to validate and optimize the Nu.Q™ platform for veterinary use."
https://openalex.org/W3082156285,"In recent years, the binary definition of sex is being challenged by repetitive reports about individuals with ambiguous sexual identity from various animal groups. This has created an urge to decode the molecular mechanism underlying sexual development. However, sexual ambiguities are extremely uncommon in nature, limiting their experimental value. Here, we report the establishment of a genetically modified clone of Daphnia magna from which intersex daphniids can be readily generated. By mutating the conserved central sex determining factor Doublesex1, body-wide feminization of male daphniid could be achieved. Comparative transcriptomic analysis also revealed a genetic network correlated with Doublesex1 activity which may account for the establishment of sexual identity in D. magna. We found that Dsx1 repressed genes related to growth and promoted genes related to signaling. We infer that different intersex phenotypes are the results of fluctuation in activity of these Dsx1 downstream factors. Our results demonstrated that the D. magna genome is capable of expressing sex in a continuous array, supporting the idea that sex is actually a spectrum."
https://openalex.org/W3082597685,"Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is characterized by a complex tumor environment with a wide diversity of infiltrating stromal and immune cell types that impact the tumor response to conventional treatments. However, even in this poorly responsive tumor the extent of T cell infiltration as determined by quantitative immunohistology is a candidate prognostic factor for patient outcome. As such, even more comprehensive immunophenotyping of the tumor environment, such as immune cell type deconvolution via inference models based on gene expression profiling, holds significant promise. We hypothesized that RNA-Seq can provide a comprehensive alternative to quantitative immunohistology for immunophenotyping pancreatic cancer. We performed RNA-Seq on a prospective cohort of pancreatic tumor specimens and compared multiple approaches for gene expression-based immunophenotyping analysis compared to quantitative immunohistology. Our analyses demonstrated that while gene expression analyses provide additional information on the complexity of the tumor immune environment, they are limited in sensitivity by the low overall immune infiltrate in pancreatic cancer. As an alternative approach, we identified a set of genes that were enriched in highly T cell infiltrated pancreatic tumors, and demonstrate that these can identify patients with improved outcome in a reference population. These data demonstrate that the poor immune infiltrate in pancreatic cancer can present problems for analyses that use gene expression-based tools; however, there remains enormous potential in using these approaches to understand the relationships between diverse patterns of infiltrating cells and their impact on patient treatment outcomes."

Studies have demonstrated that the efficacy and safety of antiretrovirals have improved with the introduction of new classes of antiretrovirals, such as integrase inhibitors. This study aimed to estimate the frequency of individuals with a virologic response by week 24 of antiretroviral treatment and to describe the adverse events of the regimen containing dolutegravir. This was a cohort of people living with HIV followed up at a referral hospital. Patients were included who had initiated their first treatment between January and August 2017. Data were obtained from medical records, the Drug Logistics Management System and from the Laboratory Tests Control System. Two hundred and twenty-two patients were included for the tolerability analysis and one hundred and thirty-seven for the virologic response analysis. The mean age was 34 years, the median time between diagnosis and initiating treatment was 1.9 months and the median time on antiretroviral therapy was 13.2 months. The frequency of adverse events was 10% (95% CI: 7% to 15.2%), of these, amongst the most frequent events, 91% presented gastrointestinal effects, and 47.8% neuropsychiatric. By week 24 the estimated incidence of virologic response was 89.1% (95% CI: 83% to 93.5%), with an increase during the first 6 months in the number of T-CD4 lymphocytes of 50.7 cells/mm 3 (95% CI: 42 to 59.3).

https://openalex.org/W3082711328,"After perceiving cognitive conflicts or errors, children as well as adults adjust their performance in terms of reaction time slowing on subsequent actions, resulting in the so called post-conflict slowing and post-error slowing, respectively. The development of these phenomena has been studied separately and with different methods yielding inconsistent findings. We aimed to assess the temporal dynamics of these two slowing phenomena within a single behavioral task. To do so, 9-13-year-old children and young adults performed a Simon task in which every fifth trial was incongruent and thus induced cognitive conflict and, frequently, also errors. We compared the reaction times on four trials following a conflict or an error. Both age groups slowed down after conflicts and did so even more strongly after errors. Disproportionally high reaction times on the first post-error trial were followed by a steady flattening of the slowing. Generally, children slowed down more than adults. In addition to highlighting the phenomenal and developmental robustness of post-conflict and post-error slowing these findings strongly suggest increasingly efficient performance adjustment through fine-tuning of cognitive control in the course of development."
https://openalex.org/W3082756928,"Background Illness-related costs experienced by tuberculosis patients produce a severe economic impact on households, especially poor families. Few studies have investigated the full costs, including direct and indirect costs, at the patient and household levels in south-east China. Methods A case follow-up study was conducted in the Bao'an district of Shenzhen City, China. Eligible new and previously treated individuals with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) during January 1st 2013 to June 30th 2013 were enrolled. Medical and non-medical costs as well as income loss were calculated in diagnosis and treatment periods, respectively. Factors associated with costs due to TB diagnosis, treatment and TB care (diagnosis + treatment) were explored respectively with a linear regression model. Results Of the total 514 TB patients enrolled, 95% were from the migrant population, and 65% were males, with a mean age of 32.25 (±10.11). The median costs due to TB diagnosis and TB treatment were 79 United States dollar (USD), 748USD (6.2897 China Yuan (CNY) = 1USD, 2013) per patient, respectively. The median costs due to TB care (diagnosis and treatment) per patient was 1218USD, corresponding to 26% of patients’ annual income pre-illness. Those who visited more times to health facilities, hospitalized, received higher education, or occupied in national civil servant/services/retired staff might expense more before diagnosis. Costs due to TB treatment was significantly higher among migrant patients, sputum smear positive patients, and widowed/divorced population. Factors associated with less total costs were native patients, fewer times of visiting to health-care facilities and those with no hospitalization history due to TB. Conclusions Although a free TB control policy is in force, patients with TB are still facing a heavy economic burden. More available interventions to reduce the financial burden on tuberculosis patients are urgently needed."
https://openalex.org/W3081527192,"Introduction The Defining Issues Test (DIT) aimed to measure one’s moral judgment development in terms of moral reasoning. The Neo-Kohlbergian approach, which is an elaboration of Kohlbergian theory, focuses on the continuous development of postconventional moral reasoning, which constitutes the theoretical basis of the DIT. However, very few studies have directly tested the internal structure of the DIT, which would indicate its construct validity. Objectives Using the DIT-2, a later revision of the DIT, we examined whether a bi-factor model or 3-factor CFA model showed a better model fit. The Neo-Kohlbergian theory of moral judgment development, which constitutes the theoretical basis for the DIT-2, proposes that moral judgment development occurs continuously and that it can be better explained with a soft-stage model. Given these assertions, we assumed that the bi-factor model, which considers the Schema-General Moral Judgment (SGMJ), might be more consistent with Neo-Kohlbergian theory. Methods We analyzed a large dataset collected from undergraduate students. We performed confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) via weighted least squares. A 3-factor CFA based on the DIT-2 manual and a bi-factor model were compared for model fit. The three factors in the 3-factor CFA were labeled as moral development schemas in Neo-Kohlbergian theory (i.e., personal interests, maintaining norms, and postconventional schemas). The bi-factor model included the SGMJ in addition to the three factors. Results In general, the bi-factor model showed a better model fit compared with the 3-factor CFA model although both models reported acceptable model fit indices. Conclusion We found that the DIT-2 scale is a valid measure of the internal structure of moral reasoning development using both CFA and bi-factor models. In addition, we conclude that the soft-stage model, posited by the Neo-Kohlbergian approach to moral judgment development, can be better supported with the bi-factor model that was tested in the present study."

Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression model were used to see the determinants of enrollment in community based health insurance. Adjusted odds ratio with 95% CI at p-value <0.05 in multivariable logistics regression analysis factors were identified as statistically significantly associated. Result Female headed households (AOR = 2.79, 95% CI = 1.16, 6.69), Increase in Age (AOR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.05, 1.13) and negative perception towards community based health insurance (AOR = 0.062, 95% CI = .030, .128) were found to be significant predictors. Conclusion This study provides evidence that the decision to enroll in the scheme is shaped by age and a combination of household head sex and perception towards community based health insurance. Implementers aimed at enhancing enrolment ought to act on the bases of this findings."
https://openalex.org/W3082081819,"Virtual patients are an active learning pedagogical tool which simulate clinical scenarios in a three-dimensional environment. Their use in pharmacy education is under-researched in comparison to other healthcare professions. In the United Kingdom, pre-registration training refers to a year of workplace based training which pharmacy graduates must complete prior to professional registration as pharmacists. This study aimed to evaluate pre-registration pharmacists’ perceptions on the integration, usefulness and enjoyment of completing virtual patient simulations or non-interactive case studies as part of their training. Pre-registration trainees completed three virtual patient simulations or three non-interactive case studies on the topics of: emergency hormonal contraception, renal function and childhood illnesses. Telephone interviews were conducted with twenty pre-registration pharmacists, exploring their perspectives on the use of the virtual patient or non-interactive case studies. Data was analysed using the five-stage framework approach. Four main themes emerged from the data: case study design; usefulness of the case studies as a training tool; support in pre-registration training; utility of the learning tools. Trainees also identified technical issues they had experienced while completing the virtual patient simulations, specifically with keyword recognition. Pre-registration trainees who used the virtual patients provided comments relating to the novelty, realism and enjoyment in completing them. Trainees in both groups reported developing knowledge and skills from completing the case studies; those who used the virtual patient commented on the development of communication skills and an increase in confidence for practice and those who used the non-interactive cases focused on knowledge acquisition and numeracy. Participants were enthusiastic about virtual patients as a novel training tool which provided an opportunity for learners to practice realistic scenarios in a safe environment. Virtual patients offer the potential to ‘bridge the gap’ in pharmacist pre-registration sector-related training variation, promote learning through reflection on doing and increase overall preparedness for practice."
https://openalex.org/W3082517243,"High-throughput SNP genotyping has become a precondition to move to higher precision and wider genome coverage genetic analysis of natural and breeding populations of non-model species. We developed a 44,318 annotated SNP catalog for Araucaria angustifolia, a grandiose subtropical conifer tree, one of the only two native Brazilian gymnosperms, critically endangered due to its valuable wood and seeds. Following transcriptome assembly and annotation, SNPs were discovered from RNA-seq and pooled RAD-seq data. From the SNP catalog, an Axiom® SNP array with 3,038 validated SNPs was developed and used to provide a comprehensive look at the genetic diversity and structure of 15 populations across the natural range of the species. RNA-seq was a far superior source of SNPs when compared to RAD-seq in terms of conversion rate to polymorphic markers on the array, likely due to the more efficient complexity reduction of the huge conifer genome. By matching microsatellite and SNP data on the same set of A. angustifolia individuals, we show that SNPs reflect more precisely the actual genome-wide patterns of genetic diversity and structure, challenging previous microsatellite-based assessments. Moreover, SNPs corroborated the known major north-south genetic cline, but allowed a more accurate attribution to regional versus among-population differentiation, indicating the potential to select ancestry-informative markers. The availability of a public, user-friendly 3K SNP array for A. angustifolia and a catalog of 44,318 SNPs predicted to provide ~29,000 informative SNPs across ~20,000 loci across the genome, will allow tackling still unsettled questions on its evolutionary history, toward a more comprehensive picture of the origin, past dynamics and future trend of the species' genetic resources. Additionally, but not less importantly, the SNP array described, unlocks the potential to adopt genomic prediction methods to accelerate the still very timid efforts of systematic tree breeding of A. angustifolia."
https://openalex.org/W3082536827,"Immunogenicity is an important concern for therapeutic antibodies during drug development. By analyzing co-crystal structures of idiotypic antibodies and their antibodies, we found that anti-idiotypic antibodies usually bind the Complementarity Determining Regions (CDR) of idiotypic antibodies. Sequence and structural features were identified for distinguishing immunogenic antibodies from non-immunogenic antibodies. For example, non-immunogenic antibodies have a significantly larger cavity volume at the CDR region and a more hydrophobic CDR-H3 loop than immunogenic antibodies. Antibodies containing no Gly at the turn of CDR-H2 loop are often immunogenic. We integrated these features together with a machine learning platform to Predict Immunogenicity for humanized and full human THerapeutic Antibodies (PITHA). This method achieved an accuracy of 83% in leave-one-out experiment for 29 therapeutic antibodies with available crystal structures. The accuracy decreased to 65% for 23 test antibodies with modeled structures, because their crystal structures were not available, and the prediction was made with modeled structures. The server of this method is accessible at http://mabmedicine.com/PITHA."
https://openalex.org/W3081646730,"Young children exhibit poorer visual performance than adults due to immaturity of the fovea and of the fundamental processing of visual functions such as masking and crowding. Recent studies suggest that masking and crowding are closely related to the size of the fundamental processing unit—the perceptive field (PF). However, while it is known that the retina and basic visual functions develop throughout childhood, it is not clear whether and how changes in the size of the PF affect masking and crowding. Furthermore, no retinal and perceptual development data have been collected from the same cohort and time. Here we explored the developmental process of the PF and the basic visual functions. Psychophysical and imaging methods were used to test visual functions and foveal changes in participants ranging from 3–17 years old. Lateral masking, crowding and contrast sensitivity were tested using computerized tasks. Foveal measurements were obtained from spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT). The children patterns below 6 years exhibited high crowding, while the expected facilitation was found only at a larger target-flanker distance than required for children above 6 years, who exhibited the typical adult. Foveal thickness and macular volume for the children below 6 years were significantly lower than for the older group. Significant correlation was found for contrast sensitivity, foveal thickness and macular volume with age and between contrast sensitivity and foveal thickness. Our data suggest that the developmental processes at the retina and visual cortex occur in the same age range. Thus, in parallel to maturation of the PF, which enables reduction in crowding, foveal development contributes to increasing contrast sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W3081814622,"Although whole-genome sequencing has provided novel insights into Neisseria meningitidis, many open reading frames have only been annotated as hypothetical proteins with unknown biological functions. Our previous genetic analyses revealed that the hypothetical protein, NMB1345, plays a crucial role in meningococcal infection in human brain microvascular endothelial cells; however, NMB1345 has no homology to any identified protein in databases and its physiological function could not be elucidated using pre-existing methods. Among the many biological technologies to examine transient protein-protein interaction in vivo, one of the developed methods is genetic code expansion with non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) utilizing a pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNAPyl pair from Methanosarcina species: However, this method has never been applied to assign function-unknown proteins in pathogenic bacteria. In the present study, we developed a new method to genetically incorporate ncAAs-encoded photocrosslinking probes into N. meningitidis by utilizing a pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNAPyl pair and elucidated the biological function(s) of the NMB1345 protein. The results revealed that the NMB1345 protein directly interacts with PilE, a major component of meningococcal pili, and further physicochemical and genetic analyses showed that the interaction between the NMB1345 protein and PilE was important for both functional pilus formation and meningococcal infectious ability in N. meningitidis. The present study using this new methodology for N. meningitidis provides novel insights into meningococcal pathogenesis by assigning the function of a hypothetical protein."
https://openalex.org/W3081996928,"Molecular separation of pharmaceutical contaminants from water has been recently of great interest to alleviate their detrimental impacts on environment and human well-being. As the novelty, this investigation aims to develop a mechanistic modeling approach and consequently its related CFD-based simulations to evaluate the molecular separation efficiency of ibuprofen (IP) and its metabolite 4-isobutylacetophenone (4-IBAP) from water inside a porous membrane contactor (PMC). For this purpose, octanol has been applied as an organic phase to extract IP and 4-IBAP from the aqueous solution due to high solubility of solutes in octanol. Finite element (FE) technique is used as a promising tool to simultaneously solve continuity and Navier-Stokes equations and their associated boundary conditions in tube, shell and porous membrane compartments of the PMC. The results demonstrated that the application of PMC and liquid-liquid extraction process can be significantly effective due to separating 51 and 54% of inlet IP and 4-IBAP molecules from aqueous solution, respectively. Moreover, the impact of various operational / functional parameters such as packing density, the number of fibrous membrane, the module length, the membrane porosity / tortuosity, and ultimately the aqueous solution flow rate on the molecular separation efficiency of IP and 4-IBAP is studied in more details."
https://openalex.org/W3082020645,"Background The prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in the non-obese population has increased and NAFLD is not always recognized in individuals with metabolic syndrome (MS). The risk of cirrhosis is higher in patients having NAFLD with elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels than in those having NAFLD with normal ALT levels. Objective To measure the differences in clinical factors associated with NAFLD having elevation of ALT among subjects with Non-MS, Pre-MS, and MS, and to measure differences in metabolites between MS subjects with and without NAFLD having elevation of ALT. Methods Among 7,054 persons undergoing health check-ups, we included 3,025 subjects who met the selection criteria. We measured differences in clinical factors for NAFLD having elevation of ALT among subjects with Non-MS, Pre-MS, and MS, and compared metabolites between subjects with and without NAFLD having elevation of ALT in 32 subjects with MS. Results The prevalence of NAFLD and NAFLD having elevation of ALT was significantly progressively greater in subjects with Non-MS, Pre-MS, and MS (p <0.001, respectively). In the Non-MS group, there were significant differences between subjects with and without NAFLD having elevation of ALT with respect to body mass index (BMI), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, hemoglobin A1c, uric acid, aspartate aminotransferase (AST); In the Pre-MS group, there were significant differences in BMI, hypertension, AST, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT); In the MS group, there were significant differences in HDL-C, impaired glucose tolerance, AST, and GGT. There were significant differences in levels of metabolites of nicotinamide, inosine, and acetyl-L-carnitine between MS subjects with and without NAFLD having elevation of ALT (all p <0.05). Conclusions Although NAFLD having elevation of ALT is important for development of NAFLD, differences in factors associated with NAFLD having elevation of ALT at various stages of MS should be considered. Additionally, several metabolites may play roles in the identification of risk for NAFLD in individuals with MS."
https://openalex.org/W3082172547,"The conservation status of several pelagic shark species is considered vulnerable with declining populations, yet data on shark fishing mortality remain limited for large ocean regions. Pelagic sharks are increasingly retained by mixed-species fisheries, or are discarded and not reported by selective fisheries for tunas (Thunnus spp.) or swordfish (Xiphias gladius). We estimated the fishing mortality of sharks (landings plus discard mortalities) in a South African-flagged pelagic longline fishery with diverse targeting and discard behaviour. A hierarchical cluster analysis was used to stratify the fleet according to the relative proportions of tunas, swordfish, blue sharks (Prionace glauca) and shortfin mako sharks (Isurus oxyrinchus) landed by individual vessels between 2013 and 2015. A spatial analysis of logbook data indicated that subfleets operated in distinct fishing areas, with overlap. Approximately 5% of all commercial longlines set during 2015 were sampled by a fisheries-independent observer, and the species, discard ratios and physical condition at discard of 6 019 captured sharks were recorded. Blue sharks and shortfin makos dominated observed shark catches, which were comprised of nine species and two species groups. Some 47% of observed sharks were retained and 20% were discarded in good physical condition. Only 4% of shortfin makos were discarded, compared to 68% of blue sharks. Blue shark discard mortality rates were twice as high as published at-vessel mortality rates, suggesting that onboard handling, among other factors, contributed to discard mortalities. Extrapolation to total fishing effort indicated a near 10-fold increase in blue shark and shortfin mako fishing mortality compared to an earlier study (1998–2005). Escalating shortfin mako fishing mortality was attributed to increased targeting to supply higher market demand. Discarding of blue sharks by selective fishing for tunas and swordfish had a greater impact on their fishing mortality than retention by shark-directed fleets. Higher levels of observer sampling are required to increase confidence in discard ratio estimates."
https://openalex.org/W3082368934,"The standard GLM and GAM frequency-severity models assume independence between the claim frequency and severity. To overcome restrictions of linear or additive forms and to relax the independence assumption, we develop a data-driven dependent frequency-severity model, where we combine a stochastic gradient boosting algorithm and a profile likelihood approach to estimate parameters for both of the claim frequency and average claim severity distributions, and where we introduce the dependence between the claim frequency and severity by treating the claim frequency as a predictor in the regression model for the average claim severity. The model can flexibly capture the nonlinear relation between the claim frequency (severity) and predictors and complex interactions among predictors and can fully capture the nonlinear dependence between the claim frequency and severity. A simulation study shows excellent prediction performance of our model. Then, we demonstrate the application of our model with a French auto insurance claim data. The results show that our model is superior to other state-of-the-art models."
https://openalex.org/W3082616262,"Prone burials are among the most distinctive deviant burials during the Middle Ages and early modern period. Despite their worldwide distribution, the meaning of this burial practice is still a matter of debate. So far, a comprehensive analysis of prone burials is lacking for Central Europe. By compiling evidence from Germany, Switzerland and Austria, this study investigates how these findings fit into the scope of medieval funerary practices. 95 prone burials from 60 archaeological sites were analyzed regarding geographical distribution, dating, burial features, body position, age-at-death and sex. We applied descriptive statistics accompanied by multiple correspondence analysis in order to highlight possible multivariate patterns in the dataset. Prone burials occur in funerary and non-funerary contexts, with a predominance of single churchyard burials, followed by favored and exterior location and settlements. In terms of grave features, the majority of churchyard burials do not differ from regular graves. Multivariate patterns appear to reflect diachronic changes in normative burial practices. We found a significant correlation between burial location and dating, due to a higher frequency of high medieval males in favored locations. In these cases, prone position is interpreted as a sign of humility, while similar evidences from late and post-medieval times are seen as an expression of deviancy. Apparent lack of care during burial reveals disrespect and possible social exclusion, with inhumations outside consecrated ground being the ultimate punishment. In some regions, apotropaic practices suggest that corpses should be prevented from returning, as attested in contemporaneous sources and folk beliefs. We hypothesize that the increase of prone burials towards the late and post-medieval period is linked to such practices triggered by epidemic diseases. The multiplicity of meanings that prone position might have in different contexts demands for careful interpretations within the same regional and chronological frame."
https://openalex.org/W3082718513,"Since a meta-analysis showed little or no effect of second-line injectables on treatment success, and using injectables may induce ototoxicity, injectable-free rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB) treatment regimens are recommended. However, acquired resistance preventing activity was overlooked. No previous study assessed the effect of shortening the duration of kanamycin administration to 2 months during the intensive phase of the RR-TB shorter treatment regimen (STR).Retrospective cohort study of the effect of using 2 months of kanamycin instead of the standard 4(+) months (extension if lack of smear conversion at 4 months) on recurrence (either treatment failure or relapse) and fluoroquinolone acquired drug resistance, in patients treated with a gatifloxacin-based STR in Damien Foundation supported clinics in Bangladesh. Logistic regression was used to estimate associations.Five of 52 (9.6%) treated with a STR containing two months of kanamycin had recurrence, compared to 21 of 738 (2.8%) patients treated with the standard STR containing 4(+) months of kanamycin (OR 3.7; 95%CI:1.5-10.3). In those with initially fluoroquinolone-susceptible TB, acquired resistance to fluoroquinolone was detected in none of 639 patients treated with 4(+) months of kanamycin and two (4.5%) of 44 treated with two months of kanamycin (OR 75.2; 95%CI:3.6-1592.1).Two months of kanamycin was insufficient to prevent recurrence with acquired resistance to gatifloxacin, the core drug of the most effective RR-TB STR. Injectable mediated resistance prevention is important to reach high effectiveness, to safeguard all treatment options after recurrence, and to prevent the spread of resistant TB. Studies on all-oral regimens should also assess the effect of regimen composition on resistance acquisition. Until evidence shows that other drugs can assure at least the same strong resistance preventing activity of the injectables, it seems wise to continue using this group of drugs, and adapt the regimen if any ototoxicity is detected."

Objective To elucidate HIV-mediated metabolic complications that sustain even during ART in perinatally HIV-infected children. Method We have carried out metabolic profiling of the plasma of treatment-naïve and ART-suppressed perinatally HIV-infected children and uninfected controls using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy followed by statistical analysis and annotation. Result Validated multivariate analysis showed clear distinction among our study groups. Our results showed elevated levels of lactate, glucose, phosphoenolpyruvic acid, propionic acid, 2-ketobutyric acid and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites in untreated HIV-infected children compared to uninfected controls. ART normalized the levels of several metabolites, however the level of lactate, phosphoenolpyruvic acid, oxoglutaric acid, oxaloacetic acid, myoinositol and glutamine remained upregulated despite ART in HIV-infected children. Pathway analysis revealed perturbed propanoate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, glycolysis and TCA cycle in untreated and ART-suppressed HIV-infected children. Conclusion Developing therapeutic strategies targeting metabolic abnormalities may be beneficial for preventing diabetes, cardiovascular disease or other associated complications in perinatally HIV-infected children."
https://openalex.org/W3081591550,"African American breast cancer genetics is less understood compared to European American breast cancer susceptibility. Despite the many advantages of gene panel screening, studies investigating African American inherited breast cancer risk and comparing variant contributions between ethnicities are infrequent. Thus, 97 breast cancer-affected individuals of African and European descent from the Alabama Hereditary Cancer Cohort were screened using the research-based gene-panel, B.O.P. (Breast, Ovarian, and Prostate cancer). Upon sequencing and bioinformatic processing, rare coding variants in 14 cancer susceptibility genes were categorized according to the American College of Medical Genetics guidelines and compared between ethnicities. Overall, 107 different variants were identified, the majority of which were benign/likely benign. A pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant was detected in 8.6% and 6.5% of African American and European American cases, respectively, which was not statistically significant. However, African Americans were more likely to have at least one variant of uncertain significance (VUS; p-value 0.006); they also had significantly more VUSs in BRCA1/2 compared to European Americans (p-value 0.015). Additionally, 51.4% of African Americans and 32.3% of European Americans harbored multiple rare variants, and African Americans were more likely to have at least one VUS and one benign/likely benign variant (p-value 0.032), as well as multiple benign/likely benign variants (p-value 0.089). Moreover, of the 15 variants detected in multiple breast cancer cases, ATM c.2289T>C (p.F763L), a VUS, along with two likely benign variants, BRCA2 c.2926_2927delinsAT (p.S976I) and RAD51D c.251T>A (p.L84H), were determined to be associated with African American breast cancer risk when compared to ethnic-specific controls. Ultimately, B.O.P. screening provides essential insight towards the variant contributions in clinically relevant cancer susceptibility genes and differences between ethnicities, stressing the need for future research to elucidate inherited breast cancer risk."
https://openalex.org/W3082154262,"Leucine‐rich repeat and immunoglobin‐domain containing (LRRIG) proteins that are commonly involved in protein‐protein interactions play important roles in nervous system development and maintenance. LINGO‐1, one of this family members, is characterized as a negative regulator of neuronal survival, axonal regeneration, and oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation into mature myelinating oligodendrocytes. Three LINGO‐1 homologs named LINGO‐2, LINGO‐3, and LINGO‐4 have been described. However, their relative expression and functions remain unexplored. Here, we show by in situ hybridization and quantitative polymerase chain reaction that the transcripts of LINGO homologs are differentially expressed in the central nervous system. The immunostaining of brain slices confirmed this observation and showed the co‐expression of LINGO‐1 with its homologs. Using BRET (bioluminescence resonance energy transfer) analysis, we demonstrate that LINGO proteins can physically interact with each of the other ones with comparable affinities and thus form the oligomeric states. Furthermore, co‐immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that LINGO proteins form heterocomplexes in both heterologous systems and cortical neurons. Since LINGO‐1 is a promising target for the treatment of demyelinating diseases, its ability to form heteromeric complexes reveals a new level of complexity in its functioning and opens the way for new strategies to achieve diverse and nuanced LINGO‐1 regulation."
https://openalex.org/W3082179477,"Histopathological examination of temporal artery biopsy (TAB) remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis (GCA) but is associated with essential limitations that emphasize the need for an upgraded pathological process. This study pioneered the use of full-field optical coherence tomography (FF-OCT) for rapid and automated on-site pathological diagnosis of GCA. Sixteen TABs (12 negative and 4 positive for GCA) were selected according to major histopathological criteria of GCA following hematoxylin-eosin-saffron-staining for subsequent acquisition with FF-OCT to compare structural modifications of the artery cell wall and thickness of each tunica. Gabor filtering of FF-OCT images was then used to compute TAB orientation maps and validate a potential automated analysis of TAB sections. FF-OCT allowed both qualitative and quantitative visualization of the main structures of the temporal artery wall, from the internal elastic lamina to the vasa vasorum and red blood cells, unveiling a significant correlation with conventional histology. FF-OCT imaging of GCA TABs revealed destruction of the media with distinct remodeling of the whole arterial wall into a denser reticular fibrous neo-intima, which is distinctive of GCA pathogenesis and accessible through automated Gabor filtering. Rapid on-site FF-OCT TAB acquisition makes it possible to identify some characteristic pathological lesions of GCA within a few minutes, paving the way for potential machine intelligence-based or even non-invasive diagnosis of GCA."
https://openalex.org/W3082373076,"Soil microbiota are considered a source of undiscovered bioactive compounds, yet cultivation of most bacteria within a sample remains generally unsuccessful. Two main reasons behind the unculturability of bacteria are the presence of cells in a viable but not culturable state (such as dormant cells) and the failure to provide the necessary growth requirements in vitro (leading to the classification of some bacterial taxa as yet-to-be-cultured). The present work focuses on the development of a single procedure that helps distinguish between both phenomena of unculturability based on viability staining coupled with flow cytometry and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. In the selected soil sample, the success rate of cultured bacteria was doubled by selecting viable and metabolically active bacteria. It was determined that most of the uncultured fraction was not dormant or dead but likely required different growth conditions. It was also determined that the staining process introduced changes in the taxonomic composition of the outgrown bacterial biomass, which should be considered for further developments. This research shows the potential of flow cytometry and fluorescence-activated cell sorting applied to soil samples to improve the success rate of bacterial cultivation by estimating the proportion of dormant and yet-to-be-cultured bacteria and by directly excluding dormant cells from being inoculated into growth media."
https://openalex.org/W2900677793,"In low resource settings recall of the date of the mother's last menstrual period may be unreliable and due to limited availability of prenatal ultrasound, gestational age of newborns may not be assessed reliably. Preterm babies are at high risk of morbidity and mortality so an alternative strategy is to identify them soon after birth is needed for early referral and management.The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy in assessing prematurity of newborn, over and above birthweight, using a pictorial Simplified Gestational Age Score adapted for use as a Tablet App.Two trained nurse midwives, blinded to each other's assessment and the actual gestational age of the baby used the app to assess gestational age at birth in 3 hospitals based on the following 4 parameters-newborn's posture, skin texture, breast and genital development. Inter-observer variation was evaluated and the optimal scoring cut-off to detect preterm birth was determined. Sensitivity and specificity of gestational age score using the tablet was estimated using combinations of last menstrual period and ultrasound as reference standards to assess preterm birth. The predictive accuracy of the score using the area under a receiver operating characteristic curve was also determined. To account for potential reference standard bias, we also evaluated the score using latent class models.A total of 8,591 live singleton births whose gestational age by last menstrual period and ultrasound was within 1 weeks of each other were enrolled. There was strong agreement between assessors (concordance correlation coefficient 0.77 (95% CI 0.76-0.78) and Fleiss' kappa was 0.76 (95% CI 0.76-0.78). The optimal cut-off for the score to predict preterm was 13. Irrespective of the reference standard, the specificity of the score was 90% and sensitivity varied from 40-50% and the predictive accuracy between 74%-79% for the reference standards. The likelihood ratio of a positive score varied between 3.75-4.88 while the same for a negative likelihood ratio consistently varied between 0.57-0.72. Latent class models showed similar results indicating no reference standard bias.Gestational age scores had strong inter-observer agreement, robust prediction of preterm births simplicity of use by nurse midwives and can be a useful tool in resource-limited scenarios.The Tablet App for the Simplified Gestational Age Score (T-SGAS) study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02408783."
https://openalex.org/W3082723401,"Ankle proprioception is crucial for balance and relies upon accurate input from calf muscle spindles. Spindle input, in turn, depends upon the physiological and mechanical properties of surrounding muscle tissue. Altering these properties could affect ankle proprioception, with potential consequences for balance. Here we determine the effects of prior muscle cooling, stretch and contraction upon performance of a contralateral ankle joint matching task. Participants stood passively leaning against a board oriented 22° rearward from vertical. Their right ankle was rotated to a randomised position between ± 6° plantar/dorsiflexion. The task was to align the left ankle to the same position, without vision. In the first experiment, immediately prior to each testing session, participants either produced a strong calf muscle contraction in a fully plantarflexed (tiptoe) posture or underwent 15° dorsiflexion stretch. Contraction had no effect on task performance, whereas stretch produced a significant bias in ankle placement of 0.89 ± 0.6°, indicating that participants perceived their foot to be more plantarflexed compared to a control condition. In the second experiment, the right lower leg was cooled in iced water (≤ 5°C) for 10 minutes. Cooling increased joint matching error by ~0.4°, through a combination of increased bias and variability. These results confirm that conditioning the triceps surae muscles can alter perception of ankle joint position. Since body movement during quiet stance is in the order of 1°, the magnitude of these changes are relevant for balance."
https://openalex.org/W3082831808,"Objective Preterm birth is the primary driver of neonatal mortality worldwide, but it is defined by gestational age (GA) which is challenging to accurately assess in low-resource settings. In a commitment to reducing preterm birth while reinforcing and strengthening facility data sources, the East Africa Preterm Birth Initiative (PTBi-EA) chose eligibility criteria that combined GA and birth weight. This analysis evaluated the quality of the GA data as recorded in maternity registers in PTBi-EA study facilities and the strength of the PTBi-EA eligibility criteria. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of maternity register data from March–September 2016. GA data from 23 study facilities in Migori, Kenya and the Busoga Region of Uganda were evaluated for completeness (variable present), consistency (recorded versus calculated GA), and plausibility (falling within the 3rd and 97th birth weight percentiles for GA of the INTERGROWTH-21st Newborn Birth Weight Standards). Preterm birth rates were calculated using: 1) recorded GA <37 weeks, 2) recorded GA <37 weeks, excluding implausible GAs, 3) birth weight <2500g, and 4) PTBi-EA eligibility criteria of <2500g and between 2500g and 3000g if the recorded GA is <37 weeks. Results In both countries, GA was the least recorded variable in the maternity register (77.6%). Recorded and calculated GA (Kenya only) were consistent in 29.5% of births. Implausible GAs accounted for 11.7% of births. The four preterm birth rates were 1) 14.5%, 2) 10.6%, 3) 9.6%, 4) 13.4%. Conclusions Maternity register GA data presented quality concerns in PTBi-EA study sites. The PTBi-EA eligibility criteria of <2500g and between 2500g and 3000g if the recorded GA is <37 weeks accommodated these concerns by using both birth weight and GA, balancing issues of accuracy and completeness with practical applicability."
https://openalex.org/W3082934308,"Individuals reared in captivity are exposed to distinct selection pressures and evolutionary processes causing genetic and phenotypic divergence from wild populations. Consequently, restocking with farmed individuals may represent a considerable risk for the fitness of free-living populations. Supportive breeding on a massive scale has been established in many European countries to increase hunting opportunities for the most common duck species, the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). It has previously been shown that mallards from breeding facilities differ genetically from wild populations and there is some indication of morphological differences. Using a common-garden experiment, we tested for differences in growth parameters between free-living populations and individuals from breeding facilities during the first 20 days of post-hatching development, a critical phase for survival in free-living populations. In addition, we compared their immune function by assessing two haematological parameters, H/L ratio and immature erythrocyte frequency, and plasma complement activity. Our data show that farmed ducklings exhibit larger morphological parameters, a higher growth rates, and higher complement activity. In haematological parameters, we observed high dynamic changes in duckling ontogeny in relation to their morphological parameters. In conclusion, our data demonstrate pronounced phenotype divergence between farmed and wild mallard populations that can be genetically determined. We argue that this divergence can directly or indirectly affect fitness of farmed individuals introduced to the breeding population as well as fitness of farmed x wild hybrids."

We implemented an Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation statistical method for estimation and prediction of municipality OHCA rates, number of events and related uncertainties, using age and sex municipality compositions. Comparisons between predicted and real OHCA maps validated our model, whilst comparisons between estimated OHCA rates in different yeas and municipalities identified significantly different OHCA rates over space and time. Longer-time predicted OHCA maps provided Bayesian predictions of OHCA coverages in varying stressful conditions.2344 OHCAs were analyzed. OHCA incidence either progressively reduced or continuously increased over time in 6.8% of municipalities despite an overall stable spatio-temporal distribution of OHCAs. The predicted number of OHCAs accounts for 89% (2017) and 90% (2018) of the yearly variability of observed OHCAs with prediction error ≤1OHCA for each year in most municipalities. An increase in OHCAs number with a decline in the Automatic External Defibrillator availability per OHCA at region was estimated.Our method enables prediction of OHCA risk at municipality level with high accuracy, providing a novel approach to estimate resource allocation and anticipate gaps in demand in upcoming years."
https://openalex.org/W3082589640,"Space-filling curves have been used for decades to study the folding principles of globular proteins, compact polymers, and chromatin. Formally, space-filling curves trace a single circuit through a set of points (x,y,z); informally, they correspond to a polymer melt. Although not quite a melt, the folding principles of Human chromatin are likened to the Hilbert curve: a type of space-filling curve. Hilbert-like curves in general make biologically compelling models of chromatin; in particular, they lack knots which facilitates chromatin folding, unfolding, and easy access to genes. Knot complexity has been intensely studied with the aid of Alexander polynomials; however, the approach does not generalize well to cases of more than one chromosome. Crossing complexity is an understudied alternative better suited for quantifying entanglement between chromosomes. Do Hilbert-like configurations limit crossing complexity between chromosomes? How does crossing complexity for Hilbert-like configurations compare to equilibrium configurations? To address these questions, we extend the Mansfield algorithm to enable sampling of Hilbert-like space filling curves on a simple cubic lattice. We use the extended algorithm to generate equilibrium, intermediate, and Hilbert-like configurational ensembles and compute crossing complexity between curves (chromosomes) in each configurational snapshot. Our main results are twofold: (a) Hilbert-like configurations limit entanglement between chromosomes and (b) Hilbert-like configurations do not limit entanglement in a model of S-phase DNA. Our second result is particularly surprising yet easily rationalized with a geometric argument. We explore ergodicity of the extended algorithm and discuss our results in the context of more sophisticated models of chromatin."

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of an additional outreach of providing an opportunity to obtain a kit for fecal immunochemical test (FIT) during the general health check-up to increase CRC screening rate. Methods This was a longitudinal study using pre-existing data in Kujukuri Town, Japan. The town provided CRC screening in the fiscal year (FY) 2017 using an existing procedure for all beneficiaries of the National Health Insurance, whereas in FY 2018, an additional outreach effort was made to only those with an even number of age (exposed group), who were offered an opportunity to obtain a kit for FIT at the time of general health check-ups but not to those with an odd number of age (control group). To estimate the effectiveness, generalized estimating equation (GEE) with individuals as clusters was performed. Results In total, 3,530 individuals were included (1,708 in the control group and 1,822 in the exposed group). GEE showed significant interaction between the groups (control and exposed) and FYs (2017 and 2018) (p<0.001), indicating that the change in CRC screening rate from 2017 to 2018 was significantly different between the two groups. Although an achieved actual rate of 17.1% in the exposed group in FY 2018 was low, the additional outreach increased the rate by 5.8 percentage point (95% confidence interval, 3.5–8.1) compared with an existing rate. Conclusions Additional outreach of providing an opportunity to obtain a kit for FIT at the time of the general health check-up improved the CRC screening rate. However, screening rate achieved by this strategy remained low, indicating further efforts is required."
https://openalex.org/W3081933993,"Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile genetic elements in eukaryotic genomes. Recent research highlights the important role of TEs in the embryogenesis, neurodevelopment, and immune functions. However, there is a lack of a one-stop and easy to use computational pipeline for expression analysis of both genes and locus-specific TEs from RNA-Seq data. Here, we present GeneTEFlow, a fully automated, reproducible and platform-independent workflow, for the comprehensive analysis of gene and locus-specific TEs expression from RNA-Seq data employing Nextflow and Docker technologies. This application will help researchers more easily perform integrated analysis of both gene and TEs expression, leading to a better understanding of roles of gene and TEs regulation in human diseases. GeneTEFlow is freely available at https://github.com/zhongw2/GeneTEFlow."
https://openalex.org/W3082513330,"Objective To identify risk factors for bleeding in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients treated with anti-coagulants such as warfarin, apixaban, edoxaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban using a large claims database. Methods A claims database for 8926 AF patients from 2004 to 2016 was obtained from JMDC. Inc. We performed a retrospective cohort study in 2796 Japanese AF patients with 4-month screening and 12-month observation periods. Polypharmacy was defined as prescription of over six drugs. Logistic regression analysis was conducted after stratification based on the presence and absence of cerebrovascular diseases to detect the predictive factors for bleeding. Results Polypharmacy was observed in 815 of 2796 (29.1%) patients. A total of 371 AF patients (13.3%) experienced bleeding in the 12-month observation period. Bleeding risk assessment using multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the odds ratio for the number of co-administered drugs in the elderly (age for ≥60, ≤74) was not significant in those without and with cerebrovascular diseases (1.05 [0.99–1.12], N.S. and 1.10 [0.96–1.27], N.S.). In contrast, in the young (age for <60), the number of co-administered drugs was a significant predictive factor in those without and with cerebrovascular diseases (1.09 [1.03–1.16], p = 0.0054 and 1.20 [1.05–1.36], p = 0.0059). Other observed predictors were”history of bleeding” in young and elderly, but “polypharmacy” and “start from warfarin” were observed in only young. Conclusion We determined the bleeding risk in the clinical setting using a large claims database. Physicians and pharmacists need to monitor patients for the initial bleeding signs, particularly in those with these predictive risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W3082120440,"Persons living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are at a greater risk of developing tuberculosis (TB) compared to people without HIV and of developing complications due to the complexity of TB/HIV coinfection management.During 2013-2017, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funded 5 TB Regional Training and Medical Consultation Centers (RTMCCs) (now known as TB Centers of Excellence or COEs) to provide medical consultation to providers for TB disease and latent TB infection (LTBI), with data entered into a Medical Consultation Database (MCD). Descriptive analyses of TB/HIV-related consultations were conducted using SAS® software, version [9.4] to determine the distribution of year of consultation, medical setting and provider type, frequency of consultations regarding a pediatric (<18 years) patient, and to categorize key concepts and themes arising within consultation queries and medical consultant responses.Of 14,586 consultations captured by the MCD in 2013-2017, 544 (4%) were categorized as TB/HIV-related, with 100 (18%) received in 2013, 129 (24%) in 2014, 104 (19%) in 2015, 117 (22%) in 2016, and 94 (17%) in 2017. Most TB/HIV consultations came from nurses (54%) or physicians (43%) and from local (65%) or state health departments (10%). Only 17 (3%) of HIV-related consultations involved pediatric cases. Off the 544 TB/HIV consultations, 347 (64%) concerned the appropriate treatment regimen for TB/HIV or LTBI/HIV for a patient on or not on antiretroviral therapy (ART).The data support a clear and ongoing gap in areas of specialized HIV knowledge by TB experts that could be supplemented with proactive educational outreach. The specific categories of TB/HIV inquiries captured by this analysis are strategically informing future targeted training and educational activities planned by the CDC TB Centers of Excellence, as well as guiding HIV educational efforts at regional and national TB meetings."
