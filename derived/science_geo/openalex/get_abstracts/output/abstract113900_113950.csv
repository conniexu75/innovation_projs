https://openalex.org/W1721827275,"Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a DNA binding activity detected in nuclear extracts from Hep3B cells cultured in 1% O2 but not in extracts from cells cultured in 20% O2. HIF-1 binds to a sequence within the human erythropoietin gene enhancer that is required for hypoxic activation of transcription. Induction of HIF-1 is inhibited by cycloheximide, which also inhibits induction of erythropoietin RNA. We now demonstrate that induction of both HIF-1 and erythropoietin RNA is inhibited by the protein kinase inhibitor 2-aminopurine. HIF-1 binding to DNA was eliminated by phosphatase treatment of nuclear extracts. Actinomycin D also inhibited HIF-1 induction, suggesting that de novo transcription is required. The kinetics of HIF-1 induction by hypoxia paralleled the kinetics of erythropoietin gene transcriptional induction. HIF-1 DNA binding activity decayed rapidly when hypoxic cells were exposed to increased oxygen tension. In vitro, the kinetics of HIF-1 association with, and dissociation from, its binding site were extremely rapid, with a t1/2 for both processes of"

Fucoidan also potently inhibits selectin-mediated adhesion of leukocytes to vascular endothelium. To understand the molecular basis for fucoidan's inhibition of specific cell adhesion events, we have investigated the structure of this fucan using definitive methods of carbohydrate structural analysis. We report the revised average structure for fucoidan. [formula: see text] This average structure differs from the previous model for fucoidan in two respects. First, the core region of the fucan is composed primarily of a polymer of alpha 1-3-linked fucose with sulfate groups substituted at the 4 position on some of the fucose residues. Secondly, fucose is also attached to this polymer to form branch points, one for every 2-3 fucose residues within the chain. This revised average structure is consistent with previous studies suggesting a branched random coil as the best model for this polysaccharide. The proposed model is also a closer structural analogue of the sulfated carbohydrate ligands that bind to selectins. This information should be useful for determining whether a relationship exists between selectin-mediated adhesion of leukocytes and human sperm-egg binding."
https://openalex.org/W1555549645,"Recently, we have demonstrated that the tyrosine kinase pp60v-src can undergo cell-free assembly into a heterocomplex with rabbit hsp90 and p50 when the immunoadsorbed protein is incubated with rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Hutchison, K. A., Brott, B. K., De Leon, J. H., Perdew, G. H., Jove, R., and Pratt, W. B. (1992) J. Biol. Chem 267, 2902-2908). Using a baculovirus system to express a high level of human c-Raf serine/threonine kinase in Sf9 insect cells, we show here that immunoadsorbed c-Raf undergoes similar lysate-mediated assembly into a heterocomplex with hsp90 and p50. As with pp60v-src and steroid receptors, binding of c-Raf to hsp90 occurs in an ATP-dependent and K(+)-dependent manner and the resulting heterocomplex is stabilized by molybdate. With a very rapid and gentle procedure of Sf9 cell cytosol preparation and c-Raf immunoadsorption, we show coimmunoadsorption of the insect homologue of hsp90. The same procedures permit detection of a native complex of v-Raf with rat hsp90 and p50 in stably transfected rat 3Y1 fibroblasts, and v-Raf is also assembled into a heterocomplex with rabbit hsp90 and p50 by reticulocyte lysate. Using the 22W mutant of c-Raf in which the NH2-terminal half has been deleted, we show that the catalytic domain of the kinase is sufficient for both formation of the native heterocomplex in mouse NIH 3T3 cells and cell-free reconstitution of the heterocomplex by rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Although the native Raf-heat shock protein heterocomplex is less stable than native pp60v-src and glucocorticoid receptor heterocomplexes, by analogy with these proteins its detection may have important implications regarding the mechanism of Raf trafficking through the cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W1482589774,"Three new intermediates of the catalytic cycle of the soluble form of methane monooxygenase (MMO) isolated from Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b have been detected using transient kinetic techniques. MMO consists of hydroxylase (MMOH), reductase, and B (MMOB) components. MMOH contains an oxygen-bridged [Fe(III).Fe(III)] cluster that catalyzes O2 activation and insertion chemistry. At 4 degrees C, rapid mixing of O2 with diferrous MMOH ([Fe(II).Fe(II)]) in the presence of a 2-fold excess of MMOB resulted in loss of the g = 16 EPR signal characteristic of the diferrous cluster at an apparent first order rate of 22 +/- 5 s-1 (O2 approximately 700 microM). Subsequently, an EPR silent, chromophoric (lambda max = 330 and 430 nm, epsilon approximately 7500 M-1 cm-1 at each wavelength) intermediate (compound Q) formed with an average first order rate constant of 1 +/- 0.1 s-1 and then decayed at 0.05 +/- 0.01 s-1. Since compound Q formed much more slowly than diferrous MMOH disappeared, at least one other undetected intermediate (compound P) must have formed before compound Q. MMO substrates had little or no effect on the formation rate of compound Q, but they caused the decay rate to increase linearly with the concentration added. The substrates methane, furan, and nitrobenzene caused compound Q decay to occur with second order rate constants of 19,000 M-1 s-1, 9000 M-1 s-1, and 200 M-1 s-1 (+/- 5%), respectively. When nitrobenzene was used as a substrate, a second chromophoric intermediate (compound T, lambda max = 325 nm, with a shoulder at 395 nm, epsilon 395 approximately 6000 M-1 cm-1) formed at the same rate as compound Q decay. Chemical quench studies showed that compound T is an enzyme-product complex that decays with a rate constant of 0.02 +/- 0.005 s-1. This rate is approximately the same as kcat for nitrobenzene turnover at 4 degrees C catalyzed by the reconstituted MMO system, suggesting that product release is the rate-limiting step in catalysis. The characteristics of compound Q suggest that it may be the activated form of the enzyme that directly catalyzes substrate oxidation."
https://openalex.org/W1528720934,"Phospholipase D in human neutrophil lysates is activated by GTP gamma S (guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)), implying the participation of a GTP-binding protein. Reconstitution of GTP gamma S-dependent activity requires protein factors in both the plasma membrane and the cytosol (Olson, S. C., Bowman, E. P., and Lambeth, J. D. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 17236-17242). The location of the GTP-binding protein was investigated by preincubating either cytosol or plasma membrane with GTP gamma S, followed by removal of all but tightly bound nucleotide and reconstituting activity with the complementing untreated subcellular fraction. This approach indicated that the GTP-binding protein was membrane-associated. A low magnesium requirement for GTP gamma S prebinding, as well as a failure of aluminum fluoride to activate, suggested a Ras-like small M(r) GTP-binding protein. smg GDP dissociation stimulator, which stimulates the exchange of GDP for GTP on a variety of small GTP-binding proteins, stimulated GTP-dependent phospholipase D activity. Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor, a regulatory protein that binds specifically to and inhibits the functions of Rho family small GTP-binding proteins, inhibited GTP gamma S-dependent activity. Thus, neutrophil phospholipase D is regulated by a membrane-associated small molecular weight GTP-binding protein, likely to be a member of the Rho family."
https://openalex.org/W1487072223,"Intrinsic stoichiometric equilibrium constants were determined for zinc(II) and copper(II) binding to bovine and human serum albumin. Data were obtained from equilibrium dialysis experiments. Metals were presented to apoprotein as metal chelates in order to avoid metal hydrolysis and to minimize nonspecific metal-protein interactions. Scatchard analysis of the binding data indicated that the high affinity class for both zinc and copper was comprised of one site. Results of binding experiments done at several pH values suggested that while both histidyl and carboxyl groups appear to be involved in copper binding, histidyl residues alone were sufficient for zinc binding. These amino acid residues were used in combination to model several binding sites used in the formulation of equilibria expressions from which stoichiometric constants were calculated. The log10K for bovine serum albumin were calculated to be 7.28 for Zn(II) and 11.12 for Cu(II). Those for human serum albumin were determined to be 7.53 and 11.18 for Zn(II) and Cu(II), respectively. These constants were used in equilibria to simulate speciation of metal-albumin and metal-chelator and to illustrate relative binding affinities. This comparison of binding strengths was possible only through the calculation of an intrinsic stoichiometric binding constant."
https://openalex.org/W1501606466,"Macrophage-like P388D1 cells release [3H]arachidonic acid and produce prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) upon stimulation with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and platelet-activating factor (PAF). To determine whether group II phospholipase A2 (PLA2) is involved in this release, we treated P388D1 cells with antisense inhibitors specific for group II PLA2 RNA. Treatment with oligonucleotide ASGII decreased PLA2 activity in P388D1 cell homogenates by approximately 60% and reduced the release of [3H]arachidonic acid and PGE2 from activated cells to nearly resting cell levels. The inhibition by antisense oligonucleotide ASGII was blocked when its sense complement, SGII, was included in the incubation mixture. Stably transfected P388D1 cells expressing an antisense construct for group II PLA2 also produced reduced quantities of PGE2 in response to LPS and PAF. These data suggest that prostaglandin production by activated P388D1 cells involves phospholipid hydrolysis by group II PLA2. Oligonucleotide ASGII also blocked the appearance of a heparin-releasable group II PLA2 in the culture supernatants of P388D1 cells. The disappearance of this protein correlated with reduced PGE2 production by activated cells, indicating that an extracellular heparin-associated pool of group II PLA2 is involved in prostaglandin production by P388D1 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1513543887,"Abstract The proprotein processing activity of mutants of the subtilisin-like enzyme furin was studied in transfected mammalian cells. Our studies indicate that the three residues of the catalytic triad of furin, Asp46, His87, and Ser261, are critical not only for substrate processing but also for maturation of furin. Furthermore, evidence is provided that maturation of furin occurs through an intramolecular autocatalytic process. Substitution of the asparagine residue (Asn188) of the oxyanion hole by an alanine residue appears to block substrate processing but not furin maturation. Analysis of carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants revealed that the segment encompassing residues Glu449 to Glu469 of the middle domain, which is more than 100 residues downstream of the predicted catalytic domain, contains residues that seem to be critical for processing activity but that the more carboxyl-terminal cysteine-rich region, the transmembrane region, and the cytosolic tail are dispensable. Finally, we made mutants in the substrate binding region of human furin and studied their ability to process von Willebrand factor (pro-vWF) substrates, including wild-type pro-vWF as well as pro-vWF mutants in which the P1 (vWFR-1G), P2 (vWFK-2A), or P4 (vWFR-4A) basic residue with respect to the pro region cleavage site had been mutated. It is demonstrated that particular negatively charged residues in or near the substrate binding region of furin are critical for cleavage activity and specificity of the enzyme for multiple basic residues in the substrate. Furthermore, substrate binding region mutants of furin were obtained, which cleaved either the pro-vWFK-2A or pro-vWFR-4A mutant of pro-vWF more efficiently than wild-type pro-vWF."
https://openalex.org/W1523766194,"By functional analysis of mutant human transferrin receptors (TR) expressed in chicken embryo fibroblasts, we previously identified a tetrapeptide sequence, Y20TRF23, within the 61-residue cytoplasmic tail as the signal for high-efficiency endocytosis (Collawn, J. F., Stangel, M., Kuhn, L. A., Esekogwu, V., Jing, S., Trowbridge, I.S., and Tainer, J.A. (1990) Cell 63, 1061-1072). It has been inferred from other studies, however, that the TR internalization signal was localized to a much larger region, residues 7 through 26 (Girones, N., Alvarez, E., Seth, A., Lin, I-M., Latour, D.A., and Davis, R.J. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 19006-19012). Additionally, Tyr20 was reported to not be conserved in the Chinese hamster cytoplasmic tail sequence (Alvarez, E., Girones, N., and Davis, R.J. (1990) Biochem. J. 267, 31-35). In the studies reported here, we examined the effect of insertion of an extra copy of a YTRF sequence at three different locations within the human TR cytoplasmic domain and show that the insertion of another YTRF signal at position 31-34 in the wild-type TR, but not the other two locations, increases the rate of endocytosis 2-fold. Furthermore, introduction of YTRF at position 31-34 in an internalization-defective mutant receptor restores endocytosis to wild-type levels, indicating that YTRF signals at either positions 20-23 or 31-34 are necessary and sufficient to promote TR internalization and function in an independent and additive manner. We also report the complete primary structure of the Chinese hamster TR deduced from its cDNA sequence and show that the Tyr20 as well as the complete YTRF motif is conserved."
https://openalex.org/W1609863923,"Treatment of confluent cultures of JAR human placental choriocarcinoma cells with cholera toxin or forskolin for 16 h markedly stimulated (2.4-fold) serotonin transport activity in these cells. Cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis or actinomycin D, an inhibitor of mRNA synthesis effectively blocked this stimulation. Northern blot analysis revealed that treatment with cholera toxin resulted in severalfold increase in the concentrations of the three mRNA species (6.8, 4.9 and 3.0 kilobases in size) which hybridized to the human placental serotonin transporter cDNA. Under similar conditions, the concentrations of the mRNA species which hybridized to the human placental taurine transporter cDNA or to the human beta-actin cDNA were not affected. Analysis of paroxetine-sensitive binding of the cocaine analog 2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4- [125I]iodophenyl)tropane to the membranes prepared from control and cholera toxin-treated cells indicated that the maximal binding capacity was increased 2.5-fold by cholera toxin, with no significant change in the binding affinity. Thus, stimulation of serotonin transporter activity in the placental choriocarcinoma cells following cholera toxin treatment is likely a result of an increase in cell surface density of the serotonin transporter protein as a consequence of increased steady state serotonin transporter mRNA levels."
https://openalex.org/W1489024269,"Tissue factor (TF), an integral membrane protein, enhances the feedback activation of factor VII by factor VIIa (factor VII autoactivation). We found that, in contrast to the other known membrane-dependent coagulation activation reactions, TF-dependent factor VII autoactivation occurred preferentially on neutral phospholipid vesicles relative to negatively charged vesicles containing phosphatidylserine. This reaction was best described by a novel mechanism in which the enzyme and substrate are each bound to separate cofactor (TF) molecules. This unusual mechanism of substrate presentation to a membrane-bound protease predicts that the reaction rate will be directly dependent on the surface density, and hence lateral diffusion, of factor VII.TF and factor VIIa.TF complexes, obeying obligatorily two-dimensional enzyme kinetics. This prediction was confirmed, yielding a two-dimensional second-order rate constant (k2D) of 4.9 (+/- 0.8) x 10(6) m2 mol-1 s-1. Since intact cells normally sequester acidic phospholipids away from the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, this reaction mechanism should permit factor VII autoactivation to predominate on unactivated/undamaged cell surfaces when other clotting reactions are dormant."
https://openalex.org/W1531933505,"The effect of ethanol on cell proliferation was studied in Balb/c 3T3 cells and in stably transfected 3T3 cells constitutively overexpressing the human insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) receptor (p6 cells). Ethanol inhibited growth of both cell lines when they were cultured in serum-free medium supplemented with individual growth factors, i.e. platelet-derived growth factor and IGF-1 for 3T3 cells, and IGF-1 only for p6 cells. Increases in cell number were prevented in both cell lines even when ethanol was present exclusively during the period of IGF-1 stimulation. The inhibitory effect of ethanol was concentration-dependent, with a 30% inhibition observed at 10 mM ethanol. IGF-1 receptor tyrosine autophosphorylation was completely prevented by ethanol both in intact cells and in immunopurified IGF-1 receptor preparations. The binding of IGF-1 to its receptor on intact cells was unaffected by ethanol. Ethanol also inhibited the stimulation of IGF-1 receptor autophosphorylation and the corresponding growth of p6 cells induced by IGF-2. Transcription of c-myc, c-fos, and c-jun in response to IGF-1 was inhibited by ethanol. These findings demonstrate that ethanol at low concentrations markedly inhibits IGF-1 receptor autophosphorylation and IGF-1-mediated cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W1514049495,"Wild-type Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and CHO cell transfectants expressing human folylpoly-gamma-glutamate synthetase (FPGS) activity contain mitochondrial FPGS activity of higher specific activity than the cytosolic isozyme. Expression of mitochondrial FPGS activity is required for folate accumulation by mitochondria. The mitochondrial folate pool in CHO cells is not in equilibrium with the cytosolic pool and contains folylpolyglutamates of longer glutamate chain length than cytosolic folates. The inability of AUX-coli, a CHO cell expressing high levels of Escherichia coli FPGS activity and containing pteroyltriglutamate, to support glycine synthesis is due to a lack of mitochondrial FPGS activity. AUX-coli cells lack mitochondrial folate despite containing high levels of cytosolic folate."
https://openalex.org/W1559242444,"A 693-base pair gene coding for the 27,132-dalton dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) domain of the thymidylate synthase-dihydrofolate reductase (TS-DHFR) bifunctional protein of Plasmodium falciparum was designed to have Escherichia coli codon preference and multiple unique restriction sites and was chemically synthesized. The gene was overexpressed (> 50% total cellular protein) in E. coli as insoluble inclusion bodies which could be unfolded and refolded to recover soluble enzyme activity. The refolded DHFR was purified by methotrexate-Sepharose affinity chromatography to give the homogeneous enzyme. Active site titration with methotrexate revealed that the purified protein was fully active. The purified DHFR migrates as a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with apparent mass of approximately 30 kDa, and gel filtration showed that the protein is a monomer. The yield of purified enzyme was about 5-6 mg/liter of bacterial culture. Kinetic properties of the purified recombinant DHFR were similar to those reported for wild type bifunctional TS-DHFR. Cassette mutagenesis of the synthetic gene was performed to give the S108N and the N51I + S108N mutants which provided DHFRs analogous to pyrimethamine-resistant mutants found in nature."
https://openalex.org/W1597897944,"The functional significance of receptor phosphorylation in mediating the actions of glucocorticoids remains undefined. The identification of seven phosphorylation sites in the mouse glucocorticoid receptor (Bodwell, J. E., Orti, E., Coull, J. M., Pappin, D. J. C., Smith, L. I., and Swift, F. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 7549-7555) permits a direct examination of the potential regulatory role of glucocorticoid receptor phosphorylation in transactivation. Using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of the mouse glucocorticoid receptor cDNA, we have substituted alanine or aspartate for the residues phosphorylated in this ligand-dependent transcription factor. COS-1 cells were cotransfected with mutant receptor cDNA expression vectors and a reporter plasmid containing the glucocorticoid-inducible mouse mammary tumor virus promoter linked to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase in order to characterize the effect of these substitutions on receptor-mediated gene expression. Substitution of alanine or aspartate at single phosphorylation sites does not prevent receptor transactivation. Receptors containing multiple substitutions of alanine or aspartate at the major phosphorylation sites in the acidic domain elicit levels of hormone-induced reporter gene expression that are comparable to wild-type receptors. Mutant receptors substituted with alanine at the five phosphorylation sites conserved among the rat, human, and mouse receptors exhibit a 22% decrease in transcriptional activity. Receptors mutated at all seven sites display a similar modest reduction. These results demonstrate that receptor phosphorylation at these seven identified residues is not a major determinant in glucocorticoid receptor transcriptional activity at the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1598477767,"To investigate molecular events regulating the transcription of genes inducible by phenobarbital, transgenic mouse strains were developed incorporating rat cytochrome P450 2B2 (CYP2B2) genes. Expression in mouse tissues was analyzed for two series of rat CYP2B2 gene constructs, of 19 and 39 kilobase pairs total length, each containing the entire coding region, introns, and 3'-flanking sequences of CYP2B2, but differing in the respective lengths of 5'-flanking sequence. One group of mice, whose transgene included the complete 2B2 gene but only 800 base pairs of 5'-proximal sequence, were not phenobarbital-inducible in mouse liver or in any extrahepatic tissue; rather, these genes were expressed at very high levels constitutively and selectively in only kidney and liver. A second group of mice with an identical transgene, except for the presence of an additional 19 kilobase pairs of 5'-flanking sequence, expressed 2B2 only in the liver and at high levels only after phenobarbital treatment, analogous to the expression pattern observed for the endogenous CYP2B2 gene in the rat. These results demonstrate that, in vivo, phenobarbital induction and tissue-specific control requires interaction of regulatory elements far upstream of the core CYP2B2 promoter region and upstream of motifs indicated previously as determinants of phenobarbital responsiveness."
https://openalex.org/W1503291557,"The effect of folylpoly-gamma-glutamate synthetase (FPGS) levels on folate accumulation was investigated in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing various levels of human and Escherichia coli FPGS activity. At low medium folate concentrations, folate accumulation was limited by influx and was independent of FPGS activity except in cells expressing extremely low levels of FPGS. Essentially all transported folate was metabolized to retained polyglutamate derivatives, the chain length of which varied with the level of FPGS activity. As medium folate concentration increased through the physiological to the pharmacological range, cellular folate accumulation became proportional to FPGS activity and the chain length of intracellular folates decreased. At high folate concentrations, competition between substrates for FPGS limited the extent of polyglutamylation and less than 5% of transported folate was retained by the cell. Pteroyltriglutamates functioned as effectively as the longer chain length polyglutamates normally found in mammalian cells in the metabolic cycles of de novo purine and thymidylate biosynthesis but were unable to support glycine and methionine synthesis. Transfectants expressing human FPGS and containing folates of glutamate chain length ranging from four to eight were equally effective at supporting glycine synthesis, and transfectants expressing higher levels of FPGS were able to grow in the absence of methionine. Growth in the absence of methionine required high (nonphysiological) intracellular folate levels and longer chain length polyglutamates."
https://openalex.org/W1547634286,"The trans-activating and transforming capacities of the c-myb proto-oncogene product (c-Myb) are negatively regulated through a leucine zipper structure in its negative regulatory domain. We show here tht in cotransfection assays, maximal Myb-induced trans-activation occurs with relatively low amounts of wild-type c-Myb, while higher levels of c-Myb result in reduced Myb-induced trans-activation. By contrast, this apparent negative autoregulation is not observed with a c-Myb mutant containing an impaired leucine zipper. Data presented here suggest that this negative autoregulation of trans-activation by wild-type c-Myb is a consequence of homodimer formation by c-Myb through its leucine zipper and of the inability of c-Myb dimers to bind DNA. These findings point to a novel mechanism of regulation of a transcription factor."
https://openalex.org/W1625545766,"Glycoprotein IIb (GPIIb) is an early and specific marker of the megakaryocytic lineage. We have previously shown that a fragment extending 643 base pairs upstream the transcription start site of the human GPIIb promoter was able to control the tissue-specific expression of the CAT gene in transfection experiments. Four potential GATA-binding sites, located at positions -463, -376, -243, and -54 are present within this fragment. Gel shift analysis revealed that nuclear extracts from the erythroleukemic cell line HEL contain a DNA-binding protein that recognizes these GATA sites. Using an antiserum raised to an hydrophilic region of the transcription factor GATA-1, the HEL GATA-binding protein was found to be GATA-1. Point mutations of the different GATA sites indicated that they did not equally contribute to GPIIb promoter activity. The -463 GATA motif located in an enhancer region is essential for full transcription activity and was found to be dominant upon the other GATA motifs. When this site is mutated, the -54 GATA site appears to be essential for the remaining CAT activity. These results indicate that the transcription factor GATA-1 plays an important role in the regulation of the transcription of the megakaryocyte specific GPIIb gene."
https://openalex.org/W1596163449,"Abstract The 119-kDa primary translation product of the VMA1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae undergoes a self-catalyzed rearrangement (protein splicing) that excises an internal 50-kDa segment of the polypeptide and joins the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal segments to generate the 69-kDa subunit of the vacuolar membrane-associated H(+)-ATPase. We have shown previously that the internal segment is a site-specific endonuclease (Gimble, F. S., and Thorner, J. (1992) Nature 357, 301-306). Here we describe methods for the high level expression and purification to near homogeneity of both the authentic VMA1-derived endonuclease (or VDE) from yeast (yield 18%) and a recombinant form of VDE made in bacteria (yield 29%). Detailed characterization of these preparations demonstrated that the yeast-derived and bacterially produced enzymes were indistinguishable, as judged by: (a) behavior during purification; (b) apparent native molecular mass (50 kDa); (c) immunological reactivity; and (d) catalytic properties (specific activity; cleavage site recognition; and optima for pH, temperature, divalent cation and ionic strength). The minimal site required for VDE cleavage was delimited to a 30-base pair sequence within its specific substrate (the VMA1 delta vde allele)."
https://openalex.org/W1560517624,"In striated muscle, myofibrils are anchored to an interconnecting cytoskeleton of desmin intermediate filaments. Skelemin (195 kDa) may be a link between myofibrils and the intermediate filament cytoskeleton. Skelemin partitions with desmin to the insoluble cytoskeleton, and increases the thickness of reconstituted intermediate filaments. Concentrated at the M-disc periphery, skelemin may also contact myosin filaments. We used immunoscreening to isolate a mouse muscle cDNA which encodes a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 185 kDa. Anti-skelemin antibodies bound to the protein products of each of three nonoverlapping regions of the open reading frame. Antibodies directed against the protein products of each one-third of the cDNA react with a 195-kDa muscle protein and stain the M-disc indistinguishably from the original anti-skelemin antibodies, suggesting that the cDNA encodes skelemin. A single skelemin mRNA is detected in muscle but not non-muscle tissues, consistent with immunostaining results. Skelemin is a member of a family of myosin-associated proteins containing fibronectin type III and immunoglobulin superfamily C2 motifs. Skelemin is unique in this family in having intermediate filament core-like motifs, one near each terminus. We hypothesize that skelemin could interact with myosin or myosin-associated proteins through its fibronectin and/or immunoglobulin motifs, and with intermediate filaments through intermediate filament-like motifs."
https://openalex.org/W1502148064,"The detailed mechanism underlying the inhibition of transcription by DNA methylation is still obscure. Chromatin structure has frequently been proposed as a role player in this mechanism. Histone H1 is a known key element in the formation and stabilization of chromatin fibers. We describe here experiments designed to examine the effect of DNA methylation on the binding of histone H1 to DNA and the consequent inhibitory effect of the bound histone H1 on in vitro transcription. The results of these experiments showed a clear preferential binding of histone H1 to methylated DNA as compared with unmethylated DNA. The in vitro transcription assay indicated that transcription of methylated templates was inhibited at a lower histone H1/DNA ratio than of unmethylated templates, and that the extent of inhibition depends on the density of methyl groups in the promoter region. This inhibition of in vitro transcription was alleviated efficiently by methylated competitor DNA, whereas, under similar conditions, almost no effect was observed with unmethylated competitor. Experiments designed to pinpoint the stage in the transcription process that was suppressed by the preferred binding of histone H1 to methylated template revealed that inhibition occurred at the initiation and not at the elongation level."
https://openalex.org/W1604858507,"Human pro-MMP-3 (pro-matrix metalloproteinase-3) was purified from three sources: articular cartilage and conditioned media from synovial fibroblasts and Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing recombinant pro-MMP-3. All three preparations reacted with two monoclonal antibodies specific for human fibroblast pro-MMP-3. Each preparation of active MMP-3 possessed properties identical to those previously reported for the cartilage acid metalloproteinase (MMP-6; Azzo and Woessner, J. F., Jr. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 5434-5441): an acid pH optimum of 5.3-5.5 for digestion of cartilage aggrecan; digestion of oxidized insulin B-chain at Ala14-Leu15 and Tyr16-Leu17 in a ratio of 3:1; and heat stability at neutral pH. Further characterization of MMP-3 establishes that the acid pH optimum for cartilage aggrecan is not due to substrate denaturation since the same optimum is found by viscosity assay, by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis assay of G1 domain, and by digestion of aggrecan in fresh cartilage fragments in vitro. Fibronectin was also digested optimally at pH 5.5 and NH2-terminal sequence analysis revealed no pH change in a major proteolytic site of cleavage at the Pro689-Leu690 bond. The specificity constant kcat/Km is maximal at pH 5.5 as determined in a quenched fluorescence peptide assay. This is due to an increase in kcat at pH 5.5 without any substantial effect on Km. The affinity of MMP-3 for calcium is decreased about 10-fold at pH 5.3 compared to neutral pH. Finally, the neutral cartilage metalloproteinase is identified as 72-kDa pro-MMP-2 based on M(r), specificity of insulin B-chain cleavage, and reactivity with a specific polyclonal antibody to human MMP-2."
https://openalex.org/W1531835047,"Thrombospondin 1 was recently shown to bind to and inhibit the activity of neutrophil elastase (Hogg, P. J., Owensby, D. A., Mosher, D. F., Misenheimer, T. M., and Chesterman, C. N. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 7139-7146). This finding led us to question whether thrombospondin 1 also binds and inhibits the other major serine proteinase of neutrophils, cathepsin G. In a competitive binding assay, cathepsin G bound to thrombospondin 1 reversibly and saturably with a dissociation constant in the low nanomolar range. The kinetic mechanism of inhibition of cathepsin G activity by thrombospondin 1 was determined using the synthetic cathepsin G substrate, Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide, and is consistent with hyperbolic tight-binding inhibition in which thrombospondin 1 binds cathepsin G and the Michaelis cathepsin G-substrate complex and weakens, but does not abolish, the efficiency of hydrolysis of Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide. In the presence of 2 mM calcium ions, 2.9 +/- 0.4 mol of cathepsin G interacted with 1 mol of thrombospondin 1 trimer with a site-binding constant of 7.0 +/- 3.5 nM, which reduced the efficiency of hydrolysis of Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide 8.5 +/- 1.4-fold. A lower limit for the on rate constant of 5 x 10(6) M-1 S-1 was established. The affinity of binding and stoichiometry for the interaction between cathepsin G and thrombospondin 1 was enhanced in the absence of calcium ions. In the presence of EDTA, 5.3 +/- 0.5 mol of cathepsin G interacted with 1 mol of thrombospondin 1 with a site-binding constant of 2.1 +/- 1.6 nM, implying the existence of two binding sites for cathepsin G on each subunit of thrombospondin 1, one or both of which is variably exposed and sensitive to calcium ions. Thrombospondin 1 protected fibronectin from cleavage by cathepsin G and blocked cathepsin G-mediated platelet aggregation. In summary, the binding of cathepsin G to thrombospondin 1 is tight, reversible, and close enough to the active site of cathepsin G to perturb the interactions of a small synthetic substrate and exclude a macromolecular protein substrate and platelets. Using defined proteolytic fragments and different conformers of thrombospondin 1, the binding sites for cathepsin G have been localized to the thrombospondin 1 type 3 repeats."
https://openalex.org/W1543568713,"The purification and biochemical characterization of protein substrates of the ubiquitin-dependent pathway of proteolysis is made difficult in part by the low steady state levels of ubiquitin-protein conjugates. We report here on the use of a polyhistidine-tagged ubiquitin molecule (HisUb) for the purification of ubiquitin-protein conjugates by metal chelate chromatography. When Escherichia coli extracts containing expressed HisUb were passed through a nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column containing immobilized Ni2+ ions (Ni-NTA column), HisUb was retained. After washing to remove unbound and nonspecifically bound proteins, a pH 4.5 wash was used to elute highly purified HisUb. Purified HisUb and wild-type ubiquitin were tested for their ability to form Ni(2+)-binding ubiquitin-protein conjugates in a wheat germ in vitro conjugation reaction. In some experiments, wheat germ extracts were preincubated with iodoacetamide to inhibit ubiquitin activating and conjugating enzymes. Only those conjugation assays containing HisUb and an ATP-regenerating system not pretreated with iodoacetamide produced significant levels of multiple Ni(2+)-binding ubiquitin-protein conjugates. We also examined the potential of HisUb as an affinity ligand for the purification of higher plant ubiquitin-specific hydrolases. As a test, a crude lysate of E. coli expressing a yeast ubiquitin-specific hydrolase (Yuh1) was passed through a Ni-NTA column containing bound HisUb. Yuh1 was retained on the column and was specifically eluted when the column was equilibrated with buffer containing wild-type ubiquitin."
https://openalex.org/W1586075540,"In the present paper we describe the isolation and characterization of four novel genes of the parasitic protozoan Leishmania infantum. These genes are organized as two independent gene clusters, and they are related by nucleotide sequence to eukaryotic genes encoding acidic ribosomal proteins. Each gene cluster contains two tandemly linked genes coding for identical proteins. Each of the proteins coded by the gene clusters (called LiP and LiP') are highly divergent in sequence, showing the characteristic features of eukaryotic P-proteins from the P2 group. In spite of the sequence conservation of the coding regions of each of the genes in the cluster, the 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions are heterogeneous in sequence. The analysis of the expression of these genes indicates that logarithmic phase promastigotes show increased levels of LiP- and LiP'-specific transcripts compared with stationary phase promastigotes. The steady state RNA levels of the LiP and LiP' genes show a similar dependence of the growth phase of the parasite. Using specific probes for the divergent 3'-untranslated regions of each of the genes, it was found that the abundance of the mature transcripts is different even when the transcripts are derived from the same gene cluster. These findings probably indicate that the 3'-untranslated regions may influence the stability or turnover of the transcripts derived from both LiP and LiP' gene clusters."
https://openalex.org/W1483170077,"This study on the regulation of interleukin (IL)-11 expression in human connective tissue cells shows that IL-11 expression is not restricted to cells of hematopoietic origin but can also be induced in articular chondrocytes and synoviocytes. IL-11 mRNA was induced in chondrocytes in response to transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 and IL-1 beta. Stimulation with IL-6 or growth factors, such as basic fibroblast growth factor, leukemia inhibitory factor, and platelet-derived growth factor-AA, had only weak or no detectable effects. Activation of protein kinase C by phorbol esters and inhibition of protein synthesis by cyclohexamide increased IL-11 transcripts, whereas calcium ionophore A23817 or dibutyryl cyclic AMP had no effect. Immunoprecipitations revealed the synthesis of IL-11 protein in response to TGF-beta 1, IL-1 beta, as well as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and a synergistic action of TGF-beta 1 and IL-1 beta was observed. Similar findings on IL-11 expression were made in synoviocytes. Analysis of effects on cell function showed that IL-11 stimulated the production of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases in chondrocytes and synoviocytes but did not affect chondrocyte proliferation or increase stromelysin activity. These results suggest that IL-11 does not contribute to connective tissue degradation but conversely induces protective effects in joint tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1797279406,"The two major hydrophilic domains from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase fused to glutathione S-transferase have been expressed in Escherichia coli. The GST-L peptide contained the hydrophilic region from Ala340 to Ser660. The GST-SL peptide contained in addition the hydrophilic region Glu162 to Val276. After solubilization of the inclusion bodies with urea, renaturation, and affinity chromatography, 3 mg of highly purified peptides were recovered per liter of E. coli culture. The purified peptides interacted with 2'(3')-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)-adenosine-5'-triphosphate (TNP-ATP), the fluorescence of which was enhanced identically upon binding of either GST-L or GST-SL. ATP competitively displaced the TNP-ATP binding. The observed dissociation constants for TNP-ATP (6.5 microM) and ATP (3 mM) are close to those found for the complete native H(+)-ATPase protein. The fluorescence of TNP-ATP was sensitive to Mg2+ indicating the existence of a Mg(2+)-binding site on the peptide. Apparent affinity for this Mg2+ site was found to vary from 50 microM at pH 7.5 to 400 microM at pH 5.5."
https://openalex.org/W1524291730,"Nucleotide binding properties of the G protein alpha subunit G(o)alpha were probed by mutational analysis in recombinant Escherichia coli. Thousands of random mutations generated by polymerase chain reaction were screened by in situ [35S]GTP gamma S (guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)-triphosphate) binding on the colony lifts following transformation of bacteria with modified G(o)alpha cDNA. Clones that did not bind the nucleotide under these conditions were characterized by DNA sequence analysis, and the nucleotide binding properties were further studied in crude bacterial extracts. A number of novel mutations reducing the affinity of G(o)alpha for GTP gamma S or Mg2+ were identified. Some of the mutations substitute amino acid residues homologous to those known to interact with guanine nucleotides in p21ras proteins. Other mutations show that previously unstudied residues also participate in the nucleotide binding. Several mutants lost GTP gamma S binding but retained the capacity to interact with the beta gamma subunit complex as determined by pertussis toxin-mediated ADP-ribosylation. One of these, mutant S47C, was functionally expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes along with the G protein-coupled thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) receptor. Whereas wild-type G(o)alpha increased TRH-promoted chloride currents, S47C significantly decreased the hormone-induced Cl- response, suggesting that this mutation resulted in a dominant negative phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1522337629,"Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing human and Escherichia coli folylpoly-gamma-glutamate synthetase (FPGS) activities were used as models to study factors regulating the cytotoxicity and metabolism of methotrexate (MTX). CHO cells expressing human FPGS metabolized MTX to polyglutamates characteristic of human cells. Cellular MTX accumulation and metabolism to polyglutamates were dependent on the level of FPGS activity and were unaffected by putative gamma-glutamyl hydrolase inhibitors. The sensitivity of cells continuously exposed to MTX was not influenced by FPGS activity. After short term exposure to MTX, cells expressing higher levels of FPGS were more sensitive to the drug. MTX was not transported into the mitochondria and MTX treatment had no effect on preexisting mitochondrial folates while cytosolic folates were converted to oxidized forms. Mitochondrial folate accumulation was significantly impaired by MTX treatment, suggesting that the mitochondrial folate transport system is specific for reduced folates."
https://openalex.org/W1562346596,"Arginine kinase belongs to an evolutionary conserved family of ATP:guanidino phosphotransferases, whose members play an important role in energy metabolism. In this work, a lambda gt11 lobster muscle library was constructed and screened by using both polyclonal antibodies and two synthetic oligonucleotides. The complete amino acid sequence of arginine kinase (ATP:L-arginine N-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.3.3) from lobster muscle was determined by cloning and sequencing the DNA complementary to its mRNA. The identity of the clone was confirmed by comparing the amino acid sequence deduced by nucleotide sequence analysis with previously published partial sequences of amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of the enzyme and some of its fragments (Regnouf, F., Kassab, R., Debuire, B., Richard, C., and Han K. K. (1981) Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 17, 143-155). The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA was found to contain an open reading frame encoding 355 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 39,830 daltons. This enzyme exhibits a significant sequence identity to those of representative members of the guanidino kinase family, including creatine kinase. This report represents the first molecular cloning and sequencing of an ATP-guanidino phosphotransferase which is not a creatine kinase isoform."
https://openalex.org/W1488825373,"Sepharose beads bound to 55Fe-transferrin (Tf) were used to evaluate Tf-dependent iron uptake not employing receptor-mediated endocytosis (RME). The iron of 55Fe2-Tf-Sepharose was reduced and taken up by cultured human fibroblasts in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion (Km 7 microM; Vmax 128 pmol/mg/min). This redox system resembled that for Tf-independent iron uptake (Tf-IU, evaluated using 55Fe-citrate) in several ways. 1) NH4Cl did not inhibit iron uptake from 55Fe-citrate and 55Fe2-Tf-Sepharose but did inhibit uptake from 55Fe2-Tf (RME system). 2) Iron uptake and reduction from 55Fe2-Tf-Sepharose and 55Fe-citrate increased with temperature hyperbolically, differing from the sigmoidal curve for RME uptake. 3) The subcellular distributions of iron from 55Fe-citrate and 55Fe2-Tf-Sepharose resembled each other and differed from that for 55Fe2-Tf. 4) The optimal pH for iron reduction and uptake using 55Fe2-Tf-Sepharose or 55Fe-citrate was less than pH 5.5, while that for iron uptake from 55Fe2-Tf was pH 7.4. 5) The uptake and reduction of iron from 55Fe2-Tf-Sepharose was inhibited by ferric citrate and by transition metals. We conclude that both Tf-independent and non-RME, Tf-dependent iron uptake proceed via a common redox system for iron. The mechanisms of cellular iron uptake can be separately evaluated in fibroblasts using 55Fe-citrate, 55Fe2-Tf, and 55Fe2-Tf-Sepharose beads."

The reaction is catalyzed by (S)-3-O-geranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate ((S)-GGGP) synthase. The cytosolic enzyme was purified to homogeneity from the moderately thermophilic archaebacterium Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum by a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation, four chromatographic steps (DE52, Q-Sepharose, phenyl-Superose, and Protein Pak), and native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of gel-purified GGGP synthase gave a single band at 29 kDa. The enzyme requires Mg2+ for optimal activity, although prenyltransfer is also seen in buffers containing Mn2+ or Zn2+. A well defined pH optimum occurs between 6.0 and 7.5. Maximal activity is seen at 50-65 degrees C. The Michaelis constants for GGGP synthase are Vmax = 4.1 +/- 0.5 mumol min-1 mg-1, KMGGPP = 4.1 +/- 1.1 microM, and KMGP = 41 +/- 5 microM."
https://openalex.org/W1528208346,"Omeprazole and E3810 were found to inhibit gastric H+,K(+)-ATPase following different biochemical mechanisms. Effects of the specific binding of the inhibitors on the conformational state of the enzyme were studied by measuring the fluorescence of the enzyme labeled with fluorescein 5'-isothiocyanate. The absolute fluorescence level of the omeprazole-bound enzyme was lower than that of the control enzyme, and reduction of S-S cross-linking between the enzyme and omeprazole increased the fluorescence. Addition of K+ into the control vesicle solution quenched the fluorescence (E1-->E2K+). The quench was inhibited in the omeprazole-bound enzyme but not in the E3810-bound enzyme. These results suggest that the omeprazole-bound enzyme has a low fluorescence conformation (E2 form). On the other hand, the conformation of the E3810-bound enzyme was the same as that of the control enzyme (E1 form). Phosphoenzyme formation in the absence of K+ was inhibited in both the E3810- and omeprazole-bound enzymes. Binding of 2',3'-o-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)adenosine 5'-triphosphate to the enzyme was equally inhibited by E3810 and omeprazole. K(+)-dependent dephosphorylation from the phosphoenzyme was inhibited in the E3810-bound enzyme but not in the omeprazole-bound enzyme. These experimental results have shown that the inhibition mechanism of H+,K(+)-ATPase by omeprazole was different from that by E3810; the partial reaction that was the most differently affected by the inhibitors was the conformational change from the E2 to E1 form for omeprazole and the luminal K(+)-dependent dephosphorylation for E3810."
https://openalex.org/W1585582006,"Abstract Trypanosoma brucei belongs to a family of protozoa that is characterized as having diverged early in the evolution of eukaryotes. Many unusual forms of RNA processing have been discovered in these cells, one of which is trans-splicing, and, although a great number of genes have been sequenced, no evidence for cis-splicing has yet been found. This study shows that tRNA(Tyr) of T. brucei contains an 11-nucleotide intron. tRNA of the size predicted for unspliced precursor was detected by Northern analysis using an oligonucleotide probe complementary to the putative intervening region. Direct sequence analysis of mature tRNA(Tyr) showed that the predicted intron region is absent from this form of the molecule. Mutated versions of the gene encoding tRNA(Tyr) were introduced into trypanosomes by DNA transformation and shown to be expressed in vivo. Introduction into the genome of a tRNA(Tyr) gene containing an amber suppressor mutation led to a significant accumulation of unspliced precursor molecules. Analysis of the tRNA(Tyr) species from both the wild type and transformed cells revealed unspliced and spliced processing intermediates. The relative abundance of each of these intermediates suggests that 3'-processing and splicing occur independently and that, in the wild type, splicing tends to precede 3'-processing and CCA addition."
https://openalex.org/W1618965730,"In this paper, we report that p34cdc2 protein kinase phosphorylates recombinant fragments of skeletal muscle dystrophin with a maximal incorporation of 1.8 mol of Pi/mol of protein. Phosphorylation of both serine and threonine residues occurs within the carboxyl-terminal 201 amino acids of dystrophin, with phosphothreonine localized to within 25 residues of the carboxyl terminus. Supporting these in vitro studies, we also show that native dystrophin is phosphorylated by p34cdc2 kinase in isolated sarcolemmal vesicles. Sequence analysis indicates two consensus sites for p34cdc2 protein kinase within the carboxyl-terminal 201 amino acids of dystrophin. Importantly, neither of these sites is conserved in dystrophin-related protein, and only one site is conserved in the 71-kDa alternative product of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene, despite an otherwise extremely high degree of sequence conservation between these proteins. Importantly, in this study we also show that dystrophin is phosphorylated in vivo in rat skeletal muscle primary cultures, and we suggest that further investigation of both in vivo and in vitro phosphorylation of this protein will comprise an important part in determination of its function(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1909921560,"Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were used to study the synthesis of diglycerides from choline phospholipids (PC) in response to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). In this system, diglyceride formation was blocked in the presence of ethanol (0.5%), and a corresponding amount of phosphatidylethanol (PEt) was formed, indicating that phospholipase D is responsible for the diglyceride production. Analysis of the subclasses of phosphatidylethanol revealed 1-O-alkyl-(alkyl), 1-O-alk-1'-enyl-(alkenyl), and 1-acyl species of PEt (38.0, 8.3, and 53.7%, respectively). The molecular species of the alkyl-PEt most closely matched the alkyl-PC. No change in the relative amounts of alkyl- versus acyl-PEt was observed with time after stimulation. Comparison of the alkyl content of PEt (38.0%) and the parent PC (15.2%) indicated a marked selectivity for the alkyl subclass of PC. A cell-free assay (Huang, C., Wykle, R. L., Daniel, L. W., and Cabot, M. C. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 16859-16865) for phospholipase D was also used to confirm the selectivity of the enzyme for alkyl-PC versus acyl-PC. The predominant molecular species of PEt contained saturated acyl or alkyl chains in position-1 and monounsaturated residues in position-2 accounting for approximately 50% of the total PEt. 1-O-Octadecyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycerol, a representative alkyl molecular species, was synthesized and tested for its effect upon protein kinase C derived from MDCK cells. This alkyl-diglyceride (DG) neither stimulated protein kinase C nor inhibited its activation by diacylglycerol. In summary, TPA-stimulated phospholipase D is selective for the alkyl-PC subclass in MDCK cells. The alkyl-DG subsequently formed does not appear to function as a second-messenger in activating protein kinase C."

(1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 13536-13540; Smeland, E., Jianxun, L., Chu, C., Cuebas, D., and Schulz, H. (1989) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 160, 988-992) was studied in rat liver. Subcellular fractionations of rat liver on different density gradients revealed a dual distribution of activity, catalyzing dehydration of D-3-hydroxydecanoyl-CoA to trans-2-decenoyl-CoA (hydratase 2) in both peroxisomal and microsomal compartments. Both hydratase 2 activity peaks were separated by dye ligand chromatography from the extract of the combined heavy and light mitochondrial fractions. The activity eluted at low salt was identified as the microsomal isoform and was purified to apparent homogeneity. The M(r) of the native protein (subunit) was found to be 60,000 (31,500), indicating that it is homodimeric. The enzyme activity was inhibited by IgGs isolated from antisera raised against the denatured subunit. The activity eluted at high salt was tentatively identified to be peroxisomal of origin, and the M(r) of the native protein (subunit) was determined to be 62,000 (33,500). The peroxisomal enzyme was not recognized by the antibody to its microsomal counterpart. Analysis of the reaction products of microsomal enzyme activity by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry showed that the enzyme catalyzed reversibly hydration/dehydration between trans-2-enoyl-CoA and D-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA, but L-3-hydroxydecanoyl-CoA was not dehydrated to delta 2-enoyl-CoA compounds. Similar reaction characteristics were also determined for the peroxisomal hydratase by using stereospecific auxiliary enzymes. The present data demonstrate that rat liver contains microsomal and peroxisomal proteins possessing hydratase 2 activities. Although their kinetic properties are similar, immunological data, subunit sizes, and chromatographic evidence clearly indicate that they are different enzymes. Comparisons with other hydratases revealed that the microsomal and peroxisomal hydratase 2 described in the present work are proteins that have not been previously purified."
https://openalex.org/W1557505693,"We have compared the ability of lactoferrin and transferrin to interact with and donate iron to the monocytic cell line U937. About 10 times more lactoferrin was bound than transferrin, but most lactoferrin bound nonspecifically, and the degree of specific binding was similar for both proteins (2-3 x 10(6) sites/cell). The binding affinity for lactoferrin (83 nM) was about 4-fold lower than for transferrin (21 nM). Lactoferrin did not inhibit binding of transferrin, or vice versa. Binding of lactoferrin was not inhibited by 30 mM glucose or fucose nor by incubating the cells with heparinase. Transferrin, but not lactoferrin, was internalized, and 3 mM primaquine caused intracellular accumulation of transferrin but not lactoferrin. The cells rapidly acquired iron from transferrin, but uptake from lactoferrin was 10-fold slower and probably resulted from transfer of 59Fe from lactoferrin to unlabeled transferrin during culture. Lactoferrin, but not transferrin, released iron to the extracellular medium when bound to U937 cells. Lactoferrin inhibited cellular uptake of iron from Fe-nitrilotriacetate but not from transferrin. It is concluded that transferrin, but not lactoferrin, acts as an iron donor to U937 cells. Lactoferrin may regulate uptake of potentially toxic non-transferrin-bound iron."
https://openalex.org/W1495875155,"Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE) enters cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis and is cleaved by a cellular protease between Arg279 and Gly280 to produce an NH2-terminal fragment of 28 kDa which contains the toxin's binding domain and a COOH-terminal fragment of 37 kDa which has translocating and ADP-ribosylating activity. After proteolysis, the COOH-terminal fragment reaches the endoplasmic reticulum by retrograde transport where it translocates to the cytosol and inhibits protein synthesis by ADP-ribosylating elongation factor 2. To understand how the 37-kDa fragment functions, we focused on the role of specific amino acids located near its NH2 terminus. We found that there was a 4-250-fold loss in toxic activity when tryptophan 281, leucine 284, or tyrosine 289 were changed to other residues. Mutations at these three positions did not interfere with the receptor binding, cell-mediated proteolytic cleavage, or ADP-ribosylating activity. To determine the role of these amino acids, a competition assay was devised in which the addition of excess PE delta 553, a mutant form of PE that lacks ADP-ribosylation activity, competed efficiently for the toxicity of PE. Excess PE with mutations near the NH2 terminus of the 37-kDa fragment competed poorly. This competition occurred after proteolysis since PEGly276, a mutant form of PE that is not cleaved, did not complete. We conclude that specific amino acids at the NH2 terminus of the 37-kDa fragment interact in a saturable manner with an unknown intracellular component."
https://openalex.org/W1518828006,"Valine, leucine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine substitutions at the beta 6 position of hemoglobin (Hb) were made using a yeast expression system coupled with a polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis strategy. The oxygen affinity and absorption spectra of these mutants were similar to recombinant Hb A except for Hb beta E6W which had a higher absorbance at approximately 280 nm. The deoxy forms of Hb beta E6L and Hb S showed characteristic delay times prior to polymerization. Tetrameric deoxy-Hbs containing tryptophan or phenylalanine at the beta 6 position had higher solubilities and polymerized less readily compared with deoxy-Hb S. However, when oversaturated, these Hbs polymerized without a delay time. These results suggest that Hb beta E6W and Hb beta E6F form polymers upon deoxygenation by a linear polymerization mechanism without nuclei formation. During polymerization, bulky hydrophobic amino acids, like phenylalanine and tryptophan at the beta 6 position, might interact with the acceptor pocket on the surface of an adjacent Hb molecule but may not be able to form stable hydrophobic interactions like beta 6 valine and leucine. Difficulty in insertion of the bulky side chains of these aromatic amino acids into the hydrophobic acceptor pocket on an adjacent tetramer may inhibit nuclei formation prior to polymerization."
https://openalex.org/W1553613167,"A recent report described a thrombin inhibitory activity in the soluble fraction of human placenta and the cytosolic fraction of K562 cells. Isolation and characterization of the functionally inactive 35-38-kDa placental form of this protein revealed that it was a novel serine proteinase inhibitor (Coughlin, P. B., Tetaz, T., and Salem, H. H. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 9541-9547). In the present study, we observed a 67-kDa sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-stable complex when 125I-thrombin was incubated with the cytosolic fraction of a monkey kidney epithelial cell line, BSC-1. This complex was not observed in either the particulate cell fraction extracted with 0.2% Triton X-100 or medium conditioned by cells, suggesting that the thrombin-complexing factor is confined to the cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic antithrombin activity was purified to apparent homogeneity from the cytosol of BSC-1 cells previously pulsed with [35S]methionine by a combination of heparin-agarose chromatography, Mono Q fast protein liquid chromatography, and anhydrotrypsin-Affi-Gel 10 affinity chromatography. Analysis of the affinity-purified preparation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography revealed a single protein with an apparent molecular mass of 38 kDa. The purified 38-kDa protein inhibited the amidolytic activities of thrombin, trypsin, urokinase, and factor Xa but not that of elastase. Incubation of the 38-kDa protein with excess thrombin identified approximately 60% of the labeled 38-kDa protein in an SDS-stable 67-kDa complex. The purified 38-kDa inhibitor was cleaved with cyanogen bromide and the isolated peptides subjected to microsequencing. Amino acid sequence obtained for a region within this protein exhibited significant homology with human antithrombin III and plasminogen activator inhibitors 1 and 2. This homologous peptide contained the full complement of residues designated as highly conserved in helix F of the greater serine proteinase inhibitor superfamily. In addition, an internal sequence of GGGGDIHQGF was found in the monkey cytoplasmic inhibitor, which is identical to that reported for an internal sequence of the human placental inhibitor. These findings confirm the existence of a novel cytoplasmic serine proteinase inhibitor in mammalian cells and provide additional details of its molecular properties. The physiological function of this novel serine proteinase inhibitor in cytoplasm is unknown."
https://openalex.org/W1912984306,"The autogenously regulated gene pir of Escherichia coli plasmid R6K encodes the replication protein pi. This protein binds to two sites in the operator region of the pir gene: a 22-base pair nonpalindromic sequence and a pair of palindromic 9-base pair sequences. These pi-binding sites are similar, suggesting that pi uses a single DNA-binding domain in recognizing them. We devised a plasmid system permitting isolation of mutants of the pi protein which are altered in autoregulation. A Ser87 to Asn substitution in one such mutant, designated pi 87, reduces the protein's ability to repress the pir gene promoter in vivo. DNase I protection and gel retardation assays were carried out with highly purified pi 87 protein. In these studies pi 87 exhibited altered binding to the palindromic but not to the nonpalindromic part of the operator of the pir gene. Chemical cross-linking and gel filtration analyses have shown that the dimerization properties of wild type pi and pi 87 proteins are similar in solution. We propose that the interaction of pi protein with the palindromic part of the pir operator is essential for autoregulation; we also propose that there is a fundamental difference in the mechanisms of pi protein recognition of palindromic and nonpalindromic sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1493320350,"Lactosylceramide N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GlcNac-Tr) in the synthesis of lactotriosylceramide (LcOse3Cer) was characterized in the nervous system. The microsomal membrane GlcNAc-Tr required a divalent metal ion, preferably Mn2+, and a nonionic detergent. The pH optimum was around 7.0. The enzyme also transferred GlcNAc to neolactotetraosylceramide (nLcOse4Cer), GM1, and asialo-GM1, but not to other glycolipids. The Km value for lactosylceramide was 21 microM (Vmax = 91 pmol/mg/h), and that for nLcOse4Cer was 35 microM (Vmax = 112 pmol/mg/h). The GlcNAc-Tr for the glycolipids appears to be separate from that for oligosaccharides. The developmental expression of GlcNAc-Tr, both in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum, correlated well with the tissue levels of LcOse3Cer, nLcOse4Cer, sulfoglucuronylglycolipids (SGGLs), and other neolacto series glycolipids (nLSGs). In the cerebral cortex, the specific activity of GlcNAc-Tr decreased sharply from a maximum level at embryonic day 15, and by postnatal day 10 onward, it was undetectable. In the adult cerebral cortex, although significant activities of other glycosyltransferases involved in the subsequent steps of the synthesis of SGGLs were present, the absence of GlcNAc-Tr stymied the formation of LcOse3Cer and therefore the synthesis of nLSGs, including SGGLs. In the cerebellum, the GlcNAc-Tr specific activity declined from the day of birth to postnatal day 3, but later, the activity increased and reached a maximum at postnatal day 15, which correlated with the increasing synthesis of nLSGs. The results indicate that lactosylceramide GlcNAc-Tr is the key regulatory enzyme controlling the differential expression of all nLSGs in the developing nervous system."

Glycogenin undergoes self-glucosylation to generate an oligosaccharide primer, which, when long enough, supports the action of glycogen synthase to elongate the polysaccharide chain, leading ultimately to the formation of glycogen. We report that primed glycogenin is also a substrate for glycogen phosphorylase. Phosphorylase removed glucose from the oligosaccharide attached to glycogenin in a phosphorolysis reaction that required phosphate and produced glucose 1-phosphate. The phosphorylated form, phosphorylase a, was much more effective than the dephosphorylated phosphorylase b. However, in the presence of the allosteric effector AMP, phosphorylase b also catalyzed the phosphorolysis reaction. Glucose, an allosteric inhibitor of phosphorylase, inhibited the reaction. Glycogen, but not a short oligosaccharide (maltopentaose), also inhibited the reaction. Treatment of fully primed glycogenin with phosphorylase converted the glycogenin to a form with slightly lower apparent molecular weight, which was less effective as a substrate for glycogen synthase. These results suggest a novel role for phosphorylase in the control of glycogen biosynthesis. We propose that the glucosylation level of glycogenin would be determined by the balance between the self-glucosylation reaction and the opposing action of phosphorylase. The level of glucosylation would in turn determine whether or not glycogenin was an effective primer for glycogen synthase. In this way, several known controls of phosphorylase activity, such as epinephrine, glucagon, and insulin, could influence not only the elongation/degradation stage of glycogen metabolism but also its initiation."

These mammalian alkaline phosphatases have histidine at the position corresponding to 153 of the E. coli sequence. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of the mutant E. coli alkaline phosphatase with histidine at position 153. The structure reveals that the octahedral magnesium binding site has been converted to a tetrahedral zinc binding site with an imidazole ring nitrogen of His-153 as one of the ligands to the zinc. The alteration in metal binding caused by the mutation could explain the origin of the magnesium activation observed with the mammalian alkaline phosphatases. The structure also reveals differences in the mode of phosphate binding, explaining the enhanced phosphate affinity and the reduced activity of the mutant enzyme in the presence of zinc."
https://openalex.org/W1499031377,"Mutations were introduced in the highly conserved carboxyl-terminal region of the third cytoplasmic loop of the mouse m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) gene by site-directed mutagenesis. The effects of these mutations on ligand binding and on mAChR coupling to phosphoinositide turnover have been examined following expression in mouse Y1 adrenal carcinoma cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and Rat-2 fibroblasts. Point mutations in the region proximal to the sixth transmembrane domain had no effect on antagonist binding but did result in decreased agonist affinity. A deletion of four amino acids in the same region effectively uncoupled the receptor from phosphoinositol turnover in Y1 adrenal carcinoma cells but had no effect in either CHO cells or Rat-2 fibroblasts. Differential sensitivity to pertussis toxin indicates that the m1 mAChR can interact with multiple G-proteins in CHO cells and Rat-2 cells via distinct recognition sites on the receptor. These data demonstrate multiple G-proteins can interact with an individual receptor, that the same receptor may couple to different second messenger pathways, and that these responses can vary in a cell type-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W1555099949,"An endopeptidase activity that cleaves glucagon, producing miniglucagon or glucagon (19-29), a Ca2+ pump inhibitory peptide, was isolated from rat liver membranes. The purified enzyme has a molecular mass of approximately 100 kDa and a pH optimum of approximately 8. It is inhibited by both sulfhydryl-blocking reagents and metal-chelating reagents and activated by thiol compounds. The partial N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 100-kDa protein does not correspond to any known protein. An antiserum was raised against a synthetic octapeptide corresponding to the N-terminal sequence. Immunoblot analysis of crude liver membranes revealed a single band at 100 kDa. Immunoreactivity was found in liver, pancreas, and heart, which are glucagon and miniglucagon target tissues, and in gastric mucosa and kidney. Low levels were detected in spleen, whereas immunoreactivity was undetectable in skeletal muscle and intestinal mucosa. The endopeptidase activity was inhibited by insulin, glucagon-like peptide-1, and glucagon-like peptide-1 (7-36) amide, whereas other peptides that contain dibasic sites had no effect on its activity, indicating that the endopeptidase does not display strict selectivity toward basic doublets."
https://openalex.org/W1580274291,"Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell transfectants expressing various levels of human and Escherichia coli folylpoly-gamma-glutamate synthetase (FPGS) activity and possessing different folylpolyglutamate chain length distributions have been developed as models for folate and antifolate metabolism. The synthesis of pteroyltriglutamate was sufficient for normal cellular retention of folate and also overcame the phenotypic requirement for purines and thymidine of AUXB1, a CHO cell mutant lacking FPGS activity and lacking folylpolyglutamates. Only low levels of FPGS are required to enable cellular metabolism of folates to forms that are retained by mammalian cells. The higher levels found in mammalian cells are required for the synthesis of the long chain polyglutamate derivatives characteristic of mammalian cells. At low medium folate concentrations, folate accumulation by transfectants expressing human FPGS was not responsive to FPGS levels as the limiting step in metabolism was beyond the triglutamate, the chain length required for retention. The rate-limiting step in folate metabolism in cells expressing the E. coli enzyme was the conversion of diglutamate to triglutamate, and, at low FPGS levels, the E. coli enzyme was about 50-fold less effective than the human FPGS in enabling cellular folate accumulation. These data suggest that cellular accumulation of any folate analog whose mono- or diglutamate derivative is a poor substrate for FPGS would be very responsive to the level of FPGS activity."
https://openalex.org/W1546571763,"Abstract A novel DNA helicase, scHelI, has been purified from whole cell extracts of Saccharomyces cerevisiae using biochemical assays to monitor the fractionation. The enzyme unwinds partial duplex DNA substrates, as long as 343 base pairs in length, in a reaction that is dependent on either ATP or dATP hydrolysis. scHelI also catalyzes a single-stranded DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis reaction; the apparent Km for ATP is 325 microM. The unwinding reaction on circular partial duplex substrates is biphasic, with a fast component occurring within 5 min of the initiation of the reaction and a slow component continuing to 60 min. This is in contrast to the ATP hydrolysis reaction, which exhibits linear kinetics for 60 min. The direction of the unwinding reaction is 5' to 3' with respect to the strand of DNA on which the enzyme is bound. The unwinding reaction is strongly stimulated by the addition of Escherichia coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein when long partial duplex substrates are used. The enzymatic activity of scHelI copurifies with a polypeptide of 135 kDa as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The polypeptide sediments as a monomer in a glycerol gradient in the presence of 0.2 M NaCl."
