https://openalex.org/W2032018678,"Systems with a ferroelectric to paraelectric transition in the vicinity of room temperature are useful for devices. Adjusting the ferroelectric transition temperature (T(c)) is traditionally accomplished by chemical substitution-as in Ba(x)Sr(1-x)TiO(3), the material widely investigated for microwave devices in which the dielectric constant (epsilon(r)) at GHz frequencies is tuned by applying a quasi-static electric field. Heterogeneity associated with chemical substitution in such films, however, can broaden this phase transition by hundreds of degrees, which is detrimental to tunability and microwave device performance. An alternative way to adjust T(c) in ferroelectric films is strain. Here we show that epitaxial strain from a newly developed substrate can be harnessed to increase T(c) by hundreds of degrees and produce room-temperature ferroelectricity in strontium titanate, a material that is not normally ferroelectric at any temperature. This strain-induced enhancement in T(c) is the largest ever reported. Spatially resolved images of the local polarization state reveal a uniformity that far exceeds films tailored by chemical substitution. The high epsilon(r) at room temperature in these films (nearly 7,000 at 10 GHz) and its sharp dependence on electric field are promising for device applications."

Principal temperature sensors belong to the TRP cation channel family, but the mechanisms underlying the marked temperature sensitivity of opening and closing ('gating') of these channels are unknown. Here we show that temperature sensing is tightly linked to voltage-dependent gating in the cold-sensitive channel TRPM8 and the heat-sensitive channel TRPV1. Both channels are activated upon depolarization, and changes in temperature result in graded shifts of their voltage-dependent activation curves. The chemical agonists menthol (TRPM8) and capsaicin (TRPV1) function as gating modifiers, shifting activation curves towards physiological membrane potentials. Kinetic analysis of gating at different temperatures indicates that temperature sensitivity in TRPM8 and TRPV1 arises from a tenfold difference in the activation energies associated with voltage-dependent opening and closing. Our results suggest a simple unifying principle that explains both cold and heat sensitivity in TRP channels."
https://openalex.org/W1965228262,"The long-term response of coral reefs to climate change depends on the ability of reef-building coral symbioses to adapt or acclimatize to warmer temperatures, but there has been no direct evidence that such a response can occur. Here we show that corals containing unusual algal symbionts that are thermally tolerant and commonly associated with high-temperature environments are much more abundant on reefs that have been severely affected by recent climate change. This adaptive shift in symbiont communities indicates that these devastated reefs could be more resistant to future thermal stress, resulting in significantly longer extinction times for surviving corals than had been previously assumed."

Here I show that some corals have adapted to higher temperatures, at least in part, by hosting specifically adapted Symbiodinium. If other coral species can host these or similar Symbiodinium taxa, they might adapt to warmer habitats relatively easily."

During evolution many organisms (e.g. diatoms, sponges, radiolaria) have acquired the ability to use the ubiquitous monosilicic acid Si(OH)4 for the formation of species specifi- cally structured, silica-based exo- or endoskeletons (1Simpson T.L. Volcani B.E. Silicon and Siliceous Structures in Biological Systems. Springer New York Inc., New York1981Crossref Google Scholar). This interesting biomineralization phenomenon is mediated by cellular organic (macro-) molecules that accelerate silicic acid polycondensation and control morphogenesis of the forming silica (2Bäuerlein E. Biomineralization: From Biology to Biotechnology and Medical Application. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany2000Google Scholar). Diatoms are an extremely large group (>10,000 species) of unicellular eukaryotic algae that play a major role in biological silica cycling. Within the last few years diatom biosilica-associated proteins (termed silaffins) and long chain polyamines (LCPA) 1The abbreviations used are: LCPA, long chain polyamines; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PTC, phenylthiocarbamyl; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; HF, hy- drofluoric acid. have been identified and hypothesized to represent key components of the diatom biosilica-forming machinery. Silaffins and LCPA exhibit the remarkable abil- ity to induce rapid silica deposition in vitro and to control the nanostructure of the forming silica (3Kröger N. Sumper M. J. Mater. Chem. 2004; 14: 2059-2065Crossref Google Scholar). Therefore, unraveling the correlations between chemical structures, physical prop- erties, and silica-forming activities of silaffins and LCPA will be important for understanding the molecular mechanism of species-specific biosilica nanopatterning. So far, silaffins have only been characterized from the diatom Cylindrotheca fusiformis. They are highly modified proteins/peptides rich in hydroxyamino acids (serine, threonine, hydroxyproline) and lysine residues. Silaffins natSil1A and -1B are O-phosphoryl- ated at numerous sites and contain polyamine-modified ly- sine residues, features that enable these peptides to rapidly form silica nanospheres in vitro (4Kröger N. Lorenz S. Brunner E. Sumper M. Science. 2002; 298: 584-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Recently, natSil2, an acidic, glycosylated phosphoprotein of 40 kDa, has been char- acterized which represents a different type of silaffin. This protein lacks inherent silica-forming activity, yet it is able to regulate the silica forming activities of natSil1A and LCPA and strongly influences the nanostructure of in vitro formed silica (5Poulsen N. Sumper M. Kröger N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12075-12080Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, because of the extremely high num- ber of modified amino acids in natSil2, peptide mapping did not yield sufficient sequence information to clone the corre- sponding gene, and thus, the primary structures of regula- tory silaffins have so far remained unknown. It has been suggested that morphogenesis of nanopatterned silica in diatoms generally requires two components: first, mole- cules like LCPA or natSil1A that accelerate silica formation, and second, natSil2-like molecules that exhibit regulatory properties (5Poulsen N. Sumper M. Kröger N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12075-12080Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). However, because the biosilica architecture of C. fusiformis is rather unusual, being composed mainly of long, non-porous bands (Fig.1, A and C), it has been unclear if general conclusions about the mechanism of diatom biosilica morphogenesis can be drawn from the properties of its silica-forming components. In the present study we have investigated the silaffins from the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana, a species exhibiting porous biosilica nanopatterns (Fig. 1, B and D). It is demonstrated that the major silaffins of this organism represent natSil2-like pro- teins, with distinct capabilities of influencing silica morphogen- esis by interactions with LCPA. In contrast, natSil1-like proteins appear to be absent in T. pseudonana. The complete genome sequence of T. pseudonana 2genome.jgi-psf.org/diatom. allowed identification of the silaffin genes from scarce peptide sequence information. Isolation of the corresponding cDNAs and biochemical analysis of the proteins enabled unprecedented insight into the chemical structures of regulatory silaffins. Culture Conditions—T. pseudonana clone CCMP1335 was grown in an artificial seawater medium according to the North East Pacific Culture Collection (ocgy.ubc.ca/projects/nepcc/media.htm) supplemented with 100 μg/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 18 °C under constant light at 5,000–10,000 lux. Isolation of Silaffins and LCPA—Isolation of T. pseudonana biosilica was performed as described for other diatom species (7Kröger N. Deutzmann R. Bergsdorf C. Sumper M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14133-14138Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar) with an addi- tional acetone wash after the first SDS/EDTA extraction. Ammonium fluoride extraction of purified cell walls was as described (4Kröger N. Lorenz S. Brunner E. Sumper M. Science. 2002; 298: 584-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). The extract was dialyzed (500-Da cut off) once against H2O and then against 50 mm ammonium acetate. The dialysate was loaded onto a HighS cation exchange column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in 50 mm ammonium acetate. After washing the column with 50 mm ammonium acetate and 0.5 m ammonia, LCPA were eluted with 2 m NaCl in pH 10 buffer (100 mm ammonia, 50 mm ammonium acetate). The eluate was exhaustively dialyzed against 10 mm ammonium acetate, lyophilized, and loaded onto a Superdex-Peptide HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences; running buffer 250 mm ammonium acetate, 0.25 ml/min flow rate). Fractions were analyzed by Tricine-SDS-PAGE (8Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar) and staining with Coomassie Blue. Fractions containing pure LCPA were pooled and lyophilized, and the dry residue was dissolved in H2O. For isolation of silaffins the flow-through from the HighS cation exchange column and the 50 mm ammonium acetate wash were pooled, concentrated by ly- ophilization, and then subjected to fractionation using a Superdex200 HiLoad 16/60 column (Amersham Biosciences; running buffer 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm ammonium acetate, 1.0 ml/min flow rate). Fractions were analyzed by Tricine-SDS-PAGE (8Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar) and staining with Stains All (SIGMA). Fractions eluting between 45 and 60 min (containing tp- Sil1/2H and tpSil3) were combined (Peak A), and fractions eluting between 75 and 85 min (containing tpSil1/2L) were combined (Peak B). Peak A and Peak B were concentrated by ultrafiltration (cut off 10 kDa) and loaded separately onto a Mono Q HR-5/5 column (Amersham Bio- sciences) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.4. Elution was per- formed at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min by linearly increasing the NaCl concentration to 2 m in 1 h. In runs with material from Peak A, tpSil3 eluted between 22.5 and 28.5 min and tpSil1/2H eluted between 39 and 48 min. In runs with material from Peak B, tpSil1/2L eluted between 26.5 and 43.5 min. Fractions containing individual silaffins were pooled, exhaustively dialyzed (cut off 7 kDa) against 10 mm ammonium acetate, and lyophilized. The dry residue was dissolved in water, ad- justed to pH 5.5 with acetic acid/NaOH, and stored frozen at -20 °C until use. Chemical Analysis of Silaffins—Phosphate (9Buss J.E. Stull J.T.

Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (41197) Google Scholar) contents were determined according standard protocols. Carbohydrate analysis was performed as described (5Poulsen N. Sumper M. Kröger N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12075-12080Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Silica Formation in Vitro—Silica formation assays were performed in 100 mm silicic acid, 50 mm sodium acetate pH 5.5 as described (5Poulsen N. Sumper M. Kröger N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12075-12080Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Scanning Electron Microscopy—Samples were washed with water by repetitive centrifugation and resuspension, mounted onto a copper grid, and air dried. Images were obtained on a LEO 1530 field emission scanning electron microscope (Oberkochen, Germany). Peptide Mapping—HF-treated silaffins (50–100 μg) were dissolved in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, supplemented with trypsin (2–5 μg) and incubated at 37 °C for 12–16 h. The material was separated by reverse phase HPLC on a C18 column (Sephasil C18, 5 μm SC 2.1/10, Amer- sham Biosciences) by application of an acetonitrile gradient (buffer A: 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O; buffer B: 0.085% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile; gradient 0–50% buffer B in 30 min). The material of selected peaks was rechromatographed, and resulting peak fractions were sequenced by Edman degradation using an automated gas-phase sequencer (Applied Biosystems). To isolate the 35-kDa tryptic fragment from tpSil1/2H, the digest was directly subjected to size-exclusion chro- matography on a Superose 12 HR-10/30 column (Amersham Bio- sciences; running buffer, 250 mm ammonium acetate; flow, 0.25 ml/min). Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12Lämmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and silver staining. Fractions containing the 35-kDa fragment were pooled and sequenced by automated Edman degradation. Cloning of Silaffin cDNAs—Extraction of poly(A)+ RNA from T. pseudonana and synthesis of a cDNA library coupled to oligo(dT)25 magnetic beads (Dynal, Netherlands) was as described (13Fischer H. Robl., Sumper M. Kröger N. J. Phycol. 1999; 35: 113-120Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This li- brary was used for all PCRs described in the following. The N-terminal amino acid sequences LPGLXEMXXISXXEDHYFFG from HF-treated tpSil1L and EGHGGDHSISM from HF-treated tpSil3 were used to identify corresponding gene models in the T. pseudonana genome data base.2 For amplification of the 3′-ends of the corresponding cDNAs, two nested PCRs were performed using gene-specific sense primers accord- ing to the genome sequences and the antisense primers 5′-GCC GCC GAA TTC CCA G(T)18-3′ for the first PCR and 5′-GCC GCC GAA TTC CCA GTT-3′ for the second PCR. Gene-specific sense primers for am- plifying the 3′-end of the tpSil1 cDNA were 5′-GAA ATG CCT ACT ATA TCG CC-3′ (first PCR) and 5′-ACT ATA TCG CCC ACC GAA GA-3′ (second PCR); gene-specific sense primers for amplifying the 3′-end of the tpSil3 cDNA were 5′-GAA GGA CAT GGG GGA GAT CAC-3′ (first PCR) and 5′-ATG GGG GAG ATC ACT CCA TC-3′ (second PCR). To prepare for 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR, the cDNA library coupled to the magnetic beads was resuspended in terminal deoxynucle- otidyltransferase buffer, 2 mm dCTP, 30 units of terminal deoxynucle- otidyltransferase (Fermentas) and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by heat inactivation at 70 °C for 10 min. To amplify the 5′-ends of the tpSil1, tpSil2, and tpSil3 cDNAs, two nested PCRs were performed using gene-specific antisense primers covering the N-terminal amino acid sequences of tpSil1L, tpSil2L, and tpSil3, respectively, and the sense primers 5′-GGC CAC GCG TCG ACT AGT ACG GGI IGG GII GGG IIG-3′ for the first PCR and 5′-GGC CAC GCG TCG ACT AGT AC-3′ for the second PCR. Gene-specific antisense primers for amplification of the 5′-end of tpSil1 and tpSil2 cDNAs were 5′-TTC GGT GGG CGA TAT AGT AG-3′ (first PCR) and 5′-CGA TAT AGT AGG CAT TTC AG-3′ (second PCR). Gene-specific antisense prim- ers for amplifying the 5′ end of tpSil3 cDNA were 5′-CAT GGA GAT GGA GTG ATC TC-3′ (first PCR) and 5′-GAT GGA GTG ATC TCC CCC ATG-3′ (second PCR). To identify full-length tpSil1 and tpSil2 cDNAs, reverse transcription-PCRs were performed using sense primer 5′-ATG AAA GTT ACC ACG TCA ATC-3′ and antisense primer 5′-CTC AAT TCA GAA AGA AGG AC-3′. All PCR products were ligated into the pGEMT vector (Promega) and sequenced. Amino Acid Analysis—Determination of amino acid composition was performed as described previously (5Poulsen N. Sumper M. Kröger N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12075-12080Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). To estimate silaffin concentra- tions the molar amount of serine was determined relative to a standard, assuming the presence of 20, 90, and 40 serine residues in tpSil1/2L, tpSil1/2H, and tpSil3, respectively. Mass Spectroscopy—The molecular mass and fragmentation pattern of amino acid derivatives (phenylthiocarbamoyl (PTC) dihydroxypro- line, modified lysines) were analyzed using on an Ion Trap ESQUIRE LC instrument (Bruker). Samples were infused by a nanospray source in 0.5% acetic acid, 50% acetonitrile. LCPA were analyzed on a single quadrupole instrument (SSQ 7000, Finnigan) infusing samples with 1 mm ammonium acetate, 50% acetonitrile. Dynamic Light Scattering—Determination of the sizes of silaffin-LCPA assemblies was performed in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, using the HPPS 5001 system (Malvern). A characteristic feature of C. fusiformis silaffins is their tight association with the cell wall, and therefore, they are only solubilized by completely dissolving the silica (4Kröger N. Lorenz S. Brunner E. Sumper M. Science. 2002; 298: 584-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 14Kröger N. Deutzmann R. Sumper M. Science. 1999; 286: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). In search of silaffins in T. pseudonana, SDS/EDTA-extracted biosilica was dissolved in an ammonium fluoride solution, pH 4, and the extract was fractionated by ion exchange and gel permeation chromatography (Fig. 2, A and B). This procedure led to three fractions containing seemingly homogenous components of 20 and 85 kDa (Fig. 2C), which represent the major silaffins of T. pseudonana. Further analysis revealed that only fraction 1 contained a pure silaffin, which was termed tpSil3, whereas fractions 2 and 3 each represented mixtures of two highly homologous silaffins. For reasons that will be outlined below, the silaffins of fraction 3 were termed tpSil1L and tpSil2L (collectively tpSil1/2L; L denotes “low molecular mass iso- form”), and the silaffins of fraction 2 were termed tpSil1H and tpSil2H (collectively tpSil1/2H; H denotes “high molecular mass isoform”). The T. pseudonana silaffins are highly acidic phosphoproteins that are glycosylated and sulfated (Table I), thus resembling natSil2 from C. fusiformis (5Poulsen N. Sumper M. Kröger N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12075-12080Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar).Table IChemical characteristics of T. pseudonana silaffins GlcUA, glucuronic acid; Rhm, rhamnose. The number next to each monosaccharide indicates its relative abundance. In addition to the monosaccharides listed, each silaffin contains at least two unidentified monosaccharides. Silaffin concentrations were estimated according to serine content after complete acid hydrolysis (6 m HCl, 10 °C, 24 h). The isoelectric points (pI) were determined by two-dimensional PAGE.tpSil1/2LtpSil1/2HtpSil3Man6Man5Man1Gal7Gal4Gal9Glc1Glc1Glc3GlcUA9Carbohydrate compositionGlcN3GlcN2Rhm2Rhm2Fuc4Fuc3Xyl5Xyl3Carbohydrate/protein (μg/nmol)40440110Sulfate/protein (mol/mol)203020Phosphate/protein (mol/mol)503550pI≤33–4.5≤3 Open table in a new tab The ammonium fluoride extract of T. pseudonana biosilica also contained LCPA ranging in molecular mass from 501.8 to 741.4 Da, which corresponds to methylated derivatives of 6–9 propyleneimine units attached to a putrescine residue (Fig. 3). The T. pseudonana LCPA are relatively short polyamine chains as compared with LCPA from other diatom species, which may carry up to 20 propyleneimine units (7Kröger N. Deutzmann R. Bergsdorf C. Sumper M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14133-14138Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 15Sumper M. Science. 2002; 295: 2430-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The silica-forming properties of silaffins and LCPA from T. pseudonana were investigated in vitro using a freshly prepared silicic acid solution buffered to pH 5.5 by sodium acetate. In this system neither LCPA nor any of the three T. pseudonana silaffins alone was able to induce silica for- mation, yet mixtures of LCPA and silaffins exhibit silica- forming activity. This is consistent with previous observa- tions demonstrating that supramolecular assemblies of polyamines and polyvalent anions lead to rapid silica precip- itation (5Poulsen N. Sumper M. Kröger N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12075-12080Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 16Sumper M. Lorenz S. Brunner E. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2003; 42: 5192-5195Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 17Brunner E. Lutz L. Sumper M. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2004; 6: 854-857Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when the silica precipitation activities were analyzed as a function of the silaffin concen- tration in the presence of a constant amount of LCPA, the result was markedly different for each silaffin-LCPA assem- bly (Fig. 4). The activity of tpSil1/2L-LCPA assemblies steadily increased with increasing silaffin concentrations, reaching a plateau value (325 ± 19 mm silica at ≥60 μm tpSil1/2L). In contrast, tpSil1/2H and tpSil3 exhibited both activating and inhibiting effects, and thus, like silaffin nat- Sil2 from C. fusiformis, represent regulators of silica forma- tion (5Poulsen N. Sumper M. Kröger N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12075-12080Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The inhibiting effect of tpSil1/2H was stronger than that of tpSil3 because tpSil1/2H-LCPA assemblies were un- able to precipitate silica already at tpSil1/2H concentrations as low as 20 μm, whereas in the tpSil3-LCPA system tpSil3 concentrations had to be raised to >80 μm to completely inhibit silica precipitation. Furthermore, the T. pseudonana silaffins exhibited clearly distinct effects on silica morpho- genesis (Fig. 5). Mixtures of tpSil1/2L and LCPA directed the formation of spherical silica particles at all silaffin concen- trations (Fig. 5A). The diameters of the spheres increased with increasing silaffin concentrations yielding 230 ± 25 nm at 10 μm tpSil1/2L and up to 2.6 ± 1.7 μm at 100 μm tpSil1/2L. In contrast, tpSil1/2H-LCPA mixtures produced porous sheets of silica. The pores were irregularly arranged and exhibited non-uniform shapes, and their sizes ranged from 20 to 200 nm (Fig. 5B). Mixtures of tpSil3 and LCPA were able to simultaneously produce two very different silica struc- tures; that is plates of densely packed, extremely small silica particles and large, polydisperse silica spheres ranging from 900 nm to 4.2 μm in diameter (Fig. 5, C and D). When tpSil3 was applied in concentrations up to 40 μm the silica plates displayed a relatively constant thickness of 500 nm, and the length of plate edges was on the order of tens of micrometers. The proportion of silica spheres in the precipitate decreased with increasing silaffin concentration and ceased at around 40 μm tpSil1/2L. At higher silaffin concentrations, when sil- ica deposition was strongly reduced, very thin silica plates were produced (<50 nm thickness) that were easily damaged by the electron beam during scanning electron microcopy.Fig. 5Silica morphogenesis by silaffin-LCPA mixtures (scan- ning electron microscopy analysis). Experiments were performed in the presence of a constant concentration of T. pseudonana LCPA (0.75 μg/μl). A,20 μm tpSil1/2L (bar = 1 μm); B, 3.5 μm tpSil1/2H (bar = 0.5 μm); C, 20 μm tpSil3 (bar = 10 μm); D, 30 μm tpSil3 (bar = 1 μm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Previously, it has been demonstrated that mixtures of mul- tivalent inorganic anions (e.g. phosphate) and LCPA mediate the formation of silica spheres with diameters ranging from 50 to 900 nm (7Kröger N. Deutzmann R. Bergsdorf C. Sumper M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14133-14138Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 16Sumper M. Lorenz S. Brunner E. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2003; 42: 5192-5195Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). This is also the case with T. pseudonana LCPA. 3N. Poulsen and N. Kröger, unpublished observation. Therefore, morphogenesis of the spherical silica parti- cles by tpSil1/2L-LCPA mixtures appears to be determined by the properties of LCPA, with tpSil1/2L playing a rather minor role, merely providing a high density of negative charges, al- lowing the formation of extremely large silica spheres at low polyanion concentration. In contrast, tpSil1/2H and tpSil3 are able to override the influence of LCPA on silica morphogenesis inducing the formation of flat silica structures. A similar effect has previously been observed using mixtures of the polycationic R5 peptide (19 amino acids) and inorganic phosphate. In this system silica structures shifted from spherical to sheet-like, if high concentrations of polyhydroxy compounds (60% glycerol or 60% sucrose) were added (18Naik R.R. Whitlock P.W. Rodriguez F.

The molecular mechanism of this effect is unclear, yet it is in accordance with the fact that tpSil1/2H and tpSil3 are much more highly glycosylated than tpSil1/2L (see Table I). Dynamic light scattering revealed that mixtures of LCPA with tpSil1/2H and tpSil3, respectively, cre- ate much larger supramolecular assemblies (diameters >5 μm) than mixtures of LCPA and tpSil1/2L (diameter <200 nm). Therefore, the large silica structures formed in the presence of tpSil1/2H and tpSil3, respectively, relate to the large sizes of the corresponding supramolecular silaffin-LCPA assemblies. The Polypeptide Sequences of tpSil3, tpSil1L, and tpSil2L— It is reasonable to assume that the distinct influence of silaffins on silica formation is a consequence of differences in their molecular architectures. To elucidate this correlation the com- plex chemical structures of silaffins need to be determined, and this difficult task requires knowledge of their polypeptide se- quences. So far, the gene sil1 from C. fusiformis, which encodes natSil1A and natSil1B peptides (14Kröger N. Deutzmann R. Sumper M. Science. 1999; 286: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar), has been the only known silaffin gene. Because of the extremely high number of modified amino acids, hardly any sequence information could be ob- tained from other silaffins, thus preventing cloning of the cor- responding genes by PCR and DNA library screening (5Poulsen N. Sumper M. Kröger N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12075-12080Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). How- ever, in the case of T. pseudonana the situation is greatly simplified by the availability of the complete genome se- quence.2 To obtain amino acid sequence information tpSil1/2L, tpSil1/2H and tpSil3 were treated with anhydrous HF to re- move all carbohydrate, phosphate, and sulfate moieties and then subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing. The se- quence obtained from HF-treated tpSil3 (EGHGGDHSISM) perfectly matched a gene model in the T. pseudonana genome data base. Using the genome sequence information, the com- plete cDNA sequence (termed tpSil3) was obtained by overlap- ping 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR. The corresponding polypeptide tpSil3p (p denotes “precursor”) con- tains an N-terminal signal peptide (amino acids 1–17) for co- translational import into the endoplasmic reticulum (19Nielsen H. Engelbrecht H. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4942) Google Scholar) fol- lowed by a nine-amino acid pro-peptide preceding the N-terminal sequence of tpSil3 (Fig. 6A). The predicted molec- ular mass of the mature polypeptide is 21.2 kDa, which is considerably smaller than the 35-kDa apparent molecular mass of HF-treated tpSil3 (see Fig. 2). This difference results from the presence of HF-resistant posttranslational modifica- tions in tpSil3 (see below). The polypeptide backbone exhibits no repetitive sequence domains, and the three most abundant amino acids, serine (19.0%), alanine (16.5%), and lysine (16.1%), are evenly distributed within the polypeptide chain (Fig. 6A). HF treatment of tpSil1/2L resulted in two bands on SDS-PAGE (see Fig. 2) that exhibited similar N-terminal sequences (upper band, LPGLXEMXXISXXEDHYFFG; lower band, LPGXNEMXXISXTE; X is an unidentified amino acid). This demonstrated that tpSil1/2L is a mixture of two homologous proteins that were termed tpSil1L for the protein of slightly higher molecular mass and tpSil2L. The N-terminal sequence of HF-treated tpSil1L was used to search the T. pseudonana data base, and a matching gene model was identified. Again, sequence information from the gene model was used to deter- mine the corresponding cDNA sequence by overlapping 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCRs. This analysis re- vealed two highly homologous, full-length cDNAs (97% nucle- otide sequence identity), termed tpSil1 and tpSil2, which cover the N-terminal sequences of tpSil1L and tpSil2L, respectively. Surprisingly, the T. pseudonana genome data base contains only one corresponding gene (2424 bp containing 9 introns) with the coding sequence representing a mixture of the tpSil1 and tpSil2 cDNA sequences. This phenomenon is explicable by assuming that the genome sequence has been artificially cre- ated in the computer-based assembly of partial sequences from tpSil1 and tpSil2 genes due to the high homology and repetitive nature of their sequences. The translated polypeptides tpSil1p and tpSil2p (Fig. 6B) carry N-terminal signal peptides of 18 amino acids and exhibit 91% amino acid sequence identity. Each polypeptide is made up of two domains; that is, an acidic N-terminal domain (pI = 4.3) rich in serine (20%), proline (17%), and threonine (15%) residues (tpSil1p, amino acids 19–398; tpSil2p, amino acids 19–385) and a strongly basic C-terminal domain (pI = 10.7) that retains the predominance of serine (19%) but in which the amounts of proline (5%) and threonine (5%) are markedly reduced. The N-terminal domains of tpSil1p and tpSil2p become cleaved off during biog"

Because Aβ peptides are thought to be causative for Alzheimer's disease, inhibiting γ-secretase represents a potential treatment for this neurodegenerative condition. Whereas inhibitors directed at the active center of γ-secretase inhibit the cleavage of all its substrates, certain non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been shown to selectively reduce the production of the more amyloidogenic Aβ(1–42) peptide without inhibiting alternative cleavages. In contrast to the majority of previous studies, however, we demonstrate that in cell-free systems the mode of action of selected NSAIDs and their derivatives, depending on the concentrations used, can either be classified as modulatory or inhibitory. At modulatory concentrations, a selective and, with respect to the substrate, noncompetitive inhibition of Aβ(1–42) production was observed. At inhibitory concentrations, on the other hand, biochemical readouts reminiscent of a nonselective γ-secretase inhibition were obtained. When these compounds were analyzed for their ability to displace a radiolabeled, transition-state analog inhibitor from solubilized enzyme, noncompetitive antagonism was observed. The allosteric nature of radioligand displacement suggests that NSAID-like inhibitors change the conformation of the γ-secretase enzyme complex by binding to a novel site, which is discrete from the binding site for transition-state analogs and therefore distinct from the catalytic center. Consequently, drug discovery efforts aimed at this site may identify novel allosteric inhibitors that could benefit from a wider window for inhibition of γ (42)-cleavage over alternative cleavages in the β-amyloid precursor protein and, more importantly, alternative substrates. γ-Secretase is a multi-component enzyme complex that performs an intramembranous cleavage, releasing amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides from processing intermediates of the β-amyloid precursor protein.

This C-terminally elongated Aβ peptide is more prone to aggregation than the shorter and more abundant Aβ(1–40) species. Consequently, the prevention of Aβ production by inhibiting either of the proteases required for processing of βAPP is currently viewed as a promising approach toward a therapy for AD.

To determine the underlying mechanism of this selective inhibition, we have profiled representative NSAID-like compounds in biochemical assays monitoring various aspects of γ-secretase enzyme function.

A solution of FMOC-4,5-dehydro-Leu-OH (0.50 g), l-phenylalaninamide, 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (0.32 g), and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate (0.23 g) in N,N-dimethylformamide (5 ml) was stirred at room temperature for 2 h. The reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate, washed with aqueous citric acid, aqueous sodium bicarbonate and brine, dried (MgSO4), filtered, and evaporated in vacuo. The resulting solid was treated with 50% piperidine-N,N-dimethylformamide solution, stirred for 10 min, and then evaporated in vacuo. A portion of the resulting amine (253 mg) was treated with 2R-benzyl-5S-tert-butoxycarbonylamino-4R-(tert-butyldimethylsilanyloxy)-6-phenyl-hexanoic acid (33Nadin A. Sanchez Lopez J.M. Neduvelil J.G.

The reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate, washed with aqueous citric acid, aqueous sodium bicarbonate and brine, dried (MgSO4), filtered, and evaporated in vacuo. Purification by column chromatography yielded 550 mg (76%) of the amide as a white solid. A portion of the foregoing amide (250 mg) was treated with tetrabutylammonium fluoride (1.0 m in tetrahydrofuran, 4 ml) and stirred overnight. The reaction mixture was diluted with ether, water, and citric acid solution. The resulting precipitate was collected by filtration, washed with water, ether, and dried to give the alkene (200 mg, 90%). A portion of this compound (3 mg, 4.48 × 10–3 mmol) was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (1 ml) and mixed with 10% palladium on carbon (5 mg). The reaction mixture was degassed thoroughly, cooled to –78 °C, and then stirred with carrier-free tritium gas at room temperature for 2 h. Upon the completion of the reaction, the unreacted tritium gas was removed, and the catalyst was filtered off using a Whatman auto-vial syringeless filter. Any labile tritium in the filtrate was removed by the means of exchanging with absolute ethanol (10 ml), and the solvents were evaporated in vacuo. The residue was subjected to high-performance liquid chromatography purification on Zorbax RX-C8 at 220 nm, eluted with 48% aqueous (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and 52% acetonitrile isocratically in 30 min at 5 ml/min. The combined fractions of high-performance liquid chromatography collection was concentrated by passing through a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge to afford 79.7 mCi of [3H]-Merck A in 10 ml of ethanol (specific activity, 97.2 mCi/mg).

For enzyme kinetic studies, peptide standards containing synthetic human Aβ(1–40) or Aβ(1–42) peptides (California Peptide Research Inc., Nappa Valley, CA) were diluted under the same buffer conditions as the enzyme reaction. Radioligand Binding Assays—All radioligand binding experiments were performed using CHAPSO-solubilized SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma P2 cell membranes prepared as above.

Nonspecific binding was determined for all experiments by adding 600 nm unlabeled Merck A to the reaction, and serial dilutions of the tritiated ligand [3H]-Merck A (50 pm-6 nm final concentration) were used to obtain saturation binding isotherms. Bound ligand was separated from free ligand as described (35Tian G. Ghanekar S.V. Aharony D. Shenvi A.B. Jacobs R.T. Liu X. Greenberg B.D. J. Biol.

After drying of the plates overnight, Microscint 0 scintillant was added, and the plates were read on a Packard Topcount Microplate Scintillation counter. Subsequent data analyses were performed by nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc). Equilibrium dissociation constants (Ki) for competition of [3H]-Merck A binding were determined by incubating serial dilutions of NSAID derivatives in the presence of 1 nm [3H]-Merck A. Ki values were calculated using the Cheng and Prusoff equation (36Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12330) Google Scholar): Ki = IC50 × [1 + (L)/Kd]–1 with IC50 being the concentration of competitor that competes for half of the specific binding, (L) is the free radioligand concentration, and Kd is the equilibrium dissociation constant of the radioligand. To determine the antagonist competitiveness of NSAID-like compounds, [3H]-Merck A dose-response curves were analyzed in the presence of fixed concentrations of these compounds. In Vitro Generation of AICD and Aβ Peptides in Membranes—P2 membranes from SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells overexpressing the γ-secretase substrate precursor SPA4CT (37Dyrks T. Dyrks E. Monning U.

For in vitro generation of βAPP intracellular domain (AICD) and Aβ peptides, 240 μg of membrane protein was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with increasing amounts of NSAID-like compounds as indicated in the figure legends, in 120 μl of 0.5% CHAPSO, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 2 mm EDTA, and 1× EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Me2SO vehicle (0.5% v/v) or 10 μm Merck A was used as a control, and for quantitation of de novo production of Aβ(1–40) and Aβ(1–42) peptide, 0.5 μl and 5 μl aliquots of the corresponding reactions, respectively, were analyzed by an electrochemiluminescence assay as described for the solubilized γ-secretase enzyme assay above. AICD generation in 15 μl of reaction was quantified by Western blot analysis using the antibody R7334 (25Beher D. Wrigley J.D. Nadin A. Evin G. Masters C.L. Harrison T. Castro J.L. Shearman M.S. J.

Primary antibodies were detected with Alexa Fluor 680-conjugated goat antirabbit F(ab′)2 fragments (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and quantified on a LI-COR Odyssey infrared imager (LI-COR Biosciences Inc., Lincoln, NE). Surface-enhanced Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry—Immunocapture of Aβ peptides generated in the solubilized enzyme assay from recombinant C100Flag substrate was performed analogous to methods described previously using monoclonal antibodies 6E10 or W0-2 (10Beher D. Wrigley J.D. Owens A.P. Shearman M.S. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 563-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, after incubation for 90 min at 37 °C, 2.5 ml of the in vitro γ-secretase reaction was adjusted to 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.3 (10 ml final volume). After centrifugation for 10 min at 4,000 × g, the supernatant was incubated overnight at 4 °C with the antibody-coupled surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization protein chip (Ciphergen Biosystems, Fremont, CA), which was processed for surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (10Beher D.

Selected NSAID-like Compounds Act as Noncompetitive Inhibitors of Aβ Peptide Formation—To profile the NSAID sulindac sulfide and the NSAID-like derivative R-flurbiprofen for their inhibitory potential toward γ-secretase enzyme activity, we evaluated these compounds in an exogenous substrate enzyme assay (16Li Y.M. Xu M. Lai M.T. Huang Q. Castro J.L. DiMuzio-Mower J. Harrison T. Lellis C. Nadin A. Neduvelil J.G. Register R.B. Sardana M.K. Shearman M.S. Smith A.L. Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Nature. 2000; 405: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). Because the assay uses CHAPSO-solubilized membranes from human neuroblastoma cells as a source of enzyme and a recombinant C100Flag substrate, it allows a direct examination of the effects of compounds on enzyme catalysis. Furthermore, the cell-free nature of the assay allowed the use of these compounds at higher concentrations (>100 to 300 μm), where normally decreased cell viability would be observed. 2J. Wrigley, unpublished observation. Sulindac analogs were chosen because sulindac sulfide, but not its close analog sulindac sulfone (serving as a less potent control; data not shown), has been described to selectively lower Aβ(1–42) production in cells (29Weggen S. Eriksen J.L. Das P. Sagi S.A. Wang R. Pietrzik C.U. Findlay K.A. Smith T.E. Murphy M.P. Bulter T. Kang D.E. Marquez-Sterling N. Golde T.E. Koo E.H. Nature. 2001; 414: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). R-Flurbiprofen, the cyclooxygenase-inactive enantiomer of the NSAID S-flurbiprofen, was chosen as a structurally distinct agent described to selectively lower Aβ(1–42) production (38Morihara T. Chu T. Ubeda O. Beech W. Cole G.M. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 1009-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 39Eriksen J.L. Sagi S.A. Smith T.E. Weggen S. Das P. McLendon D.C. Ozols V.V. Jessing K.W. Zavitz K.H. Koo E.H. Golde T.E. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 440-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Both sulindac sulfide and R-flurbiprofen inhibit γ(42)-secretase activity (Fig. 1, A and B) with IC50 values of 34 and 307 μm, respectively. At higher concentrations, inhibition of γ(40) activity was also observed, however, which suggests that these compounds produce a full γ-secretase inhibition. That appears to be distinct mechanistically from the selective modulation of Aβ(1–42) production observed at lower concentrations. To investigate the mode of inhibitor action, enzyme kinetic analyses were performed with R-flurbiprofen (Fig. 1, C–E). The data from these studies revealed that the inhibition of both γ(42) and γ(40) activities cannot be overcome by increasing the substrate concentration in the assay. The Vmax for both γ(42)- and γ(40)-secretase activities were considerably decreased (the latter one at the highest concentration used; Fig. 1C) in the presence of increasing concentrations of R-flurbiprofen (Fig. 1, C and D). This is confirmed by Lineweaver-Burk transformation of the R-flurbiprofen Aβ(1–42) inhibition curve (Fig. 1E), which reveals a change in Vmax without affecting the Km. In accordance with Takahashi and colleagues (40Takahashi Y. Hayashi I. Tominari Y. Rikimaru K. Morohashi Y. Kan T. Natsugari H. Fukuyama T. Tomita T. Iwatsubo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18664-18670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), similar results were obtained for sulindac sulfide (supplementary information). Such a mode of noncompetitive inhibition with respect to substrate has been observed previously for structurally diverse γ-secretase inhibitors resembling aspartyl protease transition state analogs or other small molecules (41Tian G. Sobotka-Briner C.D. Zysk J. Liu X. Birr C. Sylvester M.A. Edwards P.D. Scott C.D. Greenberg B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31499-31505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Combined, this suggests that both NSAID-like inhibitors and prototypical γ-secretase inhibitors, such as the transition state analog inhibitor L-685,458, target a site independent of the substrate binding site of the enzyme. Inhibitor Profile of NSAID-like Compounds Mimics That of γ-Secretase Inhibition—γ-Secretase cleavage of βAPP-derived substrates results in the production of various C-terminally truncated Aβ peptides (9Wang R.

To investigate whether the inhibition of Aβ(1–40) production observed in the cell-free enzyme assay (Fig. 1, A and B) is accompanied by an inhibition of the production of all Aβ peptide species, we performed mass spectrometric analyses of the recombinant substrate enzyme reactions (Fig. 2).

https://openalex.org/W2126445987,"The urate-anion exchanger URAT1 is a member of the organic anion transporter (OAT) family that regulates blood urate level in humans and is targeted by uricosuric and antiuricosuric agents (Enomoto, A., Kimura, H., Chairoungdua, A., Shigeta, Y., Jutabha, P., Cha, S.

URAT1 is expressed only in the kidney, where it is thought to participate in tubular urate reabsorption. We found that the multivalent PDZ (PSD-95, Drosophila discs-large protein, Zonula occludens protein 1) domain-containing protein, PDZK1 interacts with URAT1 in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Such an interaction requires the PDZ motif of URAT1 in its extreme intracellular C-terminal region and the first, second, and fourth PDZ domains of PDZK1 as identified by yeast two-hybrid assay, in vitro binding assay and surface plasmon resonance analysis (KD = 1.97–514 nm). Coimmunoprecipitation studies revealed that the wild-type URAT1, but not its mutant lacking the PDZ-motif, directly interacts with PDZK1. Colocalization of URAT1 and PDZK1 was observed at the apical membrane of renal proximal tubular cells. The association of URAT1 with PDZK1 enhanced urate transport activities in HEK293 cells (1.4-fold), and the deletion of the URAT1 C-terminal PDZ motif abolished this effect. The augmentation of the transport activity was accompanied by a significant increase in the Vmax of urate transport via URAT1 and was associated with the increased surface expression level of URAT1 protein from HEK293 cells stably expressing URAT1 transfected with PDZK1. Taken together, the present study indicates the novel role of PDZK1 in regulating the functional activity of URAT1-mediated urate transport in the apical membrane of renal proximal tubules. The urate-anion exchanger URAT1 is a member of the organic anion transporter (OAT) family that regulates blood urate level in humans and is targeted by uricosuric and antiuricosuric agents (Enomoto, A., Kimura, H., Chairoungdua, A., Shigeta, Y., Jutabha, P., Cha, S.

Taken together, the present study indicates the novel role of PDZK1 in regulating the functional activity of URAT1-mediated urate transport in the apical membrane of renal proximal tubules. Urate is the major inert end product of purine degradation in humans and higher primates in contrast to most other mammals because of the genetic silencing of hepatic oxidative enzyme uricase (1Roch-Ramel F. Guisan B. News Physiol. Sci. 1999; 14: 80-84PubMed Google Scholar, 2Sica D.A. Schoolwerth A.C. Brenner B.M. The Kidney. 6th Ed. Saunders, Philadelphia2000: 680-700Google Scholar). The kidney plays a dominant role in urate elimination; it excretes ∼70% of the daily urate production. Urate exists primarily as a weak acid at physiological pH (pKa 5.75), and most of it is dissociated in blood and is freely filtered through the glomerulus. Thus, urate enters the proximal tubule in its anionic form, but it hardly permeates the tubular cells in the absence of facilitated mechanisms owing to its hydrophilicity. The transport mechanisms for urate are localized in the proximal tubule. In humans, urate is almost completely reabsorbed, which results in the excretion of ∼10% of its filtered load. The absence of uricase and the presence of an effective renal urate reabsorption system contribute to higher blood urate levels in humans. Therefore, it was postulated that defects in tubular urate transport cause hypouricemia and decreased renal urate clearance leads to hyperuricemia in most hyperuricemic patients (3Maesaka J.K. Fishbane S. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1998; 32: 917-933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Recently, we have identified the long hypothesized urate transporter in the human kidney (URAT1, 1The abbreviations used are: URAT1, urate-anion exchanger 1; OAT, organic anion transporter; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PDZ, PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 homology domain; NHERF, Na+/H+-exchanger regulatory factor; CT, C terminus; wt, wild type; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HEK, human embryonic kidney; MBP, maltose binding protein; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; IKEPP, intestinal and kidney-enriched PDZ protein.1The abbreviations used are: URAT1, urate-anion exchanger 1; OAT, organic anion transporter; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PDZ, PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 homology domain; NHERF, Na+/H+-exchanger regulatory factor; CT, C terminus; wt, wild type; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HEK, human embryonic kidney; MBP, maltose binding protein; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; IKEPP, intestinal and kidney-enriched PDZ protein. encoded by SLC22A12), a urate-anion exchanger localized on the apical side of the proximal tubule (4Enomoto A. Kimura H. Chairoungdua A. Shigeta Y. Jutabha P. Cha S.H. Hosoyamada M. Takeda M. Sekine T. Igarashi T. Matsuo H. Kikuchi Y. Oda T. Ichida K. Hosoya T. Shimotaka K. Niwa T. Kanai Y. Endou H. Nature. 2002; 417: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). URAT1 is targeted by uricosuric and antiuricosuric agents that affect urate excretion (e.g. benzbromarone, probenecid, and pyrazinamide). The pharmacological properties manifested by URAT1 cRNA-injected Xenopus oocytes are consistent with those of the previously described urate transport activities in human brush-border membrane vesicles. We also found that defects in SLC22A12 lead to idiopathic renal hypouricemia (Mendelian Inheritance in Man number 220150), and patients with such defects show a high fractional urate excretion such as 95 ± 10% (normally <10%). These results indicate that URAT1 regulates blood urate level and vice versa, that is, to control blood urate levels, the URAT1 transport function should be regulated. A newly found genetic alteration in SLC22A12 from a patient of an idiopathic renal hypouricemia has prompted us to consider the importance of the URAT1 extreme intracellular C-terminal region for its function (5Ichida K. Hosoyamada M. Hisatome I. Enomoto A. Hikita M. Endou H. Hosoya T. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2004; 15: 164-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). A 5-bp deletion near the URAT1 C-terminal end (1639–1643del) causes frameshift, and the seven amino acids in the terminal sequences have changed into eight different amino acids. The URAT1 transport activity of this mutation is low in the Xenopus oocyte expression system. Interestingly, the PDZ binding motif at the C-terminal end of URAT1, which is known to participate in protein-protein interaction, disappears by this amino acid sequence modification. PDZ (PSD-95, DglA, and ZO-1)-binding domains have been identified in various proteins and are known to be modular protein-protein recognition domains that play a role in protein targeting and protein complex assembly (6Hung A.Y.

These domains range from 80 to 90 amino acids in length and bind typically to proteins containing the tripeptide motif (S/T)XΦ (X = any amino acid and Φ = a hydrophobic residue) at their C termini (9Harris B.Z.

The disruption of the association between PDZ proteins and their targets contributes to the pathogenesis of a number of human diseases, most probably because of the failure of PDZ proteins to appropriately target and modulate the actions of associated proteins (6Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). In this study, we use the yeast two-hybrid approach to investigate the putative URAT1-associated proteins that modulate its transport function. We identify the multivalent PDZ domain-containing protein PDZK1 as an apparent partner of URAT1 in the human kidney. Moreover, we show a functional consequence of PDZK1-URAT1 interaction in transfected HEK293 cells, where URAT1 transport activities were increased by 1.4-fold by coexpression of PDZK1. We speculate that PDZK1 is a scaffolding protein that may be a physiological regulator of the function of URAT1. Plasmid Construction—The C-terminal fragments of human URAT1 cDNA, comprising three mutants (designated as d3, F555A, and T553A), were generated by PCR (antisense primers, 5′-CTC TCG AGC TAA AAC TGT GTG GAT TTT A-3′, 5′-CCC TCG AGC TAG GAT TTT AGG ACA GAG TTC-3′, 5′-CCC TCG AGC TAA GCC TGT GTG GAT TTT AGG A-3′, and 5′-CCC TCG AGC TAA AAC TGT GCG GAT TTT A-3′, respectively; sense primer, 5′-CGA ATT CCT GCC CGA GAC CCA GAG-3′) and inserted into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the pEG202 plasmid, a LexA DNA-binding domain fusion vector. The same human URAT1 C-terminal fragments were also inserted into the pGEX-6P-1 plasmid (Amersham Biosciences) for GST fusion protein production. The full-length coding sequences of human URAT1 (wt) as well as its C-terminal 3-amino acid deletion mutants (d3) were inserted into the mammalian expression plasmid pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) for functional analysis and into the pEGFP-C2 plasmid for EGFP-URAT1 (Clontech) fusion protein preparation. The full-length coding sequence of human PDZK1 (GenBank™ accession number NM_002614) was amplified from the Cap-site human kidney cDNA (Nippongene, Japan) and subcloned into pcDNA3.1, into the pJG4-5 plasmid and a B42 activation domain fusion vector. Prey vectors (pJG4-5 and pMAL-c2X (New England Biolabs) for MBP fusion protein preparation) containing a single one PDZ domain of human PDZK1 were generated by PCR (PDZ1: sense primer, 5′-CTG CAA TTG ATG ACC TCC ACC TTC AAC-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-CCC TCG AGC TAC TTC TGA CTT TGA CCC A-3′; PDZ2: sense primer, 5′-CGA ATT CCA GAA GGA GCA AGG TTT G-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-CCC TCG AGC TAT TTC AAA CTG GCT TC-3′; PDZ3: sense primer, 5′-CGA ATT CAA GCG TCA TGT TGA GCA G-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-CCC TCG AGC TAA GAA GTG GGA GTA GGA GC-3′; PDZ4: sense primer, 5′-CGA ATT CAA GGA GGC TCC AGC TCC-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-CGC TCG AGT CAC ATC TCT GTA TCT TC-3′). The sequences of all constructs were confirmed by automatic DNA sequencing (Applied Biosystems 3730xl Sequencer). Library Construction and Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—A human kidney cDNA library was constructed as described previously (11Anzai N. Deval E. Schaefer L. Friend V. Lazdunski M. Lingueglia E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16655-16661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, human kidney poly(A)+ RNA purchased from Clontech was used to produce cDNA using a cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene) with modified oligo(dT) primers carrying an XhoI restriction site and EcoRI adaptors to allow unidirectional cloning in an appropriate vector. The cDNAs were then purified using a CHROMA SPIN-400 column (Clontech) to pool cDNAs of 0.5 kb or longer, and ligated into the pJG4-5 prey vector previously digested with EcoRI and XhoI. After transformation in bacteria, 2.1 × 106 independent clones were obtained. Sixteen clones were randomly picked and digested with EcoRI and XhoI; all of them contained inserts with an average size of 1.3 kb (ranging from 0.5 to more than 3 kb). A URAT1 C-terminal bait corresponding to the last 39 amino acids of URAT1 was used to screen 1.8 × 107 clones of the human kidney cDNA library with the LexA-based GFP two-hybrid system (Grow'n'Glow system; MoBiTec). Several positive clones were obtained and confirmed in a second round of screening using the yeast system. The expression of all the bait constructs in yeast was confirmed by Western blot analysis of yeast protein extracts using an anti-LexA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (data not shown). GST Fusion Protein Binding Assay—The URAT1 intracellular C-terminal region used as bait in the two-hybrid screen was inserted into the pGEX-6P-1 plasmid (Amersham Biosciences) for GST fusion protein production in bacteria as reported previously (11Anzai N. Deval E. Schaefer L. Friend V. Lazdunski M. Lingueglia E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16655-16661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, the bacterial pellet was resuspended in a sonication buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and sonicated for 1 min. Triton X-100 (1% final) was added to the mixture, which was then centrifuged for 30 min at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatant was used for protein binding assay. Maltose binding protein (MBP), fused proteins consisting of PDZK1 individual PDZ domains were purified as described above. Then they were purified using a MagExtracter MBP fusion Protein Purification kit (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In vitro translation was performed from a plasmid carrying the full-length PDZK1 preceded by a T7 promoter sequence with the TnT T7 Quick for PCR DNA system (Promega) in a final volume of 50 μl for 60 min at 30 °C in the presence of Transcend Biotinylated tRNA (Promega). 5 μl each of in vitro-translated products or of MBP fusion proteins was applied together with 50 μl of GST-glutathione-Sepharose resin to Handee Spin Cup columns using the ProFound Pull-Down GST Protein:Protein Interaction kit (Pierce), and protein complexes were eluted according to the manufacturer's instructions. The eluted samples were resuspended in Laemmli buffer, heated for 5 min at 95 °C, and electrophoresed in 10% SDS-PAGE gels; the fractionated proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The precipitated proteins were detected with the Transcend Chemiluminescent Translation Detection System (Promega) or immunoblotting using anti-MBP antiserum (New England Biolabs) developed by enhanced chemiluminescence. Surface Plasmon Resonance—The interaction of URAT1 C terminus with individual PDZ domains of PDZK1 was investigated by the use of a BIAcore 3000 analytical system (BIAcore AB) based on principles described previously (17Malmqvist M. Nature. 1993; 361: 186-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). URAT1 C-terminal fragment, referred to as the ligand, was immobilized on a sensor chip, and the interaction with PDZK1 individual PDZ domains fused with MBP, referred as the analytes, was detected through the mass changes of the reflective index on the sensor surface. All of the reagents such as an amine coupling kit, running buffer HBS-EP (0.01 m HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% Surfactant P20), and the CM5 sensor chip were obtained from BIAcore AB. Using an amine coupling kit, GST-fused URAT1 CT wild-type or GST protein alone was attached to a CM5 sensor chip according to the manufacturer's instructions, giving a gain of 10,673 resonance units for GST-URAT1-CT or 8,566 resonance units for GST alone. Binding experiments were performed with the PDZK1 single one PDZ domains (PDZ1 to PDZ4) fused with MBP as described above. The analyte was injected at a flow rate of 30 μl/min in HBS-EP buffer at 25 °C, and the association and dissociation phases (upon switching back to buffer) were monitored for 120 and 180 s, respectively. For data acquisition, five different concentrations of each protein were used. At least two replicate experiments were performed for each fusion protein. Data were analyzed with the BIAevaluation program 3.2 (BIAcore). Preparation of Antibodies—Corresponding to the 14 amino acids of the N terminus of human PDZK1, rabbit anti-PDZK1 polyclonal antibody raised against the keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated synthesized peptides, MTSTFNPREC (amino acids 1–10 of the human PDZK1 amino acid sequence), was generated. Tissue Distribution—Human Multiple Tissue cDNA Panels I and II were purchased from Clontech. Each sample (1.5 μl) was amplified in 50 μl of the PCR mix consisting of 2.5 units of Taq Polymerase (Promega), 1× reaction buffer, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 200 μm dNTP under the following conditions: 35 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C for URAT1 and PDZK1; only 25 cycles were performed for β-actin. The PCR products (5 μl) were resolved on a 2% agarose gel. The primers used for PCR amplification are as follows: 5′-CTG GCA ACG GAC TGG AGA TTA-3′ (forward primer for hURAT1), 5′-TGT AGT AGC GCA CGG GTT GG-3′ (reverse primer for hURAT1), 5′-GAG GAG AAC TTG GAG GTG TT-3′ (forward primer for hPDZK1), 5′-TTT GTA GGC TGG TGA TGA CT-3′ (reverse primer for hPDZK1), 5′-GAG GAG AAC TTG GAG GTG TT-3′ (forward primer for human β-actin), and 5′-TTT GTA GGC TGG TGA TGA CT-3′ (reverse primer for human β-actin). Immunohistochemical Analysis—The antibodies against human URAT1 used in this study have been shown to be specific for its synthetic peptide, as previously described (4Enomoto A. Kimura H. Chairoungdua A. Shigeta Y. Jutabha P. Cha S.H. Hosoyamada M. Takeda M. Sekine T. Igarashi T. Matsuo H. Kikuchi Y. Oda T. Ichida K. Hosoya T. Shimotaka K. Niwa T. Kanai Y. Endou H. Nature. 2002; 417: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). We used human single-tissue slides (Biochain) for light microscopic immunohistochemical analysis using the streptavidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase complex technique (LSAB kit; DAKO, Carpentaria, CA). Sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and incubated with 3% H2O2 for 10 min to abrogate endogenous peroxidase activity. After rinsing in 0.05 m Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST), the sections were treated with 10 μg/ml primary rabbit polyclonal antibodies against hURAT1 and hPDZK1 (4 °C overnight). Then, the sections were incubated with the secondary antibody, biotinylated goat polyclonal antibody against rabbit immunoglobulin (DAKO), diluted 1:400 for 30 min with horseradish peroxidase-labeled streptavidin. This step was followed by incubation with diaminobenzidine and hydrogen peroxide. The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and examined by light microscopy. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Transient transfection with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. After transfection, the cells were grown 36–48 h before the experiments. For the establishment of URAT1-expressing cells, stable transfectants were selected for 2 weeks by adding 0.5 mg/ml G418 to the medium. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Twenty-four hours after cotransfection, HEK293 cells in 100-mm plates were lysed with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 250 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 0.25% deoxycholate, and protease inhibitor mixture (PIC, Sigma). Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant was collected. 1 μl of the anti-GFP antibody (Full-Length A.v. Polyclonal Antibody, Clontech) was added to the supernatant, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C with continuous gentle shaking. For the coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous URAT1 and PDZK1, we used human kidney membrane fractions (Biochain) and added anti-PDZK1 antibody or control IgG to this solution. Then URAT1 and associated proteins were immunoprecipitated using the Seize Classic (A) Immunoprecipitation kit (Pierce), and protein complexes were eluted according to the manufacturer's instructions. The elution samples were resuspended in SDS sample buffer and heated for 5 min at 100 °C, and proteins were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. The resolved proteins were then electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The affinity-purified rabbit PDZK1 antibody and horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) were used for immunoblotting. Immunoblotting was developed with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (ECL Plus, Amersham Biosciences). Cell Surface Biotinylation—Surface biotinylation of URAT1 at the plasma membrane was performed as described Huh et al. (18Huh K.-H. Wenthold R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 151-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) with some modifications. URAT1 stably expressing HEK293 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1(+)-hPDZK1 or pcDNA3.1(+) vector alone were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and surface proteins were biotinylated with Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce, 0.5 mg/ml) in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed with three times with ice-cold PBS containing 50 mm glycine to remove non-reacted chemicals. Cells were harvested, spun at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 4 min to pellet insoluble material, assessed for protein contents, and adjusted to the same concentration. Cell lysates were then incubated with Ultralink-immobilized NeutrAvidin beads (Pierce) to precipitate biotinylated proteins. The bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting followed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). URAT1 was detected with polyclonal URAT1 antibody (1:5,000) (4Enomoto A. Kimura H. Chairoungdua A. Shigeta Y. Jutabha P. Cha S.H. Hosoyamada M. Takeda M. Sekine T. Igarashi T. Matsuo H. Kikuchi Y. Oda T. Ichida K. Hosoya T. Shimotaka K. Niwa T. Kanai Y. Endou H. Nature. 2002; 417: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). Densitometric analysis was performed using Model DIANA II Imaging System (M&S Instruments Trading Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Urate Transport Activity Assay—HEK293 cells, plated on 24-well culture plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well 24 h prior to transfection, were incubated in LipofectAMINE 2000 as described above. After 36 h, the culture medium was removed, and the cells were incubated in serum- and chloride-free Hanks' balanced salt solution containing the following in mm: 125 sodium gluconate, 4.8 K gluconate, 1.2 KH2PO4, 1.2 MgSO4, 1.3 calcium gluconate, 5.6 glucose, and 25 HEPES, pH 7.4, for 10 min. The uptake study was started by adding HBSS containing [14C]urate to the plate. Because the uptake of urate was linear up to 5 min in transiently transfected cells and up to 2 min in stably transfected cells, the initial uptake was assessed as the uptake for 1 min (data not shown). After 1 min, the cells were washed twice in ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution then lysed in 0.1 n NaOH for 20 min for scintillation counting. For determination of the kinetic parameters, the concentrations of urate were varied from 100 to 1000 μm. URAT1-mediated urate uptake was calculated as the difference between the values of uptake into HEK293 cells stably expressing URAT1 and those of HEK293 cells transfected vector alone. Kinetic parameters were obtained using Equation 1,υ=Vmax×SKm+S(Eq. 1) where v is the uptake rate of the substrate (picomoles/min/mg of protein), S is the substrate concentration in the medium (μm), Km is the Michaelis-Menten constant (μm), and Vmax is the maximum uptake rate (picomoles/min/mg of protein). These values were determined with the Eadie-Hofstee equation. Statistical Analysis—Uptake experiments were conducted three times, and each uptake experiment was performed in triplicate. Values were presented as means ± S.D. Statistical significance was determined by non-paired t tests. Isolation of PDZK1 in Yeast Two-hybrid Genetic Screen—In our search for potential URAT1 binding partners, we used the URAT1 C-terminal tail (URAT1-CT) as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a cDNA library constructed from the human adult kidney. From 1.8 × 107 independent colonies screened, 98 positive clones were obtained. Of these positive clones, 35 yielded an identical sequence encoding some portions of the gene for human PDZK1. PDZK1 is a 519-amino acid protein that contains four PDZ domains (19Kocher O. Comella N. Tognazzi K. Brown L.F. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 117-125PubMed Google Scholar) (GenBank™ accession number NM_002614). The longest clone, 27A, includes PDZ2, PDZ3, and PDZ4 but lacks N-terminal sequences, including half of PDZ1. We could not detect interaction between the URAT1-CT with any other PDZ proteins known to be expressed near the apical membrane of proximal tubules, including NHERF1 and E3KARP (20Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Wang Y. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2143-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 21Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher J. J.

A. 1998; 95: 8496-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). For further experiments, we cloned full-length human PDZK1 by long PCR and subcloned it into a prey vector. The specificity of the interaction between PDZK1 and URAT1-CT was further confirmed by yeast two-hybrid assays. First, we tested the specificity of the interaction between PDZK1 and the C termini of other human OAT proteins. PDZK1 interacted with the C terminus of OAT4 with a different PDZ motif (TSL), but not with those of human OAT1, OAT2, or OAT3 (Fig. 1A) (23Hosoyamada M. Sekine T. Kanai Y. Endou H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F122-F128PubMed Google Scholar, 24Cha S.H. Sekine T. Kusuhara H. Yu E. Kim J.Y. Kim D.K. Sugiyama Y. Kanai Y. Endou H. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 1277-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The C Terminus of URAT1 Is Necessary for the Interaction with PDZK1—To identify the sites in URAT1 that interact with PDZK1, we made three mutant baits. The first one (URAT1-CT-d3) is a bait that lacks the last three residues of URAT1, which are known to play a crucial role in PDZ domain recognition. The second and third ones (F555A and T553A), the extreme C-terminal phenylalanine (0 position) or threonine (–2 position) of URAT1, have been replaced by alanine, which was expected to abolish or strongly suppress the binding of PDZ proteins (10Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). These three baits did not interact with PDZK1 (Fig. 1B). Thus, binding through the C terminus of URAT1 suggests that the PDZ motif of URAT1 is the site of interaction with PDZK1. Domain Analysis of PDZK1 Protein-Protein Interaction with URAT1 C Terminus—PDZK1 possesses four PDZ domains that assemble target proteins by binding to a C-terminal motif with a consensus sequence such as (S/T)XΦ. To determine the possible interactions of the URAT1 C-terminal region with the PDZ domains of PDZK1, we produced prey vectors each containing"
https://openalex.org/W2034037368,"Intraerythrocytic growth of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum requires the catabolism of large amounts of host cell hemoglobin. Endoproteolytic digestion of hemoglobin to short oligopeptides occurs in an acidic organelle called the food vacuole. How amino acids are generated from these peptides is not well understood. To gain insight into this process, we have studied a plasmodial ortholog of the lysosomal exopeptidase cathepsin C. The plasmodial enzyme dipeptidyl aminopeptidase 1 (DPAP1) was enriched from parasite extract by two different approaches and was shown to possess hydrolytic activity against fluorogenic dipeptide substrates. To localize DPAP1 we created a transgenic parasite line expressing a chromosomally encoded DPAP1-green fluorescent protein fusion. Green fluorescent protein fluorescence was observed in the food vacuole of live transgenic parasites, and anti-DPAP1 antibody labeled the food vacuole in parasite cryosections. Together these data implicate DPAP1 in the generation of dipeptides from hemoglobin-derived oligopeptides. To assess the significance of DPAP1, we attempted to ablate DPAP1 activity from blood stage parasites by truncating the chromosomal DPAP1-coding sequence. The inability to disrupt the coding sequence indicates that DPAP1 is important for asexual proliferation. The proenzyme form of DPAP1 was found to accumulate in the parasitophorous vacuole of mature parasites. This observation suggests a trafficking route for DPAP1 through the parasitophorous vacuole to the food vacuole."

These data suggest a role for EL in the development of atherosclerotic vascular disease. To investigate this possibility, LIPG-null alleles were bred onto the apoE knockout background, and the homozygous double knockout animals were characterized. Both apoE knockout and double knockout mice had low HDL cholesterol levels when compared with wild-type mice, but the HDL cholesterol levels of the double knockout mice were higher than those of apoE knockout mice. Atherogenic very low density lipoprotein and intermediate density lipoprotein/low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of the double knockout mice were also greater than those of the apoE knockout animals. Despite this lipid profile, there was a significant ∼70% decrease in atherosclerotic disease area in double knockout mice on a regular diet. Immunohistochemistry and protein blot studies revealed increased EL expression in the atherosclerotic aortas of the apoE knockout animals. An observed decrease in macrophage content in vessels lacking EL correlated with ex vivo vascular monocyte adhesion assays, suggesting that this protein can modulate monocyte adhesion and infiltration into diseased tissues. These data suggest that EL may have indirect atherogenic actions in vivo through its effect on circulating HDL cholesterol and direct atherogenic actions through vascular wall processes such as monocyte recruitment and cholesterol uptake.

These data suggest that EL may have indirect atherogenic actions in vivo through its effect on circulating HDL cholesterol and direct atherogenic actions through vascular wall processes such as monocyte recruitment and cholesterol uptake. It is known that members of the highly conserved lipase family of lipid metabolic enzymes affect vascular disease through regulation of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) 1The abbreviations used are: HDL-C, HDL cholesterol; HDL, high density lipoprotein; LDL, low density lipoprotein; IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein; VLDL, very low density lipoprotein; EL, endothelial lipase; PL, phospholipid; TG, triglyceride; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; WT, wild type. levels, as well as through local actions in the vessel wall. Regulation of HDL-C level is important since serum HDL level is widely accepted as an inverse correlate of coronary heart disease risk (1Gordon D.J. Rifkind B.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 321: 1311-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (1412) Google Scholar, 2Assmann G. Schulte H. von Eckardstein A. Huang Y. Atherosclerosis. 1996; 124: S11-S20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Lipases have been shown to regulate HDL-C through effects on HDL particle size and metabolism (3Jin W. Marchadier D. Rader D.J. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 174-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Further, lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase perform functions in the vessel wall that are independent of their catalytic activity. It is well known that lipases can form a molecular bridge between endothelial cells and lipoproteins or circulating macrophages through interaction with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (4Goldberg I.J. Merkel M. Front. Biosci. 2001; 6: D388-D405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This nonenzymatic action of lipases can increase cellular lipoprotein uptake and monocyte adhesion. For instance, the local expression of lipoprotein lipase in the vascular wall has been implicated in the local trapping of lipid and acceleration of atherosclerosis through this bridging function (5Babaev V.R. Fazio S. Gleaves L.A. Carter K.J. Semenkovich C.F. Linton M.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1697-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). To further investigate the genetic basis of HDL-C level and the modulation of atherosclerosis by lipases, recent studies have focused on a new member of the lipase gene family termed endothelial lipase (EL) (gene nomenclature LIPG, locus link I.D. 16891) (6Hirata K.

Further, association-based human genetic studies have provided evidence that variation in the LIPG locus is linked to differences in circulating HDL-C levels (10Ma K. Cilingiroglu M. Otvos J.D.

Because of its significant effect on HDL levels and the documented association of other lipase family members with atherosclerosis, it seemed possible that EL might also play a role in atherogenesis. Here we report studies confirming this hypothesis by showing that apoE knockout animals, which also are targeted in the LIPG locus, have decreased atherosclerosis. Animal Preparation—Homozygous apoE-/- mice with C57BL/6J background were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine) and bred to EL knockout (LIPG-/-) mice on a C57BL/6J background to generate LIPG-/-, apoE-/- double knockout mice (9Ishida T.

PCR was performed for genotyping the apoE locus (16Piedrahita J.A. Zhang S.H. Hagaman J.R. Oliver P.M. Maeda N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

ApoE-/- mice and LIPG-/-, apoE-/- mice were weaned at 4 weeks of age onto a high fat diet (0.15% cholesterol, 21% milk fat, 19.5% casein) or normal chow diet and maintained on the diet for 12 weeks. Wild-type (WT) and LIPG-/- mice were used as control groups. All animal experiments were conducted according to the Guidelines for Animal Experiments at the Stanford University School of Medicine. Histological Analysis of Atherosclerotic Lesions—The apoE-/- and LIPG-/-, apoE-/- mice were euthanized at the age of 16 weeks (12 weeks on the chow diet or high fat diet), and the atherosclerotic lesions were analyzed as described previously (17Ozaki M.

The aortic samples were fixed in 10% buffered formalin phosphate, embedded in OCT compound, and sectioned (10 μm thickness). Five consecutive sections, spanning 550 μm of the aortic root, were collected from each mouse and stained with Sudan III or Masson's trichrome. For quantitative analysis of atherosclerosis, the total lesion area of five sections from each mouse was measured with the NIH Image 1.61 software by modifying the method reported previously (18Paigen B. Morrow A. Holmes P.A. Mitchell D. Williams R.A. Atherosclerosis. 1987; 68: 231-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar).

Analysis of Plasma Lipids—Following an overnight fast, whole blood was collected by cardiac puncture into tubes containing 0.3 mg of EDTA. Plasma was collected by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Total plasma cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), and phospholipid (PL) levels were measured as described (9Ishida T. Choi S.

Western blots and immunohistochemical analysis for EL in the vessel wall were performed using an anti-mouse EL antibody (generous gift from Dr. Daniel J. Rader, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). Ex Vivo Adhesion Assay—Ex vivo adhesion assays were performed as described (20Tsao P.S. Niebauer J. Buitrago R. Lin P.S. Wang B.Y. Cooke J.P. Chen Y.D. Reaven G.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 947-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, the murine thoracic aorta was isolated and fixed in an agarose-coated culture plate. Fluorescein-labeled cultured mouse monocyte/macrophage cells, WEHI78/24 or MH-S cell lines, were plated on the aortic strip, and the plate was gently shaken for 30 min. Some experiments were performed in the presence of heparin (1–5 units/ml) (Sigma). After washing the tissue to remove unbound cells, the number of binding cells per high power field, 10 arbitrary views per one tissue, was counted with fluorescence microscopy. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. An unpaired Student t test was used to detect significant differences when two groups were compared. One-way analysis of variance was used to compare the differences among three or four groups, with Bonferroni's test for post hoc analysis. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to compare lipid fraction results obtained from FPLC. p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Atherosclerosis Is Attenuated in Animals with Functional EL Deletion—Male and female apoE-/- and LIPG-/-, apoE-/- mice were evaluated for development of atherosclerosis on normal chow and high fat dietary challenge. After 12 weeks on normal chow, at the age of 16 weeks, atherosclerotic lesion formation was evaluated by Sudan III staining of sections at the level of the aortic valve (Fig. 1). The extent of disease was quantified as the total lesion area determined by planimetry. Interestingly, the atherosclerotic lesions were markedly attenuated in double knockout mice when compared with apoE-/- mice. For animals on a normal chow diet, lesion size was significantly decreased by 71% in males (p < 0.001) and by 67% in females (p < 0.001) when double knockout mice were compared with apoE-/- mice (Fig. 1, A and B). Feeding mice with a high fat diet for 12 weeks accelerated atherosclerotic lesion formation in both apoE-/- and LIPG-/-, apoE-/- mice (Fig. 1, C and D). As was the case with normal chow, formation of atherosclerosis was attenuated in male double knockout mice when compared with apoE-/- mice. Quantitative analysis showed a significant 24% decrease (p < 0.001) in the lesion area of male LIPG-/-, apoE-/- mice when compared with apoE-/- mice (Fig. 1D). However, the difference was smaller and not statistically significant between female apoE-/- and double knockout mice. Serum Lipid Profiles Do Not Explain Attenuated Atherosclerosis in EL Knockout Mice—To investigate the mechanism by which atherosclerosis was attenuated in the double knockout animals, lipid profiles were obtained from wild-type C57Bl/6J control (WT), single knockout apoE-/- male and female mice, LIPG-/- male and female mice, and double knockout LIPG-/- and apoE-/- male and female mice on normal chow and high fat diets. The previously described 2-fold increase in serum cholesterol of LIPG-/- animals over WT was confirmed in these studies for male and female animals on both diets (Table I) (9Ishida T. Choi S. Kundu R.K. Hirata K. Rubin E.M. Cooper A.D. Quertermous T. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The male LIPG-/-, apoE-/- mice on a high fat diet had a significantly higher cholesterol level than either single knockout alone, and female double knockout mice on high fat had higher but not significantly increased cholesterol levels when compared with either single knockout strain. There was no difference between cholesterol levels in the LIPG-/-, apoE-/- mice and the apoE-/- animals on regular diet.Table IFasting serum lipid levels in different genetic mouse lines on normal chow and atherogenic high fat diet Data are shown as means ± S.E.

Choi S. Kundu R.K. Hirata K. Rubin E.M. Cooper A.D. Quertermous T. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). These differences disappeared on a high fat diet. Plasma TG levels were increased over WT in male and female apoE-/- animals on a regular diet, as expected. TG levels for the double knockout female mice on high fat were significantly higher than control and single knockout female mice but the same as seen on a normal chow diet. A different pattern was seen in male mice on the high fat diet. There was a decrease in serum TG in the apoE-/- animals, whereas TG levels in the LIPG-/- animals remained unchanged. On this atherogenic diet, there was no significant difference in TG levels between control, apoE-/-, and LIPG-/- male animals. Interestingly, the LIPG-/-, apoE-/- male animals on high fat continued to have significantly elevated TG levels. Plasma PL levels tended to be higher in LIPG-/- animals. Both male and female LIPG-/- animals showed a significantly greater than 50% increase in plasma PL levels when compared with WT mice (Table I). LIPG-/-, apoE-/- animals showed modest but significant increases in PL levels when compared with LIPG-/- animals. These changes are likely due to the loss of the phospholipase activity of EL. Fasting plasma from the different mouse lines was fractionated by gel filtration chromatography (FPLC) and cholesterol measured in individual fractions (Fig. 2, A–D). For both the WT and LIPG-/- lines, the majority of plasma cholesterol was found in the HDL fractions. The previously described 2-fold increase in cholesterol measured in HDL fractions was again observed for LIPG-/- animals when compared with WT animals on normal chow (Fig. 2, A and B) (9Ishida T. Choi S. Kundu R.K. Hirata K. Rubin E.M. Cooper A.D. Quertermous T. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). This increase was less apparent for those animals on the high fat diet but was still significant in females. Also, significant increases in IDL/LDL cholesterol were found in LIPG-/- animals when compared with WT, for female mice on normal chow and both male and female mice on a high fat diet (Fig. 2, C and D). The cholesterol concentration in the HDL fractions was similar for the apoE-/- and LIPG-/-, apoE-/- animals, and in all cases, it was significantly lower than in the other two genotype groups. By FPLC analysis, only a minimal increase in HDL was seen in apoE-/- knockout mice also missing EL. By contrast, in the apoE-/- and LIPG-/-, apoE-/- animals, most of the cholesterol was distributed among larger lipoproteins in the VLDL and IDL/LDL range. Examining the VLDL fractions, male double knockout animals had significantly greater VLDL cholesterol than apoE-/- animals, on both chow and high fat diet, and female double knockout animals had greater mean VLDL cholesterol levels that approached significance. To further characterize lipid metabolism in these genetic mouse models, lipoprotein fractions from pooled mouse plasma were separated by ultracentrifugation, and the cholesterol, TG, and PL content of each fraction was determined by biochemical assays. These studies also showed that LIPG-/- mice had 2-fold higher HDL-C than WT mice (Table II). HDL-C was found to be markedly decreased with loss of apoE, but this method found that EL deficiency partially restored the decreased HDL levels in apoE-/- mice. Also, a significant increase in LDL-C was observed in LIPG-/- when compared with WT. A prominent increase in VLDL/LDL triglyceride was observed in LIPG-/-, apoE-/- animals when compared with apoE-/- animals, consistent with the FPLC data showing that loss of EL was associated with increased TG-rich lipoproteins. HDL phospholipid was markedly increased in both the WT and apoE-/- mice missing EL. A smaller but significant increase in LDL phospholipid was observed in LIPG-/- animals when compared with WT, and there was a nonsignificant increase in LDL phospholipid in LIPG-/-, apoE-/- animals when compared with apoE-/- animals. These data suggest that HDL phospholipid is the most specific substrate for EL, and as a result of EL action, HDL catabolism produces a decrease in HDL-C levels. Moreover, EL may have weak enzymatic action on apoB-containing lipoproteins such as LDL.Table IILipid and lipoprotein profile in apoE-/-, LIPG-/-, LIPG-/-, apoE-/-, and wild-type mice on normal chow The HDL, LDL, and VLDL fractions were obtained from 1.5 ml pooled plasma from 2–3 male mice by ultracentrifugation. The cholesterol (chol), TG, and PL levels in each lipoprotein fraction were determined by biochemical assay. A total of 16–23 mice were included in each group. Data are shown as mean ± S.E. (mg/dl).

First, to determine whether EL was expressed in the apoE model atherosclerotic lesions, immunohistochemistry was performed using an antibody against mouse EL. In large vessels of WT mice, EL was predominantly expressed by luminal endothelial cells, although expression was also detected in the adventitia (Fig. 3, a and b). In apoE-/- mice, expression of EL was detected in the atherosclerotic plaque as well as endothelial cells (Fig. 3, d and e). Most of the EL-positive area was rich in macrophages, suggesting that EL-positive cells in the plaque were mainly infiltrating macrophages (Fig. 3, g and h). Smooth muscle α-actin staining was barely detectable in the EL-positive area of the atheroma (data not shown). Specificity of the staining for EL was confirmed by immunohistological analysis of atherosclerotic lesions from LIPG-/-, apoE-/- mice. These studies suggested reduced macrophage infiltration when compared with apoE-/- animals (Fig. 3, i and j). To compare EL protein levels in normal versus atherosclerotic vessels, homogenates of aortic tissue from WT and apoE-/- animals on normal chow or high fat diet were analyzed. Tissue samples were subjected to Western blotting using the same antibody as employed for immunohistochemistry (Fig. 4). This quantitative assay revealed that EL expression was increased by 2.1-fold in aortas from apoE-/- mice when compared with aortas from WT mice. Feeding mice with a high fat diet resulted in a modest (∼10%) increase in EL expression, in both the WT and the apoE-/- mice. These results in the apoE-/- mouse model of atherosclerosis are consistent with a previous study that documented EL expression in infiltrating macrophages and smooth muscle cells in advanced lesions of atherosclerosis in postmortem human coronary arteries (21Azumi H. Hirata K. Ishida T. Kojima Y. Rikitake Y. Takeuchi S. Inoue N. Kawashima S. Hayashi Y. Itoh H. Quertermous T. Yokoyama M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2003; 58: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, the degree and extent of EL expression appears to be increased early in human atherosclerotic vascular disease. To examine whether lesions in the apoE-/- and LIPG-/-, apoE-/- mice had different cellular composition, we performed immunohistochemical staining of atherosclerotic areas with antibodies chosen to specifically label different cell types. An antibody to MOMA-2 was employed to evaluate the area containing infiltrating macrophages. The percentage of the MOMA-2-stained area in the aortic sinus lesions was significantly smaller in LIPG-/-, apoE-/- mice, consistent with overall fewer macrophages in these lesions (Fig. 5). There was no significant difference in T-cell or smooth muscle cell composition of the lesions in the apoE-/- and the LIPG-/-, apoE-/- mice, as evaluated with immunohistochemistry with antibodies to CD3 and smooth muscle α-actin respectively (data not shown). To investigate the mechanism for the observed difference in macrophage composition of lesions between EL-expressing and non-EL-expressing apoE mice, aortic strips were isolated from LIPG-/-, apoE-/- and apoE-/- mice and incubated with cultured mouse monocyte/macrophage cells (the WEHI78/24 cell line). An ex vivo adhesion assay revealed that monocyte/macrophage binding to LIPG-/-, apoE-/- aortic strips was significantly less than to strips from apoE-/- mice (Fig. 6, A and B). Similar results were obtained when MH-S monocyte cells were used (data not shown). Heparin treatment significantly diminished the augmented cell adhesion to aortic strips from apoE-/- mice but not to those from LIPG-/-, apoE-/- mice, suggesting that up-regulation of EL in the aorta may in part mediate the cell adhesion through heparan sulfate proteoglycans (Fig. 6B). These findings support the measured decrease in macrophage composition of EL-negative lesions and provide a possible mechanism by which EL might act directly to impact the development of vascular wall disease. Whether EL might modulate monocyte adherence and transit into the vessel wall through local lipid metabolism or through a direct bridging function will require further investigation. To initiate studies investigating EL involvement in vascular disease, the previously described congenic strain of mice carrying a 129SV/J-null LIPG allele in the C57Bl/6 background was bred to a strain homozygous for null apoE alleles in the C57Bl/6 background (9Ishida T.

Science. 1992; 258: 468-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar). This model has been extensively characterized, both in terms of the altered lipoprotein and lipid profiles and in terms of the predisposition to atherosclerosis. Homozygous apoE knockout animals have a markedly elevated serum cholesterol with increased VLDL and IDL/LDL cholesterol and reduced HDL-C. As a result of this highly atherogenic lipoprotein profile, apoE-/- animals develop spontaneously complex atherosclerotic lesions by 15 weeks of age that are similar to those in humans. The atherogenic potential of a broad range of lipid metabolism and inflammatory mediator genes has been investigated by evaluation of disease development in the apoE-/- model (24Plump A.S. Breslow J.L. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1995; 15: 495-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It was anticipated that LIPG-/-, apoE-/- animals might show increased HDL-C levels and a related decrease in the rate and extent of atherosclerotic disease when compared with the apoE-/- animals. Interestingly, the LIPG-/-, apoE-/- mice showed only a modest increase in HDL-C levels. There was also an increase in VLDL cholesterol in LIPG-/-, apoE-/- animals, and this increase was significant for the males. The increase in serum TG level was consistent with the increase in VLDL cholesterol in LIPG-/-, apoE-/- animals. The mechanism for this increase in VLDL is unclear, but the observation is consistent with the recent study that demonstrated a role for EL in the metabolism of apoB-containing lipoprotein particles such as VLDL and LDL (25Broedl U.C. Maugeais C. Millar J.S. Jin W. Moore R.E. Fuki I.V. Marchadier D. Glick J.M. Rader D.J. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1554-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this case, loss of EL in addition to apoE would result in further prolonged half-life of VLDL, accounting for the increases noted in the double knockout animals. A previous study has indicated that EL has some weak triglyceride lipase activity, particularly when lipoprotein substrates are abundant, as found in apoE-/- mice on a high fat diet (26McCoy M.G. Sun G.S. Marchadier D. Maugeais C. Glick J.M. Rader D.J. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 921-929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that EL triglyceride lipase activity accounted for part of the difference in TG level. Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that LIPG-/- animals on a high fat diet showed increased LDL/IDL levels when compared with WT animals. Although loss of EL does not impair the metabolism of apoB-containing particles in the setting of a normal diet, challenge with high fat provides evidence for a decreased ability to clear LDL/IDL particles. The lipid profile of the LIPG-/-, apoE-/- animals showed an increase in antiatherogenic HDL and an increase in atherogenic VLDL/LDL. This balanced increase in lipoprotein particle makeup was expected to be neutral with respect to the degree of atherosclerosis. It was thus surprising to find a 70% decrease in the vascular lesion area in the LIPG-/-, apoE-/- animals when compared with the apoE-/-animals. The observed effect is likely mediated in part by the observed modest increase in antiatherogenic HDL particle number. There was no evidence for other HDL-related mechanisms for the decrease in atherosclerosis. Other groups have shown changes in HDL particle size with EL function (10Ma K. Cilingiroglu M. Otvos J.D. Ballantyne C.M. Marian A.J. Chan L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2748-2753Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 27Maugeais C. Tietge U.J. Broedl U.C. Marchadier D. Cain W. McCoy M.G. Lund-Katz S. Glick J.M. Rader D.J. Circulation. 2003; 108: 2121-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In studies reported here, changes in HDL size were not apparent from FPLC curves. Also, the reported changes in particle size in EL-null animals are consistent with increased numbers of phospholipid-rich particles, which are known to have proatherogenic effects, and could not simply account for the observed histologic differences in atherosclerosis (28Singaraja R.R. Fievet C. Castro G. James E.R. Hennuyer N. Clee S.M. Bissada N. Choy J.C. Fruchart J.C. McManus B.M. Staels B. Hayden M.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). A recent study showed that EL alters the composition of HDL to decrease binding capacity to scavenger receptor class B, type I and modulate scavenger receptor class B, type I-dependent cholesterol efflux (29Gauster M. Oskolkova O.V. Innerlohinger J. Glatter O. Knipping G. Frank S. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Overall, available data suggest that atherosclerosis is modulated by EL in the apoE knockout model and that only a portion of this effect is likely explained by the observed increase in HDL-C. As is the case with other lipases, EL may regulate atherosclerosis through functions in the vessel wall, including lipoprotein uptake and monocyte trafficking. EL has been shown to regulate cellular lipoprotein uptake. Several studies have indicated that EL mediates binding and uptake of plasma lipoproteins via a process that is independent of its enzymatic activity, requires cellular heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and is regulated by ligand clustering (14Strauss J.G.

As a first step to investigate possible direct vascular wall functions of EL, we have documented increased EL expression in the diseased aorta of apoE knockout animals, and validated this observation in human atherosclerosis (21Azumi H. Hirata K. Ishida T. Kojima Y. Rikitake Y. Takeuchi S. Inoue N. Kawashima S. Hayashi Y. Itoh H. Quertermous T. Yokoyama M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2003; 58: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Through studies investigating the cell-specific expression of EL in atherosclerotic plaque, we have shown that infiltrating macrophages are primarily responsible for this increased expression. Interestingly, these experiments also identified a decreased relative macrophage content in the combined EL- and apoE-negative lesions. Follow-up studies have documented a related decrease in monocyte adhesion to vascular wall tissue missing EL. Increased monocyte adhesion was documented in vitro and ex vivo using EL-overexpressing COS7 cells and EL-overexpressing vessels, and the EL-mediated adhesions were inhibited by heparin and heparinase I, suggesting that up-regulation of EL may enhance monocyte adhesion to the vessel wall by interaction with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (30Shimokawa Y. Hirata K. Kojima Y. Iwai K. Ishida T. Hirase T. Inoue N. Kawashima S. Yokoyama M. Circ J. 2003; 67: 220Google Scholar). Taken together, these data strongly suggest a primary role for EL in mediating monocyte adhesion and uptake into the vessel wall in the setting of atherosclerotic disease. Comparable studies performed with other lipases have provided results similar to those reported here for EL. Mice lacking both hepatic lipase and apoE had increased total plasma cholesterol, with the increase in cholesterol mainly due to VLDL and only a very modest increase in HDL cholesterol (28Singaraja R.R. Fievet C. Castro G. James E.R. Hennuyer N. Clee S.M. Bissada N. Choy J.C. Fruchart J.C. McManus B.M. Staels B. Hayden M.R. J. Clin.

Chem. 1997; 272: 13570-13575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Despite this increase in plasma cholesterol, hepatic lipase deficiency in apoE-/- mice resulted in significantly decreased aortic plaque sizes in female mice fed normal chow. The improved capacity to promote cholesterol efflux, together with the modest increase in HDL, were thought to overcome the increase in atherogenic lipoproteins. Such observations, in conjunction with those reported here for EL, argue that this family of proteins can modulate atherosclerosis through local vascular wall disease-related processes as well as regulation of circulating lipid levels. We thank Dan Rader for thoughtful discussions and for providing the anti-mouse EL antibody."

This integrin binds the coagulation protein fibrinogen providing a key link between thrombosis and inflammation. However, the mechanism by which αMβ2 binds fibrinogen remains unknown.

Here, using surface plasmon resonance, we examined the interaction of the ligand binding αMI-domain of αMβ2 with the D fragment of fibrinogen and showed that this ligand is capable of associating with several αMI-domain molecules. To localize the alternative αMI-domain binding sites, we screened peptide libraries covering the complete sequences of the γC and βC domains, comprising the majority of the D fragment structure, for αMI-domain binding. In addition to the P2 and P1 peptides, the αMI-domain bound to many other sequences in the γC and βC scans. Similar to P1 and P2, synthetic peptides derived from γC and βC were efficient inhibitors of αMβ2-mediated cell adhesion and were able to directly support adhesion suggesting that they contain identical recognition information. Analyses of recognition specificity using substitutional peptide libraries demonstrated that the αMI-domain binding depends on basic and hydrophobic residues. These findings establish a new model of αMβ2 binding in which the αMI-domain interacts with multiple sites in fibrinogen and has the potential to recognize numerous sequences.

By providing a link between the cell cytoplasm and the surrounding matrix integrins regulate a diverse range of processes, including cellular differentiation, cell migration, the immune response, and the maintenance of tissue architecture. Integrins also play key roles in a variety of pathological conditions. Many integrins exhibit a very broad binding specificity and are able to recognize diverse ligands representing several protein families. Integrin αMβ2 (Mac-1, CD11b/CD18, and CR3) is the most promiscuous member of the entire family with more than 30 proteins being reported as its ligands. αMβ2 is abundantly expressed on activated leukocytes, primarily neutrophils and monocytes, and mediates critical adhesive reactions during the inflammatory responses. Specifically, it contributes to firm adhesion of neutrophils to endothelial cells, promotes their subsequent diapedesis, and participates in neutrophil migration through the interstitial matrix (reviewed in Ref. 1Kishimoto T.K. Baldwin E.T. Anderson D.C. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia1999: 537-569Google Scholar). Many other neutrophil responses, including phagocytosis, homotypic aggregation, degranulation, and adherence to microorganisms, also depend on αMβ2. It is clear that the complexity of αMβ2 functions arises from its ability to bind numerous ligands. Ligands of αMβ2 include many extracellular matrix proteins (fibronectin, collagens, thrombospondin, Cyr61, etc.), blood proteins (fibrinogen, iC3b, kininogen, factor H, Factor X, t-PA, etc.), proteases (elastase, myeloperoxidase, plasminogen, etc.), and microorganism products (see references in Ref. 2Yakubenko V.P.

It is not known how this single integrin can recognize such a vast repertoire of structurally diverse ligands nor what the biological significance is of the broad ligand binding specificity of αMβ2. The prototypic example, and a physiologically important ligand, is the plasma protein fibrinogen (Fg), 1The abbreviations used are: Fg, fibrinogen; γC and βC, globular COOH-terminal domains of the γ- and β-chains of Fg; αMI-domain, a region of ∼ 200 amino acid residues “inserted” in the αM subunit of αMβ2; P2, P2-C and P1, the γC-domain sequences corresponding to γ377–395, γ383–395 and γ190–202; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PVP, polyvinylpyrrolidone; BSA, bovine serum albumin; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; GST, glutathione S-transferase. which served in many studies to define the mechanism of αMβ2 ligand recognition. Fg (340 kDa) is a large multidomain protein consisting of two pairs of polypeptide chains, α, β, and γ, organized into three major structural regions: a central E and two peripheral D regions held together by coiled-coil connectors (Fig. 1). The majority of the D region is formed by the C-terminal portions of the β- and γ-chains folded into similar structures (so-called βC- and γC-domains) (3Spraggon G. Everse S.J. Doolittle R.F. Nature. 1997; 389: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The alternatively spliced αEC-domains (present in a small population of Fg molecules) represent the extensions of the α-chains and have a high structural homology to βC and γC (4Spraggon G. Applegate D. Everse S.J. Zhang J.-Z. Veerapandian L. Redman C. Doolittle R.F. Grieninger G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9099-9104Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Two unrelated sequences in the γC-domain, γ190–202 (GWTVFQKRLDGS) and γ377–395 (YSMKKTTMKIIPFNRLTIG), have been proposed to be sites that mediate Fg binding to αMβ2 (5Altieri D.C. Plescia J.

The peptides P1 and P2, corresponding to these sequences, inhibit αMβ2-mediated cell adhesion, directly support adhesion, and are able to promote cell migration (6Ugarova T.P. Solovjov D.A. Zhang L.

Yakovlev, L. Medved, S. P. Yadav, and T. P. Ugarova, unpublished data. Accordingly, the binding site for P2 was localized in the αMI-domain (9Yakubenko V.P. Solovjov D.A. Zhang L. Yee V.C. Plow E.F.

Although considerable effort has been made to understand the mechanism by which αMβ2 binds the P1 and P2 sequences, there are several limitations that preclude integrating existing data into a satisfactory model of Fg recognition by αMβ2. First, although both P1 and P2 are active when presented to the cell as synthetic peptides, it is P2, but not P1, that appears to bind the αMI-domain in the context of γC. Recent mutational analyses demonstrated that deletion of the entire P2 in γC impaired the αMI-domain binding, whereas mutations in P1 were not effective (10Ugarova T.P. Lishko V.K. Podolnikova N.P. Okumura N. Merkulov S. Yakubenko V.P. Yee V.C. Lord S.T. Haas T.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9365-9373Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the P1 peptide is an effective αMβ2 antagonist suggesting that it may share with P2 some structural information required for integrin recognition. Second, deletion of P2 in γC decreased the αMI-domain binding by only ∼50% suggesting that one or more alternative sites participate in recognition (10Ugarova T.P. Lishko V.K. Podolnikova N.P. Okumura N. Merkulov S. Yakubenko V.P. Yee V.C. Lord S.T. Haas T.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9365-9373Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Third, the βC and αEC domains of Fg, which share with γC only 39 and 40% sequence identity, respectively, and do not contain P2, bind the αMI-domain (10Ugarova T.P. Lishko V.K. Podolnikova N.P. Okumura N. Merkulov S. Yakubenko V.P. Yee V.C. Lord S.T. Haas T.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9365-9373Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 11Lishko V.K. Yakubenko V.P. Hertzberg K.M. Grieninger G. Ugarova T.P. Blood. 2001; 98: 2448-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This further suggests that βC and αEC also contain αMI-domain recognition sites. Fourth, although the P2 sequence accounts for the partial αMI-domain binding by γC, the P2 peptide inhibits αMβ2-mediated cell adhesion to immobilized γC almost completely. It also efficiently inhibits cell adhesion to Fg and its fragments D and αEC (6Ugarova T.P. Solovjov D.A. Zhang L. Loukinov D.I. Yee V.C. Medved L.V. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22519-22527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 11Lishko V.K. Yakubenko V.P. Hertzberg K.M. Grieninger G. Ugarova T.P. Blood. 2001; 98: 2448-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data imply that Fg binding by αMβ2 cannot be explained by a simple model in which P2 is the single site in Fg and prompt us to reconsider the molecular basis for αMβ2-Fg recognition. One hypothesis that would reconcile the issues mentioned above suggests that Fg contains multiple αMI-domain binding sequences and that these unrelated sequences comprise recognition information resembling that of P2. To test the “multiple-site” hypothesis, we analyzed αMI-domain binding to the D fragment using surface plasmon resonance. The analyses provided direct evidence of multiple binding sites within this macromolecular ligand. To identify these sites, we screened cellulose-bound peptide libraries representing the complete sequences of γC and βC for αMI-domain binding. Previously, cellulose-bound peptide libraries were widely utilized to define the mechanisms of recognition in biological systems in which promiscuity in ligand binding plays an important role (12Rudiger S. Germeroth L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 13Kramer A. Keitel T. Winkler K. Stocklein W. Hohne W. Schneider-Mergener J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 34219-34225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We found that the αMI-domain bound to many short linear sequences scattered throughout the γC and βC structural domains. Furthermore, analyses of the αMI-domain binding sequences allowed initial insights into the molecular features that determine αMI-domain recognition specificity. We anticipate that defining the mechanism by which αMβ2 binds Fg will help to solve the principles that govern the multiligand recognition properties exhibited by αMβ2. Proteins and Peptides—Human Fg was obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). The D fragment (100 kDa) was prepared by digestion of Fg with plasmin in the presence of 20 mm CaCl2 as described previously (15Ugarova T.P. Budzynski A.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13687-13693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The active conformer of the αMI-domain (residues Glu123-Lys315) as a fusion protein with GST was prepared essentially as described (9Yakubenko V.P. Solovjov D.A. Zhang L. Yee V.C. Plow E.F. Ugarova T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 275: 13995-14003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To cleave the αMI-domain from the fusion part, human thrombin (15 units) was added to 3.0 ml of glutathione-agarose beads with GST-I-domain. The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 22 °C, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was then added to inactivate thrombin. The αMI-domain was labeled with 125I using IODO-GEN (Pierce). For SPR analyses, the free Cys128 in the αMI-domain was blocked with iodoacetamide after reduction with dithiothreitol and dialyzed against HBS-P buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% P-20 surfactant buffer). The monomer state of the αMI-domain was assessed using size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences). The peptides corresponding to Fg sequences γ377YSMKKTTMKIIPFNRLTIG395 (P2), γ383TMKIIPFNRLTIG395 (P2-C), γ157ANKGAKQSLYFI169, γ273KYRLTYAYFAG283, γ336MNKCHAGHLNG346, γ340HAGHLNGVYYQGGTYSKA357 (H19), and β341SVNKYRGTAGNA352 were synthesized by Fmoc chemistry using an Applied Biosystems model 430 peptide synthesizer (Foster City, CA). The peptides were purified by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography using water/acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as a mobile phase and analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Synthesis of Peptide Libraries—The peptide libraries representing the complete sequences of the γC (residues 143–411)- and βC (residues 206–461)-domains of Fg were prepared by parallel spot synthesis using Whatman 50 cellulose membranes as described (16Frank R. Tetrahedron. 1992; 48: 9217-9232Crossref Scopus (927) Google Scholar, 17Kramer A. Schneider-Mergener J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 89: 25-39Google Scholar). Amino acid sequences of the γC- and βC-domains were obtained from the NCBI data base (accession numbers NP000500 and NP005132). The libraries were synthesized as 9-mer overlapping peptides with a 3-amino acid offset. Peptides were C-terminally attached to cellulose via a (β-Ala)2 spacer and were acetylated N-terminally. The Fmoc-protected and pentafluorophenyl (Pfp)-activated amino acids for peptide synthesis were purchased from Bachem (King of Prussia, PA). Pfp-activated Trp was obtained from Novabiochem. Screening of Cellulose-bound Peptides for αMI-domain Binding—The membrane-bound peptides were tested for the ability to bind the αMI-domain as described previously (10Ugarova T.P. Lishko V.K. Podolnikova N.P. Okumura N. Merkulov S. Yakubenko V.P. Yee V.C. Lord S.T. Haas T.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9365-9373Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In brief, before screening the dry membrane was soaked in methanol for 10 min and then in TBS for 15 min at 22 °C. The membrane was blocked with 1% BSA in TBS and then incubated with 10 μg/ml 125I-labeled αMI-domain in TBS containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm dithiothreitol for 3 h at 22 °C. After washing with TBS plus 0.05% Tween 20, the membranes were dried and the αMI-domain binding was visualized by autoradiography. Cell Adhesion Assays—Adhesion assays with HEK 293 cells expressing wild-type αMβ2 were performed essentially as described previously with a modification (6Ugarova T.P. Solovjov D.A. Zhang L. Loukinov D.I. Yee V.C. Medved L.V. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22519-22527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 10Ugarova T.P. Lishko V.K. Podolnikova N.P. Okumura N. Merkulov S. Yakubenko V.P. Yee V.C. Lord S.T. Haas T.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9365-9373Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, the wells of polystyrene microtiter plates (Immulon 4HBX, Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA) were coated with 2.5 μg/ml D fragment for 3 h at 37 °C and post-coated with 0.5% PVP for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were labeled with 10 μm Calcein AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), preincubated for 15 min at 22 °C with selected concentrations of peptides in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 0.1% BSA, and then 100-μl aliquots (4.5 × 104 cells) were added to the wells. Immediately before cell addition, 10 μl of 1% BSA was added to the wells. After 30-min incubation at 37 °C, the nonadherent cells were removed and fluorescence was measured in a fluorescence plate reader (CytoFluorII, Applied Biosystems). The number of adherent cells was determined from a standard curve constructed using the fluorescence of aliquots with a known number of labeled cells. Solid-phase Binding Assays—Selected peptides derived form the γC- and βC-domain libraries were tested for their ability to compete with the binding of the αMI-domain to immobilized D fragment. 96-well Immulon 4HBX microtiter plates were coated with the D fragment at 1 μg/ml for 3 h at 37 °C and post-coated with 1% BSA for 1 h. The αMI-domain (10 μg/ml) as fusion with GST in TBS containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 0.05% Tween 20 was preincubated with different concentrations of peptides for 30 min at 22 °C, and 0.1-ml aliquots of mixtures were added to wells. After incubation for 1.5 h at 22 °C, anti-GST monoclonal antibody was added. The bound αMI-domain was quantitated after the reaction with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase. Surface Plasmon Resonance Studies—Binding parameters for the interaction of the αMI-domain with the D fragment of Fg were measured by using a Biacore 3000 SPR-based biosensor (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The D fragment was immobilized on the CM5 chips (Biacore) at density of 740 response units according to the manufacturer's protocol. Different concentrations of the αMI-domain in HSB-P buffer (Biacore) adjusted to 1 mm MgCl2 were flowed over flow cells containing the D fragment. All data were corrected for the response obtained using a blank reference flow cell that was activated with N-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide and then blocked with ethanolamine. Steady-state experiments were performed by injecting the αMI-domain at 10 μl/min for 8 min. The chip surface was regenerated with 2 m NaCl plus 50 mm NaOH. Data were analyzed using the BIAevaluation 3.1 program. Nonspecific binding to the blank flow cell was subtracted. The data for the construction of Scatchard plots were obtained from the equilibrium portions of SPR sensograms. Values for the bound and unbound αMI-domain were calculated as described (18Rich R.L. Kreikemeyer B. Owens R.T. LaBrenz S. Narayana S.V.L. Weinstock G.M. Murray B.R. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26939-26945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The αMI-domain Interacts with Multiple Binding Sites in the D Fragment—Previously, we have demonstrated that the removal of the γ377–395 (P2) segment decreased but did not ruin the γC-domain capability to bind the αMI-domain and that the homologous βC-domain of Fg also exhibited αMI-domain binding activity (10Ugarova T.P. Lishko V.K. Podolnikova N.P. Okumura N. Merkulov S. Yakubenko V.P. Yee V.C. Lord S.T. Haas T.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9365-9373Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The presence of independent recognition regions within γC and βC suggests that the αMI-domain can bind to several sites in the D region and, hence, binding should deviate from a 1:1 stoichiometry. To characterize the αMI-domain-ligand interactions, we determined equilibrium constants for the binding of the αMI-domain to the D fragment using SPR. For these analyses, the αMI-domain was prepared in the active “open” conformation (residues Glu123-Lys315) (19Xiong J.-P. Li R. Essafi M. Stehle T. Arnaout M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38762-38767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and efficiently bound the immobilized D fragment in solid-phase binding assays (not shown). The D fragment was coupled to the chip, and the SPR profiles across a range of αMI-domain concentrations flowed over protein surfaces were examined. Typically, sensograms were obtained at 16–24 different αMI-domain concentrations for each experiment. Fig. 2A demonstrates the SPR profiles for the binding of selected αMI-domain concentrations. The maximal responses achieved in the equilibrium portions of the SPR sensograms for each αMI-domain concentration were determined, and binding data were used to construct Scatchard plots and calculate the number of binding sites and the dissociation constants (KD) (Fig. 2B). Analyses of Scatchard plots indicated that the stoichiometry of the αMI-domain binding to the D fragment was (3.7 ± 0.1):1 and a KD of 3.0 ± 0.9 μm. This stoichiometry was obtained from extrapolation of the linear parts of the plots. It is notable that the plots were not absolutely linear (that would be consistent with a hypothetical one-simple-binding-class model) but, rather, slightly concave upward suggesting the presence of binding sites with higher affinities. Similar results were obtained when analyses were performed using different preparations of the αMI-domain and at two different densities of the immobilized D fragment. Although we were not able to resolve the sites with higher affinities, the data indicate that the αMI-domain binding to the D fragment occurs at multiple sites. Screening of γC- and βC-domain Peptide Libraries for Binding to the αMI-domain—To localize the alternative binding sites, we screened the cellulose-bound peptide libraries representing the complete sequences of γC (residues 143–411) and βC (residues 206–461). The peptide libraries were composed of 9-mer peptides with three residues offset and, thus, overlapping by six residues. The length of peptides is justified by the finding that 6-mer peptides derived from the γ383–395 (P2-C) sequence can bind the αMI-domain (10Ugarova T.P. Lishko V.K. Podolnikova N.P. Okumura N. Merkulov S. Yakubenko V.P. Yee V.C. Lord S.T. Haas T.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9365-9373Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The membranes with covalently attached peptides were incubated with 125I-labeled αMI-domain to equilibrium in the presence of Mg2+, and the binding was detected by autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 3 (A and C), the αMI-domain bound numerous peptides in the γC and βC libraries (indicated in red in panels B and D, respectively). In these scans, the αMI-domain bound frequently to neighboring peptides with overlapping sequences indicating that these clusters share the binding site(s). In the γC library, several contiguous peptides (spots 75–82) that originate from γ377–395 (P2) and the N-terminally adjacent sequence γ368–377 formed the most prominent αMI-domain binding cluster (cluster 5). Another strong cluster was identified in the γ158–181 sequence, because adjacent peptides in spots 5–11 bound the αMI-domain (cluster 1). In addition, several other regions in the scan (spots 16–18, 21–22, 44–45, 54, 64–66, and 86–87) were positive for the αMI-domain binding. The spots 16–18 correspond to the γ188–202 region, which contains the P1 sequence, γ190–202. Thus, screening the γC library validated the two previously known αMI-domain binding sequences, P2 and P1, and revealed several new sequences. The specificity of interactions within the γC library was confirmed by re-synthesizing the positive spots and probing the membranes with the αMI-domain in the presence of 100 μg/ml soluble P2. The αMI-domain binding was markedly decreased (not shown). Several αMI-domain binding peptides have been identified in the βC library (Fig. 3C, and sequences in red in Fig. 3D). A strong positive cluster in the C-terminal part of the βC array (spots 77–84) corresponds to β436–461 and is homologous to γ368–395 (the γC and βC sequence alignment is shown in Fig. 3E). The αMI-domain binding sequence β247GWTVIQNRQ255 (spot 15) is highly homologous to the P1 peptide γ190GWTVFQKRL198 (spot 17 in Fig. 3A and an alignment in Fig. 3E). The major difference between the γC and βC libraries is the absence in βC of the N-terminal αMI-domain binding cluster homologous to γ158–181. Another distinction is that the γC library contains more αMI-domain binding clusters. Analyses of the γC and βC scans revealed that the αMI-domain is able to recognize a broad spectrum of unrelated peptides with no obvious consensus sequence. However, the following tendency was noted: the αMI-domain binding correlated strongly with the ligand peptide charge, i.e. only the positively charged (at pH 7.0) peptides enriched in basic residues bound the αMI-domain whereas negatively charged or neutral peptides were not active. This dependence is illustrated in Fig. 4 for the γC library. Similar correlations were obtained for the βC derived peptides (not shown). The only exception noted in the γC library was a peptide in spot 12 (QQFLVYCEI). To confirm the finding that the αMI-domain binders require the presence of basic residues and to provide an additional control of specificity, we synthesized a modified γC library (γC-Glu) in which Lys and Arg in selected peptides were substituted to Glu (Fig. 5, A and B). The peptide #54 and γ376–395 regions (spots 78–82) were left unchanged to provide internal binding controls. Screening of the γC-Glu library demonstrated that the reversal of charge produced two types of results: 1) the disappearance or significant reduction of αMI-domain binding to some peptides and 2) little alteration of binding to several others (Fig. 5A). Within the first group, the introduction of Glu resulted in the loss of αMI-domain binding to peptides within the first cluster (spots 5, 6, 7, 10, and 11), and eliminated or significantly decreased binding to spots 16 and 18 (in cluster 2), 21–22 (in cluster 3), and 64–66 in cluster 5. In the second group, binding of the αMI-domain to peptides in spots 8, 9, 17, 44, 45, and 75–77 still persisted despite the change of charge. For example, the substitution of two lysines within YFIKPLKAN to glutamic acid (spot 9) rendered the peptide YFIEPLEAN negatively charged but did not abrogate its ability to bind the αMI-domain. Likewise, the charge reversal of RLTYAYFAG (spot 45), although reduced, did not eliminate its binding ability. Because previous structure-function analyses demonstrated that hydrophobic residues flanking the basic residues within P2 are important for its activity (10Ugarova T.P. Lishko V.K. Podolnikova N.P. Okumura N. Merkulov S. Yakubenko V.P. Yee V.C. Lord S.T. Haas T.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9365-9373Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we next analyzed amino acid distribution in the two groups of peptides. Hydrophobic residues were found to be strongly disfavored in the first group of peptides but enriched in the second group. To determine whether hydrophobic residues surrounding Lys in YFIKPLKAN, or Leu neighboring Arg in RLTYAYFAG are involved in the αMI-domain binding, two substitutional libraries were prepared (Fig. 6, A and B). Confirming the results from the γC-Glu library, the YFIEPLEAN peptide (spot 2) had reduced capacity to bind the αMI-domain. Substitution of Ile to Ala (YFAEPLEAN) produced a peptide only marginally active (spot 3), and simultaneous mutations of Phe and Ile to Ala resulted in the complete loss of the αMI-domain binding (Fig. 6, spot 4). In RLTYAYFAG (Fig. 6A, spot 8), mutation of Arg to Glu reduced binding (spot 9) and additional mutations of Leu and Tyr created the completely inactive EATAAYFAG peptide (spots 11–16). Taken together, these analyses identified several new αMI-domain recognition sequences in γC and βC and provided preliminary insights into the αMI-domain binding preferences.Fig. 6Mutational analyses of the γC peptides. A substitutional library of the peptides YFIKPLKAN and RLTYAYFAG from the γC library (spots 9 and 45, respectively, in Fig. 3, A and B), in which positively charged and hydrophobic residues were substituted to Ala, was tested for the αMI-domain binding (A).

https://openalex.org/W2060073899,"We observed evolutionary conservation of canonical nuclear localization signal sequences (K(K/R)X(K/R)) in the C-terminal polybasic regions (PBRs) of some Rac and Rho isoforms. Canonical D-box sequences (RXXL), which target proteins for proteasome-mediated degradation, are also evolutionarily conserved near the PBRs of these small GTPases. We show that the Rac1 PBR (PVKKRKRK) promotes Rac1 nuclear accumulation, whereas the RhoA PBR (RRGKKKSG) keeps RhoA in the cytoplasm. A mutant Rac1 protein named Rac1 (pbrRhoA), in which the RhoA PBR replaces the Rac1 PBR, has greater cytoplasmic localization, enhanced resistance to proteasome-mediated degradation, and higher protein levels than Rac1. Mutating the D-box by substituting alanines at amino acids 174 and 177 significantly increases the protein levels of Rac1 but not Rac1(pbrRhoA). These results suggest that Rac1 (pbrRhoA) is more resistant than Rac1 to proteasome-mediated degradative pathways involving the D-box. The cytoplasmic localization of Rac1(pbrRhoA) provides the most obvious reason for its resistance to proteasome-mediated degradation, because we show that Rac1(pbrRhoA) does not greatly differ from Rac1 in its ability to stimulate membrane ruffling or to interact with SmgGDS and IQGAP1-calmodulin complexes. These findings support the model that nuclear localization signal sequences in the PBR direct Rac1 to the nucleus, where Rac1 participates in signaling pathways that ultimately target it for degradation. We observed evolutionary conservation of canonical nuclear localization signal sequences (K(K/R)X(K/R)) in the C-terminal polybasic regions (PBRs) of some Rac and Rho isoforms. Canonical D-box sequences (RXXL), which target proteins for proteasome-mediated degradation, are also evolutionarily conserved near the PBRs of these small GTPases. We show that the Rac1 PBR (PVKKRKRK) promotes Rac1 nuclear accumulation, whereas the RhoA PBR (RRGKKKSG) keeps RhoA in the cytoplasm. A mutant Rac1 protein named Rac1 (pbrRhoA), in which the RhoA PBR replaces the Rac1 PBR, has greater cytoplasmic localization, enhanced resistance to proteasome-mediated degradation, and higher protein levels than Rac1. Mutating the D-box by substituting alanines at amino acids 174 and 177 significantly increases the protein levels of Rac1 but not Rac1(pbrRhoA). These results suggest that Rac1 (pbrRhoA) is more resistant than Rac1 to proteasome-mediated degradative pathways involving the D-box. The cytoplasmic localization of Rac1(pbrRhoA) provides the most obvious reason for its resistance to proteasome-mediated degradation, because we show that Rac1(pbrRhoA) does not greatly differ from Rac1 in its ability to stimulate membrane ruffling or to interact with SmgGDS and IQGAP1-calmodulin complexes. These findings support the model that nuclear localization signal sequences in the PBR direct Rac1 to the nucleus, where Rac1 participates in signaling pathways that ultimately target it for degradation. Members of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases, which includes the Ras and Rho families, participate in a wide variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes (reviewed in Refs. 1Wettschureck N. Offermanns S. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 80: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar and 2Williams C.L. Cell. Signal. 2002; 15: 1071-1080Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The signaling pathways utilized by different members of the Ras and Rho families may act synergistically, antagonistically, or independently to elicit many cellular responses, including changes in gene transcription, proliferation, motility, adhesion, and contraction (reviewed in Refs. 1Wettschureck N. Offermanns S. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 80: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 2Williams C.L. Cell. Signal. 2002; 15: 1071-1080Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 3Perez-Moreno M.

Similar structural features in these GTPases may promote their interactions with the same activator or effector, resulting in the convergence of their signaling pathways. Characterizing the similar structural features that allow Ras and Rho family members to interact with shared activators or effectors will help determine how the signaling pathways of these small GTPases overlap. The C-terminal polybasic region (PBR) 1The abbreviations used are: PBR, polybasic region; aa, amino acid(s); CA, constitutively active; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; DN, dominant negative; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; NLS, nuclear localization signal; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; OD, optical density. is a structural feature that is present in many small GTPases in the Ras and Rho families (reviewed in Ref. 2Williams C.L. Cell. Signal. 2002; 15: 1071-1080Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The PBR is comprised of a series of lysines and arginines and often immediately precedes the C-terminal CAAX sequence (Table I). Several investigators have proposed that a major function of the PBR is to promote the interactions of small GTPases with the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein SmgGDS (2Williams C.L. Cell. Signal. 2002; 15: 1071-1080Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 5Rebhun J.F. Castro A.F. Quilliam L.A. J. Biol.

SmgGDS interacts with small GTPases that have a PBR, including RhoA, Rac1, Rac2, Cdc42, K-Ras4B, Rap1A, Rap1B, and RalA (reviewed in Ref. 2Williams C.L. Cell. Signal. 2002; 15: 1071-1080Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Thus, SmgGDS is a strong candidate to regulate overlapping signaling pathways utilized by different members of the Ras and Rho families.Table IC-terminal sequences of Rac and Rho proteins from different speciesSpeciesGTPaseC-terminal sequenceaBasic amino acids that make up the PBR are capitalized.

Open table in a new tab We observed that canonical nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequences (K(K/R)X(K/R)) (9Chelsky D. Ralph R. Jonak G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2487-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) are present in the PBRs of many small GTPases (2Williams C.L. Cell. Signal. 2002; 15: 1071-1080Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that the nuclear accumulation of Rac1 requires the PBR (8Lanning C.C. Ruiz-Velasco R. Williams C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12495-12506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), consistent with the presence of canonical NLS sequences in the Rac1 PBR (Table I). In contrast, RhoA exhibits minimal nuclear accumulation (8Lanning C.C. Ruiz-Velasco R. Williams C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12495-12506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), consistent with the absence of NLS sequences in the RhoA PBR (Table I). We noticed that Rac and Rho proteins exist as different isoforms that are distinguished by the presence or absence of canonical NLS sequences in their PBRs (Table I). This expression of isoforms differing by the presence or absence of a canonical NLS sequence in the PBR is evolutionarily conserved (Table I). Isoforms of small GTPases that differ by the presence or absence of a functional NLS will have different nucleocytoplasmic shuttling capabilities, allowing them to operate in different subcellular compartments. The evolutionary conservation of canonical NLS sequences in the PBRs of Rac and Rho isoforms (Table I), as well as other small GTPases (2Williams C.L. Cell. Signal. 2002; 15: 1071-1080Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar), indicates that nucleocytoplasmic shuttling may be an important characteristic of these GTPases. However, the purpose of this nucleocytoplasmic shuttling is currently unknown. Because small GTPases are ∼21 kDa, they should be small enough to passively diffuse through nuclear pores and enter the nucleus without the aid of an NLS. However, the NLS may be required for the nuclear entry of small GTPases when they are associated with other proteins (such as SmgGDS) in protein complexes that are too large to passively diffuse through nuclear pores. NLS-containing small GTPases may participate in signaling pathways inside the nucleus. This possibility is consistent with reports that signaling proteins that physically interact with these small GTPases are present in the nucleus (reviewed in Ref. 2Williams C.L. Cell. Signal. 2002; 15: 1071-1080Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling can direct proteins to different nuclear and cytoplasmic pathways of ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (reviewed in Ref. 10Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). Many proteins that are ubiquitinated and degraded by the 26 S proteasome have a functional NLS. These proteins can be degraded in the cytoplasm or nucleus. For example, the tumor suppressor protein p53 is believed to be initially monoubiquitinated when it enters the nucleus but only fully ubiquitinated and degraded after it leaves the nucleus and returns to the cytoplasm. In contrast, the Far1 protein is ubiquitinated and degraded in the nucleus (reviewed in Ref. 10Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). Both nuclear and cytoplasmic pathways degrade some proteins, such as the MyoD transcription factor (11Lingbeck J.M. Trausch-Azar J. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1817-1823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Although Rac1 is ubiquitinated and subjected to proteasomal degradation (12Senadheera D. Haataja L. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2001; 8: 127-133PubMed Google Scholar, 13Doye A.

Immun. 2002; 70: 4053-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), it is not known where these events occur in the cell. Most studies indicate that it is the activated, GTP-bound forms of Rac that are specifically ubiquitinated and degraded (13Doye A. Mettouchi A. Bossis G. Clement R. Boisson-Touati C. Flatau G. Gagnoux L. Piechaczyk M. Boquet P. Lemichez E. Cell. 2002; 111: 553-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 14Lerm M. Pop M. Fritz G. Aktories K. Schmidt G. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 4053-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The GTP-bound forms of Rac, but not the GDP-bound forms, associate with proteins that are members of several different E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, including the anaphase-promoting complex (also known as APC/C) (12Senadheera D. Haataja L. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2001; 8: 127-133PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins that are ubiquitinated by APC/C often have a consensus sequence known as the “destruction box” or “D-box,” which consists of the sequence RXXL (reviewed in Ref. 15Castro A. Vigneron S. Bernis C. Labbe J.-C. Lorca T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4126-4138Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, we observed evolutionary conservation of canonical D-box sequences at the C termini of Rac proteins, as well as Rho proteins (Table I). Based on the observation that Rac1 activation enhances both its nuclear entry (8Lanning C.C. Ruiz-Velasco R. Williams C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12495-12506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and its proteasome-mediated degradation (13Doye A. Mettouchi A. Bossis G. Clement R. Boisson-Touati C. Flatau G. Gagnoux L. Piechaczyk M. Boquet P. Lemichez E. Cell. 2002; 111: 553-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 14Lerm M. Pop M. Fritz G. Aktories K. Schmidt G. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 4053-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the nuclear entry of Rac1 promotes its proteasome-mediated degradation. If Rac1 is targeted for degradation in the nucleus, then blocking the nuclear entry of Rac1 should prevent its degradation. A similar line of reasoning was used to demonstrate the nuclear degradation of Far1 (16Blondel M. Galan M. Chi Y. Lafourcade C. Longaretti C. Deshaies R. Peter M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6085-6097Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To test this prediction, we designed a mutant Rac1 protein in which the Rac1 PBR is replaced with the RhoA PBR, which lacks a functional NLS (8Lanning C.C. Ruiz-Velasco R. Williams C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12495-12506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We show that this Rac1 mutant, which is named Rac1(pbrRhoA), has greater cytoplasmic localization and significantly elevated protein levels compared with Rac1. Inhibition of proteasome activity increases the protein level of Rac1 to the level of Rac1(pbrRhoA), indicating that Rac1 is more susceptible than Rac1(pbrRhoA) to proteasome-mediated degradation. The cytoplasmic localization of Rac1(pbrRhoA) provides the most obvious reason for its resistance to proteasome-mediated degradation, because Rac1(pbrRhoA) does not greatly differ from Rac1 in its ability to stimulate membrane ruffling or to interact with SmgGDS and IQGAP1-calmodulin complexes. Furthermore, we show that mutation of the D-box from RAVL to AAVA (aa 174-177) significantly elevates the protein levels of Rac1 but not Rac1(pbrRhoA). Taken together, these results support the model that nucleocytoplasmic shuttling directs Rac1, and potentially other NLS-containing GTPases, to proteasome-mediated degradative pathways located in the nucleus. cDNA Constructs—cDNA inserts were placed in the HA-pcDNA3.1 vector or Myc-pcDNA3.1 vector (8Lanning C.C. Ruiz-Velasco R. Williams C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12495-12506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) or pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech) to express proteins with an N-terminal tag consisting of the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope, Myc epitope, or green fluorescent protein (GFP), respectively (8Lanning C.C. Ruiz-Velasco R. Williams C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12495-12506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of the inserts was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The Myc-SmgGDS construct encoding SmgGDS (isoform 2; NCBI Protein Data Base accession number AAA21876) with an N-terminal Myc epitope tag was described previously (8Lanning C.C. Ruiz-Velasco R. Williams C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12495-12506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Constructs encoding either Rac1, constitutively active CA-Rac1 containing a valine substitution at aa 12, or dominant negative DN-Rac1 containing an asparagine substitution at aa 17 were obtained from the Guthrie cDNA Resource Center (www.cDNA.org). To generate the Rac1(pbrRhoA), CA-Rac1(pbrRhoA), and DN-Rac1(pbrRhoA) constructs, the PVKKRKRK sequence at aa 181-188 of Rac1 was replaced with RRGKKKSG, which is the sequence corresponding to the RhoA PBR (aa 182-189 in RhoA) (Fig. 1A). We previously described the Rac1(pbrQ), CA-Rac1(pbrQ), and DN-Rac1(pbrQ) constructs, in which glutamines replace the lysines and arginines in the Rac1 PBR (aa 183-188), as depicted in Fig. 1A (8Lanning C.C. Ruiz-Velasco R. Williams C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12495-12506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Constructs encoding either RhoA, constitutively active CA-RhoA containing a valine substitution at aa 14, or dominant negative DN-RhoA containing an asparagine substitution at aa 19 were also obtained from the Guthrie cDNA Resource Center. To generate the RhoA(pbrRac1), CA-RhoA(pbrRac1), and DN-RhoA(pbrRac1) constructs, the RRGKKKSG sequence at aa 182-189 of RhoA was replaced with PVKKRKRK, which is the sequence corresponding to the Rac1 PBR (aa 181-188 in Rac1) (Fig. 1B). We previously described the RhoA(pbrQ), CA-RhoA(pbrQ), and DN-RhoA(pbrQ) constructs, in which glutamines replace the lysines and arginines in the RhoA PBR (aa 182-187), as depicted in Fig. 1B (8Lanning C.C.

Culture and Transfection of Cells—CHO-m3 cells are Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with the M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. These cells, which do not exhibit differences from parental CHO-K1 cells in the absence of muscarinic agonist, were cultured as previously described (8Lanning C.C. Ruiz-Velasco R. Williams C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12495-12506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The A7r5 line of rat aortic smooth muscle cells, and the COS-7 line of monkey kidney cells, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing fetal bovine serum (10%), HEPES (1%), nonessential amino acids (1%), glutamine (0.3 μg/ml), penicillin (20 units/ml), and streptomycin sulfate (20 μg/ml). The cells were transfected with cDNAs by electroporation in Ham's F-12 medium (for CHO-m3 cells) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (for A7r5 or COS-7 cells) using a BTX Electro Square Porator (Genetronics, Inc., San Diego, CA) (8Lanning C.C. Ruiz-Velasco R. Williams C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12495-12506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Intracellular Localization of Proteins—Cells expressing GFP-tagged proteins were examined by fluorescence microscopy while the cells were still alive or after fixation with 3% formaldehyde (8Lanning C.C. Ruiz-Velasco R. Williams C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12495-12506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Digital images of the cells were collected from a Nikon Optiphot fluorescence microscope using a Kodak DC 290 zoom digital camera and Adobe Photoshop software. To quantify nuclear localization of the GFP-tagged proteins, in each experiment investigators ranked the nuclear localization of proteins in at least 20 different cells transfected with the same cDNA, the identity of which was unknown to the investigators. The nuclear accumulation of a GFP-tagged protein was ranked on a scale of 1-5, in which 1 equals none of the tagged protein in the nucleus, 3 equals equal amounts of the tagged protein in the nucleus and cytoplasm, and 5 equals all of the tagged protein in the nucleus (8Lanning C.C. Ruiz-Velasco R. Williams C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12495-12506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of Transiently Expressed Proteins—These assays were performed as described by Lanning et al. (8Lanning C.C. Ruiz-Velasco R. Williams C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12495-12506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The cells were electroporated with cDNAs, cultured in complete medium for 3 h, and then cultured for 16 h in labeling medium containing [35S]methionine. Equal numbers of cells were lysed in buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The lysates were centrifuged (13,000 × g, 10 min, 4 C), and the resulting supernatants were immunoprecipitated using the 9E10 Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or HA antibody (Covance). The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Immunoprecipitation of Proteins Translated in Vitro—Constructs encoding an HA-tagged GTPase or Myc-SmgGDS were individually transcribed and translated in the presence of [35S]methionine using the TnT reticulocyte lysate system (Promega), following the manufacturer's protocol. A reaction mixture containing an HA-tagged GTPase was mixed 1:1 with a reaction mixture containing Myc-SmgGDS. After incubation for 1 h at 30 °C, one-fifth of the volume of each sample was collected for SDS-PAGE and autoradiography to detect the translated proteins. The remaining volume of each sample was immunoprecipitated with HA antibody and subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (8Lanning C.C. Ruiz-Velasco R. Williams C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12495-12506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In control samples, the HA-pcDNA3.1 and Myc-pcDNA3.1 vectors replaced constructs encoding the HA-tagged GTPase and Myc-tagged SmgGDS, respectively. Enhanced Chemiluminescence Western Blotting—The cells were electroporated with cDNAs and cultured for 3 h in the absence of drugs. These electroporated cells, or nonelectroporated cells, were then cultured in the absence or presence of 10 μm MG-132 or 20 μm lactacystin for 20 h. Equal numbers of cells were suspended in Nonidet P-40 buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (8Lanning C.C. Ruiz-Velasco R. Williams C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12495-12506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and incubated for 20 min on ice with periodic vortexing. To generate whole cell lysates, the cells suspended in Nonidet P-40 buffer were mixed directly with an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer. To generate soluble cell extracts, the cells suspended in Nonidet P-40 buffer were centrifuged (13,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) to generate a supernatant and pellet. The supernatant was collected as the soluble cell extract and mixed with an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer. After SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and immunoblotted using doubling dilutions of antibody to HA (Covance), Rac1 (Transduction Labs), RhoA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or actin (Sigma). Bound antibodies were visualized by ECL (8Lanning C.C. Ruiz-Velasco R. Williams C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12495-12506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The nuclear proteins are solubilized by these cell lysis techniques, as indicated by our ability to detect the nuclear protein RCC1 in ECL-Western blots of both the soluble cell extracts and whole cell lysates (data not shown). FACS Analysis—CHO-m3 cells were electroporated with pEGFP-C1 (as a control) or with constructs encoding GFP-tagged GTPases and cultured for 24 h. The live cells were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm EDTA and analyzed for GFP fluorescence using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACSCaliber, Becton-Dickinson). Switching the PBRs between Rac1 and RhoA Alters Their Nuclear Accumulation—We previously reported that mutant Rac1(pbrQ) proteins, in which neutral glutamines replace the positively charged lysines and arginines in the Rac1 PBR (Fig. 1A), have less nuclear accumulation than Rac1 proteins (8Lanning C.C. Ruiz-Velasco R. Williams C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12495-12506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Because this glutamine substitution destroys both the positive charge and the specific order of aa within the PBR, it was not determined whether it is the charge or the order of aa in the PBR that promotes Rac1 nuclear accumulation. To address this question, we generated cDNA constructs encoding Rac1 (pbrRhoA) proteins, in which the Rac1 PBR is replaced with the RhoA PBR, as depicted in Fig. 1A. This replacement results in a mutant Rac1(pbrRhoA) protein that still has a positively charged PBR but no longer has the canonical NLS sequences (KKRK and KRKR) found in the wild type Rac1 PBR. To examine the effects of the activation states of the GTPases, constructs encoding constitutively active and dominant negative forms of the GTPases were also generated (Fig. 1A). Transient expression of the GFP-tagged Rac1 and Rac1(pbrRhoA) proteins in CHO-m3 cells indicated that there is significantly less nuclear accumulation of the Rac1(pbrRhoA) proteins than their Rac1 counterparts possessing a normal PBR (Fig. 1, C and D). Thus, a specific PBR sequence, rather than the positive charge of the PBR, is required for Rac1 nuclear accumulation. The PBR sequence that is required for Rac1 nuclear accumulation is most likely KKRKR, because it contains the canonical NLS sequences KKRK and KRKR. Although GFP-tagged CA-Rac1(pbrRhoA) exhibits reduced nuclear accumulation, it still induces the formation of membrane ruffles and accumulates in these structures (Fig. 1C, panel 6), similar to the responses induced by GFP-tagged CA-Rac1 (Fig. 1C, panel 5). Thus, replacement of the Rac1 PBR with the RhoA PBR does not prevent Rac1(pbrRhoA) from participating in signaling pathways leading to membrane ruffling. We also examined the intracellular localization of GFP-tagged RhoA(pbrRac1) proteins in which the RhoA PBR is replaced with the Rac1 PBR, as depicted in Fig. 1B. This replacement results in a mutant RhoA(pbrRac1) protein that possesses the canonical NLS sequences (KKRK and KRKR) found in the wild type Rac1 PBR. The GFP-tagged RhoA(pbrRac1) proteins exhibit significantly greater nuclear accumulation than their GFP-tagged RhoA counterparts possessing a normal PBR (Fig. 1, C and E). Thus, the Rac1 PBR acts as a potent NLS for RhoA(pbrRac1) proteins. We also examined the distributions of the GTPases in living COS-7 kidney cells (Fig. 2, A and B) and A7r5 smooth muscle cells (Fig. 2, C and D). The distributions of the GFP-tagged Rac1(pbrRhoA) and RhoA(pbrRac1) proteins in these cells (Fig. 2) are similar to their distributions in CHO-m3 cells. The Rac1(pbrQ) proteins, which have neutral PBRs because of glutamine substitutions (Fig. 1A), exhibit significantly reduced nuclear accumulation in COS-7 cells (Fig. 2, A and B) and A7r5 cells (Fig. 2, C and D), similar to their reduced nuclear accumulation in CHO-m3 cells (8Lanning C.C. Ruiz-Velasco R. Williams C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12495-12506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The CA-Rac1(pbrQ) protein does not induce membrane ruffling in COS-7 cells (Fig. 2A, panel 6) and A7r5 cells (Fig. 2C, panel 6). In contrast, membrane ruffling is induced by both CA-Rac1 and CA-Rac1(pbrRhoA) in COS-7 cells (Fig. 2A, panels 4 and 5) and A7r5 cells (Fig. 2C, panels 4 and 5). Switching the PBRs between Rac1 and RhoA Alters Their Interactions with SmgGDS—We compared the protein interactions of HA-Rac1 and HA-Rac1(pbrRhoA) in 35S-labeled CHO-m3 cells co-expressing Myc-tagged SmgGDS. Immunoprecipitation of the HA-tagged GTPases (Fig. 3A) or Myc-SmgGDS (Fig. 3, B and C) indicated that Myc-SmgGDS co-precipitates strongly with both HA-DN-Rac1 and HADN-Rac1(pbrRhoA) (lanes 4 and 5). Shorter exposures of the autoradiographs revealed that Myc-SmgGDS forms only slightly less stable complexes with HA-DN-Rac1(pbrRhoA) than with HA-DN-Rac1 (Fig. 3C, lanes 4 and 5). These results indicate that replacing the Rac1 PBR with the RhoA PBR only moderately diminishes the stability of the complexes formed between Rac1 and SmgGDS. IQGAP1-calmodulin complexes associate strongly with both HA-CA-Rac1 and HA-CA-Rac1(pbrRhoA) (Fig. 3A, lanes 6 and 7), in agreement with our previous report that IQGAP1-calmodulin complexes preferentially associate with activated Rac1 (17Ruiz-Velasco R. Lanning C.C. Williams C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 277: 33081-33091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus, the PBR switch does not inhibit the ability of Rac1(pbrRhoA) to interact with IQGAP1-calmodulin complexes. We also examined the interactions of the RhoA(pbrRac1) proteins with SmgGDS (Fig. 3, D-F). Significantly greater amounts of Myc-SmgGDS associate with HA-RhoA than with HA-RhoA(pbrRac1) (Fig. 3, D-F, lanes 2 and 3). Shorter exposures of the autoradiographs revealed that Myc-SmgGDS also forms more stable complexes with HA-DN-RhoA than with HA-DN-RhoA(pbrRac1) (Fig. 3F, lanes 4 and 5). These results indicate that replacing the RhoA PBR with the Rac1 PBR significantly diminishes the ability of RhoA(pbrRac1) to associate with SmgGDS.

https://openalex.org/W2113426999,"Barth syndrome is a genetic disorder that is caused by different mutations in the TAZ gene G4.5. The yeast gene TAZ1 is highly homologous to human TAZ, and the taz1Δ mutant has phospholipid defects similar to those observed in Barth syndrome cells, including aberrant cardiolipin species and decreased cardiolipin levels. Subcellular fractionation studies revealed that Taz1p is localized exclusively in mitochondria, which supports the theory that tafazzins are involved in cardiolipin remodeling. Because cardiolipin plays an important role in respiratory function, we measured the energy transformation and osmotic properties of isolated mitochondria from the taz1Δ mutant. Energy coupling in taz1Δ mitochondria was dependent on the rate of oxidative phosphorylation, as coupling was diminished when NADH was used as a respiratory substrate but was unaffected when ethanol was the substrate. Membrane stability was compromised in taz1Δ mitochondria exposed to increased temperature and hypotonic conditions. Mitochondria from taz1Δ also displayed decreased swelling in response to ATP, which induces the yeast mitochondrial unspecific channel, and to alamethicin, a membrane-disrupting agent. Coupling was measured in taz1Δ cells containing different splice variants of the human TAZ gene. Only the variant that restores wild type cardiolipin synthesis (lacking exon 5) restored coupling in hypotonic conditions and at elevated temperature. These findings may shed light on the mitochondrial deficiencies observed in Barth syndrome. Barth syndrome is a genetic disorder that is caused by different mutations in the TAZ gene G4.5.

Barth syndrome is a severe X-chromosome linked genetic disorder characterized by cardiac and skeletal myopathy, neutropenia, abnormal mitochondria, and increased levels of 3-methylglutaconic acid in the urine (1Barth P.G.

The disorder is often associated with growth retardation and has a high rate of mortality in childhood because of cardiac failure or sepsis arising from agranulocytosis. The lipid composition of cells from patients with Barth syndrome showed a dramatic decrease in cardiolipin (CL) 1The abbreviations used are: CL, cardiolipin; FCCP, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone; WT, wild type.1The abbreviations used are: CL, cardiolipin; FCCP, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone; WT, wild type. levels and reduced incorporation of linoleic acid (18:2) into CL and its precursor phosphatidylglycerol (4Vreken P.

In addition, tetralinoleoyl-CL (L4-CL), the most predominant CL species in mitochondria from normal skeletal and heart muscle, is almost completely absent in Barth syndrome, whereas the concentration and the fatty acyl patterns of other phospholipids are normal (5Schlame M.

Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 560-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the gene responsible for Barth syndrome, G4.5, suggested that it encodes a putative acyltransferase involved in phospholipid biosynthesis (8Neuwald A.F. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R465-R466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recent findings indicate that the TAZ gene encodes a transacylase (9Xu Y. Kelley R.I. Blanck T.J. Schlame M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51380-51385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that the TAZ gene is involved in CL remodeling. The yeast open reading frame YPR140w (TAZ1) is highly homologous to G4.5, and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae taz1Δ mutant has defects similar to those found in Barth syndrome fibroblasts, including reduced CL levels and decreased CL species containing unsaturated fatty acids (10Gu Z.

Barth P.G. Wanders R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43089-43094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In addition, the putative intermediate of CL remodeling, monolyso-CL, accumulates in the taz1Δ mutant (10Gu Z. Valianpour F. Chen S. Vaz F. Hakkaart G.A. Wanders R.J.A. Greenberg M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 11Vaz F.M. Houtkooper R.H. Valianpour F. Barth P.G. Wanders R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43089-43094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Therefore, the taz1Δ mutant provides an excellent model to study CL remodeling and Barth syndrome. CL, the unique dimeric phospholipid in the mitochondrial inner membrane of eukaryotic cells, plays an important role in mitochondrial function (12Schlame M. Rua D. Greenberg M.L. Prog. Lipid Res. 2000; 39: 257-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 13Koshkin V. Greenberg M.L. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 687-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 14Koshkin V. Greenberg M.L. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). CL is more unsaturated than the other membrane phospholipids. The origin of the CL-specific acyl pattern is not understood and could potentially be explained by substrate preference in CL de novo synthesis or by remodeling of newly synthesized molecules through a deacylation-reacylation cycle (15Schlame M. Rustow B. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The accumulation of monolyso-CL in the taz1Δ mutant supports the latter possibility. The prediction that tafazzins are involved in CL remodeling strongly suggests that Taz1p is a mitochondrial protein. The subcellular localization of Taz1p in this study shows that the yeast tafazzin is exclusively localized in mitochondria. Previous studies have shown that CL is essential for optimal performance of the mitochondrial energetic machinery and the stability of the mitochondrial membrane in unfavorable conditions (13Koshkin V. Greenberg M.L. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 687-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 14Koshkin V. Greenberg M.L. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Because CL plays an important role in bioenergetic coupling, we hypothesized that the taz1Δ mutant may exhibit bioenergetic defects. To this end, we characterized the energy transformation and osmotic properties of mitochondria from the taz1Δ mutant and show in this study that the mutant is defective in all parameters tested. These defects are complemented by expression of the human TAZ gene cDNA, specifically the variant lacking exon 5 (11Vaz F.M. Houtkooper R.H. Valianpour F. Barth P.G. Wanders R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43089-43094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). These studies have implications for understanding the cellular defects in Barth syndrome. Yeast Strains—The S. cerevisiae strains used in this work are FGY3 (wild type, MATα, ura3–52, lys2–52, lys2–801, ade2–101, trp1-Δ1, his3-Δ200, leu2-Δ1), ZGY1 (isogenic with FGY3 except for taz1::KanMX4), and FGY2 (isogenic with FGY3 except for crd1::URA3) (16Jiang F. Rizavi H.S. Greenberg M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The yeast taz1Δ strains in the W303 background containing splice variants of the human TAZ gene are described elsewhere (11Vaz F.M. Houtkooper R.H. Valianpour F. Barth P.G. Wanders R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43089-43094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). ZGY1 was constructed as follows. The entire open reading frame of TAZ1 was replaced by the KanMX4 marker using a PCR-mediated one-step gene replacement strategy (17Lorenz M.C. Muir R.S. Lim E. McElver J. Weber S.C. Heitman J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 158: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The KanMX4 cassette was amplified from pRS400 using primers Kan1 (ATGTCTTTTAGGGATGTCCTAGAAAGAGGAGATGAATTTTTAGAAGCCTAgcgtacgctgcaggtcgac) and Kan2 (TCAATCATCCTTACCCTTTGGTTTACCCTCTGGAGGCAGAAACTTTTGatcgatgaattcgagctcg), consisting of 50-nucleotide and 48-nucleotide sequences identical to the TAZ1 flanking regions at the 5′ ends (capital letters) and 19 nucleotides of sequence specific for the amplification of the KanMX4 marker gene at the 3′ ends (small letters) of each primer. The PCR product was purified and transformed into strain FGY3 (16Jiang F. Rizavi H.S. Greenberg M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and transformants were selected on G418-containing agar plates. The presence of a KanMX4 module instead of TAZ1 was verified by PCR analysis using primers specific for this module, namely kanC (TGATTTTGATGACGAGCGTAAT) and kanB (CTGCAGCGAGGAGCCGTAAT) in combination with primers specific for the flanking regions of TAZ1, TazB (GGAGCTACTTCTTTCACGCCAGG), and TazC (GACATATACCGTTCAGGAACTC) (data not shown). To confirm the disruption by Southern blot analysis, genomic DNA was extracted from wild type and putative taz1Δ mutant cells constructed as described above, and approximately 50 μg of genomic DNA from both strains were digested overnight with NdeI and resolved on a 0.8% (w/v) agarose gel, which was hybridized with a radiolabeled riboprobe complementary to the region upstream of the TAZ1 coding sequence (data not shown).

Integrity of the insert was verified by DNA sequencing. This construct was transformed into taz1Δ and expressed as described previously (11Vaz F.M. Houtkooper R.H. Valianpour F. Barth P.G.

Academic Press, San Diego, CA1991: 662-674Google Scholar) and lysed in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.6 m sorbitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm KCl. A postnuclear supernatant was produced by centrifugation of the homogenate at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and this was centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting organelle pellet was dissolved in 1 ml of the same buffer used for spheroplast lysis and subfractionated by equilibrium density gradient centrifugation in a linear Nycodenz gradient as described previously (19Wanders R.J. van Roermund C.W. Schor D.S. ten Brink H.J. Jakobs C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1227: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of total homogenate, organelle pellet, cytosol, and gradient fractions was performed using a polyclonal His tag antibody (BD Biosciences). Citrate synthase, NADPH-dependent cytochrome c reductase, and phosphoglucoisomerase were used as markers for mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and cytosol, respectively. The activities of the marker enzymes were determined as described previously (20Wanders R.J. van Roermund C.W. de Vries C.T. van den Bosch H. Schrakamp G. Tager J.M. Schram A.W. Schutgens R.B. Clin.

Growth of Cells—Yeast cultures were grown in liquid complex medium containing yeast extract (1%), peptone (2%), and glycerol (3%) plus ethanol (1%) (YPGE) as described previously (10Gu Z. Valianpour F. Chen S. Vaz F. Hakkaart G.A. Wanders R.J.A. Greenberg M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Isolation of Mitochondria—Isolation of mitochondria was performed essentially as described (13Koshkin V. Greenberg M.L. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 687-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The medium used for isolation was 0.6 m mannitol, 20 mm Hepes, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, pH 7.0. The final mitochondrial pellet was suspended in the isolation medium at ∼10 mg of protein/ml. Oxidative Phosphorylation Assay—The basic buffer contained 0.6 m mannitol, 20 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. For oxidative phosphorylation assays, this was supplemented with respiratory substrate and 10 mm Pi. The respiration rate was measured with a Clark-type electrode as previously described (13Koshkin V. Greenberg M.L. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 687-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 14Koshkin V. Greenberg M.L. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) at 25 °C unless otherwise noted. In normal conditions, the oxygen consumption is proportional to the amount of ADP phosphorylated to ATP. Therefore, the rate of oxygen consumption after addition of ADP (state 3 respiration) is much higher than that after exhaustion of the added ADP (state 4 respiration). The ratio of the oxygen consumption in state 3 to that in state 4 is the respiratory control ratio. This ratio expresses the respiratory coupling index, which provides a measure of the integrity of the mitochondrial inner membrane. The phosphorylating capacity (ADP/oxygen ratio) of mitochondria was determined by measuring the amount of oxygen consumed after the addition of a known amount of ADP. Mitochondrial Swelling and Shrinking Assay—Mitochondrial swelling and shrinking were monitored by following the apparent absorbance at 540 nm (22Hunter Jr., F.E. Smith E.E. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 689-695Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar) with a Shimadzu spectrophotometer (UV-1601). Subcellular Localization of Taz1p—Because tafazzins are involved in the remodeling of the mitochondrial phospholipid cardiolipin, their most likely location is in the mitochondria. However, this has never been shown experimentally. To determine the subcellular localization of the yeast enzyme Taz1p, we transformed taz1Δ with a construct encoding a C-terminally His-tagged Taz1p, Taz1p-his, enabling immunological detection of the expressed protein. Expression of Taz1p-his in taz1Δ restored growth on glycerol/ethanol plates at 37 °C and completely normalized the cardiolipin profile (not shown) as was previously shown for the untagged Taz1p (11Vaz F.M. Houtkooper R.H. Valianpour F. Barth P.G. Wanders R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43089-43094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This demonstrates that the his-tag does not interfere with the localization and function of Taz1p. Initial analysis of the subcellular distribution of the expressed protein in this transformant showed that Taz1p-his is exclusively present in the particulate fraction (Fig. 1A). To determine the exact subcellular localization of Taz1p, the organelle fraction was loaded on a Nycodenz density gradient. When we analyzed the gradient fractions by immunoblot analysis using an anti-His antibody, the pattern of the immunoreactive material exactly corresponded to that of the mitochondrial marker enzyme citrate synthase, confirming the mitochondrial localization of Taz1p (Fig. 1, B and C). Defective Energetic Coupling in taz1Δ Mitochondria—Barth syndrome is characterized by abnormal mitochondrial morphology with impaired oxidative phosphorylation (1Barth P.G. Scholte H.R. Berden J.A. Van der Klei-Van Moorsel J.M. Luyt-Houwen I.E. Van't Veer-Korthof E.T. Van der Harten J.J. Sobotka-Plojhar M.A. J. Neurol.

Clarke J.T. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1994; 50: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To understand the effect of the taz1Δ mutation on mitochondrial bioenergetics, energetic coupling was measured in taz1Δ mitochondria. Previous studies showed that the absence of CL leads to a decrease in energetic coupling during fast respiration driven by NADH as substrate, suggesting that CL is essential for the enhanced coupling of accelerated oxidative phosphorylation (14Koshkin V. Greenberg M.L. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The rate of oxidative phosphorylation was modulated using NADH and ethanol as respiration substrates. In yeast mitochondria, the external respiratory substrate NADH was shown to provide the maximal capacity of energy transformation because of a higher activity of NADH dehydrogenase compared with other substrate dehydrogenases (24Ohnishi T. Kawaguchi K. Hagihara B. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 1797-1806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Manon S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1410: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). As seen in Tables I and II, the state 3 respiration rate is about 1.5-fold higher with NADH than with ethanol as substrate, and the uncoupled respiration rate is higher than the state 3 respiration rate. NADH-oxidizing mitochondria from the taz1Δ mutant showed an increased state 4 respiration rate and decreased ADP/oxygen and respiratory control ratios compared with the isogenic wild type. With ethanol as the substrate, taz1Δ mitochondria showed only moderate decreases in respiratory control ratio, whereas the ADP/oxygen ratio was similar to that of the wild type.Table IRespiration rates in NADH- and ethanol-oxidizing mitochondria (n = 15)StrainsRespiration rateNADH (2 mm) (Mean ± S.D.)Ethanol (25 mM) (Mean ± S.D.)V4V3V3 uncoupledV4V3V3 uncouplednmol O2/min/mg proteinWild type120 ± 24257 ± 61347 ± 8572 ± 12173 ± 34174 ± 39crd1Δ164 ± 46ap < 0.05 compared to wild type respiration with NADH and mutant respiration with ethanol.235 ± 59332 ± 6271 ± 14127 ± 38bp < 0.05 compared to wild type respiration with ethanol.145 ± 24taz1Δ191 ± 49ap < 0.05 compared to wild type respiration with NADH and mutant respiration with ethanol.270 ± 69365 ± 9674 ± 15137 ± 31bp < 0.05 compared to wild type respiration with ethanol.141 ± 30a p < 0.05 compared to wild type respiration with NADH and mutant respiration with ethanol.b p < 0.05 compared to wild type respiration with ethanol.

Open table in a new tab Defective Osmotic Stability in taz1Δ Mitochondria—The dynamics of mitochondrial matrix volume play an important role in the regulation of mitochondrial metabolism. Low amplitude swelling and shrinkage cycles of mitochondria are associated with changes in the respiration state (26Lehninger A. The Mitochondrion: Molecular Basis of Structure and Function. W. A. Benjamin, New York1964: 180-182Google Scholar). Many metabolic parameters, including respiratory rates, the redox state of cytochromes, and the ADP/ATP ratio are strongly affected by mitochondrial volume (27Halestrap A.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 973: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Although low amplitude swelling and shrinking cycles are normal responses to physiological changes, high-amplitude swelling leads to irreversible damage of the mitochondrial membrane (27Halestrap A.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 973: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). We wished to determine whether the taz1Δ mutation affected the response of mitochondria to altered tonicity. This was assessed by measuring the effects of tonicity on state 3-state 4 transition. The inner membrane of intact mitochondria is relatively impermeable to protons. However, in damaged mitochondria, the inner membrane permits protons to leak back to the matrix, enabling electron transport to continue without concomitant phosphorylation of ADP to ATP. These conditions of uncoupling can be detected by the absence of a transition from state 3 to state 4. Oxidative phosphorylation was measured in taz1Δ mitochondria in hypotonic (0.3 m mannitol) and isotonic (0.6 m mannitol) conditions. In isotonic conditions, wild type and mutant mitochondria exhibited an obvious transition from state 3 to state 4, which is indicative of coupled mitochondria (Fig. 2). Wild type mitochondria were also coupled in hypotonic conditions. In contrast, taz1Δ mitochondria exhibited a barely discernible state 3-state 4 transition in hypotonic conditions. Furthermore, following the addition of ADP, subsequent addition of the uncoupler FCCP to taz1Δ mitochondria induced only a slight increase in state 4 respiration. In crd1Δ mitochondria, which are completely deficient in CL, addition of uncoupler FCCP did not increase the respiration rate in state 4. These data indicated that mitochondria from taz1Δ mutant cells were uncoupled in hypotonic conditions. To determine the effect of mutation on swelling and shrinking, taz1Δ mitochondria were subjected to strongly hypotonic conditions (24-fold decrease in tonicity) followed by partial restoration of tonicity (to 0.1 m) with the addition of sucrose. Mitochondrial volume kinetics were monitored by following the change in apparent absorbance at 540 nm (22Hunter Jr., F.E. Smith E.E. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 689-695Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 3, upon the addition of sucrose mitochondria from wild type, crd1Δ, and taz1Δ cells all exhibited a fast, immediate shrinkage. However, only wild type mitochondria maintained continuous shrinkage for 5 min. In contrast, taz1Δ mitochondria shrank for only about 2 min and then gradually swelled. In crd1Δ mitochondria, shrinkage induced by the addition of sucrose lasted for less than 1 min and was followed by resumption of swelling. Therefore, taz1Δ mitochondria exhibited reduced shrinkage ability after hypotonic exposure to a degree intermediate between crd1Δ and wild type. Swelling of the mutant mitochondria was further assessed by increasing the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane in isotonic conditions. This was achieved by opening of the yeast mitochondrial unspecific channel with ATP or by permeabilization of the mitochondria with the pore forming antibiotic alamethicin. Mitochondrial swelling was monitored by the absorbance of mitochondrial suspensions at 540 nm (22Hunter Jr., F.E. Smith E.E. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 689-695Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Taz1Δ mitochondria exhibited defective swelling in response to ATP (Fig. 4) and to alamethicin (Fig. 5) as the change in optical density was less than in wild type mitochondria. These data indicate that the stretch capacity of the taz1Δ mitochondrial membrane is reduced.Fig. 5Defective alamethicin-induced swelling of taz1Δ mitochondria. Mitochondria from wild type (WT), crd1Δ, and taz1Δ cells (0.4 mg of protein/ml) were added to the basic reaction medium supplemented with 2 mm NADH. The arrow indicates the addition of 2 mm alamethicin. Absorbance was monitored at 540 nm. The figure shown is typical of five experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Effect of Temperature on taz1Δ Mitochondria—Oxygen consumption in mitochondria from the taz1Δ mutant was measured at 25 °C and 40 °C. At 25 °C, the respiration of mutant mitochondria was relatively well coupled, and the state 3-state 4 transition in the mutant was similar to that of the wild type (Fig. 6). However, at 40 °C, taz1Δ mitochondria did not exhibit a state 3-state 4 transition. The addition of the uncoupler FCCP did not induce an obvious increase in the oxygen consumption rate in taz1Δ in contrast to wild type, in which coupling was apparent even at 40 °C. Therefore, similar to the mitochondria from the crd1Δ mutant, the mitochondria from the taz1Δ mutant were completely uncoupled at high temperature. Exposure of wild type mitochondria to elevated temperature (40 °C) induced a slight swelling as indicated by a decrease in absorbance at 540 nm (Fig. 7). In the taz1Δ mutant, the extent of mitochondrial swelling was more pronounced than in wild type cells although less than that observed in the crd1Δ mutant (Fig. 7). This may explain the diminished energetic coupling in mitochondria from both taz1Δ and crd1Δ mutants exposed to elevated temperature (Fig. 6). Complementation of the Yeast taz1Δ Mutant with Human TAZ—Vaz et al. (11Vaz F.M. Houtkooper R.H. Valianpour F. Barth P.G. Wanders R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43089-43094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) reported that only one of several splice variants of the human TAZ gene, lacking exon 5, complemented the defective acylation phenotype and restored growth of the yeast taz1Δ mutant on glycerol/ethanol at 37 °C (11Vaz F.M. Houtkooper R.H. Valianpour F. Barth P.G. Wanders R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43089-43094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Fig. 8 shows that only the variant lacking exon 5 complemented the taz1Δ mutant defects in coupling and sensitivity of mitochondria to an elevated temperature. In hypotonic conditions, the state 3-state 4 transition is absent from the taz1Δ mutant (Fig. 8B, second column) but present in mutant cells expressing HTAZ-ex5 (fourth column) or the yeast TAZ1 gene (third column). The full-length human TAZ gene (sixth column) or the HTAZ-ex7 variant (fifth column) did not restore the state 3-state 4 transition. Similarly, the only human construct that complemented the defective coupling at elevated temperature was the HTAZ-ex5 (Fig. 8C, fourth column). Interestingly, all of the human splice variants tested (HTAZ-ex5, HTAZ-ex7, and HTAZ full-length) correctly localized to mitochondria as determined by density gradient centrifugation followed by immunoblot analysis using an anti-human TAZ antibody (results not shown). This strongly suggests that the lack of complementation observed in some splice variants is caused by the inability of the proteins to exert their function in CL remodeling, not by defective targeting to the mitochondria. The pathogenesis of Barth syndrome is not well understood, although alterations in mitochondrial ultrastructure and the respiratory chain have been identified (1Barth P.G. Scholte H.R. Berden J.A. Van der Klei-Van Moorsel J.M. Luyt-Houwen I.E. Van't Veer-Korthof E.T. Van der Harten J.J. Sobotka-Plojhar M.A. J. Neurol.

Dis. 1999; 22: 555-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Especially puzzling is the fact that the severity of symptoms is not strongly correlated with the nature of the TAZ gene mutation (1Barth P.G. Scholte H.R. Berden J.A. Van der Klei-Van Moorsel J.M. Luyt-Houwen I.E. Van't Veer-Korthof E.T. Van der Harten J.J. Sobotka-Plojhar M.A. J. Neurol. Sci. 1983; 62: 327-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 2Barth P.G.

C.): 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), indicating that the phenotype is dependent on multiple factors not yet identified. The yeast taz1Δ mutant provides an excellent model system in which to study the defects in Barth syndrome. This mutant has CL defects similar to those found in Barth syndrome fibroblasts, including reduced CL levels and decreased CL species containing unsaturated fatty acids (10Gu Z. Valianpour F. Chen S. Vaz F. Hakkaart G.A. Wanders R.J.A. Greenberg M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In this study, we determined the subcellular localization of Taz1p and characterized taz1Δ mitochondrial function with the ultimate goal of shedding light on the physiological defects in Barth syndrome. Although mitochondrial localization of tafazzins might be expected because of the exclusive presence of CL in mitochondria, this has never been demonstrated experimentally. Our results show that yeast TAZ1, the orthologue of the human TAZ gene, encodes a mitochondrial protein, which supports the hypothesis that tafazzins are involved in the remodeling of CL. The current study shows that taz1Δ mitochondria are defective with respect to bioenergetic coupling, membrane stability during elevated temperature and osmotic stress, and swelling in response to two different agents, ATP and alamethicin. In all parameters, the defect in taz1Δ was less severe than observed in crd1Δ, which is totally CL-deficient (16Jiang F. Rizavi H.S. Greenberg M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The taz1Δ mutant has reduced total CL, decreased unsaturated fatty acids in CL, and increased monolyso-CL. Any or all of these CL defects could be responsible for the observed deficiencies in mitochondrial function. In Barth syndrome, the concentrations of cytochromes c1+ c, b, and aa3 in the mitochondrial respiratory chain are diminished to 29, 47, and 64% of average control values (28Barth P.G. Wanders R.J. Vreken P. Janssen E.A. Lan J. Baas F. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1999; 22: 555-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), respectively. Moderately diminished respiratory rates for all substrates were also apparent in isolated intact skeletal muscle mitochondria (28Barth P.G. Wanders R.J. Vreken P. Janssen E.A. Lan J. Baas F. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1999; 22: 555-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Energetic uncoupling, defective mitochondrial stability, and decreased resistance to osmotic and temperature stress that we report here in the taz1Δ mutant are consistent with the bioenergetic defects in Barth syndrome. At least 12 possible mRNA splice variants may be produced from the human TAZ gene. Vaz et al. (11Vaz F.M. Houtkooper R.H. Valianpour F. Barth P.G. Wanders R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43089-43094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) reported that only the splice variant lacking exon 5 complemented the defective growth phenotype and altered the CL profile of the yeast taz1Δ mutant. Consistent with this, we found that only the variant lacking the exon 5 sequence restored the taz1Δ mutant mitochondrial coupling in hypotonic conditions and at elevated temperature in the taz1Δ mutant, further supporting the link between CL deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction. Complementation of mitochondrial dysfunction in the yeast taz1Δ mutant by the human TAZ cDNA illustrates the highly conserved function of the corresponding gene and underscores the power of the yeast model for understanding Barth syndrome. The pleiotropic defects associated with the taz1Δ mutation may help to explain the varying degrees of severity observed in Barth syndrome. For example, because taz1Δ mitochondria are hypersensitive to osmotic alterations, it is likely that the mutant phenotype would be exacerbated by mutations in genes that affect osmotic stress. The identification of synthetic lethal mutations in the taz1Δ background may shed light on this question. These experiments are in progress. We thank Dr. Craig N.

It has diverse roles in regulating embryonic development and homeostasis as well as in assisting viral infections (1Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar, 2Liu J. Thorp S.C. Med. Res. Rev. 2002; 22: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). HS is a highly sulfated polysaccharide consisting of 1→4-linked sulfated glucosamine and sulfated glucuronic/iduronic acid units. HS is initially synthesized as a copolymer of glucuronic acid and N-acetylated glucosamine by d-glucuronyl and N-acetyl-d-glucosaminyltransferase, followed by various modifications in the Golgi apparatus (3Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). These modifications include N-deacetylation and N-sulfonation of glucosamine, C5 epimerization of glucuronic acid to form iduronic acid units, 2-O-sulfonation of iduronic and glucuronic acid units, and 6-O-sulfonation and 3-O-sulfonation of glucosamine units. The specific sulfated saccharide sequences of HS determine its biological function (4Sasisekharan R. Shriver Z. Venkataraman G. Narayanasami U. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 521-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar).Infections caused by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) are highly prevalent in human and result in localized mucocutaneous lesions and, in rare cases, encephalitis (5Corey L. Spear P.G. N. Engl. J. Med. 1986; 314 (and 749-757): 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). HS plays critical roles in assisting HSV-1 infections in both viral attachment and entry steps (6Spear P.G. Eisenberg R.J. Cohen G.H. Virology. 2000; 275: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). In the attachment step, HSV-1 binds to the cells through the interactions of envelope glycoproteins gC or/and gB with cell surface HS (7Shukla D. Spear P.G. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Viral entry requires the interaction of a third viral glycoprotein, gD, with a specific cell surface entry receptor to induce fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane (in the presence of gB, gH, and gL) to establish an infection (8Spear P.G. Longnecker R. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 10179-10185Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). The 3-O-sulfated HS, representing the culmination of a series of specific sulfated saccharide sequences, binds to gD and serves as an entry receptor of HSV-1 (9Shukla D. Liu J. Blaiklock P.

Understanding the biosynthesis of 3-O-sulfated HS could potentially lead to a new strategy for developing therapeutic agents against HSV infection.HS 3-O-sulfotransferase is present in at least six different isoforms with unique expression patterns in human tissues (10Xia G.

The amino acid sequences of the different isoforms have greater than 60% homology in the sulfotransferase domains (12Shworak N.W. Liu J. Petros L.M. Zhang L. Kobayashi M. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5170-5184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). These different 3-OST isoforms transfer the sulfuryl group from 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) to the 3-OH position of glucosamine units residing within the context of different saccharide sequences. As a result, the HS products generated by these different isoforms exhibit unique and distinctive biological activities (Fig. 1A). It is known that the HS modified by 3-OST-1 and 3-OST-5 displays anticoagulant activity. The HS modified by 3-OST-3 and 3-OST-5 serves as an entry receptor for HSV-1 (9Shukla D. Liu J. Blaiklock P.

The structural information combined with the results of mutational analysis provided us with preliminary insight into the HS sulfotransferase mechanism (14Edavettal S.C. Lee K.A. Negishi M.

Furthermore, potential roles of specific amino acid residues from NST-1 and 3-OST-1 for directing the transfer of the sulfuryl group were suggested (14Edavettal S.C. Lee K.A. Negishi M. Linhardt R.J.

However, because these structures lacked acceptor substrate, they have provided limited knowledge to our understanding of what dictates HS binding, in particular, among the 3-OST isoforms.In this study, we report the crystal structure of a ternary complex of human 3-OST-3, PAP, and a tetrasaccharide substrate with the structure of ΔUA2S-GlcNS6S-IdoUA2S-GlcNS6S (for structure see Fig. 1B). This ternary complex structure, combined with the mutagenesis data presented here, reveals the residues involved in catalysis and in substrate binding. The data provide structural evidence for which residues confer substrate specificity between the 3-OST isoforms. These results present new insight into the biosynthesis of the HS with various biological functions ranging from viral infection to blood coagulation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression, Purification, and Crystallization of 3-OST-3Preparation of 3-OST-3 Bacterial Expression Plasmid—The cDNA fragment encoding the catalytic domain of 3-OST-3 (Gly139-Gly406) was amplified from plasmid h3-OST-3A-pcDNA3 (17Liu J.

This construct was inserted into the pGEX4T3 vector (Amersham Biosciences) using the EcoRI and NotI restriction sites to produce a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. The resultant plasmid was sequenced to confirm the reading frame and the lack of mutations within the coding region (University of North Carolina, DNA sequencing core facility). The plasmid was transformed into BL21(DE3)RIL cells (Stratagene).Protein Expression and Purification—Cells containing the expression plasmid were grown in twelve 2.8-liter Fernbach flasks containing 1 liter of LB medium with 100 μg/ml of ampicillin at 37 °C. When the A600 reached 0.6–0.8, the temperature was lowered to 22 °C for 15 min. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 200 μm, and the cells were allowed to shake overnight. The cells were pelleted and resuspended in 120 ml of sonication buffer (25 mm sodium/potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, and 625 mm NaCl). The cells were sonicated, and the cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation. The soluble fraction was loaded onto 20 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) resin in batch and washed repeatedly with sonication buffer. The catalytic domain of 3-OST-3 was cleaved from the fusion protein on the resin at 4 °C overnight using 400 units of thrombin in a total volume of 50 ml. PAP (Sigma) was added to the solution for a final concentration of 0.5 mm. The protein was concentrated to ∼35 mg/ml. Protein was further purified by a Superdex 75 16/60 (Amersham Biosciences) column. The eluted fractions containing pure 3-OST-3 were pooled. The buffer was exchanged with the crystallization buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm PAP) by repeated concentration and dilution. The final concentration of the protein was 10 mg/ml, and additional PAP was added for a final concentration of 4 mm.Protein Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Solution—Crystals of the catalytic domain of 3-OST-3 were obtained using the hanging drop method by mixing 2 μl of the above protein solution with 2 μl of the reservoir solution consisting of 12-13% polyethylene glycol 4000, 200 mm ammonium acetate, and 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5. For data collection, the crystals were transferred in four steps into a cryo-protectant consisting of 15% polyethylene glycol 4000, 12.5% ethylene glycol, 4 mm PAP, 200 mm ammonium acetate, 100 mm NaCl, and 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5. To obtain the ternary complex, the crystal was soaked overnight in cryo-protectant containing 20 mm of the tetrasaccharide. The crystals were frozen in liquid nitrogen and then placed in a stream of nitrogen gas cooled to –180 °C. The data were collected on a Rigaku RU3H generator fitted with Osmic mirrors and a Raxis IV area detector. The data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using HKL2000 (18Otwinowski Z. Minor V.

This construct was inserted into the pET28a vector (Novagen) using the NdeI and EcoRI restriction sites to produce a His6-tagged protein. The mutants were prepared using Gene Tailor site-directed mutagenesis kit from Invitrogen as described elsewhere (14Edavettal S.C. Lee K.A. Negishi M. Linhardt R.J. Liu J. Pedersen L.C. J. Biol.

To confirm that bacterial 3-OST-3 has similar activity to the protein expressed in SF9 cells, we conducted a kinetic analysis to determine the Km and Vmax toward PAPS and HS, respectively. The Km and Vmax toward PAPS of the 3-OST-3 expressed in Escherichia coli is 40 μm and 27 pmol of sulfate/min, respectively, which are close to the Km value (16 μm) and Vmax value (27 pmol of sulfate/min) of the 3-OST-3 expressed in SF9 cells. The Km and Vmax toward HS of the 3-OST-3 expressed in E. coli is 2.5 μm and 24 pmol of sulfate/min, respectively, which are close to the Km (1 μm) and Vmax (21 pmol of sulfate/min) of the 3-OST-3 expressed in SF9 cells.Expression and Purification of 3-OST-3 Mutants—The expression plasmids for various 3-OST-3 mutants were transformed individually into BL21(DE3)RIL cells (Stratagene). Each mutant construct was grown in 500 ml of LB broth and induced by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The bacteria were harvested and sonicated. The lysate was subjected to a 400-μl nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (0.75 cm × 1 cm), followed by 5 ml of wash with 10 mm imidazole, 25 mm Tris, and 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. Mutant proteins were eluted with 1 ml of elution buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, and 250 mm imidazole, pH 7.5. Approximately 25 μl of the eluent was subjected to the analysis on a 16.5% Tris-Tricine-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad), and the gel was stained by Coomassie Blue. The expression level of the mutant protein was estimated by determining the intensity of the Coomassie-stained protein band near 30 kDa. Wild type 3-OST-3 was expressed along with the mutants. The expression levels and the sulfotransferase activity of mutant proteins were normalized to those of wild type protein.Determination of the Sulfotransferase Activity—Sulfotransferase activity was determined by incubating ∼5 μl (10–100 ng) of purified mutant or wild type 3-OST-3 proteins with 10 μg of HS (from bovine kidney; ICN), 5 × 106 cpm of [35S]PAPS (∼10 μm) in 50 μl of buffer containing 50 mm MES, pH 7.0, 10 mm MnCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1% Triton X-100. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 60 min and quenched by the addition of 6 m urea and 100 mm EDTA. The sample was then subjected to 200-μl DEAE-Sepharose chromatography to purify the [35S]HS.Disaccharide Analysis of the HS Modified by Wild Type 3-OST-3 and 3-OST-3 Mutants—3-OST-3-modified HS was degraded with nitrous acid at pH 1.5, followed by reduction with sodium borohydride (24Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). The resultant 35S-labeled disaccharides were resolved by a C18 reversed phase column (0.46 × 25 cm) (Vydac) under reversed phase ion pairing HPLC conditions. The identities of the disaccharides were determined by coeluting with appropriate 35S-labeled disaccharide standards (25Liu J. Shriver Z. Blaiklock P. Yoshida K. Sasisekharan R. Rosenberg R.D. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 38155-38162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).Determination of 3-O-[35S]Sulfonation Site on the TetrasaccharideWe utilized a combination of the digestions of heparin lyase and Δ4,5-glycuronate-2-sulfatase to determine the 3-O-[35S]sulfonation site. The 3-O-[35S]sulfated tetrasaccharide was prepared by incubating 3-OST-3 enzyme, the tetrasaccharide, and [35S]PAPS. The resultant 3-O-[35S]sulfated tetrasaccharide was eluted from the anion exchange HPLC column at a salt concentration consistent with the introduction of one additional sulfo group. Heparin lyase cleaves the glycosidic bond between G3 and I2 of the 3-O-[35S]sulfated tetrasaccharide to yield two disaccharides, ΔUA2S-[3-35S]GlcNS3S6S and ΔUA2S-GlcNS6S (unlabeled) (illustrated in Fig. 5) (26Rice K.G. Linhardt R.J. Carbohydr. Res. 1989; 190: 219-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To this point, it is not possible to distinguish whether the 3-O-[35S]sulfo group was originally on the G3 or G1 unit of the original tetrasaccharide because the digestion would yield an identical 35S-labeled disaccharide for both cases. Pretreatment of 3-O-[35S]sulfated tetrasaccharide with Δ4,5-glycuronate-2-sulfatase, however, removes the 2-O-sulfo group from the U4 unit (27McLean M.W. Bruce J.S. Long W.F. Williamson F.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 145: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) to yield ΔUA unit at the nonreducing end (U4 unit). Subsequent treatment with heparin lyase (a mixture of heparin lyase I, II, and IV were used because of the reported resistance of small oligosaccharides to heparin lyases (26Rice K.G. Linhardt R.J. Carbohydr. Res. 1989; 190: 219-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar)) afforded the ΔUA-[3-35S]GlcNS3S6S consistent with the presence of the 3-O-[35S]sulfo group on the G3 residue, the 35S-labeled disaccharide with a structure of ΔUA2S-[3-35S]GlcNS3S6S would be obtained if the 3-O-[35S]sulfo group is on the G1 residue. The resultant disaccharides were identified by determining the elution positions on an anion exchange HPLC using an on-line radioactive detector.Fig. 5Anion exchange HPLC chromatograms of enzymatic digested and undigested 3-O-[35S]sulfated tetrasaccharide.

We noted that this 3-O-sulfated tetrasaccharide is resistant to nitrous acid (at pH 1.5) degradation.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONCrystal Analysis—Human 3-OST-3 crystallizes in space group C2221 and diffracts to 1.85 Å resolution. Two molecules were present in the asymmetric unit (molecules A and B), and each protein molecule contains one molecule of PAP. The crystals of 3-OST-3 are densely packed, generating a unit cell with a Matthews coefficient of 2.0 and an overall solvent content of 38.5% (28Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7902) Google Scholar). Both molecules in the asymmetric unit are well ordered and have similar B-factors (Table I). The data were collected on a similar crystal soaked in the tetrasaccharide at 1.95 Å. One of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit has clear electron density for the tetrasaccharide that allows for precise positioning. The other molecule has some electron density in the binding pocket region, but it is not clear enough to model.Table ICrystallographic data statisticsData set3-OST-3 and PAP3-OST-3 and tetrasaccharide and PAPUnit cella = 80.34, b = 155.39, c = 92.32a = 80.81, b = 154.53, c = 91.93α = β = γ = 90°α = β = γ = 90°Space groupC222(1)C222(1)Resolution (Å)50-1.8550-1.95Number of observations183,877160,766Unique reflections49,16042,327Rsym (%) (last shell)aRsym = Σ (Ii - 〈I〉)/Σ(Ii) where Ii is the intensity of the ith observation and 〈I〉 is the mean intensity of the reflection11.0 (29.7)5.4 (39.3)I/σ (I) (last shell)23.1 (3.5)18.2 (2.4)Mosaicity0.70.7Completeness (%) (last shell)99.3 (99.1)99.9 (99.4)Refinement statisticsRcryst (%)bRcryst = Σ∥Fo - Fc∥/Σ Fo calculated from working data set20.620.1Rfree (%)cRfree was calculated from 5% of data randomly chosen not to be included in refinement23.622.5Number of waters422333Average B values (Å)Protein29.127.9PAP20.217.9Tetrasaccharide43.1Root mean square deviation from ideal valuesdThe Ramachandran results were determined by MolProbity (35)Bond length (Å)0.0060.006Bond angle (°)1.21.2Dihedral angle (°)21.221.0Improper angle (°)0.870.79Ramachandran statisticsdThe Ramachandran results were determined by MolProbity (35)Residues in favored (98%) regions (%)97.5697.94Residues in allowed (>99.8%) regions (%)100100a Rsym = Σ (Ii - 〈I〉)/Σ(Ii) where Ii is the intensity of the ith observation and 〈I〉 is the mean intensity of the reflectionb Rcryst = Σ∥Fo - Fc∥/Σ Fo calculated from working data setc Rfree was calculated from 5% of data randomly chosen not to be included in refinementd The Ramachandran results were determined by MolProbity (35Lovell S.C.

At the core of the sphere is an α/β motif. This α/β motif is comprised of a five-stranded parallel β-sheet (β7-β6-β2-β5-β3), laterally flanked by α-helices. Central to this structural motif is the phosphosulfate-binding loop (K162-R166), contained within a strand-loop-helix comprised of β2 and α2 (29Negishi M. Pedersen L.G. Petrotchenko E. Shevtsov S. Gorokhov A. Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 390: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The phosphosulfate-binding loop allows for several strong hydrogen bonding interactions with the 5′-phosphate of PAP (Fig. 3 and Table II). These interactions are believed to help position the donor substrate, PAPS, in the precise location for catalysis (30Pedersen L.C. Petrotchenko E. Shevtsov S. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17928-17932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This binding site is well conserved with the previously reported 3-OST-1 and NST-1 (14Edavettal S.C.

The 5′-phosphate of PAP is found at the bottom of the large open cleft that provides the binding pocket for HS substrate (Figs. 2 and 3). A conserved α-helix (α5) composed of residues Ala244-Lys259 is positioned in close proximity to the PAP-binding site and protrudes outward into the open cleft. The C-terminal region of the protein contains a small three-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet (β8-β9-β10). The second and third strands of this sheet are structurally reinforced by a disulfide bond between residues Cys351 and Cys363. Strand 10 of this sheet is connected to the C-terminal α-helix (α11) via a long coil (Lys366-Arg377) that lies along one side of the open cleft, partially obscuring the PAP-binding site.Fig. 2Ribbon diagram of the crystal structure of ternary complex 3-OST-3/PAP (blue)/tetrasaccharide (green) and sequence alignment of human 3-OST-3 and mouse 3-OST-1. β-Strands and α-helices are colored purple and cyan, respectively.

It is well documented that two different types of α subunits can exist in a singles GABAA receptor complex. However, information on the abundance of such GABAA receptors is rather limited. Here we tested whether mice containing the His to Arg point mutation in the α1, α2, or α3 subunit at positions 101, 101, and 126, respectively, which render the respective subunits insensitive to diazepam, would be suitable to analyze this issue. Immunodepletion studies indicated that the His to Arg point mutation solely rendered those GABAA receptors totally insensitive to diazepam binding that contain two mutated α subunits in the receptor complex, whereas receptors containing one mutated and one heterologous α subunit not carrying the mutation remained sensitive to diazepam binding. This feature permitted a quantitative analysis of native GABAA receptors containing heterologous α subunits by comparing the diazepam-insensitive binding sites in mutant mouse lines containing one mutated α subunit with those present in mouse lines containing two different mutated α subunits. The data indicate that the α1α1-containing receptors with 61% is the most abundant receptor subtype in brain, whereas the α1α2 (13%), α1α3 (15%), α2α2 (12%), α2α3 (2%), and α3α3 combinations (4%) are considerably less expressed. Only within the α1-containing receptor population does the combination of equal α subunits (84% α1α1, 7% α1α2, and 8% α1α3) prevail, whereas in the α2-containing receptor population (46% α2α2, 36% α2α1, and 19% α2α3) and particularly in the α3-containing receptor population (27% α3α3, 56% α3α1, and 19% α3α2), the receptors with two different types of α subunits predominate.

Enhancement of neuronal inhibition by positive allosteric modulation of GABAA receptors via the benzodiazepine-binding site underlies the pharmacotherapy of several neurological and psychiatric disorders such as generalized anxiety disorders, sleep disturbances, and seizure disorders. GABAA receptors are pentameric transmembrane proteins build of different classes of subunits (α1–6, β1–3, γ1–3, ρ1–3, δ, ϵ, and θ) (1Barnard E.A. Skolnick P. Olsen R.W. Mohler H. Sieghart W.

The vast majority of GABAA receptors are composed of α, β, and γ2 subunits, where the α subunit variant determines the ligand binding characteristics of the benzodiazepine site of the various receptor subtypes. GABAA receptors containing the α1, α2, α3, or α5 subunit in combination with any β subunit and the γ2 subunit are the most abundant subtypes in the brain and mediate the modulatory actions of clinically used benzodiazepine site agonists, such as diazepam, flunitrazepam, and clonazepam (2Mohler H.

However, it is currently poorly understood to which degree receptors containing two heterologous α subunits contribute to diazepam-sensitive GABAA receptors. So far, the abundance of α1α2- and α1α3-containing receptors in the cerebral cortex and α1α5- and α2α5-containing receptors in the hippocampus have been estimated by sequential steps of immunoprecipitation and quantification of precipitated receptors by radioligand binding (6del Rio J.C.

This methodological approach is a demanding task and because of the amount of tissue required is hardly applicable to all brain regions. In addition, immunopurification studies are limited by the fraction of receptors that can be solubilized from the membranes. In the present paper an alternative experimental approach was used to overcome these experimental limitations. This method is based on the analysis by ligand binding studies of mutant mouse lines carrying a point mutation in the diazepam-sensitive α subunits. Because the diazepam sensitivity of GABAA receptors depends on the presence of a histidine residue in the drug-binding domain of the α subunits α1, α2, α3, and α5, they are rendered diazepam-insensitive when this histidine residue is replaced by arginine (4Wieland H.A.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This feature had been previously used to analyze the contribution of GABAA receptor subtypes to the diverse actions of diazepam. By generating mouse lines that contain the His to Arg (H/R) point mutation in the α1, α2, or α3 subunit, it was shown that sedation, anterograde amnesia, and most of the anticonvulsant activities are mediated by α1-containing receptors (16Rudolph U. Crestani F. Benke D. Brünig I. Benson J.A. Martin J.R. Bluethmann H. Mohler H. Nature. 1999; 401: 796-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar), whereas the anxiolytic like activity is mediated by α2-containing receptors (17Low K. Crestani F. Keist R. Benke D. Brunig I. Benson J.A. Fritschy J.M. Rulicke T. Bluethmann H. Mohler H. Rudolph U. Science. 2000; 290: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). Here we show that the different α(H/R) point-mutated mouse lines provide an opportunity to estimate the abundance of receptor populations containing two different types of α subunits in a receptor complex. Immunodepletion studies indicated that in α(H/R) mutant mouse lines only receptors containing two mutated α subunits fail to bind diazepam (e.g. α1(H101R) α3(H126R)), whereas receptors containing one mutated α subunit and one nonmutated heterologous α subunit (e.g. α1(H101R) α3) remain sensitive to diazepam binding. This permitted a detailed analysis on the presence and abundance of receptors containing either two homologous or two heterologous α subunits by comparing the proportion of diazepam-sensitive and diazepam-insensitive binding sites in wild type mice with the mouse lines containing a single type of mutated α subunit (α1H101R, α2H101R, or α3H126R) and newly crossbred mouse lines containing two different types of mutated α subunits (α1H101R α2H101R, α1H101R α3H126R, or α2H101Rα3H126R).

Membrane Preparation—Brain tissue from 8–12-week-old mice was homogenized in 10 volumes of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.32 m sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. Following recentrifugation of the supernatant for 20 min at 12,000 × g, the crude membrane pellet was washed three times with buffer and stored at –30 °C until used. Solubilization and Immunoprecipitation—For solubilization, the membranes were thawed and washed once with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 200 mg/liter bacitracin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.3 mg/liter aprotinin, 1 mm benzamidine and resuspended in the same buffer to a protein concentration of 5–7 mg/ml followed by addition of sodium deoxycholate to a final concentration of 0.5%. After incubation for 30 min at 4 °C, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 60 min at 100,000 × g. The supernatant was immediately used for immunoprecipitation experiments. For immunoprecipitation, aliquots (0.2–0.5 ml) of the deoxycholate extract were incubated with subunit-selective antiserum at concentrations leading to the maximum immunoprecipitation of the corresponding receptors overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with 50 μl of Pansorbin (suspension of 10% Staphylococcus aureus; Calbiochem) for 30–60 min at room temperature. After extensive washing, the precipitates were resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 200 mg/liter bacitracin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.3 mg/liter aprotinin, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.2% Triton X-100 for [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding. The specificity of immunoprecipitation was verified in competition experiments using the respective peptide antigen (50 μg/ml extract). No specific [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding was observed in the immunoprecipitate after co-incubation of the respective antiserum with the corresponding peptide antigen (data not shown). [3H]Ro 15-4513 Binding Experiments—For Scatchard analysis, crude mouse brain membranes were thawed and washed once with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and aliquots containing 100 μg of protein were incubated with increasing concentrations (0.5–70 nm) of [3H]Ro 15-4513 (24.3 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a total volume of 0.2 ml for 90 min on ice. Diazepam-insensitive binding sites were detected in parallel by inclusion of 10 μm diazepam in the incubation. Nonspecific [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding was assessed at each radioligand concentration by the addition of 10 μm flumazenil to the reaction. Incubation was stopped by rapid vacuum filtration on Whatman GF/C filters using a semiautomatic cell harvester (Skatron Instruments) and subjected to liquid scintillation counting. Diazepam displacement studies using immunoprecipitated GABAA receptors were performed by incubating aliquots of the washed immunoprecipitates with serial dilutions of diazepam at a fixed concentration of [3H]Ro 15-4513 (10 nm). After incubation for 90 min on ice, the reaction was stopped by addition of 4 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, followed immediately by rapid vacuum filtration on Whatman GF/C filters. The filters were washed three times with 4 ml of buffer and subjected to liquid scintillation counting. Nonspecific radioligand binding was determined by including 10 μm of flumazenil in parallel incubations. The binding data were analyzed using the program'KELL for Windows 6.0.5′ (Biosoft, UK). Diazepam Binding to GABAA Receptors in Point-mutated Mice Containing α1(H101R), α2(H101R), or α3(H126R) Subunits— Generation of mouse lines containing the H/R point mutation in the α1, α2, or α3 subunit resulted in an increase of diazepam-insensitive [3H]Ro 15-4513-binding sites with a brain regional distribution that corresponded to the expression pattern of the respective α subunit in wild type mice (16Rudolph U.

In α1(H101R) mice the increase in diazepam-insensitive binding sites, determined by Scatchard analysis (61 ± 3%) (16Rudolph U. Crestani F. Benke D. Brünig I. Benson J.A. Martin J.R. Bluethmann H.

However, the increase was considerably smaller than expected in the α2(H101R) and α3(H126R) mice. In α2(H101R) and α3(H126R) mice the number of diazepam-insensitive binding sites increased by 12 ± 0.1 and 4 ± 2% (17Low K. Crestani F. Keist R. Benke D. Brunig I. Benson J.A. Fritschy J.M.

This mismatch between the increase of diazepam-insensitive binding sites in the α2(H101R) and α3(H126R) mouse lines and the abundance of α2- and α3-containing receptor populations suggested that the receptors that contained the respective point-mutated subunit were not rendered fully insensitive to diazepam binding. To analyze this assumption, the respective α1(H101R)-, α2(H101R)-, and α3(H126R)-containing receptor populations were isolated by immunoprecipitation from deoxycholate extracts of whole brain membranes using subunit-selective antisera. The proportion of diazepam-sensitive and diazepam-insensitive [3H]Ro 15-4513-binding sites in the immunoprecipitated receptor populations was then determined by diazepam displacement of [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding. Interestingly, all of the receptor populations containing the point mutation displayed a high affinity diazepam-binding component corresponding to that of wild type receptors (Fig. 1). Whereas in α1(H101R)-containing receptors only 16 ± 1% remained diazepam-sensitive, 54 ± 10% of α2(H101R)-containing receptors and 73 ± 4% of α3(H126R)-containing receptors displayed diazepam-sensitive binding sites (Fig. 1 and Table II). This result demonstrates that at least some subpopulations of GABAA receptors containing the H/R mutation had retained diazepam-sensitive binding sites.Table IIProportion of diazepam-sensitive and diazepam-insensitive [3H]Ro 15-4513-binding sites in GABAA receptor populations immunoprecipitated with α subunit-selective antisera from brain extracts of the various single- and double-mutant mouse linesGenotypeDiazepam displacement of [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding to immunoprecipitation GABAA receptorsAntibody used for IPDiazepam-sensitive binding sitesDiazepam-insensitive binding sites% total% total% increaseaThe values are compared to the respective single mutants. % increase refers to the diazepam-insensitive binding sites present in the double-mutant receptor (e.g. α1(H101R) α2(H101R), precipitated with α1 antiserum: 91%) minus the diazepam-insensitive binding sites of the corresponding single-mutant receptors (α1(H101R): 84%).

Chem. 1993; 268: 3753-3757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the presence of high affinity diazepam binding in the mutated receptor populations is likely to be caused by the subpopulation of GABAA receptors containing a nonmutated heterologous α subunit (which is not α4 or α6) in the receptor complex that confers high affinity diazepam binding. To verify this hypothesis, brain extracts were immunodepleted in a sequential fashion to initially remove receptors containing the nonmutated α subunit (Fig. 2). For instance, from the brain extract of α2(H101R) mice α1-containing receptors were removed by quantitative immunoprecipitation followed by precipitation of the receptor population containing the α2 subunit and determination of diazepam-sensitive and diazepam-insensitive binding sites. If the diazepam-sensitive binding component in the mutated receptor population is due to a heterologous nonmutated α subunit in the receptor complex (e.g. α1 in α1α2(H101R)), the proportion of diazepam-insensitive binding sites will be increased after immunodepletion of these receptors because diazepam-sensitive binding sites are removed from the mutated receptor population. Indeed, in the brain extract from α2(H101R) mice immunodepletion of α1-containing receptors increased diazepam-insensitive binding in the α2(H101R)-containing receptor population from 46 ± 10 to 80 ± 6%, and immunodepletion of α3-containing receptors increased diazepam-insensitive binding to 62 ± 5% (Fig. 2). Likewise, depletion of α1- or α2-containing receptors increased diazepam-insensitive binding in α3(H126R)-containing GABAA receptors from 27 ± 4 to 76 ± 3% and 49 ± 14%, respectively (Fig. 2). Thus, the immunodepletion experiments demonstrate that the diazepam-sensitive binding sites present in the point-mutated receptor populations are due to the presence of a subfraction of receptors that contain a nonmutated heterologous α subunit. Proportion of Diazepam-insensitive [3H]Ro 15-4513 Binding in Double-mutant Mouse Lines—The observation that the remaining diazepam-sensitive binding in receptors containing a point-mutated α subunit is due to the presence of a nonmutated heterologous α subunit provides a means to estimate the abundance of receptors containing two different types of α subunits. As a prerequisite, mouse lines were generated by cross-breeding that contained the point mutation in two different α subunits, i.e. α1(H101R)α2(H101R), α1(H101R)α3(H126R), and α2(H101R)α3(H126R). The abundance of receptor subpopulations containing two heterologous α subunits was then estimated by comparing the proportion of diazepam-insensitive binding present in the membrane fractions of brains of double-mutant mice with the sum of diazepam-insensitive binding present in the corresponding single-mutant mice. Because in the double-mutant mice GABAA receptors containing the two distinct point-mutated α subunits (e.g. α1(H101R)α2(H101R)) are rendered in addition insensitive to diazepam binding (compared with the respective single-mutant mice), the amount of diazepam-insensitive binding sites is expected to be greater than the sum calculated from the corresponding single-mutant mice. Scatchard analysis of diazepam-sensitive and diazepam-insensitive [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding to crude membrane preparations of brains from the three double-mutant mouse lines revealed that the diazepam-insensitive binding sites exceeded the sum of diazepam-insensitive sites in the corresponding single-mutant mice (Table I). Whereas the sum of diazepam-insensitive sites in the single-mutant α1(H101R) and α2(H101R) mice together amounted to 73% of total [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding sites, the corresponding α1(H101R)α2(H101R) double-mutant mice expressed 86 ± 2% diazepam-insensitive binding sites. This fraction of 13% additional diazepam-insensitive binding present in the α1(H101R)α2(H101R) double-mutant mice compared with the sum of the respective single-mutant mice is likely to be accounted for by the α1(H101R)α2(H101R)-containing receptor population present in the double-mutant α1(H101R)α2(H101R) mice. Likewise, diazepam-insensitive sites in α1(H101R) and α3(H126R) mutant mice sum up to 65%, whereas 80 ± 5% were present in the α1(H101R)α3(H126R) double-mutant mice. This finding indicates that 15% of all diazepam-sensitive receptors in mouse brain contain the α subunit combination α1α3. However, in α2(H101R)α3(H126R) mice diazepam-insensitive binding sites were only marginally increased (2%) over the sum of the corresponding single mutants (α2(H101R) and α3(H126R)), indicating that receptors containing the α2α3 subunit combination are rarely expressed in mouse brain (Table I).Table IProportion of diazepam-insensitive [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding in crude membrane preparations of brains from the various single- and double-mutant mouse linesGenotypeDiazepam-insensitive [3H]Ro 15-4513 bindingPercentage of totalPercentage of increaseaPercentage of increase refers to the increase of diazepam-insensitive binding sites introduced by the point mutation (i.e. percentage of total mutant mice — percentage of total of wild type mice).Sum of increase in corresponding single mutantsbSum of increased diazepam-insensitive binding in the corresponding single-mutant mice.Fraction in double mutants exceeding sum of corresponding single mutantscFraction of diazepam-insensitive binding in double-mutant mice exceeding the sum of the corresponding single-mutant mice.

Open table in a new tab [3H]Ro 15-4513 Binding in Immuno-isolated GABAA Receptor Populations of Double-mutant Mice—To estimate the relative abundance of GABAA receptors containing two different types of α subunits within the α1-, α2-, or α3-containing receptor population, GABAA receptors were immunoprecipitated with the respective subunit-selective antisera from deoxycholate extracts of crude brain membranes derived from single-mutant mice (α1(H101R), α2(H101R), and α3(H126R)) as well as from double-mutant mice (α1(H101R)α2(H101R), α1(H101R)α3(H126R), and α2(H101R)α3(H126R)) and analyzed for the proportion of diazepam-sensitive and diazepam-insensitive binding. In all cases the diazepam-insensitive binding sites in the immunoprecipitates from double-mutant mice exceeded the sum of diazepam-insensitive sites in the immunoprecipitates of the corresponding single-mutant mice (Table II). Immunoprecipitation of α1-containing receptors from brain extracts of α1(H101R)α2(H101R) mice yielded 91 ± 7% diazepam-insensitive binding sites, which is 7% larger than the diazepam-insensitive sites from the corresponding single-mutant α1(H101R) (84 ± 1%; Table II). Likewise, immunoprecipitation of α2-containing receptors from brain extracts of α1(H101R)α2(H101R) mice resulted in 82 ± 7% diazepam-insensitive binding sites, which is 36% larger than the diazepam-insensitive sites from the corresponding single-mutant α2(H101R). This result suggests that the α1 receptor population comprises 7% α1α2-containing receptors, whereas the α2-containing receptor population includes 36% α1α2-containing receptors. A similar analysis on α1(H101R)α3(H126R) and α2(H101R)α3(H126R) mice indicated the presence of 8% of α1α3-containing receptors in the α1-containing receptor population, whereas the contribution of the α1α3 combination to the α3-containing receptor population was 56% (Table II). In addition, the proportion of α2α3-containing receptors was 19% in both the α2- and α3-containing GABAA receptor population. GABAA receptors are known to contain two α subunits that can be homologous or heterologous. If they are distinct they represent a different class of receptor subtype. In the present paper we studied the presence and abundance of GABAA receptors containing two different types of α subunits based on an analysis of mice containing the H/R point mutation in the α1, α2, or α3 subunit. This point mutation rendered the respective subunits insensitive to diazepam binding. Basis and Prerequisites—There are two prerequisites for using mouse lines containing the α(H/R) mutation for a quantitative analysis of GABAA receptors containing two different types of α subunits. First, the introduction of the point mutation should not affect the expression levels and the distribution of the mutated subunit as well as those of the nonmutated subunits. It was shown previously that expression and targeting of receptor subunits appear not to be affected by the point mutation. Mice containing the H/R mutation in the α1, α2, or α3 subunit expressed the mutated subunit at normal levels with unaltered expression patterns and did not induce up- or down-regulation of other GABAA receptor subunits to an appreciable extent (16Rudolph U. Crestani F. Benke D. Brünig I. Benson J.A. Martin J.R. Bluethmann H. Mohler H. Nature. 1999; 401: 796-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar, 17Low K. Crestani F. Keist R. Benke D.

Second, in receptors containing one mutated and one nonmutated α subunit, the nonmutated α subunit should confer diazepam-sensitive binding to the receptor complex. The first hint that mouse lines carrying the α(H/R) mutation fulfill this second requirement came from the observation that subfractions in all of the mutated GABAA receptor populations displayed at least some high affinity diazepam binding (Fig. 1). Subsequent immunodepletion studies indicated that the presence of a heterologous α subunit in the receptor complex that is not mutated (e.g. α1 in α1α3(H126R) or α2 in α2α3(H126R)) conferred sensitivity to diazepam binding (Fig. 2). This feature permitted an assessment of GABAA receptors containing two different α subunits using the various mouse lines carrying the a(H/R) mutation. However, the effect of the presence of a mutated α subunit together with a nonmutated α subunit in a single receptor complex on GABAA receptor function, i.e. pharmacology, is currently unknown. In particular, it is unclear whether the diazepam sensitivity observed in radioligand binding experiments to a mutated α subunit and a nonmutated α subunit reflects the ability of those receptors to functionally respond to diazepam. Abundance of GABAA Receptors Containing Two Different α Subunits—The data indicate that the α(H/R) point mutation solely rendered GABAA receptors fully insensitive to diazepam binding that contain two homologous mutated α subunits, whereas receptors containing one mutated α subunit and one nonmutated α subunit retained diazepam binding. This feature permitted an assessment of GABAA receptors containing two different types of α subunits by comparing the extent of diazepam-insensitive binding in the double-mutant mouse lines with that present in the corresponding single-mutant mice. The different receptor subpopulations are calculated by subtracting the sum of diazepam-insensitive binding sites present in the respective single mutated receptors (e.g. α1(H101R) plus α2(H101R)) from diazepam-insensitive binding sites present in the corresponding double-mutant mice (α1(H101R)α2(H101R)). This difference in diazepam-insensitive sites represents the amount of the respective receptors containing two different α subunits (e.g. α1α2-containing receptors). Two types of information were obtained from the experimental data: 1) Determination of the proportion of diazepam-sensitive and diazepam-insensitive binding to crude membrane preparations permitted the estimation of the size of GABAA receptor populations in brain containing the different α subunit combinations (Table I). This analysis is restricted to the diazepam-sensitive α1-, α2-, and α3-containing receptors expressed in brain, which, however, represent the vast majority of GABAA receptors (summarized in Table III). 2) Data on the presence of diazepam-sensitive and diazepam-insensitive binding sites in immuno-isolated GABAA receptors allowed an estimate on the abundance of the different α subunit combinations present within a particular GABAA receptor population (e.g. the α1α3 receptor combination in α1-containing receptors; Table II). The data obtained from this analysis are summarized in Table IV. Because the experimental data exhibit partially considerable standard deviation (Table II), the data are considered to represent a rough estimate of the receptor populations.Table IIISummary of the estimated abundance of diazepam-sensitive GABAA receptors containing different types of α subunits inwhole mouse brain membranesSubunit combinationTotal diazepam-sensitive receptor population%α1α161α2α212α3α34α1α213α1α315α2α32 Open table in a new tab Table IVSummary of the estimated abundance of GABAA receptors containing heterologous α subunits within the α 1, α 2, and α 3 receptor populations immunoprecipitated from whole brain extractsTotal receptor populationReceptor populationSubunit combinationCalculated from diazepam competition experimentsCalculated from immunodepletion experiments%α1-Containing receptor populationα1α184NDα1α27NDα1α38NDα2-Containing receptor populationα2α246α2α13634α2α31916α3-Containing receptor populationα3α327α3α15649α3α21922 Open table in a new tab With about 61%, the α1α1-containing receptor is by far the most abundant GABAA receptor subtype in brain, whereas α2α2- (12%) and α3α3-containing receptors (4%) are considerably less expressed (Table III). Interestingly, levels of α1α2-containing receptors (13%) are similar to that of α2α2-containing receptors and levels of α1α3-containing receptors (15%) are considerably higher than that of α3α3-containing receptors (4%; Table III). However, receptors containing the α2 and α3 subunit in a single receptor complex appear to be rarely expressed in relation to the total diazepam-sensitive GABAA receptor population (2%; Table III). Correspondingly, a similar distribution of the prevalence of the various α subunit combinations was detected within the α1-, α2-, and α3-containing receptor populations (Table IV). Again, the α1α1 combination (84%) predominated the α1α2 (7%) and α1α3 combinations (8%) in the α1-containing receptor population. Within the α2 receptor population the α2α2 (46%) and the α1α2 combination (36%) are expressed to a similar extent, whereas the α2α3 combination (19%) is less abundant. Finally, within the α3-containing receptor population, the α2α3 (19%) and α3α3 combinations (27%) are clearly dominated by the α1α3 combination (56%). These values are in good agreement with the data derived from the immunodepletion experiments (Table IV). In addition, the data fit nicely to values published so far on the abundance of the α1α2 combination in the α2-containing receptor population of rat hippocampus and cerebral cortex (36% versus 36 and 39%, respectively) (6del Rio J.C. Araujo F. Ramos B. Ruano D. Vitorica J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 8Araujo F. Tan S. Ruano D. Schoemaker H. Benavides J. Vitorica J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 27902-27911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, for the α1α3 combination in the α1-containing receptor population in cerebral cortex, an abundance of 24% was reported (6del Rio J.C. Araujo F. Ramos B. Ruano D. Vitorica J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 8Araujo F. Tan S. Ruano D. Schoemaker H. Benavides J. Vitorica J. J. Biol.

It is currently unclear whether this mismatch is due to experimental reasons, the brain areas used (cerebral cortex versus whole brain), or the species analyzed (rat versus mouse). Interestingly, only in the α1-containing receptor population the α1α1 combination is the most prevalent one, whereas in the α2 and particularly in the α3 receptor population receptors with two different types of α subunits predominate. Because GABAA receptors containing two different types of α subunits appear to be expressed at considerable levels, it is conceivable that the inclusion of a second type of α subunit may influence GABAA receptor function. However, the consequences of two different types of α subunits within a single receptor complex on GABAA receptor function are largely unknown. In particular, it is not clear how the expression of heterologous α subunits in a receptor complex affects functional benzodiazepine receptor pharmacology. So far, electrophysiological experiments on recombinant α1α3β2γ2, α1α5β2γ2, and α1α6β2γ2 indicate that receptors containing two different α subunit variants display unique kinetics and pharmacological properties (23Ebert B. Wafford K.A. Whiting P.J. Krogsgaard-Larsen P. Kemp J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 957-963PubMed Google Scholar, 24Tia S. Wang J.F. Kotchabhakdi N. Vicini S.

Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2590-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). All of these studies inherently lack the ultimate certainty that indeed predominantly the subunit combination containing two heterologous α subunits was measured and not a mixture of different subunit combinations containing only a single α subunit variant. However, recent successful approaches linking the subunits covalently together to assess the subunit arrangement within the receptor complex and the functional consequences of subunit position in the receptor pentamer provide now the basis for analyzing GABAA receptor subtypes of predefined subunit arrangement (27Baumann S.W. Baur R. Sigel E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46020-46025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 28Minier F. Sigel E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A first study on the functional consequences of the position of α1 and α6 subunits in the same receptor pentamer clearly demonstrated that only receptors with the α1 subunit next to the γ2 subunit (γ2-β2-α6-β2-α1) displayed modulation by diazepam, whereas receptors with the α6 subunit next to the γ2 subunit (γ2-β2-α1-β2-α6) were insensitive to diazepam (28Minier F. Sigel E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7769-7774Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These data support the results of the present study indicating that only receptors containing two mutated α subunits are insensitive to diazepam binding. In addition, the data suggest that the nonmutated, diazepam-sensitive α subunit preferentially assembles with the γ2 subunit. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that the mouse lines containing the α(H/R) mutation represent a valuable model for analyzing the abundance of receptor populations containing two different types of α subunits. This approach allows the analysis to be performed on membrane fractions, tissue homogenates, or even tissue sections without solubilization and immunoprecipitation of the receptors. A detailed analysis of receptor subtypes containing two different types of α subunits on a brain regional level by quantitative receptor autoradiography on brain sections is now feasible."

We have examined the expression and function of P2X receptors on human erythrocytes using confocal microscopy and a panel of anti-P2X1–7 antibodies and have measured monovalent cation fluxes in the presence of various nucleotide agonists. Human erythrocytes expressed P2X7 receptors on all cells examined from eight of eight subjects, as well as P2X2 at a far lower staining intensity in six of eight subjects. ATP stimulated the efflux of 86Rb+ (K+) from human erythrocytes in a dose-dependent fashion with an EC50 of ∼95 μm. Other nucleotides also induced an efflux of 86Rb+ from erythrocytes with an order of agonist potency of 2′- and 3′-O(4-benzoylbenzoyl) ATP (BzATP) > ATP > 2-methylthio-ATP (2MeSATP) > adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (ATPγS), whereas ADP or UTP had no effect. ATP-induced efflux of 86Rb+ from erythrocytes was inhibited by extracellular Na+ and oxidized ATP, as well as by KN-62, an antagonist specific for the human P2X7 receptor. When erythrocytes were incubated in isotonic KCl medium, the addition of ATP stimulated an 86Rb+ influx approximately equal in magnitude to ATP-stimulated 86Rb+ efflux from the same cells. BzATP also stimulated the influx of 22Na+ into erythrocytes incubated in isotonic NaCl medium. Both ATP-induced efflux and influx of 86Rb+ and 22Na+ were impaired in erythrocytes from subjects who had inherited loss-of-function polymorphisms in the P2X7 receptor. These results suggest that the reversible permeabilization of erythrocytes by extracellular ATP is mediated by the P2X7 receptor.

Many of our concepts of cellular Na+ and K+ homeostasis were based on experiments in the erythrocyte, a cell type in which intracellular Na+ and K+ concentrations could be readily changed and the subsequent effect on ion transport could be measured. Early studies of the sodium pump used the technique of hypotonic hemolysis and resealing of ghosts to study the dependence of Na+ pumping on intracellular cation concentration (1Post R.L.

Physiol. 1961; 156: 274-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), whereas the first description of Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransport owed much to a nystatin technique to alter the Na+ gradient and change the driving force for cotransport (3Wiley J.S. Cooper R.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1974; 53: 745-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Yet another technique was introduced by Parker et al. (4Parker J.C. Snow R.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1972; 223: 888-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 5Parker J.C. Castranova V. Goldinger J.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1977; 69: 417-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) who showed that intracellular Na+ and K+ concentration of canine erythrocytes could be equilibrated with the cation concentration in the medium simply by incubation with extracellular ATP for 30–60 min and that removal of ATP restored the basal permeability of the cell. This reversible effect of ATP suggested the involvement of an ATP-gated cation channel, but it is only with recent observations and knowledge of the P2X receptor family (6North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2490) Google Scholar) that it is possible to study this question. Seven subtypes of the P2X receptor family have been identified based on a common structure of two transmembrane domains with intracellular amino and carboxyl termini and a trimeric structure in the plasma membrane (6North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2490) Google Scholar). Although P2X1–P2X6 channels all show desensitization in the continued presence of agonist (6North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2490) Google Scholar), the converse occurs with the P2X7 channel, which undergoes slow dilatation over 10–30 s to a second and larger permeability state allowing a massive loss of cellular K+ and a Na+ gain (7Nuttle L.C.

More recently, we have identified another but less common loss-of-function single nucleotide polymorphism at nucleotide position 946 of the human P2X7 gene (946G → A) that changes an arginine to glutamine at amino acid 307 (R307Q) (28Gu B.J.

Cells were then washed three times at 4 °C with ice-cold NaCl medium and resuspended in either KCl medium (150 mm KCl, 5 mm d-glucose, 0.1% BSA, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) or NaCl medium at a final hematocrit of 5%. 86Rb+-loaded erythrocyte suspensions (2.5 ml) were incubated in the absence or presence of nucleotide for 60 min at 37 °C. At 0- and 60-min time points, 1-ml samples were overlaid on 0.3 ml of phthalate oil mixture and centrifuged at 8000 × g for 30 s. For time-course studies, 86Rb+-loaded erythrocyte suspensions (10 ml) were incubated in the absence or presence of 1 mm ATP for 4 h, with 1-ml samples collected at 30 min intervals as above. For studies using the P2X7 antagonist, OxATP (36Murgia M. Hanau D. Pizzo P. Rippa M. Di Virgilio F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8199-8203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 86Rb+-loaded erythrocytes resuspended in NaCl medium were pre-incubated in the absence or presence of 300 μm OxATP for 60 min at 37 °C, washed once with NaCl medium, and resuspended in KCl medium before incubation in the absence or presence of ATP for 60 min. For studies using the specific P2X7 antagonist, KN-62 (37Gargett C.E. Wiley J.S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 1483-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), 86Rb+-loaded erythrocytes resuspended in KCl medium were pre-incubated in the presence of 1 μm KN-62 or an equal volume of Me2SO vehicle for 15 min at 37 °C before incubation in the absence or presence of ATP for 60 min. Samples (700 μl) from the supernatant above the oil after centrifugation and a second sample (350 μl of 86Rb+-loaded erythrocytes and 350 μl of 0.4% saponin) were collected to measure the level of radioactivity using a Wallac (Turku, Finland) 1480 Wizard 3 Automatic Gamma Counter. Hemolysis after a 60-min incubation was less than 1% as determined spectrophotometrically on cell-free supernatants with Drabkin's reagent (38Drabkin D.L. Austin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1935; 112: 51-65Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). 86Rb+ and 22Na+ Influx Measurements—Erythrocyte suspensions (2 ml) at a final hematocrit of 5% in KCl or NaCl medium containing 1 mm furosemide and 100 μm ouabain (but no BSA) were incubated with 86Rb+ or 22Na+ (2 μCi/ml) in the absence or presence of 1 mm ATP or 0.2 mm BzATP, respectively, for up to 60 min at 37 °C. At 15, 30, 45, or 60 min, cells were washed three times with 10 ml of ice-cold isotonic saline (1200 × g for 60 s at 4 °C). Erythrocytes were lysed with 1 ml of 10 μm NH4OH and 100 μl of 1% saponin, the level of radioactivity was measured by γ counting, and the hemoglobin concentration was determined spectrophotometrically with Drabkin's reagent. Samples at each time point were performed in duplicate. Statistical Analyses—The differences in 86Rb+ release were compared using either the unpaired Student's t test for single comparisons to control samples (see Figs. 2 and 4) or analysis of variance for multiple comparisons (see Figs. 5 and 6 and Table I) using SPSS 11.5 for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL) with p < 0.05 considered significant.Fig. 4P2X7 agonists induce 86Rb+ efflux from human erythrocytes. 86Rb+-loaded erythrocytes resuspended in KCl medium were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min in the absence (Control) or presence of 1 mm nucleotide (as indicated) except BzATP (0.2 mm). 86Rb+ efflux was calculated as the difference in percentage release between 0 and 60 min.

Barden J.A. Wiley J.S. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 304: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar); however, attempts to fix human erythrocytes immobilized onto poly(l-lysine)-coated coverslips or air-dried onto glass slides with paraformaldehyde were unsuccessful because of a large amount of cell loss (results not shown). Therefore, human erythrocytes were air-dried onto glass slides and fixed with acetone/methanol (34Enderle T. Ha T. Ogletree D.F. Chemla D.S. Magowan C. Weiss S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 520-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and stained with a panel of polyclonal antibodies against all seven P2X subtypes. Confocal microscopy with two different anti-P2X7 polyclonal antibodies (30Sluyter R. Barden J.A. Wiley J.S. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 304: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 32Wiley J.S. Dao-Ung L.P. Li C. Shemon A.N. Gu B.J. Smart M.L. Fuller S.J. Barden J.A. Petrou S. Sluyter R. J. Biol.

Of these subjects, five were wild-type (Fig. 1A), two were heterozygous (results not shown), and one was homozygous (Fig. 1B) for the E496A polymorphism. Labeling was diffuse, although occasional puncta were observed on erythrocytes from some subjects. P2X2 was also present on erythrocytes; however, the intensity level of staining was much lower than that of P2X7 (Fig. 1C) and was near to absent on erythrocytes from two of the eight individuals studied (results not shown). P2X1, P2X3, P2X4, P2X5, and P2X6 were not detected, because the labeling using polyclonal antibodies to these subtypes was similar to that of pre-immune sera (Fig. 1D; results not shown). To determine the relative level of P2X7 on erythrocytes compared with leukocytes, whole blood from two wild-type subjects was air-dried onto glass slides, fixed with acetone/methanol, and stained with anti-P2X7 polyclonal antibodies. Confocal microscopy demonstrated two populations of stained cells within the whole blood smears, which morphologically resembled either erythrocytes or leukocytes, with the intensity level of staining much lower on erythrocytes than that of the mixed leukocyte population (Fig. 1, E and F). P2X7 Agonists Induce 86Rb+ Efflux from Human Erythrocytes—The effect of extracellular ATP on cation fluxes in human erythrocytes was then studied. Cells were loaded with 86Rb+ (a surrogate of K+) and incubated at 37 °C with 1 mm ATP for up to 4 h with samples collected at 30-min intervals. At all time points, ATP induced a significant increment in 86Rb+ efflux from erythrocytes compared with cells incubated in the absence of ATP (Fig. 2). The ATP-induced 86Rb+ efflux was linear up to 60 min, therefore this time point was selected for all subsequent efflux studies. The dose effect of ATP on cation fluxes in human erythrocytes was then studied. Cells loaded with 86Rb+ were incubated at 37 °C with varying concentrations of ATP for 60 min. The efflux of 86Rb+ from erythrocytes after a 60-min incubation ranged from 4.0 ± 0.3% in the absence of a nucleotide up to 9.3 ± 0.5% with 2 mm ATP (Fig. 3). Over this range of ATP concentrations an EC50 value of 95.4 ± 7.1 μm was obtained from the dose-response curve (Fig. 3), which is similar to values observed for either recombinant or native P2X7 (EC50 = 85 or 86 μm, respectively) (8Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar, 39Gargett C.E. Cornish J.E. Wiley J.S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) but greater than that for P2X2 (EC50 = 1 μm) (40Lynch K.J. Touma E. Niforatos W. Kage K.L. Burgard E.C. van Biesen T. Kowaluk E.A. Jarvis M.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1171-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The effect of various nucleotide agonists on 86Rb+ effluxes was then studied. Similar to above (Fig. 2), the release of 86Rb+ from erythrocytes after a 60-min incubation in the absence of nucleotide was 3.6 ± 0.4% (Fig. 4). The P2X7 agonists, 0.2 mm BzATP and 1 mm ATP, induced a significant efflux of 86Rb+ from erythrocytes incubated in KCl medium with 12.0 ± 1.2 and 9.9 ± 0.9% of the total cell-associated 86Rb+ being released at 60 min, respectively (Fig. 4). Other P2X7 agonists, 1 mm 2MeSATP and 1 mm ATPγS, which are both partial agonists (39Gargett C.E. Cornish J.E. Wiley J.S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), also induced 86Rb+ efflux (6.8 ± 0.3 and 4.7 ± 0.6%, respectively), although the latter failed to reach significance compared with 86Rb+ efflux in the absence of the nucleotide (p = 0.15). Thus for human erythrocyte P2X7, the agonist potencies follow a rank order of BzATP > ATP > 2MeSATP > ATPγS, which is identical to the order found for recombinant and native P2X7 (8Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar, 39Gargett C.E. Cornish J.E. Wiley J.S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). ADP and UTP, added at either 1 mm (Fig. 4) or 0.1 mm (results not shown) gave a 86Rb+ release similar to control values, thus excluding a role for many of the P2Y receptors some of which are on avian erythrocytes (41Boyer J.L.

https://openalex.org/W2088491250,"The integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) (αLβ2; CD11a/CD18) plays an important role in leukocyte migration and T cell activation. LFA-1 is inhibited by the cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin, which binds to an allosteric site of the αL I domain termed the lovastatin site (L-site). Here we report for the first time the x-ray structures of the LFA-1 I domain complexed with derivatives of lovastatin optimized for LFA-1 inhibition. This analysis identified two new subpockets within the L-site occupied by chemical groups of the statin derivatives but not by lovastatin itself. Occupancy of these L-site subpockets led to distinct conformational changes in LFA-1, which were detectable by an epitope-monitoring assay. We utilized this assay to demonstrate improved LFA-1 inhibition in human blood in vitro and in blood samples from treated animals ex vivo. Moreover, we demonstrate that the novel lovastatin-derived LFA-1 inhibitor LFA878 exhibits potent anti-inflammatory effects in carrageenan-induced rat paw edema. In summary, the findings reported here extend the understanding of LFA-1 inhibition at the molecular level, allow for the identification and design of LFA-1 inhibitors of further enhanced potency, and support the expectation that LFA-1 inhibitors binding to the L-site will be of therapeutic value in treating inflammatory diseases.

(αLβ2; CD11a/CD18) is a α/β heterodimeric receptor belonging to the β2 integrin subfamily. LFA-1 resides on leukocytes in a low affinity, non-ligand binding state. The integrin requires activation by divalent metal cations or intracellular signals in order to bind to its major counter receptor, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, expressed on both endothelial cells and leukocytes (1Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6414) Google Scholar). As a member of the β2 integrin family LFA-1 contains an inserted (I) domain located between the β-sheets 2 and 3 of a seven-bladed β-propeller region on the αL chain (2Huang C. Lu C. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3156-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Within the I domain a divalent cation coordination site (named metal ion-dependent adhesion site or MIDAS) interacts directly with the Glu-34 of ICAM-1 (3Shimaoka M. Xiao T. Liu J.H. Yang Y. Dong Y.

The β2 chain of LFA-1 contains an I-like domain that is known to regulate the activity status of the αL I domain during LFA-1 activation. In contrast to the αL I domain, the β2 I-like domain does not participate directly in ligand binding (4Lu C. Shimaoka M. Zang Q. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2393-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 5Yang W. Shimaoka M. Chen J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6414) Google Scholar). In addition, as a component of the immunological synapse, LFA-1 is involved in T cell activation upon antigen recognition (6Grakoui A. Bromley S.K. Sumen C. Davis M.M. Shaw A.S. Allen P.M. Dustin M.L. Science. 1999; 285: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar). These multiple functions make LFA-1 a promising therapeutic target in inflammatory and immunological diseases. Indeed, clinical studies suggest that anti-LFA-1 antibody therapy may be beneficial in bone marrow and solid organ transplantation (7Cavazzana-Calvo M. Bordigoni P. Michel G. Esperou H. Souillet G.

The most convincing clinical data to date has been reported for a humanized anti-LFA-1 mAb administered to patients with chronic plaque psoriasis (9Lebwohl M. Tyring S.K. Hamilton T.K. Toth D.

However, the use of biologicals poses significant limitations in clinical practice, e.g. the need for parenteral application. Thus the availability of orally active low molecular weight inhibitors of LFA-1 would be highly desirable. High throughput screening has identified various low molecular weight inhibitors of the LFA-1/ICAM-1 interaction (10Shimaoka M. Springer T.A. Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov. 2003; 2: 703-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Based on their mode of action, these inhibitors can be divided into two major classes. The α I allosteric inhibitors have been shown to bind to a hydrophobic pocket near the C-terminal helix α7 of the αL I domain but distant from the MIDAS (10Shimaoka M. Springer T.A. Nat. Rev. Drug.

By binding to this pocket, the LFA-1 inhibitors are thought to block a downward axial displacement of helix α7, which is critical for I domain activation (10Shimaoka M. Springer T.A. Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov. 2003; 2: 703-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In addition to this first group of inhibitors, a second group of LFA-1 inhibitors has been recently identified that are thought to bind to the MIDAS of the β2 I-like domain, thereby affecting both the β2 I-like and αL I domain (17Welzenbach K.

Immunity. 2003; 19: 391-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). These inhibitors, termed α/β I-like allosteric inhibitors, appear to disrupt signal transmission between the LFA-1 I domain and the I-like domain, resulting in a default low affinity conformation of the I domain (10Shimaoka M. Springer T.A. Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov. 2003; 2: 703-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 18Shimaoka M. Salas A. Yang W. Weitz-Schmidt G. Springer T.A.

The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor lovastatin belongs to the class of α I allosteric inhibitors that interact with the hydrophobic pocket near the C-terminal helix α7 of the I domain (11Kallen J.

Brinkmann V. Kamata T. Kallen J. Bruns C. Cottens S. Takada Y. Hommel U. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 687-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Because lovastatin was the first molecule shown to bind to this site, the site was termed the lovastatin site (L-site) (12Weitz-Schmidt G. Welzenbach K. Brinkmann V. Kamata T. Kallen J. Bruns C. Cottens S. Takada Y. Hommel U. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 687-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). A series of lovastatin derivatives has since been synthesized that inhibit LFA-1 more potently than lovastatin itself and do no longer affect the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (12Weitz-Schmidt G.

Little is known about the molecular basis leading to improved LFA-1 inhibition by these compounds. Moreover, most of the studies addressing LFA-1 inhibition by low molecular weight compounds via the L-site have been performed in assays involving the isolated I domain, purified LFA-1, or LFA-1 expressed on cell lines. Direct proof for L-site occupancy by lovastatin or statin derivatives in a more physiological setting is lacking. Utilizing x-ray crystallography, we investigate here for the first time the molecular basis for improved LFA-1 inhibition by the previously described statin-based inhibitor LFA703 (12Weitz-Schmidt G.

Furthermore, we show that improved LFA-1 inhibition via the L-site can be detected in vitro in human blood and ex vivo in blood from treated animals. Our results in carrageenan-induced rat paw edema further substantiate the expectation that inhibitors targeting the L-site may have therapeutic potential as anti-inflammatory agents. Crystallization and Structure Determination of the αL I Domain/LFA878 Complex—For the αL I domain, the construct comprising residues Lys127–Gly311 was used, and purification was performed as reported previously (11Kallen J.

The complex αL I domain/LFA878 was prepared by adding the ligand (100 mm solution in Me2SO) to the protein solution (12.7 mg/ml 10 mm MgSO4) in a 3:1 molar ratio. Crystals with maximal dimensions up to 0.4 mm could be grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Two microliters of αL I domain/LFA878 were mixed with an equal volume of well solution (0.085 m sodium citrate, pH 5.6, 0.17 m ammonium acetate, 15% glycerol, and 25.5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000) and allowed to equilibrate against 1 ml of the latter at 20 °C. Diffraction data were collected to 2.1 Å at 20 °C on a Mar345 imaging plate detector at the Swiss-Norwegian beamline of the European Synchrotron Facility (Grenoble, France). After data processing with the HKL software suite (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar) and the CCP4-package (20Collaborative Computational Project No 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The two complexes in the asymmetric unit were refined without non-crystallographic restraints. The final refinement model includes two αL I domains (residues Gly128–Ile309), two LFA878 ligands, two magnesium ions, 148 water molecules, and has good stereochemistry (overall G value = 0.20; see Table I for crystal data, data collection, and refinement statistics) (24Laskowski R.A.

Open table in a new tab Crystallization and Structure Determination of the αL I Domain/LFA703 Complex—The complex αL I domain/LFA703 was prepared as for LFA878. Crystals with maximal dimensions up to 0.3 mm could be grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. One microliter of αL I domain/LFA703 was mixed with an equal volume of well solution (0.17 m ammonium acetate, pH 4.6, 0.085 m sodium acetate, 15% glycerol, and 26% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000) and allowed to equilibrate against 0.7 ml of the latter at 20 °C. Diffraction data were collected to 2.2 Å at 20 °C on a Mar345 imaging plate detector at the Swiss-Norwegian beamline of the European Synchrotron Facility (Grenoble, France). Data processing, rebuilding, and refinement were done as for LFA878. The final refinement model includes two αL I domains (residues Gly128–Ile309), two LFA703 ligands, two magnesium ions, 278 water molecules, and has good stereochemistry (overall G value = 0.02; see Table I). LFA-1 Binding Assays—The cell-free LFA-1/ICAM-1 binding assay quantifies the binding of biotinylated recombinant ICAM-1 to immobilized LFA-1. The HUT78/ICAM-1 adhesion assay quantifies the binding of fluorescently labeled HUT78 cells to immobilized recombinant ICAM-1. Both assays were performed as described previously (11Kallen J. Welzenbach K. Ramage P. Geyl D. Kriwacki R. Legge G. Cottens S. Weitz-Schmidt G. Hommel U. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Anti-LFA-1 mAbs Binding to Jurkat Cells—The effect of the compounds on the conformational status of LFA-1 was tested as described previously (17Welzenbach K. Hommel U. Weitz-Schmidt G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10590-10598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, Jurkat cells were pre-incubated with the compounds at a final concentration of 50 μm in Tris-buffered saline containing 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4 (assay buffer) at room temperature (RT) for 20 min followed by the addition of the anti-LFA-1 mAbs. After 25 min at RT, cells were washed two times with assay buffer and counterstained with Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) conjugate (Molecular Probes, Leiden, Netherlands) diluted 1:175 in assay buffer for 30 min at RT. After a washing step, antibody binding was immediately analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACScan (BD Biosciences). Mean fluorescence intensities (geometric mean) were calculated using the CellQuest software. Mean fluorescence intensities were corrected for background staining by subtracting the mean fluorescent intensity of the appropriate isotype-matched negative controls. Mean fluorescence intensities of the solvent controls were set as 100%. Inhibition of anti-LFA-1 mAb binding induced by inhibitor treatment was expressed as a percentage of these controls. Whole Blood LFA-1 Reporter Epitope Monitoring Assay (LFA-1 REMA)—The LFA-1 inhibitors were dissolved and diluted in Me2SO. Heparinized human blood samples or blood samples from different animal species (198 μl) were mixed with the compound solution or Me2SO (2 μl) and incubated for 25 min at RT. The compound containing blood samples (90 μl) were then transferred to 96-well microtiter plates. The fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mAb R7.1 (BioSource, Camarillo, CA) and the isotype control mAb were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline, and 10 μl was added to the samples (final concentration was 2–3 μg of mAb per milliliter of blood). After 25 min at RT, the blood samples (100 μl) were transferred to tubes containing 1 ml of FACS lysing solution (BD Biosciences), mixed, and incubated for 10 min in the dark at RT. Then the samples were centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min. The supernatants were removed, and the pellets were washed two times in 1 ml of Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and then resuspended in 150 μl of the same buffer. Bound antibody was detected by flow cytometry gating the major leukocyte subpopulations according to their light scatter properties. In each sample, 20,000 lymphocytes were counted. In control experiments, unlabeled mAb TS2/4 was diluted and added to the blood samples (final concentration was 2.5 μg of mAb per milliliter of blood). After lysis and washing steps the Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-mouse IgG conjugate diluted 1:150 in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin was added. The samples were incubated for 30 min, and bound mAb TS2/4 was quantified by flow cytometry as described. Ex Vivo Rabbit LFA-1 REMA—Female Russian dwarf rabbits received 0.1 ml/kg Prequillan (10 mg/ml) subcutaneously. Compounds dissolved in a mixture of cremophor EL and ethanol (2:1) (w/w) and then diluted further with 5% glucose (1:3) (v/v) were administered intravenously by bolus injection (right ear; 1.5 ml per rabbit). Blood samples (200 μl) were taken from the left ear at indicated time points and placed into microtubes containing heparin. The blood samples were stored on ice until analysis. Ninety microliters of each sample were transferred to microtiter plates, and REMA analysis was performed as described above. Baseline values were determined in blood samples taken 15 min before compound administration. The animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the animal experimentation guidelines and laws laid down by the Swiss Federal and Cantonal Authorities. Carrageenan-induced Paw Edema in Rats—Male OFA rats were treated orally with LFA878 (3, 10, and 30 mg/kg), diclofenac (3 mg/kg), or the respective vehicle controls (vehicle for LFA878 was a mixture of cremophor EL and ethanol (2:1) (w/w) diluted 1:3 (v/v) with 5% glucose; vehicle for diclofenac was Tween 80/0.75% methylcellulose). The anti-LFA-1 mAb WT.1 (NatuTec, Frankfurt, Germany) was diluted in phosphate-buffered saline and administered at a concentration of 2.5 mg/kg. One hour later the rats received a 100-μl intra-plantar injection of a 1% (w/v) carrageenan solution in 0.9% saline in the hind paw, and the volume of the paw was measured by plethysmography. The paw volume measurements were repeated at 3 and 5 h after injection of the carrageenan. Percentage inhibition of paw swelling at 3 and 5 h was calculated by reference to vehicle-treated animals (0% inhibition). The animal experiments were conducted according to the animal experimentation guidelines and laws laid down by the Swiss Federal and Cantonal Authorities. X-ray Structures of the Complexes αL I Domain/LFA703 and αL I Domain/LFA878 Identify Novel Subpockets within the L-site—The compounds LFA703 and LFA878 are two examples of a series of lovastatin-derived inhibitors that inhibit LFA-1 function more potently than lovastatin itself (Fig. 1). Both compounds blocked LFA-1 mediated binding to ICAM-1 with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range in cell-free and cell-based in vitro assays, whereas lovastatin was only active in the micromolar range (Fig. 1). To determine the structural basis for this improved activity, we solved the crystal structures of the I domain portion of LFA-1 bound to LFA703 or LFA878 at resolution limits of 2.2 and 2.1 Å, respectively (Fig. 2). The crystal form for LFA878 is very similar to the one reported previously for lovastatin (with a local dyad relating the two complexes in the asymmetric unit) (11Kallen J. Welzenbach K. Ramage P. Geyl D. Kriwacki R. Legge G. Cottens S. Weitz-Schmidt G. Hommel U. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), whereas the form for LFA703 is new and different (no local dyad relating the two complexes). Interestingly, for LFA703 the C-terminal residues of the I domain monomers form parallel β-sheet interactions with the respective residues from a neighboring molecule, in contrast to the antiparallel β-sheet interactions in the LFA878 or lovastatin complexes. This finding demonstrates the structural adaptability of the linker region after the helix α7 and suggests possible structural changes occurring upon the activation of LFA-1. Moreover, a new type of interaction with the MIDAS site is observed in the crystal form for LFA703. The Mg2+ in the MIDAS itself is coordinated in an identical way as that seen for the other αL I domain/statin-based inhibitor complexes or the uncomplexed αL I domain (25Qu A. Leahy D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10277-10281Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In all the latter cases (including the complex with LFA703) the I domain is in its low affinity form, which is characterized (among other features) by a direct coordination of Mg2+ by Asp239. The direct coordination is thought to reduce the electrophilicity of Mg2+ and, thus, to weaken the interaction with Glu34 of ICAM-1 (3Shimaoka M. Xiao T. Liu J.H. Yang Y. Dong Y. Jun C.D. McCormack A. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Takagi J. Wang J.H. Springer T.A. Cell. 2003; 112: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is now corroborated with the new tetragonal crystal form of the αL I domain/LFA703 complex, which does not show a direct interaction but only a water-mediated, indirect interaction between the Mg2+ (protomer B) and a glutamate residue (Glu218) from a neighboring protomer A (Fig. 2F).Fig. 2X-ray structures of the complexes αL I domain/LFA703 and αL I domain/LFA878. A, stereo image of the L-site for αL I domain/LFA703. I domain residues and ribbon representation are in white, LFA703 in cyan (oxygens are red, and nitrogens are blue). The substituted naphthyl group of LFA703 occupies a region (the naphthyl subpocket, colored magenta) formed mainly by Val130, Thr231, Val233, and Ile255. B, stereo image of the L-site for αL I domain/LFA878 (coloring as for LFA703). The veratryl group of LFA878 occupies a region (the veratrylsubpocket, colored magenta) formed mainly by Tyr257, Glu284, and Phe285. A comparison with the I domain/LFA703 complex shows that Glu284 has dramatically changed its side-chain conformation. C, Fo – Fc electron density (contour level 3σ, 8–2.2 Å) before LFA703 was inserted into the model. Superposed is the final model of LFA703 (carbons are cyan/yellow, oxygens are red, and nitrogens are blue). The naphthyl group adopts two alternate conformations. D, Fo (contour – Fc density level 3 electron σ, 8–2.1 Å) before LFA878 was inserted into the model. Superposed is the final model of LFA878 (coloring as for LFA703). E, superposition of LFA703 (carbons are yellow), LFA878 (carbons are cyan), and lovastatin (carbons are white) using Cα atoms of the respective αL I domains. The decalin moieties occupy practically identical positions. F, MIDAS site for αL I domain/LFA703. Final 2Fo – Fc electron density (contour level 3σ, 8–2.2 Å) is shown in blue; carbons are yellow, oxygens are red, nitrogens are blue, water molecules are white, and the Mg2+ ion is cyan. Selected hydrogen bonds are shown as black lines (dashed lines for the interaction with neighboring molecule). Because of the direct coordination by Asp239, the electrophilicity of Mg2+ is reduced so that a glutamate (Glu218, colored magenta) from a neighboring molecule is only interacting indirectly (via a water molecule) with the Mg2+ in the MIDAS site. Single letter amino acid abbreviations are used with position numbers throughout the figure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Both LFA703 and LFA878 were found to bind to the L-site of the αL I domain (Fig. 2, A and B) and displayed a clear difference electron density before, present in the models (Fig. 2, C and D). The decalin moieties of the statin derivatives adopt very similar positions within the respective x-ray structures even though different interactions between the I domain monomers occur at the carboxyl termini of the different crystal forms (Fig. 2E). The main contacts between LFA703 and the L-site (distance cutoff of 4.2 Å between non-hydrogen atoms) are mediated by the residues Gly128, Val130, Leu132, Phe153, Tyr166, Thr231, Val233, Ile235, Ile255, Tyr257, Glu284, Phe285, Lys287, Leu298, Glu301, Leu302, Lys305, and Ile306. Interestingly, the carbonyl oxygen of the isobutyl-ester moiety attached to the decalin ring of LFA703 contributes a water-mediated hydrogen bond to both NZ-Lys287 and OE1- or OE2-Glu284. The substituted naphthyl of LFA703 adopts two alternate conformations (for which the naphthyl groups are in the same plane), allowing the hydroxy-methylene group of the naphthyl in one conformation to form a hydrogen bond with OG1-Thr231 (Fig. 2, A and C). This region within the L-site is not reached by LFA878 or lovastatin and constitutes a new L-site subpocket, designated here the “naphthyl subpocket,” formed mainly by the side chains of Val130, Thr231, Val233, and Ile255. A least squares superposition of the αL I domains in the complexes with LFA703 and lovastatin shows that the protein backbones are similar (e.g. the root mean squares deviation for the Cα-atoms of residues Gly128–Lys304 from the respective protomers A is 0.36 Å, and from the respective protomers B it is 0.52 Å) but display significant changes at the carboxyl-terminal residues Lys305–Ile309, which ar"

We found that the region that links the lutropin receptor leucine-rich repeat domain (LRD) to its transmembrane domain (TMD) has substantial roles in ligand binding and signaling, hence we term it the signaling specificity domain (SSD). Theoretical considerations indicated the short SSDs in marmoset lutropin and salmon follitropin receptors have KH domain folds. We assembled models of lutropin, follitropin, and thyrotropin receptors by aligning models of their LRD, TMD, and shortened SSD in a manner that explains how substitutions in follitropin and thyrotropin receptors distant from their apparent ligand binding sites enable them to recognize lutropins. In these models, the SSD is parallel to the concave surface of the LRD and makes extensive contacts with TMD outer loops 1 and 2. The LRD appears to contact TMD outer loop 3 and a few residues in helices 1, 5, 6, and 7. We propose that signaling results from contacts of the ligands with the SSD and LRD that alter the LRD, which then moves TMD helices 6 and 7. The positions of the LRD and SSD support the notion that the receptor can be activated by hormones that dock with these domains in either of two different orientations. This would account for the abilities of some ligands and ligand chimeras to bind multiple receptors and for some receptors to bind multiple ligands. This property of the receptor may have contributed significantly to ligand-receptor co-evolution.

Several models have been devised to account for the interactions of hCG 1The abbreviations used are: hCG, human choriogonadotropin; hLH, human lutropin; bLH, bovine lutropin; hFSH, human follitropin; hTSH, human thyrotropin; LHR, LH receptor; FSHR, follicle-stimulating hormone receptor; TSHR, thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor; LRD, leucine-rich repeat domain; SSD, signaling specificity domain; TMD, transmembrane domain; IBMX, isobutylmethylxanthine; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. and other glycoprotein hormones with their receptors, membrane proteins that contain a ligand binding NH2-terminal extracellular domain, a TMD consisting of seven-membrane spanning helices, and a cytosolic COOH-terminal domain (1McFarland K.C.

The NH2-terminal three-fourths of the LHR extracellular domain, which we term the LRD, contains several leucine-rich repeats that are likely to give it a curved shape similar in structure to other leucine-rich repeat proteins such as the SCF ubiquitin ligases (3Schulman B.A. Carrano A.C. Jeffrey P.D. Bowen Z. Kinnucan E.R. Finnin M.S. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Pagano M. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). As shown here, the remaining quarter of the extracellular domain also makes important contributions to ligand binding and signaling and for this reason we refer to it as the SSD or signaling specificity domain (SSD). The amino acid sequence of the SSD is not similar to any known protein and its structure has not been modeled. The TMD appears to be similar in conformation to bovine rhodopsin (4Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. LeTrong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar), but it was not known how it is coupled to the LRD and TMD. The manner in which ligands interact with these receptors has been controversial. One view suggests the α-subunit COOH terminus and the small seatbelt loop contact the concave surface of the LRD such that the ends of loops α1/α3 and β1/β3 are exposed (5Jiang X. Dreano M.

This model does not provide an obvious means by which ligand binding results in signal transduction. Portions of the hormone (6Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14953-14957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), including α-subunit loops 1 and/or 3 (7Remy J.-J. Couture L. Pantel J. Haertle T. Rabesona H. Bozon V. Pajot-Augy E. Robert P. Troalen F. Salesse R. Bidart J-M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 125: 79-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), have also been suggested to contact the TMD. This view implies that the extracellular domain snares the ligand and delivers it to the transmembrane domain. We had proposed that interactions of the ligand with the LRD and SSD are needed for signaling (8Moyle W.R. Campbell R.K. Rao S.N.V. Ayad N.G. Bernard M.P. Han Y. Wang Y. J. Biol.

J. 1998; 335: 611-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), even though the LRD by itself is sufficient for hCG binding to the LHR (10Braun T. Schofield P.R. Sprengel R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1885-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). A key postulate of our original model, namely that the groove between hormone loops α2 and β1/β3 contacts the rim of the LRD to form a high affinity binding site, is no longer tenable. We have found that portions of loop α2 facing this groove are unlikely to participate in high affinity rat LHR contacts, even though they appear to be near the hormone-receptor interface (75Xing Y. Lin W. Jiang M. Cao D. Myers R.V. Bernard M.P. Moyle W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44427-44437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Observations described here suggest that β-subunit loops 1 and 3 of lutropins contact the SSD domain rather than the LRD. The SSD is the least understood region of the receptor extracellular domain. This portion of the human LHR is largely responsible for its ability to distinguish hCG and bovine LH (9Bernard M.P. Myers R.V. Moyle W.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 611-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), indicating that it contacts the ligand. The SSD may have a role in lutropin signaling as shown by the finding that some mutations increase the basal activity of the LHR (11Nakabayashi K. Kudo M. Kobilka B. Hsueh A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30264-30271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To increase the probability that we could deduce a structure for the SSD, we limited our studies to the smallest natural SSDs known, namely those of the marmoset LHR (12Zhang F.P. Rannikko A.S. Manna P.R. Fraser H.M. Huhtaniemi I. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2481-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and the salmon FSHR (13Oba Y. Hirai T. Yoshirua Y. Yoshikuni M. Kawauchi H. Nagahama Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 366-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The SSD of the marmoset receptor lacks residues derived from exon 10, which may be responsible for its unusual ability to distinguish hCG and LH (14Gromoll J. Wistuba J. Terwort N. Godmann M. Muller T. Simoni M. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 69: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Human LHRs that lack exon 10 also respond better to hCG than to LH (15Muller T. Gromoll J. Simoni M. J.

Moyle W.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 611-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), we concluded that the primate LHR might have a conformation that constrains ligand binding in a unique manner. Reasoning that a marmoset analog of the rat LHR, which interacts with lutropins from many species, would be a more useful tool to study the role of the SSD in hormone function, we characterized a rat LHR analog that lacks residues encoded by exon 10 and that has a histidine in place of Cys-314. It also contains a tyrosine in place of Trp-307, a change that appeared to increase receptor expression, and an NH2-terminal FLAG epitope tag. As shown here, these changes altered the ability of the rat LHR to respond to bLH, hCG partial agonists, and other hCG analogs in ways that provided new insights into receptor function. The small size of these SSD enabled us to develop models of the glycoprotein hormone receptors that are consistent with most data on ligand binding and signaling, including the finding that only two mutations of the FSHR are needed to enable it to interact with hFSH and hCG (16Vassart G. Pardo L. Costagliola S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 119-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Models described here will also explain many features of the TSHR, including its subunit nature (17Tanaka K. Chazenbalk G.D. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. J. Biol.

Moyle W.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 303: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Other constructs encoding hormone analogs (Fig. 1) were produced by PCR. These included a disulfide cross-linked analog of hCG (α5-β8hCG) in which α-subunit residue Gln5 and β-subunit residue Arg8 were converted to cysteines, an analog of α5-β8hCG lacking the α-subunit glycosylation signal at loop 2 residue 52 (α5-β8hCG-αN52D), an analog of α5-β8hCG having a glycosylation signal at β-subunit loop 3 residue 77 made by converting βPro78 and βVal79 to serine and threonine (α5-β8hCG-βCHO77), and an analog of α5-β8hCG-αN52D having the β-subunit loop 3 glycosylation signal (α5-β8hCG-αN52DβCHO77). PCR mutagenesis was also used to construct rLHRδ10, an analog of the native rat LHR in which residue Glu267 was joined to Tyr295, residue Trp307 was converted to tyrosine, and residue Cys314 was converted to histidine. (Note, the numbering system used in these studies reflects the absence of the presumed signal peptide, which we assumed to be 26, 22, 17, and 21 residues for the rat LHR, human LHR, rat FSHR, and rat TSHR, respectively.) The hormone and receptor constructs were subcloned into the polylinker of pCI (Promega, Madison, WI), a mammalian expression vector that had been modified as described (23Myers R.V. Wang Y. Moyle W.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1475: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and expressed transiently in COS-7 cells or stably in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Radioiodinated hCG and monoclonal antibodies were prepared using IODO-GEN (Pierce) as described (24Bernard M.P. Cao D. Myers R.V. Moyle W.R. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 327: 278-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Ligand binding was monitored by quantifying the abilities of hCG and bLH to compete with 125I-hCG for binding to the LHR and LHRδ10 on intact cells in physiological buffers (9Bernard M.P. Myers R.V. Moyle W.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 611-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The total volume of the assay was 100 μl. Cyclic AMP accumulation was monitored by radioimmuno-assay using a rabbit cyclic AMP antibody (Strategic Biosolutions, Ramona, CA) and 2′-O-monosuccinyladenosine 3′5′-cyclic monophosphate tyrosine methylester (Sigma) that was radioiodinated as described (25Brooker J. Harper J.F. Terasaki W.L. Moylan R.D. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1979; 10: 1-33PubMed Google Scholar). The total volume of this assay was 60 μl. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego CA). Protein threading was performed with the molecular modeling packages Look (26Lee C. Irizarry K. IBM Systems J. 2001; 40: 592-603Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and Sybyl (Tripos, St. Louis, MO). Depictions in Figs. 7 and 8 were prepared using Molscript (27Kraulis P.J. J. Appl.

Assumptions used during modeling are described under “Results.”Fig. 7Overview of receptor structure. Panel A, view of the LRD and SSD as would be seen looking toward the cell surface. The portions of the SSD that are missing in the SSD of models of the LHR and FSHR are indicated by arrows. The asterisks refer to residues shown in the table (panel C). Panels B and D, views of the LRD and SSD as seen from the transmembrane domain. That in panel D is rotated 90° relative to that in panel B. Panel C, table describing potential contacts in the LRD and SSD of all three glycoprotein hormone receptors. The single and double asterisks refer to residues in the LRD and SSD, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 8hCG and hormone receptor complexes. Panel A, the structure of hCG illustrating the relative positions of antibodies that bind to the hormone-receptor complex (pointed arrows) and those that do not (blunted arrows). Although antibodies A113, B101, and B301 are potent inhibitors of hCG-LHR interaction, some of the antibodies that bind to the hormone-receptor complex such as B112 and to a lesser extent B105 and B110 also inhibit complex formation. The broken curved line is drawn to illustrate the top surface of the LRD. Panel B, this panel illustrates the docking of hCG to the extracellular domain of the receptor. Panels C and D, these panels illustrate the orientations that we anticipate are most favorable for docking of hCG and hFSH/hTSH, respectively. Note that the structure of the receptor enables either orientation of the ligand to contact the SSD.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 12Comparison of sequences in regions of the LRD and TMD that we propose are essential for signaling. Panel A, several residues that we anticipate form important interactions between LRD repeats 3–6 (R3, R4, R5, R6), TMD helices 6 and 7 (H6, H7), and TMD outer loop 3 (OL3) are highly conserved in each receptor class. This is particularly evident for asparagine and aspartic acid in R4 and R5, for the lysine in H7, and for the sequence “PLITV” that forms all of outer loop 3. Backbone atoms of outer loop 3 form most of a binding site for the side chain of the lysine in H7 (panels B and C), which is shown boxed and that appears to be required for signaling. The presence of a glycine that corresponds to human TSHR residue Lys639 in one sequence of the rat TSHR (AAA53209.1) is the only receptor that we have been able to find that has a residue other than lysine at this position. A second sequence in the data base (AAG2421.1) suggests that there may be a lysine at this site. All mammalian TSHR have a lysine near the top of helix 6 that appears to face toward the TMD and helix 7. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest the side chains of this lysine and an arginine in the piscine TSHR are near a negatively charged residue in outer loop 2 of the TMD in the TSHR (panel C). This would be expected to attract the top of helix 6 to the TMD. Contacts between LRD repeats 3 (R3) and 6 (R6) and residues at the top of helices 6 (H6) and 7 (H7) appear to influence ligand binding specificity and differ between the hormone classes. The arrows indicate the proximity of residues in these repeats relative to residues in outer loop 3. Panel B, relative positions of key residues in a model of the rLHR lacking exon 10 following molecular dynamics simulation. Asp135, which is located in R5 of the LRD, appears to form a salt bridge with Lys573, which is located at the top or H6 in the TMD. Lys583 at the top of H7 appears to be stabilized by hydrogen bonds with backbone atoms of residues in outer loop 3 and with the backbone oxygen of a highly conserved glutamate in the SSD. The side chain of this glutamate also appears to have a role in stabilizing Lys488 in outer loop 2 of the TMD, an interaction that would be expected to contribute to the stability of the SSD-TMD complex. Panel C, relative positions of residues in a model of the human TSHR lacking residues 292–363. Unlike rLHR-Asp135, the corresponding hTSHR residue (i.e. Asp139) does not appear to participate in contacts with H6, most likely because an asparagine is substituted for the lysine corresponding to rLHR-Lys573. Several other contacts between residues in the LRD and outer loop 3 of the TSHR appear to stabilize interactions between the LRD and the TMD, however (not shown). Lys630 in H6 is located in a position in which it appears to form a salt bridge with Asp552 in outer loop 2, a phenomenon that would be expected to potentiate movements of H6 toward the TMD following TSHR binding, antibody binding, or trypsin digestion. As in the case of the LHR, the lysine in H7 of the TSHR appears to form hydrogen bonds with backbone atoms of residues in outer loop 3 and Glu388 of the SSD. Also, as in the case of the rLHR, the side chain of Glu388 appears to form a salt bridge with the side chain of Lys544, a lysine in outer loop 2. This interaction would be expected to help stabilize the positions of the SSD and TMD.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Influence of the SSD on Ligand Binding—rLHRδ10 was derived from an analog of the rat LHR that contains a modified FLAG tag that does not require calcium for binding of the M1 anti-FLAG tag antibody. The presence of the epitope tag did not affect the ability of the rat LHR to bind hCG or bovine LH or to make cyclic AMP in response to hCG-δα2 (Figs. 2A and 3A). In most studies, the concentrations of hCG required to prevent binding of 125I-hCG to CHO cells that expressed rLHRδ10 were similar to those that inhibited binding of 125I-hCG to CHO cells that express the rat LHR (Fig. 2B). This suggested that both receptors had roughly equivalent affinities for hCG. Smaller amounts of hCG-δα2 were required to inhibit the binding of 125I-hCG to CHO to cells expressing rLHRδ10, however (Fig. 2B), indicating that it appeared to have a slightly greater ability to bind an hCG analog lacking the oligosaccharide on α-subunit loop 2. In contrast, bLH competed poorly with 125I-hCG for binding to rLHRδ10 (Fig. 2B). Thus, whereas 200–300 ng of bLH were required to inhibit the binding of 125I-hCG to the rat LHR by 50% in this assay, more than 10 μg of bLH was required to halve the binding of 125I-hCG to rLHRδ10 (Fig. 2). This showed that the ability of bLH to recognize hLHRδ10 was at least 30–50-fold lower than its ability to recognize the rat LHR. In this regard, rLHRδ10 behaved more like the human LHR than the rat LHR (9Bernard M.P. Myers R.V. Moyle W.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 611-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These differences in the abilities of bLH to bind the rat LHR and rLHRδ10 showed that residues missing or replaced in the SSD of rLHRδ10 have roles in the binding of some lutropins. These finding are consistent with reports that regions of the rat LHR outside the LRD can influence the LHR binding of ovine LH, a lutropin similar to bLH (31Abell A. Liu X. Segaloff D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4518-4527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).Fig. 3Influence of the SSD on signal transduction. Panel A, hCG and an analog prepared by deglycosylation of the same highly purified hCG preparation was used to stimulate the FLAG-tagged rat LHR in the presence of 2 mm IBMX, an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase. Values illustrate the total amounts of cyclic AMP produced (i.e. that in the medium plus that in the cells, means of triplicate incubations). Solid squares and circles represent the responses to hCG and hCG-δα2. Open squares and circles represent the responses to 10 and 30 ng of α5-β8hCG and α5-β8hCG-N52D, analogs containing an NH2-terminal cross-link. The efficacy of α5-β8hCG was not different from that of hCG. hCG-δα2 had ∼70% the efficacy of hCG in this assay (solid circles) as did the NH2-terminal cross-linked analog lacking the oligosaccharide on α-subunit loop 2 (open circles). Panel B, efficacy of hCG and hCG-δα2 in cells expressing the rat LHR and rLHRδ10. Cells expressing the rat LHR and rLHRδ10 were exposed to increasing amounts of hCG and hCG-δα2 in the presence of IBMX. hCG-δα2 had ∼55% the efficacy of hCG in cells expressing the rat LHR (solid lines). It had only 25% the efficacy of hCG in cells expressing the rLHRδ10 receptor (broken lines). Panel C, influence of an oligosaccharide added to β-subunit residue 77 on signal transduction through the rLHRδ10 receptor. The indicated hormone analogs were produced by transient expression of COS-7 cells. The media were concentrated by ultrafiltration and the concentrations of analogs were determined by sandwich immunoassays. As shown here, the presence of the intersubunit disulfide cross-link reduced the efficacy of hCG in assays that involve the rLHRδ10 receptor. Efficacy was diminished further by elimination of the α-subunit loop 2 oligosaccharide. Addition of an oligosaccharide near the tip of β-subunit loop 3 at residue 77 led to an increase in efficacy in both the cross-linked and cross-linked deglycosylated analogs. Panel D, signal transduction responses to hCG, hLH, and bLH in rat LHR and rLHRδ10 receptor expressing CHO cells. Cells expressing the rat LHR and the rLHRδ10 receptor were treated with hCG, hLH, and bLH. Note that the response to hLH was equivalent to that of hCG in both cell types. bLH had a significantly lower potency than either hCG or hLH in both cell types. These assays were performed in a volume of 60 μl.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The seatbelt is responsible for much of the influence of the β-subunit on receptor binding specificity (32Campbell R.K.

To learn if the seatbelt can affect interactions of the glycoprotein hormones with the SSD, we tested the abilities of rLHRδ10 to recognize hCG/hFSH chimeras. One of these has its small seatbelt loop derived from the hFSH β-subunit and is known to bind LHR roughly 8–12% as well as hCG (32Campbell R.K. Dean Emig D.M. Moyle W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This hormone chimera inhibited 125I-hCG binding to the rat LHR ∼10% as well as hCG, but had a much lower ability to inhibit the binding of 125I-hCG to the rLHRδ10 (Fig. 2D). This showed that the SSD domain may compensate for mutations in the small seat-belt loop that are known to reduce the ability of hCG to interact with the rat LHR. Substitution of hFSH residues for those in the hCG strap, i.e. the COOH-terminal half of the seatbelt, creates bifunctional chimeras that interact with the rat LHR like hCG and that bind the rat FSHR roughly one-third as well as hFSH (33Moyle W.R. Campbell R.K. Myers R.V. Bernard M.P. Han Y. Wang X. Nature. 1994; 368: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Bifunctional chimera CF101–109 bound to the FLAG-tagged rat LHR receptor similar to hCG (Fig. 2A), but poorly to rLHRδ10 (Fig. 2C). Although this finding is consistent with the notion that hCG residues in the strap interact with parts of the SSD that are altered or missing in the rLHRδ10, this seems unlikely because many hCG analogs in which the seatbelt is latched to different parts of the α-subunit (36Xing Y. Lin W. Jiang M. Myers R.V. Cao D. Bernard M.P. Moyle W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46953-46960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) recognized the rat LHR much better than CF101–109 bound to rLHRδ10 (Fig. 2C). The hFSH residues in the straps of these chimeras alter the conformation of the heterodimer (37Wang Y.H. Bernard M.P. Moyle W.R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 170: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), indicating that the reduced abilities of CF101–109 and CFC101–114 to bind rLHRδ10 might reflect their altered conformations. hFSH has less than 0.01% the activity of hCG in rat LHR binding assays; hCG/hFSH chimeras in which both the loop and the strap regions are derived from hCG have less than 1% of the activity of hCG in rat LHR assays (32Campbell R.K. Dean Emig D.M. Moyle W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Both hFSH and these chimeras were inactive in assays employing the rLHRδ10 receptor (not shown). Influence of the SSD on Efficacy—To learn if the SSD contributes to hormone efficacy, we measured cyclic AMP accumulation in response to hCG and hCG-δα2, a partial agonist analog that lacks the oligosaccharide at residue Asn52 in loop α2. As noted earlier, the rLHRδ10 receptor has an NH2-terminal FLAG epitope tag. To learn if this would influence its ability to respond to hCG and hCG-δα2, we tested the abilities of these analogs to stimulate cyclic AMP accumulation in assays employing the FLAG-LHR. The presence of the epitope tag was not responsible for the reduced ability of the rLHRδ10 bearing cells to respond to hCG-δα2 (Fig. 3A). In assays employing cells that express the FLAG-LHR, the maximum amount of cyclic AMP accumulation observed in the presence of IBMX in response to hCG-δα2 was 70% that observed in response to hCG (Fig. 3A), a value that is equivalent to or greater than that observed in assays employing the rat LHR (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, the FLAG epitope did not affect the maximal responses to α5-β8hCG, an analog that has an NH2-terminal cross-link, or to α5-β8hCG,δα52, a cross-linked analog that is missing the oligosaccharide on α-subunit loop 2 (Fig. 3A). Cells expressing the rLHRδ10 receptor recognized hCG-δα2 better than they recognized hCG (Fig. 2B); their abilities to accumulate cyclic AMP in response to hCG-δα2 were less than half of those of cells that express the rat LHR in media lacking the in"

It is the ligand for both ionotropic GABA type A receptors and metabotropic GABA type B (GABAB) receptors. GABAB receptors belong to G-protein-coupled receptor class III, which includes metabotropic glutamate receptors, Ca2+-sensing receptors, and some pheromone and taste receptors (1Blein S. Hawrot E. Barlow P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 635-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Agonist and antagonists of GABAB receptors have been shown to be effective in clinical cases or animal models of nociception, depression, addiction, epilepsy, and cognitive impairment. Selective GABAB receptor ligands could also be useful in the treatment of peripheral nervous system disorders (2Bowery N.G. Bettler B. Froestl W. Gallagher J.P. Marshall F. Raiteri M. Bonner T.I.

Neurosci. 2000; 16: 296-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The GABAB receptor is composed of subunits termed GABAB R1 and GABAB R2, both of which are needed for receptor function (4White J.H. Wise A. Main M.J. Green A. Fraser N.J. Disney G.H. Nature. 1998; 396: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar, 5Kaupmann K. Malitschek B. Schuler V. Heid J. Froestl W. Beck P.

Science. 1999; 283: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). The two subunits share a similar molecular architecture, common to all class III G-protein-coupled receptors, consisting of a large extracellular N-terminal domain encompassing a ligand-binding site, followed by a transmembrane heptahelical domain and an intracellular C-terminal tail. Coupling to G-proteins is mediated by the intracellular loops connecting the transmembrane helices and the C-terminal region. In class III G-protein-coupled receptors, the extracellular domain of each subunit is proposed to have a dynamic bilobate structure, where the two globular lobes form a “clamshell”-like shape. The current model for the function of these dimers suggests that upon ligand binding, closure of the two lobes in only one of the two domains is sufficient to create a relative change in orientation between the two subunits, which in turn results in the activation of G-proteins (8Pin J.-P. Galvez T. Prezeau L. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 98: 325-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). In the case of GABAB receptors, this model is consistent with the observations that only the GABAB R1 subunit is able to bind GABAB agonists or antagonists with measurable potency (5Kaupmann K.

Nature. 1998; 396: 674-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar), that the GABAB R2 subunit is important for coupling to G-proteins (9Robbins M.J. Calver A.R. Filippov A.K. Hirst W.D.

Duthey B. Kniazeff J. Blahos J. Rovelli G. Bettler B. Prezeau L. Pin J.-P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2152-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Further evidence that the GABAB R1 and GABAB R2 subunit extracellular domains are in direct contact is provided by time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments (12Liu J. Maurel D. Etzol S. Brabet I. Ansanay H. Pin J.-P. Rondard P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15824-15830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). With regard to the GABAB R1 subunit, three splice variants are defined by the presence of one (human GABAB R1c), two (human/rat GABAB R1a), or neither (human/rat GABAB R1b) of the putative complement control protein (CCP) modules at the N terminus, prior to the GABA-binding domain (13Calver A.R. Medhurst A.D. Robbins M.J. Charles K.J. Evans M.L. Harrison D.C. Stammers M. Hughes S.A. Hervieu G. Couve A. Moss S.J. Middlemiss D.N. Pangalos M.N.

Two other variations of the GABAB R1 subunit occur: in the fifth extracellular loop (rat GABAB R1c) and at the C terminus (human GABAB R1d) (13Calver A.R. Medhurst A.D. Robbins M.J. Charles K.J. Evans M.L. Harrison D.C. Stammers M. Hughes S.A. Hervieu G. Couve A. Moss S.J. Middlemiss D.N. Pangalos M.N. Neuroscience. 2000; 100: 155-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 15Isomoto S. Kaibara M. Sakurai-Yamashita Y. Nagayama Y. Uezono Y. Yano K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 10-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Finally, GABAB R1e is a soluble truncated version of GABAB R1a (16Schwarz D.A. Barry G. Eliasof S.D. Petroski R.E. Conlon P.J. Maki R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32174-32181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The human GABAB R1c splice variant is unrelated to rat GABAB R1c and differs from GABAB R1a in that it has a 62-amino acids deletion that removes the second CCP module-like sequence. The function of GABAB R1c has not been reported, but reverse transcription-PCR studies showed up-regulation of this variant in fetal brain (13Calver A.R. Medhurst A.D. Robbins M.J. Charles K.J. Evans M.L. Harrison D.C. Stammers M. Hughes S.A. Hervieu G. Couve A. Moss S.J. Middlemiss D.N. Pangalos M.N. Neuroscience. 2000; 100: 155-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Thus, it is the presence of the putative N-terminal CCP modules that is the differentiating factor between three of the principal variants discovered so far. Significant differences in expression levels within tissues and during development occur between GABAB heterodimers containing GABAB R1a versus those containing GABAB R1b (13Calver A.R. Medhurst A.D. Robbins M.J. Charles K.J. Evans M.L. Harrison D.C. Stammers M. Hughes S.A. Hervieu G. Couve A. Moss S.J. Middlemiss D.N. Pangalos M.N. Neuroscience. 2000; 100: 155-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). There are, however, no known differences in the pharmacological profiles of the two (17Calver A.R. Davies C.H. Pangalos M. Neurosignals. 2002; 11: 299-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In this respect, observations that the putative CCP modules of GABAB R1a interact with the extracellular matrix are intriguing (17Calver A.R. Davies C.H. Pangalos M. Neurosignals. 2002; 11: 299-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 18White J.H. Ginham R.L. Pontier S. Wise A. Blein S. Barlow P.N. Bouvier M. McIlhinney R.A.J.

The 143 residues distinguishing GABAB R1a from GABAB R1b are thought to form a tandemly arranged pair of CCP modules (22Hawrot E. Xiao Y. Shi Q.L. Norman D. Kirkitadze M. Barlow P.N. FEBS Lett. 1998; 432: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 23Bettler B. Kaupmann K. Bowery N.G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), the only examples of CCP modules suspected to occur in any seven-transmembrane domain receptor. CCP modules are the predominant module type within several soluble and cell-surface regulators of complement activation (24Kirkitadze M.D. Barlow P.N. Immunol. Rev. 2001; 180: 146-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), but another example of a central nervous system protein that contains CCP modules is the 87.6-kDa human equivalent to mouse SEZ-6 (25Herbst R. Nicklin M.J. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 44: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 26Shimizu-Nishikawa K. Kajiwara K. Sugaya E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). SEZ-6 is a single transmembrane domain mouse protein of unknown function whose expression is enhanced by perfusion of brain slices with convulsant drugs. Although some examples of CCP modules act merely as structural or spacer units in bigger proteins, wherever they occur toward the N terminus of a well studied cell-surface protein, they have been shown to participate in specific protein-protein interactions (22Hawrot E. Xiao Y. Shi Q.L. Norman D. Kirkitadze M. Barlow P.N. FEBS Lett. 1998; 432: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of a typical CCP module has a compact hydrophobic core containing conserved residues sandwiched between small antiparallel β-sheets. Four conserved cysteines are disulfide-linked Cys-I–Cys-III and Cys-II–Cys-IV. The sequence of the first putative CCP module of GABAB R1a (CCP1) is a less typical example of a CCP module than the second CCP module-like sequence (CCP2) and has an insertion of 12 residues (Arg43–Asn54; numbering refers to the rat GABAB R1a amino acid sequence and includes the signal sequence) that would be expected to be part of the “hypervariable” loop (22Hawrot E. Xiao Y. Shi Q.L. Norman D. Kirkitadze M. Barlow P.N. FEBS Lett. 1998; 432: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). There is also an N-terminal extension of seven residues (Gly17–Asn23) in CCP1 that is not part of the CCP module consensus. N-Glycosylation sites found in the GABAB R1a CCPs are exclusively located in the CCP1 amino acid sequence (at Asn23 and Asn83). We now show that the two CCP modules of GABAB R1a have striking structural differences. The first module is not compactly folded, whereas CCP2 is a regular CCP module with particularly high structural similarity to the third module of the decay-accelerating factor (DAF) of complement. Despite being poorly structured, CCP1 exhibits the standard disulfide pattern and is able, like the intact GABAB R1a subunit, to bind the extracellular matrix protein fibulin-2. Construction of Expression Vectors encoding CCP1, CCP2, and CCP12—DNA fragments encoding rat CCP1 (Gly17–Ile98), CCP2 (Val96–Asn159), and CCP12 (Gly17–Asn159) were amplified by PCR using a DNA template prepared by Dr. Edward Hawrot (Brown University, Providence, RI). The sense primer used to amplify the CCP1 and CCP12 DNA fragments was designed to include the first seven residues of the mature rat GABAB R1a gene product so that the first residue of the recombinant protein corresponds to Gly17, which immediately follows the putative signal peptide sequence. The sense primer for the CCP2 DNA fragment was designed to include the three “linker” residues (Val96–Ile98) between the fourth consensus Cys of CCP1 and the first consensus Cys of CCP2. The antisense primer used to amplify the CCP2 and CCP12 DNA fragments was designed to include the three residues following the fourth consensus Cys of CCP2; the antisense primer used to amplify CCP1 was designed to include Val96–Ile98. All sense primers incorporated an EcoRI restriction site, and all antisense primers incorporated a NotI restriction site as well as two stop codons. Each resulting PCR product was gel-purified, digested with EcoRI/NotI, and ligated into the same sites of the pPICZαA yeast expression vector (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). All plasmids were sequenced to confirm the desired DNA sequence and the correct reading frame. DNA midi-preparations of the expression constructs were prepared using the Wizard Plus midi-preparation DNA purification kit (Promega, Southampton, UK). For each CCP construct, 10 μg of SacI-linearized plasmid were electroporated into Pichia pastoris strain KM71H(MutS) according to the recommendations of Invitrogen. Zeocin-resistant colonies were then tested for protein expression; colonies expressing the most recombinant protein were picked for large-scale protein preparations. Expression and Isotope Labeling—For each protein construct, a single colony was used to inoculate a starter culture (10 ml) of buffered minimal glycerol (BMG; 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6 or 3), 1.34% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base (YNB; with (NH4)2SO4 and without amino acids), 1% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.00004% (w/v) biotin). After 2 days of incubation at 30 °C (250 rpm), this starter culture was diluted to 1 liter with BMG; equal portions were transferred into four 1-liter baffled flasks; and the flasks were shaken at 30 °C for an additional 2 days (A600 nm ∼ 13–15). Cells were then pelleted at 1500 × g for 5 min at room temperature and transferred to 200 ml of buffered minimal methanol medium (100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6 or 3), 1.34% (w/v) YNB (with (NH4)2SO4 and without amino acids), 0.5% (v/v) methanol, and 0.00004% (w/v) biotin) for induction. Inductions were performed over 5 days at 25 °C. Cells were resuspended in fresh induction medium daily, and supernatants were stored at -20 °C with protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and 5 mm EDTA) while awaiting purification. For 15N isotope labeling, cultures were grown in modified BMG in which 1.34% (w/v) YNB was replaced with 0.34% (w/v) YNB (without (NH4)2SO4 and without amino acids) supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) (15NH4)2SO4 (15N/YNB). For 13C/15N isotope labeling, a 13C/15N buffered minimal dextrose medium (100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6 or 3), 15N/YNB, 0.5% (w/v) [13C]glucose, and 0.00004% (w/v) biotin) was used instead of BMG. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation as described above and resuspended in 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 3), 15N/YNB, 0.1% (w/v) [13C]glycerol, and 0.00004% (w/v) biotin for 2 h prior to induction. This stage allows a smooth transition between glucose and methanol as the sole carbon source for the cells and was found to reduce cell death. Induction for both 15N and 13C/15N isotope labeling was carried out using buffered minimal methanol medium containing 15N/YNB instead of 14N/YNB. For 13C/15N isotope labeling, buffered minimal methanol medium was prepared with [13C]methanol. All isotopically labeled compounds were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Ltd. (Cambridge, MA). Purification—Supernatants were filtered through a 0.2-μm filter and concentrated 50-fold using a combination of a preparative scale spiral wound filter module (Millipore, Watford, UK) linked to a peristaltic pump and an N2-pressurized stirred cell (Millipore) at 4 °C. The concentrated proteins were purified by cation exchange chromatography (Mono S HR 5/5, Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, UK) with a 0–1 m NaCl gradient over 25 column volumes; CCP1 and CCP12 were buffered in 12.5 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.3), and CCP2 was buffered in 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.6). Following this initial cation exchange step, CCP1 and CCP12 were deglycosylated with endoglycosidase Hf (3000 units/mg of recombinant protein) for 6–8 h at 37 °C. Endoglycosidase Hf was removed by reloading the cleavage mixture onto the Mono S column; traces of glycosylated material were removed by concanavalin A-Sepharose chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). All recombinant fragments were further purified by reverse-phase chromatography (RP2 column, Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) with a 10–60% acetonitrile and 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid gradient over 34 column volumes. Protein yields were on the order of 8 mg/preparation. The N-terminal sequence of each protein construct was confirmed by amino acid sequencing (Dr. A. Cronshaw, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK). Protein concentrations were calculated using absorbance at 280 nm and a theoretical extinction coefficient based on the protein sequence (ProtParam Tool, available at www.expasy.org). Mass Spectrometry—All GABAB R1a CCP fragments were examined by mass spectrometry using positive electrospray ionization on a Micromass Platform-II instrument. The number of disulfide bonds present in CCP1 and CCP12 was deduced from a series of alkylation/reduction experiments using dithiothreitol (DTT) and neutralized iodoacetic acid treatment (27Imoto T. Yamada H. Creigthon T.E. Protein Function: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1997: 279-316Google Scholar), followed by a combination of reverse-phase chromatography and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The disulfide bond pattern in a “truncated” version of CCP1 (lacking the sevenresidue N-terminal extension) was analyzed by trypsin digestion and sequencing of the resulting fragments on a Micromass hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Binding Experiments—For antibody (Ab) production, a fragment of fibulin-2 containing the C-terminal residues 1069–1184 (F2C) was amplified using the appropriate primers. The product was cloned into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of the vector pGEX-4T-2 (Amersham Biosciences), and the protein was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS. The resulting fusion protein, GST-F2C, was purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose and subsequently used to immunize New Zealand White rabbits. To produce an Ab specific to F2C, the rabbit serum was first absorbed onto Sepharose coupled to GST before purification with Sepharose coupled to GST-F2C. Both affinity resins were produced by coupling GST and GST-F2C to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Sigma, Gillingham, UK) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. To generate a stable cell line expressing fibulin, a DNA fragment encoding full-length fibulin-2 tagged with the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope at the N terminus was cloned in the pcIn6 vector (28Rees S. Coote J. Stables J. Goodson S. Harris S. Lee M.G. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) and transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Clones secreting the protein were primarily selected using 1 mg/ml Geneticin (Sigma). A stable cell line was subsequently produced by the limiting dilution method and maintained with 0.5 mg/ml Geneticin. The secreted fibulin could be detected in the cell medium as an immunoreactive band at ∼200 kDa with the anti-F2C Ab or as a pair of bands at ∼200 and 180 kDa using an anti-HA epitope monoclonal Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) (see Fig. 2a). The 180-kDa band probably represents a C-terminal cleavage of the protein, whereas the larger band is consistent with full-length fibulin-2 (29Pan T.-C. Sasaki T. Lang R.Z. Fassler R. Timpl R. Chu M.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1269-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). For production of larger quantities of an F2C-Sepharose resin, a DNA construct encoding the F2C domain was inserted in the pET-32a(+) vector using the NcoI and XhoI sites (Merck Biosciences, Nottingham, UK). The resulting plasmid allowed expression of the F2C domain as a fusion protein with thioredoxin (Trx) and various affinity purification tags between the two domains, including a polyhistidine tag (Trx-F2C). BL21(DE3) pLysS cells transformed with the Trx-F2C vector were grown to large-scale in LB selective broth (37 °C), and protein expression was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. Protein purification was performed using the Talon metal affinity resin (Clontech), and the purified protein was subsequently coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B. Similarly, we produced CCP12-, CCP1-, and CCP2-Sepharose by coupling purified CCP fragments (see above) to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B. Native GABAB receptors were prepared from rat brain synaptic membranes by sucrose gradient centrifugation using 6–8-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats (30Molnar E. McIlhinney R.A.J. Baude A. Nusser Z. Somogyi P. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Solubilization of the membranes was achieved by incubating them at a detergent/protein ratio of 5:1 in 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) containing protease inhibitors (Complete protease inhibitor mixture, Roche Diagnostics, Lewes, UK), 20 mm iodoacetamide, and 0.1 m NaCl for 15 min on ice. The lysate was adjusted to 0.2% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 67,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C before aliquots were used in pull-down experiments with Trx-F2C-Sepharose. Recombinant GABAB receptors were prepared from cells permanently expressing GABAB R1a or GABAB R1b with GABAB R2 subunits as described previously (31White J.H. McIllhinney R.A. Wise A. Ciruela F. Chan W.Y. Emson P.C. Billinton A. Marshall F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13967-13972Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to confluence in 25-cm2 flasks, harvested, and then lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm iodoacetamide supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete protease inhibitor mixture)) for 15 min at 4 °C. The lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, and aliquots of the supernatant were used in pull-down experiments with Trx-F2C-Sepharose. Pull-down experiments were performed overnight at 4 °C using 100-μl volumes of the appropriate affinity supports and GST-Sepharose as a control resin. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and once with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) before the adsorbed proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), containing 1% (w/v) SDS, 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol or 20 mm DTT, 0.005% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) for 15 min at 60 °C. Eluted proteins were analyzed on either 7.5 or 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and immunoblotted with an anti-sheep GABAB R1 subunit Ab (4White J.H. Wise A. Main M.J. Green A. Fraser N.J. Disney G.H.

A. 2000; 97: 13967-13972Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) or the anti-HA epitope monoclonal Ab. Immunoblots were developed using the Supersignal substrate (Perbio Science, Tattenhall, UK) on a Bio-Rad Fluor-Smax imaging system. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Measurements were performed on a Jasco Model 810 spectropolarimeter. Measurements were recorded at 20 °C in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5). The protein concentrations used were 12 and 36 μm in far- and near-UV experiments, respectively. Each CD spectrum represents the average of five scans (far-UV) or seven scans (near-UV) and was corrected by subtraction of a spectrum obtained for a solution lacking the protein but otherwise identical. The resulting spectrum was further smoothed using the Means-Movement method included in the Spectra-Manager software (Jasco Ltd., Great Dunmow, UK). Plots of percentage fraction unfolded versus concentration of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) were derived from the average of five points, the maximal ellipticity and readings at ±1.2 and ±2.4 nm, to smooth experimental errors in the curves. Measurements were performed in triplicate, and pH was verified to be 7.5 in all GdnHCl-containing samples. The concentrations of GdnHCl stock solutions were confirmed using an Abbé Model B refractometer (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and applying the formula [M] = 57.147(ΔN) + 38.68(ΔN)2 - 91.6(ΔN)3, where ΔN is the difference between the refraction coefficient of the buffer and that of the GdnHCl solution (made with the same buffer) being assayed (32Pace C.N. Shirley B.A. Thomson J.A. Creigthon T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. 2nd Ed. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1990: 311-331Google Scholar). Reduction of the disulfide bonds was performed by adding DTT to a final concentration of 10–20 mm to the different protein fragments using a 1.25 m stock solution. Samples were then left to equilibrate overnight at 20 °C under N2. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)—Calorimetric measurements were carried out on a VP-DSC differential scanning microcalorimeter (MicroCal, Northampton, UK) at the Microcalorimetry Facility of the University of Glasgow by Prof. Alan Cooper. The cell volume was 0.5 ml; the heating rate was 1 °C/min; and the excess pressure was kept at 25 p.s.i. All protein fragments were used at a concentration of 40 μm in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5). The molar heat capacity of each protein was estimated by comparison with duplicate samples containing identical buffer from which the protein had been omitted. The partial molar heat capacities and melting curves were analyzed using standard procedures (33Privalov P.L. Potekhin S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 4-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). 1-Anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic Acid (ANS) Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded with a Fluoromax-3 spectrometer (Jobin-Yvon Ltd., Middlesex, UK).

Here we showed that the major surface protein S of a porcine CoV (transmissible gastroenteritis virus) is not transported to the cell surface but is retained intracellularly. Site-directed mutagenesis indicated that a tyrosine-dependent signal (YXXI) in the cytoplasmic tail is essential for intracellular localization of the S protein. Surface expression of mutant proteins was evident by immunofluorescence analysis and surface biotinylation. Intracellularly retained S proteins only contained endoglycosidase H-sensitive N-glycans, whereas mutant proteins that migrated to the plasma membrane acquired N-linked oligosaccharides of the complex type. Corresponding tyrosine residues are present in the cytoplasmic tails of the S proteins of other animal CoV but not in the tail portion of the S protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV. Changing the SEPV tetrapeptide in the cytoplasmic tail to YEPI resulted in intracellular retention of the S protein of SARS-CoV. As the S proteins of CoV have receptor binding and fusion activities and are the main target of neutralizing antibodies, the differences in the transport behavior of the S proteins suggest different strategies in the virus host interactions between SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses.

In enveloped viruses, virion morphogenesis is the result of a budding process at a cellular membrane (1Compans R.W. Herrler G. Ogra P.L. Mestecky J. Lamm M.E. Strober W. Bienenstock J. McGhee J.R. Mucosal Immunology. Academic Press, New York1999: 671-683Google Scholar). This maturation process may occur at the plasma membrane, e.g. in the case of human immunodeficiency virus or influenza viruses, or at an intracellular compartment. Coronavirus (CoV) 1The abbreviations used are: CoV, coronavirus; SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome; TGEV, transmissible gastroenteritis virus; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; S, S protein. maturation takes place at the cis-Golgi network also known as endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (2Tooze J.

Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 55-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The surface proteins of enveloped viruses are usually transported to the membrane compartment where a budding process results in the release of virions. This has been shown for model viruses such as the influenza and vesicular stomatitis viruses (1Compans R.W. Herrler G. Ogra P.L. Mestecky J. Lamm M.E. Strober W. Bienenstock J. McGhee J.R. Mucosal Immunology. Academic Press, New York1999: 671-683Google Scholar). There are, however, examples of viruses where the sites of glycoprotein accumulation and virus maturation do not coincide. The measles virus is released from the apical plasma membrane of polarized epithelial cells, although both the H and F proteins are predominantly transported to the basolateral cell surface (4Maisner A. Klenk H. Herrler G. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5276-5278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the Marburg virus is released from the basolateral plasma membrane, although the viral glycoprotein gp is expressed mainly on the apical surface (5Sanger C. Muhlberger E. Ryabchikova E. Kolesnikova L. Klenk H.D. Becker S. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1274-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Coronaviruses are known human and animal pathogens that mainly affect the epithelium of the respiratory or intestinal tract. They are positive-stranded RNA viruses that contain three membrane proteins incorporated into the lipid envelope, M, S, and E. The M protein is a glycoprotein with three or four transmembrane domains (6Escors D. Camafeita E. Ortego J. Laude H. Enjuanes L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 12228-12240Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Its large carboxyl terminus is oriented toward the cytoplasm and most probably interacts with the nucleocapsid during budding (7Escors D. Ortego J. Laude H. Enjuanes L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1312-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). When expressed alone, the M is localized in the cis-Golgi network or cis-Golgi complex as reported for transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (8Risco C. Muntion M. Enjuanes L. Carrascosa J.L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4022-4031Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and for avian infectious bronchitis virus (9Machamer C.E. Mentone S.A. Rose J.K. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6944-6948Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), or it reaches the trans-Golgi cisternae or the trans-Golgi network in the case of the murine hepatitis virus (10Klumperman J. Locker J.K. Meijer A. Horzinek M.C. Geuze H.J. Rottier P.J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6523-6534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The information for the intracellular localization of M resides within the first transmembrane domain (11Swift A.M. Machamer C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and additionally, in the carboxyl-terminal portion (12Locker J.K. Klumperman J. Oorschot V. Horzinek M.C. Geuze H.J. Rottier P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28263-28269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The E protein is a small membrane protein with a single membrane-spanning domain. It has been reported to transiently reside in a pre-Golgi compartment (13Lim K.P. Liu D.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17515-17523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) before it progresses to the Golgi apparatus (14Corse E. Machamer C.E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4319-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 15Corse E. Machamer C.E. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1273-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The six carboxyl-terminal amino acids, RDKLYS, have been shown to be essential for the temporary retention within the pre-Golgi compartment (13Lim K.P. Liu D.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17515-17523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The third membrane protein, the spike (S) glycoprotein, forms the corona-like projections of the virion surface on electron micrographs (16Enjuanes L. Brian D. Cavanagh D. Holmes K. Lai M.M.C.

Wickner R.B. Virus Taxonomy. Academic Press, New York2000: 835-849Google Scholar). It has receptor-binding and membrane-fusion activities and is the main target of the immune response elicited by a coronavirus infection. Using Vaccinia virus or baculovirus expression systems, the S protein has been found to be present on the cell surface, although transport kinetics suggested a very inefficient transport (17Godet M. Rasschaert D. Laude H. Virology. 1991; 185: 732-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 18Vennema H. Heijnen L. Zijderveld A. Horzinek M.C. Spaan W.J. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 339-346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results together with the finding that M and E protein can induce the formation of virus-like particles (19Vennema H. Godeke G.J. Rossen J.W. Voorhout W.F. Horzinek M.C. Opstelten D.J. Rottier P.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2020-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) suggested that the S protein does not determine the site of virus maturation. We used plasmid vectors for the expression of the S protein of porcine TGEV, and the human coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV). We found that the TGEV S protein is intracellularly retained because of a tyrosine-based signal within the cytoplasmic tail. In contrast, the S protein of SARS-CoV lacks a tyrosine residue in the corresponding tail portion as revealed by sequence alignments, and in fact, it is transported to the cell surface. A replacement of the tetrapeptide SEPV by YPEI resulted in intracellular retention of SARS-CoV S protein. Cells—BSR-T7/5 cells stably expressing T7 RNA polymerase were kindly provided by Dr. Conzelmann (Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität, Munich, Germany). The cells were propagated in minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, non-essential amino acids, and 0.5 mg/ml of Geneticin. Construction of Plasmids—The S protein gene of TGEV, strain PUR-46-MAD, (20Penzes Z. Gonzalez J.M. Calvo E. Izeta A. Smerdou C. Mendez A. Sanchez C.M. Sola I. Almazan F. Enjuanes L.

Primer a contained an EcoRI, primer b a PstI restriction site, which allowed to clone the PCR product into the respective sites of the pTM1 vector (21Moss B. Elroy-Stein O. Mizukami T. Alexander W.A.

In parallel, SSS was used as template for a PCR with oligonucleotides c and d. These two PCR products were purified (PCR Purification Kit, Qiagen), mixed in a molar ratio of 1:1, and heated for 2 min at 95 °C for denaturation. The mixture was incubated at 60 °C for 2 min to allow the two fragments to anneal to each other. Hybridization was mediated by overlapping complementary sequences that were introduced into the PCR fragments by 5′-overhangs of the oligonucleotides d and e. A complete double-stranded DNA hybrid was obtained after incubating the mixture with Pfu polymerase (MBI Fermentas) at 72 °C for 1 min and 30 s. The chimeric gene was subsequently amplified by PCR with oligonucleotides c and f. The PCR product was ligated into the pTM1-SSS plasmid using the PstI restriction site at the 5′-end of oligonucleotide f and the SpeI restriction site located ∼50 nucleotides upstream of the binding site of oligonucleotide c. The new part of the resulting plasmid pTM1-SFF was sequenced and found to be identical to the published sequences (GenBank™, M94101, D00152). A similar overlapping PCR technique was applied for the construction of all other chimeric and mutant protein genes. The protein domains and oligonucleotides used are indicated in Fig. 1 and Table I, respectively. For mutants E1441A, P1442A, I1443A, and E1444A the primer pairs p-q, r-s, t-u, and v-w, respectively, were used. The S protein gene of SARS-CoV (strain CUHK-W1) was amplified by PCR from the plasmid pcDNA3.1-S with oligonucleotides A and B and ligated into the pTM1 vector via restriction sites EcoRI and BamHI resulting in the plasmid pTM1-SARS-CoV-S. The sequence of the total open reading frame of SARS-CoV-S was found to be identical to the published sequence (GenBank™ accession number AY278554). Primers used for generation of mutant S1243Y are shown in Fig. 1. For mutant S1243Y/V1246I, oligonucleotides D and E were replaced by F and G. The SARS-CoV-S mutants were generated using restriction sites BamHI (5′-end of oligonucleotide B) and EcoRV (∼80 nucleotides upstream of the oligonucleotide C binding site). Immunofluorescence—BSR-T7/5 cells grown on 12-mm diameter coverslips were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA, 0.5 μg of the plasmid pC-T7Pol (kindly provided by Dr. Kawaoka, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI) coding for T7 RNA polymerase, and 2 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 Reagent (Invitrogen) and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. One part of the fixed cell preparations was permeabilized with 0.2% Triton/phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min. The TGEV-S ectodomain was detected with a monoclonal antibody (6A.C3) against the viral S protein (22Gebauer F. Posthumus W.P. Correa I. Sune C. Smerdou C. Sanchez C.M. Lenstra J.A. Meloen R.H. Enjuanes L. Virology. 1991; 183: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) at a dilution of 1:200 in 1% bovine serum albumin, phosphate-buffered saline followed by incubation with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated second antibody (donkey anti-mouse, 1:200, Acris). For detection of the SARS-CoV-S ectodomain the cells were incubated with human patient serum (1:1000) and antihuman-fluorescein isothiocyanate antibody (from goat, 1:200, Sigma). Fluorescence was visualized with a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope. Surface Biotinylation and Immunoprecipitation of Proteins—BSR-T7/5 cells grown in 35-mm diameter dishes were transfected with 3 μg of plasmid DNA, 1 μg of pC-T7Pol, and 10 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 Reagent. At 24-h post-transfection cell surface proteins were labeled with a N-hydroxy-succinimide ester of biotin (0.5 mg/ml phosphate-buffered saline, Pierce). The viral antigens were immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates as described by Zimmer et al. (23Zimmer G. Budz L. Herrler G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31642-31650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 24Zimmer G. Trotz I. Herrler G. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4744-4751Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, the monoclonal anti-TGEV S protein antibody (6A.C3) was used. Western Blot Analysis of Transfected Cells—At 24-h post-transfection BSR-T7/5 cells grown in 35-mm diameter dishes (see above) were lysed as described by Köhl et al. (25Kohl W. Zimmer G. Greiser-Wilke I. Haas L. Moennig V. Herrler G. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 1101-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis the nitrocellulose was incubated with monoclonal antibody 6A.C3 (1:200) followed by incubation with a peroxidase-conjugated second antibody (goat anti-mouse, 1:1000, DAKO). The bound antibodies were visualized by chemoluminescence (24Zimmer G. Trotz I. Herrler G. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4744-4751Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Radiolabeling and Treatment with Endoglycosidases—At 48-h post-transfection (ExGen 500, Fermentas) BSR-T7/5 cells grown in 35-mm diameter dishes (see above) were metabolically labeled with 50 μCi of [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) for 4 h as described by Alfalah et al. (26Alfalah M. Jacob R. Preuss U. Zimmer K.P. Naim H. Naim H.Y. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 593-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Digestion of [35S]methionine-labeled immunoprecipitates with endoglycosidase H (New England Biolabs) and N-glycosidase F (Roche Applied Science) was performed as described by Naim et al. (27Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The samples were loaded on a 6% SDS-gel (6 mA, overnight, Bio-Rad). After electrophoresis, proteins were visualized using a PhosphorImager (Bio-Rad). The transport of the TGEV S protein was analyzed using plasmid vectors that avoid overexpression. Expression vectors that depended on nuclear transcription turned out to be very inefficient. Therefore, all constructs (Fig. 1) were cloned into the pTM1 vector under the control of the T7 promoter and transiently expressed in BSR-T7/5 cells that stably express the T7 RNA polymerase. Fig. 2 shows that the S protein (SSS) was detectable by fluorescence microscopy after intracellular but not after surface staining. The absence of S protein from the cell surface cannot be explained by rapid internalization, because an antibody uptake assay did not provide any evidence for endocytosis of the S protein (not shown). Glycosylation analysis (see below) also indicates that the lack of surface expression is because of intracellular retention rather than endocytotic uptake. To assign a potential transport signal to the ectodomain, membrane anchor, or cytoplasmic tail, chimeric proteins were generated that contained either one of the two latter domains from the fusion protein (F) of Sendai virus. Replacement of the membrane anchor (Fig. 2, SFS) did not result in a different transport behavior. In contrast, chimeric proteins containing the tail portion (Fig. 2, SSF) or both the tail and the membrane anchor (Fig. 2, SFF) from the Sendai virus F protein were transported to the cell surface. This result strongly suggested that the information determining the intracellular retention of the TGEV S protein is present in the cytoplasmic tail. The range of amino acids within the cytoplasmic tail of the S protein that is required for intracellular retention was narrowed down by an analysis of deletion mutants that lacked 5, 10, or 14 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus. Deletion of the carboxyl-terminal five amino acids (KVHVH) did not alter the transport characteristics of the S protein. However, further truncation of the tail by five residues resulted in a protein that was transported to the cell surface (not shown). This result indicates that the peptide 1440YEPIE1444 contains essential information for the intracellular localization of the S protein. The importance of individual amino acids within this sequence was determined by an alanine scan. Only replacement of Tyr-1440 and Ile-1443 resulted in a transport of S protein to the cell surface (Fig. 3). These data suggest that the intracellular localization signal of the S protein resembles the Tyr-Xxx-Xxx-Ile signal that is responsible in many proteins for endocytosis and/or transport to the basolateral surface of polarized epithelial cells. To confirm the results obtained from immunofluorescence studies, the transport of parental, mutant, and chimeric S proteins to the plasma membrane was analyzed by cell surface biotinylation. Following application of the membrane-impermeable biotinylating reagent to intact cells, only the proteins previously detected by surface immunofluorescence were labeled with biotin, as expected (Fig. 4A). The lysates of cells expressing either of the different proteins were also analyzed by Western blot. Interestingly all proteins that were transported to the cell surface presented a double band profile, whereas intracellularly retained proteins only presented the lower band (Fig. 4B). In the case of the point mutants (Fig. 4B, lanes e and h) the upper band is less prominent than in the case of the chimeric proteins suggesting that amino acids other than the tyrosine and isoleucine residue also contribute to intracellular localization. The upper band most likely represents proteins with complex N-glycans, whereas proteins containing high mannose oligosaccharides are expected in the lower band. To verify this interpretation, radiolabeled cell lysates expressing either the SSS or the SSF protein were subjected to immunoprecipitation and treatment with either endoglycosidase H or N-glycosidase F. Both the lower and the upper band were detected with the SSF protein, whereas the SSS protein revealed only the lower band (Fig. 5). The band between the two forms of the S protein was present also in the mock-transfected samples and is therefore not related to the S protein. Treatment of the SSS protein with endoglycosidase H resulted in a substantial shift to a band with an apparent molecular mass of about 150 kDa. Likewise, a significant reduction in the size of the SSS protein was revealed upon N-glycosidase F treatment although not to the same level as that obtained with endoglycosidase H. This difference is because of the specificity of currently available N-glycosidase F preparations, which make it difficult to completely deglycosylate glycoproteins with a large number of N-glycans. Altogether, the combined analysis with endoglycosidase H and N-glycosidase F indicates that the glycosylation of the lower band is of the high mannose type. The effect of endoglycosidase H treatment on the lower band of the SSF protein was the same as that on the corresponding band of SSS. However, endoglycosidase H treatment of the upper band of SSF resulted only in a slight increase of the electrophoretic mobility indicating that this protein contains only a small number of oligosaccharides of the high mannose type. This band almost migrated with the nonspecific band mentioned above; however, the increased intensity compared with the mock-transfected sample indicates that the endoglycosidase H-digested protein is also located in this position. The predominant resistance of the upper band to endoglycosidase H is consistent with a substantial conversion of the oligosaccharides in this protein form to complex N-glycans in the Golgi apparatus. These results are summarized as follows. When the TGEV S protein contains the YXXI motif it is intracellularly retained, and therefore, not fully glycosylated consisting of a single low sized band. In contrast, when the C-tail of TGEV S protein is substituted by that of the F protein, the retention profile is lost being efficiently transported through the Golgi complex to the cell membrane, as demonstrated by its glycosylation profile.Fig. 5Effect of endoglycosidase treatment on parental (SSS) and chimeric (SSF) TGEV S protein. Transfected BSR-T7/5 cells were radiolabeled and prepared for treatment with endoglycosidases. Samples were incubated with endoglycosidase H (H), N-glycosidase F (F), or in the absence of enzyme (–).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Some well characterized representatives of the different taxonomic groups of coronaviruses are TGEV and feline infectious peritonitis virus (group 1), bovine coronavirus and mouse hepatitis virus (group 2), and infectious bronchitis virus (group 3). Although the S proteins of these viruses show pronounced sequence differences in the cytoplasmic tail portion, they all contain at least one tyrosine residue that might be part of a retention signal. By contrast, the tyrosine residue in the tail of the SARS coronavirus S protein is located at position –2 from the carboxyl terminus and thus cannot be part of a YXXϕ (ϕ representing a large aliphatic amino acid such as isoleucine) motif. We wondered whether the SARS-CoV S protein also contains an intracellular localization signal. Unexpectedly, in contrast to TGEV S protein the SARS-CoV S protein was efficiently transported to the cell surface as observed by surface immunofluorescence (Fig. 6). Interestingly, sequence comparisons showed that the tetrapeptide YEPI within the TGEV S protein that is responsible for S protein intracellular retention closely resembled the tetrapeptide SEPV present in SARS-CoV S protein tail. In both cases, the dipeptide EP is followed by a hydrophobic amino acid (V or I, respectively). Moreover, these motifs have similar locations within the respective cytoplasmic tails, amino acids 7–10 from the carboxyl terminus in the case of TGEV and amino acids 10–13 in the case of SARS-CoV. By site-directed mutagenesis a mutant protein was generated in which the serine was replaced by a tyrosine residue. The S1243Y mutant was transported to the cell surface. However, when in addition to the S → Y exchange the valine was replaced by an isoleucine residue, the resulting S1243Y/V1246I mutant was predominantly retained intracellularly. Only a few cells showed a faint surface staining. This finding demonstrates the importance of the YXXI motif for the intracellular localization of the coronavirus S protein. It is well established that tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic tail of membrane proteins play an important role in intracellular sorting events. Most of these signals conform to the minimal consensus motifs YXXϕ or NPXY. The former type of sorting signal is currently best understood. Depending on the context of a specific protein, YXXϕ signals may mediate rapid internalization from the cell surface, lysosomal targeting, localization to specialized organelles such as antigen-processing compartment or the trans-Golgi network, or delivery to the basolateral plasma membrane of polarized epithelial cells (28Bonifacino J.S. Dell'Angelica E.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). These different functions require the interaction of the signal with recognition molecules associated with the different sites of protein sorting. Binding partners of YXXϕ motifs are a group of adaptor proteins. The μ2 subunit of the heterotetrameric adaptor proteins complex has been shown to interact with the tyrosine-containing sorting signal (29Owen D.J. Evans P.R. Science. 1998; 282: 1327-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). The YXXϕ motif binds in an extended conformation to a region of the μ2 molecule having pockets for both the Y and ϕ residues. Variation in the recognition is achieved by different affinities of the sorting signal to the various adaptor protein complexes, which may be affected by changes within or around the YXXϕ motif. Tyrosine-containing signals are mainly known for regulating post-Golgi transport events. Our data showed that YXXϕ motifs may also affect transport in the early secretory pathway. The CD3 ϵ chain of the T cell receptor has also been demonstrated to contain a retention signal in the cytoplasmic tail (30Mallabiabarrena A. Jimenez M.A. Rico M. Alarcon B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2257-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Here a YXXL motif is responsible for localization within the endoplasmic reticulum. The sequence requirements of the TGEV S protein and CD3 ϵ for intracellular localization are not the same. For the latter protein it has been reported that, in addition to Tyr-177 and Leu-180, Arg-183 is involved in ER retention (31Borroto A. Lama J. Niedergang F. Dautry-Varsat A. Alarcon B. Alcover A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 25-31PubMed Google Scholar). In the corresponding position of the S protein there is a valine residue, a replacement of which does not affect intracellular retention as indicated by analysis of a deletion mutant. The two proteins appear to differ in their interaction with cellular binding partners that mediate intracellular retention. Although the tyrosine and isoleucine residues are critical for the transport behavior of the TGEV S protein, other residues are expected also to affect intracellular localization. A YTDI motif in the tail of the VSV G protein is responsible for targeting of this protein to the basolateral surface of epithelial cells. The cytoplasmic tail of G protein is known to contain a specific export signal for the transport out of the ER. A di-acidic motif around the above mentioned isoleucine residue (Asp-Ile-Glu), has been shown to efficiently recruit G and other proteins to vesicles mediating export from the ER (32Nishimura N. Balch W.E. Science. 1997; 277: 556-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The extended sequence Tyr-Thr-Asp-Ile-Glu-Met comprising the complete YXXI motif has been reported to further increase the export efficiency and to be functional also on proteins that otherwise only inefficiently exit the ER (33Sevier C.S. Weisz O.A. Davis M. Machamer C.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In a recent analysis of the S protein of avian infectious bronchitis virus, the viral glycoprotein was reported to be intracellularly retained because of a dilysine motif that is present also in cellular proteins that are retained in the ER (34Lontok E. Corse E. Machamer C.E. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 5913-5922Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These authors mainly analyzed the chimeric proteins consisting of the ectodomain and transmembrane anchor of the VSV G protein and the cytoplasmic tail of the infectious bronchitis virus. When the 11 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of this chimeric protein were replaced by the corresponding peptide of the S proteins of TGEV or SARS-CoV, the chimeric proteins were retained intracellularly. Retention was shown to be mediated by the two basic residues (lysine and histidine) among the five carboxyl-terminal amino acids (KXHXX). However, this motif appears not to be a major transport signal in the authentic S proteins, (i) a deletion mutant of the TGEV S protein lacking the five carboxyl-terminal residues was still intracellularly retained (this work), and (ii) the S protein of the SARS coronavirus is transported to the cell surface (Ref. 35Simmons G. Reeves J.D. Rennekamp A.J. Amberg S.M. Piefer A.J. Bates P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4240-4245Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar and this work). The KXHXX motif may have a modulating effect, because the endoglycosidase H-resistant form of the S protein was expressed less efficiently by the Y1440A and I1443A mutants than it was by the chimeric proteins. Expression of S proteins from the nucleus was found to be inefficient. As TGEV replicates in the cytoplasm, the S gene may contain cryptic splice sites or other sequence elements that are detrimental for mRNA processing in the nucleus. Efficient expression of the S protein has been reported when Vaccinia virus or baculovirus was used (17Godet M. Rasschaert D. Laude H. Virology. 1991; 185: 732-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 18Vennema H. Heijnen L. Zijderveld A. Horzinek M.C. Spaan W.J. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 339-346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Pulford D.J. Britton P. Virology. 1991; 182: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although these viral vectors are very efficient expression vectors, surface transport of the S protein was inefficient. Using the Vaccinia virus for expression of the S protein of TGEV, only some protein was detected on the plasma membrane, whereas the majority of the S protein was intracellularly retained (36Pulford D.J. Britton P. Virology. 1991; 182: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the case of feline infectious peritonitis virus, it has been reported that the Vaccinia virus expressed S protein acquired resistance to endoglycosidase H with a half-time of 3 h. This inefficient surface transport may be explained by saturation of the cellular retention machinery. Once the synthesis of an intracellularly retained protein has exceeded a threshold value, the cellular interaction partners become saturated and are not able to retain the excess amount of protein. This phenomenon has been reported for cellular proteins that are retained intracellularly, e.g. endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment-53 (37Hauri H.P. Kappeler F. Andersson H. Appenzeller C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 587-596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Maturation of coronaviruses occurs by a budding process at the cis-Golgi network/endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (2Tooze J. Tooze S. Warren G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 33: 281-293PubMed Google Scholar). Two of the coronavirus envelope proteins, E and M, are known to be intracellularly retained (9Machamer C.E. Mentone S.A. Rose J.K. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6944-6948Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 10Klumperman J. Locker J.K. Meijer A. Horzinek M.C. Geuze H.J. Rottier P.J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6523-6534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that the S protein of TGEV is also not transported to the cell surface. For optimal virus production, it appears reasonable that the membrane proteins are enriched at the compartment where virus budding occurs. Intracellular retention of the viral membrane proteins may also delay the time point when the infected cell is recognized by the cellular defense mechanisms such as antibodies. With some coronaviruses infected cells fuse with uninfected cells forming multinucleated cells. This syncytium formation can occur when late in infection due to overproduction, the S protein cannot be retained anymore intracellularly and is transported to the cell surface. Intracellular retention in the early stage of infection may delay this cell-damaging effect and therefore contribute to optimal virus production. The absence of viral glycoprotein from the cell surface may also avoid other defense mechanisms, e.g. complement activation. Most coronaviruses contain a tyrosine residue in the cytoplasmic tail of the S proteins that may serve as a retention signal. In fact, experimental data show that the S proteins of infectious bronchitis virus (34Lontok E. Corse E. Machamer C.E. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 5913-5922Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) 2C. Winter, C. Schwegmann-Wessels, and G. Herrler, manuscript in preparation. and bovine coronavirus (38Kunkel F. Herrler G. Arch. Virol. 1996; 141: 1123-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) are also intracellularly retained. In this respect SARS-CoV is an exception, because the S protein is transported to the cell surface. This virus appears to have a different strategy of virus host interaction. Perhaps optimal virus production is not a point of highest priority for this virus, and interaction of the surface-expressed S protein with neighboring uninfected cells provides some advantage, e.g. cell-to-cell spread of infection. Future studies will have to show the importance of this retention signal for coronavirus infection and virulence. Additionally, identification of the cellular proteins responsible for coronavirus S protein intracellular retention will allow to study the importance of host cellular proteins in coronavirus morphogenesis and infection.

Apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) (SLC10A2), only expressed in the liver on the cholangiocyte apical membrane, is rapidly regulated in response to inflammation and bile acids. Here, we studied the mechanisms controlling ASBT protein levels in cholangiocytes to determine whether ASBT expression is regulated by ubiquitination and disposal through the proteasome. Protein turnover assays demonstrated that ASBT is an unstable and short-lived protein. Treatment with MG-132, a proteasome inhibitor, causes time-dependent increased ASBT levels and increased intracellular accumulation of ASBT. In cells cotransfected with green fluorescent protein-tagged ASBT and hemagglutinin-tagged ubiquitin, we demonstrated coimmunoprecipitation and colocalization of ASBT and ubiquitin. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) induced down-regulation of ASBT is abrogated by a JNK inhibitor and is accompanied by an increase in ASBT polyubiquitin conjugates and a reduced ASBT half-life. In phosphorylation-deficient S335A and T339A mutants, the ASBT half-life is markedly prolonged, IL-1β-induced ASBT ubiquitination is significantly reduced, and IL-1β fails to increase ASBT turnover. These results indicate that ASBT undergoes ubiquitin-proteasome degradation under basal conditions and that ASBT proteasome disposal is increased by IL-1β due to JNK-regulated serine/threonine phosphorylation of ASBT protein at both Ser-335 and Thr-339.

Bile acids are the major products of cholesterol catabolism and function in the processes of bile secretion, intestinal absorption of lipids and lipid-soluble nutrients, and cholesterol elimination from the body (4Meier P.J. Stieger B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 635-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). ASBT plays a key role in the recovery of bile acids from the intestinal lumen or renal tubules to prevent loss of bile acids via stool and urine, respectively (2Shneider B.L. J. Pediatr.

ASBT may function primarily following liver injury since the recently described ASBT knockout mouse (6Dawson P.A. Haywood J. Craddock A.L. Wilson M. Tietjen M. Kluckman K. Maeda N. Parks J.S. J.

ASBT, expressed on the apical membrane of cholangiocytes, is posed to absorb bile acids from ductal bile. Absorbed bile acid molecules are returned via the peribiliary plexus to the hepatic sinusoids, again removed by hepatocytes to be secreted into bile (8Hofmann A.F. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1989; 34: 16S-20SCrossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We have proposed that the exchange of bile acids between cholangiocytes and hepatocytes (termed cholehepatic shunting) potentially prevents bile acid-induced liver injury due to extrahepatic biliary obstruction by maintaining bile acid flux and preventing intracellular bile acid accumulation in the liver (9Alpini G.

This degradation pathway is implicated in the regulation of many short-lived proteins involved in essential cellular functions, including cell cycle control, transcription regulation, signal transduction, and protein translocation (17Imai J.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2309-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The proteins degraded by this pathway are covalently modified on lysine residues by fixation of a 8-kDa polypeptide, called ubiquitin, in a three-step process (18Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K.I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 134: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the first step, ubiquitin is activated by an ubiquitin-activating enzyme. The activated ubiquitin is subsequently transferred to an ubiquitin carrier protein. Finally, ubiquitin-protein ligase catalyzes the covalent binding of ubiquitin to the target protein. Following this process, multiubiquitinated proteins are rapidly degraded by the 26 S proteasome.We speculated that the initial ASBT down-regulation due to ileal inflammation or due to IL-1β in vitro (10Chen F. Ma L. Sartor R.B. Li F. Xiong H. Sun A.Q. Shneider B. Gastroenterology. 2002; 123: 2005-2016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) is caused by enhanced ASBT disposal by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Here we present results demonstrating that ASBT is an unstable protein that is rapidly degraded. Moreover, we show that the rapid IL-1β-dependent reduction of ASBT in cholangiocytes is due to increased ASBT disposal through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. IL-1β-mediated down-regulation of ASBT expression requires phosphorylation of ASBT since mutation of two ASBT phosphorylation sites motifs reduces the rate of ASBT disposal under basal conditions and markedly reduces IL-1β-dependent ubiquitination and disposal of ASBT. These results indicate that the proteasome plays an important role in the regulation of ASBT protein level.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and Plasmids—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was purchased from Invitrogen. Fetal bovine serum was obtained from Sigma. IL-1β was purchased from R&D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN), and ubiquitin antibody, MG-132, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, N-acetyl-leu-leu-norleucinal (ALLN), lactacystin, TPCK, TLCK, aprotinin, SP600125, SB203580, and U0126 were purchased from Calbiochem. β-actin monoclonal antibodies, cycloheximide (CHX), and routine research reagents were purchased from Sigma. The green fluorescent protein (GFP) and hemagglutinin (HA) mouse monoclonal antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. ASBT antiserum was a gift from Dr. Paul Dawson. Wild-type rat ASBT cDNA was subcloned into a GFP vector, pEGFPN2 (gift from Dr. An-Qiang Sun, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY). The pME18S-FLAG-tagged ASBT was constructed as follows. pME18S-FLAG-ASBT was generated by subcloning the ASBT cDNA into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of pME18s-FLAG plasmid. ASBT construct was assembled by PCR using the following synthetic oligonucleotides as primers: 5′-ATCTGTGAATTCGATAACTCCTCCGTCTGTTCCCCAAATGC-3′ and 5′-CAGACTCTCGAGCTATTTCTCATCTGGTTGAAATCCCTTGTTTG-3′forpME18s-FLAG-ASBT. The PCR products were inserted into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of pME18S-FLAG.Site-directed Mutagenesis—ASBT-S335A, ASBT-T339A, and double mutant (ST/AA) were made using rat ASBT-GFP as template. The QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to convert codons for potential sorting determinant residues to alanine residues according to the manufacturer's directions with minor modifications as described previously (25Sun A.Q. Salkar R. Sachchidanand Xu S. Zeng L. Zhou M.M. Suchy F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4000-4009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The positive clones were verified by DNA sequencing.Cell Culture and Transfection—Mz-ChA-1 cholangiocarcinoma cell line (human gall bladder in origin) was a gift from Dr. Fitz (University of Texas Southwestern, Dallas, TX). Cells were maintained in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine). Transient DNA transfection was carried out by LipofectAMINE 2000-mediated transfection (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. Briefly, 1 × 105 cells were plated on a 6-well plate. The next day, cells were ∼70% confluent and were transfected with 2 μg of DNA. On the following day, transfected Mz-ChA-1 cells were split at 1:3 ratios in complete medium, and the transfected cell lines were selected by growth in the antibiotic G418 (1 mg/ml) (Invitrogen). 10–15 days after transfection, stable cell lines were obtained by subcloning individual colonies. Positive clones were selected by immunofluorescence microscopy, and expression was subsequently tested by Western blotting. All of the cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C under 5% CO2 atmosphere.The HEK 293 cells, a human embryonic kidney cell line, were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F12 (supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% glutamate and incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2. The HEK 293 cells were plated in 6-well culture dishes for Western blotting. 24 h after plating, HEK 293 cells were cotransfected with expression plasmids by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method. Briefly, 200 μl of 300 mm CaCl2, 200 μl of 2× Hepes-buffered saline and a total 4 μg of plasmid were mixed gently and then added to the culture medium in 6-well dishes. Transfection efficiency into HEK 293 cells with calcium phosphate coprecipitation was very high, and up to 50–80% of cells were successfully transfected. Normal rat cholangiocytes (NRC) were isolated and cultured as we described previously (26Alpini G. Phinizy J.L. Glaser S. Francis H. Benedetti A. Marucci L. LeSage G. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: G1066-G1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).Western Blot Analysis—Cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS and resuspended into the lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Following a brief sonication, cell extracts were centrifuged to remove cell debris. Protein concentration was measured by the method of Bradford with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Cell lysates (50 μg) were then separated through 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4,150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) with 5% nonfat milk. The membrane was then incubated with anti-GFP antibody (1:2000) for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20. The detection system was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Specific binding of the antibody was visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The intensity of the bands was determined by scanning video densitometry using the ChemiImager™ 5500 low light imaging system (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA).Immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed at intervals using Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 5 mm sodium fluoride. HA and GFP monoclonal antibodies were added to 500 μg of lysates and incubated at 4 °C for 3 h. Protein G plus agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added to the antigen-antibody mixture and further incubated overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed thoroughly (four times) with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and 0.1% SDS and subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-HA or anti-GFP monoclonal antibody.ASBT Turnover Assays—For half-life analysis, Mz-ChA-1 cells stably expressing ASBT-GFP were treated with CHX. Mz-ChA-1 cells expressing ASBT-GFP were plated in 10-cm dishes. Overnight cultures at near confluency (90–100%) were treated with 100 μg/ml CHX to block protein synthesis. Cells were harvested in lysis buffer at the indicated time points. Protein levels were then examined by Western blotting for GFP as described above.Immunofluorescence—ASBT-GFP and HA-ubiquitin coexpression was assessed via indirect immunofluorescence. Mz-ChA-1 cells were seeded in 5% FBS and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:Ham's F-12 on Lab-Tek Chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International). Slides were then washed with PBS, fixed in–20 °C methanol for 10 min, air-dried, and washed in 0.3% Tween/PBS for 5 min. Slides were blocked with 1% normal sheep serum in 1× antibody dilution buffer (1% bovine serum albumin in 0.3% Tween/PBS) for 1 h and incubated with 1:200 HA antibody overnight at 4 °C in a humid chamber to prevent evaporation of the antibody solution. After washing in 0.3% Tween/PBS for 10 min (3×), slides were reprobed with goat anti-mouse Alexa 594 (1:500; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 2 h at room temperature in a dark humid chamber and then washed in 0.3% Tween in PBS for subsequent washing steps. Slides were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, mounted with Gel/Mount (Biomeda, Foster City, CA) and visualized. Samples without primary antibody were used as control. Images were acquired with a Nikon TE2000-U microscope outfitted with epifluorescence and a Cascade digital camera (Roper Scientific, Inc., Tucson, AZ), and images were acquired and processed using Metamorph software version 6.0 (Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA).Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as means ± S.D. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test. We assigned significance at p < 0.05.RESULTSASBT Is a Short-lived Protein—To study the stability of ASBT protein, we determined the ASBT protein half-life in Mz-ChA-1 cells stably expressing ASBT-GFP. Whole cell extracts were isolated from cells at various times following the addition of 100 μg/ml CHX. As shown in Fig. 1A, the inhibition of protein synthesis resulted in the loss of ASBT by 12 h with over half of the protein decayed by 6 h. The mean half-life for ASBT-GFP was found to be 5.7 ± 1.2 h in three experiments. ASBT-GFP is labile as compared with the expressed GFP protein in Mz-ChA-1 cells (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, Mz-ChA-1 cells expressing ASBT-FLAG (Fig. 1C) had a similar half-life as compared with ASBT-GFP (6.3 ± 1.2 versus 5.7 ± 1.2 h, respectively). Since expressed GPF protein is stable and FLAG-tagged and GFP-tagged ASBT are similarly unstable, it is unlikely that the GFP tag alters ASBT stabilityProteasome Inhibitors Cause a Time- and Dose-dependent Accumulation of ASBT—To demonstrate the role of the proteasome in the degradation of ASBT, the effect of protease inhibitors on the steady-state levels of ASBT was assessed by immunoblot analysis of Mz-ChA-1 cells stably expressing wild-type ASBT-GFP. Although the protease inhibitors aprotinin, TLCK, TPCK, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride did not significantly affect ASBT expression, the selective proteasome inhibitors, lactacystin, ALLN, and MG-132, led to a marked increase in steady-state levels of ASBT (Fig. 2A). Treatment with MG-132 induced a time-dependent increase in ASBT (Fig. 2B). Increased ASBT was evident as early as 4 h following treatment and progressively accumulated during the 24 h following the application of MG-132. In the presence of this inhibitor for 8 h, an upsmearing of ASBT-GFP to higher molecular weight forms was observed, consistent with accumulation of ubiquitinated ASBT (27Longva K.E. Blystad F.D. Stang E. Larsen A.M. Johannessen L.E. Madshus I.H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Concentrations of MG-132 as low as 5 μm induced significant increases in ASBT within 6 h of application (Fig. 2C), with higher concentrations of MG-132 resulting in higher levels of ASBT immunoreactivity. Also, fluorescent microscopy showed that exposure to MG-132 increased the total cellular GFP fluorescence signal (Fig. 2D). A similar increase in cellular GFP fluorescence was obtained using the highly specific proteasome inhibitors lactacystin and ALLN (data not shown). From these results, it is concluded that accumulation of post-translational modified ASBT is induced only by proteasome-specific protease inhibitors.Fig. 2ASBT is targeted to the proteasome. A, cells expressing wild-type ASBT-GFP were incubated with Me2SO (DMSO), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 10 μm lactacystin, 100 μm ALLN, 10 μm MG-132, 200 μm aprotinin, 100 μm TLCK, or 100 μm TPCK. Steady-state levels of ASBT-GFP were measured after 6 h. 50 μg of extract was separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-GFP monoclonal antibody. B, proteasome inhibition causes a time-dependent increase in ASBT immunore-activity. Cells expressing wild-type ASBT-GFP were treated with 10 μm proteasome inhibitor MG-132 and analyzed by Western blot analysis for ASBT-GFP immunoreactivity 2, 4, 6, of 8 h following treatment. Upsmearing of ASBT-GFP to higher molecular weight forms is noted with 8 h of MG-132 treatment (arrow). C, proteasome inhibition causes a dose-dependent increase in ASBT immunoreactivity. Cells expressing wild-type ASBT-GFP were treated with 0–50 μm proteasome inhibitor MG-132 and analyzed by Western blot analysis for ASBT-GFP immunoreactivity 6 h following treatment. D, proteasome inhibition causes an increase in ASBT-GFP fluorescence signal in Mz-ChA-1 cells. Cells expressing Wild-type ASBT-GFP were treated with 10 μm proteasome inhibitor MG-132 and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy for ASBT-GFP fluorescence signal before (upper panel) and after 6 h (lower panel) following treatment (imaged using ×40 objective). E, proteasome inhibition causes an increase in endogenous ASBT protein. NRC cells were treated with MG-132 for 24 h and were analyzed by Western blot using a specific ASBT antiserum.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Since NRC cells express significant amounts of endogenous ASBT protein, the influence of MG-132 on endogenous ASBT level was analyzed. Western blot analysis using a specific ASBT antiserum demonstrated that treatment of NRC cells with MG-132 (Fig. 2E) resulted in a 2-fold increase of endogenous ASBT protein levels. These results indicate that both endogenously and exogenously expressed ASBT proteins are degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.ASBT Protein Is Ubiquitinated—To determine the intracellular distribution of ASBT-GFP, fluorescence microscopy was used to monitor the expression of GFP-tagged ASBT after exposure to a proteasome inhibitor (Fig. 3A). Control experiments indicate that the presence of an N-terminal GFP tag does not alter the kinetics of ASBT degradation (data not shown). In untreated cells, ASBT-GFP fluorescence was detected in the plasma membrane and intracellularly in a reticular distribution. Exposure to the proteasome inhibitor, MG-132, increased total cellular ASBT-GFP fluorescence and increased the fluorescence signal at a distinct site adjacent to the nucleus. After 16 h of exposure to the inhibitor, nearly all of the ASBT-GFP fluorescence was present in a single large, juxtanuclear structure that appears to impinge upon and to distort the contour of the nuclear envelope. These findings are consistent with previous studies that show accumulation of ubiquitinated conjugates in a vesicle as a consequence of over-whelming the proteasome (28Tsirigotis M. Zhang M. Chiu R.K. Wouters B.G. Gray D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46073-46078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In both the presence and the absence of MG-132, the green fluorescent signal was observed throughout the cytoplasm when only GFP was transfected into Mz-ChA-1 cells (data not shown).Fig. 3Ubiquitinated ASBT molecules accumulate. A, the time course of ASBT accumulation. Mz-ChA-1 cells stably expressing low levels of ASBT-GFP were incubated in the presence of 10 μm MG-132 for the times indicated. Note the redistribution of ASBT from the plasma membrane to intracellular structures after 4 h of MG-132 treatment (×60 objective). B, colocalization of ASBT-GFP with HA-tagged ubiquitin (HA-Ub). Mz-ChA-1 cells were transiently cotransfected with ASBT-GFP and HA-tagged-ubiquitin cDNA and incubated in the presence of 10 μm MG-132 for 12 h. Cells were imaged by fluorescence microscopy for GFP and immunofluorescence for HA. ASBT-GFP and HA-ubiquitin fluorescence are primarily intracellular, and the merged image of ASBT-GFP and HA-ubiquitin fluorescence signals reveals strong colocalization (×40 objective). C, ASBT-GFP and HA-tagged ubiquitin coimmunoprecipitate. GFP-tagged ASBT or HA-tagged ubiquitin was transfected, or both were cotransfected in HEK 293 cells. After 24 h, cells were treated with 10 μm MG-132 for 6 h. Immunoprecipitates were collected with antibodies against HA (left panel) or GFP (right panel) and blotted with antibodies against the HA (lower panels) or GFP (upper panels). Initial immunoblots were performed in GFP immunoprecipitates blotted for HA and HA immunoprecipitates blotted for GFP. Membranes were then stripped and then reblotted for the other antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We investigated whether or not ubiquitin was present in the GFP-tagged ASBT-containing structure that is formed in response to proteasome inhibition. Mz-ChA-1 cells were transiently transfected with GFP-tagged ASBT together with excess plasmid encoding HA-tagged ubiquitin and analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy using antibody to HA. The majority of HA-tagged ubiquitin protein colocalized with GFP-ASBT (Fig. 3B). We next determined whether GFP-tagged ASBT and HA-tagged ubiquitin coimmunoprecipitate. GFP-tagged ASBT and HA-tagged ubiquitin were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells, and immunoprecipitates were then collected with anti-GFP or anti-HA antibodies and subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies directed against the HA epitope or GFP (Fig. 3C). In cells cotransfected with GFP-tagged ASBT and HA-tagged ubiquitin, GFP-ASBT and larger molecular weight forms of GFP-ASBT (consistent with ubiquitin-conjugated ASBT and labeled ubiquitin-ASBT) were detected in HA and GFP immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3C, upper panels). In cells transfected with only GFP-ASBT, GFP-ASBT and ubiquitin-ASBT were detected in GFP but not HA immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3C, upper panels). Ubiquitin-HA was detected in HA immunoprecipitates only in cells expressing HA-tagged ubiquitin (Fig. 3C, lower left panel). Ubiquitin-HA was detected in GFP immunoprecipitates only in cells cotransfected with GFP-tagged ASBT and HA-tagged ubiquitin but not in single transfections (Fig. 3C, lower right panel). The data show that GFP-tagged ASBT and HA-tagged ubiquitin coimmunoprecipitate. Similar GFP immunoblots of GFP immunoprecipitates from cells cotransfected with GFP-tagged ASBT and HA-tagged ubiquitin as compared with cells transfected with GFP-ASBT alone (Fig. 3C, upper right panel) show that endogenous and expressed ubiquitin modifies ASBT in a similar way.IL-1β Induces JNK-dependent Ubiquitination and Disposal of ASBT—We first sought to determine whether the IL-1β down-regulation of ASBT is due to increased proteasome-mediated degradation. Treatment with 1 ng/ml IL-1β for 4 h reduced ASBT protein levels by 70% as compared with saline control (Fig. 4A, first and second lane).

https://openalex.org/W1972291600,"The light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b complex (LHCIIb) spontaneously assembles from its pigment and protein components in detergent solution. The formation of functional LHCIIb can be detected in time-resolved experiments by monitoring the establishment of excitation energy transfer from protein-bound chlorophyll b to chlorophyll a. To detect the possible initial steps of chlorophyll binding that may not yet give rise to chlorophyll b-to-a energy transfer, we have monitored LHCIIb assembly by measuring excitation energy transfer from a fluorescent dye, covalently bound to the protein, to the chlorophylls. In order to exclude interference of the dye with protein folding or pigment binding, the experiments were repeated with the dye bound to four different positions in the protein. Initial chlorophyll binding occurs at roughly the same rate as the establishment of chlorophyll b-to-a energy transfer, in the range of 10 s. However, under limiting chlorophyll concentrations, the binding of chlorophyll a clearly precedes that of chlorophyll b. The complex containing the apoprotein, carotenoids, and chlorophyll a but no chlorophyll b is biochemically unstable and therefore cannot be isolated. However, chlorophyll a binding into this weak complex is specific, as it does not occur with a C-terminal deletion mutant of Lhcb1 which still contains most chlorophyll-ligating amino acids but is unable to fold and assemble into functional LHCIIb. As a scenario for LHCIIb assembly in the thylakoid, we propose the initial formation of a labile Lhcb1-chlorophyll a-carotenoid complex that then becomes stabilized by the binding (or formation in situ) of chlorophyll b.

The structure of LHCIIb has been known in near-atomic detail since 1994 (1Kühlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar) and recently has been further resolved to 2.7 Å (2Liu Z. Yan H. Wang K. Kuang T. Zhang J. Gul L. An X. Chang W. Nature. 2004; 428: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar). Much less detail is known about some steps in the biogenesis of LHCIIb. The apoprotein, Lhcb1–3, is synthesized in its precursor form in the cytoplasm, imported into the plastid, and finally inserted into the thylakoid membrane via the signal recognition particle pathway (3Li X. Henry R. Yuan J.G. Cline K. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3789-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 4Schünemann D. Curr. Genet. 2004; 44: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It is unclear when and even where the protein becomes complexed with pigments. The signal recognition particle complex presumably keeps Lhcb1–3 in an unfolded and thus nonpigmented form until it is delivered to the thylakoid; on the other hand, Hoober and Eggink (5Hoober J.K. Eggink L.L. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 61: 197-215Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar) proposed, based on observations in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, that LHCIIb assembly takes place in the envelope membrane. We do not know how the Chls are delivered to their apoproteins, whether the last steps in their biogenetic pathway take place in the immediate neighborhood of the site of assembly or whether the pigments are transported there via some carrier (6Adamska I. Kruse E. Kloppstech K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8582-8587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 7Jansson S. Andersson J. Jung Kim S. Jackowski G. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 42: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). All we can safely assume is that Chl molecules do not freely diffuse in the thylakoid membrane because this would presumably give rise to potentially dangerous photooxidative reactions. Furthermore, we know nothing about the mechanism of LHCIIb assembly. Is it a spontaneous process or assisted by some molecular machinery? Do the pigments bind all at once, or is there a defined sequence of binding events? The assembly of LHCIIb (and other structurally related Chl a/b proteins) can be achieved in vitro. When the unfolded apoprotein Lhcb1, native or recombinant, is mixed with Chls and carotenoids in detergent solution, the protein spontaneously refolds and binds pigments to yield structurally authentic LHCIIb (8Plumley F.G. Schmidt G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 146-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Paulsen H. Rümler U. Rüdiger W. Planta. 1990; 181: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 10Hobe S. Prytulla S. Kühlbrandt W. Paulsen H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3423-3429Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). We have tried to unravel this process in time-resolved (stopped-flow) experiments, and we found that pigment binding and the completion of protein secondary structure both occur with the same kinetics and thus appear to be closely coupled events (11Horn R. Paulsen H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These processes occur in two apparent phases in the time ranges of 10 s and several min (12Booth P.J. Paulsen H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5103-5108Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 13Reinsberg D. Booth P.J. Jegerschöld C. Khoo B.J. Paulsen H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14305-14313Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The rate constants of the two apparent phases are dependent on both Chl and carotenoid concentrations, and therefore, both apparent steps presumably include the binding of Chls as well as carotenoids (14Reinsberg D. Ottmann K. Booth P.J. Paulsen H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). As a monitor for Chl binding during LHCIIb assembly, the establishment of energy transfer from Chl b to Chl a within the complex was employed. This is a useful parameter, as it reflects the appearance of functional LHCIIb if pigment-pigment energy transfer is considered an essential function of light-harvesting complexes. On the other hand, this monitor detects Chl binding only if it includes at least one Chl a and one Chl b that engage in energy transfer. If the first step is the binding of one or several molecules of either Chl a or Chl b, this would evade detection. Therefore, in the work presented here we chose a different monitor for Chl binding, a fluorescent dye attached to the protein that is capable of transferring its excitation energy to either Chl a or Chl b. This approach allowed us to kinetically study the initial steps of Chl assembly into LHCIIb. Proteins, Pigments, and Dye—Lhcb1 with single cysteines at amino acid positions 3 (N terminus, S3Ch), 106 (luminal loop, S106Ch), 160 (stromal loop, S160Ch), and 229 (C terminus, V229Ch), all containing a hexahistidyl tag either at the N terminus (S106Ch and V229Ch) or the C terminus (S3Ch and S160Ch), and mutant S3CΔC49 (ΔLhcb1 in the following) with a single cysteine at position 3 and a deletion of 49 C-terminal amino acids up to G 184 were overexpressed in Escherichia coli as described previously (9Paulsen H. Rümler U. Rüdiger W. Planta. 1990; 181: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Chls and carotenoids were isolated from pea thylakoids according to Ref. 12Booth P.J. Paulsen H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5103-5108Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar. Chlorophyllide (Chlide) a was prepared as described earlier (15Schmidt K. Fufezan C. Krieger-Liszkay A. Satoh H. Paulsen H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7427-7433Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Bodipy 507/545 IA (N-(4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-4-bora-3a, 4a-diaza-s-indacene-2-yl)iodoacetamide) was obtained from Molecular Probes Europe BV (Leiden, Netherlands). Covalent Attachment of the Fluorescent Dye to the Single Cysteines— The protein ΔLhcb1 was dissolved (1 μg/μl) in 0.5% (w/v) SDS and 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and incubated (1 h, 37 °C) with the reducing agent tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (50-fold molar excess); subsequently the dye Bodipy 507/545 IA was added (3–6-fold molar excess), and the incubation was continued for 2 h at 37 °C. For the purification of labeled ΔLhcb1, the protein was precipitated overnight by adding acetone (2.3-fold volume) and acetic acid (0.1-fold volume). To remove excess dye, the protein pellet (after centrifugation, 45 min, 21,900 × g, 4 °C) was washed with 70% ethanol and centrifuged (5 min, 45,000 × g, room temperature). The air-dried protein pellet was solubilized at a concentration of 39 μm in 1% (w/v) SDS and reconstitution buffer (100 mm lithium borate, pH 9.0, 12.5% (w/v) sucrose and 5 mm dithioerythritol). Refolding Experiments of Lhcb1 or ΔLhcb1 with Different Pigment Sets—For time-resolved fluorescence measurements, reconstitution was initiated by mixing equal volumes of dye-labeled protein and pigment solutions (as described in Ref. 12Booth P.J. Paulsen H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5103-5108Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) in a stopped-flow apparatus. For measurements over a time range of 100 or 700 s, a Rapid Mixing Device (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK) with a dead time of ≈2 s was used. The mixing was driven manually. Measurements over a time range of 50 s were performed in an SX.17MV stopped-flow fluorometer with a dead time of ≈1.4 ms (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK). The mixing was driven automatically by pressure (N2, 9 bar). The protein solution contained 0.2 or 0.15 μg/μl of (dye-labeled) Lhcb1 or ΔLhcb1 (7.8 μm), respectively, and 0.2% (w/v) SDS in reconstitution buffer. The pigment solution contained pigments as given below in reconstitution buffer with 2% (w/v) octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside and 0.08% (w/v) phosphatidyl-dl-glycerol. For refolding experiments with a complete pigment set, the pigment solution contained 0.048 μg/μl (94 μm) carotenoids corresponding to a 4-fold stoichiometric excess over protein (assuming 3 carotenoids/LHCIIb molecule). Chl concentrations varied between 0.10 and 0.39 μg/μl (113 and 434 μm), corresponding to an excess over protein of 1.2–4.6 (assuming 12 Chls/LHCIIb molecule). Incomplete pigment sets contained 0.13 μg/μl (142 μm) Chl (either Chl a, Chlide a, Chl b, or Chl a + b) and 0.048 μg/μl (94 μm) carotenoids corresponding to an excess over protein of 1.5 (assuming 12 Chls/LHCIIb) and 4 (assuming 3 xanthophylls/LHCIIb), respectively. For monitoring both the assembly and the dissociation of pigmentprotein complexes, the reconstitution was started by manually mixing equal volumes (150 μl) of protein and pigment solution in a 1.5-ml reaction vessel by using a vortex mixer. The solution was then transferred to a fluorescence cuvette with a dead time between mixing and start of fluorescence measurement of 10 s ± 1 s. After 7–10 min, a part of the solution was transferred back to a reaction vessel and manually mixed with an equal volume of detergent solution (2% octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside and 0.08% phosphatidyl-dl-glycerol in reconstitution buffer). Again the solution was transferred to a fluorescence cuvette with a dead time of 10 s ± 1 s. The initial solution contained 0.2 μg/μl (dye-labeled) Lhcb1 (7.8 μm), 0.13 μg/μl (142 μm) Chl (either Chl a or Chl a + b), and 0.048 μg/μl (94 μm) carotenoids. For monitoring the changes in secondary structure upon mixing protein and pigments, the same procedure was applied as described above, except that (i) the solution was transferred to a cuvette suitable for the use in a CD spectropolarimeter, and (ii) no subsequent dilution was performed. Protease Digestion—For probing the protease sensitivity of the pigmented Lhcb1 after reconstituting with carotenoids and either Chl a + b or Chl a alone, 1/10 volume of trypsin (1 mg/ml in water) was added to the reaction solution 10 min after the initial mixing of protein and pigment solution. After an incubation period of 30 min (24 °C), digestion was inhibited by adding 1/20 volume of 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The resulting digestion products were separated by fully denaturing SDS-PAGE (15% polyacrylamide) and visualized by Western blotting and decoration with an anti-Lhcb1 antibody (16Mick V. Eggert K. Heinemann B. Geister S. Paulsen H. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5467-5473Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Time-resolved Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence data over a time range of 100 s or 700 s were collected on a FluoroMax-2 spectrometer at 24 °C using a front-face setup. Time-resolved measurements were performed over a time range of 700 s with a data pitch of 0.5 s, integration time of 0.1 s, and over a time range of 100 s with a data pitch of 0.1 s and an integration time of 0.08 s. Slit widths were set to 0.5 and 6 nm for excitation and emission, respectively. Dye fluorescence emission upon excitation at 508 nm was measured at 543 nm. Chl fluorescence emission upon excitation at 470 nm (mostly Chl b excitation) was measured at 660 (Chl b emission) and 680 nm (sensitized Chl a emission). Steady-state spectra upon excitation at 508 nm were recorded from 515 to 750 nm with increments of 0.5 nm and integration times of 0.2 s. Slit widths were set to 1 and 5 nm for excitation and emission, respectively. Fluorescence data over a time range of 50 s were collected on an SX.17MV stopped-flow fluorometer (dead time ≈1.4 ms) at 24 °C. The path length for excitation was 2 mm; emission was measured at an angle of 90° with a path length of 10 mm. For measuring dye fluorescence, the excitation was at 508 nm (monochromator with bandwidth 0.8 nm), and emission was at 546 nm (bandpass filter with 8 nm at full width, half-maximum). A thousand data points were collected (0–0.5 s, data pitch of 0.001 s; 0.5–50.5 s, data pitch of 0.1 s). The kinetic traces were fitted to a sum of two exponentials by using the software Table Curve (version 2D 4.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago). Time constants are the reciprocals of the calculated rate constants. The presented data reflect the average of at least three independent measurements. Time-resolved CD measurements were performed as described previously (11Horn R. Paulsen H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Pigment Binding Can Be Monitored by the Signal Change of a Fluorescent Dye Monitor—Monomeric light-harvesting complex of photosystem II (LHCIIb) can be refolded in vitro by simply mixing the apoprotein Lhcb1 with Chls and carotenoids in the presence of detergents. Complex formation consists of folding of the protein into an α-helical secondary structure and binding of at least 12 Chl and 3 carotenoid molecules to the protein. In our previous time-resolved measurements of LHCIIb formation, we used the intra-complex energy transfer from Chl b to Chl a as a monitor for complex formation. Upon excitation of Chl b at 470 nm, more and more of the excitation energy is transferred to Chl a as the complex forms, visible as a gradual decrease in Chl b emission (660 nm) and a concomitant increase in Chl a emission (680 nm). In the present work, we also monitored LHCIIb formation by energy transfer measurements, but we introduced an artificial energy donor into the system by site-specifically labeling the protein at singular cysteine positions with the fluorescent dye Bodipy 507/545 IA. This dye, with excitation and emission wavelengths at 508 and 543 nm, respectively, efficiently transfers its excitation energy to a Chl (Fig. 1). After reconstituting the dye-labeled Lhcb1 with pigments and illuminating it at 508 nm, the dye emission at 543 nm is virtually completely quenched. At the same time, sensitized Chl a fluorescence appears at 680 nm. In a control measurement (Fig. 1, dashed line), with the dye and chlorophylls at the same concentration as in the labeled LHCIIb solution but not organized in a complex, Chl a emission (due to co-excitation at 543 nm) is much lower. In this control, the emission of unbound Bodipy 507/545 IA is also lower than that of the labeled protein (Fig. 1, gray line), presumably because of an increased fluorescence quantum yield of the protein-bound dye and to an inner filter effect of the chlorophylls present. In Bodipy-labeled LHCIIb, only Chl a emits although the dye can transfer its excitation energy to both Chl b and Chl a (critical Förster distances R0 calculated as 47 and 57 Å, respectively, for a situation with one donor and one acceptor molecule). This is because of rapid energy transfer from Chl b to Chl a within the complex. The quenching of dye fluorescence in Bodipy 507/545 IA-labeled Lhcb1 during its reconstitution with pigments can be used as a monitor for pigment protein-complex formation (Fig. 2). The strong decrease in Bodipy 507/545 IA emission (Fig. 2a, dotted trace) is dependent on pigment-protein interaction, as no signal change is observed when only unbound dye and pigments are mixed (Fig. 2a, gray trace), and only a much smaller decrease is seen when the protein-bound dye is diluted into a detergent/lipid solution without pigments (Fig. 2a, continuous black trace), possibly due to partial aggregation of the nonpigmented protein. The total amplitude of the decrease measured over a time range of 700 s is about 47% of the initial signal, which is less than what would be expected from the steady-state measurement. This is because part of the signal change is lost during the experimental dead time of ≈2 s. Measurements over a time range of 50 s with an Applied Photophysics SX.17MV stopped-flow fluorometer with a dead time of about 1.4 ms revealed an additional apparent step in the decrease of dye fluorescence in the 10-ms range (Fig. 2a, inset, black dots). This decrease also is dependent on the presence of protein and pigments, as it is not seen in the absence of pigments (Fig. 2a, inset, black line) or in the absence of protein, i.e. when dye and pigments are mixed (gray line). For comparison, the same experiment over the time range of 700 s was performed with excitation of Chl b, monitoring the energy transfer from Chl b to Chl a appearing during complex formation (Fig. 2b). Both the decrease of Chl b emission and the increase of sensitized Chl a emission occur in the same time range as the quenching of Bodipy 507/545 IA fluorescence. All signal changes can be described by two apparent steps with time constants of about 25 and 200 s (see below). Labeling a protein with a fluorescent dye introduces the risk that the covalently attached label might influence the structure of the protein and thus its folding behavior. Therefore, we attached the label to four different sites in Lhcb1, the N and C termini and the luminal and stromal loop domains, and we compared the kinetics of LHCIIb formation. Fig. 3 shows that the behavior of all labeled proteins as monitored by the dye fluorescence quenching was very similar. The biexponential fit of the four traces revealed the apparent time constants τ1 between 15 and 22 s and τ2 of about 4 min irrespective of the site of dye attachment. The only protein derivative showing slightly different kinetics is the one labeled in the stromal loop domain. Its first step is somewhat slower (22 s) than those of the other labeled proteins (15 s) and comprises more than half of the total amplitude, whereas with the other proteins the second step is the predominant one (Table I). Moreover, the total signal change is somewhat larger when the dye is attached to the stromal loop in comparison to the other attachment sites. However, apart from these relatively small differences, the kinetic behavior of the differently labeled proteins during LHCIIb reconstitution is the same. We conclude that the dye does not significantly interfere with protein folding or pigment binding.Table IKinetic data of LHCIIb folding and assembly from time-resolved fluorescence measurements of the monitor dye attached to four different sites of Lhcb1Site labeledτ1τ2A1/A2sN terminus15 ± 1243 ± 240.8 ± 0.1C terminus15 ± 2272 ± 230.6 ± 0.2Stromal loop22 ± 3229 ± 141.2 ± 0.2Luminal loop16 ± 5275 ± 320.6 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab To test whether the decrease in the monitor dye fluorescence correlates with the formation of a functional LHCIIb, we labeled an apoprotein (ΔLhcb1) lacking most of its C-proximal trans-membrane helix and known to be unable to form a stable pigment-protein complex (17Paulsen H. Hobe S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As expected, no energy transfer from Chl b to Chl a was observed during reconstitution attempts with this protein (not shown). However, if this protein binds either Chl a or Chl b or if it binds both such that they do not transfer energy, this binding would have escaped a monitor focusing on Chl b-Chl a energy transfer but would still be detected by a monitor dye able to transfer its energy to any Chl. As shown in Fig. 4, the deletion mutant of Lhcb1 shows no signal change of the dye monitor exceeding the small one seen in the complete absence of pigments. Hence, a functional apoprotein is required for seeing pigment binding even with a monitor that is expected to pick up a single Chl molecule closely interacting with the protein. Moreover, this observation clearly demonstrates that the quenching of Bodipy 507/545 IA fluorescence is not due to unspecific binding of Chls to the protein, as the truncated protein still contains two of its three hydrophobic α-helical membranes and most of the amino acids serving as ligands in native LHCIIb. We cannot exclude unspecific binding for the very fast quenching of the dye fluorescence with the time constant of 10 ms because no kinetic measurements over the time range of 50 s with a dead time of 1.4 ms were performed with the mutant. Fluorescent Dye Detects Early Pigment Binding Steps during LHCIIb Assembly in Vitro—In the experiment described in Fig. 2, virtually the same kinetics of LHCIIb assembly was seen with energy transfer either from the fluorescent dye to Chls or from Chl b to Chl a. This was no longer the case when we lowered the Chl concentration in the reconstitution mixture. When the stoichiometric excess of Chls over protein dropped below 2 (protein and carotenoid concentrations were held constant), both apparent reaction phases slowed down when monitored by Chl-Chl energy transfer (Fig. 5a), in accordance with our earlier observations (14Reinsberg D. Ottmann K. Booth P.J. Paulsen H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). On the other hand, when LHCIIb assembly was monitored by the fluorescent dye positioned in the stromal loop of the protein, both time constants τ1 and τ2 did not rise but even decreased to some extent as the Chl stoichiometry dropped from 1.6- to 1.2-fold. This decrease was not significant in the case of the fluorescent dye monitor bound to the N or C termini or the luminal loop (Fig. 5b), but clearly, the fluorescent dye monitor did not indicate slower pigment binding at low Chl concentrations, as opposed to the Chl b monitor. Fluorescent Dye Monitor Detects Binding of Chl a in the Absence of Chl b—Upon reconstituting LHCIIb at a low stoichiometric excess of Chls, the energy transfer from the fluorescent dye to Chls is established significantly faster than the energy transfer from Chl b to Chl a. This indicates that during the initial phase of pigment binding the fluorescent dye detects the binding of Chls that do not yet take part in Chl-Chl energy transfer, presumably because only Chl a or only Chl b is bound. Therefore, we performed kinetic experiments in which either Chl was omitted from the pigment solution. As clearly shown in Fig. 6, Chl a in the absence of Chl b (Fig. 6, AC, black filled dots) binds faster to the protein than does Chl b in the absence of Chl a (BC, dark gray crosses). Exponential fits of these traces in comparison to that obtained with the full pigment complement (Fig. 6, ABC, dark gray trace) revealed that both reactions can still be described by two apparent phases, but the time constants and/or their amplitudes change (Table II). With Chl a as the only Chl, τ1 is the same as with both Chls, whereas τ2 doubles. However, in the AC trace the faster phase covers more than 2/3 of the total amplitude, whereas the slower phase predominates when both Chls are present, which makes the overall reaction even faster when Chl a is the only Chl, at least for the first 100 s. On the other hand, Chl b in the absence of Chl a binds at a reduced overall rate as compared with Chl a alone or the full pigment complement. This is mostly due to τ1 being doubled. The time constant of the slower phase, τ2, could only be determined with a relatively large uncertainty for this trace; it appears to be somewhere between that measured with Chl a only and that with both Chls. The same is true for the amplitude ratio A1/A2 (where A1 and A2 indicate amplitudes associated with the time constants τ1 and τ2).Table IIKinetic data from time-resolved fluorescence measurements of Lhcb1-attached dye (stromal loop) after mixing with different (incomplete) pigment setsPigment setτ1τ2A1/A2Atotals%ABC24 ± 3182 ± 120.8 ± 0.1100 ± 3AC24 ± 3372 ± 572.3 ± 0.595 ± 11BC49 ± 15280 ± 1231.8 ± 1.172 ± 10AB16 ± 1Second amplitude is negative Open table in a new tab When both Chls were present in the pigment solution but the carotenoids were omitted (Fig. 6, AB, light gray trace), the fluorescent dye exhibited a fast drop in its emission intensity and then a rise toward the signal level seen in the complete absence of pigments. This indicates transient Chl binding of Chls to the protein, confirming that carotenoids are structural components of the complex that are required for stable Chl binding. After mixing the Lhcb1 with carotenoids and Chlide a, no signal change could be observed at all (not shown), indicating that the Chl a precursor Chlide a is not able to interact specifically with the protein. When the mixture containing labeled Lhcb1, Chl a, and carotenoids was diluted 2-fold with detergent solution, a rise in the dye-fluorescence was observed (Fig. 7), indicating partial dissociation of the pigment-protein complex. No such fluorescence increase was monitored when diluting the solution containing fully assembled LHCIIb after mixing the protein with the complete pigment set, i.e. Chl a, carotenoids, and Chl b (Fig. 7, inset). Concomitantly with the binding of Chl a and carotenoid to the Lhcb1 in the absence of Chl b, an increase in α-helical secondary structure was also observed by following the change of the CD signal at 222 nm (not shown). A monoexponential fit of the signal change revealed a time constant of 26 s. The amplitude of the signal change comprised about 2/3 of the change observed for the formation of functional LHCIIb (after mixing the Lhcb1 with carotenoids and Chl a + b). In this case two time constants of 21 and 165 s were resolved. No increase in α-helical structure was observed by CD when Lhcb1 and carotenoids but no chlorophylls were mixed under refolding conditions (not shown). In contrast to LHCIIb, which apart from the 50 N-terminal amino acids is resistant against protease digestion (18Schmidt G.W. Bartlett S.G. Grossman A.R. Cashmore A.R. Chua N.H. J.

B lymphocyte development, selection, and activation are critically dependent on the surface expression of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) 1The abbreviations used are: BCR, B cell antigen receptor; PLC-γ2, phospholipase C-γ2; Ub, ubiquitin; BLNK, B cell linker protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide.1The abbreviations used are: BCR, B cell antigen receptor; PLC-γ2, phospholipase C-γ2; Ub, ubiquitin; BLNK, B cell linker protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide. and the BCR-mediated signal transduction (1Craxton A. Otipoby K.L. Jiang A. Clark E.A. Adv. Immunol. 1999; 73: 79-152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The BCR is composed of membrane-bound immunoglobulin and an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif-containing α/β heterodimer (2Reth M. Wienands J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 453-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Upon the engagement of the BCR, tyrosine residues within immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs are phosphorylated by Src family protein-tyrosine kinases, Lyn, Fyn, or Blk followed by the recruitment and activation of various protein-tyrosine kinases such as Syk or Btk. These tyrosine kinases activate additional signaling molecules including phospholipase C (PLC)-γ2 and Vav and ultimately lead to the activation of transcription factors such as NFAT, AP-1, and NFκB, which can achieve a multitude of cellular responses, such as proliferation, activation, differentiation, or cell death (3Gauld S.B. Dal Porto J.M. Cambier J.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1641-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Adaptor proteins also play an essential role in regulating the interactions and recruitments of effector enzymes with the BCR and protein-tyrosine kinases (4Kurosaki T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 354-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Among this group of adaptor proteins, there are increasing evidences for the role of Cbl and another member of its family, Cbl-b, in the BCR signaling pathway (5Rao N. Dodge I. Band H. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 71: 753-763PubMed Google Scholar, 6Sohn H.W. Gu H. Pierce S.K. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1511-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The Cbl family proteins are composed of an N-terminal tyrosine kinase binding domain, followed by a RING finger domain, and C-terminal multiple proline-rich regions (7Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 294-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Cbl and Cbl-b function as adaptor proteins by interacting with protein-tyrosine kinases and other crucial signaling molecules and function as E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligases, in which the RING finger recruits Ub-bound E2 enabling the transfer of Ub to the substrate, resulting in its ubiquitination and subsequent down-modulation (7Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 294-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Earlier studies identified Cbl as one of the rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated substrates upon the BCR engagement (5Rao N. Dodge I. Band H. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 71: 753-763PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of Cbl leads to an inhibition of Syk kinase activity (8Ota Y. Samelson L.E. Science. 1997; 276: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) but has no effect on the Lyn function (9Tezuka T. Umemori H. Fusaki N. Yagi T. Takata M. Kurosaki T. Yamamoto T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A later study showed that Cbl acts as an E3 Ub ligase to promote Syk ubiquitination (10Rao N. Ghosh A.K. Ota S. Zhou P. Reddi A.L. Hakezi K. Druker B.K. Wu J. Band H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7085-7095Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Experiments with Cbl-deficient chicken DT40 cells demonstrated that Cbl inhibits the BCR-mediated PLC-γ2 activation by regulating PLC-γ2 recruitment to B cell linker protein (BLNK) and Vav (11Yasuda T. Maeda A. Kurosaki M. Tezuka T. Hironaka K. Yamamoto T. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, a physiological function of Cbl in primary murine B cells remains unclear. To understand the role of Cbl in B cells, we examined B cells from Cbl-deficient mice and investigated the mechanism by which Cbl regulates BCR signaling. It was found that a loss of Cbl resulted in reduced B cell proliferation and diminished phosphorylation of BCR proximal signaling molecules. However, the tyrosine phosphorylation of CD19 and CD19-mediated downstream signaling were increased. We provided evidence that Cbl differentially regulates the BCR signaling via targeting the ubiquitination of Lyn. Mice—Cbl–/– mice (12Naramura M. Kole H.K. Hu R.-J. Gu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15547-15552Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) were provided by M. Naramura and H. Gu. Cbl–/– mice on a mixed 129 and C57BL/6 background were further back-crossed with C57BL/6 mice for six more generations to obtain Cbl+/+, Cbl+/–, and Cbl–/– B6 mice. The genotyping of the mutant mice was done by PCR using tail DNA. Mice between 6 and 8 weeks after birth were mostly used for the experiments. All the animal experiments were performed according to the institutional guidelines. B Cell Proliferation—B cells from splenocytes were negatively selected with a B cells isolation kit following the manufacture's instructions (Miltenyl Biotec, Auburn, CA). Purified B cells (5 × 105 cells/ml) were stimulated with increasing amount of LPS or anti-IgM F(ab′)2 (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) or in the presence of recombinant mouse IL-4 (100 units/ml; Calbiochem, San Deigo, CA) either alone or with anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences). Proliferation was measured by pulsing the cells with 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine for the final 16 h of the 2-day culture and then by counting the radioactivity uptake. Calcium Influx Measurement—Splenic B cells were resuspended at 1 × 107/ml in Hanks' buffer (Invitrogen) containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum album and loaded with 1 μm Indo-1-AM (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 °C for 45 min. The cells were washed twice at room temperature and resuspended at 2 × 106/ml. Continuous monitoring of the fluorescence ratio (525/405 nm) was performed using BD-LSR (BD Biosciences). Base-line fluorescence ratios were collected for 1 min before anti-IgM F(ab′)2 was added. The fluorescence ratios were collected at real time for 5 min following addition of antibodies. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Spleen B cells (1 × 107) were stimulated with 10 μg/ml goat anti-mouse IgM F(ab′)2 fragment for the indicated time intervals. Lysates were prepared in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm orthovanadate, and 10 μg/ml of both aprotinin and leupeptin at 4 °C for 30 min. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. For immunoprecipitation, cleared lysates were incubated with indicated antibodies and protein G-Sepharose at 4 °C, washed three times in lysis buffer, and boiled with Laemmli buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 10% gels followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The membranes were probed with antibodies and developed using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). The following antibodies used for immunoprecipitation or immunoblotting: polyclonal antibodies specific to Lyn (44), Syk (N-19), Btk (M138), BLNK (H80), p85, ERK1/2, and PLC-γ2 (Q-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); CD19, Akt, Bcl-xL, and phospho-Akt, JNK, phospho-ERK, and phospho-JNK from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA); and anti-Bcl-2 and monoclonal anti-Lyn antibody from BD Transduction Laboratory (Lexington, KY). In Vitro Kinase Assay—Lysates were prepared from splenic B cells in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. The anti-Lyn precipitates were washed four times with the radioimmune precipitation assay buffer followed by washing two times with 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm magnesium acetate, and 20 mm MnCl2 (kinase assay buffer). The Lyn kinase activity was measured by the in vitro kinase assay system according to the manufacture's instructions (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). Briefly, the immunoprecipitates were incubated in kinase assay buffer including biotin-conjugated Src kinasespecific peptide substrates for 30 min at 30 °C and then subjected to 96-well enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based colorimetric assay. All in vitro kinase activity experiments were repeated at least three times, and representative results are shown. Plasmids and Cell Transfection—Plasmids containing wild-type Cbl or Cbl RING finger Cys to Ala mutant (Cbl-CA), Myc-Ub have been described previously (13Wang H.Y. Altman Y. Fang D. Elly C. Dai Y. Shao Y. Liu Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26004-26011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The pME plasmids containing Lyn or Lyn kinase-dead mutant (Lyn KR) cDNA were kindly provided by Dr. T. Kawakami and the cDNAs were subcloned into pCMV-FLAG mammalian expression vector (Sigma). Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 units/ml of streptomycin. Cells were transfected with appropriate plasmids (usually 5–10 μg in total) using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). After 48 h, cells were collected and resuspended in 0.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were either untreated or treated with pervanadate for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then pelleted and resuspended in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. For the detection of ubiquitinated proteins, 0.1% SDS and 5 mmN-ethylmaleimide (Sigma-Aldrich) were added to the lysis buffer to disrupt nonspecific protein interactions (14Shao Y. Elly C. Liu Y.C. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For the transfection of DT40 cells (ATCC number CRL-2111), cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 units/ml of streptomycin. Cells were transfected with plasmids (usually 15–20 μg each, and 45–50 μg in total) by electroporation (260 V, 975 microfarad, Bio-Rad). Flow Cytometry—Single-cell suspension from various tissues was stained with conjugated monoclonal antibodies for 45 min at 4 °C. Cell-associated fluorescence was analyzed using a FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences) and the equipped FlowJo software. Analysis of surface marker expression on lymphocytes was done using monoclonal antibodies against CD3ϵ (2C11), B220 (RA3-6B2), IgD (1.3-5), IgM (R33-24.12), CD5 (53-7.3), CD19 (1D3), CD21 (B-Ly4), CD23 (B2B4), or CD43 (24.12) purchased from BD Biosciences. Pulse-chase Experiment—Purified B cells (1 × 107) from Cbl+/+ or Cbl–/– mice were cultured in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were stimulated with 10 μg/ml anti-IgM F(ab′)2 and then labeled for 1 h with 100 μCi/ml Trans[35S] (ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA). Cells were then washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline and cultured for different time intervals in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. At each time point, the cells were collected and lysed by Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. The cell lysates were precleared with protein G-Sepharose for 30 min and then immunoprecipitated with anti-Lyn. The immune complexes were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and were subjected to autoradiography. The radiolabeled protein bands were quantified by using NIH Image 1.61 software. Reduced Proliferation of Cbl–/–B Cells—To examine the effects of the Cbl deficiency on the biological responses of B cells, we assessed the proliferation of purified splenic B cells following anti-IgM, anti-CD40, anti-CD40 plus IL-4, or LPS stimulation. As shown in Fig. 1A, the proliferative response of Cbl–/– B cells to anti-IgM stimulation was severely impaired. However, no defect in proliferation was observed after stimulation with LPS in Cbl–/– B cells compared with wide-type B cells (Fig. 1B). The B cell proliferation was reduced after stimulation with anti-CD40 or anti-CD40 plus IL-4 (Fig. 1, C and D). The data suggested that the proliferative responses induced by the engagement of the BCR, CD40, and IL-4, but not LPS, are affected by Cbl deficiency. Impaired BCR Signaling in Cbl–/–B Cells—Although several biochemical studies have previously provided evidence about Cbl in BCR signaling (5Rao N. Dodge I. Band H. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 71: 753-763PubMed Google Scholar), it is still unclear whether Cbl regulates BCR signaling in murine primary B cells in a similar manner as in cultured cell lines. To study Cbl-mediated downstream signaling events following the BCR engagement, we assessed the BCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation patterns of cellular proteins in purified wild-type and Cbl–/– splenic B cells. In the absence of Cbl, the overall tyrosine phosphorylation in the whole cell lysates was reduced as compared with wild-type B cells during a period of 60-min stimulation (Fig. 2A). We then examined the activation of downstream mitogen-activated protein kinases, Erk and JNK in those cells by using phospho-specific antibodies. The Erk phosphorylation in Cbl–/– B cells was obviously reduced after a 5-min stimulation and remained lower than in wild-type B cells even after a 60-min stimulation (Fig. 2B). However, the amount of phosphorylated JNK in Cbl–/– B cells was comparable with wild-type B cells under the same stimulation conditions (Fig. 2B). We next examined the BCR-triggered Ca2+ influx and found that Cbl–/– B cells showed slightly reduced Ca2+ mobilization in comparison with wild-type B cells (Fig. 2C). Reduced Phosphorylation of Proximal Signaling Molecules in Cbl–/–B Cells—To further understand the molecular mechanisms that account for the BCR signaling defects in Cbl–/– B cells, we compared the BCR-mediated tyrosine-phosphorylation status of Syk, Btk, and PLC-γ2, the critical proximal signaling molecules for the initial of BCR signaling. It was observed that the phosphorylation of Syk and Btk was decreased in Cbl–/– B cells (Fig. 3, A and B). It has been shown previously that a Cbl deficiency in the DT40 cell line can affect the association of PLC-γ2 with BLNK and also PLC-γ2 phosphorylation (11Yasuda T. Maeda A. Kurosaki M. Tezuka T. Hironaka K. Yamamoto T. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, there seemed to be no significant difference in the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ2 and the association of PLC-γ2 with BLNK between wild-type and Cbl–/– B cells (Fig. 3C). Thus our data from Cbl–/– mice suggested that Cbl may not directly play a negative role in the BCR-mediated phosphorylation of Syk or PLC-γ2 as previously proposed (8Ota Y. Samelson L.E. Science. 1997; 276: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 11Yasuda T. Maeda A. Kurosaki M. Tezuka T. Hironaka K. Yamamoto T. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of CD19 Signaling Pathway—We next examined the potential contribution of Cbl in BCR-induced CD19 signaling pathway. Surprisingly, we found that CD19 phosphorylation was enhanced in Cbl–/– B cells upon BCR engagement (Fig. 4A). Because it has been reported that engagement of CD19 leads to the activation of Akt (15Otero D.C. Omori S.A. Rickert R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1474-1478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we next examined the Akt phosphorylation by blotting the cell lysates with phospho-specific anti-Akt antibody. It was found that Akt phosphorylation was augmented in Cbl–/– B cells compared with wild-type B cells upon BCR stimulation (Fig. 4A). The increased CD19 phosphorylation was not because of the change of cell surface expression of CD19, which was equivalent between wild-type and Cbl–/– B cells (Fig. 4B). BCR stimulation did not further alter the expression levels of CD19 in those cells (data not shown). We also examined other CD19 downstream effector molecules such as the Bcl family proteins (16Roberts T. Snow E.C. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4377-4380PubMed Google Scholar). We detected increased levels of Bcl-xL and, to a lesser extent, Bcl-2 in Cbl–/– B cells after anti-IgM stimulation for 6–48 h (Fig. 4C). It was shown previously that engagement of BCR, but not CD19 itself, induces an association between CD19 and the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase (17Inabe K. Kurosaki T. Blood. 2002; 99: 584-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The increased Akt phosphorylation in Cbl–/– B cells, a downstream target of PI3-kinase, could result from an altered association between CD19 and the p85. To test this hypothesis, we immunoprecipitated CD19 and examined the associated p85 in anti-IgM stimulated wild-type and Cbl–/– B cells. Consistent with a previous observation (17Inabe K. Kurosaki T. Blood. 2002; 99: 584-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), anti-IgM stimulation caused a rapid association between CD19 and p85 and gradual dissociation 5 min after stimulation (Fig. 4D). The association of CD19 with p85 was markedly increased in Cbl–/– B cells under the same stimulation conditions. Because Lyn also forms a complex with CD19 (18Fujimoto M. Fujimoto Y. Poe J.C. Jansen P.J. Lowell C.A. DeFranco A.L. Tedder T.F. Immunity. 2000; 13: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), we blotted the same membrane with anti-Lyn antibody and found that more Lyn protein was coimmunoprecipitated by anti-CD19 antibody in Cbl–/– B cells (Fig. 4D). Thus, in contrast to the positive role of Cbl in BCR-induced phosphorylation of Syk or Btk as described earlier, the results described here suggest that Cbl is a negative regulator of BCR-mediated CD19 signaling pathways. Cbl Regulates Lyn Activation through Ubiquitination—Genetic and biochemical studies have shown that the tyrosine kinase Lyn plays both a negative and a positive role in BCR signaling (19DeFranco A.L. Chan V.W. Lowell C.A. Semin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The reduced proximal BCR signaling, the upregulation of CD19 phosphorylation, and its association with Lyn in Cbl–/– B cells led us to speculate that Cbl may negatively regulate Lyn, which differentially affects the downstream signaling. To test such model, we examined the in vitro kinase activity of immunoprecipitated Lyn from wild-type and Cbl–/– B cells. Although the kinase activity was quite similar between wild-type and Cbl–/– B cells 2 min after BCR stimulation, higher kinase activity was observed after a 5-min stimulation (Fig. 5A). Cbl–/– B cells still showed higher kinase activity after a 15-min stimulation, whereas at the same time point the kinase activity in wild-type B cells decreased dramatically. Thus, the loss of Cbl caused a slower but stronger Lyn activation upon BCR engagement. We next investigated whether Lyn is a target for Cbl E3 ligase activity and performed an in vivo ubiquitination assay in transiently transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells by overexpressing wild-type Lyn, or kinase-dead Lyn, together with Myc-tagged Ub and Cbl. The overexpression of Cbl promoted Ub conjugation to wild-type Lyn (Fig. 5B). However, the kinase-dead Lyn KR mutant was not ubiquitinated by Cbl. Stimulation of the transfected cells with pervanadate, a phosphatase inhibitor, induced a stronger ubiquitination of wild-type Lyn. In addition, the ubiquitination of Lyn by Cbl requires an intact RING finger, because a mutation at a critical cysteine residue in the RING finger (Cbl CA) disrupted the Ub conjugation to Lyn (Fig. 5C). Interestingly, we observed that the immunoprecipitated Lyn from samples transfected with the Cbl CA mutant showed higher levels of tyrosine phosphorylation than from cells transfected with wild-type Cbl (Fig. 5C, bottom panel), suggesting that Lyn ubiquitination is inversely related to its phosphorylation. We further examined Cbl-promoted Lyn ubiquitination in a chicken DT40 B cell line and found that only wild-type Lyn, but not the Lyn KR mutant, was ubiquitinated by the expression of Cbl (Fig. 5D). To further confirm the physiological relevance of Cbl-mediated Lyn ubiquitination, we examined the protein levels of Lyn in wild-type and Cbl–/– B cells following anti-IgM stimulation for different time periods. It was found that the protein amounts of Lyn in wild-type B cells decreased rapidly after BCR stimulation, becoming obvious 10 min after stimulation (Fig. 5E). However, the rate of reduction in Cbl–/– B cells was attenuated, and the Lyn protein was still detectable 3 h after BCR stimulation. We further performed a pulse-chase experiment to examine the protein stability of Lyn in wild-type and Cbl–/– B cells. Lyn in Cbl–/– B cells was more stable than in wild-type B cells (Fig. 5F). Thus, Lyn is a physiological target for Cbl-induced ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Altered B Cell Development in Cbl–/–Mice—To understand a functional implication of Cbl in the differential regulation of BCR signaling, we investigated the B cell development in wild-type and Cbl–/– mice, the B cell subpopulations in the spleen and peritoneal cavity were analyzed in wild-type and Cbl–/– littermates by flow cytometry. The analysis of splenocytes showed a normal ratio of B220+ B cells versus CD3ϵ+ T cells in Cbl–/– mice, and the total cell numbers were comparable between wild-type and Cbl–/– mice (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 6A, double staining with anti-IgM and IgD of splenocytes showed an apparent increase in the population of IgMhiIgDlow immature B cells, but a substantial decrease in the mature IgMlowIgDhi B cells. We further examined the cell surface expression of CD21 and CD23 and found a marked reduction of CD21intCD23hi (mostly follicular B cells) in Cbl–/– mice (Fig. 6B). But the CD21hiCD23lo (enriched in the marginal zone) and CD21lowCD23low (mostly newly formed B cells) populations were increased in Cbl–/– mice compared with wild-type mice. We next examined the population of B1 B cells in the peritoneal cavities. B1 B cells share many phenotypic and functional properties with marginal zone B cells and are characterized by the cell surface expression of CD5 and IgM (20Hardy R.R. Hayakawa K. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 595-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). We found that the population of IgM+CD5+ B1 B cells was markedly increased in Cbl–/– mice (Fig. 6C). These data collectively suggest that a Cbl deficiency blocks the development of follicular B cells but promotes the development of the marginal zone and B1 B cells. Although the Cbl–/– mice have been available for awhile, a vigorous investigation on Cbl in B cell development and activation has been lacking. Based on previous studies, it could have been predicated that a Cbl deficiency in B cells results in an up-regulation of BCR signaling. However, our data suggested that Cbl plays differential roles in the signal transduction pathways initiated by the engagement of the BCR. The reduced proximal BCR signaling and increased CD19 signaling in Cbl–/– B cells prompted us to speculate that Cbl regulates a further upstream molecule or molecules that act as switches between CD19 and BCR signaling pathways. The present study leads us to conclude that Lyn is such a candidate as the physiological target for Cbl in B cells, which is supported by the increased Lyn kinase activity in Cbl–/– B cells, Cbl-mediated ubiquitination of Lyn in transfected cells, and augmented Lyn stability upon BCR stimulation. An early study showed that Lyn associates with Cbl and induces its phosphorylation in B cells (9Tezuka T. Umemori H. Fusaki N. Yagi T. Takata M. Kurosaki T. Yamamoto T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Another recent study showed that Lyn is ubiquitinated by Cbl and/or Cbl-b in mast cells upon stimulation of the high affinity IgE receptor (21Kyo S. Sada K. Qu X. Maeno K. Miah S.M. Kawauchi-Kamata K. Yamamura H. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 825-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It was previously reported that Lyn–/– B cells are hyperproliferative and show enhanced Erk activation (22Chan V.W. Meng F. Soriano P. DeFranco A.L. Lowell C.A. Immunity. 1997; 7: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 23Wang J. Koizumi T. Watanabe T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In the present study, we observed that Cbl deficiency results in increased Lyn kinase activation and reduced Erk activation, which is the opposite of Lyn–/– B cells. Thus, our data showing reduced proliferation in Cbl–/– B cells are consistent with the hypothesis that Cbl regulates B cell proliferation via modulating Lyn activity. The finding that Lyn is a target of Cbl in B cells is further supported by another interesting observation of the increased CD19 phosphorylation in Cbl–/– B cells upon BCR stimulation. It was previously shown that Lyn plays a positive role in phosphorylating CD19 tyrosine residues and the phosphorylated CD19 in turn positively regulates Lyn activation (18Fujimoto M. Fujimoto Y. Poe J.C. Jansen P.J. Lowell C.A. DeFranco A.L. Tedder T.F. Immunity. 2000; 13: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). To be consistent with this observation, we indeed observed an increased complex formation between CD19 and Lyn in anti-IgM-stimulated B cells from Cbl–/– mice. However, opposite observations have also been reported that Lyn and CD19 independently transduce downstream signaling (24Xu Y. Beavitt S.J. Harder K.W. Hibbs M.L. Tarlinton D.M. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6910-6918Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It is possible that in addition to Lyn, other Src kinases may compensate for the function of Lyn for the CD19 phosphorylation. The observation of increased CD19 signaling in Cbl–/– B cells is further supported by the augmented association of CD19 with p85 of PI3-kinase, which then induces the Akt phosphorylation and probably the expression of Bcl proteins. Although previous biochemical studies have clearly established a negative role of Cbl in regulating Syk either through inhibiting its kinase activity (8Ota Y. Samelson L.E. Science. 1997; 276: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) or inducing Syk ubiquitination (10Rao N. Ghosh A.K. Ota S. Zhou P. Reddi A.L. Hakezi K. Druker B.K. Wu J. Band H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7085-7095Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), it is surprising to find that Syk activation is not upregulated, but rather down-modulated in Cbl–/– B cells. The results shown here may imply that Syk is not a primary target for Cbl under physiological conditions. The reduced Syk activation in Cbl–/– B cells correlated with the attenuated B cell proliferation and decreased Erk phosphorylation. A possible explanation for the reduced Syk activation is that Cbl functions as an adaptor to facilitate the phosphorylation of Syk by Src family kinases, which becomes defective in the absence of Cbl. This explanation is consistent with previous biochemical studies that Syk interacts with Cbl via the N-terminal tyrosine kinase binding domain, whereas Src family kinases associate with Cbl via its C-terminal proline-rich sequences (7Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 294-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Similarly, we could not detect a change of tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ2 or its association with BLNK, as observed in DT40 cells (11Yasuda T. Maeda A. Kurosaki M. Tezuka T. Hironaka K. Yamamoto T. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The discrepancy could be the difference of B cell origin. To support this notion, it was observed that Cbl-b–/– murine B cells display enhanced BCR signaling through the ubiquitination of Syk (6Sohn H.W. Gu H. Pierce S.K. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1511-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), whereas a decreased PLC-γ2 activation was observed in Cbl-b–/– DT40 B cells (25Yasuda T. Tezuka T. Maeda A. Inazu T. Yamanashi Y. Gu H. Kurosaki T. Yamamoto T. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In any case, the present genetic study using Cbl–/– primary B cells allows us to revisit the issue of Cbl in the regulation of BCR signaling. In this study, we also showed that Cbl–/– mice display an expanded subset of marginal zone B cells and a reduction of follicular B cells in the spleen, together with a marked increase in the population of B1 cells in the peritoneal cavity. Thus, Cbl regulates the cell fate decision during peripheral B cell development. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the lineage commitment of follicular versus marginal zone B cells, which includes the strength of BCR signal, chemokine-mediated cell migration, or Notch-regulated differentiation (26Martin F. Kearney J.F. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 323-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 27Pillai S. Cariappa A. Moran S.T. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 197: 206-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Our results partially supported the idea that BCR signaling strength is involved in follicular B cell development, because we detected decreased total tyrosine phosphorylation and Erk activation in Cbl–/– splenic B cells in response to BCR engagement. Intriguingly, we also observed an increase in marginal zone and B1 B cells in Cbl–/– mice, which does not fit with the signal strength model. Interestingly, both CD19 and PI3-kinase signaling are important in marginal zone and B1 B cell development (28Engel P. Zhou L.J. Ord D.C. Sato S. Koller B. Tedder T.F. Immunity. 1995; 3: 39-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 29Rickert R.C. Rajewsky K. Roes J. Nature. 1995; 376: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 30Wang Y. Brooks S.R. Li X. Anzelon A.N. Rickert R.C. Carter R.H. Immunity. 2002; 17: 501-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To be consistent with these observations, it was found that in Cbl–/– splenic B cells, CD19 phosphorylation and the downstream PI3-kinase activation were up-regulated. Thus, we propose that Cbl plays distinct roles in regulating BCR signaling pathways, which differentially affects B cell development. In summary, we presented evidence that Cbl plays relatively complicated roles in the signaling transduction emanated from the BCR engagement under physiological conditions. The present study focused on the analysis of splenic B cell development and activation and revealed unexpected findings different from previous biochemical studies. It is obvious that Cbl is ubiquitously expressed in other cells or tissues such as T cells or dendritic cells, which might also influence the B cell phenotype in Cbl–/– mice, although our adoptive transfer study showed that Cbl has an intrinsic role in B cell development (data not shown). Further dissection of BCR signaling in Cbl–/– B cells using biochemical and genetic approaches is needed to fully understand the diverse roles of Cbl in B cell signaling and B cell-mediated immune responses.

We recently sequenced the genome of a serotype M3 strain and identified a prophage-encoded secreted phospholipase A2 designated SlaA. To study SlaA structure-activity relationships, 20 site-specific mutants were constructed by alanine-replacement mutagenesis and purified to apparent homogeneity. Enzymatic activity was greatly reduced by alanine replacement of amino acid residues previously described as crucial in the catalytic mechanism of secreted phospholipase A2. Similarly, substitution of five residues in an inferred Ca2+-binding loop and three residues in the inferred active site region resulted in loss of activity of 76.5% or greater relative to the wild-type enzyme. Analysis of enzyme substrate specificity confirmed SlaA as a phospholipase A2, with activity against multiple phospholipid head groups and acyl chains located at the sn-2 position. PCR analysis of 1,189 GAS strains representing 48 M protein serotypes commonly causing human infections identified the slaA gene in 129 strains of nine serotypes (M1, M2, M3, M4, M6, M22, M28, M75, and st3757). Expression of SlaA by strains of these serotypes was confirmed by Western immunoblot. SlaA production increased rapidly and substantially on co-culture with Detroit 562 human pharyngeal epithelial cells. Together, these data provide new information about a novel extracellular enzyme that participates in GAS-human interactions.

In addition, prospective population-based surveillance studies have found that serotype M3 strains cause a higher rate of lethal infections than strains of other M types (13Sharkawy A. Low D.E.

Serotype M1 strains are important because they are the most common cause of pharyngitis and invasive episodes (1Musser J.M. Krause R.M. Krause R.M. Emerging Infections. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 185-218Google Scholar). One theme that has emerged from genome sequencing and related studies is that GAS strains contain multiple prophages that encode one or more proven or putative extracellular virulence factors (15Banks D.J. Beres S.B. Musser J.M. Trends Microbiol. 2002; 10: 515-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 16Banks D.J. Beres S.B. Musser J.M. Waldor M. Friedman D. Adhya S. Bacteriophages and Bacterial Pathogens. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2004Google Scholar). For example, the sequenced strains of serotype M1, M3, M6, and M18 have 4–6 prophages or prophage-like elements. These prophages account for the great majority of strain-to-strain variation in gene content, and hence, are fundamental contributors to strain diversification and evolution. Our analysis of the genome of serotype M3 strain MGAS315 identified a previously uncharacterized prophage-encoded extracellular phospholipase A2 (PLA2) designated SlaA (7Beres S.B. Sylva G.L. Barbian K.D. Lei B. Hoff J.S. Mammarella N.D. Liu M.Y. Smoot J.C. Porcella S.F. Parkins L.D. Campbell D.S. Smith T.M. McCormick J.K. Leung D.Y. Schlievert P.M. Musser J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10078-10083Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). This GAS enzyme was the first secreted PLA2 (sPLA2) described for a bacterial pathogen. SlaA has a region of conserved amino acids residues found in several sPLA2 enzymes, including toxins made by venomous snakes, such as textilotoxin made by the Australian common brown snake (17Pearson J.A. Tyler M.I. Retson K.V. Howden M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1161: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Of note, the prophage encoding SlaA was not present in serotype M3 GAS strains recovered before 1987, a time when resurgence of severe invasive disease episodes in North America, Europe, and Japan occurred (7Beres S.B. Sylva G.L. Barbian K.D. Lei B. Hoff J.S. Mammarella N.D. Liu M.Y. Smoot J.C. Porcella S.F. Parkins L.D. Campbell D.S. Smith T.M. McCormick J.K. Leung D.Y. Schlievert P.M. Musser J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10078-10083Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). More recent studies have shown that SlaA expression was induced when strain MGAS315 was exposed to human pharyngeal epithelial cells (18Banks D.J. Lei B. Musser J.M. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 7079-7086Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), consistent with the observation that humans with pharyngitis and invasive episodes seroconvert to SlaA (7Beres S.B. Sylva G.L. Barbian K.D. Lei B. Hoff J.S. Mammarella N.D. Liu M.Y. Smoot J.C. Porcella S.F. Parkins L.D. Campbell D.S. Smith T.M. McCormick J.K. Leung D.Y. Schlievert P.M. Musser J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10078-10083Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). In the aggregate, the data indicate that SlaA participates in host-pathogen interaction, perhaps as a factor that promotes colonization or virulence. The goal of the present study was to analyze enzyme structure-activity relationships in SlaA, assess the distribution of the slaA gene in strains of a wide variety of M protein serotypes, and examine in vitro expression of SlaA by GAS strains of diverse M protein serotypes.

An AKTA Explorer FPLC instrument (Amersham Biosciences) was used for all chromatography procedures. Recombinant SlaA (rSlaA) and SlaA mutants were purified from E. coli strains grown at 37 °C in 4 liters of Luria-Bertani broth supplemented with 100 mg of ampicillin per liter. Expression of recombinant protein was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at OD600 nm of 0.5, and growth was continued until early stationary phase. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in 40 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, and sonicated for 15 min. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was loaded onto a DEAE Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0 to 0.3 m NaCl in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. Fractions were analyzed for the presence of rSlaA by SDS-PAGE, and peak fractions were pooled. rSlaA was precipitated by adding (NH4)2SO4 (70% saturation at 25 °C). The precipitate was collected by centrifugation, suspended in 10 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and loaded onto a Phenyl-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow (high sub) column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 0.8 m (NH4)2SO4 in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. Protein was eluted with a step gradient of (NH4)2SO4 (0.16, 0.08, 0.016, and 0 m) in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. Fractions containing rSlaA were pooled, (NH4)2SO4 was added to 1.0 m, and the material was applied to an Octyl-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 1 m (NH4)2SO4 in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. The protein was eluted with a step gradient of (NH4)2SO4 (0.23, 0.1, 0.02, and 0 m) in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. Fractions containing rSlaA were pooled and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 4 liters of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. The dialysate was loaded onto a DEAE Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, and the protein was eluted with a step gradient of NaCl (0.20, 0.25, and 0.30 m). The fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE the fractions containing rSlaA were pooled, and the protein was concentrated with a 10,000 kDa Centricon Plus-20 filter (Millipore, Bedford MA) by centrifugation at 3,200 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The purified rSlaA was stored at –20 °C. rSlaA prepared by these procedures was greater than 95% pure, as assessed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining (see below). SDS-PAGE and Native-PAGE—Samples for SDS-PAGE analysis were boiled for 3 min, loaded onto a Ready Gel 15% Tris-HCl gel (Bio-Rad) in Laemmli sample buffer containing 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and resolved in running buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 192 mm glycine, 0.1% SDS) at 200 V for 35 min. Samples for native-PAGE analysis were loaded onto a Ready Gel 15% Tris-HCl gel (Bio-Rad) in Native Sample Buffer (Bio-Rad) and resolved in native running buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 192 mm glycine) at 90 V for 2 h. All gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. Western Immunoblot Analysis—Purified recombinant proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH) with Towbin transfer buffer using a Trans-Blot S.D. semi-dry transfer cell (Bio-Rad) at 15 V for 40 min. The membrane was blocked with Amersham Biosciences Liquid Block (diluted 1:20 in 150 mm NaCl and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) for 1 h, and incubated for 1 h with affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal α-SlaA antibody (1:10,000 dilution) (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX) added to the block solution. The membrane was rinsed twice and washed three times for 15 min each with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS. The membrane was incubated for 1 h with goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) diluted 1:4,000 in the block solution. The membrane was rinsed and washed as described above, and antibody-antigen interaction was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Monoclonal Antibody Production and Characterization—Three mouse monoclonal antibodies against purified rSlaA were generated by conventional methods (Lampire Biological Laboratories, Pipersville, PA). Linear epitope mapping was done with overlapping synthetic peptides (Mimotopes, Clayton, Victoria, Australia). Linear epitope mapping of monoclonal antibody 1D11–2H3, 1D11–3C3, and 9C3–2B12–11 identified reactivity with SlaA-specific peptide QNGELLKNYLILEGE, TQDKVSDDVLEMGML, and GQCQNHDSCYKWGAG, respectively. PLA2 Enzyme Activity Assay—Purified wild-type and mutant proteins were assayed for PLA2 activity with the sPLA2 assay kit purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). The assay measures the hydrolysis of phospholipids at the sn-1 and/or sn-2 position, yielding a free fatty acid and a lysophospholipid (25Reynolds L.J. Hughes L.L. Dennis E.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 204: 190-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). All calculations and graphing were performed using GraphPad Prism 3.0 (San Diego, CA). Analysis of Enzyme Substrate Specificity—Phospholipase A2 activity was detected using either fluorescent or radiolabeled substrates in mixed micelle form and radiolabeled dipalmitoyl [1,2-palmitoyl-1-14C]phosphatidylcholine (PC) in vesicle form (26Deems R.A. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For radiolabel assays, 8 μg of SlaA was mixed with 0.454 nm radiolabeled substrate and 58 μm cold (unlabeled) dipalmitoyl PC in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm CaCl2, and 0.25% Triton X-100. The radiolabeled substrates used included dipalmitoyl-[1,2-palmitoyl-1-14C]PC, 1-palmitoyl, 2-arachidonyl [arachidonyl-1-14C]PC, dipalmitoyl-[2-palmitoyl-1-14C]PC, 1-palmitoyl, 2-arachidonyl [arachidonyl-1-14C]phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), sphingomyelin [choline-methyl-14C] (SM, all from PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and dioleoyl phosphatidyl [3-14C]serine (PS, Amersham Biosciences). The test substrate was sonicated three times for 30 s and heated to 60 °C until clear before addition of the enzyme. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, and stopped by addition of chloroform-methanol-hydrochloric acid (50:50:0.3, v/v/v). For one-dimensional thin-layer chromatography, the lipids were analyzed with Silica Gel 60 plates, and separated with chloroform-methanol-water (14:6:1, v/v/v). Vesicle assays were done in the same manner with dipalmitoyl-[1, 2-palmitoyl-1-14C]PC, except without the addition of Triton X-100. Fluorescent mixed micelle assays were done using a range of 10–70 μg of SlaA mixed with 0.6 μg of FL C5, C16-phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (BODIPY, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) resuspended to 40 μm in 50 mm Tris-HCl with 2 mm CaCl2, 4.4 μm octylglucoside, and 0.02% bovine serum albumin. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, and the lipids were analyzed with Silica Gel 60 plates, in chloroform-acetone-methanol-water-ammonium hydroxide (45:35:8:2, v/v/v/v). Snake venom PLA2 from Naja mossambica mossambica (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a control. The fluorescent and radiolabeled lipids were visualized and analyzed using Personal FX Phosphorimager and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). DNA Sequence Analysis of the slaA Gene among GAS Strains—The slaA gene was sequenced using PCR-amplified gene fragments and internal primers. All sequence data were collected with an Applied Biosystems model 3700 instrument. Assessment of in Vitro Production of SlaA—GAS strains used to test for in vitro production of SlaA were cultured in protein-reduced Todd-Hewitt broth containing 0.2% (w/v) yeast extract (PR-THY; Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C (20Lei B. Mackie S. Lukomski S. Musser J.M. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6807-6818Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Bacteria were grown to mid-exponential, early stationary phase, and overnight, centrifuged, and the pellet was discarded. Culture supernatant proteins were precipitated with ethanol (final concentration, 75%), incubated for 1 h on ice and collected by centrifugation for 15 min at 12,000 × g. The precipitated proteins were suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and assayed for SlaA by Western immunoblot with rabbit α-SlaA polyclonal antisera, as described above. Co-culture of GAS Strains with Detroit 562 Human Pharyngeal Epithelial Cells—Detroit 562 human pharyngeal epithelial cells (D562 cells) were grown on collagen-coated glass coverslips in 24-well tissue culture plates containing 1 ml of MEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum and phosphate-buffered saline-glucose and grown 2–3 days to 80% confluency. The growth medium was removed, and the cells were washed with 1 ml of MEM + 1 mm Ca2+ and Mg2+. 1 ml of fresh medium was added, and the cells were incubated for 3 h. During this time, overnight cultures of GAS test strains were inoculated into 25 ml of fresh THY medium and cu"
https://openalex.org/W1969629619,"To investigate the separate contributions of the lipolytic versus ligand-binding function of hepatic lipase (HL) to plasma lipoprotein metabolism and atherosclerosis, we compared mice expressing catalytically active wild-type HL (HL-WT) and inactive HL (HL-S145G) with no endogenous expression of mouse apoE or HL (E-KO × HL-KO, where KO is knockout). HL-WT and HL-S145G reduced plasma cholesterol (by 40 and 57%, respectively), non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (by 48 and 61%, respectively), and apoB (by 36 and 44%, respectively) (p < 0.01), but only HL-WT decreased high density lipoprotein cholesterol (by 67%) and apoA-I (by 54%). Compared with E-KO × HL-KO mice, both active and inactive HL lowered the pro-atherogenic lipoproteins by enhancing the catabolism of autologous 125I-apoB very low density/intermediate density lipoprotein (VLDL/IDL) (fractional catabolic rates of 2.87 ± 0.04/day for E-KO × HL-KO, 3.77 ± 0.03/day for E-KO × HL-WT, and 3.63 ± 0.09/day for E-KO × HL-S145G mice) and 125I-apoB-48 low density lipoprotein (LDL) (fractional catabolic rates of 5.67 ± 0.34/day for E-KO × HL-KO, 18.88 ± 1.72/day for E-KO × HL-WT, and 9.01 ± 0.14/day for E-KO × HL-S145G mice). In contrast, the catabolism of apoE-free, 131I-apoB-100 LDL was not increased by either HL-WT or HL-S145G. Infusion of the receptor-associated protein (RAP), which blocks LDL receptor-related protein function, decreased plasma clearance and hepatic uptake of 131I-apoB-48 LDL induced by HL-S145G. Despite their similar effects on lowering pro-atherogenic apoB-containing lipoproteins, HL-WT enhanced atherosclerosis by up to 50%, whereas HL-S145G markedly reduced aortic atherosclerosis by up to 96% (p < 0.02) in both male and female E-KO × HL-KO mice. These data identify a major receptor pathway (LDL receptor-related protein) by which the ligand-binding function of HL alters remnant lipoprotein uptake in vivo and delineate the separate contributions of the lipolytic versus ligand-binding function of HL to plasma lipoprotein size and metabolism, identifying an anti-atherogenic role of the ligand-binding function of HL in vivo.

HL functions both as an acylglycerol hydrolase and a phospholipase, hydrolyzing triglycerides (TG) and phospholipids (PL) in chylomicron remnants and intermediate density lipoproteins (IDL). In humans, HL plays a major role in determining low density lipoprotein (LDL) subclass distribution, which may in turn modulate atherogenic risk (3Couture P. Otvos J.D. Cupples L.A. Lahoz C.

In addition to its function as a lipolytic enzyme, HL has a separate role in lipoprotein metabolism by directly facilitating the uptake of lipoproteins and lipoprotein lipids by cell-surface receptors and/or proteoglycans. In this respect, HL could serve as a ligand that facilitates these interactions or, alternatively, could function as a coreceptor. In vitro studies have demonstrated that HL enhances the binding and/or uptake of chylomicrons, chylomicron remnants, β-very low density protein (VLDL), and LDL (15Krapp A. Ahle S. Kersting S. Hua Y.

Initial evidence for a ligand-binding function of HL in cellular lipid uptake and lipoprotein metabolism, independent of the lipolytic function of the lipase, came from studies using heat-inactivated HL (18Diard P. Malewiak M.-I. Lagrange D. Griglio S. Biochemical J. 1994; 299: 889-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and anti-HL antibodies (19Choi S.Y. Komaromy M.C. Chen J. Fong L.G. Cooper A.D. J.

These data were confirmed and extended by in vivo experiments that either infused the receptor-associated protein (RAP) and anti-HL/LDLR antibodies (24de Faria E. Fong L.G. Komaromy M. Cooper A.D. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 197-209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or expressed a catalytically inactive form of HL, HL-S145G, in various mouse models. Adenoviral and transgenic overexpression of HL-S145G in apoE knockout (E-KO) mice demonstrated that the ligand-binding function of HL lowers the plasma concentrations of apoB-containing lipoproteins (apoB-Lp) in the absence of apoE (25Amar M.J.A. Dugi K.A. Haudenschild C.C. Shamburek R.D. Foeger B. Chase M. Bensadoun A. Hoyt Jr., R.F. Brewer Jr., H.B. Santamarina-Fojo S. J.

Decreased apoB-Lp levels are also observed in transgenic mice that overexpress catalytically inactive HL in LDLR knockout (KO) mice (27Dichek H.L. Johnson S.M. Akeefe H. Lo G.T. Sage E. Yap C.E. Mahley R.W. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 201-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, adenoviral expression of HL-S145G in mice with no endogenous expression of HL (HL-KO) decreased the plasma concentrations of HDL-C by mechanisms independent of lipolysis (28Dugi K.A. Amar M.J.A. Haudenschild C.C. Shamburek R.D. Bensadoun A. Hoyt Jr., R.F. Fruchart-Najib J. Madj Z. Brewer Jr., H.B. Santamarina-Fojo S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

However, these in vivo reports are limited by the confounding effects of having fully active, endogenous mouse HL present along with HL-S145G in the adenovirus and transgenic studies in E-KO mice and by non-steady-state expression of catalytically inactive HL-S145G in the adenovirus studies (25Amar M.J.A.

More recently, Dichek et al. (29Dichek H.L. Qian K. Agrawal N. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 551-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) reported that overexpression of catalytically inactive HL in LDLR-KO, LDLR-KO × apoB-100, and LDLR-KO × apoB-48 (HL-KO) mice facilitates the clearance of apoB-48- and apoB-100-containing lipoproteins. Recent studies in human patients with HL deficiency also support an important role of the ligand-binding function of HL in vivo. Zambon et al. (30Zambon A. Deeb S.S. Bensadoun A. Foster K.E. Brunzell J.D. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 2094-2099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the presence or absence of HL protein in HL-deficient subjects leads to significant differences in the cholesterol content of apoB-Lp. These combined data support an important physiological role for the ligand-binding function of HL in lipoprotein metabolism in vivo. These multiple functions of HL, which facilitate not only plasma lipid metabolism, but also cellular lipid uptake, can be anticipated to have a major and complex impact on atherogenesis. Indeed, human and animal studies support both pro-atherogenic and anti-atherogenic roles for HL (14Zambon A.A. Deeb S.S. Pauletto P.B. Crepaldi G.A. Brunzell J.D. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2003; 14 (S. S.

Atherosclerosis. 1996; 124: 1-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In humans, low or absent HL activity has been associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease (31Santamarina-Fojo S. Haudenschild C. Amar M.J.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 34Dugi K.A. Brandauer K. Schmidt N. Nau B. Schneider J.G. Mentz S. Keiper T. Schaefer J.R. Meissner C. Kather H. Bahner M.L.

Sci. 1998; 35: 547-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Other studies have concluded that decreased HL activity does not influence susceptibility to coronary artery disease (8Shohet R.V. Vega G.L. Anwar A. Cigarroa J.E. Grundy S.M. Cohen J.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1975-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Finally, increased HL activity has been reported in patients with coronary artery disease (36Katzel L.I. Coon P.J. Busby M.J. Gottlieb S.O. Krauss R.M. Goldberg A.P. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 814-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 37Zambon A. Deeb S.S. Brown B.G. Hokanson J.E. Brunzell J.D. Circulation. 2001; 103: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A pro-atherogenic role for HL has been suggested from the inverse correlation between increased HL activity and the plasma levels of anti-atherogenic HDL and the positive correlation with small, dense, pro-atherogenic LDL (37Zambon A. Deeb S.S. Brown B.G. Hokanson J.E. Brunzell J.D. Circulation. 2001; 103: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 38Lamarche B. Tchernoff A. Moorjani S. Cantin B. Dagenais G.R. Lupien P.J. Despres J.P. Circulation. 1997; 95: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). Analyses of transgenic and knockout animal models have also provided conflicting data regarding the role that HL plays in atherosclerosis. HL overexpression beneficially alters the plasma lipid profile of mice and rabbits by reducing the amount of cholesterol present in apoB-Lp (26Dichek H.L. Brecht W. Fan J. Ji Z.-S. McCormick S.P.A. Akeefe H. Conzo L. Sanan D.A. Weisgraber K.H. Young S.G. Taylor J.M. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1896-1903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 27Dichek H.L.

In addition, overexpression of human HL reduces the aortic cholesterol content in cholesterol-fed mice (40Busch S.J. Barnhart R.L. Martin G.A. Fitzgerald M.C. Yates M.T. Mao S.J. Thomas C.E. Jackson R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16376-16382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in both species, HL also leads to the formation of potentially small, dense, pro-atherogenic LDL (41Barbagallo C.M. Fan J. Blanche P.J. Rizzo M. Taylor J.M. Krauss R.M. Arterioscler. Thromb.

Finally, HL deficiency in E-KO and lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase-overexpressing transgenic mice significantly reduces aortic atherosclerosis despite the increase in cholesterol content in apoB-Lp (44Mezdour H. Jones R. Dengremont C. Castro G. Maeda N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13570-13575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 45Nong Z. González-Navarro H. Amar M.J.A.

These conflicting data in mice have been explained in part by the recent discovery of HL expression in mouse macrophages (46González-Navarro H. Nong Z. Freeman L. Bensadoun A. Peterson K. Santamarina-Fojo S. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 671-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by bone marrow transplantation studies demonstrating that macrophage HL expression in the arterial wall enhances early lesion formation in E-KO and lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase-overexpressing transgenic mice, without modification of plasma lipoprotein lipids or HL activities (45Nong Z. González-Navarro H. Amar M.J.A. Freeman L. Knapper C. Neufeld E.B. Paigen B.J. Hoyt R.F. Fruchart-Najib J. Santamarina-Fojo S. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Despite these recent advances, the independent roles of the ligand-binding versus lipolytic function in lipoprotein metabolism and the development of atherosclerosis are not well defined. Here, we have investigated the effects of the lipolytic versus the ligand-binding function of HL on plasma lipoprotein metabolism and atherosclerosis. In this study, we utilized mice with stable, steady-state expression of catalytically active HL-WT or inactive HL-S145G in liver in a background lacking endogenous HL or apoE to circumvent the limitations encountered in previous studies. We demonstrate that whereas the lipolytic function of HL significantly contributes to plasma HDL metabolism, the ligand-binding function of HL is responsible for lowering the plasma concentrations of pro-atherogenic apoB-Lp by enhancing their catabolism via the LRP pathway. Despite their similar effects on lowering pro-atherogenic apoB-Lp, expression of HL-WT enhances atherosclerosis, whereas expression of HL-S145G markedly reduces aortic atherosclerosis in E-KO mice. These data define a major receptor pathway by which the ligand-binding function of HL alters apoB-Lp catabolism in vivo and identify divergent roles for the lipolytic versus ligand-binding function of HL in lipoprotein metabolism and atherosclerosis. Mice and Diets—The generation of pCMV vectors containing wild-type and catalytically inactive human HL cDNAs has been described previously (25Amar M.J.A. Dugi K.A. Haudenschild C.C. Shamburek R.D.

After digestion with SalI and SpeI, a fragment containing the human apoE promoter, the human HL cDNA, the poly(A) signal from the human apoE gene, and the hepatic and macrophage control regions of the apoE/apoC-I locus was isolated and injected into the male pronucleus of fertilized eggs from superovulating C57BL/6N females (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA). Integration of the human HL cDNA in newborn mice was determined by dot blot and Southern blot hybridization of genomic tail DNA using the full-length human HL cDNA as a probe. Human HL transgenic mice were crossbred with HL-KO (47Homanics G.E. De Silva H.V. Osada J. Zhang S.H. Wong H. Borensztajn J. Maeda N. J. Biol.

Animals were fed a rodent autoclaved chow diet (NIH-07 chow diet, 0.025% cholesterol and 4.5% fat; Ziegler Brothers, Inc., Gardner, PA). Northern and Western Blot Analyses—Total mouse RNA was isolated from mouse liver, spleen, heart, lung, fat, ovary, brain, kidney, and macrophages using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and human liver poly(A)+ RNA was purchased from Ambion Inc.

The membrane was hybridized with a digoxigenin-labeled human or mouse HL riboprobe and detected using a digoxigenin chemiluminescent detection kit (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). The human HL riboprobe was generated by transcription of a 554-bp SmaI-EcoRV fragment of human HL cDNA and subcloned into pBluescript II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The mouse riboprobe was generated by transcription of a 462-bp ApaI-EcoRI fragment of mouse HL cDNA subcloned into pBluescript II. A 32P-labeled 693-bp cyclophilin cDNA probe (Ambion Inc.) was used for standardization. For protein expression studies, HL protein was isolated from pre- or post-heparin plasma using a HiTrap heparin column (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden), and liver homogenates were prepared from 100 mg of tissue as described (46González-Navarro H.

Analysis of Plasma, Lipid Lipoproteins, and Apolipoproteins—After a 4-h fast, mouse plasma samples were collected from blood obtained from the retro-orbital plexus of mice anesthetized with methoxyflurane (Pitman-Moore, Mundelein, IL) and placed into precooled tubes containing EDTA as reported (45Nong Z.

Their subcellular distribution and surface density thus help shape neuronal excitability, yet mechanisms governing the membrane targeting and localization of Kir channels are poorly understood. Here we report a direct interaction between the strong inward rectifier, Kir2.1, and a recently identified splice variant of postsynaptic density-93 (PSD-93), a protein involved the subcellular targeting of ion channels and glutamate receptors at excitatory synapses. Yeast two-hybrid screening of a human brain cDNA library using the carboxyl terminus of Kir2.1 as bait yielded cDNA encoding the first two PDZ domains of PSD-93, but with an extended N-terminal region that diverged from other PSD-93 isoforms. This clone represented the human homologue of the mouse PSD-93 splice variant, PSD-93δ. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed diffuse low level PSD-93δ expression throughout the brain, with significantly higher levels in spinal cord. In vitro binding studies revealed that a type I PDZ recognition motif at the extreme C terminus of the Kir2.1 mediates interaction with all three PDZ domains of PSD-93δ, and association between Kir2 channels and PSD-93δ was confirmed further by the ability of anti-Kir2.1 antibodies to coimmunoprecipitate PSD-93δ from rat spinal cord lysates. Functionally, coexpression of Kir2.1 and PSD-93δ had no discernible effect upon channel kinetics but resulted in cell surface Kir2.1 clustering and suppression of channel internalization. We conclude that PSD-93δ is potentially an important regulator of the spatial and temporal distribution of Kir2 channels within neuronal membranes of the central nervous system.

We conclude that PSD-93δ is potentially an important regulator of the spatial and temporal distribution of Kir2 channels within neuronal membranes of the central nervous system. Inwardly rectifying potassium channels comprise a family of integral membrane proteins whose diverse cellular functions include maintenance of the resting membrane potential, control of neuronal excitability and heart rate, and potassium homeostasis (1Nichols C.G. Lopatin A.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 2Isomoto S. Kondo C. Kurachi Y. Jpn J.

Underlying these functions is the property of inward rectification, the ability to allow potassium to move easily into the cell at membrane potentials negative to the potassium equilibrium potential (EK) but to restrict potassium outflow at potentials positive to EK. This asymmetry in the current-voltage relation results from the channel's susceptibility to voltage-dependent block by intracellular polyamines and magnesium ions (4Matsuda H. Saigusa A. Irisawa H. Nature. 1987; 325: 156-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 5Lopatin A.N. Makhina E.N. Nichols C.G. Nature. 1994; 372: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar) and ensures that, while being extremely active around EK, they pass little or no current at membrane potentials positive to –40 mV.

This pivotal role in the regulation of the membrane potential makes Kir channels attractive candidates for modulation by neurotransmitters and hormones, since even small fluctuations in Kir channel activity have profound effects on the resting membrane potential and, hence, cellular excitability (2Isomoto S. Kondo C. Kurachi Y. Jpn J. Physiol. 1997; 47: 11-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 6Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 91-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar).Members of the classical strong inwardly rectifying Kir2 subfamily are expressed widely in neuronal tissues. Within the brain, they show a differential distribution: Kir2.1, -2.2, and -2.3 are abundant in the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, striatum, and hippocampus, whereas Kir2.2 is the only subunit that shows significant levels of expression in the brainstem, thalamus, and cerebellum (7Karschin C. Dissmann E. Stuhmer W. Karschin A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3559-3570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Karschin C. Karschin A. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1997; 10: 131-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Kir2.1 and -2.2 additionally show overlapping expression in regions of the midbrain where Kir2.3 is largely absent. Of all the Kir2 family members, Kir2.4 exhibits the most restricted subunit distribution, being found only in neurons of cranial nerve motor nuclei in the midbrain and brainstem (9Töpert C. Doring F. Wischmeye R.E. Karschin C. Brockhaus J. Ballanyi K. Derst C. Karschin A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4096-4105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is assumed that the differential distribution of Kir2 channel subunits throughout the brain underlies specific functions in the regulation of excitability within different neuronal populations. Additionally, the subcellular localization of Kir2 channels defines their physiological function. Kir2.3 channels, for example, are specifically localized to postsynaptic membranes of the dendritic spines of granule cells within the forebrain, where they are believed to contribute to the resting membrane potential and the regulation of excitatory synaptic transmission (10Inanobe A. Fujita A. Ito M. Tomoike H. Inageda K. Kurachi Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C1396-C1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, despite their potential importance, mechanisms involved in the control of subcellular localization and distribution of Kir2 channels within the central nervous system are incompletely understood.A potential method of targeting Kir2 family members to specific neuronal membranes is through interaction with selected members of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) protein family (10Inanobe A.

In mammals, these intracellular scaffolding proteins comprise a family of four main members: PSD-95/SAP90, its closely related homologue PSD-93/ chapsyn 110, SAP102, and SAP97/hDlg (16Dimitratos S.D. Woods D.F. Stathakis D.G. Bryant P.J. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 912-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). These proteins are characterized by the presence of three N-terminal PDZ domains (so-called because they were originally recognized as repeats in the proteins PSD-95, discs large, and zona occludens-1), an Src homology 3 domain and an enzymatically inactive guanylate kinase-like region. All of these domains mediate specific protein-protein interactions and have been implicated in the assembly of extensive signaling protein complexes at junctional sites such as synapses (17Craven S.E.

Kir2.1 and Kir2.3 are able to bind PSD-95/SAP90 via a type I PDZ domain recognition motif located at the channel's extreme C terminus (11Cohen N.A. Brenman J.E. Snyder S.H. Bredt D.S.

Physiol. 2002; 282: C1396-C1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Kir2.1, -2.2, and -2.3 also interact with SAP97 in the cerebellum and nonneuronal tissues such as the heart (13Leonoudakis D. Mailliard W.S. Wingerd K.L. Clegg D.O. Vandenberg C.A. J.

Recent detailed proteomic analysis of Kir2-associated proteins in brain revealed additional interactions with the family of CASK-like MAGUK proteins CASK/Lin-2, Dlg2, Dlg3, and Pals2 (14Leonoudakis D. Conti L.R. Radeke C.M. McGuire L.M. Vandenberg C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19051-19063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 15Leonoudakis D. Conti L.R. Andersen S.

These MAGUK proteins differ from the PSD-95/SAP-90 family by possessing a single class II N-terminal PDZ domain, which makes it unlikely that they bind directly to Kir2 channels but are most likely recruited to Kir2 complexes through association with SAP-97. This ability to interact with different MAGUKs may reflect a fundamental requirement for differential targeting of Kir2 channels within cells. PSD-95 and PSD-93, for example, are found predominantly at postsynaptic sites within neurons, whereas SAP102 is also found in axons and some presynaptic terminals (22El-Husseini A.E. Topinka J.R.

SAP-97 localizes to presynaptic terminals and axons and is unusual among the MAGUKs in that it is less tightly associated with the membrane (23Müller B.M. Kistner U. Veh R.W. Cases-Langhoff C. Becker B. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2354-2366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, PSD-95 and PSD-93 mediate surface ion channel and receptor clustering, whereas SAP-102 and SAP-97 do not (13Leonoudakis D. Mailliard W.S. Wingerd K.L. Clegg D.O. Vandenberg C.A. J.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6415-6425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).We are interested in the molecular mechanisms involved in the subcellular targeting and localization of members of the Kir2 subfamily of strong inward rectifiers. Here we report the result of a yeast two-hybrid screen of human brain cDNA library using a C-terminal portion of Kir2.1 (residues 307–428) as bait. This screen identified an alternatively spliced isoform of PSD-93/chapsyn 110 as a binding partner for Kir2.1. This variant exhibits an extended N-terminal region that diverges from other PSD-93 isoforms just before the first PDZ domain and represents the human homologue of the recently identified mouse PSD-93 splice variant, PSD-93δ (27Parker M.J. Zhao S. Bredt D.S. Sanes J.R. Feng G. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 378-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We find that this new N-terminal variant of PSD-93 is preferentially expressed within the spinal cord and go on to investigate the potential functional consequences of Kir2.1 interaction with PSD-93δ. We demonstrate that whereas it has no discernible effect upon channel kinetics, association between Kir2.1 and PSD-93δ promotes cell surface Kir2.1 clustering and suppresses ion channel internalization. We propose that PSD-93δ acts as an anchoring protein for Kir2.1, ensuring its stable surface expression and potentially controlling its location and proximity to other proteins within neuronal membranes of the central nervous system.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies, Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis, and Immunoblotting—The following primary antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal anti-PDZ (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), rabbit polyclonal anti-PSD-93 (Chemicon), rabbit polyclonal anti-glutathione S-transferase (GST) (Sigma), rat monoclonal high affinity anti-HA (Roche Applied Science), and rabbit polyclonal anti-Kir2.1 (a kind gift from Dr. R. Norman, Department of Medicine, University of Leicester, UK). Horseradish peroxidase-, Texas Red-, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, and anti-rat secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. Anti-PSD-93δ polyclonal antibodies were generated to a synthetic peptide MNAYLTKQHSCSRGSDGMDI, corresponding to amino acids 1–20 of PSD-93δ. The peptide was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used to immunize rabbits. Protein extracts were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide-Tris gels and transferred electrophoretically onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Immunoblotting was carried out as described previously (28Dart C. Leyland M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20499-20505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).Plasmid Constructs—pGEX-Kir2.1 (aa 421–428) has been described previously (28Dart C. Leyland M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20499-20505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Individual PDZ domains from PSD-93δ, PDZ1 (aa 130–227), PDZ2 (aa 228–322), and PDZ3 (aa 456–549) were amplified by PCR and inserted between the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-2T. Hexahistidine (His)-tagged Kir2.1 C terminus was constructed by amplifying the region encoding aa 307–428 by PCR and inserting this fragment between the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET15b. The same PCR product was also inserted into pGBT9 to create the GAL4 binding domain construct pGBT9-Kir2.1C. The Kir2.1 construct in pcDNA3, EGFP-Kir2.1, and HA-Kir2.1 expression constructs have been described previously (28Dart C. Leyland M.L. J. Biol.

PSD-93α and PSD-93β in the mammalian expression vector pGW1 were a generous gift from Professor David Bredt (University of California, San Francisco CA). Full-length PSD93δ was constructed by PCR amplification of the unique N-terminal region using the following primer pair: 5′-GGGGGTACCGCCACCATGAATGCATACCTCACCAAGCAACACAGC-3′ and 5′-GGGGCTAGCCTGTGCTGGGCTGAACCAACCATGTGG-3′. Following digestion of the PCR product with KpnI and NheI, this fragment was ligated into KpnI/NheI-digested pGW1-PSD-93β. All PCR-amplified DNA constructs were verified by DNA sequencing.Yeast Two-hybrid Library Screen—The C-terminal region of Kir2.1 (aa 307–428) was amplified by PCR and inserted in frame with the GAL4 binding domain of plasmid pGBT9 (BD Biosciences) to create pGBT9-Kir2.1C. This construct was used to screen a human brain cDNA library in the activation domain plasmid pACT2 as described by the manufacturer (BD Clontech). pGBT9-Kir2.1C and the pACT2 library plasmids were used to cotransform the yeast strain Y190 using the lithium acetate protocol. Approximately 1 × 106 transformants were selected on synthetic minimal medium that lacked tryptophan, leucine, and histidine and contained 25 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. His+ colonies were selected and assayed for β-galactosidase activity using the colony filter lift assay. Plasmid DNA from His+ LacZ+ colonies were isolated by standard methods. β-Galactosidase liquid assays were performed in yeast strain Y187 as described by the manufacturer (Clontech).Cells and Cell Transfection—HEK293 were grown in minimal essential medium supplemented with 1% nonessential amino acids and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. All media and reagents were from Invitrogen. No antibiotics were used. Cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfections were performed in 6-well culture plates with cells at 80% confluence.Recombinant Protein Expression, in Vitro Binding, and GST Pull-down Assays—GST fusion proteins were produced by inducing Escherichia coli DH5α cells containing the appropriate plasmid with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4–5 h at 37 °C. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 0.5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cells were lysed by sonication, Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1% (v/v), and the lysates were cleared by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). The supernatant was added to a suspension of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated with mixing at 4 °C for 30 min. Glutathione-Sepharose beads were washed 3 times in PBS and GST fusion proteins eluted with glutathione elution buffer (20 mm reduced glutathione, 120 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8). Purity was determined by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. His-tagged Kir2.1C was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS by induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside as described above. Pellets were resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) containing 8 m urea. Following sonication, the lysate was cleared by centrifugation. Supernatants were incubated with Talon metal affinity resin (Clontech) for 15 min at room temperature, and bound His-Kir2.1C was refolded by washing with serial dilutions of urea (8, 6, 4, 2, 0 m) in buffer A. Renatured His-tagged Kir 2.1C (aa 307–428) was resolved by SDS-PAGE (10%) and transferred onto nitrocellulose. Membranes were incubated overnight with block buffer and overlaid with equal quantities of GST and GST-tagged PDZ domain fusion proteins (1 h, 20 °C). Following extensive washing in blot buffer, membranes were exposed to anti-GST antibody (1:1000 in blot buffer, 1 h, 20 °C), washed, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:10,000 in blot buffer, 1 h, 20 °C).To identify interactions between PSD-93 isoforms and Kir2.1, the GST fusion protein of the PDZ binding motif of Kir2.1 (residues 421–428) was incubated with lysates of HEK293 cells expressing PSD-93 isoforms. Extracts from transfected HEK293 cells were prepared 48 h post-transfection. Cells were washed briefly in PBS and incubated with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, pH 7.6) containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) for 30 min on ice. The extract was cleared by centrifugation (10,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min). The supernatant was added to 200 μlof glutathione-Sepharose beads, loaded with equal amounts of either GST or GST-Kir2.1 (aa 421–428), and incubated at 4 °C with gentle inversion for 1 h. The beads were pelleted by gentle centrifugation and washed three times with lysis buffer. The beads were resuspended in 200 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer and boiled, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then transferred electrophoretically onto Hybond-ECL membranes and detected using anti-PDZ antibodies as above.Reverse Transcription PCR—Forward primers to PSD-93 isoforms were designed using the region containing the unique N-terminal domains. These were as follows: PSD-93α, 5′-ATGTTCTTTGCATGTTACTGTGCACTC-3′ (nucleotides 1–27); PSD-93β, 5′-ATGATTTGCCACTGCAAAGTTGCTTGC-3′ (nucleotides 1–27); PSD-93δ, 5′-ATGAATGCATACCTCACCAAGCAACAC-3′ (nucleotides 1–27).The reverse primer was common to all isoforms: 5′-CAATTGTCACAAAATAGGTCGTCTTCTACG-3′ (bp 681–661 of PSD-93δ). Reverse transcription-PCR was performed with the Access reverse transcription-PCR system (Promega) using either 1 μg of rat or mouse brain total RNA (Ambion) or 1 μg of mouse brain total RNA panel (Abcam). Following reverse transcription (48 °C for 45 min followed by 94 °C for 2 min), DNA was synthesized by 40 cycles of PCR (30 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 50 °C, and 1 min at 68 °C) followed by a final extension at 68 °C for 7 min. Reaction products were separated by 1.4% agarose gel electrophoresis. Identity of the product was confirmed by sequencing.Coimmunoprecipitation—Rat spinal cord was homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The cleared lysate was incubated overnight with either 5 μg of rabbit nonimmune control serum or rabbit polyclonal anti-Kir2.1. Antibody complexes were isolated by the addition of Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C. Following centrifugation, the beads were washed five times in ice-cold PBS, and bound proteins were eluted by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and analyzed by immunoblotting.Biotin Protection Assay—To investigate the effect of PSD-93δ coexpression on the rate of Kir2.1 internalization, we used a modified form of surface biotinylation termed biotin protection. HEK293 cells expressing HA-Kir2.1 alone or HA-Kir2.1 and PSD-93δ were plated out into poly-l-lysine-coated 6-well culture plates and allowed to reach 80% confluence. Cells were washed twice in PBS, and surface proteins were biotinylated by the addition of 1 ml of sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) membrane-impermeant disulfide-linked (“cleavable”) biotin (0.5 mg/ml in PBS; Pierce) to each well followed by 30 min of incubation at 4 °C. Cells were washed briefly in PBS, and excess biotin was quenched with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, for 10 min at 4 °C. Prewarmed medium (minimal essential medium supplemented with 1% nonessential amino acids and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum) was added to each well, and cells were placed in an incubator at 37 °C to allow internalization to take place. At various time points (30, 60, 90, or 120 min), cells were removed from the incubator, and internalization was stopped by placing the cells on ice. Any remaining (not yet internalized or recycled) surface biotin was stripped from the cell surface by incubation in a solution containing 50 mm glutathione, 75 mm NaCl, 75 mm NaOH, and 10% fetal bovine serum for 5 min. The glutathione solution was then removed, and excess glutathione was quenched by the addition of 50 mm iodoacetamide and 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 2 × 10 min. Cells were subsequently lysed, and internalized (“protected”) biotinylated proteins were recovered by incubation with strepavidin-agarose (Sigma; 20–30 μl of beads per 400 μl of lysates incubated with gentle agitation for 2 h at 4 °C). The recovered internalized proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the amount of HA-Kir2.1 that had been internalized over the various time points was assessed by immunoblotting with anti-HA.Immunocytochemistry—HEK293 cells were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips and transiently transfected with the appropriate plasmids. Cells expressing EGFP-Kir2.1 and PSD-93 isoforms were fixed and permeabilized 48 h post-transfection in a solution containing 80 mm Na2HPO4, 20 mm NaH2PO4, 2% paraformaldehyde, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Fixed cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with mouse monoclonal anti-PDZ diluted 250-fold in PBS containing 10% (v/v) goat serum. The following morning, the coverslips were washed 5 × 10 min in PBS and then incubated in goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated with Texas Red in PBS plus 10% goat serum for 2 h at room temperature. Coverslips were washed in PBS for 3 × 10 min and mounted onto microscope slides using fluorescent mounting medium (Dako Ltd.) before viewing. Confocal images were obtained using a PerkinElmer UltraView™ imaging system equipped with a krypton/argon laser and × 60 oil immersion lens with numerical aperture of 1.0.Electrophysiology—Whole-cell currents were recorded from HEK293 cells typically 24–48 h post-transfection using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments). Currents recorded in response to voltage steps were filtered at 5 kHz (–3 dB, 8-pole Bessel), digitized at 10 kHz using a DigiData 1320A interface (Axon Instruments), and analyzed using pCLAMP software. Electrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass (outer diameter 1.5 mm, inner diameter 1.17 mm; Clarke Electromedical, Pangbourne, UK) and fire-polished to give a final resistance of 5 megaohms when filled. The pipette-filling solution contained 140 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. The external solution contained 70 mm KCl, 70 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.25. The junction potential between pipette and external solutions was sufficiently small (<1.5 mV) to be neglected. As far as possible, analogue means were used to correct capacity transients. Up to 90% compensation was routinely used to correct for series resistance. All experiments were performed at room temperature (18–22 °C), and the results are expressed as mean ± S.E.RESULTSIdentification of PSD93δ as a Binding Partner of Kir2.1 by Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—To isolate binding part"
https://openalex.org/W2077801167,"Kaposi's sarcoma-associated human herpesvirus (KSHV) is thought to cause Kaposi's sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and multicentric Castleman's disease. Previously, we reported that the KSHV complement control protein (KCP) encoded within the viral genome is a potent regulator of the complement system; it acts both as a cofactor for factor I and accelerates decay of the C3 convertases (Spiller, O. B., Blackbourn, D. J., Mark, L., Proctor, D. G., and Blom, A. M. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 9283-9289). KCP is a homologue to human complement regulators, being comprised of four complement control protein (CCP) domains. In this, the first study to identify the functional sites of a viral homologue at the amino acid level, we created a three-dimensional homology-based model followed by site-directed mutagenesis to locate complement regulatory sites. Classical pathway regulation, both through decay acceleration and factor I cleavage of C4b, required a cluster of positively charged amino acids in CCP1 stretching into CCP2 (Arg-20, Arg-33, Arg-35, Lys-64, Lys-65, and Lys-88) as well as positively (Lys-131, Lys-133, and His-135) and negatively (Glu-99, Glu-152, and Asp-155) charged areas at opposing faces of the border region between CCPs 2 and 3. The regulation of the alternative pathway (via factor I-mediated C3b cleavage) was found to both overlap with classical pathway regulatory sites (Lys-64, Lys-65, Lys-88 and Lys-131, Lys-133, His-135) as well as require unique, more C-terminal residues in CCPs 3 and 4 (His-158, His-171, and His-213) and CCP 4 (Phe-195, Phe-207, and Leu-209). We show here that KCP has evolved to maintain the spatial structure of its functional sites, especially the positively charged patches, compared with host complement regulators."
https://openalex.org/W2165036501,"Nitric oxide (NO) represents a short lived mediator that pivotally drives keratinocyte movements during cutaneous wound healing. In this study, we have identified p68 DEAD box RNA helicase (p68) from an NO-induced differential keratinocyte cDNA library. Subsequently, we have analyzed regulation of p68 by wound-associated mediators in human and murine keratinocytes. NO, serum, growth factors, and pro-inflammatory cytokines were potent inducers of p68 expression in the cells. p68 was constitutively expressed in the epithelial compartment of murine skin. Upon injury, we found a transient down-regulation of overall p68 protein in wound tissue. However, p68 did not completely disappear during early wound repair, as we found an expression of p68 protein in isolated wound margin tissue 24 h after wounding. Moreover, immunohistochemistry and cell fractionation analysis revealed a restricted localization of p68 in keratinocyte nuclei of the developing epithelium. Accordingly, cultured keratinocytes also showed a nuclear localization of the helicase. Moreover, confocal microscopy revealed a strong localization of p68 protein within the nucleoli of the cells. Functional analyses demonstrated that p68 strongly participated in keratinocyte proliferation and gene expression. Keratinocytes that constitutively overexpressed p68 protein were characterized by a marked increase in serum-induced proliferation and vascular endothelial growth factor expression, whereas down-regulation of endogenous p68 using small interfering RNA markedly attenuated serum-induced proliferation and vascular endothelial growth factor expression. Altogether, our results suggest a tightly controlled expression and nucleolar localization of p68 in keratinocytes in vitro and during skin repair in vivo that functionally contributes to keratinocyte proliferation and gene expression.

Altogether, our results suggest a tightly controlled expression and nucleolar localization of p68 in keratinocytes in vitro and during skin repair in vivo that functionally contributes to keratinocyte proliferation and gene expression. The story of RNA helicases started in 1980, as a yet unknown 68-kDa-sized protein was identified by its strong cross-reactivity with an antibody that has been raised against the simian virus 40 large T antigen (1Lane D.P. Hoeffler W. Nature. 1980; 288: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). A few years later, the cDNA was cloned, and subsequent sequence determination revealed a 68-kDa protein that was characterized by a marked homology to the eucaryotic initiation factor-4A (2Ford M.J. Anton I.A. Lane D.P. Nature. 1988; 332: 736-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The strikingly conserved motifs of both eucaryotic initiation factor-4A and the identified 68-kDa protein led to the proposal of a novel “DEAD” box family of proteins (3Linder P. Lasko P.F. Leroy P. Nielsen P.J. Nishi K. Schnier J. Slominski P.P. Nature. 1989; 337: 121-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). To date, it is now well established that the increasing number of DEAD box proteins are structurally characterized by eight conserved motifs from which the Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD) motif has been used to determine the name of the protein family (3Linder P. Lasko P.F. Leroy P. Nielsen P.J. Nishi K. Schnier J. Slominski P.P. Nature. 1989; 337: 121-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Subsequent biochemical studies revealed that members of the DEAD box family of proteins were characterized by their potency to unwind double-stranded RNA molecules in an energy-dependent fashion through the hydrolysis of NTP and thus act as prototypical RNA helicases in vitro (4Tanner N.K. Linder P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 251-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). In particular, eucaryotic initiation factor-4A and the p68 DEAD box RNA helicase (p68) have been shown to catalyze the separation of short RNA duplexes in an ATP-dependent fashion in vitro (5Hirling H. Scheffner M. Restle T. Stahl H. Nature. 1989; 339: 562-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 6Rozen F. Edery I. Meerovitch K. Dever T.E. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1134-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). However, as extended and continuous double-stranded RNA molecules are rare and not of functional significance in biological systems, it is now assumed that DEAD box proteins, including p68, are involved in disintegration or rearrangement of RNA-protein interactions rather than in a processive RNA unwinding activity (7Jankowsky E. Gross C.H. Shumann S. Pyle A.M. Science. 2001; 291: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 8Linder P. Tanner N.K. Banroques J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 339-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 9Schwer B. Meszaros T. EMBO J. 2001; 19: 6582-6591Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it is now well established that DEAD box proteins participate in important biological processes that involve RNA interactions such as transcription, ribosome biogenesis, pre-mRNA splicing and editing, RNA export to the cytoplasm, translation, and RNA degradation (4Tanner N.K. Linder P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 251-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Moreover, nearly all RNA molecules tend to fall into kinetic traps, as they fold into their lowest energy structure by forming intramolecular double helices (10Treiber D.K. Williamson J.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Thus, the physiologic functions of RNA helicases might even be important in more general terms, as they might serve as RNA chaperones that facilitate the formation of correct RNA structures by prevention or reversal of misfolded states (11Herschlag D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20871-20874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Regarding the important functions that are assigned to RNA helicases, it is not surprising to recognize a strong conservation of p68 protein during evolution. Human and murine p68 proteins share a 98% identity (12Lemaire L. Heinlein U.A. Life Sci. 1993; 52: 917-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and even the Saccharomyces cerevisiae p68 homologue Dbp2p exhibits a 55% identity to the human protein. Moreover, protein function appeared to be even more conserved, as S. cerevisiae DBP2 null cells can be rescued by the human p68 protein (13Iggo R.D. Jamieson D.J. MacNeill S.A. Southgate J. McPheat J. Lane D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1326-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 14Barta I. Iggo R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3800-3808Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, information that connects the knowledge of p68 in vitro functions to physiological or pathophysiological conditions in vivo is rather unsatisfactory. Serum inducibility of p68 in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts indicated a functional clue to cellular proliferation (15Stevenson R.J. Hamilton S.J. MacCallum D.E. Hall P.A. Fuller-Pace F. J. Pathol. 1998; 184: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, expression levels of p68 protein did not always correlate to the proliferation status in adult tissue, although there is evidence that p68 expression is connected to organ differentiation and maturation of the fetus (15Stevenson R.J. Hamilton S.J. MacCallum D.E. Hall P.A. Fuller-Pace F. J. Pathol. 1998; 184: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Additionally, p68 has been demonstrated to be overexpressed in nuclei of epithelial cells under hyperproliferative conditions of colorectal adenocarcinoma (16Causevic M. Hislop R.G. Kernohan N.M. Carey F.A. Kay R.A. Steele R.J.C. Fuller-Pace F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7734-7743Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In this study, we have identified p68 as a novel NO-regulated gene in skin keratinocytes. Additionally, we found keratinocyte p68 expression to be induced by growth factors and cytokines that control keratinocyte movements in the context of cutaneous wound healing. Within the repair process, a controlled but strong proliferation of wound margin keratinocytes drives the re-epithelialization of the wounded area. Here we demonstrate that p68 is regulated during skin repair and that p68 is functionally connected to keratinocyte proliferation and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 1The abbreviations used are: VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; FCS, fetal calf serum; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GSNO, S-nitrosoglutathione; HEK, human embryonal kidney cells; IFN, interferon; IL, interleukin; KGF, keratinocyte growth factor; p68, p68 DEAD box RNA helicase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; SpNO, spermine-NONOate; TGF, transforming growth factor; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; ANOVA, analysis of variance; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; iNOS, inducible nitric-oxide synthase; nt, nucleotides; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SOD, superoxide dismutase; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; ORF, open reading frame.1The abbreviations used are: VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; FCS, fetal calf serum; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GSNO, S-nitrosoglutathione; HEK, human embryonal kidney cells; IFN, interferon; IL, interleukin; KGF, keratinocyte growth factor; p68, p68 DEAD box RNA helicase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; SpNO, spermine-NONOate; TGF, transforming growth factor; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; ANOVA, analysis of variance; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; iNOS, inducible nitric-oxide synthase; nt, nucleotides; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SOD, superoxide dismutase; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; ORF, open reading frame. expression in the cells. Animals—Female C57BLKS mice were obtained from Charles River Breeding Laboratories (Sulzfeld, Germany). Female C57BLKS-iNOS-/- mice were the generous gift of G. Geisslinger, Frankfurt, Germany. Mice were maintained under a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle at 22 °C until they were 8 weeks of age. At this time they were caged individually, monitored for body weight, and wounded as described below. Wounding of Mice—Wounding of mice was performed as described previously (17Stallmeyer B. Kämpfer H. Kolb N. Pfeilschifter J. Frank S. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1999; 113: 1090-1098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 18Frank S. Stallmeyer B. Kämpfer H. Kolb N. Pfeilschifter J. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2002-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with a single intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (80 mg/kg body weight)/xylazine (10 mg/kg body weight). The hair on the back of each mouse was cut, and the back was subsequently wiped with 70% ethanol. Six full-thickness wounds (5 mm in diameter, 3–4 mm apart) were made on the back of each mouse by excising the skin and the underlying panniculus carnosus. The wounds were allowed to form a scab. Skin biopsy specimens were obtained from the animals 5, 10, and 16 h, or 1, 3, 5, 7, and 13 days after injury. At each time point, an area which included the scab, the complete epithelial and dermal compartments of the wound margins, the granulation tissue, and parts of the adjacent muscle and subcutaneous fat tissue was excised from each individual wound. As a control, a similar amount of skin was taken from the backs of nonwounded mice. For each experimental time point, tissue from four wounds each from four animals (n = 16 wounds, RNA analysis) and from two wounds each from four animals (n = 8 wounds, protein analysis) were combined and used for RNA and protein preparation. Nonwounded back skin from four animals served as a control. All animal experiments were carried out according to the guidelines and with the permission from the local government of Hessen (Germany). Identification of p68 from a PCR-based Differential HaCaT Keratinocyte cDNA Library—Quiescent human HaCaT keratinocytes were stimulated for 5 h with 500 μm S-nitroso-glutathione (GSNO). After the incubation period, total cellular RNA from NO-stimulated and nonstimulated control cells was isolated as described below. A PCR-based differential cDNA library was generated from the RNAs by using the PCR-Select™ cDNA subtraction kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Recombinant bacterial clones were identified by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-Gal) co-incubation and subsequently grown overnight in 384-well plates. Equal amounts of the overnight bacterial suspension were spotted onto nylon membranes in duplicate and grown on the filters for 6–8 h at 37 °C. A differential colony screening was then performed using standard protocols. We used a [α-32P]dCTP-labeled reverse-transcribed cDNA as a probe, which has been generated from poly(A+) mRNA isolated from GSNO-treated and control cells. RNA Isolation and RNase Protection Analysis—RNA isolation and RNase protection assays were carried out as described previously (18Frank S. Stallmeyer B. Kämpfer H. Kolb N. Pfeilschifter J. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2002-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 19Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63088) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μg of total RNA from wounded or nonwounded skin was used for RNase protection assays. DNA probes were cloned into the transcription vector pBluescript II KS (+) (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) and linearized. An antisense transcript was synthesized in vitro by using T3 or T7 RNA polymerase and [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol). RNA samples were hybridized at 42 °C overnight with 100,000 cpm of the labeled antisense transcript. Hybrids were digested with RNases A and T1 for 1 h at 30 °C. Under these conditions, every single mismatch was recognized by the RNases. Protected fragments were separated on 5% acrylamide, 8 m urea gels and analyzed by using a PhosphorImager (Fuji, Straubenhardt, Germany). RNases A and T1 were from Roche Applied Science. The murine cDNA probes were cloned using RT-PCR. The probes corresponded to nt 551–785 (for murine p68, GenBank™ accession number NM_007840) or nt 163–317 (for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, GenBank™ accession number NM_002046) of the published sequences. For detection of the human p68 transcript, the identified sequence was used (nt 1891–2161 of the published sequence, GenBank™ accession number NM_004396). Preparation of Protein Lysates and Cell Fractionation—Skin and cell culture samples were homogenized in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% aprotinin, 15 μg/ml leupeptin). The extracts were cleared by centrifugation (17Stallmeyer B. Kämpfer H. Kolb N. Pfeilschifter J. Frank S. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1999; 113: 1090-1098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 20Kämpfer H. Kalina U. Mühl H. Pfeilschifter J. Frank S. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1999; 113: 369-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To obtain nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of cultured cells and wound tissues, samples were homogenized in lysis buffer (1×, without Triton). Cellular fractions were generated by a single centrifugation step at 100,000 × g for 60 min with an Optima TLX Ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments, München, Germany). Protein concentrations were determined by using the Roth Nanoquant Protein Assay (Bradford method). Immunoblot Analysis—Fifty to hundred μg of total protein from skin, cellular lysates, or cell fractionates was separated by using SDS-gel electrophoresis. After transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, p68 protein was subsequently detected by using a polyclonal antibody generated against human p68. The anti-p68 antibody has been generated in rabbits using a specific peptide sequence (H2N-FNTFRDRENYDRGY-COOH) that allows immunodetection of both human and murine p68 protein. The monoclonal antibody against murine nucleolin and the polyclonal antibody against human proliferating cell nuclear antigen were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Heidelberg, Germany). The anti-GFP antibody was from Roche Applied Science. A secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase and the ECL detection system were used to visualize the proteins of interest. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, and leupeptin were from Sigma or Roche Applied Science. The ECL detection system was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—Quantification of VEGF protein from keratinocyte culture supernatants was performed by using the VEGF glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase Quantikine ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Immunohistochemistry—Mice were wounded as described above. Animals were sacrificed at day 5 after injury. Nonwounded mice were sacrificed to isolate control skin tissue. Nonwounded control skin and complete wounds were isolated from the back, bisected, and frozen in tissue-freezing medium. Six μm of frozen sections were subsequently analyzed using immunohistochemistry as described previously (17Stallmeyer B. Kämpfer H. Kolb N. Pfeilschifter J. Frank S. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1999; 113: 1090-1098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Antiserum against p68 was used for immunodetection. Cell Culture—Quiescent human HaCaT (21Boukamp P. Petrussevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (3440) Google Scholar) and murine PAM 212 epidermal keratinocytes were stimulated with GSNO (250 and 500 μm), spermine-NONOate (SpNO, 250 μm), EGF (10 ng/ml), TGF-α, (10 ng/ml), fetal calf serum (FCS, 10%), KGF (10 ng/ml), and with a combination of cytokines (2 nm IL-1β, 2 nm TNF-α, 100 units/ml IFN-γ). Murine primary keratinocytes were purchased from CELLnTEC Advanced Cell Systems AG (Bern, Switzerland) and cultured in CnT-02 medium (CELLnTEC, Bern, Switzerland). Murine primary keratinocytes were stimulated with GSNO (500 μm) and TGF-α (10 ng/ml). GSNO and SpNO were obtained from Alexis Corp. (Grünberg, Germany), and growth factors and cytokines were purchased from Roche Applied Science, and FCS was from Invitrogen. Generation of p68 Overexpressing Keratinocyte Cell Lines—The human p68 RNA helicase cDNA (GenBank™ accession number NM_004396) was amplified from HaCaT keratinocytes using 5′-CCA TGT CGG GTT ATT CGA GTG ACC-3′ as a 5′-primer and 5′-GTC TTA TTG GGA ATA TCC-3′ as a 3′-primer and cloned into the EcoRV restriction site of the pBluescript II KS(+) vector (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany). To verify the correct sequence, both strands were sequenced. Subsequently, the p68 RNA helicase cDNA was subcloned into the pcDNA3.1(+) expression vector (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). HaCaT keratinocytes were transfected using the pcDNA3.1(+)-p68 cDNA construct. Stable p68 overexpressing cell lines were obtained by selection using geneticin (1 mg/ml) for 6 weeks. Subsequently, clones were isolated, subcultured, and tested for p68 overexpression by immunoblot. HaCaT control cell lines were generated by stable transfection of the pcDNA3.1(+) vector. Geneticin was from Invitrogen. Transfection Experiments—For transient transfection experiments, 2 × 105 cells (HaCaT, human embryonal kidney cells (HEK)) were plated and grown for 24 h to reach 50–80% confluency. The DNA (5 μg) or small interfering RNA (siRNA,1 μg) of interest and the LipofectAMINE reagent (10 μl) were diluted in 250 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The diluted DNA-liposome complex was added for 3 h. Following this incubation, cells were grown for 24 h in normal growth medium, harvested, and analyzed. Silencing p68 Expression by siRNA—p68-specific siRNA was generated by Qiagen-Xeragon (Hilden, Germany) using AACCGCAACCATTGACGCCAT (nt 152–172, GenBank™ accession number NM_004396) as the cDNA target sequence. The delivered siRNA duplex sequence was formed by the sense 5′-CCGCAACCAUUGACGCCAUdTdT-3′ and antisense 5′-AUGGCGUCAAUGGUUGCGGdTdT-3′ oligonucleotides. As a control, a nonsilencing siRNA duplex with symmetric 2-nt 3′overhangs of the cDNA target sequence 5′-AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT-3′ was used. This sequence only matched with a sequence derived from Thermotoga maritima. The sense oligonucleotide was coupled to rhodamine to assess transfection efficiencies. Transfection of cells (HaCaT, HEK) was performed as described above. In Vitro Transcription/Translation—For in vitro transcription/translation of the p68 cDNA from the pcDNA3.1(+) vector, the TNTR Coupled Reticulocyte System (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) and [35S]methionine were used. The assay was performed as described by the manufacturer. Generation of p68-Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) Fusion Construct—The human p68 cDNA excluding the stop codon was subcloned from the pBluescript II KS(+) into the HindIII/NheI restriction sites of pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech). Confocal Microscopy—Confocal microscopy was performed using the Zeiss LSM 510 META microscope (Carl Zeiss, München, Germany) equipped with a 405 nm laser for 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole/blue (emission at 458 nm), a 488 nm laser for GFP/green (emission at 520 nm), and a 543 nm laser for CY3/red (emission at 633 nm). To assess expression of p68-GFP fusion protein, transfected cells were fixed (0.2% (w/v) EDTA in methanol) at -20 °C for at least 1 h. For indirect immunofluorescence, cells were incubated with bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml in PBS) for 1 h to block nonspecific binding sites. Incubation with the nucleolin-specific antibody (1:100 in PBS/bovine serum albumin) was done at 4 °C overnight. After a final wash with PBS/bovine serum albumin, the FluoroLink™ Cy™3-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (1:2000) (Amersham Biosciences) was added for 1 h, and DNA was stained with 4,6-diamino-2-phenylinole (1:1000, 5 min) (Sigma). Preparations were mounted with ProLong Antifade kit (Molecular Probes, Germany). Proliferation Assay—0.5 × 105 cells (HaCaT keratinocytes or cell lines) per well were seeded into 24-well plates. After reaching 50% confluence, cells were transfected with siRNA specific for p68. Transfected cells or cell lines were starved for 24 h with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Proliferation of cells was assessed using 1 μCi/ml of [3H]methylthymidine in the presence or absence of serum for 24 h. After 24 h, cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated in 5% trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C for 30 min, and the DNA was solubilized in 0.5 m NaOH for 30 min at 37 °C. Finally, [3H]thymidine incorporation was determined. Statistical Analysis—Data are shown as means ± S.D. Data analysis was carried out using the unpaired Student's t test with raw data. Statistical comparison between more than two groups was carried out by analysis of variance (ANOVA, Dunnett's method). Identification of p68 as a Novel NO-regulated Gene in Keratinocytes—It is now well established that the short lived radical NO pivotally drives epithelial movements and gene expression during skin repair (22Frank S. Kämpfer H. Wetzler C. Pfeilschifter J. Kidney Int. 2002; 61: 882-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To gain a deeper insight into NO actions on keratinocyte behavior, we established a differential cDNA library from NO-stimulated HaCaT keratinocytes. Screening of duplicate filters with radioactive-labeled cDNAs from GSNO- and nontreated HaCaT cells identified a bacterial clone that carried a cDNA fragment from a potentially NO-inducible transcript (Fig. 1a). After propagation of the identified clone, isolation of the plasmid, and subsequent sequence analysis, we found a 270-bp cDNA fragment with a 100% nucleotide homology to human p68 DEAD box RNA helicase (p68, GenBank™ accession number NM_004396). As a next step, we had to confirm the potency of NO to induce p68 expression in keratinocytes. To this end, we stimulated quiescent HaCaT keratinocytes using different NO-donating substances. Indeed, we could detect a marked and dose-dependent induction of p68 mRNA expression in the cells (Fig. 1, b and c). Induction of p68 mRNA was followed by a strong increase in p68 protein in NO-induced cells (Fig. 1d). More important, induction of p68 expression was not restricted to GSNO alone, as additional NO-donating agents such as SpNO (Fig. 1d, lower panel) and nitroprusside (data not shown) mediated comparable effects on p68 expression. As a next important step, we tested the specificity of our anti-p68 antiserum, which we had raised in rabbits using a p68-specific peptide sequence. For this reason, we cloned the cDNA of the p68 open reading frame (ORF) into the eucaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1(+) (Fig. 2a). First, we performed an in vitro transcription/translation assay in the presence of [35S]methionine. Exposure of the corresponding radiolabeled gel revealed the presence of two major bands, from which one clearly represented the expected 68-kDa protein. Moreover, as we transferred the transcription/translation reaction to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for immunoassay, we could clearly demonstrate the specificity of the p68 antibody that detects a 68-kDa protein and also the second band, which is most likely to represent an incomplete translation product (Fig. 2b). Additionally, we detected strongly increased levels of p68 in pcDNA3.1-p68-ORF transiently transfected human embryonal kidney (HEK) cells (Fig. 2c) and stably transfected HaCaT keratinocyte cell lines (Fig. 2d).Fig. 2Specificity of the anti-p68 antiserum. A polyclonal antiserum against p68 protein was raised in rabbits. a, to verify the specificity of the antiserum, the full-length p68 cDNA was cloned into pcDNA3.1(+). b, SDS-gel electrophoresis of the in vitro transcription/translation reaction of p68 cDNA using the pcDNA3.1(+) construct and [35S]methionine (left panel).

Transiently transfected HEK cells (HEK-p68) were used as a control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) p68 Expression Is Induced by Growth Factors, Serum, and Cytokines—As we are especially interested in keratinocyte movements in the context of skin repair, we now investigated the potency of those mediators to regulate p68 expression that are well established to drive keratinocyte actions during healing in vivo (23Martin P. Science. 1997; 276: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar, 24Werner S. Grose R. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 835-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (2572) Google Scholar). Notably, the potent keratinocyte mitogens EGF (Fig. 3a), TGF-α (Fig. 3b), serum (Fig. 3c), and also KGF (Fig. 3d) were potent inducers of p68 expression in cultured HaCaT cells. Most interestingly, the increase in p68 protein expression was long lasting for all growth factors tested, as we found still elevated p68 levels after 48 h of stimulation (Fig. 3, a–d). Additionally, also a mixture of pro-inflammatory cytokines clearly induced p68 expression in HaCaT keratinocytes (Fig. 4), although p68 protein levels declined earlier when compared with growth factor-stimulated cells. It is known for some time that a mixture of cytokines also induces iNOS expression in keratinocytes (25Frank S. Kolb N. Werner E.R. Pfeilschifter J. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1998; 111: 1065-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 26Frank S. Kämpfer H. Podda M. Kaufmann R. Pfeilschifter J. Biochem.

We also reported that the expression of basal integrin α2 and its biological effects are critically controlled by the constitutive activation of the ERK/MAPK pathway (Sawhney, R. S., Sharma, B., Humphrey, L. E., and Brattain, M. G. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 19861–19869). In the present report, we further examine the downstream signaling mechanisms underlying EGFR/ERK signaling and integrin α2 function in HCT116 cells. Selective MEK inhibitors attenuated TGFα-mediated basal activation of p70S6K (S6K) specifically at Thr-389, indicating that this S6K site is downstream of ERK/MAPK signaling. Cells were treated with the selective protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide to determine the role of PKC in S6K activation. The Thr-421 and Ser-424 phosphorylation sites of S6K were specifically inhibited by bisindolylmaleimide, which also blocked integrin α2 expression, cell adhesion, and motility. These data establish a novel cell motility function of S6K via PKC activation in a cancer cell. In addition, we examined whether mammalian target of rapamycin signaling controls S6K activation. Rapamycin inhibited constitutive S6K phosphorylation specifically at Thr-389, Thr-421, and Ser-424 sites. The assignment of these phosphorylation sites on S6K to biological functions was unequivocally confirmed by transfection of cells with specific single phosphorylation site dominant negative mutants.

Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar). The activation of S6K is complex and is associated with a series of phosphorylation events. Ribosomal S6K has multiple phosphorylation sites dispersed throughout the molecule. Classically, S6K is an activator of ribosomal protein S6, a component of the 40 S subunit of eukaryotic ribosomes (2Nemenoff R.A. Price D.J. Mendelsohn M.J. Carter E.A. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19455-19460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Proud C.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 181-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 4Pullen N. Thomas G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). S6K is known to increase the translation of mRNA exhibiting unique 5′-terminal oligopyrimidine sequences in the 5′-untranslated region. Because these mRNAs encode ribosomal proteins, they contribute to the enhanced global translational capacity of cells (5Volarevic S. Thomas G. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 65: 101-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The S6K enzyme plays an important role in protein synthesis and cell growth control, since S6K knockout mice showed significantly reduced body sizes (6Kawasome H. Papst P. Webb S. Keller G.M. Johnson G.L. Gefland E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5033-5038Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 7Shima H. Pende M. Chen Y. Fumagalli S. Thomas G. Kozma S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6649-6659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, S6K has been shown to function as a dual pathway kinase, signaling cell survival as well as cell growth (8Harada H. Andersen J.S. Mann M. Terada N. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2001; 98: 9666-9670Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 9Balasubramanian S. Kuppuswamy D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42214-42224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, the role of S6K in cell adhesion, integrin expression, and cell motility is not clear. Integrins are heterodimers of α and β subunits expressed in a cell- and/or tissue type-specific manner on the cell surface. Integrins play an important role in cell differentiation, adhesion, and motility (10Juliano R.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 283-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Integrin α2β1 is formed by a noncovalent association of the α2 subunit as a monogamous partner to the promiscuous β1 subunit. Expression of integrin α2 is regulated during normal cell differentiation and is altered during tumorigenesis (11Klekotka P.A. Santoro S.A. Zutter M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9503-9511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Its synthesis is considerably reduced in poorly differentiated cells, like HCT116 carcinoma cells, and downregulation of integrin α2 in the colonic crypt may lead to a loss of cell-matrix binding and sloughing of cells (12Zutter M. Santoro S. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 137: 113-120PubMed Google Scholar). In human breast cancer, hepatocarcinoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma cells, the expression of integrin α2 has been correlated with metastatic behavior (13Yang C. Zeisberg M. Lively J.C. Nyberg P. Afdhal N. Kalluri R. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8312-8317PubMed Google Scholar, 14Paine E. Palmantier R. Akiyama S.K. Olden K. Roberts J.D. J. Biol.

Science. 1991; 251: 1600-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms involved in the transformation of a cell from nonmetastatic to metastatic are poorly understood, inhibiting or eliminating cellular motility will disrupt metastatic disease. We previously reported that in HCT116 cells, the biological responses of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mediated functions including mitogenesis, integrin α2 expression, cell adhesion, and cell micromotion depend on the degree of EGFR activation. For example, mitogenesis is saturated by autocrine levels of activation, whereas cell matrix functions occur at autocrine levels of activation and continue to increase with increasing EGFR activation (17Sawhney R.S. Zhou G.-H.K. Humphrey L.E. Ghosh P. Kreisberg J.I. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 75-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To further elucidate the mechanism(s) of integrin α2 expression and its biological functions in HCT116 cells, we reported the critical role of extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK/MAPK) signaling downstream of the EGFR-mediated pathway (18Sawhney R.S. Sharma B. Humphrey L.E. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19861-19869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the present report, we further elaborate downstream signaling mechanisms responsible for integrin α2 functions in HCT116 cells. An important finding in this study is that autocrine TGFα-induced S6K activation at specific phosphorylation sites in HCT116 cells is dependent upon multiple signaling pathways and ultimately mediates control of cell adhesion functions as a result of the activation by these pathways. One upstream pathway involves the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway that utilizes Thr-389, and the other is the PKC signaling pathway, which utilizes Thr-421/Ser-424 sites. Further, these sites are inhibited by the immunosuppressive macrolide rapamycin, a selective inhibitor of FKBP and rapamycin-associated protein (FRAP)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. The assignment of specific phosphorylation sites of S6K to cell adhesion functions was confirmed by ectopic expression of single site-specific dominant negative mutants to Thr-389, Thr-421, and Ser-424, respectively. The present data provide new insight into the complex signaling mechanism(s) by which autocrine TGFα may contribute to the metastatic and invasive behavior of highly aggressive human colon cancer cells.

In brief, ∼1 × 106 cells were seeded in 100-mm tissue culture dishes in serum-free medium 3 days before transfection and changed to supplemental McCoy's medium on the third day. HCT116 cells were transiently transfected either with empty vector or with various constructs at a 4:1 ratio of FuGENE to plasmid DNA. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested by trypsinization and used in cell adhesion, cell micromotion, and cell lysates analyzed for integrin α2 and S6K protein expression. The transfection efficiency using enhanced green fluorescent protein plasmid was about 50%. Cell Culture and Adhesion Assay—These experiments were performed as described previously (17Sawhney R.S.

HCT116 cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 in a chemically defined serum-free medium consisting of either McCoy's 5A medium or supplemented with 4 μg/ml transferrin and 20 μg/ml insulin, either in the absence or presence of EGF (10 ng/ml), depending upon experimental design. For adhesion assays, 96-well tissue culture plates were coated for 2 h at 37 °C with CN IV at concentrations of 0–0.25 μg/ml, blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin for 3 h, and then rinsed once with PBS. Subsequently, the MTT procedure was followed using HCT116 or S6K mutant-transfected HCT116 cells as described previously (17Sawhney R.S. Zhou G.-H.K. Humphrey L.E. Ghosh P. Kreisberg J.I. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 75-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). After trypsinization, cells were incubated at 37 °C with inhibitors for 2–3 h to determine cell adhesion functions. Cells were plated at 6 × 104 cells/well on CN IV-coated plates and incubated for 90 min in the absence or presence of MEK inhibitors PD098059 and U0126 or Me2SO as a control. Nonadherent cells were removed by washing three times with serum-free medium. The relative number of attached cells was determined by the MTT method. All inhibitors were dissolved in Me2SO as stock solutions and diluted at the time of experiment. Cell Lysates, Biotinylation, and Immunoblotting—The procedures were the same as described previously (17Sawhney R.S. Zhou G.-H.K. Humphrey L.E. Ghosh P. Kreisberg J.I. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 75-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, subconfluent cultures of HCT116 or S6K mutant-transfected HCT116 cells were treated either with Joklik's EDTA for 8 min or trypsinized for 3 min at room temperature, and cells were then scraped and pelleted by centrifugation in a clinical centrifuge for 3 min at 800 × g. The pellet was washed twice with cold PBS, and cells were biotinylated in suspension with N-hydroxysuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido) hexanoate (NHS-LC-Biotin) (Pierce), 0.1 mg/ml in Me2SO at room temperature for 1 h. The biotinylated cells for integrins were washed with PBS and lysed in buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, and a mixture of protease inhibitors), sheared through a 26-gauge needle, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. Equal amounts of protein from treated and untreated (control) cell lysates were incubated with streptavidin agarose for 90 min at 4 °C. Agarose beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 4 °C and then washed five times with lysis buffer containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The beads were boiled in 2× Laemmli buffer containing 4% β-mercaptoethanol for 10 min, and supernatant was filtered through Bio-Rad columns and applied in 7.5% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond). The membrane was blocked for 2–3 h with 5% nonfat dry milk in Triton/Tris-buffered saline (TTBS) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with appropriate primary antibody. For certain primary antibodies, the membranes were blocked with bovine serum albumin (5%) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing the membrane with TTBS, it was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit or mouse secondary antibody. The membrane was washed, and detection of specific binding was achieved by using enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For Western blot analysis of cell signaling proteins, biotinylation of cells was omitted, and proteins were separated by 7% SDS-PAGE.

In the present system (model 1600R), HCT116 cells or S6K mutant transfectants were plated at 6 × 104 cells/well on small gold electrodes (diameter 250 μm) at the bottom of tissue culture wells (area 0.5 cm2), and culture medium was used as the electrolyte (23Giaever I. Keese C.R. Nature. 1993; 366: 591-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 24Giaever I. Keese C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7896-7900Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Four hundred fifty microliters of medium were used per well. An array consists of eight individual small electrodes, allowing up to 16 individual experimental conditions to be monitored simultaneously. A constant current source applies a noninvasive 1-μA, 4000-Hz AC signal between the small electrode and a much larger counter electrode (0.15 cm2). Any variation of current due to cell movement is recorded. The in-phase and out-of-phase voltage across the electrode were recorded by the lock-in amplifier once every second to measure micromotion and once every 2 min for measuring cell attachment. The ECIS software (Applied BioPhysics, Troy, NY) calculated the resistance and capacitance values of the electrode over this period of time. Attachment and movement of the cells on the electrode changed the flow of the current, resulting in fluctuations in the electrode resistance and capacitance. These cellular movements were called micromotion (24Giaever I. Keese C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7896-7900Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar) and were a measure of the motile ability of the cell being examined. As the cells moved on the electrode, the sensitive nature of the lock-in amplifier detected the fluctuations in the resistance and capacitance values (25Giaever I. Keese C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3761-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). These fluctuations were then analyzed statistically using ECIS software to reveal the percentage variation in resistance, which in turn was a reflection of cellular micromotion on the electrode. Because large changes occur in resistance with cell movement, the results of experiments are presented as percentage variations in resistance rather than in capacitance. Since the measurements are electrical, they are quantitative and generate data that can readily be analyzed to provide sensitive measurements of changes in cell behavior. MEK Inhibitors Affect Autocrine Activation of S6K at Specific Phosphorylation Sites—Previously, we showed that in HCT116 cells, basal ERK/MAPK activation was under the control of autocrine TGFα (18Sawhney R.S. Sharma B. Humphrey L.E. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19861-19869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We now determined whether the activation of S6K, a downstream enzyme mediated by the EGFR/ERK/MAPK signaling pathway in these cells, is controlled by autocrine TGFα. Various phosphorylation sites of S6K were mapped for activation by autocrine TGFα. We found that endogenously Thr-389, Thr-421, and Ser-424 sites were specifically activated by TGFα-mediated multiple signaling pathways emanating from activated EGFR. Western blot analyses of cell lysates with specific phospho-primary antibodies did not show inhibition of the basal activation of S6K at the Ser-411 phosphorylation site by MEK inhibitors PD098059 or U0126 in the absence of exogenous growth factor (Fig. 1A). This demonstrates that endogenous S6K activation at Ser-411 is not under the control of basal ERK/MAPK signaling. However, it is noteworthy that when HCT116 cells are exposed to EGF (10 ng/ml), which saturates the EGFR, and then treated with MEK inhibitors, S6K activation at Ser-411 is inhibited in a concentration-dependent fashion (Fig. 1B). MEK inhibitor U0126 showed higher inhibitory effects on the activation of S6K at Ser-411 than did PD098059. Earlier we reported similar results in that MEK inhibitor U0126 was more potent in the inhibition of ERK activation (18Sawhney R.S. Sharma B. Humphrey L.E. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19861-19869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Mapping of the other phosphorylation sites activated by autocrine TGFα revealed that U0126 inhibited the Thr-389 (Fig. 1C) but not the Thr-421 and Ser-424 sites of S6K (Fig. 1D). In the presence of EGF, however, U0126 inhibited Thr-421/Ser-424 phosphorylation sites of S6K similarly to the Ser-411 site (Fig. 1E). These results demonstrate that MEK inhibitors affect activation of S6K at specific phosphorylation sites as a function of whether S6K is activated by autocrine versus exogenous growth factor. The experiments described above also confirm that S6K is downstream of the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway. Exogenous EGF Activates S6K at Ser-411 in a Temporal Fashion—To determine whether exogenous EGF directly activates S6K at Ser-411, HCT116 cells were treated with the growth factor (10 ng/ml) for 0–40 min. The activation of S6K at Ser-411 was rapid and time-dependent (Fig. 2). Enhanced phosphorylation of S6K was seen as early as 3 min and started declining after 5 min. The higher phosphorylation at 40 min as compared with initial activation indicated a biphasic pattern of phosphorylation of S6K in HCT116 cells. Under identical conditions, the same pattern was observed for ERK activation (Fig. 2, middle panel). Recently, Lehman et al. (26Lehman J.A. Calvo V. Gomez-Cambronero J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28130-28138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) reported a biphasic activation of S6K by macrophage colony-stimulating factor in neutrophils. Rapamycin Does Not Influence Activation of S6K at Ser-411— S6K signaling is complex, since this enzyme can be activated by different pathways. Therefore, we also examined the role of FRAP/mTOR signaling in the control of autocrine S6K activation in HCT116 cells. To determine whether the autocrine activation of S6K is mediated by FRAP/mTOR, HCT116 cells were treated with rapamycin in the absence or presence of exogenous EGF. Immunoblotting with a specific phosphomonoclonal antibody revealed that rapamycin did not inhibit activation of S6K at Ser-411 in the absence of exogenous EGF (Fig. 3A). This showed that the autocrine activation of S6K at Ser-411 by autocrine TGFα in HCT116 cells is not mTOR-dependent. The addition of exogenous growth factor in the culture medium activated Ser-411, and cells responded to rapamycin (Fig. 3B). Mapping of Thr-389, Thr-421, and Ser-424 Phosphorylation Sites of S6K with Rapamycin—The enzyme S6K is known to have several phosphorylation sites, some of which are sensitive to rapamycin (4Pullen N. Thomas G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Therefore, in addition to Ser-411, we mapped the sensitivity of the other phosphorylation sites (Thr-389, Thr-421, and Ser-424) to inhibition of mTOR. HCT116 cells were treated with low concentrations of rapamycin in the absence or presence of exogenous EGF. The cell lysates were examined by Western blot analysis using site-specific phospho-antibodies. Antibodies against Thr-389, Thr-421, and Ser-424 revealed that autocrine TGFα-mediated activation of these sites was inhibited by rapamycin (Fig. 3, C and E). These sites also responded to rapamycin in the presence of EGF (Fig. 3, D and F). Rapamycin Inhibits Cell Adhesion and Integrin α2 Expression—The data presented above show that autocrine TGFα-mediated mTOR signaling contributes to the phosphorylation of Thr-389 and Thr-421/Ser-424 sites of S6K. To determine whether activation of these sites is linked with cell adhesion function, HCT116 cells were treated either with Me2SO (control) or with rapamycin, and adhesion assays were performed as reported earlier (17Sawhney R.S. Zhou G.-H.K. Humphrey L.E. Ghosh P. Kreisberg J.I. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 75-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 18Sawhney R.S. Sharma B. Humphrey L.E. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19861-19869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Fig. 4A shows that rapamycin inhibited autocrine TGFα-mediated cell adhesion on CN IV by 58% (after subtracting bovine serum albumin values). These results show that specific phosphorylation sites of S6K contribute to cell adhesion via mTOR signaling. Inhibition of cell adhesion by rapamycin indicated that integrin α2, the receptor for CN IV, may be playing a role in cell adhesion. Therefore, we studied the effect of rapamycin on integrin α2 expression. Fig. 4B shows that rapamycin does attenuate endogenous expression of integrin α2 protein. Similarly, Fig. 4C shows inhibition of integrin α2 by rapamycin in the presence of exogenous EGF. These experiments directly link some or all of the Thr-389 and Thr-421/Ser-424 sites of S6K to integrin α2 functions in HCT116 cells. Characterization of Phosphorylation Site-specific S6K Mutants—HCT116 cells were transiently transfected with individual mutants T389A, T421A, and S424A as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using phospho-specific antibodies. The single mutants expressed protein and exhibited a dominant negative effect only for the respective mutated phosphorylation site of S6K, whereas other phosphorylation sites were not inhibited (Fig. 5). S6K Mutants T389A, T421A, and S424A Inhibit Cell Adhesion and Integrin α2 Protein Expression—The specific functions of S6K phosphorylation sites are largely uncharacterized. To further determine the specificity and importance of distinct sites in autocrine-mediated cell adhesion and integrin α2 expression, we tested single point mutants of S6K. HCT116 cells were transiently transfected with specific phosphorylation sitemutated S6K DNA constructs T389A, T421A, and S424A (19Romanelli A. Dreisbach V.C. Blenis J. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2080552861,"Although tightly regulated programmed cell death (apoptosis) possesses great importance for tissue homeostasis, several pathologic processes are associated with organ failure due to adversely activated cell apoptosis. Transient increase in apoptosis has been shown to cause organ damage during fulminant hepatitis B, autoimmune diseases, ischemia-reperfusion injury, sepsis, or allograft rejection. A defined and temporary inhibition of cell apoptosis may therefore be of high clinical relevance. Activation of death receptors results in caspase-8 recruitment to the death-inducing signaling complex, which initiates the apoptotic process through cleavage of caspase-8 and downstream substrates. This initial step may be inhibited by the caspase-8 inhibitor FLIP (FLICE inhibitory protein). To specifically inhibit the initiation of death receptor-mediated apoptosis we constructed a fusion protein containing FLIP fused N-terminally to the human immunodeficiency virus TAT domain. This TAT domain allows the fusion protein to cross the cell membrane and thus makes the FLIP domain able to interfere with the death-inducing signaling complex inside of the cell. We observed that incubation of lymphocytic Jurkat or BJAB cells with TAT-FLIPS proteins significantly inhibits Fas-induced activation of procaspase-8 and downstream caspases, preventing cells from undergoing apoptosis. Systemic application of TAT-FLIPS prolongs survival and reduces multi-organ failure due to Fas-receptor-mediated lethal apoptosis in mice. Therefore, application of cellular FLIPS in the form of a TAT fusion protein may open a promising, easily applicable new tool for providing protection against transient, pathologically increased apoptosis in various diseases.

Therefore, application of cellular FLIPS in the form of a TAT fusion protein may open a promising, easily applicable new tool for providing protection against transient, pathologically increased apoptosis in various diseases. Because of severe organ damage due to misregulated apoptosis in various diseases, intense studies have focused on apoptosis signaling pathways triggered by death receptors and their ligands including the Fas ligand, the tumor necrosis factor, and the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (1Peter M.E. Krammer P.H. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 2Wang S. El Deiry W.S.

Fas (APO-1/CD95) surface expression does not necessarily render cells susceptible to Fas ligand-induced apoptosis because of counteracting physiological cellular inhibitors. One of these regulators of death receptor-mediated apoptosis was termed FLIP 1The abbreviations used are: FLIP, FLICE inhibitory protein; cFLIP, cellular FLIP; FLIPS, short form (splice variant) of FLIP; DISC, death-inducing signaling complex; mAb, monoclonal antibody; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling. (for FLICE inhibitory protein), which is predominantly expressed in lymphoid tissues (4Krueger A. Schmitz I. Baumann S. Krammer P.H. Kirchhoff S. J. Biol.

Mattmann C. Rimoldi D. French L.E. Tschopp J. Nature. 1997; 388: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2231) Google Scholar). Cross-linking of Fas-sensitive cells by the Fas ligand or an agonistic antibody induces apoptosis through procaspase-8 recruitment to the Fas-mediated death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), where procaspase-8 is cleaved to initiate apoptosis through a systematic cleavage of downstream substrates. The recruitment of the caspase-8 inhibitor cFLIP into the DISC prevents the cleavage of procaspase-8, resulting in concomitantly reduced apoptosis (6Shu H.B. Halpin D.R. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1997; 6: 751-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Multiple splice variants of cFLIP have been reported, but to date only a long and a short form, designated cFLIPL and cFLIPS, respectively, could be detected on a protein level. It has been shown that, in the presence of cFLIPS, procaspase-8 is recruited into the DISC but remains unprocessed (7Rasper D.M. Vaillancourt J.P. Hadano S. Houtzager V.M. Seiden I. Keen S.L. Tawa P. Xanthoudakis S. Nasir J. Martindale D. Koop B.F. Peterson E.P. Thornberry N.A. Huang J. MacPherson D.P. Black S.C. Hornung F. Lenardo M.J. Hayden M.R. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 271-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Thus FLIPS appears to be a good candidate to block apoptosis in death receptor-mediated caspase-8 dependent pathways. In previous investigations it has been demonstrated that protein transduction is a powerful tool for introducing full-length proteins into cells without the help of viral or chemical transporters (8Green M. Loewenstein P.M. Cell. 1988; 55: 1179-1188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar, 9Fawell S. Seery J. Daikh Y. Moore C. Chen L.L. Pepinsky B. Barsoum J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). The principle of protein transduction originates from the biology of various viruses. In vivo analysis of the transduction properties of the HIV TAT domain demonstrated that almost all cells within the body, even those protected by the blood-brain barrier, were targeted by TAT fusion proteins after intraperitoneal application (10Schwarze S.R. Ho A. Vocero-Akbani A. Dowdy S.F. Science. 1999; 285: 1569-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). Transient blockage of apoptosis may be useful in clinical settings in which the initiation of death receptor-mediated apoptosis is the main pathogenic principle, such as certain forms of acute liver failure (11Ogasawara J.

In this context, the aim of this study was to transiently inhibit the Fas-mediated activation of initiator procaspase as a key regulator step in apoptosis by protein transduction of FLIPS and to restrain death receptor-mediated apoptosis in mice. Cloning and Expression of TAT-FLIPS—Total RNA was isolated from human peripheral blood lymphocytes by using RNeasy mini-columns (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The short form of human FLIPS cDNA was generated by using the ThermoScript reverse transcriptase PCR system (Invitrogen) with the forward (5′-CAAGCCATGGCTGCTGAAGTCATCCATCAGGTTGAA-3′) and reverse (5′-CCGCTCGAGTCACATGGAACAATTTCCAAGAATTTTCA-3′) primers. The pTAT vector (generous gift of S. F. Dowdy) has an N-terminal His6 leader followed by the 11-amino acid TAT protein transduction domain and a polylinker (16Nagahara H. Vocero-Akbani A.M. Snyder E.L. Ho A. Latham D.G. Lissy N.A. Becker-Hapak M. Ezhevsky S.A. Dowdy S.F. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1449-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). The PCR product was cloned into NcoI/XhoI-cut pTAT vector. A TAT construct containing the FLIP domain mutated within the death effector domain (named TAT-ΔFLIPS) served as a specific negative control that lacks the ability to protect against Fas-induced apoptosis. The plasmid was generated by site-directed mutagenesis within the first death effector domain of FLIP. Therefore, the amino acids RFD at the positions 64-66 of cFLIP (17Garvey T.L. Bertin J. Siegel R.M. Wang G.H. Lenardo M.J. Cohen J.I. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) were replaced by AAA using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The complementary oligonucleotides 5′-CTCTACAGAGTGAGGGCGGCCGCCCTGCTCAAACGTATC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GATACGTTTGAGCAGGGCGGCCGCCCTCACTCTGTAGAG-3′ (reverse) were used for the desired mutation. The underlined sequences were the replaced amino acids. The resulting constructs of a selected colony harboring the cDNAs of TAT-FLIPS as well as control plasmids TAT-ΔFLIPS and pTAT-β-galactosidase (the latter one kindly provided by S. F. Dowdy) were transformed into competent Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3)pLysS bacteria, followed by the induction of expression in Luria-Bertani media with 500 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After 3 h of incubation at 37 °C, cells were harvested by centrifugation (6,5000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) followed by sonification in binding buffer (500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, and 5 mm imidazole, pH 7.9). The suspensions were clarified by centrifugation (14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C), and the supernatants containing TAT proteins were purified under native conditions using pre-equilibrated nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid columns (Qiagen). To remove the high background of contaminating bacterial proteins, columns were washed by the stepwise addition of increasing imidazole concentrations. Finally, the target proteins were eluated with an elution buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, and 100 mm imidazole (pH 7.9). The removal of salt was performed using a disposable PD-10 (Sephadex G-25) desalting column equilibrated in an RPMI medium. The fusion proteins were either used immediately after purification or stored at 4 or -80 °C. Cell Culture and in Vitro Apoptosis Analysis by DNA Fragmentation Assay and Annexin V Staining—The human T lymphocytic Jurkat cells and the human B-cell line BJAB (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin-streptomycin. For experiments, the cells were seeded at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells/ml. An investigation of anti-Fas-induced apoptosis was performed by preincubation of cells with a TAT fusion protein (500 nm) for 30 min prior to the addition of 100 ng/ml anti-Fas antibody (clone 7C11, Immunotech, Marseille, France) for the indicated times (Fig. 1). Stimulations were terminated by aspirating the medium and washing five times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The rate of apoptosis was analyzed by a DNA fragmentation assay using the diphenylamine reagent. Briefly, cells were harvested by centrifugation, lysed in a buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mm Tris, pH 8, and 20 mm EDTA for 30 min on ice and centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 × g to separate DNA fragments (supernatants) from intact chromatin (pellets). Subsequently, each DNA sample in the supernatant and the pellet was precipitated in 10% trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C overnight and quantified using a diphenylamine reagent after hydrolysis in 5% trichloroacetic acid at 95 °C for 15 min. The percentage of fragmented DNA in each sample was calculated as the amount of DNA in the supernatant divided by the total DNA for that sample (supernatant plus pellet). Significance was assessed by a two-way analysis of variance followed by a Fisher's protected least significant difference (PLSD) test and was assumed statistically significant for p values < 0.05. In other experiments, apoptosis was quantified by Annexin V staining and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. After 4 h of stimulation the cells were harvested, washed with RPMI supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum, and Annexin V staining (ApoAlert, Annexin VFITC, BD Biosciences) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescence was analyzed by an EPICS XL® (Coulter, Krefeld, Germany). Flow cytometry data were analyzed using the EPICS System II software. Cell Lysis and Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed in modified ice-cold Frackelton cell lysis buffer (18Krautwald S. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5874-5879PubMed Google Scholar). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). Protein concentration was determined (Bradford method) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). Equal protein amounts (20 μg/lane) were resolved on 15% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) for immunoblotting. Western blots were performed using a polyclonal anti-FLIP NT antibody (Biomol, Hamburg, Germany), a polyclonal anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibody (Asp-175), or a monoclonal anti-caspase-8 antibody (1C12, both from BioLabs, Frankfurt, Germany), respectively, and horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibody (both from Promega), respectively. Immune complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Induction and Analysis of Anti-Fas-mediated Apoptosis in Vivo— Female Balb/c mice were obtained from Charles River (Sulzfeld, Germany) and used for experiments at 6-8 weeks of age. Apoptosis was induced by intraperitoneal injection of the monoclonal agonistic anti-Fas antibody Jo-2 (1 μg/g body weight; BD Biosciences). For survival studies, different groups of mice (five animals per group) were composed and received vehicle, TAT-ΔFLIPS alone, anti-Fas mAb Jo-2 alone, or in combination with either TAT-FLIPS or TAT-ΔFLIPS. Injection of 100 μg TAT-FLIPS or vehicle was performed intraperitoneally 1 h prior to and 4 h after application of the Jo-2 mAb. Experiments were performed at least in duplicate. A part of the mice were sacrificed 8 h after the application of Jo-2 mAb to excise the liver and small intestine for histological and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) analyses to determine the extent of apoptosis. For an investigation of histology, hematoxylin-stained cryosections (5 μm) were used. Sections of liver and small intestine were acetone-fixed, stained for 7 s with hematoxylin, and examined by light microscopy at 200× magnification for liver sections and 100× magnification for small intestine sections by an experienced pathologist. Apoptotic cells were identified in acetone-fixed liver sections (5 μm) using TUNEL analysis (TMR red in situ cell death detection kit; Roche Applied Science). Staining was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. TUNEL-positive cells were then imaged by fluorescent microscopy at 400× magnification. Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst (Hoechst number 33258; Sigma). Statistics—Statistical evaluation of actual survival of mice was performed using the log rank test. The SPSS program version 11.0.1 for MS Windows was used. To inhibit Fas-mediated apoptosis by recombinant FLIP we generated a protein containing FLIPS fused to the TAT domain of the human immunodeficiency virus. cDNA coding for the short form (splice variant) of FLIP, designated FLIPS, was cloned into a pTAT bacterial expression vector that contains a N-terminal TAT protein transduction domain leader followed by a polylinker (19Becker-Hapak M. McAllister S.S. Dowdy S.F. Methods. 2001; 24: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 20Vocero-Akbani A. Lissy N.A. Dowdy S.F.

Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 290-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). To demonstrate the biological effect specifically mediated by the FLIP domain of TAT-FLIP, we used a TAT fusion protein containing a mutated form of FLIP that lacks the binding properties of the death effector domain 1 as a further control (TAT-ΔFLIPS) (17Garvey T.L. Bertin J. Siegel R.M. Wang G.H. Lenardo M.J. Cohen J.I. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). TAT-FLIPSIs Readily Transduced into Lymphocytic Cell Lines—To address the transduction efficiency of the recombinant protein, we incubated lymphocytic cell lines with TAT-FLIPS or TAT-ΔFLIPS, respectively. Fig. 1A shows that the recombinant TAT-FLIPS is readily detectable in the cells as shown by Western blot analysis of cell lysates from Jurkat cells. Within 5 min of incubation TAT-FLIPS could be detected in whole cell lysates by immunoblotting using an anti-FLIP antibody. After 2 h the concentration of intracellular TAT-FLIPS decreased, and after 4 h intracellular TAT-FLIPS was hardly detectable. There was substantially no difference between TAT-FLIPS and TAT-ΔFLIPS. These data are consistent with the kinetics of TAT-β-galactosidase and other TAT proteins published (22Barka T. Gresik E.W. van Der N.H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2000; 48: 1453-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 23Cao G. Pei W. Ge H. Liang Q. Luo Y. Sharp F.R. Lu A. Ran R. Graham S.H. Chen J. J.

Endogenous FLIP could not be detected either in Jurkat or in BJAB cells (data not shown) using Western blot analysis, indicating that the concentration of both intracellular TAT-FLIPS and TAT-ΔFLIPS exceeds the endogenous FLIP multiple. Fig. 1B demonstrates that the protein transduction of TAT-FLIPS is concentration-dependent. TAT-FLIPS could be detected weakly in a Western blot if used in a final concentration of ∼25 nm and reached a plateau at concentrations of 500 nm. Control fusion protein TAT-ΔFLIPS showed equal concentration dependence. For the following experiments we therefore chose 500 nm as a suitable concentration and 30 min of incubation time to deliver sufficient amounts into the cells in order to observe potential anti-apoptotic effects. TAT-FLIPSProvides Protection from Fas-mediated Apoptosis in Vitro—To analyze the biological potency of transduced recombinant TAT-FLIPS, the inhibition of apoptosis in Jurkat and BJAB cell lines induced by the anti-Fas antibody was examined after incubation with TAT-FLIPS as well as with the control proteins TAT-ΔFLIPS or TAT-β-galactosidase (Fig. 2). After 4 h of treatment of Jurkat cells with an agonistic anti-Fas mAb, the rate of apoptotic cells was significantly reduced from 35.1 ± 8.2% (anti-Fas mAb only) to 4.5 ± 3.2% if the cells were preincubated with TAT-FLIPS and reached levels of spontaneously occurring apoptosis in untreated cells (2.5 ± 0.8%) as determined by Annexin V staining. In cells pretreated with TAT-ΔFLIPS, a protection against α-Fas-induced apoptosis was not present (36.2 ± 6.8%) (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2B confirms the significant reduction of apoptosis in both Jurkat and BJAB cells using a diphenylamine assay if the cells were treated with TAT-FLIPS before the induction of apoptosis with an agonistic α-Fas mAb (7C11). The control proteins TAT-ΔFLIPS or TAT-β-galactosidase exhibited no protective effect on anti-Fas antibody-induced apoptosis. Fig. 2C shows that the anti-apoptotic effect of TAT-FLIPS is concentration-dependent, reaching significance if used at 100 nm or higher in a diphenylamine assay. Anti-apoptotic Effect of TAT-FLIPSIs Mediated by the Inhibition of Caspase Activation—To determine which part of signal transduction is blocked by TAT-FLIPS in Fas-mediated apoptosis, we analyzed events downstream in death receptor-mediated apoptosis. Caspases form a family of proteases that are necessary for the execution of apoptosis. They are synthesized as precursors and then activated by proteolytic cleavage. It has been shown that FLIP acts as an inhibitor of procaspase-8 activation (25Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2450) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows a time course of cleavage/activation of caspase-8 in Jurkat cells induced by an anti-Fas antibody. Cleavage of procaspase-8 can be demonstrated within 3 h after the induction of apoptosis. An increased concentration of the cleaved subunits of caspase-8 (p43/41 and p18) is visible in Western blot analysis 5 and 7 h after induction. If cells were preincubated with TAT-FLIPS, the cleavage of procaspase-8 could be completely blocked for at least 5 h. In cells that were exposed to anti-Fas mAb for 7 h in the presence of TAT-FLIPS, cleavage of procaspase-8 was still partially inhibited. Fig. 3B shows the time course of cleavage of downstream caspase-3 using an antibody that specifically recognizes cleaved forms of 19 and 17 kDa. In the same experimental situation, caspase-3 activation is comparably inhibited, and the time course is similar to that of caspase-8 inhibition. In accordance with the lack of protection against apoptosis shown in Fig. 2, TAT-ΔFLIPS did not block α-Fas-induced cleavage of caspase-8 and caspase-3 (Fig. 3, A and B). The inhibition of anti-Fas-mediated activation of caspase-8 by TAT-FLIPS is specific (Fig. 3C). Equimolar amounts of control fusion proteins exerted no inhibitory effect, indicating that the genuine FLIP domain itself is responsible for the demonstrated anti-apoptotic effects. TAT-FLIPSImproves the Survival of Mice in Fas-mediated Multi-organ Failure—We wanted to further test the potential anti-apoptotic properties of TAT-FLIPS in a well characterized mouse model in which induction of Fas-mediated apoptosis leads to multi-organ failure and death within hours (11Ogasawara J. Watanabe-Fukunaga R. Adachi M. Matsuzawa A. Kasugai T. Kitamura Y. Itoh N. Suda T. Nagata S. Nature. 1993; 364: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1815) Google Scholar). TAT-FLIPS was administered intraperitoneally into Balb/c mice 1 h before and 4 h after the injection of 1 μg/g body weight of anti-Fas mAb (Jo-2). The actual cumulative survival of mice receiving anti-Fas antibodies plus TAT-FLIPS was significantly better compared with mice receiving anti-Fas mAb alone (p < 0.01) (Fig. 4). 9 of 25 mice (36% ± 8.9%) receiving anti-Fas mAb and TAT-FLIPS survived >4 weeks, whereas all mice of the anti-Fas group died during the first 2 days. The mean survival time of mice treated with an anti-Fas mAb alone was significantly shorter compared with mice receiving additional TAT-FLIPS (mean survival 10 ± 3.4 h versus 19.2 ± 5.7 h; p < 0.01). However, a complete inhibition of apoptosis during the peak effect of TAT-FLIPS in the first 8 h after administration could not be achieved. None of the mice treated with TAT-FLIPS or TAT-ΔFLIPS alone showed any toxic effects. Because the hallmark of the model used is multi-organ failure, mice from each treatment group were sacrificed 8 h after the induction of apoptosis. Macroscopically obvious differences were found predominantly in the gross appearance of livers and intestine (Fig. 5A). Livers of mice that were treated with anti-Fas mAb showed a dark red-brown color with a rather deliquescent organ texture, whereas the intestine appeared red and contracted with small hemorrhages. In contrast, those changes were scarcely visible in mice that had received both TAT-FLIPS and anti-Fas mAb or were not detectable in untreated control mice. Mice treated with TAT-ΔFLIPS and anti-Fas mAb showed the same intra-abdominal appearance as anti-Fas mAb-treated mice. Other organs like heart, spleen, kidneys, lungs, and brain showed no gross difference (data not shown). Histological examinations of liver sections correlated well with these observations. TUNEL staining revealed a decrease in the number and intensity of apoptotic cells in animals that received both TAT-FLIPS and anti-Fas mAb when compared with anti-Fas mAb-treated animals. However, the number of TUNEL-positive cells was still lowest in mice that have received the vehicle only. Thus, TUNEL staining confirmed a partial inhibition of anti-Fas-induced liver cell apoptosis by TAT-FLIPS (Fig. 5B). Fig. 5C shows representative sections of small intestine stained with hematoxylin. Areas with the pronounced macroscopic differences described above were dissected showing a marked degradation of the luminal ends of villi detectable only in anti-Fas-treated mice. Inhibition of apoptosis prevents organ failure in a variety of pathological conditions associated with increased apoptosis. Sensitivity toward apoptosis can be modulated at different levels in the signaling pathway. Initiation of apoptosis is partially inhibited in mice deficient for the intact Fas receptor or its ligand. Those mice are protected from ischemia-reperfusion injuries to some extent (12Nogae S. Miyazaki M. Kobayashi N. Saito T. Abe K. Saito H. Nakane P.K. Nakanishi Y. Koji T. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1998; 9: 620-631PubMed Google Scholar, 13Jeremias I. Kupatt C. Martin-Villalba A. Habazettl H. Schenkel J. Boekstegers P. Debatin K.M.

Among the most potent inhibitors of caspase activation in the signaling cascade are endogenous proteins like Bcl-2, or Bcl-xL (26Tsujimoto Y. Shimizu S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Different approaches to the modulation of caspase activation have been investigated with the application of silencing RNA (27Zender L. Hutker S. Liedtke C. Tillmann H.L. Zender S. Mundt B. Waltemathe M. Gosling T. Flemming P. Malek N.P. Trautwein C. Manns M.P. Kuhnel F. Kubicka S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7797-7802Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), chemical compounds, or retroviral gene transfer. Each approach exhibited advantages and limitations. Therapeutic inhibition of apoptosis has to be transient, because long term inhibition of apoptosis by overexpression of inhibitory proteins was associated with the risk of malignancies, predominantly lymphoma (28Schattner E.J. Friedman S.M. Casali P. Autoimmunity. 2002; 35: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), as well as autoimmune diseases and other disorders (29Lorenz H.M. Herrmann M. Kalden J.R. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Investig. Suppl. 2001; 235: 16-26PubMed Google Scholar). To use an endogenous proteinergic inhibitor as a therapeutic tool, this inhibitor has to be under regulatory control and has to be introducible into a cell to act intracellularly. In the present study, recombinant TAT-FLIPS proteins inhibited Fas-mediated activation of caspases and apoptotic cell death in vitro and in mice. FLIP was chosen because, in contrast to other inhibitors, it particularly provides the advantages of proximal action in the signal cascade. FLIP is recruited into the DISC by binding to the Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) and prevents the cleavage of procaspase-8 (4Krueger A. Schmitz I. Baumann S. Krammer P.H. Kirchhoff S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20633-20640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), which therefore may not initiate the caspase cascade. Of the two isoforms of FLIP that are known we used the short splicing variant FLIPS because the effect on apoptosis is contrarily discussed for the long form (30Lens S.M. Kataoka T. Fortner K.A. Tinel A. Ferrero I. MacDonald R.H. Hahne M. Beermann F. Attinger A. Orbea H.A. Budd R.C. Tschopp J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5419-5433Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). FLIPS exerts only anti-apoptotic effects (31Krueger A. Baumann S. Krammer P.H. Kirchhoff S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8247-8254Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). To introduce FLIP into the cells we fused FLIPS genetically to the N-terminal protein transduction domain of human immunodeficiency virus TAT. The TAT domain allows proteins to pass the intact cell membrane, a method that was demonstrated as offering rapid introduction of a variety of full-length proteins into primary and transformed cells in vitro and in vivo (20Vocero-Akbani A. Lissy N.A. Dowdy S.F. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 508-521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Vocero-Akbani A. Chellaiah M.A. Hruska K.A. Dowdy S.F. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 332: 36-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In this study we show that Fas-induced apoptosis was inhibited in a time- and dose-dependent manner by TAT-FLIPS. This effect could be addressed to the inhibition of caspase-8 activation during the first 5 h after the induction of apoptosis, and it could be demonstrated to be specifically mediated by the FLIP domain because the control TAT fusion proteins did not provide protection against apoptosis. The observed decrease in inhibitory activity is due to rapid intracellular degradation of TAT-FLIPS. Intracellular degradation has been shown for other TAT fusion proteins with some variation. For example, TAT-FNK, is intracellularly active for 2 h (33Asoh S. Ohsawa I. Mori T. Katsura K. Hiraide T. Katayama Y. Kimura M. Ozaki D. Yamagata K. Ohta S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 17107-17112Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), whereas galactosidase activity could be detected for >20 h after the application of TAT-β-galactosidase (22Barka T. Gresik E.W. van Der N.H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2000; 48: 1453-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). After fusing an active protein domain with a TAT-domain, the specific activity on a molar basis may not be comparable with the parental protein. Concentrations of other apoptosis-inhibitory TAT fusion proteins are reported to range from 0.3 pm TAT-FNK (33Asoh S. Ohsawa I. Mori T. Katsura K. Hiraide T. Katayama Y. Kimura M. Ozaki D. Yamagata K. Ohta S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 17107-17112Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) to 50 μm TAT-BH4 (34Shimizu S. Konishi A. Kodama T. Tsujimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3100-3105Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) to warrant inhibitory effects in vitro. In our study, the sufficient concentration of TAT-FLIPS for anti-apoptotic effects was 500 nm. Because of the specific activity in vitro and the lack of visible side effects of TAT-FLIPS, we used up to 10 mg/kg body weight fusion protein for the experiments in mice. So, taken together, the stability and the dose effects of our TAT-FLIPS were within the previously published range of other TAT fusion proteins. Although the principle of TAT-mediated protein transfer was discovered more than 15 years ago (35Frankel A.D. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1988; 55: 1189-1193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2353) Google Scholar), there is only a very limited number of investigations in which TAT-proteins were used in vivo. Schwarze et al., was the first to demonstrate in mice that intraperitoneally applied denatured TAT-β-galactosidase is taken up in a biologically active form by nearly all cells and organs and may even cross the blood-brain barrier (10Schwarze S.R. Ho A. Vocero-Akbani A. Dowdy S.F. Science. 1999; 285: 1569-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). These experiments proved the principle of a new form for applying drugs, active proteins, or DNA into nearly all organs (36Morris M.C. Depollier J. Mery J. Heitz F. Divita G. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 1173-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar, 37Wadia J.S. Dowdy S.F. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2002; 13: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 38Snyder E.L. Dowdy S.F. Curr. Opin. Mol. Ther. 2001; 3: 147-152PubMed Google Scholar). However, only recently a few reports exploited protein transduction for therapeutic use in clinical relevant disease models in mice. Some groups reported the partial protection of local cerebral ischemia by the anti-apoptotic protein TATBcl-xL and a mutated variant of it, TAT-FNK, respectively (23Cao G. Pei W. Ge H. Liang Q. Luo Y. Sharp F.R. Lu A. Ran R. Graham S.H. Chen J. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5423-5431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Asoh S. Ohsawa I. Mori T. Katsura K. Hiraide T. Katayama Y. Kimura M. Ozaki D.

Cell Neurosci. 2002; 21: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Similar results could be shown when using a different fusion protein (TAT-GDNF) in a similar mouse model for local cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (40Kilic U. Kilic E. Dietz G.P. Bahr M. Stroke. 2003; 34: 1304-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Myou et al., used protein transduction technology for a different clinical topic(41Myou S. Zhu X. Myo S. Boetticher E. Meliton A.Y. Liu J. Munoz N.M. Leff A.R. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 4379-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). They transduced a dominant negative Ras in a mouse asthma model, which resulted in inhibition of the airway inflammatory response by cytokine blockade (41Myou S. Zhu X. Myo S. Boetticher E. Meliton A.Y. Liu J. Munoz N.M. Leff A.R. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 4379-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We used a mouse model in which all of the mice died after antibody-mediated activation of Fas due to multi-organ failure. TAT-FLIPS protected 36% of the mice from death and delayed lethal multiple organ failure in all others. In addition, in the liver and the gut the protective effect of TAT-FLIPS has been demonstrated histologically. The effect was dose-dependent and time-limited. As mentioned, Fas-mediated apoptosis contributes to organ failure not only during ischemia-reperfusion injuries but also after certain infections like fulminant hepatitis B or intoxication and liver failure due to acute alcohol hepatitis or paracetamol intoxication (42Ryo K. Kamogawa Y. Ikeda I. Yamauchi K. Yonehara S. Nagata S. Hayashi N. Am. J. Gastroenterol. 2000; 95: 2047-2055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Tagami A. Ohnishi H. Moriwaki H. Phillips M. Hughes R.D.

Inhibition of apoptosis has not been included in the therapeutic repertoire of those diseases yet. Probably the most effective way to introduce inhibition of apoptosis into the clinic is to use more than one principle and more than one inhibitor, of which TAT-FLIPS could be one."

From their primary structures, these enzymes have been classified into glycosyl hydrolase family 13 (1Henrissat B. Biochem.

This digestion process is important for glucose absorption from the intestine to the blood, and in principle, control of HPA activity can be used as a means of controlling blood glucose levels. In fact, HPA activity has been correlated to post-prandial blood glucose levels (17Jenkins D.J. Taylor R.H. Goff D.V. Fielden H. Misiewicz J.J. Sarson D.L. Bloom S.R. Alberti K.G.

Diabetes Care. 1982; 5: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and inhibitors of α-amylase have been successfully used in the treatment of diseases such as diabetes or obesity where control of the blood glucose level is essential (20Bailey C.J. Chem. Ind. 1998; : 53-57Google Scholar). Arguably, the most studied inhibitor of α-amylase is the naturally occurring and commercially available drug, acarbose (Fig. 2a), which has a Ki value in the low nanomolar range. This pseudo-tetrasaccharide is composed of a valienamine (unsaturated cyclitol) linked “α(1,4)” by an amine linkage to 6″-deoxy-maltotriose. The valienamine portion mimics the flattened sugar ring of the oxocarbenium ion-like transition state, whereas the exocyclic nitrogen places a proton acceptor in a position to interact with the acid/base catalyst at the active site. Indeed, with another family 13 enzyme, the CGTase from Bacillus circulans, this compound has been demonstrated to be a transition state analogue (21Mosi R. Sham H. Uitdehaag J.C.M. Ruiterkamp R. Dijkstra B.W. Withers S.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17192-17198Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). As would be expected, structural studies of acarbose bound to HPA and other family 13 glycosidases have shown the valienamine moiety binding to the -1 subsite (22Brayer G.D. Sidhu G. Maurus R. Rydberg E.H. Braun C. Wang Y.L. Nguyen N.T. Overall C.M. Withers S.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4778-4791Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), where sugar distortion takes place in the presumed catalytic mechanism. Interestingly, when acarbose is bound to HPA in this structure, it is modified by the enzyme through the addition of a maltosyl unit to the nonreducing end of the valienamine ring and the loss of a glucose moiety at the reducing end (Fig. 2a). The inhibitor therefore occupies all five subsites of HPA (–3 to +2). Similar, although not identical, modifications have also been seen in structural studies of other α-amylases in complexes with acarbose (6Brzozowski A.M. Davies G.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10837-10845Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 23Qian M.X. Haser R. Buisson G. Duee E. Payan F.

Davies G.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9099-9107Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Because increased subsite occupancy is often associated with an increase in the overall binding affinity of an inhibitor, such a modification presumably results in a tighter binding molecule. To date, however, beyond the crystallographic data for the complex, there has been no direct evidence for such a product being formed in solution with α-amylase. Despite the considerable interest in α-amylases, there are relatively few other known inhibitors of this group of enzymes. From kinetic and structural studies, one would expect that the greatest transformation of the substrate on going from the ground state to the transition state will take place on the sugar occupying the -1 subsite. As such, the interactions at the -1 subsite should be particularly optimized for transition state binding, and therefore transition state mimics should bind particularly well at this site. Because the active sites of other family 13 α-glucosidases are thought to be structurally similar to that of HPA, it is likely that transition state analogues of such enzymes will interact similarly with the -1 subsite residues of α-amylase. Furthermore, it seems reasonable that the affinity of the inhibitor would correlate, in part, with the number of subsites with which the compound interacts. Therefore, an α-glucosidase inhibitor extended on the reducing and/or nonreducing end by a malto-oligosaccharide so as to occupy the other subsites should make a good inhibitor of α-amylases. In the past, the main difficulty in testing this hypothesis has been in the synthesis of such extended α-glucosidase inhibitors, although some work to this end has been carried out (25Takada M. Ogawa K. Saito S. Murata T. Usui T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 508-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 26Takada M. Ogawa K. Murata T. Usui T. J. Carbohydr.

In this paper, we describe a method to extend α-glucosidase inhibitors in situ, both in solution and within α-amylase crystals, by co-addition of an activated substrate. In doing so, we have been able to show that a potent α-glucosidase inhibitor, d-gluconohydroximino-1,5-lactam (GHIL; Fig. 2b) (29Hoos R. Vasella A. Rupitz K. Withers S.G. Carbohydr. Res. 1997; 298: 291-298Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar), which is normally a poor HPA inhibitor, is converted into a useful inhibitor of HPA. Using this method, it should be possible to assay a wide range of known α-glucosidase inhibitors using a facile kinetic screen for HPA inhibition by the elongated species and then determine the structure of the elongated species crystallographically. All of the chemicals and buffer salts were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise specified. HPA was purified according to literature procedures (30Rydberg E.H. Sidhu G. Vo H.C. Hewitt J. Cote H.C.

Syntheses of 2,4-dinitrophenyl α-maltotrioside and 4′-O-methyl α-maltosyl fluoride (MeG2F) will be published elsewhere. General—All of the studies were carried out at 30 °C in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.9, containing 100 mm NaCl, unless otherwise described. Hydrolysis of CNP-G3 by HPA was monitored after the addition of enzyme by following the increase in absorbance at 400 nm using a Varian CARY 4000 spectrophotometer attached to a temperature control unit. The hydrolysis of G3F by HPA was monitored by following the increase in fluoride concentration upon the addition of enzyme using an ORION 96–04 combination fluoride electrode interfaced to a personal computer running the program LoggerPro (Vernier Software, Oregon). All analyses of the data were accomplished using the program Grafit 4.0.21 (34Leatherbarrow R.J. Grafit, 4.0.21 Ed. Erithacus Software Ltd., Staines, UK1998Google Scholar). Extension Kinetics and Product Analyses—Extension studies were accomplished by preincubating HPA with G3F (0.2 mm) and acarbose (180 nm), or G3F (0.4 mm) and GHIL (1 mm). After 1 h, the residual activity of HPA was measured by the addition of CNP-G3 and measuring the increase in absorbance at 400 nm. Control reactions were done in the absence of either the G3F or inhibitor. Product formation in the HPA-catalyzed reaction of G3F with GHIL was monitored by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis. G3F and GHIL were incubated with HPA (0.06 mg/ml) for 1 h at 30 °C in 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.9, containing 10 mm NaCl. A saturated solution of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in deionized water was used as the matrix. The sample and matrix solutions were mixed in a 1:20 ratio, and 1 μl of this sample was spotted on the target plate and dried in vacuo. The MALDI-TOF spectra were collected using a Voyager-DESTR (Applied Biosystems) mass spectrometer in reflectron mode with an acceleration voltage of 20 kV. Inhibition Kinetics—The Ki values and mode of inhibition were determined by measuring the rate of hydrolysis of either G3F (0.1225–2.45 mm) or CNP-G3 (0.5–2.0 mm) in the presence of a varying concentration of inhibitor (4–5 points). The data were fit using the program GraFit 4.0.21 (34Leatherbarrow R.J. Grafit, 4.0.21 Ed. Erithacus Software Ltd., Staines, UK1998Google Scholar) and plotted in the form of a Dixon plot (1/rate versus [inhibitor]) to allow visual inspection of the data. Enzymatic coupling of MeG2F (1.6 mg, 4.5 mmol) and GHIL (1.0 mg, 5.2 mmol) dissolved in 25 μl of 50 mm citrate buffer, pH 6.0, was accomplished by incubating the two compounds in the presence of CGTase (2.2 μl, 50 ng/ml) at 30 °C for 16 h. The reaction was monitored by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. After completion, the reaction mixture was freeze-dried, and the residue was purified by column chromatography using a water/acetonitrile solution as eluent (v/v, 1:4) to yield pure MeG2-GHIL in 70% yield (1.7 mg). Further characterization of the product was achieved after per-O-acetylation using acetic anhydride in pyridine overnight. The solvent was evaporated in vacuo, and the residue was dissolved in EtOAc. The solution was washed with aqueous HCl (1 m), saturated aqueous NaHCO3, and brine and then dried over MgSO4.

Crystals of HPA were grown using conditions previously described (22Brayer G.D. Sidhu G. Maurus R. Rydberg E.H. Braun C. Wang Y.L. Nguyen N.T. Overall C.M. Withers S.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4778-4791Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The HPA/GHIL inhibitor complex was prepared for structural analysis by soaking a HPA crystal in a solution containing 100 mm GHIL for 24 h. A crystal of HPA complexed with both GHIL and G3F was prepared by first soaking in a solution containing 100 mm GHIL for 2 h followed by a 1-h soak in a solution containing 100 mm G3F. A similar approach was used in the formation of the complex with GHIL and MeG2F. Diffraction data for all complex crystals were collected on a Mar345 imaging plate area detector system at 100 K using copper Kα radiation supplied by a Rigaku RU300 rotating anode generator operating at 50 kV and 100 mA. Intensity data were integrated, scaled, and reduced to structure factor amplitudes, with the HKL suite of programs (35Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Method Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38567) Google Scholar). Data collection statistics are provided in Table I. The crystals of all of the complexes were isomorphous with that of HPA alone (22Brayer G.D. Sidhu G. Maurus R. Rydberg E.H. Braun C. Wang Y.L. Nguyen N.T. Overall C.M. Withers S.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4778-4791Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and as such, this structure was used as the starting refinement model for these complexes. Refinement was carried out with the CNS software program (36Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In these analyses, cycles of simulated annealing, positional, and thermal B refinements were alternated with manual model rebuilding with O (37Jones T.A. Zhou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13010) Google Scholar). In the initial stages of this process, the complete polypeptide chain of the refinement model was adjusted based on a composite annealed omit map (with 3% of the residues omitted per segment). Subsequently, the complete polypeptide chain was examined periodically with Fo - Fc, 2Fo - Fc and omit difference electron density maps. Following the refinement of the polypeptide chain of HPA, bound inhibitor molecules were positioned on the basis of Fo - Fc difference electron density maps. For both complexes, protein and inhibitor atoms were then jointly refined to obtain the best overall fit. In addition, an N-acetylglucosamine moiety bound to the side chain of Asn461 was included in the structural model and refined accordingly. At this point, solvent molecules were identified from a further Fo - Fc difference electron density map and included in the refinement model based on the hydrogen bonding potential to protein atoms and the refinement of a thermal factor of <75 Å2. In a final phase, the protein, inhibitor, and solvent molecules were jointly refined to convergence. The final refinement statistics obtained are detailed in Table I.Table IStructure determination statisticsGHIL/HPAGHIL/G3F/HPAGHIL/MeG2F/HPAData collection parametersSpace groupP212121P212121P212121Unit cell dimensionsa52.852.352.2b68.968.667.4c132.4131.5130.2No. of unique reflections35,24934,12527,904Mean I/αIaThe values in parentheses refer to the highest resolution shell (2.02-1.95 or 1.97-1.90 Å)24.1 (6.3)27.6 (11.1)15.0 (6.4)MultiplicityaThe values in parentheses refer to the highest resolution shell (2.02-1.95 or 1.97-1.90 Å)6.4 (3.4)9.8 (3.3)9.3 (2.1)Merging R-factor (%)aThe values in parentheses refer to the highest resolution shell (2.02-1.95 or 1.97-1.90 Å)6.2 (18.5)6.2 (18.0)4.8 (19.0)Maximum resolution (Å)1.951.901.95Structure refinement valuesNo. of reflections351553396627842Resolution range (Å)10.0-1.9510.0-1.9010.0-1.95Completeness within range (%)aThe values in parentheses refer to the highest resolution shell (2.02-1.95 or 1.97-1.90 Å)98.6 (96.9)89.9 (88.9)81.3 (80.2)No. of protein atoms394639463946No. of solvent atoms175161269Average B factors (Å2)Protein atoms20.420.219.8Solvent atoms29.329.824.6Final R-factor and R-free (%)b5% of the diffraction data was kept aside for the R-free16.7/19.817.5/19.518.3/22.7Structural stereochemistryRoot mean square deviationsBonds (Å)0.0070.0070.011Angles (°)1.31.31.4a The values in parentheses refer to the highest resolution shell (2.02-1.95 or 1.97-1.90 Å)b 5% of the diffraction data was kept aside for the R-free Open table in a new tab Kinetic Analyses—The concepts described herein first evolved out of our attempts to determine whether simple “monosaccharide” inhibitors of α-glucosidases would also function as useful inhibitors of HPA. As our best candidate, we investigated the potent α-glucosidase inhibitor GHIL (Ki = 2.9 μm with yeast α-glucosidase (29Hoos R. Vasella A. Rupitz K. Withers S.G. Carbohydr. Res. 1997; 298: 291-298Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar)). The assays were initially conducted with the substrate α-maltotriosyl fluoride (kcat = 200 s-1, Km = 0.5 mm) using a fluoride electrode. In this way, a Ki value of 1.8 mm was obtained. Although this inhibition is too weak to be therapeutically useful, it did suggest that this, and other such monosaccharides might be valuable inhibitors by providing a starting point for the design of extended and potentially more potent inhibitors that also occupy additional sugar binding subsites in the enzyme active site. Indeed, strong indications that elongation of these inhibitors with additional glucose residues might lead to substantial increases in affinity come from two findings. First, the kcat/Km values for oligosaccharide substrates were observed to significantly increase upon the addition of glucose moieties to the nonreducing end of a substrate. This points to substantial transition state stabilization from these additional sugar residues because the kcat/Km values increase from 98 s-1 mm-1 to 830 s-1 mm-1 on going from maltosyl fluoride to maltotriosyl fluoride (22Brayer G.D. Sidhu G. Maurus R. Rydberg E.H. Braun C. Wang Y.L. Nguyen N.T. Overall C.M. Withers S.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4778-4791Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Second, several studies have shown that oligosaccharide-based molecules are better inhibitors of the related porcine pancreatic α-amylase (25Takada M. Ogawa K. Saito S. Murata T. Usui T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 508-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 26Takada M. Ogawa K. Murata T. Usui T. J. Carbohydr. Chem. 1999; 18: 149-163Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 27Uchida R. Nasu A. Tokutake S. Kasai K. Tobe K. Yamaji N. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1999; 47: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To more easily assay α-amylase inhibitors, a simple, chromogenic assay involving the commercially available substrate, CNP-G3 (kcat = 1.9 s-1, Km = 3.6 mm) was employed. To our surprise, using this compound as a substrate, a Ki value of 18 mm was found for GHIL, which is 10-fold higher than that measured using G3F as substrate. This unusual behavior merited further analysis because other data ensured that this was not an “artifact” of kinetic analysis and that there was indeed a change in the apparent affinity of HPA for GHIL depending on the substrate. Supportive evidence for such a change in inhibitory activity is evident when assaying for HPA activity with CNP-G3 at higher concentrations of GHIL, when a time-dependent decrease in rate was observed over a period of 20 min. No such time-dependent decrease was observed in the absence of inhibitor, eliminating substrate depletion as the cause of this phenomenon. Preincubation of HPA with GHIL prior to measurement of activity with CNP-G3 did not decrease initial rates, thereby eliminating both covalent inactivation and slow on rates as possible causes of this behavior. The most likely explanation for both the difference in Ki values and the time-dependent behavior is that during the kinetic analysis of GHIL with CNP-G3, slow transglycosylation of a maltotriosyl moiety to GHIL is occurring. This would yield an elongated version of GHIL that binds much more tightly than the original molecule, analogous to what is presumed to occur in crystals of HPA soaked with acarbose. However, because G3F is a much better substrate for HPA than is CNP-G3 (kcat/Km value is 1800 times greater than for CNP-G3), the maltotriosyl moiety will likely be transglycosylated to the inhibitor at a higher rate when working with G3F compared with CNP-G3. If this were the case, the “steady state” concentration of elongated species is quickly reached and at higher levels when using G3F than when using CNP-G3, thereby accounting for the 10-fold lower Ki value determined. For the more slowly reacting CNP-G3, formation of the steady state concentration of the elongated species occurs more slowly and is seen instead as a slow decrease in the catalytic activity over time. To probe this hypothesis further, HPA was preincubated with GHIL (0.4 mm) and G3F (1 mm) for 15 min prior to assay using CNP-G3 (1 mm). If an extended inhibitor is formed, then HPA should be inhibited under these conditions, even if the assay is done with CNP-G3. The rate determined under these conditions was ∼25% of the rate of a control reaction in which HPA was preincubated with G3F or GHIL alone, strongly suggesting that HPA is catalyzing a reaction between the inhibitor and substrate and that the product of this reaction is a better inhibitor of HPA (Fig. 3). A preincubation experiment was also carried out with acarbose (180 nm) in place of GHIL and similar results obtained, with rates significantly dropping compared with those for the control reaction in which no acarbose was present (data not shown). Because structural studies have shown acarbose to form an elongated product in the presence of HPA, this result provides strong support for the idea that elongated inhibitors are the principal inhibitory species in the kinetic analysis using G3F. Notably, as one might expect from this hypothesis, preincubation of HPA with G3F and glucose did not result in a significant decrease in the rate of hydrolysis of the substrate (Fig. 3). An attempt was made to quantitate the change in inhibitory activity by measuring an apparent Ki value for the elongated inhibitor species formed during preincubation. The experiments carried out involved incubation of varying concentrations of GHIL (0–0.6 mm) with a fixed concentration of G3F (0.4 mm) and HPA. After 1 h of incubation at 30 °C, the HPA activity was measured using 2,4-dinitrophenyl maltotrioside (0.9 mm). Rates measured under these conditions were then plotted in the form of a Dixon plot (assuming the complete conversion of GHIL to a homogeneous inhibitory species), and an apparent Ki value of 265 μm was extracted from the intersection between this line and the horizontal line corresponding to 1/Vmax (where Vmax is the maximal rate of 2,4-dinitrophenyl α-maltotrioside hydrolysis in the presence of 0.4 mm G3F) (data not shown). In comparison with the Ki value of 18 mm determined for unmodified GHIL (no G3F preincubation), this Ki value represents an approximate 100-fold increase in affinity as a consequence of preincubation. The greater inhibition observed under these conditions than when assayed directly with G3F suggests that longer reaction times and/or higher concentrations of reactants are required to build up inhibitory concentrations, even with G3F. The Ki value determined, however, represents a “worst case” estimate of the true Ki value for the inhibitor because it assumes all of the inhibitor is converted to the tight binding version, which is highly unlikely, and which mass spectrometric analysis (see below) reveals not to be the case. The true Ki value must therefore be much lower. Mass Spectrometric Analysis—Initial attempts to observe an elongated GHIL species formed under the preincubation conditions discussed above by using a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer were unsuccessful. Only products of the normal hydrolysis and transglycosylation reactions of G3F were observed, possibly because the inhibitory species is being formed at concentrations well below the sensitivity level of the instrument. Concentrations of both G3F and GHIL were therefore raised such that G3F was present at 10 times its Km value, and GHIL was present at the Ki value of the unmodified species (18 mm). Analysis of such reaction mixtures by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry revealed two additional products of m/z 539 and 702. These masses correspond to the sodium adducts of GHIL linked to a maltosyl or maltotriosyl moiety, respectively (Fig. 4), thereby demonstrating that HPA will catalyze the elongation of GHIL. Synthesis of an Extended GHIL for Further Kinetic Studies—To demonstrate that elongated GHIL is a better inhibitor of HPA, an extended version of GHIL was synthesized using a chemo-enzymatic approach (Fig. 5). To simplify both the enzymatic synthesis and subsequent kinetic analysis of the elongated species, a “blocked” version was made in which the 4″-hydroxyl group at the nonreducing end was methylated. Such an inhibitor should not undergo further elongation at the 4″-position and therefore should remain a stable species during kinetic analysis. Synthesis of this MeG2-GHIL was achieved by incubating MeG2F overnight with GHIL in the presence of CGTase from B. circulans, which has been shown previously to be highly effective in transferring sugar moieties to monosaccharide analogues (27Uchida R. Nasu A. Tokutake S. Kasai K. Tobe K. Yamaji N. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1999; 47: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) without suffering the severe product inhibition that would be seen when using α-amylases. After the initial transglycosylation, the"

To determine whether the promoter contact must be released to make longer RNA products and at what position the promoter must be released, a mutant RNA polymerase was designed that allows cross-linking to a modified promoter via a covalent disulfide bond. The modifications individually have no measurable effect on transcription. Under oxidizing conditions that produce the protein-DNA cross-link, the complex is able to synthesize short RNA products, strongly supporting a model in which promoter contacts are not lost on translocation through at least position +6. However, cross-linked complexes are impaired in promoter escape in that only about one in four can escape to make full-length RNA. The remainder release 12- and 13-mer RNA transcripts, suggesting an increased energetic barrier in the transition from an initial transcribing complex to a fully competent elongation complex. The results are discussed in the context of a model in which promoter release helps drive initial collapse of the upstream edge of the bubble, which, in turn, drives initial displacement of the 5′-end of the RNA.

Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Because T7 RNA polymerase is a single subunit enzyme capable of carrying out the complete transcription cycle without additional protein cofactors, it is an ideal enzyme to study as a model. Like other DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, T7 RNA polymerase recognizes and binds promoter DNA, melts open an initiation bubble downstream of the promoter, and positions the initial templating bases in the active site to begin the process of transcription (4Gralla J.D.

After an initial abortive cycling phase characteristic of all RNA polymerases, the enzyme enters a more stable elongation phase after transcription of an ∼10–14-mer RNA product (6Mentesana P.E.

Previous studies have suggested that promoter release occurs near the position at which the enzyme switches to the more stable elongation phase, perhaps simultaneously (10Ikeda R.A. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3614-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Details concerning the timing and mechanism of promoter release, however, remain unclear. Several studies, including footprinting and fluorescence approaches (2Gunderson S.I. Chapman K.A. Burgess R.R.

During the early abortive cycling phase (at least until the polymerase reaches position +6), the promoter contacts remain intact as evidenced by footprinting, although there may be minor perturbations as evidenced by photo cross-linking studies (12Place C. Oddos J. Buc H. McAllister W.T. Buckle M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4948-4957Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It has also been clearly shown that these promoter contacts are released at some position beyond +6 and prior to +15 in the transcription cycle (2Gunderson S.I. Chapman K.A. Burgess R.R.

A. 1986; 83: 3614-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This phenomenon of maintaining promoter contacts until the polymerase reaches a more stable elongation phase is also characteristic of other polymerases (13Carpousis A.J. Gralla J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 183: 165-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 14Straney D.C. Crothers D.M. Cell. 1985; 43: 449-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The timing of promoter release corresponds well to an increase in the overall stability of the ternary complex. There are fewer abortive products released after translocation to position +10 and lower overall turnover values for complexes artificially stalled beyond position +8 (6Mentesana P.E. Chin-Bow S.T. Sousa R. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 1049-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Alternatively, on constructs where promoter release may be inhibited (nicked nontemplate strand or partial single-stranded promoters), an abundance of 12- and 13-mer products relative to runoff (full-length) products is observed (15Stano N.M. Patel S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 1009-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 16Jiang M. Rong M. Martin C. McAllister W.T. J. Mol.

Recent studies suggest that these 12- and 13-mer products may be the result of a failed bubble collapse at the start site. 1Gong, P., Esposito, E. A., and Martin, C. T. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 44277–44285.1Gong, P., Esposito, E. A., and Martin, C. T. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 44277–44285. We expect that bubble collapse and promoter release are coupled; the current study focuses on the latter. To determine the timing of promoter release or to ask whether promoter release is required for the formation of a stable elongation complex, we have designed a mutant T7 RNA polymerase (A94C) that allows us to reversibly cross-link the polymerase to its promoter DNA. The native alanine at position 94, shown in Fig. 1, is unconserved in the phage polymerases and lies near the 3′-hydroxyl of the adenine at position –17 of the promoter (3Cheetham G.M. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 18Dietz A. Weisser H.J. Kossel H. Hausmann R. Mol. Gen.

Replacement of this template strand 3′-hydroxyl by a phosphodiester alkyl thiol allows covalent cross-linking of promoter DNA to the protein. Under oxidizing conditions, we have been able to effectively cross-link 3′-thiol-modified promoter DNA to the protein, such that the complete loss of promoter contacts is impossible. This cross-linking should not impair the initial events of initiation that do not require promoter release. The results presented here confirm that cross-linking promoter DNA to the enzyme in its binding site has no effect on the synthesis of short products (≤6-mer), and although the complexes can escape to produce full-length runoff products, cross-linking of the promoter to the enzyme presents a new (or increased) energetic barrier leading to premature release of RNA at positions +12 and +13. Mutant Construction—An expression vector coding for the mutant polymerase (His-tagged A94C) was prepared by utilizing the Stratagene QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit. The parental plasmid was isolated from cells (pBH161/BL21) generously provided by W. T. McAllister. The oligonucleotide primers (5′-GACTGGTTTGAGGAAGTGAAATGTAAGCGCGGCAAGCGCCCG-3′ and its complement) directing the single amino acid mutation were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). The underlined region encodes the alanine (GCT) to cysteine (TGT) mutation. Candidate plasmids were sequenced to confirm the mutation and then transformed into BL21 cells. Mutant polymerase activity, which was the same as wild type, was assayed using methods described below. Protein Expression and Purification—His-tagged wild type and mutant T7 RNA polymerase were overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 and purified using Qiagen nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid as described (22He B. Rong M. Lyakhov D. Gartenstein H. Diaz G. Castagna R. McAllister W.T. Durbin R.K. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 9: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Protein purity (>95%) was determined by SDS-PAGE analysis. The purified protein was dialyzed against storage buffer (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 50% glycerol, and 1 mm Na2EDTA) and stored at –20 °C in the same buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). 2The abbreviation used is: DTT, dithiothreitol. Concentration was calculated from the measured absorbance at 280 nm (in the absence of DTT) using the molar extinction coefficient of 1.4 × 105m–1 cm–1 (23King G.C. Martin C.T. Pham T.T. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide Synthesis and Purification—Oligonucleotides were synthesized trityl-off using an Applied Biosystems Expedite 8909 DNA synthesizer, gel purified as described previously (24Perez-Howard G.M. Weil P.A. Beechem J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8005-8017Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), excised from the gel, and eluted using an Elu-Trap® device (Schleicher and Schuell Inc., Keene, NH). The DNA sequences encoding a 20-mer RNA are 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACCACAACGGTTTCC-3′ (nontemplate) and 3′-ATTATGCTGAGTGATATCCCTCTGGTGTTGCCAAAGG-5′ (template). A 3′ thiol-modified DNA template strand (HS–CH2–CH2–CH2–PO4–3′-template) and a 3′-biotinylated nontemplate strand were synthesized in a similar manner using either a 3′-thiol modifier or a 3′-biotin column (Glen Research, Sterling VA). Purified single strand DNAs were combined at equimolar concentrations, heated to 90 °C, and then cooled slowly to room temperature to anneal. Isolation of Cross-linked Complexes—To form initial cross-linked complexes by disulfide formation, solutions (200 μl) containing equimolar concentrations (1 μm) of T7 RNA polymerase (A94C) and 3′-thiolmodified, double-stranded DNA were run through a 1-ml Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 0.25 mm EDTA, 25 mm potassium glutamate, and 0.025% Tween 20. To facilitate complete cross-linking, samples were then incubated at 4 °C for 4–10 days with the tubes opened at least once daily to allow air exchange. In later experiments that attempted to ensure more complete cross-linking, protein concentration was increased relative to DNA in ratios of 4:1 and 10:1 prior to treatment with G-25 Sephadex spun columns. Even with these increased concentrations of protein there was significant loss of protein to the column material, presumably via nonspecific adsorption. These samples were used directly in transcription assays described later. To better isolate the cross-linked complex, subsequent experiments utilized DYNAL® Dynabeads® M-280 Streptavidin (Dynal Inc., Lake Success, NY) and biotinylated DNA. Cross-linked enzyme-DNA complexes, oxidized as described above in 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 0.25 mm EDTA, 25 mm potassium glutamate, and 0.5% glycerol (glycerol was substituted for Tween 20 because of the tendency of Tween 20 to form peroxides), were added to 25 μl of beads washed previously and equilibrated into the above buffer as described in the DYNAL protocol. The samples were then washed three times with 1× DYNAL binding and wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 m NaCl), transferred to clean Eppendorf tubes between washes to prevent residual protein contamination, and then re-equilibrated to 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 25 mm potassium glutamate, 0.25 mm EDTA, 0.5% glycerol, and 50 mm NaCl with two washes (see Fig. 5A for schematic representation of the isolation protocol). These samples, beads included, were used directly in the transcription assays described later. Control experiments substituted native protein for the A94C mutant and/or native DNA for the 3′-thiol-modified DNA. Transcription Assays—Transcription reactions were performed in a total volume of 20 μl at 37 °C for 10 min and quenched with an equal volume of stop solution (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 0.01% xylene cyanol). Equimolar concentrations of double strand DNA and enzyme were used at final concentrations of 0.2 μm in a reaction buffer containing 30 mm HEPES, pH,7.8, 25 mm potassium glutamate, 15 mm magnesium acetate, 0.25 mm EDTA, 0.5% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm freshly prepared DTT (absent in oxidized samples). Reactions were initiated by the addition of nucleoside triphosphates to a final concentration of 400 μm each and were labeled with 1 μCi of [α-32P]GTP. Transcription assays with samples on beads or samples run through the G-25 Sephadex spun columns were performed at 37 °C for 10 min and then quenched with an equal volume of stop solution. RNA products were separated on a 7 m urea, 20% polyacrylamide Tris-borate gel and quantified using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager as described previously (25Kuzmine I. Gottlieb P.A. Martin C.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2601-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Oxidation by Glutathione or Diamide—In some experiments, oxidized glutathione and 1,1′-azobis(N,N-dimethylformamide) (diamide) were utilized to ensure that any non-cross-linked complex was driven toward complete oxidation (26Schoneich C. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 27Kosower N.S. Kosower E.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that the disulfide cross-link was not reversibly exchanging, a 1-μl volume of 10 mm oxidized glutathione, 50 mm oxidized glutathione, and 10 mm diamide or double-distilled H2O (as a control) was added to 9 μl of bead-isolated, cross-linked complexes to increase the oxidizing strength of the buffer solution. Each sample was then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C before use in transcription assays as described above. Recent crystal structures of elongation complex models strongly support a mechanism for transcription in which enzyme-promoter contacts are completely lost on progression to an elongation complex (2Gunderson S.I. Chapman K.A. Burgess R.R. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1539-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 10Ikeda R.A. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3614-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 28Tahirov T.H. Temiakov D. Anikin M. Patlan V. McAllister W.T. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S.

To determine whether initial promoter contacts must be released when the enzyme switches to a more stable elongation complex, a mutant polymerase was designed that allows covalent cross-linking of the promoter DNA to the promoter binding region of the enzyme in the initially bound complex. There are three regions of the enzyme that make up the promoter binding domain as revealed by contacts seen in the DNA-bound crystal structures (3Cheetham G.M. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 21Cheetham G.M. Steitz T.A. Science. 1999; 286: 2305-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, these regions include the AT-rich recognition loop centered on Arg-96, the specificity loop (residues 745–759), and an intercalating loop centered on Val-237. Residue Ala-94, in the first of these regions, was chosen for mutation based on its close proximity to the 3′-hydroxyl of the adenosine at position –17 of the template strand DNA, its lack of contact with the DNA or the rest of the protein, its lack of conservation among the closely related phages T3, SP6, and K11 (18Dietz A. Weisser H.J. Kossel H. Hausmann R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 221: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 19Kotani H. Ishizaki Y. Hiraoka N. Obayashi A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 2653-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 20McGraw N.J. Bailey J.N. Cleaves G.R. Dembinski D.R. Gocke C.R. Joliffe L.K. MacWright R.S. McAllister W.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 6753-6766Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and biochemical evidence that minor changes in this region of the promoter DNA are reasonably tolerated (30Imburgio D. Rong M. Ma K. McAllister W.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10419-10430Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). 3F. Tanga, E. A. Esposito, and C. T. Martin, unpublished results. Template strand DNA was synthesized with a 3′-thiol modification so that it could be directly cross-linked via formation of a disulfide bond with Cys-94. We expected that cross-linking of the promoter DNA would allow normal initiation and initial translocation, whereas full run transcription would be eliminated because the enzyme would not be able to escape the promoter. Modifications Have No Effect on Transcription in the Absence of Cross-linking—To ensure that modification of the protein alone has no direct effect on transcription, we compared transcription assays with mutant A94C and wild type T7 RNA polymerase. In each case we used double-stranded DNA containing an upstream consensus promoter and a downstream sequence encoding a 20-mer runoff transcript. Results presented in lanes 3 and 4 of Fig. 2 show that, under reducing conditions, transcription from the mutant polymerase is essentially identical to that of wild type polymerase. Similarly, to ensure that adding a thiol group to the 3′-end of the template strand DNA has no detrimental effect on binding or on the ability of the enzyme to transcribe, we analyzed transcription by wild type T7 RNA polymerase on an identical DNA sequence containing a 3′-thiol on the template strand (see Fig. 2). As shown in lane 2 of Fig. 2, the addition of the 3′-thiol to the DNA has no effect on transcription. Finally, comparison of lanes 1 and 4 in Fig. 2 shows that under the normal reducing conditions of our assays, which should prevent formation of the disulfide, the combination of both A94C and the addition of a 3′-thiol on the DNA has no effect on transcription. In all cases, there is no significant difference in the amount of transcribed product using either enzyme, nor is there a difference in the product profile. Covalent Cross-linking Does Not Alter Short Product Synthesis—Because T7 RNA polymerase retains promoter contacts from binding through initial transcription (at least through position +6), it is expected that a cross-linked complex should initiate as well as or better than an uncross-linked complex and that translocation to at least position +6 should be unimpeded. To test this hypothesis, DTT was removed from solutions containing DNA and enzyme (as described under “Materials and Methods”) to drive the formation of a disulfide bond between the protein and the DNA. In a transcription assay with only GTP as the substrate on a promoter encoding GGGA at the start site, T7 RNA polymerase produces a range of poly(G) products up to ∼14 bases in length (8Martin C.T. Muller D.K. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3966-3974Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 25Kuzmine I. Gottlieb P.A. Martin C.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2601-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Because forward translocation is minimal in this system, it is a simple measure of initiation. As shown in Fig. 3, cross-linking the promoter to the enzyme has no effect on the enzyme's ability to synthesize poly(G) products. Similarly, in the presence of GTP and ATP on a promoter encoding the substrate-limited six-base product GGGAGA, there is no difference in the product profile (intensity differences between lanes are attributed to differences in concentrations after processing). With no change in the product profile (relative amounts of 3-mer or 4-mer to 6-mer) evident, we conclude that initiation and early transcription are not adversely affected by the covalent cross-linking of the promoter DNA to the enzyme. Cross-linked Complex Can Make Full Run Product—Based on earlier observations from both footprinting and fluorescence experiments, we predicted that restricting promoter release would allow the synthesis of only a 9-mer to 11-mer product. Footprinting experiments have shown that promoter release occurs at some time after the synthesis of a 6-mer product and before the synthesis of a 15-mer (2Gunderson S.I. Chapman K.A. Burgess R.R. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1539-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 10Ikeda R.A. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3614-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Similarly, we have shown that the initially melted bubble collapses after synthesis of a 8- to 9-base pair product, presumably concurrent with promoter release (11Liu C. Martin C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2725-2731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that locking the promoter onto the enzyme by covalently cross-linking the up-stream promoter DNA to the AT-rich recognition loop (a subdomain of the promoter binding region) would limit the length of the final product to an ∼10-mer RNA. The results presented in Fig. 4, however, indicate that the cross-linked complex is indeed able to synthesize a full-length runoff (20-mer) product. Although a full-length transcript is produced by the cross-linked complex, there is a substantial increase in the amount of 12- and 13-mer falloff products relative to the 20-mer runoff product. Under our current conditions, the control (uncross-linked) wild type DNA and protein produce 12- and 13-mer products at ∼8–10% each relative to the amount of 20-mer runoff product (Fig. 4, lane 3). In contrast, the cross-linked complex produces 12- and 13-mer products that are >200% the amount of the 20-mer product. The finding that these same short products are seen (at low levels) with the wild type enzyme and DNA suggests that they reflect an intrinsic barrier to escaping the promoter. Promoter release is likely to be that barrier. Covalent cross-linking of the DNA to the enzyme increases the probability that proper promoter release will not occur and, therefore, increases the amount of the short product generated. In this experiment, the cross-link was allowed to form via simple air oxidation (4 days at 4 °C) following removal of DTT with a G-25 Sephadex spun column. As a result, differences in the overall amounts of transcripts between lanes might arise from a loss of protein during oxidation and/or gel filtration. In these experiments we can also not be sure that the complexes are 100% cross-linked, such that the observed full-length runoff product might arise from a population of uncross-linked complexes. The following experiments address this uncertainty. Runoff Product Is Produced by Bona Fide Cross-linked Complexes—To better isolate cross-linked complexes, double-stranded DNA containing an upstream 3′-thiol group on the template strand and a downstream 3′-biotin moiety on the nontemplate strand was incubated with the mutant enzyme in the absence of DTT, as described above. The resulting cross-linked complexes were then captured using streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads. The beads were then washed using buffer containing 1 m NaCl to remove any non-covalently bound protein. After equilibrating the beads to transcription buffer, transcription assays performed directly from these beads showed ratios of 12- and 13-mer products relative to 20-mer products similar to those seen above (Fig. 5B). In a control experiment, wild type enzyme and DNA containing the downstream biotin but lacking the upstream 3′-thiol were incubated, captured, washed, and assayed as described above. No transcription was observed in this control, indicating efficient washing of the noncovalently bound enzyme from the DNA. The subsequent addition of free enzyme restored wild type levels of transcription, demonstrating that streptavidin-bound DNA was retained (data not shown). Finally, to ensure that the observed 20-mer transcript does not arise from complexes in which the cross-link has reversed, we employed glutathione and diamide to maintain complete oxidation (26Schoneich C. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 27Kosower N.S. Kosower E.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5C, the addition of glutathione to the bead-isolated cross-linked complex (to a final concentration of 1 mm) does not alter the percentage of 12- and 13-mer products relative to 20-mer, demonstrating that the 12-, 13-, and 20-mer products are being synthesized by fully cross-linked complexes. The addition of glutathione to 5 mm (not shown) or the addition of diamide (a stronger oxidizer) to 1 mm (Fig. 5C, lane 2) significantly reduces the overall activity of the protein. A similar reduction in activity is seen for a parallel treatment of the wild type enzyme, suggesting that under these stronger oxidizing conditions the native cysteines are forming nonnative cross-links, thus reducing the protein activity (not shown). Are All Complexes Coupled to Cys-94?—High salt washing of complexes containing the native alanine at position 94 and lacking a 3′-thiol on the DNA template led to a complete loss of transcription, demonstrating that noncovalently bound polymerase can be efficiently washed from the bead-DNA complex. This finding does not, however, preclude cross-linking of the modified DNA to any of the 12 native cysteine residues in T7 RNA polymerase. Although the native cysteine nearest the 3′-thiol is ∼24 Å distant (C216), a secondary control was run to address the possibility that wild type polymerase could be cross-linked to the thiol-modified DNA through one of these native cysteines. In the previous transcription assay the wild type enzyme was not completely washed away, as there was residual activity resulting in a faint band corresponding to 20-mer RNA (∼10% of that seen in the A94C control) and very weak bands corresponding to 12- and 13-mer RNAs (data not shown). Cross-linking of promoter DNA to any of the native cysteines would allow the RNA polymerase to survive the high salt challenge, but function with DNA would almost certainly happen in trans, as it should not allow correct positioning of the promoter on the protein to which it is cross-linked. If one enzyme can utilize DNA tethered to a separately tethered enzyme, one would expect that complex to be susceptible to free, competing promoter DNA. In contrast, complexes with DNA bound at Cys-94 can be expected to be resistant to such competition. Therefore, the addition of a promoter sink that binds but will not support transcription can distinguish between complexes cross-linked properly via Cys-94 in the promoter binding domain and those that are cross-linked to one of the native cysteines. Complexes cross-linked to Cys 94 should be resistant to the sink (a free sink promoter cannot effectively compete with a locally tethered promoter), whereas the complexes c"

https://openalex.org/W2000475852,"Efforts to identify the manner in which human choriogonadotropin (hCG) contacts lutropin receptors (LHR) have been stymied by the complex structure of the hormone and the likelihood that it contacts the receptor at multiple sites. During studies of hCG assembly in mammalian cells, we found that addition of a cysteine to the long disordered β-subunit COOH terminus (βCT) enabled it to become cross-linked by a disulfide to cysteines that are substituted for residues in loop α2 or in the α-subunit COOH terminus (αCT). This created a ""knob"" on the α-subunit at the location of the cysteine. Knobs of various sizes and charges were useful for probing surfaces of the α-subunit thought previously to contact the LHR. Attachment of the βCT to residues in loop α2 facing loops β1 and β3 reduced hormone activity only a few fold revealing that this surface does not participate in essential high affinity receptor contacts, a finding inconsistent with our earlier view of the hCG-LHR complex. In contrast, this approach showed that the opposite surface of loop α2 appeared to be nearer the receptor interface. Although attachment of knobs to portions of the αCT reduced hormone activity substantially, this finding was difficult to interpret. As discussed, this procedure should be adapted readily to other proteins and may facilitate the introduction of fluorophores, enzymes, or other reagents at specific sites on protein surfaces. It may also permit one to cross-link proteins or to obscure specific protein surfaces during the development of ""Trojan Horse"" therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2090427569,"Twenty residues of the human choriogonadotropin (hCG) β-subunit that are wrapped around α-subunit loop 2 like a “seatbelt” stabilize the heterodimer and enable the hormone to distinguish lutropin (LHR), follitropin, and thyrotropin receptors. The N-terminal portion of the seatbelt contains a small disulfide-stabilized loop needed for heterodimer assembly and is thought to mediate hCG-LHR interactions. To test the latter notion, we compared the LHR binding and signal transduction activities of hCG analogs in which the α-subunit C terminus (αCT) was cross-linked to residues in the small seatbelt loop. Analogs having an intersubunit disulfide between a cysteine in place of αCT residue αSer-92 and cysteines substituted for loop residues βArg-94, βArg-95, or βSer-96 had high activities in LHR binding and signaling assays despite the fact that both portions of the hormone are thought to be essential for hCG activity. Use of a larger probe blocked hormone activity when the αCT was cross-linked to cysteines in place of residues βArg-95 and βAsp-99, but not to cysteines in place of residues βArg-94, βSer-96, or βThr-97. This suggested that the side chains of residues βArg-95 and βAsp-99, which face in the same outward direction from the heterodimer, are nearer than the others to the LHR interface. The finding that residue 95 can be cross-linked to small αCT probes without eliminating hormone activity indicates its side chain does not participate in essential LHR contacts. We suggest that contacts between the small seatbelt loop and the LHR, if any, involve its backbone atoms and possibly the side chain of residue βAsp-99."
