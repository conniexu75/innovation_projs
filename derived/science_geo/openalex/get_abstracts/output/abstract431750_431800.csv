In this method, we first estimate the allele frequency spectrum using maximum likelihood. In contrast to previous methods, the likelihood function is calculated using a dynamic programming algorithm and numerically optimized using analytical derivatives. We then use a Bayesian method for estimating the sample allele frequency in a single site, and show how the method can be used for genotype calling and SNP calling. We also show how the method can be extended to various other cases including cases with deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. We evaluate the statistical properties of the methods using simulations and by application to a real data set."
https://openalex.org/W2036221290,"Lysine acetylation regulates protein stability and function. p300 is a component of the HIF-1 transcriptional complex and positively regulates the transactivation of HIF-1. Here, we show a novel molecular mechanism by which p300 facilitates HIF-1 activity. p300 increases HIF-1α (HIF1α) protein acetylation and stability. The regulation can be opposed by HDAC1, but not by HDAC3, and is abrogated by disrupting HIF1α-p300 interaction. Mechanistically, p300 specifically acetylates HIF1α at Lys-709, which increases the protein stability and decreases polyubiquitination in both normoxia and hypoxia. Compared with the wild-type protein, a HIF1α K709A mutant protein is more stable, less polyubiquitinated, and less dependent on p300. Overexpression of the HIF1α wild-type or K709A mutant in cancer cells lacking the endogenous HIF1α shows that the K709A mutant is transcriptionally more active toward the HIF-1 reporter and some endogenous target genes. Cancer cells containing the K709A mutant are less sensitive to hypoxia-induced growth arrest than the cells containing the HIF1α wild-type. Taken together, these data demonstrate a novel biological consequence upon HIF1α-p300 interaction, in which HIF1α can be stabilized by p300 via Lys-709 acetylation."
https://openalex.org/W2091807919,"Using genome-wide promoter methylation analysis, we identified a disintegrin-like and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 motif 9 (ADAMTS9) is methylated in cancer. We aim to clarify its epigenetic inactivation, biological function and clinical implication in gastric cancer. ADAMTS9 was silenced in 6 out of 8 gastric cancer cell lines. The loss of ADAMTS9 expression was regulated by promoter hypermethylation and could be restored by demethylation agent. Ectopic expression of ADAMTS9 in gastric cancer cell lines (AGS, BGC823) inhibited cell growth curve in both the cell lines (P<0.0001), suppressed colony formation (P<0.01) and induced apoptosis (P<0.001 in AGS, P<0.01 in BGC823). Moreover, conditioned culture medium from ADAMTS9-transfected cell lines significantly disrupted the human umbilical vein endothelial cell tube formation capacity on Matrigel (P<0.01 in AGS, P<0.001 in BGC823). The in vivo growth of ADAMTS9 cells in nude mice was also markedly diminished after stable expression of ADAMTS9 (P<0.001). On the other hand, ADAMTS9 knockdown promoted cell proliferation (P<0.001). We further revealed that ADAMTS9 inhibited tumor growth by blocking activation of Akt and its downstream target the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). ADAMTS9 also reduced phosphorylation of mTOR downstream targets p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, eIF4E-binding protein and downregulated hypoxia-inducible factor-1α. Therefore, this is the first demonstration that ADAMTS9 is a critical tumor suppressor of gastric cancer progression at least in part through suppression of oncogenic AKT/mTOR signaling. Moreover, promoter methylation of ADAMTS9 was detected in 29.2% (21/72) of primary gastric tumors. Multivariate analysis showed that patients with ADAMTS9 methylation had a poorer overall survival (relative risk (RR)=2.788; 95% confidence interval, 1.474–5.274; P=0.002). Kaplan–Meier survival curves showed that ADAMTS9 methylation was significantly associated with shortened survival in gastric cancer patients (P=0.001, log-rank test). In conclusion, ADAMTS9 acts as a functional tumor suppressor in gastric cancer through inhibiting oncogenic AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Methylation of ADAMTS9 is an independent prognostic factor of gastric cancer."

Hepatocarcinoma cancer (HCC), one of the most malignant cancers, occurs significantly more often in men than in women; however, little is known about its underlying molecular mechanisms. Here we identified that 17β-estradiol (E2) could suppress tumor growth via regulating the polarization of macrophages. We showed that E2 re-administration reduced tumor growth in orthotopic and ectopic mice HCC models. E2 functioned as a suppressor for macrophage alternative activation and tumor progression by keeping estrogen receptor β (ERβ) away from interacting with ATP5J (also known as ATPase-coupling factor 6), a part of ATPase, thus inhibiting the JAK1-STAT6 signaling pathway. These studies introduce a novel mechanism for suppressing male-predominant HCC."
https://openalex.org/W2081992199,"Human colonic bacteria are necessary for the digestion of many dietary polysaccharides. The intestinal symbiont Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron uses five outer membrane proteins to bind and degrade starch. Here, we report the x-ray crystallographic structures of SusE and SusF, two outer membrane proteins composed of tandem starch specific carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) with no enzymatic activity. Examination of the two CBMs in SusE and three CBMs in SusF reveals subtle differences in the way each binds starch and is reflected in their K(d) values for both high molecular weight starch and small maltooligosaccharides. Thus, each site seems to have a unique starch preference that may enable these proteins to interact with different regions of starch or its breakdown products. Proteins similar to SusE and SusF are encoded in many other polysaccharide utilization loci that are possessed by human gut bacteria in the phylum Bacteroidetes. Thus, these proteins are likely to play an important role in carbohydrate metabolism in these abundant symbiotic species. Understanding structural changes that diversify and adapt related proteins in the human gut microbial community will be critical to understanding the detailed mechanistic roles that they perform in the complex digestive ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W2057624491,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is neuropathologically characterized by the formation of senile plaques from amyloid-β (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles composed of phosphorylated Tau. Although there is growing evidence for the pathogenic role of soluble Aβ species in AD, the major question of how Aβ induces hyperphosphorylation of Tau remains unanswered. To address this question, we here developed a novel cell coculture system to assess the effect of extracellular Aβ at physiologically relevant levels naturally secreted from donor cells on the phosphorylation of Tau in recipient cells. Using this assay, we demonstrated that physiologically relevant levels of secreted Aβ are sufficient to cause hyperphosphorylation of Tau in recipient N2a cells expressing human Tau and in primary culture neurons. This hyperphosphorylation of Tau is inhibited by blocking Aβ production in donor cells. The expression of familial AD-linked PSEN1 mutants and APP ΔE693 mutant that induce the production of oligomeric Aβ in donor cells results in a similar hyperphosphorylation of Tau in recipient cells. The mechanism underlying the Aβ-induced Tau hyperphosphorylation is mediated by the impaired insulin signal transduction because we demonstrated that the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3β upon insulin stimulation is less activated under this condition. Treating cells with the insulin-sensitizing drug rosiglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ agonist, attenuates the Aβ-dependent hyperphosphorylation of Tau. These findings suggest that the disturbed insulin signaling cascade may be implicated in the pathways through which soluble Aβ induces Tau phosphorylation and further support the notion that correcting insulin signal dysregulation in AD may offer a potential therapeutic approach."

Different treatment options have been developed; however, these were insufficient during recent IAV outbreaks. Here, we conducted a targeted chemical screen in human nonmalignant cells to validate known and search for novel host-directed antivirals. The screen validated saliphenylhalamide (SaliPhe) and identified two novel anti-IAV agents, obatoclax and gemcitabine. Further experiments demonstrated that Mcl-1 (target of obatoclax) provides a novel host target for IAV treatment. Moreover, we showed that obatoclax and SaliPhe inhibited IAV uptake and gemcitabine suppressed viral RNA transcription and replication. These compounds possess broad spectrum antiviral activity, although their antiviral efficacies were virus-, cell type-, and species-specific. Altogether, our results suggest that phase II obatoclax, investigational SaliPhe, and FDA/EMEA-approved gemcitabine represent potent antiviral agents.

https://openalex.org/W2097690067,"Despite the important role of Polycomb in genome-wide silencing, little is known of the specific biochemical mechanism by which it inactivates transcription. Here we address how recombinant Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) inhibits activated RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex (PIC) assembly using immobilized H3K27-methylated chromatin templates in vitro. Recombinant PRC1 inhibited transcription, but had little effect on binding of the activator as reported previously. In contrast, Mediator and the general transcription factors were blocked during assembly or dissociated from preassembled PICs. Importantly, among the PIC components, Tata Binding Protein (TBP) was the most resistant to eviction by PRC1. Immobilized template experiments using purified PRC1, transcription factor II D (TFIID), and Mediator indicate that PRC1 blocks the recruitment of Mediator, but not TFIID. We conclude that PRC1 functions to block or dissociate PICs by interfering with Mediator, but leaves TBP and perhaps TFIID intact, highlighting a specific mechanism for PRC1 transcriptional silencing. Analysis of published genome-wide datasets from mouse embryonic stem cells revealed that the Ring1b subunit of PRC1 and TBP co-enrich at developmental genes. Further, genes enriched for Ring1b and TBP are expressed at significantly lower levels than those enriched for Mediator, TBP, and Ring1b. Collectively, the data are consistent with a model in which PRC1 and TFIID could co-occupy genes poised for activation during development.

https://openalex.org/W2066772704,"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a disease characterized by aggressive clinical behavior and lack of effective therapy. Owing to its tendency for early dissemination, only a third of patients have limited-stage disease at the time of diagnosis. SCLC is thought to derive from pulmonary neuroendocrine cells. Although several molecular abnormalities in SCLC have been described, there are relatively few studies on epigenetic alterations in this type of tumor. Here, we have used methylation profiling with the methylated-CpG island recovery assay in combination with microarrays and conducted the first genome-scale analysis of methylation changes that occur in primary SCLC and SCLC cell lines. Among the hundreds of tumor-specifically methylated genes discovered, we identified 73 gene targets that are methylated in >77% of primary SCLC tumors, most of which have never been linked to aberrant methylation in tumors. These methylated targets have potential for biomarker development for early detection and therapeutic management of SCLC. SCLC cell lines had a greater number of hypermethylated genes than primary tumors. Gene ontology analysis indicated a significant enrichment of methylated genes functioning as transcription factors and in processes of neuronal differentiation. Motif analysis of tumor-specific methylated regions identified enrichment of binding sites for several neural cell fate-specifying transcription factors including NEUROD1, HAND1, ZNF423 and REST. We hypothesize that two potential mechanisms, loss of cell fate-determining transcription factors by methylation of their promoters and functional inactivation of their corresponding genomic-binding sites by DNA methylation, can promote a differentiation defect of neuroendocrine cells thus enhancing the ability of tumor progenitor cells to transition toward SCLC."
https://openalex.org/W1981294952,"Androgen deprivation constitutes the principal therapy for advanced and metastatic prostate cancers. However, this therapeutic intervention usually results in the transition to a more aggressive androgen-independent prostate cancer. The elucidation of molecular alterations during the progression to androgen independence is an integral step toward discovering more effective targeted therapies. With respect to identifying crucial mediators of this transition, we compared the proteomes of androgen-independent (PC3, DU145, PPC1, LNCaP-SF, and 22Rv1) and androgen-dependent (LNCaP and VCaP) and/or normal prostate epithelial (RWPE) cell lines using mass spectrometry. We identified more than 100 proteins that were differentially secreted in the androgen-independent cell lines. Of these, Protein S (PROS1) was elevated in the secretomes of all of the androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines, with no detectable secretion in normal and androgen-dependent cell lines. Using quantitative PCR, we observed significantly higher (p < 0.05) tissue expression levels of PROS1 in prostate cancer samples, further indicating its importance in prostate cancer progression. Similarly, immunohistochemistry analysis revealed elevation of PROS1 in high grade prostate cancer (Gleason grade ≥ 8), and further elevation in castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer lesions. We also observed its significant (p < 0.05) elevation in high grade prostate cancer seminal plasma samples. Taken together, these results show that PROS1 is elevated in high grade and castration-resistant prostate cancer and could serve as a potential biomarker of aggressive disease."
https://openalex.org/W2070418804,"Tamoxifen (TAM) has both cytostatic and cytotoxic properties for breast cancer. TAM engaged mitochondrial estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) as an antagonist in MCF7-BK cells, increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentrations from the mitochondria that were required for cytotoxicity. In part, this derived from TAM downregulating manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) activity by causing the nitrosylation of tyrosine 34, thereby increasing ROS. ROS-activated protein kinase C delta and c-jun N-terminal kinases, resulting in the mitochondrial translocation of Bax and cytochrome C release. Interestingly, TAM failed to cause high ROS levels or induce cell death in MCF7-BK-TR cells due to stimulation of MnSOD activity through agonistic effects at mitochondrial ERβ. In several mouse xenograft models, lentiviral shRNA-induced knockdown of MnSOD caused tumors that grew in the presence of TAM to undergo substantial apoptosis. Tumor MnSOD and mitochondrial ERβ are therefore targets for therapeutic intervention to reverse TAM resistance and enhance a cell death response."
https://openalex.org/W2051665176,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a broad range of roles in biological regulation. In this study, rat pineal miRNAs were profiled for the first time, and their importance was evaluated by focusing on the main function of the pineal gland, melatonin synthesis. Massively parallel sequencing and related methods revealed the miRNA population is dominated by a small group of miRNAs as follows: ~75% is accounted for by 15 miRNAs; miR-182 represents 28%. In addition to miR-182, miR-183 and miR-96 are also highly enriched in the pineal gland, a distinctive pattern also found in the retina. This effort also identified previously unrecognized miRNAs and other small noncoding RNAs. Pineal miRNAs do not exhibit a marked night/day difference in abundance with few exceptions (e.g. 2-fold night/day differences in the abundance of miR-96 and miR-182); this contrasts sharply with the dynamic 24-h pattern that characterizes the pineal transcriptome. During development, the abundance of most pineal gland-enriched miRNAs increases; however, there is a marked decrease in at least one, miR-483. miR-483 is a likely regulator of melatonin synthesis, based on the following. It inhibits melatonin synthesis by pinealocytes in culture; it acts via predicted binding sites in the 3""-UTR of arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (Aanat) mRNA, the penultimate enzyme in melatonin synthesis, and it exhibits a developmental profile opposite to that of Aanat transcripts. Additionally, a miR-483 targeted antagonist increased melatonin synthesis in neonatal pinealocytes. These observations support the hypothesis that miR-483 suppresses Aanat mRNA levels during development and that the developmental decrease in miR-483 abundance promotes melatonin synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2043678696,"Embryonal cancer can arise from postnatally persistent embryonal remnant or rest cells, which are uniquely characterized by the absence of p53 mutations. Perinatal overexpression of the MycN oncoprotein in embryonal cancer precursor cells causes postnatal rests, and later tumor formation through unknown mechanisms. However, overexpression of Myc in adult tissues normally activates apoptosis and/or senescence signals as an organismal defense mechanism against cancer. Here, we show that perinatal neuroblastoma precursor cells exhibited a transiently diminished p53 response to MycN oncoprotein stress and resistance to trophic factor withdrawal, compared with their adult counterpart cells from the TH-MYCN+/+ transgenic mouse model of neuroblastoma. The adult stem cell maintenance factor and Polycomb group protein, Bmi1 (B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site), had a critical role at neuroblastoma initiation in the model, by repressing p53 responses in precursor cells. We further show in neuroblastoma tumor cells that Bmi1 could directly bind p53 in a complex with other Polycomb complex proteins, Ring1A or Ring1B, leading to increased p53 ubiquitination and degradation. Repressed p53 signal responses were also seen in precursor cells for other embryonal cancer types, medulloblastoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Collectively, these date indicate a general mechanism for p53 inactivation in some embryonal cell types and consequent susceptibility to MycN oncogenesis at the point of embryonal tumor initiation."
https://openalex.org/W2027866884,"Objective We investigated serum soluble CD163 (sCD163) levels for use in the diagnosis, severity assessment, and prognosis of sepsis in the critical ill patients and compared sCD163 with other infection-related variables. Methods During july 2010 and April 2011, serum was obtained from 102 sepsis patients (days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 after admission to an ICU) and 30 systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) patients with no sepsis diagnosed. Serum levels of sCD163, procalcitonon (PCT), and C reactive protein (CRP) were determined respectively. Sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores for sepsis patients were also recorded. Then evaluated their roles in sepsis. Results The sCD163 levels were 0.88(0.78–1.00)ug/mL for SIRS patients, 1.50(0.92–2.00)ug/mL for moderate sepsis patients, and 2.95(2.18–5.57)ug/mL for severe sepsis patients on day1. The areas under the ROC curves for sCD163, CRP, and PCT for the diagnosis of sepsis were, respectively, 0.856(95%CI: 0.791–0.921), 0.696(95%CI: 0.595–0.797), and 0.629(95%CI: 0.495–0.763), At the recommended cut-off 1.49 ug/mL for sCD163, the sensitivity is 74.0% with 93.3% specificity. Based on 28-day survivals, sCD163 levels in the surviving group stay constant, while they tended to gradually increase in the non-surviving group.The area under the ROC curve for sCD163 for sepsis prognosis was 0.706(95%CI 0.558–0.804). Levels of sCD163 with cut-off point >2.84 ug/mL have sensitivity of 55.8.0%, specificity 80.4%.Common risk factors for death and sCD163 were included in multivariate logistic regression analysis; the odds ratios (OR) for sCD163 and SOFA scores for sepsis prognosis were 1.173 and 1.396, respectively (P<0.05). Spearman rank correlation analysis showed that sCD163 was weakly, but positively correlated with CRP, PCT, and SOFA scores (0.2< r <0.4, P<0.0001), but not with leukocyte counts (r <0.2, P = 0.450). Conclusion Serum sCD163 is superior to PCT and CRP for the diagnosis of sepsis and differentiate the severity of sepsis. sCD163 levels were more sensitive for dynamic evaluations of sepsis prognosis. Serum sCD163 and SOFA scores are prognostic factors for sepsis. Trial Registration www.chictr.org ChiCTR-ONC-10000812"
https://openalex.org/W2085562893,"The [2Fe-2S] transcription factor SoxR is activated by reversible one-electron oxidation of its [2Fe-2S] cluster, leading to enhanced production of various antioxidant proteins through induction of the soxRS regulon in Escherichia coli. Recently, there has been considerable debate about whether superoxide (O2̇̄) activates SoxR directly. To elucidate the underlying activation mechanism, we investigated SoxR interaction with O2̇̄ using pulse radiolysis. Radiolytically generated hydrated electrons reduced the oxidized form of the [2Fe-2S] cluster of SoxR within 2 μs. A subsequent increase in absorption in the visible region corresponding to reoxidation of the [2Fe-2S] cluster was observed on a time scale of milliseconds. Addition of human copper/zinc superoxide dismutase inhibited this delayed oxidation in a concentration-dependent fashion (I50 = 1.0 μm), indicating that O2̇̄ oxidized the reduced form of SoxR directly. The second-order rate constant of this process was estimated to be 5 × 108 m−1 s−1. A similar result was observed after pulse radiolysis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa SoxR. However, superoxide dismutase inhibited the oxidation of reduced SoxR much more effectively in P. aeruginosa, even at a lower concentration (I50 = 80 nm), indicating that the soxRS response is much more sensitive to O2̇̄ in E. coli than in P. aeruginosa.

In E. coli cells, SoxR is maintained in its reduced inactive form (8Ding H. Hidalgo E. Demple B.

A crucial unanswered question concerns the nature of the cellular signal sensed by SoxR. O2̇̄ was the first candidate suggested as the SoxR-activating signal, reflecting the early observation that SoxR responded to agents that generate O2̇̄ (10Gaudu P. Moon N. Weiss B. Regulation of the soxRS oxidative stress regulon.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5082-5086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Experiments in intact cells showed that expression of the soxRS regulon member fumarase C was increased by an elevation of O2̇̄ caused by the deletion of superoxide dismutase (SOD) (22Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Modulation of the fumarases of Escherichia coli in response to oxidative stress.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The induction of fumarase C in the parental strain was eliminated by mutational deletion of the soxRS response (23Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Fumarase C, the stable fumarase of Escherichia coli, is controlled by the soxRS regulon.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 5892-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Similarly, the expression of soxRS-dependent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was higher in a control strain compared with E. coli cells overexpressing Mn-SOD (24Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Effects of overproduction of superoxide dismutase on the toxicity of paraquat toward Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8747-8750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, there is no evidence that the direct oxidant of the [2Fe-2S] cluster of SoxR is O2̇̄ itself (25Tsaneva I.R.

The soxRS response of Escherichia coli is directly activated by redox-cycling drugs rather than by superoxide.Mol. Microbiol. 2011; 79: 1136-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that the soxRS response of E. coli is directly activated by redox-cycling drugs rather than by O2̇̄. Reduced SoxR (SoxRred) was reported to be oxidized directly by redox-cycling drugs such as paraquat in the absence of SOD. However, there were arguments against this proposal (27Liochev S.I. Is superoxide able to induce SoxRS?.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2011; 50: 1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). As an alternative, it was suggested that the soxRS regulon does not respond to a change in O2̇̄ concentration, but rather responds to the redox state (NADPH/NADP+ ratio) (28Krapp A.R. Humbert M.V. Carrillo N. The soxRS response of Escherichia coli can be induced in the absence of oxidative stress and oxygen by modulation of NADPH content.Microbiology. 2011; 157: 957-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Accordingly, NADPH could maintain SoxRred by reactions linked by NADPH (29Kobayashi K. Tagawa S.

SoxR homologs have been identified in many bacterial species (31Dietrich L.E. Teal T.K. Price-Whelan A. Newman D.K.

All of these homologs contains the SoxR-specific cysteine motif CI(G/Q)CGC(L/M)(S/L)XXXC, required for binding of the [2Fe-2S] cluster (31Dietrich L.E. Teal T.K. Price-Whelan A. Newman D.K.

However, the P. aeruginosa SoxR function differs dramatically from that of E. coli. The SoxR regulon in P. aeruginosa, in which there is no obvious SoxS homolog, is composed of genes encoding an efflux pump, a transporter, and a putative monooxygenase (32Palma M. Zurita J.

This reaction can occur anaerobically in intact cells, suggesting O2̇̄-independent activation. This study was designed to investigate the hypothesis that O2̇̄ has a direct role as a signal for the soxRS regulon. Using the pulse radiolysis method, we have confirmed that O2̇̄ reacts rapidly and directly with SoxRred, but not with SoxRox. In addition, we present evidence that the sensitivity of SoxR to O2̇̄ is much higher in E. coli than in P. aeruginosa. Human Cu/Zn-SOD, overproduced by E. coli, was kindly provided by Nippon Kayaku.

Pulse radiolysis experiments were performed with a linear accelerator at the Institute of Scientific and Industrial Research of Osaka University (40Kobayashi K. Hayashi K. Sono M.

A 1-kilowatt xenon lamp was used as a light source. After passing through an optical path, the transmitted light intensities were analyzed and monitored by a fast spectrophotometric system composed of a Nikon monochromator, an R-928 photomultiplier, and a Unisoku data analysis system. For the time-resolved transient absorption spectral measurement, the monitor light was focused into a quartz optical fiber, which transported the electron pulse-induced transmittance changes to a gated multichannel spectrometer (Unisoku TSP-601-02). The initial concentration of superoxide radical generated by pulse radiolysis was 20–30 μm, which was estimated using the relationship ϵ260 = 1925 m−1 cm−1 (43Bielski B.H. Reevaluation of the spectral and kinetic properties of HO2 and O2̇̄ free radicals.Photochem. Photobiol. 1978; 28: 645-649Crossref Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Optical absorption spectra were measured with a Hitachi U-3000 spectrometer. To follow the reaction of O2̇̄ with SoxR, we studied absorption changes after pulse radiolysis of oxygen-saturated phosphate buffer in the presence of 50 μm SoxRox. Under these conditions, although most hydrated electrons generated reacted with O2 to form O2̇̄, a portion of the hydrated electrons were found to react very rapidly with SoxRox, resulting in reduction of the [2Fe-2S] cluster of the protein. This reduction was reflected in a decrease in absorbance at 420 nm. The initial transient spike in absorbance indicated the formation and decay of hydrated electrons (Fig. 2). Subsequently, these initial changes in absorption partially reversed (∼38%) on a time scale of milliseconds (Fig. 2). Fig. 3 shows difference spectra obtained at 20 μs and 20 ms after pulse radiolysis. Both spectra are similar to the SoxRred-minus-SoxRox spectrum. From these findings, it can be concluded that SoxRox was initially reduced, and subsequently, the [2Fe-2S] cluster became partially reoxidized. As shown in Fig. 4, this millisecond time scale recovery of oxidation was inhibited by addition of Cu/Zn-SOD (11 μm), which completely eliminated the delayed change in absorption without affecting the initial rapid decrease. From this, we conclude that the recovery process reflects the oxidation of SoxRred by O2̇̄.FIGURE 3Comparison of the kinetic difference spectra of SoxR obtained at 20 μs (red line) and 20 ms (blue line) after pulse radiolysis with the reduced-minus-oxidized difference spectrum (dashed line).

Under the deaerated condition, the spectrum was persistent for at least 30 s (data not shown). Therefore, the spectroscopic changes at 20 s account for the direct oxidation of the [2Fe-2S] cluster of SoxRred with O2. This suggests that the spectral changes after pulse radiolysis corresponds to reversible reduction of the protein, not by irreversible destruction of the iron-sulfur cluster. Electrochemical studies have shown that the reduction potential of SoxR bound to promoter DNA is positively and dramatically shifted from −285 mV (8Ding H. Hidalgo E. Demple B.

https://openalex.org/W2128457767,"Recent evidence highlights the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) as critical neuroprotective factors in several neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). To gain new mechanistic insights into the role of these receptors in the context of ALS, here we investigated how PPAR transcriptional activity varies in hSOD1G93A ALS transgenic mice. We demonstrate that PPARγ-driven transcription selectively increases in the spinal cord of symptomatic hSOD1G93A mice. This phenomenon correlates with the up-regulation of target genes, such as lipoprotein lipase and glutathione S-transferase α-2, which are implicated in scavenging lipid peroxidation by-products. Such events are associated with enhanced PPARγ immunoreactivity within motor neuronal nuclei. This observation, and the fact that PPARγ displays increased responsiveness in cultured hSOD1G93A motor neurons, points to a role for this receptor in neutralizing deleterious lipoperoxidation derivatives within the motor cells. Consistently, in both motor neuron-like cultures and animal models, we report that PPARγ is activated by lipid peroxidation end products, such as 4-hydroxynonenal, whose levels are elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid and spinal cord from ALS patients. We propose that the accumulation of critical concentrations of lipid peroxidation adducts during ALS progression leads to the activation of PPARγ in motor neurons. This in turn triggers self-protective mechanisms that involve the up-regulation of lipid detoxification enzymes, such as lipoprotein lipase and glutathione S-transferase α-2. Our findings indicate that anticipating natural protective reactions by pharmacologically modulating PPARγ transcriptional activity may attenuate neurodegeneration by limiting the damage induced by lipid peroxidation derivatives.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common motor neuron disorder of the adult life. In 90–95% of clinical cases the disease occurs with no apparent genetic linkage, whereas in the remaining 5–10% of cases ALS is inherited, usually in an autosomal dominant manner (familial ALS, fALS). Both forms of the disease cause degeneration of motor neurons, leading to paralysis and death within 3–5 years from the appearance of the first symptoms.

A controlled trial of riluzole in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. ALS/riluzole study group.N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 330: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). Thus, the identification of novel pharmacological targets and strategies for therapeutic intervention in ALS is highly desirable. A class of signaling molecules, whose relevance for neurodegenerative diseases has become lately evident, is represented by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), a family of nuclear receptors that includes three members, i.e. PPARα, -β/δ, and -γ (7Ricote M. Glass C.K. PPARs and molecular mechanisms of transrepression.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1771: 926-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 8Heneka M.T. Landreth G.E. Hüll M. Drug insight.

In the central nervous system (CNS), PPARs are expressed by neurons as well as glial cells (9Heneka M.T. Landreth G.E. PPARs in the brain.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1771: 1031-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), and can be activated by natural lipids and/or their metabolites, including oxidized fatty acids (10Itoh T. Fairall L. Amin K. Inaba Y. Szanto A. Balint B.L. Nagy L. Yamamoto K. Schwabe J.W. Structural basis for the activation of PPARγ by oxidized fatty acids.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 924-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Growing evidence indicates that activation of PPARs, particularly PPARγ, effectively attenuates neurodegeneration and disease progression in animal models of several neurodegenerative disorders (8Heneka M.T. Landreth G.E. Hüll M. Drug insight. Effects mediated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ in CNS disorders.Nat. Clin. Pract. Neurol. 2007; 3: 496-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, the specific mechanisms by which these receptors positively affect the course of these diseases have not been elucidated. The beneficial effects of the PPARγ agonist pioglitazone, described in early pharmacological studies on ALS transgenic mice, were mainly ascribed to the receptor anti-inflammatory activity (11Kiaei M. Kipiani K. Chen J. Calingasan N.Y. Beal M.F. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ agonist extends survival in transgenic mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Exp. Neurol. 2005; 191: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 12Schütz B. Reimann J. Dumitrescu-Ozimek L. Kappes-Horn K. Landreth G.E. Schürmann B. Zimmer A. Heneka M.T.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 7805-7812Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). PPARs can in fact control several aspects of the inflammatory response by repressing the expression of inflammatory genes through interaction with other transcription factors, such as the nuclear factor-κB and the activator protein 1 (7Ricote M. Glass C.K. PPARs and molecular mechanisms of transrepression.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1771: 926-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). However, PPARs can modulate gene expression also directly by binding, as heterodimers with the retinoid X receptors, to specific DNA response elements (PPREs) in the promoter or enhancer regions of target genes. By this means, they exert several homeostatic functions that are crucial for the activity and survival of neural cells (7Ricote M. Glass C.K. PPARs and molecular mechanisms of transrepression.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1771: 926-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Among the functions fulfilled by the PPARs, there is, for example, the capacity to control the expression of enzymes that are critically involved in detoxifying neurons from a wide variety of stress stimuli (13Zhao X. Strong R. Zhang J. Sun G. Tsien J.Z. Cui Z. Grotta J.C. Aronowski J. Neuronal PPARγ deficiency increases susceptibility to brain damage after cerebral ischemia.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 6186-6195Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These PPAR-dependent self-protective mechanisms appear to be relevant for survival of ALS motor neurons. Indeed, expression of PGC-1α, a transcriptional co-activator of PPARγ, was recently described to prevent mutant SOD1-induced neuronal cell death in vitro (14Song W. Song Y. Kincaid B. Bossy B. Bossy-Wetzel E. Mutant SOD1(G93A) triggers mitochondrial fragmentation in spinal cord motor neurons. Neuroprotection by SIRT3 and PGC-1α.Neurobiol. Dis. 2012; 10.1016/j.nbd.2012.07.004Google Scholar). Furthermore, both ubiquitous and neuron-specific expression of PGC-1α was reported to reduce motor neuron degeneration and alleviate the disease outcome in transgenic mice carrying the G93A mutant form of human SOD1 (hSOD1G93A) (15Zhao W. Varghese M. Yemul S. Pan Y. Cheng A. Marano P. Hassan S. Vempati P. Chen F. Qian X. Pasinetti G.M.

PGC-1α protects neurons and alters disease progression in an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mouse model.Muscle Nerve. 2011; 44: 947-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Altogether, these observations strongly suggest that fine-tuning PPAR transcriptional activity within the CNS may represent an attractive approach to limit the progression of ALS. To gain further insights into PPAR functions during the progression of the disease, here we bred mice genetically engineered to highlight PPAR transcriptional activity (PPRE-Luc mice; Ref. 17Ciana P. Biserni A. Tatangelo L. Tiveron C. Sciarroni A.F. Ottobrini L. Maggi A.

We demonstrate that transcriptional activity of PPARs significantly increases in the affected spinal cord at the symptomatic stage of the disease, a phenomenon that takes place in strict temporal and spatial correlation with degeneration of motor neurons. Furthermore, analyses of isoform-specific target genes and cellular distribution indicate that this peculiar process is driven by motor neuronal PPARγ, possibly through its activation by lipid peroxidation by-products that are generated during the course of the disease. Transgenic mice expressing the human SOD1G93A (B6SJL-TgN(SOD1-G93A)1Gur) (2Gurney M.E. Pu H. Chiu A.Y. Dal Canto M.C. Polchow C.Y. Alexander D.D. Caliendo J. Hentati A. Kwon Y.W. Deng H.X.

The colonies were maintained by breeding hemizygote males to wild-type C57Bl6/SJL hybrid females (Charles River Laboratories). Mice genetically engineered to ubiquitously express the luciferase reporter gene under control of the PPAR-responsive elements (hereafter referred to as “PPRE-Luc mice”) were previously described (17Ciana P. Biserni A. Tatangelo L. Tiveron C. Sciarroni A.F. Ottobrini L. Maggi A. A novel peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor responsive element-luciferase reporter mouse reveals gender specificity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor activity in liver.Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 21: 388-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). PPRE-Luc+/−; hSOD1G93A+/− double transgenic mice and their PPRE-Luc+/−; hSOD1G93A−/− littermates were obtained by cross-breeding hemizygote hSOD1G93A males with homozygous PPRE-Luc females. The progeny was screened for the presence of the two transgenes using primers 5′-SOD1 (5′-CATCAGCCCTAATCCATCTGA) and 3′-SOD1 (5′-CGCGACTAACAATCAAAGTGA) to detect the hSOD1G93A allele, and 5′-PPRE (5′-GGCAGAAGCTATGAAACGAT) and 3′-PPRE (5′-CGACTGAAATCCCTGGTAAT) to amplify the PPRE-Luc sequence. Genomic DNA extracted from mouse tail lysates was used as DNA template. To reduce the gender-dependent phenotypic variability described in hSOD1G93A ALS mice (18Heiman-Patterson T.D. Deitch J.S. Blankenhorn E.P. Erwin K.L. Perreault M.J. Alexander B.K. Byers N. Toman I. Alexander G.M. Background and gender effects on survival in the TgN(SOD1-G93A)1Gur mouse model of ALS.J. Neurol Sci. 2005; 236: 1-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), only animals of a single sex were analyzed in the present study. Females were selected because they show limited variations in PPAR transcriptional activity upon metabolic and hormonal events (17Ciana P. Biserni A. Tatangelo L. Tiveron C. Sciarroni A.F. Ottobrini L. Maggi A. A novel peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor responsive element-luciferase reporter mouse reveals gender specificity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor activity in liver.Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 21: 388-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Fasting experiments were performed by keeping mice for 48 h in the absence of food. Intracerebroventricular injection of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) in anesthetized animals was carried out according to specific stereotaxic coordinates (Bregma, −0.25 mm; lateral, 1 mm; depth, 2.25 mm) using a Hamilton syringe rotated on the coronal plate of about 3 degrees from the orthogonal position, as previously described (19Benedusi V. Meda C. Della Torre S. Monteleone G. Vegeto E. Maggi A. A lack of ovarian function increases neuroinflammation in aged mice.Endocrinology. 2012; 153: 2777-2788Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). All experiments described in this study were conducted according to the Guidelines for Care and Use of Experimental Animals. Use of experimental animals was approved by the Italian Ministry of Research and University and controlled by a panel of experts of the Department of Pharmacological Sciences, University of Milan. Tissue extracts were prepared by homogenization in 200 μl of lysis buffer (100 mm KPO4, 1 mm DTT, 4 mm EGTA, 4 mm EDTA, pH 7.8), one freeze-thaw cycle, and 30 min of centrifugation at 4900 × g (Rotanta 460R, Hettich Zentrifugen). Supernatants containing luciferase were collected and total protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (20Bradford M.M. A rapid and sensitive method for the quantitation of microgram quantities of protein utilizing the principle of protein-dye binding.Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215608) Google Scholar). Luciferase enzymatic activity in tissue extracts was then assayed with a luciferase assay buffer (470 μm luciferine, 20 mm Tricine, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.07 mm (MgCO3)4·Mg(OH)2 × 5H2O; 2.67 mm MgSO4 × 7H2O in H2O, pH 7.8, with 33.3 mm DTT and 530 μm ATP). The light intensity was measured with a luminometer (Glomax, Promega) in a 10-s time period and expressed as relative light units/μg of protein. Spines were taken and immersed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde for 24 h. Spinal cords were extracted, the lumbar tract was removed and paraffin embedded. Serial sections of paraffin-embedded spinal cords were cut at 10 μm and used to perform different immunostainings. On selected sections, the following immunohistochemical stainings were carried out: PPARγ (rabbit polyclonal antibody, 1:100; Affinity Bioreagents, Pierce), nonphosphorylated neurofilament H (SMI32, mouse monoclonal antibody, 1:500, Sternberger Monoclonals Inc.), and neuronal nuclei (mouse monoclonal antibody, 1:100, Chemicon) as neuronal markers, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, mouse Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated monoclonal antibody, 1:1000, Chemicon) as astrocytic marker. Licopersicum esculentum lectin (tomato lectin, 1:200, Sigma) was used to stain microglia. Nuclei were labeled with Hoechst 33342 (Sigma). For quantitative analysis, lumbar spinal cord images (2084 × 1536 pixels) were captured using a ×40 objective on a Zeiss Axioskop 40 microscope equipped with a Nikon Coolpix 9900 digital camera. The number of nuclei positively stained for PPARγ in the different cell types was determined on images from lumbar spinal cord sections double stained for PPARγ and SMI32, GFAP, or tomato lectin. The results were expressed as percentage of the total number of cells taken into consideration. The nuclear content of PPARγ in motor neurons, other neuronal subtypes, and non-neuronal cells was determined by immunofluorescence quantification on images from lumbar spinal cord and brain sections double stained for PPARγ and SMI32 or neuronal nuclei as follows. Fluorescence intensity of nuclear PPARγ immunostaining was measured in selected areas using ImageJ software (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij). Fluorescence intensity values were then averaged and expressed relative to mean fluorescence intensity obtained from background noise. Because Hoechst 33342 is a fluorescent dye that intercalates into the DNA, we considered its fluorescence intensity as a measure of the DNA content. Thus, the fluorescence intensity of PPARγ immunostaining was normalized to the intensity of Hoechst 33342. For motor neuron quantification, serial sections were stained with 0.5% cresyl violet (Sigma) to detect motor neuron Nissl substance. Motor neurons were counted for a total of 9 disectors using an unbiased stereologic physical disector technique (21Guntinas-Lichius O. Mockenhaupt J. Stennert E. Neiss W.F. Simplified nerve cell counting in the rat brainstem with the physical disector using a drawing-microscope.J. Microsc. 1993; 172: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For morphometric analysis of skeletal muscles, soleus and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles from 30-day-old and 28-month-old C57Bl/6J mice were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h and subsequently embedded in paraffin. Serial sections of paraffin-embedded muscles were cut at 10 μm and stained for hematoxylin and eosin. The minimal “Feret's diameter” was determined using ImageJ software on a minimum of two randomly chosen fields (corresponding to ∼200 fibers) for each muscle and mouse (n = 3). The construction of the PPRE5X-tk-Luc plasmid (hereafter referred to as PPRE-Luc transgene) carrying five tandem repeats of PPRE was previously described (17Ciana P. Biserni A. Tatangelo L. Tiveron C. Sciarroni A.F. Ottobrini L. Maggi A.

The bicistronic pSOD1wt-IRES2-ZsGreen1 expression vector coding for both wild-type human SOD1 and the Zoanthus sp. green fluorescent protein (ZsGreen) under control of the human cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter was generated by inserting the SOD1 open reading frame (ORF) into the multiple cloning site of the pIRES2-ZsGreen1 vector (Clontech). Briefly, a 465-bp PCR product of the wild-type human SOD1 ORF was prepared by using the pcDNA3-Myc-hSOD1wt plasmid (22Rossi D. Brambilla L. Valori C.F. Roncoroni C. Crugnola A. Yokota T. Bredesen D.E. Volterra A.

The amplicon was cleaved with EcoRI and BamHI and cloned into the EcoRI/BamHI-digested pIRES2-ZsGreen1 backbone to yield plasmid pSOD1wt-IRES2-ZsGreen1. The human mutant SOD1G93A ORF was prepared by PCR using the same primers and the pcDNA3-Myc-hSOD1G93A vector (22Rossi D. Brambilla L. Valori C.F. Roncoroni C. Crugnola A. Yokota T. Bredesen D.E. Volterra A. Focal degeneration of astrocytes in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 1691-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) as template. The PCR product was then ligated into the pIRES2-ZsGreen1 vector as described above to yield the pSOD1G93A-IRES2-ZsGreen1 construct. The entire ORFs were analyzed by sequencing. Primary adult neuronal cultures were prepared as previously described (23Brewer G.J. Torricelli J.R. Isolation and culture of adult neurons and neurospheres.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1490-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Briefly, pups were sacrificed at 5 days of age. Spinal cords were dissected in HABG (HibernateA, 2% B27 supplement, and 0.5 mm glutamine; Invitrogen). Tissues were dissociated with trypsin (1 mg/ml; Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C. Neurons were purified on OptiPrep density gradient (Sigma), finally resuspended in Neurobasal®-A, 2% B27 supplement, 0.5 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml of penicillin, 50 μg/ml of streptomycin sulfate, 5 ng/ml of FGF, and plated on 0.1 mg/ml of a poly-d-lysine-coated 6-well plate. To remove waste and debris, the medium was changed on day 4 and then every 7 days. Spinal cord mixed glial cell cultures were prepared as previously described, with modifications (22Rossi D.

Although increases in O-GlcNAc levels have typically been thought to be substrate-driven, studies in several transformed cell lines reported that glucose deprivation increased O-GlcNAc levels by a number of different mechanisms. A major goal of this study therefore was to determine whether in primary cells, such as neonatal cardiomyocytes, glucose deprivation increases O-GlcNAc levels and if so by what mechanism. Glucose deprivation significantly increased cardiomyocyte O-GlcNAc levels in a time-dependent manner and was associated with decreased O-GlcNAcase (OGA) but not O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) protein. This response was unaffected by either the addition of pyruvate as an alternative energy source or by the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580. However, the response to glucose deprivation was blocked completely by glucosamine, but not by inhibition of OGA with 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene)amino-N-phenylcarbamate. Interestingly, the CaMKII inhibitor KN93 also significantly reduced the response to glucose deprivation. Lowering extracellular Ca2+ with EGTA or blocking store operated Ca2+ entry with SKF96365 also attenuated the glucose deprivation-induced increase in O-GlcNAc. In C2C12 and HEK293 cells both glucose deprivation and heat shock increased O-GlcNAc levels, and CaMKII inhibitor KN93 attenuated the response to both stresses.

Since that time, a growing number of studies have shown that acute activation of pathways leading to increased O-GlcNAc levels affords cardioprotection against ischemia-reperfusion injury in different biological systems (16Champattanachai V.

O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) is responsible for catalyzing the addition of O-GlcNAc to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues of target proteins (22Haltiwanger R.S. Holt G.D. Hart G.W.

Thus, the rate of O-GlcNAc synthesis and overall levels of O-GlcNAc protein modification are tightly dependent on the flux through hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP). Indeed, flux through the HBP and OGT is considered the primary determinant of overall cellular O-GlcNAc levels, including stress-induced changes in O-GlcNAcylation. Interestingly, however, a number of studies have recently reported that glucose deprivation significantly induced O-GlcNAc modification in Hep2G, Neuro-2a neuroblastoma cells, and other cancer cell lines (24Kang J.G.

In Neuro-2a cells it was shown that glucose deprivation increased O-GlcNAc levels by up-regulation of OGT expression in an AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent manner and also that substrate targeting of OGT was regulated by p38 MAPK (26Cheung W.D.

These studies highlight the fact that our understanding of the mechanisms regulating the stress-induced increases in O-GlcNAc levels is surprisingly limited and may be cell type specific.

Therefore, the goal of these studies was to determine whether in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs), glucose-deprivation increases cellular O-GlcNAc levels and, if so, whether this occurs via a mechanism similar to or different from that previously reported in transformed cells. We also sought to determine whether the mechanism underlying the glucose deprivation-induced increase in O-GlcNAc was similar to that seen in response to other stress stimuli. We found that glucose deprivation was a profound stimulus for increasing O-GlcNAc levels in NRVMs in both a time- and dose-dependent manner, and this was mediated via Ca2+ and calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase (CaMKII) but not activation of p38 MAPK and could be inhibited by low concentrations of glucosamine. Of note, glucose deprivation-induced increases in O-GlcNAc occurred without alterations in OGT protein levels but were accompanied by decreased protein levels of O-GlcNAcase, which was independent of transcription. We also demonstrated that the Ca2+ dependence of glucose deprivation-induced increase in O-GlcNAc was generalizable both to other cell types and other stress responses such as heat shock. The following antibodies were used: anti-O-GlcNAc (CTD110.6 antibody, Mary-Ann Accavitti, UAB Epitope Recognition and Immunoreagent Core), anti-O-GlcNAc (clone 9D1.E4(10), Millipore, 05-1245), anti-OGT (DM-17, Sigma-Aldrich, O-6246), anti-OGA and anti-GAPDH (Abcam, ab8245), anti-phospho-AMPKα (Thr-172) and anti-AMPKα (Cell Signaling, 2535 and 2532), anti- hemoxygenase-1 (HO-1) (Assay Designs, SPA-894F), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgM (Calbiochem, 401225), anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad, 170-6516), and anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad, 170-6515). d(+)-Glucosamine hydrochloride was obtained from Fluka.

NRVMs were isolated from 2–3-day-old neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats and cultured as described previously (17Champattanachai V. Marchase R.B. Chatham J.C.

A confluent monolayer of spontaneously beating NRVMs has formed within 1–2 days of isolation, and experiments were performed 3–4 days after isolation. Cells were treated as described in detail under “Results,” harvested with lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, and 2% protease inhibitor, pH 7.9), and kept at −80 °C until subsequent analyses. NRVM nuclei were isolated by a NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction reagents kit (Pierce). Total RNA samples were extracted from NRVMs using a RNA extraction kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analyses were carried out using the Roche LightCycler 480 system (Roche Applied Science) to determine transcript levels of target genes. Real-time PCR results from each gene/primer pair were normalized to β-actin and compared across conditions. The OGT primers were: sense, 5′ TAACCTTGCCAACATCAAACGG 3′ and antisense, 5′ CCCTGAACATCCTGCATCTCCT 3′. OGA primers were: sense, 5′ TTTGTGCAGTGGTTAGGGTGTCG 3′ and antisense 5′ CCTTGGAGGTAGGAGTCAGTGGG 3′. Protein concentrations were determined, and lysates were reduced by 6× sample loading buffer (0.5 m Tris-HCl, 10% SDS, 30% glycerol, 0.2% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.012% bromphenol blue), boiled for 5 min, separated by SDS-PAGE (35 μg of protein/lane), and transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore). Immunoblotting was performed using a rapid immunodetection method for Immobilon-P (Millipore Technical Note TN051). Briefly, the membranes were equilibrated in methanol and air-dried. The dry membrane was incubated in anti-O-GlcNAc antibody CTD110.6 and anti-OGT antibody in 1% casein/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and anti-OGA antibody in Tris-buffered saline with 0.01% Tween 20 (TBST) for overnight at 4 °C and then washed three times in PBS or TBST. The membrane was then incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. After further washing in PBS or TBST the immunoblots were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cells were treated with PNGase F to hydrolyze N-glycans by incubating lysates with 1/15 unit PNGase for 1 h at 37 ºC based on methods similar to those described previously (33Isono T.

Concanavalin A (ConA) was obtained from GE Healthcare (17-0450-01). Anti-O-GlcNAc (9D1.E4) was obtained from Millipore (05-1245). For immunoblot assays, membranes were incubated with anti-O-GlcNAc (CTD110), ConA (500 μg/ml), or anti-O-GlcNAc (9D1.E4) in 1% casein/PBS. After overnight incubation at 4 °C membranes were washed three times in PBS. The membrane was then incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. After further washing in PBS the immunoblots were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Blots were treated overnight with 100 mm NaOH at 60 °C to selectively remove O-glycans by β-elimination (34Zachara N.E. Vosseller K. Hart G.W.

O-GlcNAcase activity was determined, with some modifications, as described previously using 4-methylumbelliferyl GlcNAc as substrate (36Toleman C. Paterson A.J. Kudlow J.E.

Cell extracts (25 μl) prepared in isotonic buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol) were added to 250 μm 4-methylumbelliferyl GlcNAc and 50 mm N-acetylgalactosamine in 50 mm NaH2PO4, 100 mm NaCl, pH 6.4, reaction buffer in a total volume of 50 μl. Assays were carried out at 37 °C for 30 min, and the reaction was quenched by the addition of 300 μl of sodium hydroxide-buffered 0.2 m glycine, pH 10.75. Liberated methylumbelliferone was measured in 96-well dishes using a BioTek Synergy II plate reader; excitation and absorbance wavelengths were 360 and 450 nm, respectively. HA-tagged OGA, purified from bacteria or HEK293 cells on a nickel affinity column, was used as a positive control for the assay. Glucose deprivation experiments were performed in triplicate 6-well tissue culture dishes with controls for each time point. The results as graphed represent three such experiments depicting the OGA activity in cell lysates of the glucose-deprived cells relative to controls. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. and compared by one-way ANOVA and Tukey's test or Student's t test as appropriate. Statistically significant differences between groups were defined as p < 0.05. In Fig. 1A it can be seen that removal of glucose from NRVMs resulted in a time-dependent increase in O-GlcNAc levels; this increase was apparent, particularly in high molecular mass proteins, within 3 h of glucose deprivation, and overall O-GlcNAc levels were significantly increased by 6 h and reached maximal levels by 12 h. In contrast to studies in other cell lines we did not observe an initial decrease in O-GlcNAc levels in response to glucose deprivation (25Taylor R.P. Parker G.J. Hazel M.W. Soesanto Y. Fuller W. Yazzie M.J. McClain D.A. Glucose deprivation stimulates O-GlcNAc modification of proteins through up-regulation of O-linked N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase.J. Biol.

Glucose is a primary energy source for cardiomyocytes; therefore, glucose deprivation was repeated for 6 h with and without 1 mm and 10 mm pyruvate, which is readily oxidized by cardiomyocytes for energy production. The addition of pyruvate had no effect on O-GlcNAc levels either in the presence or absence of glucose (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the increase in O-GlcNAc levels was not due to acute energy deprivation. A recent report suggested that the increase in CTD110.6 immunoreactive bands in response to glucose deprivation was largely due to cross-reactivity with the attenuated N-linked glycan, chitobiose (Asn-GlcNAc-GlcNAc) (33Isono T. O-GlcNAc-specific antibody CTD110.6 cross-reacts with N-GlcNAc2-modified proteins induced under glucose deprivation.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e18959Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This increase in chitobiose could be due to incomplete synthesis of N-linked oligosaccharide chains, perhaps the synthesis of N-linked chitobiose without any addition of mannose, or because of excessive trimming of the oligosaccharide core leaving only chitobiose. Therefore, we assessed the potential contribution of chitobiose to the increase in CTD110.6 reactivity following glucose deprivation, in several ways. First, we showed that the anti-O-GlcNAc, clone 9D1.E4(10) from Millipore, also demonstrated a marked increase in intensity following glucose deprivation (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, treatment of lysates from C2C12 myocytes following glucose deprivation, with PNGase F to remove N-glycans as previously described (33Isono T. O-GlcNAc-specific antibody CTD110.6 cross-reacts with N-GlcNAc2-modified proteins induced under glucose deprivation.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e18959Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), resulted in only a modest decrease in intensity of CTD110.6 positive staining (Fig. 1D). To confirm that PNGase F was removing N-glycans, lysates were treated with and without PNGase F followed by CTD110.6 immunoblot analysis to assess O-GlcNAc levels and ConA to assess changes in N-glycosylation. As shown in Fig. 1E, PNGase F markedly reduced ConA staining in both C2C12 and HEK293 cell lines in"

Quantitative RT-PCR studies demonstrated overexpression of DOHH mRNA and underexpression of miR-331-3p and miR-642-5p in several prostate cancer cell lines compared with normal prostate epithelial cells. Transient overexpression of miR-331-3p and/or miR-642-5p in DU145 prostate cancer cells reduced DOHH mRNA and protein expression and inhibited cell proliferation. We observed synergistic growth inhibition with the combination of miR-331-3p and miR-642-5p and mimosine, a pharmacological DOHH inhibitor. Finally, we identified a significant inverse relationship between the expression of miR-331-3p or miR-642-5p and DOHH in a cohort of human prostate cancer tissues. Our results suggest a novel role for miR-331-3p and miR-642-5p in the control of prostate cancer cell growth via the regulation of DOHH expression and eIF5A activity."
https://openalex.org/W2030837547,"Glycosylation is a major form of post-translational modification of synaptic vesicle membrane proteins. For example, the three major synaptic vesicle glycoproteins, synaptotagmin 1, synaptophysin, and SV2, represent ∼30% of the total copy number of vesicle proteins. Previous studies suggested that glycosylation is required for the vesicular targeting of synaptotagmin 1, but the role of glycosylation of synaptophysin and SV2 has not been explored in detail. In this study, we analyzed all glycosylation sites on synaptotagmin 1, synaptophysin, and SV2A via mutagenesis and optical imaging of pHluorin-tagged proteins in cultured neurons from knock-out mice lacking each protein. Surprisingly, these experiments revealed that glycosylation is completely dispensable for the sorting of synaptotagmin 1 to SVs whereas the N-glycans on SV2A are only partially dispensable. In contrast, N-glycan addition is essential for the synaptic localization and function of synaptophysin. Thus, glycosylation plays distinct roles in the trafficking of each of the three major synaptic vesicle glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W2065147201,"Reactive oxygen species are byproducts of mitochondrial respiration and thus potential regulators of mitochondrial function. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 2 (PDHK2) inhibits the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, thereby regulating entry of carbohydrates into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Here we show that PDHK2 activity is inhibited by low levels of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) generated by the respiratory chain. This occurs via reversible oxidation of cysteine residues 45 and 392 on PDHK2 and results in increased pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity. H(2)O(2) derives from superoxide (O(2)(.)), and we show that conditions that inhibit PDHK2 also inactivate the TCA cycle enzyme, aconitase. These findings suggest that under conditions of high mitochondrial O(2)(.) production, such as may occur under nutrient excess and low ATP demand, the increase in O(2)() and H(2)O(2) may provide feedback signals to modulate mitochondrial metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2022433397,"Anthracycline chemotherapeutic agents of the topoisomerase inhibitor family are widely used for the treatment of various tumors. Although targeted tumor tissues are generally situated in a hypoxic environment, the connection between efficacy of anthracycline agents and cellular hypoxia response has not been investigated in depth. Here, we report that doxorubicin (DXR) impairs the transcriptional response of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) by inhibiting the binding of the HIF heterodimer to the consensus -RCGTG- enhancer element. This pleiotropic effect retarded migration of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-defective renal cell carcinoma and that of VHL-competent renal cell carcinoma in hypoxia. This effect was accompanied by a coordinated down-regulation of HIF target lysyl oxidase (LOX) family members LOX, LOX-like2 (LOXL2), and LOXL4. Furthermore, DXR suppressed HIF target genes in tumor xenografts, inhibited cardiac induction of HIF targets in rats with acute anemia, and impaired the angiogenic response in the isoproterenol-induced heart failure model, which may account for the clinical fragility of doxorubicin cardiomyopathy. Collectively, these findings highlight the impaired hypoxia response by anthracycline agents affecting both tumors and organs of the cancer host and offer a promising opportunity to develop HIF inhibitors using DXR as a chemical template."
https://openalex.org/W2010266469,"Quantification of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA and surface antigen (HBsAg) serum levels have become increasingly important for the assessment of clinical stage and response to treatment for chronic hepatitis B. Effective immune clearance results in reduction of viremia by 4-5 log units and HBsAg levels by 2 log, but these processes are not well understood. Thus, it is uncertain to what extent mechanisms that inhibit transcription of the pregenomic RNA (pgRNA), an RNA intermediate, contribute to suppression of viremia. Likewise, it is unclear if transcriptional regulation is important for the excessive production of surface antigen (HBsAg) that is a hallmark of HBV infection.HBV RNA and cccDNA were quantified in 19 liver biopsies from patients with chronic HBV infection, as well as in transfected Huh7.5 cells and in PLC/PRF/5 cells carrying integrated HBV genome.Patients negative for HBeAg had 2.15 log lower levels of cccDNA in liver tissue, 4.84 log lower serum levels of HBV DNA and 1.45 log lower serum levels of HBsAg, than HBeAg-positive patients. The pgRNA in liver tissue correlated strongly with cccDNA (R(2) = 0.87, p<0.0001) and HBV DNA levels in serum (R(2) = 0.81, p<0.0001), whereas S-RNA correlated strongly with cccDNA (R(2) = 0.65, p<0.0001) and HBsAg levels (R(2) = 0.57, p = 0.0003). The S-RNA/pgRNA ratio was higher in HBeAg-negative patients (ratio 40 vs. 3, p = 0.01) and in PLC/PRF/5 cells, and was in transfected Huh7.5 cells not influenced by mutations in the HBV core promoter.The reduction of viremia that is observed after loss of HBeAg was mainly explained by reduced cccDNA load in the liver, whereas the contribution of down-regulation of pgRNA transcription was relatively small. Enhanced transcription of S-RNA does not explain excessive production of HBsAg."

Polysialylation of SynCAM 1 is cell type-specific and was exclusively found in NG2 cells, a class of multifunctional progenitor cells that form specialized synapses with neurons. Here, we studied the molecular requirements for SynCAM 1 polysialylation. Analysis of mice lacking one of the two polysialyltransferases, ST8SiaII or ST8SiaIV, revealed that polysialylation of SynCAM 1 is exclusively mediated by ST8SiaII throughout postnatal brain development. Alternative splicing of the three variable exons 8a, 8b, and 8c can theoretically give rise to eight transmembrane isoforms of SynCAM 1. We detected seven transcript variants in the developing mouse brain, including three variants containing exon 8c, which was so far regarded as a cryptic exon in mice. Polysialylation of SynCAM 1 was restricted to four isoforms in perinatal brain. However, cell culture experiments demonstrated that all transmembrane isoforms of SynCAM 1 can be polysialylated by ST8SiaII. Moreover, analysis of domain deletion constructs revealed that Ig1, which harbors the polysialylation site, is not sufficient as an acceptor for ST8SiaII.

The strategies used by Enterococcus faecalis to evade recognition by human complement are incompletely understood. In this study, we identified an insertional mutant of the wall teichoic acid (WTA) synthesis gene tagB in E. faecalis V583 that exhibited an increased susceptibility to complement-mediated killing by neutrophils. Further analysis revealed that increased killing of the mutant was due to a higher rate of phagocytosis by neutrophils, which correlated with higher C3b deposition on the bacterial surface. Our studies indicated that complement activation via the lectin pathway was much stronger on the tagB mutant compared with wild type. In concordance, we found an increased binding of the key lectin pathway components mannose-binding lectin and mannose-binding lectin-associated serine protease-2 (MASP-2) on the mutant. To understand the mechanism of lectin pathway inhibition by E. faecalis, we purified and characterized cell wall carbohydrates of E. faecalis wild type and V583ΔtagB. NMR analysis revealed that the mutant strain lacked two WTAs with a repeating unit of →6)[α-l-Rhap-(1→3)]β-D-GalpNAc-(1→5)-Rbo-1-P and →6) β-D-Glcp-(1→3) [α-D-Glcp-(1→4)]-β-D-GalpNAc-(1→5)-Rbo-1-P→, respectively (Rbo, ribitol).

https://openalex.org/W1984395134,"eIF3e/Int6 is a component of the multi-subunit eIF3 complex, which binds directly to the 40S ribosome to facilitate ribosome recruitment to mRNA and hence protein synthesis. Reduced expression of eIF3e/Int6 has been found in up to 37% of human breast cancers, and expression of a truncated mutant version of the mouse eIF3e/Int6 protein leads to malignant transformation of normal mammary cells. These findings suggest that eIF3e/Int6 is a tumor suppressor; however, a recent study has reported that a reduction of eIF3e/Int6 expression in breast cancer cells leads to reduced translation of oncogenes, suggesting that eIF3e/Int6 may in fact have an oncogenic role in breast cancer. To gain a better understanding of the role of eIF3e/Int6 in breast cancer, we have examined the effects of decreased eIF3e/Int6 expression in an immortalized breast epithelial cell line, MCF-10A. Surprisingly, we find that decreased expression of eIF3e/Int6 causes breast epithelial cells to undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We show that EMT induced by a decrease in eIF3e/Int6 expression imparts invasive and migratory properties to breast epithelial cells, suggesting that regulation of EMT by eIF3e/Int6 may have an important role in breast cancer metastasis. Furthermore, we show that reduced eIF3e/Int6 expression in breast epithelial cells causes a specific increase in the expression of the key EMT regulators Snail1 and Zeb2, which occurs at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Together, our data indicate a novel role of eIF3e/Int6 in the regulation of EMT in breast epithelial cells and support a tumor suppressor role of eIF3e/Int6."

We found that overexpression of TSPAN6 impaired RLR-mediated activation of IFN-stimulated response element, NF-κB, and IFN-β promoters, whereas knockdown of TSPAN6 enhanced the RLR-mediated signaling pathway. Interestingly, as the RLR pathway was activated, TSPAN6 underwent Lys-63-linked ubiquitination, which promoted its association with MAVS. The interaction of TSPAN6 and MAVS interfered with the recruitment of RLR downstream molecules TRAF3, MITA, and IRF3 to MAVS. Further study revealed that the first transmembrane domain of TSPAN6 is critical for its ubiquitination and association with MAVS as well as its inhibitory effect on RLR signaling.

N2,3-ϵG has been less well studied in terms of its replication and repair mechanisms because of the lability of its glycosidic bond.

The long half-life of N2,3-ϵG in rat liver and lung (150 days) and in rat kidney (75 days) in vinyl chloride-exposed rats suggests inefficient repair of this lesion.

We recently investigated the miscoding of N2,3-ϵG using a stabilized 2′-fluoro-substituted analog, 2′-fluoro-N2,3-ϵ-2′-deoxyarabinoguanosine (2′-F-N2,3-ϵdG) (38Zhao L. Christov P.P. Kozekov I.D.

The presence of the electronegative fluorine atom destabilizes the transition state leading to an oxocarbenium-like intermediate and hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond. This analog was site-specifically incorporated into oligonucleotides; the stability of 2′-F-N2,3-ϵdG permitted steady-state kinetics, primer extension assays, and crystallographic studies. Catalytic insertions opposite 2′-F-N2,3-ϵdG were examined using five DNA polymerases, including Sulfolobus solfataricus P2 DNA polymerase IV (Dpo4), the replicative bacteriophage pol T7 DNA exonuclease−, (E. coli pol I) Klenow fragment exonuclease−, yeast pol η, and human DNA pol κ, where a consistent miscoding pattern (2′-F-N2,3-ϵdG:T) was found. Crystal structures of Dpo4 with 2′-F-N2,3-ϵdG paired with dCTP showed a Watson-Crick-like structure, whereas the complex with 2′-F-N2,3-ϵdG:T revealed a “sheared” base pair (38Zhao L. Christov P.P.

To further understand the miscoding potential of N2,3-ϵG by Y-family human DNA polymerases, which are highly relevant to translesion synthesis, we carried out a series of primer extension and steady state-kinetic analyses using human pol ι, human pol η, and human REV1 with a template containing 2′-F-N2,3-ϵdG. The extension products formed by pol ι were identified using LC-MS/MS. A consistent mispairing pattern was observed (2′-F-N2,3-ϵdG:T), and base pairing mechanisms were revealed in two pol ι crystal structures with either dCTP or dTTP paired with 2′-F-N2,3-ϵdG but with individual differences. All commercial chemicals were of the highest quality available and were used without further purification. Unlabeled dNTPs, T4 polynucleotide kinase, uracil-DNA glycosylase, and restriction endonucleases were from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA).

The resulting PCR product of the 1.5-kb hREV1 fragment was cloned into the vector pSC-B-Amp/Kan (Stratagene). Following sequence confirmation, the hREV1 gene fragment was cloned into the BamHI and NotI sites of the vector pBG101 (obtained from the Center for Structural Biology, Vanderbilt University) to generate the cleavable glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged protein. The GST-tagged hREV1(330–833) was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells, which were grown at 37 °C and 220 rpm to an OD600 of 0.6 and then induced with isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (0.2 mm) for 12 h at 16 °C. The harvested pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 500 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mg ml−1 lysozyme, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Suspensions were sonicated, and the cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 4 × 104 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were loaded onto a 1-ml GSTrap 4B column (GE Healthcare), and the column was washed with 20 ml of Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The GST-tagged REV1(330–833) bound on the column was cleaved with Prescission protease (GE Healthcare) for 14 h at 4 °C. Cleaved REV1(330–833) was eluted with Buffer A, and the purity was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining. A typical yield was ∼760 μg from 1 liter of culture. An 18-mer oligomer (5′-GGGGGCTCGTAAGGATTC-3′) was 5′ [γ-32P]ATP end-labeled and annealed to a 23-mer template (5′-TCATXGAATCCTTACGAGCCCCC-3′ where X = 2′-F-N2,3-ϵdG, 2′-F-dG, or 2′-deoxyguanosine (dG)).

https://openalex.org/W1988370350,"Modularity is a crucial issue in the engineering world, as it enables engineers to achieve predictable outcomes when different components are interconnected. Synthetic Biology aims to apply key concepts of engineering to design and construct new biological systems that exhibit a predictable behaviour. Even if physical and measurement standards have been recently proposed to facilitate the assembly and characterization of biological components, real modularity is still a major research issue. The success of the bottom-up approach strictly depends on the clear definition of the limits in which biological functions can be predictable.The modularity of transcription-based biological components has been investigated in several conditions. First, the activity of a set of promoters was quantified in Escherichia coli via different measurement systems (i.e., different plasmids, reporter genes, ribosome binding sites) relative to an in vivo reference promoter. Second, promoter activity variation was measured when two independent gene expression cassettes were assembled in the same system. Third, the interchangeability of input modules (a set of constitutive promoters and two regulated promoters) connected to a fixed output device (a logic inverter) expressing GFP was evaluated. The three input modules provide tunable transcriptional signals that drive the output device. If modularity persists, identical transcriptional signals trigger identical GFP outputs. To verify this, all the input devices were individually characterized and then the input-output characteristic of the logic inverter was derived in the different configurations.Promoters activities (referred to a standard promoter) can vary when they are measured via different reporter devices (up to 22%), when they are used within a two-expression-cassette system (up to 35%) and when they drive another device in a functionally interconnected circuit (up to 44%). This paper provides a significant contribution to the study of modularity limitations in building biological systems by providing useful data on context-dependent variability of biological components."
https://openalex.org/W2012278053,"Cyclic adenosine diphosphoribose (cADPR) is an endogenous Ca(2+) mobilizing messenger that is formed by ADP-ribosyl cyclases from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). The main ADP-ribosyl cyclase in mammals is CD38, a multi-functional enzyme and a type II membrane protein. Here we explored the role of CD38-cADPR-Ca(2+) in the cardiomyogenesis of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. We found that the mouse ES cells are responsive to cADPR and possess the key components of the cADPR signaling pathway. In vitro cardiomyocyte (CM) differentiation of mouse ES cells was initiated by embryoid body (EB) formation. Interestingly, beating cells appeared earlier and were more abundant in CD38 knockdown EBs than in control EBs. Real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analyses further showed that the expression of several cardiac markers, including GATA4, MEF2C, NKX2.5, and α-MLC, were increased markedly in CD38 knockdown EBs than those in control EBs. Similarly, FACS analysis showed that more cardiac Troponin T-positive CMs existed in CD38 knockdown or 8-Br-cADPR, a cADPR antagonist, treated EBs compared with that in control EBs. On the other hand, overexpression of CD38 in mouse ES cells significantly inhibited CM differentiation. Moreover, CD38 knockdown ES cell-derived CMs possess the functional properties characteristic of normal ES cell-derived CMs. Last, we showed that the CD38-cADPR pathway negatively modulated the FGF4-Erks1/2 cascade during CM differentiation of ES cells, and transiently inhibition of Erk1/2 blocked the enhanced effects of CD38 knockdown on the differentiation of CM from ES cells. Taken together, our data indicate that the CD38-cADPR-Ca(2+) signaling pathway antagonizes the CM differentiation of mouse ES cells."
https://openalex.org/W2018825319,"Crystal structures of divalent metal-dependent pyruvate aldolase, HpaI, in complex with substrate and cleavage products were determined to 1.8-2.0 Å resolution. The enzyme·substrate complex with 4-hydroxy-2-ketoheptane-1,7-dioate indicates that water molecule W2 bound to the divalent metal ion initiates C3-C4 bond cleavage. The binding mode of the aldehyde donor delineated a solvent-filled capacious binding locus lined with predominantly hydrophobic residues. The absence of direct interactions with the aldehyde aliphatic carbons accounts for the broad specificity and lack of stereospecific control by the enzyme. Enzymatic complex structures formed with keto acceptors, pyruvate, and 2-ketobutyrate revealed bidentate interaction with the divalent metal ion by C1-carboxyl and C2-carbonyl oxygens and water molecule W4 that is within close contact of the C3 carbon. Arg(70) assumes a multivalent role through its guanidinium moiety interacting with all active site enzymatic species: C2 oxygen in substrate, pyruvate, and ketobutyrate; substrate C4 hydroxyl; aldehyde C1 oxygen; and W4. The multiple interactions made by Arg(70) stabilize the negatively charged C4 oxygen following proton abstraction, the aldehyde alignment in aldol condensation, and the pyruvate enolate upon aldol cleavage as well as support proton exchange at C3. This role is corroborated by loss of aldol cleavage ability and pyruvate C3 proton exchange activity and by a 730-fold increase in the dissociation constant toward the pyruvate enolate analog oxalate in the R70A mutant. Based on the crystal structures, a mechanism is proposed involving the two enzyme-bound water molecules, W2 and W4, in acid/base catalysis that facilitates reversible aldol cleavage. The same reaction mechanism promotes decarboxylation of oxaloacetate."
https://openalex.org/W2062769965,"Endostatin is an important endogenous inhibitor of neovascularization that has been widely used in anti-angiogenesis therapy for the treatment of cancer. However, its clinical application is largely hampered by its low efficacy. Human placenta-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hpMSCs) are particularly attractive cells for clinical use in cell-based therapies. In the present study, hpMSCs were isolated and characterized. We then evaluated the tumor targeting properties and antitumor effects of hpMSCs as gene delivery vehicles for ovarian cancer therapy. We efficiently engineered hpMSCs to deliver endostatin via adenoviral transduction mediated by Lipofectamine 2000. The tropism capacity of the engineered hpMSCs toward tumor cells was then confirmed by in vitro migration assays and in vivo by intraperitoneal injection of hpMSCs into nude mice. The hpMSCs expressing the human endostatin gene demonstrated preferential homing to the tumor site and significantly decreased the tumor volume without apparent systemic toxic effects. These observations were associated with significantly decreased blood sprouts and tumor cell proliferation as well as a dramatically increased tumor apoptosis index. These results suggested that hpMSCs are potentially an effective delivery vehicle for therapeutic genes for the treatment of ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2037362642,"The co-assembly of KCNQ1 with KCNE1 produces I(KS), a K(+) current, crucial for the repolarization of the cardiac action potential. Mutations in these channel subunits lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. However, very little is known about the gating mechanisms underlying KCNQ1 channel activation. Shaker channels have provided a powerful tool to establish the basic gating mechanisms of voltage-dependent K(+) channels, implying prior independent movement of all four voltage sensor domains (VSDs) followed by channel opening via a last concerted cooperative transition. To determine the nature of KCNQ1 channel gating, we performed a thermodynamic mutant cycle analysis by constructing a concatenated tetrameric KCNQ1 channel and by introducing separately a gain and a loss of function mutation, R231W and R243W, respectively, into the S4 helix of the VSD of one, two, three, and four subunits. The R231W mutation destabilizes channel closure and produces constitutively open channels, whereas the R243W mutation disrupts channel opening solely in the presence of KCNE1 by right-shifting the voltage dependence of activation. The linearity of the relationship between the shift in the voltage dependence of activation and the number of mutated subunits points to an independence of VSD movements, with each subunit incrementally contributing to channel gating. Contrary to Shaker channels, our work indicates that KCNQ1 channels do not experience a late cooperative concerted opening transition. Our data suggest that KCNQ1 channels in both the absence and the presence of KCNE1 undergo sequential gating transitions leading to channel opening even before all VSDs have moved."

It is possible that the psychological distress experienced by patients, including anxiety and depression, may be correlated with poor prognosis. In the present study, we hypothesize that genetic variations within three genes biologically linked to the stress response, namely serotonin transporter (SLC6A4), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and arginine vasopressin receptor (AVPR1B) genes are associated with prognosis in colorectal cancer patients. We used a population-based cohort of 280 patients who were followed for up to 12.5 years after diagnosis. Our multivariate analysis showed that a tagSNP in the SLC6A4 gene (rs12150214) was a predictor of shorter overall survival (HR: 1.572, 95%CI: 1.142-2.164, p = 0.005) independent of stage, age, grade and MSI status. Additionally, a multivariate analysis using the combined genotypes of three polymorphisms in this gene demonstrated that the presence of any of the minor alleles at these polymorphic loci was an independent predictor of both shorter overall survival (HR: 1.631, 95%CI: 1.190-2.236, p = 0.002) and shorter disease specific survival (HR: 1.691, 95%CI: 1.138-2.512, p = 0.009). The 5-HTT protein coded by the SLC6A4 gene has also been implicated in inflammation. While our results remain to be replicated in other patient cohorts, we suggest that the genetic variations in the SLC6A4 gene contribute to poor survival in colorectal cancer patients."

In this report, we found that ACTN4 (full length) and its spliced isoform ACTN4 (Iso) possess an unusual LXXLL nuclear receptor interacting motif. Both ACTN4 (full length) and ACTN4 (Iso) potentiate basal transcription activity and directly interact with estrogen receptor α, although ACTN4 (Iso) binds ERα more strongly.

Although ACTN4 (Iso) interacts efficiently with transcriptional co-activators such as p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) and steroid receptor co-activator 1 (SRC-1), the full length ACTN4 protein either does not or does so weakly. More importantly, the flanking sequences of the LXXLL motif are important not only for interacting with nuclear receptors but also for the association with co-activators. Taken together, we have identified a novel extended LXXLL motif that is critical for interactions with both receptors and co-activators.

Here, we investigated the impact of inflammation and stress on the expression and function of PrPC in neutrophils, a cell type critically involved in both acute and chronic inflammation. We found that systemic injection of LPS induced transcription and translation of PrPC in mouse neutrophils. Up-regulation of PrPC was dependent on the serum content of TGF-β and glucocorticoids (GC), which, in turn, are contingent on the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in response to systemic inflammation.

Moreover, GC also mediated up-regulation of PrPC in neutrophils following noninflammatory restraint stress. Finally, neutrophils with up-regulated PrPC presented enhanced peroxide-dependent cytotoxicity to endothelial cells.

This process requires disulfide bond transfer from oxidized Mia40 to a substrate protein. Reduced Mia40 is reoxidized/regenerated by the FAD-linked sulfhydryl oxidase Erv1 (EC 1.8.3.2). Full-length Erv1 consists of a flexible N-terminal shuttle domain (NTD) and a conserved C-terminal core domain (CTD). Here, we present crystal structures at 2.0 Å resolution of the CTD and at 3.0 Å resolution of a C30S/C133S double mutant of full-length Erv1 (Erv1FL). Similar to previous homologous structures, the CTD exists as a homodimer, with each subunit consisting of a conserved four-helix bundle that accommodates the isoalloxazine ring of FAD and an additional single-turn helix. The structure of Erv1FL enabled us to identify, for the first time, the three-dimensional structure of the Erv1NTD, which is an amphipathic helix flanked by two flexible loops. This structure also represents an intermediate state of electron transfer from the NTD to the CTD of another subunit. Comparative structural analysis revealed that the four-helix bundle of the CTD forms a wide platform for the electron donor NTD. Moreover, computational simulation combined with multiple-sequence alignment suggested that the amphipathic helix close to the shuttle redox enter is critical for the recognition of Mia40, the upstream electron donor.

https://openalex.org/W2037275166,"The pro-death Bcl-2 family protein and tumor suppressor Bax is frequently mutated in tumors with microsatellite instability (MSI). The mutation often results in a ""Bax negative"" phenotype and therefore is generally thought to be beneficial to the development of the tumor. Here, we report the identification of a novel Bax isoform, BaxΔ2, which is unique to microsatellite unstable tumors. BaxΔ2 is generated by a unique combination of a microsatellite deletion in Bax exon 3 and alternative splicing of Bax exon 2. Consistently, BaxΔ2 is only detected in MSI cell lines and primary tumors. BaxΔ2 is a potent cell death inducer but does not directly target mitochondria. In addition, BaxΔ2 sensitizes certain MSI tumor cells to a subset of chemotherapeutic agents, such as adriamycin. Thus, our data provide evidence that mutation and alternative splicing of tumor suppressors such as Bax are not always beneficial to tumor development but can be detrimental instead."
https://openalex.org/W2002140176,"Previous studies have demonstrated transcription-coupled nucleotide/base excision repair. We report here for the first time that DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair is also coupled to transcription. We generated a yeast strain by introducing a homing (Ho) endonuclease cut site followed by a nucleotide sequence for multiple Myc epitopes at the 3' end of the coding sequence of a highly active gene, ADH1. This yeast strain also contains the Ho cut site at the nearly silent or poorly active mating type α (MATα) locus and expresses Ho endonuclease under the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter. Using this strain, DSBs were generated at the ADH1 and MATα loci in galactose-containing growth medium that induced HO expression. Subsequently, yeast cells were transferred to dextrose-containing growth medium to stop HO expression, and the DSB repair was monitored at the ADH1 and MATα loci by PCR, using the primer pairs flanking the Ho cut sites. Our results revealed a faster DSB repair at the highly active ADH1 than that at the nearly silent MATα locus, hence implicating a transcription-coupled DSB repair at the active gene in vivo. Subsequently, we extended this study to another gene, PHO5 (carrying the Ho cut site at its coding sequence), under transcriptionally active and inactive growth conditions. We found a fast DSB repair at the active PHO5 gene in comparison to its inactive state. Collectively, our results demonstrate a preferential DSB repair at the active gene, thus supporting transcription-coupled DSB repair in living cells."
https://openalex.org/W2023152790,"In a previous work, we reported that young transgenic (Tg) mice expressing the intracellular domain of Notch1 (N1IC) showed expansion of lin− CD24+ CD29high mammary cells enriched for stem cells and later developed mammary tumors. Mammary tumor formation was abolished or greatly reduced in cyclin D1−/− or cyclin D1+/− N1IC Tg mice, respectively. Here, we studied the epithelial cell subsets present in N1IC-induced tumors. CD24− CD29int and CD24+ CD29high cells were found to be present at low numbers in tumors. The latter had the same properties as those expanded in young Tg females, and neither cell population showed tumor-initiating potential nor were they required for maintenance of tumors after transplantation. CD24int CD29int cells were identified as tumor-initiating and mammosphere-forming cells and represent a large percentage tumor cells in this model. Their number was significantly lower in tumors from cyclin D1+/− N1IC Tg mice. Using cyclin D1 shRNA knockdown, we also show that N1IC-induced tumor cells remain addicted to cyclin D1 for growth and survival. Interestingly, at lower levels of cyclin D1 or after transplantation in the presence of normal mammary cells, these N1IC-expressing tumor cells reverted to a state of low malignancy and differentiate into duct-like structures. They seem to adopt the fate of bi-potential stem/progenitor cells similar to that of the expanded CD24+ CD29high stem/progenitor cells from which they are likely to be derived. Our data indicate that decreasing cyclin D1 levels would be an efficient treatment for tumors induced by N1 signaling."

Both the promoter luciferase assay and mRNA degradation assay clearly showed that depletion of JNK2 affected stability of hif-1α mRNA, rather than regulated its transcription. In addition, nucleolin, a classic histone chaperone, was demonstrated to physically bind to hif-1α mRNA and maintain its stability. Further investigation indicated that JNK2 regulated nucleolin expression and might in turn stabilize hif-1α mRNA.

https://openalex.org/W2077427232,"It has been shown that inhibition of GTPase-activating protein of ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf), ArfGAP, with a small molecule (QS11) results in synergistic activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. However, the role of Arf in Wnt/β-catenin signaling has not yet been elucidated. Here, we show that activation of Arf is essential for Wnt/β-catenin signaling. The level of the active form of Arf (Arf-GTP) transiently increased in the presence of Wnt, and this induction event was abrogated by blocking the interaction between Wnt and Frizzled (Fzd). In addition, knockdown of Fzds, Dvls or LRP6 blocked the Wnt-mediated activation of Arf. Consistently, depletion of Arf led to inhibition of Wnt-mediated membrane PtdIns (4,5)P2 (phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate) synthesis and LRP6 phosphorylation. Overall, our data suggest that transient activation of Arf modulates LRP6 phosphorylation for the transduction of Wnt/β-catenin signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2068327493,"Resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs is a significant clinical problem in the treatment of cancer and this resistance has been linked to the cellular expression of multidrug-efflux transporters. The aim of this study was to explore the role of HOXC6 in the regulation of multidrug resistance (MDR) to chemotherapeutic drugs. The HOXC6 gene was identified as being overexpressed in drug-resistant cells compared with parental cell lines. Transfection assays demonstrated that HOXC6 activated MDR-1 promoter activity. A series of MDR-1 promoter deletion mutants was examined and the minimal HOXC6-responsive region was identified to be in the TAAT motif (−2243 bp) of the MDR-1 promoter. Interestingly, overexpression of HOXC6 in the parental cell lines resulted in the upregulation of MDR-1 expression. The inhibition of HOXC6 using small interfering RNA led to the repression of MDR-1. We determined that knockdown of HOXC6 expression in MDR cells increased their sensitivity to paclitaxel. Flow cytometry analysis suggested that siHOXC6 could induce paclitaxel-induced apoptosis and that this was accompanied by an increased accumulation and a decreased release of paclitaxel. Taken together, our findings suggest that HOXC6 expression is an important mechanism of chemotherapeutic drug resistance via its regulation of MDR-1."
https://openalex.org/W2109581712,"We examined changes in the abundance of immature Aedes aegypti at the household and water storage container level during the dry-season (June-July, 2008) in Tri Nguyen village, central Vietnam. We conducted quantitative immature mosquito surveys of 171 containers in the same 41 households, with replacement of samples, every two days during a 29-day period. We developed multi-level mixed effects regression models to investigate container and household variability in pupal abundance. The percentage of houses that were positive for I/II instars, III/IV instars and pupae during any one survey ranged from 19.5-43.9%, 48.8-75.6% and 17.1-53.7%, respectively. The mean numbers of Ae. aegypti pupae per house ranged between 1.9-12.6 over the study period. Estimates of absolute pupal abundance were highly variable over the 29-day period despite relatively stable weather conditions. Most variability in pupal abundance occurred at the container rather than the household level. A key determinant of Ae. aegypti production was the frequent filling of the containers with water, which caused asynchronous hatching of Ae. aegypti eggs and development of cohorts of immatures. We calculated the probability of the water volume of a large container (>500 L) increasing or decreasing by ≥20% to be 0.05 and 0.07 per day, respectively, and for small containers (<500 L) to be 0.11 and 0.13 per day, respectively. These human water-management behaviors are important determinants of Ae. aegypti production during the dry season. This has implications for choosing a suitable Wolbachia strain for release as it appears that prolonged egg desiccation does not occur in this village."
https://openalex.org/W2045392614,"In vitro measures of the pharmacodynamics of antibiotics that account for the factors anticipated for bacteria in infected patients are central to the rational design of antibiotic treatment protocols. We consider whether or not continuous culture devices are a way to obtain these measures. Staphylococcus aureus PS80 in high-density continuous cultures were exposed to oxacillin, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, gentamicin, daptomycin and linezolid. Contrary to results from low density retentostats as well as to predictions of traditional PK/MIC ratios, daily dosing with up to 100× MIC did not clear these cultures. The densities of S. aureus in these cultures oscillated with constant amplitude and never fell below 10(5) CFU per ml. Save for daptomycin ""treated"" populations, the densities of bacteria in these cultures remained significantly below that of similar antibiotic-free cultures. Although these antibiotics varied in their pharmacodynamic properties there were only modest differences in their mean densities. Mathematical models and experiments suggest that the dominant factor preventing clearance was wall-adhering subpopulations reseeding the planktonic population which can be estimated and corrected for. Continuous cultures provide a way to evaluate the potential efficacy of antibiotic treatment regimes in vitro under conditions that are more clinically realistic and comprehensive than traditional in vitro PK/PD indices."
https://openalex.org/W1998098699,"Reduced expression of the homeodomain transcription factor NKX3.1 is associated with prostate cancer initiation and progression. NKX3.1 turnover requires post-translational modifications including phosphorylation and ubiquitination. Here, we demonstrate the existence of a non-canonical mechanism for NKX3.1 turnover that does not require ubiquitination. Using a structure-function approach, we have determined that the conserved, C-terminal 21-amino acid domain of NKX3.1 (C21) is required for this novel ubiquitin-independent degradation mechanism. Addition of C21 decreased half-life of enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) by 5-fold, demonstrating that C21 constitutes a portable degron. Point mutational analyses of C21 revealed that a conserved proline residue (Pro-221) is central to degron activity, and mutation to alanine (P221A) increased NKX3.1 half-life >2-fold. Proteasome inhibition and in vivo ubiquitination analyses indicated that degron activity is ubiquitin-independent. Evaluating degron activity in the context of a ubiquitination-resistant, lysine-null NKX3.1 mutant (NKX3.1(KO)) confirmed that P221A mutation conferred additional stability to NKX3.1. Treatment of prostate cancer cell lines with a C21-based peptide specifically increased the level of NKX3.1, suggesting that treatment with degron mimetics may be a viable approach for NKX3.1 restoration."
https://openalex.org/W2000951430,"The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(Waf1/Cip1) is a major regulator of the cell cycle and plays an important role in many cellular processes, including differentiation, stress response, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis. We previously cloned the gene encoding dog p21 and found that unlike its human ortholog, dog p21 is expressed as two isoforms, one high molecular mass band of 23 kDa and one low molecular mass band of 19 kDa. In the current study, we found that the high molecular mass band is phosphorylated, whereas the low molecular mass band is hypophosphorylated. Moreover, by generating multiple mutants of dog p21, we found that serine 123 and proline 124, which form a consensus site for proline-directed phosphorylation, are required for expression of the high molecular mass p21 isoform through phosphorylation at serine 123. Most importantly, we showed that serine 123 phosphorylation inhibits ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation of p21 protein and subsequently, prolongs p21 protein half-life and enhances the ability of p21 to suppress cell proliferation. Taken together, these data reveal that serine 123 phosphorylation modulates p21 protein stability and activity by suppressing ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation."

Previous reports showed that the factor for inversion stimulation (Fis) encoded by fis can affect the replication, transcription and other processes through binding DNA. Here, a fis deletion mutant of S. Typhi (Δfis) was prepared through the homologous recombination mediated by suicide plasmid and the loss of pBSSB1 in Δfis was observed surprisingly by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Subsequently, the loss of pBSSB1 was verified by PCR and Southern blot. In addition, the motility of Δfis was deficient and the flagellin of Δfis could not be detected by 2-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. All these results show that Fis is essential for the stability of pBSSB1 and affects the motility of S. Typhi."

Critical features of this microtubule system are the formation of radial arrays centered at the centrosomes and dynamic instability, leading to persistent cycles of polymerization and depolymerization. Here, we show that actin homolog, ParM-R1 that drives segregation of the R1 multidrug resistance plasmid from Escherichia coli, can also self-organize in vitro into asters, which resemble astral microtubules. ParM-R1 asters grow from centrosome-like structures consisting of interconnected nodes related by a pseudo 8-fold symmetry. In addition, we show that ParM-R1 is able to perform persistent microtubule-like oscillations of assembly and disassembly. In vitro, a whole population of ParM-R1 filaments is synchronized between phases of growth and shrinkage, leading to prolonged synchronous oscillations even at physiological ParM-R1 concentrations. These results imply that the selection pressure to reliably segregate DNA during cell division has led to common mechanisms within diverse segregation machineries."
