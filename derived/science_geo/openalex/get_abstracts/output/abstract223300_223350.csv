https://openalex.org/W1994442108,"A sudden increase in permeability of the inner mitochondrial membrane, the so-called mitochondrial permeability transition, is a common feature of apoptosis and is mediated by the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mtPTP). It is thought that the mtPTP is a protein complex formed by the voltage-dependent anion channel, members of the pro- and anti-apoptotic BAX-BCL2 protein family, cyclophilin D, and the adenine nucleotide (ADP/ATP) translocators (ANTs). The latter exchange mitochondrial ATP for cytosolic ADP and have been implicated in cell death. To investigate the role of the ANTs in the mtPTP, we genetically inactivated the two isoforms of ANT in mouse liver and analysed mtPTP activation in isolated mitochondria and the induction of cell death in hepatocytes. Mitochondria lacking ANT could still be induced to undergo permeability transition, resulting in release of cytochrome c. However, more Ca2+ than usual was required to activate the mtPTP, and the pore could no longer be regulated by ANT ligands. Moreover, hepatocytes without ANT remained competent to respond to various initiators of cell death. Therefore, ANTs are non-essential structural components of the mtPTP, although they do contribute to its regulation."

https://openalex.org/W1975301108,"EMMPRIN is a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed at high levels by tumor cells. It has been identified as a tumor-derived factor that can stimulate matrix metalloproteinase expression in fibroblasts and hence facilitate tumor invasion and metastasis. Recent studies have shown that full-length EMMPRIN is released by tumor cells, but the mechanism of release remains unclear. Here, we show that EMMPRIN is released from the surface of NCI-H460 cells via microvesicle shedding. However, these vesicles are unstable and rapidly break down to release bioactive EMMPRIN. Although microvesicle shedding has been considered a constitutive process in tumor cells, our data show that it can be amplified upon cell exposure to PMA, elucidating at least one signalling cascade responsible for EMMPRIN release. This pathway is dependent on protein kinase C, calcium mobilization and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK 1/2). Thus, the results outline a novel form of tumor-stromal interaction in which extracellular matrix degradation by fibroblasts is controlled through the microvesicular release of EMMPRIN from tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2031251703,"Actin polymerization, the main driving force for cell locomotion, is also used by the bacteria Listeria and Shigella and vaccinia virus for intracellular and intercellular movements. Seminal studies have shown the key function of the Arp2/3 complex in nucleating actin and generating a branched array of actin filaments during membrane extension and pathogen movement. Arp2/3 requires activation by proteins such as the WASP-family proteins or ActA of Listeria. We previously reported that actin tails of Rickettsia conorii, another intracellular bacterium, unlike those of Listeria, Shigella or vaccinia, are made of long unbranched actin filaments apparently devoid of Arp2/3 (ref. 4). Here we identify a R. conorii surface protein, RickA, that activates Arp2/3 in vitro, although less efficiently than ActA. In infected cells, Arp2/3 is detected on the rickettsial surface but not in actin tails. When expressed in mammalian cells and targeted to the membrane, RickA induces filopodia. Thus RickA-induced actin polymerization, by generating long actin filaments reminiscent of those present in filopodia, has potential as a tool for studying filopodia formation."

https://openalex.org/W2094580473,"The p38 branch of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade has been implicated as a regulator of cardiomyocyte apoptosis in culture as well as in the adult heart. However, considerable disagreement persists as to the functional effects attributed to p38 signaling, given that both pro- and anti-apoptotic regulatory roles have been reported. To address this area of uncertainty in the literature, we investigated the cell death effects associated with p38 inactivation in both cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes and the adult heart. In vitro, adenoviral-mediated gene transfer of two different dominant-negative-encoding p38 vectors reduced apoptosis induced by 2-deoxyglucose treatment, whereas overexpression of wild-type p38α or an activated mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MKK)6 mutant each enhanced cell death. In vivo, transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative MKK6 mutant or a dominant-negative p38α mutant were each significantly protected from ischemia-reperfusion injury, as assessed by infarct area measurements, DNA laddering, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling, and functional assessment of ventricular performance. Similarly, transgenic mice overexpressing the p38-inactivating dual specificity phosphatase MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) were also partially protected, whereas MKP-1 gene-targeted mice showed greater injury after ischemia-reperfusion injury. Mechanistically, inhibition of p38 signaling promoted a dramatic up-regulation of Bcl-2 in the hearts of transgenic mice. In primary neonatal cardiomyocyte cultures, adenoviral-mediated gene transfer of a p38 inhibitory mutant up-regulated Bcl-2, whereas expression of an activated p38 mutant down-regulated Bcl-2 protein levels. Collectively, these results indicate that p38 functions as a pro-death signaling effector in both cultured myocytes as well as in the intact heart.

Collectively, these results indicate that p38 functions as a pro-death signaling effector in both cultured myocytes as well as in the intact heart. An array of stress-responsive signaling pathways has been implicated in the regulation of cardiac apoptosis. A highly conserved component of myocyte stress-responsiveness involves signaling through a family of serine-threonine kinase effectors known as p38. Four separate p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAPKK, MAP kinase kinases; MEK or MKK, MAP kinase kinase; MKP-1, MAPK phosphatase-1; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling; AAR, area-at-risk; dn, dominant negative; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; IA, infarct area; I-R, ischemia-reperfusion; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; LAD, left anterior descending coronary artery; TTC, triphenyl tetrazolium chloride; NTG, non-transgenic; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-PCR. isoforms, including p38α, p38β, p38γ, and p38δ, have been identified. Each p38 isoform phosphorylates a diverse array of intracellular proteins including stress-responsive transcription factors (1Paul A. Wilson S. Belham C.M. Robinson C.J. Scott P.H. Gould G.W. Plevin R. Cell. Signalling. 1997; 9: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). p38 MAPKs are activated by chemical stress, physical stress, osmolar stress, radiation stress, mechanical deformation, and G-protein-coupled receptor activation (1Paul A. Wilson S. Belham C.M. Robinson C.J. Scott P.H. Gould G.W. Plevin R. Cell. Signalling. 1997; 9: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). MKK3 and MKK6 are MAP kinase kinases that function as upstream activators of p38 MAPK by directly phosphorylating the dual-site Thr-Gly-Tyr in p38 kinases (2Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). Upstream of MKK3 and MKK6, MAP kinase kinase kinase factors such as p21-activated kinase, transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase-1, and mixed lineage kinase-3 are activators that can respond to receptor activation and/or small GTP-binding proteins (2Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). The causative role that p38 signaling plays in regulating cardiomyocyte apoptosis is also an area of on-going investigation. Transfection of an activated MKK6 expression vector was shown to antagonize the apoptotic effects of anisomycin treatment or MAP kinase kinase kinase-1 co-transfection, suggesting that p38 MAPK activation is normally protective (3Zechner D. Craig R. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Sabbadini R.A. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8232-8239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The protective effect of MKK6 on cardiomyocytes was attributed, in part, to NFκB activation and α-B-crystallin phosphorylation (3Zechner D. Craig R. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Sabbadini R.A.

Similarly, norepinephrine-induced apoptosis of cultured cardiomyocytes was potentiated by a p38 MAPK pharmacologic inhibitor, also suggesting that p38 MAPK activation is normally protective to cardiac myocytes in culture (6Communal C. Colucci W.S. Singh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19395-19400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, a number of in vitro and in vivo reports have concluded the opposite, that p38 MAPK activation actually promotes cardiomyocyte apoptosis. In culture, ischemia, doxorubicin, or neuroendocrine stimulation-associated cell death was significantly protected by the addition of a p38 MAPK inhibitor (7Zhu W. Zou Y. Aikawa R. Harada K. Kudoh S.

Heart Fail. 2003; 5: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In isolated perfused heart preparations, a number of studies have suggested that p38 MAPK inhibitors protect the myocardium from ischemic damage (12Meldrum D.R. Dinarello C.A. Cleveland J.C.

Physiol. 2001; 280: H499-H508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with these reports, expression of an activated MKK3b mutant or p38α by adenoviral gene transfer each induced apoptosis of cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes (16Wang Y. Huang S. Sah V.P. Ross J. Brown J.H. Han J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2161-2168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Similarly, expression of transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase-1 in the mouse heart by transgenesis induced p38 activation that was associated with myocardial cell apoptosis in vivo (17Zhang D. Gaussin V. Taffet G.E. Belaguli N.S. Yamada M. Schwartz R.J. Michael L.H. Overbeek P.A. Schneider M.D. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 556-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), although expression of MKK3b in transgenic mice did not enhance basal apoptosis (18Liao P. Georgakopoulos D. Kovacs A. Zheng M. Lerner D. Pu H. Saffitz J. Chien K. Xiao R.P. Kass D.A Wang Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12283-12288Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Finally, p38α heterozygote mice were reported to be less susceptible to ischemia-reperfusion-induced injury (19Otsu K. Yamashita N. Nishida K. Hirotani S. Yamaguchi O. Watanabe T. Hikoso S. Higuchi Y. Matsumura Y. Maruyama M. Sudo T. Osada H. Hori M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 302: 56-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Potential reasons for these disparate findings could relate to nonspecific effects associated with the inhibitors SB202190 and SB203580, inherent differences between the various genetic models that were employed, or p38 isoform-specific effects. Given the disparate findings discussed above, we pursued both in vitro and in vivo model systems with unique reagents to more thoroughly address the issue of causation between p38 signaling and cardiac apoptosis. Recombinant adenovirus-expressing dominant-negative MKK3b, dominant-negative p38α, constitutively active MKK6b, and wild-type p38α were used to evaluate p38 MAPK function in cardiomyocyte apoptosis in vitro. More significantly, transgenic mice expressing dominant-negative p38α or dominant-negative MKK6 were evaluated for cardiac myocyte death after ischemia-reperfusion injury in vivo. Alternatively, MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) was also modulated in the heart by transgenesis or gene targeting to alter the potency of p38 signaling. Our results indicate that p38 signaling plays a causative role in regulating cardiomyocyte apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Cell Culture—Primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were generated and cultured as described previously (20De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Haq S. Force T. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13571-13579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Hearts were collected from 1- to 2-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat neonates, the atrial tissue was removed, and the ventricles were cut into four equal parts and enzymatically digested through multiple rounds in 0.05% pancreatin (Sigma) and 84 units/ml of collagenase (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ) in a balanced salt solution. The cells were centrifuged at 800 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C and resuspended in M199 media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml), and l-glutamine (2 mmol/liter). Afterward, the cells were differentially plated for 1 h on uncoated cell culture dishes to remove contaminating nonmyocytes. The enriched cardiomyocyte fractions (containing less than 10% nonmyocytes) were then plated on gelatinized dishes and cultured the following day in serum-free M199 media containing 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin and 2 mmol/liter l-glutamine. Cardiomyocytes were maintained in serum-free M199 media for 48 h before adenoviral infections and/or treatments. Replication-deficient Adenovirus Infection—The construction, characterization, and procedures for cardiomyocyte infections with replication-deficient adenovirus were performed as described previously (20De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Haq S. Force T. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13571-13579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In brief, all adenoviral constructs were sequenced and cloned into pACCMVpLpA to permit adenovirus production. The pACCMVpLpA construct was then cotransfected into HEK293 cells with pJM17 (21Gomez-Foix A.M. Coats W.S. Baque S. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25129-25134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All initial recombinant adenoviral vectors were plaque-purified in HEK293 cells, expanded, and titered by plaque assays in HEK293 monolayers embedded in agarose. Cardiomyocytes were infected with each virus at a multiplicity of infection of 100 plaque-forming units for 2 h at 37 °C in a humidified, 6% CO2 incubator. Afterward, the cultures were placed in serum-free M199 media for an additional 24 h prior to treatments. Under these conditions, ∼98% of the cells showed expression of the viral gene insert. Terminal Deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) and DNA Fragmentation—TUNEL of cultured cardiomyocytes was performed with the In Situ Cell Death Detection kit (Roche, Germany) as per manufacturer's instructions with slight modification (22De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Taigen T. Wencker D. Condorelli G. Dorn G.W. Kitsis R.N. Molkentin J.D. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In vitro TUNEL experiments were repeated three times, and one representative experiment is shown (see Fig. 1). Analysis of DNA fragmentation from adult hearts utilized ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction amplification performed according to the DNA ladder assay PCR kit procedure (MBI, San Francisco, CA). Sections were incubated with mouse monoclonal α-actinin antibody (Sigma) for identification of myocytes and counterstained with 5 ng/ml bisbenzamide for determination of nuclei. Only TUNEL-positive cells with α-actinin-labeled cytoplasms were counted in the determination of apoptosis. Western Blot Analysis—Protein extracts were generated from cardiomyocytes or whole heart using extraction buffer, as described previously (20De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Haq S. Force T. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13571-13579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Western blotting and enhanced chemifluorescence detection were performed as previously described (20De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Haq S. Force T. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13571-13579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Antibodies used included: anti-phospho-p38, anti-p38, anti-phospho-ERK1/2, anti-phospho-JNK1/2 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), anti-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-Bcl-2 (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD).

Flag epitope-tagged wild-type p38α, and dominant-negative p38α (T180A,Y182F) were a gift from Dr. Jiahuai Han, Scripps Institute, La Jolla, CA. Transgenic and Gene-targeted Mice—Transgenic mice expressing dominant-negative p38α, dnMKK6, and MKP-1 (FVB/N) were each described previously (23Bueno O.F. De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Tymitz K.M.

MKP-1 gene-targeted mice (C57BL/6) were kindly provided by Bristol-Myers Squibb, and their generation was described previously (25Dorfman K. Carrasco D. Gruda M. Ryan C. Lira S.A. Bravo R. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 925-931PubMed Google Scholar). Ischemia Reperfusion in Mice—Six-week-old FVB/N mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and the heart was exposed via a left thoracotomy. An 8-0 prolene suture was tied around the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) and tied with a slipknot. The thoracotomy was closed, and the mice were revived for a 60-min ischemic period, after which the knot was released and the heart was allowed to reperfuse for 24 h. Upon the completion of the reperfusion period, mice were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation and the hearts were quickly removed. The slipknot was retied, and 250 μl of 2% Evan's Blue in phosphate-buffered saline was injected into the left ventricle. Hearts were removed and embedded in 2% agarose phosphate-buffered saline, sectioned in 2- to 3-mm slices, and viable myocardium was stained with 2% triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC). Images of each slice were captured, and the amount of myocardial area not at risk (see Figs. 2 and 4, blue sections), area at risk (AAR, red and white sections), and infarcted area (IA, white sections) were quantified.Fig. 4Analysis of mice genetically altered in MKP-1 activity.

Reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) was performed on 2 μg of total RNA using random hexamers following the Superscript III cDNA synthesis system (Invitrogen). Final cDNA was diluted 1:2, and 3 μl of each was used for subsequent PCRs. Bcl-2 was amplified by using the primers of the sequence 5′-TTCGGTGTAACTAAAGACAC and 3′-CTCAAAGAAGGCCACAATCC in conjunction with a thermal cycling program consisting of 94 °C/35 s, 55 °C/35 s, and 72 °C/75 s for 35 cycles. Echocardiography of Mice—Mice subjected to ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) were allowed to recover for up to 34 days. Periodically, these mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and echocardiography was performed to determine cardiac performance as well as physical dimensions of the left ventricle. Echocardiography was performed as three independent measures per mouse in M-mode using a Hewlett Packard Sonos 5500 instrument and a 15 MHz transducer. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as means (± S.E.). Differences between experimental groups were evaluated for statistical significance using a Student's t test for unpaired data or one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's post-test. p < 0.050 was considered to be statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed by using Instat version 3.0 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Generation of p38 MAPK Branch-specific Adenoviruses—Given the lack of consensus in the literature regarding a role for p38 MAPK as a regulator of cardiomyocyte apoptosis, we first employed an adenoviral-based strategy to manipulate p38 MAPK activity in culture without using pharmacologic inhibitors. Western blotting confirmed efficient protein expression from cardiomyocytes infected with adenoviruses expressing activated MKK6, wild-type p38α, dominant-negative MKK3, and dominant-negative p38α (data not shown). Each adenovirus was assessed for its ability to alter p38 MAPK signaling in cultured cardiomyocytes. Cultures were either infected with a control β-galactosidase-expressing adenovirus (Adβgal), or a p38 MAPK-affecting adenovirus. Twenty-four hours after infection, cultures were stimulated with anisomycin to induce MAPK activation. Western blotting of protein extracts demonstrated that anisomycin induced phosphorylation of p38, ERK1/2, and JNK1/2 in uninfected or Adβgal-infected cultures (Fig. 1A). However, infection with an adenovirus encoding dominant-negative (dn) MKK3 (Ad-dnMKK3) or dn-p38α (Ad-dn-p38α) each blocked p38 MAPK phosphorylation without affecting ERK1/2 or JNK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 1A). In contrast, AdMKK6 infection promoted greater p38 MAPK phosphorylation, without affecting ERK1/2 or JNK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 1A). To address the role of p38 signaling in cardiomyocyte apoptosis, TUNEL was quantified in adenoviral infected neonatal cardiomyocytes as an indictor of cell death at baseline. The data demonstrate that activated AdMKK6 and wild-type p38α each significantly increase baseline TUNEL at 24 h (Fig. 1B, p < 0.05). However, adenoviral-mediated expression of dnMKK3 or dn-p38α had no significant effect on TUNEL at baseline (Fig. 1B). Cell death was further exacerbated with 2-deoxyglucose in glucose-free and serum-free media, as described previously (22De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Taigen T. Wencker D. Condorelli G. Dorn G.W. Kitsis R.N. Molkentin J.D. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Cardiomyocyte cultures were transferred into 2-deoxyglucose media 24 h after adenoviral infection and incubated for an additional 16 h. The results show a mild protective effect of dnMKK3b and dn-p38α (Fig. 1C, p < 0.05). Conversely, adenoviral-mediated expression of wild-type p38α significantly enhanced 2-deoxyglucose-induced TUNEL (Fig. 1C, p < 0.05). Similar results were obtained in two independent experiments. Collectively, these results suggest that p38 MAPK signaling potentiates cardiomyocyte apoptosis in culture. DnMKK6 and dn-p38α Transgenic Mice Are Partially Protected from I-R Injury—We extended our analysis of p38 signaling and apoptosis causation to the adult heart by employing a transgenic strategy in the mouse. Mice expressing dnMKK6 and dn-p38α in the heart were described previously and shown to have a significant reduction in p38 activation after agonist stimulation in vivo (24Braz J.C. Bueno O.F. Liang Q. Wilkins B.J. Dai Y-S. Parsons S. Braunwart J. Glascock B.J. Klevitsky R. Kimball T.F. Hewett T.E. Molkentin J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 1475-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Here we extended our analysis to assess p38 activation during an ischemic insult to the myocardium. To first observe the effect of the dn mutants on p38 phosphorylation, mice underwent LAD occlusion for 10 min in vivo, after which the hearts were excised and used to generate protein extracts for Western blotting. This brief ischemic episode induced robust p38 phosphorylation in the hearts of non-transgenic mice, whereas activation was substantially reduced in dnMKK6 and dn-p38α transgenic mice (Fig. 2A). Measurements of p38 phosphorylation after 60 min of ischemia showed only minimal inductions at this later time point, compared with sham animals, and did not vary between dn and non-transgenic (NTG) mice (data not shown). Total p38 protein levels were equivalent between samples, albeit the dn-p38α mice had significantly more protein detected with the p38 antibody, as expected (Fig. 2A). Western blotting for α-tubulin showed equivalent protein loading between samples (Fig. 2A). Collectively, these results show significant inhibition of p38 signaling in the two transgenic models employed here. Expression of dn-p38α or dnMKK6 had no effect on ERK1/2 or JNK1/2 activation characteristics in the heart, which is consistent with previous observations (24Braz J.C. Bueno O.F. Liang Q. Wilkins B.J. Dai Y-S. Parsons S. Braunwart J. Glascock B.J. Klevitsky R. Kimball T.F. Hewett T.E. Molkentin J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 1475-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The two transgenic lines and strain-matched wild-type mice were next subjected to a longer, 60-min ischemic episode followed by 4-24 h of reperfusion to assess the area of infarction and the degree of DNA fragmentation in the heart. Remarkably, dnMKK6 and dn-p38α transgenic mice each showed a greater than 50% reduction in IA normalized to AAR (AAR was not different between the groups), compared with NTG control mice (Fig. 2, B and C, p < 0.05). NTG mice also showed greater DNA fragmentation compared with either transgenic line, indicating greater cellular apoptosis (Fig. 2D; a total of 10 wild-type, 6 dn-p38α, and 6 dnMKK6 mice were analyzed, although a smaller representation of DNA fragmentation is shown). These results indicate that inhibition of p38 activation protects the myocardium from acute I-R-induced cell death. In support of the enhanced DNA fragmentation discussed above, wild-type hearts showed greater levels of TUNEL reactivity in the non-infarcted remote myocardium 34 days after ischemic injury compared with dnMKK6 hearts (Fig. 3A). Mice were also analyzed 20 and 34 days after ischemic injury by echocardiography for alterations in fractional shortening, which reflects the degree of myocardial injury as well as the degree of secondary remodeling and failure. Only dnMKK6 mice were analyzed here, given that they maintain a normal phenotype throughout the instituted study period, whereas dn-p38α transgenic mice began to show signs of spontaneous hypertrophy at baseline by 8-12 weeks of age, which might have confounded the echocardiographic assessment of function (24Braz J.C. Bueno O.F. Liang Q. Wilkins B.J. Dai Y-S. Parsons S. Braunwart J. Glascock B.J. Klevitsky R. Kimball T.F. Hewett T.E. Molkentin J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 1475-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Compared with sham-operated mice of each genotype, wild-type mice showed a significant reduction in fractional shortening at both time points analyzed, whereas dnMKK6 mice were protected (Fig. 3B; p < 0.05, n = 12 wild-type and 17 transgenic mice analyzed in total). Masson's trichrome staining also showed more intracellular fibrosis in the wild-type hearts were subjected to I-R injury compared with the transgenic hearts (Fig. 3C). No difference in heart weights or body weights was seen between NTG and dnMKK6 mice at the completion of the study (34 days after ischemic injury). Taken together, these results suggest that inhibition of p38 signaling protects the myocardium from apoptotic injury and infarction expansion, which secondarily preserves myocardial function and reduces secondary remodeling associated with fibrosis. Assessment of I-R Injury in MKP-1 Genetically Modified Mice—MKP-1 is a dual-specificity phosphatase that preferentially dephosphorylates and inactivates p38 and JNK in the nucleus (26Franklin C.C. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16917-16923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that MKP-1-overexpressing transgenic mice show significant inhibition of p38 and JNK activation in the heart at baseline or following agonist stimulation (23Bueno O.F. De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Tymitz K.M. Witt S.A. Kimball K.R. Molkentin J.D. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 88-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Consistent with these past observations, 10 min of ischemia induced prominent p38 phosphorylation in the heart, which was significantly inhibited in MKP-1 transgenic mice (Fig. 4A). Total p38 protein levels did not vary (Fig. 4A). Next, MKP-1 transgenic mice were subjected to I-R injury (60-min ischemia and 24-h reperfusion), and the degree of infarction was quantified, demonstrating a significant reduction in injury compared with strain-matched NTG controls (Fig. 4, B and C). In contrast, MKP-1 gene-targeted mice showed greater infarction injury compared with strain-matched wild-type control mice (Fig. 4, B and C). Although MKP-1 regulates both p38 and JNK signaling, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the stress-activated protein kinases play a conserved role as pro-apoptotic mediators, partially through p38 (see “Discussion”). Bcl-2 Expression Is Regulated by p38—To begin to explore the potential mechanisms whereby inhibition of p38 signaling might protect the myocardium from ischemia-reperfusion-induced apoptosis we surveyed the activity or expression levels of numerous cell-death regulatory proteins. This survey identified a remarkable increase in Bcl-2 expression in the hearts of dn-p38α transgenic mice. Using RT-PCR, dn-p38α mice showed a greater than 3-fold increase in Bcl-2 transcript levels compared with wild-type litter"

They achieve this by learning visual cues, such as the location and colour of nectar-bearing flowers, and chemical cues, such as the scent and the taste of the nectar. Here we train bees to visit differently scented sugar feeders placed at specific outdoor locations and find that they can be induced to visit the same locations simply by having the corresponding scent blown into the hive, even when the destinations no longer have the food or carry the scent. A familiar nectar scent can trigger specific memories of a route and therefore expedite navigation to the food source."

Chem. 2001; 276: 33066-33078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In this Ca2+-dependent transamidation reaction, an acyl residue, derived from the γ-carboxamide group of a peptide-bound glutamine (acyl donor), is transferred to an appropriate primary amine, most commonly the ϵ-amino group of lysine residues (acyl acceptor) (3Folk J.E. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1983; 54: 1-56PubMed Google Scholar). A catalytic triad involving cysteine 277, histidine 335, and aspartic acid 358 forms the active site of TG2 (4Liu S. Cerione R.A. Clardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2743-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In the first step, the side chain of a glutamine residue forms a thioester with the active site cysteine, and ammonia is released (acylation). In the following transamidation step, the activated acyl group is transferred to the acyl acceptor amine, forming an isopeptide bond (deacylation). Alternatively, hydrolysis of the thioester bond leads to deamidation, converting the glutamine into a glutamic acid residue. The food-sensitive enteropathy celiac disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder with a multifactorial etiology (5Sollid L.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 53-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 6Schuppan D. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 234-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). In patients with CD, ingestion of wheat gluten and related proteins of barley and rye induces mucosal lymphocyte infiltration and villous atrophy. CD demonstrates a strong genetic association with the genes encoding for HLA-DQ2 and -DQ8 (5Sollid L.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 53-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Gluten-reactive CD4+ T cells have been isolated from the small intestine of CD patients and are almost exclusively restricted by either of these HLA molecules (7Lundin K.E.A. Scott H. Hansen T.

Immunol. 2000; 18: 53-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The gluten-reactive T cells of the celiac lesion predominantly recognize modified gluten peptides in which distinct glutamines have been deamidated and thereby converted to glutamic acid residues (9Sjöström H.

Accumulating evidence suggests that this deamidation and formation of gluten-derived T cell epitopes in the intestinal mucosa is mediated by TG2 (10Molberg O. McAdam S.N. Körner R. Quarsten H.

Although the transamidation reaction has a higher rate than the deamidation reaction at neutral pH (3Folk J.E. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1983; 54: 1-56PubMed Google Scholar), the rate of the deamidation reaction is increased at lower pH (13Fleckenstein B. Molberg O. Qiao S.W. Schmid D.G. von der Mulbe F. Elgstoen K. Jung G. Sollid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34109-34116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), such as in the proximal small intestine (14Evans D.F. Pye G. Bramley R. Clark A.G. Dyson T.J. Hardcastle J.D. Gut. 1988; 29: 1035-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). The sequence specificity of TG2 toward acyl donor substrates was recently elucidated (13Fleckenstein B. Molberg O. Qiao S.W. Schmid D.G. von der Mulbe F. Elgstoen K. Jung G. Sollid L.M. J. Biol.

Med. 2002; 195: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), and studies on the affinity of TG2 for various gliadin peptides suggested that TG2 is directly involved in the selection of gluten T cell epitopes (13Fleckenstein B. Molberg O. Qiao S.W. Schmid D.G. von der Mulbe F. Elgstoen K. Jung G. Sollid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34109-34116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Patients with active CD have autoantibodies to TG2 (16Dieterich W. Ehnis T. Bauer M. Donner P. Volta U. Riecken E.O. Schuppan D. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar), which are highly disease-specific and whose formation is dependent on ingestion of gluten. Notably, TG2 itself was described to be involved in covalent complex formation with gluten-derived peptides in the presence of calcium (6Schuppan D. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 234-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 17Schuppan D. Dieterich W. Ehnis T. Bauer M. Donner P. Volta U. Riecken E.O. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 859: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Those TG2-gliadin peptide complexes have been suggested to act as hapten-carrier complexes, which could explain the typical antibody response against TG2 in untreated CD patients (18Sollid L.M. Molberg Ø. McAdam S. Lundin K.E.A. Gut. 1997; 41: 851-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In this model the complexes are taken up after binding to the immunoglobulin receptor of TG2-specific B cells. Subsequently the gliadin peptide cargo is presented and recognized by gliadin-specific T cells, which give help to the B cells to secrete TG2-specific antibodies. However, little is known about the formation and the molecular nature of these TG2-gluten peptide complexes. The aim of the current study was to investigate the complex formation between TG2 and two immunodominant gliadin-derived T cell epitopes. Because these peptides contain glutamine but no lysine residues, TG2 will act as an acyl acceptor in these experiments. Our experiments allowed quantitation of the number of gliadin peptides covalently bound to TG2 under different conditions and demonstrated the chemical nature of this linkage. After proteolytic digestion of these complexes, the sites of the modified lysine residues within TG2 were identified by mass spectrometry. Definition and Synthesis of Peptides—The following peptides were synthesized: peptide QLQPFPQPQLPY (defined as αI, corresponding to α9-gliadin-(57–68)), the deamidated derivative α9-gliadin-(57–68) E65 (QLQPFPQPELPY, defined as αIE), the N-terminal-biotinylated analogues of peptides αI and αIE (B-αI and B-αIE, respectively), the N-terminal fluorescein-labeled analogue of peptide αI (F-αI), and peptide PQPQLPYPQPQLPY (defined as αII, corresponding to α2-gliadin-(62–75)). Peptides were prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis on a robotic system (Syro MultiSynTech, Bochum, Germany) using Fmoc/O-tert-butyl chemistry and 2-chlorotrityl resin (Senn Chemicals AG, Dielsdorf, Switzerland) (19Jung G. Beck-Sickinger A.G. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1992; 31: 367-383Crossref Scopus (294) Google Scholar). A 5-fold molar excess of Fmoc-l-amino acids was used for coupling. For biotinylation and fluorescein labeling of peptides, biotin or carboxyfluorescein (3 eq each, both from Sigma) was coupled to the free N-terminal amino group of the resin-bound, protected peptides using diisopropylcarbodiimide (5eq) as coupling reagent. The identity of all peptides was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry, and purity was analyzed by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. The 125I-radiolabeling at the C-terminal Tyr residue of peptide αI was performed using the chloramines T method (20Greenwood F.C. Hunter W.H. Glover J.S. Biochem. J. 1963; 89: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (6739) Google Scholar). Production of Tissue Transglutaminase—Human TG2 was expressed as a GST fusion protein in Escherichia coli using the vector construct as described (21Lai T.S. Slaughter T.F. Koropchak C.M. Haroon Z.A. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31191-31195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Thus, “TG2” in this paper stands for the GST-TG2 fusion protein. The protein concentration of the GST-TG2 preparation was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay, a modified Bradford assay. To obtain data as accurate as possible, the sequence homolog guinea pig TG2 (Sigma) was used as a standard. Detection of TG2-Peptide Complexes by SDS-PAGE—Biotinylated peptides B-αI and B-αIE were incubated at concentrations indicated with 1 μm TG2 at 37 °C in phosphate-buffered saline, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, for 2 h. In one sample, TG2 was inactivated by incubation with 10 mm iodoacetamide for 15 min at room temperature, before incubation with peptide. The samples were added to Laemmli buffer containing 1% β-mercaptoethanol and 2% SDS, heated at 97 °C for 3 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE separation with 0.1% SDS in the running buffer. The proteins were blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (OPTITRAN BA-S 85, 0.45 μm, Schleicher & Schuell) by using 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol. After blocking of unspecific binding (5 mm EDTA, 2% dry milk powder in 50 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, pH 8.0, for 20 min), the membrane was incubated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Southern Biotechnology, 1:10,000) for 60 min and washed by 50 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, pH 8.0 (4 times × 10 min). Fluorescent reagents (Amersham Biosciences) were added, and autofluorescence was detected by exposure to a film (Scientific Imagin film, Kodak X-Omat™ AR). Mini Spin Columns—In the kinetics study 2.5 μm TG2 was incubated at 37 °C in phosphate-buffered saline, 2 mm CaCl2 with minute amounts of radiolabeled 125I-αI or 125I-αIE together with 100 μm unlabeled αI or αIE, respectively. After incubation, the peptide-TG2 complexes were separated from unbound peptides on Sephadex G50 Superfine (Amersham Biosciences) spin columns equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% NaN3, which was used as the running buffer throughout the experiment. Preparation of the spin columns and separations were performed as described (22Buus S. Stryhn A. Winther K. Kirkby N. Pedersen L.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1243: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Just before separation columns (1-ml pipette tips closed by small cotton plugs) were packed with Sephadex G50 Superfine (swelled in the running buffer) and spun semi-dry (1500 rpm, 593 × g for 5 min, Sigma 4–10P, rotor 11140), resulting in a 650-μl gel bed volume. Samples (15 μl) were gently pipetted on top of the gel matrix, and columns were spun by an adapted protocol (linear acceleration 0–3500 rpm (2150 × g) within 8 min followed by 3500 rpm for 2 min). Radioactivity in the void volume and in the columns was counted by a γ-counter (Wallac, Turku, Finland). The counts were converted to an average number of gliadin peptides bound per TG2 molecule as follows: number of peptides/TG2 = [void count/(column count + void count)] × [mol of peptide/mol of TG2]. In the peptide titration studies, 1 μm TG2 was incubated with different concentrations of peptide αI for 30 min at 37 °C. Samples were either directly analyzed by spin column experiments or further treated with 10 mm hydroxylamine, pH 7.4, or 10 mm hydroxylamine, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.9, before spin column separation. Capillary Electrophoresis—To quantify deamidation of peptide αI, 1 μm TG2 was incubated for 30 min with the fluorescein-labeled peptide F-αI under conditions identical to those applied in spin column experiments. The deamidated product F-αIE was separated and quantified by micellar electrokinetic chromatography and laser-induced fluorescence detection at 488 nm (Beckman MDQ capillary electrophoresis system) as described (13Fleckenstein B. Molberg O. Qiao S.W. Schmid D.G. von der Mulbe F. Elgstoen K. Jung G. Sollid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34109-34116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were injected by pressure (0.5 p.s.i., 5 s) into a fused-silica capillary (25 cm in length, 75 μm inner diameter) equilibrated by three rinsing steps using 100 mm sodium hydroxide, water, and electrophoresis buffer (64 mm sodium borate, 20 mm sodium dodecyl sulfate, pH 9.3) (20 p.s.i., 1.5 min in each step). Separations were performed at 22 kV at room temperature, and samples were run from the cathode to the anode. All experiments were performed at least in duplicate. Chemical Modification of Lysine Residues within GST-TG2—An aliquot of GST-TG2 was dialyzed against reaction buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2) supplemented with 10 mm EDTA (Micro-dialyzing system, Pierce). GST-TG2 (2.1 mg, 21 nmol) was dissolved in 700 μl of reaction buffer, and N-[γ-maleimidobutyryloxy]succinimide ester (Pierce; 80 μl of 10 mm, dissolved in 100% Me2SO) was added and incubated for 30 min. The sample was dialyzed against reaction buffer/10 mm EDTA and incubated with the control peptide CLRMKLPQPELPYPQPELPY (200 μl 1 mm) for 120 min. After the addition of 100 mm cysteine (in 0.1 m Tris/Cl, pH 7.0) for 30 min, the modified GST-TG2 was dialyzed against 10 mm NH4HCO3 and lyophilized. For digestion, modified GST-TG2 (30 pmol) was incubated with trypsin (1 μg, Promega) in 50 mm NH4HCO3 (65 μl total) for 24 h at 37 °C, and proteolytic fragments were analyzed by MALDI-TOF and ESI mass spectrometry. In-gel Digestion—Protein bands corresponding to GST-TG2-peptide complexes (104 kDa) were excised from the Coomassie-stained polyacrylamide gel and cut into several pieces. The pieces were washed twice by acetonitrile/water 1:1 (v/v) (20 min each) and acetonitrile (20 min each) and dried in a SpeedVac. Proteins were reduced by swelling the gel particles in 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 m NH4HCO3 (30 min, 56 °C). Excess liquid was removed, and thiol groups were alkylated by adding 55 mm iodoacetamide, 0.1 m NH4HCO3 (30 min at room temperature in the dark). Gel particles were washed and dried as described above. A digestion buffer composed of 12.5 ng/μl of trypsin (Promega, modified, sequencing grade) in 50 mm NH4HCO3 was added, and samples were kept on ice for 30 min to allow rehydration of the gel particles with limited autoproteolysis of trypsin. The remaining supernatant was replaced by 50 mm NH4HCO3, and tryptic digestion was carried out overnight at 37 °C. Mass Spectrometry—Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectra were acquired on a Bruker Reflex II MALDI-TOF instrument (Bruker-Daltonik, Bremen, Germany). Electrospray ionization tandem mass spectra were recorded on a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, England). Tryptic peptide mixtures were desalted and concentrated on Poros 20 R2 reverse-phase packing sorbent (Applied Biosystems) packed in GELoader tips (Eppendorf). For ESI mass spectrometry, samples were eluted into nanoelectrospray needles (Protana Engineering, Odense, Denmark) as previously described (23Neubauer G. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). For spraying, needles were typically held at 800 V toward a skimmer cone (40 V). In collision-induced dissociation experiments (collision gas argon, manifold pressure ∼8 × 10-15 millibar, collision energy 32–40 eV) product ions were analyzed by the orthogonal TOF analyzer. Detection of Covalent TG2-Peptide Complexes by SDS-PAGE—TG2 was incubated for 2 h with 5–300 μm N-terminalbiotinylated gliadin peptide, QLQPFPQPQLPY (B-αI). The reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli buffer containing 1% β-mercaptoethanol and a heating step, and samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Specific detection of the biotin moiety on the following blot resulted in a distinct band corresponding to the molecular weight of the GST-TG2 fusion protein (104 kDa) (Fig. 1). The intensity of the signal gradually increased with higher peptide concentrations, reaching a plateau at 150 μm. A very weak band was observed at 20 μm, whereas no signal was visible at 5 μm. Glutamine 65 in peptide αI is known to be specifically deamidated by TG2 (24Arentz-Hansen H. Korner R. Molberg O. Quarsten H. Vader W. Kooy Y.M. Lundin K.E.A. Koning F. Roepstorff P. Sollid L.M. McAdam S.N. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Substitution of that glutamine for a glutamic acid residue (peptide B-αIE) resulted in a complete loss of the 104-kDa-band even when B-αIE was used at 150 μm. The same negative result was obtained when TG2 was treated with iodoacetamide (10 mm,15 min) before incubation with peptide, leading to an irreversible alkylation of cysteine residues in TG2 (data not shown). Quantitation of Peptides Bound to TG2—TG2-αI-complex formation was studied quantitatively by using a 125I-labeled derivative of αI as a tracer peptide during incubation. Samples were loaded on a miniaturized gel filtration column, and free peptides were separated from generated TG2-peptide complexes and the unmodified enzyme. The high molecular weight components were detected exclusively in the void volume as shown by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A). The peptide fraction, however, was retained in the gel matrix, as proved by measuring the radioactivity in the void volume and the remaining column. After incubation of TG2 with peptide αI, radioactivity in these two compartments was counted, and the molar amount of peptide in the void volume was calculated. Together with the known amount of TG2, the average number of peptides bound to a single TG2-molecule could be determined. In a first kinetic study, TG2 (2.5 μm) was incubated in the presence of calcium with a 40-fold molar excess of peptide αI, and the average number of peptides bound to TG2 was determined after different time intervals (Fig. 2B). Complex formation was found to occur rapidly. After 5 and 10 min, about 1.2 and 1.9 αI peptides per TG2 molecule were calculated, respectively. A maximum of 2.8 peptides/TG2 was observed between 30 and 60 min of incubation time. Interestingly, a slight but continuous decrease of this ratio was found during further incubation, reaching a value of 2.1 peptides/TG2 after 240 min. No radioactivity was found in the void volume if TG2 was treated by iodoacetamide before incubation with peptide αI (data not shown). Subsequently, TG2 (1 μm) was incubated with a 0.5–250-fold molar excess of peptide αI (Fig. 2C). An incubation time of 30 min was chosen to allow maximal complex formation (Fig. 2B). For an equimolar ratio, an average number of about 0.2 peptides/TG2 was found. The titration curve showed a maximal slope between 10 μm (1.1 peptides/TG2) and 60 μm (3.8 peptides/TG2). At a 40-fold molar excess, 3.0 peptides were determined to be bound to TG2, consistent with the result from Fig. 2B (2.8 peptides/TG2 for an identical incubation time and molar excess). The titration curve reached a plateau at 100–150-fold molar excess, where a maximal number of 4.2 peptides/TG2 was obtained. Isopeptide and Thioester Bonds in TG2-Peptide Complexes— In the TG2-peptide complexes described so far (Figs. 1, 2B, and 2C), peptide αI could be bound via a thioester bond to C-277 in the active site of the enzyme or via isopeptide bonds involving lysine resides of TG2. To quantify these two peptide fractions, TG2 (1 μm) was incubated with peptide αI for 30 min followed by treatment with hydroxylamine at pH 7.4 or 8.9. The nucleophile hydroxylamine specifically cleaves thioester but not amide bonds. The hydroxylamine treatment led to a slight decrease of the total number of peptides bound to TG2, as shown by spin column analysis (Fig. 2D). The observed difference between both graphs corresponds to peptides bound via thioester bonds to TG2. At peptide concentrations between 45 and 135 μm, 1 μmol of TG2 carried about 0.5 to 0.7 μmol of peptide αI linked via thioester bonds. With decreasing concentrations of peptide αI the relative amount of thioester-bound peptides continually increased (Fig. 2E). After incubation with 1 μm peptide αI, hydroxylamine treatment removed about 50% of the bound radioactivity, indicating that peptide αI is bound in similar amounts via thioester and isopeptide linkage. Thus, both thioester and isopeptide bond formation take place over a broad concentration range. To address whether the thiol to amine exchange reaction for the formation of isopeptide bonded complexes is intermolecular, we studied the backward reaction by adding extra TG2 to isolated TG2-peptide αI complexes in a 5-fold molar excess. This, however, did not cause an accelerated decay of the reaction shown in Fig. 2B as it would be expected from an inter-molecular thiol to amine exchange reaction. Complex Formation Versus Deamidation—To quantify the deamidation reaction taking place concurrently to complex formation, samples in which peptide αI was replaced by its fluorescein-labeled derivative F-αI were incubated under identical conditions. Samples were analyzed by micellar electrokinetic chromatography. Incubation for 30 min with 200 μm F-αI resulted in 37 μm F-αIE (Fig. 2C), which still increased at longer incubation times (data not shown). However, at lower peptide concentrations the ratio between TG2-bound peptides (both thioester and isopeptide-linked) and deamidated peptides clearly increased. At 10 μm, about 1.1 μm peptides were detected in the complex, and 4.3 μm were deamidated. At 1 μm, the amounts of covalently bound (0.2 μm) and deamidated peptides (0.33 μm) were almost identical. Under those conditions half of the bound peptides are linked via thioesters (Fig. 2E), meaning that only 0.1 μm (19%) of all converted peptides (0.53 μm) were isopeptide-linked. With increasing peptide concentrations, however, isopeptide bond formation became a rather infrequent event compared with thioester hydrolysis. Identification of Acyl Acceptor Sites within TG2 by Mass Spectrometry—Next we identified which lysine residues in the GST-TG2 fusion protein are involved in isopeptide bond formation to the targeted glutamine residue in peptide αI. After incubation of TG2 (1 μm) with peptide αI at molar ratios of 1:1, 1:10, 1:50, and 1:150, complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE. The band corresponding to TG2-peptide complexes and unmodified TG2 (these are not separated under the conditions used) was cut out from the Coomassie-stained gel and subjected to in-gel digestion by trypsin. Digests were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in the reflector and linear mode, and spectra were searched for masses characteristic for tryptic fragments from GST-TG2 cross-linked to peptide αI. Theoretically expected masses were calculated by excluding tryptic cleavage C-terminal of a lysine residue involved in isopeptide bond formation and by allowing one missed cleavage site in the GST-TG2-derived peptide. In the MALDI-TOF mass spectrum obtained after incubating peptide αI with TG2 in a 50-fold molar excess, six masses characteristic for the cross-linked tryptic fragments I–VI were found (Fig. 3, Table I). Because peptide αI carries an N-terminal glutamine residue, all six signals are preceded by a typical -17-Da signal due to pyroglutamate formation of that residue.Table IIdentified lysine residues of TG2 involved in covalent complex formation with two α-gliadin peptides The table reports the m/z values of six tryptic TG2 peptides that are cross-linked by isopeptide bonds to either peptide αIor αII.

Previous studies highlight the importance of collagen turnover in this process, yet it is unclear which factors control scleral remodeling. This study used a mammalian model of myopia to investigate the capacity of TGF (transforming growth factor)-beta1, -beta2, and -beta3 to influence scleral remodeling in myopia. RT-PCR confirmed the presence of all mammalian TGF-beta isoforms in scleral tissue and scleral fibroblasts. Myopia was experimentally induced via monocular deprivation of pattern vision, and animals were allocated to two groups depending on the duration of treatment (1 or 5 days). Down-regulation of each isoform was apparent after only 1 day of myopia development (TGF-beta1, -32%; TGF-beta2, -27%; TGF-beta3, -42%). Whereas the decrease in TGF-beta1 and -beta3 expression was relatively constant between the two time points, differential down-regulation of TGF-beta2 was found between days 1 (-27%) and 5 (-50%). In vitro experiments, using primary scleral fibroblasts, demonstrated the capacity of all isoforms to increase collagen production in a dose-dependent manner. Changes in TGF-beta levels, which mimicked those during myopia induction, caused an approximately 15% reduction in collagen synthesis, which is qualitatively similar to those previously reported in vivo. These data represent the first demonstration of TGF-beta3 expression in the sclera and implicate all three TGF-beta isoforms in the control of scleral remodeling during myopia development. In addition, the early alterations in TGF-beta expression levels may reflect a role for these cytokines in mediating the retinoscleral signal that controls myopic eye growth."

Wnt proteins are cysteine-rich secreted glycoproteins serving as extracellular signaling molecules, which play significant roles in normal and pathological developmental processes (1Peifer M. Polakis P. Science. 2000; 287: 1606-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). Based on their biological activities, vertebrate Wnts have been classified into two functional groups with separate downstream signaling pathways. While members of the Wnt-1 class (such as Wnt-1, -2, -3, and -8) commonly stimulate the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway that controls cell fate and proliferation, members of the Wnt-5a class (such as Wnt-4, -5a, and -11) stimulate the noncanonical Wnt pathways such as the Wnt/Ca2+ (2Wodarz A.

Inhibition of GSK-3β activity by activated Dvl-1 leads to the stabilization of β-catenin (for a review, see Ref. 10Seidensticker M.J. Behrens J. Biochim. Biophys.

Previously we have molecularly cloned the human Frizzled 1 (HFz1) and 6 (HFz6) and showed that HFz1 efficiently transduced the Wnt-3a-induced canonical signaling in mammalian cells (19Gazit A.

Here we show that, unlike HFz1, HFz6 did not transduce the canonical Wnt pathway upon exposure to various Wnts. Furthermore our findings showed that enforced expression of HFz6 down-regulated the transmission of Wnt-3a-induced canonical signaling via HFz1. In addition, we present data suggesting that HFz6 represses the canonical Wnt pathway by transmitting an antagonistic signaling cascade. Moreover the results suggest that HFz6 activates the TAK1-NLK pathway, thus blocking TCF transcriptional activity by interfering with the binding of TCF·β-catenin complex to target DNA.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—HFz6 cDNA (GenBank™ accession number AF072873), previously cloned by us from a human breast AB589 cDNA library prepared in pCEV27 vector, is described elsewhere (20Lorenzi M.V.

RNA (20 μg) was resolved on a 1.2% agarose gel containing 6% formaldehyde and transferred to nylon membrane (Hybond™-N, Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was prehybridized in hybridization solution (50% formamide, 5× SSC, 4× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA) for 4 h at 42 °C and then hybridized for 18 h with the full-length coding region of HFz6 radiolabeled DNA probe. The probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using NEBlot kit (New England BioLabs). The membrane was washed three times at 25 °C in 1× SSC, 0.5% SDS for 15 min and subjected to autoradiography.Subcellular Fractionation—Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were prepared as described previously (26Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9142) Google Scholar). 293T cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in cold buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics). Resuspended cells were lysed in 0.5% Nonidet P-40 for 15 min followed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min. Following separation of the cytoplasmic fraction, the nuclei were harvested by resuspension in ice-cold buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 m mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol) followed by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Total cell lysates were prepared by solubilization in lysing buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.2% Nonidet P-40). Nuclear and cytosolic fractions were prepared as described above. Following SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and after blocking with 5% low fat milk, filters were incubated with the specific primary antibody. Membranes were washed in 0.001% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 45 min with a secondary antibody. After washing in Tween/phosphate-buffered saline, membranes were subjected to enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection analysis (Amersham Biosciences) using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For co-immunoprecipitation analysis, cells were solubilized in lysing buffer (see above), and extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. 4 mg of total cell lysates were incubated with the specific antibody for 18 h at 4 °C and then incubated, with rotation, with protein A beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were collected by centrifugation, washed three times in lysing buffer, dissolved in Laemmli buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by detection with each specific antibody. Anti-β-catenin, -c-Myc, and -Cyclin E monoclonal antibodies, anti-Cyclin D1, -β-actin, and -HA polyclonal antibodies, and anti-goat, -rabbit, and -mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody and anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel were purchased from Sigma.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—The TCF probe (wild type), spanning three potential TCF/LEF binding sites, was a double-stranded 40-nucleotide oligomer prepared by annealing a forward 5′-GGGGCCTTTGATCCCTTTGATCCCTTTGATCCCTTTGATC-3′ oligonucleotide and its reverse form 5′-GGGGGATCAAAGGGATCAAAGGGATCAAAGGGATCAAAGG-3′. The mutant probe was prepared by annealing the mutated forward 5′-GGGGCCTTTGGCCCCTTTGGCCCCTTTGGCCCCTTTGGCC-3′ and its reverse 5′-GGGGGGCCAAAGGGGCCAAAGGGGCCAAAGGGGCCAAAGG-3′ oligonucleotides. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described above. Binding reactions were done on ice for 10 min by incubating 6 μg of nuclear lysates and 0.022 pmol of labeled double-stranded wild type or mutant probe in 15 μl of binding buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8, 300 mm KCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, and 0.75 μg of poly(dI-dC)). Competition analyses were performed with an excess (1.0 pmol) of unlabeled probe. Supershift analyses were performed by adding 4 μl of specific antibodies to the reaction mixture. Samples were resolved by 5% PAGE in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA) buffer, and the radioactive bands were visualized by autoradiography.In Vitro Kinase Assay—Cells were solubilized in lysing buffer (50 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm benzamidine hydrochloride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After separating NLK-FLAG from cell lysate using anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel, aliquots of immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer, twice with washing buffer (500 mm LiCl, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.1% Triton X-100), and twice with kinase buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.6, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Kinase reactions were performed in kinase buffer in a total volume of 30 μl in the presence of 100 μm cold ATP and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 30 min. Following the kinase reaction, samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography.RESULTSHFz6 Does Not Transmit the Canonical Wnt Signaling following Exposure to Various Wnts—Previously we have shown that HFz1 transduces the canonical TCF-dependent Wnt signaling pathway following exposure to either Wnt-3a, Wnt-3, Wnt-1, or Wnt-2 both in an autocrine or a paracrine mode (19Gazit A. Yaniv A. Bafico A. Pramila T. Igarashi M. Kitajewski J. Aaronson S.A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5959-5966Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To analyze whether HFz6 might also serve as a receptor transducing the canonical Wnt pathway, 293T cells were co-transfected with HFz6; Wnt-1, -3, or -3a; and TCF/Luc reporters. Data showed that, as opposed to HFz1, HFz6 did not transduce the canonical Wnt signaling in the presence of any of the tested Wnts (Fig. 1). HFz6 did not transduce the canonical Wnt pathway stimulated by Wnt-5a or Wnt-4 (not shown).HFz6 Antagonizes Wnt-3a Signal Transduction via HFz1— To investigate whether HFz6 affects the canonical Wnt pathway transmitted via HFz1, 293T cells were co-transfected with HFz1, Wnt-3a, increasing amounts of HFz6 or empty vector, and TCF/Luc reporters. Data showed that HFz6 inhibited Wnt-3a/HFz1-induced transcriptional activation of the TCF/Luc reporter in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). To verify that the forced expression of HFz6 was specifically responsible for the repression of Wnt-3a/HFz1-induced TCF-dependent signaling, we used the RNA interference approach (27Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8076) Google Scholar). We constructed pSUPER expressing short interfering HFz6-specific RNAs (HFz6-siRNA), which efficiently reduced the level of HFz6-CRD-FLAG (Fig. 2B). Data showed that co-expressing HFz6-siRNA abolished the repressive activity exhibited by the ectopically expressed HFz6 (Fig. 2C).Fig. 2HFz6 represses Wnt-3a/HFz1-transmitted canonical signaling pathway, and the HFz6 repressive effect is abrogated by HFz6-siRNA. A, 293T cells were transiently transfected with HFz1 (1 μg), Wnt-3a-HA (0.1 μg), TCF/Luc reporters (1 μg), β-galactosidase (0. 1 μg), and increasing amounts of HFz6 or empty vector. 48 h after transfection, cell lysates were measured for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities as described in the legend to Fig. 1. 100 μg of cell lysates were subjected to Western analysis using anti-HA antibody. B, 293T cells were co-transfected with CRD-HFz6-FLAG or empty vector and with HFz6-siRNA or empty pSUPER. 100 μg of cell lysate were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-FLAG or anti-β-actin antibodies. C, 293T cells were co-transfected with HFz1 (1 μg), Wnt-3a (0.1 μg), HFz6 or empty vector (1 μg each), TCF/Luc reporters (1 μg), β-galactosidase (0.1 μg), and either empty pSUPER or HFz6-siRNA (2 μg each). Luciferase and β-galactosidase levels were measured as described above.

The approach involved the activation of the canonical Wnt pathway by downstream Wnt signaling activators and investigating whether Wnt signaling would be repressed by ectopically expressed HFz6. Overexpression of Dvl-1 in a mammalian cell culture was previously shown to activate transcription from a reporter plasmid driven by TCF-responsive elements (28Smalley M.J. Sara E. Paterson H. Naylor S. Cook D. Jayatilake H. Fryer L.G. Hutchinson L. Fry M.J. Dale T.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2823-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). To determine whether co-expression of HFz6 would inhibit the Dvl-1-induced signaling pathway, 293T cells were co-transfected with a Myc-tagged Dvl-1 (Dvl-1-Myc) and HFz6 or empty vector. Data showed that ectopically expressed HFz6 inhibited Dvl-1-induced Wnt signaling (Fig. 3A), albeit the presence of similar amounts of Dvl-1 in the presence or absence of HFz6, and that this inhibition was released in the presence of HFz6-siRNA (Fig. 3B). The ability of HFz6 to repress the canonical Wnt signaling that was activated by enforced expression of Dvl-1 implied that HFz6 repressed Dvl-1-induced canonical Wnt pathway by transmitting an antagonistic signaling cascade and that HFz6-transmitted signaling cross-talks with and inhibits the canonical Wnt pathway downstream of, or in parallel, but dominant to Dvl-1.Fig. 3HFz6 represses the canonical Wnt signaling activated by Dvl-1. A, 293T cells were co-transfected with HFz6 or empty vector (1 μg), TCF/Luc reporters (1 μg), β-galactosidase (0.1 μg), and Dvl-1-Myc or empty vector (1 μg). Luciferase and β-galactosidase levels were measured as described in the legend to Fig. 1. 30 μg of cell lysates were subjected to Western analysis using anti-c-Myc antibody. B, 293T cells were co-transfected with HFz6 or empty vector (1 μg), TCF/Luc reporters (1 μg), β-galactosidase (0.1 μg) and Dvl-1-Myc or empty vector (1 μg) and either empty pSUPER or HFz6-siRNA (2 μg each). Luciferase and β-galactosidase levels were measured as described.

Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2064) Google Scholar). To narrow down the stage of HFz6 action, experiments were performed to investigate whether HFz6 activity would inhibit LiCl-induced Wnt signaling. Data showed that HFz6 overexpression inhibited LiCl-induced signaling (Fig. 4A), although it had no effect on the level of the endogenous β-catenin. The presence of HFz6-siRNA abolished HFz6 repressive activity (Fig. 4B). These data indicated that HFz6 inhibits Wnt signaling at a step downstream of GSK-3β-mediated β-catenin phosphorylation. As HFz6 acts downstream of GSK-3β, it was reasonable to assume that HFz6 would inhibit the Wnt pathway induced by a non-degradable β-catenin mutant. We thus used a constitutively active β-catenin(S33Y) mutant, which is insensitive to GSK-3β-mediated phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation (30Kolligs F.T. Hu G. Dang C.V. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5696-5706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Data showed that Wnt signaling induced by the stabilized β-catenin was inhibited by overexpressing HFz6 ("

We reported previously (Kuze, K., Graves, P., Leahy, A., Wilson, P., Stuhlmann, H., and You, G. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 1519–1524) that tunicamycin, an inhibitor of asparagine-linked glycosylation, significantly inhibited organic anion transport in COS-7 cells expressing a mouse organic anion transporter (mOAT1), suggesting an important role of glycosylation in mOAT1 function. In the present study, we investigated the effect of disrupting putative glycosylation sites in mOAT1 as well as its human counterpart, hOAT1, by mutating asparagine to glutamine and assessing mutant transporters in HeLa cells. We showed that the putative glycosylation site Asp-39 in mOAT1 was not glycosylated but the corresponding site (Asp-39) in hOAT1 was glycosylated. Disrupting Asp-39 resulted in a complete loss of transport activity in both mOAT1 and hOAT1 without affecting their cell surface expression, suggesting that the loss of function is not because of deglycosylation of Asp-39 per se but rather is likely because of the change of this important amino acid critically involved in the substrate binding. Single replacement of asparagines at other sites had no effect on transport activity indicating that glycosylation at individual sites is not essential for OAT function. In contrast, a simultaneous replacement of all asparagines in both mOAT1 and hOAT1 impaired the trafficking of the transporters to the plasma membrane. In summary, we provided the evidence that 1) Asp-39 is crucially involved in substrate recognition of OAT1, 2) glycosylation at individual sites is not required for OAT1 function, and 3) glycosylation plays an important role in the targeting of OAT1 onto the plasma membrane. This study is the first molecular identification and characterization of glycosylation of OAT1 and may provide important insights into the structure-function relationships of the organic anion transporter family. Organic anion transporters (OAT) play essential roles in the body disposition of clinically important anionic drugs, including antiviral drugs, antitumor drugs, antibiotics, antihypertensives, and anti-inflammatories.

Organic anion transporters (OAT) 1The abbreviations used are: OAT, organic anion transporter; OA, organic anion; mOAT, mouse OAT; hOAT, human OAT; PAH, [14C]p-amminohippuric acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; NHS-SS-biotin, sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)-ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate; PNGase F, peptide N-glycosidase F; CM, Ca2+Mg2+. 1The abbreviations used are: OAT, organic anion transporter; OA, organic anion; mOAT, mouse OAT; hOAT, human OAT; PAH, [14C]p-amminohippuric acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; NHS-SS-biotin, sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)-ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate; PNGase F, peptide N-glycosidase F; CM, Ca2+Mg2+. play essential roles in the body disposition of clinically important anionic drugs including anti-human immunodeficiency virus therapeutics, antitumor drugs, antibiotics, antihypertensives, and anti-inflammatories (1You G. Med. Res. Rev. 2002; 22: 602-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Several OAT isoforms have been identified by us and others (2You G. Curr. Drug Metab. 2004; 5: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). OAT1 and -3 are predominantly expressed in the kidney and brain. In the kidney, these transporters utilize a tertiary transport mechanism to move organic anions across the basolateral membrane into the proximal tubule cells for subsequent exit/elimination across the apical membrane into urine. Through this tertiary transport mechanism, Na+-K+-ATPase maintains an inwardly directed (blood to cell) Na+ gradient. The Na+ gradient then drives a Na+-dicarboxylate cotransporter, sustaining an outwardly directed dicarboxylate gradient that is utilized by a dicarboxylate/organic anion (OA) exchanger to move the OA substrate into the cell. This cascade of events indirectly links OA transport to metabolic energy and the Na+ gradient, allowing the entry of a negatively charged substrate against both its chemical concentration gradient and the electrical potential of the cell. OAT2 is predominantly expressed in the liver. OAT4 is present mainly in the placenta and kidney. The transport mechanisms for OAT2 and -4 remain to be elucidated.All cloned OATs share a common predicted structure comprising 12 putative transmembrane domains and a large hydrophilic loop between transmembrane domains 1 and 2, which contains several potential N-glycosylation sites. The N-glycosylation of proteins has been demonstrated to play a variety of roles including modulation of biological activity, regulation of intracellular targeting, protein folding, and maintenance of protein stability. We have shown previously (3Kuze K. Greves P. Leahy A. Wilson P. Stuhlmann H. You G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1519-1524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) that tunicamycin, an inhibitor of asparagine-linked glycosylation, significantly inhibited organic anion transport in COS-7 cells expressing a mouse organic anion transporter (mOAT1), suggesting that glycosylation is essential for mOAT1 function. Despite this initial characterization, the direct molecular evidence on the sites, and the roles of glycosylation in OATs is not yet available. In the present study, we investigated the consequence of disruption of the potential N-glycosylation sites in mOAT1 on its function and cellular localization. Because hOAT1, the human counter-part of mOAT1, is the ultimate target for improving human therapy, the glycosylation of hOAT1 was also investigated.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials[14C]p-Amminohippuric acid (PAH) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. NHS-SS-biotin and streptavidin-agarose beads were purchased from Pierce. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma.MethodsSite-directed Mutagenesis—Mutant transporters were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of asparagine to glutamine of mOAT1-myc and hOAT1-myc. Both mOAT1-myc and hOAT1-myc contain a 10-amino acid c-myc tag at the C terminus of mOAT1 and hOAT1. Previous studies from our laboratory (3Kuze K. Greves P. Leahy A. Wilson P. Stuhlmann H. You G. J.

The mutant sequences were confirmed by the dideoxy chain-termination method.Expression in HeLa Cells—HeLa cells were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in minimum Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Confluent HeLa cells were infected with recombinant vTF-7 vaccinia virus and then transfected with DNA plasmid using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) following the established protocol (5Stephan M.M. Chen M.A. Penado K.M. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were incubated for 14–20 h at 37 °C and then used for transport assay and cell surface biotinylation.Transport Measurements—For each well, uptake solution was added. The uptake solution consisted of phosphate-buffered saline/CM (PBS/CM) (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.3) and [14C]PAH. At the times indicated in the figure legends, the uptake was stopped by aspirating off the uptake solution and rapidly washing the well with ice-cold PBS solution. The cells were then solubilized in 0.2 n NaOH, neutralized in 0.2 n HCl, and aliquotted for liquid scintillation counting. The uptake count was standardized by the amount of protein in each well. Values were mean ± S.E. (n = 3).Isolation of Plasma Membrane Proteins by Cell Surface Biotinylation—Cell surface expression levels of mOAT1, hOAT1, and their mutants were examined using the membrane-impermeant biotinylation reagent, NHS-SS-biotin. The transporters were expressed in HeLa cells in 6-well plates using vaccinia T7/LipofectAMINE 2000 as described above. After 20 h, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with 3 ml of ice-cold PBS/CM, pH 8.0. The plates were kept on ice, and all solutions were ice-cold for the rest of the procedure. Each well of cells was incubated with 1 ml of NHS-SS-biotin (0.5 mg/ml in PBS/CM) in two successive 20-min incubations on ice with very gentle shaking. The reagent was freshly prepared for each incubation. After biotinylation, each well was briefly rinsed with 3 ml of PBS/CM containing 100 mm glycine then incubated with the same solution for 20 min on ice to ensure complete quenching of the unreacted NHS-SS-biotin. The cells were then dissolved on ice for 1 h in 400 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 200 mg/ml protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 mg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.4). The unlysed cells were removed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C. 50 ml of streptavidin-agarose beads were then added to the supernatant to isolate the cell membrane protein. mOAT1 and hOAT1 were detected in the pool of surface proteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting using an anti-myc antibody.Deglycosylation of Plasma Membrane Proteins with Peptide N-Glycosidase F—For deglycosylation, cell surface proteins were denatured in 0.5% SDS and 1% mercaptoethanol, heated at 80 °C for 10 min, and then incubated in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 μl of peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F, 500 units/μl, New England Biolabs) at 37 °C for 1 h. The samples were then used for immunoblotting.Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Protein samples (with equal amount) were resolved on 7.5% SDS-PAGE minigels and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The blots were blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS-0.05% Tween, washed, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with monoclonal anti-myc antibody (1:1000). The membranes were washed and then incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:20,000), and signals were detected by SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate kit (Pierce).Immunofluorescence of Transfected Cells—Twenty hours after transfection, HeLa cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed for 15 min at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and rewashed in PBS. The fixed cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. The cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in PBS containing 5% goat serum and then incubated for 1 h in the same medium containing anti-myc antibody (1:100) at room temperature. The cells were washed, and bound primary antibodies were detected by reaction with fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG (Chemicon) diluted to 1:100 for 1 h. Cells were thoroughly washed, and the cover glasses were mounted in GEL/MOUNT™ (Biomeda Corp., Foster City, CA). Samples were visualized on a fluorescence microscope.RESULTSN-Glycosylation of mOAT1 and hOAT1—We and others have shown previously (6Geng L. Kuze K. Satlin L.M. Healy D. Henderson S. Burrow C.R.

Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 570-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) that mature OATs are heavily glycosylated proteins in vivo. We showed here (Fig. 1) that both mOAT1 and hOAT1 are also glycosylated in HeLa cells. Immunoblot analysis of plasma membrane proteins isolated from HeLa cells expressing mOAT1 (Fig. 1a) and hOAT1 (Fig. 1b) revealed a single band with an apparent molecular mass of ∼90 kDa. When these proteins were treated with PNGase F, an enzyme removing the N-linked carbohydrate groups from glycoproteins, the molecular mass shifted to a smaller size of ∼55 kDa, consistent with the predicted (unglycosylated) sizes for mOAT1 and hOAT1. These results showed clearly that both transporters are glycosylated in HeLa cells.Immunoblot Analysis of the Effect of Single Disruption of Putative Glycosylation Sites—Based on the deduced amino acid sequences of OATs and their secondary structure model, multiple consensus sites (NX(S/T)) for N-glycosylation were identified in the first extracellular loop, as depicted in Fig. 2. For mOAT1, these sites are located at positions 39, 56, 86, 91, and 107. For hOAT1, these sites are located at positions 39, 56, 92, 97, and 113. To identify which of these sites are utilized for glycosylation, we disrupted the glycosylation consensus sequences individually by site-directed mutagenesis replacing asparagine (N) with glutamine (Q). Western blot analysis of plasma membrane proteins from cells expressing mOAT1 mutants (Fig. 3a) showed that in the absence of PNGase F, N56Q, N86Q, N91Q, and N107Q had molecular masses smaller than that of fully glycosylated (wild type) but larger than that of unglycosylated mOAT1. N39Q had a molecular mass that was the same size as that of wild type mOAT1. Treating these mutant proteins with PNGase F reduced their molecular mass to the same size as that of unglycosylated mOAT1, suggesting that in mOAT1 Asp-56, Asp-86, Asp-91, and Asp-107 are glycosylated, whereas Asp-39 is not utilized for glycosylation. Western blot analysis of plasma membrane proteins from cells expressing hOAT1 mutants (Fig. 3b) showed that in the absence of PNGase F N39Q, N56Q, N92Q, and N97Q had molecular masses smaller than that of fully glycosylated (wild type) but larger than that of unglycosylated mOAT1. N113Q had a molecular mass the same size as that of wild type hOAT1. Treating these mutant proteins with PNGase F reduced their molecular masses to the same as that of unglycosylated hOAT1, suggesting that in hOAT1, Asp-39, Asp-56, Asp-92, and Asp-97 are glycosylated, whereas Asp-113 is not utilized for glycosylation.Fig. 2Secondary structure model of OATs.

Plasma membrane proteins were isolated via chromatography on streptavidin-agarose after surface biotinylation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The proteins were then treated with (+) or without (-) PNGase F followed by separation on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, transfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probing with anti-myc antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Functional Analysis of the Effect of Single Disruption of Putative Glycosylation Sites—We then examined the functional consequence of disrupting these putative glycosylation sites by measuring the uptake of [14C]PAH (a prototypical substrate for OAT) in mutant-transfected cells. As shown in Fig. 4, the single replacement of Asp-39 resulted in a complete loss of transport activity in both mOAT1 (Fig. 4a) and hOAT1 (Fig. 4b). Interestingly, Asp-39 is not glycosylated in mOAT1 (Fig. 3a) but is glycosylated in hOAT1 (Fig. 3b). Therefore, the loss of transport activity of N39Q in both mOAT1 and hOAT1 may not be because of deglycosylation of Asp-39 per se but may rather be because of the change in amino acid sequence. Because the cell surface abundance of N39Q is comparable with that of both wild type mOAT1 (Fig. 3a) and wild type hOAT1 (Fig. 3b), the loss of function of this mutant is not because of the defective targeting of the transporters to the plasma membrane but is rather because of the poor substrate binding/recognition. Replacing asparagines at other sites had no effect on transport activity for both mOAT1 (Fig. 4a) and hOAT1 (Fig. 4b), suggesting that glycosylation at individual sites is not required for the transport function of both transporters.Fig. 4Functional analysis of the effect of single disruption of putative glycosylation sites. Mutant transporters were generated by individually replacing asparagine (N) with glutamine (Q) at each potential glycosylation site of mOAT1 (a) and hOAT1 (b).

(n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Immunoblot Analysis of the Effect of Multiple Disruptions of Putative Glycosylation Sites—We next investigated the effect of disruption of all of the glycosylation sites. In mOAT1, simultaneous replacement of Asp-56, Asp-86, Asp-91, and Asp-107 (N56Q/N86Q/N91Q/N107Q) produced an ∼55 kDa protein with or without PNGase F treatment (Fig. 5a). This molecular mass is the same as that of unglycosylated mOAT1, indicating that there are no additional sites for N-glycosylation. It is important to note that when all of the glycosylation sites were removed, the expression level of the unglycosylated mOAT1 was dramatically reduced as compared with that of wild type mOAT1 (although the total cellular protein of the quadruple mutant was similar to that of wild type, data not shown), suggesting that glycosylation is critical for the proper trafficking of the transporter onto the plasma membrane. In hOAT1, Asp-39, N56Q, N92Q, and N97Q are normally glycosylated, whereas Asp-113 was not utilized for glycosylation (Fig. 3b). If this observation is true, then one might predict that the quadruple mutant N39Q/N56Q/N92Q/N97Q should have a molecular mass of ∼55 kDa, the size of unglycosylated hOAT1, and PN-Gase F should fail to produce a molecular mass shift. Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 5b, in the absence of PNGase F N39Q/N56Q/N92Q/N97Q produced a protein of ∼65 kDa. Treatment of N39Q/N56Q/N92Q/N97Q with PNGase F further reduced the molecular mass to the size of unglycosylated hOAT1. This result implies that an alternative glycosylation site may be used when the four normal glycosylation sites are eliminated. To test the hypothesis that Asp-113 is the alternative glycosylation site, we created quintuple mutant N39Q/N56Q/N92Q/N97Q/N113Q. Indeed, this mutant yielded a protein ∼55 kDa, the expected molecular mass of the unglycosylated hOAT1, both in the absence and presence of PNGase F. This result proved that Asp-113 became glycosylated when other sites were mutated. Again it is important to note that hOAT1 arrived to the plasma membrane with progressively more difficulties as the degree of glycosylation decrease. Whereas the total amount of cellular proteins of the quadruple (N39Q/N56Q/N92Q/N97Q) and the quintuple (N39Q/N56Q/N92Q/N97Q/N113Q) was similar to that of the wild type (data not shown), the membrane abundance of the quadruple mutant was only ∼10% of the wild type hOAT1, and the membrane abundance of the quintuple mutant was almost undetectable.Fig. 5Western blot analysis of the effect of multiple disruptions of putative glycosylation sites. Mutant transporters were generated by simultaneously replacing all the asparagines (N) with glutamine (Q) in mOAT1 (a) and hOAT1 (b). The wild type (Wt) and mutants were expressed in HeLa cells. Plasma membrane proteins were isolated through biotinylation from these cells. The proteins were then treated with (+) or without (-) PNGase F followed by separation on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, transfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probing with anti-myc antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Immunofluorescence Analysis of the Effect of Multiple Disruptions of Putative Glycosylation Sites—Further evidence of this difficulty of deglycosylated protein to be transported to the plasma membrane was obtained by immunofluorescence (Fig. 6). Whereas the plasma membrane was clearly labeled (shown as green fluorescence) in cells transfected with wild type mOAT1 and hOAT1, fluorescence remained mainly in the intracellular compartment for the unglycosylated mOAT1 (N56Q/N86Q/N91Q/N107Q) and the unglycosylated hOAT1 (N39Q/N56Q/N92Q/N97Q/N113Q). Phase contrast images showed that the cells were fully attached to the culture dishes under all conditions. Considering all of these data together, it can be concluded that glycosylation is necessary for proper targeting of both mOAT1 and hOAT1 to the plasma membrane.Fig. 6Immunofluorescence study of the effect of deglycosylation of mOAT1 (a) and hOAT1 (b) on their cellular expression. Wild type mOAT1, wild type hOAT1, and their deglycosylated mutants were expressed in HeLa cells.

Although no individual glycosylation site is critical for mOAT1 function, simultaneously removing all of the glycosylation sites resulted in a dramatic reduction in transport activity (Fig. 7a). The unglycosylated hOAT1 also showed no transport activity (Fig. 7b).Fig. 7Functional analysis of the effect of multiple disruptions of putative glycosylation sites. Mutant transporters were generated by simultaneously replacing all the asparagines (N) with glutamine (Q) in mOAT1 (a) and hOAT1 (b).

To determine whether deglycosylation of mOAT1 affects such functional characteristic, cells expressing the quadruple mutant (N56Q/N86Q/N91Q/N107Q) were preloaded with [14C]PAH followed by exposure to the medium with or without α-ketoglutarate, another substrate for OAT1. As shown in Fig. 8, significant efflux of intracellular [14C]PAH was observed with both wild type mOAT1 and its quadruple mutant when cells were exposed to medium containing an exchangeable substrate α-ketoglutarate, as compared with medium without α-ketoglutarate (Fig. 8a). The quadruple mutant was also equally sensitive to the inhibition by probenecid, an inhibitor for OAT, to that of wild type mOAT1 (Fig. 8b). These results suggest that the unglycosylated mOAT1 preserves the basic functional characteristics of the wild type mOAT1.Fig. 8Functional analysis of unglycosylated mOAT1. a, efflux of [14C]PAH.

One common structure feature shared among all of the cloned OATs is the presence of consensus sites for N-linked glycosylation in the first extracellular loop within the current secondary structure model (Fig. 2). The potential use of one or several of these consensus sites is suggested by our previous observations that 1) the apparent molecular mass of mOAT1 in mouse kidney membrane fraction was ∼90 kDa (after treatment with endoglycosidase H, the molecular mass was reduced to ∼ 55 kDa, the size of the unmodified protein (6Geng L. Kuze K. Satlin L.M. Healy D. Henderson S. Burrow C.R. Wilson P.D. You G. The American Society of Nephrology, 32nd Annual Meeting, Miami Beach, FL, November 1999. 1999; Google Scholar)); 2) the microsome-dependent increase in the apparent molecular mass of mOAT1 products obtained by in vitro translation is completely reversed by treatment with endoglycosidase H (3Kuze K. Greves P. Leahy A. Wilson P. Stuhlmann H. You G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1519-1524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); and 3) the treatment of mOAT1-expressing COS-7 cells with tunicamycin resulted in an almost complete loss of mOAT1-mediated organic anion transport. Immunofluorescence provided the evidence that most of the protein remained in the intracellular compartment in tunicamycin-treated cells (3Kuze K. Greves P. Leahy A. Wilson P. Stuhlmann H. You G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1519-1524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In total, these results indicate that mOAT1 is a glycoprotein, and glycosylation plays an important role for mOAT1 function.In the present study we have used site-directed mutagenesis to provide molecular insight into the glycosylation of mOAT1 and the functional role of glycosylation. Because hOAT1, the human counterpart of mOAT1, is the ultimate target for improving human therapy, the glycosylation of hOAT1 was also investigated.Based on the secondary structure model, both mOAT1 and hOAT1 contain five asparagines in the first extracellular loop, which are predicted to be the potential sites for glycosylation. To determine which of these sites is utilized for glycosylation, we generated mutants by replacing asparagine with glutamine singly or in combination. Western blot analysis of these mutants revealed that only four of the five potential sites were normally used for glycosylation for both mOAT1 and hOAT1. Glycosylation at these sites confirms the predicted membrane topology of OAT; the large hydrophilic loop between transmembrane domains 1 and 2 faces extracellular fluid.A"

The structural basis for the function of JAM1 has yet to be determined. Here we provide evidence that JAM1 homodimer formation is important for its function in epithelial cells. Experiments were conducted to determine the effects of a panel of JAM1 monoclonal antibodies on epithelial barrier recovery after transient disruption by calcium switch. Two monoclonal antibodies were observed to inhibit barrier recovery in contrast to another monoclonal antibody that had no effect. Epitope mapping by phage display revealed that both inhibitory antibodies bind to a region of JAM1 located within the N-terminal Ig-like loop (residues 111–123). Competition experiments with synthetic peptides and site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the location of this epitope. Analysis of the crystal structure of JAM1 revealed that this epitope includes residues within the putative homodimer interface, and one of the two inhibitory antibodies was then shown to block JAM1 homodimer formation in vitro. Finally, mutations within the homodimer interface were shown to prevent enrichment of JAM1 at points of cell contact, presumably by interference with homophilic interactions.

These findings suggest that homodimer formation may be important for localization of JAM1 at tight junctions and for regulation of epithelial barrier function. A crucial function of epithelial cells is in the maintenance of a selective barrier separating the external from internal environments. It is well known that tight junctions (TJs) 1The abbreviations used are: TJs, tight junctions; JAM, junctional adhesion molecule; mAb, monoclonal antibody; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; AP, alkaline phosphatase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TER, transepithelial resistance. play an important role in the maintenance and regulation of these barriers. Located at the apical-most part of the lateral epithelial cell membrane, TJs regulate paracellular diffusion of ions and small molecules across epithelial barriers. In addition, TJs serve as a fence between the apical and basolateral domains of polarized cells and facilitate bi-directional signal transduction between the intracellular and extracellular environments. TJs are composed of both transmembrane and cytoplasmic structural elements. Transmembrane protein members include occludins, claudins, coxsackie adenovirus receptors, and junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs). Knowledge of how these various proteins contribute to TJ function is continually evolving. JAM1 is an immunoglobulin superfamily protein that localizes to TJs of epithelial and endothelial cells (1Martin-Padura I. Lostaglio S. Schneemann M. Williams L. Romano M. Fruscella P. Panzeri C.

Martin-Padura I. Dejana E. Hogg N. Simmons D.L. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 36: 1175-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Evidence suggests a role for JAM1 in TJ assembly (3Liu Y. Nusrat A.

Monoclonal antibodies to JAM1 have been shown to inhibit reassembly of TJs and block recovery of transepithelial resistance to ion flux (3Liu Y. Nusrat A. Schnell F.J. Reaves T.A. Walsh S. Pochet M. Parkos C.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2363-2374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Mori H. Hata Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4267-4282Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The structural basis for the role of JAM1 in regulation of epithelial and endothelial barriers is largely unknown. Evidence suggests that homophilic interactions are important for JAM1 function. The crystal structure of JAM1 predicts that it forms stable homodimers (16Kostrewa D. Brockhaus M. D'Arcy A. Dale G.E. Nelboeck P. Schmid G. Mueller F. Bazzoni G. Dejana E. Bartfai T. Winkler F.K.

Cross-linking experiments suggest that JAM1 forms homodimers in solution and on the surface of transfected CHO cells (4Bazzoni G. Martinez-Estrada O.M. Mueller F. Nelboeck P. Schmid G. Bartfai T. Dejana E. Brockhaus M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30970-30976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Other studies suggest that heterotypic interactions are important for JAM1 function. For example, Ostermann et al. (6Ostermann G. Weber K.S. Zernecke A. Schroder A. Weber C. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar) observed that LFA-1 (αLβ2) interactions are important for T cell binding and migration, and Naik et al. (18Naik U.P. Ehrlich Y.H. Kornecki E. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) suggest that JAM1 binds to αvβ3. Together these results suggest that JAM1 function in vivo may involve multiple types of protein-protein interactions, perhaps both homotypic and heterotypic in nature. Here we present evidence that homophilic JAM1 interactions are important for regulation of barrier function in epithelial cells. We demonstrate the following: (i) monoclonal JAM1 antibodies that inhibit resealing of epithelial monolayers bind to a common region within the extracellular domain of JAM1; (ii) this functional epitope is located within the N-terminal Ig-like loop (residues 111–123); (iii) residues within the putative homodimer interface contribute to this functional epitope; (iv) an inhibitory JAM1 antibody that binds to this epitope blocks JAM1 homodimer formation in vitro; and (v) homodimer interface mutants fail to concentrate at points of contact between transfected cells. Cell Culture—COS-7 cells (ATCC) and SK-CO15 colonic epithelial cells (19Lisanti M.P. Caras I.W. Davitz M.A. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J.

Cells were subcultured and harvested with 0.05% trypsin and 53 mm EDTA in Hanks' balanced salt solution. For transepithelial resistance recovery experiments, SK-CO15 cells were grown on collagen-coated polycarbonate membranes with 0.4-μm pore size and 0.33-cm2 surface area (Costar). Recombinant Protein Production—JAM1-AP was produced in our laboratory as described previously (3Liu Y. Nusrat A. Schnell F.J. Reaves T.A. Walsh S. Pochet M. Parkos C.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2363-2374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a DNA fragment encoding the putative extracellular domain of human JAM1 was cloned into the AP-tag2 vector that encodes the catalytic domain of human placental alkaline phosphatase at the C terminus. The vector was then transiently transfected into COS-7 cells using DEAE-dextran. Secretion of JAM1-AP was monitored by determination of alkaline phosphatase activity in the culture medium. JAM1-AP was affinity purified on an anti-AP column (Sigma) and eluted with 100 mm triethylamine, pH 11.5, and neutralized with 100 mm HEPES, pH 5. Fractions were combined and dialyzed in HEPES-buffered saline for 16 h at 4 °C. Purity was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. The mutant JAM1-AP-N117K was produced using the GeneTailor site-directed mutagenesis kit (Invitrogen). Recombinant JAM1-AP-N117K was produced in COS-7 cells as described above. Mutant protein production was verified by assaying the culture medium for alkaline phosphatase activity and by reactivity with JAM1 mAb 1H2A9. For homodimerization assays, JAM1 was produced in bacteria as reported previously (17Prota A.E. Campbell J.A. Schelling P. Forrest J.C. Watson M.J. Peters T.R. Aurrand-Lions M.

Dr. Terence Dermody kindly provided a plasmid encoding GST fused to the extracellular domain of JAM1 (GST-JAM1). GST-JAM1 was expressed in BL21 Escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography with glutathione-agarose (BD Biosciences). The extracellular domain of JAM1 was cleaved with thrombin (Sigma), and the thrombin was then adsorbed onto benzamidine-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Purity of the JAM1 protein was assessed by SDS-PAGE. For biotinylation, NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) was reacted with purified JAM1 according to the manufacturer's protocol. Antibodies—Mouse monoclonal anti-JAM1 antibodies J3F.1, J10.4, and 1H2A9 (all IgG1 isotype) were produced in female BALB/c mice immunized with JAM1-AP as described previously (3Liu Y. Nusrat A. Schnell F.J. Reaves T.A. Walsh S. Pochet M. Parkos C.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2363-2374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For Fab production, monoclonal antibodies J10.4 and 1H2A9 were incubated with immobilized papain (Pierce) for5hat37 °Cin20mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm cysteine-HCl. Crude digest was adsorbed against protein A to remove Fc fragments and undigested IgG. Purity of the Fab product was confirmed by the absence of intact IgG after SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions. For antibody biotinylation, NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) was reacted with J10.4 according to the manufacturer's protocol. Immunofluorescence microscopy and ELISA confirmed affinities of all mAbs, Fab fragments, and labeled antibodies for JAM1. Transepithelial Resistance Recovery—Transepithelial resistance was monitored in monolayers after transient disruption of TJs using a calcium-switch method as reported previously (3Liu Y. Nusrat A. Schnell F.J. Reaves T.A. Walsh S. Pochet M. Parkos C.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2363-2374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Gonzalez-Mariscal L. Chavez de Ramirez B. Cereijido M. J. Membr. Biol. 1985; 86: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). SK-CO15 cells were grown on permeable polycarbonate membranes (0.4-μm pore size). Transepithelial resistance (TER) to passive ion flow was recorded using an EVOMX voltmeter with an STX2 electrode (World Precision Instruments). Initial resistance values for confluent SK-CO15 monolayers 4–7 days after seeding were consistently greater than 1000 ohms·cm2. To disrupt intercellular junctions, cells were treated calcium-free medium (minimum essential medium with 10 mm HEPES, 18 mm NaHCO3, 6% newborn calf serum dialyzed in phosphate-buffered saline, and 2 mm EGTA). After 45 min at 37 °C in calcium-free medium, transepithelial resistance was recorded for each monolayer yielding TER values less than 50 ohms·cm2. Cells were washed twice with normal growth medium and incubated in normal growth medium containing 10 μg/ml of antibody J3F.1, J10.4, 1H2A9, mouse IgG1, or J10.4-Fab at 37 °C. TER measurements were made at various time points thereafter with a final measurement at 22 h. For each monolayer, barrier recovery was calculated as the ratio of the final TER to the initial TER measured before calcium depletion. Antibody and Protein Binding Assays—All binding assays were performed in 96-well plates (Immulon). For antibody competition experiments, wells were coated with JAM1-AP at 5 μg/ml and incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Wells were blocked with 1% BSA in HEPES-buffered saline for 90 min at room temperature. Biotinylated antibody J10.4 was diluted in blocking buffer to 1 μg/ml and supplemented with 30 μg/ml J3F.1, J10.4, 1H2A9, or polyclonal mouse IgG1. After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, wells were washed with HEPES-buffered saline, and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Molecular Probes) was added (1 μg/ml). After 1 h, wells were washed, and a solution containing 1 mm 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid and 10 mm H2O2 in 100 mm citrate buffer, pH 4.2, was added. Binding of biotin-J10.4 was measured indirectly by absorbance at 405 nm in a microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices). For peptide competition experiments, wells were coated with 10 μg/ml of mAbs J3F.1 or J10.4 in 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 8.5, for 16 h at 4 °C. Nonspecific protein binding was blocked by incubation of wells with 5% delipidated milk in HEPES-buffered saline for 1 h at 37 °C. Peptides were dissolved in Me2SO and then serially diluted in blocking buffer containing 0.4 μg/ml JAM1-AP. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, wells were washed 3 times with HEPES-buffered saline, and a solution containing 1 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) in 0.2 m Tris was added. Alkaline phosphatase activity was then determined by absorbance at 405 nm in a microtiter plate reader. For mutant JAM1 protein binding experiments, wells were coated with mAbs J3F.1, J10.4, and 1H2A9 at 10 μg/ml for 16 h at 4 °C. Nonspecific protein binding was blocked by incubation of wells with COS-7 culture medium containing 10% FBS. Cell culture medium from COS-7 cells expressing either JAM1-AP or JAM1-AP-N117K was applied directly to each well. After incubating for 1 h, wells were washed, and alkaline phosphatase activity was determined as detailed above. For homodimerization experiments, a published assay (4Bazzoni G. Martinez-Estrada O.M. Mueller F. Nelboeck P. Schmid G. Bartfai T. Dejana E. Brockhaus M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30970-30976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) was modified to test the effects of anti-JAM1 mAbs on JAM1 homophilic binding. Wells were coated with JAM1 at 12.5 μg/ml for 16 h at 4 °C. Nonspecific protein binding was blocked by incubation with 2% BSA plus 0.05% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline. Fab fragments of J10.4, 1H2A9, or control antibody were serially diluted in blocking buffer containing biotinylated JAM1 (10 μg/ml) and incubated for1hat37 °C. Wells were washed with 0.2% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin (1 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. As described above, 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid substrate was added, and biotin-JAM1 binding was quantified by absorbance at 405 nm. Epitope Mapping by Phage Display—To determine the epitopes of JAM1 mAbs, we used random peptide phage libraries LL9 and CL10, which were previously produced in our laboratory (21Mazzucchelli L. Burritt J.B. Jesaitis A.J. Nusrat A. Liang T.W. Gewirtz A.T. Schnell F.J. Parkos C.A. Blood. 1999; 93: 1738-1748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides encoding random peptides were cloned into the pIII gene of M13KBstX. The LL9 library contains random nonapeptides with a diversity of 3.66 × 109 unique clones. The CL10 library contains random cysteine-constrained decapeptides with a diversity of 1.04 × 109 unique clones. Phage from the CL10 and LL9 libraries were immunoaffinity-purified with J3F.1- and J10.4-conjugated Sepharose using a protocol described previously (22Burritt J.B. Quinn M.T. Jutila M.A. Bond C.W. Jesaitis A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16974-16980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Briefly, three rounds of panning were performed for each antibody-library combination. In each round, 2 × 1011 phage were incubated with 30 μl of antibody-conjugated Sepharose for 16 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed with 50 ml of phage buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20, and 1 mg/ml BSA). Phage were eluted with 1 ml of 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.2, and then pH-neutralized with 160 μl of 1 m HEPES, pH 11. Eluate phage were amplified in K91 E. coli (23Smith G.P. Scott J.K. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 228-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar) with 75 μg/ml kanamycin (22Burritt J.B. Quinn M.T. Jutila M.A. Bond C.W. Jesaitis A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16974-16980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Phage were precipitated from supernatant with 16.7% PEG, 3.3 m NaCl and resuspended in HEPES-buffered saline (21Mazzucchelli L. Burritt J.B. Jesaitis A.J. Nusrat A. Liang T.W. Gewirtz A.T. Schnell F.J. Parkos C.A. Blood. 1999; 93: 1738-1748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The titer of the crude and amplified eluate was determined by plaque assay. To determine the identity of the phage-displayed peptides, double-stranded phage DNA was isolated from K91 by miniprep (Qiagen) and sequenced using a forward primer targeting the unique pIII insert. Peptide synthesis—Peptides were commercially synthesized and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography to >90% purity (Emory University Microchemical Facility). For constrained peptides, disulfide oxidation was performed. All peptides were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight to confirm purity and oxidation state. Crystal Structure Analysis—The atomic coordinates for the crystal structure of human JAM1 were downloaded from the Protein Data Bank (code 1NBQ). Analysis was performed using Swiss-PdbViewer/Deep View version 3.6 (GlaxoSmithKline). Production and Localization of JAM-1 Mutants—To produce JAM1 mutants, DNA encoding full-length JAM1 was cloned into pIRES2-EGFP (Clontech), and mutations were made using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). Mutant N117K contains a lysine substitution at residue 117, and mutant E61R/K63E contains substitutions at residues 61 and 63. The DL1 mutant is a deletion mutant lacking Ig-like loop 1. For localization assays, CHO K1 cells grown on coverslips were transfected with DNA encoding wild type JAM1 or mutants using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were fixed in ethanol 2 days post-transfection and blocked with 1% BSA. Wild type JAM1, mutant N117K, and mutant E61R/K63E were stained with mAb 1H2A9. Mutant DL1 was stained with a polyclonal rabbit antibody raised against recombinant protein consisting of the extracellular domain of JAM1. Nuclei were stained with To-Pro-3 (Molecular Probes). Immunofluorescent images were captured using a laser scanning microscope (Zeiss). Differing Effects of JAM1 Antibodies on Barrier Recovery— Experiments were conducted to determine the effects of a panel of JAM1 antibodies on epithelial barrier recovery after transient disruption of TJs by calcium switch. Confluent SK-CO15 colonic epithelial monolayers were treated with calcium-free medium for 45 min to disrupt intercellular junctions. TER values were monitored for each monolayer and were consistently observed to decrease from values greater than 1000 ohms·cm2 to values less than 50 ohms·cm2 in response to calcium depletion. In accordance with decreases in TER, immunofluorescence staining of TJs revealed marked disruption of the characteristic “chicken wire” staining patterns of occludin, JAM1, and ZO1 (data not shown). At this point, cultures were returned to normal growth medium that was supplemented with anti-JAM1 mAbs J3F.1, J10.4 or 1H2A9 or with control IgG. Transepithelial resistance to passive ion flux was monitored at various time points following calcium repletion. Epithelial barrier recovery was calculated as a percentage of the initial resistance values obtained for each monolayer. As illustrated in Fig. 1, monoclonal antibodies J3F.1 and J10.4 inhibited recovery of barrier function in epithelial monolayers. In particular, at 22 h post-calcium repletion, cultures treated with antibodies J3F.1 and J10.4 had only recovered to 8 and 6%, whereas cultures treated with control antibody or with antibody 1H2A9 had recovered to 100% of their initial resistance. These results demonstrate that JAM1 mAbs J3F.1 and J10.4 have a distinct inhibitory effect on barrier recovery compared with JAM1 mAb 1H2A9, which does not effect recovery at all. Furthermore, these results suggest that specific regions on the extracellular domain of JAM1 play a role in regulation of barrier recovery. To determine whether the effects of J3F.1 and J10.4 on barrier recovery are attributable to antibody-mediated cross-linking, additional experiments were conducted using Fab fragments. As illustrated in Fig. 1, cultures treated with J10.4-Fab only recovered 13% after 22 h as compared with controls that recovered 100%. This result is comparable with the effect observed with intact mAb J10.4 and suggests that antibody-mediated cross-linking is not responsible for the effect of J10.4 on barrier recovery. To control for nonspecific effects of antibody fragmentation, 1H2A9-Fab was also tested. As with whole 1H2A9 IgG, no effect on barrier recovery was observed for 1H2A9-Fab (data not shown). Because of the marked functional differences observed between antibodies J3F.1, J10.4, and 1H2A9, we carefully assessed the epithelial cell staining patterns of these antibodies using direct immunofluorescence. The staining patterns of all three antibodies were identical (not shown). Thus, it is unlikely that the inhibitory effects of J3F.1 and J10.4 are due to cross-reactivity with other proteins or due to differential affinity for specific subpopulations of JAM1. J3F.1 and J10.4 Compete for Binding to JAM1—Experiments were conducted to determine whether inhibitory antibodies J3F.1 and J10.4 bind to a common region of JAM1. Competition assays were performed in which binding of biotinylated J10.4 to immobilized JAM1 was measured in the presence of antibodies J3F.1, J10.4, 1H2A9, control IgG1, or no antibody. As seen in Fig. 2, control IgG1 did not affect binding of biotin-J10.4 to JAM1. Antibody J3F.1, however, completely abrogated binding of biotin-J10.4, and this effect was comparable with that observed with excess unlabeled J10.4. The reduction in binding was comparable with the background binding measured without labeled J10.4 present (data not shown). In similar experiments, binding of labeled J3F.1 to JAM1 was blocked by J10.4 (data not shown). These results suggest that J3F.1 and J10.4 compete for epitopes on JAM1 that are either common or in close proximity. In contrast to the competition observed between J3F.1 and J10.4, antibody 1H2A9 did not block binding of either J10.4 (Fig. 2) or J3F.1 (not shown). These results suggest that 1H2A9 binds to an unrelated epitope on JAM1 sufficiently distant from the epitopes of J3F.1 and J10.4 to avoid steric hindrance from these antibodies. Epitope Mapping by Phage Display—Random peptide phage display was used to map the epitopes of JAM1 antibodies J3F.1 and J10.4. Two phage libraries, a linear nonapeptide library (LL9) and a constrained decapeptide library (CL10), were screened to identify peptides that bind to antibodies J3F.1 and J10.4. After three rounds of immunoaffinity selection, an increase in phage titer of 1 × 104 was observed for phage selected by J10.4 from libraries CL10 and LL9 (data not shown). An increase in phage titer of 1 × 104 was also observed for phage selected by J3F.1 from the CL10 library, but no increase in titer was observed with J3F.1 and library LL9. The identities of phage-displayed peptides selected by J3F.1 and J10.4 were determined by DNA sequencing. As illustrated in Fig. 3, analysis of peptides selected by both J3F.1 and J10.4 revealed a consensus sequence resembling 111VSEEGGNSYGEVK123 of the membrane-distal Ig loop on the extracellular domain of JAM1. The most frequent motif was G(G/S)N, which was present in all but one peptide, and several peptides contained the sequence GGN, which matched exactly to 115GGN117 of JAM1. Several peptides also contained residues with similarity to 111VSEE114, 118SY119, and 121EVK123, but these motifs appeared less frequently than the GGN motif. Although many similarities were noted among peptides selected by J3F.1 and J10.4, some differences were noted as well. As shown in Fig. 3, antibody J10.4 selected peptides with residues resembling 121EVK123 of JAM1, but no phage selected by J3F.1 contained this motif. In addition, J3F.1 only selected phage from the constrained CL10 library, although J10.4 selected phage from both the constrained CL10 library and the linear LL9 library. These results suggest that epitopes of J3F.1 and J10.4 are not identical but have similar amino acid composition and are spatially related. Peptides Block J3F.1 and J10.4 Binding to JAM1—To determine whether the peptides selected by phage display mimic an actual epitope of JAM1, competition assays were performed.

https://openalex.org/W2135600793,"Rapid restoration of prestimulus levels of the chemotactic response regulator, CheY-P, is important for preparing bacteria and archaea to respond sensitively to new stimuli. In an extension of previous work (Szurmant, H., Bunn, M. W., Cannistraro, V. J., and Ordal, G. W. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 48611–48616), we describe a new family of CheY-P phosphatases, the CYX family, that is widespread among the bacteria and archaea. These proteins provide another pathway, in addition to the ones involving CheZ of the γ- and β-proteobacteria (e.g. Escherichia coli) or the alternative CheY that serves as a “phosphate sink” among the α-proteobacteria (e.g. Sinorhizobium meliloti), for dephosphorylating CheY-P. In particular, we identify CheC, known previously to be involved in adaptation to stimuli in Bacillus subtilis, as a CheY-P phosphatase. Using an in vitro assay used previously to demonstrate that the switch protein FliY is a CheY-P phosphatase, we have shown that increasing amounts of CheC accelerate the hydrolysis of CheY-P. In vivo, a double mutant lacking cheC and the region of fliY that encodes the CheY-P binding domain is almost completely smooth swimming, implying that these cells contain very high levels of CheY-P. CheC appears to be primarily involved in restoring normal CheY-P levels following the addition of attractant, whereas FliY seems to act on CheY-P constitutively. The activity of CheC is relatively low compared to that of FliY, but we have shown that the chemotaxis protein CheD enhances the activity of CheC 5-fold. We suggest a model for how FliY, CheC, and CheD work together to regulate CheY-P levels in the bacterium.

We suggest a model for how FliY, CheC, and CheD work together to regulate CheY-P levels in the bacterium. Chemotaxis is the process by which bacteria travel to higher concentrations of attractant or lower concentrations of repellent. Peritrichously flagellated bacteria like Bacillus subtilis rotate their flagella counterclockwise (CCW) 1The abbreviations used are: CCW, counterclockwise; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. 1The abbreviations used are: CCW, counterclockwise; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. to swim smoothly and rotate them clockwise to tumble. A tumble consists of a random motion without forward progress that reorients the cell for the next smooth swim. Binding of attractants to the B. subtilis receptors, the methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs), leads to activation of the associated CheA kinase (1Fuhrer D.K. Ordal G.W. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7443-7448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Bischoff D.S. Ordal G.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and rapid production of CheY-P. This activation is facilitated by the coupling proteins CheW and CheV (3Rosario M.M. Fredrick K.L. Ordal G.W. Helmann J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2736-2739Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CheY-P interacts with FliM to increase the probability of CCW flagellar rotation (for reviews see Refs. 4Armitage J.P. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1999; 41: 229-289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Stock J.B. Surette M.G. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M.

Sonenshein A.L. Losick R. Hoch J.A. Bacillus subtilis and Its Closest Relatives: From Genes to Cells. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2002: 437-452Google Scholar). Interestingly, in Escherichia coli an attractant stimulus decreases CheA activity and therefore lowers the CheY-P concentration in the cell. Additionally, the default rotation of the flagella is CCW in E. coli, and CheY-P binds FliM to induce clockwise rotation (reviewed in Refs. 4Armitage J.P. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1999; 41: 229-289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Stock J.B. Surette M.G. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 1103-1129Google Scholar). However, the final output, which is to increase CCW rotation and therefore lengthen the duration of smooth swimming upon sensing attractant stimuli, remains conserved between the two organisms.Following the activation of CheA in B. subtilis, the bacteria have to be able to adapt to the presence of a stimulus in order to orient their direction of movement up the gradient to ever higher concentrations of attractant. Adaptation is achieved by a system that reversibly methylates the receptors at conserved glutamate residues (reviewed in Ref. 7Mowbray S.L. Mol. Cells. 1999; 9: 115-118PubMed Google Scholar) and by the phosphorylation of CheV (8Karatan E. Saulmon M.M. Bunn M.W. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43618-43626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Besides reducing receptor activity, it is also important as part of adaptation to reduce the levels of CheY-P. In E. coli and other γ- and β-proteobacteria, CheZ catalyzes dephosphorylation of CheY-P (9Hess J.F. Oosawa K. Kaplan N. Simon M.I. Cell. 1988; 53: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). However, most chemotactic bacteria do not encode a CheZ homolog (6Aizawa S.I. Zhulin I.B. Marquez-Magana L. Ordal G.W. Sonenshein A.L. Losick R. Hoch J.A. Bacillus subtilis and Its Closest Relatives: From Genes to Cells. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2002: 437-452Google Scholar). Recently, FliY, a flagellar switch protein of B. subtilis, was found to have a similar activity (10Szurmant H. Bunn M.W. Cannistraro V.J. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48611-48616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Although homologs of this protein can be found in most chemotactic Gram-positive bacteria and some spirochetes, most bacteria do not encode FliY. However, CheC, a homolog of the N-terminal portion of FliY, exists in many organisms, including B. subtilis and the archaea (11Kirby J.R. Kristich C.J. Saulmon M.M. Zimmer M.A. Garrity L.F. Zhulin I.B. Ordal G.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). In particular, two regions of 31 amino acids, which we termed CYX1 and CYX2 (for CheC, FliY, and CheX), are very similar in these homologs (Fig. 1B).CheC was identified as a chemotaxis protein because a cheC mutant shows clear defects in chemotactic ability (12Rosario M.M. Kirby J.R. Bochar D.A. Ordal G.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3823-3831Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, a biochemical role for CheC has remained elusive. Here, we show that CheC shares the ability of FliY to increase the rate of CheY-P hydrolysis in vitro. Additionally, the chemotaxis protein CheD, which was previously discovered to bind CheC (13Rosario M.M. Ordal G.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), can augment CheC activity. Studies on cheC and fliYΔ6–15 single mutants (used because a fliY null mutant is not flagellated; Refs. 10Szurmant H. Bunn M.W. Cannistraro V.J. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48611-48616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar and 14Bischoff D.S. Ordal G.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2715-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and a cheC fliYΔ6–15 double mutant provided evidence of the importance of this phosphatase in vivo. To gain insight into why B. subtilis encodes two proteins with apparently redundant functions, the specific activity and per-cell copy number for both proteins was determined. Based on our findings, we propose a model for the function of these two proteins in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals, Columns, Enzymes, and Growth Media—All chemicals were reagent grade.

Open table in a new tab Strains deleted for fliY and cheC were constructed by gene conversion. Briefly, genomic DNA from strain OI2852 (fliY::cat) was transformed into OI3135 selecting for CmR. The resulting strain was transformed with pHS108, selecting for KanR and screening for loss of CmR, to demonstrate gene conversion. Colonies were cured for the plasmid by the loss of KanR during repeated growth in LB medium in the absence of antibiotics. This procedure resulted in strain OI4141. Strain OI4141 was transformed with plasmids pHS111 and pHS110 to produce strain OI4139 and OI4140, respectively. Plasmids pTM18 (pGEX-6P-2-CheC) and pTM25 (pGEX-6P-2-CheD) were made by amplifying cheC or cheD by PCR, introducing 5′ BamHI and 3′ EcoRI sites and excluding the ATG start codon for cheC or cheD. The PCR products were cloned into the respective restriction sites of pGEX-6P-2.Protein Overexpression and Purification—CheY, CheA, and FliY were overexpressed and purified as described previously (10Szurmant H. Bunn M.W. Cannistraro V.J. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48611-48616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). FliYΔ6–15 was purified as described for FliY; however, a phenyl-Sepharose column (high substituent) was used instead of an octyl-Sepharose-column. CheC and CheD were overexpressed and purified as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, and the GST tag was cleaved and removed as described for CheA (10Szurmant H. Bunn M.W. Cannistraro V.J. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48611-48616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).Dephosphorylation Assay—The dephosphorylation assay was performed essentially as described (10Szurmant H. Bunn M.W. Cannistraro V.J. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48611-48616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, 25 μm CheA was phosphorylated by incubation with [γ-32P]ATP (33 μm, 12.5 μCi/μl) for 30 min in a total volume of 120 μl of TKMD (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 0,2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol). The remaining [γ-32P]ATP was removed by desalting, using a BioRad Micro-Bio-Spin column. The resulting CheA-32P was added to premixed CheY-CheC (and sometimes CheD) solutions, resulting in a final concentration of 20 μm CheY, 10 μm CheA-P, various concentrations of CheC (and CheD), and 5 mm cold ATP in TKMD. Aliquots were taken at the indicated times by pipetting 10 μl of each reaction into 10 μl of 2 × SDS buffer containing 100 mm EDTA and separated by SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide). The gel was exposed to a phosphor-imaging screen and developed using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager from Amersham Biosciences. Each assay was run in duplicate.Phosphate Release Assay—In this assay, the evolution of inorganic phosphate (Pi) was measured by the EnzCheck phosphate assay kit (Molecular Probes), essentially as described (15Boesch K.C. Silversmith R.E. Bourret R.B. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3544-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Release rates for different amounts of CheY-P-hydrolyzing proteins allow for determination of specific release rates and direct comparison of activities. Briefly, 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleoside (MESG; 200 μm), monophosphate imidazole (3 mm, synthesized as described in Ref. 16Rathlev T. Rosenberg T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1956; 65: 319-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and CheC, FliY, or FliYΔ6–15 at the concentrations indicated were mixed in a final volume of 930 μl of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 10 mm Mg2Cl and incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. Following this incubation, mixtures were added to a cuvette. After the addition of 10 μl (1 unit) of nucleoside phosphorylase, the absorbance at 360 nm was measured. The absorbance stabilized after 30 s, and the phosphate flow through CheY was initiated by the addition of 6 μm CheY (resulting in a final volume of 1 ml). Pi release rates were followed for 3 min at 25 °C. Using a standard curve that relates Pi concentration to absorbance at 360 nm, release rates were calculated in micromolars per minute. For these measurements, a temperature-controlled Shimadzu BioSpec-1601 spectrophotometer was used.Determination of Copy Numbers for FliY and CheC—Strain OI1085 was grown as described previously for pulse-labeled methylation experiments (17Ullah A.H. Ordal G.W. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 958-965Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 100-μl aliquot of a 2-ml overnight culture was added to 10 ml of LB and grown to early stationary phase at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with chemotaxis buffer (10 mm potassium phosphate pH 7, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05 mm calcium chloride, 0.3 mm ammonium sulfate, 0.05% glycerol, and 1.5 mm sodium lactate) and once with protoplast buffer (25 potassium phosphate pH 7, 10 mm magnesium chloride, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20% sucrose, and 30 mm sodium lactate) supplemented with 250 μg/ml chloramphenicol and diluted to A600 nm = 1 in 5 ml of protoplast buffer. Serial dilutions of this suspension were plated on tryptose blood agar base plates to determine cell count. Lysozyme was added to a concentration of 4 mg/ml to the suspension to produce protoplasts. Following incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, protoplasts were collected by centrifugation and lysed in a 500-μl1× SDS solubilizer by boiling for 10 min. Then, 10 μl of lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE (12%) in parallel with purified FliY or CheC at various known concentrations. Proteins were visualized immunologically, essentially as described (18Kirby J.R. Niewold T.B. Maloy S. Ordal G.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the low copy numbers of CheC required anti-CheC antibody to be preabsorbed as described (19Harlow E. Lane D. Cuddihy J. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1988: 632-633Google Scholar). Antibody dilutions were 1:50000 for the anti-FliY-antibody and 1:100 for the anti-CheC-antibody. Bands were quantified using ImageQuant software that allows calculated copy numbers for CheC and FliY from the standard curves with purified protein and the cell counts from the serial dilutions.Tethered Cell Assay—The tethered cell assay was performed essentially as described (20Kirby J.R. Saulmon M.M. Kristich C.J. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11092-11100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, fliYΔ6–15 expression was induced with 0.1 mm IPTG 3 h after inoculating the culture. The response of each strain was based on the average bias of a population of at least 20 cells.Swarm Assay for Chemotaxis—The swarm assay was performed as described (21Zimmer M.A. Szurmant H. Saulmon M.M. Collins M.A. Bant J.S. Ordal G.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 555-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, semi-solid agar plates contained 0.1 mm IPTG to achieve wild-type expression levels of fliY and fliYΔ6–15 in strains OI4140 and OI4139, respectively.Capillary Assay for Chemotaxis—The capillary assay was performed as described for E. coli (22Adler J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1973; 74: 77-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar) but modified as described for B. subtilis (21Zimmer M.A. Szurmant H. Saulmon M.M. Collins M.A. Bant J.S. Ordal G.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 555-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar); the expression of fliYΔ6–15 was induced with 0.1 mm IPTG 2.5 h before harvesting the culture. Each experiment was performed on two different days in duplicate to ensure reproducibility.RESULTSCheC Increases the Rate of CheY-P Hydrolysis—Recently, we showed that the flagellar switch protein FliY is capable of increasing the rate of CheY-P hydrolysis (10Szurmant H. Bunn M.W. Cannistraro V.J. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48611-48616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Because CheC and FliY share substantial sequence similarities (11Kirby J.R. Kristich C.J. Saulmon M.M. Zimmer M.A. Garrity L.F. Zhulin I.B. Ordal G.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we wanted to test whether these proteins share the same function. In the absence of CheC, detectable levels of CheY-P remained after 240 s, whereas in the presence of equimolar concentrations of CheY-P and CheC, essentially all of CheY-P was hydrolyzed by the 60-s time point (Fig. 2). We conclude that CheC and FliY share a common function as CheY-P-hydrolyzing proteins.Fig. 2CheY-P hydrolysis assay. Shown are time points tracking dephosphorylation of CheY-P. Lanes 1 and 18 contained 10 μm CheA-P before the addition of 20 μm CheY. After the addition of CheY, 15, 60, 120 and 240 s time points were taken in the presence of 0 (lanes 2–5), 0.5 (lanes 6–9), 2 (lanes 10–13), and 10 μm CheC (lanes 14–17). See “Experimental Procedures” for details.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)FliY Is More Active than CheC in Vitro—It appears that CheC activity is substantially lower than that of FliY in the dephosphorylation assay described above. To quantify this difference, a spectrophotometric assay was used to measure the production of inorganic phosphate, Pi, over time. This assay was used previously to compare activities of different E. coli CheZ mutants (15Boesch K.C. Silversmith R.E. Bourret R.B. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3544-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). At low concentrations of CheC or FliY relative to CheY-P, the relationship between protein concentration and the Pi release rate was linear (Fig. 3, A and B). Specific rates calculated from the slopes allow for comparison of FliY and CheC activity. The micromolar-specific activities are 49 μm Pi formed per minute per μm FliY, and 3.1 μm Pi formed per min per μm CheC. Therefore, the activity of CheC is only ∼6% of that of FliY. Additionally, the activity of FliYΔ6–15, a mutant defective in binding CheY-P (10Szurmant H. Bunn M.W. Cannistraro V.J. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48611-48616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), was determined to be ∼20% of that of FliY, indicating that this mutant is still more active than CheC, at least in vitro.Fig. 3Phosphate release assay for FliY, CheC, and FliYΔ6–15.A, phosphate release rates in relation to concentrations of CheC (white squares), FliY (dark diamonds), and FliYΔ6–15 (white triangles). B, enlargement of the linear area framed in panel A, which was used to calculate specific Pi release rates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)FliY Does Not Affect CheC Activity—We also wanted to explore whether the activity of CheC can be affected in a synergistic manner by the presence of FliY. To test this possibility, a constant amount of FliY (0.02 mm) and varying amounts of CheC were present in all hydrolyzing reactions at concentrations within the linear range. A decrease or increase in the specific rate of CheY-P hydrolysis by CheC would indicate either negative or positive cooperativity, respectively. However, no change was observed, indicating that FliY and CheC hydrolyze CheY-P independently (data not shown).CheC Can Be Activated by CheD—CheD was identified as having receptor glutamine deamidase activity (23Kristich C.J. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25356-25362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Additionally, it was shown to interact with CheC, although no consequence of this interaction had been discovered (13Rosario M.M. Ordal G.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We found that CheD had no effect on CheY-P stability by itself, but it clearly enhanced CheY-P hydrolysis in the presence of CheC (Fig. 4). Under the conditions used, CheC (2 μm) was calculated to be 5.3-fold more active in the presence than in the absence of 4 μm CheD, or ∼30% as active as FliY. We conclude that CheD specifically interacts with CheC to increase phosphatase activity.Fig. 4CheD activates CheC. This assay was performed as in Fig. 2. CheC and CheD concentrations were as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)A cheC fliYΔ6–15 Double Mutant Is Not Capable of Performing Chemotaxis—In the swarm assay, strains are stabbed onto a low agar, low nutrient, semi-solid medium. As the cells metabolize the nutrient, they create an attractant gradient, which they sense and migrate toward and thus form a characteristic ring. Because the cheZ null mutant of E. coli does not show chemotaxis as measured by this assay (24Parkinson J.S. Houts S.E. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 106-113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we wanted to see how the single cheC and fliY mutants compare to the double mutant in this assay. Because a fliY strain is not flagellated, we used the CheY-P binding mutant fliYΔ6–15. Both the cheC and fliYΔ6–15 strains showed somewhat impaired chemotaxis (Fig. 5). The double mutant was incapable of forming a ring on a swarm plate, as seen for the cheZ null mutant of E. coli. We note that reduced ring sizes on swarm plates can reflect problems in signal transduction or suboptimal flagellar rotational biases. The fliY and cheC fliY strains were almost fully complemented to wild-type and cheC swarm diameters, respectively, when they expressed fliY+ located at the amyE locus (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Swarming ability of cheC, fliYΔ6–15, and cheC fliYΔ6–15 mutants in comparison with strain OI1085 (wild type).A, representative swarm plate for the indicated strains. B, the average swarm diameter, expressed relative to the wild type, is shown for wild type (OI1085), cheC (OI3135), fliYΔ6–15 (OI4106), fliY+ (OI3942), cheC fliYΔ6–15 (OI4139), and cheC fliY+ (OI4140). Strain OI4140 is for ΔfliY amyE::fliYWT. Error bars represent the S.D. from the mean calculated for 20 swarms.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The traditional quantitative assay of chemotaxis is the capillary assay. In this assay, the single mutants were 10-fold reduced in chemotaxis toward asparagine, and the cheC fliYΔ6–15 double mutant showed no chemotactic response, consistent with the results from swarm plates (Fig. 6).Fig. 6Capillary assays with cheC, fliYΔ6–15, and cheC fliYΔ6–15 mutants in comparison with OI1085 (wild type). and The symbols their meanings are as follows: black diamonds, OI1085; white triangles, OI3135; black squares, OI4106; and white circles, OI4139. Note the logarithmic scale.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The cheC fliYΔ6–15 Strain Shows a 100% CCW Rotational Bias in the Tethered Cell Assay—To explore the nature of the chemotactic defect in the double mutant cheCfliYΔ6–15 further, this strain was subjected to the tethered cell assay, which measures flagellar rotational bias of individual cells. The average bias for a population of cells is presumed to reflect mean CheY-P levels in those cells. The double mutant had a very high CCW rotational bias, and very few cells ever spun clockwise (Fig. 7). The average bias was even higher than that of a fliYΔ6–15 single mutant (10Szurmant H. Bunn M.W. Cannistraro V.J. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48611-48616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), which is shown (Fig. 7) for comparison. The cheC mutant did not show an increased bias before an attractant was added; however, it was impaired in adaptation, as described previously (11Kirby J.R. Kristich C.J. Saulmon M.M. Zimmer M.A. Garrity L.F. Zhulin I.B. Ordal G.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).Fig. 7Tethered cell assay with chemotaxis mutants. Strains were as follows: wild type (OI1085) (thick dotted line); cheC (OI3135) (thin solid line); fliYΔ6–15 (OI4106) (thin dotted line); and cheC fliYΔ6–15 (OI4139) (thick solid line).

https://openalex.org/W2128741634,"AML1 (RUNX1) is one of the most frequently disrupted genes in human leukemias. AML1 encodes transcription factors, which play a pivotal role in hematopoietic differentiation, and their inappropriate expression is associated with leukemic transformation of hematopoietic cells. Previous studies demonstrated that the transcription cofactor p300 binds to the C-terminal region of AML1 and stimulates AML1-dependent transcription during myeloid cell differentiation. Here, we report that AML1 is specifically acetylated by p300 in vitro. Mutagenesis analyses reveal that p300 acetylates AML1 at the two conserved lysine residues (Lys-24 and Lys-43). AML1 is subject to acetylation at the same sites in vivo, and p300-mediated acetylation significantly augments the DNA binding activity of AML1. Disruption of these two lysines severely impairs DNA binding of AML1 and reduced the transcriptional activity and the transforming potential of AML1. Taken together, these data indicate that acetylation of AML1 through p300 is a critical manner of posttranslational modification and identify a novel mechanism for regulating the function of AML1.

AML1 (PEBP2αB, core binding factor α2, or RUNX1) and its cofactor PEBP2β/core binding factor β are the most frequent targets of chromosomal translocations in human leukemias (1Rubnitz J.E. Look A.T. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1998; 5: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The AML1 gene was identified through its involvement in the (8;21) translocation, which rearranges the AML1 gene on chromosome 21q22 and the ETO (MTG8) gene on chromosome 8q22, resulting in the generation of the AML1-ETO fusion protein (2Erickson P.

The AML1 gene encodes a transcription factor containing an N-terminal DNA-binding domain that is highly homologous to the Drosophila pair-rule protein Runt, which is called the Runt domain (9Kania M.A. Bonner A.S. Duffy J.B. Gergen J.P. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1701-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). AML1 binds to the core enhancer DNA sequence, TG(T/c)GGT, called the PEBP2 site, through the Runt domain. Its affinity for DNA is markedly increased by heterodimerization with PEBP2β (10Kagoshima H.

In addition, AML1 exhibits the transforming activity when expressed in fibroblasts, and this activity requires both the Runt domain and the C-terminal transcriptional regulatory domain called the PST region (19Kurokawa M. Tanaka T. Tanaka K. Ogawa S. Mitani K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 883-892PubMed Google Scholar). At least four forms of the AML1 proteins are produced by alternative splicing, termed AML1a, AML1b, AML1c, and AML1ΔN (20Miyoshi H. Ohira M. Shimizu K. Mitani K. Hirai H. Imai T. Yokoyama K. Soeda E.

Conversely, AML1 can repress transcription by associating with corepressors such as Groucho/transducin-like Enhancer of split and mSin3A (31Aronson B.D. Fisher A.L. Blechman K. Caudy M. Gergen J.P.

Thus, AML1 appears to act as an “organizing” factor of transcription by interacting with a wide variety of transcription regulators. In contrast, regulatory mechanisms for AML1 function remain elusive thus far. Previously, we reported that AML1 is phosphorylated through the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1The abbreviations used are: ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; HAT, histone acetyltransferase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; CBP, CREB-binding protein; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; luc, luciferase; PST region, a proline-, serine-, and threonine-rich region; P/CAF, p300/CBP-associated factor; M-CSF receptor, macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor. 1The abbreviations used are: ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; HAT, histone acetyltransferase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; CBP, CREB-binding protein; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; luc, luciferase; PST region, a proline-, serine-, and threonine-rich region; P/CAF, p300/CBP-associated factor; M-CSF receptor, macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor.

ERK-dependent phosphorylation potentiates the transactivation ability and the transforming capacity of AML1 through regulating interaction between AML1 and mSin3A (35Imai Y. Kurokawa M. Yamaguchi Y.

Thus, the function of AML1 is also regulated through the signal transduction pathways. Acetylation has recently emerged as the central mode of regulation for a significant number of transcription factors (36Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar, 37Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2356) Google Scholar). p300 and the related protein CBP are highly conserved proteins that have a pivotal role in transcriptional regulation, bridging a wide variety of DNA-binding proteins to components of the general transcriptional machinery (38Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, p300 and CBP possess histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, which is able to acetylate histone and non-histone proteins. Histone acetylation is linked to transcriptional activation and participates in the nucleosomal remodeling that accompanies gene activity (39Turner B.M. CMLS Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Recently, HATs have been shown to also acetylate a significant number of non-histone proteins, which include transcription factors such as p53, Drosophila T-cell receptor, erythroid kruppel-like factor, GATA-1, GATA-3, and the high mobility group protein I/Y (40Bannister A.J. Miska E.A. CMLS Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1184-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 41Chen H. Tini M. Evans R.M. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 2001; 13: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Acetylation of these factors leads to changes in protein-protein and protein-DNA interaction, which subsequently result in altered gene expression (42Sterner D.E. Berger S.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 435-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar). Here we report that AML1 is acetylated by p300 at the two lysine residues located in the N terminus adjacent to the Runt domain. Acetylation of AML1 significantly increases the amount of AML1 bound to DNA and results in stimulation of AML1-dependent transcription. Substitution of target residues uncovered a close relationship between the acetylation and the in vivo function of AML1. Our studies demonstrate that acetylation is a critical manner of posttranslational modification of AML1. Cell Cultures—COS7, 293T, HeLa, and NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. M1 cells and MOLT-4 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and α-minimal essential medium by one to one and RPMI 1640 medium, respectively, which contain penicillin, streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum. Plasmid Constructions and Recombinant Proteins—pGEX-AML1-(1-189), pGEX-K24R/K43R-(1-189), and pGEX-K24A/K43A-(1-189) were obtained by cloning the PCR fragments corresponding to amino acids 1-189 of AML1, K24R/K43R, and K24A/K43A into the pGEX2T vector, respectively. For construction of FLAG-tagged P/CAF-HAT/Br and GCN5, the DNA fragments corresponding to amino acids 352-832 and amino acids 1-477, respectively, were amplified by PCR and subcloned into pFLAG-MAC (Kodak).

The AML1 K24R, K43R, K24R/K43R, K24A/K43A, K182R, K188R, and K182R/K188R were obtained by replacing the lysine residues with arginines and alanines, respectively, by the site-directed mutagenesis method (46Kunkel T.A.

For detection of p300 and AML1 proteins, the indicated cells were lysed in the buffer containing 350 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5% Igepal, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm sodium butyrate, 1 μg of aprotinin/ml, 1 μg of pepstatin/ml, 1 μg of leupeptin/ml, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride followed by incubation for 30 min on ice. Whole cell lysates containing 100 μg of proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon, Millipore). The membranes were blocked with 10% skim milk, treated with anti-p300 (RW128, Upstate Biotechnology), anti-AML1, anti-FLAG (M2; Sigma), or anti-PEBP2β, washed, and reacted with the mouse or rabbit anti-IgG antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase. The blots were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in the above buffer and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-PST or anti-AML1 (PC284L; Oncogene) followed by absorption to protein A-Sepharose (Sigma). Immunoprecipitates were washed, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed with anti-p300 as described above. In Vivo Sodium [3H]Acetate Labeling—MOLT-4 cells were grown to 2 × 107 cells, washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in RPMI labeling medium (1 mCi of 3H-sodium acetate (Amersham Biosciences) per ml and 50 nm trichostatin A (Wako)), and then incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. pME18S-AML1 and mutants either with or without FLAG tag were transfected with pcDEF3-p300 as described above into COS7 cells. After 30 h, cells were exposed to 1 mCi of sodium [3H]acetate/ml in the presence of 50 nm trichostatin A for 90 min. Lysates were prepared and processed using either anti-PST or anti-FLAG as described above and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon, Millipore) and analyzed using BAS2000 Image Analyzer (Fuji Film). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—The M4 probe containing a partial A core of the polyomavirus enhancer was produced as described elsewhere (50Furukawa K. Yamaguchi Y. Ogawa E. Shigesada K. Satake M. Ito Y. Cell Growth & Differ. 1990; 1: 135-147PubMed Google Scholar). Five micrograms of GST fusion proteins were collected on glutathione-Sepharose beads, incubated with purified FLAG-p300-HAT in the presence or absence of 10 nm acetyl-CoA (Amersham Biosciences). Then, reaction mixtures were eluted from the beads in glutathione elution buffer (10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)). GST-PEBP2β collected on glutathione-Sepharose beads was incubated in the thrombin (Amersham Biosciences) reaction mixture at room temperature for 16 h, and then centrifuged, and supernatant containing PEBP2β cleaved off from GST was collected. The recovered proteins were quantified by Coomassie staining, and 100 ng of these proteins were incubated with 1 ng of M4 probe in the buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 4% Ficoll (W/V), 10 mm EDTA, 40 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 300 ng of poly(dI-dC) for 30 min at room temperature in the presence or absence of PEBP2β. Seventy ng of unlabeled M4 probe were added as a cold competitor. Reaction mixtures were subjected to EMSA as described previously (45Tanaka T. Tanaka K. Ogawa S. Kurokawa M. Mitani K. Nishida J.

Luciferase Assays—HeLa cells were transfected by using SuperFect (Qiagen) with pM-CSF-R-luc and plasmids expressing wild type AML1, K24R/K43R, or K24A/K43A in the presence or absence of p300 expression plasmids. Fifty ng/ml trichostatin A was added 8 h prior to harvest. Luciferase activity was determined 48 h later, as described previously (51Tanaka T. Nishida J. Mitani K. Ogawa S. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24020-24026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A plasmid expressing β-galactosidase was co-transfected as an internal control of transfection efficiency, and the data were normalized to the β-galactosidase activity, as described previously (51Tanaka T.

Soft Agar Assays—Soft agar assays were performed according to procedures described elsewhere (19Kurokawa M. Tanaka T. Tanaka K. Ogawa S. Mitani K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H.

Colonies were counted after 14 days of culture in soft agar if they were larger than 0.25 mm in diameter. AML1 Interacts with p300 in Vivo—p300 and CBP are known to interact with a variety of transcriptional factors as coactivators. Recently, a physical interaction between AML1 and p300 was demonstrated (23Kitabayashi I. Yokoyama A. Shimizu K. Ohki M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2994-3004Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). To confirm the interaction of endogenous AML1 with p300 in hematopoietic cells, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments using M1 cells, a murine leukemic cell line. Whole cell lysates were prepared from M1 cells and subjected to immunoprecipitation with the anti-AML1 antibody or control preimmune serum. Immunoblot analysis with the p300-specific antibody showed that the precipitate with anti-AML1 contained p300, whereas p300 protein was never detected in the precipitate obtained with control preimmune serum (Fig. 1). These results indicate that AML1 forms complexes with p300 in vivo in agreement with previous findings (23Kitabayashi I. Yokoyama A. Shimizu K. Ohki M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2994-3004Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). p300 Specifically Acetylates AML1 in Vitro—Association of p300 with AML1, together with the recent demonstration of its acetyltransferase activity on a variety of transcription factors, prompted us to determine whether AML1 is a substrate for acetylation by p300. AML1 possesses nine lysine residues, which become potential targets for acetylation. To examine whether AML1 could be acetylated by p300 directly, the in vitro acetylation assays were performed using bacterially expressed FLAG-tagged HAT domain of p300 (p300-HAT). GST was fused to a region between amino acids 1 and 189 of AML1 (AML1-(1-189)), which contains all nine lysine residues, and the GST fusion protein was expressed in the BL21 bacterial host and purified (Fig. 2A). GST-AML1-(1-189) was incubated with p300-HAT in the presence of [14C]acetyl-CoA. Use of these highly purified recombinant proteins eliminates possible contamination by other HATs. As shown in Fig. 2B, GST-AML1-(1-189) was specifically labeled with [14C]acetyl-CoA in the presence of p300-HAT, whereas no signal was detected for GST alone. The faster migrating bands were considered to represent degraded products of the acetylated AML1 protein because the purified GST-AML1-(1-189) that served as a substrate contains identically migrating bands. In contrast, GST-AML1-(1-189) was never labeled without p300-HAT. We further investigated whether other HATs can acetylate AML1 using P/CAF and its close homologue GCN5. The HAT/bromodomain of P/CAF (P/CAF-HAT/Br) and full-length GCN5 were tagged with FLAG, expressed bacterially, and subsequently used in the in vitro acetylation assays. The results in Fig. 2B show that neither P/CAF-HAT/Br nor GCN5 acetylated GST-AML1-(1-189) at all. As shown in Fig. 2C, the HAT activities of p300-HAT, P/CAF-HAT/Br, and GCN5 were confirmed by using histones as substrates. p300-HAT could acetylate histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, whereas only histones H3 and H4 were acetylated by P/CAF-HAT/Br and GCN5, which is in agreement with the previous reports (42Sterner D.E. Berger S.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 435-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results unequivocally indicate that AML1 can be a specific substrate for p300-mediated acetylation in vitro. In Vivo Acetylation of AML1—Next, we went on further to examine whether acetylation of AML1 occurs in vivo to manifest a physiological relevance of in vitro acetylation of AML1. First, we wished to determine whether endogenous AML1 in hematopoietic cells was also acetylated. For these experiments, we pulse-labeled MOLT-4 cells, a human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, with [3H]acetate in the presence of a histone deacetylase inhibitor (trichostatin A) and then subjected them to cell lysis and immunoprecipitation with anti-AML1. As shown in Fig. 3A, anti-AML1, but not control preimmune serum, precipitated [3H]acetate-labeled AML1 (lanes 2 and 3). Immunoblot analysis with the same antibody revealed migration of endogenous AML1 (lane 1). These results directly provide evidence that AML1 is endogenously acetylated in hematopoietic cells. To define the positions within AML1 to be acetylated by p300, we then employed transient transfection into COS7 cells. First, cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged full-length AML1 and p300 and labeled with sodium [3H]acetate in the same manner performed above. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody and subjected to immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3B, AML1 was efficiently recovered from AML1-transfected cells with anti-FLAG. The immunoprecipitated AML1 protein was specifically labeled with [3H]acetate as in MOLT-4 cells (Fig. 3B, right). Next, we employed three types of serial deletion mutants to cover all nine lysines (Fig. 2A). These FLAG-tagged mutants were expressed in COS7 cells together with p300 and subjected to the in vivo acetylation assays. Fig. 3B shows that these mutants are expressed in COS7 cells in the anticipated sizes. Acetylation of AML1 was retained when amino acids 47-172 in the Runt domain or amino acids 173-188 in C-terminal region adjacent to the Runt domain are deleted (lanes 9 and 10). In contrast, deletion of N-terminal region (amino acids 23-64) flanked by the Runt domain completely abolished AML1 acetylation by p300 (lane 8). This region contains two lysine residues, Lys-24 and Lys-43. These two lysines are highly conserved among the Runt-containing protein family, with Lys-24 being completely conserved from the Zebrafish Runx1 to the human AML1 family members. These results suggest that either or both of these two N-terminal lysines are potentially acetylated by p300.

https://openalex.org/W2084255736,"MUC5AC mucins secreted by HT-29 cells in culture are oligomeric glycoproteins with characteristics similar to the MUC5AC mucins isolated from human airway sputum (Sheehan, J. K., Brazeau, C., Kutay, S., Pigeon, H., Kirkham, S., Howard, M., and Thornton, D. J. (2000) Biochem. J. 347, 37-44). Therefore we have used this cell line as a model system to investigate the biosynthesis of this major airway mucin. Initial experiments showed that the MUC5AC mucins isolated from the cells were liable to depolymerization depending on the conditions used for their solubilization. Prevention against reduction resulted in large oligomers associated with the cells, similar to those secreted into the medium. Using a combination of density gradient centrifugation and agarose gel electrophoresis coupled with probes specific for different forms of the mucin we identified five major intracellular populations of the MUC5AC polypeptide (unglycosylated monomer and dimer, GalNAc-substituted dimer, fully glycosylated dimer, and higher order oligomers). Pulse-chase studies were performed to follow the flow of radioactivity through these various intracellular forms into the mature oligomeric mucin secreted into the medium (a process taking ∼2-4 h). The results show that the mucin polypeptide undergoes dimerization and then becomes substituted with GalNAc residues prior to glycan elaboration to produce a mature mucin dimer, which then undergoes multimerization. These data indicate that this oligomeric mucin follows a similar assembly to the von Willebrand factor glycoprotein to yield long linear disulfide-linked chains.

In vertebrates, epithelia are protected on their luminal side by mucus gels synthesized and secreted by specialized cells in the surface and/or underlying submucosa. These gels act as a physical barrier as well as provide the infrastructure to support an array of protective molecules and mechanisms for sequestering chemical toxins and pathogens. Furthermore, they contribute to the homeostasis and stability of the underlying epithelium. The molecular framework of mucus is provided by large, oligomeric, O-linked glycoproteins termed mucins. These macromolecules are polydisperse in mass (2-40 MDa) and size (0.5-10 μm in length) and are assembled from a disulfide linkage of monomers (2-3 MDa) (1Carlstedt I. Lindgren H. Sheehan J.K.

Entanglement of the mucin chains is considered to be a major factor for gel formation, and as a consequence their size distribution is a key determinant of the physical properties of the mucus. In humans, four genes encoding oligomeric mucins have been identified: MUC5AC, MUC5B, MUC2, and MUC6, and these are found in a cluster on chromosome 11 (6Pigny P. Guyonnet-Duperat V. Hill A.S.

Their expression appears to be selectively controlled in a manner favoring tissue-specific expression, but the functional reasons for this are unclear. Sequence similarities of Cys-rich domains in the N and C termini of these mucins with another oligomeric, O-linked glycoprotein, von Willebrand factor (VWF), 1The abbreviations used are: VWF, von Willebrand factor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DTT, dithiothreitol; GdmCl, guanidinium chloride; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; TR, tandem repeat. suggest that mucins are assembled in a manner similar to VWF (7Perez-Vilar J. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31751-31754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Indeed, the consensus from biosynthetic studies (7Perez-Vilar J. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31751-31754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) and interactions of expressed N- and C-terminal domain constructs on human and animal oligomeric mucins indicate that aspects of assembly pathways are shared with VWF. It should be stressed, however, that most of these studies shed light only on the early stages in the process, and the whole pathway has not yet been elucidated for any of the oligomeric mucins. Moreover, recent data in the literature indicate that oligomeric mucins are not solely linear disulfide-linked assemblies (8Perez-Vilar J. Eckhardt A.E. DeLuca A. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14442-14449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 9Perez-Vilar J. Hill R.L. J. Biol.

For example, oligomeric MUC2 is assembled from disulfide bonds as well as another reduction-insensitive linkage and may form branched structures (11Axelsson M.A.B. Asker N. Hansson G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18862-18870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 12Herrmann A. Davies J.R. Lindell G. Martensson S. Packer N.H. Swallow D.M. Carlstedt I. J. Biol.

The polydispersity of oligomeric mucins may be because of proteolytic degradation within the mucus, but it may also arise as a direct consequence of the biosynthetic process, thus allowing cellular control over the physical properties of the mucus. Whereas intracellular proteolytic cleavage has been observed for the MUC5B mucin, its structural consequence has yet to be established (13Thornton D.J. Gray T. Nettesheim P. Howard M. Koo J.S. Sheehan J.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L1118-L1128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Wickstrom C. Carlstedt I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47116-47121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It is likely that in disease alterations in the biosynthetic process may yield mucins with altered macromolecular structure. For instance we have shown that the mucus from an individual in status asthmaticus was composed of MUC5B mucins with an extreme size and unusual network morphology (15Sheehan J.K. Howard M. Richardson P.S. Longwill T. Thornton D.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Because mucin chain length and organization can have profound effects on mucus rheology it is important to establish what factors impact on these aspects of mucin structure. Thus elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway is of biological and clinical importance. In this study we have focused on the biosynthesis of the MUC5AC mucin, which is a major component in respiratory and gastric mucus (16Thornton D.J. Carlstedt I. Howard M. Devine P.L. Price M.R. Sheehan J.K. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 967-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 17Kirkham S. Sheehan J.K. Knight D. Richardson P.S. Thornton D.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Recently we demonstrated that the molecular properties of this glycoprotein secreted from a sub-clone of the human carcinoma cell line HT-29 in culture were remarkably similar to the MUC5AC mucin obtained from human respiratory secretions (18Sheehan J.K. Brazeau C. Kutay S. Pigeon H. Kirkham S. Howard M. Thornton D.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Furthermore, evidence from electron microscopy, rate zonal centrifugation, light scattering, and agarose electrophoresis indicates that MUC5AC has a simple linear assembly like that of VWF. We have employed this cell line as a model system to study MUC5AC biosynthesis. Herein we describe an experimental approach using CsCl density gradient centrifugation and agarose gel electrophoresis, coupled with radioactive [35S]methionine pulse-chase studies and immunoprecipitation, to identify the molecular intermediates in the biogenesis of MUC5AC. Materials—Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B and l-[35S]methionine (37 MBq/1 mCi) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Triton X-100, sodium azide, l-methionine, dithiothreitol, iodoacetamide, antipain, chymostatin, leupeptin, pepstatin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, N-ethylmaleimide, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were all from Sigma. Urea, Tris, EDTA, and sodium chloride were from BDH (Poole, UK), and RPMI medium, RPMI without l-methionine, PBS, and agarose were from Invitrogen (Paisley, UK). Antibodies and Antisera—The monoclonal antibody Mab 2011 (anti-TR MUC5AC, 1:2000) was purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA), and the Mab CD175 clone, HB-Tn1 (anti-Tn, 1:200), was from DAKO, Ltd. (Cambridgeshire, UK). The polyclonal antiserum MAN-5ACI (1:10,000) has been described previously (16Thornton D.J. Carlstedt I. Howard M. Devine P.L. Price M.R. Sheehan J.K. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 967-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Agarose Gel Electrophoresis—Samples were electrophoresed on 0.7% (w/v) agarose gels in 40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, containing 0.1% SDS, for 16 h. After electrophoresis of unreduced samples, gels were subjected to reduction with 10 mm DTT in 4× SSC, pH 8.0, for 15 min (19Aksoy N. Thornton D.J. Corfield A. Paraskeva C. Sheehan J.K. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Mucins were transferred to nitrocellulose by vacuum blotting at 45 millibars for 2 h. Radiolabeled molecules were detected by phosphorimaging (BAS-1800, Fujiphoto Film Co. Ltd., Japan). Furthermore, mucins were also visualized by probing the blots with the two monoclonal antibodies or the MAN-5ACI polyclonal antiserum, and detection with enhanced chemiluminescence. Pulse-Chase Experiments—HT-29 intestinal cells, subclone A1, cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with l-glutamine containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, were used once until 90% confluence had been reached (75-cm2 flasks). For all experiments the cells were washed twice with PBS and then incubated at 37 °C for 2 h in methionine-free RPMI medium with l-glutamine. At 2 h, flasks were incubated for either 30 min, 1 h, or 2 h (see figure legends for specific times) at 37 °C with methionine-free RPMI medium plus 35S-labeled methionine (approximately 10 mm, specific activity approximately 200 Ci/mmol). At t = 0, flasks were washed twice with PBS and further incubated at 37 °C in 10× methionine medium (1 mm). In the first experiment, to determine the time course for MUC5AC synthesis and secretion, seven 75-cm2 flasks were used. At each of the time points (0, 2, 6, 12, and 24 h) the medium was changed and pooled from each flask; for the later time points (48 and 96 h), the medium was changed at 24-h intervals. Therefore, for the 48- and 96-h time points subsequent analyses were performed on the media collected only in the previous 24 h. At each time point, the cells were washed twice with PBS and then solubilized in 20 ml of 6 m guanidinium chloride (GdmCl). Both pooled media and the solubilized cells were made up to a concentration of 4 m GdmCl and subjected to CsCl density gradient centrifugation at a starting density of 1.4 g/ml as described below. The gradients were emptied into fractions, and mature MUC5AC molecules were detected with the MAN-5ACI antiserum and pooled. After reduction by the addition of 10% (v/v) 10× URB (6 m urea, 1 m Tris-HCl, 50 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm DTT) for 2 h at 37 °C followed by carboxymethylation by the addition of 25 mm iodoacetamide, the mucins were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis and then transferred to nitrocellulose by vacuum transfer (as described above). The relative specific activity of the reduced MUC5AC subunit band was assessed by determining the ratio of the antiserum response (MAN-5ACI) to 35S-labeled radioactivity (phosphorimaging). In subsequent experiments, cells were radiolabeled as above. At various time intervals media were collected, and the cells were washed twice with PBS and then lysed with cold lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm NEM, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml antipain, chymostatin, leupeptin, pepstatin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor (2 ml per flask)) by incubation with gentle agitation for 2 h at 4 °C. Cell lysates were then analyzed on 0.7% (w/v) agarose gels, either as intact molecules or after reduction by the addition of 10% (v/v) 10× URB for 2 h at 37 °C, followed by carboxymethylation by the addition of 25 mm iodoacetamide. In some experiments the various forms of the MUC5AC mucin were immunoprecipitated with MAN-5ACI, and then the precipitate was fractionated by CsCl density gradient centrifugation prior to agarose gel electrophoresis. Immunoprecipitation and CsCl Density Gradient Centrifugation—Immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.02% sodium azide) and cell lysates were mixed in equal volumes with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (10% w/v). The mixture was incubated for 1 h with mixing at 4 °C, and after centrifugation the resulting supernatant was added to fresh protein A-Sepharose containing a 1:100 dilution of MAN-5ACI and then incubated for 48-65 h at 4 °C with mixing. Three washes in immunoprecipitation buffer (without Triton X-100) preceded elution of bound molecules using two washes of 6 m GdmCl. The supernatants of these two washes were combined and subjected to CsCl, 4 m GdmCl isopycnic density gradient centrifugation, which was performed at a starting density of 1.4 g/ml at 40,000 rpm in a Beckman SW55 rotor for 48 h at 15 °C. Tubes were unloaded from the top into seventeen 300-μl fractions, which were then dialyzed against 6 m urea prior to electrophoresis on 0.7% (w/v) agarose gels. Electron Microscopy—Electron microscopy was preformed as described previously (18Sheehan J.K. Brazeau C. Kutay S. Pigeon H. Kirkham S. Howard M. Thornton D.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In brief, mucins were isolated by density gradient centrifugation and concentrated to yield stock solutions of approximately 50-100 μg/ml. After partial reduction (10 mm DTT for 10 s on ice) or mechanical fragmentation (10 times through a 21-gauge needle), mucin solutions were diluted 1:500 with 10 mm magnesium acetate. Drops (200 μl) of the diluted solution were put on to a strip of parafilm and touched with a pipette tip containing 1 μl of a 0.1% (w/v) solution of benzyl alkyl ammonium chloride in 10 mm magnesium acetate. Drops were allowed to stand for times varying from 1 to 10 min before being touched with 600-mesh grids covered with thin carbon films. The grids were washed in 0.1% uranyl acetate and then in 90% ethanol. Thereafter the grids were rotary shadowed with platinum evaporated at an angle of 5 degrees, and images were obtained using a Phillips 400 electron microscope. Contour lengths on photographically enlarged electron micrographs were measured with a Planix digital planimeter (Hall and Watts, London, UK). We have previously demonstrated that oligomeric MUC5AC mucins are secreted from an HT-29 cell line in the form of long linear threads containing in excess of 20 subunits, which can be depolymerized by reduction to yield-reduced subunits of molecular mass 2.2 MDa and a length of 570 nm (18Sheehan J.K. Brazeau C. Kutay S. Pigeon H. Kirkham S. Howard M. Thornton D.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In that study, fragmentation of these molecules by controlled reduction yielded ladders of bands, which were interpreted as linear assemblies of different numbers of subunits. Similar fragmentation data are presented here (Fig. 1A, inset), and a log10 molecular mass versus Rf plot has been constructed from MUC5AC mucin ladders created by partial reduction (Fig. 1A, inset, lane 1) or mechanical fragmentation (Fig. 1A, inset, lane 2). The linear nature of this plot is consistent with the end to end unitary assembly of molecules of fixed charge per unit length. In agreement with the electron microscopy performed on the partially reduced mucin preparation, Fig. 1B shows linear molecules with lengths of approximately 500 nm, consistent with subunits (18Sheehan J.K. Brazeau C. Kutay S. Pigeon H. Kirkham S. Howard M. Thornton D.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and other linear fragments two and three times as long (Fig. 1B). These data demonstrate, as predicted from the agarose gel banding pattern, the presence of monomers, dimers, and trimers in this preparation (Fig. 1A, inset, lane 1). From a biosynthetic perspective both the electrophoretic and electron microscopic data are consistent with a linear model of assembly for MUC5AC mucins. Agarose gel electrophoresis of solubilized human respiratory tract mucus collected from four different individuals shows that the MUC5AC mucins are polydisperse, and the sputum is composed mostly of mixtures of oligomers containing different numbers of subunits (Fig. 2). Based on Rf values it is clear that some of the ladders are composed of dimeric units, whereas others contain mixtures of both odd and even numbers of subunits. Thus, the size spectrum of the mucin can vary greatly within and between individuals. Therefore, to investigate whether this arises as part of the biosynthetic process we have utilized HT-29 cells in culture as a model system to study MUC5AC mucin assembly. The MUC5AC mucin secreted into the medium by these cells has characteristics similar to its counterpart produced by human airways in that it is a distinctively glycosylated, oligomeric, linear glycoprotein of high molecular weight (Fig. 3A) (18Sheehan J.K. Brazeau C. Kutay S. Pigeon H. Kirkham S. Howard M. Thornton D.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). By contrast, solubilization of the cells with 6 m GdmCl at pH 8 yielded mucins that were predominantly in the form of monomers and dimers (Fig. 3A). This is in agreement with our recent study of the MUC5AC and MUC5B mucins synthesized by normal human tracheobronchial cells in culture (13Thornton D.J. Gray T. Nettesheim P. Howard M. Koo J.S. Sheehan J.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L1118-L1128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that suggests that mucins associated with the cells (mainly dimers) were smaller than those secreted into the medium (large oligomers). From this study we initially concluded that the mucins were oligomerized during or after secretion (13Thornton D.J. Gray T. Nettesheim P. Howard M. Koo J.S. Sheehan J.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L1118-L1128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, an alternative interpretation of the data could be that the mucins were depolymerized during extraction because of their exposure to intracellular reductants. This coupled with the high pH level of the lysis buffer could have led to the reduction of the disulfide-linked chains. This was clearly shown to be the case by performing extractions under conditions that were either unfavorable to (low pH) or that protected against (addition of NEM) reduction of disulfide bonds (Fig. 3, B and C). Extraction at pH 4, relative to pH 8, yielded mucins with a higher extent of oligomerization. However, there was still a higher proportion of smaller species than observed in the culture medium. The addition of increasing concentrations of NEM into the extraction buffer yielded progressively larger oligomers, and the addition of 10 mm NEM resulted in only extensively oligomerized mucins. We conclude from these findings that the MUC5AC mucins are oligomerized inside the cells prior to secretion and that these oligomers are sensitive to reduction on cell lysis. Therefore, all subsequent experiments were performed in the presence of 20 mm NEM. To be able to set the experimental time scale for later studies, we first assessed the time taken for the synthesis and secretion of “mature” MUC5AC mucins. We therefore performed a 30-min pulse-label experiment and subsequently isolated the mature mucins at different times after labeling using isopycnic density centrifugation, which we have previously shown separates the mature glycosylated mucins from partially glycosylated precursors and the mucin polypeptide (19Aksoy N. Thornton D.J. Corfield A. Paraskeva C. Sheehan J.K. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A cohort of labeled mature mucins was seen in the cells after 2-6 h, which is slowly depleted over days (Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast, 35S-radiolabeled mature mucins were released into the medium within 2-6 h, but thereafter their secretion was reduced dramatically so that only a small amount was released between 24 and 96 h. These data indicate that a substantial proportion of the mature molecules were kept within the cells. The fate of this material was not determined. It may be a pool awaiting the appropriate signal for secretion or may be destined for degradation. To investigate the steps in the biosynthetic pathway, it was first necessary to separate and catalogue the different intracellular forms of the mucin. To achieve this we subjected the solubilized cells to 4 m GdmCl/CsCl isopycnic density gradient centrifugation. The distribution of glycoconjugates in the gradient, as monitored with the periodic acid-Schiff reagent, shows that the majority banded between 1.32 and 1.48 g/ml (Fig. 5A). This is consistent with the density range of mature glycosylated mucins (18Sheehan J.K. Brazeau C. Kutay S. Pigeon H. Kirkham S. Howard M. Thornton D.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Furthermore, over 95% of this material had similar elution behavior on anion exchange chromatography (after reduction and carboxymethylation) to the mature MUC5AC mucin secreted into the medium (data not shown). Aliquots from fractions taken across the density gradient were subjected to agarose electrophoresis, and subsequent Western blots were probed with MAN-5ACI (which identifies all MUC5AC molecular forms) and two monoclonal antibodies, Mab 2011 (an anti-TR probe that identifies unglycosylated MUC5AC) and Mab CD175 (an anti-Tn probe that identifies GalNAc-substituted MUC5AC and other glycoproteins) (Fig. 5, B-D). MAN-5ACI highlights three populations of MUC5AC: a low density population, which has two major bands (Fig. 5B, open and filled arrowheads), an intermediate density population (Fig. 5B, filled square), and a high density population (Fig. 5B, filled star). Mab 2011 stains the population with the lowest buoyant density and highest electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 5C). By contrast, the anti-Tn probe predominantly stains a population of glycoproteins with intermediate buoyant density and electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 5D). The high density population stains only with MAN-5ACI; thus, its density and immunoreactivity indicate that it represents the mature glycosylated mucins. Moreover, the staining intensity with the MAN-5ACI probe shows that this is the predominant form of the mucin within the cells. The intermediate density population that stains with MAN-5ACI and the Tn antibody but not the TR probe therefore most likely contains the partially glycosylated (GalNAc) polypeptide. However, we cannot be certain that the Tn reactivity is solely because of the MUC5AC glycoprotein. The two major bands (reactive with the TR probe) observed at low buoyant density (Fig. 5C) are sensitive to reduction and became a single, faster migrating band after treatment with DTT (Fig. 5C, inset), suggesting that they represent different oligomerized forms of the unglycosylated mucin polypeptide. In a previous study of the biosynthesis of MUC2 mucins (19Aksoy N. Thornton D.J. Corfield A. Paraskeva C. Sheehan J.K. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we identify similar bands, and rate-zonal centrifugation studies indicate that the two molecular forms have sedimentation rates consistent with monomeric and dimeric species; that is, the faster electrophoretically migrating species (corresponding to the labeled band, Fig. 5B, open arrowhead) represents the monomer. Identical studies (data not shown) were performed herein on material from fractions 1-3, and the same data were obtained, leading us to draw the same conclusion. To examine the progress of the mucin polypeptide through its biosynthetic pathway, the cells were pulse-labeled for 1 h with [35S]methionine and, after solubilization of the cells at various times after labeling, intermediates were immunoprecipitated with MAN-5ACI antiserum (this antiserum immunoprecipitates multiple forms of the mucin but is least effective at precipitating the mature oligomerized glycoprotein, 2U. S. Kirkham, J. K. Sheehan, and D. J. Thorton, unpublished observations. so that these data are non-quantitative). After agarose gel electrophoresis of the immunoprecipitates, the molecules were transferred to nitrocellulose, and radioactivity was measured by phosphorimaging (Fig 6A). The data indicated that the 35S radiolabel was transferred from the polypeptide monomer (Fig. 6A, open arrowhead) to a polypeptide dimer (Fig. 6A, filled arrowhead) and into a number of other more slowly migrating species. The assignment of the two putative polypeptide bands was confirmed by their reactivity with the anti-TR probe (Fig 6B). We anticipated on the basis of the data shown in Fig. 5 that at least one of the other bands would be a GalNAc-substituted form of the polypeptide. This was confirmed by probing the membrane with the anti-Tn antibody, which showed that the 35S-labeled band (Fig. 6A, filled square) was coincident with the Tn reactivity (Fig. 6C). Material corresponding to the putative GalNAc-substituted polypeptide was subsequently isolated by CsCl density gradient centrifugation and analyzed before and after reduction by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 6D). Its change of electrophoretic mobility on reduction indicated that it was not monomeric. Returning to the assignment of bands on the gel presented in Fig. 6A, the remaining bands (filled star and filled circle) did not stain with the anti-Tn or -TR probes (Fig. 6, B and C) and therefore must be more highly glycosylated forms of the mucin. We would, therefore, propose that the uppermost bands (Fig. 6A, filled star) represent mature, highly oligomerized mucin, but the identity of the final band (Fig. 6A, filled circle) cannot be assigned in this experiment. Finally, analysis of the mucins from the culture medium over the course of the experiment showed that only highly oligomerized MUC5AC glycoproteins were secreted from the cells, and these were first apparent 2-4 h after labeling (data not shown), which is consistent with the data shown in Fig 3B. From the results shown in Fig. 5 there is a clear prediction regarding the buoyant density of each of the putative molecular species assigned in Fig. 6. Therefore, cells were pulse-labeled for 2 h to make sure that radioactivity was found in all the intracellular forms of the mucin. Two hours after labeling, the cells were solubilized, and the various MUC5AC forms were immunoprecipitated with the MAN-5ACI antiserum. The immunoprecipitate was resolubilized in 4 m GdmCl and subjected to density gradient centrifugation in 4 m GdmCl/CsCl, and fractions from across the gradient were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 7A). The data show that the interpretation of the bands representing mature oligomerized MUC5AC glycoproteins (Fig. 6A, filled star) are consistent with their high buoyant density (Fig. 7A, lanes 10-13). The putative GalNAc-substituted intermediate (Fig. 6A, filled square) is as predicted f"

CBF activities are reduced in 30% of acute myeloid leukemia cases, due either to AML1 point mutations, AML1 gene deletion, or, most often, chromosomal abnormalities involving genes encoding AML1 or CBFβ (1Friedman A.D.

Mice lacking either AML1 or CBFβ do not develop definitive hematopoiesis, indicating a critical role for these factors in pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells (6Okuda T. van Deursen J. Hiebert S.W.

Cowland J.B. Blood. 2003; 101: 4322-4332Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In addition, CBF/AML1 regulates the G1 to S cell cycle transition. CBFβ-SMMHC is a CBF oncoprotein capable of sequestering CBFα subunits in multimers, which form via its myosin (SMMHC) domain (16Liu P. Tarle S.A. Hajre A. Claxton D.F. Marlton P. Freedman M.

Expression of CBFβ-SMMHC from the zinc-responsive metallothionein (MT) promoter in the Ba/F3 pro-B lymphoid or 32Dcl3 myeloid cell lines reduces CBF/AML1 DNA binding, leading to the accumulation of hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, and slows cell proliferation during G1 (18Cao W.

N-terminal CBFβ residues required for interaction with CBFα subunits are required for inhibition of proliferation by CBFβ-SMMHC (19Cao W. Adya N. Britos-Bray M. Liu P.P. Friedman A.D. J. Biol.

An AML1 DNA binding domain:KRAB transrepression domain fusion protein expressed inducibly in Ba/F3 or 32Dcl3 cells also blocks G1 progression (20Lou J. Cao W. Bernardin F. Ayyanathan K.

Similarly, AML1-ETO, a CBF oncoprotein, which binds DNA and represses transcription, slows G1 progression in myeloid cell lines, dependent upon its ability to bind DNA (17Kummalue T. Lou J.

Ther. 2002; 1: 494-498Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Also, AML1 accelerates G1 progression when expressed stably in 32Dcl3 cells or when expressed as an AML1-ER fusion protein in Ba/F3 cells (20Lou J. Cao W. Bernardin F. Ayyanathan K.

When co-expressed with CBFβ-SMMHC, AML1-ER stimulated proliferation more potently, dependent upon integrity of its transactivation domain (25Bernardin F. Friedman A.D. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3247-3252Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Finally, genetic changes that accelerate G1, loss of p16INK4a and p19ARF or expression of papillomavirus E7 protein, cooperate with CBF oncoproteins to induce acute leukemia in mice (26Yang Y. Wang W. Cleaves R. Zahurak M. Cheng L. Civin C.I. Friedman A.D. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2232-2235PubMed Google Scholar, 27Bernardin F. Yang Y. Cleaves R. Zahurak M. Cheng L. Civin C.I. Friedman A.D. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3904-3908PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the conclusion that AML1 stimulates the G1 to S transition, we sought to determine whether AML1 levels are themselves regulated during the cell cycle. 32Dcl3 and Ba/F3 cell cycle fractions were prepared using elutriation, a method that avoids the cytotoxicity of chemical synchronizing agents. Endogenous or exogenous AML1 levels increased during G1 to S cell cycle progression, as did AML1 DNA binding activity. An AML1 variant lacking two ERK phosphorylation sites retained cell cycle variation, and IL-3 induced phosphorylation of endogenous AML1 independent of cell cycle phase. In addition, inhibition of AML1 repressed cyclin D3 mRNA expression, and AML1 bound and activated the cyclin D3 gene. Cell Culture and Generation of Stable Clones—32Dcl3 cells (28Valtieri M. Tweardy D.J. Caracciolo D. Johnson K. Mavilio F. Altman S. Snatoli D. Rovera G. J.

Ba/F3 cells (29Palacios R. Steinmetz M. Cell. 1985; 41: 727-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar) were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% HI-FBS, and 1 ng/ml IL-3. CRE retroviral packaging cells (30Danos O. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

All cultures contained penicillin-streptomycin. Zinc chloride, estradiol, or mimosine (Sigma) were added when indicated. 32Dcl3 differentiation was induced by washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline followed by culture in IMDM with 10% HI-FBS, and 20 ng/ml G-CSF (Amgen). 32Dcl3 or Ba/F3 cells were stably transfected by electroporation, and 32Dcl3 cells were transduced using CRE-AML1(86-217)ER cells as described and selected using 1.2 mg/ml G418 (total) or 2 μg/ml puromycin (18Cao W.

Blood. 1999; 94: 560-571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Single cell clones were isolated by limiting dilution. 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% HI-FBS and were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen), as described (17Kummalue T. Lou J. Friedman A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8278-8291Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Plasmids—The human AML1B cDNA, the longest splice variant of AML1 (32Meyers S. Lenny N. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1974-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), was ligated into the polylinker of pMTCB6 (18Cao W. Britos-Bray M. Claxton D.F. Kelley C.A. Speck N.A. Liu P.P. Friedman A.D. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) to generate pMT-AML1. pMT-Myc-AML1 was generated by inserting an oligonucleotide encoding Kozak's rules for translation initiation followed by a methionine and a Myc tag upstream of the AML1 cDNA. The oligonucleotide sense strand, with a KpnI-compatible 3′-end was 5′-CATCGATGCCGCCACCATGGAGCAGAAGCTCATCTCCGAGGAAGATCTCAGTAC. The sequence encoding the initiating Met and 11-residue Myc tag is underlined. Ligation into the polylinker upstream of the AML1 cDNA also inserted five additional residues, STEFA, between the tag and the AML1 cDNA. pMT-Myc-AML1-(1-217) was generated by 3′-deletion to a SmaI site, with insertion of a stop codon. A HindIII/BssHII segment of the AML1(S276A/S293A) cDNA, kindly provided by H. Hirai, was used to replace a similar segment in pMT-Myc-AML1 to generate pMT-Myc-AML1(S276A/S293A). pBabePuro-AML1-ER and pBabePuro-AML1 (86-217)-ER have been described (25Bernardin F. Friedman A.D. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3247-3252Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The numbering of these mutants reflects the AML1B sequence (32Meyers S. Lenny N. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1974-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). pD3(-447)-Luc was prepared by ligating an XhoI/BamHI fragment from pD3GH (33Wang Z. Sicinski P. Weinberg R.A. Zhang Y. Ravid K. Genomics. 1996; 35: 156-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) into p19LUC. pD3(-447)mAML1-LUC was prepared by replacing the AML1 site at -383, 5′-GACCACA-3′, with 5′-GCTAGCA-3′, by ligating two set of annealed oligonucleotides between the XhoI site at -447 and the SfoI site at -333. The ligation product was verified by DNA sequencing. Elutriation and Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS) Analysis—100-200 × 106 cells were washed and resuspended in 10 ml of elutriation medium (150 mm NaCl, 167 mm glucose, 0.3 mm EDTA, 1% bovine serum albumin). The cells were then injected into a JE-6B rotor and spun at 2000 rpm at 25 °C. The flow rate of elutriation medium was increased gradually and cell cycle fractions collected. Fractionation was monitored in each experiment by incubation of 5 × 105 cells with 11 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 dye in 0.7% Nonidet P-40, 4.7% formaldehyde followed by FACS analysis. Western Blotting, Gel Shift Assay, and Northern Blotting—Total cellular protein extracts were prepared using Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting as described (18Cao W. Britos-Bray M. Claxton D.F. Kelley C.A. Speck N.A. Liu P.P. Friedman A.D. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Extract corresponding to 1.5 × 106 cells were loaded in each lane. AML1 antiserum was kindly provided by H. Drabkin, CBFβ antiserum was kindly provided by N. Speck, and ERα and D3 antisera (MC-ER and C-16, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), c-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10, Roche Applied Science), and cyclin E antiserum (Upstate Biotechnology) were obtained commercially. Equivalent amounts of extract were electrophoresed and subjected to Coomassie Blue dye staining to assess total protein content of each sample. Nuclear extracts were prepared and subjected to gel shift and supershift assay using a radiolabeled CBF binding site from the myeloperoxidase (MPO) promoter and an N-terminal AML1 antiserum, kindly provided by S. Hiebert, as described (13Nuchprayoon I. Meyers S. Scott L.M. Suzow J. Hiebert S. Friedman A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5558-5568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The wild-type and mutant murine MPO oligonucleotides were (12Suzow J. Friedman A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2141-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) WTMPO: 5′-CTAGACTGACCATTAACCACAACCAGTTG-3′, and MutMPO: 5′-CTAGACTGACCAGGTAGCACAACCAGTTG-3′. In addition the following oligonucleotides derived from the murine cyclin D genes, including 5′-CTAG overhangs, were annealed to antisense strands and used as gel shift competitors (potential AML1 binding sites are again underlined, and accession numbers with base pairs are listed): D1(-753): 5-CTAGGGCCCTTTGCAACCACCCCAGTGCGCC-3′ (AF212040, 587-613); D2(-541): 5′-CTAGCCATGGGGTTTGTGGTTCCCCTATCCG-3′ (AF015788, 405-431); D3(-383): 5′CTAGACAAAGTTATGACCACATTCCCTAGAG-3′ (U43844, 1291-1317). Total cellular RNAs were prepared using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) or RNAeasy (Qiagen) per the manufacturer's instructions. The RNAs, 10 μg per lane, were subjected to Northern blotting as described (31Wang X. Scott E. Sawyers C.L. Friedman A.D. Blood. 1999; 94: 560-571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Murine cyclin D1, D2, and D3 cDNAs were kindly provided by C. Sherr and the murine AML1 cDNA by Y. Ito (2Bae S.-C. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Ogawa E. Maruyama M. Inuzuka M. Kagoshima H. Shigesada K. Satake M. Ito Y. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 809-814PubMed Google Scholar). Densitometric analysis was carried out with the NIH Image 1.62 program. Endogenous CBF DNA Binding and AML1 Increase During G1 to S Progression—We employed counterflow elutriation to fractionate 32Dcl3 and Ba/F3 cells into cell cycle fractions based on density. In this procedure, the flow of the elutriation media opposes the centrifugal force on the cells, establishing an equilibrium. As the flow rate is increased, denser cells come into position to exit the elutriation chamber. Use of elutriation allowed us to study cells in active, physiologic cell cycle, which did not prove possible by synchronizing cells followed by release of the chemical block as 32Dcl3 cells treated in this manner underwent apoptosis rather than continued cell cycle progression (not shown). A typical cell cycle fractionation profile and the proportion of cells in each fraction are shown (Fig. 1). Fr 18-20 contains G1 phase cells, Fr 21-24 contains late G1/early S cells, Fr 25-30 contains mainly S phase cells, and Fr 31-34 mainly G2/M phase cells. Cell cycle fractionation was monitored in each experiment. In some experiments the cells began to elute at 20 ml/min rather than 18 ml/min, as indicated in each figure. AML1 is expressed entirely in the cell nucleus (34Lu J. Maruyama M. Satake M. Bae S.-C. Ogawa S. Kagoshima H Shigesada K. Ito Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1651-1661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We first employed a gel shift assay to assess CBF DNA binding activity during the cell cycle, utilizing an equivalent amount of nuclear protein per sample (Fig. 2, A and B, left panels). Based on densitometric analysis, CBF DNA binding activity increased almost 4-fold as 32Dcl3 or Ba/F3 cells progressed from G1 to S. Of note, micrograms of nuclear protein per cell were not significantly different between the G1 and S phase samples. This pattern of CBF gel shift activity was reproduced in four separate experiments. To confirm that the indicated bands contain members of the CBF family, the peak fractions for each cell line were subjected to competition with increasing amounts of unlabelled wild-type CBF oligonucleotide or with an oligonucleotide carrying clustered point mutations in the CBF binding site (Fig. 2C). Specific competition was observed with the CBF complexes. To resolve AML1-specific DNA from among the CBF binding activity, equal amounts of the 32Dcl3 nuclear extracts were subjected to a supershift assay with normal rabbit serum, AML1 antiserum, or AML1 antiserum in the presence of its specific peptide (Fig. 2A, right panel). A specific supershift band was obtained from each fraction (arrow) which increased 2.3-fold as cells progressed from G1 to S. Gel shift assay indicated that Ba/F3 cells have substantially less overall CBF DNA binding activity than 32Dcl3 cells (Fig. 2B), perhaps accounting for our inability to detect a supershifted AML1 species with the Ba/F3 extracts, although the antibody did reduce the intensity of the CBF bands (Fig. 2B, right panel). We next prepared total cellular proteins from 32Dcl3 and Ba/F3 cell cycle fractions and analyzed these for AML1 expression by Western blotting (Fig. 3, A and B). A slowly migrating nonspecific band was evident in the 32Dcl3 samples, and Coomassie Blue dye-stained protein fractions serve as a further control for protein loading. Densitometric analysis indicated that total cellular proteins increased 2-fold during the cell cycle, consistent with doubling of cell size. AML1 levels increased 2.7- or 2.6-fold from G1 (Fr 18-19) to S (Fr 28-29) or G2/M (Fr 32-33) in the 32Dcl3 fractions, relative to total cellular proteins, and increased ∼1.8- or 1.9-fold in the same Ba/F3 fractions. Additional repetitions of this analysis with 32Dcl3 cells demonstrated a 3.0- or 3.5-fold increase (for an average of 3.0-fold) in AML1 expression during the cell cycle (see Fig. 8B). This degree of cell cycle variation is consistent with the EMSA studies for 32Dcl3 cells, but the increase in CBF DNA binding was greater than that for AML1 in Ba/F3 cells, perhaps reflecting a greater contribution of AML2 and AML3 to CBF cell cycle variation in these cells.Fig. 8Cytokine-dependent phosphorylation does not regulate AML1 expression during the cell cycle. A, 32Dcl3 cells were serum- and IL-3-starved for 3 h at room temperature in elutriation medium, and then returned to IMDM with fetal bovine serum and IL-3 at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for the indicated number of minutes. Total cellular proteins were then subjected to Western blotting for AML1. An extract from cells collected before starvation (pre) was also analyzed. Upper and lower bands in the AML1 doublet are indicated by arrows. B, the indicated 32Dcl3 cell cycle fractions were returned to IMDM/FBS/IL-3 for 4 h (left panels) or 6 h(right panels). Total cellular protein samples prepared prior to addition of growth medium (0 h) and after addition for the indicated times were subjected to Western blotting for AML1 and to Coomassie Blue staining. Expression of AML1 in each sample, corrected for loading, is shown below, with the 0 h samples being analyzed separately from the 4 or 6 h samples (+IL3). As there was not sufficient sample available for two of the Coomassie lanes, AML1 was normalized to the paired 0 or 6 h Coomassie signal, in view of the equality of the slowly migrating nonspecific band in the same paired fractions. C, total cellular proteins from the indicated 32D-Myc-AML1(S276A/S293A) cell cycle fractions were subjected to Western blotting using Myc tag antibody. Coomassie Blue dye staining of these fractions is also shown. Myc-AML1(S276A/S293A) expression in each sample, corrected for loading, is indicated below.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the variation in AML1 protein levels during the cell cycle is paralleled by variation in AML1 RNA levels, total cellular RNAs were prepared from 32Dcl3 and Ba/F3 cell cycle fractions and 10 μg of each sample was subjected to Northern blotting (Fig. 4). AML1 mRNA increased only 1.3-fold in both Ba/F3 cells and 32Dcl3 cells from early G1 to late S phase, relative to β-actin mRNA. Of note, RNA per cell increased 2-fold, on average, during the cell cycle. Thus, relative to total RNA, AML1 RNA increased 2.6-fold in each line. Comparison to β-actin may be more relevant, as total RNA largely represents ribosomal RNA. AML1 Protein Levels Are Reduced in Cells Arrested in G1—Decreased expression of AML1 in early G1 suggests that cells arrested in G1 would have reduced levels of AML1 compared with proliferating cells. 32Dcl3 or Ba/F3 cells were exposed to mimosine, an agent, which induces the p27 cyclin-dependent kinase in hematopoietic cells (35Wang Q. Cleaves R. Kummalue T. Nerlov C. Friedman A.D. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 2548-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Mimosine was employed at 0.2 or 0.4 mm for 6 h, as exposure for longer times led to substantial apoptosis. At 0.4 mm, the G1/S ratio increased from 1.4 to 2.2 in Ba/F3 cells and from 1.1 to 1.6 in 32Dcl3 cells, with minimal apoptosis (Fig. 5, A and B). Total cellular proteins from these cultures were analyzed for endogenous AML1 expression by Western blotting (Fig. 5B). Exposure to 0.4 mm mimosine for 6 h reduced endogenous AML1 levels 1.7-fold in Ba/F3 cells and 2.5-fold in 32Dcl3 cells, relative to total protein content. For comparison, 32Dcl3 cells were transferred from IL-3 to G-CSF, which induces differentiation concomitant with a potent G1 arrest (31Wang X. Scott E. Sawyers C.L. Friedman A.D. Blood. 1999; 94: 560-571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The G1/S ratio increased from 1.1 to 5.0 after 1 day (D1) and to 8.9 after 2 days (D2), without evident apoptosis (Fig. 5, A and B). AML1 levels were reduced 3-fold after 1 day and more than 10-fold after 2 days in G-CSF. To determine whether reduced AML1 levels associated with G1 arrest are due to reduced AML1 RNA levels, total cellular RNAs were prepared from 32Dcl3 cells cultured in IL-3 or in G-CSF for 1 or 2 days and from 32Dcl3 or Ba/F3 cells cultured in 0.4 mm mimosine for 6 h. These RNAs were subjected to Northern blotting for AML1 and β-actin (Fig. 5C). Relative to β-actin, AML1 RNA increased in 32Dcl3 cells in response to exposure to mimosine for 6 h or to G-CSF for 2 days and only decreased 10% in Ba/F3 cells in response to mimosine. Exogenous AML1 Levels Also Increase During G1 to S Progression—Based on our finding that endogenous AML1 levels are regulated during the cell cycle, we predicted that exogenous AML1 protein levels might be controlled similarly. To clearly distinguish exogenous AML1, we positioned a 17-residue tag, MEQKLISEEDLASTEFA (the Myc epitope is underlined), at the N terminus of the 480-residue AML1 cDNA just downstream of a segment containing Kozak's rules for optimum translational initiation. The myc-AML1 cDNA, lacking endogenous AML1 5′- or 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs), was then positioned downstream of the zinc-responsive metallothionein promoter in pMTCB6 to generate pMT-myc-AML1. This plasmid also contains the G418-resistance gene linked to the SV40 promoter. pMT-myc-AML1 was linearized and electroporated into 32Dcl3 cells. Two G418-resistant subclones expressing myc-AML1 in the presence of zinc chloride were identified by Western blotting. When a total cellular extract from zinc-treated 32D-Myc-AML1 cells was analyzed by Western blotting using an AML1 antibody, two doublets were detected, with the lower doublet co-migrating with AML1 detected from parental 32Dcl3 cells (Fig. 6A, left panel). Presence of a doublet may reflect AML1 phosphorylation (36Tanaka T. Kurokawa M. Ueki K. Tanaka K. Imai Y. Mitani K. Okazaki K. Sagata N. Yazaki Y. Shibata Y. Kadowaki T. Hirai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3967-3979Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The increased size of exogenous myc-AML1 is due to the 17-residue Myc tag and to the fact that exogenous human AML1 contains 27 residues at it N terminus lacking in the endogenous murine protein. Of note, the remainder of human and murine AML1 are 97% identical (32Meyers S. Lenny N. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1974-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). We observed that myc-AML1 was expressed at ∼3-fold higher level than endogenous AML1. Use of the zinc-responsive MT promoter not only avoids generation of cell lines perturbed during isolation by high basal activity of AML1 but also allows control of myc-AML1 expression via use of suboptimal zinc concentrations (Fig. 6A, right panel). Even in the absence of zinc, basal expression of myc-AML1, especially the lower band of the doublet, is evident. 75 μm zinc chloride led to expression 2-3-fold below that detected in cells exposed to 100 μm zinc, presumably similar to endogenous AML1 levels. 32D-Myc-AML1 cells were therefore exposed to 75 μm zinc and subjected to elutriation. Cell cycle fractions were analyzed by Western blotting for myc-AML1, cyclin D3, and cyclin E (Fig. 6B). Compared with early G1 cells (Fr 18-20), Myc-AML1 levels increased 2.3-fold by mid-S phase (Fr 27-28) and 3.0-fold by late-S/G2/M phase (Fr 29-30). Cyclin D3 and E levels increased similarly. Analysis of a second 32Dcl3 subclone demonstrated a 3.4-fold increase in exogenous Myc-AML1 during cell cycle progression (not shown).

https://openalex.org/W1977185001,"The tRNA 3′-terminal CCA sequence is essential for aminoacylation of the tRNAs and for translation on the ribosome. The tRNAs are transcribed as larger precursor molecules containing 5′ and 3′ extra sequences. In the tRNAs that do not have the encoded CCA, the 3′ extra sequence after the discriminator nucleotide is usually cleaved off by the tRNA 3′ processing endoribonuclease (3′ tRNase, or RNase Z), and the 3′-terminal CCA residues are added thereto. Here we analyzed Thermotoga maritima 3′ tRNase for enzymatic properties using various pre-tRNAs from T. maritima, in which all 46 tRNA genes encode CCA with only one exception. We found that the enzyme has the unprecedented activity that cleaves CCA-containing pre-tRNAs precisely after the CCA sequence, not after the discriminator. The assays for pre-tRNA variants suggest that the CA residues at nucleotides 75 and 76 are required for the enzyme to cleave pre-tRNAs after A at nucleotide 76 and that the cleavage occurs after nucleotide 75 if the sequence is not CA. Intriguingly, the pre-tRNAMet that is the only T. maritima pre-tRNA without the encoded CCA was cleaved after the discriminator. The kinetics data imply the existence of a CCA binding domain in T. maritima 3′ tRNase. We also identified two amino acid residues critical for the cleavage site selection and several residues essential for the catalysis. Analysis of cleavage sites by 3′ tRNases from another eubacteria Escherichia coli and two archaea Thermoplasma acidophilum and Pyrobaculum aerophilum corroborates the importance of the two amino acid residues for the cleavage site selection.

Every single tRNA molecule ends with the sequence CCA (1Sprinzl M. Horn C. Brown M. Ioudovitch A. Steinberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). This 3′-terminal sequence is essential for aminoacylation of the tRNAs (2Tamura K. Nameki N. Hasegawa T. Shimizu M. Himeno H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22173-22177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and for translation on the ribosome (3Green R. Noller H.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 679-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) in all organisms. The tRNAs are transcribed as larger precursor molecules, which subsequently undergo various processing steps such as removal of 5′ and 3′ extra sequences to generate mature tRNAs (4Deutscher M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1990; 39: 209-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Because generally eukaryotic tRNA genes do not encode the CCA sequence, the eukaryotic tRNAs are supplemented with the CCA residues by tRNA nucleotidyltransferase (4Deutscher M.P. Nucleic Acids Res.

In contrast, the CCA sequences of all Escherichia coli tRNAs are encoded in its genome, and the six exoribonucleases RNase BN, RNase II, polynucleotide phosphorylase, RNase PH, RNase D, and RNase T are involved in the removal of 3′ trailers to generate the CCA termini (17Li Z.

RNase II and polynucleotide phosphorylase, however, prefer unstructured RNAs such as mRNAs as substrates, so that their roles in tRNA maturation would probably be limited. In the other eubacteria and archaea, percentages of the CCA-coding tRNA genes vary with species from 0 to 100% (Table I). From the above precedents, it was assumed that prokaryotes containing 0 and 100% CCA-coding tRNA genes would primarily utilize the eukaryote-type and E. coli-type systems, respectively, to generate the CCA termini, and that the other prokaryotes would make use of both systems depending on the presence or absence of the encoded CCA sequence.Table IGenes for tRNAs, 3′ tRNase, and exoribonucleasesSpeciesCCA/totalaThe number of CCA-containing tRNA genes versus the number of the total tRNA genes.EndoBNIIPNPPHDTBorrelia burgdorferi0/32+−+−−−−Chlamydophila pneumoniae0/38+−++−−−Chlamydophila trachomatis1/45+−++−−−Treponema pallidum10/31+−++−−−Buchnera sp.15/45+−+−++−Mycobacterium leprae15/45+−+−++−Staphylococcus aureus N31537/61+++−−−−Bacillus subtilis63/86+++++−−Aquifex aeolicus32/43+−+++−−Bacillus halodurans63/78+++−+−+Deinococcus radiodurans48/49+−+++−−Haemophilus influenzae55/56−++++++Thermotoga maritima45/46+−++−−−Campylobacter jejuni42/42−+++−−−Caulobacter crescentus51/51+−+++++Escherichia coli86/86+++++++Helicobacter pylori 2669536/36−+++−−−Mycoplasma genitalium35/35−−−+−−−Mycoplasma penetrans36/36−−−−−−−Patteurella multocida51/51+++++++Rickettsia prowazekii32/32−++−++−Pseudomonas aeruginosa62/62+++−+++Ureaplasma urealyticum29/29−−−+−−−Vibrio cholerae98/98+++++++Xylella fastidiosa49/49−++++++Archaeoglobus fulgidus0/46+−−+−−−Halobacterium sp.0/45+−−−+−−Thermoplasma volcanium0/45+−−−+−−Sulfolobus solfataricus1/45+−−−+−−Sulfolobus tokodaii1/45+−−−+−−Thermoplasma acidophilum1/45+−−−+−−Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum1/39+−−−+−−Pyrobaculum aerophilum19/46+−−−+−−Methanococcus jannaschii25/36+−−−−−−Pyrococcus abyssi44/46+−−−+−−Pyrococcus furiosus46/46+−−−+−−Pyrococcus horikoshii46/46+−−−+−−Aeropyrum pernix46/46+−−−+−−a The number of CCA-containing tRNA genes versus the number of the total tRNA genes.

If T. maritima 3′ tRNase is responsible for removal of 3′ extra sequences from the pre-tRNAs containing the CCA residues, the reason why the genome preserves CCA in the tRNA genes is a mystery, because 3′ tRNases so far characterized are believed to cleave pre-tRNAs immediately after the discriminator (6Castano J.G.

It should be noted, however, that in some cases additional cleavages were observed in vitro 1-nt upstream, or 1- or 2-nt downstream. To solve this enigma, we analyzed T. maritima 3′ tRNase for enzymatic properties using various pre-tRNAs. Here we show that T. maritima 3′ tRNase has the unprecedented activity that cleaves CCA-containing pre-tRNAs precisely after the CCA sequence, not after the discriminator. We also identify essential residues in substrate and enzyme for the cleavage site selection and the catalysis. The mechanism for 3′ tRNase to select the cleavage site must have co-evolved with the gain or loss of the CCA sequence in tRNA genes. Construction of Expression Plasmids for 3′ tRNases from T. maritima, Thermoplasma acidophilum, and Pyrobaculum aerophilum—Twelve DNA fragments were chemically synthesized to produce the double-stranded DNA encoding T. maritima 3′ tRNase, in which the codons are optimized for translation in E. coli. The full-length DNA for 3′ tRNase (data not shown) was created by PCR with the primer pair 5′Tm/3′Tm (Table II) using Pyrobest DNA polymerase (Takara Shuzo) and cloned between the SphI and SalI sites of the expression vector pQE-80L (Qiagen). The resulting plasmid pQE/Tm(WT) was designed to produce 3′ tRNase containing N-terminal histidines.Table IIPCR primers used for cloning and site-directed mutagenesisNameSequence (5′ to 3′)5′TmACATGCATGCATGAACATCATTGGCTTTAG3′TmCCGCTCGAGTTACATTTC5′EcCGGGATCCATGGAATTAATTTTTTTAGG3′EcCCGCTCGAGTTAAACGTTAAACACGGTG5′TaCGCGGATCCATGATGGCTTCGAATATAAGG3′TaCCGCTCGAGTTAATCAACGTCTCTTCTTACCTT5′PaCGCGGATCCATGCCAATAGTAAAACTAGTT3′PaCCGCTCGCGTTAAAGCTTGACGAGAAGAGTTTCD25A(sense)ATTCTGTTTGCTGCGGGCGAAD25A(antisense)TTCGCCCGCAGCAAACAGAATG27A(sense)TTTGATGCGGCCGAAGGCGTGG27A(antisense)CACGCCTTCGGCCGCATCAAAV30T(sense)GGCGAAGGCACGAGCACCACCV30T(antisense)GGTGGTGCTCGTGCCTTCGCCS31Q(sense)GAAGGCGTGCAAACCACCCTGS31Q(antisense)CAGGGTGGTTTGCACGCCTTCT33Q(sense)GTGAGCACCCAACTGGGCAGCT33Q(antisense)GCTGCCCAGTTGGGTGCTCACV38A(sense)GGCAGCAAAGCGTATGCGTTTV38A(antisense)AAACGCATACGCTTTGCTGCCH48A(sense)TTTCTGACCGCTGGCCATGTGH48A(antisense)CACATGGCCAGCGGTCAGAAAG49L(sense)CTGACCCATCTCCATGTGGATG49L(antisense)ATCCACATGGAGATGGGTCAGH50A(sense)ACCCATGGCGCTGTGGATCATH50A(antisense)ATGATCCACAGCGCCATGGGTV51G(sense)CATGGCCATGGGGATCATATTV51G(antisense)AATATGATCCCCATGGCCATGD52A(sense)GGCCATGTGGCTCATATTGCGD52A(antisense)CGCAATATGAGCCACATGGCCH53A(sense)CATGTGGATGCTATTGCGGGCH53A(antisense)GCCCGCAATAGCATCCACATGA55L(sense)GATCATATTCTGGGCCTGTGGA55L(antisense)CCACAGGCCCAGAATATGATCG49L/V51G(sense)CTGACCCATCTCCATGGGGATCATAG49L/V51G(antisense)TATGATCCCCATGGAGATGGGTCAG43LTR44(sense)AAATATCTGACCCGCGTGTTTCTGACCCATGGC43LTR44(antisense)GCCATGGGTCAGAAACACGCGGGTCAGATATTT Open table in a new tab The full-length 3′ tRNase coding regions of E. coli (915 bp), T. acidophilum (921 bp), and P. aerophilum (861 bp) were PCR-amplified from their genomes.

Each amplified gene was cloned between the BamHI and SalI sites of pQE-80L (Qiagen). We confirmed that the insert regions of pQE/Ec, pQE/Ta, and pQE/Pa are the same as the sequences previously published (GenBank™ accession numbers Q47012, NP_394611, and NP_560582, respectively). Construction of Expression Plasmids for T. maritima 3′ tRNase Variants—Based upon pQE/Tm(WT), we constructed its 15 derivatives to express in E. coli 15 different T. maritima 3′ tRNase variants: pQE/Tm(D25A) for the enzyme containing a D25A substitution, pQE/Tm-(G27A) for the enzyme containing a G27A substitution, pQE/Tm(V30T) for the enzyme containing a V30T substitution, pQE/Tm(S31Q) for the enzyme containing a S31Q substitution, pQE/Tm(T33Q) for the enzyme containing a T33Q substitution, pQE/Tm(V38A) for the enzyme containing a V38A substitution, pQE/Tm(H48A) for the enzyme containing a H48A substitution, pQE/Tm(G49L) for the enzyme containing a G49L substitution, pQE/Tm(H50A) for the enzyme containing a H50A substitution, pQE/Tm(V51G) for the enzyme containing a V51G substitution, pQE/Tm(D52A) for the enzyme containing a D52A substitution, pQE/Tm(H53A) for the enzyme containing a H53A substitution, pQE/Tm(A55L) for the enzyme containing an A55L substitution, pQE/Tm-(G49L/V51G) for the enzyme containing G49L and V51G substitutions, and pQE/Tm(43LTR44) for the enzyme containing LTR insertions between residues 43 and 44.

The primer pairs used for the mutagenesis are listed in Table II. We confirmed that the insert sequences are changed correctly by DNA sequencing. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—E. coli strain DH5α that harbors a pQE expression plasmid derivative (Qiagen) for prokaryotic 3′ tRNase was incubated at 37 °C in a 250-ml LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin until the A600 of the culture reached 0.6. At this point, the histidine-tagged protein was induced by adding 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After further incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation. Cell pellets were resuspended in a 10-ml lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing 1 mm imidazole. The cells were sonicated and centrifuged at 9500 × g for 30 min. The cleared lysate was incubated with 0.2-ml nickel-agarose beads at 4 °C for 1 h. After exhaustive washing, the retained proteins were eluted from the beads with 1 ml of the lysis buffer containing 200 mm imidazole. All of the purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. Pre-tRNA Synthesis—The pre-tRNAs were synthesized in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase (Takara Shuzo) from the synthetic pre-tDNAs containing its promoter. The transcription reactions were carried out in the presence or absence of [α-32P]UTP (Amersham Biosciences) under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer (Takara Shuzo), and the transcribed pre-tRNAs were gel-purified. The unlabeled pre-tRNAs were subsequently labeled with fluorescein according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). Briefly, after the removal of the 5′-phosphates of the transcripts with bacterial alkaline phosphatase (Takara Shuzo), the transcripts were phosphorylated with ATPγS using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Takara Shuzo). Then a single fluorescein moiety was appended onto the 5′-phosphorothioate site. The resulting pre-tRNAs with fluorescein were gel-purified before assays. In Vitro tRNA 3′ Processing Assay—The 3′ processing reactions for 32P-labeled or fluorescein-labeled pre-tRNA were performed with 3′ tRNases of various origins in a mixture (6 μl) containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2 (or 0.2 mm MnCl2 in kinetic assays) at 60 °C. The assays for 3′ tRNases from other species than T. maritima were carried out at 50 °C. After resolution of the reaction products on a 10% polyacrylamide-8 m urea gel, the gel was autoradiographed using an intensifying screen at -80 °C, or analyzed with a Typhoon 9210 (Amersham Biosciences). RNA Sequencing—Unlabeled pre-tRNA (2 pmol) was reacted with T. maritima 3′ tRNase (50 ng) under the standard assay conditions at 60 °C for 10 min, extracted with phenol/chloroform, and precipitated with ethanol. The reaction products dissolved in water were 3′-end-labeled with T4 ligase (Takara Shuzo) and [5′-32P]pCp (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 10 h. The 5′ cleavage product was gel-purified, and its 3′-terminal sequence was determined by the chemical RNA sequencing method (22Peattie D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1760-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). The gel was autoradiographed using an intensifying screen at -80 °C. T. maritima 3′ tRNase Cleaves Pre-tRNAs after CCA—First of all, we chemically synthesized DNA fragments to produce the double-stranded DNA encoding T. maritima 3′ tRNase (GenBank™ accession number NP_228673), in which the codons are optimized for translation in E. coli. The full-length DNA for 3′ tRNase (data not shown) was created by PCR using proof-readable DNA polymerase and cloned into the expression vector pQE-80L. The resulting plasmid pQE/Tm(WT), which is designed to produce 3′ tRNase containing N-terminal histidines, was introduced into E. coli DH5α cells. The enzyme was overexpressed in the cells and purified with nickel-agarose. We examined the recombinant 3′ tRNase for in vitro processing of arginine, methionine, and phenylalanine pre-tRNAs from T. maritima, which contain both 5′ leader and 3′ trailer (Fig. 1A). Uniformly 32P-labeled pre-tRNAs were synthesized in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase from the synthetic tDNA templates. T. maritima 3′ tRNase cleaved pre-tRNAArg(CCA), pre-tRNAMet(CCA), and pre-tRNAPhe(CCA) endonucleolytically (Fig. 1B). To determine the exact cleavage site, we performed the 3′ tRNase cleavage reactions for unlabeled pre-tRNAs and subsequently 3′-end-labeled the products with [5′-32P]pCp. Each 5′ cleavage product was subjected to chemical RNA sequencing. Surprisingly, the T. maritima enzyme cleaved off 3′ trailers precisely after the CCA residues in all three pre-tRNAs (Fig. 1C). Nucleotides at 75 and 76 Determine the Cleavage Site—To elucidate which nucleotides are the determinant for the cleavage after CCA, we tested for cleavage the three pre-tRNAPhe variants pre-tRNAPhe(UCA), pre-tRNAPhe(CUA), and pre-tRNAPhe(CCG), which contain UCA, CUA, and CCG, respectively, instead of CCA. These variants were also processed by T. maritima 3′ tRNase with the exception of pre-tRNAPhe(CCG) (Fig. 2A). Each cleavage site was determined as above. Interestingly, the cleavage site was shifted to 1-nt upstream in pre-tRNAPhe(CUA), whereas the cleavage site of pre-tRNAPhe-(UCA) was not changed. Furthermore, three variants, pre-tRNAArg(CCG), pret-RNAArg(GUG), and pre-tRNAMet(CCG), were examined. Pre-tRNAArg(CCG) and pre-tRNAArg(GUG) were cleaved after nt 75, whereas cleavage of pre-tRNAMet(CCG) was not detected (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that the CA residues at nt 75 and 76 are required for T. maritima 3′ tRNase to cleave pre-tRNAs precisely after A at nt 76 and that otherwise the cleavage occurs after nt 75. Cleavage of Pre-tRNAMet(UAG) after the Discriminator—We also tested for 3′ tRNase cleavage another pre-tRNAMet(UAG) that is the only pre-tRNA without the encoded CCA. Intriguingly, this exceptional pre-tRNA was cleaved after the discriminator (Fig. 3). This makes sense because pre-tRNAs without the CCA termini need to be cleaved after the discriminator at nt 73, to which tRNA nucleotidyltransferase adds the CCA residues, like eukaryotic pre-tRNAs. The reason why only pre-tRNAMet(UAG) among the other pre-tRNAs tested was cleaved after the discriminator may be because this pre-tRNA contains CCA residues at nt 71-73. T. maritima 3′ tRNase may be able to recognize these CCA residues as the cleavage site determinant as discussed below. A CCA Binding Domain in T. maritima 3′ tRNase—The T. maritima enzyme shows its highest activity in 100 mm NaCl at pH 9 at 60 °C in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2 or 0.5 mm MnCl2 (data not shown). The kinetic parameters Km and kcat for pre-tRNAArg(CCA) and pre-tRNAArg(GUG) were determined in the presence of MgCl2 or MnCl2 (Table III). The Km values for pre-tRNAArg(CCA) in the presence of MgCl2 and MnCl2 were 0.3- and 0.4-fold, respectively, smaller than those for pre-tRNAArg(GUG). This suggests that a specific domain for CCA binding exists in the enzyme. On the other hand, the kcat values for pre-tRNAArg(CCA) were 0.4- and 0.6-fold, respectively, smaller than those for pre-tRNAArg(GUG). This may reflect slower release of the CCA-containing product following the chemical cleavage step. As a result, the cleavage efficiency values kcat/Km for pre-tRNAArg(CCA) were ∼1.4-fold as large as those for pre-tRNAArg(GUG) in both conditions.Table IIIKinetic parameters for pre-tRNA cleavage by T. maritima 3′ tRNaseSubstrateIonKmkcatkcat/Kmμmmin−1Pre-tRNAArg(CCA)Mg2+2.80.70.25Pre-tRNAArg(GUG)Mg2+10.61.80.17Pre-tRNAArg(CCA)Mn2+2.81.90.68Pre-tRNAArg(GUG)Mn2+6.53.10.48 Open table in a new tab Two Amino Acid Residues Critical for the Cleavage Site Selection—Next we investigated which amino acid residues are responsible for making T. maritima 3′ tRNase cleave after CCA. We assumed that such residues should be in well conserved regions and be different from residues in the other enzymes that cleave after the discriminator. We selected six residues to be examined; i.e. Val-30, Ser-31, Thr-33, Gly-49, Val-51, and Ala-55 (Fig. 4A). Expression plasmids for single or double amino acid-substituted variants, Tm(V30T), Tm(S31Q), Tm(T33Q), Tm(G49L), Tm(V51G), Tm(G49L/V51G), and Tm(A55L), were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis with PCR based on pQE/Tm(WT). The 3′ tRNase variants were overexpressed in E. coli and purified as histidine-tagged proteins (Fig. 4B). These recombinant enzymes were tested for cleavage of pre-tRNAArg(CCA) and pre-tRNAArg(GUG), which were 5′-end-labeled with fluorescein. The reaction products were analyzed on a sequencing gel with an alkaline ladder to determine the cleavage sites. We found that the wild-type enzyme can cleave pre-tRNAArg(CCA) at the additional minor site between nt 75 and 76 (Fig. 5A). The ratio of the minor to major products increased with the reaction time (data not shown), suggesting that this additional product is generated by the second cut of the original product and is an in vitro artifact. All the above variants cleaved both pre-tRNAs, although the cleavage efficiency varied (Fig. 5, A and B). Among these variants, only Tm(S31Q) clearly changed the cleavage sites. In pre-tRNAArg(CCA), the major cleavage site was shifted to 2-nt downstream, and some portion of the molecules were cleaved after the discriminator. In pre-tRNAArg(GUG), about a half of the molecules were cleaved 1-nt downstream. With respect to Tm(T33Q), the cleavage of pre-tRNAArg(CCA) after nt 75 was more dominant than that after nt 76. In addition, the cleavage was also detected after nt 74. Pre-tRNAArg(GUG) was cleaved slightly after nt 74 as well as after nt 75. These results suggest that Ser-31 is a critical residue for selecting the cleavage site and that Thr-33 is also involved in the site selection. These results also predict that, if 3′ tRNases contain glutamines at the positions corresponding to residues 31 and 33, the enzymes would cleave pre-tRNAs after the discriminator. Indeed, ELAC1-type short 3′ tRNases so far characterized have the corresponding two glutamines with the exception of the Arabidopsis thaliana enzyme, which contains a histidine and an alanine instead of glutamines (Fig. 4A). This exceptional case may be due to the lack of eight residues before the histidine motif. Because three amino acids are missing in between residues 43 and 44 of T. maritima 3′ tRNase compared with the other enzymes that cleave after the discriminator, we also thought that this difference could be partly responsible for the differential cleavage site selection. We tested the variant Tm(43LTR44), which contains three additional residues, LTR, in between Tyr-43 and Val-44, but no cleavage was observed (Fig. 5, A and B). Additionally, a variant, Tm(V38A), that contains a single amino acid substitution in a non-conserved region, was tested as a control. As expected, it cleaved both pre-tRNAsArg, but cleavage sites were not shifted (Fig. 5, A and B). Essential Residues for the Catalysis—We also examined how substitutions of conserved amino acids affect the cleavage by 3′tRNase. Tm(H48A), Tm(H50A), and Tm(H53A), in which the histidines in the histidine motif were substituted with alanines, were found not to cleave both pre-tRNAsArg at all (Fig. 5, A and B). Likewise, Tm(D25A) and Tm(D52A) did not process both substrates. In contrast, cleavages by Tm(G27A) were observed at the original sites like the wild-type enzyme. These results suggest that the three histidines and one aspartate in the histidine motif and the aspartate at residue 25 are essential components for the catalysis. Furthermore, it should be noted that the percent cleavage by Tm(G49L) and Tm(G49L/V51G) decreased significantly (Fig. 5), suggesting that the glycine at residue 49 in the histidine motif is important for the T. maritima 3′ tRNase activity. Cleavage Site Selection by Other Prokaryotic 3′ tRNases—To corroborate the above notion on the cleavage site selection, we investigated properties of 3′ tRNases from another eubacteria E. coli and two archaea T. acidophilum and P. aerophilum (Fig. 4A). These enzymes were purified as histidine-tagged proteins (Fig. 6A), and assayed for in vitro tRNA 3′ processing of T. maritima pre-tRNAArg(CCA), pre-tRNAArg(GUG), and human pre-tRNAArg(GUG). The E. coli enzyme cleaved human pre-tRNAArg(GUG) primarily after the discriminator (Fig. 6D). This is consistent with the notion that the two glutamines are critical determinants for the cleavage after the discriminator (Fig. 4A). The T. maritima pre-tRNAArg(CCA) and pre-tRNAArg(GUG) were not substrates for this enzyme (Fig. 6, B and C). The T. acidophilum enzyme, which has two glutamines as the site selection residues, cleaved human pre-tRNAArg(GUG) after the discriminator and after G at nt 74 (Fig. 6D). Although T. maritima pre-tRNAArg(CCA) was not a substrate, T. maritima pre-tRNAArg-(GUG) was cleaved after G at nt 74 (Fig. 6, B and C). 3′ tRNase from P. aerophilum, which contains an arginine at 33 (in the numbering system of T. maritima 3′ tRNase) instead of the second glutamine (Fig. 4A), processed only T. maritima pre-tRNAArg(CCA), and the cleavage site was after C at nt 75 (Fig. 6B). On the whole, these results agree with the notion as to the cleavage site selection. The Role of 3′ tRNase in T. maritima Cells—To the best of our knowledge, T. maritima 3′ tRNase is the only endoribonuclease so far identified that can cleave pre-tRNAs after CCA. We showed that this enzyme can cleave three T. maritima pre-tRNAs, pre-tRNAArg(CCA), pre-tRNAMet(CCA), and pre-tRNAPhe(CCA), after the CCA residues. This implies that the enzyme can also cleave the other 42 CCA-containing pre-tRNAs after CCA. The exceptional pre-tRNAMet(UAG) was shown to be processed at the discriminator site, and the resulting pre-tRNA would be a good substrate for the CCA-adding enzyme. Thus, in theory, the CCA termini of all 46 T. maritima tRNAs should be able to be generated by these two enzymes. This consideration suggests that T. maritima cells probably utilize this novel mechanism to generate the CCA 3′-termini of tRNA molecules. RNase II and polynucleotide phosphorylase may be involved in shortening of long 3′ trailers in the same fashion as E. coli (23Li Z. Deutscher M.P. RNA (N. Y.). 2002; 8: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). T. maritima 3′ tRNase processed pre-tRNAs both with and without 7-nt 5′ leaders (Figs. 1 and 6D) like the mammalian enzyme (24Nashimoto M. Wesemann D.R. Geary S. Tamura M. Kaspar R.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2770-2776Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Although we have currently no information about how long the cellular 5′ leaders are, if they are less than 7 nt, T. maritima 3′ tRNase would cleave off 3′ trailers regardless of 5′ processing by RNase P (25Paul R. Lazarev D. Altman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 880-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Possible Conformational Change of Pre-tRNAMet(UAG)—The reason why the pre-tRNAMet(UAG) containing UAG instead of CCA at nt 74-76 was cleaved after the discriminator by T. maritima 3′ tRNase (Fig. 3B) may be because the enzyme can recognize the CCA residues at nt 71-73 as the cleavage site determinant in some way. One possible mechanism is that the enzyme would recognize an alternative conformation of the pre-tRNAMet(UAG), in which the CCA residues at nt 71-73 protrude from the acceptor stem and G at nt 70 shifts to the discriminator position (Fig. 3A). The T. maritima enzyme would recognize this form of the pre-tRNAMet(UAG) containing a distorted T-stem-loop in the same fashion as normal CCA-containing pre-tRNAs and would cleave it after A at nt 73. This supposition needs to be tested by examining pre-tRNA variants containing base substitutions that affect the stability of each conformer for 3′ tRNase cleavage and structure probing. The Interactions of T. maritima 3′ tRNase with Pre-tRNAs—The crystal structure of Bacillus cereus β-lactamase suggested that the histidine motif forms a part of the active site (26Carfi A. Pares S. Duee E. Galleni M. Duez C. Frere J.M. Dideberg O. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Consistently, our data suggest that the histidine motif in T. maritima 3′ tRNase forms an essential part of the catalytic core and that especially the three histidines and one aspartate play a central role for the catalysis. Pig 3′ tRNase clearly discriminates the nucleotide C from the others at nt 74 (8Nashimoto M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1148-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 11Mohan A. Whyte S. Wang X. Nashimoto M. Levinger L. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition, the very short 3′ trailers 74CC75, 74CCA76, and 74CCA76 plus one or two additional 3′ nt can be distinguished by this enzyme from the other trailers, suggesting that the pig enzyme has a binding domain for the CCA residues. From the present kinetics data (Table III), a CCA binding domain also appears to exist in the T. maritima enzyme. Whether 3′ tRNase cleaves pre-tRNAs after the discriminator or after the CCA residues may be determined by the relative position between the catalytic core and the CCA-binding domain. The amino acid residues at 31 and 33 (in the numbering system of T. maritima 3′ tRNase) appear to be critical for this positioning. When these two residues are glutamines, the active site may be located in the vicinity of the first C binding site, and the cleavage may occur after the discriminator. When the residues are other amino acids such as serine and threonine than glutamine, the catalytic site may be positioned near the A binding site, and pre-tRNAs may be cleaved after CCA. The hydroxyl groups of the serine and threonine residues may be critical for this positioning. Human ELAC2-type long 3′ tRNase, which has a phenylalanine and a glutamine at the corresponding sites, cleaves pre-tRNAs after the discriminator, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae ELAC2-type long 3′ tRNase, which contains a leucine and a threonine at the corresponding sites, also cleaves pre-tRNAs after the discriminator (13Takaku H. Minagawa A. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2272-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 27Tavtigian S.V. Simard J. Teng D.H. Abtin V. Baumgard M. Beck A. Camp N.J.

Neuhausen S. Rommens J. Cannon-Albright L.A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Compared with ELAC1-type short 3′ tRNases, the human and yeast long 3′ tRNases contain 5 and 6 more residues, respectively, between the site selection residues and the histidine motif, and the yeast enzyme also has several additional residues before the site selection residues (27Tavtigian S.V. Simard J. Teng D.H. Abtin V. Baumgard M. Beck A. Camp N.J. Carillo A.R. Chen Y. Dayananth P. Desrochers M. Dumont M. Farnham J.M. Frank D. Frye C. Ghaffari S. Gupte J.S. Hu R. Iliev D. Janecki T.

This could be the reason why the selection rule for short 3′ tRNases does not seem to hold in long 3′ tRNases. Cleavage of pre-tRNAs containing bases other than CA at nt 75 and 76 occurs after nt 75 (Fig. 2). This may be because these bases do not fit the CCA-binding domain well, and the catalytic core cannot be placed properly. Non- or inefficient cleavage of the CCG-containing pre-tRNAs (Fig. 2) may be attributed to somehow unfavorable interaction with the CCA-binding domain. Discrimination of Pre-tRNA Species by Prokaryotic 3′ tRNases and Their Roles in the Cells—The four prokaryotic 3′ tRNases tested here differed in substrate specificities and cleavage sites. If we can find out a rule to discriminate pre-tRNA substrates, this would become a clue to elucidation of the physiological roles of each enzyme in the cells. E. coli 3′ tRNase cleaved only human pre-tRNAArg(GUG) after the discriminator (Fig. 6). The property that this enzyme cannot cleave T. maritima pre-tRNAArg(CCA) makes sense, because removal of the CCA residues would be wasteful. The physiological roles of 3′ tRNase in E. coli cells are not clear, because the exoribonucleases are sufficient for tRNA 3′ processing. This gene thus might have been preserved for a backup system in case of occasional mutagenesis in the CCA-coding regions. Alternatively, this enzyme may be utilized to process other RNA substrates, including T4 bacteriophage pre-tRNAs that lack the CCA residues (28Deutscher M.P. Foulds J. McClain W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6696-6699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We could not explain why T. maritima pre-tRNAArg(GUG) was not cleaved. This is not due to the presence of the 5′ leader, because human pre-tRNAArg(GUG) with a 7-nt 5′ leader was processed as efficiently as human pre-tRNAArg(GUG) without the leader (data not shown). In good contrast to the T. maritima genome, the CCA sequences are not encoded in all 45 tRNA genes in the T. acidophilum genome with one exception (29Ruepp A. Graml W. Santos-Martinez M.L. Koretke K.K. Volker C. Mewes H.W. Frishman D. Stocker S. Lupas A.N. Baumeister W. Nature. 2000; 407: 508-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The cellular pre-tRNAs would probably be 3′-processed by 3′ tRNase, although the cleavage site could vary from after nt 74 to after the discriminator depending on pre-tRNA species, judging from our in vitro data. Because T. maritima pre-tRNAArg(CCA) was not cleaved by T. acidophilum 3′ tRNase, the exceptional CCA-containing pre-tRNA would be 3′-processed by RNase PH, which is encoded in the genome as the only RNase orthologue among the six E. coli enzymes. Although the P. aerophilum genome (30Fitz-Gibbon S.T. Ladner H. Kim U.J. Stetter K.O. Simon M.I. Miller J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 984-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) contains 19 CCA-coding and 27 non-CCA-coding tRNA genes, P. aerophilum 3′ tRNase cleaved only the CCA-containing pre-tRNAArg in vitro (Fig. 6). Thus, the 19 pre-tRNAs with CCA would be processed by either 3′ tRNase or RNase PH, which is encoded in the genome as the only RNase orthologue among the six exoribonucleases. With respect to the other 27 pre-tRNAs, RNase PH could trim 3′ trailers up to the discriminator, or other unidentified RNases could be involved. This case contrasts sharply with the Bacillus subtilis case, where the genome has ∼73% CCA-coding tRNA genes, and B. subtilis 3′ tRNase cleaves only CCA-less pre-tRNAs (31Pellegrini O. Nezzar J. Marchfelder A. Putzer H. Condon C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4534-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Evolution of the Mechanism to Generate the CCA 3′ Termini—The above consideration implies that the mechanism for 3′ tRNase to select substrates and cleavage sites must have co-evolved with the gain or loss of exoribonuclease genes and the CCA sequence encoded in tRNA genes and would currently be used properly depending on the presence or absence of CCA in pre-tRNAs. Curiously, the T. maritima CCA-adding enzyme groups with A-adding enzymes, not with CCA-adding enzymes or with CC-adding enzymes (32Tomita K. Weiner A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48192-48198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The presence of the two unusual enzymes 3′ tRNase and CCA-adding enzyme involved in the 3′-terminal CCA generation suggests that T. maritima has evolved very uniquely. We thank M. Takeda for technical assistance."

Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiologic agent of Chagas' disease, which is of major medical and economical significance in Latin America (1World Health Organization WHO Tech. Rep.

Parasitol. 2001; 31: 472-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Within the insect, two major developmental forms can be observed: replicative epimastigotes and metacyclic trypomastigotes. The latter form brings the infection into humans when released on the skin or mucosa after the insect blood meal. Following cell invasion, metacyclic trypomastigotes differentiate into amastigotes, which, after several divisions, transform into cell-derived trypomastigotes, which are then released into the bloodstream. This stage is able to invade a wide variety of nucleated cells, thus propagating the infection. A thick coat of glycoproteins covers the surface of all these developmental stages (3Alves M.J.

Recently, substantial information about the genetic structure and organization of mucin-like sequences in T. cruzi has been gained (20Di Noia J.M. Sanchez D.O. Frasch A.C.C. J. Biol.

Parasitol. 2004; 133: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). As a result, hundreds of genes have been identified, characterized, and arranged into two separate families on the basis of sequence homology (reviewed in Refs. 14Frasch A.C.C. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 282-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar and 27Di Noia J.M. D'Orso I. Frasch A.C.C. Kelly J.M. Molecular Mechanisms in the Pathogenesis of Chagas' Disease. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, Washington, D. C.2002: 31-56Google Scholar). One of these families, termed TcSMUG, is composed of 60–70 members that were originally divided in two groups (Small and Large) according to the size of their encoded mRNAs (24Di Noia J.M. D'Orso I. Sanchez D.O. Frasch A.C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10218-10227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The group S gene products are most probably expressed by the insect-dwelling stages, encoding a substantial part of the 35–50-kDa mucins that cover their surface (24Di Noia J.M. D'Orso I. Sanchez D.O. Frasch A.C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10218-10227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The in vivo expression of group L has not yet been demonstrated (see Fig. 1). Experimental evidence suggests that the second gene family, denoted as TcMUC, encodes the mucin core of the mammal-dwelling stages (20Di Noia J.M. Sanchez D.O. Frasch A.C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24146-24149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 22Di Noia J.M. D'Orso I. Aslund L. Sanchez D.O. Frasch A.C.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 27671-27680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, TcMUC consists of up to 700 members per haploid genome in the CL Brener clone of the parasite (22Di Noia J.M. D'Orso I. Aslund L. Sanchez D.O. Frasch A.C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10843-10850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 29Aguero F. Verdun R.E. Frasch A.C.C. Sanchez D.O. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1996-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), thus curtailing a genetic approach to address this issue. According to the structure of the deduced proteins, TcMUC genes were split into three major groups (22Di Noia J.M. D'Orso I. Aslund L. Sanchez D.O. Frasch A.C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10843-10850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 27Di Noia J.M. D'Orso I. Frasch A.C.C. Kelly J.M. Molecular Mechanisms in the Pathogenesis of Chagas' Disease. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, Washington, D. C.2002: 31-56Google Scholar). They encode 70–200-mer polypeptides that share highly homologous N- and C-terminal regions, corresponding to an endoplasmic reticulum targeting signal and a GPI anchor attachment signal, respectively. Divergences that account for their classification in different groups arise mainly in their central domains. Within this region, TcMUC I-deduced gene products contain Thr8-Lys-Pro2 tandem repeats, which are suitable targets for the O-glycosylation pathway in T. cruzi (28Pollevick G.D. Di Noia J.M. Salto M.L. Lima C. Leguizamon M.S. de Lederkremer R.M. Frasch A.C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27671-27680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 30Previato J.O. Sola-Penna M. Agrellos O.A. Jones C. Oeltmann T. Travassos L.R. Mendonça-Previato L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14982-14988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TcMUC I products were shown to behave as functional mucins in transfected parasites and to display an antigenic hypervariable region on their mature N termini (28Pollevick G.D. Di Noia J.M. Salto M.L. Lima C. Leguizamon M.S. de Lederkremer R.M. Frasch A.C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27671-27680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the single gene product of the TcMUC III group (termed TSSA) has been recently identified as an antigenic dimorphic protein expressed on the mammal-derived stages, which is able to differentiate the two major T. cruzi phylogenetic groups (31Di Noia J.M. Buscaglia C.A. De Marchi C.R. Almeida I.C. Frasch A.C.C. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 401-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 32Buscaglia C.A. Di Noia J.M. Microbes Infect. 2003; 5: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, TSSA is expressed in vivo as a single 20-kDa product, accounting therefore for a minor subset of tGPI-mucins. Finally, the products of TcMUC II display highly variable central sequences with no Thr8-Lys-Pro2 repeats, although they are rich enough in Thr, Ser, and Pro residues as to support their mucin-like denomination (see Fig. 1) (22Di Noia J.M. D'Orso I. Aslund L. Sanchez D.O. Frasch A.C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10843-10850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Hybridization analysis showed that TcMUC II genes are transcribed in variable amounts in all parasite stages (23Freitas-Junior L.H.G. Briones M.R.S. Schenkman S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 93: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, expression of TcMUC II at the protein level has never been confirmed. In this work, we demonstrate by multiple approaches that TcMUC II products are the major mucin components covering the surface of the trypomastigote stage found in the mammalian host. We also present evidence that multiple TcMUC II products are simultaneously expressed, thus suggesting a role for these molecules in T. cruzi immunoevasion. Parasites—The CL Brener genome project reference clone and the Y strain were used throughout this study (33Zingales B. Pereira M.E. Oliveira R.P. Almeida K.A. Umezawa E.S. Souto R.P. Vargas N.

Oxford University Press, New York1993: 349-383Google Scholar). Amino acid compositional analysis was performed according to Hendrickson and Meredith (36Hendrickson R.L. Meredith S.C. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 136: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar) as described previously (9Almeida I.C. Ferguson M.A.J. Schenkman S. Travassos L.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Trypsin Digestion and Purification of GPI-attached C-terminal Peptides—tGPI-mucins (0.1–1 nmol) were incubated with 2.5–25 μg of sequencing grade modified trypsin (Roche Diagnostics) in 10 μl of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8) for 18 h at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by acidification with 0.1% formic acid. For the purification of C-terminal peptides still attached to the GPI moiety (GPI-peptides), the incubation mixture was diluted 10-fold with 100 mm ammonium acetate containing 5% 1-propanol (buffer A) and applied to a 1-ml octyl-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with 3 ml of buffer A and submitted to stepwise elution with 1 ml of each 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60% 1-propanol in buffer A. Aliquots of 10 μl of each fraction were diluted 1:10 in 50% 1-propanol and 10 mm ammonium acetate and analyzed by mass spectrometry as described below. tGPI-peptides were eluted at the 20% 1-propanol fraction. Electrospray Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (ESI-TOF-MS) and Electrospray Time-of-Flight Tandem Mass Spectrometry (ESI-TOF-MS/MS) Analyses of GPI-Peptides—GPI-peptides were analyzed by ESI-TOF-MS in a Q-tof2™ mass spectrometer (Waters Micromass Ltd., Manchester, United Kingdom). Samples (10–20 μl) were introduced into the source by static infusion using a silica-fused nanotip. For ESI-TOF-MS analysis, the source capillary, cone, and collision energy voltages were set to 2.7 kV, 51 V, and 10 V, respectively. Scans were acquired in negative-ion mode at m/z 50–2000. For ESI-TOF-MS/MS analysis, the collision energy voltage was set to 45 V. All spectra were processed using MassLynx Version 3.5 software (Waters Micromass Ltd.). Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry Analysis of tGPI-Mucin Tryptic Peptides—Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry experiments were carried out using a capillary HPLC CapLC™ coupled to a Q-tof Ultima™ mass spectrometer (Waters Micromass Ltd.). A trypsin-digested tGPI-mucin sample (200 fmol, 4 μl) was loaded onto a C18 PepMap™ column (50 μm × 300 μm × 15 cm, LC Packings, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and washed with 10 μl of 0.1% formic acid at 30 μl/min. Elution was performed at 1 μl/min using 5% acetonitrile and 0.05% formic acid (solvent A) and 80% acetonitrile and 0.04% formic acid (solvent B) in a gradient programmed as follows: 5% solvent B, 3 min; 5–35% solvent B, 29 min; 35–80% solvent B, 3 min; 80% solvent B, 4 min; and 5% solvent B, 11 min. The eluate was introduced into the source through nanospray silica-fused tubing (360 × 75 μm). For ESI-TOF-MS analysis, the source capillary, cone, and collision energy voltages were set to 3.15 kV, 100 V, and 10 V, respectively. Scans were acquired in positive-ion mode at m/z 50–2000. For ESI-TOF-MS/MS analysis, the collision energy was set to 30–40 V. All spectra were processed using MassLynx Version 3.5 software. Peptide Mass fingerprinting and ESI-TOF-MS/MS analysis were carried out using a homemade data base containing exclusively complete, mature T. cruzi mucin sequences (n = 92), most of them already deposited in the GenBank™/EBI Data Bank. 2Available at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank. Glycopeptides and peptides were sequenced de novo using the Biolynx peptide sequencer function of MassLynx Version 3.5 software. Expression and Purification of Recombinant TcMUC II Constructs— Six genes belonging to the TcMUC II family and obtained from the CL Brener clone were utilized: EMUCt-4 (GenBank™/EBI accession number AY032683), EMUC-12b9 (accession numbers AF036406 and AF036428), and EMUCe-8 (accession number AF036420) (20Di Noia J.M.

Agüero F. Sánchez D.O. Frasch A.C.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 133: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The central domain of these genes was amplified by PCR using the following primers: EMUCt-4for (cgtggatccgccgatgcgttaccgtcaaa) and EMUCt-4rev (aaggaattcaaccgacccacctgacga); c2muc1for (cgtggatccgcttcttcaaaggtgacc) and c2muc1rev (cggaattcttgttttgcgggtgggttgtt); c2muc3for (cgtggatccagatccttccaatgcgac) and c2muc3rev (cggaattcaactgtttggtctgcggattg); EMUCe-12b9for (cgtggatccaagtaggcgaaagacagc) and EMUCe-12b9rev (ctgaattcagcttcctcgctagaatcgtc); and EMUCe-8for (cgtggatccagatccttccaatgcgac) and EMUCe-8rev (acgaattcggcgcattttccttctcactt). In addition, some genes were also amplified using the corresponding forward primer and either primer STOP (tcagcccagagtggtgtacgc) or primer Thr (aaggggttcactaggcgtctccgt). The amplification products were cloned into pGEM® T-Easy (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) or BamHI/EcoRI-digested and cloned into either the pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) or pTrcHisA (Invitrogen) cloning vector. The ensuing recombinant proteins contained an N-terminal fusion either with glutathione S-transferase (GST) or with a stretch of six His residues. Expression and purification of both kinds of chimeric proteins were carried out as described (37Buscaglia C.A. Campetella O. Leguizamon M.S. Frasch A.C.C. J. Infect. Dis. 1998; 177: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Immunization Procedures—BALB/c mice (60–90 days old) were immunized intraperitoneally with 25 μg of the corresponding GST fusion protein as described (31Di Noia J.M. Buscaglia C.A. De Marchi C.R. Almeida I.C. Frasch A.C.C. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 401-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Additional antisera were raised against synthetic peptides coupled through their C-terminal cysteine residue to Imject® maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce) following the manufacturer's guidelines. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—Polystyrene microplates (Maxisorp, Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated either with 100 ng of recombinant proteins or with 200 ng of bovine serum albumin-coupled peptides in phosphate-buffered saline and processed as described (31Di Noia J.M.

Serum Survey—Sera from untreated chronic Chagas' disease patients were either acquired from the Instituto Nacional de Parasitología “Dr. M. Fatala Chaben” (Buenos Aires, Argentina) (31Di Noia J.M. Buscaglia C.A. De Marchi C.R. Almeida I.C. Frasch A.C.C. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 401-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) or kindly provided by Dr. Dimas T. Covas (Fundacão Hemocentro de Ribeirão Preto, Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo, Brazil). Additional sera from rabbits and mice infected with different T. cruzi isolates were from our own stock (22Di Noia J.M. D'Orso I. Aslund L. Sanchez D.O. Frasch A.C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10843-10850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) or were kindly provided by Dr. Daniel Sánchez (Instituto de Investigaciones Biotecnológicas-Instituto Tecnológico de Chascomús, Universidad Nacional de General San Martín). Purification of EMUCt-4-specific Antibodies—Purified GST-EMUCt-4 protein (1 mg) was immobilized on a N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated column (HiTrap®, Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's guidelines. Five serum samples (100 μl each) of chronic Chagas' disease patients or T. cruzi infected rabbits, selected on the basis of their reactivity against GST-EMUCt-4 by ELISA, were pooled and applied to the column, and specific antibodies were purified as described (31Di Noia J.M. Buscaglia C.A. De Marchi C.R. Almeida I.C. Frasch A.C.C. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 401-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting with Purified tGPI-Mucins—Purified tGPI-mucins (Y strain) were blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-ECL™, Amersham Biosciences) and processed for chemiluminescent immunoblotting as described previously (9Almeida I.C. Ferguson M.A.J. Schenkman S. Travassos L.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Synthetic Peptides and SPOT Assays—Peptides spanning the consensus sequence (underlined) of the C-terminal peptide of TcMUC II-deduced (TRAPSRLREIDC) and TcMUC I-deduced (TRAPSSIRRIDC) proteins were custom-synthesized either as free peptides or by the SPOT procedure (Genosys Biotechnologies Inc., The Woodlands, TX) (38Frank R. Doring R. Tetrahedron. 1988; 44: 6031-6040Crossref Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In the latter case, peptides contained one extra N-terminal Thr residue and were devoid of the extra C-terminal Cys residue that enables their chemical coupling to a carrier protein (see above). Additional control SPOT peptides (TTSKAPTPGD and GSLGSSAWACAP) were synthesized on the same filters. Membranes were probed with Chagas' disease sera at 1:100 dilutions as described (31Di Noia J.M. Buscaglia C.A. De Marchi C.R. Almeida I.C. Frasch A.C.C. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 401-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Indirect Immunofluorescence Assay—Parasites (5–10 × 104) in phosphate-buffered saline were layered onto 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane-coated round coverslips and processed essentially as described (31Di Noia J.M. Buscaglia C.A. De Marchi C.R. Almeida I.C. Frasch A.C.C. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 401-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To evaluate the reactivity of intracellular stages (amastigotes, trypomastigotes, and intermediate forms), 10,000 HeLa or Vero cells were plated onto round coverslips 96 h after infection. After 16 h, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed, and processed as described above, with the addition of 0.1% saponin to the blocking and antibody solutions. Amino Acid Composition of Purified tGPI-Mucins—The amino acid composition of three different batches of purified tGPI-mucins was determined, rendering homogeneous results (Table I) (9Almeida I.C. Ferguson M.A.J. Schenkman S. Travassos L.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). We compared the average amino acid composition of tGPI-mucins with the predicted amino acid composition of putative mature proteins coded by the TcMUC (groups I–III) and TcSMUG (groups S and L) gene families (Table I). Overall, the average amino acid composition of tGPI-mucins was very similar to that predicted for TcMUC II products (Table I). We tried to determine the N-terminal sequence of the tGPI-mucins by Edman degradation, but no sequence was obtained. One possible explanation is that the N terminus of tGPI-mucins is blocked. Alternatively, the purified tGPI-mucins might be a mixture of gene products, each of them having a different N terminus (see below).Table IAmino acid composition of predicted and trypomastigote-derived mucins of T. cruziAmino acidMature protein compositionaPredicted values similar (within <10% error) to the experimental values are indicated (boldface).PredictedExperimental, tGPI-mucin(n = 3)TcMUC I (n = 15)TcMUC II (n = 15)TcMUC IIIbOnly TSSA II sequences were analyzed.

https://openalex.org/W2025890332,"Some <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i> (group A streptococci, GAS) strains have previously been shown to express the fibronectin-binding protein F2 instead of the functionally related but structurally dissimilar protein F1/SfbI. In this study, recombinant N-terminal and C-terminal portions and the two fibronectin-binding domains of protein F2 were used to assess affinity parameters of the interaction with fibronectin and its N-terminal 70-, 30-, and 45-kDa fragments. The association and dissociation equilibrium constants for both binding domains were in the nanomolar range, although the repeat domain of protein F2 exceeded the affinity of the unique domain by up to one order magnitude. Both domains primarily interacted with the 30-kDa fibronectin fragment. Using a <i>prt</i>F2 gene isogenic mutant of a serotype M49 GAS strain that does not harbor the protein F1/SfbI gene, the attachment values of whole bacteria to immobilized fibronectin and to HEp-2 epithelial cells were found to be 6- and 2-fold decreased, respectively. Reduction of <i>prt</i>F2 mutant internalization rates for eukaryotic cells exceeded the reduction of attachment rates, indicating an independent contribution of protein F2 to both processes. The <i>prt</i>F2 transcription and protein F2 expression profiles documented maximum expression at the transition to the stationary phase especially under aerobic growth condition. The protein F2 function as the major fibronectin-binding adhesin in a subset of GAS strains, its expression pattern, and highly specific interaction with fibronectin would be consistent with a status as an indispensable virulence factor for both earlier and later pathogenetic stages of GAS superficial infections."
https://openalex.org/W2089629155,"Recurrent disease following high-dose chemotherapy is a major problem in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To identify its characteristics, we performed expression profiling in blasts from untreated AML and relapse, using a specific cDNA microarray comprising 4128 genes generated by cDNA subtraction supplemented with cancer-associated genes. Expression analysis of 18 AML bone marrow specimens showed that recurrent AML is commonly associated with the mRNA expression changes in a set of 58 genes. Increased cellular proliferation was indicated by the overexpression of the transferrin receptor, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and G1 cyclins. An immunohistochemical study for Ki-67-positive blasts in 18 paired bone marrow biopsy samples confirmed a highly significant (P<0.0001) increase in the proliferation fraction at relapse. In addition, we found enhanced activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK cascade as mRNAs of MKP-1, c-jun, c-fos, and egr-1 were significantly increased at relapse. Immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting analyses for biphosphorylated ERK1/2 protein provide additional evidence for enhanced activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. The degree of increase is significantly correlated with the increased proliferation. Furthermore, the genes identified provide a rationale for further studies on predictive diagnosis and therapeutic intervention."

https://openalex.org/W1970221770,"Cα-Formylglycine (FGly) is the catalytic residue of sulfatases. FGly is generated by post-translational modification of a cysteine (prokaryotes and eukaryotes) or serine (prokaryotes) located in a conserved (C/S)XPXR motif. AtsB of Klebsiella pneumoniae is directly involved in FGly generation from serine. AtsB is predicted to belong to the newly discovered radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) superfamily. By in vivo and in vitro studies we show that SAM is the critical co-factor for formation of a functional AtsB·SAM·sulfatase complex and for FGly formation by AtsB. The SAM-binding site of AtsB involves 83GGE85 and possibly also a juxtaposed FeS center coordinated by Cys39 and Cys42, as indicated by alanine scanning mutagenesis. Mutation of these and other conserved cysteines as well as treatment with metal chelators fully impaired FGly formation, indicating that all three predicted FeS centers are crucial for AtsB function. It is concluded that AtsB oxidizes serine to FGly by a radical mechanism that is initiated through reductive cleavage of SAM, thereby generating the highly oxidizing deoxyadenosyl radical, which abstracts a hydrogen from the serine-CβH2-OH side chain.

In the ground state of the sulfatase, the FGly is hydrated bearing two geminal hydroxyls at the Cβ-carbon (5Boltes I. Czapinski H. Kahnert A. von Bülow R. Dierks T. Schmidt B. von Figura K.

Upon binding of a sulfate ester substrate, one of the hydroxyls performs a nucleophilic attack on the sulfur atom leading to transfer of the sulfate group onto the enzyme. The second hydroxyl is essential for sulfate elimination from this sulfated enzyme intermediate to regenerate the formyl group (5Boltes I. Czapinski H. Kahnert A. von Bülow R. Dierks T.

In essence, the water molecule initially added to the enzyme for hydration of the formyl group allows performance of “intramolecular hydrolysis” of a sulfate ester. This novel hydrolytic mechanism explains the functional importance of the FGly residue. Failure to generate FGly in human leads to multiple sulfatase deficiency, a rare but fatal inherited disorder characterized by the synthesis of catalytically inactive sulfatases (8Hopwood J.J.

In most eukaryotes FGly residues are generated by the recently discovered FGly-generating enzyme (FGE), and it is the genetic deficiency of FGE that causes multiple sulfatase deficiency (9Dierks T.

FGE acts in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum shortly after import of the nascent sulfatase polypeptide and modifies a cysteine residue located in a conserved CXPXR motif (11Dierks T.

Chem. 2001; 276: 47021-47028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This cysteine undergoes Cβ-oxidation and S-elimination by an as yet unknown reaction mechanism. FGE is encoded in the SUMF1 gene and belongs to a protein family consisting of a domain of unknown function that does not allow prediction of any aspect of its mechanism of action (15Landgrebe J. Dierks T. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 316: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It was proposed that a cysteine cluster, located at the highly conserved C terminus of FGE, may be involved in catalysis, because this region is a hot spot for mutations in multiple sulfatase deficiency patients (9Dierks T. Schmidt B. Borissenko L.V. Peng J. Preusser A. Mariappan M. von Figura K. Cell. 2003; 113: 435-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). SUMF1 genes are lacking in Caenorhabditis elegans, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Neurospora crassa that are known to express active sulfatases, which indicates the existence of a second FGly-generating system in eukaryotes. In a variety of prokaryotes SUMF1 orthologs can be found in sulfatase operons (15Landgrebe J. Dierks T. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 316: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As in eukaryotes, some bacteria known to generate FGly residues by cysteine modification, e.g. Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16Dierks T. Miech C. Hummerjohann J. Schmidt B. Kertesz M.A. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25560-25564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), lack SUMF1 orthologs. Thus, in bacteria a second cysteine-modifying system also exists, orthologs of which may be operative in those eukaryotes lacking FGE, thereby functionally closing the phylogenetic gap mentioned above. It should be noted that FGE as well as the E. coli and P. aeruginosa cysteine-modifying systems are strictly cysteine-specific (6Recksiek M. Selmer T. Dierks T. Schmidt B. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6096-6103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 16Dierks T. Miech C. Hummerjohann J. Schmidt B. Kertesz M.A. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25560-25564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The remarkable versatility of bacteria to generate the critical FGly residue is highlighted by the fact that a number of species express sulfatases in which a serine residue is oxidized to FGly, a modification directed by a homologous SXPXR motif (17Miech C. Dierks T. Selmer T. von Figura K. Schmidt B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4835-4837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These serine-type sulfatases, in contrast to the cytosolic cysteine-type sulfatases, show periplasmic localization (18Murooka Y. Ishibashi K. Yasumoto M. Sasaki M. Sugino H. Azakami H. Yamashita M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2131-2140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Marquordt C. Fang Q. Will E. Peng J. von Figura K. Dierks T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2212-2218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and are specifically modified by a cytosolic protein termed AtsB in Klebsiella pneumoniae (19Marquordt C. Fang Q. Will E. Peng J. von Figura K. Dierks T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2212-2218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 20Szameit C. Miech C. Balleininger M. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Dierks T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15375-15381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). AtsB is co-expressed with the sulfatase AtsA (arylsulfatase of K. pneumoniae) being encoded on the same ats operon. Co-expression of AtsB was shown to be strictly required for AtsA modification in E. coli where it acts in trans on AtsA (20Szameit C. Miech C. Balleininger M. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Dierks T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15375-15381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). AtsB interacts with the FGly modification motif of AtsA in a serine-specific manner, as was shown in yeast two-hybrid and GST pull-down experiments (19Marquordt C. Fang Q. Will E. Peng J. von Figura K. Dierks T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2212-2218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). FGly generation from cysteine and serine share the (C/S)XPXR modification motif. Furthermore, in vivo FGE and AtsB both rely on transmembrane translocation of the sulfatase or at least on the presence of a signal peptide in the sulfatase substrate (11Dierks T. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11963-11968Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 19Marquordt C. Fang Q. Will E. Peng J. von Figura K. Dierks T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2212-2218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, AtsB-mediated FGly generation may occur, when the unfolded sulfatase protein is being translocated, acting on the cis-side of the membrane, in contrast to the microsomal FGE, which acts on the trans-side. When studying AtsA modification in E. coli, its two chromosomal atsB orthologs did not substitute for Klebsiella atsB, most likely because bacterial sulfatase operons generally are repressed under conditions of sulfur supply. On the contrary, the cysteine-modifying system of E. coli was found to be expressed under any conditions tested. This difference in the regulation of the structural and modifying genes of the sulfatases may suggest that at least the cysteine-modifying system of E. coli fulfills also further, possibly essential functions and that FGly is present also in some non-sulfatase proteins. In contrast to FGly generation from cysteine, where no mechanistic information for the modification reaction is available, some aspects of AtsB-mediated serine oxidation may be inferred by bioinformatics. AtsB was proposed to belong to the so-called radical SAM protein superfamily that generates a deoxyadenosyl radical via reductive cleavage of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) (21Sofia H.J. Chen G. Hetzler B.G. Reyes-Spindola J.F. Miller N.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1097-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). This radical in turn could generate a substrate radical that undergoes further reaction (22Frey P.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 121-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 23Cheek J. Broderick J.B. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2001; 6: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 24Jarrett J.T. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2003; 7: 174-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the oxidation of serine to FGly, i.e. serine semialdehyde, would involve two single electron transfer steps. These electrons are likely to be donated/accepted by FeS centers, three of which have been predicted for AtsB on the basis of its conserved cysteine clusters (25Schirmer A. Kolter R. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: R181-R186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Here we experimentally test this hypothetical mechanism, investigating the involvement of SAM as a co-factor and of the predicted FeS centers as redox catalysts for FGly generation in vivo and in vitro.

SAM-chloride and 2,4-dinitrophenyl hydrazine were obtained from Fluka; SAHC and GSH-agarose were from Sigma; [methyl-3H]SAM (TRK865, 80 Ci/mmol) and anti-GST antibodies (goat) were from Amersham Biosciences; and trypsin was from Promega. Site-directed Mutagenesis—All of the mutations were generated by the QuikChange method (Stratagene) using atsBA (cloned into pBluescript II KS, 20) as template and complementary mutagenesis primers. The coding sequences of these primers were: CACCTCGCCGATGGCGGCCGCGGCGGCATCAATGCTGCTC (atsA-S72A/P74A/R76A), CTTTGTCTGGCAGGCGGGCGAGCCGC (atsB-G83A), CTGGCAGGGGGCCGAGCCGCTGCTAG (atsB-G84A), GCAGGGGGGCGCGCCGCTGCTAGC (atsB-E85A), GCAGGGGGGCGAGGGGCTGCTAGCCGG (atsBP86G), GCAGGGGGGCGAGGCGCTGCTAGCC (atsB-P86A), GGGGCGAGCCGGCGCTAGCCGGCC (atsB-L87A), GGCGAGCCGCTGGCAGCCGGCCTGAGC (atsB-L88A), GCAATCTCGCCGCCCGCTATTGCTATTAC (atsB-C39A), GCCTGCCGCTATGCCTATTACCCGCAG, (atsB-C42A), CCAGCGGCAGCGCCGTGCACAGCGC (atsB-C270A), CTGCGCCGCGAAGCCCAGACTTGCTCG (atsB-C331A), and GCGAATGCCAGACTGCCTCGGTAAAAATGG (atsB-C334A). For construction of GST-AtsA, AtsA-residues 21–112 were fused with GST using the pGEX-KG vector, as described earlier (19Marquordt C. Fang Q. Will E. Peng J. von Figura K. Dierks T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2212-2218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). All of the mutations and constructs were analyzed by full-length sequencing of coding regions to preclude any PCR-derived errors. Protein Expression—E. coli DH5α was transformed with the following plasmids (for construction see above): pGEX-KG containing either gst-atsA or gst-atsA-S72A/P74A/R76A or pBluescript II containing either atsA, atsB, or atsBA (atsB with or without mutations, as indicated for each experiment). SAM-binding site mutants of AtsB were co-expressed with GroEL/ES in double transformants containing also the pT-groE plasmid (26Yasukawa T. Kanei-Ishii C. Maekawa T. Fujimoto J. Yamamoto T. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25328-25331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The presence of the two plasmids was maintained in selective medium containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol and was routinely checked by PCR analysis. Overnight cultures were used to inoculate 100 ml of fresh liquid medium (1% inoculum). For induction of protein expression, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to 0.2 (for pGEX) or 0.5 mm (for pBluescript II) upon reaching an A600 value of 0.3–0.5, and culture was maintained for another 3 h at 37 °C. For SAM-binding site mutants of AtsB only, expression was performed in overnight (14 h) cultures and inoculated from glycerol stocks without the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. In Vitro Interaction and FGly Modification Assay—Bacteria expressing GST-AtsA were sedimented, washed once in PBS (pH 7.4), resuspended in PBS (pH 7.4) containing 8 m urea, and disrupted in a French press cell. The soluble material (75,000 × g supernatant) was subjected to dialysis against PBS to remove the urea. The dialyzed material was cleared by centrifugation (as above). For in vitro interaction, 0.75 ml of the supernatant was mixed with 0.75 ml of an E. coli French press lysate (in PBS), containing AtsB protein, and incubated at 37 °C for 15-60 min in the absence or presence of different concentrations of SAM. Where indicated, [3H]SAM (1 μCi) was added as tracer. After incubation, the interaction mixture, corresponding to ∼5 mg of total E. coli protein, was loaded on a GSH-agarose column (0.2 ml of bed volume), and the flow-through was immediately collected without further incubation. The column was washed six times with 4 column volumes of PBS and then eluted three times with 1 column volume of 10 mm glutathione in PBS (pH 8.0). The eluate fractions were analyzed for GST-AtsA and AtsB by Western blotting and for [3H]SAM by liquid scintillation counting. To test for in vitro FGly generation, the incubation of the interaction mixture described above was carried out at 37 °C for 1–3 h in the presence of 500 μm SAM. Where indicated (see Figs. 3, 4C, and 5C), another 500 μm SAM was added to the interaction mixture when half of the incubation time had passed. After incubation, the GST-AtsA fusion protein was purified by GSH-agarose, separated by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to tryptic digestion and mass spectrometry (see below). It should be noted that all experiments could also be performed using purified GST-AtsA for interaction and modification reactions. However, using purified AtsB led to poor interaction with GST-AtsA. Rather, the E. coli lysate containing AtsB had to be freshly prepared avoiding exposure to room temperature.Fig. 4Alanine scanning mutagenesis of the putative SAM-binding site of AtsB.

The presence of FGly in AtsA and GST-AtsA was analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry at the level of their tryptic peptides.

Using an AtsA fragment (amino acid residues 21–112) fused to the C terminus of glutathione S-transferase (GST-AtsA) and an E. coli cell lysate containing overexpressed AtsB, we observed an association of AtsB with GST-AtsA that both bound to and co-eluted from GSH-agarose, as was described earlier (see Ref. 19Marquordt C. Fang Q. Will E. Peng J. von Figura K. Dierks T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2212-2218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It turned out that addition of 500 μm SAM significantly improved AtsB binding, whereas 500 μm SAHC completely inhibited AtsB binding (Fig. 1A). The association of GST-AtsA and AtsB and its stimulation by SAM required incubation of all interaction partners at 25–37 °C for ≥5 min; at 0 °C interaction was rather inefficient (Fig. 1B). This suggests that formation of a stable complex, which can be pulled down by GSH-agarose, involves a rate-limiting step that is temperature-dependent. In the presence of SAM, formation of this complex increased with time over a 60-min period (Fig. 1C). Without the addition of SAM, the complex formed initially but was lost upon incubation for longer than 30 min. This transient complex is attributed to the presence of some endogenous SAM in the E. coli lysate, which initially promotes complex formation and decomposes during the 37 °C incubation, thus destabilizing the complex. Control experiments showed that GST-AtsA·AtsB complex formation in the presence of 50 μm SAM reached a maximum after ≈15 min at 37 °C. At ≥300 μm SAM the complex was stable for more than 60 min (Fig. 1C and data not shown). To prove that SAM indeed is part of a ternary GST-AtsA·AtsB·SAM complex, we added 3H-labeled SAM as a tracer to the incubation mixture containing 50 μm SAM. After loading this mixture to GSH-agarose and extensive washing of the column, the GSH eluate was collected and analyzed for AtsB by Western blotting and for SAM by liquid scintillation counting. It turned out that significant amounts of radioactivity bound to the column and co-eluted with AtsB. No radioactivity was recovered in the eluate of GSH-agarose loaded with an incubation mixture lacking AtsB (Fig. 2A, compare first and third lanes). In a further control GST-AtsA-S72A/P74A/R76A was used as bait. This mutant bound neither AtsB nor SAM (Fig. 2A, second lane). SAM stimulated GST-AtsA/AtsB interaction in a concentration-dependent manner. Under standard conditions (incubation for 15 min at 37 °C), half-maximum stimulation was observed at ∼20–40 μm SAM, and saturation was observed at ∼150–300 μm SAM (Fig. 2B). Also the amount of [3H]SAM co-eluting from GSH-agarose together with GST-AtsA and AtsB showed a clear dependence on the applied SAM concentration. At ≥300 μm SAM nearly equimolar amounts of AtsB and SAM were recovered in the eluate (Fig. 2B); in three experiments SAM and AtsB bound in a ratio of 0.69 ± 0.06. At nonsaturating SAM concentrations, the amount of bound SAM was clearly lower than the amount of bound AtsB (Fig. 2B). This difference may reflect a cooperative stimulation of AtsB binding by SAM to avoid deoxyadenosyl radical formation in the absence of substrate (see “Discussion”). However, we cannot exclude that some SAM is lost from the AtsB·GST-AtsA complex because of catalytic turnover (see below) and/or because of the non-steady-state conditions on the affinity column during washing and elution. Previous results have shown that AtsB and GST-AtsA associate with each other in a ratio of 0.54 (19Marquordt C. Fang Q. Will E. Peng J. von Figura K. Dierks T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2212-2218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Taken together these data suggest that binding of SAM to AtsB efficiently promotes formation of a ternary AtsA·AtsB·SAM complex and that the three interaction partners are likely to be present in this complex in a 1:1:1 ratio. SAM-dependent in Vitro FGly Formation by AtsB—The data shown above suggest that FGly modification of serine depends on SAM. To directly measure the effect of SAM on the FGly-generating activity of AtsB, an in vitro system with limiting SAM levels had to be established. In a previous study, we failed to observe FGly formation in an in vitro system, when GST-AtsA was incubated with a soluble extract of E. coli overexpressing AtsB (19Marquordt C. Fang Q. Will E.

https://openalex.org/W1971750542,"Synthesis of active Klebsiella aerogenes urease requires four accessory proteins to generate, in a GTP-dependent process, a dinuclear nickel active site with the metal ions bridged by a carbamylated lysine residue. The UreD and UreF accessory proteins form stable complexes with urease apoprotein, comprised of UreA, UreB, and UreC. The sites of protein-protein interactions were explored by using homobifunctional amino group-specific chemical cross-linkers with reactive residues being identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) of tryptic peptides. On the basis of studies of the UreABCD complex, UreD is capable of cross-linking with UreB Lys9, UreB Lys76, and UreC Lys401. Furthermore UreD appears to be positioned over UreC Lys515 according to decreased reactivity of this residue compared with its reactivity in UreD-free apoprotein. Several UreB-UreC and UreC-UreC cross-links also were observed within this complex; e.g. UreB Lys76 with the UreC amino terminus, UreB Lys9 with UreC Lys20, and UreC Lys515 with UreC Lys89. These interactions are consistent with the proximate surface locations of these residues observed in the UreABC crystal structure. MALDI-TOF MS analyses of UreABCDF are consistent with a cross-link between the UreF amino terminus and UreB Lys76. On the basis of an unexpected cross-link between UreB Lys76 and UreC Lys382 (distant from each other in the UreABC structure) along with increased side chain reactivities for UreC Lys515 and Lys522, UreF is proposed to induce a conformational change within urease that repositions UreB and potentially could increase the accessibility of nickel ions and CO2 to residues that form the active site.

The hydrolysis of urea to form carbonic acid and two molecules of ammonia is catalyzed by urease, an enzyme found in all plants and many species of algae, fungi, and bacteria (1Hausinger R.P. Karplus P.A. Wieghardt K. Huber R. Poulos T.L. Messerschmidt A. Handbook of Metalloproteins. John Wiley & Sons, y, West Sussex, UK2001: 867-879Google Scholar). The primary role of plant urease is to recycle arginase-derived urea nitrogen during germination (2Zonia L.E. Stebbins N.E. Polacco J.C. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 1097-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), whereas microbial ureases decompose many environmental sources of urea to supply ammonia as a nitrogen source (3Mobley H.L.T. Hausinger R.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 85-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the bacterial enzyme is a virulence factor that participates in gastroduodenal infection (4Stingl K. Altendorf K. Bakker E.P. Trends Microbiol. 2002; 10: 70-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), urinary stone formation (5McLean R.J. Nickel J.C. Cheng K.-J.

Urease sequences from diverse sources are more than 60% identical despite having differences in the numbers of subunits. Plant and fungal ureases contain a single type of subunit, such as the 840-residue polypeptide from jack bean (7Takishima K. Suga T. Mamiya G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 175: 151-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In contrast, Helicobacter pylori urease is comprised of two subunits containing 238 and 569 residues that match distinct portions of the eukaryote enzyme (8Labigne A. Cussac V. Courcoux P. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1920-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Finally bacteria such as Klebsiella aerogenes possess a three-subunit urease (UreA, UreB, and UreC of 100, 106, and 567 residues, respectively) (9Mulrooney S.B. Hausinger R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5837-5843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) again matching segments of the plant enzyme sequence. The homology is reflected in the similarity of three-dimensional structures determined for the enzymes from K. aerogenes (10Jabri E. Carr M.B. Hausinger R.P. Karplus P.A.

In all examples the active site is deeply buried in the protein and includes a dinuclear nickel metallocenter with the two metals (separated by ∼3.6 Å) bridged by a carbamylated lysine residue. As described below, synthesis of the unique urease metallocenter is a highly complex process requiring nickel ions, carbon dioxide (needed for lysine carbamylation), several accessory proteins, and GTP (for a review, see Ref. 15Mulrooney S.B. Hausinger R.P. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 239-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The current model for urease activation initiates with ribosomal synthesis and chaperonin-facilitated folding (16Kansau I. Guillain F. Thiberge J.-M. Labigne A. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 1013-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) of the urease apoprotein UreABC. 1The abbreviations used are: UreABC, urease apoprotein; UreABCD, complex of UreD and UreABC; UreABCDF, complex of UreF and UreABCD; UreABCDFG, complex of UreG and UreABCDF; BS3, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate; C-cam, carbamidomethylated Cys; C-pam, Cys-S-β-propionamide (acrylamide-modified cysteine); DMA, dimethyladipimidate; DMS, dimethylsuberimidate; DSA, disuccinimidyladipic acid; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight; MS, mass spectrometry; ox, oxidized. Structural characterization of UreABC reveals an identical fold to holoenzyme with no metal or carbamylation present (17Jabri E. Karplus P.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10616-10626Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Studies with the recombinant K. aerogenes system have shown that UreABC forms complexes with the UreD, UreF, and UreG accessory proteins (encoded adjacent to the structural genes in the ureDABCEFG cluster). In particular, UreABCD (18Park I.-S. Carr M.B. Hausinger R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3233-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 19Park I.-S. Hausinger R.P.

Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5417-5421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and UreAB-CDFG complexes have been characterized (21Park I.-S. Hausinger R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1947-1951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Soriano A. Hausinger R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11140-11144Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Deletion of any of the K. aerogenes ureD, ureF, or ureG genes results in undetectable urease activity, thus highlighting their essential nature (23Lee M.H. Mulrooney S.B. Renner M.J. Markowicz Y. Hausinger R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4324-4330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fungal and plant homologues to ureD, ureF, and ureG also are essential for generation of urease activity (24Bacanamwo M. Witte C.-P. Lubbers M.W. Polacco J.C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2002; 268: 525-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). UreABC and the larger urease apoprotein complexes of K. aerogenes are partially activated by incubation with nickel ions and bicarbonate (as a source of carbon dioxide) with full activity achieved by additional inclusion of GTP and UreE (25Soriano A. Colpas G.J. Hausinger R.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12435-12440Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). GTP hydrolysis occurs only within the UreABCDFG complex in a UreG-dependent reaction (22Soriano A. Hausinger R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11140-11144Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). UreE serves a metallochaperone role by delivering the requisite metal ion to the UreABCDFG complex. Structures of UreE from K. aerogenes (26Song H.K. Mulrooney S.B. Huber R. Hausinger R.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 10731-10737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) indicate that the critical metal-binding site is located at the dimer interface generated by one domain of the two-domain protein. The second UreE domain resembles the structure of a domain found in an Hsp40 chaperone, leading to speculation that this UreE domain might participate in protein target recognition. Very little is known about the sites of binding between the accessory components and urease subunits. Yeast two-hybrid analyses coupled with immunoprecipitation studies (using anti-UreC or anti-UreD antibodies) identified UreA-UreC, UreA-UreA, UreE-UreE, UreC-UreD, and UreD-UreF interactions in the Proteus mirabilis system (30Heimer S.R. Mobley H.L.T. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1423-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Yeast two-hybrid studies of the H. pylori system identified interactions between UreD (alternatively named UreH in that microorganism) and both UreA (equivalent to the fusion of UreA plus UreB in most bacteria) and UreF (31Rain J.-C. Selig L. de Reuse H. Battaglia V. Reverdy C. Simon S. Lenzen G. Petel F. Wojcik J. Schächter V. Chemama Y. Labigne A. Legrain P.

Physiol. 2003; 284: G96-G106Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Additional evidence was consistent with the following interactions in H. pylori: UreA-UreA, UreA-UreB (where UreB is equivalent to UreC in other bacteria), and UreE-UreG. In this study we examined accessory protein-urease interactions for two stable complexes, UreABCD and UreABCDF, of K. aerogenes by using a chemical cross-linking approach. UreABCDFG was not examined because it is less stable (due to UreG dissociation) and because of its increased complexity. Analysis of the tryptic peptides derived from the cross-linked samples made use of matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS). We tentatively identify specific sites of cross-linking between UreD and both UreB and UreC. In addition, we provide evidence for a previously undescribed interaction between UreF and UreB and identify the putative sites of cross-linking between these proteins. Furthermore we establish several UreF-dependent changes in reactivity of the urease side chains with cross-linking reagents consistent with a significant conformational change occurring in the presence of UreF that may be relevant to metallocenter assembly. Materials—Dimethyladipimidate (DMA), dimethylsuberimidate (DMS), and bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3) were purchased from Pierce. Adipic acid, anhydrous 1,4-dioxane, 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (1.0 m solution in dichloromethane), glycine, dithiothreitol, iodoacetamide, trifluoroacetic acid, and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid were purchased from Sigma. Acetonitrile was from EM Science (Gibbstown, NJ). Sequencing grade modified trypsin was from Promega (Madison, WI). Disuccinimidyladipate (DSA) was synthesized on a Schlenk line by following a published procedure that involved carbodiimide coupling of adipic acid to N-hydroxysuccinimide in 1,4-dioxane solvent (33Pearson K.M.

Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5417-5421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in 4 liters of Luria-Bertani medium with 100 mg/liter ampicillin. All cultures were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 40 ml of HEDG buffer (25 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% glycerol, pH 7.4). The resuspended cells were disrupted by one to two passages through a French pressure cell (American Instrument Co.) at 18,000 pounds/square inch. Cell extracts were obtained after removal of cell debris and membranes by centrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 60 min. Protein Purification—UreABC, UreABCD, and UreABCDF forms of urease apoprotein were purified according to published procedures (18Park I.-S. Carr M.B. Hausinger R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3233-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 20Moncrief M.B. Hausinger R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5417-5421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Todd M.J. Hausinger R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5963-5967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that HEDG buffer was used in all purification steps and NaCl was used for linear salt gradient elution of the proteins. The proteins were greater than 95% homogeneous on the basis of denaturing SDS-PAGE analysis (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207523) Google Scholar). Molecular weight markers were obtained from Bio-Rad. Cross-linking Experiments—Selected urease complexes were treated with the following cross-linking reagents: BS3, DMA, DMS, and DSA. Samples of UreABC, UreABCD, and UreABCDF (25 μl of 50 μm “UreABC unit”) were incubated at room temperature with BS3 (3200-, 1600-, 600-, and 400-fold molar excess) in 15 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, and after 60 min the reactions were quenched by adding 15 μl of 1 m glycine, pH 6.5. UreABCD (300 μl of 5 μm UreABC unit) was mixed with DMA or DMS (20 μl of 125 mm) in HEDG buffer, pH 7.4, and incubated for 50 min at room temperature before quenching with 30 μl of 1 m glycine, pH 6.5. UreABCD (200 μl of 5 μm UreABC unit) was incubated with DSA (0.5 μlof2mm in dimethyl sulfoxide) in HEDG buffer, pH 7.4, for 18 h at room temperature and then quenched by adding 5 μl of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5. Gel Electrophoresis and In-gel Digestion—The cross-linked samples and controls were denatured in sample buffer containing 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue by boiling for 2 min. Electrophoresis was carried out at room temperature using 12 or 13.5% acrylamide running gels. Selected bands were excised with a razor blade, chopped into 1-mm3 pieces, and collected in siliconized microcentrifuge tubes. A similar size gel piece from the blank region was also cut out and treated in parallel. The gel pieces were washed with 100 μl of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.5) for 5 min, dehydrated in 50 μl of acetonitrile at room temperature for 15 min, and dried in a Speed Vac for 15 min. The gel particles were rehydrated with 50 μl of 10 mm dithiothreitol in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer and heated at 56 °C for 30 min to reduce the disulfides. The gel pieces were dehydrated twice in 50 μl of acetonitrile at room temperature for 5 min and dried in a Speed Vac for 15 min. 50 μl of 55 mm iodoacetamide in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer was added to each sample and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 20 min to alkylate cysteine residues. The gel pieces were washed briefly with the ammonium bicarbonate buffer and incubated with 100 μl of the same solution at room temperature for 15 min. The gel particles were dehydrated with 50 μl of acetonitrile for 15 min and dried completely in the Speed Vac. 20 μl of 13 ng/μl sequencing grade modified trypsin (in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer) was added to each of the samples and the controls to cover the gel pieces completely. After digestion (37 °C overnight), the supernatants were collected by washing the gel pieces twice with 15 μl of 60% acetonitrile, 1% trifluoroacetic acid. The pooled supernatants were dried in a Speed Vac, and the peptides were dissolved in 8 μl of 3% trifluoroacetic acid in water. MALDI-TOF MS—MALDI-TOF MS typically was performed on a Voyager-DE STR time-of-flight instrument (Applied Biosystems) equipped with a nitrogen laser operating at 337 nm. In addition, one sample was examined by MS/MS methods using a ThermoFinnigan Atmospheric Pressure MALDI ion trap mass spectrometer. All MALDI-MS results were obtained in the linear positive mode using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (saturated solution in 50% acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) as the UV-absorbing matrix. Analytes were prepared by mixing 1 μl of peptide digest with 1 μl of matrix solution on a MALDI plate and allowed to air dry at room temperature in a hood before inserting into the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. Mass spectra were externally calibrated with des-Arg1-bradykinin (905.05 Da), angiotensin (1297.51 Da), Glu1-fibrinopeptide B (1571.61 Da), and insulin (5733.54 Da). In addition, peptides derived from trypsin (843.02 and 2212.44 Da) were used for validation when clearly observed. All masses are reported as average values. MALDI-TOF mass spectra were analyzed to identify tryptic peptides of the urease proteins, tryptic peptides that reacted with one end of the reagents with the other end being hydrolyzed or reacted with quenching agent, and cross-linked tryptic peptides. Peptides were identified by using the ProteinProspector program 2See prospector.ucsf.edu. to perform theoretical trypsin digests of K. aerogenes urease subunits (UreA, UreB, and UreC) and accessory proteins (UreD and UreF) and searching for potential unmodified tryptic peptides (with up to two missed cleavages) or suspected modified species. Methionine residues were considered as either normal Met or their oxidized form (Met-ox), and cysteine residues were considered to be carbamidomethylated (C-cam) or reacted with acrylamide to produce Cys-S-β-propionamide (C-pam) (36Brune D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 207: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). MALDI-TOF MS Analysis of Untreated Urease-related Proteins—The SDS-PAGE gel-isolated UreC, UreD, and UreF peptides, as well as a mixture of the UreA and UreB peptides, were subjected to trypsin cleavage and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. A representative spectrum for the UreC sample is shown in Fig. 1, and spectra of the remaining samples are provided as supplementary data (see Supplemental Figs. S1–S3). Peaks consistent with the expected peptides are summarized in Table I. For UreA, four peptides (10, 12, 19, and 25 residues) were identified that cover 66 of the total 100 amino acids, accounting for 66% of the sequence. Nine UreB peptides (6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 19, 23, 23, and 27 residues) were represented, covering 91 of the 106 amino acids and accounting for 86% of the sequence. In the case of UreC, the spectrum was consistent with the presence of 14 peptides (7, 7, 10, 14, 14, 16, 17, 19, 22, 22, 26, 27, 28, and 35 residues) covering 237 of 567 amino acids and accounting for 42% of the sequence. The MALDI-TOF spectrum for peptides derived from UreD was less complete with only four clearly identified peptides (9, 12, 13, and 17 residues) covering 51 of 270 amino acids and accounting for 19% of the sequence. Better coverage was observed with UreF where nine peptides (7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, and 22 residues) covered 114 of 224 amino acids and accounted for 50% of the sequence.Table IMALDI MS analysis of tryptic peptides derived from non-cross-linked urease-associated proteinsSampleObserved m/zaValues shown are derived from the UreC sample shown in Fig. 1 and the UreAB, UreD, and UreF samples shown in Supplemental Figs.

The treated samples exhibited decreases in intensity of bands corresponding to the urease-related peptides, the appearance of new bands above UreC, and extensively cross-linked material that barely entered the gel. Whereas BS3-treated UreABC gave rise to two new bands (labeled a and b, faster and slower bands, respectively), the UreABCD sample yielded the same bands as well as a third faint band (labeled c). Gel band a and bands b plus c (because of their proximity) were isolated from BS3-treated UreABCD, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS (Fig. 3 and Table II). Analogous studies were carried out with a mixture of the new bands from the BS3-treated UreABC sample (see Supplemental Table SI). In addition, the remaining UreC bands in the BS3-treated samples (including the UreABCDF sample) were analyzed by protease digestion and MALDI-TOF MS (see Supplemental Table SII).Fig. 3MALDI-TOF MS analysis of tryptic peptides for BS3-cross-linked UreABCD samples.

https://openalex.org/W2020487460,"P-glycoprotein (P-gp; ABCB1) transports a wide variety of structurally diverse compounds out of the cell. The protein has two homologous halves joined by a linker region. Each half consists of a transmembrane (TM) domain with six TM segments and a nucleotide-binding domain. The drug substrate-binding pocket is at the interface between the TM segments in each half of the protein. Preliminary studies suggested that the arrangement of the two halves of P-gp shows rotational symmetry (i.e. “head-to-tail” arrangement). Here, we tested this model by determining whether the cytoplasmic ends of TM2 and TM3 in the N-terminal half are in close contact with TM11 in the C-terminal half. Mutants containing a pair of cysteines in TM2/TM11 or TM3/TM11 were subjected to oxidative cross-linking with copper phenanthroline. Two of the 110 TM2/TM11 mutants, V133C(TM2)/G939C(TM11) and C137C(TM2)/A935C (TM11), were cross-linked at 4 °C, when thermal motion is reduced. Cross-linking was specific since no cross-linked product was detected in the 100 double Cys TM3/TM11 mutants. Vanadate trapping of nucleotide or the presence of some drug substrates inhibited cross-linking of mutants V133C(TM2)/G939C(TM11) and C137C(TM2)/A935C(TM11). Cross-linking of TM2 and TM11 also blocked drug-stimulated ATPase activity. The close proximity of TM2/TM11 and TM5/TM8 (Loo, T. W., Bartlett, M. C., and Clarke, D. M. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 7692–7697) indicates that these regions between the two halves must enclose the drug-binding pocket at the cytoplasmic side of P-gp. They may form the “hinges” required for conformational changes during the transport cycle. P-glycoprotein (P-gp; ABCB1) transports a wide variety of structurally diverse compounds out of the cell.

The human multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein (P-gp 1The abbreviations used are: P-gp, P-glycoprotein; TM, transmembrane (segment); NBD, nucleotide-binding domain; TMD, transmembrane domain; HEK, human embryonic kidney; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate. 1The abbreviations used are: P-gp, P-glycoprotein; TM, transmembrane (segment); NBD, nucleotide-binding domain; TMD, transmembrane domain; HEK, human embryonic kidney; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate.; ABCB1) uses ATP to transport a wide variety of structurally unrelated compounds of different sizes from the cell. The physiological function of P-gp is unknown. It is present in relatively higher levels in some organs such as the intestine, kidney, and blood-brain/testes barrier and therefore may function to protect the organism from toxins in the diet and the environment (1Gottesman M.M. Fojo T. Bates S.E. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 48-58Google Scholar, 2Hrycyna C.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 247-256Google Scholar, 3Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 11-23Google Scholar). Its relatively high expression in these organs can affect the therapeutic efficacy of oral drugs, whereas overexpression of P-gp in some tumor cells can complicate cancer chemotherapy regimens (4Lee C.G.

Cancer Control. 2003; 10: 159-165Google Scholar). P-gp is a member of the ATP-binding cassette family of transporters (6Dean M. Rzhetsky A. Allikmets R. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1156-1166Google Scholar). Its 1280 amino acids are arranged as two homologous halves with 43% amino acid identity. A linker region of ∼60 amino acids connects the two halves of the protein (7Chen C.J. Chin J.E. Ueda K. Clark D.P. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Roninson I.B. Cell. 1986; 47: 381-389Google Scholar). Each half has six transmembrane (TM) segments and a hydrophilic domain containing an ATP-binding site (8Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Google Scholar, 9Kast C. Canfield V. Levenson R. Gros P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9240-9248Google Scholar). The protein functions as a monomer (10Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27488-27492Google Scholar). Each half of P-gp has basal ATPase activity, but drug-stimulated ATPase activity or conferral of drug resistance requires the presence of both halves of the protein (11Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7750-7755Google Scholar). Both nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) are essential for activity (13Azzaria M. Schurr E. Gros P. Mol. Cell.

Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41303-41306Google Scholar). Drug substrates that stimulate or inhibit ATPase activity cause these sequences to come closer or to move farther apart, respectively (17Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1575-1578Google Scholar). The TM segments likely interact with drug substrates in the lipid bilayer (18Homolya L. Hollo Z. Germann U.A. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Sarkadi B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 24759-24765Google Scholar). Drug substrates bind at distinct regions in a common drug-binding pocket that is formed by the interface between the TMDs of both halves of P-gp (21Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31945-31948Google Scholar, 22Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35388-35392Google Scholar, 23Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

Disulfide cross-linking studies and labeling of cysteine mutants with thiol-reactive drug substrates indicate that the two halves are arranged in a “head-to-tail” arrangement (26Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5253-5256Google Scholar), with TM4–6 of TMD1 (the N-terminal TMD containing TM1–6) and TM9–12 of TMD2 (the C-terminal TMD containing TM7–12) forming the drug-binding pocket (25Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44332-44338Google Scholar, 27Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36877-36880Google Scholar). Drug binding involves an induced fit mechanism (28Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13603-13606Google Scholar), and only binding in some orientations can allow for conformational changes to induce ATP hydrolysis (29Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20449-20452Google Scholar, 30Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50136-50141Google Scholar). Therefore, knowledge about the packing of the TM segments between the two halves of P-gp is important for understanding the mechanism of P-gp. The drug-binding pocket is “funnel-shaped,” narrow at the cytoplasmic side and wider at the extracellular end (27Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36877-36880Google Scholar). We recently showed that the homologous halves of P-gp are in close contact at the cytoplasmic ends of TM5 and TM8 (31Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7692-7697Google Scholar). We predicted the presence of another contact point between TM2 or TM3 with TM11 in the two halves of P-gp for the formation of the funnel-shaped drug-binding pocket. In this study, we used cysteine-scanning mutagenesis and disulfide cross-linking analysis to determine the position of the cytoplasmic side of TM11 in TMD2 relative to that of TM2 and TM3 in TMD1. Construction of Mutants—An active Cys-less P-gp was constructed by replacing the seven endogenous cysteines at positions 137, 431, 717, 956, 1074, 1125, and 1227 with alanines (8Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Google Scholar). A 10-histidine tag was attached to the C-terminal end of the Cys-less P-gp cDNA. The presence of a histidine tag facilitates purification of the P-gp mutants by nickel chelate chromatography (32Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Google Scholar). Pairs of cysteines were reintroduced into the histidine-tagged Cys-less P-gp cDNA near the cytoplasmic ends of TM2 (positions 128–138), TM3 (positions 188–197), and TM11 (positions 935–944). Disulfide Cross-linking Analysis—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were transfected with the mutant cDNAs. The medium was replaced with fresh medium after 24 h, and the cells were grown for another 48 h at 27 °C. The cells were harvested and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 10 mm sodium phosphate and 150 mm NaCl), pH 7.4, and the membranes were prepared as described previously (33Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7243-7248Google Scholar). The membranes were suspended in PBS, pH 7.4, and samples were cross-linked by incubation with 1 mm Cu(II)(phenanthroline)3 as the oxidant for various times at 4, 22, or 37 °C as described in the figure legends. To test for the effect of drug substrates on cross-linking, the membranes were preincubated for 10 min at 22 °C in the presence of no drug, 1 mm verapamil, 1 mm demecolcine, 1 mm rhodamine B, 0.5 mm cis-(Z)-flupenthixol, 0.5 mm trans-(E)-flupenthixol, 0.1 mm cyclosporin A, 0.5 mm Hoechst 33342, 0.5 mm progesterone, 5 mm colchicine, or 0.2 mm vinblastine before addition of oxidant for 10 min at 22 °C. To test for the effect of nucleotides or vanadate trapping of nucleotide on cross-linking, the membranes were suspended in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl), pH 7.4. Samples were incubated for 10 min at 22 °C in the presence of 10 mm ATP, 20 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm sodium vanadate. Sodium vanadate was boiled for 3 min to break polymeric species (34Goodno C.C. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 116-123Google Scholar) and chilled in an ice bath before use. A sample of membrane was also incubated for 10 min at 22 °C in the presence of 20 mm MgCl2 with 10 mm ATP, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm ADP, or 10 mm AMP-PNP. The samples were incubated at 22 °C for 10 min before cross-linking at 22 °C for 10 min. The reactions were stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 4% (w/v) SDS) containing 50 mm EDTA and no reducing agent. The reaction mixtures were subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5% polyacrylamide gels) and immunoblot analysis with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against P-gp (35Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21839-21844Google Scholar). Purification and Measurement of Drug-stimulated ATPase Activity of P-gp Mutants—Fifty plates (10-cm diameter) of HEK 293 cells were transfected with mutant cDNA. After 24 h at 37 °C, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 10 μm cyclosporin A. Cyclosporin A, a substrate of P-gp, acts as a potent chemical chaperone in increasing the yield of P-gp by promoting proper folding and packing of the TM segments (12Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24759-24765Google Scholar, 36Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 709-712Google Scholar, 37Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

After another 24 h at 37 °C, the cells were harvested and washed three times with PBS, pH 7.4, and suspended in PBS. The cells were solubilized at 4 °C with 1 volume (0.75 ml) of PBS containing 2% (w/v) n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside. After 15 min at 4 °C, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was passed through a DNA miniprep microcentrifuge column (QIAGEN Inc.) to remove any DNA. The flowthrough material was subjected to nickel chelate chromatography as described previously (32Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Google Scholar). The recovery of P-gp was monitored by immunoblot analysis with rabbit anti-P-gp polyclonal antibody (35Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21839-21844Google Scholar) and enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). An aliquot of the isolated P-gp-His10 was mixed with an equal volume of 10 mg/ml sheep brain phosphatidylethanolamine (Type II-S, Sigma) that had been washed and suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl. The P-gp and lipid mixture was sonicated. A sample of the P-gp/lipid mixture was incubated with an equal volume of ATPase buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ATP, and either no drug substrate or 2 mm verapamil. These concentrations caused maximal stimulation of the ATPase activity of Cys-less P-gp. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and the amount of inorganic phosphate liberated was determined (39Chifflet S. Torriglia A. Chiesa R. Tolosa S. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 1-4Google Scholar). To test for the effect of cross-linking on ATPase activity, membranes were prepared from cells expressing histidine-tagged Cys-less P-gp or mutant C137C(TM2)/A935C(TM11) and treated with or without oxidant at 22 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of EDTA to 1 mm. The membranes were then solubilized by addition of an equal volume of PBS containing 2% (w/v) n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside detergent. The P-gps were isolated by nickel chelate chromatography. The isolated P-gps were mixed with lipid and sonicated, and ATPase assays were performed as described above. The 12 predicted TM segments of P-gp are shown in Fig. 1A. Each TMD contains six TM segments that can interact with each other when expressed as separate polypeptides or when the NBDs are deleted (35Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21839-21844Google Scholar). Cysteine-scanning mutagenesis of the TM segments and reaction of the cysteine mutants with thiol-reactive drug substrates indicate that TM4–6 in the N-terminal half and TM9–12 in the C-terminal half contribute residues to the common drug-binding pocket (25Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44332-44338Google Scholar, 29Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20449-20452Google Scholar, 40Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39706-39710Google Scholar). This pocket is shaped like a funnel, with the narrowest part at the cytoplasmic ends of the TM segments (27Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36877-36880Google Scholar). We recently showed that two halves of P-gp are close together at N296C(TM5)/G774C(TM8), I299C(TM5)/F770C(TM8), I299C(TM5)/G774C (TM8), and G300C(TM5)/F770C(TM8), suggesting that the packing of the two halves shows rotational symmetry (i.e. head-to-tail arrangement) (31Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7692-7697Google Scholar). Since the two halves of P-gp share 43% amino acid identity, we predicted that TM2 and/or TM3 could come into contact with TM11 to complete the narrow part of the funnel (Fig. 1B). Accordingly, we tested this prediction by using cysteine-scanning mutagenesis and oxidative cross-linking analysis. Pairs of cysteines were introduced at the cytoplasmic halves of either TM2 (positions 128–138) or TM3 (positions 188–197) and TM11 (positions 935–944) of the Cysless P-gp mutant. These positions are at the narrowest part of the funnel, and the probability of cross-linking with a zero-length cross-linker (copper phenanthroline) would likely be greatest at these positions. The Cys-less P-gp mutant has been useful in cross-linking experiments because it still confers multidrug resistance in transfected cells (8Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Google Scholar), and the presence of a disulfide bond between the TM segments in the two halves causes the protein to migrate with reduced mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (41Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27482-27487Google Scholar). The 210 double cysteine TM2/TM11 and TM3/TM11 mutants were expressed in HEK 293 cells. Membranes were prepared and treated with oxidant (copper phenanthroline) at 37 °C, and the presence of cross-linked product was detected by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Three of the 110 TM2/TM11 mutants (V133C(TM2)/G939C(TM11), C137C(TM2)/A935C(TM11), and L138C(TM2)/A935C(TM11)) showed relatively strong cross-linking (>50%), whereas 12 mutants (Y130C(TM2)/G939C(TM11), Y130C(TM2)/I940C(TM11), Y130C(TM2)/F942C(TM11), Y130C(TM2)/S943C(TM11), V133C(TM2)/F938C(TM11), V133C(TM2)/F942C(TM11), V133C(TM2)/S943C(TM11), S134C(TM2)/A935C(TM11), S134C(TM2)/H936C(TM11), S134C(TM2)/G939C(TM11), S134C(TM2)/I940C(TM11), and C137C(TM2)/G939C(TM11)) showed relatively weak cross-linking (<50%) (Table I). When cross-linking was carried out at 22 °C, only mutants V133C(TM2)/G939C(TM11), C137C(TM2)/A935C (TM11), and L138C(TM2)/A935C(TM11) formed detectable cross-linked products. Examples of relatively strong cross-linking (mutants V133C(TM2)//G939C(TM11) and C137C(TM2)/A935C(TM11)) are shown in Fig. 2. No cross-linked product was detected when the single cysteine mutants V133C(TM2), G939C(TM11), C137C(TM2), and A935C(M11) were treated with copper phenanthroline. These results indicate that intramolecular cross-linking was responsible for the reduced mobility of the cross-linked product. No cross-linked product was detected in the 100 TM3/TM11 mutants (data not shown).Table ICross-linking between residues in TM2 and TM11TM2TM11A935CH936CI937CF938CG939CI940CT941CF942CS943CF944CA128C----------A129C----------Y130C----++-++-I131C----------Q132C----------V133C---+++, **--++-S134C++--++----F135C----------W136C----------C137C++, **---+-----L138C++, *--------- Open table in a new tab Fig. 2Disulfide cross-linking of P-gp mutants. Membranes were prepared from HEK 293 cells expressing P-gp mutant V133C(TM2), G939C(TM11), C137C(TM2), A935C(TM11), V133C(TM2)/G939C (TM11), or C137C(TM2)/A935C(TM11). The membranes were treated with (+) or without (–) oxidant (copper phenanthroline (CuP)) for 10 min at 37 °C, and the reactions were stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer containing EDTA and no reducing agent.

At 4 °C, time-dependent cross-linking was observed in mutants V133C(TM2)/G939C(TM11) and C137C(TM2)/A935C (TM11), but not in mutant L138C(TM2)/A935C(TM11) even after 32 min (Fig. 3). Therefore, only mutants V133C(TM2)/G939C(TM11) and C137C(TM2)/A935C(TM11) were used for further analysis. To determine whether mutants V133C(TM2)/G939C(TM11) and C137C(TM2)/A935C(TM11) retained activity, we assayed for drug-stimulated ATPase activity. Drug-stimulated ATPase activity is a useful assay because it has been shown that the turnover numbers for transport and drug-stimulated ATPase activity are comparable (42Ambudkar S.V. Cardarelli C.O. Pashinsky I. Stein W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21160-21166Google Scholar). In addition, there is good correlation between drug resistance and ATPase assays (43Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 480-492Google Scholar). Accordingly, histidine-tagged mutants V133C(TM2)/G939C(TM11) and C137C(TM2)/A935C(TM11) were expressed in HEK 293 cells, isolated by nickel chelate chromatography, mixed with lipid, and assayed for verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity. Verapamil was used, as it highly stimulates (>10-fold) the ATPase activity of Cys-less P-gp (17Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1575-1578Google Scholar). Under saturating concentrations of verapamil (1 mm), mutant C137C(TM2)/A935C(TM11) showed about the same amount of ATPase activity as Cys-less P-gp, whereas mutant V133C(TM2)/G939C(TM11) had 70% of the activity of Cys-less P-gp. The foregoing results of cross-linking indicate that TM2 and TM11 are close to each other at their cytoplasmic ends. It is possible that conformational changes between the two TMDs of P-gp are critical for coupling drug binding and/or release to ATP hydrolysis. Accordingly, we tested whether blocking movement between TM2 and TM11 by cross-linking mutant C137C(TM2)/A935C(TM11) affected drug-stimulated ATPase activity. Mutant C137C(TM2)/A935C(TM11) was selected since its verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity was similar to that of Cys-less P-gp. Membranes prepared from HEK 293 cells expressing mutant C137C(TM2)/A935C(TM11) were treated with or without 0.2 mm copper phenanthroline for 15 min at 22 °C, and the reaction was stopped by addition of EDTA to 1 mm.An equal volume of PBS containing 2% (w/v) n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside detergent was added to the treated membranes, and the P-gp mutants were isolated by nickel chelate chromatography. The proteins were mixed with lipid, sonicated, and assayed for verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity. Fig. 4 shows that cross-linking of mutant C137C(TM2)/A935C(TM11) inhibited ATPase activity by 92%, whereas the activity of the Cys-less mutant was relatively unaffected by treatment with oxidant. Therefore, conformational changes or movement between TM2 and TM11 are required for coupling drug binding to ATPase activity. We then tested whether ATPase activity affected the cross-linking pattern of mutants V133C(TM2)/G939C(TM11) and C137C(TM2)/A935C(TM11). P-gp is an interesting ATPase because exposure to vanadate during ATP hydrolysis allows the protein to be trapped in a transition state (15Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19383-19390Google Scholar). Vanadate traps ADP at either NBD by mimicking the transition state of the γ-phosphate of ATP during ATP hydrolysis. Vanadate trapping at one NBD inhibits ATP hydrolysis at the second site (15Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19383-19390Google Scholar). Accordingly, membranes were prepared from HEK 293 cells expressing mutant V133C(TM2)/G939C(TM11) or C137C-(TM2)/A935C(TM11) and preincubated with or without ATP plus vanadate, ATP, vanadate, ADP, or the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP. AMP-PNP was included because it has been reported that the binding of AMP-PNP by P-gp causes large conformational changes in the TMDs (44Rosenberg M.F. Velarde G. Ford R.C. Martin C. Berridge G. Kerr I.D. Callaghan R. Schmidlin A. Wooding C. Linton K.J. Higgins C.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5615-5625Google Scholar). The membranes were treated with oxidant, and the samples were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Fig. 5 shows that vanadate trapping of nucleotide almost completely abolished cross-linking in both mutants. This result indicates that TM2 and TM11 move apart in the transition state. Alternatively, there could be rotation of one or both TM segments. By contrast, the presence of ATP, ADP, vanadate alone, or AMP-PNP did not affect cross-linking of the mutant. The presence of ATP did not inhibit cross-linking probably because the protein only transiently adopts the transition state conformation during ATP hydrolysis. Since cross-linking was not inhibited by AMP-PNP, it appears that occupation of the ATP-binding sites by nucleotides is unlikely to cause large conformational changes between TM2 and TM11. We have shown that residues in TM11 line the drug-binding pocket of P-gp (22Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35388-35392Google Scholar). We then tested whether drug substrates would affect the cross-linking pattern of mutants V133C(TM2)/G939C(TM11) and C137C(TM2)/A935C(TM11). The “substrate-induced” fit mechanism for drug binding (28Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13603-13606Google Scholar) predicts that the packing of the TM segments would be changed by the presence of different drug substrates. Membranes were prepared from HEK 293 cells expressing mutant V133C(TM2)/G939C(TM11) or C137C(TM2)/A935C(TM11) and preincubated with the drug substrates verapamil, demecolcine, rhodamine B, the cis- and trans-isomers of flupenthixol, cyclosporin A, Hoechst 33342, progesterone, colchicine, and vinblastine before cross-linking with oxidant. Verapamil and demecolcine were selected because they highly stimulate P-gp ATPase activity. Rhodamine B, Hoechst 33342, colchicine, and vinblastine are commonly used P-gp substrates, whereas the isomers of flupenthixol, cyclosporin A, and progesterone are P-gp modulators. Fig. 6 shows that cross-linking was not significantly inhibited (<25% change) in the presence of verapamil, demecolcine, cyclosporin A, progesterone, or colchicine in either mutant. The cross-linking of both mutants, however, was inhibited by the presence of rhodamine B. Three differences were observed in the presence of the isomers of flupenthixol (∼2–4-fold reduction in cross-linking), Hoechst 33342, or vinblastine. Mutant V133C(TM2)/G939C(TM11) was protected from cross-linking by Hoechst 33342, vinblastine, or the isomers of flupenthixol, whereas mutant C137C(TM2)/A935C(TM11) was not. These results suggest that Hoechst 33342, vinblastine, or the isomers of flupenthixol induced a conformational change that moved Cys133 in TM2 and Cys939 in TM11 far enough apart to inhibit cross-linking. Cys137 in TM2 and Cys935 in TM11 remained close enough to be cross-linked because they are closer to the cytoplasmic ends of the helices. When the sequences of the homologous halves of P-gp are compared, Val133 in TM2 corresponds to Gly774 in TM8, whereas Gly939 in TM11 corresponds to Asn296 in TM5 (Fig. 7A). This is interesting because both mutants V133C(TM2)/G939C(TM11) (this study) and N296C(TM5)/G774C(TM8) (31Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7692-7697Google Scholar) were cross-linked. Therefore, we tested the effects of drug substrates on the cross-linking pattern of mutant N296C(TM5)/G774C(TM8). Some differences were observed when the mutants were compared. Cross-linking of mutant V133C(TM2)/G939C(TM11), but not mutant N296C(TM5)/G77C(TM8), was inhibited by Hoechst 33342 and vinblastine. Progesterone inhibited some cross-linking in mutant N296C(TM5)/G774C(TM8) (∼50% decrease), but not in mutant V133C(TM2)/G939C(TM11) (Fig. 6). Although the cross-linkable sites are located at equivalent positions in a rotational symmetry (head-to-tail arrangement) of the TM segments in the two halves, the same drugs induced different conformational changes at both sites.Fig. 7Model of interaction between TM2 and TM11. A, the residues of homologous TM segments in each half of P-gp are aligned: TM5 (Ala311–Thr294) and TM11 (Ala954–Ile937); and TM2 (Tyr118–Phe135) and TM8 (Phe759–Thr776). Residues that occupy equivalent positions in the TM segments and that are cross-linked (V133C(TM2)/G939C(TM11) and N296C(TM5)/G774C(TM8), respectively) are boxed. B, TM2 and TM11 are shown as α-helices, with the amino acid positions shown as white circles. The lines between the residues in TM2 and TM11 represent positions that, when mutated to cysteine, will cross-link when treated with oxidant at 4 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In our original model of TM segment packing, we predicted that each TMD lined one side of the drug-binding pocket (26Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5253-5256Google Scholar). The TM segments in each TMD were in a linear head-to-tail arrangement such that TM1 was close to TM12, whereas TM6 was close to TM7. This arrangement of the TM segments resulted in rotational symmetry around the drug-binding pocket (26Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5253-5256Google Scholar). The recent crystal structure of the related MsbA lipid A half-transporter from Escherichia coli (45Chang G. Roth C.B. Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Google Scholar) and Vibrio cholera (46Chang G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 419-430Google Scholar) indicates that the TM segments in their TMD are not arranged in a linear order. If P-gp showed a similar organization, then TM5 and TM2 in the N-terminal half would lie close to TM8 and TM11 in the C-terminal half of P-gp, respectively (Fig. 1B). In a previous study, we showed that the TM5/TM8 (but not TM6/TM8 and TM6/TM7) cytoplasmic ends are indeed close together (31Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7692-7697Google Scholar). In this study, cross-linking analysis of the residues on the cytoplasmic side of TM2 or TM3 and TM11 indicated that TM2 in TMD1 is in close proximity to TM11 in TMD2. Two mutants, V133C(TM2)/G939C(TM11) and C137C(TM2)/A935C(TM11), were particularly interesting because they were cross-linked at 4 °C, when molecular motion is low. Copper phenanthroline is very efficient in promoting the formation of the disulfide bond between thiol groups if their β-carbons are a maximal distance of 7 Å from each other, with the average being 5–6 Å, or when the sulfhydryl groups are brought close together transiently because of molecular motion (47Katz B.A. Kossiakoff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15480-15485Google Scholar). This would account for the large number of mutants that were cross-linked at 37 °C (Table I). The observation that Cys133 and Cys137 in TM2 can form disulfide bonds with Cys935 and Cys939 in TM11, respectively, in the presence of oxidant at 4 °C suggests that these residues are within 5 Å of each other. When the residues in TM2 and TM11 are modeled as α-helices (Fig. 7B), the predicted locations of residues 133 and 137 in TM2 and residues 935 and 939 in TM11 are consistent with the experimental results. Residues 133 and 137 are predicted to lie on one face of the helix, whereas residues 935 and 939 are separated by one turn of the helix, but are on the same face of TM11. These results, as well as those from previous cross-linking studies (26Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5253-5256Google Scholar, 31Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7692-7697Google Scholar), indicate that the two TMDs are in close proximity at the cytoplasmic side (Fig. 1B). This arrangement of the P-gp TMDs is incompatible with the E. coli MsbA crystal structure (45Chang G. Roth C.B. Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Google Scholar) and with the P-gp model proposed by Seigneuret and Garnier-Suillerot (48Seigneuret M. Garnier-Suillerot A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30115-30124Google Scholar). In both structures, the TMDs are arranged such that they are close at the extracellular ends, whereas the cytoplasmic ends of the TMDs as well as the NBDs are relatively far apart. In contrast, a projection structure of P-gp in a lipid bilayer shows that the protein adopts a more compact structure, with the two NBDs close together (49Lee J.Y. Urbatsch I.L. Senior A.E. Wilkens S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40125-40131Google Scholar). Such a structure would also bring the cytoplasmic ends of the TMDs close together. Indeed, cross-linking analysis of the NBDs shows that the Walker A consensus sequence in one NBD is close to the LSGGQ sequence in the other NBD (16Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41303-41306Google Scholar). A compact P-gp structure in which the two NBDs and the cytoplasmic ends of the two TMDs are close together is more consistent with the V. cholera MsbA structure (46Chang G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 419-430Google Scholar). Recently, Stenham et al. (50Stenham D.R. Campbell J.D. Sansom M.S. Higgins C.F. Kerr I.D. Linton K.J. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 2287-2289Google Scholar) proposed two detailed models of P-gp founded on disulfide cross-linking studies and homology modeling based on the E. coli MsbA structure. Both models incorporated the idea that the two NBDs form a consensus interface (16Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41303-41306Google Scholar, 51Hopfner K.P. Karcher A.

Cell. 2002; 10: 139-149Google Scholar), but greatly differed in their TMD1/TMD2 interfaces. The first model maintained the NBD/TMD interface as seen with E. coli MsbA. In the second model, the NBDs were rotated with respect to their cognate TMDs. The second model was found to be more compatible with our cross-linking data (26Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5253-5256Google Scholar, 27Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36877-36880Google Scholar, 53Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20986-20989Google Scholar, 54Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3511-3516Google Scholar). The authors also cross-linked residues at the extracellular ends of TM2, TM5, TM8, and TM11 with linkers of 6–16 Å at 37 °C. They showed cross-linking between TM5 and TM8 and between TM2 and TM11. Our results showing cross-linking between the cytoplasmic ends of TM5 and TM8 (31Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7692-7697Google Scholar) and between TM2 and TM11 (this study) are consistent with the second model. The contact points between V133C(TM2)/G939C(TM11) and C137C(TM2)/A935C(TM11) are not static, but appear to undergo considerable motion during the transport cycle. Conformational changes at the TM2/TM11 interface appear to be an important requirement during the transport cycle because cross-linking inhibited ATPase activity. The orientations of TM2 and TM11 were sensitive to ATP hydrolysis, as vanadate trapping of nucleotide inhibited cross-linking of both mutants V133C(TM2)/G939C(TM11) and C137C(TM2)/A935C(TM11). Nucleotide binding alone was not sufficient to block cross-linking since no detectable reduction in cross-linking was observed in the presence of ATP, ADP, or AMP-PNP. Conformational changes were also observed with some substrates. Some substrates such as rhodamine B inhibited cross-linking of both mutants V133C(TM2)/G939C(TM11) and C137C(TM2)/A935C(TM11). Perhaps binding of rhodamine B caused TM2 and TM11 to move apart. Alternatively, binding of rhodamine B may have caused at least one of the TM segments to rotate in P-gp (28Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13603-13606Google Scholar, 40Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39706-39710Google Scholar, 55Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31800-31805Google Scholar). Other drug substrates such as Hoechst 33342 and vinblastine inhibited cross-linking of only mutant V133C(TM2)/G939C(TM11). Residues 133 and 939 are predicted to be closer to the middle of the lipid bilayer. This may explain why mutant V133C(TM2)/G939C(TM11), but not mutant C137C(TM2)/A935C(TM11), was inhibited. Hoechst 33342 or vinblastine may induce a “hinge-like” motion at TM2 and TM11 so that only the extracellular ends of these TM segments move farther apart. Not all drug substrates inhibited cross-linking. No detectable effect on cross-linking was observed with drug substrates such as verapamil, demecolcine, cyclosporin A, and colchicine (Fig. 6). The observation that different drug substrates have different effects on cross-linking would be consistent with the idea of the substrate-induced fit mechanism for drug binding (28Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13603-13606Google Scholar). In this mechanism, packing of the TM segments is rearranged when P-gp binds to a particular drug substrate. In summary, the close proximity of TM2 and TM11 is consistent with models of P-gp that place the cytoplasmic ends of the TMDs as well as the NBDs close together (Fig. 1B). The conformational sensitivity of the TM2/TM11 and TM5/TM8 interfaces to ATP hydrolysis and drug binding suggests that these regions of the drug-binding pocket may form hinges that allow conformation changes to occur during the transport cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2090638971,"Post-transcriptional mechanisms play a major role in regulating luteinizing hormone (LH) receptor mRNA expression in the ovary. An ovarian cytosolic protein that we have identified in rats and humans, which binds to a polypyrimidine-rich bipartitate sequence in the coding region of LHR mRNA, acts as a trans-acting factor in this process. In the present study, we isolated and characterized this LH receptor mRNA-binding protein (LRBP) from rat ovary. LRBP was purified to homogeneity by cation exchange chromatography followed by Northwestern analysis and subsequent elution of the single protein band from SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Purified LRBP was subjected to N-terminal microsequencing followed by homology search, which revealed its identity as mevalonate kinase. Purified rat mevalonate kinase antibody recognized the gel-purified LRBP on Western blots performed with one- and two-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gels. When recombinant mevalonate kinase produced in human embryonic kidney cells (293 cells) was tested, it showed all of the characteristics of LRBP with respect to specificity of LHR mRNA binding sequence, as examined by gel mobility shift analysis. Inhibition of LHR mRNA binding activity of mevalonate kinase in the presence of ATP and mevalonate indicates that the RNA recognition site of mevalonate kinase might involve the ATP/mevalonate binding region of the protein. Treatment of 293 cells with mevastatin to deplete cellular mevalonate resulted in an increase in LHR mRNA binding activity of mevalonate kinase. Collectively, the data support the novel function of rat mevalonate kinase as a LHR mRNA-binding protein in the post-transcriptional regulation of LH receptor expression in the ovary.

Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 461-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In the ovary, luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR), a member of Gs-protein coupled receptors, regulates ovarian function mainly through increased production of cAMP (2Menon K.M.J. Gunaga K. Fertil. Steril. 1974; 25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Ascoli M. Fanelli F. Segaloff D. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 141-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 4McFarland K.C. Sprengel R.

The cell surface expression of LHR varies during different stages of the ovarian cycle. Its expression in granulosa cells and luteal cells is greatly decreased by an endogenous preovulatory LH surge or by the administration of a pharmacological dose of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a placental counterpart of LH (5Lapolt P.S. Oikawa M. Jia X.C. Dargan C. Hsueh A.J. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 3277-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 6Hoffman Y.M. Peegel H. Sprock M.J. Zang Q.Y. Menon K.M.J.

Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We have shown that the decline in cell surface LHR expression seen after hCG administration is paralleled by a specific loss of all four LHR mRNA transcripts (6.7, 4.4, 2.6, and 1.8 kb) in the ovary (9Kash J.C. Menon K.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10658-10664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the loss of LHR mRNA does not result from decreased transcription but occurs post-transcriptionally with a 3-fold decrease in half-life (8Lu D.L. Peegel H. Mosier S.M. Menon K.M.J. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Regulation of mRNA turnover is one of the major control mechanisms of gene expression in all organisms. mRNA half-lives are influenced by the interaction of various cytoplasmic proteins (trans-acting factors) with regulatory regions (cis-acting elements) in the mRNA, forming ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes (10Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The formation and disruption of RNP complexes in response to various cellular stimuli mainly controls the turnover of cytoplasmic mRNA. Studies have indicated the presence of cis-acting regulatory elements in the 5′-untranslated region, coding region, and 3′-untranslated region of mRNA (10Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A number of cytoplasmic trans-acting factors, some of which shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm, have been identified as mRNA-stabilizing, destabilizing, or translational repressor proteins (11Peng S.S.-Y.

We have identified a LHR mRNA-binding protein in rat and human ovary, designated as LRBP, which binds to a polypyrimidine-rich bipartite sequence in the coding region of LHR mRNA with high affinity (25Kash J.C. Menon K.M.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16889-16897Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Further studies have demonstrated that in an in vitro reconstituted mRNA decay system, the addition of partially purified LRBP caused accelerated degradation of LHR mRNA (26Nair A.K. Kash J.C. Peegel H. Menon K.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21468-21473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have purified the LHR mRNA-binding protein from rat ovaries, established its identity as mevalonate kinase by N-terminal microsequencing, and subsequently cloned and characterized the expressed protein in 293 cells. We also show that the LHR mRNA binding activity of mevalonate kinase is inhibited by its substrates, mevalonate and ATP, in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, depletion of cellular levels of mevalonate resulted in increased binding of LRBP to LH receptor mRNA.

This antibody was raised against the first 15 amino acids of the amino-terminal portion of rat mevalonate kinase (NH2-MLSEVLLVSAPGKVI-COOH). Protein A/G-agarose beads were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and the ECL kit were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. BCA reagent was from Pierce. dl-Mevalonic acid lactone and mevastatin were obtained from Sigma. Mevalonic acid lactone was converted to potassium mevalonate by incubation with 5% molar excess of KOH at 38 °C for 1 h and adjusting the pH to 7.8 and storing at -20 C. Animals and Tissues—21-day-old Sprague-Dawley female rats were given subcutaneous injections of 50 IU of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin followed by 25 IU of hCG 56 h later to induce pseudopregnancy. The day of hCG injection was taken as day 0. LH receptor down-regulation was induced by the subcutaneous administration of 50 IU of hCG on the fifth day of pseudopregnancy. Ovaries were collected 12 h after hCG injection and were processed immediately for LRBP purification. Partial Purification of LRBP—LRBP from rat ovary was partially purified as described previously (26Nair A.K. Kash J.C. Peegel H. Menon K.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21468-21473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Ovaries were homogenized in buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol) containing 50 mm KCl and protease inhibitor mixture at 4 °C. The homogenate was centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing the cytoplasmic proteins (S100) was collected and applied to a strong cation exchange column (Macro-Prep High S Support) equilibrated with Buffer A containing 50 mm KCl. The column was washed with buffer A containing 50 mm KCl until the absorbance at 280 nm was less than 0.02. The proteins were then eluted with Buffer A containing 150 mm KCl and desalted to 50 mm KCl using CentriconYM-10 microconcentrators. The protein concentration was determined by BCA. Elution and Renaturation of Proteins from SDS-PAGE—LHR mRNA-binding protein (LRBP) was eluted from SDS-polyacrylamide gel and renatured according to the method developed by Ossipow et al. (28Ossipow V. Laemmli U.K. Schibler U. Nucleic Acid Res. 1993; 21: 6040-6041Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) with a minor modification. Partially purified LRBP preparation was treated with SDS-sample buffer at 37 °C for 10 min and separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under constant voltage of 150. The gel strips containing the fractionated proteins were cut with a razor blade and placed in separate 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. The gel pieces were then homogenized in elution-renaturation buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol) with a Teflon pestle and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. After incubation, the samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5-10 min at 4 °C to sediment the residual polyacrylamide. The supernatants containing the proteins were collected and were then buffer-exchanged with buffer A containing 50 mm KCl (as described above) to remove Triton X-100 and concentrated using Microcon centrifugal filter devices as described by the manufacturer. Northwestern Analysis—Northwestern analysis was performed as described by Holick and Liebhaber (29Holcik M. Liebhaber S.A. Richter J.D. mRNA Formation and Function. Academic Press, Inc., New York1997: 195-209Crossref Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic proteins (S100) from LHR down-regulated rat ovaries and partially purified LRBP were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE under constant voltage (100 V for stacking gel and 120 V for separating gel). The proteins were then electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane using 50 mm Tris buffer containing 14.5 mm glycine and 20% methanol, at a constant current of 150 mA for 1 h. After electroblotting, the membrane was briefly rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline followed by a 2-h incubation in renaturing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA pH 8.0, 1× Denhardt's solution, 1 mm dithiothreitol) at room temperature with gentle shaking for renaturation of proteins. The blot was overlaid with the 32P-labeled LRBP binding sequence (LBS) of LHR mRNA (∼50,000 cpm/ml) in hybridization buffer (renaturing buffer containing 20 μg/ml tRNA and 5 μg/ml heparin) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with gentle rocking. The membrane was then washed three times (5-10 min each) in renaturation buffer until the background signal was low. The blot was air-dried, wrapped in plastic wrap, and exposed to x-ray film. Templates for in Vitro Transcription—The pBluescript II SK+ vector containing 2.1-kb LHR cDNA was used to generate the full-length LHR mRNA as described before (26Nair A.K. Kash J.C. Peegel H. Menon K.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21468-21473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The cDNAs for generating the wild type and mutant LBSs of LHR mRNA were chemically synthesized with T7 RNA polymerase promoter at the 5′ end. The 304-bp mouse β-actin antisense RNA probe (250-bp KpnI-XbaI fragment) was generated using the pTRI-actin-mouse template that was supplied with the MAXIscript T7 in vitro transcription kit. In Vitro Transcription—[α-32P]UTP-labeled and unlabeled RNAs were in vitro transcribed from linearized cDNA templates using Ambion in vitro transcription kits. The full-length capped LHR mRNA was synthesized using the mMessage mMachine kit. The wild type LBS, mutant LBS, and β-actin antisense RNAs were generated using the MAXIscript kit. The radiolabeled RNAs were prepared using 100 μCi of [α-32P]UTP in the reaction mixture. After transcription, the RNAs were treated with RNase-free DNase I and extracted with nuclease-free water-saturated phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (50:49:1). Unincorporated nucleotides were removed using Quick spin columns (G-50 Sephadex). The RNA was precipitated with equal volume of isopropyl alcohol at -20 °C. Precipitated RNA was washed two times with 75% ethanol, air-dried, and dissolved in nuclease-free water. Both radiolabeled and unlabeled RNAs were quantitated spectrophotometrically at 260 nm. RNA Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Analysis—RNA electrophoretic mobility shift analysis (REMSA) was performed as described previously (9Kash J.C. Menon K.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10658-10664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein samples were incubated with 1 × 105 cpm of radiolabeled RNA in homogenization buffer A (as described above) in the presence of 5 μg of tRNA and 40 units of RNasin at 30 °C for 20 min. Unprotected radiolabeled RNA was then degraded by the addition of 20 units of RNase T1 at 37 °C for 30 min. For competition, the unlabeled RNAs were included in the binding reaction in molar/mass excess as indicated in the figure legends. Samples were then incubated with heparin at a final concentration of 5 mg/ml for 10 min on ice to decrease nonspecific binding. The RNA-protein complexes were resolved by 5% native polyacrylamide (70:1) gel electrophoresis at 4 °C. The gel was then dried and exposed to Eastman Kodak Co. X-Omat AR film and visualized by autoradiography. RNA supershift analysis was performed by adding the antibodies to the binding reaction after the RNP complex formation and incubating the reaction mixture at room temperature for 30 min. The complexes were then resolved on a nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide (70:1) gel. Competition with ATP, UTP, and mevalonate was performed with overexpressed mevalonate kinase from 293 cells by including ATP, UTP, and mevalonate in the binding reaction in molar levels as indicated in the figure legends. Immunodepletion of Mevalonate Kinase from Partially Purified LRBP—Partially purified LRBP preparation was incubated with specific antibody for rat mevalonate kinase or nonspecific antibody for high density lipoprotein-binding protein (HBP) for 2 h in an end-over-end shaker at 4 °C. Protein A/G-agarose beads were then added, and incubation was continued for 2 h. The reaction mixtures were centrifuged, and the supernatants were then collected. Protein concentrations were determined by BCA. The immunodepleted preparations were then used for RNA electrophoretic mobility shift analysis. Construction of Expression Plasmid for Rat Mevalonate Kinase— Rats were treated with hCG to down-regulate LHR mRNA and to maximize the expression of LHR mRNA binding protein as described previously (26Nair A.K. Kash J.C. Peegel H. Menon K.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21468-21473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from ovaries by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63149) Google Scholar), and the concentration was determined by measuring absorbance at 260 nm. The mevalonate kinase cDNA was generated using the SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR with PLATINUM Taq system. The oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by Invitrogen, and their sequences were as follows (the underlined bases are not part of the target gene sequence and represent unique restriction enzyme digestion sites for cloning into pCMV4 mammalian expression vector): sense primer 5′-CGGGGTACCTCAGGAGCCATGTTGTCAGAAGTCCTG-3′; and antisense primer 5′-CCATCGATGTCAGAGGCCCAGGGCTTGTCGGACAGG-3′. The reaction was performed in a final volume of 50 μl as described by the manufacturer using PTC-100 programmable thermal cycler (MJ Research Inc.). The reaction conditions were as follows: reverse transcriptase reaction (one cycle), 50 °C for 30 min and 94 °C for 2 min; PCR amplification (40 cycles), denaturation at 94 °C for 15 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and extension at 68 °C for 2 min; and final extension (one cycle) at 72 °C for 10 min. The reverse transcriptase-PCR product was resolved on a 0.8% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. The gel containing the mevalonate kinase (MVK) cDNA was then excised and eluted using Ultrafree-DA kit. The sequence of the MVK DNA was confirmed by sequencing at the Biomedical Sequencing Core facility at this university. It was cloned into the KpnI/ClaI site of the mammalian expression vector pCMV4 (31Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlback H. Jornvall H. Russel D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of Rat Mevalonate Kinase in 293 Cells—Human embryonic kidney cells (293 cells) were transfected with mevalonate kinase DNA cloned into the pCMV4 vector using Fugene 6 reagent as described by the manufacturer. Cells were collected 24 and 48 h after transfection, and the cytoplasmic proteins (S100) were prepared as described before (9Kash J.C. Menon K.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10658-10664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The S100 fractions were then analyzed for mevalonate kinase by Western blot analysis, and the RNA binding activity was determined by RNA electrophoretic mobility shift analysis. Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane using 25 mm Tris buffer containing 192 mm glycine and 20% methanol (pH 8.3) for 1 h at 4 °C. The nitrocellulose membrane was immersed in 5% nonfat dried milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 overnight at 4 °C. Rat mevalonate kinase was detected using a rabbit polyclonal anti-N-terminal rat mevalonate kinase IgG preparation (40 μg/ml) together with a polyclonal donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000) as a second antibody. The presence of immune complexes was detected by chemiluminescence using an ECL kit. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—The two-dimensional electrophoresis was performed at the University of Michigan protein structure core facility. The solubilized proteins were subjected to isoelectric focusing from pH 3 to 10 using Amersham Biosciences gel strips. The second dimensional electrophoresis was performed using precast 4-12% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were silver-stained for the detection of proteins. Purification of LRBP from Rat Ovary—The rat ovarian cytosolic protein LRBP was initially partially purified using a strong cation exchange column as described before (25Kash J.C. Menon K.M.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16889-16897Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Equivalent quantities of partially purified LRBP and total ovarian cytosolic protein (S100 fraction) were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose. Northwestern analysis was then performed using 32P-labeled LBS of LHR mRNA (25Kash J.C. Menon K.M.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16889-16897Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) as described under “Materials and Methods.” The Northwestern blot showed a single band (∼40 kDa) for both S100 and partially purified LRBP as shown in Fig. 1a. The intensity of the band produced by the partially purified LRBP was stronger than the band produced by crude S100 preparation, indicating that enrichment of LRBP was achieved upon purification through the cation exchange column. The protein(s) that yielded a band in the Northwestern analysis was subsequently eluted from the SDS-polyacrylamide gel and renatured as described under “Materials and Methods.” The eluted protein(s) was then tested for LHR mRNA binding activity by REMSA using 32P-labeled LBS. The eluted protein(s) exhibited LHR mRNA binding activity as shown in Fig. 1b. In order to examine the homogeneity of the extracted protein(s), an aliquot was subjected to one-dimensional and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The Coomassie Blue-stained one-dimensional SDS-PAGE showed only a single band as shown in Fig. 2, and the silver-stained two-dimensional gel showed two spots (Fig. 3) migrating very close to each other, suggesting that both spots most likely represent the same protein. The eluted protein(s) was then subjected to N-terminal sequence analysis for the first 10 amino acids. The resulting sequence (NH2-MLSEVLLVSA-COOH) was then used for a homology search in the Swiss protein sequence data bank. The amino-terminal analysis was performed with purified protein from three separate purifications, and they repeatedly yielded the same sequence data. The homology search revealed the LHR mRNA-binding protein identity to be rat mevalonate kinase (accession number Q03426) (32Tanaka R.D. Lee L.Y. Schafer B.L. Kratunis V.J. Mohler W.A. Robinson G.W.

Since the two-dimensional electrophoresis of the gel-extracted protein(s) showed two spots (Fig. 3), further analysis was carried out to determine the identity of these spots by Western blot analysis. The result is shown in Fig. 4b. The mevalonate kinase antibody reacted with both spots on the two-dimensional gel, thus establishing the identity of both spots to be mevalonate kinase. In order to establish that the protein that binds to LHR mRNA in the partially purified LRBP preparation was mevalonate kinase, gel retardation assays were performed with the addition of rat mevalonate kinase antibody as described under “Materials and Methods.” As shown in Fig. 5, inclusion of the antibody in the binding reaction abolished the RNP complex formation, further establishing the identity of LRBP as mevalonate kinase. RNP complex formation was not abolished when mevalonate kinase antibody preincubated with partially purified LRBP for 30 min at room temperature was added to the binding reaction (Fig. 5b). The purpose of preincubating the mevalonate kinase antibody with partially purified LRBP prior to inclusion in the binding reaction was to block the mevalonate kinase binding sites on the antibody. Similarly, a gel retardation assay performed with an irrelevant antibody (antibody against HBP) also did not cause a decrease in RNP complex formation (Fig. 5b). To further establish the identity of LRBP as mevalonate kinase, a partially purified LRBP preparation was immunodepleted of mevalonate kinase with its antibody using agarose-protein A/G beads as described under “Materials and Methods.” This mevalonate kinase-depleted LRBP preparation was then used for the REMSA. As shown in Fig. 6, a and b, the mevalonate kinase-depleted preparation showed no detectable LHR mRNA binding activity when compared with the LRBP preparation treated with an equal concentration of an irrelevant antibody (HBP antibody) or agarose-protein A/G beads alone. This observation further confirmed the"

Here we found that a mutation in the S4-S5 linker of HCN2 (Y331D) produced an additional mixed cationic instantaneous current. However, this current was inhibited by external Cs+ like If and unlike Iinst. Together with a concomitant reduction in If, the data suggest that the Y331D mutation disrupted channel closing placing the channel in a “If -like,” and not an “Iinst-like,” state. The “If-like” instantaneous current represented ∼70% of total If over voltages ranging from +20 to -150 mV in high K+ solutions. If activated at more depolarized potentials and the activation curve was less steep, whereas deactivation was significantly slowed, consistent with the idea that the mutation inhibited channel closing. The data suggest that the mutation produced allosteric effects on the activation gate (S6 segment) and/or on voltage-sensing elements. We also found that decreases in the ratio of external K+/Na+ further disrupted channel closing in the mutant channel. Finally, our data suggest that the structures involved in producing Iinst are similar between the HCN1 and HCN2 isoforms and that excess HCN protein on the plasma membrane of CHO cells relative to native cells is not responsible for Iinst.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11277-11282Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We recently described a mixed cation instantaneous current, which we refer to as “Iinst,” that appeared in addition to If when the HCN2 isoform was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (11Proenza C. Angoli D. Agranovich E. Macri V. Accili E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5101-5109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Mutations that reduced or eliminated the trafficking of HCN2 to the plasma membrane also reduced or eliminated Iinst associated with HCN2 expression (12Proenza C. Tran N. Angoli D. Zahynacz K.

J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43588-43592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the overexpression of a protein, with a single transmembrane segment and found on the plasma membrane, did not produce Iinst. Finally, we found that the amplitudes of Iinst and If were directly correlated. Thus, Iinst was not simply the result of overexpression of protein but was correlated specifically with the amount of HCN protein expressed on the plasma membrane. We subsequently examined the role of the selectivity filter and the positively charged S4 region in producing Iinst. This current was not affected by a mutation in the selectivity filter (HCN2 G404S), extracellular perfusion of Cs+, or a mutation in the S4 segment (S306Q) unlike If, which was reduced or eliminated by these mutations as well as by Cs+ (14Macri V. Proenza C. Agranovich E. Angoli D. Accili E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35939-35946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Finally, the amplitude of Iinst, but not If, could be predicted on the basis of independent flow of Na+ and K+. Thus, If and Iinst were both mixed cation conductances, but these could be structurally and functionally separated. These results leave open the question of whether the Cs+-insensitive Iinst flows through the same pore as If (for example through a “leaky” closed state) or whether it flows through a second pore that is found within the same channel, formed by a second configuration of HCN channel subunits or associated with HCN channels in the form of up-regulated endogenous channels or subunits. In the present study, we continued to examine regions of HCN channels potentially involved in regulating Iinst in order to understand how this current is generated. A recent study has shown that mutations of residue Tyr331 of the S4-S5 linker in HCN2 produced large instantaneous currents and reduced If, suggesting a disruption of channel closure (10Chen J. Mitcheson J.S. Tristani-Firouzi M. Lin M. Sanguinetti M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11277-11282Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, the nature of the instantaneous currents was not determined in those studies, and thus it was not clear whether the up-regulated current had properties which were similar to Iinst or If. Here, we found that Y331D up-regulated an instantaneous current when expressed in CHO cells, but its properties were more like If than like Iinst. We also found that If amplitude was reduced, the activation curve of the remaining If was shifted to more positive voltages and was less steep, and If deactivation was slowed in the mutant channel. Together, the data support the idea that the Y331D mutation disrupted channel closing through local allosteric effects on the activation gate (S6 segment) and/or on the voltage-sensing elements. Interestingly, our data also suggest that decreasing the ratio of external K+versus Na+ further disrupted the closing of the mutant channel possibly through a separate “foot in the door” mechanism. Finally, we found that the HCN1 isoform, when expressed on the plasma membrane of CHO cells in amounts similar to native HCN channels, produced Iinst, which was proportional in size to If. These data suggest that the structural elements involved in producing Iinst are similar between HCN1 and HCN2 and that excess expression of HCN subunits on the plasma membrane of CHO cells, relative to native cells, is not responsible for producing Iinst. The data are consistent with Iinst flowing through a leaky closed state but do not rule out flow through a second configuration of recombinant HCN channels or up-regulated endogenous channels/subunits. Mutagenesis and Expression—The Y331D mutant was constructed by overlapping PCR mutagenesis from a mouse HCN2 template as previously described (14Macri V. Proenza C. Agranovich E. Angoli D. Accili E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35939-35946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The amplified mutagenic product and wild-type mHCN2, in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (8Ludwig A. Zong X. Jeglitsch M. Hofmann F. Biel M. Nature. 1998; 393: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar), were subsequently digested using NheI and BlpI. The fragment digested out of wild-type mHCN2 was replaced by the complementary fragment carrying the mutation. The mutation was confirmed by restriction analysis and automated sequencing (The Centre for Molecular Medicine and Therapeutics, DNA Sequencing Core Facility, BC Children's and Women's Hospital, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada). Tissue Culture—CHO-K1 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA), maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with antibiotics and 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were plated onto glass coverslips and 1 day after splitting were transiently co-transfected with mammalian expression vectors encoding wild-type and/or mutant mHCN2 channels (2 μg/35-mm dish) along with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter plasmid (0.3 μg/dish) using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Electrophysiology and Analysis—Cells expressing GFP were chosen for whole-cell recordings 24-48 h after transfection or co-transfection with mHCN2 and mHCN1 constructs. The pipette solution contained 130 mm potassium aspartate, 10 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.4 with KOH. The extracellular solution contained varying concentrations of NaCl, KCl, and NMG (see figure legends for each experimental condition), 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. For solution changes, a 200-μl bath was completely exchanged and perfused (0.5-1 ml/min) for at least 1 min prior to collecting data. Whole-cell patch clamp currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200B amplifier and Clampex software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) at room temperature (20-22 °C). Currents were not leak-subtracted, and capacitance compensation was not used. Patch clamp pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass and were fire-polished before use (pipette resistance is 2.5-4.5 megaohms). Data were filtered at 2 kHz and were analyzed using Clampfit (Axon Instruments), Origin (Microcal, Northampton, MA) and Excel (Microsoft, Seattle, WA) software. Current densities were determined by dividing measured currents by the capacitance, which was estimated by the ClampEx software from the time constant of the current elicited by a 2-mV test pulse at the beginning of whole-cell recording. In order to determine the voltage dependence of block by Cs+ of instantaneous current in cells expressing HCN2 Y331D (15Moroni A. Barbuti A. Altomare C. Viscomi C. Morgan J. Baruscotti M. DiFrancesco D. Pflugers Arch. 2000; 439: 618-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the following equation was used, ICsI=(ko/[Cs])exp[δV/(RT/F)]1+(ko/[Cs])exp[δV/(RT/F)](Eq. 1) where I and ICs represent the HCN2 Y331D instantaneous current in control conditions and after Cs+, [Cs] is Cs+ concentration (2 mm), ko is the dissociation constant of Cs+ binding to the block site at zero voltage, and δ is the “electrical” distance of the block site from the external membrane surface. Equation 1 was used to the fit the data in Fig. 6, A and C, and values for ko and δ were obtained (see legend to Fig. 6). χ2 values were also obtained, indicating how well the points were fit. This analysis was also used to examine Cs+ block of If in CHO cells expressing wild-type HCN2. The voltage dependence of activation for HCN2 and HCN2 Y331D were determined by tail currents generated at -30 mV (see Fig. 7 for voltage protocol) with the tail current amplitudes normalized and plotted as a function of test potential. The values were fit with a Boltzmann function, f(V)=Imax/(1+e(V1/2-V)/k)(Eq. 2) to determine the midpoint of activation (V) and the slope factor (k). To assess rates of If activation and deactivation, time constants were generated using a single exponential fitting procedure. An initial delay occurred prior to both activation and deactivation, which was not well described by a single exponential function and therefore was not used in our fits. Student's paired or unpaired t test was used to determine significance when comparisons were made between groups of cells (p < 0.05). Immunocytochemistry and Confocal Microscopy—At 24-48 h post-transfection, cells on coverslips were washed with PBS and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 5 min. The cells were then washed with PBS, permeabilized using 0.2% Triton X-100, and blocked with 10% normal goat serum (NGS). After one wash with PBS containing 1% NGS, the cells were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody to HCN2 (Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel) at a dilution of 1:400 in PBS with 1% NGS for 48 h at 4 °C. The antibody was removed, and cells were again washed with PBS. Cells were then incubated with a donkey anti-rabbit antibody tagged with cyanine 3 (Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, PA) at a dilution of 1:200 in PBS with 1% NGS for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. The antibody was removed, cells were washed in PBS, and the coverslips with cells were mounted on slides using Permount (Fisher). Using an inverted Zeiss TurboPascal confocal microscope, serial sections were taken in 0.8-1.0 μm steps using a × 63 oil immersion objective lens and an excitation wavelength of 543 nm. A Mutation in the S4-S5 Linker of HCN2 (Y331D) Up-regulates a Mixed Cationic “Instantaneous” Current and Reduces If—In order to examine whether the S4-S5 linker was involved in producing the Iinst associated with wild-type HCN2, we mutated the tyrosine at position 331 to aspartic acid (Y331D) in mouse HCN2 and expressed both the mutant and wild-type channels in CHO cells. We chose this residue because a previous study suggested that Xenopus oocytes expressing HCN2 with mutations of this residue had larger instantaneous currents and a smaller If, compared with currents in oocytes expressing wild-type HCN2 (10Chen J. Mitcheson J.S. Tristani-Firouzi M. Lin M. Sanguinetti M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11277-11282Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The largest effects were produced by a mutation of this tyrosine to aspartic acid (Y331D). However, whether the up-regulated instantaneous current was carried by Na+ and K+ and whether the current was sensitive to Cs+ or other If blockers were not determined in those experiments. We anticipated three possible scenarios upon transfection of HCN2 Y331D in CHO cells. 1) If the instantaneous current were significantly larger than Iinst measured in cells expressing the wild-type channel and sensitive to Cs+, then this would suggest that the mutation favored an “If-like” open state. 2) If the instantaneous current were significantly larger than Iinst measured in cells expressing the wild-type channel but insensitive to Cs+, then this would suggest that the mutation favored an “Iinst-like” state. 3) If the instantaneous current were not significantly larger than Iinst measured in cells expressing the wild-type channel and were insensitive to Cs+, then this would suggest that the mutation did not affect Iinst. We expected that the instantaneous currents would be carried by Na+ and K+ in any of the above scenarios. Based on the possibility that Iinst results from a leaky closed state, we hypothesized that the Y331D mutation would increase Iinst and thus that this current would be significantly up-regulated by the mutation, insensitive to Cs+, approximately linear with respect to changes in voltage and carried by Na+ and K+ (11Proenza C.

A comparison of the S3 segment, the S4 segment, and the S4-S5 linker among mouse HCN1 and HCN2, sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) HCN, and the recently crystallized KvAP (16Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Ruta V. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2003; 423: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar) shows the position of the HCN2 Y331D mutation (Fig. 1). Using the whole-cell patch clamp approach, we determined the densities of If and instantaneous currents recorded from cells expressing wild-type HCN2 and HCN2 Y331D in order to control for variability in cell surface area. Cells expressing HCN2 Y331D produced significantly less If and significantly more instantaneous current than did cells expressing wild-type HCN2, as shown in representative current traces (Figs. 2A and 3A). The increase in instantaneous current in cells expressing HCN2 Y331D is apparent in I-V curves generated at each of three varying concentrations of extracellular K+ or Na+ examined (Figs. 2, B-D, and 3, B-D). The increase in instantaneous current amplitude due only to the Y331D mutation is shown in I-V curves that represent the difference in instantaneous currents between cells expressing HCN2 and HCN2 Y331D (Figs. 2E and 3E).Fig. 2Instantaneous currents in CHO cells expressing HCN2 or HCN2 Y331D are permeable to K+but differ in amplitude.A, representative current traces of HCN2 and HCN2 Y331D at three different concentrations of external potassium are shown: 30 mm potassium, 110 mm sodium, 0.4 mm NMG (30K); 15 mm potassium, 110 mm sodium, 15 mm NMG (15K); 5.4 mm potassium, 110 mm sodium, 25 NMG (5.4K). The voltage protocol consisted of 500-ms pulses ranging from +60 to -150 mV at 30-mV steps; the holding potential was -35 mV. Note the parallel reduction in HCN2 Iinst, HCN2 Y331D instantaneous currents, and If as the current carrying ion K+ is lowered from 30K to 15K to 5.4K in both HCN2 and HCN2 Y331D. The dotted line in the current traces recorded in 30K represents the zero current level. The heavy and thin arrows outline the instantaneous currents and If at a test voltage of -150 mV, respectively, for HCN2 and HCN2 Y331D. B-D, comparison of I-V relations between HCN2 (circles) and HCN2 Y331D (squares)at 30K (B), 15K (C), and 5.4K (D). Reversal potentials of HCN2 Iinst at 5.4K, 15K, and 30K were -16.1 ± 3.3, -14.7 ± 3.5, and -11.7 ± 3.2 mV (n = 6). Reversal potentials of HCN2 Y331D instantaneous currents at 5.4 K, 15K, and 30K were -21.7 ± 1.8, -13.7 ± 1.2, and -5.3 ± 1.5 mV (n = 6).

The voltage protocol consisted of 500-ms pulses ranging from +60 to -150 mV at 30-mV steps; the holding potential was -35 mV. Note the parallel reduction in HCN2 Iinst, HCN2 Y331D instantaneous currents, and If as the current carrying ion Na+ is lowered from 110Na to 40Na to 5.4Na in both HCN2 and HCN2 Y331D. B-D, comparison of I-V relations between HCN2 (circles) and HCN2 Y331D (squares) at 110Na (B), 40K (C), and 5.4Na (D). Reversal potentials of HCN2 Iinst at 5.4Na, 40Na, and 110Na were -28.4 ± 0.8, -21 ± 1.2, and -8.7 ± 2.2 mV (n = 8). Reversal potentials of HCN2 Y331D instantaneous currents at 5.4K, 15K, and 30K were -21.9 ± 0.6, -15.5 ± 0.4, and -7.0 ± 0.4 (n = 8).

Interestingly, the I-V curves for Iinst in cells expressing wild-type HCN2 were linear, whereas the I-V curves for the instantaneous current in cells expressing HCN2 Y331D rectified in the inward direction especially at the elevated extracellular K+ and Na+ concentrations. Inward rectification of instantaneous currents was also observed in experiments in Xenopus oocytes expressing HCN2 Y331D (10Chen J. Mitcheson J.S. Tristani-Firouzi M. Lin M. Sanguinetti M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11277-11282Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The rectification suggested that the mixed cation instantaneous currents in cells expressing HCN2 Y331D and HCN2 were different. Previous studies using HEK cells expressing mouse HCN2 also showed that the fully activated If had greater inward rectification at 30 mM K+ as compared with 5.4 mM K+ (8Ludwig A. Zong X. Jeglitsch M. Hofmann F. Biel M. Nature. 1998; 393: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Overall, the results suggested that the up-regulated instantaneous currents we observed in cells expressing HCN2 Y331D had similarities to both If and Iinst. HCN2 Y331D Is Expressed on the Cell Surface of CHO Cells in Significant Amounts—The large decrease in If in cells expressing Y331D may have reflected a decrease in the total amount of protein expressed in the cell and/or localized to the plasma membrane. Therefore, we examined the localization of mutant channels labeled with an anti-HCN2 primary antibody and a cyanine 3-tagged secondary antibody using confocal microscopy, which would unmask any large reductions in protein expression. There was a very strong pattern of fluorescence along the periphery of the cells consistent with the presence of HCN2 protein on the plasma membrane (Fig. 4). Fluorescent regions were also observed in the interior of the cells, probably representing channel protein present in intracellular compartments such as the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, vesicles mediating transport to or from the plasma membrane, or degradatory compartments. There was relatively little fluorescence in nontransfected cells or in mock-transfected cells (not shown). We have shown previously that the wild-type channel demonstrated a similar pattern of localization and overall intensity of fluorescence, whereas mutants lacking the cyclic nucleotide binding domain and distal C terminus or the complete N terminus did not express If or instantaneous currents significantly larger than GFP-transfected cells and demonstrated a very different pattern of localization that did not include fluorescence on the periphery of CHO cells (12Proenza C.

The pattern of fluorescence observed is consistent with the idea that the large instantaneous currents recorded in these cells were due to HCN2 Y331D and that the large reduction of If in cells expressing HCN2 Y331D was not due to a low level of HCN2 protein in the cell or on the plasma membrane. Instantaneous Currents Associated with HCN2 Y331D Are Sensitive to External Cs+in a Voltage-dependent Manner—In cells expressing HCN2, Iinst is not sensitive to Cs+, whereas If is sensitive to Cs+ (11Proenza C. Angoli D. Agranovich E. Macri V. Accili E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5101-5109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar); the ability of Cs+ to block If increases at more negative potentials and occurs only when If is inward (15Moroni A. Barbuti A. Altomare C. Viscomi C. Morgan J. Baruscotti M. DiFrancesco D. Pflugers Arch. 2000; 439: 618-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 17DiFrancesco D. Ferroni A. Mazzanti M. Tromba C.

In order to determine whether the instantaneous currents up-regulated by the Y331D mutation were more like If or Iinst, we examined the sensitivity of instantaneous currents to Cs+ in cells expressing HCN2 Y331D. We found that, in addition to blocking If, Cs+ dramatically reduced instantaneous currents in cells expressing HCN2 Y331D, whereas in cells expressing HCN2, If was blocked but Iinst was not affected (Fig. 5, A and B). The effects of Cs+ occurred within 4-5 s (Fig. 5C) supporting a direct action on the channels. As can be seen in the current traces in Fig. 5B, there was no effect of Cs+ on outward instantaneous currents recorded from cells expressing HCN2 Y331D. This can be seen more clearly in Fig. 5D, which shows the inhibitory effect of Cs+ on instantaneous currents as a function of test voltage. As shown previously, Cs+ had no effect on Iinst recorded from cells expressing HCN2 at any voltage tested. However, Cs+ did block inward, but not outward, instantaneous currents recorded from cells expressing HCN2 Y331D, and the block was greater at more negative voltages. Thus, the key characteristics of Cs+ block of If were manifested by the Cs+ block of a proportion of instantaneous currents recorded from cells expressing HCN2 Y331D. This is consistent with the idea that the up-regulated instantaneous currents observed in cells expressing HCN2 Y331D were due to an “If-like” instantaneous current and not an “Iinst-like” instantaneous current. In Figs. 2E and 3E, the amplitude of instantaneous currents measured in cells expressing HCN2 was subtracted from the amplitude of instantaneous currents measured in cells expressing HCN2 Y331D in order to remove the contribution of instantaneous current due to HCN2 (Cs+-insensitive Iinst). This calculation is reasonable because the amplitude of Cs+-insensitive instantaneous current was not significantly different between cells expressing HCN2 and HCN2 Y331D at -150 mV (see instantaneous currents in Fig. 5D, at -150 mV, replotted in Fig. 5E). At -150 mV, Cs+ blocks If almost completely in cells expressing either HCN2 or HCN2 Y331D (Fig. 5F), and therefore we assumed that the block of any If-like instantaneous current would also be complete at this voltage. We also found that the total amount of Cs+-sensitive current was larger in cells expressing HCN2 Y331D (If + Cs+-sensitive instantaneous current) than in cells expressing HCN2 (If only) (Fig. 5G). The larger Cs+-sensitive current in cells expressing HCN2 Y331D suggests some effect of the mutation on maximal conductance, since the channels are fully activated at -150 mV (see Fig. 7F). One possibility is that the number of functional mutant channels was larger than the number of functional wild-type channels. If this were true, we would expect Cs+-insensi"

To understand how cells control the expression of the IAP gene, we cloned the 5′-proximal region of the human IAP gene and investigated IAP promoter activity by transient transfection. RT-PCR confirmed the expression of IAP transcripts in human neuroblastoma IMR-32 and hepatoma HepG2 cells. Deletion analysis identified a core promoter of the human IAP gene located between nucleotide positions –232 and –12 relative to the translation initiation codon in these two cell lines. Site-directed mutagenesis and gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay identified a α-Pal/NRF-1 binding element within the IAP core promoter. Supershift assays using the α-Pal/NRF-1 antiserum confirmed the binding of this transcription factor on the α-Pal/NRF-1 site. Overexpression of the DNA binding domain of α-Pal/NRF-1 in cells enhanced DNA-α-Pal/NRF-1 binding in vitro. Furthermore, overexpression of full-length α-Pal/NRF-1 significantly enhanced IAP promoter activity while overexpression of dominant-negative mutant reduced promoter activity both in the cultured human cell lines and primary mouse cortical cells. These results revealed that α-Pal/NRF-1 is an essential transcription factor in the regulation of human IAP gene expression.

Integrin-associated protein (IAP), 1The abbreviations used are: IAP, integrin-associated protein; NRF-1, nuclear respiratory factor 1; CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay. also designated as CD47, is a multifunctional membrane protein that is expressed widely in the nervous system, immune system and many other tissues (1Brown E.

Wang H.L. Tang Y.P. Lee E.H.Y. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4305-4313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In good memory rats trained in the inhibitory avoidance learning paradigm, the mRNA level of IAP in the hippocampus was increased. Injection of antisense oligonucleotides or the monoclonal antibody of IAP into the rat hippocampus impaired memory formation (3Huang A.M. Wang H.L. Tang Y.P. Lee E.H.Y. J.

In the peripheral tissues, IAP was first discovered as a cell surface protein associated with integrin αvβ3 and it was involved in the enhancement of neutrophil adhesion, chemotaxis, and phagocytosis triggered by an extracellular matrix (1Brown E.

IAP is also a functional component of several processes, including the transepithelial migration of neutrophils (8Parkos C.A. Colgan S.P. Liang T.W. Nusrat A. Bacarra A.E. Carnes D.K. Madara J.L. J.

Moreover, IAP functions as a self-check marker on red blood cells to prevent their clearance by macrophages (14Oldenborg P.-A. Zheleznyak A. Fang Y.-F. Lagenaur C.F. Gresham H.D. Lindberg F.P. Science. 2000; 288: 2051-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). IAP mRNA and protein sequences are conserved among humans, mice, and rats (3Huang A.M. Wang H.L. Tang Y.P. Lee E.H.Y. J.

Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3419-3425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that it is evolutionally important to biological functions. IAP mRNA has five alternative splicing forms. These forms are also conserved in evolution (3Huang A.M. Wang H.L. Tang Y.P. Lee E.H.Y. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4305-4313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Reinhold M.I. Lindberg F.P. Plas D.

In humans and mice, different forms of IAP mRNA were expressed at varying levels in different tissues; macrophage and endothelial cells expressed predominantly form 2 mRNA and brain tissues expressed predominantly form 4. Why different tissues express different levels and forms of IAP mRNA and how the IAP gene is regulated are, however, unknown. To answer these questions, we investigated the regulation of IAP gene promoter in human neuroblastoma and hepatoma cell lines by using luciferase reporter and gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays. We found that α-Pal/NRF-1 in the core promoter region is a positive regulator of the human IAP gene. Cell Culture—Human neuroblastoma IMR-32 (CCRC 60014) and hepatoma HepG2 (CCRC 60048) cell lines were purchased from Culture Collection and Research Center, Food Industry and Development Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan. Cells were grown in minimum essential medium Eagle with Earle's salt base (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from the cultured cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RT-PCR was performed as described previously (3Huang A.M. Wang H.L. Tang Y.P. Lee E.H.Y. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4305-4313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA (2 μg) was reverse-transcribed into cDNA in 20 μl of 1× first strand buffer containing 0.5 μg of oligo(dT) as a primer, 500 μm dNTP, and 200 units of SuperScript II (Invitrogen). PCR was performed in 20 μl of 1× PCR buffer containing 2 μl of RT products, 1 unit of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science), 200 μm dNTP, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 μm [35S]dATP (Amersham Biosciences), and 0.4 μm primer pair. We used the primer pair that can distinguish the alternative splicing forms of IAP mRNA, Hiap14: 5′-TAA CCT CCT TCG TCA TTG CC and Hiap15: 5′-CGT AAG GGT CTC ATA GGT G. The PCR parameters were 94 °C for 30 s, 53 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s for 30 cycles, followed by a final elongation at 72 °C for 7 min. PCR products were analyzed on a 6% polyacrylamide-urea gel (acrylamide/bisacrylamide 19:1, 8 m urea in 1 × Tris borate-EDTA buffer). The gel was finally dried and analyzed by autoradiography. The image of cDNA bands was scanned by the Scan-Jet 4C scanner (Hewlett Packard). The optical densities of cDNA bands were quantified with the one-dimensional advanced Universal Software (American Applied Biotechnology, Fullerton, CA). Plasmids—pGL3-Basic and pRL-TK luciferase reporter vectors (Promega, Madison, WI) were used for IAP promoter reporter assays. A 7.7-kb human genomic clone (pIAP38) containing exon 1 of the IAP gene and 5′-upstream region was kindly provided by Dr. F. P. Lindberg. A plasmid, pBSII-445, was generated by inserting the 445-bp SacII fragment from pIAP38 into the pBlueScript II (SK–) vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The SacI/XhoI fragment from pBSII-445 was then inserted into the pCRII vector (Invitrogen) to create pHIAP445 for subsequent constructions. The reporter construct pGL3–272 was generated by inserting the XmaI/XhoI fragment from pHIAP445 into the pGL3-Basic vector. Different restriction enzyme-digested fragments from pIAP38 were then ligated into pGL3–272 to create a series of human IAP promoter constructs, including pGL3–1554, pGL3–730, and pGL3–456. Another series of human IAP promoter constructs containing shorter fragments than the insert in pGL3–272, including pGL3–232, pGL3–218, pGL3–209, pGL3–198, pGL3–191, pGL3–159, and pGL3–92, were similarly made by using differential forward primers on the IAP promoter with the KpnI site at the 5′-end and a common reverse primer (GLprimer2) on pGL3-Basic in the backbone of pGL3–272 for PCR to obtain the shorter fragments, which included differentially truncated IAP promoter regions and a common vector sequence containing the HindIII site. These fragments were then digested by KpnI and HindIII and inserted into pGL3-Basic. Promoter constructs containing nucleotide substitutions in the sequence motifs of Sp1 and α-Pal/NRF-1 were individually generated by PCR amplification with primer pairs spanning the mutant nucleotides according to the protocol of site-directed mutagenesis by overlap extension (18Aiyar A. Xiang Y. Leis J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 57: 177-191PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmids pGL3–232m1, pGL3–232m2, and pGL3–232m3 were constructed in the backbone of pGL3–232 using primer pairs containing the introduced mutations. The Sp1 site GGGGCGGGGC was mutated into GTTGCTTGGC in the plasmid of pGL3–232m1. The α-Pal/NRF-1 element TGCGCGTGCGCG was mutated into TTTGCGTGCGCG, and TGCGCGTTTGCG in the plasmid of pGL3–232m2 and pGL3–232m3, respectively. Transfection and Dual-luciferase Assay—IMR-32 and HepG2 cells (1.5 × 105) were plated in each well of six-well plates. Transient transfection was carried out by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (19Jordan M. Schallhorn A. Wurm F.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). The plasmid pRL-TK was cotransfected to normalize the transfection efficiency. After 12 h of transfection, the medium was changed, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 or 48 h. The cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm sodium chloride, 2.7 mm potassium chloride, 10 mm dibasic sodium phosphate, and 2 mm monobasic potassium phosphate) and the lysates were prepared by scraping the cells from plates in the presence of 1× passive lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase assays were performed by using Dual-Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and a Sirius luminometer (Berthold Detection System, Pforzheim, Germany). Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—IMR-32 and HepG2 cells were plated onto 6- or 10-cm cultured dishes and incubated for 2 days. The cells were washed with 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and collected in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 2 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The cell pellet was incubated in 400 μl of buffer A (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm magnesium chloride, 10 mm potassium chloride, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) on ice for 10 min and then gently shaken for 10 s. The pellet of the crude nuclei was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 s. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of buffer C (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 25% glycerol, 420 mm sodium chloride, 1.5 mm magnesium chloride, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) by vortex for 15 s, and then incubated on ice for 20 min. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 2 min, the supernatant containing the nuclear proteins was collected, quantified with BCA Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce), and stored at –70 °C in aliquots. Gel Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—The EMSA used the following oligonucleotides: IAP α-Pal/NRF-1 (f), 5′-GAG TGC GCG TGC GCG GCT CT-3′; IAP α-Pal/NRF-1 (r), 3′-TCA CGC GCA CGC GCC GAG AG-5′; IAP α-Pal/NRF-1 mutation (f), 5′-GAG Ttt GCG Ttt GCG GCT CT-3′; IAP α-Pal/NRF-1 mutation (r), 3′-TCA aaC GCA aaC GCC GAG AG-5′; consensus α-Pal/NRF-1 (f), 5′-TTC TTT TGC GCA CGC GCT T-3; consensus α-Pal/NRF-1 (r), 3′-AAG AAA ACG CGT GCG CGA AGA ATC-5′; consensus α-Pal/NRF-1 mutation (f), 5′-TTC TTT TGt aaA CGa atT T-3′; consensus α-Pal/NRF-1 mutation (r), 3′-AAG AAA ACA ttT GCt tAA AGA ATC-5; consensus Sp1 (f), 5′-GTT GCG GGG CGG GGC CGA GTG-3′; consensus Sp1 (r), 3′-AAC GCC CCG CCC CGG CTC ACG-5′; consensus E2F-1 (f), 5′-TGC AAT TTC GCG CCA AAC TTG-3′; and consensus E2F-1 (r), 3′-GTT AAA GCG CGG TTT GAA C-5′. 30 pmol of each of the forward and reverse oligonucleotides placed in a volume of 23 μlof1× Klenow (DNA polymerase) buffer were heated at 94 °C for 2 min and annealed at room temperature for 30 min. The annealed double-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled by a fill-in reaction using DNA polymerase (Klenow) (Promega). One unit of the DNA polymerase (Klenow) and 40 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were added into the annealed oligonucleotides and the mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. The labeled oligonucleotides were purified by Sephadex G-50 columns (Amersham Biosciences). Cold double-stranded oligonucleotides were used as competitors. The DNA binding reaction was conducted at 4 °C for 30 min in a mixture containing 3 μg of nuclear extract, 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 50 mm sodium chloride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm magnesium chloride, 4% glycerol, 0.05 μg poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences) and 2 × 104 cpm of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides. In supershift assays, antibodies were incubated with the reaction mixture at 4 °C for 30 min before the addition of the IAP α-Pal/NRF-1 probes. The anti-NRF-1 goat polyclonal antiserum was kindly provided by Dr. Richard C. Scarpulla. The Sp1 and E2F antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-Myc antibody was from Invitrogen. The normal goat serum was from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Samples were analyzed on a 4% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide/bisacrylamide 29:1 in 0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA buffer) at 10 V/cm for 2.5 h. The gel was dried and analyzed by autoradiography. Construction and Overexpression of α-Pal/NRF-1—The cDNAs encoding the full-length and dominant-negative mutant of α-Pal/NRF-1 were constructed. The dominant-negative mutant consisted of the first N-terminal 304 residues of α-Pal/NRF-1, which contained the proposed DNA binding and nuclear localization domains and lacking the activation domain (20Virbasius C.A Virbasius J.V.

The primer pair AN-5 (5′-TTAAGCTT GCG CAG CCG CTC TGA GGA A) and AN-7 (5′-GACTCGAG CAC TGT TCC AAT GTC ACC AC) and primer pair AN-5 and AN-11 (5′-GACTCGAG TCA CTG TGA TGG TAC AAG ATG AGC) were used for the untagged full-length and dominant-negative α-Pal/NRF-1, respectively. Primer pair AN-5 and AN-6 (5′-GACTCGAG TCA CTG TTC CAA TGT CAC CA) and primer pair AN-5 and AN-10 (5′-GACTCGAG GTC TGT GAT GGT ACA AGA TGA G) were used for the Myc-tagged full-length and dominant-negative α-Pal/NRF-1, respectively. The underlined region indicates the restriction enzyme sites. These fragments were digested by HindIII and XhoI and inserted into pcDNA3.1 (B+) vector (Invitrogen). HepG2 cells (8 × 105) were placed onto 6-cm dishes for overexpression of α-Pal/NRF-1 using the same procedure for transient transfection of the reporter plasmids. After transient transfection, the cells were incubated for 48 h and harvested for nuclear protein extraction. Primary Cortical Culture—Primary cortical cells were prepared according to the protocol from Dichter (22Dichter M.A. Brain Res. 1978; 149: 279-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). In brief, pregnant ICR mice, 15-days postconception, were anesthetized with pentobarbital, and embryos were removed. The cortices were removed and collected in MEM. The tissue was triturated three times with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette. Dissociated cells were plated onto 6-well plates coated with 0.09 mg/ml poly-l-lysine and grown in MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (MEM 10), 50 units/ml penicillin, and streptomycin. After 24 h, plating media were replaced with MEM 10 and cells were treated with 3 μm of cytosine arabinoside. Twenty-four hours later, the medium was replaced with MEM 10 again, and cells were cultured for another 48 h for the transfection experiments. Statistics—The relative activity of different reporter constructs was compared. Statistical analysis was performed by unpaired Student's t test for pairwise comparisons. A p value <0.05 was regarded as significant. Expression of Integrin-associated Protein Gene in Human IMR-32 and HepG2 Cells—To use IMR-32 and HepG2 cells to study the IAP gene promoter, we examined firstly the expression of IAP transcripts in these cells by RT-PCR. We used primers that can detect alternative splicing forms of IAP mRNAs. As shown in Fig. 1A, both form 1 and form 2 IAP mRNAs were expressed in these two cell lines at a similar level. The major form of IAP mRNA in IMR-32 was form 4. But form 4 is not expressed in HepG2 cells at all. Total IAP transcripts were quantified. The level of total IAP transcripts expressed in IMR-32 cells was ∼3-fold of that expressed in HepG2 cells (Fig. 1B). These results confirmed the expression of the human IAP gene in these two cell lines. Determination of IAP Promoter Activity in IMR-32 and HepG2 Cells—To define the boundaries of a minimal IAP promoter region and identify cis elements that regulate the expression of IAP, we generated a series of 5′-IAP promoter deletion constructs and transfected them into IMR-32 and HepG2 cells. All plasmid constructs were defined relative to the translation initiation codon (Fig. 2A). The reporter constructs were cotransfected into IMR-32 and HepG2 cells with an internal control Renilla luciferase vector. The firefly luciferase activity of each reporter was normalized with the internal control to correct transfection efficiency. Results were represented as a fold-increase in activity with respect to that of the pGL3-Basic vector (Fig. 2, B and C) or the relative activity compared with that of the –232 construct (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Identification of functional cis elements in the IAP core promoter. Shorter promoter fragments were made by PCR (the –218, –209, and –198 constructs). Mutant constructs were made by site-directed mutagenesis (the –232m1, m2, and m3 constructs). The putative Sp1 and α-Pal/NRF-1 sites are indicated. Independent constructs and pRL-TK plasmids were cotransfected into IMR-32 cells using the same protocol as shown in Fig. 2. The promoter activity was expressed with respect to the –232 construct. *, p < 0.05; ***, p < 0.001; unpaired Student's t test.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In IMR-32 cells, the shortest reporter that still retained the basal promoter activity was the –232 construct, whereas deletion for another 41 bp (the –191 construct), 73 bp (the –159 construct), or 140 bp (the –92 construct) resulted in markedly loss of reporter activity. Addition of 40 bp to the –232 construct generated the –272 construct and stimulated the reporter activity by ∼25%. In the construct containing additional 184 bp (the –456 construct), the promoter activity was not increased. Interestingly, the reporter activity decreased to about the basal proximal promoter activity in the construct containing additional 274 bp (the –730 construct) and in the longest construct (the –1554 construct) (Fig. 2B). A similar pattern of promoter activity was observed when the reporter constructs were transfected into HepG2 cells, but with three exceptions (Fig. 2C). First, overall promoter strength relative to pGL3-Basic was much lower in HepG2 cells, about one-sixth to one-fourth compared with IMR-32 cells. Second, the constructs of –272 and –456 produced maximal activity in IMR-32 cells; in HepG2 cells, however, the construct of –730 produced maximal activity. Third, there were negative regulators located between –457 and –730 in IMR-32 cells; in HepG2 cells, however, there were negative regulators located between –730 and –1554. Results suggested a core promoter of the human IAP gene located between –232 and –12 upstream of the translation initiation codon in both IMR-32 and HepG2 cells. The sequence from –272 to ATG was searched for homology to previously described regulatory elements in several databases. There are many putative binding sites for transcription factor in this region (Fig. 3), including activating enhancer binding protein 2 (AP-2), Myc-associated zinc finger protein (Maz), cyclic-AMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB), transcription factor Sp1, E2 promoter binding factor (E2F), and α-Pal/nuclear respiratory factor 1 (α-Pal/NRF-1). Identification of cis-Elements in the Core Promoter of the IAP Gene—To determine more precisely the core promoter of the IAP gene, we generated several shorter or point mutation constructs. When 14 and 23 bp were deleted from the 5′-end of the –232 construct to generate the constructs of –218 and –209, respectively, the promoter activity of these two constructs was identical to that of the –232 construct in IMR-32 cells. This indicated that the sequence between –232 and –209 played no significant role in IAP gene expression under the current experimental conditions. When 34 bp were deleted from the 5′-end of the –232 construct to generate the –198 construct; however, the promoter activity was markedly reduced by 90% in IMR-32 cells, indicating that the sequence between –209 and –198 might be required for the IAP promoter activity (Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 3, the region from –232 to –198 consists of a GC-rich sequence that includes the putative Sp1 and α-Pal/NRF-1 sites. Point mutations were introduced into these sites in IMR-32 cells to determine whether these sites were necessary for IAP promoter activity. When four bases of the Sp1 site were substituted with four T residues to generate the –232m1 construct, no significant effect on the IAP promoter activity was observed (Fig. 4), indicating that Sp1 site in this region was not required for the IAP promoter activity under this condition. The putative α-Pal/NRF-1 site in the IAP promoter is a 12-base tandem-repeat sequence, TGCGCGTGCGCG. When two bases in each of the repeat sequence were replaced by two T residues to generate the –232m2 and –232m3 constructs respectively, an 80% and a 90% drop in promoter activity was observed (Fig. 4). These results suggested that the consensus α-Pal/NRF-1 sequence, but not the consensus Sp1 sequence, is a functional regulatory element in the IAP promoter in IMR-32 cells. α-Pal/NRF-1 Is a Transcription Factor Regulating the IAP Promoter Activity—To demonstrate that the consensus α-Pal/NRF-1 sequence was functional, i.e. that there were endogenous nuclear proteins binding to this region, we performed the EMSA experiment. Nuclear extracts from IMR-32 cells were combined with 32P-fill-in-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides in vitro. A major band of DNA-protein complex was found in all lanes when the nuclear extracts were incubated with the wild-type IAP α-Pal/NRF-1 probes (Fig. 5A, lane 3 and lanes 5–12), but not with the mutant IAP α-Pal/NRF-1 probes (Fig. 5A, lane 4). No band was found when nuclear extracts were not added into the probes (Fig. 5A, lanes 1 and 2). Competition analysis using a 10- or 60-fold molar excess of unlabeled probes was used to characterize the factor, which specifically binds to this sequence. As expected, the addition of a 10- or 60-fold molar excess of published wild-type consensus α-Pal/NRF-1 element reduced the intensity of these complexes (Fig. 5A, lanes 5 and 6), whereas the addition of the mutant consensus α-Pal/NRF-1 sequence did not (Fig. 5A, lanes 7 and 8). Results suggested that α-Pal/NRF-1 proteins might bind to the IAP α-Pal/NRF-1 element. However, the α-Pal/NRF-1 site is GC-rich and might therefore interact with factors other than α-Pal/NRF-1, such as Sp1 and E2F. We therefore used the unlabeled consensus Sp1 and E2F sequence for the competition experiment. The intensity of the migrating bands was not significantly reduced (Fig. 5A, lanes 9–12). Supershift assays using the anti-α-Pal/NRF-1 antiserum were used to further confirm the binding of the α-Pal/NRF-1 on its DNA element. The migrating bands were weakened when increasing amounts of α-Pal/NRF-1 antiserum were added and supershifted bands appeared (Fig. 5B, lanes 3–5). However, the Sp1 or E2F antibody did not generate any supershifted band (Fig. 5B, lanes 6 and 7), neither did the normal goat serum (Fig. 5B, lane 8). The EMSA experiments also revealed that the DNA binding activity of α-Pal/NRF-1 in IMR-32 cells (Fig. 5C, lanes 1–3) was much higher than that in HepG2 cells (Fig. 5C, lanes 4–6). The oligonucleotide probes and competitors used in the EMSA experiments were shown in Fig. 5D. These results strongly suggested that α-Pal/NRF-1 but not Sp1 or E2F binds to the IAP α-Pal/NRF-1 site. To further confirm that α-Pal/NRF-1 is the major transcription factor that binds to the IAP α-Pal/NRF-1 element, plasmids encoding the full-length or dominant-negative mutant of α-Pal/NRF-1 with or without a Myc tag were transiently transfected into HepG2 cells. The addition of a Myc tag in the C-terminal of α-Pal/NRF-1 is useful for the supershift assay in the EMSA experiments. In HepG2 cells, overexpression of the full-length α-Pal/NRF-1 (Fig. 6A, lanes 4–6) and Myc-tagged α-Pal/NRF-1 (Fig. 6B, lanes 3–5) enhanced the binding of DNA-protein complex in a dose-dependent manner as compared with the mock controls (Fig. 6A, lane 3 and 6B, lane 2). Overexpression of the dominant-negative mutant of α-Pal/NRF-1, which contains only the N-terminal DNA binding domain, did not affect endogenous DNA-protein binding in HepG2 cells but generated an additional band of DNA-protein complex with a smaller molecular weight. The DNA binding activity was strongly enhanced by the overexpression of the dominant-negative mutant (Fig. 6, A and B, lanes 7–9). This discrepancy may be related to the higher transfection efficiency of the plasmid that contained the dominant-negative mutant. In supershift assays, the band of DNA-protein complex containing the α-Pal/NRF-1-myc fusion protein was supershifted when monoclonal anti-Myc antibody was used (Fig. 6B, lane 6). The band of DNA-protein complex containing the dominant-negative mutant of α-Pal/NRF-1 fused with the Myc protein fragment was also completely supershifted by the monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 6B, lane 10). These data strongly suggested that α-Pal/NRF-1 binds to this region (–204 to –193) of the human IAP gene promoter in vitro. If the α-Pal/NRF-1 protein binds to the α-Pal/NRF-1 element in the IAP promoter in vitro, it should functionally regulate the promoter activity of the IAP gene in vivo. To test this possibility, the full-length or dominant-negative α-Pal/"

Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide also activates macrophages via a toll-like receptor pathway (TLR-4), but we and others have reported that lipopolysaccharide also stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation in macrophages. Herein we report that exposure of RAW 264.7 murine macrophages to CpG DNA (but not non-CpG DNA) provoked the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of vav1. PP1, a selective inhibitor of src-related tyrosine kinases, blocked both the CpG DNA-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of vav1 and the CpG DNA-mediated up-regulation of macrophage tumor necrosis factor secretion and inducible nitric-oxide synthase protein accumulation. Furthermore, we found that the inducible expression of any of three dominant interfering mutants of vav1 (a truncated protein, vavC; a form containing a point mutation in the regulatory tyrosine residue, vavYF174; and a form with an in-frame deletion of six amino acids required for the guanidine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity of vav1 for rac family GTPases, vavGEFmt) consistently inhibited CpG DNA-mediated up-regulation of tumor necrosis factor secretion and inducible nitric-oxide synthase protein accumulation in RAW-TT10 macrophages. Finally, we determined that CpG DNA-mediated up-regulation of NF-κB activity (but not mitogen-activated protein kinase activation) was inhibited by preincubation with PP1 or by expression of the truncated vavC mutant.

Although exposure of animals to CpG DNA also leads to a robust T helper cell 1 cytokine response in most cases, the effects of CpG DNA on T cells are indirect, resulting from the production of innate cytokines such as type I interferons, interleukin-12, and interleukin-18 (3Weiner G.J.

Although targeted disruption of three src family kinases (hck, lyn, fgr), alone or in combination, has failed to demonstrate an essential role for this pathway in macrophage activation by LPS (12Meng F. Lowell C.A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1661-1670Google Scholar), this may be due to compensation by other src family members. Recent studies with highly src family-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors (13Hanke J. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissett W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol.

However, little attention has been paid to the potential role of these tyrosine phosphorylation pathways in macrophage activation by bacterial DNA. In the present study, we examined the ability of CpG DNA to provoke the tyrosine phosphorylation of vav1 in macrophages and used complementary strategies to determine whether vav1 phosphorylation played a critical role in CpG DNA-mediated macrophage activation. Reagents—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was purchased from Mediatech Inc. (Herndon, VA). Penicillin/streptomycin and l-glutamine were obtained from Invitrogen. Fetal bovine serum was purchased from HyClone Laboratories (Logan, UT). Nuclease-resistant phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides (S-ODN) were purchased from Operon (Valencia, CA) and had no detectable endotoxin activity by Limulus assay. The sequences of the S-ODN used were 5′-TCCATGACGTTCCTGACGTT-3′ (CpG DNA, ODN1826) and 5′TCCAGGACTTCTCTTCAGGTT3′ (nCpG DNA, ODN1982). LPS purified from Escherichia coli strain O111:B4 and rIFNγ were obtained from Sigma. Zeocin and tetracycline were purchased from Invitrogen. PP1, a src family-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was purchased from Calbiochem. vav1 Constructs—We obtained c-myc epitope-tagged constructs encoding (a) vavC, a truncated form of vav1, comprising amino acids 538–845, including the C-terminal SH2 and SH3 domains; (b) vavYF174, a tyrosine to phenylalanine point mutant at position 174; and (c) vavGEFmt, a mutant containing an in-frame deletion of six amino acids in the GEF domain, as generous gifts from A. Weiss (University of California, San Francisco) (15Wu J. Katzav S. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4337-4346Google Scholar, 16Kuhne M. Ku G. Weiss A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2185-2190Google Scholar). The vav1 constructs were subcloned into the expression vector pTet/Zeo, a tetracycline operator (tetO) expression plasmid that also encodes resistance to the antibiotic Zeocin (D. Underhill, The Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle, WA). Creation of Stably Transfected Cell Lines—RAW-TT10 cells (17Underhill D.M. Ozinsky A. Hajjar A.M. Stevens A. Wilson C.B. Bassetti M. Aderem A. Nature. 1999; 401: 811-815Google Scholar) (D. Underhill and A. Aderem, The Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle, WA) are RAW 264.7 murine macrophages (ATCC, Manassas, VA) that have been engineered to express the tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA) (18Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Google Scholar, 19Shockett P. Difilippantonio M. Hellman N. Schatz D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6522-6526Google Scholar) from a tetracycline-regulated promoter. RAW-TT10 cells were transfected with the subcloned expression constructs using electroporation as described by Underhill et al. (20Underhill D.M. Chen J. Allen L.A. Aderem A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33619-33623Google Scholar). In this tetracycline-regulatable “Tet-Off” system, the promoter is quiescent in the presence of low doses of tetracycline; in the absence of tetracycline, there is a marked increase in the expression of cDNAs directed by the tetracycline operator (tetO)-promoter sequence (17Underhill D.M. Ozinsky A. Hajjar A.M. Stevens A. Wilson C.B. Bassetti M. Aderem A. Nature. 1999; 401: 811-815Google Scholar). Cells expressing the indicated pTet/Zeo-based constructs were selected in the presence of Zeocin (1 mg/ml for 1 week and then 500 μg/ml). All stable cell lines were stored in liquid nitrogen and were cultured for less than 4 weeks prior to study. Cells and Cell Culture—RAW 264.7 murine macrophages were obtained from ATCC. RAW 264.7 cells and RAW-TT10 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin G, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. RAW-TT10/vavC, RAW-TT10/vavYF174, and RAW-TT10/vavGEFmt cells were selected and maintained in medium containing both Zeocin (300–1000 μg/ml) and tetracycline (1–5 μg/ml). In the experimental conditions, RAW-TT10 subclones expressing the mutant forms of vav1 were grown in tetracycline 1 μg/ml (control) or in the absence of tetracycline (allowing construct expression) for 48–72 h prior to stimulation. Experiments were performed in 6-well (BD Biosciences) or 100-mm (Corning, Corning, NY) tissue culture dishes. The cells were grown to 60–70% confluence prior to stimulation. The cells were stimulated with either CpG DNA or nCpG DNA (range of concentrations, 0.1–12 μg/ml) alone or in the presence of rIFNγ. For studies of TNF secretion and inducible nitricoxide synthase (iNOS) protein accumulation, cells were incubated for ∼18 h before the cell supernatants were collected and/or cell lysates were prepared. For the study of vav1 tyrosine phosphorylation or MAP kinase activation, cells were stimulated for 10–40 min prior to preparation of the cell lysates and/or vav1 immunoprecipitates. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Adherent cells were lysed with extraction buffer (20 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 50 μg/ml NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). For quantitation of iNOS protein levels in cell lysates, the samples were electrophoresed on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline, and then reacted with a murine monoclonal antibody specific for iNOS (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) at a dilution of 1:800 for 2 h. The blots were then reacted with a sheep anti-mouse IgG peroxidase-linked conjugate (Amersham Biosciences) at a dilution of 1:3300 for 1–2 h, and proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Detection of activated MAP kinases was achieved by immunoblotting of cell lysates using an antibody to phospho-p38 (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA), phospho-JNK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), or phospho-ERK (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Expression of the truncated vav1 construct (vavC) in cell lysates was detected by immunoblotting with a rabbit polyclonal antiserum specific for vav1 (Upstate Biotechnology Incorporated, Lake Placid, NY), whereas expression of the full-length vavYF174 and vavGEFmt constructs was routinely detected by immunoblotting with a murine monoclonal antibody specific for the c-myc epitope tag (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). vav1 protein tyrosine phosphorylation was detected by two methods. For immunoprecipitations, lysates were cleared with normal rabbit serum (Sigma) prior to incubation with polyclonal rabbit antiserum specific for vav1 (Upstate Biotechnology Incorporated or Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immune complexes were collected with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and then reacted with the murine monoclonal antiphosphotyrosine antibody, 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology). Alternatively, whole cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and reacted with a polyclonal rabbit antiserum specific for vav1 phosphorylated on tyrosine 174 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). In each case, the blots were then reacted with the species-specific IgG peroxidase-linked conjugate secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences), and proteins were then detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. The relative intensities of bands were compared using a Bio-Rad Model GS-700 densitometer. Measurement of TNF Concentrations—Supernatants were collected and stored at -20 °C. TNF protein levels were determined by a solid phase sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay specific for murine TNF as specified by the manufacturer (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). NF-κB Activation: Transient Transfections and Luciferase Assay— RAW 264.7 cells and RAW-TT10/vavC cells were grown to ∼80% confluency in 6-well plates. Cells were transfected with a mixture of NF-κB-luciferase and pRL-TK constructs using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen). The transfected cells were pooled and split into 96-well plates at a volume of 200 μl (∼1.25 × 106 cells/ml). RAW 264.7 cells were then preincubated with medium alone or PP1 at the indicated concentrations for 1 h prior to stimulation. RAW-TT10/vavC cells were cultured in the presence or absence of tetracycline (1 μg/ml) for 72 h prior to transfection and maintained in the presence or absence of tetracycline after transfection. The cells were then stimulated with medium alone, CpG DNA (6 μg/ml), or LPS (1 μg/ml) for ∼17 h. Luciferase activity in the cell extracts was analyzed according to the manufacturer's protocol using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI). The luciferase activity was normalized using pRL-TK-luciferase activity in each sample. CpG DNA Triggers the Tyrosine Phosphorylation of vav1 in RAW 264.7 Cells in a Time- and Concentration-dependent Manner—We and others have reported previously that LPS stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of vav1 in macrophages (10Geng Y. Gulbins E. Altman A. Lotz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8602-8606Google Scholar, 11English B.K. Orlicek S.L. Mei Z. Meals E.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 62: 859-864Google Scholar) and have implicated hck and/or other src-related tyrosine kinases in this process (9Orlicek S.L. Hanke J.H. English B.K. Shock. 1999; 12: 350-354Google Scholar, 11English B.K. Orlicek S.L. Mei Z. Meals E.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 62: 859-864Google Scholar). In this study, we found that exposure of RAW 264.7 cells to CpG DNA (0.1–12.0 μg/ml) led to the rapid (detectable within 10–20 min; Fig. 1A) and dose-dependent (Fig. 1, B–D) phosphorylation of vav1 on tyrosine, as demonstrated by either immunoblotting of vav1 immunoprecipitates with 4G10, a murine monoclonal antibody specific for phosphotyrosine residues (Fig. 1, A, B, and D, representative experiments, n = 6) or by immunoblotting of whole cell lysates with a rabbit polyclonal antiserum specific for vav1 phosphorylated on tyrosine 174 (Fig. 1C is representative, n = 4). Exposure of RAW cells to control nCpG DNA (0.1–12.0 μg/ml) for 10–30 min failed to induce detectable vav1 phosphorylation (Fig. 1D is representative, n = 5). PP1, a Selective Inhibitor of src-related Tyrosine Kinases, Potently Blocks CpG DNA-mediated TNF Secretion, iNOS Protein Accumulation, and vav1 Tyrosine Phosphorylation in RAW 264.7 Cells—The pyrazolopyrimidine PP1 is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of src-related tyrosine kinases (13Hanke J. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissett W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Google Scholar) and lacks activity against other classes of tyrosine kinases (e.g. JAK kinases, ZAP-70/syk kinases), although one recent report suggests that it may also be active against the abl kinase (21Tatton L. Morley G.M. Chopra R. Khwaja A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4847-4853Google Scholar). We have reported previously that PP1 inhibits LPS-mediated activation of the src-related kinase hck and the subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of vav1 (a target of hck and possibly other src-related kinases) in RAW 264.7 cells (9Orlicek S.L. Hanke J.H. English B.K. Shock. 1999; 12: 350-354Google Scholar). To investigate the potential role of src-related tyrosine kinases in CpG DNA-mediated macrophage activation and vav1 tyrosine phosphorylation, we exposed RAW 264.7 cells to a range of concentrations of PP1 (1–20 μm) for 1 h prior to stimulation with CpG DNA ± rIFNγ as indicated (Fig. 2). CpG DNA has been reported previously to stimulate macrophage production of TNF and, in the presence of IFNγ, iNOS, and NO (2Stacey K.J. Sweet M.J. Hume D.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2116-2122Google Scholar, 3Weiner G.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 68: 455-463Google Scholar, 4Utaisincharoen P. Anuntagool N. Chaisuriya P. Pichyangkul S. Sirisinha S. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2002; 128: 467-473Google Scholar, 22Yeo S.J. Yoon J.G. Hong S.C. Yi A.K. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 1052-1061Google Scholar). We first confirmed that exposure of RAW 264.7 cells to a range of concentrations (0.1–6.0 μg/ml) of CpG DNA (but not nCpG DNA) led to dose-dependent TNF secretion and, in the presence of low concentrations of rIFNγ (1–25 units/ml), iNOS protein accumulation (not shown). In the absence of rIFNγ, CpG DNA alone (0.1–12.0 μg/ml) failed to stimulate detectable iNOS accumulation (not shown). Preincubation with PP1 (1–20 μm) led to marked inhibition of CpG DNA-mediated TNF (Fig. 2A, representative experiment performed in triplicate, n = 8) and iNOS production by RAW 264.7 cells (Fig. 2B, representative experiment, n = 5) and completely blocked CpG DNA-mediated vav1 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2C, representative experiment, n = 5). The PP1 IC50s for TNF and iNOS accumulation were <10 μm and ∼10 μm, respectively. The PP1 IC50 for vav1 phosphorylation was less than 10 μm. PP1 (10 μm) inhibited CpG DNA-mediated TNF secretion by ∼65% (range, 55–83%) and reduced CpG DNA-mediated iNOS protein accumulation by ∼54%. Inducible Expression of Any of Three Dominant Interfering Mutants of vav1 Inhibited CpG-mediated TNF Secretion and iNOS Protein Accumulation in RAW-TT10 Cells—To directly test the role of vav1 in macrophage activation by CpG DNA, we expressed a series of potentially dominant interfering mutants (Fig. 3A)of vav1 in RAW 264.7 cells. Cell lines were established in the presence of tetracycline (1–5 μg/ml) to prevent construct expression prior to the time of the experimental conditions. All three mutant forms of vav1 were expressed in a tetracycline-regulatable fashion in RAW-TT10/vavC, RAW-TT10/vavYF174, and RAW-TT10/vavGEFmt cells (Fig. 3, B and C, is representative, n = 7). Robust expression of all three mutant forms of vav1 was detected from cells grown in cell tissue culture medium without tetracycline for 48–72 h (compared with lysates from cells maintained in the presence of 1–5 μg/ml of tetracycline), as shown in representative immunoblots of cell lysates reacted with either a rabbit polyclonal antiserum specific for vav1 (to detect the truncated vavC construct of ∼37 kDa) (Fig. 3B) or a murine monoclonal antibody specific for the c-myc epitope tag (to detect the full-length vavYF174 and vavGEFmt constructs) (Fig. 3C). Expression of the vav1 constructs was both time- and tetracycline concentration-dependent. Construct expression could be detected within 24 h after removal of the cells from tetracycline, and expression was maximal by 48–72 h (not shown). Construct expression was routinely detected in cells cultured in concentrations of tetracycline <10–100 ng/ml. We found that RAW-TT10 macrophages expressing each of the three mutant forms of vav1 (in the absence of tetracycline) consistently secreted less TNF (Fig. 4) and accumulated less iNOS protein (Fig. 5) after stimulation with CpG DNA ± rIFNγ. Cells cultured in tetracycline (1–5 μg/ml) (preventing construct expression) served as the control in each experiment. Tetracycline, in the range of concentrations tested (10 pg/ml–5 μg/ml), had no effect on the magnitude of TNF secretion or iNOS protein accumulation in response to stimulation with CpG DNA or LPS ± rIFNγ in either RAW 264.7 macrophages or RAW-TT10 cells (data not shown).Fig. 5Tetracycline-regulated expression of each of three vav1 mutants in RAW-TT10 macrophages inhibited CpG DNA-mediated iNOS protein accumulation. Cells were cultured in the presence of tetracycline 5 μg/ml (control) or absence of tetracycline (allowing construct expression) for 72 h prior to stimulation with rIFNγ + CpG DNA for 18 h before cell lysates were prepared. Cells were stimulated with the following concentrations of stimuli: A, medium alone (lanes 1 and 5), rIFNγ 25 units/ml (lanes 2 and 6), CpG DNA 12 μg/ml (lanes 3 and 7), or rIFNγ 25 units/ml + CpG DNA 12 μg/ml (lanes 4 and 8); B, medium alone (lanes 1 and 7), rIFNγ 25 units/ml + nCpG DNA, 3 μg/ml (lanes 2 and 8), or rIFNγ 25 units/ml + CpG DNA 0.5 μg/ml (lanes 3 and 9), 1 μg/ml (lanes 4 and 10), 3 μg/ml (lanes 5 and 11), or 6 μg/ml (lanes 6 and 12); C, rIFNγ 25 units/ml alone (lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7) or rIFNγ 25 units/ml + CpG DNA 3 μg/ml (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8). Ponceau staining (prior to immunoblotting) confirmed equivalent protein loading for these blots (not shown). Additional aliquots of the protein samples from blots A and C were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed for equivalence of protein loading by probing with an antibody that recognizes total p38 MAP kinase protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) CpG DNA-triggered TNF secretion was diminished by ∼22% in RAW-TT10 cells expressing the vavC mutant (n = 10; 10 of 10 experimental conditions revealed inhibition out of tetracycline), by 32% in the cells expressing the vavYF174 mutant (n = 8; 8 of 8 showed inhibition out of tetracycline), and by 36% in the cells expressing the vavGEFmt (n = 15; 14/15 showed inhibition out of tetracycline) (Fig. 4 depicts representative experiments). RAW-TT10 cells stimulated with rIFNγ alone secreted small amounts of TNF protein, and rIFNγ-triggered TNF secretion was not consistently inhibited by expression of any of the three vav1 constructs (Fig. 4, A and C, is representative, n = 8). CpG DNA-mediated iNOS protein accumulation was reduced by ∼60% in the RAW-TT10 cells expressing the vavC mutant (n = 8), by 39% in the cells expressing the vavYF174 mutant (n = 8), and by 56% in the cells expressing the vavGEFmt (n = 8) (Fig. 5 depicts representative experiments). Thus, tetracycline-regulated increases in the expression of each of three different dominant interfering mutant forms of vav1 consistently inhibited the CpG DNA-mediated up-regulation of iNOS production and TNF secretion in RAW-TT10 macrophages, directly implicating vav1 in the process of macrophage activation by CpG DNA. Effect of PP1 Pre-incubation or Expression of Dominant Interfering Mutants of vav1 on CpG DNA-mediated NF-κB and MAP Kinase Activation—Pre-incubation of RAW 264.7 macrophages for 1 h with PP1 (1–5 μm) potently inhibited CpG DNA-mediated NF-κB activation (Fig. 6A depicts a representative experiment performed in triplicate, n = 5). Similarly, expression of the truncated vavC mutant in RAW-TT10/vavC cells cultured in the absence of tetracycline consistently inhibited the up-regulation of NF-κB activity by CpG DNA or by LPS (Fig. 6B depicts a representative experiment performed in triplicate, n = 3). In contrast, neither preincubation with PP1 (1–20 μm) (Fig. 6C is representative, n = 5) nor expression of the truncated vavC construct (Fig. 6D depicts a representative experiment, n = 7) inhibited the activation of ERK, p38, or JNK MAP kinases in response to stimulation with CpG DNA. Furthermore, expression of the vavYF174 and vavGEFmt constructs also failed to inhibit CpG DNA-mediated increases in the activity of ERK, p38, or JNK MAP kinases (not shown; n = 5). In this study, we demonstrated that exposure of RAW 264.7 murine macrophages to CpG DNA induces the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of vav1. We provided two types of evidence that this event plays an important role in macrophage responses to CpG DNA. First, we demonstrated that a selective inhibitor of src-related tyrosine kinases, PP1 (13Hanke J. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissett W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Google Scholar), potently inhibits CpG DNA-mediated TNF secretion and iNOS protein up-regulation in macrophages at concentrations comparable with those needed to block CpG DNA-mediated vav1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Furthermore, we show that the tetracycline-regulatable expression of any of three dominant interfering mutants of vav1 in stable subclones of RAW-TT10 macrophages inhibits both TNF secretion and iNOS protein accumulation in response to the challenge with CpG DNA. These results indicate that the phosphorylation of vav1 by one or more src-related kinases plays a key role in the macrophage response to CpG DNA. Weinstein et al. (5Weinstein S.L. Gold M.R. De Franco A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4148-4152Google Scholar) first reported that macrophage activation by Gram-negative bacterial LPS provoked tyrosine phosphorylation and that an inhibitor of tyrosine kinases (herbimycin A) could block the production of inflammatory mediators by macrophages exposed to LPS. Subsequently, we (6English B.K. Ihle J.N. Myracle A. Yi T. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1017-1022Google Scholar, 8Orlicek S.L. Meals E. English B.K. J. Infect.

Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Google Scholar) have provided biochemical and pharmacological evidence that tyrosine kinases of the src family are activated in response to LPS and play key roles in macrophage activation. We have also previously identified vav1 as a substrate of hck and perhaps other src family kinases in macro-phages (9Orlicek S.L. Hanke J.H. English B.K. Shock. 1999; 12: 350-354Google Scholar, 11English B.K. Orlicek S.L. Mei Z. Meals E.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 62: 859-864Google Scholar). The role of src-related kinases in LPS-mediated macrophage activation remains controversial because targeted disruption of up to three src-related kinases (hck, lyn, fgr) in mice failed to ablate LPS signaling (12Meng F. Lowell C.A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1661-1670Google Scholar) and because the recently discovered mammalian toll-like receptors (TLRs) signal via a cascade that does not include tyrosine kinases (23Beutler B. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2002; 9: 2-10Google Scholar, 24Kawai T. Adachi O. Ogawa T. Takeda K. Akira S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 115-122Google Scholar, 25Hemmi H. Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Kaisho T. Sato S. Sanjo H. Matsumoto M. Hoshino K. Wagner H. Takeda K. Akira S. Nature. 2000; 408: 740-745Google Scholar). However, the recent availability of highly src family-selective pyrazolopyrimidine tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as PP1 and PP2 (9Orlicek S.L. Hanke J.H. English B.K. Shock. 1999; 12: 350-354Google Scholar, 13Hanke J. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissett W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Google Scholar), has provided additional support for the role of these kinases in macrophage responses to LPS. For example, we found that PP1 potently inhibited the LPS-mediated up-regulation of TNF and iNOS production in macrophages at concentrations comparable with those needed to block the activation of hck and the phosphorylation of vav1 (9Orlicek S.L. Hanke J.H. English B.K. Shock. 1999; 12: 350-354Google Scholar). vav1, first identified as a proto-oncogene expressed in hematopoietic cells, is a 95-kDa protein containing a src homology 2 domain, two src homology 3 domains, a pleckstrin homology domain, and a dbl homology domain found in proteins that serve as GEFs for small GTPases (26Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Google Scholar). vav1 functions in part as a GEF for rac1 (27Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Google Scholar) and possibly also for other rho family GT-Pases. The GEF activity of vav1 is required for many (26Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Google Scholar, 28Billadeau D.D. Brumbaugh K.M. Dick C.J. Schoon R.A. Bustelo X.R. Leibson P.J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 549-559Google Scholar), but not all (15Wu J. Katzav S. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4337-4346Google Scholar), of the functions of this protein in lymphocytes. We (11English B.K. Orlicek S.L. Mei Z. Meals E.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 62: 859-864Google Scholar) and others (10Geng Y. Gulbins E. Altman A. Lotz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8602-8606Google Scholar) have reported previously that vav1 undergoes rapid tyrosine phosphorylation in response to macrophage activation by LPS. In addition, we observed that vav1 was physically associated with the src-related tyrosine kinase hck (11English B.K. Orlicek S.L. Mei Z. Meals E.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 62: 859-864Google Scholar) in macrophages and that both broadly active and src family-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors blocked LPS-stimulated hck activation and vav1 tyrosine phosphorylation at concentrations that also inhibited macrophage production of TNF and iNOS (8Orlicek S.L. Meals E. English B.K. J. Infect. Dis. 1996; 174: 638-642Google Scholar, 9Orlicek S.L. Hanke J.H. English B.K. Shock. 1999; 12: 350-354Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of vav1 on tyrosine 174 is necessary to activate the GEF activity of the protein (27Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Google Scholar), and the structural basis for this effect (relief of autoinhibition of the dbl homology domain of vav1) has recently been elucidated (29Aghazadeh B. Lowry W.E. Huang X.Y. Rosen M.K. Cell. 2000; 102: 625-633Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that the tetracycline-regulatable expression of any of three different mutant forms of vav1 (vavC, vavYF174, or vavGEFmt) in stable cell lines derived from RAW-TT10 macrophages substantially inhibited iNOS protein accumulation and TNF secretion in response to CpG DNA challenge. Our findings suggest that the function of vav1 in this macrophage signaling pathway depends upon its GEF activity, unlike its role in T lymphocytes. Weiss and colleagues (16Kuhne M. Ku G. Weiss A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2185-2190Google Scholar) report that overexpression of the truncated vavC construct inhibited the activation of Jurkat T cells but that expression of wild-type vav1, vavYF174, or vavGEFmt was sufficient to augment T cell activation and nuclear factor of activated T-cell activity (15Wu J. Katzav S. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4337-4346Google Scholar, 16Kuhne M. Ku G. Weiss A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2185-2190Google Scholar). Macrophage responses to bacterial products are coordinated primarily by TLRs (23Beutler B. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2002; 9: 2-10Google Scholar, 25Hemmi H. Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Kaisho T. Sato S. Sanjo H. Matsumoto M. Hoshino K. Wagner H. Takeda K. Akira S. Nature. 2000; 408: 740-745Google Scholar) and the key adaptor protein, MyD88 (24Kawai T. Adachi O. Ogawa T. Takeda K. Akira S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 115-122Google Scholar, 30Hacker H. Vabulas R.M. Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Akira S. Wagner H. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 595-600Google Scholar, 31Yeo S.J. Yoon J.G. Yi A.K. J. Biol.

There are 10 TLRs in mice and man, and ligands for more than half of the known TLRs (most appear to have multiple ligands) have been identified (23Beutler B. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2002; 9: 2-10Google Scholar), including Gram-negative bacterial LPS, recognized by TLR-4; bacterial lipopeptides, recognized by TLR-2; flagellin, recognized by TLR-5; double-stranded RNA, recognized by TLR-3; and bacterial DNA (CpG motifs), recognized by TLR-9 (25Hemmi H. Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Kaisho T. Sato S. Sanjo H. Matsumoto M. Hoshino K. Wagner H. Takeda K. Akira S. Nature. 2000; 408: 740-745Google Scholar). After interacting with CpG DNA, TLR-9 recruits MyD88 via an interaction between the C-terminal Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domains, leading to downstream signals that include the activation of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinases 1 (IRAK-1) and 4 (IRAK-4) and tumor necrosis factor α-receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF-6), leading to up-regulation of NF-κB activity as well as the activation of p38 and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) MAP kinase pathways. TLR-9-mediated responses to CpG DNA absolutely require MyD88 (32Schnare M. Holt A.C. Takeda K. Akira S. Medzhitov R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1139-1142Google Scholar), whereas both MyD88-dependent and -independent signaling has been observed for TLR-4 and TLR-3 ligands (33Akira S. Hoshino K. J. Infect. Dis. 2003; 187: S356-S363Google Scholar). Downstream mediators of the response to CpG DNA include the ERK, JNK, and p38 MAP kinases, which are activated at least in part via TRAF-6 (30Hacker H. Vabulas R.M. Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Akira S. Wagner H. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 595-600Google Scholar, 31Yeo S.J. Yoon J.G. Yi A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40590-40600Google Scholar). We found that an inhibitor of src-related tyrosine kinases (PP1) or the expression of dominant-interfering mutants of vav1 blocked the up-regulation of NF-κB activity by CpG DNA in RAW 264.7 cells but failed to inhibit CpG DNA-mediated MAP kinase activation in these cells. Our data indicate that one or more src-related tyrosine kinases and a target of these kinases, vav1, also play a key role in the up-regulation of inflammatory mediator production in macrophages exposed to bacterial DNA. Future studies in our laboratory aim to define the step(s) at which these tyrosine phosphorylation pathways diverge from the TLR-9/MyD88 pathway in macrophages stimulated with CpG DNA, to identify the specific src-related kinase(s) that are activated by CpG DNA, and to delineate the mechanism(s) by which vav1 serves to up-regulate TNF and iNOS production in macrophages exposed to bacterial DNA and other bacterial products."

The RAH allele is the first documented variant of the human GrB gene, occurs at a frequency of 25–30%, and encodes three amino acid substitutions (Q48R, P88A, and Y245H). It was initially reported that RAH GrB is incapable of inducing apoptosis, but here we show that it has essentially identical proteolytic and cytotoxic properties to wild type GrB. Recombinant RAH and wild type GrB cleave peptide substrates with similar kinetics, are both capable of cleaving Bid and procaspase 3, and are equally inhibited by proteinase inhibitor 9, an endogenous regulator of GrB. Furthermore, cytotoxic lymphocytes from RAH heterozygotes and homozygotes have no defect in target cell killing, and in vitro RAH GrB and wild type GrB kill cells equally well in the presence of perforin. We conclude that the RAH allele represents a neutral polymorphism in the GrB gene. A key function of human granzyme B (GrB) is to induce apoptosis of target cells in conjunction with perforin.

Cytotoxic lymphocytes (CLs) 1The abbreviations used are: CL, cytotoxic lymphocytes; GrB, granzyme B; PI-9, proteinase inhibitor 9; LAK, lymphokine-activated killer cell; Boc, t-butoxycarbonyl. play a central role in cell-mediated immunity by destroying virus-infected, foreign, or tumor cells (1Trapani J.A. Smyth M.J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 735-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). They also contribute to the pathology of autoimmune diseases such as diabetes and to graft versus host disease following bone marrow transplantation (1Trapani J.A. Smyth M.J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 735-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). On contact with a target cell, the CL releases cytotoxins such as perforin, proteases (granzymes), and death ligands from secretory granules into the intercellular space. Target cell death then follows one of two pathways: activation of death receptors on the target cell surface coupled to caspase activation within the cell or uptake of granzymes in a perforin-dependent manner that leads to caspase activation and intracellular proteolysis (2Barry M. Bleackley C.R. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 401-409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the latter pathway, perforin and granzymes are endocytosed by the target cell, and perforin mediates release of granzymes into the cytoplasm (3Froelich C.J. Orth K. Turbov J. Seth P. Gottleib R.

Caspase activation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, proteolysis of key house-keeping proteins, DNA degradation, and the disintegration of cellular structures follow rapidly. Human CLs produce granzyme A (GrA) and granzyme B (GrB), two cytotoxic granule serine proteases that activate different death pathways (2Barry M. Bleackley C.R. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 401-409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GrA cleaves after basic residues, appears to cause single-stranded DNA breaks, and disrupts repair mechanisms in the target cell, leading to caspase-independent death (4Fan Z. Beresford P.J. Zhang D. Xu Z. Novina C.D. Yoshida A. Pommier Y. Lieberman J. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). By contrast, GrB has an unusual preference for cleaving after Asp and is thought to act like an apical caspase in triggering classical apoptosis (2Barry M. Bleackley C.R. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 401-409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The role of GrB in cell-mediated immunity is supported by the phenotype of GrB-deficient mice, which produce CLs that cannot induce rapid DNA degradation in target cells, although killing still occurs, possibly via other granzymes (5Heussel J.W. Wesselschmidt R.L. Shresta S. Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 977-987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Furthermore, apoptosis of transplanted allogeneic hepatocytes in rats is reduced by treatment with GrB inhibitors (6Song E. Chen J. Su F. Wang M. Heeman U. Transplant Proc. 2001; 33: 3274-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), elevated GrB serum levels occur in several diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, and GrB is implicated in the generation of autoimmune antigens (7Casciola-Rosen L. Andrade F. Ulanet D. Bang Wong W. Rosen A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 815-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The importance of the granule pathway to CL function is illustrated by familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, a rare congenital immune deficiency syndrome that is fatal unless treated by bone marrow transplantation. Approximately 20% of familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis patients have severely reduced CL activity because of mutation of the perforin gene (8Stepp S.E. Dufourcq-Lagelouse R. Le Deist F. Bhawan S. Certain S. Mathew P.A. Henter J.I. Fischer A. de Saint Basile G. Kumar V. Science. 1999; 286: 1957-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Although granzyme deficiency has not been associated with familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (9Ericson K.G. Fadeel B. Andersson M. Gudmundsson G.H. Gurgey A. Yalman N. Janka G. Nordenskjold M. Henter J.I. Hum. Genet. 2003; 112: 98-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), it was recently reported that 25–30% of the population carries a triple-mutated (Q48R, P88A, Y245H (RAH)) allele of GrB and that the product of this allele is incapable of inducing apoptosis (10McIlroy D. Cartron P.-F. Tuffery P. Dudoit Y. Samri A. Autran B. Vallette F.M. Debre P. Theodorou I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2562-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cytotoxic lymphocytes from RAH homozygotes produce normal amounts of GrB and have normal lytic activity. By contrast, expression of the RAH mutant in transfected tumor cell lines does not induce apoptosis (10McIlroy D. Cartron P.-F. Tuffery P. Dudoit Y. Samri A. Autran B. Vallette F.M. Debre P. Theodorou I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2562-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To explain these results, it was proposed that CLs from RAH homozygotes use GrB-independent pathways to kill targets and that either the RAH variant is catalytically inactive against key proapoptotic substrates such as Bid and procaspase 3 or it is sequestered within the cell and cannot access these substrates. However, the RAH variant was not biochemically characterized in this study, nor was its ability to kill cells examined by delivering it exogenously with perforin. The latter point is important because the physiologically relevant pathway for GrB cytotoxicity involves internalization of GrB by the target cell and perforin-mediated release of GrB into the cytoplasm (3Froelich C.J. Orth K. Turbov J. Seth P. Gottleib R. Babior B. Shah G.M. Bleackley R.C. Dixit V.M. Hanna W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29073-29079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 11Pinkoski M.J. Hobman M. Heibein J.A. Tomaselli K. Li F. Seth P. Froelich C.J. Bleackley R.C. Blood. 1998; 92: 1044-1054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the GrB and RAH forms expressed in the tumor cell line were engineered to be synthesized in active conformations, which do not reflect the situation in vivo because GrB is usually produced as an inactive zymogen that is activated only when it reaches a dedicated storage compartment (12Caputo A. Garner R.S. Winkler U. Hudig D. Bleackley R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17672-17675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Griffiths G.M. Semin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Because reduced granzyme B activity in RAH carriers would be predicted to lower their antiviral immunity, it is important to carefully examine the cytotoxic potential of the RAH variant. We show here that GrB activity in RAH carriers is indistinguishable from wild type GrB, both biochemically and in perforin-mediated cytotoxicity. Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism Analysis—DNA was isolated from 50 ml of whole blood using a PUREGENE kit from Gentra Systems. PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism analysis, described previously (14Hayashi K. PCR Methods Appl. 1991; 1: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar), was carried out using human GrB exon-specific primers. Preparation of Native and Recombinant GrB—Native GrB was prepared from isolated cytotoxic lymphocyte granules as described (15Trapani J.A. Browne K.A. Dawson M.J. Smyth M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 910-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Recombinant wild type and RAH GrB were produced as zymogens in Pichia pastoris and activated following methods described previously (16Sun J. Bird C.H. Buzza M.S. McKee K.E. Whisstock J.C. Bird P.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), except that the His tag was incorporated upstream of the enterokinase cleavage site, which allowed simultaneous activation of the zymogen and removal of the His tag. The RAH mutations were introduced into the wild type GrB sequence using an overlapping PCR strategy. The mutated DNA was completely sequenced, cloned into the expression vector pPIC9 (Invitrogen), and used to transform P. pastoris. Transformants were analyzed for zymogen production, and one was chosen for further study. To confirm the presence of the RAH mutations, GrB sequences were amplified from this transformant and resequenced. Activity of GrB—The activity of wild type and RAH GrB on peptide and protein substrates and their interactions with the serpin PI-9 were analyzed as described (17Sun J. Whisstock J.C. Harriott P. Walker B. Novak A. Thompson P.E. Smith A.I. Bird P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15177-15184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In vitro transcription and translation of mouse procaspase 3 and Bid was carried out as described (16Sun J. Bird C.H. Buzza M.S. McKee K.E. Whisstock J.C. Bird P.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), using the Promega TnT system. One unit of granzyme B activity is defined as the mass of granzyme B required to cause an increase of 0.001 A405 nm/min in the hydrolysis of the substrate Boc-AAD-thiobenzyl ester (50 μm) (18Odake S. Kam C.M. Narasimhan L. Poe M. Blake J.T. Krahenbuhl O. Tschopp J. Powers J.C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2217-2227Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) in a 200-μl reaction at 37 °C. In the preparations used in this study, the specific activity of recombinant wild type GrB was 82 units/μg, RAH GrB was 131 units/μg, and native GrB was 29 units/μg protein. Preparation of Lymphokine-activated Killer (LAK) Cells and 51Cr-labeled Release Assays—Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated, cultured in interleukin-2, and used in standard 4-h cytotoxicity assays essentially as described (19Bird C.H. Sutton V.R. Sun J. Hirst C.E. Novak A. Trapani J.A. Bird P.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6387-6398Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Perforin-mediated Cytotoxicity—Recombinant mouse perforin prepared as described (20Liu C.C. Persechini P.M. Young J.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) was used to mediate the delivery of GrB into human cells. Jurkat cells were washed twice in a modified Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, and 0.4% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (fraction V, JRH Biosciences) and resuspended at 4 × 106 cells/ml. A sublytic concentration of perforin was determined empirically by diluting perforin in HE buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2) containing 4 mm CaCl2 and adding it to an equal volume of the cells in modified Hanks' balanced salt solution. After 30 min at 37 °C, the number of cells permeabilized by the perforin was determined by counting propidium iodide-positive cells. A suitable dilution of perforin permeabilized approximately 10% of the population. The amount of each granzyme required to kill 50% of the cells (EC50) was determined by preparing serial 2-fold dilutions of the granzyme in 50-μl aliquots of the cells in modified Hanks' balanced salt solution. 50 μl of the appropriate dilution of perforin in HE/CaCl2 was then added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The perforin and granzyme B were then removed from the cells by washing in complete medium, and the cells were resuspended in 200 μl and plated in 96-well trays (2 × 100 μl for each point) in complete medium. After 4 h at 37 °C, the proportion of surviving cells was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. The results (A595) were plotted against log10 GrB units/ml using the Prism 3.0 computer program. Frequency of the RAH Allele and Function of RAH CLs— McIlroy et al. (10McIlroy D. Cartron P.-F. Tuffery P. Dudoit Y. Samri A. Autran B. Vallette F.M. Debre P. Theodorou I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2562-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) comprehensively screened various racial groups for GrB RAH heterozygotes and homozygotes and found an allelic frequency of 25–30%. The wild type QPY allele was found at frequencies of 54–71%. We screened 28 individuals for these alleles by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and found 18 QPY/QPY homozygotes, 8 QPY/RAH heterozygotes, and 1 RAH/RAH homozygote (data not shown). These frequencies are similar to those reported by McIlroy et al. (10McIlroy D. Cartron P.-F. Tuffery P. Dudoit Y. Samri A. Autran B. Vallette F.M. Debre P. Theodorou I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2562-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To assess the cytolytic potential of CLs from these individuals, freshly isolated, unstimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells were used as effectors in conventional cytotoxicity assays to measure natural killer cell activity. Using K562 cells as targets, no difference in cytotoxicity was evident in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from QPY homozygous, QPY heterozygous, or RAH homozygous individuals, indicating that natural killer cell function is unaffected by the RAH mutations (data not shown). We also cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells for 5 days in the presence of interleukin-2, which promotes the development of LAK cells. These cells kill targets via the calcium-dependent perforin/granzyme pathway and do not use the death receptor pathway. This is illustrated in Fig. 1A, where killing of K562 cells by LAKs in a cytotoxicity assay is completely abrogated by EGTA. As shown in Fig. 1B, there was no significant difference in cytotoxicity of LAKs from QPY homozygous, QPY heterozygous, or RAH homozygous individuals when K562 cells were used as targets. Similar results were obtained when Daudi and Raji cells were used as targets (data not shown). Thus the RAH GrB mutations have no appreciable effect on perforin/granzyme-mediated killing by CLs. Production of Recombinant GrB Containing the RAH Mutations—To study the impact of the RAH mutations on GrB function, we produced recombinant RAH GrB in a P. pastoris system. As described previously (16Sun J. Bird C.H. Buzza M.S. McKee K.E. Whisstock J.C. Bird P.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the protease was produced as a His-tagged zymogen and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography from the culture medium. Activation of the zymogen was achieved by incubation with enterokinase, which removes an amino-terminal sequence comprising the yeast α-factor propeptide, His tag, and enterokinase recognition site, thus exposing the amino terminus of mature GrB (Fig. 2A). Similar expression levels of wild type and RAH GrB were achieved using this system (∼1 mg of purified protease per liter of culture supernatant). Activity of the RAH Variant on Peptide and Protein Substrates—Activity of the enterokinase-activated GrB was assessed by cleavage of the conventional tripeptide substrate, Boc-AAD-thiobenzyl ester (18Odake S. Kam C.M. Narasimhan L. Poe M. Blake J.T. Krahenbuhl O. Tschopp J. Powers J.C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2217-2227Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B, both enzymes cleaved the substrate efficiently, suggesting that the RAH mutations have little or no impact on activity. Similar activities were seen on the newer substrate IETD-p-nitroanilide (data not shown). To compare the activities of the enzymes in more detail, cleavage of the substrate Abz-IEPDSSMESK-2,4-dinitrophenol (17Sun J. Whisstock J.C. Harriott P. Walker B. Novak A. Thompson P.E. Smith A.I.

Open table in a new tab To assess cleavage of authentic GrB protein substrates, Bid and procaspase 3 were produced by in vitro transcription/translation and incubated with varying concentrations of wild type and RAH GrB.

Inhibition of the RAH Variant by PI-9 —GrB is regulated in vivo by the intracellular serpin, PI-9, which protects CLs, dendritic cells, and bystanders against ectopic or misdirected GrB (19Bird C.H.

The interaction between GrB and PI-9 results in the formation of a stable complex that can be visualized by SDS-PAGE (17Sun J. Whisstock J.C. Harriott P. Walker B. Novak A. Thompson P.E. Smith A.I.

As shown in Fig. 3B, the RAH variant retains the ability to form a complex with PI-9, and the rate of RAH GrB inhibition by PI-9 is indistinguishable from the rate of inhibition of wild type GrB by PI-9 (Table I). Thus, the RAH mutations do not affect the ability of GrB to interact with PI-9. Perforin-mediated Cytotoxicity of the RAH Variant—The generally accepted model for GrB-mediated cytotoxicity involves release of GrB and perforin into the intermembrane space between the CL and target cell (1Trapani J.A. Smyth M.J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 735-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). Endocytosis of GrB and perforin by the target cell is followed by disruption of an endocytic compartment by perforin, which releases GrB into the cytoplasm and triggers apoptosis (3Froelich C.J. Orth K. Turbov J. Seth P. Gottleib R. Babior B. Shah G.M. Bleackley R.C. Dixit V.M. Hanna W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29073-29079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), (11Pinkoski M.J. Hobman M. Heibein J.A. Tomaselli K. Li F. Seth P. Froelich C.J. Bleackley R.C. Blood. 1998; 92: 1044-1054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation of cultured cells with exogenous, purified GrB and perforin alone is sufficient to rapidly induce death (24Shi L. Kraut R.P. Aebersold R. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the mannose 6-phosphate receptor is involved in the uptake of GrB into target cells (25Motyka B. Korbutt G. Pinkoski M.J. Heibein J.A. Caputo A. Hobman M. Barry M. Shostak I. Sawchuk T. Holmes C.F.B. Gauldie J. Bleackley R.C. Cell. 2000; 103: 491-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 26Trapani J.A. Sutton V.R. Thia K.Y. Li Y.Q. Froelich C.J. Jans D.A. Sandrin M.S. Browne K.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To ensure that potential glycosylation differences between recombinant (from yeast) and native GrB do not result in differences in potency, we first compared the ability of these two forms of GrB to kill Jurkat cells in the presence of sublytic amounts of perforin. As shown in Fig. 4A, recombinant wild type GrB was indistinguishable from native GrB, both in the shape of the dose-response curve and EC50. We then compared recombinant wild type GrB to the RAH variant. As shown in Fig. 4B, the cytotoxicity of these two forms was identical. We conclude that the RAH mutations do not affect perforin-mediated cytotoxicity of GrB. The physiological function and significance of a particular protein is often gauged by the study of naturally occurring mutants or by reverse genetics involving the generation of knockout mice. For example, the importance of perforin has been amply illustrated by the fatal consequences of its lack or dysfunction in familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis disease (8Stepp S.E. Dufourcq-Lagelouse R. Le Deist F. Bhawan S. Certain S. Mathew P.A. Henter J.I. Fischer A. de Saint Basile G. Kumar V. Science. 1999; 286: 1957-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and by the immunocompromised phenotype of knockout mice (27Kagi D. Ledermann B. Burki K. Seiler P. Odermatt B. Olsen K.J. Podack E.R. Zinkernagel R.M. Hengartner H. Nature. 1994; 369: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar). Unlike perforin, the importance of GrB to humans remains unclear, despite the wealth of in vitro data suggesting it has a pivotal role in CL-mediated cytotoxicity (for reviews see Refs. 1Trapani J.A. Smyth M.J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 735-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar and 2Barry M. Bleackley C.R. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 401-409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are no human GrB mutants, and the in vitro data are not supported by the mild phenotype of GrB knockout mice (5Heussel J.W. Wesselschmidt R.L. Shresta S. Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 977-987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar), which are defective in CL-mediated DNA degradation in target cells but otherwise are not significantly immunocompromised. Granzyme A and/or other mouse paralogs probably compensate for the loss of GrB in this context, so it is difficult to draw conclusions from this mouse model about the function of human GrB in humans. Before the description of the RAH allele there had been no report of naturally occurring human GrB variants, and the initial conclusion that this allele encodes a common, non-cytotoxic form of GrB suggested that a fundamental shift in thinking about the role(s) of this protease was required (10McIlroy D. Cartron P.-F. Tuffery P. Dudoit Y. Samri A. Autran B. Vallette F.M. Debre P. Theodorou I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2562-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, purified RAH and wild type enzymes were not compared in this study, and the assay used to assess GrB cytotoxicity was unconventional, involving the production of active GrB within target cells and coupled with its perforin-independent release from the secretory pathway into the nucleocytoplasm via an unknown mechanism (10McIlroy D. Cartron P.-F. Tuffery P. Dudoit Y. Samri A. Autran B. Vallette F.M. Debre P. Theodorou I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2562-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This contrasts with the usual mode of GrB delivery (following zymogen activation in the CL granule), which involves release of GrB from the CL, endocytosis by the target cell, and perforin-mediated entry into the cytoplasm (reviewed in Ref. 1Trapani J.A. Smyth M.J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 735-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although the RAH mutations are clearly in linkage disequilibrium (10McIlroy D. Cartron P.-F. Tuffery P. Dudoit Y. Samri A. Autran B. Vallette F.M. Debre P. Theodorou I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2562-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that a dysfunctional GrB allele occurring at this frequency would have arisen through natural selection. Using purified, recombinant enzymes and conventional assays, the work we report here clearly shows that RAH GrB retains the biochemical and cytotoxic functions of wild type GrB. We conclude that in the context of the documented functions of GrB the RAH allele represents a neutral polymorphism. Thus, the physiological significance of human GrB remains to be determined. We thank Dr. James Powers (Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta) for the generous gift of the granzyme B Boc-AAD-thiobenzyl ester substrate."

Virology. 1984; 134: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), it has been shown that adenovirus can provide full helper function for AAV5 genome replication (3Bantel-Schaal U. zur Hausen H. Virology. 1984; 134: 52-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The AAV5 genome is transcribed using three primary promoters (P7, P19, and P41, designated by their map unit location; see Fig. 1) and a weak initiator that lies within the inverted terminal repeat (4Qiu J. Nayak R. Tullis G.E. Pintel D.J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12435-12447Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The P7- and P19-generated RNAs encode the large and small Rep proteins, respectively, from the large open reading frame in the 5′ half of the genome. These RNAs utilize a polyadenylation site ((pA)p) within the single intron in the center of the genome at high efficiency. P7- and P19-generated RNAs polyadenylated at (pA)p are not spliced, and so the polyadenylation site choice for these AAV5 RNAs is independent of an upstream 3′ splice site. In contrast, RNAs generated from the P41 promoter, which lies only 78 nt upstream of the AAV5 intron, utilize (pA)p at significantly reduced efficiency. The P41-generated RNAs primarily read through (pA)p, are polyadenylated at a site at the 3′ end of the genome ((pA)d), and accumulate as spliced mRNAs. These mRNAs encode the viral capsid proteins from the large open reading frame in the 3′ half of the genome. Unspliced P41-generated RNAs that utilize either (pA)p or (pA)d are present in the cytoplasm of infected cells; however, they have not been shown to encode functional protein products. Polyadenylation of AAV5 RNA at (pA)p depends upon a consensus AAUAAA signal at nt 2177, which is immediately upstream of the first intron acceptor A1, which lies at nt 2204 (see Fig. 1). RNA cleavage and polyadenylation occurs 11–14 nt downstream of the first AAUAAA motif (4Qiu J. Nayak R. Tullis G.E. Pintel D.J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12435-12447Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Efficient polyadenylation at (pA)p requires both a downstream element that lies within the A2 3′ splice site and an upstream element that is located within the P7- and P19-generated RNAs but upstream of the P41 promoter (5Qiu J. Nayak R. Pintel D.J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). There are a number of examples in which the binding of splicing factors affect 3′-terminal cleavage and/or poly(A) addition. Perhaps the best studied examples involve U1 snRNP interactions at 5′ splice donor sites. There are at least two well characterized systems in which 5′ splice sites have been shown to have an inhibitory effect on polyadenylation. The first case involves the regulation of expression of papillomavirus late genes, which is governed at least partially by the regulation of polyadenylation. In undifferentiated epithelial cells, a cryptic splice donor site upstream of the late polyadenylation site inhibits poly(A) addition but not pre-mRNA cleavage (6Barksdale S. Baker C.C. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6553-6556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following U1snRNP binding to the cryptic donor site, the U1 70-kDa protein, when bound to U1snRNA, interacts with and inhibits the poly(A) polymerase (7Gunderson S.I. Polycarpou-Schwarz M. Mattaj I.W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 255-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In the second example, read-through of the proximal polyadenylation signal in the upstream long terminal repeat (LTR) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is due to inhibition of that site by a downstream intron donor (8Ashe M.P. Pearson L.H. Proudfoot N.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5752-5763Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The mechanism of this inhibition is not fully clear. It has been proposed that U1 snRNP binding directly to this 5′ donor sequence inhibits recognition of the pre-mRNA by the polyadenylation machinery (9Ashe M.P. Griffin P. James W. Proudfoot N.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3008-3025Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, U1 snRNP was found to inhibit cleavage when bound toa5′ splice site downstream of the poly(A) site in HIV LTR (8Ashe M.P. Pearson L.H. Proudfoot N.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5752-5763Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and the stem-loop structure of U1 snRNA, which binds U1 70-kDa, was required for poly(A) site occlusion (10Ashe M.P. Furger A. Proudfoot N.J. RNA. 2000; 6: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The requirement for interaction between U1A, U1 70-kDa, and poly(A) polymerase could not, however, be demonstrated in vitro (11Vagner S. Rüegsegger U. Gunderson S.I. Keller W. Mattaj I.W. RNA. 2000; 6: 178-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it has also been proposed that U1 snRNP prevents 5′ exon definition by interfering with the cap-binding complex (8Ashe M.P. Pearson L.H. Proudfoot N.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5752-5763Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 9Ashe M.P. Griffin P. James W. Proudfoot N.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3008-3025Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Conversely, U1 snRNP has also been shown to enhance polyadenylation. The U1A protein has been shown to interact with and stabilize cleavage and polyadenylation stimulating factor binding, which stimulates simian virus 40 late RNA 3′ end formation (12Lutz C.S. Alwine J.C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 576-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 13Lutz C.S. Murthy K.G. Schek N. O'Connor J.P. Manley J.L. Alwine J.C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 325-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In another example, efficient recognition of the polyadenylation site in exon 4 of the CT/CGRP gene is dependent on the U1snRNP binding to a pseudo 5′ splice site downstream of this poly(A) site; it is likely that the U1A protein is involved in this process (14Lou H. Gagel R.F. Berget S.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 208-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In this manuscript we show that the alternative polyadenylation at (pA)p of AAV5 RNAs depends upon the distance between the RNA initiation site and the central intron and (pA)p site. The steady-state levels of RNAs polyadenylated at (pA)p was independent of the nature of the promoter or the intervening sequences; however, it was dependent upon competition with splicing, inhibition by U1 snRNP binding to the intervening donor, and the intrinsic efficiency of the cleavage/polyadenylation reaction. Each of these determinants of (pA)p usage showed a marked distance effect. Unlike other reported systems, inhibition of (pA)p by U1 snRNP was reduced when the distance between the U1 snRNP-binding donor and (pA)p was increased. 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal calf serum in 5% CO2 at 37 °C Mutations in P41Cap Minimal Construct and the U1 RNA Mutants— The 5′ splice site (donor) mutations in P41Cap minimal construct and the U1 RNA mutants were constructed as follows. In the P41CapDms, P41CapDm1, and P41CapDm10 constructs, the donor site was mutated to as shown in Fig. 2. Those donor mutations were also moved into the P41CapA2CAA plasmid, in which the cleavage site of the A2 3′ splice site (CAG) was changed to be CAA, which inhibits splicing of the AAV5 intron to either acceptor 1 or 2, 2J. Qiu, C. Ye, and D. J. Pintel, unpublished data. thus creating the P41CapA2CAADms, P41CapA2CAADm1, and P41CapA2CAADm10 plasmids. U1 snRNA Mutants—To construct U1 snRNA mutants, the U1 donor binding sequence (3′-GUCCAUUCA-5′) in U1 RNA-expressing pUC13U1 (a gift from Alan Weiner, University of Washington, Seattle (15Zhuang Y. Weiner A.M. Cell. 1986; 46: 827-835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar)) was mutated to GUUAACUG, GGCAAUGCU, UUGCAUACU, and UGGAAUACU to generate, respectively, U1S, U1ms, U1m1, and U1m10. Distance Constructs—P7Cap, P7Rep530Cap, P7Repn720Cap, P7Repn890Cap, P7Repn1260Cap, and P7Repn1630Cap plasmids were constructed by deletion, from the parent pAV5RepCap plasmid (4Qiu J. Nayak R. Tullis G.E. Pintel D.J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12435-12447Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), of the rep gene region sequence from nt 359, 532, 720, 896, 1266, and 1635 to nt 1974, respectively (AAV5 sequence GenBank™ accession number AF085716). Mutation of the A2 acceptor from CAG to CAA in these plasmids placed these mutations in a splicing-negative background, creating P7CapA2CAA, P7Rep530CapA2CAA, P7Repn720CapA2CAA, P7Repn890CapA2CAA, P7Repn1260A2CAA, and P7Repn1630A2CAA. P7J330Cap, P7J700Cap, P7J1070Cap, and P7J1250Cap were made by insertion of prokaryotic pBR322 sequence (GenBank™ accession number J01749) (nt 35–369, 35–738, 35–1108, and 35–1284) between the P7 promoter and the intron in the minimal P7Cap plasmid. P7J330CapA2CAA, P7J700CapA2CAA, P7J1070CapA2CAA, and P7J1250CapA2CAA were created by mutation of the A2 acceptor from CAG to CAA in these plasmids. P7JCap and P7JCapA2CAA were described previously (5Qiu J. Nayak R. Pintel D.J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). P41J330CapA2CAA, P41J700CapA2CAA, P41J1250CapA2CAA, and P41J1650CapA2CAA were generated by replacement of P7 with P41 in the plasmids described above. P41J530CapA2CAA was created by insertion of prokaryotic pBR322 sequence (nt 1114–1648) between P41 and the intron in P41CapA2CAA. HIV LTR, AAV2 P5, and CMV IE promoters were replaced the P7 promoter both in P7CapA2CAA and P7JCapA2CAA, creating HIVLTRCapA2CAA, HIVLTRJ1650CapA2CAA, P5CapA2CAA, P5J1650CapA2CAA, CMVIECapA2CAA, and CMVIEJ1650CapA2CAA plasmids. The same prokaryotic pBR322 sequences were also inserted between P7 promoter and the intron in P41CapA2CAADm1 to create P41J330CapA2CAADm1, P7J530CapA2CAADm1, P7J700CapA2CAADm1, P7J1250CapA2CAADm1, and P7J1650CapA2CAADm1. To create plasmids P41DJ330CapA2CAA, P41DJ700CapA2CAA, P41DJ1250CapA2CAA, and P41DJ1650CapA2CAA, the same prokaryotic pBR322 sequences were inserted between nt 2113 and 2114 (AAV5 sequence) after the donor site in P41CapA2CAA. P41DJ170CapA2CAA and P41DJ260CapA2CAA were constructed by insertion of pBR322 DNA (nt 1380–1648 and 1114–1248). (pA)p Mutation Constructs—P7CapSMpA, P7J700CapSMpA, P7J1250CapSMpA, and P7J1650CapSMpA were constructed by silent mutation of the (pA)p site (5Qiu J. Nayak R. Pintel D.J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) in P7Cap, P7J700Cap, P7J1250Cap, and P7JCap. P7J170CapSMpA and P7J530CapSMpA were constructed by insertion of prokaryotic pBR322 sequence (nt 1114–1284 and 1114–1648) between the P7 promoter and the intron in P7CapSMpA. Similar constructs driven by the P41 promoter (P41CapSMpA, P41J170CapSMpA, P41J530CapSMpA, P41J700CapSMpA, P41J1250CapSMpA, and P41J1650CapSMpA) were generated by replacement of the P7 promoter in the plasmids described above. Probe Constructs—All of the probes used for RNase protection assays were homologous to the reporter construct being tested. The DH probe, which covers the (pA)p site and intron acceptors, was described previously (4Qiu J. Nayak R. Tullis G.E. Pintel D.J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12435-12447Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). All of the homologous DH probe clones were created by insertion of PCR DNA from the constructs that contained the mutations in the DH probe region (nt 1994–2341) into pGEM3Z using BamHI and HindIII linkers. The restriction fragments used to reintroduce PCR-generated mutations back into the parent plasmids were completely sequenced at the DNA Core Facility at the University of Missouri-Columbia to confirm that only desired mutations were present. Plasmid DNA (2 μg/60 mm plate) was transiently transfected into 60–80% confluent 293 cells using LipofectAMINE and the Plus reagent (Invitrogen) as described previously (16Qiu J. Pintel D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3639-3652Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Where mentioned either the wild-type U1 or the U1 variant plasmids were co-transfected. Total RNA was isolated 36–40 h later by using guanidine isothiocyanate as described previously (17Schoborg R.V. Pintel D.J. Virology. 1991; 181: 22-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). RNase protections were performed as described before (17Schoborg R.V. Pintel D.J. Virology. 1991; 181: 22-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 18Mouw M. Pintel D.J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9878-9888Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 19Naeger L.K. Schoborg R.V. Zhao Q. Tullis G.E. Pintel D.J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1107-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). All of the DH probe templates were generated by EcoRI linearization of the pGEM3ZDH plasmids. The probes were produced by in vitro transcription by using Sp6 polymerase. RPA signal was quantified with the Molecular Image FX machine and Quantity one (version 4.2.2) images software (Bio-Rad). The relative molecular ratios of individual species of RNAs were determined after adjusting for the number of 32P-labeled uridine in each protected band as described previously (17Schoborg R.V. Pintel D.J. Virology. 1991; 181: 22-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The percentage of (pA)p was calculated by dividing the adjusted signal from the (pA)p band with the adjusted signals from all of the bands (5Qiu J. Nayak R. Pintel D.J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Polyadenylation of P41-driven Transcripts at (pA)p Is Inhibited by U1snRNP Binding to the Intervening Donor—During AAV5 infection, greater than 95% of P7- and P19-derived transcripts polyadenylate at (pA)p, which lies within the AAV5 intron (Fig. 1). In contrast, ∼75% of transcripts generated by the P41 promoter, which lies only 265 nt upstream of (pA)p, are polyadenylated at the 3′ end of the genome at ((pA)d) and subsequently spliced (4Qiu J. Nayak R. Tullis G.E. Pintel D.J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12435-12447Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 5Qiu J. Nayak R. Pintel D.J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Greater than 95% of P41-generated transcripts produced from nonreplicating constructs read through (pA)p (4Qiu J. Nayak R. Tullis G.E. Pintel D.J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12435-12447Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 5Qiu J. Nayak R. Pintel D.J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Because (pA)p lies within a functional intron and because in other systems U1snRNP interaction with RNA has been shown to influence polyadenylation at nearby sites, we investigated whether U1 snRNP binding to the AAV5 donor site influences polyadenylation at (pA)p. In minimal constructs expressing only the AAV5 P41 transcription unit, mutations of the intron donor, predicted to decrease the binding of endogenous U1 snRNA to that site, increased the relative amount of P41-driven RNA that was polyadenylated at (pA)p. This was true either when these mutations were introduced into an otherwise functional intron (P41CapDms, P41CapDm1, and P41Cap Dm10; Fig. 2, lanes 2–4) or within the background of an additional mutation of the intron 3′ A2 acceptor site, which has been shown (5Qiu J. Nayak R. Pintel D.J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) to abolish splicing of the intron to either acceptor (P41CapA2CAADms, P41apA2CAADm1, and P41CapA2CAADm10; Fig. 2, lanes 6–8). These results suggested that either the intron donor was itself part of an upstream element that directly inhibited (pA)p usage or alternatively that binding of the U1snRNP was acting to inhibit (pA)p usage. To distinguish between these two possibilities, two experiments were performed. First, a mutant U1snRNA gene (U1S), directed by complementary sequences to bind to a region 22 nt downstream of the donor, was co-transfected into cells with the P41-expressing constructs containing the mutagenized donors. In each case, inhibition of the usage of (pA)p was regained by addition of the mutant U1 snRNA gene competent for binding P41 RNA (Fig. 2, lanes 9–11), to levels seen for the A2 acceptor mutation alone (Fig. 2, lane 5). Interestingly, for P41CapDms, which has a wild-type intron splice acceptor, co-transfection of U1S snRNP resulted in an increase in the relative amount of spliced product (Fig. 2, lane 16) to levels similar to P41Cap (Fig. 2, lane 1), indicating that the U1S snRNP bound to the shifted binding site in a functionally competent manner. In the second experiment, individual mutant U1 snRNA genes, each made complementary to a donor mutation and so predicted to regain binding, were transfected with that mutant donor construct. In each of these cases the increased (pA)p usage caused by the original donor mutation was significantly suppressed by addition of the complementary U1snRNA gene (Fig. 2, lanes 12–14). Transfection of the wild-type U1 snRNA gene had no suppressing effect in these experiments (Fig. 2, lane 15). We conclude that U1snRNP binding to the intron donor inhibits polyadenylation of P41-generated transcripts at (pA)p. The Level of Polyadenylation at (pA)p of P7-driven RNAs Is Directly Proportional to the Distance between the Promoter and the Intron and Is Determined by Both Competition with Splicing and a Splicing-independent Mechanism—As mentioned above, P7-generated RNAs utilize (pA)p at high efficiency, whereas RNAs generated by the proximal P41 promoter primarily read through. To investigate this distance effect further, we generated two sets of constructs. In the first, various portions of the rep gene were deleted to move the P7 promoter closer to the intron donor site (Fig. 3, left panel). In the second set of constructs, the P7 promoter was placed at various distances upstream from the intron, using increasingly larger pieces of bacterial plasmid DNA as intervening sequence (Fig. 3, right panel). As the P7 promoter was positioned incrementally further upstream of the intron (and also (pA)p), with either native AAV5 (P7RepnCap series) or heterologous DNA of prokaryotic origin (P7JCap series) serving as the intervening sequences, polyadenylation at (pA)p increased, and the splicing of P7-generated RNA decreased (Fig. 3). Similar results were also obtained when the intervening sequence was either an inverted copy of the same prokaryotic heterologous sequence used in the P7JCap series of plasmids or sequence from phage lambda and also with a set of constructs analogous to the P7JCap series in which the P41 promoter rather than P7 was used (data not shown). These results indicated that the efficiency of polyadenylation at (pA)p was determined by the distance between the promoter and the intron rather than the promoter context or the nature of the intervening sequence (i.e. a cryptic 3′ splice site). The accumulation of AAV5 RNA polyadenylated at (pA)p at steady-state conditions should be a consequence of the intrinsic efficiency of cleavage and polyadenylation at (pA)p, the strength of inhibition by the intervening intron donor, and competition for precursor molecules by the splicing process. Because our previous experiments with AAV2 demonstrated that excision of the AAV2 intron was inversely proportional to the distance between the RNA start site and the intron donor (16Qiu J. Pintel D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3639-3652Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), we examined the effect on excision of the AAV5 intron in the absence of competition from polyadenylation at (pA)p. Similar to what was seen when both splicing and polyadenylation were allowed (Fig. 3), splicing of either P7 or P41 RNAs generated from a construct in which the (pA)p AAUAAA was destroyed was inversely proportional to the distance between the RNA initiation site and the intron (Fig. 4). When either the P7 or P41 promoters were close to the 5′ splice site (P41CapSMpA and P7CapSMpA in Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 7), splicing of those RNAs was strong; however, when the promoters were moved to the position of the native P7 (P41J1650CapSMpA and P7J1650CapSMpA in Fig. 4, lanes 6 and 12), splicing was poor. These results, which may reflect the efficiency of definition of the 5′ exon, indicated that, as for AAV2, the distance between the promoter and the intron also directly affected the splicing efficiency of the AAV5 intron in vivo. Therefore, the increased polyadenylation at AAV5 (pA)p, seen as the promoter is moved further upstream, may have been at least partially a consequence of reduced competition for precursor molecules because of a decrease in the splicing of transcripts generated from P7 at a distance. The same distance variants shown in Fig. 3 were then introduced in the background in which splicing was disabled by the A2 splice acceptor mutation. In these experiments, polyadenylation at (pA)p was also increased as the distance between the cap site and the intron donor and (pA)p was increased (Fig. 5), indicating that even when splicing was abolished, polyadenylation at (pA)p was governed by the distance between the cap site and the intron donor and (pA)p. Similar results were obtained with analogous constructs in which the P7 promoter was replaced by P41 (Fig. 6, left panel). One component, therefore, of the distance dependence of (pA)p usage in these experiments was splicing-independent and was either a direct distance dependence on the efficiency of (pA)p utilization or, alternatively, a reduction in binding of U1 snRNP to the donor as the distance between the promoter and the intron (and (pA)p) was increased. However, because in the absence of splicing, polyadenylation at (pA)p occurred at relatively closer distances than when splicing was permitted (compare Fig. 5 with Fig. 3), the distance effect on (pA)p usage was at least partially because of the decrease in splicing efficiency of RNAs generated from AAV5 promoters at farther distances upstream of the intron and (pA)p site. Polyadenylation at (pA)p of RNAs generated from the heterologous HIV LTR promoter, AAV2 P5 promoter, and the CMV IE promoters, within the splicing deficient background, showed a similar distance dependence (Fig. 6, right panel), confirming that these effects were promoter-independent.Fig. 6The distance dependence of polyadenylation at (pA)p is independent of the nature of the promoter and the intervening sequences. Plasmids with different size insertions of pBR322 DNA between the P41 promoter and the intron in the P41CapA2CAA (lanes 1–6) backgrounds and plasmids with heterologous promoters (HIV LTR, AAV2 P5, and CMV IE) either in the P41CapCAA or P41J1650CapCAA backbone (diagrammed on the right) were transfected into 293 cells. 36–40 h later, total RNAs were protected with the DHA2CAA probe, which is depicted under each diagram. Bands protected by the DHA2CAA probe from a representative experiment are shown and labeled on the left. Quantifications of the ratio of RNAs polyadenylated at (pA)p relative to the total RNAs are shown as averages with standard deviations and are the results of at least three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) That a distance effect was seen for polyadenylation at (pA)p in the absence of splicing and for splicing in the absence of (pA)p polyadenylation is consistent with a model in which U1 snRNP binding to the intron donor achieved the proper balance of processing P7 and P41 pre-mRNAs by governing both splicing of the intron and inhibition of polyadenylation at (pA)p. Polyadenylation at (pA)p Is Subject to a Modest Distance Effect Even When Mutation Abolishes U1 snRNP Binding to the Intron Donor—The results described above indicated that in the presence of a functional intron there was competition for precursor AAV5 pre-mRNAs between polyadenylation at (pA)p and splicing that was governed by the distance between the cap site and the intron and (pA)p. However, when splicing was abolished, polyadenylation at (pA)p was still governed by the distance between the cap site and the intron and (pA)p. This latter distance effect could be either due to an intrinsic increase in efficiency of the polyadenylation process as the polymerase complex traverses a longer distance or due to a decrease in U1 snRNP inhibition of (pA)p as this distance increases. The major component that determines the balance of correctly processed AAV5 mRNAs appears to be the interplay between splicing, which requires U1 binding to the donor, and inhibition of polyadenylation at (pA)p mediated by U1 snRNP binding to the donor. It has also been suggested, however, that increased abundance of poly(A) factors recruited to the elongation complex can overcome the U1 inhibition to (pA)p more efficiently (20Fong N. Bentley D.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1783-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 21Licatalosi D.D. Geiger G. Minet M. Schroeder S. Cilli K. McNeil J.B. Bentley D.L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1101-1111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The observation that ∼75% of RNAs generated by AAV5 P41 at its normal position are polyadenylated at (pA)p when U1 snRNP binding to the donor site is abolished (Fig. 2, lanes 6–8) suggested that any direct effect on the efficiency of cleavage and polyadenylation at (pA)p conferred by the distance between the cap site and the polyadenylation site must be small. However, such an effect could be demonstrated using constructs in which the U1 snRNP-binding site (donor site) was mutated in the group of P41CapCAADm1 distance constructs (Fig. 7). As seen before, when both acceptor and donor sites were abolished by mutation (P41CapA2CAADm1), RNAs generated from the P41 at its native position were polyadenylated efficiently (77%) at (pA)p (Figs. 2, lane 7, and 7). However, as the P41 promoter was positioned incrementally upstream to the position of native P7 promoter, polyadenylation (pA)p was increased by ∼12%. These results, which measured the efficiency of the cleavage and polyadenylation at (pA)p in the absence of competition for splicing or inhibition by U1 snRNP, demonstrated that the efficiency of polyadenylation at (pA)p itself decreased, albeit modestly, as the distance between the RNA initiation site and (pA)p was increased.

However, the role of the third conserved aspartate of these LDL-A modules in protein folding and ligand recognition has not been elucidated. In this report, using a model LDL-A module and several experimental approaches, we demonstrate that this acidic residue, like the other four conserved acidic residues, is involved in calcium-dependent protein folding. These results suggest an alternative calcium coordination conformation for the LDL-A modules. The proposed model provides a plausible explanation for the conservation of this acidic residue among the LDL-A modules.

Strickland D.K. Bakillah A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). One common feature of these proteins is that they all contain at least one modular domain (called complement-type repeat, or LDL-A module) of ∼40 residues in length, including six invariable cysteines and the C-terminal highly conserved acidic residue motif (DXXXDXXDXXDE). All together there are more than 1,000 known LDL-A modules found in a variety of proteins that are involved in diverse biological processes. In human LDL receptor, seven such imperfect repeats of LDL-A modules at the N terminus of the protein form the ligand binding domain, responsible for binding to its ligands, apoB and apoE (2Brown M.S.

Naturally occurring point mutations in any of the conserved acidic residues of the individual LDL-A modules of human LDL receptor can cause familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a genetic disease that ultimately leads to coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis (6Hobbs H.H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Hum. Mutat. 1992; 1: 445-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). One proposed mechanism for these conserved acidic residues of LDL receptor in ligand binding is to interact with the basic residues of its ligands via ionic interactions (2Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4306) Google Scholar, 7Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3351) Google Scholar, 8Sudhof T.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S.

Science. 1991; 252: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar).Structural analysis of individual LDL-A modules, and recently the entire ectodomain of human LDL receptor, by x-ray crystallography revealed another mechanism by which four conserved acidic acids exert their role in protein conformation and function of LDL-A modules and thus LDL receptors (10Fass D. Blacklow S. Kim P.S. Berger J.M. Nature. 1997; 388: 691-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 11Rudenko G. Henry L. Henderson K. Ichtchenko K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Deisenhofer J.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15127-15134Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Among the five conserved acidic residues, DXXXDXXDXXDE, the side chains of four of them (the first, second, fourth, and fifth acidic residues, in italics), with the carbonyl oxygen groups of two non-conserved residues, are involved in calcium coordination. Thus mutations of these residues in the LDL receptor can result in folding defects of LDL-A modules and thus the overall structure of the LDL receptor, which indirectly lead to an impaired ligand-binding phenotype and eventually heart disease. However, the available biochemical and structural information on LDL-A modules and the ectodomain of the LDL receptor cannot explain why the third acidic residue is also highly conserved and why substitutions of this residue in different LDL-A modules of LDL receptor cause FH.Tva is the cellular receptor for subgroup A of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV-A), and it is related to the LDL receptor superfamily because it contains a single LDL-A module of 40 amino acids in length within its extracellular region (13Bates P. Young J.A.T. Varmus H.E. Cell. 1993; 74: 1043-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Interaction between Tva and the RSV-A glycoprotein EnvA mediates viral entry. Tva specifically binds to the surface subunit (SU) of EnvA with high affinity, and this high affinity binding is important not only for viral attachment to the host cells but also important for receptor-triggered conformational changes on EnvA, which are essential for EnvA-mediated fusion between the viral and host membranes (14Balliet J.W. Berson J. D'Cruz C.M. Huang J. Crane J. Gilbert J.M. Bates P. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3054-3061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Gilbert J.M. Bates P. Varmus H.E. White J.M. J.

Extensive molecular and biochemical analysis of Tva/EnvA interaction has demonstrated that the viral interaction domain of Tva is solely determined by the LDL-A module (18Rong L. Bates P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4847-4853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Rong L. Gendron K. Bates P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8467-8472Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 20Rong L.

Virol. 1995; 69: 4261-4266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In this study, we examined the role of the third conserved acidic residue in protein folding and ligand binding using a model LDL-A module. This system is based on our previous work that demonstrated that the Tva LDL-A module can be functionally substituted by the human LDL receptor repeat 4 (hLDL-A4) with minor modifications (19Rong L. Gendron K. Bates P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8467-8472Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A unique and important aspect of this system is that several functional assays can be used to dissect the roles of individual residues in both protein folding and ligand recognition, in addition to the in vitro biochemical and structural analysis of individual LDL-A modules. This study reveals that the third conserved acidic residue, like other four acidic residues, is involved in calcium coordination and protein folding, providing a molecular explanation why this residue is conserved in the majority of hundreds of LDL-A modules, and why mutations of this residue in LDL receptor can lead to FH. Furthermore, binding kinetics analysis between the model LDL-A module and its ligand demonstrates that the second and third conserved residues of this LDL-A module are not directly involved in ligand binding. These results, although with potential caveats of a model system, should have broad implications in LDL-A module/ligand interactions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA Methodology—A chimeric construct (referred to as Chimera in this study) was generated by replacing the C1-C3 region of TL4GA19L/D23H (19Rong L. Gendron K. Bates P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8467-8472Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) with the corresponding region of the Tva LDL-A module by an overlapping PCR protocol. This construct was inserted into the LDL-A module of Tva using the myc-Tva backbone (19Rong L. Gendron K. Bates P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8467-8472Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The conserved acidic residues of Chimera were substituted with alanines either individually or in combinations (see Fig. 2A). All the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. These constructs were used for examining protein expression and viral receptor function in human embryonic kidney 293T cells by transient transfection as described previously (18Rong L. Bates P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4847-4853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Protein Expression and Viral Infection Assay—Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were transiently transfected with DNAs of Chimera and its mutants by the CaPO4 method as described previously (18Rong L. Bates P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4847-4853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transfected cells were lysed with Triton Lysis Buffer 48 h post-transfection, and protein expression of these constructs was examined by Western blotting following SDS-PAGE, using monoclonal antibody 9E10, which specifically recognizes the Myc tag portion of these proteins. Furthermore, to examine whether these proteins were expressed on the cell surface, transiently transfected 293T cells were subjected to flow cytometry. Briefly, 24 h post-transfection, cells were lifted, and 1 × 106 cells were washed three times with FACS buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% fetal bovine serum, and 0.1% sodium azide). Cells were resuspended in 100 μl of FACS buffer containing 1 μl of mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibody 9E10 and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The cells were then washed and resuspended in 100 μl of FACS buffer containing 1 μl of goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Finally, cells were washed and resuspended in 500 μl of FACS buffer containing 1 μl of propidium iodide. The samples were collected and analyzed using a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur flow cytometer and Cellquest software.To determine the viral receptor function of Chimera and its mutants, transiently transfected 293T cells were challenged with RCAS(A)AP, the recombinant RSV-A viruses, following a previous protocol (18Rong L. Bates P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4847-4853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The alkaline phosphatase-positive 293T cells were detected under a microscope after staining, enumerated, and presented as number of alkaline phosphatase-positive cells/per ml viral stock used.Expression and Characterization of the in Vitro Folding Properties of the LDL-A Proteins—The coding regions of the LDL-A modules of Chimera and its mutants were PCR-amplified using the DNA templates of these constructs in pcDNA-3. The amplified DNA fragments were digested with restriction endonucleases and cloned into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences), and the identity of each construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The LDL-A modules of Chimera and its mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins and purified by the GSH affinity column. After thrombin cleavage, the glutathione S-transferase portion was removed by the GSH affinity column, and the protein samples were further purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) following a previous protocol established by us (23Wang Q.Y. Dolmer K. Huang W. Gettins P.G. Rong L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2051-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).The purified proteins were refolded in the absence or presence of calcium following a published protocol (23Wang Q.Y. Dolmer K. Huang W. Gettins P.G. Rong L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2051-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and the folding properties of the LDL-A proteins were examined by reverse phase HPLC and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. Its Ca2+ binding affinity was measured by isothermal titration calorimeter (Microcal MSC), following a previous protocol with minor modifications. The purified LDL-A proteins were refolded in the absence or in the presence of different concentrations of CaCl2 (23Wang Q.Y. Dolmer K. Huang W. Gettins P.G. Rong L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2051-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Following the refolding reactions, the samples were analyzed by reverse phase HPLC on a Vydac C18 column operated at a flow rate of 3.00 ml/min, using a linear gradient of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 90% acetonitrile.The 15N-labeled LDL-A proteins were used to acquire the [1H-15N] HSQC spectra. Following the refolding step as described above, each protein sample was eluted by reverse phase HPLC, and individual peaks were collected and prepared for acquisition of two-dimensional MNR spectra as described previously (23Wang Q.Y. Dolmer K. Huang W. Gettins P.G. Rong L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2051-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, the NMR data were collected on a Bruker DRX600 spectrometer equipped with a pulse-field gradient accessory and operating at 600.13 MHz for 1H and were processed and analyzed using Triad 6.3. The central frequencies were 4.70 and 118 ppm for 1H and 15N, respectively.Determination of the Binding Kinetics by IAsys—A resonant mirror biosensor (IAsys Auto+, Affinity Sensors) with a carboxylate cuvette was used to determine the kinetic constants (ka and kd) and binding affinities (KD) of the LDL-A proteins with the SUA-rIgG, which was transiently expressed in 293T cells and purified from the supernatant (17Yu X. Wang Q.Y. Guo Y. Dolmer K. Young J.A. Gettins P.G. Rong L. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 7517-7526Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 21Zingler K. Young J.A.T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7510-7516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All the experiments were performed following a published protocol with modifications (17Yu X. Wang Q.Y. Guo Y. Dolmer K. Young J.A. Gettins P.G. Rong L. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 7517-7526Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, the LDL-A proteins were first refolded with calcium and then purified by reverse phase HPLC. The fractions of well folded LDL-A proteins, determined by two-dimensional NMR, were prepared and immobilized to the [1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide HCl/N hydroxysuccinimide]-activated carboxylate cuvettes following the manufacturer's protocol. The un-reacted N-hydroxysuccinimide esters and uncovered surface area were blocked by 2 mg/ml β-casein. The tightly associated but non-covalently bound protein was removed with 10 mm HCl. Binding of the SUA-rIgG protein to the immobilized LDL-A proteins was performed in phosphate-buffered saline with additional 100 mm NaCl (to minimize the nonspecific binding) with 250 μm CaCl2. The binding kinetics were examined by monitoring the association phase for 5 min and followed by monitoring the dissociation phase for 4 min. After each cycle, the cuvettes were regenerated with 100 mm HCl for 2-5 min. The binding cycle was repeated by using 6-8 different concentrations of the SUA-rIgG protein dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline, 100 mm NaCl with 250 μm CaCl2. The experimental data were processed using FASTfit software (Affinity Sensor). The association constant (ka) was calculated from the gradient of the plot of apparent rate constant (kon) versus the SUA-rIgG protein concentration, which was obtained by a linear fit. The dissociation constant (kd) was determined from the intercept of the konversus [ligate] plot. When data were poorly fitted to a single exponential phase, a double exponential phase was used to process the association and dissociation data. KD was obtained from KD = kd/ka.Molecular Modeling of the Tva LDL-A Module—The newly proposed calcium-dependent conformation of the Tva LDL-A module, shown in Fig. 5B, was calculated using DYANA (24Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar), a torsion angle dynamics annealing simulation program, following the same procedures as performed previously for the published structure of the Tva LDL-A module (25Wang Q.Y. Huang W. Dolmer K. Gettins P.G. Rong L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2848-2856Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), shown in Fig. 5A.Fig. 5A proposed model of two calcium-dependent conformations for LDL-A modules using the Tva LDL-A module as an example.A, calcium ion is coordinated by residues Asp-36 (D1), Asp-40 (D2), Asp-46 (D4), and Glu-47 (E5). B, calcium ion is coordinated by Asp-36, Asp-43 (D3), Asp-46, and Glu-47. The non-acidic residues involved in calcium coordination are Trp-33 and His-38 for both conformations. The structures are displayed using the program MOLMOL (34Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6468) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)RESULTSFive Acidic Residues Are Highly Conserved at the C Terminus of the LDL-A ModulesSequence analysis of the LDL-A modules from different members of the LDL receptor superfamily indicates that five acidic residues near the C terminus, DXXXDXXDXXDE, are highly conserved among the LDL-A modules, and they will be referred to as D1, D2, D3, D4, and E5, respectively, in this report. Examination of 132 LDL-A modules from human LDL receptor, very low density lipoprotein receptor, LRP, complements, perlecan, sortilin-related receptor, corin, enterokinase, membrane serine proteases 1 and 2, and Tva, the RSV-A receptor, revealed that D4 and E5 are present in all of the modules and thus are invariable. In contrast, residue variations are found at the three remaining positions. Substitution of the aspartic acid by an asparagine accounts for all the variations (25 of the 132 LDL-A modules) at the D1 position. However, although the total number of residue variations at the D2 and D3 positions is less than that at D1 (16 of 132 for D2, 9 of 132 for D3, respectively), other residues (His, Ser, Gln, Glu, Tyr, Thr, and Gly), in addition to asparagine, can be found at these positions. Fig. 1 shows the sequence alignment of 11 LDL-A modules. Because these positions are highly conserved among so many LDL-A modules, it is reasonable to hypothesize that all of these acidic residues play important roles in LDL-A folding and/or ligand binding.Fig. 1Amino acid sequence alignment of the LDL-A modules of the quail and chicken Tva, human LDL receptor, and LRP. The six invariable cysteines are boxed, and the five highly conserved acidic residues among LDL-A modules are highlighted by shadows and are labeled sequentially as D1, D2, D3, D4, and E5 at the bottom.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)An important role for four of the five conserved acidic residues has been elucidated elegantly by the x-ray crystal structure of human LDL-A5 (10Fass D. Blacklow S. Kim P.S. Berger J.M. Nature. 1997; 388: 691-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Residues Asp-25 (D1), Asp-29 (D2), Asp-35 (D4), and Glu-36 (E5) of LDL-A5 were shown to be involved in calcium coordination via their side chains, thus providing an explanation of why these acidic residues are conserved in LDL-A modules. In contrast, the role of D3 in LDL-A folding and function is not clear. Conservation of this residue in most LDL-A modules strongly suggests an important role. Furthermore, D3 mutations in human LDL receptor cause FH (6Hobbs H.H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Hum. Mutat. 1992; 1: 445-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). These data support the notion that D3 plays an important role in protein folding and/or function of LDL-A modules.Substitutions of Both the Second and Third Conserved Acidic Residues in the LDL-A Module Display a Defective Phenotype in Mediating RSV-A EntryIt has been demonstrated previously that the LDL-A module of Tva could be functionally replaced by the fourth LDL-A module (hLDL-A4) of human LDL receptor with a few substitutions to mediate RSV-A entry (19Rong L. Gendron K. Bates P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8467-8472Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In addition, the N-terminal region of the Tva LDL-A module (between cysteines 1 and 3) is also required for optimal receptor activity (26Rai T. Marble D. Rihani K. Rong L. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 683-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Thus, a chimeric construct, referred to as Chimera in this study, was generated by appending the C1-C3 region of the Tva LDL-A module with the C3-C6 region of the modified hLDL-A4 module (Fig. 2A), using myc-Tva backbone plasmid. This chimeric protein is indistinguishable from the wt Tva in mediating efficient RSV-A viral entry (see Fig. 2B) and, importantly, retains all of the aforementioned conserved acidic residues.Each of the five conserved acidic residues of Chimera, Asp-26 (D1), Asp-30 (D2), Asp-33 (D3), Asp-36 (D4), Glu-37 (E5), and Glu-32, which is not conserved among the LDL-A modules, was individually substituted by alanine (Fig. 2A). The effect of these mutations on RSV-A entry was determined by challenging the 293T cells transiently expressing these constructs with RCAS(A)-AP viral vector, a recombinant RSV-A virus that contains an alkaline phosphatase reporter gene (27Federspiel M.J. Bates P. Young J.A. Varmus H.E. Hughes S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11241-11245Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B, Chimera displays an indistinguishable phenotype from the wt myc-Tva in mediating RSV-A entry at three different plasmid concentrations (1, 5, and 20 μg, respectively) in transfection. As expected, substitution mutant of Glu-32, a nonconserved acidic residue, did not display a defective viral receptor phenotype (Fig. 2B). In contrast, mutants D26A, D36A, and E37A were 100-1000-fold less efficient than wt Tva or Chimera in mediating RSV-A entry, depending on the amounts of plasmid DNA used in transfection. These results are consistent with the notion that these residues are involved in calcium coordination; thus it is expected that substitution of these residues would cause protein misfolding, leading to the defected phenotype. However, surprisingly, substitution of Asp-30 (D30A), another conserved acidic residue implicated in calcium coordination, did not have a detectably adverse effect on the viral receptor function of Chimera (Fig. 2B), unlike that of the other three calcium coordination acidic residues. Similarly, substitution of the third conserved acidic residue (D33A) did not adversely affect the ability of Chimera to mediate efficient viral entry.Three double substitution mutants (D30A/E32A, D30A/D33A, and E32A/D33A) were generated to further investigate the potential role of the second and third conserved acidic residues in RSV-A entry (Fig. 2A). When 293T cells transiently expressing these mutant proteins were challenged with the recombinant RSV-A viruses, only mutant D30A/D33A displayed greatly impaired viral receptor function (∼3-4 logs lower than wt Tva). In contrast, the remaining two mutants (D30A/E32A and E32A/D33A) could still mediate efficient RSV-A entry at high DNA concentrations, and only displayed slightly lower receptor function at the lowest DNA concentration (1 μg) in transfection (Fig. 2B). These results appear to suggest that the role of the second and third conserved acidic residues is redundant in mediating RSV-A entry. However, as demonstrated below, substitution of each of these residues adversely affects calcium-dependent protein folding. This discrepancy between the viral receptor function and protein folding of this Chimera will be explained under “Discussion.”Total protein expression of Chimera and its mutants in 293T cells was examined by Western blotting, and it was found that all of the constructs were well expressed (data not shown). Furthermore, FACS analysis of surface expression of these proteins showed that they were all surface-expressed (data not shown), indicating that the defect of some Chimera mutants in mediating RSV-A entry is not due to problems of surface expression.Substitutions of Conserved Acidic Residues Result in Protein Folding Defects, HPLC ProfilesTo characterize further the roles of these conserved acidic residues in LDL-A folding, the LDL-A modules of Chimera and its mutants were expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Following thrombin cleavage and further purification, in vitro folding properties of the LDL-A modules of Chimera and its mutants were first examined by reverse phase HPLC after refolding in the presence or absence of calcium, following a protocol published previously.The Chimera protein was eluted as multiple peaks when CaCl2 was omitted in the refolding. In contrast, the same protein was eluted as a single sharp peak (labeled as peak 2) as the CaCl2 concentrations were increased from 2 to 10 or 50 mm in the refolding step (Fig. 3). These results are consistent with the notion that the correct folding of Chimera, like that of Tva and the other LDL-A modules characterized previously by others and us, is calcium-dependent. Similarly, substitution mutant of a non-conserved acidic residue (E32A) of Chimera gave an almost identical HPLC profile as Chimera, suggesting that Glu-32 is unlikely involved in calcium coordination.Fig. 3Elution profiles of the Chimera and its mutant proteins by reverse phase HPLC. The purified proteins were refolded in the absence or presence of ramping concentrations of CaCl2 (2, 10, and 50 mm, respectively) and subjected to reverse phase HPLC as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The individual peaks labeled in this figure were used for the two-dimensional NMR analysis shown in Fig. 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In contrast, the HPLC profiles of the substitution mutants of the five conserved acidic residues in Chimera showed that none of these mutant proteins was eluted as a single sharp peak even as the CaCl2 concentration was increased to 50 mm in the refolding step; instead, multiple peaks were eluted (Fig. 3). These results suggest that any individual substitution of these residues can adversely affect calcium-dependent protein folding. Because Asp-26, Asp-30, Asp-36, and Glu-37 have been implicated in calcium coordination, it is reasonable to assume that substitutions of these residues by alanines disrupted the native calcium cage of Chimera and thus resulted in protein misfolding. However, the elution profiles of mutants D30A and D33A are different from that of mutants D26A, D36A, and Glu-37. The proportion of peak fraction 4 (D30A) increased as more calcium was added in the refolding step (from 2 to 50 mm), whereas the percentage of other peaks such as peak fraction 5 became less prominent with higher concentrations of calcium. Similarly, the percentage of peak fraction 7 of D33A became more predominant than the other peaks (e.g. peak fraction 8) with higher concentrations of calcium.

SMA results from loss of survival motor neuron (SMN) expression and subsequent death of motor neuron cells. To study SMN-associated proteins that may be involved in transcriptional regulation, we carried out immunoprecipitation experiments and found that the transcription corepressor mSin3A associates with SMN protein. Deletional analysis localized the mSin3A-interacting domain to the exon 6 region of SMN. When targeted to a promoter, wild-type SMN was able to repress transcription of a downstream luciferase reporter gene. This repression was relieved by treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A in a dose-dependent manner, and deletion of exon 6 abolished the ability of SMN to repress the reporter gene. Analysis of SMN missense mutations within the exon 6 region implicated the SMA-associated mutation Y272C with impairment of the mSin3A-interaction. Gel filtration experiments revealed that wild-type SMN, via the exon 6 region, forms protein supra-complexes exceeding 40,000 kDa in size, whereas the Y272C mutation may affect higher order protein assembly, as the mutant SMN was more abundant in smaller complexes. Together, these findings provide a potential mechanism by which lack of fully functional SMN protein is detrimental to motor neuron survival.

SMA occurs with a frequency of 1 in 10,000 individuals and is the most common genetic cause of infant mortality (1Lefebvre S. Burglen L. Reboullet S. Clermont O. Burlet P. Viollet L. Benichou B.

Type I SMA is characterized by severe muscular problems in infancy, whereas type II and type III SMA are characterized by minor muscle weakness in adulthood. Independent of the age of onset, the clinical features are muscle weakness and hypotonia. SMA arises from deletion and/or mutation in the telomeric copy of the survival of motor neurons (SMN) gene (1Lefebvre S. Burglen L. Reboullet S. Clermont O. Burlet P. Viollet L. Benichou B. Cruaud C.

In this study, we report the first evidence that SMN also interacts with the transcription corepressor mSin3. Our deletion analysis reveals that the mSin3-interacting domain is encoded by exon 6 of SMN. In mammalian cells, mSin3 is expressed as the highly related mSin3A and mSin3B proteins (8Ayer D.E.

In light of findings from our group and others, it is possible that a subset of SMN protein may be involved in the repression of genes critical to motor neuron survival.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture—Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 1% l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C under 5% CO2.Plasmids—Myc-epitope-tagged expression plasmid pCS2-MT-SMN was generated by cloning full-length SMN cDNA in-frame into the EcoRI-XbaI sites of the pCS2-MT vector. SMN deletion mutants lacking exons 1, 5, 6, or 7 were generated by polymerase chain reaction and cloned in-frame into the same EcoRI-XbaI sites of pCS2-MT vector. Point mutations S262I, Y272C, T274I, G275S, and G279V were introduced into full-length SMN cDNA by the Gene Editor™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Promega). For generation of pCS2-Gal4-MT-SMN, the Gal4 DNA-binding domain was cloned in-frame into the unique ClaI site within the pCS2-MT-SMN vector.Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Two duplicate wells of 65% confluent 293 cells in 6-well plates were transfected with 500 ng of firefly luciferase reporter pG5-SP1-Luc (9Yang L. Mei Q. Zielinska-Kwiatkowska A. Matsui Y. Blackburn M.L. Benedetti D. Krumm A.A. Taborsky Jr., G.J. Chansky H.A. Biochem.

To assess inhibition of histone deacetylases, cells were treated with trichostatin A (TSA) at different concentrations 1 day before the luciferase assay. Transfection was repeated at least three times; the luciferase activity was normalized to the internal β-galactosidase or Renilla luciferase control and then compared with the luciferase activity from cells transfected with the pCS2-Gal4-MT empty vector.Antibodies—The rabbit polyclonal anti-mSin3A (K-20), anti-mSin3B (AK-12), anti-HDAC2 (C-19), and an unrelated rabbit polyclonal antihemagglutinin (HA) epitope (Y-11) were purchased form Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The mouse monoclonal anti-SMN antibody was purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA). The 9E10 mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibody was purchased from Sigma.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—1 × 106 293 cells were lysed in 0.4 ml buffer A (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma). 25 μl of the respective antibodies were incubated with 40 μl of protein A/G agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min at 4 °C in 0.2 ml of buffer A. The antibody-protein A/G-agarose complex was then incubated with 0.25 ml of fresh cell lysate for 6 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. After one 10-min wash with buffer A and two washes with RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS), 40 μl of 1× SDS sample buffer was added to the agarose beads and denatured at 96 °C for 5 min. 10 μl of the sample was loaded onto an SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel. After separation and transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride PVDF membrane, the protein samples were blotted with anti-SMN, anti-Myc, anti-HDAC2, or anti-mSin3A antibodies. Protein bands were visualized using the ECL Western blotting analysis system (Amersham Biosciences).Gel Filtration—0.4 ml of frozen lysate from 293 cells expressing wild-type or mutant SMN protein was thawed, loaded onto a Superose 6 10/300 GL high performance column and size-fractionated with the elution buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2) using a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). The eluent was collected at 0.5 ml/fraction, separated by SDS-PAGE, and blotted with an anti-SMN or anti-Myc antibody to detect fractions containing endogenous and Myc-epitope-tagged SMN proteins. The molecular sizes of protein complexes in the collection were calculated according to a chromatogram of standard markers provided by the manufacturer.RESULTSEndogenous SMN Interacts with mSin3/HDAC—A schematic of SMN protein is shown (Fig. 1A) with the indicated localizations of exons and SMA-associated point mutations. SMN is a ubiquitously expressed protein (15Coovert D.D. Le T.T. McAndrew P.E. Strasswimmer J. Crawford T.O. Mendell J.R. Coulson S.E. Androphy E.J. Prior T.W. Burghes A.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1205-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) and is abundant in 293 cells (Fig. 1B, lane 1, upper panel). To determine whether SMN protein is associated with mSin3 in vivo, 293 whole-cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with the rabbit K-20 anti-mSin3A antibody (Fig. 1B, lane 2) or with the rabbit AK-12 anti-mSin3B antibody (Fig. 1B, lane 3). When the immunoprecipitates were blotted with a mouse monoclonal anti-SMN antibody, it was found that both anti-mSin3A and anti-mSin3B antibodies were able to coimmunoprecipitate endogenous SMN protein. To ensure that this SMN-mSin3 interaction is specific, an unrelated rabbit polyclonal Y-11 anti-HA antibody was used in the same experiment and failed to coimmunoprecipitate SMN (Fig. 1B, lane 4).Because mSin3 is known to complex with other histone modification enzymes (9Yang L. Mei Q. Zielinska-Kwiatkowska A. Matsui Y. Blackburn M.L. Benedetti D. Krumm A.A. Taborsky Jr., G.J. Chansky H.A. Biochem.

Cell. 1997; 89: 357-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), we carried out experiments to address whether SMN can also associate with mSin3-interacting proteins such as HDACs. Lysate from 293 cells (Fig. 1C, lane 1) was immunoprecipitated with a goat polyclonal anti-HDAC2 (Fig. 1C, lane 2) or a control goat IgG (Fig. 1C, lane 3). The immunoprecipitates were then blotted with anti-SMN (Fig. 1C, top panel), anti-mSin3 (Fig. 1C, middle panel), or anti-HDAC2 (Fig. 1C, bottom panel). Western blotting revealed that the anti-HDAC2 antibody coimmunoprecipitated both mSin3A and SMN proteins, whereas the control goat IgG did not bring down either of them in the experiments. These findings suggest that a subset of SMN forms stable intracellular complexes with mSin3/HDAC.SMN-mSin3A Interaction Requires the Exon 6 Region of SMN Protein—In the next experiment, we sought to map the SMN subdomain(s) responsible for interacting with mSin3. Full-length SMN and SMN deletion mutants lacking exons 1, 5, 6, or 7 were cloned into the mammalian expression vector, pCS2-MT. A schematic representation of SMN deletion mutants is shown (Fig. 2A). After transfection of 293 cells with these SMN deletion constructs, the resultant lysates were incubated with K-20 antibody which can coimmunoprecipitate endogenous mSin3A and endogenous SMN (Fig. 1B). Myc-tagged full-length SMN and its deletion mutants were expressed in 293 cells, as confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 2B, lanes 2-6, upper panel). As expected, Myc-tagged full-length SMN was shown to associate with mSin3A (Fig. 2B, lane 2, middle panel). Removal of the N-terminal region encoded by exon 1 did not have a significant effect on the interaction between SMN and mSin3, as demonstrated by the presence of Myc-SMN-Δ1 in the anti-mSin3A immunoprecipitate (Fig. 2B, lane 3, middle panel). Although internal deletion of exon 5 did not affect mSin3A association with Myc-SMN-Δ5 (Fig. 2B, lane 4, middle panel), internal deletion of exon 6 abolished SMN-mSin3A interaction, as demonstrated by the absence of Myc-SMN-Δ6 from the anti-mSin3A immunoprecipitate (Fig. 2B, lane 5, middle panel). Myc-SMN-Δ7 was still capable of binding to mSin3A at a level comparable with full-length Myc-SMN (Fig. 2B, lane 6, middle panel). Thus, it seems that SMN region of amino acids 241–278 encoded by exon 6 is the SMN subdomain that mediates association with mSin3A. To show the presence of endogenous mSin3A, the immunoprecipitates were blotted with the K-20 anti-mSin3A antibody (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–6, lower panel).Fig. 2mSin3A interaction with SMN deletion mutants. A, schematic representation of human SMN deletion constructs. B, 293 cells were transfected with pCS2-MT-SMN deletion mutants. Cell lysates (lanes 1-6, top panel) were immunoprecipitated with the K-20 anti-mSin3A antibody.

Because our data showed that SMN protein could interact with mSin3/HDAC, we tested whether directing SMN to a particular promoter would inhibit transcription through recruitment of mSin3A and its associated HDAC activity. Because SMN has not been reported to bind to DNA in a sequence-specific manner, we constructed the expression plasmid pCS2-Gal4-MT-SMN in which the Gal4 DNA-binding domain is fused to the Myc-SMN protein. 293 cells were then transfected with pCS2-Gal4-MT-SMN plus a luciferase reporter containing five consensus Gal4-binding sites and an SP1 site in the promoter region (Fig 3A). When compared with the pCS2-Gal4-MT vector, expression of Gal4-Myc-SMN resulted in repression of the reporter gene activity by more than 70% (Fig. 3B, compare columns 1 and 2). Furthermore, this repressive function of Gal4-Myc-SMN seems to require HDAC activity because the repression was significantly relieved by treatment of the cotransfected cells with TSA, a well known inhibitor of HDACs (17Marks P.A. Rifkind R.A. Richon V.M. Breslow R. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 759-760PubMed Google Scholar, 18Im H. Grass J.A. Christensen H.M. Perkins A. Bresnick E.H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15152-15160Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), at a concentration of 125 ng/ml or higher (Fig. 3B, columns 3 through 6).Fig. 3Targeted repression of the luciferase reporter gene by SMN. A schematic of the pG5-SP1-Luc reporter gene is shown (top panel). Five Gal4-binding sites upstream of the SP1 site and the firefly luciferase reporter gene are indicated. pG5-SP1-Luc reporter gene construct was cotransfected into 293 cells either with pCS2-Gal4-MT empty vector or pCS2-Gal4-MT-SMN. The transfected cells were left untreated or were treated with TSA at the designated concentrations. The firefly luciferase activities were measured and normalized to Renillar luciferase controls, then compared with the empty vector (bottom panel). Results of five experiments are presented as mean ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine the minimal region(s) required for transcriptional repression, the same Gal4 DNA-binding domain was fused in-frame to SMN deletion mutants and then cotransfected with the pG5-SP1-Luc reporter. SMN mutants lacking exons 1, 5, or 7 repressed transcription from the reporter gene as strongly as the wild-type SMN. In contrast, SMN mutant lacking exon 6 no longer possessed such repressive activity (Fig. 4, top panel). To rule out the possibility that the observed differences were due to inconsistency in transfection and/or protein expression, 293 lysates expressing these Gal4-Myc-SMN mutants were separated by SDS-PAGE for protein analysis. Western blotting showed that the Gal4-fused SMN proteins were expressed at comparable levels in all these samples (Fig. 4, bottom panel), thus repression of the reporter gene by Gal4-fused SMN is unlikely to be an artifact. Instead, these results suggest that targeting of SMN to a promoter can result in recruitment of mSin3 by means of the exon 6 subdomain of SMN, and that subsequent repression of the reporter gene is mediated, at least in part, through TSA-sensitive histone deacetylases.Fig. 4Repression of luciferase reporter gene by SMN deletion mutants. 293 cells were cotransfected with pG5-SP1-Luc reporter construct and pCS2-Gal4-MT-SMN deletion mutants. After 40 h, the firefly luciferase activities were measured and normalized to the β-galactosidase controls. The experiments were repeated at least three times, and the results are shown as mean ± S.D. (top panel). The same lysates were also blotted with the anti-Myc antibody to show expression of Gal4-Myc-SMN mutants (bottom panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)SMA-associated Mutation Y272C May Affect SMN-mSin3A Interaction—It is known that homozygous deletion of the telomeric SMN is responsible for SMA in 94% of cases. About 4% of patients with SMA retain at least one allele of the telomeric SMN (1Lefebvre S. Burglen L. Reboullet S. Clermont O. Burlet P. Viollet L. Benichou B. Cruaud C. Millasseau P. Zeviani M. Cell. 1995; 80: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2936) Google Scholar). In these cases, intragenic mutations are thought to be the cause of SMA. At the present time, several SMA-related missense mutations are known to be within or immediately adjacent to the exon 6 region. These mutations include S262I, Y272C, T274I, G275S, and G279V (Fig. 1A). Among these mutations, Y272C is the most frequently occurring one that may be associated with type I SMA (19Wirth B. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 15: 228-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar).To investigate the binding of these mutants to mSin3A, we performed site-directed mutagenesis to introduce these point mutations into wild-type SMN. 293 cells were then transfected with the resultant missense mutation constructs, and the lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the K-20 anti-mSin3A antibody. Western blotting showed that the expression levels of Myc-SMN missense mutants were comparable for all constructs (Fig. 5A, lane 1-7, upper panel). The amount of Myc-SMN-Y272C that was immunoprecipitated with K-20 antibody was lower than that of Myc-SMN protein (Fig. 5A, compare lanes 1 and 3, middle panel). However, the decrease of Myc-SMN-Y272C in the immunoprecipitate was not as complete as Myc-SMN-Δ6 (Fig. 5A, compare lanes 3 and 7, middle panel). There was no significant change in binding of other missense mutants to mSin3A (Fig. 5, lanes 2, 4, 5, 6, middle panel). Taken together, these data suggest that the SMA-associated Y272C missense mutation may have an adverse effect on SMN-mSin3A interaction, whereas other SMN missense mutations have no appreciable effects on the binding under our experimental conditions.Fig. 5Analysis of mSin3A interaction with SMN missense mutations. A, 293 cells were transfected with pCS2-MT-SMN missense mutants, and the lysates (top panel) were immunoprecipitated with the anti-mSin3A antibody. The immunoprecipitates were blotted with the anti-Myc antibody to detect the Myc-SMN missense mutants (middle panel) or blotted with the K-20 antibody to show the existence of mSin3A (bottom panel). B, cells were transfected with pG5-SP1-Luc reporter construct and pCS2-Gal4-MT-SMN missense mutants. After 40 h, the firefly luciferase activities were measured and normalized to the β-galactosidase controls (top panel). The same lysates were also blotted with the anti-Myc antibody to show expression of the Gal4-Myc-SMN missense mutants (bottom panel). C, cells were transfected with pG4–14D-Luc reporter (top panel) and pCS2-Gal4-MT-SMN missense mutants. Firefly luciferase activities were measured and normalized to the Renillar luciferase controls (bottom panel). D, cells were transfected with pG5-E1b-Luc reporter (top panel) and pCS2-Gal4-MT-SMN missense mutants. Firefly luciferase activities were measured and normalized to the Renillar luciferase controls (bottom panel). All transfection experiments were repeated at least three times; results are shown as mean ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To investigate whether SMN missense mutations also affect repression of the luciferase reporter gene, we constructed expression plasmids by fusing Gal4 DNA-binding domain to these SMN missense mutants. Compared with the wild-type protein, these SMN missense mutations showed minimal effects on luciferase activity and, therefore, did not seem to cause derepression of the reporter gene (Fig. 5B). To examine whether potential derepression by the Y272C missense mutation could be obtained with a different promoter construct, we tested another luciferase reporter, pG4–14D-Luc, which contains four consensus Gal4-binding sites upstream of the 14D promoter (14Laherty C.D. Yang W.M. Sun J.M. Davie J.R. Seto E. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1997; 89: 349-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). When pG4–14D-Luc was co-transfected into 293 cells, 10-fold repression of the luciferase activity by Gal4-Myc-SMN was observed (Fig. 5C, compare the first two columns). However, none of the five SMN missense mutations had any effect on derepression (Fig. 5C, columns 2-7).To investigate whether repression by Gal4-Myc-SMN can work on a TATA-containing promoter, the pG5-E1b-Luc reporter construct (13Zhang Y. Woodford N. Xia X. Hamburger A.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2168-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) was used in co-transfection with pCS2-Gal4-MT-SMN. This reporter construct contained five consensus Gal4-binding sites upstream of the E1b promoter. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of a TATA box -30 bp from the transcription initiation site. Although Gal4-Myc-SMN was able to repress expression of the luciferase reporter gene driven by this TATA-containing promoter, the five SMN missense mutations did not show appreciable derepression as compared with the wild-type SMN (Fig. 5D).Exon 6 Region of SMN Mediates Higher Order Complex Formation—These findings suggest that either SMN mutants do not derepress gene expression or our luciferase reporter approach is unable to assess the impairment of SMN missense mutations on potential gene repression. Previously, a cell viability and proliferation assay also failed to differentiate SMA-related missense mutants from wild-type SMN (20Wang J. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45387-45393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). If these SMA-related missense mutations indeed contribute to the pathological process of motor neuron death, they would be expected to lack at least some of the functions of wild-type SMN protein.Interestingly, a previous in vitro study reported that the exon 6 of SMN encodes a self-oligomerization region, and we showed in this study that the same exon 6 region is important for interaction with mSin3 in vivo. These findings suggest that the exon 6 region of SMN may be involved in the formation of higher order protein complexes inside cells, and SMA-related missense mutations may be deficient in such a function. To test this hypothesis, lysate from 293 cells expressing Myc-epitope-tagged SMN, SMN-Δ6, or SMN-Δ7 was size-fractionated through a Superose column; all of the fractions were then analyzed by Western blotting. In 293 cells, endogenous SMN protein existed as multi-protein complexes exceeding 40,000 kDa (Fig. 6A, top panel), and wild-type Myc-SMN also formed similar higher order protein complexes (Fig. 6A, second panel). In contrast, exon 6-deletion stripped the mutant Myc-SMN-Δ6 of most interacting proteins, leading to a dramatic reduction in the size of the Myc-SMN-Δ6 complexes to around 200 kDa (Fig. 6A, third panel). The elution profile of Myc-SMN-Δ7 was not affected by exon 7 deletion and was similar to that of Myc-SMN (Fig. 6A, bottom panel), indicating that exon 7 region of SMN is not critical to higher order protein assembly.Fig. 6Effects of SMN mutations on higher order complex formation. A, lysates from 293 cells expressing Myc-SMN (top two panels), Myc-SMN-Δ6 (third panel), and Myc-SMN-Δ7 (bottom panel) were size-fractionated on a Superose column. The fractions were collected and blotted with anti-SMN or anti-Myc antibody. The approximate molecular sizes of protein complexes in these fractions are indicated on the top. B, lysates expressing different Myc-SMN missense mutants were size-fractionated and blotted with the anti-Myc antibody. The elution profiles of wild-type Myc-SMN and missense mutants are aligned for comparison.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)When lysates from 293 cells expressing Myc-SMN missense mutations were size-fractionated through the same Superose column, the elution profiles of Myc-tagged S262I, T274I, G275S, and G279V mutants all showed major complexes exceeding 40,000 kDa in size (Fig. 6B). The Myc-SMN-Y272C missense mutant retained some ability to form protein complexes exceeding 40,000 kDa. However, there are more abundant smaller Y272C-containing complexes, which peaked around 700 kDa (Fig. 6B). In comparison with the wild-type SMN, we suspect that protein supra-complexes containing the Y272C missense mutation may be less stable and easier to dissociate into smaller protein complexes under our experimental conditions.DISCUSSIONBased on results from this and other studies,"
https://openalex.org/W2170348598,"Oxidative folding is the fusion of native disulfide bond formation with conformational folding. This complex process is guided by two types of interactions: first, covalent interactions between cysteine residues, which transform into native disulfide bridges, and second, non-covalent interactions giving rise to secondary and tertiary protein structure. The aim of this work is to understand both types of interactions in the oxidative folding of Amaranthus α-amylase inhibitor (AAI) by providing information both at the level of individual disulfide species and at the level of amino acid residue conformation. The cystine-knot disulfides of AAI protein are stabilized in an interdependent manner, and the oxidative folding is characterized by a high heterogeneity of one-, two-, and three-disulfide intermediates. The formation of the most abundant species, the main folding intermediate, is favored over other species even in the absence of non-covalent sequential preferences. Time-resolved NMR and photochemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization spectroscopies were used to follow the oxidative folding at the level of amino acid residue conformation. Because this is the first time that a complete oxidative folding process has been monitored with these two techniques, their results were compared with those obtained at the level of an individual disulfide species. The techniques proved to be valuable for the study of conformational developments and aromatic accessibility changes along oxidative folding pathways. A detailed picture of the oxidative folding of AAI provides a model study that combines different biochemical and biophysical techniques for a fuller understanding of a complex process.

A detailed picture of the oxidative folding of AAI provides a model study that combines different biochemical and biophysical techniques for a fuller understanding of a complex process. Cracking the code for folding a string of amino acid residues into a biologically active three-dimensional structure is still a major challenge of both chemical and biological interest. The information that determines the folding of a protein is contained solely in its amino acid residues (1Anfinsen C.B. Science. 1973; 181: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (5013) Google Scholar). In proteins that contain cysteine residues the formation of disulfide bonds is an additional degree of freedom in the folding process. In these proteins a fusion between the recovery of the native tertiary structure (conformational folding) and the regeneration of native disulfide bonds is coupled in the oxidative folding process (2Wedemeyer W.J. Welker E. Narayan M. Scheraga H.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4207-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Disulfide formation is important for in vivo folding of a considerable number of eukaryotic proteins and is a key posttranslational modification for the stabilization of folded structures. The study of oxidative folding in vitro can provide a detailed structural description in terms of the disulfide intermediate species present along the pathway of the complex folding process. A thorough account of an oxidative folding reaction should combine a study of the formation of covalently stable intermediate species and their disulfide bond connectivity and an analysis of the conformational assembly of these species. An established method for elucidation of the exact role that disulfides play in the process of achieving the native fold is time-resolved RP-HPLC 1The abbreviations used are: RP-HPLC, reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EETI-II, Ecballium elaterium inhibitor-II; photo-CIDNP, photochemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization; AAI, Amaranthus α-amylase inhibitor; MFI, main folding intermediate; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; DTT, dithiothreitol; FMN, flavin mononucleotide; 1D, one-dimensional; R, reduced (species); N, native (species). 1The abbreviations used are: RP-HPLC, reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EETI-II, Ecballium elaterium inhibitor-II; photo-CIDNP, photochemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization; AAI, Amaranthus α-amylase inhibitor; MFI, main folding intermediate; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; DTT, dithiothreitol; FMN, flavin mononucleotide; 1D, one-dimensional; R, reduced (species); N, native (species). analysis of acid-trapped samples from an oxidative folding reaction. On the other hand, conformational folding is followed by physicochemical, mostly spectroscopic techniques, which give information at the level of a single residue or even a single atom in the polypeptide structure and are hence most versatile for looking at the restoration of native secondary and tertiary structures. The regeneration of native disulfide bonds of several disulfide-rich proteins has been characterized showing a complex diversity of folding pathways that regulate native disulfide bond formation. The original studies on bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor by Creighton (3Creighton T. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 87: 579-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) were later revisited by Weissman and Kim (4Weissman J.S. Kim P.S.

In contrast to the formation and reshuffling of disulfides commonly studied using acid trapping and RPHPLC, the change in conformation at the level of amino acid residues, along the folding pathway, is poorly understood.

Apart from the native species (disulfide bonds: 1-18, 8-23, and 17-31), five other three-disulfide species appear on the folding pathway, all of which contain non-native disulfide bonds (see Fig. 1A). Most interestingly, three of them also include the vicinal disulfide bridge between adjacent cysteine residues 17 and 18, one of which is the most abundant intermediate (MFI) of the folding process. These intermediates (MFI, I-5, and I-6) appear to be the first folding intermediates observed to have a vicinal disulfide bond. MFI has been studied in detail for its tertiary structure and the solvent accessibility of aromatic residues Tyr21, Tyr27, Tyr28, and Trp5 (33Cemazar M. Zahariev S. Lopez J.J. Carugo O. Jones J.A.

The present work examines the kinetic process of oxidative folding of AAI at the level of individual disulfide species and at the level of individual amino acid residues. Firstly, the acid-trapping technique and RP-HPLC were combined to understand the stabilization of cystine-knot disulfides and the kinetics of their formation in different folding conditions. It was found that the cystine-knot disulfide bonds are interdependent and form via several kinetic traps, of which MFI is favored due to its statistically probable disulfide pattern. Secondly, spectroscopic techniques (NMR and photo-CIDNP) were used to give information about the conformational characteristics of the disulfide species present on the folding pathway. The tertiary structure and solvent accessibility of aromatic residues were examined in a time-resolved experiment for the entire oxidative folding process and contrasted to the equilibrium species that are a part of the folding assembly at any time during the refolding process. This is the first oxidative folding process to be elucidated in a time-resolved manner using 1D NMR and photo-CIDNP. The rate constant of formation of the native AAI protein was found to be the same at the disulfide species and single residue levels. AAI peptide was produced manually on a 1-mmol scale by solid-phase peptide synthesis using an Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) methodology (33Cemazar M. Zahariev S. Lopez J.J. Carugo O.

Samples were eluted with linear gradients of solvents A (H2O, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and B (CH3CN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). The disulfide connectivities of intermediates were determined as described elsewhere (33Cemazar M. Zahariev S. Lopez J.J. Carugo O. Jones J.A. Hore P.J. Pongor S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5754-5759Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The detailed conditions of oxidative folding from native AAI and MFI, reductive unfolding from native AAI and MFI, and folding in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) and DsbC are all indicated in the corresponding figure legends. The presence of disulfide species at different times after the start of folding was examined by removing aliquots from the folding mixture at selected time points and analyzing them with analytic RP-HPLC. The pH of oxidative folding reaction in the presence of DsbC was chosen to be 7.40 to approximate it to physiological conditions. Electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry experiments were performed on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences API 150 EX electrospray, single quadrupole mass spectrometer operated at a resolution of 3000. The samples were analyzed in positive mode either by direct syringe infusion or via a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry system using two Waters model 510 pumps and a microbore column (Agilent ZORBAX 300 SB-C18, 1.0 × 150 mm, 3.5 μm) and applying a gradient of 0-60% B (60 min) at a flow rate of 40 μl min-1. The molecular weights of the peptides were calculated using the Applied Biosystems software (BioMultiview and ProMac). Sample Preparation—Samples for equilibrium spectra of native, MFI, and reduced AAI were purified by analytic RP-HPLC at pH 2, lyophilized, and redissolved in D2O at pH 7 immediately prior to experiment. Samples for time-resolved spectra were obtained by refolding reduced AAI (6SH) ([AAI] = 50 mg/liter, 0.1 m NH4OAc, 2 mm EDTA, 1.0 m GdnHCl, pH 8.5, 1 mm cysteine, 0.05 mm cystine, 25 °C) and acid quenching (with trifluoroacetic acid to pH 2) of 10.0-ml aliquots at various refolding times. The protein content was separated from the refolding buffer with RP-HPLC (gradient of 0-60% B in 10 min). Samples were lyophilized and kept under N2 at 4 °C before they were redissolved in D2O (pH 7), and 0.2 mm flavin mononucleotide (FMN) was added for photo-CIDNP experiments. The stability of the samples was confirmed by comparing analytical RPHPLC profiles before lyophilization (after purification) and after the NMR/photo-CIDNP experiment. Spectra Acquisition—All NMR spectra were recorded on home-built 600 NMR spectrometers (Oxford Centre for Molecular Sciences) with operating frequencies of 600.20 MHz. The spectrometers are equipped with Oxford Instruments Co. magnets, Omega software, digital control equipment (Bruker Instruments), home-built triple resonance probe heads, and home-built linear amplifiers (45Soffe N. Boyd J. Leonard M. J. Magn. Reson. A. 1995; 116: 117-121Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For photo-CIDNP experiments, the light of a 4-watt continuous wave argon ion laser (Spectra-Physics Stabilite 2016-05) with 100-ms light pulses was introduced into the NMR tube via an optical fiber (diameter 1 mm), inside a coaxial Pyrex insert (Wilmad WGS 5BL) (46Scheffler J.E. Cottrell C.E. Berliner L.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 63: 199-201Google Scholar). Spectra were recorded at 25 °C and pH 7. Both NMR and photo-CIDNP spectra were recorded with 10,000 Hz spectral width, 4096 block size, and 512 and 16 acquisitions, respectively. All NMR data were processed using Felix 2.3 software from Biosym Technologies. The oxidative folding process of AAI was first studied at the level of individual disulfide species. The intermediate species, which take part in the folding process, were all characterized previously in terms of their disulfide content, which is shown as a summary in Fig. 1A (33Cemazar M. Zahariev S. Lopez J.J. Carugo O. Jones J.A. Hore P.J. Pongor S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5754-5759Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). They are all covalently bonded stable species, which are efficiently separated with analytic RP-HPLC at acidic pH (4Weissman J.S. Kim P.S. Science. 1991; 253: 1386-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). A time-resolved analysis of their transformations was performed in different folding conditions. Heterogeneous Mixture of Intermediates in the Optimum Oxidative Folding Conditions—The first experiment was the refolding of reduced AAI at the optimum oxidative folding conditions, which have been described before (33Cemazar M. Zahariev S. Lopez J.J. Carugo O. Jones J.A. Hore P.J. Pongor S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5754-5759Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), where over 93% of the native protein is regenerated in 20 h. The chromatogram, which shows the separation of the reaction mixture 45 min after the start of the reaction, is shown in Fig. 1B. The optimized oxidative folding of AAI is characterized by a high heterogeneity of one-, two-, and three-disulfide species. It is dominated by only a few disulfide species, among which are especially prominent the five fully oxidized species with three disulfide bonds (MFI, I-1, I-4, I-5, and I-6). A plot of the abundance of all three-disulfide species and of the fully reduced protein versus the refolding time is shown in Fig. 1C. The rapid disappearance of the reduced species is fitted well to a first order exponential decay (R2 > 0.99, where R is the multiple correlation coefficient) with a rate constant of 0.14 min-1. The native species accumulates with a lower rate constant, and the data for the first 20 h of folding is fitted well to a first order exponential rise curve, where 0.0098 min-1 is the rate constant (R2 > 0.99). The sigmoidal build-up of the signal during the first 30 min (Fig. 1C) has a negligible effect on the quality of the fitting. Interdependence of Disulfides in Native AAI and Their Independence in the MFI Species—The mechanisms of reductive unfolding of native AAI protein and the main folding intermediate species were analyzed to give information about the way these two different disulfide patterns are stabilized. Purified native AAI protein was isolated and placed into a reducing buffer containing various concentrations of dithiothreitol (DTT) at pH 8.50. The unfolding experiments were quenched in a time course manner and analyzed by RP-HPLC. The results show that the reduction of the native species leads to direct conversion to the fully reduced species, without accumulation of intermediate one-, two-, or three-disulfide species (Fig. 2A). This concurrent reduction is observed for different concentrations of the reducing agent, ranging from 5 to 100 mm. The rate constant for the conversion of the native AAI to the reduced species (kN→R), extracted for four different DTT concentrations (Fig. 2B), shows a linear dependence upon the concentration of DTT, as seen in Fig. 2C. The unfolding pathway was also examined with Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine as a reducing agent (pH 3.0) and was found to be mechanistically unchanged. In contrast to the reduc"
