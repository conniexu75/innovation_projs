https://openalex.org/W2016688533,"Superconductivity persists in several, layered, transition metal dichalcogenide superconductors when the layers are spread apart to accommodate organic molecules between them. These materials are of interest not only because of their two-dimensional character but also because they may provide a means for examining hypotheses regarding organic molecules and superconductivity."
https://openalex.org/W1974977612,"Observations made in summer 1981 show a significant and widespread decrease in salinity, averaging 0.02 per mil, in deep waters of the subpolar North Atlantic over the past two decades. This implies a relatively rapid response of deep water formation to climatic perturbation."
https://openalex.org/W2062215547,"Knowledge of early mammalian evolution has been based on Old World Late Triassic-Early Jurassic faunas. The discovery of mammalian fossils of approximately equivalent age in the Kayenta Formation of northeastern Arizona gives evidence of greater diversity than known previously. A new taxon documents the development of an angular region of the jaw as a neomorphic process, and represents an intermediate stage in the origin of mammalian jaw musculature."
https://openalex.org/W1987765078,"The sphinx moth, Manduca sexta, maintains its thoracic temperature within a degree of 42 degrees C while in free flight over a range of air temperatures from about 17 degrees to 32 degrees C. Tying off the dorsal vessel abolishes temperature control. Moths with tied off vessels overheat and then stop flying at air temperatures of about 23 degrees C. However, flight at this temperature is possible when the thoracic scales are removed. The mechanism of temperature control involves transfer of the heat produced in the thorax to the blood pumped from the dorsal vessel, and the subsequent dissipation of this heat when the blood returns to the relatively cool abdomen."
https://openalex.org/W2078318819,"A simple method was developed for measuring extensive growth of intact leaves of monocots on a minute-by-minute basis. Growth was markedly reduced by a slight reduction in leaf water potential. When plants mildly deficient in water were irrigated, growth resumed virtually instantly. The transitional rapid growth after watering suggests that water deficit increased cell extensibility."

https://openalex.org/W2067140230,"Night-interrluption experiments with the wasp Nasonia vitripennis maintained in 48- and 72-hour light: dark cycles reveal two and three peaks of light sensitivity (diapause inhibition), respectively. The first peak is 19 hours after lights-on in all regimes tested; the later peaks occlur at 24-hour intervals thereafter, providing evidence for the circadian nature of the photoperiodic clock in this insect."
https://openalex.org/W2014611582,A model is proposed to explain clutch size in birds as the outcome of the interaction between predatory adaptations of birds to increase their feeding efficiency and adaptations of their food resources to avoid predation. Variations in clutch size are consistent with the model. A modification that incorporates the seasonality of food resources is also discussed.
https://openalex.org/W2067034894,"Coastal marine sediments are shown to be a net source of nitrous oxide. The rates of nitrous oxide flux from sediments in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, ranged from 20 to more than 900 nanomoles per square meter per hour. Sediments from a eutrophic area had higher rates of net nitrous oxide production than sediments from relatively unpolluted sites. The benthic, nitrous oxide source exceeds the nitrous oxide source to the bay from sewage treatment plant effluent."
https://openalex.org/W1982867049,"Local fractionation of uranium and thorium, between minerals within a sample of igneous rock at the time of crystallization, makes it possible to date its solidification by use of ionium and uranium. Results on samples of granite, pumice, and lava suggest that this method of dating is reliable."
https://openalex.org/W2038275872,"The major site of sorption of zinc-65 in natural, matlike periphyton is on the upper surface of the community. There is a diffusion gradient within the community. Expression of results from short-term spiking experiments should thus be presented on an areal rather than gravimetric basis."
https://openalex.org/W2094987610,"Samples of subsurface water, oil, and rock from strata of Mississippian and Pennsylvanian age in the Northern Oklahoma Platform area were analyzed. Several of the water samples contained iodide at more than 500 parts per million. Analyses of the brines and rock indicated that the iodide originated organically."
https://openalex.org/W2045037677,"In Periplaneta americana, olfactory receptors on the antennae of male adults and nymphs respond at low threshold to the specific natural odorous attractant produced by virgin females. There are no receptors for that odor on the antennae of female adults or nymphs of any instar."

https://openalex.org/W2042249130,The thermal histories of archeological cereal grains were examined by electron spin resonance spectroscopy. Studies with modern samples of heated cereal grain showed that the parameters of the electron spin resonance signal characterize the maximum temperature to which the sample had previously been heated. This technique has applicability in archeology and other disciplines.
https://openalex.org/W2021925511,"As the climate of Pleistocene Bermuda oscillated during the last two glacial cycles, coincident variation occurred for a variety of independent events in the form and diversity of land snails. This variation was influenced primarily by the availability of calcium carbonate for shell construction."
https://openalex.org/W2001319252,"Carbon dioxide builds up in the eartht's atmosphere principally from increased use of fossil fuels. Estimates of the escalating uses of fossil fuels in the United States, especially for the generation of electric power and in the internal combustion engine, show that by the year 2000 emissions will have increased approximately eighteenfold from 1890. In the period 1965 to 1985 an emission-rate increase of around 4.0 percent per year compounded is expected. The expected intrusion and expansion of nuclear power will tend to lower the rates of increase of emission after 1985. Increases in emission rates in the rest of the world will probably equal or exceed the values projected for the United States."
https://openalex.org/W2026713398,A significant correlation between oxygyn-18 concentration in a Greenland ice core and an index of solar activity supports the validity of the solar index. The correlation may result from an apparent control of temperature by solar activity.

https://openalex.org/W1977934214,"Proton and electron irradiation of silicates, minerals, and rocks produces a paramagnetic defect whose resonance spectrum is identical to that of the singly charged oxygen vacancy in silica glass and Î±-quartz. It is suggested that this defect is characteristic of all structures containing SiO4 tetrahedra. Cracks, fracturing, and electric discharges have been observed after irradiation in planes determined by the particle ranges. These processes may contribute to the erosion and transport of lunar surface materials."
