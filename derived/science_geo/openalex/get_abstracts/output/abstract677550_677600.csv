https://openalex.org/W3186734133,"LncRNAs play essential roles in tumorigenesis and tumor progression. Pseudogene UBE2CP3 is an antisense intronic lncRNA. However, the biological function of UBE2CP3 in gastric cancer (GC) remains unknown. In this study, we revealed that lncRNA UBE2CP3 was aberrantly upregulated in multiple independent gastric cancer cohorts, and its overexpression was clinically associated with poor prognosis in GC. UBE2CP3 was mainly located in cytoplasm and promoted migratory and invasive capacities of GC cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanismly, a novel dysregulated ceRNA network UB2CP3/miR-138-5p/ITGA2 was identified in GC by transcriptome sequencing. Furthermore, rescue assay further confirmed that UBE2CP3 mainly promoted GC progression through miR-138-5p/ITGA2 axis. More importantly, our data proved that UBE2CP3/IGFBP7 could form an RNA duplex, thereby directly interacting with the ILF3 protein. In turn, this RNA-RNA interaction between IGFBP7 mRNA and UBE2CP3 mediated by ILF3 protein plays an essential role in protecting the mRNA stability of UBE2CP3. In addition, transcription factor ELF3 was identified to be a direct repressor of lncRNA UBE2CP3 in GC. Taken together, overexpression of UBE2CP3 promotes tumor progression via cascade amplification of ITGA2 upregulation in GC. Our finding has revealed that the dysregulation of UBE2CP3 is probably due to the downregulation of ELF3 and/or the overexpression of IGFBP7 mRNA in GC. Our findings reveal, for the first time, that UBE2CP3 plays crucial a role in GC progression by modulating miR-138-5p/ITGA2 axis, suggesting that UBE2CP3 may serve as a potential therapeutic target in GC."
https://openalex.org/W3186079608,"COVID-19 is only partly understood, and the level of evidence available in terms of pathophysiology, epidemiology, therapy, and long-term outcome remains limited. During the early phase of the pandemic, it was necessary to effectively investigate all aspects of this new disease. Autopsy can be a valuable procedure to investigate the internal organs with special techniques to obtain information on the disease, especially the distribution and type of organ involvement.During the first wave of COVID-19 in Germany, autopsies of 19 deceased patients were performed. Besides gross examination, the organs were analyzed with standard histology and polymerase-chain-reaction for SARS-CoV-2. Polymerase chain reaction positive localizations were further analyzed with immunohistochemistry and RNA-in situ hybridization for SARS-CoV-2.Eighteen of 19 patients were found to have died due to COVID-19. Clinically relevant histological changes were only observed in the lungs. Diffuse alveolar damage in considerably different degrees was noted in 18 cases. Other organs, including the central nervous system, did not show specific micromorphological alterations. In terms of SARS-CoV-2 detection, the focus remains on the upper airways and lungs. This is true for both the number of positive samples and the viral load. A highly significant inverse correlation between the stage of diffuse alveolar damage and viral load was found on a case and a sample basis. Mediastinal lymph nodes and fat were also affected by the virus at high frequencies. By contrast, other organs rarely exhibited a viral infection. Moderate to strong correlations between the methods for detecting SARS-CoV-2 were observed for the lungs and for other organs.The lung is the most affected organ in gross examination, histology and polymerase chain reaction. SARS-CoV-2 detection in other organs did not reveal relevant or specific histological changes. Moreover, we did not find CNS involvement."
https://openalex.org/W3186118656,"Background COVID-19 poses a severe threat worldwide. This study analyzes its propagation and evaluates statistically the effect of mobility restriction policies on the spread of the disease. Methods We apply a variation of the stochastic Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered model to describe the temporal-spatial evolution of the disease across 33 provincial regions in China, where the disease was first identified. We employ Bayesian Markov Chain Monte-Carlo methods to estimate the model and to characterize a dynamic transmission network, which enables us to evaluate the effectiveness of various local and national policies. Results The spread of the disease in China was predominantly driven by community transmission within regions, which dropped substantially after local governments imposed various lockdown policies. Further, Hubei was only the epicenter of the early epidemic stage. Secondary epicenters, such as Beijing and Guangdong, had already become established by late January 2020. The transmission from these epicenters substantially declined following the introduction of mobility restrictions across regions. Conclusions The spatial transmission network is able to differentiate the effect of the local lockdown policies and the cross-region mobility restrictions. We conclude that both are important policy tools for curbing the disease transmission. The coordination between central and local governments is important in suppressing the spread of infectious diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3185647966,"Underlying diseases might be risk factors for poor prognosis in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19); however, we still do not know whether these diseases are independent factors affecting prognosis, which type of underlying diseases are risk factors, and which type of clinical outcomes are affected. We retrospectively reviewed cohort data from 7,590 de-identified patients with COVID-19 who were diagnosed using severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 RNA polymerase chain reaction test up to May 15, 2020. We used linked-medical claims data provided by the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service in South Korea. Underlying diseases were identified using the diagnostic codes in the patients’ files from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019. The total mortality rate was 3.0% in patients with COVID-19. After adjusting for age, sex, and concomitant chronic conditions, we found that congestive heart failure, chronic pulmonary diseases, diabetes without chronic complications, renal diseases, and malignancy were factors that significantly increased the cost of treatment. Cerebrovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, and paralysis were found to be independent factors significant in prolonging hospital stay. Diabetes with chronic complications was independently associated with intensive care unit admission. In addition, underlying congestive heart failure (odds ratio [OR], 1.724; P = 0.003), dementia (OR, 1.598; P = 0.012), diabetes with and without chronic complications (OR, 1.821; P = 0.002 and OR, 1.518; P = 0.022, respectively), renal disease (OR, 2.299; P = 0.002), and malignancy (OR, 1.529; P = 0.039) were significant factors associated with death, even after adjustments. Underlying diseases were significant independent factors of the poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19. The effects were variable according to the type of underlying disease and clinical outcome. Therefore, patients with COVID-19 with underlying diseases should be monitored more closely because they are more at risk of a poor prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W3183963233,"Human behavior can have effects on oneself and externalities on others. Mask wearing is such a behavior in the current pandemic. What motivates people to wear face masks in public when mask wearing is voluntary or not enforced? Which benefits should the policy makers rather emphasize in information campaigns—the reduced chances of getting the SARS-CoV-2 virus (benefits for oneself) or the reduced chances of transmitting the virus (benefits for others in the society)? In this paper, we link measured risk preferences and other-regarding preferences to mask wearing habits among 840 surveyed employees of two large Swiss hospitals. We find that the leading mask-wearing motivations change with age: While for older people, mask wearing habits are best explained by their self-regarding risk preferences, younger people are also motivated by other-regarding concerns. Our results are robust to different specifications including linear probability models, probit models and Lasso covariate selection models. Our findings thus allow drawing policy implications for effectively communicating public-health recommendations to frontline workers during the COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3183325190,"Impaired mitochondrial fusion, due in part to decreased mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) expression, contributes to unrestricted cell proliferation and apoptosis-resistance in hyperproliferative diseases like pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We hypothesized that Mfn2 levels are reduced due to increased proteasomal degradation of Mfn2 triggered by its phosphorylation at serine 442 (S442) and investigated the potential kinase mediators. Mfn2 expression was decreased and Mfn2 S442 phosphorylation was increased in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells from PAH patients and in NSCLC cells. Mfn2 phosphorylation was mediated by PINK1 and protein kinase A (PKA), although only PINK1 expression was increased in these diseases. We designed a S442 phosphorylation deficient Mfn2 construct (PD-Mfn2) and a S442 constitutively phosphorylated Mfn2 construct (CP-Mfn2). The effects of these modified Mfn2 constructs on Mfn2 expression and biological function were compared with those of the wildtype Mfn2 construct (WT-Mfn2). WT-Mfn2 increased Mfn2 expression and mitochondrial fusion in both PAH and NSCLC cells resulting in increased apoptosis and decreased cell proliferation. Compared to WT-Mfn2, PD-Mfn2 caused greater Mfn2 expression, suppression of proliferation, apoptosis induction, and cell cycle arrest. Conversely, CP-Mfn2 caused only a small increase in Mfn2 expression and did not restore mitochondrial fusion, inhibit cell proliferation, or induce apoptosis. Silencing PINK1 or PKA, or proteasome blockade using MG132, increased Mfn2 expression, enhanced mitochondrial fusion and induced apoptosis. In a xenotransplantation NSCLC model, PD-Mfn2 gene therapy caused greater tumor regression than did therapy with WT-Mfn2. Mfn2 deficiency in PAH and NSCLC reflects proteasomal degradation triggered by Mfn2-S442 phosphorylation by PINK1 and/or PKA. Inhibiting Mfn2 phosphorylation has potential therapeutic benefit in PAH and lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3184215024,"Most evidence for interpregnancy interval (IPI) and adverse birth outcomes come from studies that are prone to incomplete control for confounders that vary between women. Comparing pregnancies to the same women can address this issue.We conducted an international longitudinal cohort study of 5,521,211 births to 3,849,193 women from Australia (1980-2016), Finland (1987-2017), Norway (1980-2016) and the United States (California) (1991-2012). IPI was calculated based on the time difference between two dates-the date of birth of the first pregnancy and the date of conception of the next (index) pregnancy. We estimated associations between IPI and preterm birth (PTB), spontaneous PTB, and small-for-gestational age births (SGA) using logistic regression (between-women analyses). We also used conditional logistic regression comparing IPIs and birth outcomes in the same women (within-women analyses). Random effects meta-analysis was used to calculate pooled adjusted odds ratios (aOR).Compared to an IPI of 18-23 months, there was insufficient evidence for an association between IPI <6 months and overall PTB (aOR 1.08, 95% CI 0.99-1.18) and SGA (aOR 0.99, 95% CI 0.81-1.19), but increased odds of spontaneous PTB (aOR 1.38, 95% CI 1.21-1.57) in the within-women analysis. We observed elevated odds of all birth outcomes associated with IPI ≥60 months. In comparison, between-women analyses showed elevated odds of adverse birth outcomes for <12 month and >24 month IPIs.We found consistently elevated odds of adverse birth outcomes following long IPIs. IPI shorter than 6 months were associated with elevated risk of spontaneous PTB, but there was insufficient evidence for increased risk of other adverse birth outcomes. Current recommendations of waiting at least 24 months to conceive after a previous pregnancy, may be unnecessarily long in high-income countries."
https://openalex.org/W3125707888,"Despite progress in understanding diazotrophic distribution in surface soils, few studies have investigated the distribution of diazotrophic bacteria in deeper soil layers. Here, we leveraged high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of nifH genes obtained to assess the influence of biochar amended soil (BC) and control (CK), and soil depths (0-20, 20-40 and 40-60 cm) on diazotrophic abundance and community structures, soil enzyme activities and physio-chemical properties. Multivariate ANOVA analysis revealed that soil depth had profound impact on majority of the soil parameters measured than fertilization. Although soil physio-chemical properties, enzymes activities, diazotrophic genera and enriched operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were significantly influenced across the entire soil profiles, we also observed that BC amended soil significantly increased cane stalk height and weight, nitrate (NO3-), ammonium (NH4+), organic matter (OM), total carbon (TC) and available potassium (AK), and enhanced diazotrophic genera in soil depth 0-20 cm compared to CK treatment. Soil TC, total nitrogen (TN), OM and NH4+ were the major impact factors shifting diazotrophic community structures in soil depth 0-20 cm. Overall, these results were more pronounced in 0-20 cm soil depth in BC than CK treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3163277818,"Social norms are powerful determinants of human behaviors in offline and online social worlds. While previous research established a correlational link between norm perceptions and self-reported disclosure on social network sites (SNS), questions remain about downstream effects of prevalent behaviors on perceived norms and actual disclosure on SNS. We conducted two preregistered studies using a realistic social media simulation. We further analyzed buffering effects of critical media literacy and privacy nudging. The results demonstrate a disclosure behavior contagion, whereby a critical mass of posts with visual disclosures shifted norm perceptions, which, in turn, affected perceivers' own visual disclosure behavior. Critical media literacy was negatively related and moderated the effect of norms on visual disclosure behavioral intentions. Neither critical media literacy nor privacy nudge affected actual disclosure behaviors, however. These results provide insights into how behaviors may spread on SNS through triggering changes in perceived social norms and subsequent disclosure behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W3184028782,"Vascular reactivity (VR), defined as blood vessels' capability to actively modify the diameter and flow resistances can be non-invasively assessed analyzing vascular response to forearm occlusion. Several VR indexes can be quantified: (i) ´microvascular´, which consider variables that depend almost exclusively on changes in distal resistances, (ii)´ macrovascular´, that evaluate the changes in brachial artery (BA) diameter, adjusting for blood flow stimulus, and (iii) ´macro/micro´, whose values depend on the micro and macrovascular response without discriminating each one´s contribution. VR indexes could not be associated. Many VR indexes have been used without availability of adequate normative data (reference intervals, RIs).(1) to evaluate macro, macro/micro and micro VR indexes obtained in a cohort of healthy children, adolescents and adults, (2) to evaluate the association between VR indexes, (3) to determine the need for age and/or sex-specific RIs, and (4) to define RIs for VR indexes.Ultrasound (B-mode/Doppler) and automatic computerized analysis were used to assess BA diameter, blood flow velocity and distal resistances, at rest and in conditions of decreased and increased blood flow. Macro, macro/micro and micro VR indexes were quantified (n = 3619). RIs-subgroups were defined according to European Reference Values for Arterial Measurements Collaboration Group (n = 1688, 3-84 years) and HUNT3-Fitness Study Group (n = 2609, 3-85 years) criteria. Mean value and standard deviation equations were obtained for VR indexes. The need for age or sex-specific RIs was analyzed. Percentile curves were defined and data were compared with those obtained in other populations.Macro and macro/micro VR indexes showed no association (or it was very weak) with microvascular indexes. Age- and sex-related profiles and RIs for macro, macro/micro and micro VR indexes were defined in a large population of healthy subjects (3-85 y). Equations for mean, standard deviation and percentiles values (year-to-year) were included in text and spreadsheet formats."
https://openalex.org/W3184971779,"African swine fever (ASF) is a serious contagious disease that causes fatal haemorrhagic fever in domestic and wild pigs, with high morbidity. It has caused devastating damage to the swine industry worldwide, necessitating the focus of attention on detection of the ASF pathogen, the African swine fever virus (ASFV). In order to overcome the disadvantages of conventional diagnostic methods (e.g. time-consuming, demanding and unintuitive), quick detection tools with higher sensitivity need to be explored. In this study, based on the conserved p72 gene sequence of ASFV, we combined the Cas12a-based assay with recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and a fluorophore-quencher (FQ)-labeled reporter assay for rapid and visible detection. Five crRNAs designed for Cas12a-based assay showed specificity with remarkable fluorescence intensity under visual inspection. Within 20 minutes, with an initial concentration of two copies of DNA, the assay can produce significant differences between experimental and negative groups, indicating the high sensitivity and rapidity of the method. Overall, the developed RPA-Cas12a-fluorescence assay provides a fast and visible tool for point-of-care ASFV detection with high sensitivity and specificity, which can be rapidly performed on-site under isothermal conditions, promising better control and prevention of ASF."
https://openalex.org/W3184745129,"Mammalian cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) reduces O2 to water in a bimetallic site including Fea3 and CuB giving intermediate molecules, termed A-, P-, F-, O-, E-, and R-forms. From the P-form on, each reaction step is driven by single-electron donations from cytochrome c coupled with the pumping of a single proton through the H-pathway, a proton-conducting pathway composed of a hydrogen-bond network and a water channel. The proton-gradient formed is utilized for ATP production by F-ATPase. For elucidation of the proton pumping mechanism, crystal structural determination of these intermediate forms is necessary. Here we report X-ray crystallographic analysis at ∼1.8 Å resolution of fully reduced CcO crystals treated with O2 for three different time periods. Our disentanglement of intermediate forms from crystals that were composed of multiple forms determined that these three crystallographic data sets contained ∼45% of the O-form structure, ∼45% of the E-form structure, and ∼20% of an oxymyoglobin-type structure consistent with the A-form, respectively. The O- and E-forms exhibit an unusually long CuB2+-OH- distance and CuB1+-H2O structure keeping Fea33+-OH- state, respectively, suggesting that the O- and E-forms have high electron affinities that cause the O→E and E→R transitions to be essentially irreversible and thus enable tightly coupled proton pumping. The water channel of the H-pathway is closed in the O- and E-forms and partially open in the R-form. These structures, together with those of the recently reported P- and F-forms, indicate that closure of the H-pathway water channel avoids back-leaking of protons for facilitating the effective proton pumping."
https://openalex.org/W3186120878,"To evaluate the feasibility of using skeletal muscle mass (SMM) at C3 (C3 SMM) as a diagnostic marker for sarcopenia in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients.We evaluated 165 HNC patients and 42 healthy adults who underwent 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography scans. The paravertebral muscle area at C3 and skeletal muscle area at L3 were measured by CT. Pearson's correlation was used to assess the relationship between L3 and C3 SMMs. The prediction model for L3 SMM was developed by multiple linear regression. Then the correlation and the agreement between actual and predicted L3 SMMs were assessed. To evaluate the diagnostic value of C3 SMM for sarcopenia, the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were analyzed.Of the 165 HNC patients, 61 (37.0%) were sarcopenic and 104 (63.0%) were non-sarcopenic. A very strong correlation was found between L3 SMM and C3 SMM in both healthy adults (r = 0.864) and non-sarcopenic patients (r = 0.876), while a fair association was found in sarcopenic patients (r = 0.381). Prediction model showed a very strong correlation between actual SMM and predicted L3 SMM in both non-sarcopenic patients and healthy adults (r > 0.9), whereas the relationship was moderate in sarcopenic patients (r = 0.7633). The agreement between two measurements was good for healthy subjects and non-sarcopenic patients, while it was poor for sarcopenic patients. On ROC analysis, predicted L3 SMM showed poor diagnostic accuracy for sarcopenia.A correlation between L3 and C3 SMMs was weak in sarcopenic patients. A prediction model also showed a poor diagnostic accuracy. Therefore, C3 SMM may not be a strong predictor for L3 SMM in sarcopenic patients with HNC."

https://openalex.org/W3179056097,"B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) is a zinc finger transcriptional repressor possessing a BTB-POZ (BR-C, ttk, and bab for BTB; pox virus and zinc finger for POZ) domain, which is required for homodimerization and association with corepressors. BCL6 has multiple roles in normal immunity, autoimmunity, and some types of lymphoma. Mice bearing disrupted BCL6 loci demonstrate suppressed high-affinity antibody responses to T-dependent antigens. The corepressor binding groove in the BTB-POZ domain is a potential target for small compound-mediated therapy. Several inhibitors targeting this binding groove have been described, but these compounds have limited or absent in vivo activity. Biophysical studies of a novel compound, GSK137, showed an in vitro pIC50 of 8 and a cellular pIC50 of 7.3 for blocking binding of a peptide derived from the corepressor silencing mediator for retinoid or thyroid hormone receptors to the BCL6 BTB-POZ domain. The compound has good solubility (128 μg/ml) and permeability (86 nM/s). GSK137 caused little change in cell viability or proliferation in four BCL6-expressing B-cell lymphoma lines, although there was modest dose-dependent accumulation of G1 phase cells. Pharmacokinetic studies in mice showed a profile compatible with achieving good levels of target engagement. GSK137, administered orally, suppressed immunoglobulin G responses and reduced numbers of germinal centers and germinal center B cells following immunization of mice with the hapten trinitrophenol. Overall, we report a novel small-molecule BCL6 inhibitor with in vivo activity that inhibits the T-dependent antigen immune response."
https://openalex.org/W3186245845,"In 2012, recommendations for universal tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccination during pregnancy were released. Our objective was to determine if Tdap, influenza, and pneumococcal vaccine uptake during pregnancy changed after the release of the guidelines, and identify factors associated with receiving the Tdap and influenza vaccine after 2012.We conducted a retrospective cohort study on pregnant individuals who initiated prenatal care before 20 weeks' gestation between 11/2011-11/2012 (""pre-guideline"") and 12/2012-12/2015 (""post-guideline""). Vaccine uptake dates were abstracted from medical records. The pre and post-guideline cohorts were compared to determine if Tdap vaccine uptake and timing improved after the new Tdap guidelines. We additionally examined influenza and pneumococcal vaccine uptake before and after guidelines. Factors associated with receipt of the Tdap and influenza vaccine during pregnancy in the post-guideline cohort were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression models.Of 2,294 eligible individuals, 1,610 (70.2%) received care in the post-guideline cohort. Among the pre-guideline cohort, 47.4% received Tdap, whereas Tdap uptake increased to 86.1% after the guidelines (p<0.001). Similarly, receiving the Tdap vaccine between the recommended time of 27-36 weeks gestational age improved from 52.5% to 91.8% after the guidelines (p<0.001). Vaccine frequency for influenza improved significantly from 61.2% to 72.0% (p<0.001), while frequency for pneumococcus were low and unchanged. An increased number of prenatal visits was associated with receiving the Tdap and influenza vaccines during pregnancy (respective, aOR 1.09 95% CI 1.05-1.13; aOR 1.50 95% CI 1.17-1.94). Non-Hispanic Black individuals were less likely to receive both the Tdap and influenza vaccines during pregnancy compared to non-Hispanic White individuals (respective, aOR 0.51 95% CI 0.33-0.80; aOR 0.68 95% CI 0.48-0.97).Receipt and timing of Tdap vaccine improved after implementation of the 2012 ACIP guidelines. Receipt of influenza vaccine uptake also improved during the study period, while uptake of the pneumococcal vaccine remained low. Significant racial disparities exist in receipt of Tdap and influenza vaccine during pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W3183335620,"Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a serious complication of complete insulin deficiency and insulin resistance in Type 1 diabetes (T1D). This results in the body producing high levels of serum ketones in an attempt to compensate for the insulin deficiency and decreased glucose utilization. DKA’s metabolic and immunologic dysregulation results in gradual increase of systemic and cerebral oxidative stress, along with low grade systemic and cerebral inflammation and the development of pretreatment subclinical BE. During treatment the early progression of oxidative stress and inflammation is hypothesized to advance the possibility of occurrence of crisis of clinical brain edema (BE), which is the most important cause of morbidity and mortality in pediatric DKA. Longitudinal neurocognitive studies after DKA treatment show progressive and latent deficits of cognition and emphasize the need for more effective DKA treatment of this long-standing conundrum of clinical BE, in the presence of systemic osmotic dehydration, metabolic acidosis and immune dysregulation. Candidate biomarkers of several systemic and neuroinflammatory pathways prior to treatment also progress during treatment, such as the neurotoxic and neuroprotective molecules in the well-recognized tryptophan (TRP)/kynurenine pathway (KP) that have not been investigated in DKA. We used LC-MS/MS targeted mass spectrometry analysis to determine the presence and initiation of the TRP/KP at three time points: A) 6–12 hours after initiation of treatment; B) 2 weeks; and C) 3 months following DKA treatment to determine if they might be involved in the pathogenesis of the acute vasogenic complication of DKA/BE. The Trp/KP metabolites TRP, KYN, quinolinic acid (QA), xanthurnenic acid (XA), and picolinic acid (PA) followed a similar pattern of lower levels in early treatment, with subsequent increases. Time point A compared to Time points B and C were similar to the pattern of sRAGE, lactate and pyruvic acid. The serotonin/melatonin metabolites also followed a similar pattern of lower quantities at the early stages of treatment compared to 3 months after treatment. In addition, glutamate, n-acetylglutamate, glutamine, and taurine were all lower at early treatment compared to 3 months, while the ketones 3-hydroxybutaric acid and acetoacetate were significantly higher in the early treatment compared to 3 months. The two major fat metabolites, L-carnitine and acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) changed inversely, with ALC significantly decreasing at 2 weeks and 3 months compared to the early stages of treatment. Both anthranilic acid (AA) and 3-OH-anthranilic acid (3OH-AA) had overall higher levels in the early stages of treatment (A) compared to Time points (B and C). Interestingly, the levels of AA and 3OH-AA early in treatment were higher in Caucasian females compared to African American females. There were also differences in the metabolite levels of QA and kynurenic acid (KA) between genders and between races that may be important for further development of custom targeted treatments. We hypothesize that the TRP/KP, along with the other inflammatory pathways, is an active participant in the metabolic and immunologic pathogenesis of DKA’s acute and chronic insults."
https://openalex.org/W3184465688,"We have investigated the importance of the rate of vaccination to contain COVID-19 in urban areas. We used an extremely simple epidemiological model that is amenable to implementation in an Excel spreadsheet and includes the demographics of social distancing, efficacy of massive testing and quarantine, and coverage and rate of vaccination as the main parameters to model the progression of COVID-19 pandemics in densely populated urban areas. Our model predicts that effective containment of pandemic progression in densely populated cities would be more effectively achieved by vaccination campaigns that consider the fast distribution and application of vaccines (i.e., 50% coverage in 6 months) while social distancing measures are still in place. Our results suggest that the rate of vaccination is more important than the overall vaccination coverage for containing COVID-19. In addition, our modeling indicates that widespread testing and quarantining of infected subjects would greatly benefit the success of vaccination campaigns. We envision this simple model as a friendly, readily accessible, and cost-effective tool for assisting health officials and local governments in the rational design/planning of vaccination strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3185253506,"Complex facial muscle movements are essential for many motoric and emotional functions. Facial muscles are unique in the musculoskeletal system as they are interwoven, so that the contraction of one muscle influences the contractility characteristic of other mimic muscles. The facial muscles act more as a whole than as single facial muscle movements. The standard for clinical and psychosocial experiments to detect these complex interactions is surface electromyography (sEMG). What is missing, is an atlas showing which facial muscles are activated during specific tasks. Based on high-resolution sEMG data of 10 facial muscles of both sides of the face simultaneously recorded during 29 different facial muscle tasks, an atlas visualizing voluntary facial muscle activation was developed. For each task, the mean normalized EMG amplitudes of the examined facial muscles were visualized by colors. The colors were spread between the lowest and highest EMG activity. Gray shades represent no to very low EMG activities, light and dark brown shades represent low to medium EMG activities and red shades represent high to very high EMG activities relatively with respect to each task. The present atlas should become a helpful tool to design sEMG experiments not only for clinical trials and psychological experiments, but also for speech therapy and orofacial rehabilitation studies."

A study to evaluate tin-117m colloid treatment response in dogs with OA was conducted at two centers, the School of Veterinary Medicine at Louisiana State University, and at a referral practice in Houston, Texas. The tin-117m colloid was administered per-protocol to 14 client-owned dogs with radiographically confirmed, grade 3 OA in one or both elbow joints. Dog owners and attending clinicians assessed the level of pain at baseline (BL) and the post-treatment pain response at 90-day intervals for one year. Owners assessed treatment response according to a pain severity score (PSS) and a pain interference score (PIS) as defined by the Canine Brief Pain Inventory. Clinicians reported a lameness score using a 0–5 scale, from no lameness to continuous non-weight bearing lameness, when observing dogs at a walk and a trot. The rate of treatment success as determined by improved mean PSS and PIS scores reported by dog owners was &gt;70% at all time points. Clinicians reported an improved mean pain score from BL at post-treatment Days 90 (p&lt;0.05), 180, and 270. The dog owner and clinician assessments of treatment success were significantly correlated (p&gt;0.05) at Day 90 and Day 180 time points. Results indicated that a single IA dose of tin-117m colloid provided a significant reduction in pain and lameness and improved functionality for up to a full year, with no adverse treatment related effects, in a high percentage of dogs with advanced, clinical OA of the elbow joint."
https://openalex.org/W3185801617,"Mechanical conditions of vehicles may play a determinant role in driving safety, the reason why vehicle periodical technical inspections (VTIs) are mandatory in many countries. However, the high number of drivers sanctioned for not complying with this regulation is surprisingly high, and there is not much evidence on what kind(s) of motives may explain this concerning panorama. This study aimed to identify the aspects that modulate the relationship between complying (or not) with VTI's standards in a nationwide sample of Spanish drivers. The study design also addressed the drivers' awareness regarding different risky behaviors while driving, depending on their sex and their crash record.1,100 Spanish drivers completed a survey on the aforementioned issues. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni post-hoc adjustment was conducted to assess significant differences (p<0.05) in the study variables.Most of the surveyed drivers (99.18%) reported that they always comply with VTI's requirements. The main reasons to comply were related to compliance with traffic regulation and fear of penalties, while the reasons attributed to its incompliance are, instead, stated as involuntary.The findings of this study support the idea that more actions are needed to increase drivers' awareness of the relevance of VTIs for road safety, as well as warning them about the dangers of neglecting vehicle checking beyond merely punishing measures. For this reason and given the greater prevalence of the issue among younger segments of the driving population, it is suggested that more emphasis on the matter could be made during novice driver's training."
https://openalex.org/W3183799941,"To evaluate the incidence and risk factors of neovascularization in unaffected fellow eyes of patients diagnosed with type 3 neovascularization in Korea.This retrospective study included 93 unaffected fellow eyes of 93 patients diagnosed with type 3 neovascularization. For initial type 3 neovascularization diagnosis, optical coherence tomography and angiography were conducted. These baseline data were compared between patients with and without neovascularization in their fellow eyes during the follow-up period.The mean follow-up period was 66.1±31.1 months. Neovascularization developed in 49 (52.8%) fellow eyes after a mean period of 29.5±19.6 months. In the fellow eye neovascularization group, the incidence of soft drusen and reticular pseudodrusen was significantly higher than that in the non-neovascularization group (83.7% vs. 36.5%, p<0.001; 67.3% vs. 40.9%, p = 0.017, respectively), but the choroidal vascularity index (CVI) showed a significantly lower value (60.7±2.0% vs. 61.7±2.5%; p = 0.047). The presence of reticular pseudodrusen was related with the duration from baseline to development of fellow eye neovascularization (p = 0.038).Neovascularization developed in 52.8% of unaffected fellow eyes. The presence of soft drusen, reticular pseudodrusen, and lower CVI values can be considered risk factors of neovascularization in unaffected fellow eyes of patients with type 3 neovascularization. The lower CVI values suggest that choroidal ischemic change may affect the development of choroidal neovascularization in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W3184155340,"Often members of a group benefit from dividing the group's task into separate components, where each member specializes their role so as to accomplish only one of the components. While this division of labor phenomenon has been observed with respect to both manual and cognitive labor, there is no clear understanding of the cognitive mechanisms allowing for its emergence, especially when there are multiple divisions possible and communication is limited. Indeed, maximization of expected utility often does not differentiate between alternative ways in which individuals could divide labor. We developed an iterative two-person game in which there are multiple ways of dividing labor, but in which it is not possible to explicitly negotiate a division. We implemented the game both as a human experimental task and as a computational model. Our results show that the majority of human dyads can finish the game with an efficient division of labor. Moreover, we fitted our computational model to the behavioral data, which allowed us to explain how the perceived similarity between a player's actions and the task's focal points guided the players' choices from one round to the other, thus bridging the group dynamics and its underlying cognitive process. Potential applications of this model outside cognitive science include the improvement of cooperation in human groups, multi-agent systems, as well as human-robot collaboration."
https://openalex.org/W3185123299,"Waist circumference (WC) is a widely accepted anthropometric parameter of central obesity. We investigated a fully automated body segmentation algorithm for measuring WC on abdominal computed tomography (CT) in comparison to manual WC measurements (WC-manual) and evaluated the performance of CT-measured WC for identifying overweight/obesity.This retrospective study included consecutive adults who underwent both abdominal CT scans and manual WC measurements at a health check-up between January 2013 and November 2019. Mid-waist WCs were automatically measured on noncontrast axial CT images using a deep learning-based body segmentation algorithm. The associations between CT-measured WC and WC-manual was assessed by Pearson correlation analysis and their agreement was assessed through Bland-Altman analysis. The performance of these WC measurements for identifying overweight/obesity (i.e., body mass index [BMI] ≥25 kg/m2) was evaluated using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis.Among 763 subjects whose abdominal CT scans were analyzed using a fully automated body segmentation algorithm, CT-measured WCs were successfully obtained in 757 adults (326 women; mean age, 54.3 years; 64 women and 182 men with overweight/obesity). CT-measured WC was strongly correlated with WC-manual (r = 0.919, p < 0.001), and showed a mean difference of 6.1 cm with limits of agreement between -1.8 cm and 14.0 cm in comparison to WC-manual. For identifying overweight/obesity, CT-measured WC showed excellent performance, with areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) of 0.960 (95% CI, 0.933-0.979) in women and 0.909 (95% CI, 0.878-0.935) in men, which were comparable to WC-manual (AUCs of 0.965 [95% CI, 0.938-0.982] and 0.916 [95% CI, 0.886-0.941]; p = 0.735 and 0.437, respectively).CT-measured WC using a fully automated body segmentation algorithm was closely correlated with manually-measured WC. While radiation issue may limit its general use, it can serve as an adjunctive output of abdominal CT scans to identify overweight/obesity."
https://openalex.org/W3186257721,"Aiming at the problem that the weak features of non-stationary vibration signals are difficult to extract under strong background noise, a multi-layer noise reduction method based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) is proposed. First, the original vibration signal is decomposed by EEMD, and the main intrinsic modal components (IMF) are selected using comprehensive evaluation indicators; the second layer of filtering uses wavelet threshold denoising (WTD) to process the main IMF components. Finally, the virtual noise channel is introduced, and FastICA is used to de-noise and unmix the IMF components processed by the WTD. Next, perform spectral analysis on the separated useful signals to highlight the fault frequency. The feasibility of the proposed method is verified by simulation, and it is applied to the extraction of weak signals of faulty bearings and worn polycrystalline diamond compact bits. The analysis of vibration signals shows that this method can efficiently extract weak fault characteristic information of rotating machinery."
https://openalex.org/W3186498672,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) share common and modifiable risk factors; among them, unhealthy eating, physical inactivity, alcohol intake and smoking habit. However, these factors are not observed in separate and, most often, they influence each other. Risk factors established during adolescence are highly likely to remain in adult life. The aims of the current study were to evaluate the prevalence and coexistence of risk factors for CVD, as well as to investigate individual characteristic of the adolescent and environmental factors associated with risk factors' coexistence profiles. This was a cross-sectional, national, school-based epidemiological study that estimated the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and metabolic syndrome in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years who attended public and private schools located in Brazilian counties with a population of more than 100 thousand. For this study, thematic blocks referring to alcohol consumption, eating habits, smoking, and physical activity were used. The grade of membership method was used to identify the coexistence of risk and protective factors for CVD among adolescents. The study analytical sample comprised 71,552 adolescents. Multilevel logistic regression was used to assess the association between factors influencing the coexistence profile of risk factors for CVD. Based on adolescent-level variables, has shown that meeting positive criterion for Common Mental Disorders and not consuming the meals provided by the school have significantly increased the likelihood of belonging to the CVD-risk profile. On the other hand, school-level variables, show that studying in private schools and living in economically favored Brazilian regions have increased adolescents' likelihood of belonging to the CVD-risk profile. These results can be used to substantiate the inclusion of food environment variables in public policies focused on preventing CVD development among Brazilian adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W3183776072,"In this study, we applied multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-profiling to explore the relative ion intensity of lipid classes in plasma samples from sea turtles in order to profile lipids relevant to sea turtle physiology and investigate how dynamic ocean environments affect these profiles. We collected plasma samples from foraging green (Chelonia mydas, n = 28) and hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata, n = 16) turtles live captured in North Pacific Costa Rica in 2017. From these samples, we identified 623 MRMs belonging to 10 lipid classes (sphingomyelin, phosphatidylcholine, free fatty acid, cholesteryl ester, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, ceramide, and triacylglyceride) and one metabolite group (acyl-carnitine) present in sea turtle plasma. The relative ion intensities of most lipids (80%) were consistent between species, across seasons, and were not correlated to body size or estimated sex. Of the differences we observed, the most pronounced was the differences in relative ion intensity between species. We identified 123 lipids that had species-specific relative ion intensities. While some of this variability is likely due to green and hawksbill turtles consuming different food items, we found indications of a phylogenetic component as well. Of these, we identified 47 lipids that varied by season, most belonging to the structural phospholipid classes. Overall, more lipids (n = 39) had higher relative ion intensity in the upwelling (colder) season compared to the non-upwelling season (n = 8). Further, we found more variability in hawksbill turtles than green turtles. Here, we provide the framework in which to apply future lipid profiling in the assessment of health, physiology, and behavior in endangered sea turtles."
https://openalex.org/W3183777790,"Growth hormone treatment strategies to achieve the goal include the titration of GH doses according to serum insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) concentrations. However, IGF-I levels do not always correlate well with the growth response. This study aims to identify the factors affecting the IGF-I concentration and identify the relationship between IGF-I and the treatment response. The data of prepubertal children treated with recombinant human GH for more than one year were obtained from the LG Growth Study (LGS) Database. This study includes patients with idiopathic growth hormone deficiency (IGHD), organic growth hormone deficiency (OGHD), or Turner syndrome (TS) or small for gestational age (SGA). Among 2,021 participants registered in LGS, 366 subjects were selected, 252 had IGHD, 16 had OGHD, 31 had TS, and 67 were SGA. In the IGHD and SGA groups, IGF-I levels had a positive correlation with weight SDS. There was no significant relationship between the pre-treatment IGF-I level and growth response. However, in the IGHD group, the growth response was significantly higher when the change in the IGF-I SDS value was 1 or more ( p = 0.0013). Therefore, IGF-I concentrations should be used as an indicator to monitor the treatment compliance rather than for efficacy determination in Korean children of short stature with GH treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3183798237,"Aiming at the problem of prediction accuracy of stochastic volatility series, this paper proposes a method to optimize the grey model(GM(1,1)) from the perspective of residual error. In this study, a new fitting method is firstly used, which combines the wavelet function basis and the least square method to fit the residual data of the true value and the predicted value of the grey model(GM(1,1)). The residual prediction function is constructed by using the fitting method. Then, the prediction function of the grey model(GM(1,1)) is modified by the residual prediction function. Finally, an example of the wavelet residual-corrected grey prediction model (WGM) is obtained. The test results show that the fitting accuracy of the wavelet residual-corrected grey prediction model has irreplaceable advantages."

However, little is known about how partners interact in determining their own and others' health or the mechanisms through which dyadic support influences physical health. We addressed those gaps by studying 1088 romantic couples from three consecutive years (T1, T2, T3; Swiss Household Panel). The study applied a data analysis strategy called Actor Partner Interdependence Model extended Mediation, which allows for mediation processes while considering the interdependence, or non-independence, of data coming from partners. Results showed that dyadic support was positively associated with perceived health over two years through the mediation of optimistic attitudes and depressive mood, both for person and partner effects. The present study demonstrates the interplay between the dyadic process and personality dispositions in maintaining good health."
https://openalex.org/W3184820814,"A firm connection of the bone-implant-fixation system is of utmost importance for patients with cranial defects. In order to improve the connection reliability, the current research focuses on finding the optimal fixation method, as well as selection of the implant manufacturing methods and the used materials. For the latter, implementation of bioactive materials such as hydroxyapatite or other calcium phosphates has also been considered in the literature. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of gradual osseointegration on the biomechanical performance of cranial Ti6Al4V implants with a deposited HA coating as the osseointegration agent. This effect was assessed by two different computational approaches using finite element method (FEM) modeling. The values of key input parameters necessary for FEM were obtained from experimental plasma spray deposition of HA layers onto Ti6Al4V samples. Immediately upon implantation, the HA layer at the bone-implant contact area brought only a slight decrease in the values of von Mises stress in the implant and the micro-screws when compared to a non-coated counterpart; importantly, this was without any negative trade-off in other important characteristics. The major benefit of the HA coatings was manifested upon the modeled osseointegration: the results of both approaches confirmed a significant reduction of investigated parameters such as the total implant displacements (reduced from 0.050 mm to 0.012 mm and 0.002 mm while using Approach I and II, respectively) and stresses (reduced from 52 MPa to 10 MPa and 1 MPa) in the implanted components in comparison to non-coated variant. This is a very promising result for potential use of thermally sprayed HA coatings for cranial implants."

Although CD is associated with high direct costs in Japan, updated information after ustekinumab's approval is unavailable. We aimed to evaluate the healthcare resource utilization (HRU) and associated direct costs from the payer's perspective in Japan. Claims data (2010-2018) were retrospectively analyzed to identify patients with CD. HRU and associated costs were evaluated for 12 months before and after biologic initiation and followed-up till 36 months post-initiation. Outcomes were reported using descriptive statistics. Among the included patients (n = 3,496), 1,783 were on biologics and 1,713 were on non-biologics. Mean (SD) age was 36.4 (13.2) years and patients were predominantly male (76.1%). Patients aged 18-39 years were affected with CD the most (55.3%). Biologic initiation was associated with a reduction in inpatient stay, length of stay, outpatient visits, and associated costs; and an increase in pharmacy costs and total costs after 12 months. Extended follow-up showed a decreasing trend in HRU and costs till 24 months but an increase after 36 months. These findings demonstrated reduction in clinical burden and slight increase in economic burden with biologics. However, indirect costs also need to be evaluated."
https://openalex.org/W3184072028,"The classification of driving styles plays a fundamental role in evaluating drivers' driving behaviors, which is of great significance to traffic safety. However, it still suffers from various challenges, including the insufficient accuracy of the model, the large amount of training parameters, the instability of classification results, and some others. To evaluate the driving behaviors accurately and efficiently, and to study the differences of driving behaviors among various vehicle drivers, a collaborative driving style classification method, which is enabled by ensemble learning and divided into pre-classification and classification, is proposed in this paper. In the pre-classification process, various clustering algorithms are utilized compositely to label some typical initial data with specific labels as aggressive, stable and conservative. Then, in the classification process, other unlabeled data can be classified accurately and efficiently by the majority voting ensemble learning method incorporating three different conventional classifiers. The availability and efficiency of the proposed method are demonstrated through some simulation experiments, in which the proposed collaborative classification method achieves quite good and stable performance on driving style classification. Particularly, compared with some other similar classification methods, the evaluation indicators of the proposed method, including accuracy, precision, recall and F-measure, are improved by 1.49%, 2.90%, 5.32% and 4.49% respectively, making it the best overall performance. Therefore, the proposed method is much preferred for the autonomous driving and usage-based insurance."
https://openalex.org/W3184962403,"The postpartum period can be challenging for women living with HIV. Understanding how the postpartum period impacts ART adherence and condomless sex could inform the development of comprehensive sexual and reproductive health and HIV services tailored to the needs of women living with HIV during this critical interval.In a longitudinal cohort study of HIV-seropositive Kenyan women, late ART refills and self-reported condomless sex were compared between the woman's pregnancy and the postpartum period. Analyses were conducted using generalized estimating equations and adjusted for alcohol use, depressive symptoms, intimate partner violence (IPV), and having a recent regular partner. Effect modification was explored for selected variables.151 women contributed visits. Late ART refills occurred at 7% (32/439) of pregnancy visits compared to 18% (178/1016) during the postpartum period (adjusted relative risk [aRR] 2.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.62-3.67). This association differed by women's education level. Women with ≥8 years of education had late ART refills more during the postpartum period than pregnancy (aRR 3.00, 95%CI 1.95-4.62). In contrast, in women with <8 years of education, late ART refills occurred similarly during pregnancy and the postpartum period (aRR 0.88, 95%CI 0.18-4.35). Women reported condomless sex at 10% (60/600) of pregnancy visits compared to 7% (72/1081) of postpartum visits (aRR 0.76, 95%CI 0.45-1.27). This association differed by whether women had experienced recent IPV. Women without recent IPV had a significant decline in condomless sex from pregnancy to postpartum (aRR 0.53, 95%CI 0.30-0.95) while women with recent IPV had no significant change in condomless sex from pregnancy to postpartum (aRR 1.76, 95%CI 0.87-3.55).Improved support for ART adherence during the postpartum period and addressing IPV to limit condomless sex could improve HIV treatment and prevention outcomes for HIV-seropositive women as well as their infants and sexual partners."
https://openalex.org/W3186672729,"One should assume that in silico experiments in systems biology are less susceptible to reproducibility issues than their wet-lab counterparts, because they are free from natural biological variations and their environment can be fully controlled. However, recent studies show that only half of the published mathematical models of biological systems can be reproduced without substantial effort. In this article we examine the potential causes for failed or cumbersome reproductions in a case study of a one-dimensional mathematical model of the atrioventricular node, which took us four months to reproduce. The model demonstrates that even otherwise rigorous studies can be hard to reproduce due to missing information, errors in equations and parameters, a lack in available data files, non-executable code, missing or incomplete experiment protocols, and missing rationales behind equations. Many of these issues seem similar to problems that have been solved in software engineering using techniques such as unit testing, regression tests, continuous integration, version control, archival services, and a thorough modular design with extensive documentation. Applying these techniques, we reimplement the examined model using the modeling language Modelica. The resulting workflow is independent of the model and can be translated to SBML, CellML, and other languages. It guarantees methods reproducibility by executing automated tests in a virtual machine on a server that is physically separated from the development environment. Additionally, it facilitates results reproducibility, because the model is more understandable and because the complete model code, experiment protocols, and simulation data are published and can be accessed in the exact version that was used in this article. We found the additional design and documentation effort well justified, even just considering the immediate benefits during development such as easier and faster debugging, increased understandability of equations, and a reduced requirement for looking up details from the literature."
https://openalex.org/W3183326308,"This study examined the concurrent validity of an inverse dynamic (force computed from barbell acceleration [reference method]) and a work-energy (force computed from work at the barbell [alternative method]) approach to measure the mean vertical barbell force during the snatch using kinematic data from video analysis. For this purpose, the acceleration phase of the snatch was analyzed in thirty male medal winners of the 2018 weightlifting World Championships (age: 25.2±3.1 years; body mass: 88.9±28.6 kg). Vertical barbell kinematics were measured using a custom-made 2D real-time video analysis software. Agreement between the two computational approaches was assessed using Bland-Altman analysis, Deming regression, and Pearson product-moment correlation. Further, principal component analysis in conjunction with multiple linear regression was used to assess whether individual differences related to the two approaches are due to the waveforms of the acceleration time-series data. Results indicated no mean difference (p > 0.05; d = -0.04) and an extremely large correlation (r = 0.99) between the two approaches. Despite the high agreement, the total error of individual differences was 8.2% (163.0 N). The individual differences can be explained by a multiple linear regression model (R2adj = 0.86) on principal component scores from the principal component analysis of vertical barbell acceleration time-series waveforms. Findings from this study indicate that the individual errors of force measures can be associated with the inverse dynamic approach. This approach uses vertical barbell acceleration data from video analysis that is prone to error. Therefore, it is recommended to use the work-energy approach to compute mean vertical barbell force as this approach did not rely on vertical barbell acceleration."

https://openalex.org/W3184187004,"Breastfeeding is the feeding of an infant or young child with breast milk directly from female human breasts. It confers short-term and long-term benefits for both child and mother, including helping to protect children against a variety of acute and chronic disorders. In mothers, breastfeeding (BF) reduces postpartum bleeding, enhances accelerated involution of the uterus, and plays a crucial role in child spacing. Fathers have an important but often neglected role in the promotion of healthy breastfeeding practices. Evidence shows that mothers who have a supportive and encouraging partner are more likely to plan to breastfeed for a longer duration. So, this study was aimed to assess knowledge and associated factors towards breastfeeding practice among fathers.A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Gurage Zone among 597 fathers. One stage cluster sampling technique was used to select study participants. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect the data and it was checked for consistency and completeness and entered into epi data and exported to SPSS for analysis. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was done to identify independent predictors. P-value < 0.05 was considered to declare a result as statistically significant.In this study, a total of 585 participants were involved making a response rate of 98%. The overall knowledge status of participants was 341 (58.3%). The mean age of participants was 29.5 (SD±4.5). Urban residence, educational status, exposure to media, having more than one baby at home, and accompany his wife during health-seeking were independent predictors of knowledge status.This study has shown the level of knowledge of fathers towards breastfeeding in the study area was low (58.3%). Residence, two or more babies at home, accompany during ANC, and indexed infant illness was independent predictors of knowledge status of fathers towards breastfeeding. Policymakers and possible stack holders should better focus on the improvement of knowledge because the knowledge determines the overall condition of the family including the psychological development of the children that affect their life especially in a country like Ethiopia in which most of the decisions are made by them. Other researchers focus on the interaction of parents and the child and feeding disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3184291153,"Despite mounting evidence that incorporation of QI curricula into surgical trainee education improves morbidity and outcomes, surgery training programs lack standardized QI curricula and tools to measure QI knowledge. In the current study, we developed, implemented, and evaluated a quality improvement curriculum for surgical residents.Surgical trainees participated in a longitudinal, year-long (2019-2020) curriculum based on the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's online program. Online curriculum was supplemented with in person didactics and small group projects. Acquisition of skills was assessed pre- and post- course via self-report on a Likert scale as well as the Quality Improvement Knowledge Application Tool (QIKAT). Self-efficacy scores were assessed using the General Self-Efficacy Scale. 9 out of 18 total course participants completed the post course survey. This first course cohort was analyzed as a pilot for future work.The project was developed and deployed among surgical residents during their research/lab year. Teams of surgical residents were partnered with a faculty project mentor, as well as non-physician teammates for project work.Participation in the QI course significantly increased skills related to studying the process (p = 0.0463), making changes in a system (p = 0.0167), identifying whether a change leads to an improvement (p = 0.0039), using small cycles of change (p = 0.0000), identifying best practices and comparing them to local practices (p = 0.0020), using PDSA model as a systematic framework for trial and learning (p = 0.0004), identifying how data is linked to specific processes (p = 0.0488), and building the next improvement cycle upon success or failure (p = 0.0316). There was also a significant improvement in aim (p = 0.037) and change (p = 0.029) responses to one QIKAT vignette.We describe the effectiveness of a pilot longitudinal, multi component QI course based on the IHI online curriculum in improving surgical trainee knowledge and use of key QI skills."
https://openalex.org/W3185038509,"Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is a common kidney disorder caused by dysfunction of the glomerular filtration barrier. Some genetic mutations identified in NS patients cause amino acid substitutions of kidney ankyrin repeat-containing (KANK) proteins, which are scaffold proteins that regulate actin polymerization, microtubule targeting, and cell adhesion via binding to various molecules, including the kinesin motor protein KIF21A. However, the mechanisms by which these mutations lead to NS are unclear. Here, we unexpectedly found that the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A1 (eIF4A1) interacts with an NS-associated KANK2 mutant (S684F) but not the wild-type protein. Biochemical and structural analyses revealed that the pathological mutation induces abnormal binding of eIF4A1 to KANK2 at the physiological KIF21A-binding site. Competitive binding assays further indicated that eIF4A1 can compete with KIF21A to interact with the S684F mutant of KANK2. In cultured mouse podocytes, this S684F mutant interfered with the KANK2/KIF21A interaction by binding to eIF4A1, and failed to rescue the focal adhesion or cell adhesion that had been reduced or morphologically changed by KANK2 knockout. These structural, biochemical, and cellular results not only provide mechanistic explanations for the podocyte defects caused by the S684F mutation, but also show how a gain-of-binding mutation can lead to a loss-of-function effect."
https://openalex.org/W3185246123,"Respiratory motion management is crucial for high-resolution MRI of the heart, lung, liver and kidney. In this article, respiration guide using acoustic sound generated by pulsed gradient waveforms was introduced in the pulmonary ultrashort echo time (UTE) sequence and validated by comparing with retrospective respiratory gating techniques. The validated sound-guided respiration was implemented in non-contrast enhanced renal angiography. In the sound-guided respiration, breathe-in and-out instruction sounds were generated with sinusoidal gradient waveforms with two different frequencies (602 and 321 Hz). Performance of the sound-guided respiration was evaluated by measuring sharpness of the lung-liver interface with a 10-90% rise distance, w10-90, and compared with three respiratory motion managements in a free-breathing UTE scan: without respiratory gating (w/o gating), 0-dimensional k-space navigator (k-point navigator), and image-based self-gating (Img-SG). The sound-guided respiration was implemented in stack-of-stars balanced steady-state free precession with inversion recovery preparation for renal angiography. No subjects reported any discomfort or inconvenience with the sound-guided respiration in pulmonary or renal MRI scans. The lung-liver interface of the UTE images for sound-guided respiration (w10-90 = 6.99 ± 2.90 mm), k-point navigator (8.51 ± 2.71 mm), and Img-SG (7.01 ± 2.06 mm) was significantly sharper than that for w/o gating (17.13 ± 2.91 mm; p < 0.0001 for all of sound-guided respiration, k-point navigator and Img-SG). Sharpness of the lung-liver interface was comparable between sound-guided respiration and Img-SG (p = 0.99), but sound-guided respiration achieved better visualization of pulmonary vasculature. Renal angiography with the sound-guided respiration clearly delineated renal, segmental and interlobar arteries. In conclusion, the gradient sound guided respiration can facilitate a consistent diaphragm position in every breath and achieve performance of respiratory motion management comparable to image-based self-gating."

Polymorphisms of the prion protein gene (PRNP) strongly modulate scrapie resistance and incubation period in goats. The aim of this study was to identify PRNP genetic variability in goats across the United States. Blood from a total of 6,029 apparent scrapie disease-free goats from 654 operations and 19 breeds were analyzed. Sequencing of PRNP revealed 26 genotypes with different rates based on eight codons. The GG127, RR154, and QQ222 genotypes were predominant and showed a remarkably high rate across all goats. The QK222 and NS146 genotypes, known to be protective against scrapie, were found in 0.6% [with 95% CI = (0.3, 1.2)] and 22.0% [95% CI = (19.1, 25.2)] of goats, respectively. The QK222 genotype was found in 23.1% of Oberhasli goats tested, with 95%CI = (3.9, 68.7)] and 22.0% of Toggenburg goats tested with 95%CI = (9.7, 42.5)], while NS146 was found in 65.5% of Savannah goats tested, with 95%CI = (30.8, 89.9), 36.7% of Boer goats tested, with 95%CI = (33.1, 40.4), 36.3% of Nubian goats tested, with 95%CI = (27.0, 46.7)], and 35.6% of LaMancha goats tested, with 95%CI = (22.8, 50.8%). The MM142 and IM142 genotypes were found more frequently in goats on dairy operations, while the HR143, NS146, and ND146 genotypes were found more frequently in goats on meat operations. Goats in the east region had a higher percentage of goats with RH154, RQ211, and QK222 genotypes than goats in the west region. The results of this study showed high genetic variability of PRNP among the U.S. goat population, with differences by location and breed, and may serve as a rationale for development of goat breeding programs at the national level to mitigate the risk of scrapie."
https://openalex.org/W3186033224,"Superoxide radicals and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) are implicated in influenza A virus-induced inflammation. In this in vitro study, we evaluated the effects of TG6-44, a novel quinazolin-derived myeloperoxidase-specific ROS inhibitor, on influenza A virus (A/X31) infection using THP-1 lung monocytic cells and freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). TG6-44 significantly decreased A/X31-induced ROS and virus-induced inflammatory mediators in THP-1 cells (IL-6, IFN-γ, MCP-1, TNF-α, MIP-1β) and in human PBMC (IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, MCP-1). Interestingly, TG6-44-treated THP-1 cells showed a decrease in percent cells expressing viral nucleoprotein, as well as a delay in translocation of viral nucleoprotein into the nucleus. Furthermore, in influenza A virus-infected cells, TG6-44 treatment led to suppression of virus-induced cell death as evidenced by decreased caspase-3 activation, decreased proportion of Annexin V+PI+ cells, and increased Bcl-2 phosphorylation. Taken together, our results demonstrate the anti-inflammatory and anti-infective effects of TG6-44."
https://openalex.org/W3186546704,"Serum albumin binding to the yeast form of Candida albicans is described. Two populations of binding site are identified using two complementary spectroscopic techniques: an extrinsic fluorescent probe, 3-hexa-decanoyl-7-hydrocoumarin ([HEXCO) added to the C. albicans yeast cell surface that records the electrostatic surface potential and so responds to the surface binding of serum albumin and secondly a light scattering technique that reveals how albumin modulates aggregation of the yeast population. The albumin binding sites are found to possess different binding affinities and relative abundance leading to different total binding capacities. These are characterized as a receptor population with high affinity binding (Kd ~ 17 μM) but relatively low abundance and a separate population with high abundance but much lower affinity (Kd ~ 364 μM). The low-affinity binding sites are shown to be associated with the yeast cell aggregation. These values are found be dependent on the C. albicans strain and the nature of the culture media; some examples of these effects are explored. The possible physiological consequences of the presence of these sites are speculated in terms of evading the host's immune response, biofilm formation and possible interkingdom signaling processes."
https://openalex.org/W3184741509,"Experimental study to measure the intraocular lens (IOL) injection time and injection speed at different intraocular pressure (IOP) settings when using the AutonoMe® injector.In this experimental study, following phacoemulsification in porcine cadaver eyes, a trocar was inserted at pars plana with a connected infusion and IOPs of 20, 50 and 80 mmHg were generated by altering the infusion height. Twelve CO2 gas-driven injectors were used to implant an IOL via a corneal incision of 2.2 mm. For each IOP setting, the duration of the IOL injection and the injection speed was measured by analyzing a video recording of the procedure.The mean ±SD injection time (seconds) was 4.47±0.50 at 20 mmHg, 4.98±0.55 at 50 mmHg and 5.47±0.20 at 80 mmHg. The mean ±SD injection speed (millimeters per seconds) was 1.36±0.15 at 20 mmHg, 1.22±0.14 at 50 mmHg and 1.10±0.04 at 80 mmHg. There was a significant (p<0.05) difference between the 20 and 80 mmHg groups in mean injection duration and injection speed.The CO2 gas driven injector allows a safe IOL injection even at elevated IOP. Although the implantation time is slightly extended at higher IOPs, this does not seem to be clinically relevant. No IOL damage was observed at these pressure settings."
https://openalex.org/W3184870487,"Background The association between psoriasis and the risk of cancer has been investigated in numerous studies utilising electronic health records (EHRs), with conflicting results in the extent of the association. Objectives To assess concordance and timing of cancer recording between primary care, hospital and death registration data for people with and without psoriasis. Methods Cohort studies delineated using primary care EHRs from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD and Aurum databases, with linkage to hospital episode statistics (HES), Office for National Statistics (ONS) mortality data and indices of multiple deprivation (IMD). People with psoriasis were matched to those without psoriasis by age, sex and general practice. Cancer recording between databases was investigated by proportion concordant, that being the presence of cancer record in both source and comparator datasets. Delay in recording cancer diagnoses between CPRD and HES records and predictors of discordance were also assessed. Results 58,904 people with psoriasis and 350,592 comparison patients were included using CPRD GOLD; whereas 213,400 people with psoriasis and 1,268,998 comparison patients were included in CPRD Aurum. For all cancer records (excluding keratinocyte), concordance between CPRD and HES was greater than 80%. Concordance for same-site cancer records was markedly lower (&lt;68% GOLD-linked data; &lt;72% Aurum-linked data). Concordance of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and liver cancer recording between CPRD and HES was lower for people with psoriasis compared to those without. Conclusions Concordance between CPRD and HES is poor when restricted to cancers of the same site, with greater discordance in people with psoriasis for some cancers of specific sites. The use of linked patient-level data is an important step in reducing misclassification of cancer outcomes in epidemiological studies using routinely collected electronic health records."
https://openalex.org/W3185576221,"In this study, we evaluated factors affecting changes in cervical lordosis after deformity correction and during follow-up period in adult spinal deformity (ASD) patients with severe sagittal imbalance.Seventy-nine patients, with an average age of 71.6 years, who underwent long-segment fixation from T10 to S1 with sacropelvic fixation were included. We performed a comparative analysis of the radiographic parameters after surgery (Post) and at the last follow-up (Last). We calculated the Pearson's correlation coefficient and performed multilinear regression analysis to predict independent parameters for Post and Last cervical lordosis (CL), T1 slope (T1S), and thoracic kyphosis (TK).Hyperlordotic changes of -23.3° in CL before surgery was reduced to -7° after surgery, and Last CL had increased to -15.3°. T1S was reduced from 27° before surgery to 14.4° after surgery and had increased to 18.8° at the last follow-up. Through multilinear regression analysis, we found that Post CL and T1S were more significantly affected by the amount of LL correction (p = .045 and .049). The effect of Last T1S was significantly associated with the Last CL; the effect of Last TK, with the Last T1S; and the effect of Post PI-LL, with the Last TK (p < .05).The postoperative kyphotic change in CL in ASD patients with preoperative cervical hyperlordosis is not permanent and is affected by drastic LL correction and SVA restoration. To achieve spinopelvic harmony proportional to the difference in LL relative to PI, TK becomes modified over time to increase T1S and CL, in an effort to achieve optimal spine curvature."
https://openalex.org/W3185926832,"We aimed to establish and evaluate a standardized emotional situation sentence system (ESSS) relevant to the lives of college students to supplement prior literature and adapt to the needs of emotional research. Two studies were designed for this research; study 1 examined the effect of words in the ESSS and study 2 involved the use of pictures. For Study 1, 778 items were selected by 607 college students and 15 experts. We then tested the scale with 80 undergraduate participants. The ESSS sentences were rated on their degree of valence, arousal, and dominance using a 9-point scale. Cronbach's α (greater than 0.986) of the overall score as well as each sub-score in the three components confirmed the scale's reliability. As seen on a scatter plot, the results suggest that negative emotions (fear, disgust, anger, sadness, anxiety) are convergent and different from the distribution of positive (happiness) and neutral emotions. Study 2 included 30 participants to compare the difference in valence and arousal between the ESSS and emotional pictures. The results indicate that the ESSS is a standardized, situational, and ecological emotional contextual text system, well-suited to invoke emotion in college students. The ESSS has significantly better arousal and potency than pictures; moreover, it can be applied to experimental studies of anxiety-related emotions. However, emotion pictures have shorter response times, and wider application ranges, and they can include more cross-cultural characteristics compared to words."
