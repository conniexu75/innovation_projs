https://openalex.org/W2097862336,"Metastatic growth in distant organs is the major cause of cancer mortality. The development of metastasis is a multistage process with several rate-limiting steps. Although dissemination of tumour cells seems to be an early and frequent event, the successful initiation of metastatic growth, a process termed 'metastatic colonization', is inefficient for many cancer types and is accomplished only by a minority of cancer cells that reach distant sites. Prevalent target sites are characteristic of many tumour entities, suggesting that inadequate support by distant tissues contributes to the inefficiency of the metastatic process. Here we show that a small population of cancer stem cells is critical for metastatic colonization, that is, the initial expansion of cancer cells at the secondary site, and that stromal niche signals are crucial to this expansion process. We find that periostin (POSTN), a component of the extracellular matrix, is expressed by fibroblasts in the normal tissue and in the stroma of the primary tumour. Infiltrating tumour cells need to induce stromal POSTN expression in the secondary target organ (in this case lung) to initiate colonization. POSTN is required to allow cancer stem cell maintenance, and blocking its function prevents metastasis. POSTN recruits Wnt ligands and thereby increases Wnt signalling in cancer stem cells. We suggest that the education of stromal cells by infiltrating tumour cells is an important step in metastatic colonization and that preventing de novo niche formation may be a novel strategy for the treatment of metastatic disease."
https://openalex.org/W2077895811,"Modern drug discovery relies on the continual development of synthetic methodology to address the many challenges associated with the design of new pharmaceutical agents. One such challenge arises from the enzymatic metabolism of drugs in vivo by cytochrome P450 oxidases, which use single-electron oxidative mechanisms to rapidly modify small molecules to facilitate their excretion. A commonly used synthetic strategy to protect against in vivo metabolism involves the incorporation of electron-withdrawing functionality, such as the trifluoromethyl (CF(3)) group, into drug candidates. The CF(3) group enjoys a privileged role in the realm of medicinal chemistry because its incorporation into small molecules often enhances efficacy by promoting electrostatic interactions with targets, improving cellular membrane permeability, and increasing robustness towards oxidative metabolism of the drug. Although common pharmacophores often bear CF(3) motifs in an aromatic system, access to such analogues typically requires the incorporation of the CF(3) group, or a surrogate moiety, at the start of a multi-step synthetic sequence. Here we report a mild, operationally simple strategy for the direct trifluoromethylation of unactivated arenes and heteroarenes through a radical-mediated mechanism using commercial photocatalysts and a household light bulb. We demonstrate the broad utility of this transformation through addition of CF(3) to a number of heteroaromatic and aromatic systems. The benefit to medicinal chemistry and applicability to late-stage drug development is also shown through examples of the direct trifluoromethylation of widely prescribed pharmaceutical agents."

https://openalex.org/W2071157209,"When the core hydrogen is exhausted during stellar evolution, the central region of a star contracts and the outer envelope expands and cools, giving rise to a red giant, in which convection occupies a large fraction of the star. Conservation of angular momentum requires that the cores of these stars rotate faster than their envelopes, and indirect evidence supports this. Information about the angular momentum distribution is inaccessible to direct observations, but it can be extracted from the effect of rotation on oscillation modes that probe the stellar interior. Here, we report the detection of non-rigid rotation in the interiors of red-giant stars by exploiting the rotational frequency splitting of recently detected mixed modes. We demonstrate an increasing rotation rate from the surface of the star to the stellar core. Comparing with theoretical stellar models, we conclude that the core must rotate at least ten times faster than the surface. This observational result confirms the theoretical prediction of a steep gradient in the rotation profile towards the deep stellar interior."
https://openalex.org/W1978625035,"In mice, cocaine is found to potentiate excitatory transmission in medium-sized spiny neurons expressing the type-1 dopamine receptor; depotentiation reversed cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization, raising the possibility of novel treatments for addiction. Synaptic plasticity is known to occur in drug addiction, but there is little evidence to link drug-evoked plasticity to the behavioural adaptations seen in drug-addicted animals. Pascoli et al. report that specific potentiation in dopaminergic neurons expressing the type I dopamine receptor causes the locomotor sensitization often observed in animals exposed to cocaine. Specific depotentiation of this pathway using optogenetics both restores normal synaptic transmission and eliminates the behavioural phenotype. These data link synaptic potentiation of D1R-expressing neurons to drug-evoked behaviour, and suggest that therapeutic reversal of cocaine-induced adaptive synaptic changes could lead to behavioural corrections. Drug-evoked synaptic plasticity is observed at many synapses and may underlie behavioural adaptations in addiction1. Mechanistic investigations start with the identification of the molecular drug targets. Cocaine, for example, exerts its reinforcing2 and early neuroadaptive effects3 by inhibiting the dopamine transporter, thus causing a strong increase in mesolimbic dopamine. Among the many signalling pathways subsequently engaged, phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in the nucleus accumbens4 is of particular interest because it has been implicated in NMDA-receptor and type 1 dopamine (D1)-receptor-dependent synaptic potentiation5 as well as in several behavioural adaptations6,7,8. A causal link between drug-evoked plasticity at identified synapses and behavioural adaptations, however, is missing, and the benefits of restoring baseline transmission have yet to be demonstrated. Here we find that cocaine potentiates excitatory transmission in D1-receptor-expressing medium-sized spiny neurons (D1R-MSNs) in mice via ERK signalling with a time course that parallels locomotor sensitization. Depotentiation of cortical nucleus accumbens inputs by optogenetic stimulation in vivo efficiently restored normal transmission and abolished cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization. These findings establish synaptic potentiation selectively in D1R-MSNs as a mechanism underlying a core component of addiction, probably by creating an imbalance between distinct populations of MSNs in the nucleus accumbens. Our data also provide proof of principle that reversal of cocaine-evoked synaptic plasticity can treat behavioural alterations caused by addictive drugs and may inspire novel therapeutic approaches involving deep brain stimulation or transcranial magnetic stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2009415789,"Observational work conducted over the last few decades indicates that all massive galaxies have supermassive black holes at their centres. Although the luminosities and brightness fluctuations of quasars in the early Universe suggest that some are powered by black holes with masses greater than 10 billion solar masses, the remnants of these objects have not been found in the nearby Universe. The giant elliptical galaxy Messier 87 hosts the hitherto most massive known black hole, which has a mass of 6.3 billion solar masses. Here we report that NGC 3842, the brightest galaxy in a cluster at a distance from Earth of 98 megaparsecs, has a central black hole with a mass of 9.7 billion solar masses, and that a black hole of comparable or greater mass is present in NGC 4889, the brightest galaxy in the Coma cluster (at a distance of 103 megaparsecs). These two black holes are significantly more massive than predicted by linearly extrapolating the widely-used correlations between black hole mass and the stellar velocity dispersion or bulge luminosity of the host galaxy. Although these correlations remain useful for predicting black hole masses in less massive elliptical galaxies, our measurements suggest that different evolutionary processes influence the growth of the largest galaxies and their black holes."
https://openalex.org/W2009190733,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) as modulators of gene expression have been described to display both tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressive functions. Although their role has been studied in different tumor types, little is known about how they regulate nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling in breast cancer. Here, we performed an unbiased whole genome miRNA (miRome) screen to identify novel modulators of NF-κB pathway in breast cancer. The screen identified 13 miRNA families whose members induced consistent effects on NF-κB activity. Among those, the miR-520/373 family inhibited NF-κB signaling through direct targeting of RELA and thus strongly reduced expression and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8. With a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches, we propose a metastasis-suppressive role of miR-520/373 family. miR-520c and miR-373 abrogated both in vitro cell invasion and in vivo intravasation of highly invasive MDA-MB-231 cells. However, knockdown of RELA did not affect their metastatic ability. mRNA profiling of MDA-MB-231 cells on overexpression of miR-520/373 members revealed a strong downregulation of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling. Mechanistically, the metastasis-suppressive role of miR-520/373 can be attributed to direct suppression of TGFBR2, as the silencing of TGFBR2 phenocopied the effects of miR-520/373 overexpression on suppression of Smad-dependent expression of the metastasis-promoting genes parathyroid hormone-related protein, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and angiopoietin-like 4 as well as tumor cell invasion, in vitro and in vivo. A negative correlation between miR-520c and TGFBR2 expression was observed in estrogen receptor negative (ER−) breast cancer patients but not in the ER positive (ER+) subtype. Remarkably, decreased expression of miR-520c correlated with lymph node metastasis specifically in ER− tumors. Taken together, our findings reveal that miR-520/373 family has a tumor-suppressive role in ER− breast cancer by acting as a link between the NF-κB and TGF-β pathways and may thus contribute to the interplay of tumor progression, metastasis and inflammation."

https://openalex.org/W1969978989,"Autophagy is activated in cancer cells during chemotherapy and often contributes to tumor chemotherapy resistance. In this study, we characterized the role of microRNA-30a (miR-30a) in the coordination of cancer cell apoptosis and autophagy, which determines the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapy. First, the autophagy activity in cancer cells increased after cis-dichloro-diamine platinum (cis-DDP) or Taxol treatment, as indicated by the enhanced expression of beclin 1, a key regulator of autophagy, and increased number of LC3-positive autophagosomes. Second, miRNA screening using a TaqMan probe-based quantitative RT-PCR assay identified that miR-30a, a miRNA that targets beclin 1, was significantly reduced in tumor cells by cis-DDP treatment. Forced expression of miR-30a significantly reduced beclin 1 and the autophagy activity of tumor cells induced by cis-DDP. Third, the blockade of tumor cell autophagy activity by miR-30a expression or 3-methyladenine significantly increased tumor cell apoptosis induced by cis-DDP treatment. Finally, an in vivo tumor implantation mouse model clearly showed that elevation of miR-30a in implanted tumor cells by administration of the recombinant lentivirus expressing miR-30a strongly enhanced cis-DDP-induced apoptosis of tumor cells. In conclusion, our results demonstrate for the first time that miR-30a can sensitize tumor cells to cis-DDP via reducing beclin 1-mediated autophagy and that increasing miR-30a level in tumor cells represents a novel approach to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy during cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1966637161,"IgA secreting plasma cells in the lamina propria are shown to be an important source of iNOS and TNF required to maintain the homeostatic balance between intestinal microbes and the immune system. The gut contains a vast number of bacteria that are essential for the health of the organism, but it is also a rich source of lymphocytes that exist to eliminate infections. How do lymphocytes restrain themselves from attacking beneficial bacteria, yet maintain their ability to respond to true pathogens? Fritz et al. show that as B cells differentiate into plasma cells in the gut, they adopt a phenotype reminiscent of innate immune cells — inflammatory monocytes — while maintaining their ability to produce immunoglobulin. The resulting immunoglobulin-A-secreting plasma cells in the lamina propria are shown to be the main source of the antimicrobial mediators tumour necrosis factor-α and inducible nitric oxide synthase, which are required to maintain the homeostatic balance between intestinal microbes and the immune system. The largest mucosal surface in the body is in the gastrointestinal tract, a location that is heavily colonized by microbes that are normally harmless. A key mechanism required for maintaining a homeostatic balance between this microbial burden and the lymphocytes that densely populate the gastrointestinal tract is the production and transepithelial transport of poly-reactive IgA (ref. 1). Within the mucosal tissues, B cells respond to cytokines, sometimes in the absence of T-cell help, undergo class switch recombination of their immunoglobulin receptor to IgA, and differentiate to become plasma cells2. However, IgA-secreting plasma cells probably have additional attributes that are needed for coping with the tremendous bacterial load in the gastrointestinal tract. Here we report that mouse IgA+ plasma cells also produce the antimicrobial mediators tumour-necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and express many molecules that are commonly associated with monocyte/granulocytic cell types. The development of iNOS-producing IgA+ plasma cells can be recapitulated in vitro in the presence of gut stroma, and the acquisition of this multifunctional phenotype in vivo and in vitro relies on microbial co-stimulation. Deletion of TNF-α and iNOS in B-lineage cells resulted in a reduction in IgA production, altered diversification of the gut microbiota and poor clearance of a gut-tropic pathogen. These findings reveal a novel adaptation to maintaining homeostasis in the gut, and extend the repertoire of protective responses exhibited by some B-lineage cells."

https://openalex.org/W2041921905,"The role of specificity protein 1 (Sp1) in controlling gene expression in lung tumor development and metastasis is not well understood. In this study, we showed that the Sp1 level was highly increased and required for lung tumor growth in transgenic mice bearing Kras-induced lung tumors under the control of doxycycline. Furthermore, the Sp1 level was highly upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma cells with low invasiveness and in patients with stage I lung cancer. We also demonstrated that Sp1 was downregulated in lung adenocarcinoma cells with high invasiveness and in patients with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma. Moreover, Sp1 inversely regulated migration, invasion and metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma cells in vivo. In addition, a decrease in the Sp1 level in highly invasive lung adenocarcinoma cells resulted from instability of the Sp1 protein. Furthermore, overexpression of Sp1 in highly invasive lung adenocarcinoma cells increased expression of E-cadherin, a suppressor of metastasis, and attenuated the translocation of β-catenin into the cellular nucleus that leads to tumor malignancy. Taken together, Sp1 level accumulated strongly in early stage and then declined in late stage, which is important for lung cancer cell proliferation and metastasis during tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2018252938,"IL-6 has been shown to play a major role in collagen up-regulation process during cardiac hypertrophy, although the precise mechanism is still not known. In this study we have analyzed the mechanism by which IL-6 modulates cardiac hypertrophy. For the in vitro model, IL-6-treated cultured cardiac fibroblasts were used, whereas the in vivo cardiac hypertrophy model was generated by renal artery ligation in adult male Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus). During induction of hypertrophy, increased phosphorylation of STAT1, STAT3, MAPK, and ERK proteins was observed both in vitro and in vivo. Treatment of fibroblasts with specific inhibitors for STAT1 (fludarabine, 50 μm), STAT3 (S31-201, 10 μm), p38 MAPK (SB203580, 10 μm), and ERK1/2 (U0126, 10 μm) resulted in down-regulation of IL-6-induced phosphorylation of specific proteins; however, only S31-201 and SB203580 inhibited collagen biosynthesis. In ligated rats in vivo, only STAT3 inhibitors resulted in significant decrease in collagen synthesis and hypertrophy markers such as atrial natriuretic factor and β-myosin heavy chain. In addition, decreased heart weight to body weight ratio and improved cardiac function as measured by echocardiography was evident in animals treated with STAT3 inhibitor or siRNA. Compared with IL-6 neutralization, more pronounced down-regulation of collagen synthesis and regression of hypertrophy was observed with STAT3 inhibition, suggesting that STAT3 is the major downstream signaling molecule and a potential therapeutic target for cardiac hypertrophy."
https://openalex.org/W2064082659,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases, is expressed in up to 70% of epithelial ovarian cancers (EOCs), where it correlates with poor prognosis. The majority of EOCs are diagnosed at an advanced stage, and at least 50% present malignant ascites. High levels of IL-6 have been found in the ascites of EOC patients and correlate with shorter survival. Herein, we investigated the signaling cascade led by EGFR activation in EOC and assessed whether EGFR activation could induce an EOC microenvironment characterized by pro-inflammatory molecules. In vitro analysis of EOC cell lines revealed that ligand-stimulated EGFR activated NFkB-dependent transcription and induced secretion of IL-6 and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1). IL-6/PAI-1 expression and secretion were strongly inhibited by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1478 and EGFR silencing. A significant reduction of EGF-stimulated IL-6/PAI-1 secretion was also obtained with the NFkB inhibitor dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin. Of 23 primary EOC tumors from advanced-stage patients with malignant ascites at surgery, 12 co-expressed membrane EGFR, IL-6 and PAI-1 by immunohistochemistry; both IL-6 and PAI-1 were present in 83% of the corresponding ascites. Analysis of a publicly available gene-expression data set from 204 EOCs confirmed a significant correlation between IL-6 and PAI-1 expression, and patients with the highest IL-6 and PAI-1 co-expression showed a significantly shorter progression-free survival time (P=0.028). This suggests that EGFR/NFkB/IL-6-PAI-1 may have a significant impact on the therapy of a particular subset of EOC, and that IL-6/PAI-1 co-expression may be a novel prognostic marker."

https://openalex.org/W2048350644,"The molecular chaperone 70-kDa heat-shock proteins (Hsp70s) play essential roles in maintaining protein homeostasis. Hsp110, an Hsp70 homolog, is highly efficient in preventing protein aggregation but lacks the hallmark folding activity seen in Hsp70s. To understand the mechanistic differences between these two chaperones, we first characterized the distinct peptide substrate binding properties of Hsp110s. In contrast to Hsp70s, Hsp110s prefer aromatic residues in their substrates, and the substrate binding and release exhibit remarkably fast kinetics. Sequence and structure comparison revealed significant differences in the two peptide-binding loops: the length and properties are switched. When we swapped these two loops in an Hsp70, the peptide binding properties of this mutant Hsp70 were converted to Hsp110-like, and more impressively, it functionally behaved like an Hsp110. Thus, the peptide substrate binding properties implemented in the peptide-binding loops may determine the chaperone activity differences between Hsp70s and Hsp110s."

Rac1, a small GTPase, is known to increase mitochondrial H2O2 generation in macrophages; however, the mechanism by which this occurs is not known. This study shows that Rac1 is localized in the mitochondria of alveolar macrophages from asbestosis patients, and mitochondrial import requires the C-terminal cysteine of Rac1 (Cys-189), which is post-translationally modified by geranylgeranylation. Furthermore, H2O2 generation mediated by mitochondrial Rac1 requires electron transfer from cytochrome c to a cysteine residue on Rac1 (Cys-178). Asbestos-exposed mice harboring a conditional deletion of Rac1 in macrophages demonstrated decreased oxidative stress and were significantly protected from developing pulmonary fibrosis.

J. 1980; 191: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar), and the heme group of cytochrome c accepts an electron from the cytochrome b-c1 complex and transfers the electron to the cytochrome oxidase (complex IV). Complex IV reduces O2 to water without production of ROS, but the partial reduction of O2, which results in the generation of ROS, can occur at multiple sites upstream of complex IV. Although cytochrome c is commonly linked to apoptosis, it is also known to play a role in mitochondrial H2O2 generation depending on its redox state (22Giorgio M. Migliaccio E. Orsini F. Paolucci D.

We have previously shown that knockdown of the iron-sulfur protein, Rieske, in complex III attenuates H2O2 generation in macrophages (4He C. Murthy S. McCormick M.L. Spitz D.R. Ryan A.J. Carter A.B.

However, the role of cytochrome c in macrophage H2O2 generation in pulmonary fibrosis has not been investigated. In this study, we discovered that Rac1 is localized and active in the mitochondria of alveolar macrophages obtained from asbestosis patients and that Rac1 mitochondrial import required the C-terminal cysteine residue (Cys-189) of Rac1. The presence of Rac1 in alveolar macrophage mitochondria was associated with the development of oxidative stress in the lung because the interaction of Rac1 with cytochrome c in mitochondria resulted in electron transfer between cytochrome c and Rac1, which increased H2O2 generation. Furthermore, mice harboring a conditional deletion of Rac1 in macrophages produced less H2O2 and demonstrated both less oxidative stress and fibrosis relative to wild type mice after asbestos exposure. These observations provide new insight into a novel mechanism whereby Rac1 is imported into the mitochondria and accepts electrons from cytochrome c, which modulates mitochondrial H2O2 levels in alveolar macrophages contributing to the development pulmonary fibrosis. Chrysotile asbestos was provided by the North American Insulation Manufacturers Association Fiber Repository. p-Hydroxyphenyl acetic acid, horseradish peroxidase (HRP), and reduced β-NAD phosphate tetrasodium (NADPH) were purchased from Sigma. The Human Subjects Review Board of the University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine approved the protocol of obtaining alveolar macrophages from normal volunteers. Normal volunteers had to meet the following criteria: 1) age between 18 and 55 years; 2) no history of cardiopulmonary disease or other chronic disease; 3) no prescription or nonprescription medication except oral contraceptives; 4) no recent or current evidence of infection; and 5) lifetime nonsmoker. Seventy five percent of the normal subjects were male between ages 30–55 years-old. Alveolar macrophages were also obtained from patients with asbestosis. Patients with asbestosis had to meet the following criteria: 1) FEV1 and carbon monoxide diffusing capacity at least 50% predicted; 2) current nonsmoker; 3) no recent or current evidence of infection; and 4) evidence of restrictive physiology on pulmonary function tests and interstitial fibrosis on chest computed tomography. The asbestosis patients were all males, 50–65 years-old, and had moderate-to-severe restrictive physiology for at least 5–10 years. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage was performed after subjects received intramuscular atropine, 0.6 mg, and local anesthesia. Each subsegment of the lung was lavaged with five 20-ml aliquots of normal saline, and the 1st aliquot in each was discarded. The percentage of alveolar macrophages was determined by Wright-Giemsa stain and varied from 90 to 98%. WT and Rac1 null C57BL/6 mice were used in these studies and all protocols were approved by the University of Iowa Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Rac1 null mice were generated by selectively disrupting the Rac1 gene in cells of the myeloid lineage, as described previously (24Glogauer M. Marchal C.C. Zhu F. Worku A. Clausen B.E. Foerster I.

Mice were administered 100 μg of chrysotile asbestos in 50 μl of normal saline intratracheally after being anesthetized with 3% isoflurane using a precision Fortec vaporizer (Cyprane, Keighley, UK). Twenty one days later, mice were euthanized with an overdose of isoflurane, and bronchoalveolar (BAL) was performed. BAL cells were collected by centrifugation of the BAL for 10 min at 220 × g, and cell differential was determined by Wright-Giemsa stain. Over 90% of the BAL cells were macrophages. THP-1 and MH-S cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and maintained as described in the manufacturer's instructions. All experiments were performed with 0.5% serum supplement. Full-length human Rac1 (NM_006908.3) was amplified by PCR using Rac1 cDNA in pUSEamp (Millipore) as a template plus forward and reverse primers containing 5′-BamHI or 3′-SalI sites. The resulting PCR product was cloned into pCR4-TOPO (Invitrogen), digested, and then ligated into the BamHI-SalI sites of pRK-Flag vector. The pRK-Flag Rac1 construct contains a Flag epitope on the N terminus. To generate the Rac1-V5-His6 construct, Rac1 cDNA containing amino acid residues 1–189 was amplified by PCR and cloned into pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Single Cys → Ser mutations in Rac1 were made by PCR using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene).

Immunoblot analyses were performed with the designated antibodies followed by the appropriate secondary antibody cross-linked to HRP. Macrophages were incubated with staurosporine (Sigma) at concentrations of 1 μm and 250 nm for 3 h, as a positive control. Whole cell lysates were prepared, and immunoblot analysis was performed using anti-caspase 3, active. Cells were transiently transfected with empty pcDNA3.1 vector or pcDNA3.1-Rac1-V5-His vectors. After 24 h cells were exposed to chrysotile asbestos 10 μg/cm2 for 3 h. Cells were harvested in Buffer B (PBS, 0.5 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, protease, and phosphatase inhibitors); the lysates briefly sonicated on ice, and cellular debris was pelleted at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Talon metal (cobalt) affinity resin (Clontech) was added to each lysate, and samples were rotated overnight at 4 °C. The Rac1-V5-His proteins were eluted by adding protein sample buffer and heating at 95 °C for 5 min. Lung tissue that had been perfused to remove red blood cells was homogenized directly into 5-sulfosalicylic acid (5% w/v) and centrifuged, and the supernatant was saved at −80 °C overnight for the glutathione assay.

Following intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (87.5 mg/kg) and xylazine (12.5 mg/kg) for anesthesia and a nonresponsive pedal reflex test, a microsurgical tracheotomy was performed. Controlled respiration was achieved through the tracheotomy, via a computer controlled Flexivent (Scireq, Canada) ventilator. Respiratory paralysis was induced through the administration of 0.1 mg/kg pancuronium. To maintain sedation throughout the imaging process, 1.5% isofluorane was administered through the ventilator. A BioVet (Supertron Technologies, Newark, NJ) system was used to monitor the animal's heart rate throughout the experiment. A Micro-CT II (Siemens Pre-Clinical Solutions, Knoxville, TN) was used for in vivo scanning of the mouse. As imaging of the lungs during spontaneous respiration can affect the image quality produce, the Intermittent Iso-pressure Breath Hold, which is a custom-gated imaging process, was utilized (28Namati E.

This technique triggered image acquisition during a forced breath hold with periods of hyperventilation between acquisitions. The micro-CT scanner setting for in vivo imaging was 60 peak kV, 500 μA, and an exposure time of 600 ms. A total of 720 projections were acquired over 200°. Image reconstruction resulted in a volumetric dataset over the thorax with 28-μm isotropic voxels (1,536 × 1,536 pixels and 1,024 image slices).

Isolated mitochondria from alveolar macrophages obtained from patients with asbestosis demonstrated significantly greater immunoreactive Rac1 relative to macrophage mitochondria from normal subjects (Fig. 1A). In contrast, no significant differences in Rac1 expression were found in whole cell lysates of alveolar macrophages taken from normal subjects and asbestosis patients (Fig. 1B). When mitochondrial Rac1 localization was expressed as a ratio of whole cell Rac1, alveolar macrophages obtained from patients with asbestosis had nearly 2.5-fold greater mitochondrial Rac1 expression relative to normal subjects (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, the activity of mitochondrial Rac1 was found to be nearly 4-fold higher in alveolar macrophages obtained from patients with asbestosis compared with normal subjects (Fig. 1D). To address the specificity of Rac1 mitochondrial localization in alveolar macrophage obtained from asbestosis patients, we determined if Rac2, a GTPase that is prevalent in macrophages, had a similar pattern of mitochondrial localization as Rac1. Isolated mitochondria from alveolar macrophages obtained from normal subjects demonstrated significantly greater immunoreactive Rac2 relative to macrophage mitochondria from asbestosis patients (Fig. 1E). This observation supports the fact that asbestos exposure induces Rac1 mitochondrial import and activation, as Rac2 is not activated in asbestos-exposed macrophages (data not shown). To investigate whether the mitochondria were the primary site of Rac1 activation and whether asbestos exposure increased mitochondrial Rac1 activation, alveolar macrophages were obtained from asbestosis patients and exposed to chrysotile asbestos ex vivo. Mitochondrial and membrane fractions were isolated, and Rac1 activation was determined. Rac1 activation in the mitochondria increased significantly after 30 min and continued to increase further in a time-dependent fashion, whereas activation in the membrane fraction remained at basal levels (Fig. 1F). Based on these novel observations, we formulated the hypothesis that expression and activity of Rac1 in the mitochondria have a role in alveolar macrophage H2O2 generation, which is critically linked to the development in pulmonary fibrosis. To determine the biological significance of Rac1-mediated mitochondrial H2O2 generation in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis, we exposed WT mice and mice with a conditional deletion of Rac1 in macrophages (Rac1 null) to chrysotile asbestos. After 21 days, the mice were euthanized; BAL was performed, and alveolar macrophages, which are the predominant (>90%) cell type in BAL fluid (Fig. 2A), were isolated to measure H2O2 generation. Alveolar macrophages obtained from WT mice generated H2O2 at a significantly higher rate than cells obtained from Rac1 null mice (Fig. 2B). To determine the role of mitochondria in H2O2 generation in vivo, WT and Rac1 null mice were exposed to chrysotile asbestos in a similar manner; alveolar macrophag"
https://openalex.org/W1999475535,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most prevalent cancer worldwide with about 600 000 new cases diagnosed each year. Understanding the molecular pathways that lead to HNSCC is crucial to identify new targets for anti-cancer drug development. Protein kinase Cɛ (PKCɛ) is elevated in HNSCC and regulates the activation of Akt, Stat3 and Rho GTPases. To date, the molecular mechanism of PKCɛ dysregulation in HNSCC remains to be elucidated. In silico analysis identified three putative microRNA-107 (miR-107) binding sites in the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of PKCɛ. An inverse relationship was revealed between miR-107 and PKCɛ in HNSCC cell lines. Delivery of miR-107 reduced PKCɛ levels in SCC15, SCC25 and CAL27, three HNSCC cell lines with high PKCɛ and low miR-107. The activity of a luciferase reporter construct containing the 3′-UTR of PKCɛ was downregulated by miR-107 and mutations in the three cognate miR-107 binding sites completely ablated the regulation by miR-107. Treatment with miR-107 significantly blocked cell proliferation, DNA replication, colony formation and invasion in SCC25 and CAL27 cells. Ectopic expression of miR-resistant PKCɛ was sufficient to partially rescue the loss-of-function phenotype in miR-107-overexpressing SCC25 cells. Tumor growth in nude mice was retarded by 93±7% in CAL27/miR-107 cells compared with CAL27/miR-control cells. Last, human primary HNSCC tumors with elevated PKCɛ had reduced miR-107 expression. Our results demonstrate that PKCɛ is directly regulated by miR-107 and, moreover, suggest that miR-107 may be a potential anti-cancer therapeutic for HNSCC."

However, little is known about the functional impact of CRYAB on NPC progression. In this study we evaluated the NPC tumor-suppressive and progression-associated functions of CRYAB. Activation of CRYAB suppressed NPC tumor formation in nude mice. Overexpression of CRYAB affected NPC progression-associated phenotypes such as loss of cell adhesion, invasion, interaction with the tumor microenvironment, invasive protrusion formation in three dimensional Matrigel culture, as well as expression of epithelial–mesenchymal transition-associated markers. CRYAB mediates this ability to suppress cancer progression by inhibition of E-cadherin cytoplasmic internalization and maintenance of β-catenin in the membrane that subsequently reduces the levels of expression of critical downstream targets such as cyclin-D1 and c-myc. Both ectopically expressed and recombinant CRYAB proteins were associated with endogenous E-cadherin and β-catenin, and, thus, the cadherin/catenin adherens junction. The CRYAB α-crystallin core domain is responsible for the interaction of CRYAB with both E-cadherin and β-catenin. Taken together, these results indicate that CRYAB functions to suppress NPC progression by associating with the cadherin/catenin adherens junction and modulating the β-catenin function."
https://openalex.org/W1994010844,"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) binds to two distinct receptors, TNFR1/p55 and TNFR2/p75. TNF-α is implicated in the processes of tumor growth, survival, differentiation, invasion, metastases, secretion of cytokines and pro-angiogenic factors. We have shown that TNFR2/p75 signaling promotes ischemia-induced angiogenesis via modulation of several angiogenic growth factors. We hypothesized that TNFR2/p75 may promote tumor growth and angiogenesis. Growth of mouse Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC1) and/or mouse melanoma B16 cell was evaluated in wild type (WT), p75 knockout (KO) and double p55KO/p75KO mouse tumor xenograft models. Compared with WT and p55KO/p75KO mice, growth of tumors in p75KO mice was significantly decreased (twofold) in both LLC and B16 tumors. Tumor growth inhibition was correlated with decreases in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and capillary density, as well as bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells incorporation into the functional capillary network, and an increase in apoptotic cells in LLC xenografts. Gene array analysis of tumor tissues showed a decrease in gene expression in pathways that promote tumor angiogenesis and cell survival. Blocking p75 by short-hairpin RNA in cultured LLCs led to increases in TNF-mediated apoptosis, as well as decreases in the constitutive and TNF-mediated expression of angiogenic growth factors (VEGF, HGF, PLGF), and SDF-1α receptor CXCR4. In summary, p75 is essential for tumor angiogenesis and survival in highly vascularized murine lung tumor xenografts. Blocking p75 expression may lead to tumor regression. This may represent new and effective therapy against lung neoplasms and potentially tumors of other origin."
https://openalex.org/W1996768192,"Lysyl oxidase-like-2 (LOXL2) induces tumor progression and fibrosis. It also inhibits the differentiation of keratinocytes promoting development of squamous cell carcinomas. Stimulation of HaCaT skin keratinocytes with exogenous LOXL2 or overexpression of LOXL2 in these cells inhibits their differentiation as manifested by inhibition of calcium or vitamin D-induced involucrin expression. The inhibition was abrogated by the LOXL2 function-blocking monoclonal antibody AB0023 as well as by an anti-LOXL2 polyclonal antibody. Surprisingly, a point-mutated form of LOXL2 (LOXL2(Y689F)) lacking enzymatic activity, as well as a LOXL2 deletion mutant lacking the entire catalytic domain, also inhibited calcium or vitamin D-induced up-regulation of involucrin expression, suggesting that the enzymatic activity of LOXL2 is not required for this activity. This conclusion was supported by experiments that showed that β-aminoproprionitrile, an irreversible competitive inhibitor of the enzymatic activity of all lysyl oxidases, is unable to abolish the LOXL2-induced inhibition of HaCaT cell differentiation. The activity of LOXL2(Y689F) required the presence of the fourth scavenger receptor-cysteine-rich (SRCR) domain of LOXL2, which is also the binding target of AB0023. Epitope-tagged LOXL2(Y689F) was internalized at 37 °C by HaCaT cells. The internalization was inhibited by AB0023 and by competition with unlabeled LOXL2, suggesting that these cells may express a LOXL2 receptor. Our results suggest that agents that inhibit the enzymatic activity of LOXL2 may not suffice to inhibit completely the effects of LOXL2 on complex processes that involve altered states of cellular differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1994503647,"The heparan sulfate 6-O-endosulfatase (SULF2) promotes growth and metastasis of solid tumors. We recently identified that cytosine methylation of the SULF2 promoter is associated with better survival of resected lung adenocarcinoma patients, and now also demonstrates a marginal improvement in survival of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients receiving standard chemotherapy (hazard ratio=0.63, P=0.07). Subsequent studies focused on investigating the effect of methylation on SULF2 expression and its genome-wide impact. The genes and pathways modulated by epigenetic inactivation of SULF2 and the effects on sensitivity to chemotherapy were characterized in vitro and in vivo. Silencing SULF2 through small interfering RNA or methylation primarily increased expression of interferon-inducible genes including ISG15, a marker for increased sensitivity to topoisomerase-1 inhibitors such as camptothecin (CPT). NSCLC cell lines with methylated SULF2 (SULF2M) express 60-fold higher ISG15 compared with SULF2 unmethylated (SULF2U) NSCLC cell lines and normal human bronchial epithelial cells. In vitro, SULF2M and high ISG15 (ISG15H)-expressing NSCLC cell lines were 134-fold more sensitive to CPT than SULF2U and low ISG15 (ISG15L)-expressing cell lines. Topotecan, a soluble analog of CPT and FDA-approved anticancer drug, dramatically arrested the growth of SULF2M-ISG15H, but not SULF2U-ISG15L lung tumors in nude mice (P<0.002). Similarly, high ISG15 expression that is comparable to the topotecan (TPT)-sensitive NSCLC cell lines was found in tumors from 25% of NSCLC patients compared with normal lung, indicating a potential to identify and target the most sensitive NSCLC subpopulation for personalized TPT therapy."

In the DMRV/hIBM mouse model, which exhibits hyposialylation in various tissues in addition to muscle atrophy, weakness, and degeneration, we recently have demonstrated that the myopathic phenotype was prevented by oral administration of N-acetylneuraminic acid, N-acetylmannosamine, and sialyllactose, underscoring the crucial role of hyposialylation in the disease pathomechanism. The choice for the preferred molecule, however, was limited probably by the complex pharmacokinetics of sialic acids and the lack of biomarkers that could clearly show dose response. To address these issues, we screened several synthetic sugar compounds that could increase sialylation more remarkably and allow demonstration of measurable effects in the DMRV/hIBM mice. In this study, we found that tetra-O-acetylated N-acetylmannosamine increased cell sialylation most efficiently, and in vivo evaluation in DMRV/hIBM mice revealed a more dramatic, measurable effect and improvement in muscle phenotype, enabling us to establish analysis of protein biomarkers that can be used for assessing response to treatment.

The molecular mechanisms underlying this clinically important association are as yet unknown. Here, we studied the peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1) gene at 1p34.1 for promoter methylation and expression in primary gliomas and investigated its role in radio- and chemosensitivity of glioma cells in vitro. In total, we screened primary glioma tissues from 93 patients for methylation of the 5′-CpG island of PRDX1 by sodium bisulfite sequencing. PRDX1 mRNA and protein expression levels were determined in subsets of the tumours by quantitative PCR and western blot analysis, respectively. PRDX1 hypermethylation and reduced expression were frequently detected in oligodendroglial tumours and secondary glioblastomas, but not in primary glioblastomas. In oligodendroglial tumours, both PRDX1 hypermethylation and reduced mRNA expression were significantly associated with 1p/19q-deletion. Stable knockdown of PRDX1 by lentiviral transduction of short-hairpin (sh)RNA constructs significantly increased apoptosis and reduced cell viability of Hs683 glioma cells exposed to ionizing irradiation or temozolomide in vitro. Taken together, our findings indicate that epigenetic silencing of PRDX1 is frequent in 1p/19q-deleted oligodendroglial tumours and likely contributes to radio- and chemosensitivity of these tumours."

In the present study the role of Ca2+/CaM in the regulation of the ligand-dependent activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been examined in living cells. We show that addition of different cell permeable CaM antagonists to cultured cells or loading cells with a Ca2+ chelator inhibited ligand-dependent EGFR auto(trans)phosphorylation. This occurred also in the presence of inhibitors of protein kinase C, CaM-dependent protein kinase II and calcineurin, which are known Ca2+- and/or Ca2+/CaM-dependent EGFR regulators, pointing to a direct effect of Ca2+/CaM on the receptor. Furthermore, we demonstrate that down-regulation of CaM in conditional CaM knock out cells stably transfected with the human EGFR decreased its ligand-dependent phosphorylation. Substitution of six basic amino acid residues within the CaM-binding domain (CaM-BD) of the EGFR by alanine resulted in a decreased phosphorylation of the receptor and of its downstream substrate phospholipase Cγ1. These results support the hypothesis that Ca2+/CaM regulates the EGFR activity by directly interacting with the CaM-BD of the receptor located at its cytosolic juxtamembrane region. Calmodulin (CaM) is the major component of calcium signaling pathways mediating the action of various effectors. Transient increases in the intracellular calcium level triggered by a variety of stimuli lead to the formation of Ca2+/CaM complexes, which interact with and activate target proteins.

The epidermal growth factor as well as many other cell stimulatory factors induces an early and transient increase in the cytosolic concentration of free Ca2+ (for review see Refs. 1Berridge M.J.

Struct. Funct. Bioinformat. 2006; 62: 1036-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Activation of the EGFR upon ligand-induced dimerization appears to occur by an asymmetric allosteric mechanism where the C-terminal lobe of the kinase domain of one of the monomers interacts with the N-terminal lobe of the apposed monomer, thus forming an active dimer (21Zhang X.

The intracellular juxtamembrane region of the receptor, which contains the CaM-BD, has been shown to be indispensable for this allosteric activation mechanism to be operative (22Thiel K.W.

Nevertheless, the actual mechanism by which CaM plays this activating role is not yet known. In this report we present new evidence demonstrating that the Ca2+/CaM complex plays a positive role in the ligand-dependent activation of the EGFR in cultured cells using CaM antagonists as well as conditional CaM-KO cells. Replacement of six out of eight positive charged residues within the CaM-BD of the receptor by alanine dramatically impairs its activating capacity, suggesting that the direct interaction of Ca2+/CaM with the EGFR at the juxtamembrane region is responsible for this regulation.

The ET1–55/EGFR cell line was originally derived from DT40 CaMII−/− cells (28Schmalzigaug R. Ye Q. Berchtold M.W.

All adherent cell lines were propagated in DMEM supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 40 μg/ml gentamicin, and 10% (v/v) FBS, except for NB69 cells where 15% (v/v) FBS was used, in a humidified atmosphere of 5% (v/v) CO2 in air at 37 °C. The DT40wt/EGFR and ET1–55/EGFR cells were grown in suspension in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1% (v/v) chicken serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 40 μg/ml gentamicin as above but at 40 °C. The cells were maintained for 24 h in the absence of serum before performing the experiments. When CaM down-regulation in ET1–55/EGFR cells was required, treatment with 1 μg/ml tetracycline was performed for the time indicated in the legend to the figures. The human wild type EGFR (with the sequence 645RRRHIVRKRTLRRLLQ660 at its CaM-BD) and a mutant receptor with the modified sequence 645AAAHIVAAATLRRLLQ660 that was denoted as EGFRmA1A2 (and in abbreviated form A1A2) both cloned in the pcDNA6A vector (Invitrogen) as previously described (29Hsu S.C. Hung M.C. Characterization of a novel tripartite nuclear localization sequence in the EGFR family.J. Biol.

The HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the wild type or the A1A2 mutant EGFR as follows: cells were seeded in P6 multi-well plates (7.5 × 104 cells per well) and grown in medium plus 10% (v/v) FBS as indicated above to ∼80% confluence. The cells were treated with 25 μm chloroquine for 15 min, and thereafter transfected with 5 μg of vector DNA (empty pcDNA6A, pcDNA6A/EGFRwt, or pcDNA6A/EGFRmA1A2) in 1 ml of a buffer containing 124 mm CaCl2, 25 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.05), 5 mm KCl, 125 mm NaCl, 0.75 mm Na2HPO4, and 6 mm glucose. After 8–10 h of incubation the medium was replaced and the cells were maintained for 24 h in DMEM with 10% (v/v) FBS. The medium was then replaced by serum-free DMEM 24 h before performing the experiments. Wild type DT40 cells, and ET1–50 and ET1–55 cells were stably transfected with the pcDNA6A/EGFRwt vector by electroporation, and the clones were selected by treatment with 10 μg/ml blasticidin S for 2 weeks. The number of viable cells was measured by the Trypan blue exclusion method as described (30Altman S.A. Randers L. Rao G. Comparison of trypan blue dye exclusion and fluorometric assays for mammalian cell viability determinations.Biotechnol. Prog. 1993; 9: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). As a surrogate marker of cell disruption the amount of LDH activity in the culture medium was monitored as described (31Emery A.E. The determination of lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes in normal human muscle and other tissues.Biochem. J. 1967; 105: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, the content of intracellular ATP was followed using a luciferase assay kit (Invitrogen Molecular ProbesTM) essentially as described (32Kimmich G.A. Randles J. Brand J.S. Assay of picomole amounts of ATP, ADP, and AMP using the luciferase enzyme system.Anal. Biochem. 1975; 69: 187-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). This also allowed ascertaining that no limitation was imposed on EGFR phosphorylation upon stimulation of the cells with EGF. Adherent cells were grown to confluence in P6 multi-well plates as indicated above and maintained in 1.5 ml of FBS-free medium for 24 h before performing the experiments. The non-adherent DT40wt/EGFR and ET1–55/EGFR cells were grown in suspension and serum-starved for 4 h before performing the experiments. When CaM down-regulation was required, the ET1–55/EGFR and DT40wt/EGFR cells (negative control) were treated with 1 μg/ml tetracycline for the time indicated in the figure legends prior to EGFR stimulation. In the experiments involving inhibitors of PKC (GF109203X), CaMK-II (KN-93) and/or calcineurin (cyclosporine A); CaM antagonists (W-7, W-13, or mMLCK peptide); the Ca2+ ionophore A23187; and the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM, the cells were pre-treated with the compounds prior to stimulation with 10 nm EGF. The reaction was stopped upon removal of the medium and addition of 1 ml of ice-cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. Cells were collected in Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded and the cells were lysed with Laemmli buffer and processed for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis as described below. The TCA method allows the quick termination of the phosphorylation reaction and to more efficiently prevent the spurious dephosphorylation of EGFR than the classical technique described in Ref. 33Lax I. Bellot F. Howk R. Ullrich A. Givol D. Schlessinger J. Functional analysis of the ligand binding site of EGF-receptor utilizing chimeric chicken/human receptor molecules.EMBO J. 1989; 8: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar using a RIPA buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1% (w/v) p-nitrophenyl-phosphate, 1% (w/v) sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF, and 5 μl/ml of protease inhibitor mixture. Thus, the TCA method may be advantageous for determining EGFR auto(trans)phosphorylation in living cells (supplemental Fig. S2). Proteins were separated by slab SDS-PAGE in 5–20% (w/v) linear gradient of polyacrylamide and 0.1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate at pH 8.3. When required, 5–10 mm EGTA was added to the sample buffer to attain a mobility of CaM to 21 kDa (34Burgess W.H. Jemiolo D.K. Kretsinger R.H. Interaction of calcium and calmodulin in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 623: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). After processing by SDS-PAGE, proteins were electrotransferred from the gel to a PVDF membrane (or a nitrocellulose membrane in the case of CaM) for 2 h at 300 mA in a buffer containing 48 mm Tris-base, 36.6 mm l-glycine, 0.04% (w/v) SDS and 20% (v/v) methanol; fixed with 0.2% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, and 2.7 mm KCl (TNK buffer) for 45 min; and transiently stained with Fast Green to ascertain the regularity of the transfer procedure. The membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin or 5% (w/v) fat-free powdered milk, as recommended by the antibody suppliers, in 0.1% (w/v) Tween-20, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 500 mm NaCl, and 0.25 mm KCl (T-TBS buffer). This was followed by probing overnight at 4 °C using a 1/2000 dilution of the corresponding primary antibody, and thereafter for 1 h at room temperature using a 1/5000 dilution of the appropriate secondary anti-IgG antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase. The bands were visualized upon development with the ECL reagents following instructions from the manufacturer and exposure of x-ray films for appropriate periods of time. The intensities of the bands were quantified with a computer-assisted scanning densitometer using the NIH Image 1.60 program. Cells were detached with 2 mm EDTA avoiding trypsin treatment, washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and incubated with 4 μg/ml EGF-tetramethylrhodamine for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark and analysis by flow cytometry using the FL2-H (585 nm) channel. Control cells were either kept untreated to detect background fluorescence, or pre-incubated with 10 μm non-labeled EGF to prevent EGF-tetramethylrhodamine binding to measure nonspecific binding. Alternatively, EGFR was labeled using an anti-EGFR antibody recognizing the extracellular region of the receptor and an Alexa Fluor®488-labeled anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody, and the signal was analyzed using the FL1-H (488 nm) channel. The following controls were included: (i) an anti-EGFR antibody recognizing the intracellular region of the receptor to ascertain cell intactness; (ii) absence of primary antibodies to measure nonspecific binding; and (iii) absence of any antibody to measure the background fluorescence. The low fluorescence attained in all these controls was subtracted from the mean signal attained with the antibody recognizing the EGFR extracellular region. Protein concentration was determined by the BCA method (35Stoscheck C.M. Quantitation of protein.Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 50-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar) after precipitation with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, and using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Where appropriate the results are presented as the mean ± S.E. of the densitometry of the bands detected by Western blot after loading correction using protein stained by Fast Green, GAPDH, or tubulin-α; or the EGFR expressed at the cell surface as determined by FACS. Otherwise representative data from separated experiments repeated 2–5 times with essentially identical results are presented. We first showed that cells treated with a variety of cell-permeable CaM antagonists exhibit a lower EGF-dependent auto(trans)phosphorylation of the receptor. The naphthalenesulfonamide derivative W-7 inhibits the EGF-dependent activation of the receptor in EGFR-T17 fibroblasts, albeit with very low efficiency but in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast, a stronger inhibition was obtained"

https://openalex.org/W2082302224,"Mini-chromosome maintenance (Mcm) proteins are part of the replication-licensing complex that is loaded onto chromatin during the G1-phase of the cell cycle and required for initiation of DNA replication in the subsequent S-phase. Mcm proteins are typically loaded in excess of the number of locations that are used during S-phase. Nonetheless, partial depletion of Mcm proteins leads to cancers and stem cell deficiencies. Mcm2 deficient mice, on a 129Sv genetic background, display a high rate of thymic lymphoblastic lymphoma. Here array comparative genomic hybridization is used to characterize the genetic damage accruing in these tumors. The predominant events are deletions averaging less than 0.5 Mbp, considerably shorter than observed in prior studies using alternative mouse lymphoma models or human tumors. Such deletions facilitate identification of specific genes and pathways responsible for the tumors. Mutations in many genes that have been implicated in human lymphomas are recapitulated in this mouse model. These features, and the fact that the mutation underlying the accelerated genetic damage does not target a specific gene or pathway a priori, are valuable features of this mouse model for identification of tumor suppressor genes. Genes affected in all tumors include Pten, Tcfe2a, Mbd3 and Setd1b. Notch1 and additional genes are affected in subsets of tumors. The high frequency of relatively short deletions is consistent with elevated recombination between nearby stalled replication forks in Mcm2-deficient mice."
https://openalex.org/W1982898170,"Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a malignancy derived from the calcitonin-producing C-cells of the thyroid gland. Oncogenic mutations of the Ret proto-oncogene are found in all heritable forms of MTC and roughly one half of the sporadic cases. However, several lines of evidence argue for the existence of additional genetic lesions necessary for the development of MTC. Sprouty (Spry) family of genes is composed of four members in mammals (Spry1-4). Some Spry family members have been proposed as candidate tumor-suppressor genes in a variety of cancerous pathologies. In this work, we show that targeted deletion of Spry1 causes C-cell hyperplasia, a precancerous lesion preceding MTC, in young adult mice. Expression of Spry1 restrains proliferation of the MTC-derived cell line, TT. Finally, we found that the Spry1 promoter is frequently methylated in MTC and that Spry1 expression is consequently decreased. These findings identify Spry1 as a candidate tumor-suppressor gene in MTC."
https://openalex.org/W2089673998,"Although increasing evidence suggests a critical role for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor β (β-PDGFR) signaling in prostate cancer (PCa) progression, the precise roles of β-PDGFR and PDGF isoform-specific cell signaling have not been delineated. Recently, we identified the PDGF-D isoform as a ligand for β-PDGFR in PCa and showed that PDGF-D is activated by serine protease-mediated proteolytic removal of the CUB domain in a two-step process, yielding first a hemidimer (HD) and then a growth factor domain dimer. Herein, we demonstrate that the expression of PDGF-D in human PCa LNCaP cells leads to enhanced bone tumor growth and bone responses in immunodeficient mice. Histopathological analyses of bone tumors generated by PDGF-D-expressing LNCaP cells (LNCaP-PDGF-D) revealed osteolytic and osteoblastic responses similar to those observed in human PCa bone metastases. Importantly, we discovered a novel function of PDGF-D in the regulation of osteoclast differentiation, independent of the RANKL/RANK signaling axis. Although both PDGF-B and -D were able to activate β-PDGFR, only PDGF-D was able to induce osteoclastic differentiation in vitro, and upregulate the expression and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor of activated T cells 1, a master transcription factor for osteoclastogenesis. Taken together, these results reveal a new function of PDGF-D as a regulator of osteoclastic differentiation, an activity critical for the establishment of skeletal metastatic deposit in PCa patients."
https://openalex.org/W2031874893,"Here, we report that activation of different types of tissue macrophages, including microglia, by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or GM-CSF stimulation correlates with the quantitative redistribution of NADPH oxidase (cyt b(558)) from the plasma membrane to an intracellular stimulus-responsive storage compartment. Cryo-immunogold labeling of gp91(phox) and CeCl(3) cytochemistry showed the presence of gp91(phox) and oxidant production in numerous small (<100 nm) vesicles. Cell homogenization and sucrose gradient centrifugation in combination with transferrin-HRP/DAB ablation showed that more than half of cyt b(558) is present in fractions devoid of endosomal markers, which is supported by morphological evidence to show that the cyt b(558)-containing compartment is distinct from endosomes or biosynthetic organelles. Streptolysin-O-mediated guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate loading of Ra2 microglia caused exocytosis of a major complement of cyt b(558) under conditions where lysosomes or endosomes were not mobilized. We establish phagocytic particles and soluble mediators ATP, TNFα, and CD40L as physiological inducers of cyt b(558) exocytosis to the cell surface, and by shRNA knockdown, we identify Rab27A/B as positive or negative regulators of vesicular mobilization to the phagosome or the cell surface, respectively. Exocytosis was followed by clathrin-dependent internalization of cyt b(558), which could be blocked by a dominant negative mutant of the clathrin-coated pit-associated protein Eps15. Re-internalized cyt b(558) did not reach lysosomes but associated with recycling endosomes and undefined vesicular elements. In conclusion, cyt b(558) depends on clathrin for internalization, and in activated macrophages NADPH oxidase occupies a Rab27A/B-regulated secretory compartment, which allows rapid agonist-induced redistribution of superoxide production in the cell."

https://openalex.org/W2106013554,"Glutathione-S-transferase of the Pi class (GSTP1) is frequently overexpressed in a variety of solid tumors and has been identified as a potential therapeutic target for cancer therapy. GSTP1 is a phase II detoxification enzyme and conjugates the tripeptide glutathione to endogenous metabolites and xenobiotics, thereby limiting the efficacy of antitumor chemotherapeutic treatments. In addition, GSTP1 regulates cellular stress responses and apoptosis by sequestering and inactivating c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Thiazolides are a novel class of antibiotics for the treatment of intestinal pathogens with no apparent side effects on the host cells and tissue. Here we show that thiazolides induce a GSTP1-dependent and glutathione-enhanced cell death in colorectal tumor cell lines. Downregulation of GSTP1 reduced the apoptotic activity of thiazolides, whereas overexpression enhanced it. Thiazolide treatment caused strong Jun kinase activation and Jun kinase-dependent apoptosis. As a critical downstream target of Jun kinase we identified the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 homolog Bim. Thiazolides induced Bim expression and activation in a JNK-dependent manner. Downregulation of Bim in turn significantly blocked thiazolide-induced apoptosis. Whereas low concentrations of thiazolides failed to induce apoptosis directly, they potently sensitized colon cancer cells to TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand- and chemotherapeutic drug-induced cell death. Although GSTP1 overexpression generally limits chemotherapy and thus antitumor treatment, our study identifies GSTP1 as Achilles’ heel and thiazolides as novel interesting apoptosis sensitizer for the treatment of colorectal tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2025773336,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is often detected at a late stage, hence the identification of new therapies that have potential to block tumor progression is critical for this lethal disease. N-cadherin upregulation has been observed in many cancers including PDA, however, a causal role for this cell adhesion receptor in disease progression has yet to be defined. The concomitant expression of oncogenic KrasG12D and mutant p53 (Trp53R172H) in the murine pancreas results in metastatic PDA that recapitulates the cognate features of human pancreatic cancer providing an excellent animal model to identify genes required for tumor progression. Here we determine the consequences of genetically manipulating N-cadherin expression in a mouse model of PDA. Remarkably, mice with reduced N-cadherin expression (that is, Ncad−/+) survived 25% longer (177 vs 142 days, P<0.05) than animals expressing two wild-type N-cadherin (Cdh2) alleles. The survival benefit is likely due to a cumulative effect of N-cadherin's role in different aspects of tumorigenesis including tumor-cell survival, growth, migration and invasion. Interestingly, reduced hedgehog signaling may contribute to the better prognosis for the Ncad−/+ mice. Moreover, the matrix metalloproteinase MMP-7, associated with poor prognosis in PDA, was reduced in Ncad−/+ tumors. Finally, Ncad−/+ tumor cells exhibited decreased FGF-stimulated ERK1/2 activation consistent with N-cadherin's ability to promote FGFR signaling. These data support a critical role for N-cadherin in PDA and its potential prognostic value. Additionally, this study provides in vivo genetic evidence that the cell-surface protein N-cadherin represents a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of pancreatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2095539567,"The membrane-anchored matrix metalloproteinase-regulator RECK is often downregulated in cancers; in some cases, a significant correlation between the level of residual RECK in resected tumors and patient survival has been noted. Furthermore, restoration of RECK expression in certain cancer-derived cell lines results in reduced tumorigenicity. Here we report that acute RECK expression in colon carcinoma cells results in cell cycle-arrest accompanied by downregulation of a ubiquitin ligase component, S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2), and upregulation of its substrate, p27KIP1. Our data indicate that RECK-induced growth suppression is at least partially dependent on p27, and that RECK and type I collagen share similar effects on the SKP2–p27 pathway. Importantly, in patients with lung, colorectal and bladder cancers, the RECK/SKP2 ratio is high in normal tissues and lower in the cancer tissues. These findings reveal a novel molecular pathway linking cell-cycle progression to RECK downregulation, extracellular matrix degradation and SKP2 upregulation, and suggest that treatment regimens that induce RECK expression could be promising cancer therapies."
https://openalex.org/W1981408020,"Snail1 is a transcriptional factor essential for triggering epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Moreover, Snail1 promotes resistance to apoptosis, an effect associated to PTEN gene repression and Akt stimulation. In this article we demonstrate that Snail1 activates Akt at an additional level, as it directly binds to and activates this protein kinase. The interaction is observed in the nucleus and increases the intrinsic Akt activity. We determined that Akt2 is the isoform interacting with Snail1, an association that requires the pleckstrin homology domain in Akt2 and the C-terminal half in Snail1. Snail1 enhances the binding of Akt2 to the E-cadherin (CDH1) promoter and Akt2 interference prevents Snail1 repression of CDH1 gene. We also show that Snail1 binding increases Akt2 intrinsic activity on histone H3 and have identified Thr45 as a residue modified on this protein. Phosphorylation of Thr45 in histone H3 is sensitive to Snail1 and Akt2 cellular levels; moreover, Snail1 upregulates the binding of phosphoThr45 histone H3 to the CDH1 promoter. These results uncover an unexpected role of Akt2 in transcriptional control and point out to phosphorylation of Thr45 in histone H3 as a new epigenetic mark related to Snail1 and Akt2 action."
https://openalex.org/W2014476817,"Mitotic catastrophe occurs when cells enter mitosis with damaged DNA or excess centrosomes. Cells overexpressing the centrosome protein CP110 or depleted of cyclin F, which targets CP110 for destruction, have more than two centrosomes and undergo mitotic catastrophe. Our studies show centrosome reduplication and mitotic catastrophe in osteosarcoma cells inducibly expressing a p27Kip1 mutant (termed p27K) that binds cyclins but not cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). p27K inhibited cell proliferation but not CDK activity or cell cycle progression. It did not induce apoptosis; however, cells expressing p27K had more than two centrosomes and, indicative of mitotic catastrophe, irregularly shaped nuclei or multiple micronuclei. p27K interacted with cyclin F in vivo (as did endogenous p27Kip1) and displaced cyclin F from CP110. Depletion of CP110 rescued p27K-expressing cells from centrosome reduplication and mitotic catastrophe. Collectively, our data show that p27Kip1 can perturb mitosis and suggest that it does so by sequestering cyclin F, which prevents its interaction with and the subsequent degradation of CP110, ultimately resulting in centrosome reduplication, mitotic catastrophe and abrogation of cell proliferation."

Overall, this suggests that the role of Aft1 in chromosome stability is not related to regulation of the iron-regulon or iron homeostasis. Many lines of evidence suggest that Aft1 has a role at the kinetochore. The kinetochore complex consists of many multiprotein subcomplexes that assemble in a hierarchical fashion onto centromeric (CEN) DNA physically linking the chromosomes to microtubule spindles (reviewed in Ref. 12Westermann S.

Despite the importance of pericentric cohesin, the molecular mechanism by which the Ctf19 complex recruits cohesin has yet to be ascertained. In this study we further investigate the role of Aft1 in chromosome stability and its interaction with the kinetochore. Surprisingly, we discover that Aft1 interacts with Iml3 and has a role in promoting pericentric cohesin. Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table 1.

Cell pellets were resuspended in Tackett extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% Tween 20, 2 mm MgCl2, 200 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors (Sigma, P-8215)) and an equal volume of glass beads (BioSpec Products, 11079105). Cells were lysed through vortexing (five 1-min blasts with incubation on ice between vortexing) followed by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 15 min to isolate whole-cell extract. Samples were normalized by protein concentration and incubated end-over-end for 2 h at 4 °C with magnetic Dynabeads (Dynal, Invitrogen, 143-01) crossed-linked to rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Chemicon, PP64) or with magnetic protein G Dynabeads (Invitrogen, 100.03D) cross-linked to mouse HA.11 monoclonal antibody (Covance, MMS-101P). Dynabeads were collected with a magnet, washed three times with 1 ml of cold Tackett extraction buffer, and resuspended in 25 μl of modified 1× loading buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol). Purified and co-purified proteins were eluted from the beads at 65 °C for 10 min and transferred to a new tube. β-Mercaptoethanol was added to a final concentration of 200 mm, and samples were placed at 95 °C for 10 min. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Primary antibodies used are as follows: anti-TAP (Thermo Scientific, CAB1001, 1:5000), anti-Myc (Roche Applied Science, 11667149001, 1:800), and anti-HA (Covance, MMS-101P, 1:1000).

Microscopy was performed on a Leica DMI6000B fluorescent microscope (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzler Germany), equipped with a Sutter DG4 light source (Sutter Instruments), Ludl emission filter wheel with Chroma band pass emission filters (Ludl Electronic Products Ltd.), and Hamamatsu Orca AG camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Herrsching am Ammersee, Germany). Images were collected and analyzed using Velocity 4.3.2 Build 23 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Analysis was performed on images collapsed into two dimensions using the “extended focus” in Velocity. To elucidate the function of Aft1 in chromosome stability, we first sought to identify the individual kinetochore protein or protein subcomplex that interacts with Aft1. As Iml3 was found to interact with Aft1 by yeast two-hybrid (13Wong J. Nakajima Y. Westermann S. Shang C. Kang J.S. Goodner C. Houshmand P. Fields S. Chan C.S. Drubin D. Barnes G. Hazbun T.

https://openalex.org/W1969625563,"The growth factor receptor-bound protein (Grb) 14 is an adaptor molecule of the Grb7/10/14 family with characteristic Between Plekstrin and SH2 (BPS) domains serving to avidly bind tyrosine kinases. Grb14 inhibits insulin receptor (IR) catalytic activity through interaction with the BPS domain and impedes peptide substrate binding. Members of this Grb family have also been shown to interact with other kinases through their SH2 domain. Here we examined the functional role of Grb14 in thyroid cancer using loss- and gain-of-function approaches. Stable knockdown of Grb14 in thyroid cancer cells facilitated IR signaling. In contrast, RET phosphorylation was diminished in concert with reduced activation of Akt and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Loss of Grb14 also resulted in diminished cell proliferation and invasion both in vitro and in mouse flank xenografts. In complementary studies, forced expression of Grb14 interrupted IR signaling but facilitated RET activation, STAT3 and Akt phosphorylation. Consistent with these findings Grb14 overexpression enhanced cell invasion and resulted in striking metastases in an orthotopic thyroid cancer mouse xenograft model. Primary human thyroid cancer microarrays revealed a positive correlation between Grb14 expression and invasive behavior. Our findings uncover a new role for Grb14 in finely tuning receptor signaling and modulating thyroid cancer progression."
