PAR2 activates transient receptor potential (TRP) channels of nociceptive neurons to induce neurogenic inflammation and pain. Although proteases that cleave PAR2 at non-canonical sites can trigger distinct signaling cascades, the functional importance of the PAR2-biased agonism is uncertain. We investigated whether neutrophil elastase, a biased agonist of PAR2, causes inflammation and pain by activating PAR2 and TRP vanilloid 4 (TRPV4). Elastase cleaved human PAR2 at Ala66↓Ser67 and Ser67↓Val68. Elastase stimulated PAR2-dependent cAMP accumulation and ERK1/2 activation, but not Ca2+ mobilization, in KNRK cells. Elastase induced PAR2 coupling to Gαs but not Gαq in HEK293 cells. Although elastase did not promote recruitment of G protein-coupled receptor kinase-2 (GRK2) or β-arrestin to PAR2, consistent with its inability to promote receptor endocytosis, elastase did stimulate GRK6 recruitment. Elastase caused PAR2-dependent sensitization of TRPV4 currents in Xenopus laevis oocytes by adenylyl cyclase- and protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent mechanisms. Elastase stimulated PAR2-dependent cAMP formation and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and a PAR2- and TRPV4-mediated influx of extracellular Ca2+ in mouse nociceptors. Adenylyl cyclase and PKA-mediated elastase-induced activation of TRPV4 and hyperexcitability of nociceptors. Intraplantar injection of elastase to mice caused edema and mechanical hyperalgesia by PAR2- and TRPV4-mediated mechanisms. Thus, the elastase-biased agonism of PAR2 causes Gαs-dependent activation of adenylyl cyclase and PKA, which activates TRPV4 and sensitizes nociceptors to cause inflammation and pain. Our results identify a novel mechanism of elastase-induced activation of TRPV4 and expand the role of PAR2 as a mediator of protease-driven inflammation and pain.Background: Proteases cleave protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR2), which activates transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels to cause inflammation and pain.Results: Neutrophil elastase cleaves PAR2, resulting in Gαs-mediated cAMP formation, transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) activation, and sensitization of nociceptive neurons, inflammation, and pain.Conclusion: Elastase causes PAR2- and TRPV4-mediated inflammation and pain.Significance: PARs and TRP channels mediate responses to diverse proteases.

Proteases such as thrombin and trypsin cleave at specific sites within the extracellular N terminus of PAR1, PAR2, and PAR4, which reveals tethered ligand domains that bind to and activate the cleaved receptors. When activated by this canonical mechanism, PAR1, PAR2, and PAR4 predominantly couple to Gαq and β-arrestins, leading to downstream signaling events that mediate hemostasis, inflammation, pain, and repair mechanisms (2.Vergnolle N.

PAR2 is an important mediator of protease-driven inflammation and pain. PAR2 is expressed by epithelial, endothelial, and smooth muscle cells in multiple tissues, as well as by cells of the immune system and the central and peripheral nervous systems (4.Nystedt S.

Proteases that activate PAR2 on nociceptive neurons can stimulate the release of substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide, which cause neurogenic inflammation in peripheral tissues and mediate pain transmission in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (5.Vergnolle N.

Trypsin-activated PAR2 also recruits G protein receptor kinase-2 (GRK2) and β-arrestins, which uncouple PAR2 from G proteins and mediate clathrin- and dynamin-dependent receptor endocytosis (15.DeFea K.A.

By recruiting PAR2 and Src to endosomal signalosomes, β-arrestins can mediate the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) within the cytosol (15.DeFea K.A. Zalevsky J.

Although pancreatic trypsins effectively activate PAR2, the identity of the proteases that activate PAR2 under patho-physiological conditions is uncertain. In particular, given the widespread distribution of PAR2 and the restricted expression of trypsin I/II to the pancreas, where activity is tightly controlled by endogenous inhibitors, the proteases that activate PAR2 in tissues other than the pancreas and intestine remain to be identified. Other proteases that can cleave PAR2 at Arg36↓Ser37 include trypsin IV (mesotrypsin) (17.Cottrell G.S. Amadesi S. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W.

These proteases would be expected to trigger the same canonical signaling events as trypsin I/II, leading to similar physiological outcomes. Alternatively, proteases that cleave PAR2 at different sites can either remove the trypsin-revealed tethered ligand domain and thereby prevent activation by the canonical mechanism (i.e. disarm the receptor), or can activate distinct signaling mechanisms (i.e. biased agonism). Such proteases include cathepsin S, which cleaves at Gly41↓Lys42 (30.Elmariah S.B. Reddy V.B. Lerner E.A.

However, the precise molecular mechanisms and the physiological consequences of biased protease signaling are poorly defined. We investigated the mechanisms and patho-physiological outcomes of neutrophil elastase-induced biased agonism of PAR2. Elastase is one of the major proteases released from infiltrating neutrophils in inflamed tissues. Given its high circulating concentration (up to 1 μm) and long half-life (6–8 h) during inflammation, elastase has been proposed as a target for anti-inflammatory therapy (33.Henriksen P.A. The potential of neutrophil elastase inhibitors as anti-inflammatory therapies.Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2014; 21: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Elastase is a biased agonist of both PAR1 and PAR2, but by distinctly different mechanisms. Elastase cleaves PAR1 at Leu45↓Arg46, distal to the thrombin cleavage site, which reveals a tethered ligand domain (RNPNDKYEPF-NH2) that activates Gαi/o-mediated ERK signaling (34.Mihara K. Ramachandran R. Renaux B. Saifeddine M. Hollenberg M.D. Neutrophil elastase and proteinase-3 trigger G protein-biased signaling through proteinase-activated receptor-1 (PAR1).J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 32979-32990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Elastase cleaves PAR2 at Ser67↓Val68, distal to the trypsin cleavage site, which activates PAR2 by a mechanism that does not involve exposure of a tethered ligand domain (32.Ramachandran R. Mihara K. Chung H. Renaux B. Lau C.S. Muruve D.A. DeFea K.A. Bouvier M. Hollenberg M.D. Neutrophil elastase acts as a biased agonist for proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR2).J. Biol.

Given the important proinflammatory and pro-nociceptive actions of elastase, PAR2, and TRP channels, we investigated whether the elastase-biased agonism of PAR2 activates TRPV4 and causes inflammation and pain. Our results reveal that elastase-activated PAR2 robustly couples to Gαs, leading to a PKA-dependent activation of TRPV4 and hypersensitivity of nociceptive neurons, and PAR2- and TRPV4-mediated inflammatory edema and mechanical hyperalgesia.

Peptides corresponding to N-terminal fragments of human PAR2 (100 μm) were incubated with elastase (10 units/ml (390 nm)) in Hanks' balanced salt solution, pH 7.4, for 1, 15, or 60 min at 37 °C. Reactions were quenched with an equal volume of 50% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O.

https://openalex.org/W2132714367,"High pressure experiments show that addition of a reduced sulfur-rich body to Earth during its accretion would provide enough energy to power the core’s geodynamo and, by fractionating neodymium relative to samarium, would explain the observed enrichment of Earth’s mantle in neodymium-142. Anke Wohlers and Bernard Wood use high-pressure experiments to show that the addition of a reduced Mercury-like body to the early Earth, rich in sulfur, could have generated both the superchondritic Sm/Nd ratio and 142Nd/144Nd isotopic anomaly observed in the Earth's mantle. This would mean that there was no requirement for either a 'hidden' silicate reservoir in the Earth's deep mantle or the loss of an early-formed terrestrial crust by impact ablation, as previously proposed. Additionally, the sulfur-rich core could hold more uranium and thorium, potentially providing a substantial part of the heat source to power the geodynamo. Recent 142Nd isotope data indicate that the silicate Earth (its crust plus the mantle) has a samarium to neodymium elemental ratio (Sm/Nd) that is greater than that of the supposed chondritic building blocks of the planet. This elevated Sm/Nd has been ascribed either to a ‘hidden’ reservoir in the Earth1,2 or to loss of an early-formed terrestrial crust by impact ablation3. Since removal of crust by ablation would also remove the heat-producing elements—potassium, uranium and thorium—such removal would make it extremely difficult to balance terrestrial heat production with the observed heat flow3. In the ‘hidden’ reservoir alternative, a complementary low-Sm/Nd layer is usually considered to reside unobserved in the silicate lower mantle. We have previously shown, however, that the core is a likely reservoir for some lithophile elements such as niobium4. We therefore address the question of whether core formation could have fractionated Nd from Sm and also acted as a sink for heat-producing elements. We show here that addition of a reduced Mercury-like body (or, alternatively, an enstatite-chondrite-like body) rich in sulfur to the early Earth would generate a superchondritic Sm/Nd in the mantle and an 142Nd/144Nd anomaly of approximately +14 parts per million relative to chondrite. In addition, the sulfur-rich core would partition uranium strongly and thorium slightly, supplying a substantial part of the ‘missing’ heat source for the geodynamo."

The mechanistic underpinnings of the autophagy defects are the subject of intense research, which is aided by genetic disease models. To gain an improved understanding of the pathways regulating defective autophagy specifically in juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (JNCL or Batten disease), a neurodegenerative disease of childhood, we developed and piloted a GFP-microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (GFP-LC3) screening assay to identify, in an unbiased fashion, genotype-sensitive small molecule autophagy modifiers, employing a JNCL neuronal cell model bearing the most common disease mutation in CLN3. Thapsigargin, a sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) Ca2+ pump inhibitor, reproducibly displayed significantly more activity in the mouse JNCL cells, an effect that was also observed in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived JNCL neural progenitor cells. The mechanism of thapsigargin sensitivity was Ca2+-mediated, and autophagosome accumulation in JNCL cells could be reversed by Ca2+ chelation. Interrogation of intracellular Ca2+ handling highlighted alterations in endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondrial, and lysosomal Ca2+ pools and in store-operated Ca2+ uptake in JNCL cells. These results further support an important role for the CLN3 protein in intracellular Ca2+ handling and in autophagic pathway flux and establish a powerful new platform for therapeutic screening.

The conventional view that faster increases in human life expectancy would lead to faster population aging is based on the assumption that people become old at a fixed chronological age. A preferable alternative is to base measures of aging on people’s time left to death, because this is more closely related to the characteristics that are associated with old age. Using this alternative interpretation, we show that faster increases in life expectancy would lead to slower population aging. Among other things, this finding affects the assessment of the speed at which countries will age."
https://openalex.org/W2095224133,"Senescence is a terminal growth arrest that functions as a tumor suppressor in aging and precancerous cells and is a response to selected anticancer compounds. Lysosomal-β-galactosidase (GLB1) hydrolyzes β-galactose from glycoconjugates and is the origin of senescence-associated β-gal activity (SA-β-gal). Using a new GLB1 antibody, senescence biology was investigated in prostate cancer (PCa) tissues.In vitro characterization of GLB1 was determined in primary prostate epithelial cell cultures passaged to replicative senescence and in therapy-induced senescence in PCa lines using chemotherapeutic agents. FFPE tissue microarrays were subjected to immunofluorescent staining for GLB1, Ki67 and HP1γ and automated quantitative imaging initially using AQUA in exploratory samples and Vectra in a validation series.GLB1 expression accumulates in replicative and induced senescence and correlates with senescent morphology and P16 (CDKN2) expression. In tissue arrays, quantitative imaging detects increased GLB1 expression in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN), known to contain senescent cells, and cancer compared to benign prostate tissues (p<0.01) and senescent cells contain low Ki67 and elevated HP1γ. Within primary tumors, elevated GLB1 associates with lower T stage (p=0.01), localized versus metastatic disease (p=0.0003) and improved PSA-free survival (p=0.03). Increased GLB1 stratifies better PSA-free survival in intermediate grade PCa (0.01). Tissues that elaborate higher GLB1 display increased uniformity of expression.Increased GLB1 is a valuable marker in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues for the senescence-like phenotype and associates with improved cancer outcomes. This protein addresses a lack of senescence markers and should be applicable to study the biologic role of senescence in other cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2048344270,"Staphylococcus aureus is an important pathogen that forms biofilms on the surfaces of medical implants. Biofilm formation by S. aureus is associated with the production of poly N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG), also referred to as polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA), which mediates bacterial adhesion, leading to the accumulation of bacteria on solid surfaces. This study shows that the ability of S. aureus SA113 to adhere to nasal epithelial cells is reduced after the deletion of the ica operon, which contains genes encoding PIA/PNAG synthesis. However, this ability is restored after a plasmid carrying the entire ica operon is transformed into the mutant strain, S. aureus SA113Δica, showing that the synthesis of PIA/PNAG is important for adhesion to epithelial cells. Additionally, S. carnosus TM300, which does not produce PIA/PNAG, forms a biofilm and adheres to epithelial cells after the bacteria are transformed with a PIA/PNAG-expressing plasmid, pTXicaADBC. The adhesion of S. carnosus TM300 to epithelial cells is also demonstrated by adding purified exopolysaccharide (EPS), which contains PIA/PNAG, to the bacteria. In addition, using a mouse model, we find that the abscess lesions and bacterial burden in lung tissues is higher in mice infected with S. aureus SA113 than in those infected with the mutant strain, S. aureus SA113Δica. The results indicate that PIA/PNAG promotes the adhesion of S. aureus to human nasal epithelial cells and lung infections in a mouse model. This study elucidates a mechanism that is important to the pathogenesis of S. aureus infections."
https://openalex.org/W2108723975,"Beekeeping activities, especially queen trading, have shaped the distribution of honey bee (Apis mellifera) subspecies in Europe, and have resulted in extensive introductions of two eastern European C-lineage subspecies (A. m. ligustica and A. m. carnica) into the native range of the M-lineage A. m. mellifera subspecies in Western Europe. As a consequence, replacement and gene flow between native and commercial populations have occurred at varying levels across western European populations. Genetic identification and introgression analysis using molecular markers is an important tool for management and conservation of honey bee subspecies. Previous studies have monitored introgression by using microsatellite, PCR-RFLP markers and most recently, high density assays using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. While the latter are almost prohibitively expensive, the information gained to date can be exploited to create a reduced panel containing the most ancestry-informative markers (AIMs) for those purposes with very little loss of information. The objective of this study was to design reduced panels of AIMs to verify the origin of A. m. mellifera individuals and to provide accurate estimates of the level of C-lineage introgression into their genome. The discriminant power of the SNPs using a variety of metrics and approaches including the Weir & Cockerham’s FST, an FST-based outlier test, Delta, informativeness (In), and PCA was evaluated. This study shows that reduced AIMs panels assign individuals to the correct origin and calculates the admixture level with a high degree of accuracy. These panels provide an essential tool in Europe for genetic stock identification and estimation of admixture levels which can assist management strategies and monitor honey bee conservation programs."
https://openalex.org/W2080376155,"Background Although the weaning classification based on the difficulty and duration of the weaning process has been evaluated in the different type of intensive care units (ICUs), little is known about clinical outcomes and validity among the three groups in medical ICU. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the clinical relevance of weaning classification and its association with hospital mortality in a medical ICU with a protocol-based weaning program. Methods All consecutive patients admitted to the medical ICU and requiring mechanical ventilation (MV) for more than 24 hours were prospectively registered and screened for weaning readiness by a standardized weaning program between July 2010 and June 2013. Baseline characteristics and outcomes were compared across weaning classifications. Results During the study period, a total of 680 patients were weaned according to the standardized weaning protocol. Of these, 457 (67%) were classified as simple weaning, 136 (20%) as difficult weaning, and 87 (13%) as prolonged weaning. Ventilator-free days within 28 days decreased significantly from simple to difficult to prolonged weaning groups (P < 0.001, test for trends). In addition, reintubation within 48 hours after extubation (P < 0.001) and need for tracheostomy during the weaning process (P < 0.001) increased significantly across weaning groups. Finally, ICU (P < 0.001), post-ICU (P = 0.001), and hospital (P < 0.001) mortalities significantly increased across weaning groups. In a multiple logistic regression model, prolonged weaning but not difficult weaning was still independently associated with ICU (adjusted OR 8.265, 95% CI 3.484–19.605, P < 0.001), and post-ICU (adjusted OR 3.180, 95% CI 1.349–7.497, P = 0.005), and hospital (adjusted OR 5.528, 95% CI 2.801–10.910, P < 0.001) mortalities. Conclusions Weaning classification based on the difficulty and duration of the weaning process may provide prognostic information for mechanically ventilated patients who undergo the weaning process."
https://openalex.org/W2003200648,"The angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) is a 7-transmembrane domain GPCR that when activated by its ligand angiotensin II, generates signaling events promoting vascular dysfunction and the development of cardiovascular disease. Here, we show that the single-transmembrane oxidized LDL (oxLDL) receptor (LOX-1) resides in proximity to AT1 on cell-surface membranes and that binding of oxLDL to LOX-1 can allosterically activate AT1-dependent signaling events. oxLDL-induced signaling events in human vascular endothelial cells were abolished by knockdown of AT1 and inhibited by AT1 blockade (ARB). oxLDL increased cytosolic G protein by 350% in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with genetically induced expression of AT1 and LOX-1, whereas little increase was observed in CHO cells expressing only LOX-1. Immunoprecipitation and in situ proximity ligation assay (PLA) assays in CHO cells revealed the presence of cell-surface complexes involving LOX-1 and AT1. Chimeric analysis showed that oxLDL-induced AT1 signaling events are mediated via interactions between the intracellular domain of LOX-1 and AT1 that activate AT1. oxLDL-induced impairment of endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation of vascular ring from mouse thoracic aorta was abolished by ARB or genetic deletion of AT1. These findings reveal a novel pathway for AT1 activation and suggest a new mechanism whereby oxLDL may be promoting risk for cardiovascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W2074336414,"The objective of the present study was to formulate a simple and at the same time effective mathematical model of heart rate kinetics in response to movement (exercise). Based on an existing model, a system of two coupled differential equations which give the rate of change of heart rate and the rate of change of exercise intensity is used. The modifications introduced to the existing model are justified and discussed in detail, while models of blood lactate accumulation in respect to time and exercise intensity are also presented. The main modification is that the proposed model has now only one parameter which reflects the overall cardiovascular condition of the individual. The time elapsed after the beginning of the exercise, the intensity of the exercise, as well as blood lactate are also taken into account. Application of the model provides information regarding the individual’s cardiovascular condition and is able to detect possible changes in it, across the data recording periods. To demonstrate examples of successful numerical fit of the model, constant intensity experimental heart rate data sets of two individuals have been selected and numerical optimization was implemented. In addition, numerical simulations provided predictions for various exercise intensities and various cardiovascular condition levels. The proposed model can serve as a powerful tool for a complete means of heart rate analysis, not only in exercise physiology (for efficiently designing training sessions for healthy subjects) but also in the areas of cardiovascular health and rehabilitation (including application in population groups for which direct heart rate recordings at intense exercises are not possible or not allowed, such as elderly or pregnant women)."

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether simulated microgravity influences the intestinal homeostasis and increases the susceptibility to colon inflammation. The hindlimb unloading (HU) mouse model was used to simulate the microgravity condition. Three percent dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) was given to mice to induce colitis. Compared to ground control (Ctrl) mice, the HU ones revealed an impaired intestinal homeostasis and increased susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis. This includes an early-onset, 4-fold expansion of segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), more than 2-fold decrease in regulatory T (Treg) cell numbers and IL-10 production, ∼2-fold increase in colonic IL-1β expression, 2-fold increase in circulating neutrophils, and colonic neutrophil infiltration. The application of antibiotics ameliorated the Treg and IL-10 reductions but did not significantly dampen neutrophilia and elevated expression of colonic IL-1β. These results indicate that the intestinal microflora and innate immune system both respond to simulated microgravity and together, contribute to the proinflammatory shift in the gut microenvironment. The data also emphasize the necessity for evaluating the susceptibility to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) in distant space travels."

Fish were exposed to sublethal concentrations of TBT (75 ng/L, 0.75 μg/L and 7.5 μg/L) for 15, 30, and 60 days. Based on the results, a low level and short-term TBT-induced stress could not induce the notable responses of the fish brain, but long-term exposure (more than 15 days) to TBT could lead to obvious physiological-biochemical responses (based on the measured parameters). The results also strongly indicated that neurotoxicity of TBT to fish. Thus, the measured physiological responses in fish brain could provide useful information to better understand the mechanisms of TBT-induced bio-toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2037135629,"Antibiotic resistance is concern of today's world. Search for alternative molecules, for treatment and immune stimulation, remains at the forefront. One such group of biomolecules with promise, along the line of immune stimulation or therapy, is host defense peptide (HDP). These molecules, however, are required at a higher dose to be effective which leads to high cost. To alleviate such problems, an aid can be used to achieve similar efficacy but at a smaller effective dose of the immune stimulant. We hypothesised that by conjugating HDPs with carbon nanotubes and/or gold nanoparticles, it would be possible to stimulate a protective immune response in host system at a lower dosage of HDP. In this report, we characterized, using biophysical methodologies, conjugation of Indolicidin, as a representative of HDP. We further established efficacy of peptide-nanomaterial conjugates in activating innate immunity and protecting against pathogen infection in vitro at a significantly small dose."
https://openalex.org/W2083522030,"A multiple linear model was developed for individual tree crown width of Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook in Fujian province, southeast China. Data were obtained from 55 sample plots of pure China-fir plantation stands. An Ordinary Linear Least Squares (OLS) regression was used to establish the crown width model. To adjust for correlations between observations from the same sample plots, we developed one level linear mixed-effects (LME) models based on the multiple linear model, which take into account the random effects of plots. The best random effects combinations for the LME models were determined by the Akaike’s information criterion, the Bayesian information criterion and the -2logarithm likelihood. Heteroscedasticity was reduced by three residual variance functions: the power function, the exponential function and the constant plus power function. The spatial correlation was modeled by three correlation structures: the first-order autoregressive structure [AR(1)], a combination of first-order autoregressive and moving average structures [ARMA(1,1)], and the compound symmetry structure (CS). Then, the LME model was compared to the multiple linear model using the absolute mean residual (AMR), the root mean square error (RMSE), and the adjusted coefficient of determination (adj-R2). For individual tree crown width models, the one level LME model showed the best performance. An independent dataset was used to test the performance of the models and to demonstrate the advantage of calibrating LME models."

https://openalex.org/W1998190885,"The potential of fallen stock data to monitor the health status of animal populations has been noted in previous studies. However, further research is required to implement these systems for surveillance. This work presents a novel approach to determining the baselines associated with bovine fallen stock, comparing patterns between subpopulations and identifying subpopulations in which an abnormal event may occur. This study was based on data from 193,873 disposal visits carried out between 2004 and 2012 across a total of 2,991 bovine farms. Proxy measurements such as the number of collections carried out and the weight of carcasses collected were used. Both outcomes were aggregated weekly at different geographical scales for three production types (beef cattle, dairy cattle and heifer fattening). The analysis of these data combined autoregressive integrated moving average modelling and hierarchical time series methods.The three production types exhibited historical baselines that differed notably from one another. Based on the 757 beef cattle farms monitored, the mean number of collections registered per week at the regional level was 37 (range: 10–83). This series was relatively constant over time and showed a marked yearly seasonality. In contrast, for the 426 dairy cattle farms the mean number of disposal visits registered weekly was 121 (range: 71–180), showing half-yearly and yearly seasonality and a marked increase over the period monitored. From the 1,808 heifer fattening farms the mean number of disposal visits was 248 (range: 166–357) and the pattern presented a marked alternating trend over time. These patterns were assessed and compared at regional, provincial, county and municipal levels. The use of hierarchical time series approaches appeared to be a useful tool for comparing the patterns within different subpopulations over time as well as for assessing the spatial extent to which various abnormal events could be detected."

Assembly of Elongin A into the ubiquitin ligase is strongly induced by genotoxic stress; by transcriptional stresses that lead to accumulation of stalled Pol II; and by other stimuli, including endoplasmic reticulum and nutrient stress and retinoic acid signaling, that activate Elongin A-dependent transcription. Taken together, our findings shed new light on mechanisms that control the Elongin A ubiquitin ligase and suggest that it may play a role in Elongin A-dependent transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2069708185,"Land-use change has a crucial influence on soil respiration, which further affects soil nutrient availability and carbon stock. We monitored soil respiration rates under different land-use types (tea gardens with three production levels, adjacent woodland, and a vegetable field) in Eastern China at weekly intervals over a year using the dynamic closed chamber method. The relationship between soil respiration and environmental factors was also evaluated. The soil respiration rate exhibited a remarkable single peak that was highest in July/August and lowest in January. The annual cumulative respiration flux increased by 25.6% and 20.9% in the tea garden with high production (HP) and the vegetable field (VF), respectively, relative to woodland (WL). However, no significant differences were observed between tea gardens with medium production (MP), low production (LP), WL, and VF. Soil respiration rates were significantly and positively correlated with organic carbon, total nitrogen, and available phosphorous content. Each site displayed a significant exponential relationship between soil respiration and soil temperature measured at 5 cm depth, which explained 84–98% of the variation in soil respiration. The model with a combination of soil temperature and moisture was better at predicting the temporal variation of soil respiration rate than the single temperature model for all sites. Q10 was 2.40, 2.00, and 1.86–1.98 for VF, WL, and tea gardens, respectively, indicating that converting WL to VF increased and converting to tea gardens decreased the sensitivity of soil respiration to temperature. The equation of the multiple linear regression showed that identical factors, including soil organic carbon (SOC), soil water content (SWC), pH, and water soluble aluminum (WSAl), drove the changes in soil respiration and Q10 after conversion of land use. Temporal variations of soil respiration were mainly controlled by soil temperature, whereas spatial variations were influenced by SOC, SWC, pH, and WSAl."
https://openalex.org/W2076624979,"Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare premature aging disorder that is most commonly caused by a de novo point mutation in exon 11 of the LMNA gene, c.1824C>T, which results in an increased production of a truncated form of lamin A known as progerin. In this study, we used a mouse model to study the possibility of recovering from HGPS bone disease upon silencing of the HGPS mutation, and the potential benefits from treatment with resveratrol. We show that complete silencing of the transgenic expression of progerin normalized bone morphology and mineralization already after 7 weeks. The improvements included lower frequencies of rib fractures and callus formation, an increased number of osteocytes in remodeled bone, and normalized dentinogenesis. The beneficial effects from resveratrol treatment were less significant and to a large extent similar to mice treated with sucrose alone. However, the reversal of the dental phenotype of overgrown and laterally displaced lower incisors in HGPS mice could be attributed to resveratrol. Our results indicate that the HGPS bone defects were reversible upon suppressed transgenic expression and suggest that treatments targeting aberrant progerin splicing give hope to patients who are affected by HGPS."
https://openalex.org/W2054717667,"Background Increasing evidence points to a role for the extra-neuronal nerve growth factor (NGF) in acquired immune responses. However, very little information is available about its role and underlying mechanism in innate immunity. The role of innate immunity in autoimmune diseases is becoming increasingly important. In this study, we explored the contribution of pleiotropic NGF in the innate immune response along with its underlying molecular mechanism with respect to IL-1β secretion. Methods Human monocytes, null and NLRP3 deficient THP-1 cell lines were used for this purpose. We determined the effect of NGF on secretion of IL-1β at the protein and mRNA levels. To determine the underlying molecular mechanism, the effect of NGF on NLRP1/NLRP3 inflammasomes and its downstream key protein, activated caspase-1, were evaluated by ELISA, immunoflorescence, flow cytometry, and real-time PCR. Results In human monocytes and null THP-1 cell line, NGF significantly upregulates IL-1β at protein and mRNA levels in a caspase-1 dependent manner through its receptor, TrkA. Furthermore, we observed that NGF induces caspase-1 activation through NLRP1/NLRP3 inflammasomes, and it is dependent on the master transcription factor, NF-κB. Conclusions To best of our knowledge, this is the first report shedding light on the mechanistic aspect of a neuroregulatory molecule, NGF, in innate immune response, and thus enriches our understanding regarding its pathogenic role in inflammation. These observations add further evidence in favor of anti-NGF therapy in autoimmune diseases and also unlock a new area of research about the role of NGF in IL-1β mediated diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2134894485,"Aims The association between recent and more distant weight changes before and after the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes has been little researched. The aim of this study is to determine the influence of patients’ weight history before diabetes diagnosis on the observed 6-year weight changes after diagnosis. Methods A clinical cohort study combined with self-reported past weight history. In total 885 patients aged ≥40 years and newly diagnosed with clinical type 2 diabetes were included. Body weight was measured immediately after diabetes diagnosis and again at the 6-year follow up examination (median, 5.7 years). At diagnosis patients reported their weight 1 year and 10 years previously, and also at the age of 20. Multivariate linear regression analyses controlled for 20 baseline patient characteristics. Results The median (interquartile range) age at diagnosis was 63.2 (53.9; 71.4) years. Median body weight was 80.0 (72.0; 90.0) kg 10 years before diagnosis, 85.0 (75.0; 95.0) kg 1 year before diagnosis, 82.4 (72.0; 94.0) kg at diagnosis, and 80.0 (70.0; 91.1) kg at 6-year follow up. Each kg of weight gain during the year preceding the diagnosis was associated with a weight change (95% CI) of -0.20 (-0.28; -0.13) kg during the follow up period. In all models age and body mass index at diagnosis predicted future weight changes, while the weight at age 20 (-0.01 (-0.06; 0.03) kg/kg), and the weight change from 10 years to 1 year before diagnosis (-0.01 (-0.06; 0.04) kg/kg), did not predict weight change after diagnosis. Conclusions During the first on average 5.7 years after diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, patients generally follow a course of declining average weight, and these weight developments are related primarily to recent weight changes, body mass index, and age, but not to the more distant weight history."
https://openalex.org/W1966110938,"The heparan sulfate proteoglycan 2 (HSPG2)/perlecan gene is ancient and conserved in all triploblastic species. Its presence maintains critical cell boundaries in tissue and its large (up to ~900 kDa) modular structure has prompted speculation about the evolutionary origin of the gene. The gene's conservation amongst basal metazoans is unclear. After the recent sequencing of their genomes, the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis and the placozoan Trichoplax adhaerens have become favorite models for studying tissue regeneration and the evolution of multicellularity. More ancient basal metazoan phyla include the poriferan and ctenophore, whose evolutionary relationship has been clarified recently. Our in silico and PCR-based methods indicate that the HSPG2 gene is conserved in both the placozoan and cnidarian genomes, but not in those of the ctenophores and only partly in poriferan genomes. HSPG2 also is absent from published ctenophore and Capsaspora owczarzaki genomes. The gene in T. adhaerens is encoded as two separate but genetically juxtaposed genes that house all of the constituent pieces of the mammalian HSPG2 gene in tandem. These genetic constituents are found in isolated genes of various poriferan species, indicating a possible intronic recombinatory mechanism for assembly of the HSPG2 gene. Perlecan's expression during wound healing and boundary formation is conserved, as expression of the gene was activated during tissue regeneration and reformation of the basement membrane of N. vectensis. These data indicate that the complex HSPG2 gene evolved concurrently in a common ancestor of placozoans, cnidarians and bilaterians, likely along with the development of differentiated cell types separated by acellular matrices, and is activated to reestablish these tissue borders during wound healing."

The current cross-sectional study presents the 15 most significant personal and contextual factors that collectively explain 66.4% (two-thirds) of the variability in 12-year old students’ perceptions of belongingness in primary school. The study is part of a larger longitudinal study investigating the factors associated with student adjustment in the transition from primary to secondary school. The study found that girls and students with disabilities had higher school belongingness scores than boys, and their typically developing counterparts respectively; and explained 2.5% of the variability in school belongingness. The majority (47.1% out of 66.4%) of the variability in school belongingness was explained by student personal factors, such as social acceptance, physical appearance competence, coping skills, and social affiliation motivation; followed by parental expectations (3% out of 66.4%), and school-based factors (13.9% out of 66.4%) such as, classroom involvement, task-goal structure, autonomy provision, cultural pluralism, and absence of bullying. Each of the identified contributors of primary school belongingness can be shaped through interventions, system changes, or policy reforms."
https://openalex.org/W2054242878,"Protease-activated receptor 4 (PAR4), a member of G-protein coupled receptors family, was recently reported to exhibit decreased expression in gastric cancer and esophageal squamous cancer, yet increased expression during the progression of prostate cancer. Trefoil factor 2 (TFF2), a small peptide constitutively expressed in the gastric mucosa, plays a protective role in restitution of gastric mucosa. Altered TFF2 expression was also related to the development of gastrointestinal cancer. TFF2 has been verified to promote cell migration via PAR4, but the roles of PAR4 and TFF2 in the progress of colorectal cancer are still unknown. In this study, the expression level of PAR4 and TFF2 in colorectal cancer tissues was measured using real-time PCR (n = 38), western blotting (n=38) and tissue microarrays (n = 66). The mRNA and protein expression levels of PAR4 and TFF2 were remarkably increased in colorectal cancer compared with matched noncancerous tissues, especially in positive lymph node and poorly differentiated cancers. The colorectal carcinoma cell LoVo showed an increased response to TFF2 as assessed by cell invasion upon PAR4 expression. However, after intervention of PAR4 expression, PAR4 positive colorectal carcinoma cell HT-29 was less responsive to TFF2 in cell invasion. Genomic bisulfite sequencing showed the hypomethylation of PAR4 promoter in colorectal cancer tissues and the hypermethylation in the normal mucosa that suggested the low methylation of promoter was correlated to the increased PAR4 expression. Taken together, the results demonstrated that the up-regulated expression of PAR4 and TFF2 frequently occurs in colorectal cancer tissues, and that overexpression of PAR4 may be resulted from promoter hypomethylation. While TFF2 promotes invasion activity of LoVo cells overexpressing PAR4, and this effect was significantly decreased when PAR4 was knockdowned in HT-29 cells. Our findings will be helpful in further investigations into the functions and molecular mechanisms of Proteinase-activated receptors (PARs) and Trefoil factor factors (TFFs) during the progression of colorectal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1988294931,"Differential serological diagnosis of Chagas disease and leishmaniasis is difficult owing to cross-reactivity resulting from the fact that the parasites that cause these pathologies share antigenic epitopes. Even with optimized serological assays that use parasite-specific recombinant antigens, inconclusive test results continue to be a problem. Therefore, new serological tests with high sensitivity and specificity are needed. In the present work, we developed and evaluated the performance of a new flow cytometric serological method, referred to as FC-TRIPLEX Chagas/Leish IgG1, for the all-in-one classification of inconclusive tests. The method uses antigens for the detection of visceral leishmaniasis, localized cutaneous leishmaniasis, and Chagas disease and is based on an inverted detuned algorithm for analysis of anti-Trypanosomatidae IgG1 reactivity. First, parasites were label with fluorescein isothiocyanate or Alexa Fluor 647 at various concentrations. Then serum samples were serially diluted, the dilutions were incubated with suspensions of mixed labeled parasites, and flow cytometric measurements were performed to determine percentages of positive fluorescent parasites. Using the new method, we obtained correct results for 76 of 80 analyzed serum samples (95% overall performance), underscoring the outstanding performance of the method. Moreover, we found that the fluorescently labeled parasite suspensions were stable during storage at room temperature, 4°C, and –20°C for 1 year. In addition, two different lots of parasite suspensions showed equivalent antigen recognition; that is, the two lots showed equivalent categorical segregation of anti-Trypanosomatidae IgG1 reactivity at selected serum dilutions. In conclusion, we have developed a sensitive and selective method for differential diagnosis of Chagas disease, visceral leishmaniasis, and localized cutaneous leishmaniasis."

In neurosurgery, intraoperatively differentiating non-operative lesions such as CNS B-cell lymphoma from operative lesions can be challenging, often necessitating immunohistochemical (IHC) procedures which require up to 24-48 hours. Here, we evaluate the feasibility of generating rapid ex vivo specific labeling using a novel lymphoma-specific fluorescent switchable aptamer. Our B-cell lymphoma-specific switchable aptamer produced only low-level fluorescence in its unbound conformation and generated an 8-fold increase in fluorescence once bound to its target on CD20-positive lymphoma cells. The aptamer demonstrated strong binding to B-cell lymphoma cells within 15 minutes of incubation as observed by flow cytometry. We applied the switchable aptamer to ex vivo xenograft tissue harboring B-cell lymphoma and astrocytoma, and within one hour specific visual identification of lymphoma was routinely possible. In this proof-of-concept study in human cell culture and orthotopic xenografts, we conclude that a fluorescent switchable aptamer can provide rapid and specific labeling of B-cell lymphoma, and that developing aptamer-based labeling approaches could simplify tissue staining and drastically reduce time to histopathological diagnoses compared with IHC-based methods. We propose that switchable aptamers could enhance expeditious, accurate intraoperative decision-making."

In total, 90 compounds, including five new iridoids and one new sesquiterpene, were identified or tentatively characterized by accurate mass measurements within 5 ppm error. This analysis was accompanied by MS fragmentation and reference standard comparison analyses. Furthermore, the herbal sources of these compounds were unambiguously confirmed by comparing the extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) of RDN and ingredient herbal extracts. Our work provides a certain foundation for further studies of RDN.

We first designed the Specific Aerobic Gymnast Anaerobic Test (SAGAT), which included gymnastics-specific elements performed in maximal repeated sprint fashion, with a total duration of 80-90 s. In order to validate the SAGAT, three independent sub-studies were performed to evaluate the concurrent validity (Study I, n=8), the reliability (Study II, n=10) and the sensitivity (Study III, n=30) of the test in elite female athletes. In Study I, a positive correlation was shown between lower-body Wingate test and SAGAT performance (Mean power: p = 0.03, r = -0.69, CI: -0.94 to 0.03 and Peak power: p = 0.02, r = -0.72, CI: -0.95 to -0.04) and between upper-body Wingate test and SAGAT performance (Mean power: p = 0.03, r = -0.67, CI: -0.94 to 0.02 and Peak power: p = 0.03, r = -0.69, CI: -0.94 to 0.03). Additionally, plasma lactate was similarly increased in response to SAGAT (p = 0.002), lower-body Wingate Test (p = 0.021) and a simulated competition (p = 0.007). In Study II, no differences were found between the time to complete the SAGAT in repeated trials (p = 0.84; Cohen’s d effect size = 0.09; ICC = 0.97, CI: 0.89 to 0.99; MDC95 = 0.12 s). Finally, in Study III the time to complete the SAGAT was significantly lower during the competition cycle when compared to the period before the preparatory cycle (p < 0.001), showing an improvement in SAGAT performance after a specific Aerobic Gymnastics training period. Taken together, these data have demonstrated that SAGAT is a specific, reliable and sensitive measurement of specific anaerobic performance in elite female Aerobic Gymnastics, presenting great potential to be largely applied in training settings."
https://openalex.org/W2086030246,"The poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARsylation) activity of tankyrase (TNKS) regulates diverse physiological processes including energy metabolism and wnt/β-catenin signaling. This TNKS activity uses NAD+ as a co-substrate to post-translationally modify various acceptor proteins including TNKS itself. PARsylation by TNKS often tags the acceptors for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Whether this TNKS activity is regulated by physiological changes in NAD+ levels or, more broadly, in cellular energy charge has not been investigated. Because the NAD+ biosynthetic enzyme nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) in vitro is robustly potentiated by ATP, we hypothesized that nutritional energy might stimulate cellular NAMPT to produce NAD+ and thereby augment TNKS catalysis. Using insulin-secreting cells as a model, we showed that glucose indeed stimulates the autoPARsylation of TNKS and consequently its turnover by the ubiquitin-proteasomal system. This glucose effect on TNKS is mediated primarily by NAD+ since it is mirrored by the NAD+ precursor nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), and is blunted by the NAMPT inhibitor FK866. The TNKS-destabilizing effect of glucose is shared by other metabolic fuels including pyruvate and amino acids. NAD+ flux analysis showed that glucose and nutrients, by increasing ATP, stimulate NAMPT-mediated NAD+ production to expand NAD+ stores. Collectively our data uncover a metabolic pathway whereby nutritional energy augments NAD+ production to drive the PARsylating activity of TNKS, leading to autoPARsylation-dependent degradation of the TNKS protein. The modulation of TNKS catalytic activity and protein abundance by cellular energy charge could potentially impose a nutritional control on the many processes that TNKS regulates through PARsylation. More broadly, the stimulation of NAD+ production by ATP suggests that nutritional energy may enhance the functions of other NAD+-driven enzymes including sirtuins."

The Cox-proportional hazard model was used to estimate the effects of waist circumference and other risk factors, including age, smoking and alcohol consumption status, of males and females on prediction of type 2 diabetes, identified through subsequent hospitalisation data during the follow-up period. The Weibull regression model was used to calculate the absolute risk estimates of type 2 diabetes with waist circumference and age as predictors.Of 803 participants, 110 were recorded as having developed type 2 diabetes, in subsequent hospitalizations over a follow-up of 12633.4 person-years. Waist circumference was strongly associated with subsequent diagnosis of type 2 diabetes with P<0.0001 for both genders and remained statistically significant after adjusting for confounding factors. Hazard ratios of type 2 diabetes associated with 1 standard deviation increase in waist circumference were 1.7 (95%CI 1.3 to 2.2) for males and 2.1 (95%CI 1.7 to 2.6) for females. At 45 years of age with baseline waist circumference of 100 cm, a male had an absolute diabetic risk of 10.9%, while a female had a 14.3% risk of the disease.The constructed model predicts the 10-year absolute diabetes risk in an Aboriginal Australian community. It is simple and easily understood and will help identify individuals at risk of diabetes in relation to waist circumference values. Our findings on the relationship between waist circumference and diabetes on gender will be useful for clinical consultation, public health education and establishing WC cut-off points for Aboriginal Australians."

We performed a hybridization experiment, measuring a set of 14 traditional (linear) and landmark-based shell morphological variables on even-aged parents and their offspring from both hybrids and purebred control lines. Parent-offspring regression yielded a strikingly high heritability estimate for score on the first relative warp axis, h2 = 0.819 ± 0.073, a result that would seem to confirm the value of geometric morphometrics as a tool for retrieving evolutionary relationships from gastropod shell form. Score on the second relative warp axis was also significantly heritable (h2 = 0.312 ± 0.123), although more moderate, as were scores on second principal components extracted from traditional measurements (correlation h2 = 0.308 ± 0.069, covariance h2 = 0.314 ± 0.050). Although score on the first relative warp axis was significantly correlated with centroid size (p < 0.001), scores on none of the three second axes were so correlated. This result suggests that second axis score might prove especially useful for estimating genetic divergence among mixed-age populations of gastropods sampled from the field."

Biochem. 2006; 75: 681-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar and 2.Niida H. Shimada M. Murakami H. Nakanishi M. Mechanisms of dNTP supply that play an essential role in maintaining genome integrity in eukaryotic cells.Cancer Sci. 2010; 101: 2505-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In mammals, RnRs consist of two distinct complexes formed by the association of a unique catalytic dimeric protein called R1 with one of the two homologues R2 and p53R2. These accessory subunits bring a stable free radical centered on a tyrosyl residue and are necessary for catalysis (1.Nordlund P. Reichard P. Ribonucleotide reductases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 681-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Levels of protein R1 remain stable throughout the cell cycle as a consequence of both a transcriptional induction of the RRM1 gene encoding R1 at the G1/S boundary and a long half-life of the protein. By contrast, R2 is a cell cycle-regulated protein. Transcriptional regulation of the RRM2 gene encoding R2 is similar to that of RRM1, but maximal expression of the protein is limited to the S phase by proteasomal degradation of the subunit in G2 and M/G1 phases mediated, respectively, by Skp1-Cullin-Fbox (cyclin F) and anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (Cdh1) ubiquitin ligases (1.Nordlund P.

Fluctuations in protein R2 levels limit the activity of the R1-R2 complex and coordinate enhanced dNTP production with DNA replication. The p53R2 protein is expressed at a low constant level in cycling and quiescent cells (5.Pontarin G. Ferraro P. Håkansson P. Thelander L. Reichard P. Bianchi V. p53R2-dependent ribonucleotide reduction provides deoxyribonucleotides in quiescent human fibroblasts in the absence of induced DNA damage.J. Biol.

It is essential for mitochondrial DNA replication in some human and mouse tissues, especially skeletal muscle (6.Bourdon A. Minai L. Serre V. Jais J.P. Sarzi E. Aubert S. Chrétien D. de Lonlay P.

DNA damage induces a transcriptional up-regulation of p53R2 in a p53-dependent manner, and p53R2 participates in repair of DNA lesions requiring a dNTP supply at least in postmitotic cells (7.Pontarin G.

Several lines of evidence also indicate a participation of protein R2 in DNA repair processes (2.Niida H. Shimada M. Murakami H. Nakanishi M.

According to the current view, beyond a certain threshold of DNA lesions that overwhelm the repair mechanisms, damaged cells are eliminated by p53-dependent or -independent apoptotic cell death (10.Nowsheen S. Yang E.S. The intersection between DNA damage response and cell death pathways.Exp. Oncol. 2012; 34: 243-254PubMed Google Scholar). Apoptosis requires a family of aspartate-directed cysteine proteases termed caspases, which are classified as initiator (2, 8, 9, and 10) or effector (3, 6, and 7) caspases according to the timing of their proteolytic activation during the apoptosis signaling cascade (11.Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Mammalian caspases: structure, activation, substrates, and functions during apoptosis.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2448) Google Scholar). Specific cleavage of numerous polypeptide substrates, including structural components of the cytoskeleton, nucleus, and chromatin architecture; key players in signaling transduction pathways; cell cycle regulators; and DNA-binding proteins, ultimately leads to characteristic morphological changes, chromatin condensation, and nucleus fragmentation. Several proteins active during DNA repair or DNA replication are caspase substrates destroyed in the course of apoptosis, including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), the catalytic fragment of the DNA-dependent protein kinase, DNA topoisomerase II, and DNA replication protein RF-C140 (11.Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Mammalian caspases: structure, activation, substrates, and functions during apoptosis.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2448) Google Scholar). RnR supplies dNTPs for DNA synthesis and repair, but the fate of the enzyme subunits during apoptosis is currently unknown. We provide here the first evidence for a caspase-dependent degradation of human R2 and p53R2 small subunits. By contrast, R1, which is a long lived protein present in resting and proliferating cells like p53R2, is not subjected to proteolysis during apoptosis. Cycloheximide, propidium iodide, protease-free BSA, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, dNs, and cisplatin (cis-diammineplatinum(II) dichloride) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. E-64d ((2S,3S)-trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-3-methylbutane ethyl ester), z-Val-Ala-dl-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (z-VAD-fmk), Ac-VDVAD-CHO, Ac-IETD-CHO, Ac-DEVD-CHO and Ac-YVAD-CHO were purchased from Enzo Life Science. Imatinib and nilotinib were gifts from Novartis (Basel, Switzerland). Recombinant caspases and Q-VD-OPh were obtained from R&D Systems; TNF-α was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific; and lactacystin, Pefabloc, and N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO were obtained from Merck Millipore. MG-132 was from Selleckchem. Primary antibodies against α-tubulin (T9026, Sigma-Aldrich), p53R2 (ab8105, Abcam), R1 (AD203, InRo BioMedTek), R2 (I-15 and E-16, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), PARP-1 (C-2-10, Merck Millipore), a V5 epitope (R960-25, Life Technologies), and caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-3 (9665 and 9661, respectively, Cell Signaling Technology) were used for immunoblotting. Fluorescent Alexa Fluor 680-conjugated anti-mouse (A-21057, Life Technologies) and IRDye 800CW-conjugated anti-rabbit (926-32211, Li-Cor Biosciences) IgGs were used for infrared fluorescence detection of primary antibodies in immunoblotting. The human leukemia and lung carcinoma cell lines K-562 and H1299 were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 25 mm HEPES, and antibiotics. The human adenocarcinoma HeLa 229 cell line and the human mammary MCF-7 cell lines obtained by stable transfection of caspase-3 cDNA (MCF-7c3) or empty vector (MCF-7vc) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. For experiments, K-562, HeLa 229, H1299, and MCF-7 cells were seeded in 6-well culture plates at 0.75, 0.6, 0.3, and 0.7 × 106 cells/well, respectively, in 5 ml of culture medium. The day after, imatinib (0.06–4 μm) or nilotinib (1.9–125 nm) was added to K-562 cells. HeLa 229 and H1299 cells received a combination of TNF-α (10 ng/ml) and cycloheximide (CHX) (10 μg/ml). MCF-7 cells were treated with 25 μg/ml cisplatin. Cells were harvested from 16 to 48 h later for further analysis. HeLa 229 cells at 25–30% confluence were maintained for 18 h in culture medium supplemented with 2 mm thymidine. Then thymidine was removed by washing cells once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Fresh medium was added for 9 h before starting a second thymidine treatment for 17 h. Cells arrested at the beginning of S phase and maintained in the presence of 2 mm thymidine were incubated with TNF-α and CHX if required. Synchronized HeLa 229 cells kept in the presence of 2 mm thymidine were treated with TNF-α and CHX for 19 h. Then cells were incubated in fresh culture medium supplemented with thymidine, CHX (10 μg/ml), and Q-VD-OPh (2 μm). Cells were harvested after 0–24 h, and expression of proteins R2 and R1 was determined by immunoblotting. Kinetics of protein decay was fitted with a first-order exponential equation (A = A0e−kt), and protein half-life was calculated (t½ = ln 2/k). Cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS. Crude cell extracts were prepared in a 50 mm Tris·HCl lysis buffer, pH 7.4 supplemented with 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors including 1 mm Pefabloc. SDS-PAGE, protein transfer on a nitrocellulose membrane, and antigen detection were carried out as described previously using α-tubulin as a loading standard (12.Tebbi A. Guittet O. Cottet M.H. Vesin M.F. Lepoivre M. TAp73 induction by nitric oxide: regulation by checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) and protection against apoptosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 7873-7884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The infrared fluorescence signals at 680 and 800 nm were recorded and quantified with an Odyssey scanner (LI-COR Biosciences) and normalized to α-tubulin. The extent of p53R2 protein cleavage was analyzed by measuring the fluorescence signal of the cleaved fragment. It was expressed as the percentage of the total amount of the protein. Cells were incubated for 16 h with TNF-α and CHX. In some experiments, nucleosides were added with the proapoptotic agents. Cells were then harvested in PBS, resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold PBS, and fixed in 3 ml of 75% EtOH kept at −20 °C. An aliquot was transferred on a microscopy slide. Nuclei were stained with DAPI contained in the mounting medium ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Life Technologies). At least 200 nuclei were recorded with a Zeiss Axioplan2 fluorescence microscope, and the percentage of nuclei exhibiting morphological apoptotic features (i.e. chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation) was then calculated. HeLa 229 cells incubated with TNF-α and CHX were processed for terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated fluorescent labeling of 3′-OH ends of fragmented DNA using the Click-iT TUNEL Alexa Fluor Imaging assay (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The kit was adapted to a sample of 1 × 106 cells in suspension. Cells were gently resuspended every 10 min during labeling reactions, and washings were done using centrifugation. Analysis of Alexa Fluor 488-labeled cells was performed with a CyFlow ML flow cytometry system using Summit 6.1 software. All DNA manipulations, mutation, cloning, and transformation experiments in Escherichia coli DH5α were performed according to standard protocols. The pcDNA3.1 vector carrying the cDNA sequence of the human p53R2 gene (pcDNA3-hp53R2) was a generous gift from Prof. Hirofumi Tanaka (Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan). The pcDNA3-hp53R2mut plasmid encoding p53R2-D342E was generated by PCR from pcDNA3-hp53R2 using the Phusion Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Thermo Scientific) and the following primers: 5′-CCAAGGTGAAGACGTTTTCTGTGGTTTCTGCCATAACTGCA-3′ and 5′-GGCAGAAACCACAGAAAACGTCTTCACCTTGGATGCAGATT-3′ (mutated nucleotide underlined). All steps were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The presence of the A to T point mutation in the p53R2 sequence was confirmed by sequencing. The pcDNA3-p53R2-ΔC9 plasmid was created by PCR amplification from the pcDNA3-hp53R2 plasmid using the following primers: 5′-TGGAATTCCAGACCGGCTAGCATGGGCGACCCGGGA-3′ and 5′-CTCGAGTTAATCTGTGGTTTCTGCCATAACTGC-3′. The PCR fragment digested with NheI and XhoI was ligated into the pcDNA3.1 expression vector opened with the same enzymes. Bacterial expression vectors expressing N-terminally His6-tagged wild-type, D342E, and p53R2-ΔC9 proteins were constructed as follows. A DNA fragment containing the sequence of the WT human p53R2 gene was amplified by PCR from the pcDNA3-hp53R2 plasmid using the primers 5′-GTGGTGGAATTCCAGACCGGCTAGCATGGGCGACCCGGAA-3′ and 5′-AAGCCACAGTGGAGGCTGATCA-3′. The fragment was then cleaved by NheI and XhoI and inserted in the pET28b vector opened by the same enzymes. NheI and XhoI were used to release p53R2-D342E and p53R2-ΔC9 fragments from pcDNA3-p53R2mut and pcDNA-p53R2-ΔC9, respectively. These sequences were then ligated into the pET28b vector opened by the same enzymes to create pET28b-p53R2-D342E and pET28b-p53R2-ΔC9. The pET28b-R1His plasmid expressing a N-terminally His6-tagged human R1 protein was built by PCR amplification of the R1 cDNA sequence contained in the pET3a-hR1 plasmid (kindly given by Pr. Lars Thelander, Umeå University, Sweden) using primers 5′-CTTTAAGAAGGAGATGCTAGCATGCATGTGATCAAG-3′ and 5′-GGGCTTTGTCTCGAGCCGGATCCAC, subsequent digestion with NheI and XhoI, and ligation into the pET28b vector cleaved by the same enzymes. The two complementary primers KV5S (5′-CTAGTCACCATGGGTAAGCCTATCCCTAACCCTCTCCTCGGTCTCGATTCTACGg) and KV5AS (5′-ctagcCGTAGAATCGAGACCGAGGAGAGGGTTAGGGATAGGCTTACCcatggtga) containing the V5 epitope sequence flanked by NheI and SpeI restriction sites were annealed and then ligated with NheI-digested pcDNA3.1 (Life Technologies) to obtain the KV5-pcDNA3.1 vector. The pcDNA3-hp53R2 and pcDNA3-hp53R2mut plasmids were digested with NheI and XhoI, producing a fragment of 1.1 kb that was purified and ligated into KV5-pcDNA3.1 digested with NheI and XhoI to yield KV5-p53R2 and KV5-p53R2mut vectors encoding an N-terminal V5 epitope followed by wild-type and mutant D342E human p53R2 proteins, respectively. All constructs were sequence-verified. K-562 cells were transfected by nucleofection with a Nucleofector II device (Lonza) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1 × 106 cells were resuspended in 100 μl of Nucleofector solution V and mixed with 2 μg of plasmid DNA. Electroporation was performed using the program T-016. The next day, cells were harvested for analysis by immunoblotting. Clones 3 and 19 stably expressing the p53R2-ΔC9 mutant were obtained by limiting dilution of transfected K-562 cells selected for 2 weeks in the presence of 1 mg/ml neomycin sulfate. H1299 cells seeded at 0.3 × 106 cells/well were transfected 24 h later with 4 μg of plasmid DNA using 8 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Life Technologies). Cells were treated 28 h post-transfection with TNF-α and CHX with or without Q-VD-OPh at 2 μm and then harvested 19 h later. His6-tagged wild-type p53R2, p53R2-D342E, and p53R2-ΔC9 mutants were expressed and purified according to the following protocol. Expression vectors pET28b-p53R2, pET28b-p53R2-D342E, and pET28b-p53R2-ΔC9 were used to transform BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIPL bacteria (Stratagene). Overnight cultures of each strain were diluted 100 times in 1 liter of Luria broth medium (LB) and grown at 37 °C until A600 reached 0.6 and then induced by 400 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Bacteria were harvested 4 h later. Human His6-tagged R1 protein was produced in the same expression vector following transformation with the pET28b-hR1His plasmid. The R1 expression protocol was the same as for p53R2 proteins with the following modifications. Cultures were grown at 30 °C to an A600 of 0.6, then the growth temperature was switched to 20 °C, and induction was done at 50 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cultures were then grown overnight before harvesting. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in buffer A (20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.5 m NaCl) containing 20 mm imidazole and lysed by sonication. Nucleic acid precipitation and ammonium sulfate fractionation were performed as described previously for the mouse R2 protein (13.Mann G.J. Gräslund A. Ochiai E. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Purification and characterization of recombinant mouse and herpes simplex virus ribonucleotide reductase R2 subunit.Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Supernatants containing His6-tagged p53R2 proteins were then loaded on a HisTrap HP nickel-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer A containing 20 mm imidazole and washed with buffer A containing 60 mm imidazole. His-tagged p53R2 proteins were then eluted with buffer A containing 150 mm imidazole and immediately concentrated in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 using Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filter devices (Millipore). The iron/radical center in His6-tagged WT p53R2 and p53R2-ΔC9 proteins was reconstituted using an already described anaerobic procedure (14.Guittet O. Ducastel B. Salem J.S. Henry Y. Rubin H. Lemaire G. Lepoivre M. Differential sensitivity of the tyrosyl radical of mouse ribonucleotide reductase to nitric oxide and peroxynitrite.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22136-22144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Activity of p53R2 was assayed using the reduction of [3H]CDP to [3H]dCDP. Active p53R2 or mutant p53R2-ΔC9 was diluted at a final concentration of 4 μm with a 4-fold molar excess of the R1 subunit in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6 containing 100 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 10 mm DTT, 200 μm CDP, and 1 μCi of [5-3H]CDP (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) in a final volume of 90 μl. Each sample was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. The last steps were performed essentially as described (14.Guittet O. Ducastel B. Salem J.S. Henry Y. Rubin H. Lemaire G. Lepoivre M. Differential sensitivity of the tyrosyl radical of mouse ribonucleotide reductase to nitric oxide and peroxynitrite.J. Biol.

A Nucleosil C18 5 μm HPLC column (Interchrom) connected to a radioactive flow detector (model LB506-C1, Berthold) was used to analyze [5-3H]cytidine and [5-3H]deoxycytidine. Nucleoside separation was done with 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.8, 4.25% methanol, 1% low UV PIC-B5 reagent (Waters) as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. Evaluation of caspase-positive cells was determined by flow cytometry using FAM fluorochrome-labeled inhibitors of caspases (FLICA) reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (FLICA Poly Caspases kit, ImmunoChemistry Technologies). Briefly, 1.25 × 106 HeLa 229 cells were treated for 20 h with TNF-α and CHX. Then 1 × 106 cells resuspended in 290 μl of culture medium were incubated with the FAM FLICA pan-caspase reagent for 75 min at 37 °C. The reagent is cell-permeable and binds covalently to activated caspases in apoptotic cells. After two washes with Hanks' balanced salt solution to eliminate the unbound dye, propidium iodide was added at 2.5 μg/ml to distinguish dead cells. Flow cytometry analysis was performed with MoFlo Astrios equipment (Beckman Coulter) using Summit 6.1 software. HeLa 229 cells seeded at 0.7 × 106 cells/well were transfected 24 h later with 75 nm siRNA (Silencer Select validated or predesigned siRNA) using the Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (all from Life Technologies). After 48 h, TNF-α and CHX were added, and cells were harvested 24 h later for immunoblotting analysis of p53R2. In a first set of experiments, lysates from H1299 cells were used as a source of native p53R2 protein. Subconfluent cells grown in two 14-cm culture dishes were harvested by trypsinization. The pellet was resuspended in caspase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS, 5% (w/v) sucrose, 10 mm DTT) supplemented with protease inhibitors including 1 mm Pefabloc and 40 μm N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO. The lysate prepared with a glass Dounce homogenizer was centrifuged for 20 min at 4 °C in a Beckman TL-100.2 rotor at 100,000 × g. A 100-μl aliquot of the soluble fraction was then applied to a BioSpin 6 column (Bio-Rad) pre-equilibrated with caspase buffer to eliminate protease inhibitors by gel filtration. A volume containing 400 μg of protein was then incubated for 1–4 h at 37 °C in caspase buffer with 400–800 ng of recombinant caspase-8 or -3. Finally, the reaction mixture was analyzed by immunoblotting using 30 μg of protein. In a second set of experiments, cell lysates were replaced with purified wild-type or mutant p53R2 proteins. Recombinant proteins were diluted in caspase buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors, which were then eliminated by gel filtration as described above. After caspase addition, proteolysis was tested in a reaction mixture containing a p53R2 protein at 20 μm, 10 μg/ml protease-free BSA, and 1 μg of purified caspase. Incubation was carried out at 37 °C, and four aliquots taken every hour were analyzed by immunoblotting. The Bcr-Abl fusion protein is an oncogenic tyrosine kinase that plays a key role in the pathophysiology of chronic myelogenous leukemia. Inhibitors of Bcr-Abl activity such as imatinib are clinically successful drugs that block the proliferation of Bcr-Abl+ leukemia cells and induce apoptosis. Treatment of the Bcr-Abl+ K-562 leukemia cell line with imatinib induced the appearance of a new band just below the p53R2 full-length polypeptide detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 1A). The effect was dose-dependent. The calculated IC50 of 0.39 ± 0.07 μm and visual examination of the cells indicated that p53R2 proteolysis occurred at cytotoxic concentrations of imatinib (Fig. 1B). The lowest band was revealed using two different primary antibodies recognizing the N-terminal extremity of the p53R2 protein (not shown), suggesting that the additional band was generated from the cleavage of p53R2 at its C-terminal tail. This part of the protein is required for its association with the catalytic subunit R1. Hence, loss of a small C-terminal fragment of p53R2 in K-562 cells undergoing apoptosis should prevent proper binding of p53R2 to R1. Imatinib-induced cleavage of p53R2 increased with time but remained partial even at the latest time points (Fig. 1, C and D). The highest percentage of cleaved p53R2 observed in all our experiments was 46%. The total amount of the protein remained fairly constant (Fig. 1E), suggesting that the cleaved fragment was not subjected to further proteolysis. Imatinib-induced cleavage of p53R2 was also observed using two other chronic leukemia cell lines, AR230 and Lama-84 (not shown). No proteolysis of protein R1 was observed in K-562 cells incubated with imatinib (Fig. 1, A, C, and E). Expression of protein R2, the cell cycle-regulated p53R2 homologue, dramatically decreased during the same time range. Because imatinib also modified K-562 cell cycle distribution (data not shown), we did not further investigate the reasons for R2 breakdown in this experimental model. Very similar results showing p53R2 proteolysis and absence of R1 degradation were obtained using 10–100 nm nilotinib, a second generation Bcr-Abl inhibitor much more potent than imatinib (data not shown). Overall, we observed specific cleavage of a small but essential C-terminal fragment of the p53R2 protein in leukemia cells incubated with proapoptotic anticancer drugs. Caspases play essential roles in apoptotic cell death. Therefore, we suspected caspases to be involved in the cleavage of p53R2 induced in K-562 by proapoptotic Bcr-Abl inhibitors.

https://openalex.org/W1969575165,"Many organs, including salivary glands, lung, and kidney, are formed by epithelial branching during embryonic development. Branching morphogenesis occurs via either local outgrowths or the formation of clefts that subdivide epithelia into buds. This process is promoted by various factors, but the mechanism of branching morphogenesis is not fully understood. Here we have defined melatonin as a potential negative regulator or ""brake"" of branching morphogenesis, shown that the levels of it and its receptors decline when branching morphogenesis begins, and identified the process that it regulates. Melatonin has various physiological functions, including circadian rhythm regulation, free-radical scavenging, and gonadal development. Furthermore, melatonin is present in saliva and may have an important physiological role in the oral cavity. In this study, we found that the melatonin receptor is highly expressed on the acinar epithelium of the embryonic submandibular gland. We also found that exogenous melatonin reduces salivary gland size and inhibits branching morphogenesis. We suggest that this inhibition does not depend on changes in either proliferation or apoptosis, but rather relates to changes in epithelial cell adhesion and morphology. In summary, we have demonstrated a novel function of melatonin in organ formation during embryonic development."
https://openalex.org/W1989679305,"CUB domain-containing protein-1 (CDCP1) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is phosphorylated by SRC family kinases (SFK) before recruiting and activating PKCδ. CDCP1 is overproduced in many cancers. It promotes metastasis and resistance to anoïkis. The robust production of CDCP1 would be associated with stemness and has been proposed as a novel prognosis marker. The natural transmembrane location of CDCP1 makes it an ideal therapeutic target and treatments based on the use of appropriate antibodies are currently being evaluated. However, we still know very little about the molecular fate of CDCP1 and its downstream signaling events. Improvements in our understanding of the molecular events occurring downstream of CDCP1 are required to make use of changes of CDCP1 production or functions for therapeutic purposes. By the mean of co-immunoprecipitation and affinity precipitation we show here, for the first time, that CDCP1 interacts directly, with the cytosolic tyrosine phosphatase SHP2. Point mutants of CDCP1 show that residues Y734 and Y743 are responsible for its interaction with SHP2. It may therefore compete with SFK. We also demonstrate that a shRNA-mediated down regulation of SHP2 is associated with a stronger CDCP1 phosphorylation and an impairment of antibody-mediated CDCP1 internalization."
https://openalex.org/W2011207494,"Aims Weight-loss after bariatric surgery improves insulin sensitivity, but the underlying molecular mechanism is not clear. To ascertain the effect of bariatric surgery on insulin signalling, we examined glucose disposal and Akt activation in morbidly obese volunteers before and after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB), and compared this to lean volunteers. Materials and Methods The hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp, at five infusion rates, was used to determine glucose disposal rates (GDR) in eight morbidly obese (body mass index, BMI=47.3±2.2 kg/m2) patients, before and after RYGB, and in eight lean volunteers (BMI=20.7±0.7 kg/m2). Biopsies of brachioradialis muscle, taken at fasting and insulin concentrations that induced half-maximal (GDR50) and maximal (GDR100) GDR in each subject, were used to examine the phosphorylation of Akt-Thr308, Akt-473, and pras40, in vivo biomarkers for Akt activity. Results Pre-operatively, insulin-stimulated GDR was lower in the obese compared to the lean individuals (P<0.001). Weight-loss of 29.9±4 kg after surgery significantly improved GDR50 (P=0.004) but not GDR100 (P=0.3). These subjects still remained significantly more insulin resistant than the lean individuals (p<0.001). Weight loss increased insulin-stimulated skeletal muscle Akt-Thr308 and Akt-Ser473 phosphorylation, P=0.02 and P=0.03 respectively (MANCOVA), and Akt activity towards the substrate PRAS40 (P=0.003, MANCOVA), and in contrast to GDR, were fully normalised after the surgery (obese vs lean, P=0.6, P=0.35, P=0.46, respectively). Conclusions Our data show that although Akt activity substantially improved after surgery, it did not lead to a full restoration of insulin-stimulated glucose disposal. This suggests that a major defect downstream of, or parallel to, Akt signalling remains after significant weight-loss."
https://openalex.org/W1991313046,"Objectives Induction of the immune response is a major problem in replacement therapies for inherited protein deficiencies. Tolerance created in utero can facilitate postnatal treatment. In this study, we aimed to induce immune tolerance towards a foreign protein with early gestational cell transplantation into the chorionic villi under ultrasound guidance in the murine model. Methods Pregnant C57BL/6 (B6) mice on day 10 of gestation were anesthetized and imaged by high resolution ultrasound. Murine embryos and their placenta were positioned to get a clear view in B-mode with power mode of the labyrinth, which is the equivalent of chorionic villi in the human. Bone marrow cells (BMCs) from B6-Green Fluorescence Protein (B6GFP) transgenic mice were injected into the fetal side of the placenta which includes the labyrinth with glass microcapillary pipettes. Each fetal mouse received 2 x 105 viable GFP-BMCs. After birth, we evaluated the humoral and cell-mediated immune response against GFP. Results Bone marrow transfer into fetal side of placenta efficiently distributed donor cells to the fetal mice. The survival rate of this procedure was 13.5%(5 out of 37). Successful engraftment of the B6-GFP donor skin grafts was observed in all recipient (5 out of 5) mice 6 weeks after birth. Induction of anti-GFP antibodies was completely inhibited. Cytotoxic immune reactivity of thymic cells against cells harboring GFP was suppressed by ELISPOT assay. Conclusions In this study, we utilized early gestational placental injection targeting the murine fetus, to transfer donor cells carrying a foreign protein into the fetal circulation. This approach is sufficient to induce both humoral and cell-mediated immune tolerance against the foreign protein."
https://openalex.org/W2087417318,"Objectives Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection plays an important role in the carcinogenesis and development of gastric cancer. Eradication of H. pylori can effectively reduce the risk of gastric cancer, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. This study aimed to investigate the effect of eradication of H. pylori on the expression levels of FHIT, IL-8 and P73 in the gastric mucosa of first-degree relatives of gastric cancer patients. Methods One hundred and thirty-two patients with functional dyspepsia having first-degree relatives with gastric cancer were prospectively recruited in this study. Nine patients presented with H. pylori infection and family histories of gastric cancer, 61 with H. pylori infection and without family histories of gastric cancer, 6 without H. pylori infection and with family histories of gastric cancer, and 56 without H. pylori infection and family histories of gastric cancer. The protein and mRNA expression levels of FHIT, IL-8 and P73 in gastric mucosa of the subjects were detected by immunohistochemical staining and polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Results Compared with the patients without H. pylori infection and family histories of gastric cancer, both the protein and mRNA levels of FIHT significantly decreased in patients with H. pylori infection and/or family histories of gastric cancer, and both the protein and mRNA levels of IL-8 significantly increased. After eradication of H. pylori, both the protein and mRNA levels of FHIT were significantly higher, and both the protein and mRNA levels of IL-8 were significantly lower. However, H. pylori infection and family histories of gastric cancer had no major effect on P73 expression. Conclusions Down-regulation of FHIT and up-regulation of IL-8 may be involved in the pathogenesis of H. pylori infection in the first-degree relatives of gastric cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W1988048033,"The C-terminal Eps 15 Homology Domain proteins (EHD1-4) play important roles in regulating endocytic trafficking. EHD2 is the only family member whose crystal structure has been solved, and it contains an unstructured loop consisting of two proline-phenylalanine (PF) motifs: KPFRKLNPF. In contrast, despite EHD2 having nearly 70% amino acid identity with its paralogs, EHD1, EHD3 and EHD4, the latter proteins contain a single KPF or RPF motif, but no NPF motif. In this study, we sought to define the precise role of each PF motif in EHD2’s homo-dimerization, binding with the protein partners, and subcellular localization. To test the role of the NPF motif, we generated an EHD2 NPF-to-NAF mutant to mimic the homologous sequences of EHD1 and EHD3. We demonstrated that this mutant lost both its ability to dimerize and bind to Syndapin2. However, it continued to localize primarily to the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane. On the other hand, EHD2 NPF-to-APA mutants displayed normal dimerization and Syndapin2 binding, but exhibited markedly increased nuclear localization and reduced association with the plasma membrane. We then hypothesized that the single PF motif of EHD1 (that aligns with the KPF of EHD2) might be responsible for both binding and localization functions of EHD1. Indeed, the EHD1 RPF motif was required for dimerization, interaction with MICAL-L1 and Syndapin2, as well as localization to tubular recycling endosomes. Moreover, recycling assays demonstrated that EHD1 RPF-to-APA was incapable of supporting normal receptor recycling. Overall, our data suggest that the EHD2 NPF phenylalanine residue is crucial for EHD2 localization to the plasma membrane, whereas the proline residue is essential for EHD2 dimerization and binding. These studies support the recently proposed model in which the EHD2 N-terminal region may regulate the availability of the unstructured loop for interactions with neighboring EHD2 dimers, thus promoting oligomerization."
https://openalex.org/W2062403740,"Mapping human brain networks provides a basis for studying brain function and dysfunction, and thus has gained significant interest in recent years. However, modeling human brain networks still faces several challenges including constructing networks at multiple spatial scales and finding common corresponding networks across individuals. As a consequence, many previous methods were designed for a single resolution or scale of brain network, though the brain networks are multi-scale in nature. To address this problem, this paper presents a novel approach to constructing multi-scale common structural brain networks from DTI data via an improved multi-scale spectral clustering applied on our recently developed and validated DICCCOLs (Dense Individualized and Common Connectivity-based Cortical Landmarks). Since the DICCCOL landmarks possess intrinsic structural correspondences across individuals and populations, we employed the multi-scale spectral clustering algorithm to group the DICCCOL landmarks and their connections into sub-networks, meanwhile preserving the intrinsically-established correspondences across multiple scales. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method can generate multi-scale consistent and common structural brain networks across subjects, and its reproducibility has been verified by multiple independent datasets. As an application, these multi-scale networks were used to guide the clustering of multi-scale fiber bundles and to compare the fiber integrity in schizophrenia and healthy controls. In general, our methods offer a novel and effective framework for brain network modeling and tract-based analysis of DTI data."
https://openalex.org/W1968847686,"To obtain different amino acids with varying lipophilicity and that can carry up to three positive charges we have developed a number of new triamino acid building blocks. One set of building blocks was achieved by aminoethyl extension, via reductive amination, of the side chain of ortnithine, diaminopropanoic and diaminobutanoic acid. A second set of triamino acids with the aminoethyl extension having hydrocarbon side chains was synthesized from diaminobutanoic acid. The aldehydes needed for the extension by reductive amination were synthesized from the corresponding Fmoc-L-2-amino fatty acids in two steps. Reductive amination of these compounds with Boc-L-Dab-OH gave the C4-C8 alkyl-branched triamino acids. All triamino acids were subsequently Boc-protected at the formed secondary amine to make the monomers appropriate for the N-terminus position when performing Fmoc-based solid-phase peptide synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1977522491,"Influenza virus (IFV) can evolve rapidly leading to genetic drifts and shifts resulting in human and animal influenza epidemics and pandemics. The genetic shift that gave rise to the 2009 influenza A/H1N1 pandemic originated from a triple gene reassortment of avian, swine and human IFVs. More minor genetic alterations in genetic drift can lead to influenza drug resistance such as the H274Y mutation associated with oseltamivir resistance. Hence, a rapid tool to detect IFV mutations and the potential emergence of new virulent strains can better prepare us for seasonal influenza outbreaks as well as potential pandemics. Furthermore, identification of specific mutations by closely examining single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IFV sequences is essential to classify potential genetic markers associated with potentially dangerous IFV phenotypes. In this study, we developed a novel R library called “SNPer” to analyze quantitative variants in SNPs among IFV subpopulations. The computational SNPer program was applied to three different subpopulations of published IFV genomic information. SNPer queried SNPs data and grouped the SNPs into (1) universal SNPs, (2) likely common SNPs, and (3) unique SNPs. SNPer outperformed manual visualization in terms of time and labor. SNPer took only three seconds with no errors in SNP comparison events compared with 40 hours with errors using manual visualization. The SNPer tool can accelerate the capacity to capture new and potentially dangerous IFV strains to mitigate future influenza outbreaks."

https://openalex.org/W2013662919,"Due to the growth of interest in single-cell genomics, computational methods for distinguishing true variants from artifacts are highly desirable. While special attention has been paid to false positives in variant or mutation calling from single-cell sequencing data, an equally important but often neglected issue is that of false negatives derived from allele dropout during the amplification of single cell genomes. In this paper, we propose a simple strategy to reduce the false negatives in single-cell sequencing data analysis. Simulation results show that this method is highly reliable, with an error rate of 4.94×10-5, which is orders of magnitude lower than the expected false negative rate (~34%) estimated from a single-cell exome dataset, though the method is limited by the low SNP density in the human genome. We applied this method to analyze the exome data of a few dozen single tumor cells generated in previous studies, and extracted cell specific mutation information for a small set of sites. Interestingly, we found that there are difficulties in using the classical clonal model of tumor cell growth to explain the mutation patterns observed in some tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2078097364,"In the present study, we investigate a control mechanism that dampens hand vibrations. Here, we propose a control method with two components to suppress hand vibrations. The first is a passive suppression method that lowers the joint stiffness to passively dampen the hand vibrations. The second is an active suppression method that adjusts an equilibrium point based on skyhook control to actively dampen the hand vibrations. In a simulation experiment, we applied these two methods to dampen hand vibrations during the shoulder's horizontal oscillation. We also conducted a measurement experiment wherein a subject's shoulder was sinusoidally oscillated by a platform that generated horizontal oscillations. The results of the measurement experiments showed that the jerk of each part of the arm in a task using a cup filled with water was smaller than the shoulder jerk and that in a task with a cup filled with stones was larger than the shoulder jerk. Moreover, the amplitude of the hand trajectory in both horizontal and vertical directions was smaller in a task using a cup filled with water than in a task using a cup filled with stones. The results of the measurement experiments were accurately reproduced by the active suppression method based on skyhook control. These results suggest that humans dampen hand vibrations by controlling the equilibrium point through the information of the external workspace and the internal body state rather than by lowering joint stiffness only by using internal information."
