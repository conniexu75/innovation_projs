https://openalex.org/W3025320502,"Understanding adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is important for vaccine development, interpreting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pathogenesis, and calibration of pandemic control measures. Using HLA class I and II predicted peptide ""megapools,"" circulating SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were identified in ∼70% and 100% of COVID-19 convalescent patients, respectively. CD4+ T cell responses to spike, the main target of most vaccine efforts, were robust and correlated with the magnitude of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA titers. The M, spike, and N proteins each accounted for 11%-27% of the total CD4+ response, with additional responses commonly targeting nsp3, nsp4, ORF3a, and ORF8, among others. For CD8+ T cells, spike and M were recognized, with at least eight SARS-CoV-2 ORFs targeted. Importantly, we detected SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ T cells in ∼40%-60% of unexposed individuals, suggesting cross-reactive T cell recognition between circulating ""common cold"" coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2."
https://openalex.org/W3030339055,"Brain malignancies encompass a range of primary and metastatic cancers, including low-grade and high-grade gliomas and brain metastases (BrMs) originating from diverse extracranial tumors. Our understanding of the brain tumor microenvironment (TME) remains limited, and it is unknown whether it is sculpted differentially by primary versus metastatic disease. We therefore comprehensively analyzed the brain TME landscape via flow cytometry, RNA sequencing, protein arrays, culture assays, and spatial tissue characterization. This revealed disease-specific enrichment of immune cells with pronounced differences in proportional abundance of tissue-resident microglia, infiltrating monocyte-derived macrophages, neutrophils, and T cells. These integrated analyses also uncovered multifaceted immune cell activation within brain malignancies entailing converging transcriptional trajectories while maintaining disease- and cell-type-specific programs. Given the interest in developing TME-targeted therapies for brain malignancies, this comprehensive resource of the immune landscape offers insights into possible strategies to overcome tumor-supporting TME properties and instead harness the TME to fight cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3029490475,"PD-1 blockade has transformed the management of advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), but the drivers and resistors of the PD-1 response remain incompletely elucidated. Here, we analyzed 592 tumors from patients with advanced ccRCC enrolled in prospective clinical trials of treatment with PD-1 blockade by whole-exome and RNA sequencing, integrated with immunofluorescence analysis, to uncover the immunogenomic determinants of the therapeutic response. Although conventional genomic markers (such as tumor mutation burden and neoantigen load) and the degree of CD8+ T cell infiltration were not associated with clinical response, we discovered numerous chromosomal alterations associated with response or resistance to PD-1 blockade. These advanced ccRCC tumors were highly CD8+ T cell infiltrated, with only 27% having a non-infiltrated phenotype. Our analysis revealed that infiltrated tumors are depleted of favorable PBRM1 mutations and enriched for unfavorable chromosomal losses of 9p21.3, as compared with non-infiltrated tumors, demonstrating how the potential interplay of immunophenotypes with somatic alterations impacts therapeutic efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W3032465961,"Brain malignancies can either originate from within the CNS (gliomas) or invade from other locations in the body (metastases). A highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) influences brain tumor outgrowth. Whether the TME is predominantly shaped by the CNS micromilieu or by the malignancy itself is unknown, as is the diversity, origin, and function of CNS tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Here, we have mapped the leukocyte landscape of brain tumors using high-dimensional single-cell profiling (CyTOF). The heterogeneous composition of tissue-resident and invading immune cells within the TME alone permitted a clear distinction between gliomas and brain metastases (BrM). The glioma TME presented predominantly with tissue-resident, reactive microglia, whereas tissue-invading leukocytes accumulated in BrM. Tissue-invading TAMs showed a distinctive signature trajectory, revealing tumor-driven instruction along with contrasting lymphocyte activation and exhaustion. Defining the specific immunological signature of brain tumors can facilitate the rational design of targeted immunotherapy strategies."

What were the early events that led to such a severe outbreak? Gonzalez-Reiche et al. sampled some of the early patients seeking assistance in February and March of 2020 at the Mount Sinai Health System. Phylogenetic analysis of virus sequences in these people, who were drawn from across NYC, showed that the virus had been independently introduced many times from Europe and elsewhere in the United States. Subsequent clusters of community transmission occurred. The focus of infection in NYC is a marker of the role this city plays as a two-way hub for human movement. Science this issue p. 297"
https://openalex.org/W3029490310,"Acute physical activity leads to several changes in metabolic, cardiovascular, and immune pathways. Although studies have examined selected changes in these pathways, the system-wide molecular response to an acute bout of exercise has not been fully characterized. We performed longitudinal multi-omic profiling of plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells including metabolome, lipidome, immunome, proteome, and transcriptome from 36 well-characterized volunteers, before and after a controlled bout of symptom-limited exercise. Time-series analysis revealed thousands of molecular changes and an orchestrated choreography of biological processes involving energy metabolism, oxidative stress, inflammation, tissue repair, and growth factor response, as well as regulatory pathways. Most of these processes were dampened and some were reversed in insulin-resistant participants. Finally, we discovered biological pathways involved in cardiopulmonary exercise response and developed prediction models revealing potential resting blood-based biomarkers of peak oxygen consumption."

Here, we show that UV cones in the larval zebrafish area temporalis are specifically tuned for UV-bright prey capture in their upper frontal visual field, which may use the signal from a single cone at a time. For this, UV-photon detection probability is regionally boosted more than 10-fold. Next, in vivo two-photon imaging, transcriptomics, and computational modeling reveal that these cones use an elevated baseline of synaptic calcium to facilitate the encoding of bright objects, which in turn results from expressional tuning of phototransduction genes. Moreover, the light-driven synaptic calcium signal is regionally slowed by interactions with horizontal cells and later accentuated at the level of glutamate release driving retinal networks. These regional differences tally with variations between peripheral and foveal cones in primates and hint at a common mechanistic origin.

In vision, photoreceptors drive the retinal network through continuous modulations in synaptic release (Baden et al., 2013aBaden T. Euler T. Weckström M. Lagnado L.

However, how changes in incoming photon flux lead to changes in the rate of vesicle fusion at the synapse varies dramatically between photoreceptor designs (Bellono et al., 2018Bellono N.W.

For example, in the vertebrate retina, the slow rod photoreceptors typically have large outer segments and high-gain intracellular signaling cascades to deliver single-photon sensitivity critical for vision at low light (Field et al., 2005Field G.D.

In contrast, cone photoreceptors are faster and have smaller outer segments and lower-gain cascades to take over where rods saturate (Lamb, 2016Lamb T.D.

Clearly, matching the properties of a given photoreceptor type to a specific set of sensory tasks critically underpins vision. However, these visual requirements can differ dramatically across the retinal surface and the corresponding position in visual space (Baden et al., 2013bBaden T. Schubert T. Chang L. Wei T.

Nilsson D.-E. Animal Eyes. Oxford University Press, 2012Crossref Google Scholar), even cones of a single type must therefore be functionally tuned depending on their retinal location. Indeed, photoreceptor tuning, even within type, is a fundamental property of vision in both invertebrates (Hardie, 1984Hardie R.C.

Even primates make use of this trick; foveal cones have longer integration times than their peripheral counterparts, likely to boost their signal to noise ratio, as in the foveal center, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) do not spatially pool their inputs (Baudin et al., 2019Baudin J.

Understanding the mechanisms that underlie such functional tuning will be important for understanding how sensory systems can operate in the natural sensory world and how they might have evolved to suit new sensory-ecological niches (Cronin et al., 2014Cronin T.W.

Larval zebrafish prey capture is elicited by a bright spot of light (Bianco et al., 2011Bianco I.H. Kampff A.R. Engert F.

Nevala N.E. Yoshimatsu T. Osorio D. Nilsson D.-E. Berens P. Baden T. Zebrafish differentially process color across visual space to match natural scenes.Curr. Biol. 2018; 28: 2018-2032.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar; Figure 1A). To the human observer with comparatively long-wavelength vision (Nathans, 1999Nathans J. The evolution and physiology of human color vision: insights from molecular genetic studies of visual pigments.Neuron. 1999; 24: 299-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), these organisms are largely transparent when viewed against a back light (Johnsen and Widder, 2001Johnsen S. Widder E.A. Ultraviolet absorption in transparent zooplankton and its implications for depth distribution and visual predation.Mar. Biol. 2001; 138: 717-730Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). However, previous work suggests that zooplankton like paramecia scatter light in the UV band (320–390 nm) and thus appear as UV-bright spots (Novales Flamarique, 2012Novales Flamarique I. Opsin switch reveals function of the ultraviolet cone in fish foraging.Proc. Biol. Sci. 2012; 280 (20122490–20122490)PubMed Google Scholar, Novales Flamarique, 2016Novales Flamarique I.

Zebrafish differentially process color across visual space to match natural scenes.Curr. Biol. 2018; 28: 2018-2032.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To explicitly test this idea, we custom-built a camera system with a UV and a “yellow” channel aligned with the zebrafish UV- and red/green-opsin absorption spectra, respectively (Chinen et al., 2003Chinen A. Hamaoka T. Yamada Y. Kawamura S. Gene duplication and spectral diversification of cone visual pigments of zebrafish.Genetics. 2003; 163: 663-675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We used this system to film free-swimming paramecia in a naturalistic tank placed outdoors under the midday sun (Figures 1B–1E; Video S1; STAR Methods). While the yellow image provided good spatial detail of the scene’s background and surface water movements, paramecia were difficult to detect among the background clutter (Figure 1D, left). In contrast, the UV channel was dominated by a vertical brightness gradient of scattered light, which almost completely masked the background. Superimposed on this gradient, the upper water column readily highlighted individual paramecia as bright moving spots (Figure 1D, right, and 1E). In agreement, zebrafish use their upper-frontal visual field to detect and capture prey (Bianco et al., 2011Bianco I.H. Kampff A.R. Engert F. Prey capture behavior evoked by simple visual stimuli in larval zebrafish.Front. Syst. Neurosci. 2011; 5: 101Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, Mearns et al., 2020Mearns D.S. Donovan J.C.

Bear J. Roberts P. Janiak F. Semmelhack J. Yoshimatsu T. Baden T.

Biol. 2018; 28: 2018-2032.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This confirmed that vastly different, and largely nonoverlapping types of information (Cronin and Bok, 2016Cronin T.W. Bok M.J. Photoreception and vision in the ultraviolet.J. Exp. Biol. 2016; 219: 2790-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) are obtainable from these two wavebands available to the zebrafish larvae. Any differences between the UV and yellow waveband (Figures 1D and 1E; Video S1) are likely to be further exacerbated by the fish’s self-movements relative to the scene. These would add major brightness transitions in the yellow, but not the UV, channel. Accordingly, under natural (rather than laboratory-controlled) viewing conditions, paramecia are likely hard to detect in the yellow waveband but readily stand out in the UV. This strongly suggests that larval zebrafish must capitalize on UV vision rather than achromatic or long-wavelength vision to support visual prey detection in nature (Cronin and Bok, 2016Cronin T.W.

The yellow channel provides spatial detail of the background and underside of the water, which masks paramecia swimming in the foreground. In contrast, the UV channel does not resolve the background clutter but instead brings out paramecia illuminated by the sun as bright dots in the upper water column. Videos recorded at 10 Hz and played back in real time (STAR Methods). Indeed, UV illumination strongly facilitated behavioral performance: Head-mounted 7–8 days post-fertilization (dpf) larvae in the presence of free-swimming paramecia exhibited significantly more prey-capture attempts when illuminated with UV light (374 nm) compared to yellow light (507 nm) (Figures 1F–1H). This difference was abolished after genetic ablation of UV cones (Figure 1H, bottom; STAR Methods). Together, these results strongly suggest that UV cones provide the dominant input to visual prey-capture circuits in larval zebrafish. The ∼300-μm-diameter eyes of larval zebrafish necessarily offer limited spatial resolution (Haug et al., 2010Haug M.F. Biehlmaier O. Mueller K.P. Neuhauss S.C. Visual acuity in larval zebrafish: behavior and histology.Front. Zool. 2010; 7: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), meaning that visually detecting their even smaller prey presents a substantial challenge. We therefore set out to determine the maximal number of UV cones the fish can use for this task. At 8 dpf, larval zebrafish have ∼2,400 UV cones per eye. These are unevenly distributed and exhibit a 3-fold elevation in the center of the SZ (Zimmermann et al., 2018Zimmermann M.J.Y. Nevala N.E. Yoshimatsu T. Osorio D. Nilsson D.-E. Berens P. Baden T.

At rest and during hunting, larval zebrafish converge their 169° ± 4.9° (n = 4) field-of-view eyes by ∼36° and ∼76° (Bianco et al., 2011Bianco I.H. Kampff A.R. Engert F.

Based on these numbers, we computed the spatial detection limits of the UV detector array across both eyes (Figures 2A–2D and S1A–S1D). Before initiating the actual strike, and prior to converging their eyes, zebrafish must first detect their prey (Gahtan et al., 2005Gahtan E. Tanger P. Baier H.

This mostly occurs within the upper visual field (∼30° elevation; Mearns et al., 2020Mearns D.S. Donovan J.C. Fernandes A.M. Semmelhack J.L. Baier H.

Within this region, prey-detection performance is highest when the target is laterally displaced from the center of the binocular visual field by ∼23° (Mearns et al., 2020Mearns D.S. Donovan J.C.

This same region was surveyed by each eye’s SZ (Figures 2A, S1A, and S1B), confirming that zebrafish indeed capitalize on the elevated UV cone density in this part of the eye for prey detection. However, with a mean SZ UV-cone spacing of 0.19 cones/°2 and a UV cone-receptive field diameter of ∼0.76°, even at its peak, this UV-detector array nevertheless dramatically undersamples visual space for this critical behavioral task (Figure 2B): larval zebrafish can detect <100-μm prey (Lawrence, 2007Lawrence C.

This is more than two times smaller than required for reliable detection at the Nyquist limit. It therefore follows that zebrafish are unlikely to use more than a single UV cone at a time to trigger the initial behavioral response. Once this prey is detected, zebrafish orient toward it and converge their eyes (Bianco et al., 2011Bianco I.H. Kampff A.R. Engert F.

This brings both SZs into near-perfect alignment directly in front of the fish, thus enabling stereoptic estimation of exact prey position for subsequent capture (Patterson et al., 2013Patterson B.W.

Biol. 2013; 216: 3071-3083Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar; Figures 2D, S1C, and S1D). The actual strike is then initiated at a distance of ∼1 mm (Patterson et al., 2013Patterson B.W. Abraham A.O. MacIver M.A. McLean D.L. Visually guided gradation of prey capture movements in larval zebrafish.J. Exp. Biol. 2013; 216: 3071-3083Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), when a 100-μm paramecium subtends a visual angle of ∼5.7° (Figure 2D). At this angular size, it reliably covers two or three UV cones per eye yet rarely substantially more. Taken together, single UV cones in the SZ therefore likely underlie initial prey detection, triggering prey-orientation behavior. Further, the actual strike is then likely supported by at most a handful of UV photoreceptors per eye. As single cones may suffice for prey detection, and in view of the relatively low UV signal in natural light (Losey et al., 1999Losey G.S. Cronin T.W.T. Goldsmith T.H. Hydes D. Marshall N.J.N.

In contrast, UV cones outside the SZ might be able to afford lower photon catch probability and thus conserve space and energy, as it is possible to pool the coincident signals from multiple UV cones (e.g., for UV-dark silhouette-based predator detection) (Cronin and Bok, 2016Cronin T.W. Bok M.J. Photoreception and vision in the ultraviolet.J. Exp. Biol. 2016; 219: 2790-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A simple way to increase a vertebrate photoreceptor’s photon catch probability is to enlarge its outer segment, which houses the phototransduction machinery (de Busserolles et al., 2014de Busserolles F.

To test this, we genetically labeled all UV cones (green), stained outer segments of all cones using the membrane dye BODIPY (magenta), and assessed their morphology using confocal imaging (Figures 2E–2G). This revealed more than 10-fold variations in outer segment lengths. SZ UV cones had the longest outer segments (9.0 ± 0.4 μm), while the immediately neighboring ventral UV cones had the shortest (0.6 ± 0.8 μm). A secondary peak occurred in nasal UV cones (7.0 ± 0.5 μm), which survey the outward horizon, possibly to also support the UV-dr"
https://openalex.org/W3032412335,"Small molecule neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1) agonists have been pursued for more than 40 years as potential therapeutics for psychiatric disorders, including drug addiction. Clinical development of NTSR1 agonists has, however, been precluded by their severe side effects. NTSR1, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), signals through the canonical activation of G proteins and engages β-arrestins to mediate distinct cellular signaling events. Here, we characterize the allosteric NTSR1 modulator SBI-553. This small molecule not only acts as a β-arrestin-biased agonist but also extends profound β-arrestin bias to the endogenous ligand by selectively antagonizing G protein signaling. SBI-553 shows efficacy in animal models of psychostimulant abuse, including cocaine self-administration, without the side effects characteristic of balanced NTSR1 agonism. These findings indicate that NTSR1 G protein and β-arrestin activation produce discrete and separable physiological effects, thus providing a strategy to develop safer GPCR-targeting therapeutics with more directed pharmacological action."

However, this observation has overlooked potential roles for mural cells in directly affecting tumor growth independent of BV function. Here we provide clinical data correlating high percentages of mural-β3-integrin-negative tumor BVs with increased tumor sizes but no effect on BV numbers. Mural-β3-integrin loss also enhances tumor growth in implanted and autochthonous mouse tumor models with no detectable effects on BV numbers or function. At a molecular level, mural-cell β3-integrin loss enhances signaling via FAK-p-HGFR-p-Akt-p-p65, driving CXCL1, CCL2, and TIMP-1 production. In particular, mural-cell-derived CCL2 stimulates tumor cell MEK1-ERK1/2-ROCK2-dependent signaling and enhances tumor cell survival and tumor growth. Overall, our data indicate that mural cells can control tumor growth via paracrine signals regulated by β3-integrin, providing a previously unrecognized mechanism of cancer growth control."

RIG-I, but not MDA5, has been suggested to sense some bunyavirus infections; however, the roles of RLRs in anti-SFTSV immune responses remain unclear. Here, we show that SFTSV infection induces an antiviral response accompanied by significant induction of antiviral and inflammatory cytokines and that RIG-I plays a main role in this induction by recognizing viral 5′-triphosphorylated RNAs and by signaling via the adaptor mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein. Moreover, MDA5 may also sense SFTSV infection and contribute to IFN induction, but to a lesser extent. We further demonstrate that the RLR-mediated anti-SFTSV signaling can be antagonized by SFTSV nonstructural protein (NSs) at the level of RIG-I activation. Protein interaction and MS-based analyses revealed that NSs interacts with the host protein tripartite motif–containing 25 (TRIM25), a critical RIG-I–activating ubiquitin E3 ligase, but not with RIG-I or Riplet, another E3 ligase required for RIG-I ubiquitination. NSs specifically trapped TRIM25 into viral inclusion bodies and inhibited TRIM25-mediated RIG-I-Lys-63–linked ubiquitination/activation, contributing to suppression of RLR-mediated antiviral signaling at its initial stage. These results provide insights into immune responses to SFTSV infection and clarify a mechanism of the viral immune evasion, which may help inform the development of antiviral therapeutics.

Although the host perception and antiviral signaling mechanism against SFTSV infection is unclear, previous studies by us and others have established that the NSs of SFTSV can antagonize RIG-I and MDA5 signaling cascades by targeting the downstream kinases TBK1/IKKε and inhibit type I IFN production, implying that the RLRs might be implicated in host response to SFTSV infection (28Ning Y.J.

However, the detailed roles of RLRs in host immune and inflammatory responses to SFTSV infection have not been directly investigated. As the emerging representative of high-pathogenic bunyaviruses, SFTSV is considered as one of the most dangerous pathogens and is included by the World Health Organization in its list of the top priority viruses requiring urgent research and development efforts. The mechanisms underlying the host recognition and immune responses to SFTSV thus particularly merit clarification. In this work, we demonstrate that SFTSV infection triggers rapid immune and inflammatory cytokine responses in human cells, in which indeed, RIG-I plays a major role by recognizing the viral 5′ppp RNAs and signaling through the adaptor MAVS. MDA5 appears to also sense SFTSV infection and induce IFN expression, but to a significantly lesser extent. Next, we show that the RLR antiviral signaling can be antagonized by SFTSV NSs at the level of RIG-I ubiquitination and activation. Previously, Santiago et al. (43Santiago F.W. Covaleda L.M. Sanchez-Aparicio M.T. Silvas J.A. Diaz-Vizarreta A.C. Patel J.R. Popov V. Yu X.J. García-Sastre A. Aguilar P.V. Hijacking of RIG-I signaling proteins into virus-induced cytoplasmic structures correlates with the inhibition of type I interferon responses.J.

Here, endogenous TRIM25 (but not RIG-I itself or another E3 ubiquitin ligase, Riplet) was first identified in NSs coprecipitates by MS. Then the specific interaction of NSs with TRIM25 was further validated in various contexts, including those of viral infection. Furthermore, we found that by the specific interaction of NSs with TRIM25, NSs traps TRIM25 into viral inclusion bodies (IBs) and abates TRIM25-mediated Lys-63 ubiquitination and activation of RIG-I. The work not only clarifies the roles of RLRs in cellular recognition of SFTSV and consequent immune and inflammatory responses but also establishes an IB-associated, RIG-I ubiquitination–targeting immune escape mechanism by which SFTSV achieves inhibition of the host antiviral response at the initial stage of RLR signaling. Currently, how host cells recognize SFTSV infection and mediate immune and inflammatory responses is unclear. To gain insights into the antiviral and inflammatory pathways triggered by SFTSV, we first investigated type I IFN, ISG, and inflammatory cytokine responses in SFTSV-infected cells. As monitored by real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), along with SFTSV replication in HEK293 cells, a prompt and substantial expression of IFN-β mRNA could be observed as early as 3 h postinfection (hpi) (Fig. 1, A and B). Similarly, the mRNA expression of ISG56 (also known as IFIT1), a notable antiviral ISG (47Diamond M.S. Farzan M. The broad-spectrum antiviral functions of IFIT and IFITM proteins.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 13 (23237964): 46-5710.1038/nri3344Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), could be quickly induced 3 hpi and peaked at 6 hpi in the infected cells (Fig. 1C). The mRNA expression of several other antiviral ISGs, including 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase 2 (OAS2), myxoma resistance protein 1 (MxA), and ISG15, was also elevated at the early stage of SFTSV infection (the first 12 h of infection) and could be further increased and peaked at 24 hpi (Fig. 1C), exhibiting a somewhat different behavior from the expression of ISG56. Consistently, notable induction of the antiviral ISGs upon SFTSV infection could be validated at protein levels by Western blotting (WB) analyses (Fig. S1A). These observations suggest that host cells can rapidly sense SFTSV infection and mount a specific antiviral IFN and ISG response. Clinical studies reported that a panel of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-8 (IL-8), IFN-γ–inducible protein 10 (IP-10), regulated on activation normal T cell–expressed and secreted (RANTES), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), is highly induced in SFTSV-infected human sera (40Deng B.

To investigate whether SFTSV infection can directly result in cytokine eruption, we tested the expression levels of the representative cytokines and chemokines in SFTSV-infected cells. As shown in Fig. 1D, the mRNA levels of IL-8, RANTES, TNFα, and IP-10 were notably elevated as early as 3 hpi and continuously increased to peak values at 24–36 hpi in SFTSV-infected HEK293 cells (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, secretion of the cytokines induced by the virus infection was evidently detected by ELISA (Fig. S1B). These findings indicate that SFTSV infection provokes a rapid and substantial inflammatory reaction. Consistently, substantial induction of IFN-β, ISGs, and inflammatory cytokines was also detected in A549 and THP-1 cells (Fig. S2). Additionally, we observed that infections with higher SFTSV multiplicities of infection (MOI) were associated with increased immune and inflammatory responses (Fig. 1, E and F). Together, these results suggested that SFTSV infection can be rapidly recognized by the host cells and thus trigger distinct antiviral and inflammatory responses. RLRs, RIG-I and MDA5, are expressed broadly in most cell types, including all of the cells used in the present study. Moreover, RIG-I has been shown to play a critical role in host immune response to several bunyaviruses. Thus, we began to explore the roles of RLRs in the context of SFTSV infection. First, the mRNA and protein expression of RIG-I and MDA5 during SFTSV infection was analyzed by qRT-PCR and WB analyses, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2A, following SFTSV infection, mRNA expression of RIG-I and MDA5 could be quickly enhanced. Correspondingly, protein expression of RIG-I and MDA5 was also rapidly elevated to remarkably higher levels 12 hpi (SFTSV-infected cells versus the mock group) (Fig. 2B). In comparison, no obvious induction was observed in the expression of MAVS, the adaptor downstream of RIG-I and MDA5 (Fig. 2, A and B). Consistently, the specific induction of RIG-I and MDA5 also could be detected in SFTSV-infected A549 and THP-1 cells (Fig. S3). These data indicate the substantial induction of RIG-I and MDA5 in response to SFTSV infection, providing details and references for further characterizing the roles of these RLRs in SFTSV infection.

We investigated the effects of propionic acid (PA) and caproic acid (CA) on metabolic risk factors, liver and adipose tissue pathology, brain function, structure (by MRI), and gene expression, during obesity development in Ldlr−/−.Leiden mice. Ldlr−/−.Leiden mice received 16 weeks either a high-fat diet (HFD) to induce obesity, or chow as reference group. Next, obese HFD-fed mice were treated 12 weeks with (a) HFD + CA (CA), (b) HFD + PA (PA), or (c) a HFD-control group. PA reduced the body weight and systolic blood pressure, lowered fasting insulin levels, and reduced HFD-induced liver macrovesicular steatosis, hypertrophy, inflammation, and collagen content. PA increased the amount of glucose transporter type 1-positive cerebral blood vessels, reverted cerebral vasoreactivity, and HFD-induced effects in microstructural gray and white matter integrity of optic tract, and somatosensory and visual cortex. PA and CA also reverted HFD-induced effects in functional connectivity between visual and auditory cortex. However, PA mice were more anxious in open field, and showed reduced activity of synaptogenesis and glutamate regulators in hippocampus. Therefore, PA treatment should be used with caution even though positive metabolic, (cerebro) vascular, and brain structural and functional effects were observed."
https://openalex.org/W3029607796,"The present study aimed to investigate the effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal communities originating from organic and conventional agriculture on wheat growth and yield. Six different spring wheat cultivars released in different years in north and central European countries were considered. We hypothesised that AM fungal inoculum collected from organic agricultural fields would elicit a greater positive growth response than inoculum collected from conventional agricultural fields; and that older cultivars, which were developed under conditions of low fertilizer input, would exhibit overall greater growth responses to the presence of AM fungi, compared with more recent cultivars, and that AM fungal inoculum from conventional fields might have the most beneficial effect on the growth and yield of recent cultivars. The results showed that the overall effects on the growth and yield of spring wheat grown with organic and conventional AM fungal inocula did not differ greatly. However, the inoculation growth response, showing the difference of the effects of organic and conventional inocula, varied between particular wheat cultivars. Inoculation growth response of the cultivar Pikker (released in 1959) was the most positive, while that of the cultivar Arabella (released in 2012) was the most negative. The use of AM fungal inoculum from organic fields resulted in slightly taller plant individuals. Pikker showed relatively higher yield and stronger growth when the organic AM fungal inoculum was used. Arabella exhibited relatively lower yield and weaker growth when the organic inoculum was used. Whether the positive response of Pikker to Estonian organic inoculation reflects adaptation to the locally occurring AM fungal community needs to be established by further studies of the communities of AM fungi colonizing wheat roots."

Multiple mechanisms of endocrine therapy resistance have been identified, including cancer stem-like cell (CSC) activity. Here we investigate SFX-01, a stabilised formulation of sulforaphane (SFN), for its effects on breast CSC activity in ER+ preclinical models. SFX-01 reduced mammosphere formation efficiency (MFE) of ER+ primary and metastatic patient samples. Both tamoxifen and fulvestrant increased MFE and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors, which was reversed by combination with SFX-01. SFX-01 significantly reduced tumor-initiating cell frequency in secondary transplants and reduced the formation of spontaneous lung micrometastases by PDX tumors in mice. Mechanistically, we establish that both tamoxifen and fulvestrant induce STAT3 phosphorylation. SFX-01 suppressed phospho-STAT3 and SFN directly bound STAT3 in patient and PDX samples. Analysis of ALDH+ cells from endocrine-resistant patient samples revealed activation of STAT3 target genes MUC1 and OSMR, which were inhibited by SFX-01 in patient samples. Increased expression of these genes after 3 months' endocrine treatment of ER+ patients (n = 68) predicted poor prognosis. Our data establish the importance of STAT3 signaling in CSC-mediated resistance to endocrine therapy and the potential of SFX-01 for improving clinical outcomes in ER+ breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3030426086,"RAB7 is a small GTPase that belongs to the Rab family, and as a vesicle trafficking factor it is shown to regulate the transport to late endocytic compartments, autophagosome maturation and organelle function. In present study, we showed the critical roles of RAB7 GTPase on actin dynamics and mitochondria function in oocyte meiosis. RAB7 mainly accumulated at cortex and spindle periphery during oocyte maturation. RAB7 depletion caused the failure of polar body extrusion and asymmetric division, and Rab7 exogenous mRNA supplement could rescue the defects caused by RAB7 RNAi. Based on mass spectrometry analysis, we found that RAB7 associated with several actin nucleation factors and mitochondria-related proteins in oocytes. The depletion of RAB7 caused the decrease of actin dynamics, which further affected meiotic spindle migration to the oocyte cortex. In addition, we found that RAB7 could maintain mitochondrial membrane potential and the mitochondrial distribution in mouse oocytes, and this might be due to its effects on the phosphorylation of DRP1 at Ser616 domain. Taken together, our data indicated that RAB7 transported actin nucleation factor for actin polarization, which further affected the phosphorylation of DRP1 for mitochondria dynamics and the meiotic spindle migration in mouse oocytes."
https://openalex.org/W3029129503,"One of the long-standing holy grails of molecular evolution has been the ability to predict an organism's fitness directly from its genotype. With such predictive abilities in hand, researchers would be able to more accurately forecast how organisms will evolve and how proteins with novel functions could be engineered, leading to revolutionary advances in medicine and biotechnology. In this work, we assemble the largest reported set of experimental TEM-1 β-lactamase folding free energies and use this data in conjunction with previously acquired fitness data and computational free energy predictions to determine how much of the fitness of β-lactamase can be directly predicted by thermodynamic folding and binding free energies. We focus upon β-lactamase because of its long history as a model enzyme and its central role in antibiotic resistance. Based upon a set of 21 β-lactamase single and double mutants expressly designed to influence protein folding, we first demonstrate that modeling software designed to compute folding free energies such as FoldX and PyRosetta can meaningfully, although not perfectly, predict the experimental folding free energies of single mutants. Interestingly, while these techniques also yield sensible double mutant free energies, we show that they do so for the wrong physical reasons. We then go on to assess how well both experimental and computational folding free energies explain single mutant fitness. We find that folding free energies account for, at most, 24% of the variance in β-lactamase fitness values according to linear models and, somewhat surprisingly, complementing folding free energies with computationally-predicted binding free energies of residues near the active site only increases the folding-only figure by a few percent. This strongly suggests that the majority of β-lactamase's fitness is controlled by factors other than free energies. Overall, our results shed a bright light on to what extent the community is justified in using thermodynamic measures to infer protein fitness as well as how applicable modern computational techniques for predicting free energies will be to the large data sets of multiply-mutated proteins forthcoming."
https://openalex.org/W3032337795,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia with very limited therapeutic options. Amyloid β (Aβ) and phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau) are key pathogenic molecules in AD. P38α-MAPK is specifically activated in AD lesion sites. However, its effects on AD pathogenesis, especially on p-Tau-associated brain pathology, and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We mated human APP-transgenic mice and human P301S Tau-transgenic mice with mapk14-floxed and neuron-specific Cre-knock-in mice. We observed that deletion of p38α-MAPK specifically in neurons improves the cognitive function of both 9-month-old APP and Tau-transgenic AD mice, which is associated with decreased Aβ and p-Tau load in the brain. We further used next-generation sequencing to analyze the gene transcription in brains of p38α-MAPK deficient and wild-type APP-transgenic mice, which indicated that deletion of p38α-MAPK regulates the transcription of calcium homeostasis-related genes, especially downregulates the expression of grin2a, a gene encoding NMDAR subunit NR2A. Cell culture experiments further verified that deletion of p38α-MAPK inhibits NMDA-triggered calcium influx and neuronal apoptosis. Our systemic studies of AD pathogenic mechanisms using both APP- and Tau-transgenic mice suggested that deletion of neuronal p38α-MAPK attenuates AD-associated brain pathology and protects neurons in AD pathogenesis. This study supports p38α-MAPK as a novel target for AD therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3030015770,"Background Host immune responses during late-onset sepsis (LOS) in very preterm infants are poorly characterised due to a complex and dynamic pathophysiology and challenges in working with small available blood volumes. We present here an unbiased transcriptomic analysis of whole peripheral blood from very preterm infants at the time of LOS. Methods RNA-Seq was performed on peripheral blood samples (6–29 days postnatal age) taken at the time of suspected LOS from very preterm infants <30 weeks gestational age. Infants were classified based on blood culture positivity and elevated C-reactive protein concentrations as having confirmed LOS (n = 5), possible LOS (n = 4) or no LOS (n = 9). Bioinformatics and statistical analyses performed included pathway over-representation and protein-protein interaction network analyses. Plasma cytokine immunoassays were performed to validate differentially expressed cytokine pathways. Results The blood leukocyte transcriptional responses of infants with confirmed LOS differed significantly from infants without LOS (1,317 differentially expressed genes). However, infants with possible LOS could not be distinguished from infants with no LOS or confirmed LOS. Transcriptional alterations associated with LOS included genes involved in pathogen recognition (mainly TLR pathways), cytokine signalling (both pro-inflammatory and inhibitory responses), immune and haematological regulation (including cell death pathways), and metabolism (altered cholesterol biosynthesis). At the transcriptional-level cytokine responses during LOS were characterised by over-representation of IFN-α/β, IFN-γ, IL-1 and IL-6 signalling pathways and up-regulation of genes for inflammatory responses. Infants with confirmed LOS had significantly higher levels of IL-1α and IL-6 in their plasma. Conclusions Blood responses in very preterm infants with LOS are characterised by altered host immune responses that appear to reflect unbalanced immuno-metabolic homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W3030427556,"In vitro mouse spermatogenesis using a classical organ culture method became possible by supplementing basal culture medium with only the product of bovine serum albumin purified by chromatography (AlbuMAX), which indicated that AlbuMAX contained every chemical factor necessary for mouse spermatogenesis. However, since the identity of these factors was unclear, improvements in culture media and our understanding of the nutritional and signal substances required for spermatogenesis were hindered. In the present study, chemically defined media (CDM) without AlbuMAX was used to evaluate each supplementary factor and their combinations for the induction of spermatogenesis. Similar to in vivo conditions, retinoic acid, triiodothyronine (T3), and testosterone (T) were needed. Based on differences in spermatogenic competence between AlbuMAX, fetal bovine serum, and adult bovine serum, we identified α-tocopherol, which strongly promoted spermatogenesis when combined with ascorbic acid and glutathione. Differences were also observed in the abilities of lipids extracted from AlbuMAX using two different methods to induce spermatogenesis. This led to the identification of lysophospholipids, particularly lysophosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidic acid, and lysophosphatidylserine, as important molecules for spermatogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W3031425929,"The generation of laminated and light responsive retinal organoids from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provides a powerful tool for the study of retinal diseases and drug discovery and a robust platform for cell-based therapies. The aim of this study is to investigate whether retinal organoids can retain their morphological and functional characteristics upon storage at room temperature (RT) conditions and shipment by air using a commercially available container that maintains the environment at ambient temperature. Morphological analysis and measurements of neuroepithelial thickness revealed no differences between control, RT incubated and shipped organoids. Similarly immunohistochemical analysis showed no differences in cell type composition and position within the laminated retinal structure. All groups showed a similar response to light, suggesting that the biological function of retinal organoids was not affected by RT storage or shipment. These findings provide an advance in transport of ready-made retinal organoids, increasing their availability to many research and pharma labs worldwide and facilitating cross-collaborative research."
https://openalex.org/W3031084564,"This study addresses the modifications that future climate conditions could impose on the transmission cycles of Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. by the tick Ixodes ricinus in Europe. Tracking the distribution of foci of a zoonotic agent transmitted by vectors as climate change shapes its spatial niche is necessary to issue self-protection measures for the human population. We modeled the current distribution of the tick and its predicted contact rates with 18 species of vertebrates known to act as reservoirs of the pathogen. We approached an innovative way for estimating the possibility of permanent foci of Borrelia afzelii or Borrelia garinii tracking separately the expected spatial overlap among ticks and reservoirs for these pathogens in Europe. Environmental traits were obtained from MODIS satellite images for the years 2002–2017 (baseline) and projected on scenarios for the years 2030 and 2050. The ratio between MODIS baseline/current interpolated climatologies (WorldClim), and the ratio between MODIS-projected year 2050 with five climate change scenarios for that year (WorldClim) revealed no significant differences, meaning that projections from MODIS are reliable. Models predict that contact rates between the tick and reservoirs of either B. garinii or B. afzelii are spatially different because those have different habitats overlap. This is expected to promote different distribution patterns because of the different responses of both groups of reservoirs to environmental variables. Models for 2030 predict an increase in latitude, mainly in the circulation of B. garinii, with large areas of expected permanent contact between vector and reservoirs in Nordic countries and central Europe. However, climate projections for the year 2050 predict an unexpected scenario of contact disruption. Though large areas in Europe would be suitable for circulation of the pathogens, the predicted lack of niche overlap among ticks and reservoirs could promote a decrease in permanent foci. This development represents a proof-of-concept for the power of jointly modeling both the vector and reservoirs in a common framework. A deeper understanding of the unanticipated result regarding the year 2050 is needed."
https://openalex.org/W3032327959,"Alagille syndrome patients present with loss of function mutations in either JAG1 or NOTCH2. About 40%-50% of patients have kidney abnormalities, and frequently display multicystic, dysplastic kidneys. Additionally, gain-of-function mutations in NOTCH2 are associated with cystic kidneys in Hajdu-Cheney syndrome patients. How perturbations in Notch signaling cause renal tubular cysts remains unclear. Here, we have determined that reduced Notch signaling mediated transcription by ectopic expression of dominant-negative mastermind-like (dnMaml) peptide in the nephrogenic epithelia from after the s-shaped body formation and in the developing collecting ducts results in proximal tubular and collecting duct cysts, respectively. An acute inhibition of Notch signaling for two days during kidney development is sufficient to disrupt tubule formation, and significantly increases Akap12 expression. Ectopic expression of Akap12 in renal epithelia results in abnormally long primary cilia similar to that observed in Notch-signaling-deficient epithelia. Both loss of Notch signaling and elevated Akap12 expression disrupt the ability of renal epithelial cells to form spherical structures with a single lumen when grown embedded in matrix. Interestingly, Akap12 can inhibit Notch signaling mediated transcription, which likely explains how both loss of Notch signaling and ectopic expression of Akap12 result in similar renal epithelial abnormalities. We conclude that Notch signaling regulates Akap12 expression while also ensuring normal primary cilia length and renal epithelial morphogenesis, and suggest that one aspect of diseases associated with defective Notch signaling, such as Alagille syndrome, maybe mechanistically related to ciliopathies."
https://openalex.org/W3030043654,"Abstract The epigenetic environment plays an important role in DNA damage recognition and repair, both at DNA double-strand breaks and at deprotected telomeres. To increase understanding on how DNA damage responses (DDR) at deprotected telomeres are regulated by modification and remodeling of telomeric chromatin we screened 38 methyltransferases for their ability to promote telomere dysfunction-induced genomic instability. As top hit we identified MMSET, a histone methyltransferase (HMT) causally linked to multiple myeloma and Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome. We show that MMSET promotes non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) at deprotected telomeres through Ligase4-dependent classical NHEJ, and does not contribute to Ligase3-dependent alternative NHEJ. Moreover, we show that this is dependent on the catalytic activity of MMSET, enabled by its SET-domain. Indeed, in absence of MMSET H3K36-dimethylation (H3K36me2) decreases, both globally and at subtelomeric regions. Interestingly, the level of MMSET-dependent H3K36me2 directly correlates with NHEJ-efficiency. We show that MMSET depletion does not impact on recognition of deprotected telomeres by the DDR-machinery or on subsequent recruitment of DDR-factors acting upstream or at the level of DNA repair pathway choice. Our data are most consistent with an important role for H3K36me2 in more downstream steps of the DNA repair process. Moreover, we find additional H3K36me2-specific HMTs to contribute to NHEJ at deprotected telomeres, further emphasizing the importance of H3K36me2 in DNA repair."

Results from previous studies support that CD40 protein expression is elevated in Müller glia of diabetic mice; however, the mechanisms responsible for this increase have not been explored. Here, we evaluated the hypothesis that diabetes augments translation of the Cd40 mRNA. Mice receiving thiamet G (TMG), an inhibitor of the O-GlcNAc hydrolase O-GlcNAcase, exhibited enhanced retinal protein O-GlcNAcylation and increased Cd40 mRNA translation. TMG administration also promoted Cd40 mRNA association with Müller cell–specific ribosomes isolated from the retina of RiboTag mice. Similar effects on O-GlcNAcylation and Cd40 mRNA translation were also observed in the retina of a mouse model of type 1 diabetes. In cultured cells, TMG promoted sequestration of the cap-binding protein eIF4E (eukaryotic translation in initiation factor 4E) by 4E-BP1 (eIF4E-binding protein 1) and enhanced cap-independent Cd40 mRNA translation as assessed by a bicistronic reporter that contained the 5′-UTR of the Cd40 mRNA. Ablation of 4E-BP1/2 prevented the increase in Cd40 mRNA translation in TMG-exposed cells, and expression of a 4E-BP1 variant that constitutively sequesters eIF4E promoted reporter activity. Extending on the cell culture results, we found that in contrast to WT mice, diabetic 4E-BP1/2–deficient mice did not exhibit enhanced retinal Cd40 mRNA translation and failed to up-regulate expression of the inflammatory marker nitric-oxide synthase 2.

The conventional view of retinal inflammation is that microglia are the first responders that initiate Müller cell activation and gliosis (4Wang M. Wong W.T.

Protein O-GlcNAcylation occurs via the addition of the O-GlcNAc donor UDP-GlcNAc to the hydroxyl side chain of serine and threonine residues. Enzymatic addition of the O-GlcNAc moiety is catalyzed by O-GlcNAc transferase, whereas the modification is removed by the hydrolase O-GlcNAcase.

Recently, we demonstrated that augmented O-GlcNAcylation causes widespread variation in retinal gene expression at the level of mRNA translation (27Dierschke S.K. Miller W.P. Favate J.S. Shah P.

In that study, the top canonical pathway identified as being translationally altered by enhanced O-GlcNAcylation was the “acute-phase response,” which is a complex early-defense system involving a range of proinflammatory cytokines. Here, we explored Cd40 as one gene candidate subject to translational regulation in retina. The rate at which an mRNA is translated is generally limited by the recruitment of ribosomes, which can occur through either a cap-dependent or cap-independent mechanism. All eukaryotic mRNAs contain a 5′-m7GTP cap structure that is recognized by the cap-binding protein eIF4E (28Pestova T.V. Kolupaeva V.G. Lomakin I.B. Pilipenko E.V. Shatsky I.N. Agol V.I. Hellen C.U. Molecular mechanisms of translation initiation in eukaryotes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98 (11416183): 7029-703610.1073/pnas.111145798Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Cap-dependent recruitment of a ribosome onto an mRNA occurs via assembly of the eIF4F complex (that includes eIF4E) at the 5′-cap, followed by binding of eIF4F·mRNA to the 40S ribosomal subunit (28Pestova T.V. Kolupaeva V.G. Lomakin I.B. Pilipenko E.V. Shatsky I.N. Agol V.I. Hellen C.U. Molecular mechanisms of translation initiation in eukaryotes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Sequestration of eIF4E by the translational repressor 4E-BP1 prevents eIF4F complex assembly and represents the best-characterized mechanism for repressing cap-dependent translation initiation. As an alternative to cap-dependent translation, ∼10% of mRNAs contain sequence elements that enable translation to be initiated independent of the 5′-cap (29López-Lastra M. Rivas A. Barría M.I. Protein synthesis in eukaryotes: the growing biological relevance of cap-independent translation initiation.Biol. Res. 2005; 38 (16238092): 121-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These sequence elements are not conserved between genes; however, a common feature is the formation of hairpin, or stem-loop, secondary structures. Highly structured elements in the 5′-UTR of messages are thought to enable translation under physiological duress when cap-dependent translation is inhibited, such as during exposure to diabetes-induced hyperglycemia (30Holcik M. Sonenberg N. Korneluk R.G. Internal ribosome initiation of translation and the control of cell death.Trends Genet. 2000; 16 (11050335): 469-47310.1016/S0168-9525(00)02106-5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 31Dennis M.D. Shenberger J.S.

A number of cell surface receptors are subject to translational regulation and variation in receptor expression often reflects changes in downstream signaling (32Giraud S. Greco A. Brink M. Diaz J.J.

In this study, we evaluated the hypothesis that diabetes enhances translation of the Cd40 mRNA. Overall, the findings demonstrate that protein O-GlcNAcylation promotes cap-independent Cd40 mRNA translation via a 4E-BP1/2–dependent mechanism that involves sequences within its 5′-UTR. We previously evaluated the impact of O-GlcNAcase inhibition on retinal gene expression using next-generation sequencing to assess changes in mRNA abundance and ribosome-bound mRNAs undergoing translation via RNA-Seq and ribosome profiling (i.e. Ribo-Seq), respectively (27Dierschke S.K.

Dennis M.D. O-GlcNAcylation alters the selection of mRNAs for translation and promotes 4E-BP1-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction in the retina.J. Biol.

Cd40 was identified as a candidate gene that exhibited enhanced mRNA translation in the retina of mice administered TMG as compared with PBS vehicle alone (Fig. 1A). As with the previous report (27Dierschke S.K. Miller W.P. Favate J.S. Shah P. Imamura Kawasawa Y. Salzberg A.C. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Dennis M.D. O-GlcNAcylation alters the selection of mRNAs for translation and promotes 4E-BP1-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction in the retina.J. Biol.

Consistent with the results of ribosome profiling, Cd40 mRNA abundance was not altered in whole retinal lysates from mice administered TMG as compared with PBS (Fig. 1C). Sucrose density gradient centrifugation was used to separate retinal ribosomes into either heavy or light fractions (Fig. 1D). Poorly translated mRNAs are found in the light subpolysomal fraction, which contains both 80S monosomes, as well as individual 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits. In contrast, actively translating mRNAs associate with multiple ribosomes and form heavy polysomes. Consistent with sequencing results in Fig. 1A, the Cd40 mRNA was shifted into the heavy fraction obtained from the retina of mice administered TMG, as compared with PBS (Fig. 1E). In addition to up-regulation of Cd40 mRNA translation, mRNAs predicted by the sequencing analysis to exhibit down-regulation (Nfe2l2 and Lhx1) or no change (Nqo1) were also distributed in polysome profiles in a way that supported those observations (Fig. 1F). To assess whether Cd40 mRNA translation was enhanced in a model of diabetes, we generated polysome profiles from the retina of streptozotocin (STZ)–induced diabetic mice, a model of type 1 diabetes. Consistent with previous studies (11Kim S.J. Yoo W.S. Choi M. Chung I. Yoo J.M. Choi W.S. Increased O-GlcNAcylation of NF-κB enhances retinal ganglion cell death in streptozotocin-induced diabetic retinopathy.Curr. Eye Res. 2016; 41 (25835259): 249-25710.3109/02713683.2015.1006372Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), blood glucose concentrations were significantly elevated (Fig. 2A) and retinal protein O-GlcNAcylation was enhanced in diabetic mice as compared with nondiabetic controls (Fig. 2B). To determine whether diabetes altered Cd40 transcription, we evaluated Cd40 mRNA abundance. There was no significant change in Cd40 mRNA abundance in the retina of diabetic mice as compared with nondiabetic mice (Fig. 2C). However, the relative distribution of the Cd40 mRNA was shifted into the heavy fraction obtained from the retina of diabetic mice, indicating enhanced translation (Fig. 2D). To specifically assess Cd40 mRNA translation in retinal Müller cells, we developed a RiboTag mouse (33Sanz E. Yang L. Su T. Morris D.R. McKnight G.S. Amieux P.S. Cell-type–specific isolation of ribosome-associated mRNA from complex tissues.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106 (19666516): 13939-1394410.1073/pnas.0907143106Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) that expressed an epitope-tagged ribosomal protein under the control of Cre recombinase that is directed specifically toward retinal Müller cells by promoter/enhancer elements of the Pdgfra gene (34Roesch K. Jadhav A.P. Trimarchi J.M. Stadler M.B. Roska B. Sun B.B. Cepko C.L. The transcriptome of retinal Müller glial cells.J. Comp. Neurol. 2008; 509 (18465787): 225-23810.1002/cne.21730Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). RiboTag mice express a fully functional hemagglutinin (HA)–tagged variant of ribosomal protein L22 (Rpl22), which forms the core of the ribosomal 60S subunit and facilitates cell type–specific isolation of translationally active mRNAs (33Sanz E. Yang L. Su T. Morris D.R. McKnight G.S. Amieux P.S. Cell-type–specific isolation of ribosome-associated mRNA from complex tissues.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106 (19666516): 13939-1394410.1073/pnas.0907143106Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Hemizygous PDGFRa-Cre–positive mice were crossed with RiboTag mice, resulting in deletion of WT exon 4 in Müller cells and replacement with an exon 4 that included an HA tag (Fig. 3A). Replacement of WT exon 4 with the HA-tagged exon 4 was validated by PCR (Fig. 3B). HA-tagged Rpl22 expression was only observed in the retina of Cre-positive mice (Fig. 3C). HA-Rpl22 expression colocalized with the Müller cell–specific marker glutamine synthetase (GS) in retinal cryosections (Fig. 3D). Müller-specific HA-tagged ribosomes were immunoprecipitated from whole retinal lysates (Fig. 3E). HA-Rpl22 was detected in immunoprecipitations targeting the HA tag but not in a FLAG-tag negative control. RNA isolated by immunoprecipitation was high quality (Fig. 3F). The immunoprecipitation efficiently isolated retinal mRNAs encoding Müller cell–specific markers (CRALBP, GS, and AQP4), but not the retinal pigmented epithelium marker RPE65 (Fig. 3G). To evaluate the effect of enhanced O-GlcNAcylation on Cd40 mRNA translation, RiboTag mice were administered TMG. Cd40 mRNA association with HA-tagged ribosomes was enhanced in the retina of mice administered TMG as compared with those administered PBS, indicating up-regulated Cd40 mRNA translation (Fig. 3H). Similarly, STZ-induced diabetes also promoted Cd40 mRNA translation in retinal Müller cells (Fig. 3I). Transcript-specific translational control is generally mediated by cis-regulatory elements encoded by the UTR of the target mRNA. A recent genome-wide systematic screen indicated that sequences within the 5′-UTR of the Cd40 mRNA were capable of promoting translation independent of a 5′ mRNA cap (35Weingarten-Gabbay S. Elias-Kirma S. Nir R. Gritsenko A.A. Stern-Ginossar N. Yakhini Z. Weinberger A. Segal E. Systematic discovery of cap-independent translation sequences in human and viral genomes.Science. 2016; 351 (26816383): aad493910.1126/science.aad4939Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In addition, we previously provided evidence that enhanced O-GlcNAcylation causes a shift from cap-dependent to cap-independent mRNA translation that is mediated by 4E-BP1 (31). To investigate the impact of 4E-BP1 on Cd40 mRNA translation, we established a cell culture model of enhanced O-GlcNAcylation in the presence and absence of 4E-BP1. In both WT and 4E-BP1/2–deficient cells, exposure to TMG enhanced protein O-GlcNAcylation (Fig. 4A). TMG promoted 4E-BP1 coimmunoprecipitation with eIF4E, whereas the protein could not be detected in 4E-BP1/2–deficient cells (Fig. 4, B and C). Mfold web server predicted that the 5′-UTR sequence of Cd40 forms a hairpin structure (Fig. 4D). To specifically evaluate the role of the 5′-UTR of Cd40, it was cloned into a bicistronic reporter (pYIC) wherein a single mRNA encodes both yellow and cyan fluorescent protein (YFP and CFP, respectively). YFP expression was used as a reporter for cap-dependent translation, whereas CFP expression was used as a reporter for cap-independent translation driven by the Cd40 5′-UTR (Fig. 4E). In WT cells, exposure to TMG increased the CFP/YFP expression ratio, whereas there was no change in the ratio of CFP/YFP expression in 4E-BP1/2–deficient cells exposed to TMG (Fig. 4F). We also coexpressed pYIC with a 4E-BP1 F113A variant that resists mTORC1-dependent phosphorylation and therefore constitutively binds eIF4E (36Schalm S.S. Fingar D.C. Sabatini D.M. Blenis J. TOS motif-mediated raptor binding regulates 4E-BP1 multisite phosphorylation and function.Curr. Biol. 2003; 13 (12747827): 797-80610.1016/S0960-9822(03)00329-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) in the human MIO-M1 Müller cell line. As compared with an empty vector, 4E-BP1 F113A increased the CFP/YFP expression ratio (Fig. 4G). These data support a role for 4E-BP1 in promoting Cd40 mRNA translation. To evaluate the role of 4E-BP1 in regulating the translation of the Cd40 mRNA in the retina, diabetes was induced in WT and 4E-BP1/2 knockout mice. Blood glucose concentrations (Fig. 5A) and retinal protein O-GlcNAcylation (Fig. 5B) were significantly elevated in both WT and 4E-BP1/2–deficient diabetic mice as compared with nondiabetic mice. No significant change in total Cd40 mRNA was detected in whole retinal lysates (Fig. 5C). In polysome profiles, the Cd40 mRNA shifted into the heavy fraction obtained from the retina of WT diabetic mice as compared with WT nondiabetic mice (Fig. 5D). However, the distribution of the Cd40 mRNA in the heavy fraction obtained from the retina of 4E-BP1/2–deficient diabetic mice was similar to that observed in 4E-BP1/2–deficient nondiabetic mice (Fig. 5D). Consistent with changes in mRNA translation, CD40 protein expression was increased in the retina of WT STZ-diabetic mice, and 4E-BP1/2 deletion prevented the effect (Fig. 5E). Because CD40 is necessary for the retinal inflammatory response to diabetes, inducible nitric-oxide synthase 2 (Nos2) mRNA abundance was evaluated in retinal lysates as a marker for retinal inflammation. Diabetes enhanced Nos2 expression in the retina of WT mice; however, there was no difference in Nos2 expression in the retina of diabetic and nondiabetic 4E-BP1/2–deficient mice (Fig. 5F). The TNF receptor superfamily member CD40 is a central mediator of inflammation in DR pathology (6Portillo J.A.C. Lopez Corcino Y. Miao Y. Tang J. Sheibani N. Kern T.S. Dubyak G.R. Subauste C.S. CD40 in retinal Müller cells induces P2X7-dependent cytokine expression in macrophages/microglia in diabetic mice and development of early experimental diabetic retinopathy.Diabetes. 2017; 66 (27474370): 483-49310."

Ferulic acid (FA) is found within members of the genus Angelica, reportedly shows protective effects on neuronal damage. However, the protective effects of FA on HIBD remains unclear. In this study, using the Morris water maze task, we herein found that the impairment of spatial memory formation in adult rats exposed to HIBD was significantly reversed by FA treatment and the administration of LNA-miR-9. The expression of miRNA-9 was detected by RT-PCR analyses, and the results shown that miRNA-9 was significantly increased in the hippocampus of neonatal rats following HIBD and in the PC12 cells following hypoxic-ischemic injury, while FA and LNA-miR-9 both inhibited the expression of miRNA-9, suggesting that the therapeutic effect of FA was mainly attributed to the inhibition of miRNA-9 expression. Indeed, the silencing of miR-9 by LNA-miR-9 or FA similarly attenuated neuronal damage and cerebral atrophy in the rat hippocampus after HIBD, which was consistent with the restored expression levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Therefore, our findings indicate that FA treatment may protect against neuronal death through the inhibition of miRNA-9 induction in the rat hippocampus following hypoxic-ischemic damage."

Enrichment of LdHSP78 in infected humans, hamsters, and parasite amastigotes suggested its importance for disease persistence.

Under general as well as inducible environmental stresses, organisms respond by synthesizing a group of chaperons called heat shock proteins (HSPs) (1Li Z. Srivastava P. Heat-shock proteins.Curr. Protoc. Immunol. 2004; (Appendix 1)10.1002/0471142735.ima01ts58PubMed Google Scholar). HSPs facilitate survivability of organisms by assisting in maturation, activation, translocation, and degradation of misfolded nascent proteins (1Li Z. Srivastava P. Heat-shock proteins.Curr. Protoc. Immunol. 2004; (Appendix 1)10.1002/0471142735.ima01ts58PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, for some pathogens like Leishmania donovani, which have a digenetic life cycle, inducible heat stress is a vital part of their biology. They are transmitted from the poikilothermic sand fly gut to the homeothermic mammalian macrophage, which involves a shift in temperature of almost 10 °C. This temperature upshift is a key trigger for the differentiation of Leishmania donovani promastigotes (sand fly stage) to amastigotes (mammalian stage) (2Zilberstein D. Shapira M. The role of pH and temperature in the development of Leishmania parasites.Annu. Rev.

Heat stress unleashed by the macrophage leads to enrichment of various Leishmania HSPs, which determine the pathology of the disease. In cutaneous leishmaniasis, Leishmania major can tolerate heat shock up to 35 °C, which results in tropical skin lesions; in visceral leishmaniasis (VL), L. donovani can sustain temperatures as high as 37–40 °C, which correlates with visceralization of the parasites (3Callahan H.L.

Parasitol. 1996; 84 (8948329): 400-40910.1006/expr.1996.0128Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Besides management of heat stress, protozoan HSPs play a substantial role in virulence. A recent transcriptomic analysis revealed a positive correlation between the Plasmodium HSPs and regulatory interleukin levels in patients with malignant malaria (4Pallavi R. Roy N. Nageshan R.K.

In other organisms, HSPs belonging to the caseinolytic protease B (ClpB) group, like bacterial ClpB (Escherichia coli), yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) HSP104, and plant HSP101, have extraordinary capacity to rescue disaggregated proteins during severe heat stress, which is otherwise lethal for the organisms (5Lee S.

To date, functional study of only one ClpB protein, HSP100 (LmxHSP100), has been reported in Leishmania biology (6Hubel A. Krobitsch S. Horauf A. Clos J. Leishmania major Hsp100 is required chiefly in the mammalian stage of the parasite.Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17 (9315657): 5987-599510.1128/mcb.17.10.5987Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It has been shown that heat-stressed parasites are strongly enriched with LmxHSP100, and LmxHSP100−/− null mutants of L. major are unable to establish infection within murine peritoneal macrophages, as well as BALB/c mice (6Hubel A.

LdHSP100−/− null mutants of L. donovani showed impaired amastigote development, and LdHSP100 is also found to be involved in the transport of exosome-mediated virulence factors during infection (6Hubel A.

A major global challenge for antileishmanial therapy is overcoming chemoresistant and treatment failure cases arising from treatment with the classical antileishmanial agents available on the market, such as antimonial salts, amphotericin B (AmB), miltefosine, and paromomycin (7Ponte-Sucre A.

Recent studies have highlighted protozoan HSPs, such as HSP90 in Plasmodium falciparum and Trypanosoma evansi, as potential drug targets. These factors prompted us to explore the role of LdHSP78 (UniProt code LdBPK_020680), a putative member of the ClpB protease family, as a potential drug target in L. donovani infection. A BLAST search revealed that LdHSP78 expresses a 78-kDa protein orthologous to LmjF27.2630 of L. major and Tb927.2.3030 of Trypanosoma brucei (6Hubel A. Krobitsch S. Horauf A. Clos J.

Significant sequence structural similarity has been observed between LdHSP78 and a ClpB protein from Thermus thermophilus that is composed of an N-terminal domain, two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) (NBD1 and NBD2), and a middle coiled coil domain (MD region) (10Weibezahn J.

The importance of HSP78 for survival of the parasites was assessed by HSP78 knockout generation in L. donovani (LdHSP78+/−) and Leishmania mexicana (LmxHSP78+/−), with the virulence phenotype of LdHSP78+/− parasites being rescued by episomal overexpression of LdHSP78 (resKO). However, the lethality of null mutants (Ld/LmxHSP78−/−) and successful conditional knockout of LdHSP78 generation suggested probable essentiality of the gene for Leishmania, but more experimental validations are awaited. Infectivity and the capacity to suppress the antileishmanial immune responses activated by host macrophages were determined by infecting murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and Syrian golden hamsters with WT, LdHSP78+/−, and resKO parasites. Furthermore, P1,P5-di(adenosine-5′)-pentaphosphate (Ap5A) ammonium salt, a synthetic ATP analog, was identified as a pharmacological inhibitor of LdHSP78 protein. The antileishmanial efficacy of Ap5A was evaluated and compared with that of the generic antileishmanial drug AmB in healthy BMDMs, promastigotes, and amastigotes. Notably, Ap5A induced much less collateral damage to host cells, unlike AmB. Hence, our study reveals LdHSP78 as a potential antileishmanial therapeutic target while identifying its inhibitor, Ap5A, as a promising lead molecule against VL. LdHSP78 is a putative ATP-dependent Clp subunit-containing protein (UniProt code LdBPK_020680). It is encoded by a single exon located at L. donovani chromosome 2 and is highly conserved throughout the Leishmania spp. while being nonorthologous to human proteins (no human orthologs with >20% sequence identity are available). Involvement of HSP78 in VL was initially perceived from semiquantitative PCR of LdHSP78 transcripts from L. donovani-infected BMDMs (Fig. 1A). Moreover, enrichment of the same was detected in the peripheral blood, spleen, and liver of 3-month-infected golden Syrian hamsters (Fig. 1B). A study conducted with a small cohort of VL patient blood samples correlated with the mRNA expression profile of animals (Fig. 1B). To establish chaperone-like properties of LdHSP78, we mimicked the host phagosomal microenvironment by growing L. donovani promastigotes in M199 (pH 4.0 and pH 5.5) at 37 °C under axenic conditions. Almost 40–55-fold higher expression of LdHSP78 mRNA was obtained at pH 5.5 and 37 °C, compared with that obtained at pH 7.0 and 22 °C (Fig. 1C). These data collectively indicated that HSP78 levels were higher not only during physiological stress of the parasites but also under VL conditions. LdHSP78 knockout parasite cell lines were generated using both a flanking UTR-based multifragment ligation strategy (Fig. S1A) and the CRISPR-Cas9 technique (Fig. S1N). For UTR-mediated knockout generation, 5′ (997 bp) and 3′ (946 bp) flanking regions (UTRs) of LdHSP78 were directionally cloned (Fig. S1, A and B) at both sides of the hygromycin (HYG) (3245 bp) and puromycin (PUR) (3005 bp) cassettes, using specialized primers that incorporated overhangs with unique SfiI digestion sites at each fragment end (Fig. S1, D and E). The PacI-digested linearized 5397-bp HYG construct was transfected in log-phase parasites for generation of heterozygous knockouts (Fig. S1E). A separate population of WT parasites was maintained as mock-transfected cells (transfected with empty vector). LdHSP78-HYG (LdHSP78+/−) cells were cultured in 50 μg/ml HYG-supplemented M199. Next, pure LdHSP78+/− clones were collected by isolating single colonies from the serially diluted LdHSP78+/− cells grown on HYG-supplemented M199 agar. Genomic DNA was isolated from log-phase WT and LdHSP78+/− promastigotes, and PCR was performed using primers spanning the flanking region to the ORFs of HSP78 and HYG (Table S1, primers 5–8). The presence of both HSP78 and HYG in genomic DNA of LdHSP78+/− parasites suggested successful partial replacement of one LdHSP78 allele with the HYG cassette (Fig. 1D). The 5′ UTR (997 bp) and 3′ UTR (946 bp) flanking regions, which had been chosen for knockout generation, were scanned against all 36 chromosomes of L. donovani. Sequence identity and coverage match of 100% were obtained only at chromosome 2 loci flanking the HSP78 gene (Fig. S1H), and no sequence overlap with other chromosomes was observed, confirming the least off-target effect and high efficacy of the flanking region-mediated deletion technique. LdHSP78 was overexpressed in LdHSP78+/− cell lines (resKO cell lines) by cloning the episomal vector pXG-GFP(+) (generously provided by Stephen Beverly, Washington University) at the BamHI and EcoRV sites (Fig. S1, I–L). L. donovani is a diploid organism; therefore, to completely deplete LdHSP78, two drug cassettes (HYG and PUR) were transfected successively. PacI-digested linearized 5397-bp HYG (Fig. S1E) and 4974-bp PAC (Fig. S1F) cassettes were serially transfected in log-phase parasites for generation of null mutants. Attempts were made to culture LdHSP78-HYG/PAC (LdHSP78−/−) cells in 50 μg/ml HYG- and 20 μg/ml PUR-supplemented medium. However, live parasite counts confirmed that null mutants started dying with days of culturing. Our multiple attempts to obtain live parasites from HYG- and PUR-supplemented M199 medium failed probably due to the essential nature of the LdHSP78 gene for the promastigotes. Parasites bearing an extrachromosomal copy of genes generally allow deletion of the chromosomal copies of essential genes. Therefore, promastigotes were transfected with the pXG-HSP78 episome (pXG-GFP-HSP78-Neo+) to maintain an extra copy of genes, followed by double deletion of the chromosomal copies using HYG and PUR cassettes. The conditional knockout (cond KO- LdHSP78−/−epiHSP78) cells were maintained in the presence of HYG, neomycin (NEO), and PUR drug selection medium for 15 days, followed by depletion of NEO from the medium. Interestingly, we found that, despite NEO selection withdrawal (required for pXG-HSP78 maintenance), cells still grew well and, following 7 days of culture, we isolated genomic DNA. LdHSP78, HYG, NEO, and PUR drug cassettes were PCR amplified. For amplification of HSP78 and NEO genes, primers were designed against their respective ORF regions; for HYG and PUR cassettes, amplification primers spanning the 5′ flanking region of the HSP78 gene and the respective drug ORF regions were designed (Table S1, primers 43–50). PCR data indicated that, in the absence of episomal NEO, LdHSP78−/− cells are holding back the extrachromosomal copy of LdHSP78 for their survival (Fig. S1M). We also attempted to design null mutants of LmxHSP78 using the CRISPR-Cas9 system (in silico analysis showed >98% sequence homology of LdHSP78 to LmHSP78) in Cas9-positive L. mexicana cell lines (generously provided by Jeremy Mottram’s laboratory) (Fig. S1N), which indicated that a HSP78 null mutation is probably lethal in L. mexicana. In this model also, only heterozygous parasites survived in the presence of blasticidin (50 μg/ml) (Fig. S1O). Genomic DNA PCR showed successful replacement of one LmHSP78 allele with the blasticidin cassette (Fig. S1P). Western blot analysis depicted significant reduction of LmHSP78 in heterozygous cell lines, compared with WT cell lines (Fig. S1Q). These findings indicated that HSP78 might be essential for survival of the parasite, although more experimental validations are required to confirm this. Chaperone-like activity of HSP78 was already indicated from its enrichment during pH and heat stress in L. donovani promastigotes (Fig. 1C). Physical fitness of WT, LdHSP78+/−, and resKO promastigotes was studied initially at 22 °C, which indicated equivalent growth rates for all three cell lines at day 5 (Fig. 1E). Subsequently, it was found that, at pH 5.5 and 37 °C, the growth rate of LdHSP78+/− parasites was reduced significantly, denoting the role of HSP78 in pH and heat stress management (Fig. 1F). Quantitative expression of LdHSP78 mRNA obtained from promastigotes indicated ∼80% reduction of the mRNA in LdHSP78+/− promastigotes and almost 95% restoration of mRNA in resKO promastigotes (Fig. 1G). Analysis of LdHSP78 mRNA levels from BMDMs infected with WT, LdHSP78+/−, and resKO parasites also depicted a similar profile of LdHSP78 transcripts in LdHSP78+/− amastigotes (Fig. 1H). This was accompanied by a significant drop in the parasite burden at 24 h and 48 h postinfection in LdHSP78+/− parasite-infected BMDMs (Fig. 1I). We successfully reestablished the virulence of LdHSP78+/− parasites by episomal overexpression of LdHSP78. Complete restoration of LdHSP78 mRNA was found in resKO parasite-infected BMDMs (Fig. 1H). Investigation of the infection index of resKO parasites in BMDMs also corroborated with mRNA data, establishing the significance of LdHSP78 for infection in vitro (Fig. 1I). The most immunodominant peptide (127 amino acids; indicated in purple in Fig. S2A) of LdHSP78 was codon optimized and subcloned from pGEX-6P.1-Amp+ to the pET41a-Kan+ vector (Fig. S2, B–D). The hydrophobicity of the peptide was analyzed using a hydropathy plot, which indicated that the peptide sequence chosen is enriched with hydrophilic amino acids and ideal as a B-cell epitope (Fig. S2E). The epitope was then overexpressed and purified in the native form using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin, and BALB/c mice were immunized with it (Fig. S2, F–H). Sera collected after three boosters were used for immunoblotting of the purified epitope, to analyze the quality of the generated antibody (Fig. S2I). Thereafter, partial depletion of LdHSP78 and LmHSP78 (previously mentioned) was validated by Western blotting from parasite lysates obtained from promastigote cell lines generated using flanking UTR-mediated and CRISPR-Cas9–mediated knockout technologies, respectively. Almost 50% or more depletion of HSP78 protein was obtained in LmHSP78 (Fig. S2Q) and LdHSP78+/−, while complete restoration of LdHSP78 protein was achieved in resKO parasites (Fig. 1, J and K). The specificity of anti-HSP78 antibody was cross-validated using BMDM lysate, and no immunoreactive band was obtained (Fig. 1, J and K). One of the major issues with antileishmanial therapy is overcoming immunosuppression induced by parasites. Our next question was whether partial depletion of LdHSP78 would result in inability of parasites to overcome host immune activation. Significant down-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines and up-regulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines were observed in WT parasite-infected BMDMs. In contrast, in LdHSP78+/− parasite-infected macrophages, mRNA and protein levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) (Fig. 2, A and E), IL10 (Fig. 2, B and F), and IL27A (Fig. 2, C and G), were significantly depleted, whereas IL12A (Fig. 2, D and H) was significantly enriched. Thus, cytokine profiling revealed that proinflammatory cytokines were significantly inhibited during LdHSP78+/− parasite infection. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) are the two major MAPKs that are involved in the regulation of cytokine profiles and NO synthesis (12Chio C.C. Chang Y.H. Hsu Y.W. Chi K.H. Lin W.W. PKA-dependent activation of PKC, p38 MAPK and IKK in macrophage: implication in the induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase and interleukin-6 by dibutyryl cAMP.Cell. Signal. 2004; 16 (14751542): 565-57510.1016/j.cellsig.2003.10.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These MAPKs require phosphorylation at their specific amino acids for their activation. Infection with WT parasites induced significant up-regulation of phospho-ERK1/2 (p-p44/p42, Thr202/Tyr204) (Fig. 3, A and E) and decreased levels of phospho-p38 (Thr180/Tyr182) (Fig. 3, B and F), while total MAPK expression levels remain constant. In contrast, reverse activation profiles of these proteins were found in LdHSP78+/− parasite-infected macrophages (Fig. 3). Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 leads to enrichment of arginase 1 levels, which helps in parasite survival, whereas phospho-p38 MAPK leads to enrichment of inducible NOS (iNOS) expression, which mediates clearance of parasites by generation of NO (13Stempin C.C. Dulgerian L.R. Garrido V.V. Cerban F.M. Arginase in parasitic infections: macrophage activation, immunosuppression, and intracellular signals.J. Biomed. Biotechnol. 2010; 2010 (20029630): 68348510.1155/2010/683485Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the levels of iNOS and arginase 1 expression, which suggested that LdHSP78+/− parasites were unable to exhaust iNOS and to enhance arginase 1 expression (Fig. 3, C, D, G, and H). Significant amounts of NO generation were obtained from BMDMs infected with the mutant parasites, compared with the WT ones (Fig. 3I). After overexpression of LdHSP78 in resKO parasites, the immunosuppressive nature of parasites was significantly restored, with concomitant suppression of phospho-p38, iNOS and NO generation. Golden Syrian hamsters are a well-established model that successfully mimics the pathophysiology of human VL infection (14Melby P.C. Chandrasekar B. Zhao W. Coe J.E. The hamster as a model of human visceral leishmaniasis: progressive disease and impaired generation of nitric oxide in the face of a prominent Th1-like cytokine response.J.

Animal models for the study of leishmaniasis immunology.Rev. Inst. Med. Trop. Sao Paulo. 2014; 56 (24553602): 1-1110.1590/S0036-46652014000100001Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Before infecting animals, the percentages of infective metacyclic promastigotes were determined in all of the parasite cultures by lipophosphoglycan-independent Ficoll density gradient analysis using 10–40% Ficoll gradients (Fig. S3A). Phase-contrast microscopy showed that >60% of metacyclics were present in 6–9-day stationary-phase promastigotes of WT, LdHSP78+/−, and resKO parasites (Fig. S3B). RT-PCR expression of the L. donovani SHERPIN gene revealed comparable amounts of successful metacyclic formation (Fig. S3C). Thus, we ensured that all of the following infections were carried out with stationary-phase metacyclic parasites only. To understand the role of LdHSP78 in animal infection, we first assessed the pathophysiological symptoms of the hamsters infected with three different groups of parasites, up to 3 months postinfection. Similar to infected humans, VL, WT, and resKO parasite-infected hamsters exhibited progressive splenomegaly and hepatomegaly, with high amastigote burdens in organ smears (Fig. 4A and Table S2). In LdHSP78+/− parasite-infected hamsters, splenic and hepatic lesion formation was delayed significantly, with lower amastigote burdens in spleen and liver stamp smears (Fig. 4A and Table S2). Leishman Donovan unit data indicated that infection with WT and resKO parasites resulted in almost 20-fold greater splenic macrophage parasite loads and 25-fold greater hepatic macrophage parasite loads, compared with LdHSP78+/− parasite infection (Fig. 4B). Since detection of live parasites in the organs provides a better depiction of disease severity and the virulence of parasites, limiting dilution assays (LDAs) with 1 mg/ml minced spleen and liver tissues were performed for animals infected with three different cell lines. LDA data indicated severe declines in parasite burdens, from 1010 WT parasites to 103 LdHSP78+/− parasites in spleen and from 1015 WT parasites to 104 LdHSP78+/− parasites in liver 12 weeks postinfection (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, in resKO parasite-infected animals, there was almost complete restoration of LDA results in both spleen and liver, indicating that LdHSP78 overexpression restored virulence of the LdHSP78+/− parasites significantly (Fig. 4C). Decreased fitness of LdHSP78+/− parasites within hamsters could be confirmed by highly sensitive kinetoplastidial DNA (kDNA)-dependent determination of parasite counts in peripheral blood, spleen, and liver. Parasites were serially diluted from 105 parasites/ml to 1 parasite/ml, and a kDNA standard curve was prepared following a method mentioned elsewhere (Fig. 4D) (16Bhattacharya P. Ghosh S. Ejazi S.A. Rahaman M. Pandey K. Ravi Das V.N. Das P. Goswami R.P. Saha B. Ali N.

Dis. 2016; 10 (26829554): e000442210.1371/journal.pntd.0004422Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA isolated from hamster peripheral blood, spleen, and liver were then subjected to RT-PCR for kDNA amplification. Based on kDNA Ct values obtained from organs, almost 10 ± 2 parasites/ml WT parasites, 2 ± 1 parasites/ml LdHSP78+/− parasites, and 15 ± 2 parasites/ml resKO parasites in animal blood were obtained (Fig. 4E). Moreover, parasite loads in LdHSP78+/− parasite-infected organs were much lower than those in WT and resKO parasite-infected animals (Fig. 4E and Table S3). Subsequently, RT-PCR data for LdHSP78 mRNA from blood and organs of WT, LdHSP78+/−, and resKO parasite-infected animals depicted almost 5-fold (in blood), 10-fold (in spleen), and 4.5-fold (in liver) reductions during LdHSP78+/− parasite infection, compared with WT and resKO parasite infections (Fig. 4F). The fold changes indicated that the proliferation rate of parasites was significantly compromised in hamsters after partial deletion of LdHSP78. Establishment of VL in hamsters largely depends on the fine balance between Th1 and Th2 responses in spleen (17Medina-Colorado A.A. Osorio E.Y. Saldarriaga O.A. Travi B.L. Kong F. Spratt H. Soong L.

https://openalex.org/W3028985765,"The myeloproliferative neoplasms, polycythemia vera, essential thrombocytosis and primary myelofibrosis are hematopoietic stem cell disorders and share driver mutations that either directly activate the thrombopoietin receptor, MPL, or activate it indirectly through gain-of-function mutations in the gene for JAK2, its cognate tyrosine kinase. Paradoxically, MPL surface expression in hematopoietic stem cells is also reduced in the myeloproliferative neoplasms due to abnormal post-translational glycosylation and premature destruction of JAK2, suggesting that the myeloproliferative neoplasms are disorders of MPL processing since MPL is the only hematopoietic growth factor receptor in hematopoietic stem cells. To examine this possibility, we genetically manipulated MPL expression and maturation in a JAK2V617F transgenic mouse model of polycythemia vera. Elimination of MPL expression completely abrogated the polycythemia vera phenotype in this JAK2V617F transgenic mouse model, which could only be partially restored by expression of one MPL allele. Most importantly, elimination of thrombopoietin gene expression abrogated the polycythemia vera phenotype in this JAK2V617F transgenic mouse model, which could be completely restored by expression of a single thrombopoietin allele. These data indicate that polycythemia vera is in part a thrombopoietin-dependent disorder and that targeting the MPL-thrombopoietin axis could be an effective, nonmyelotoxic therapeutic strategy in this disorder."

It induces metabolic syndrome-related alterations, which are partially reversed by leptin supplementation during lactation. We employed these conditions to identify transcript-based nutrient sensitive biomarkers in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) predictive of later adverse metabolic health. The best candidate was validated in humans. Transcriptome analysis of PBMCs from adult male Wistar rats of three experimental groups was performed: offspring of control dams (CON), and offspring of 20% calorie-restricted dams during gestation without (CR) and with leptin supplementation throughout lactation (CR-LEP). The expression of 401 genes was affected by gestational calorie restriction and reversed by leptin. The changes preceded metabolic syndrome-related phenotypic alterations. Of these genes, Npc1 mRNA levels were lower in CR vs CON, and normalized to CON in CR-LEP. In humans, NPC1 mRNA levels in peripheral blood cells (PBCs) were decreased in subjects with mildly impaired metabolic health compared to healthy subjects. Therefore, a set of potential transcript-based biomarkers indicative of a predisposition to metabolic syndrome-related alterations were identified, including NPC1, which was validated in humans. Low NPC1 transcript levels in PBCs are a candidate biomarker of increased risk for impaired metabolic health in humans."

Lipoproteins perform a wide variety of functions at the membrane surface, including in the capture of nutrients, in adhesion, and as structural components of the cell envelope. Preprolipoproteins are exported from the cytoplasm and post-translationally modified by lipoprotein diacylglycerol transferase (Lgt) with a diacylglycerol moiety from a neighboring glycerophospholipid (Fig. 1) (7Sankaran K. Wu H.C. Lipid modification of bacterial prolipoprotein: transfer of diacylglyceryl moiety from phosphatidylglycerol.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269 (8051048): 19701-19706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipoprotein signal peptidase II (Lsp) then recognizes the lipobox and cleaves the leader peptide at the Cys + 1 position, liberating the cysteine α-amino group and forming a diacylated lipoprotein (DA-LP) (8Hussain M.

Although Lgt and Lsp are highly conserved in the lipoprotein biosynthetic pathways from diverse prokaryotes, further acyl tailoring modifications can occur. In the majority of Gram-negative bacteria and some high-GC Gram-positive species, lipoprotein N-acyltransferase (Lnt) attaches a single amide-linked acyl chain to the α-amino group of DA-LP using a neighboring phospholipid as the acyl donor to complete triacylated lipoprotein (TA-LP) (9Gupta S.D.

This novel lipoprotein chemotype (lyso-LP) is directed by an enzyme (WMC_RS08810) that is narrowly distributed among enterococci, being confined to a subset of intestinal-associated strains that includes the opportunistic nosocomial pathogens Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium (12Fiore E.

Lyso-LP formation may thus play a role in host adaptation, as lipoproteins are key ligands for Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) complexes of the innate immune system (13Oliveira-Nascimento L. Massari P.

For the lyso-LP forming enzymes, there are no functionally characterized sequence orthologs, no conserved domains with annotation, and the catalytic mechanism is unknown. Two possible mechanisms for lyso-LP formation have been proposed: (i) N-acylation by an Lnt-like mechanism coupled with a O-deacylation sn-2 lipase activity; or (ii) transacylation through direct transfer of the sn-2 acyl chain from the diacylglycerol moiety to the N terminus (5Buddelmeijer N.

Because WMC_RS08810 is only ∼200 amino acids, we initially favored an intramolecular transfer model (Fig. 1, (ii)) and annotated WMC_RS08810 as lipoprotein intramolecular transferase (Lit) (11Armbruster K.M.

To test whether Lit functions as an inter- or intramolecular transacylase (Fig. 1), an E. coli strain was first engineered to produce substrate for in vitro reconstitution reactions with Lit (Fig. 2). DA-LP substrate with deuterium specifically incorporated into the diacylglycerol fatty acid ω termini could be used to ascertain N-acyl chain origin. Most Gram-negative bacteria, however, including E. coli, require N-acylation of lipoproteins for efficient trafficking from the cytoplasmic membrane to the outer membrane (23Narita S. Tokuda H. Overexpression of LolCDE allows deletion of the Escherichia coli gene encoding apolipoprotein N-acyltransferase.J.

Without N-acylation, outer membrane bound lipoproteins accumulate in the cytoplasmic membrane and some, notably Braun's lipoprotein (Lpp), form aberrant cross-links to peptidoglycan (24Yakushi T.

To prevent further entry into the β-oxidation cycle, which would catabolize labeled octyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA and randomly distribute the deuterium label, the first enzyme in the β-oxidation cycle acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (FadE) was deleted as well (35Campbell J.W.

Although the growth rate of the final DA-LP labeling strain (TXM1111) was significantly decreased in standard lyosogeny broth (LB) when compared with that of the parent WT and intermediate strains, octanoate supplementation of both solid (not shown) and liquid media improved growth (Fig. 2B). Long chain fatty acids such as palmitate, which are not shunted by PA3286 (36Yuan Y. Leeds J.A. Meredith T.C. Pseudomonas aeruginosa directly shunts β-oxidation degradation intermediates into de novo fatty acid biosynthesis.J.

Growth enhancement by octanoate, but not palmitate, suggested efficient incorporation of octanoate by the engineered PA3286 shunt (Fig. 2). MALDI-TOF MS analysis of trypsinized [d5]-DA-LppK58A-strep purified from TXM1111 grown in media supplemented with octanoic-7,7,8,8,8-[d5] acid confirmed a new series of peaks shifted by 10 u compared with the negative control fabH+ strain KA775 (Fig. 3, A versus D, Table 1). The most abundant peak (1167.8 u) can be assigned to the N-terminal lipopeptide of LppK58A with 10 deuterium atoms, consistent with two [d5]-labeled acyl chains (Fig. 3C). A low abundance peak corresponding to singly labeled lipopeptide can be observed at 1162.6 u. Notably absent is the unlabeled lipopeptide peak (1157.6 u), which is the most abundant ion in the spectrum of the control strain KA775. To further characterize both lipoprotein structure and extent of labeling, the 1167.8 u parent ion was fragmented by tandem MS/MS (Fig. 3B). The y series ions corresponding to the SSNAK peptide of Lpp were observed as expected, whereas fragment ions 575.6 u, 607.7 u, and 647.7 u confirm a free α-amino terminus (Fig. 3C). Ions 575.6 u and 607.7 u, respectively, represent the dehydroalanyl peptide and the thiolated congener, generated by the neutral loss of the diacylthioglycerol and diacylglycerol moieties. The 647.7 u ion is consistent with the loss of both labeled fatty acids, a characteristic DA-LP fragment peak (11Armbruster K.M. Meredith T.C.

The MS/MS spectrum of the 1157.8 u parent ion of unlabeled Lpp from KA775 shared these nonacylated fragment ions, confirming peptide identity, free N-terminal structure, and supports specific isotope incorporation within the acyl chains in TXM1111 (Fig. 3, E and F). Distinct between the two spectra, additional ions at 909.1 u and 927.2 u of [d5]-DA-Lpp from TXM1111 correspond to the parent ion having lost a labeled [d5]-C16:1 fatty acid (C15D5H24COOH) or [d5]-C16:1 ketene (C14D5H22CH=C = O), respectively (Fig. 3B). The corresponding ions in the unlabeled sample are shifted 5 u lower (904.0 and 921.6 u) (Fig. 3, E and F). The acyl chain composition for the most abundant DA-LP species can thus be inferred as one monounsaturated (C16:1) and one saturated (C16:0) palmitate fatty acids.Table 1Calculated masses of [d5]-DA-LppK58A-strep[M + H]+ (u)[M+Na]+ (u)Total acyl chain length1The sn-1 or sn-2 assignments were not determined by MS/MS unless indicated.Number of [d5]-laboratory led acyl chains1139.61161.630:121157.61179.632:12MS/MS analysis indicates C16:0 and C16:1 (Fig. 3, B and E).01162.61184.63Peaks not observed (Fig. 3).32:12MS/MS analysis indicates C16:0 and C16:1 (Fig. 3, B and E).11167.61189.632:12MS/MS analysis indicates C16:0 and C16:1 (Fig. 3, B and E).21185.61207.634:101190.61212.63Peaks not observed (Fig. 3).34:111195.74Potassium adduct of 1157.6 u (Fig. 3D).1217.734:121 The sn-1 or sn-2 assignments were not determined by MS/MS unless indicated.2 MS/MS analysis indicates C16:0 and C16:1 (Fig. 3, B and E).3 Peaks not observed (Fig. 3).4 Potassium adduct of 1157.6 u (Fig. 3D).

The MS spectra of digested [d5]-DA-LppK58A-strep contains a prominent peak at 924.6 u consistent in mass with the loss of the labeled saturated [d5]-C16:0 acyl chain, allowing regiospecific assignment of C16:1 to the sn-2 position in the [d5]-DA-LppK58A-strep substrate (Fig. S1). Together, these data indicate that the majority of [d5]-DA-LppK58A-strep population purified from strain TXM1111 is dually labeled with two C16 [d5]-acyl chains and has preferentially incorporated C16:1 in the sn-2 position.

https://openalex.org/W3030064996,"Background An outbreak of respiratory disease associated with adenovirus type 7 occurred in a boot camp in China and was characterized by many cases, severe symptoms, and intrapulmonary infection in many patients. Methods We implemented a series of comprehensive preventive and control measures. We analyzed the incubation period and generation time by using the maximum likelihood method, assessed the symptom period and hospitalization duration using the Kaplan-Meier method, and estimated the basic reproductive number and dormitory transmission rate by using established methods. Results The epidemic lasted for 30 days, and 375 individuals were affected. Overall, 109 patients were hospitalized, and 266 individuals were isolated and treated. The median incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.0 to 5.4 days). The median generation time was 7.3 days (95% CI: 7.1 to 7.6 days). The median symptom period was 6 days (95% CI: 6 to 7 days). The median hospitalization duration was 9 days (95% CI: 9 to 11 days). The basic reproductive number was 5.1 (95% CI: 4.6 to 5.6), and the dormitory transmission rate was 0.15 (95% CI: 0.12 to 0.18). Conclusion Patients in the early stage of the epidemic were treated as having a regular cold and were not isolated; therefore, the virus continued to be transmitted to other susceptible individuals."
https://openalex.org/W3030364041,"Background With more than 18 million annual new cases, cancer belongs to the major challenges of modern healthcare. Surgical resection of solid tumours under general anaesthesia is the prime therapy. Different aspects of anaesthesia are under discussion to independently influence the long-term outcome of cancer patients. Most recently, the commonly used volatile anaesthetics like sevoflurane have entered the spotlight, as retrospective studies suggest a detrimental outcome in certain cancer aetiologies with sparse mechanistic understanding. Our objective was to investigate this concept in a murine melanoma model, herein comparing the consequence of inhalative and injection anesthesia on tumour composition and growth. Methods We used a murine model of malignant melanoma in male, adult C57BL/6 mice (n = 92), induced by the subcutaneous injection of B16-F10 cells. We either exposed the melanoma cells to sevoflurane before implantation or subjected the animals to single or double anaesthesia with either volatile or injection drugs. After a maximum follow-up of 4 weeks, leucocytes within the tumour microenvironment (TME) were comprehensively analysed by flow cytometry with focus on tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). Results We found that exposure of melanoma cells to sevoflurane before implantation induced long-lasting transcriptome changes and aggravated tumour growth, without extensive changes of the TME. Contrastingly, both a single and double anaesthesia with sevoflurane led to a significant reduction of TAMs (injection vs. sevoflurane: 2,0 vs. 0.3% and 1.2 vs. 0.6%, respectively), whilst increasing PD-L1 expression on the remaining cells (mean fluorescent intensity injection vs. sevoflurane: 3,804 vs. 7,143 and 9,090 vs. 32,228, respectively). No changes in tumour growth were observed in these groups. Conclusion In sharp contrast to the detrimental impact of sevoflurane on patients’ outcome reported in retrospective clinical studies, we propose here that sevoflurane might actually exert a beneficial effect by decreasing TAMs within the TME, rendering the tumour again susceptible for cytotoxic T cells and immunotherapies. Further research is warranted to delineate, how these results translate into the clinic."
https://openalex.org/W3031141621,"Hundreds of target specific peptides are routinely discovered by peptide display platforms. However, due to the high cost of peptide synthesis only a limited number of peptides are chemically made for further analysis. Here we describe an accurate and cost effective method to bin peptides on-phage based on binding region(s), without any requirement for peptide or protein synthesis. This approach, which integrates phage and yeast display platforms, requires display of target and its alanine variants on yeast. Flow cytometry was used to detect binding of peptides on-phage to the target on yeast. Once hits were identified, they were synthesized to confirm their binding region(s) by HDX (Hydrogen deuterium exchange) and crystallography. Moreover, we have successfully shown that this approach can be implemented as part of a panning process to deplete non-functional peptides. This technique can be applied to any target that can be successfully displayed on yeast; it narrows down the number of peptides requiring synthesis; and its utilization during selection results in enrichment of peptide population against defined binding regions on the target."

This study evaluated the incidence of preterm births (before 37 and 34 weeks), low birthweight infants (<2500 g and <1500 g), small-for-gestational age infants, preterm premature rupture of membranes, and gestational hypertension in mothers with lupus and compared them with those of the Japanese general population. Data from participants in the Japan Environment and Children's Study who gave birth between 2011 and 2014 were collected. Only participants with singleton pregnancies were included. Adjusted odds ratios for the variables were calculated using a logistic regression model, with a general population as the reference. In total, 88,017 participants were included in the analysis, and 63 of them had lupus. The adjusted odds ratios of preterm births before 37 and 34 weeks, low birthweight infants <2500 g and <1500 g, small-for-gestational age infants, and preterm premature rupture of membranes in the systemic lupus erythematosus group were 8.1 (95% CI, 4.7-14.1), 5.2 (1.6-16.5), 6.5 (3.9-10.8), 5.4 (1.3-22.4), 2.9 (1.4-5.9), and 12.1 (5.7-25.5), respectively. The adjusted odds ratio of gestational hypertension was 1.4 (0.4-4.5). This study revealed increased risk of preterm births, low birthweight infants, small-for-gestational age infants, and preterm premature rupture of membranes in patients with lupus when compared with those in the general population."
https://openalex.org/W3031741277,"Chemokines mediate leukocyte migration and homeostasis and are key targets in inflammatory diseases including atherosclerosis, cytokine storm, and chronic autoimmune disease. Chemokine redundancy and ensuing network robustness has frustrated therapeutic development. Salivary evasins from ticks bind multiple chemokines to overcome redundancy and are effective in several preclinical disease models. Their clinical development has not progressed because of concerns regarding potential immunogenicity, parenteral delivery, and cost. Peptides mimicking protein activity can overcome the perceived limitations of therapeutic proteins. Here we show that peptides possessing multiple chemokine-binding and anti-inflammatory activities can be developed from the chemokine-binding site of an evasin. We used hydrogen–deuterium exchange MS to map the binding interface of the evasin P672 that physically interacts with C–C motif chemokine ligand (CCL) 8 and synthesized a 16-mer peptide (BK1.1) based on this interface region in evasin P672. Fluorescent polarization and native MS approaches showed that BK1.1 binds CCL8, CCL7, and CCL18 and disrupts CCL8 homodimerization. We show that a BK1.1 derivative, BK1.3, has substantially improved ability to disrupt P672 binding to CCL8, CCL2, and CCL3 in an AlphaScreen assay. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we show that BK1.3 directly binds CCL8. BK1.3 also has substantially improved ability to inhibit CCL8, CCL7, CCL2, and CCL3 chemotactic function in vitro. We show that local as well as systemic administration of BK1.3 potently blocks inflammation in vivo. Identification and characterization of the chemokine-binding interface of evasins could thus inspire the development of novel anti-inflammatory peptides that therapeutically target the chemokine network in inflammatory diseases.

The reason for this is thought to lie, at least in part, in the apparent redundancy within the chemokine network, which creates robustness (11Mantovani A.

This phenomenon suggests that the ability to target multiple chemokines is an effective strategy to disable the chemokine network and host defense mechanisms such as inflammation. The application of such chemokine-binding proteins in diverse preclinical models of inflammation has been well-documented (15Sharif S. Nakatani Y. Wise L. Corbett M. Real N.C. Stuart G.S. Lateef Z.

When administered parenterally, evasins have potent anti-inflammatory efficacy in preclinical disease models including myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury, intestinal ischemia, colitis, acute pancreatitis, lung inflammation, arthritis, psoriasis, and graft-versus-host disease (reviewed in Ref. 16Bonvin P. Power C.A. Proudfoot A.E. Evasins: therapeutic potential of a new family of chemokine-binding proteins from ticks.Front.

Unfortunately, the clinical translation of evasins has not progressed, in part because of the perceived limitations of using foreign proteins as biological therapeutics such as immunogenicity, requirement for parenteral delivery, and relatively high manufacturing costs (22Boehncke W.H. Brembilla N.C. Immunogenicity of biologic therapies: causes and consequences.Exp. Rev. Clin.

Peptidomimetic and peptide therapeutics developed from foreign proteins and mimicking their activity can overcome some of these limitations (24Lau J.L. Dunn M.K. Therapeutic peptides: historical perspectives, current development trends, and future directions.Bioorg. Med.

We have recently shown that a class A evasin EVA-P672 (here referred to as P672), identified from the tick Rhipicephalus pulchellus, binds several CC-class chemokines and contains a CCL8-binding region in its N terminus (20Eaton J.R.O. Alenazi Y. Singh K. Davies G. Geis-Asteggiante L. Kessler B. Robinson C.V. Kawamura A. Bhattacharya S. The N-terminal domain of a tick evasin is critical for chemokine binding and neutralization and confers specific binding activity to other evasins.J. Biol.

Here we report the experimental mapping of the P672–CCL8 interface using hydrogen–deuterium exchange MS and biophysical analyses and identify a linear sequence in the N terminus of P672 that binds CCL8. Using this information, we designed a series of short synthetic peptides that demonstrate promiscuous chemokine binding and neutralization activity in vitro. One of these peptides, BK1.3, was shown to be able to block inflammatory recruitment of neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, and T-cells in an in vivo air-pouch model, induced by the pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP), zymosan. Taken together, these experiments provide proof of concept that small biologically active peptides that target multiple chemokines and have anti-inflammatory activity can be engineered through the analysis of evasin–chemokine interactions. We performed peptide-resolution hydrogen–deuterium exchange (HDX) MS to characterize the interaction between P672 and CCL8. HDX-MS measures the rate of exchange of protein backbone hydrogen atoms with deuterium atoms in the solvent (25Konermann L. Pan J. Liu Y.-H. Hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry for studying protein structure and dynamics.Chem. Soc. Rev. 2011; 40 (21173980): 1224-123410.1039/c0cs00113aCrossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Changes in deuterium uptake between free and complexed proteins can inform on protein–protein interfaces and conformational dynamics (26Brown K.A. Wilson D.J. Bottom-up hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry: data analysis and interpretation.Analyst. 2017; 142 (28702519): 2874-288610.1039/c7an00662dCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Regions that are protected from deuterium uptake upon complex formation are shielded from the solvent typically because of involvement in interprotein hydrogen-bonding networks that stabilize the complex (27Marcsisin S.R. Engen J.R. Hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry: what is it and what can it tell us?.Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2010; 397 (20195578): 967-97210.1007/s00216-010-3556-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We measured the deuterium uptake of free P672, of free CCL8, and of each protein upon complex formation. After confirming satisfactory sequence mapping and coverage of each protein (100% for P672, and 96.9% for CCL8; Fig. S1), we compared the deuterium uptake of the free species with that of the P672–CCL8 complex species (5-s, 30-s, 5-min, and 60-min incubation time points; Fig. S2). The results were mapped on to a homology model of the P672–CCL8 complex (Fig. 1, A and B). Although large parts of P672 and CCL8 showed no significant changes in H/D exchange rates, we observed a significant decrease in H/D exchange in Arg18–Ser27 of CCL8 (% relative deuterium uptake (%D) ranging from −6 to −18), which lies in the N-terminal extended loop/β1 region (28Blaszczyk J. Coillie E.V. Proost P. Damme J.V. Opdenakker G. Bujacz G.D. Wang J.M. Ji X. Complete crystal structure of monocyte chemotactic protein-2, a CC chemokine that interacts with multiple receptors.Biochemistry. 2000; 39 (11087354): 14075-1408110.1021/bi0009340Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and in the N-terminal unstructured (predicted) region of P672 (Glu22–Phe32, %D up to −58%), indicating protection of these regions from solvent exposure when in complex (Fig. 1, B–D, and Fig. S2). All residues in CCL8 and most in P672 (Phe25–Cys30, Phe32) from these regions were protected at all time points (Fig. S2). Spectra of two representative P672 peptides showing a reduction in deuterium incorporation for this protected region upon complex formation are shown in Fig. 1E. An increase in relative deuterium uptake was observed for the C-terminal region of P672 (Gly87–Cys94, %D ranging from 15 to 18%), indicating higher exposure to solvent water after complex formation (Fig. 1C and Fig. S2). All HDX-MS uptake data and plots are shown in Table S1. These results indicate that the P672 (Glu22–Phe32) and CCL8 (Arg18–Ser27) regions are likely involved in P672–CCL8 complex formation. The protected regions of P672 and CCL8 overlap the binding interface predicted by the homology model of P672–CCL8 (20Eaton J.R.O. Alenazi Y. Singh K. Davies G. Geis-Asteggiante L. Kessler B.

Changes in the deuterium uptake in these regions show little time-dependent change (5 s to 60 min; Fig. S2), in agreement with the tight-binding kinetics of P672–CCL8 interaction (Kd = 8.5 nm, residency time = 27 min) (20Eaton J.R.O.

To explore the function of P672 (Glu22–Phe32), we swapped this region with the corresponding segment of EVA1, which is a related CC-chemokine–binding evasin that does not bind CCL8 (20Eaton J.R.O.

We analyzed the CCL8-binding activity of the resulting hybrid protein EVA1(P67222-32) (Fig. 2B) using biolayer interferometry and found that it bound CCL8, whereas consistent with previously reported results (20Eaton J.R.O.

Dose-titration experiments indicated that EVA1(P67222–32) bound CCL8 with modest affinity (Kd = 490 nm). Taken together with the HDX-MS analysis, these experiments confirmed that P672(Glu22–Phe32) is involved in forming protein–protein interactions with CCL8 and that this function can be transferred to another evasin. Guided by the HDX-MS and swapping experiments, we tested a number of tiled peptide fragments spanning the Glu17–Phe32 region in P672 for CCL8 binding (Fig. 3A). Tyr21 and the four acidic residues N-terminal to Tyr21 were also included in this array, because both P672 and EVA1 share this region. To prevent disulfide bond formation, all peptides were synthesized with Cys30 replaced by Ala. These peptides were synthesized with N-terminal FITC to assess their chemokine binding affinities using a fluorescence polarization assay (BK1–6; Fig. 3B). The longest test peptide P672(Glu17–Phe32) was termed BK1.1FITC, and a corresponding scrambled sequence was generated as a negative control (SCRFITC). Only the full contiguous peptide (BK1.1FITC) displayed an increase in anisotropy upon incubation with CCL8 (at a concentration of 1 μm) compared with control, indicating a binding interaction. Interestingly, no changes in anisotropy were observed for Tyr21–Phe32 (BK6FITC) under the conditions tested. We next used fluorescent polarization and dose titration of CCL8 to estimate its affinity for BK1.1FITC (Fig. 3C) and found that this was relatively high (Kd =156 ± 7 nm, mean ± S.E.). To further explore the mechanism of BK1.1 binding, we performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis in which each residue of BK1.1FITC was replaced with Ala. We tested each mutant for binding to CCL8 using the fluorescent anisotropy assay to measure binding affinity. This revealed a number of key residues that contribute to CCL8 binding (Fig. 3D and Table S2). Significant differences were observed when aromatic residues Tyr and Phe (Tyr21, Tyr31, Phe25, and Phe32) were mutated. The Asp18 mutation also showed reduced affinity, supporting the peptide tiling data and indicating the importance of interactions outside of the Tyr21–Phe32 region. Notably, mutation of Pro27 completely abolished binding to CCL8, indicating that it has a key function. To further investigate the binding of BK1.1 to CCL8, we employed native MS. Under native conditions, CCL8 exists as a homodimer (Fig. 3E). However, after incubation with BK1.1, both 1:1 and 2:1 species of the BK1.1–CCL8 complex were observed, together with CCL8 monomer and BK1.1. The presence of CCL8 monomer and BK1.1 species is likely due to partial dissociation of the complex. The stoichiometry observed was supported by dissociation of these complexes using higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD). BK1.1 can thus form a stable 1:1 complex with CCL8 and disrupt CCL8 homodimerization in line with our P672–CCL8 native MS analysis (20Eaton J.R.O. Alenazi Y. Singh K. Davies G. Geis-Asteggiante L.

Interestingly, the presence of low levels of 2:1 BK1.1–CCL8 complex indicates a possible second site of BK1.1 binding. We next screened BK1.1FITC for binding against the 13 CC-chemokines known to bind to P672 (20Eaton J.R.O. Alenazi Y. Singh K. Davies G. Geis-Asteggiante L. Kessler B. Robinson C.V. Kawamura A.

CCL7, CCL8, and CCL18 caused significant increases in anisotropy of the emitted light compared with the negative control CXCL1, a chemokine that does not bind P672 (20Eaton J.R.O. Alenazi Y. Singh K.

Fluorescent polarization displacement assays with unlabeled BK1.1 confirmed its binding to CCL7, CCL8, and CCL18 (Fig. 3, G–I). We next explored the role of the four acidic residues N-terminal to Tyr21 and the impact of Cys-Ala mutation introduced in BK1.1. We designed two shorter peptides from P672 residues Tyr21–Phe32, with either Ala (peptide Y21F32, C30A) or Cys (peptide Y21F32) at position 30 (Fig. 4A) and compared them with BK1.1 in their ability to disrupt the interaction between P672 and CCL8 using an AlphaScreen assay. We found that all three peptides significantly disrupted the interaction, with the effects of Y21F32 and BK1.1 far exceeding that of peptide Y21F32, C30A (Fig. 4B). We found that only Y21F32 and BK1.1 disrupted the P672–CCL2 interaction and that only Y21F32 disrupted the P672–CCL3 interaction (Fig. 4, C and D). These results implied that the four acidic residues N-terminal to Tyr21 and the Cys residue were important for chemokine binding. To improve chemokine-binding affinity, we designed a series of peptides (BK1.2–BK1.5) based on BK1.1 (Fig. 4A), in which we maintained the four acidic residues N-terminal to Tyr21 and also Cys at position 30. Because cyclization is known to improve conformational stability, a cyclic version BK1.2 was designed, with Cys30 cyclized to a N-terminal Tyr residue that was introduced (29McAllister T.E. Yeh T.L.

Commun. 2017; 8 (28382930): 1477310.1038/ncomms14773Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). As a control, we also created a noncyclized version of this peptide, BK1.3. We assayed the binding of these peptides to CCL8 by examining their ability to disrupt the P672–CCL8 interaction using an AlphaScreen assay (Fig. 4, E and F). We found that both BK1.2 (IC50 = 729 nm) and BK1.3 (IC50 = 238 nm) had significantly improved ability to disrupt the P672–CCL8 interaction compared with BK1.1 (IC50 = 59.1 μm). To explore the mechanism of enhanced activity, we created further peptides BK1.4 (cyclized) and BK1.5 (linear) that lacked the N-terminal Tyr. BK1.4 is cyclized to Cys30 through the N-terminal Glu17 residue. We found that these modifications resulted in a significant reduction of binding activity compared with BK1.3 (Fig. 4, E and F). These results suggested that cyclization itself is not critical but instead that the N-terminal Tyr is important. Examination of the peptides by MS revealed that BK1.3 readily oxidized to form a disulfide-bonded dimer, whereas BK1.5 was monomeric (Fig. S3). To examine the binding profile of BK1 derivatives for other CC-chemokines, we tested their ability to inhibit P672 interactions with CCL2 and CCL3 using AlphaScreen (Fig. 4, G–J). Although BK1.1 did not inhibit, in line with the lack of binding observed against CCL2 and CCL3 in fluorescent polarization assays (Fig. 3F), all other BK derivatives showed good inhibition against CCL2 and weaker inhibition against CCL3. The IC50 of BK1.3 against CCL2 was 5.7 μm, and that against CCL3 was 43 μm. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (31Velazquez-Campoy A. Leavitt S.A. Freire E.

The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of universal childhood malaria vaccination in Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) of Bangladesh with newly developed RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccines. Methods A decision model was been developed using Microsoft® Excel to examine the potential impact of future vaccination in Bangladesh. We estimated the economic and health burden due to malaria and the cost-effectiveness of malaria vaccination from the health system and societal perspective. The primary outcomes include the incremental cost per Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) averted, incremental cost per case averted, and the incremental cost per death averted. Results Introducing childhood malaria vaccination in CHT in Bangladesh for a single birth cohort could prevent approximately 500 malaria cases and at least 30 deaths from malaria during the first year of vaccination. The cost per DALY averted of introducing the malaria vaccine compared to status quo is US$ 2,629 and US$ 2,583 from the health system and societal perspective, respectively. Conclusions Introduction of malaria vaccination in CHT region is estimated to be a cost-effective preventive intervention and would offer substantial future benefits particularly for young children vaccinated today. Policies should, thus, consider the operational advantages of targeting these populations, particularly in the CHT area, with the vaccine along with other malaria control initiatives."

The populations of the three Alkanna species in the Bulgarian flora are small and fragmented. There are no previous reports on the chemical profile or on the embryology of these species. The hypothesis was that the limited distribution of A. primuliflora, A. stribrnyi, and A. graeca was due to their reproductive capacity and genetic diversity. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the three species will contain pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs), as other species of the genus Alkanna (Boraginaceae), but they would have differential alkaloids composition. The population genetic structure and differentiation showed a clear distinction between species and revealed average levels of genetic diversity among the natural populations of the three Alkanna species. The embryological investigation observed stability of the processes in the male and female generative spheres and high viability of mature pollen and embryo of the three species. The normal formation of male and female gametophytes without deviations or degenerative processes, and observed levels of genetic diversity between Alkanna individuals are important in maintaining the size and resilience of the Alkanna populations. Eight alkaloids were identified by GC-MS in A. primuliflora and A. graeca and six alkaloids in A. stribrnyi. The main pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) in all investigated species was triangularine. A. primuliflora and A. graeca showed similar chemical composition that comprised 9-angeloylretronecine, 7-tigloylretronecine, 9-tigloylretronecine, triangularicine, dihydroxytriangularine, dihydroxytriangularicine, whereas, in A. stribrnyi 9-tigloylretronecine, triangularicine and dihydroxytriangularicine were not found. This is the first report on the presence of PAs in A. primuliflora, A. stribrnyi and A. graeca. Besides, this is the first report on the embryology of these endemic species. The results contribute to the knowledge of the three endemic Alkanna species and will facilitate policy-making and defining new strategies for their conservation."

The past year has been significant for the field of RNA-guided endonuclease (RGEN)-mediated genetic therapy, with the publication of the first papers reporting the use of RGENs to edit RNA (Lee et al., 2019Lee S.J.

These early clinical trials have shown RGEN-mediated genetic therapy to be safe in a few cancer patients, but the long-term efficacy and safety of these approaches remain to be established. Nevertheless, these three phase 1 clinical trials are groundbreaking and build on the discovery that an RGEN can be engineered to reprogram a targeted nucleotide sequence in cells. This ability to edit nucleic acids has already revolutionized basic biological research and promises to revolutionize the treatment of diseases that have a genetic basis. The discovery that an RGEN can edit a nucleic acid was first reported in 1994 (Sullenger and Cech, 1994Sullenger B.A. Cech T.R. Ribozyme-mediated repair of defective mRNA by targeted, trans-splicing.Nature. 1994; 371: 619-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Figure 1, this paper demonstrated that an RNA-guided endonuclease, based on the group I catalytic RNA from Tetrahymena thermophila, can edit a mutant RNA by (1) binding a nucleic acid sequence through an RNA guide; (2) cleaving the bound nucleic acid with an endonuclease associated with this guide; and (3) repairing the broken nucleic acid and, in the process, editing its sequence—in this example to repair a mutant RNA. So, what led to the scientific breakthrough of RGEN-mediated editing? The concept that RNA can recognize a target nucleic acid sequence by complementary base-pairing and inhibit the expression of this targeted sequence dates back to the discovery that antisense RNA can be used to inhibit gene expression. However, Zaug and colleagues were the first to recognize that an RNA sequence can be used to guide an endonuclease—one that is directly associated with a guide RNA—to cleave a target RNA at a particular nucleotide position. This discovery arose from their studies of the trans-cleaving group I ribozyme from T. thermophila (Zaug et al., 1986Zaug A.J. Been M.D. Cech T.R. The Tetrahymena ribozyme acts like an RNA restriction endonuclease.Nature. 1986; 324: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In this work, these researchers discovered that this group I ribozyme (a catalytic RNA) could act as a programmable RNA restriction endonuclease. The ribozyme recognizes substrate RNAs through a modifiable, complementary RNA guide sequence, termed an internal guide sequence (IGS), which is positioned at the 5′ end of this RGEN. The IGS is designed to form base-pairs with a target RNA sequence. By doing so, it positions the group I endonuclease so that it will cleave the bound RNA at a specific nucleotide (steps 1 and 2 in Figure 1). Subsequent studies of another type of catalytic RNA, the hammerhead ribozyme, demonstrated that this RNA enzyme could also be converted into a programmable RGEN that could be made to recognize and cleave target RNAs. The finding that these catalytic RNAs could serve as RGENs and be engineered to selectively bind and cleave pathogenic RNAs, such as those encoding essential HIV gene products, led to a tremendous amount of excitement and investment by the biomedical research community 30 years ago. However, two major limitations of this approach became immediately apparent: (1) the RNA cleavage products generated inside cells by these endonucleases were not very stable, making it challenging to study and optimize such approaches, and (2) the RGENs have to cleave the vast majority of a target RNA to produce a phenotypic effect in cells. After several failed attempts to detect and characterize intracellular RGEN-generated RNA cleavage products, Tom Cech and I decided to pursue a novel, risky, and somewhat counterintuitive approach to studying RGEN activity inside cells—create an RGEN that would not cleave and destroy a targeted nucleic acid but rather cleave and then alter a nucleic acid’s sequence inside cells. We had two main objectives. First, to generate RGEN reaction products that were more stable than the cleavage products and that contained an altered (that is, edited) sequence, so that one could identify and characterize the reaction products generated by the ribozyme inside cells. And second, to reduce the need for the RGEN to react with the vast majority of a substrate RNA inside a cell, by editing the targeted nucleic acid so that it would encode a new, functional protein and result in a gain of function. With such objectives in mind, and following many brainstorming sessions with my lab bay mate, Jennifer Doudna, as well as with other Cech lab members, we set out to create a variant of the group I RGEN from Tetrahymena. This variant could not only cleave target RNAs but also subsequently repair the broken phosphodiester backbone of a targeted RNA and, in the process, edit its sequence. In this case, the group I RGEN was engineered to utilize a ligase activity to attach a new functional sequence onto an otherwise defective substrate transcript following cleavage by the group I RGEN (Figure 1) (Sullenger and Cech, 1994Sullenger B.A. Cech T.R. Ribozyme-mediated repair of defective mRNA by targeted, trans-splicing.Nature. 1994; 371: 619-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). These initial editing studies were performed on mutant lacZ transcripts in vitro and in E. coli, and they showed that RGEN-mediated editing can efficiently replace a defective portion of a nucleic acid sequence with a functional sequence in vitro and generate functional lacZ transcripts that are translated to yield β-galactosidase activity in bacteria. Thus, these studies established that an RGEN can edit a nucleic acid sequence inside bacterial cells. Moreover, this discovery established the three-step process that remains the standard strategy employed to achieve nucleic acid editing with other RGENs (Figure 2). The novelty of this work was recognized by the issuing of a broad patent estate to the University of Colorado on this catalytic RNA-based RGEN editing approach (U.S. Patents 5667969, 5869254, 6897016, and 7045293 entitled “Alteration of sequence of a target molecule…”). Moreover, as this same group I RGEN had already been shown to cleave DNA (Herschlag and Cech, 1990Herschlag D. Cech T.R. DNA cleavage catalysed by the ribozyme from Tetrahymena.Nature. 1990; 344: 405-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), albeit less efficiently than RNA and not under physiological conditions, it was apparent that this three-step editing approach should also be able to edit a DNA substrate, if an appropriate RGEN could be identified. Thus, the discovery that an RGEN could edit an RNA in bacteria to convert a mutant RNA into one encoding a functional protein represented a significant conceptual advance for the fields of RNA therapeutics and gene therapy. However, this discovery also led to two important questions that have consumed the RGEN-mediated editing field during the past quarter of a century. (1) Can RGENs edit RNA in mammalian cells, and if so, in primary human, animal, and patient cells as well? (2) Can an RGEN be identified that can edit DNA under physiological conditions, as the T. thermophila group I RGEN could not? During the past 25 years, studies have shown that both questions can be unequivocally answered with a yes, as we discuss in the following sections. The first example of RNA being edited with an RGEN in mammalian cells was published in 1996 (Jones et al., 1996Jones J.T. Lee S.W. Sullenger B.A. Tagging ribozyme reaction sites to follow trans-splicing in mammalian cells.Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). When expressed from an RNA polymerase II promoter, the group I RGEN from T. thermophila was shown to edit and repair a mutant lacZ target RNA in mammalian cells with high fidelity; it altered the sequence of the RNA by cleaving it at the intended nucleotide and by ligating a new sequence in frame onto the exact nucleotide at the 3′ RNA end it had just created (Figure 1) (Jones et al., 1996Jones J.T. Lee S.W. Sullenger B.A. Tagging ribozyme reaction sites to follow trans-splicing in mammalian cells.Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was shown that nearly 50% of a model mutant lacZ target RNA could be edited in mammalian cells by expressing the group I RGEN at higher levels than the substrate RNA. This observation led to speculation that such RNA editing could prove useful for treating a wide range of genetic disorders. Two studies, published in 1998, then demonstrated that the group I RGEN from Tetrahymena can indeed edit clinically relevant mutant RNAs associated with genetic diseases in human cells (Phylactou et al., 1998Phylactou L.A. Darrah C. Wood M.J. Ribozyme-mediated trans-splicing of a trinucleotide repeat.Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 378-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) (Lan et al., 1998Lan N. Howrey R.P. Lee S.W. Smith C.A. Sullenger B.A. Ribozyme-mediated repair of sickle beta-globin mRNAs in erythrocyte precursors.Science. 1998; 280: 1593-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Phylactou and colleagues demonstrated that this approach could repair mutant RNA containing a trinucleotide repeat expansion associated with autosomal dominant myotonic dystrophy in human fibroblast cells. In this work, they created an RGEN that contained an RNA guide that recognized a sequence upstream of the CUG repeat expansion found in mutant human myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) mRNA. This RGEN cleaved the mutant transcript and then edited the cleaved mutant transcript by shortening the expansion repeat (Phylactou et al., 1998Phylactou L.A. Darrah C. Wood M.J. Ribozyme-mediated trans-splicing of a trinucleotide repeat.Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 378-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Similarly, Ning Lan and others in my laboratory demonstrated that this group I RGEN can be engineered to edit transcripts containing the point mutation in β-globin RNA associated with sickle cell disease (Lan et al., 1998Lan N. Howrey R.P. Lee S.W. Smith C.A. Sullenger B.A. Ribozyme-mediated repair of sickle beta-globin mRNAs in erythrocyte precursors.Science. 1998; 280: 1593-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In this study, the RGEN was engineered to contain an RNA guide that directed the group I endonuclease to a sequence upstream of the mutant nucleotide. The RGEN then cleaved the targeted transcript and edited the cleaved β-globin RNA to make it encode the anti-sickling γ-globin protein. Such editing was shown to proceed with high fidelity in erythrocyte precursors derived from patients with sickle cell disease (Lan et al., 1998Lan N. Howrey R.P. Lee S.W. Smith C.A. Sullenger B.A. Ribozyme-mediated repair of sickle beta-globin mRNAs in erythrocyte precursors.Science. 1998; 280: 1593-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). A subsequent study indicated that optimized group I RGENs can edit 10%–50% of sickle β-globin mRNAs in transfected mammalian cells by optimizing and extending the guide sequence (EGS; Figure 2A), leading to significant speculation that this RNA editing approach could be useful for treating sickle cell disease. Although encouraging, these results also highlighted a major limitation of using the group I RGEN-mediated editing approach to repair RNAs associated with genetic disease. To be effective therapies for such disorders, RNA editing would require the continuous, efficient, and prolonged editing of mutant RNAs. It was thus readily apparent that a preferable approach to treating genetic diseases would be to develop RGENs that edit DNA rather than RNA because DNA repair would result in the correction of all subsequently transcribed RNAs. RNA editing might nevertheless be more therapeutically useful in settings where the transient editing of a nucleic acid could still be beneficial. As a result, much of the RGEN RNA editing field turned its attention to the setting of cancer, as it was shown in 2000 that the transient editing of RNAs encoding mutant tumor suppressors, such as p53, by the Tetrahymena group I RGEN could induce p53 activity in osteosarcoma and colorectal carcinoma cells. A series of subsequent papers built on this initial cancer RNA editing study. Here, I briefly describe the key results of these studies and point readers to a recent review article for a more detailed discussion of this progress (Lee et al., 2018Lee C.H. Han S.R. Lee S.W. Group I Intron-Based Therapeutics Through Trans-Splicing Reaction.Prog. Mol. Biol. Transl. Sci. 2018; 159: 79-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). To develop an RNA editing approach applicable to a variety of cancers, the Lee laboratory created a group I RGEN that could selectively edit hTERT mRNA. hTERT RNA encodes human telomerase reverse transcriptase, a protein upregulated in the majority of cancers so that rapidly proliferating cells can replicate their chromosomal ends. They constructed a group I catalytic RNA designed to reprogram hTERT mRNA into transcripts that encode HSVtk (herpes simplex virus-1 thymidine kinase) RNA to make cancer cells responsive to ganciclovir because the kinase converts this prodrug into toxic DNA replication inhibitors. They then demonstrated that this group I RGEN is effective at limiting tumor growth in murine models of colorectal and hepatocellular carcinoma (Lee et al., 2018Lee C.H. Han S.R. Lee S.W. Group I Intron-Based Therapeutics Through Trans-Splicing Reaction.Prog. Mol. Biol. Transl. Sci. 2018; 159: 79-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). This RNA editing approach was recently translated into the clinic in a phase 1 clinical trial to treat 15 gastrointestinal cancer patients with liver metastasis (Lee et al., 2019Lee S.J. Shin S.P. Lee S.H. Kang J.W. Kook M.C. Kim I.H. Kim H.K. Phase I trial of intravenous Ad5CRT in patients with liver metastasis of gastrointestinal cancers.Cancer Gene Ther. 2019; 26: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Here, the group I RGEN was delivered via adenoviral gene transfer, and the RGEN was engineered to contain a liver-specific microRNA repressor sequence and a tissue-specific promoter to localize RNA editing to cancer cells (Lee et al., 2018Lee C.H. Han S.R. Lee S.W. Group I Intron-Based Therapeutics Through Trans-Splicing Reaction.Prog. Mol. Biol. Transl. Sci. 2018; 159: 79-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Results from this clinical study demonstrated that the group I RGEN-approach was well tolerated. The study also allowed clinical investigators to determine a recommended dose of the adenoviral vector for phase 2 trials to begin to assess the potential therapeutic efficacy of this RGEN-mediated RNA editing approach (Lee et al., 2019Lee S.J. Shin S.P. Lee S.H. Kang J.W. Kook M.C. Kim I.H. Kim H.K. Phase I trial of intravenous Ad5CRT in patients with liver metastasis of gastrointestinal cancers.Cancer Gene Ther. 2019; 26: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). This clinical study is noteworthy. It is the first published example of an RGEN being evaluated for nucleic acid editing following in vivo gene transfer in humans. Thus, the discovery that a group I catalytic RNA-based RGEN can edit a nucleic acid (Sullenger and Cech, 1994Sullenger B.A. Cech T.R. Ribozyme-mediated repair of defective mRNA by targeted, trans-splicing.Nature. 1994; 371: 619-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) has recently been translated from the bench to the bedside, to treat 15 cancer patients (Lee et al., 2019Lee S.J. Shin S.P. Lee S.H. Kang J.W. Kook M.C. Kim I.H. Kim H.K. Phase I trial of intravenous Ad5CRT in patients with liver metastasis of gastrointestinal cancers.Cancer Gene Ther. 2019; 26: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). It is remarkable that fundamental biochemical studies, on the very same enzyme that changed the world’s view of catalysis and supported the concept of an RNA world, the group I catalytic RNA from T. thermophila, have led to the development of a novel, potentially groundbreaking translational medicine technology. The ultimate clinical utility of this RGEN-mediated RNA editing approach obviously needs to be evaluated in much larger clinical studies, but nevertheless, the translation of this RNA editing concept into the clinic represents a major biomedical advance. As mentioned above, from its inception, the RGEN-mediated editing field has sought to engineer RGENs that could edit DNA instead of RNA. The first example of DNA editing being achieved inside cells, using a programmable RGEN, was reported by the Lambowitz and Sullenger laboratories using a mobile group II retrotransposon (Guo et al., 2000Guo H. Karberg M. Long M. Jones 3rd, J.P. Sullenger B. Lambowitz A.M. Group II introns designed to insert into therapeutically relevant DNA target sites in human cells.Science. 2000; 289: 452-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This study described how the catalytic RNA-based RGEN derived from the Lactococcus lactis group II intron Ll.LtrB can be utilized to edit DNA. It showed that a group II ribozyme-maturase protein complex could alter sequences at targeted DNA sites that are recognized by guide RNA sequences termed exon binding sites (EBS1 and EBS2; Figure 2B), which are present at the 5′ end of the catalytic RNA. This group II RGEN was able to rapidly and efficiently edit DNA in E. coli (Guo et al., 2000Guo H. Karberg M. Long M. Jones 3rd, J.P. Sullenger B. Lambowitz A.M. Group II introns designed to insert into therapeutically relevant DNA target sites in human cells.Science. 2000; 289: 452-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Moreover, specific group II-based RGENs were created to edit HIV-1 proviral DNA sequences and human CCR5 DNA, when these genes were transfected into the cytoplasm of human cells (Guo et al., 2000Guo H. Karberg M. Long M. Jones 3rd, J.P. Sullenger B. Lambowitz A.M. Group II introns designed to insert into therapeutically relevant DNA target sites in human cells.Science. 2000; 289: 452-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Thus, by 2000, the observation that a catalytic RNA-based RGEN could be used to edit nucleic acids had progressed to DNA editing. Unfortunately, both the Lamobowitz and Sullenger laboratories determined that this group II RGEN could not edit nuclear DNA in mammalian cells, even though it could efficiently edit DNA sequences (Guo et al., 2000Guo H. Karberg M. Long M. Jones 3rd, J.P. Sullenger B. Lambowitz A.M. Group II introns designed to insert into therapeutically relevant DNA target sites in human cells.Science. 2000; 289: 452-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and even repair genes (such as those associated with globinopathies [Jones et al., 2005Jones 3rd, J.P. Kierlin M.N. Coon R.G. Perutka J. Lambowitz A.M. Sullenger B.A. Retargeting mobile group II introns to repair mutant genes.Mol. Ther. 2005; 11: 687-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar]) in many bacterial strains, as well as edit DNA in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells (Guo et al., 2000Guo H. Karberg M. Long M. Jones 3rd, J.P. Sullenger B. Lambowitz A.M. Group II introns designed to insert into therapeutically relevant DNA target sites in human cells.Science. 2000; 289: 452-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The Lambowitz laboratory subsequently determined that this nuclear DNA-editing limitation appears to be due to the low concentration of free Mg2+ in the mammalian nucleus; the addition of Mg2+ to cell culture media allowed such mammalian nuclear genome editing by this group II RGEN to proceed (Truong et al., 2015Truong D.M. Hewitt F.C. Hanson J.H. Cui X. Lambowitz A.M. Retrohoming of a Mobile Group II Intron in Human Cells Suggests How Eukaryotes Limit Group II Intron Proliferation.PLoS Genet. 2015; 11: e1005422Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Collectively, these observations demonstrated that DNA editing by a catalytic RNA-based RGEN was efficient in many strains of bacteria and could occur in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells, as well as in the nucleus of mammalian cells if additional magnesium was provided. Nevertheless, the nucleic acid editing field was still eagerly awaiting an RGEN that could edit DNA efficiently in the mammalian nucleus under physiological conditions. While touring the Wright Brothers National Memorial with Jennifer Doudna and her family on the Outer Banks in 2009, I bemoaned the fact that the field had still not discovered an RGEN that could edit DNA in a human cell nucleus 15 years after we had first brainstormed about the concept back in Boulder. We both still agreed that if an RGEN were identified that could successfully employ the three-step editing process we had envisioned on mammalian genomic DNA, it would be a game changer, just as the Wright brothers’ pioneering discovery of a three-step process to control the first, albeit modest, powered flight had eventually changed the world by serving as the basis for modern air travel. Jennifer mentioned that her lab had recently started to study a new, interesting RNA-protein complex called CRISPR-Cas from a bacterial immune system; she was very interested in determining whether such complexes could become programable RGENs. In 2012, the Doudna and Charpentier laboratories published the seminal discovery that the CRISPR-Cas9 complex can be converted into an RGEN that could be programmed to cleave a specific DNA sequence through an RNA guide, termed sgRNA (single guide RNA; Figure 2C) (Jinek et al., 2012Jinek M. Chylinski K. Fonfara I. Hauer M. Doudna J.A. Charpentier E. A programmable dual-RNA-guided DNA endonuclease in adaptive bacterial immunity.Science. 2012; 337: 816-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (7123) Google Scholar). Almost immediately, several groups, including their own, determined that this new RGEN could edit DNA in the mammalian nucleus under physiological conditions. The tremendous progress that has been made since that seminal 2012 publication on the development of CRISPR-Cas RGEN-based DNA editing has been astounding and is not discussed in detail here as a recent comprehensive review on the topic is available (Doudna, 2020Doudna J.A. The promise and challenge of therapeutic genome editing.Nature. 2020; 578: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, in only 8 years the CRISPR-Cas-based RGEN has indeed been a game changer. It has revolutionized how we perform biomedical research and has left us at the dawn of a new era for treating the underlying causes of genetic disorders. Unfortunately, editing DNA rather than RNA raises both safety and ethical issues, which have been widely discussed and debated (Doudna, 2020Doudna J.A. The promise and challenge of therapeutic genome editing.Nature. 2020; 578: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Wisely, however, the first two clinical trial papers describe the use of CRISPR-Cas DNA editing in human cells harvested and treated ex vivo and then reinfused into patients to limit potential safety concerns (Xu et al., 2019Xu L. Wang J. Liu Y. Xie L. Su B. Mou D. Wang L. Liu T. Wang X. Zhang B. et al.CRISPR-Edited Stem Cells in a Patient with HIV and Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia.N Engl J Med. 2019; 381: 1240-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, Stadtmauer et al., 2020Stadtmauer E.A. Fraietta J.A. Davis M.M. Cohen A.D. Weber K.L. Lancaster E. Mangan P.A. Kulikovskaya I. Gupta M. Chen F. et al.CRISPR-engineered T cells in patients with refractory cancer.Science. 2020; 367: eaba7365Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Xu and colleagues utilized the CRISPR-Cas9 RGEN to target the HIV-1 co-receptor CCR5 gene for editing in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells removed from a matched donor of an HIV-positive patient with acute lymphocytic leukemia. Following RGEN treatment ex vivo, the allogeneic hematopoietic cells were transplanted into the cancer patient after myeloablative conditioning, to attempt to generate HIV-resistant cells in the recipient. The CCR5 edited cells were followed for 19 months, and no adverse effects induced by the RGEN editing were noted. However, only around 5% of the cells contained disrupted CCR5 genes, leading the authors to highlight the need to further improve the efficiency of the process (Xu et al., 2019Xu L. Wang J. Liu Y. Xie L. Su B. Mou D. Wang L. Liu T. Wang X. Zhang B. et al.CRISPR-Edited Stem Cells in a Patient with HIV and Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia.N Engl J Med. 2019; 381: 1240-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Similarly, Stadtmauer and colleagues utilized CRISPR-Cas9 RGENs to edit three genes in autologous T cell receptor (TCR)-engineered T cells ex vivo to enhance the ability of the anti-tumor T cells to combat cancer. TRC chains α (TRAC) and β (TRBC) genes were targeted for disruption to enhance expression and efficacy of a cancer-specific TCR transgene, and the programmed cell death protein (PDCD1) gene was targeted to improve antitumor immunity. Three patients with advanced refractory cancers underwent lymphodepleting chemotherapy, followed by infusion of RGEN-treated T cells. The modified cells persisted for 9 months, and only mild toxicity was noted, although chromosomal translocations were observed (Stadtmauer et al., 2020Stadtmauer E.A. Fraietta J.A. Davis M.M. Cohen A.D. Weber K.L. Lancaster E. Mangan P.A. Kulikovskaya I. Gupta M. Chen F. et al.CRISPR-engineered T cells in patients with refractory cancer.Science. 2020; 367: eaba7365Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Thus, to date, no major adverse events have been reported in the four cancer patients treated with CRISPR-Cas9 RGENs in these two studies. However, the long-term efficacy and safety of such RGEN-mediated DNA editing has to be evaluated in larger clinical studies over several years to determine whether such editing can improve patient outcomes and whether unintended genome editing events, such as DNA translocations, can result in pathologies. In summary, the concept of editing nucleic acids using RGENs has already changed biomedical research and is now poised to transform the treatment of many diseases. The same catalytic RNA that bolstered the theory of an RNA world, the group I ribozyme RGEN from T. thermophila, has now been utilized to edit RNAs in 15 cancer patients. An RGEN based upon the Lactococcus lactis mobile group II intron Ll.LtrB can achieve efficient gene editing in a wide variety of bacteria. However, to date, only the CRISPR-Cas or related RGENs has been able to edit DNA under physiological conditions in the mammalian nucleus, including recently in cells taken from and reintroduced into four cancer patients. Given the remarkable progress that the RGEN-mediated nucleic acid editing field has made since an RGEN was first engineered to edit a nucleic acid inside a cell just over 25 years ago, it is both awe-inspiring and humbling to consider what additional breakthroughs the RGEN editing field could accomplish in the next 25.

https://openalex.org/W3030910540,"Basic medical skills such as history taking and physical examination are essential components of clinical work profiles, but nevertheless have been neglected by conventional preclinical curricula. The near-peer-teaching program AaLplus [living anatomy plus] teaches basic medical skills, especially history taking, physical examination, and venepuncture, to preclinical students. It is a highly popular compulsory course in the first four semesters (320 students/year, 9h/semester) at Heidelberg University and ends with a formative Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) during which students receive structured in-depth feedback on their performance. AaLplus is part of the Department of General Practice's longitudinal curriculum for Family Medicine.This study aims to assess whether the AaLplus program has positive effects on students' clinical skill development and subjective confidence in history taking, physical examination and venepuncture.From 2015 to 2019, we asked all AaLplus participants to rate the program and self-assess their medical skills on 5-point Likert scales (min 1, max 5). In 4-station OSCEs, trained tutors rated the students' performance in all taught skills using standardized checklists.From 2015 to 2019 n = 1534 questionnaires returned (response rate = 98.6%, 52.7% females). After course completion, students felt able to take a patient's history (mean 3.97, SD = 0.75) and perform physical examinations (means range 3.82-4.36, SDs range 0.74-0.89) as well as venepuncture (mean 4.12, SD = 0.88). A large majority of students claimed they acquired these skills in the AaLplus program. During OSCE, 81.9% passed anamnesis, 93.1% passed physical examination, and 95.4% passed venepuncture (of n = 1556). Students mostly rated the feedback they received during the OSCE as ""helpful"" or ""very helpful"" (means for different stations 4.69-4.76, SDs 0.50-0.70).AaLplus is a positive example of a peer teaching program in the preclinical stage of medical studies. It successfully trains junior students in essential medical abilities and increases their confidence in their skills. A high percentage of students pass the formative OSCE and evaluate it positively. Consistently high ratings indicate the program's routine viability. Further studies are needed to analyze if programs like AaLplus could have an impact on the number of graduates choosing career in Family Medicine."
https://openalex.org/W3031854594,"Parasitic infections are a severe issue in many regions of the world. We assume that if a chemical can destroy a DNA barcode sequence, then this chemical could be developed as a species-specific parasiticidal agent. To test this hypothesis, we designed sgRNAs that target the sequences of both a DNA barcode (ITS-2) and a control (5.8S rDNA) in Cryptocaryon irritans. In in vivo tests, we found that exposure to Cas9 mRNA mixed with sgRNAs was able to significantly reduce the hatching rate of tomont and the survival rate of theront. Quantitative Real-time PCR demonstrated that the DNAs of tomont and theront exposed to sgRNAs and Cas9 mRNA were significantly disrupted, no matter whether they were exposed to a single sgRNA or a mixture of two sgRNAs. DNA sequencing also suggested the test group that was exposed to a single sgRNA mixed with Cas9-induced mutation at sgRNA targeted fragments and the test group exposed to two sgRNAs combined with Cas9-induced deletion of large pieces. The findings and principles provided by this study contribute to the development of novel nucleic acid therapeutic drugs for cryptocaryoniasis and other parasitic diseases and provide insight into the development of species-specific parasiticidal agents."
https://openalex.org/W3029259382,"We suggest a new method for detecting patterns of social clustering based on choice data. The method compares similar subjects within and between cohorts and thereby allows us to isolate the effect of peer influence from that of exogenous factors. Using this method on Norwegian register data, we address the question of whether students tend to cluster socially based on similar background. We find that common background correlates with making the same choices of curricular tracks, and that both exogenous preferences and peer influence matter. This applies to immigrant students from the same country, and, to some extent, to descendants of immigrants, but not to students from culturally similar countries. There are also small effects related to parents' education and income."
https://openalex.org/W3031771850,"Input devices such as motor-imagery brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are often unreliable. In theory, channel coding can be used in the human-machine loop to robustly encapsulate intention through noisy input devices but standard feedforward error correction codes cannot be practically applied. We present a practical and general probabilistic user interface for binary input devices with very high noise levels. Our approach allows any level of robustness to be achieved, regardless of noise level, where reliable feedback such as a visual display is available. In particular, we show efficient zooming interfaces based on feedback channel codes for two-class binary problems with noise levels characteristic of modalities such as motor-imagery based BCI, with accuracy <75%. We outline general principles based on separating channel, line and source coding in human-machine loop design. We develop a novel selection mechanism which can achieve arbitrarily reliable selection with a noisy two-state button. We show automatic online adaptation to changing channel statistics, and operation without precise calibration of error rates. A range of visualisations are used to construct user interfaces which implicitly code for these channels in a way that it is transparent to users. We validate our approach with a set of Monte Carlo simulations, and empirical results from a human-in-the-loop experiment showing the approach operates effectively at 50-70% of the theoretical optimum across a range of channel conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3032807886,"The online encyclopedia Wikipedia strives for objectivity and neutrality. However, Wikipedia also provides articles about negative events (e.g., earthquakes, terrorist attacks) that likely elicit strong, negative emotions. These emotions might slip into Wikipedia articles. Previous research has demonstrated that Wikipedia articles on terrorist attacks contained more anger-related content than Wikipedia articles on earthquakes. This previous research focused on the expression of emotional reactions in existing Wikipedia articles and used an automatic linguistic analysis tool that counted the number of emotion-related words. In order to extend this approach, the first aim of the present research was to replicate these findings by focusing on the emotional reactions during and after reading the articles. Second, previous research did not look at the geographical location of the negative events, which may be a relevant, influential factor. Emotional reactions may be stronger for geographically closer events (i.e., Europe for Europeans) than for geographically more distant events (i.e., Asia). Two studies, one with few raters rating their emotional reactions to many Wikipedia articles (S1 Study) and another with many raters rating their emotional reactions to few Wikipedia articles (S1 Study), demonstrated that Wikipedia articles on terrorist attacks elicited more threat, anger, sadness, and anxiety than Wikipedia articles on earthquakes. These effects occurred for negative events in Europe but were absent for events in Asia, with one exception. The anger effect was the same across Europe and Asia. Thus, event type and geographical proximity are relevant factors for explaining threat and emotional reactions to Wikipedia articles."
https://openalex.org/W3031998705,"Constructing a medical image feature database according to the category of disease can achieve a quick retrieval of images with similar pathological features. Therefore, this approach has important application values in the fields such as auxiliary diagnosis, teaching, research, and telemedicine.Based on the deep convolutional neural network, an image classifier applicable to brain disease was designed to distinguish between the image features of the different brain diseases with similar anatomical structures. Through the extraction and analysis of visual features, the images were labelled with the corresponding semantic features of a specific disease category, which can establish an association between the visual features of brain images and the semantic features of the category of disease which will permit to construct a disease category feature database of brain images.Based on the similarity measurement and the matching strategy of high-dimensional visual feature, a high-precision retrieval of brain image with semantics category was achieved, and the constructed disease category feature database of brain image was tested and evaluated through large numbers of pathological image retrieval experiments, the accuracy and the effectiveness of the proposed approach was verified.The disease category feature database of brain image constructed by the proposed approach achieved a quick and effective retrieval of images with similar pathological features, which is beneficial to the categorization and analysis of intractable brain diseases. This provides an effective application tool such as case-based image data management, evidence-based medicine and clinical decision support."
https://openalex.org/W3031352466,"With the rapid development of the Internet and the increasing popularity of mobile devices, the availability of digital image resources is increasing exponentially. How to rapidly and effectively retrieve and organize image information has been a hot issue that urgently must be solved. In the field of image retrieval, image auto-annotation remains a basic and challenging task. Targeting the drawbacks of the low accuracy rate and high memory resource consumption of current multilabel annotation methods, this study proposed a CM-supplement network model. This model combines the merits of cavity convolutions, Inception modules and a supplement network. The replacement of common convolutions with cavity convolutions enlarged the receptive field without increasing the number of parameters. The incorporation of Inception modules enables the model to extract image features at different scales with less memory consumption than before. The adoption of the supplement network enables the model to obtain the negative features of images. After 100 training iterations on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, the proposed model achieved an overall annotation accuracy rate of 94.5%, which increased by 10.0 and 1.1 percentage points compared with the traditional convolution neural network (CNN) and double-channel CNN (DCCNN). After stabilization, this model achieved an accuracy of up to 96.4%. Moreover, the number of parameters in the DCCNN was more than 1.5 times that of the CM-supplement network. Without increasing the amount of memory resources consumed, the proposed CM-supplement network can achieve comparable or even better annotation effects than a DCCNN."
