https://openalex.org/W2011634069,"Photoreceptor loss causes irreversible blindness in many retinal diseases. Repair of such damage by cell transplantation is one of the most feasible types of central nervous system repair; photoreceptor degeneration initially leaves the inner retinal circuitry intact and new photoreceptors need only make single, short synaptic connections to contribute to the retinotopic map. So far, brain- and retina-derived stem cells transplanted into adult retina have shown little evidence of being able to integrate into the outer nuclear layer and differentiate into new photoreceptors. Furthermore, there has been no demonstration that transplanted cells form functional synaptic connections with other neurons in the recipient retina or restore visual function. This might be because the mature mammalian retina lacks the ability to accept and incorporate stem cells or to promote photoreceptor differentiation. We hypothesized that committed progenitor or precursor cells at later ontogenetic stages might have a higher probability of success upon transplantation. Here we show that donor cells can integrate into the adult or degenerating retina if they are taken from the developing retina at a time coincident with the peak of rod genesis. These transplanted cells integrate, differentiate into rod photoreceptors, form synaptic connections and improve visual function. Furthermore, we use genetically tagged post-mitotic rod precursors expressing the transcription factor Nrl (ref. 6) (neural retina leucine zipper) to show that successfully integrated rod photoreceptors are derived only from immature post-mitotic rod precursors and not from proliferating progenitor or stem cells. These findings define the ontogenetic stage of donor cells for successful rod photoreceptor transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W2065943687,"When we view a scene our eyes flit from one location to another, yet our perception of the scene remains steady. Marc Sommer and Robert Wurtz report a possible mechanism that could control this perceptual stability. It involves a brain circuit that relays information on quick eye movements from the midbrain via the thalamus to the frontal cortex, where neurons alter their receptive field to anticipate their effects. Each of our movements activates our own sensory receptors, and therefore keeping track of self-movement is a necessary part of analysing sensory input. One way in which the brain keeps track of self-movement is by monitoring an internal copy, or corollary discharge, of motor commands1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13. This concept could explain why we perceive a stable visual world despite our frequent quick, or saccadic, eye movements: corollary discharge about each saccade would permit the visual system to ignore saccade-induced visual changes6,7,8,9. The critical missing link has been the connection between corollary discharge and visual processing. Here we show that such a link is formed by a corollary discharge from the thalamus that targets the frontal cortex. In the thalamus, neurons in the mediodorsal nucleus relay a corollary discharge of saccades from the midbrain superior colliculus to the cortical frontal eye field10,11,12. In the frontal eye field, neurons use corollary discharge to shift their visual receptive fields spatially before saccades14,15. We tested the hypothesis that these two components—a pathway for corollary discharge and neurons with shifting receptive fields—form a circuit in which the corollary discharge drives the shift. First we showed that the known spatial and temporal properties of the corollary discharge predict the dynamic changes in spatial visual processing of cortical neurons when saccades are made. Then we moved from this correlation to causation by isolating single cortical neurons and showing that their spatial visual processing is impaired when corollary discharge from the thalamus is interrupted. Thus the visual processing of frontal neurons is spatiotemporally matched with, and functionally dependent on, corollary discharge input from the thalamus. These experiments establish the first link between corollary discharge and visual processing, delineate a brain circuit that is well suited for mediating visual stability, and provide a framework for studying corollary discharge in other sensory systems."

A third HIV-1 lineage (group O) from west central Africa also falls within the SIVcpzPtt radiation, but the primate reservoir of this virus has not been identified. Here we report the discovery of HIV-1 group O-like viruses in wild gorillas."

https://openalex.org/W2076909664,"The recent influenza vaccine shortages have provided a timely reminder of the tenuous nature of the world's vaccine supply and the potential for manufacturing issues to severely disrupt vital access to important vaccines. The application of new technologies to the discovery, assessment, development and production of vaccines has the potential to prevent such occurrences and enable the introduction of new vaccines. Gene-based vaccines, virus-like particles, plant-derived vaccines and novel adjuvants and delivery systems represent promising approaches to creating safer, more potent vaccines. As a consequence, more people will have faster access to more effective vaccines against a broader spectrum of infectious diseases. However, the increased cost of producing new vaccines and regulatory uncertainty remain challenges for vaccine manufacturers."

https://openalex.org/W2130574102,"Patients with metastatic cancer commonly have increased serum galectin-3 concentrations, but it is not known whether this has any functional implications for cancer progression. We report that MUC1, a large transmembrane mucin protein that is overexpressed and aberrantly glycosylated in epithelial cancer, is a natural ligand for galectin-3. Recombinant galectin-3 at concentrations (0.2-1.0 μg/ml) similar to those found in the sera of patients with metastatic cancer increased adhesion of MUC1-expressing human breast (ZR-75-1) and colon (HT29-5F7) cancer cells to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) by 111% (111 ± 21%, mean ± S.D.) and 93% (93 ± 17%), respectively. Recombinant galectin-3 also increased adhesion to HUVEC of MUC1 transfected HCA1.7+ human breast epithelial cells that express MUC1 bearing the oncofetal Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen (Galβ1,3 GalNAc-α (TF)) but did not affect adhesion of MUC1-negative HCA1.7-cells. MUC1-transfected, Ras-transformed, canine kidney epithelial-like (MDE9.2+) cells, bearing MUC1 that predominantly carries sialyl-TF, only demonstrated an adhesive response to galectin-3 after sialidase pretreatment. Furthermore, galectin-3-mediated adhesion of HCA1.7+ to HUVEC was reduced by O-glycanase pretreatment of the cells to remove TF. Recombinant galectin-3 caused focal disappearance of cell surface MUC1 in HCA1.7+ cells, suggesting clustering of MUC1. Co-incubation with antibodies against E-Selectin or CD44H, but not integrin-β1, ICAM-1 or VCAM-1, largely abolished the epithelial cell adhesion to HUVEC induced by galectin-3. Thus, galectin-3, by interacting with cancer-associated MUC1 via TF, promotes cancer cell adhesion to endothelium by revealing epithelial adhesion molecules that are otherwise concealed by MUC1. This suggests a critical role for circulating galectin-3 in cancer metastasis and highlights the functional importance of altered cell surface glycosylation in cancer progression. Patients with metastatic cancer commonly have increased serum galectin-3 concentrations, but it is not known whether this has any functional implications for cancer progression.

This suggests a critical role for circulating galectin-3 in cancer metastasis and highlights the functional importance of altered cell surface glycosylation in cancer progression. Galectin-3 is one of 15 known members of the galectin family of naturally occurring galactoside-binding lectins that are expressed intracellularly and extracellularly by many cell types (1Liu F.T. Rabinovich G.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). Galectin-3 concentrations are increased up to 5-fold in the sera of patients with breast, gastrointestinal, or lung cancer (2Iurisci I. Tinari N. Natoli C. Angelucci D. Cianchetti E. Iacobelli S. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 1389-1393PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, higher galectin-3 concentrations are seen in the sera of patients with metastatic disease than in the sera of patients with localized tumors (2Iurisci I. Tinari N. Natoli C. Angelucci D. Cianchetti E. Iacobelli S. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 1389-1393PubMed Google Scholar). The source of increased circulating galectin-3 in cancer patients is not clear, but it is probably generated by tumor cells as well as by peritumoral inflammatory and stromal cells (2Iurisci I. Tinari N. Natoli C. Angelucci D. Cianchetti E. Iacobelli S. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 1389-1393PubMed Google Scholar). It is not known whether this increased circulating galectin-3 has any functional implications for cancer progression. Cytoplasmic galectin-3 is known to be anti-apoptotic (3Yang R.Y. Hsu D.K. Liu F.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6737-6742Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar), whereas nuclear galectin-3 promotes pre-mRNA splicing (4Dagher S.F. Wang J.L. Patterson R.J.

TF antigen is the core I structure of mucin-type O-linked glycans, but in its simplest nonsialylated, nonextended form it acts as an oncofetal antigen, and its presence/expression is increased in malignant and premalignant epithelia (15Campbell B.J. Finnie I.A. Hounsell E.F. Rhodes J.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 95: 571-576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MUC1 (also known as episialin and DF3) is a large (Mr > 250,000) transmembrane mucin protein expressed on the apical surface of most normal secretory epithelia including those in the mammary gland, and the gastrointestinal, respiratory, urinary, and reproductive tracts. The MUC1 extracellular domain consists of variable numbers of 20-amino acid tandem repeat peptides (VNTR) that are rich in serines, threonines, and prolines. These tandem repeat domains are heavily glycosylated with complex O-glycans (16Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Burchell J. Miles D.W. Dalziel M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1455: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). There are several splice variants of MUC1, and no functional differences between these MUC1 variants are known (17Ligtenberg M.J. Gennissen A.M. Vos H.L. Hilkens J.

In epithelial cancer cells, there is increased expression of glycoforms of MUC1 that show reduced expression of complex O-glycans and increased expression of shorter oligosaccharides such as sialic acid substituted (20Burchell J.

MUC1 also undergoes a change in its localization to become expressed over the entire surface in epithelial cancer cells (25Hilkens J. Buijs F. Hilgers J. Hageman P. Calafat J. Sonnenberg A. van der Valk M. Int. J. Cancer. 1984; 34: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 26Wesseling J. wan der walk S.W. Vos H.J. Sonnenberg A. Hilkens J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). MUC1 has been shown to interact via its cytoplasmic domain with important intracellular proteins including β-catenin (27Yamamoto M. Bharti A. Li Y. Kufe D. J. Biol.

Because of its massive size and length, ∼250 nm in comparison with ∼28 nm for typical cell surface adhesion molecules like liver cell adhesion molecule (29Becker J.W. Erickson H.P. Hoffman S. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Buijs F. Vos H.L. Hilkens J. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 2318-2324PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, overexpression of MUC1 inhibits integrin-mediated adhesion of human breast epithelial cells to extracellular matrix proteins in vitro (31Wesseling J. van der Valk S.W. Hilkens J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 565-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), and down-regulation of MUC1 by antisense oligonucleotide increases E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell aggregation of breast cancer cells (32Kondo K. Kohno N. Yokoyama A. Hiwada K. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2014-2019PubMed Google Scholar). Capping of MUC1 on the cell surface of human breast cancer cells as a result of the addition of a cross-linking anti-MUC1 antibody exposes cell adhesion molecules and increases adherence of these cells to the extracellular matrix (30Ligtenberg M.J. Buijs F. Vos H.L. Hilkens J. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 2318-2324PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we show that MUC1 is a novel and natural ligand of endogenous galectin-3 in human colon cancer cells and that recombinant galectin-3, at concentrations similar to those found in the blood of cancer patients, causes a significant increase in adhesion of epithelial cancer cells to endothelium as a consequence of its interaction with TF expressed on MUC1.

The cells were washed with PBS and treated with a nonenzymatic cell dissociation solution (Sigma) that releases the cells from the culture plates while keeping the cell membrane proteins intact. After washing, 5 × 104 cells were incubated with or without recombinant galectin-3 in the presence or absence of 50 mm lactose for 30 min at 37 °C before application for 1 h at 37 °C to a HUVEC monolayer cultured on chamber slides. The chamber slides were then gently washed with PBS and inverted for 10 min at room temperature. The slides were mounted, and the fluorescent-labeled cells were counted between three and ten randomly chosen low power fields using an Olympus B51 fluorescent microscope with a 20× objective (200× magnifications). Effect of Antibodies against Adhesion Molecules on Cell Adhesion to HUVEC—A range of monoclonal antibodies against potentially relevant adhesion molecules (E-Selectin, CD44H, Integrin-β1, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1) was incubated with HUVEC cells at 25 μg/ml for 30 min at 37 °C and remained present during the subsequent 1-h cell adhesion assay as described above. Effect of Galectin-3 on MUC1 Cell Surface Localization—Subconfluent HCA1.7+/-cells were released from the culture plates using the nonenzymatic cell dissociation solution. After washing, 104 cells were incubated with or without 0.5-1 μg/ml recombinant galectin-3 for 1 h at 37°C. The cell suspensions were then applied to polylysine-coated slides for 30 min at room temperature. After gentle washing, the cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, blocked with 5% normal goat serum/PBS, and probed with anti-MUC1 antibody, followed by fluorescent-labeled secondary antibody. MUC1 localization was visualized using an Olympus B51 fluorescent microscope. Focal rearrangement of cell surface MUC1 expression was scored by two observers blinded to the cell treatment who counted the percentage of cells lacking a continuous rim of MUC1 in eight randomly selected low power fields. Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy of Cell Adhesion to HUVEC—Samples of epithelial cells adherent to HUVEC were prepared as described above. Before introduction of recombinant galectin-3-treated HCA1.7+ cells to the HUVEC monolayer, the HUVEC cells were prelabeled with Dil (5 μl/well) cell labeling solution for 30 min at 37 °C. After interaction of the HCA1.7+/-HUVEC cells at 37 °C for 30 min, the cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 20 min, treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and then treated with 5% normal goat serum/PBS for 30 min. B27.29 anti-MUC1 antibody at 0.5 μg/ml in 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS was introduced followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody. The laser scanning confocal microscopy was performed with Leica SP2 laser scanning confocal microscope (63× water immersion objective). Sequential line by line scanning with 476- and 543-nm lasers were used to separate fluorescence of dyes. z-Stacks were prepared by obtaining serial sections with 0.5-μm increments and analyzed in orthogonal projections (x-z sections) using Leica software. Statistical Analysis—The statistical analyses were performed using unpaired t test, Fisher's exact test, or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Newman and Keuls multiple comparisons (StatsDirect for Windows, StatsDirect Ltd., Sale, United Kingdom), where appropriate. The differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. Co-immunoprecipitation of Endogenous Galectin-3 and MUC1 in HT29 Human Colon Cancer Cells—MUC1 immunoprecipitation of HT29 cell lysates using B27.29 anti-MUC1 antibody followed by immunoblotting with anti-galectin-3 antibody shows the presence of endogenous galectin-3 in MUC1 immunoprecipitates but not in the control Bcl-2 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1A). In the reciprocal experiment, galectin-3 immunoprecipitation followed by MUC1 immunoblotting also shows the presence of MUC1 in galectin-3 immunoprecipitates but not in the control immunoglobulin immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1B). These results suggest a probable interaction between galectin-3 and MUC1 in colon cancer cells. Direct Binding of Recombinant Galectin-3 to MUC1 through the Oncofetal TF Carbohydrate Antigen on MUC1—Recombinant galectin-3 probing of MUC1 immunoprecipitates from HT29 cell lysates showed that recombinant galectin-3 bound predominantly to the higher molecular weight allelic form of MUC1 (17Ligtenberg M.J. Gennissen A.M. Vos H.L. Hilkens J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, C and D). This binding was not affected if MUC1 immunoprecipitates were pretreated with N-glycanase, but binding was markedly reduced if the immunoprecipitates were pretreated with Streptococcal endo-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (O-glycanase), which is highly specific for liberating unsubstituted TF from serine or threonine residues (38Bhavanandan V.P. Umemoto J. Davidson E.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 70: 738-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of MUC1 immunoprecipitates with A. ureafaciens sialidase, which cleaves nonreducing terminal α2-3, 2-6, and 2-8-linked sialic acid from galactose, N-acetylgalactosamine and N-acetylglucosamine residues, showed the characteristic reduced mobility in SDS-PAGE that results from the removal of the negatively charged sialic acids (31Wesseling J. van der Valk S.W. Hilkens J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 565-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Desialylation of MUC1 greatly enhanced galectin-3 binding to MUC1, which was then markedly reduced following additional O-glycanase treatment. Together, these results suggest that galectin-3 interacts directly with MUC1 and that this interaction is mediated, to a large extent, by binding of galectin-3 to the unsubstituted TF disaccharide on MUC1. Recombinant Galectin-3 Enhances Epithelial Cancer Cell Adhesion to HUVEC—We next investigated the functional significance of the interaction of galectin-3 with MUC1. It had been reported previously that endothelial cell-associated galectin-3 mediates heterotypic adhesion of cancer cells to endothelium via binding to cancer-associated TF antigen expressed by unknown cell surface molecules (10Glinsky V.V.

Carcinogenesis. 2005; 6: 309-318Google Scholar). This together with the presence of increased circulating galectin-3 concentrations in cancer patients and the overexpression in cancer of MUC1 bearing increased copy numbers of unsubstituted TF, prompted us to investigate the role of the interaction between galectin-3 and cancer-associated MUC1 in cancer cell adhesion to endothelium. We therefore preincubated MUC1-expressing epithelial cancer cells with recombinant galectin-3 at various concentrations and subsequently tested the adhesion of the cells to HUVECs. It was found that galectin-3 at concentrations (0.2-1.0 μg/ml) similar to those found in patients with metastatic breast or colon cancer induces a significant increase of cancer cell adhesion of human breast cancer cells to the HUVEC monolayer. At 1 μg/ml, recombinant galectin-3 increased adhesion of ZR-75-1 human breast cancer cells to HUVEC by 111% (111 ± 21%, mean ± S.D., p < 0.001, ANOVA) (Fig. 2). At similar concentration, recombinant galectin-3 caused little change of the adhesion of parental (standard) HT29 cells (data not shown) but 93% (93 ± 17%, p < 0.001, ANOVA) increased adhesion of HT29-5F7, a subpopulation of HT29 cells that have greater MUC1 expression than the parental HT29 cells (35Leteurtre E.

In the absence of galectin-3, an average of 35 (35 ± 5) ZR-75-1 cells and 41 (41 ± 5) HT29-5F7 cells were adherent per randomly selected low power field. The increased adhesion"
https://openalex.org/W2032408942,"Electrical conductance is quantized in units of $\sigma_{\rm Q}=2e^2/h$ in ballistic one-dimensional conductors. Similarly, thermal conductance at temperature $T$ is expected to be limited by the quantum of thermal conductance of one mode, $G_{\rm Q} = \frac{\pi k_{\rm B}^2}{6\hbar}T$, when physical dimensions are small in comparison to characteristic wavelength of the carriers. The relation between $\sigma_{\rm Q}$ and $G_{\rm Q}$ obeys the Wiedemann-Franz law for ballistic electrons (apart from factor 2 in $\sigma_{\rm Q}$ due to spin degeneracy), but somewhat amazingly the same expression of $G_{\rm Q}$ is expected to hold also for phonons and photons, or any other particles with arbitrary exclusion statistics. The single-mode heat conductance is particularly relevant in nano-structures, e.g., when studying heat conduction by phonons in dielectric materials, or cooling of electrons in metals at very low temperatures. Here we show, based on our experimental results, that at low temperatures heat is transferred by photon radiation, in our case along a superconducting line, when electron-phonon as well as normal electronic heat conduction are frozen out. Thermal conductance is limited by $G_{\rm Q}$, approaching this value towards low temperatures. Our observation has implications on, e.g., performance and design of ultra-sensitive bolometers and electronic micro-refrigerators, whose operation is largely dependent on weak thermal coupling between the device and its environment."

How sHSPs interact with substrates remains poorly defined. To investigate the role of the conserved C-terminal α-crystallin domain versus the variable N-terminal arm in substrate interactions, we compared two closely related dodecameric plant sHSPs, Hsp18.1 and Hsp16.9, and four chimeras of these two sHSPs, in which all or part of the N-terminal arm was switched. The efficiency of substrate protection and formation of sHSP-substrate complexes by these sHSPs with three different model substrates, firefly luciferase, citrate synthase, and malate dehydrogenase (MDH) provide new insights into sHSP/substrate interactions. Results indicate that different substrates have varying affinities for different domains of the sHSP. For luciferase and citrate synthase, the efficiency of substrate protection was determined by the identity of the N-terminal arm in the chimeric proteins. In contrast, for MDH, efficient protection clearly required interactions with the α-crystallin domain in addition to the N-terminal arm. Furthermore, we show that sHSP-substrate complexes with varying stability and composition can protect substrate equally, and substrate protection is not correlated with sHSP oligomeric stability for all substrates. Protection of MDH by the dimeric chimera composed of the Hsp16.9 N-terminal arm and Hsp18.1 α-crystallin domain supports the model that a dimeric form of the sHSP can bind and protect substrate.

Slingsby C. Vierling E. Adv. Protein Chem. 2002; 59: 105-156Crossref Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Flanking this domain is a short C-terminal extension and an N-terminal arm of variable length and highly divergent sequence (1van Montfort R. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Adv.

Although the monomeric size of the sHSPs ranges from 15 to 42 kDa, in their native state most sHSPs assemble into large oligomers of 8 to >32 subunits, although there are also dimeric and tetrameric sHSPs (1van Montfort R.

Studies with numerous sHSPs from different organisms have shown that in vitro these proteins act as chaperones by binding to partially unfolded proteins in an ATP-independent manner, preventing their irreversible aggregation (1van Montfort R.

In vivo, increased expression of these ubiquitous stress proteins can enhance cellular tolerance to a variety of stresses, such as heat, salt, drugs, and oxidants (1van Montfort R. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Adv. Protein Chem. 2002; 59: 105-156Crossref Scopus (386) Google Scholar). sHSPs have also been reported to act as negative regulators of apoptosis, to modulate cellular redox state, and to be linked to increased organism longevity (8Arrigo A.P.

Science. 2003; 300: 1142-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). Consistent with their proposed chaperone function, sHSPs are associated with protein aggregates in a number of human diseases, including cataract, neurogenerative diseases, and myopathies (11Sun Y. MacRae T.H. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2613-2627Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Defining the molecular mechanism of sHSP action is key to understanding how these chaperones can participate in such diverse cellular processes. Critical to their proposed mode of action as chaperones is the ability of sHSPs to interact with denaturing substrates. sHSPs have been shown to have a very large capacity for substrate binding, maintaining an equal weight of some denatured substrates in a soluble form (1van Montfort R. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Adv. Protein Chem. 2002; 59: 105-156Crossref Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Model substrates protected in vitro as well as proteins found associated with sHSPs in vivo include proteins of a wide range of molecular weights, pI values, and structures, with no obvious common characteristics (12Basha E.

The most well documented aspect of sHSP-substrate interaction comes from multiple experiments showing that sHSP substrate binding capacity is enhanced by structural changes that expose hydrophobic surfaces that are normally occluded in the native sHSP oligomeric structure (1van Montfort R. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Adv. Protein Chem. 2002; 59: 105-156Crossref Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Putative substrate binding sites may become available through dissociation of sHSP oligomers to dimers as a result of the dynamic equilibrium of sHSP subunits between oligomeric and suboligomeric species or through more subtle environmentally induced (e.g. high temperature) changes in sHSP tertiary structure (1van Montfort R. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Adv. Protein Chem. 2002; 59: 105-156Crossref Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 5Haslbeck M. Franzmann T. Weinfurtner D. Buchner J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 842-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). The potential overlap of oligomeric interfaces with substrate interaction sites has proven problematic for separating these two functions. Determining specific substrate binding sites on sHSPs is further complicated by the large size and heterogeneity of sHSP-substrate complexes. sHSP-substrate complex architecture, as observed by electron microscopy or size exclusion chromatography, varies with the identity of the sHSP, the ratio of sHSP to substrate, substrate identity, and how substrate is denatured (6Mogk A.

A variety of experimental approaches with different sHSPs or α-crystallins assayed with different model substrates has been used to identify potential substrate binding sites on these chaperones but has not led to any coherent model. The conserved α-crystallin domain has been implicated in substrate binding in a number of studies. There is good evidence that the α-crystallin domain shares a common structure in all members of this family consisting of a seven-stranded, IgG-like β-sandwich with topology identical to p23 (1van Montfort R.

Similarly, a range of studies point to the evolutionarily variable N-terminal arm as essential for substrate interactions. sHSPs with a naturally short N-terminal arm or an N terminus truncated by mutagenesis most often lack chaperone function (29Leroux M.R.

However, because the oligomeric structure of most of these variants is also disrupted (or naturally limited to dimer or tetramer), discriminating between differences in structure versus substrate binding as the primary cause of the defect remains a problem. Because current models suggest sHSP subunits must reassemble in some fashion after substrate binding, disruption of oligomeric structure could also impact this step (1van Montfort R. Slingsby C.

Bis-ANS also binds the N-terminal arm, reducing sHSP chaperone activity potentially by blocking substrate interactions (21Lee G.J. Roseman A.M. Saibil H.R. Vierling E.

The evolutionary variation in the N-terminal arm could also be interpreted as accounting for species or sHSP-specific functions of these proteins, pointing to a role in substrate interactions, and sHSP structural data reveal properties of the N-terminal arm that would be advantageous for this function. Half or all of the N-terminal arms of sHSP subunits in Hsp16.9 (18van Montfort R.L. Basha E. Friedrich K.L. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar) and Hsp16.5 (17Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 394: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar) are unresolved in the crystal structure, and cryo-EM images of α-crystallins indicate the arms are disordered (34Haley D.A. Bova M.P. Huang Q.-L. Mchaourab H.S. Stewart P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), implying flexibility to accommodate association with different substrates. The N-terminal arms would also be free to bind substrates when the sHSP oligomer dissociates (18van Montfort R.L. Basha E. Friedrich K.L. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). To further address the question of the relative importance of the N-terminal arm and α-crystallin domain in substrate interactions, we created chimeras of two very closely related dodecameric sHSPs, wheat Hsp16.9 and pea (Pisum sativum) HSP18.1. Studies of these proteins individually have suggested that there are significant differences in their relative abilities to protect firefly luciferase (Luc) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH) from insolubilization (15Basha E. Lee G.J. Demeler B. Vierling E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 1426-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 21Lee G.J. Roseman A.M. Saibil H.R. Vierling E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Availability of the 2.65-Å resolution x-ray structure of the Hsp16.9 dodecamer (18van Montfort R.L. Basha E. Friedrich K.L. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar) along with data demonstrating that these two sHSPs are fully compatible to form heterododecamers (35Sobott F. Benesch J.L. Vierling E. Robinson C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38921-38929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) made this an attractive system for constructing chimeric sHSPs. We created four chimeric proteins, switching either the entire N-terminal arm or the first 10 residues of Hsp18.1 with the corresponding region of Hsp16.9, and characterized the oligomeric structure and chaperone activity of the purified recombinant proteins compared with the parental wild types. We observed decreased oligomeric stability of some of the chimeras, illustrating the importance of contacts within an sHSP monomer for proper assembly of sHSP quaternary structure. However, oligomeric stability did not correlate with chaperone activity as analyzed with three different substrates (Luc, citrate synthase (CS), and MDH). Furthermore, the role of the N-terminal arm in substrate protection was not the same for the different substrates. The identity of the N-terminal arm determined the effectiveness of Luc and CS protection by the sHSP but was not the determining factor in MDH protection. In total the results provide new insight into the complexity of sHSP-substrate interactions. Construction of Chimeric sHSPs—Chimeric sHSPs were created in which the entire N-terminal arms of wheat Hsp16.9 (accession number CAA45902) and pea Hsp18.1 (accession number P19243) were exchanged (see Fig. 1). A site-specific mutation was made in the Hsp16.9 coding sequence in the pJC20 expression plasmid (AZ388) to remove an AvaI site in the C-terminal region of the gene (the third base of Glu-143 codon was changed from G to A). The third base of the Gly-63 codon in Hsp16.9 was then changed from C to G to create a new AvaI site at this position, and the third base of the Pro-69 codon in Hsp18.1 (also in the pJC20 expression plasmid (AZ316) was changed from T to C to create a complementary AvaI site for the exchange of the N termini. The new plasmids were cut with AvaI, which also cuts at a site in the DNA beyond the coding region in both plasmids, and the smaller of the two fragments from each digest was extracted from the gel and ligated to the opposite plasmid. The resulting plasmids encoded chimeric proteins that were designated N18C16 and N16C18. Note that because of amino acid sequence identity between residues 47 and 62 of Hsp16.9 with residues 54 and 69 of Hsp18.1 the effective exchange was of 46 residues of Hsp16.9 for 53 residues of Hsp18.1 (Fig. 1). Two other chimeric proteins were created to switch only the first four residues of Hsp16.9 with the first 10 residues from Hsp18.1 as shown in Fig. 1. These resulting chimeric proteins were designated “short” N18-C16 (sN18-C16) or short N16-C18 (sN16-C18). The chimeric sN16-C18 was created using the primers 5′-AATCGACATATGTACATCTCCTTCT-3′ and 5′-GTCCGAAGGAGCAATGTTTTCGAT-3′ to amplify the entire Hsp18.1 plasmid followed by ligation to recircularize the plasmid. The N18-C16 chimera was created using AGTTTCTTCAGCGGGAGGCGGAGCAACGTGTTC and GGGGATCAGCGACATATGTACATCTCCTTCTTA primers to amplify the entire Hsp16.9 plasmid followed by ligation to recircularize the plasmid. Plasmids with the correct sequence were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Protein Purification—All sHSPs were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described in Basha et al. (15Basha E. Lee G.J. Demeler B. Vierling E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 1426-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the calculated extinction coefficient of ϵ280 = 16,500 m–1 cm–1 for all proteins. The expected molecular mass of each of the chimeric proteins was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Aggregation Protection Assay—Luc (1 μm), MDH (3 μm), or CS (2 μm) were incubated with different concentrations of sHSP at the described temperature and duration in siliconized microcentrifuge tubes. The final buffer conditions for these experiments were 150 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5. After heating, samples were briefly cooled on ice and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and mixed with an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer (1× = 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 60 mm dithiothreitol, 2.0% (w/v) SDS, 15% (w/v) sucrose, 5 mm ϵ-amino-N-caproic acid, 1.0 mm benzamidine, and 0.144 mm bromphenol blue). The pellet was washed with 1 ml of reaction buffer and centrifuged as described above. The wash was removed, and the pellet was resolubilized with 1× SDS sample buffer to the same final volume as the supernatant fraction. Equal fractions were loaded on 15% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue (15Basha E. Lee G.J. Demeler B. Vierling E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 1426-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC)—For analysis of sHSP-substrate complexes substrate proteins were incubated with different sHSP concentrations at the temperatures and times specified in the figure legends. Samples were cooled on ice and then centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 rpm. The supernatant (100 μl) was loaded onto a Bio-Sil SEC 400 column (Bio-Rad) and eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The mobile phase used in all experiments contained 25 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5. To determine the oligomeric state of the sHSPs, sHSPs at the stated concentrations were centrifuged to remove any aggregated protein, and the supernatant was loaded over the SEC column the same way. Standards were thyroglobulin (670 kDa), γ-globulin (158 kDa), ovalbumin (44 kDa), and myoglobin (17 kDa) (Bio-Rad). Western Analysis of SEC Fractions—sHSP·Luc complexes were prepared and subjected to SEC as described above. Fractions were collected every 30 s from 5.5 to 11.5 min. Samples were mixed with an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer and separated on 15% SDS-PAGE. Regions from the same gel, which corresponded to the molecular weight of either Luc or the sHSPs, were processed for Western analysis using either Luc antibody (the upper part of the gel) or both Hsp18.1 and Hsp16.9 antibodies (the lower part of the gel). Antibody reactions were visualized by chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Luc Refolding Assay—Luc (1 μm) was incubated with different sHSP concentrations in the previously described buffer at 42 °C for 9 min. Luc reactivation was carried out as described in Giese and Vierling (36Giese K.C. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46310-46318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Creation of Chimeric sHSPs—Amino acid sequence alignment (Fig. 1A) revealed that from residue 45 or 54 of wheat Hsp16.9 or pea Hsp18.1, respectively, through the C terminus, the proteins are 80% identical and 86% similar. In contrast, the remaining N-terminal region was only 41% identical and 50% similar, and the Hsp18.1 N terminus had a 6-residue insertion (residues 5–10) that is missing in Hsp16.9. The high conservation of the C-terminal α-crystallin domain compared with the variation in the N terminus suggests that differences in chaperone activity of these sHSPs may result from N-terminal differences and implicates the N-terminal arm in substrate interactions. To address this hypothesis we created two sets of chimeric proteins between Hsp16.9 and Hsp18.1. These two sHSPs have been shown previously to co-assemble into fully heterogeneous oligomers, with a random equilibrium distribution of subunits of either sHSP (35Sobott F. Benesch J.L. Vierling E. Robinson C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38921-38929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), indicating that their higher order oligomeric contacts are compatible. As predicted from the Hsp16.9 structure, in the chimeras created all H-bonding, ionic, and hydrophobic contacts involved in the monomer-monomer interface that forms the dimeric building block of the oligomer are conserved (see Fig. 1 and supplemental Table 1). Important interdimer contacts made by C-terminal arm residues 132–151 of Hsp16.9 or 139–158 of Hsp18.1 with residues in the α-crystallin domain were also unaltered by creation of the chimeras (supplemental Table 1). It is more difficult to assess affects on other contacts between dimers in the chimeras, as a number of interactions involve N-terminal residues, which although conserved, are spaced differently due to the six-amino acid insertion in Hsp18.1. However, the co-assembly data (35Sobott F. Benesch J.L. Vierling E. Robinson C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38921-38929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) argue that these contacts are compatible in the chimeras. Thus, the chimeras should constitute a valid model to test the relative importance of the N-terminal arm and α-crystallin domains in sHSP chaperone activity. In the first set of chimeras the entire non-conserved N-terminal region was switched to create the two chimeras N18-C16 and N16-C18, as shown in Fig. 1B. A second set of chimeras was designed to test the importance of the six-residue insertion in Hsp18.1 by switching the first 10 amino acids of Hsp18.1 with the first 4 amino acids of Hsp16.9, creating sN18-C16 and sN16-C18. All four of these chimeras were soluble when expressed in E. coli and could be purified to >95% homogeneity. Chimeras with the Hsp16.9 N Terminus Show Concentration-dependent Oligomerization—The chaperone activity of sHSPs has been linked to the ability of the proteins to oligomerize and to the dynamic equilibrium of sHSP native oligomers with suboligomeric forms (1van Montfort R. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Adv. Protein Chem. 2002; 59: 105-156Crossref Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 5Haslbeck M. Franzmann T. Weinfurtner D. Buchner J. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Therefore, we first examined the oligomeric state of the parent wild-type and chimeric sHSPs by SEC at concentrations of 6, 12, and 36 μm (Fig. 2). As expected, all of Hsp18.1 and most of Hsp16.9 eluted as dodecamers at all concentrations tested, although Hsp16.9 had a small shoulder. The chimeras with the Hsp18.1 N terminus, N18-C16 and sN18-C16, exhibited behavior most similar to Hsp18.1, remaining essentially oligomeric at all concentrations, although they had detectable, more slowly eluting shoulders. In contrast, oligomeric structure of the chimeras with the Hsp16.9 N terminus (N16-C18 and sN16-C18) showed a significant dependence on concentration. N16-C18 is the most impaired protein with respect to oligomerization; at 6 μm all of the protein eluted at a position consistent with a dimeric structure, and even at 36 μm a significant fraction eluted at the position of a dimer. Although sN16-C18 behaved primarily as an oligomer at 36 μm, the oligomer was less stable than either parent sHSP, showing little intact oligomer at 6 μm. Because intact Hsp18.1 and Hsp16.9 readily hetero-oligomerize to form dodecamers, the instability of chimeras with all or"

In this study, we show that the active NOTCH1 intracellular domain is absent in human MTC tumor tissue samples and MTC-TT cells. To determine the effects of NOTCH1 expression, we created a doxycycline-inducible NOTCH1 intracellular domain in MTC cells (TT-NOTCH cells). Treatment of TT-NOTCH cells with doxycycline led to dose-dependent induction of NOTCH1 protein with corresponding decreases in ASCL1 protein and NE hormones. ASCL1 promoter-reporter assay and Northern analysis revealed that ASCL1 reduction by NOTCH1 activation is predominantly via silencing of ASCL1 gene transcription. Overexpression of ASCL1 in MTC cells indicated that CgA expression is highly dependent on the levels of ASCL1. This was further confirmed by experiments using small interfering RNA against ASCL1, in which reduction in ASCL1 led to reduction in both CgA and calcitonin. Furthermore, we demonstrate that NOTCH1 signaling activation leads to ERK1/2 phosphorylation, but that reduction in NE markers is independent of ERK1/2 activation. Activation of NOTCH1 resulted in significant MTC cell growth inhibition. Notably, reduction in MTC cell growth was dependent on the level of NOTCH1 protein present. Moreover, no increase in growth upon expression of ASCL1 in NOTCH1-activated cells was observed, indicating that the growth suppression observed upon NOTCH1 activation is independent of ASCL1 reduction.

Eighty percent of all MTCs are sporadic in nature, and the remaining 20% are familial and caused by germ line mutations in the RET proto-oncogene (2Chen H. Roberts J.R. Ball D.W. Eisele D.W.

Although development of RET gene testing has allowed for early prophylactic thyroidectomy for patients with familial MTC, the majority of patients with sporadic MTC have persistent or recurrent disease after surgery because the natural history of MTC is characterized by early metastasis. Understanding the molecular pathways that control MTC and C-cell development and proliferation is essential for the development of novel therapies for patients with advanced MTC. Like other NE tumors, MTC cells secrete various hormones and NE markers such as calcitonin and chromogranin A (CgA) (4Chen H. Kunnimalaiyaan M. Van Gompel J.J. Thyroid. 2005; 15: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, MTC cells express high levels of ASCL1 (achaete-scute complex-like 1, also known as human ASH1 (achaete-scute homolog-1)), an evolutionarily conserved basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that seems to be limited to NE tumors (5Sippel R.S.

Several recent studies suggest that ASCL1 appears to be critical for C-cell development and may play an important role in MTC tumor growth and NE differentiation. Ash1 transgenic knock-out mice fail to develop thyroid C-cells, which suggests that mASH1 is essential for normal C-cell development (9Lanigan T.M. DeRaad S.K. Russo A.F. J. Neurobiol. 1998; 34: 126-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Raf-1 activation in human MTC cells also leads to significant reductions in ASCL1, CgA, calcitonin, and growth (1Chen H. Carson-Walter E.B. Baylin S.B. Nelkin B.D. Ball D.W.

In addition, ASCL1 plays an important role in the development of other NE cells such as adrenal chromaffin cells and pulmonary endocrine cells (11Guillemot F. Nagy A. Auerbach A. Rossant J.

These findings also indicate that pathway(s) that regulate ASCL1 may also regulate MTC cell growth and differentiation. During development, ASCL1 expression is tightly controlled by the NOTCH1 signaling pathway (for reviews, see Refs. 14Maillard I. Pear W.S.

However, the degree of NOTCH1 activation required to achieve growth suppression is unclear because most of the studies utilized transient expression with very high levels of active NOTCH1. In this study, we demonstrate the critical role of NOTCH1 in controlling both cell proliferation and the NE phenotype in MTC cells. We show that NOTCH1 protein is undetectable in human MTC tumor samples and cells. However, high levels of ASCL1 and CgA were found in the MTC cell line and tumor specimens. To determine the effects of NOTCH1 expression, we created a doxycycline-inducible NOTCH1 intracellular domain (NICD) construct in MTC cells (TT-NOTCH cells). Using this doxycycline-inducible in vitro model, we assessed the dose-dependent effects of NOTCH1 on MTC cell growth. Expression of NICD resulted in significant inhibition of MTC cell proliferation. Notably, the degree of tumor cell growth inhibition was directly proportional to the amount of NOTCH1 protein present. Notably, NOTCH1 activation also caused reductions in the levels of calcitonin and CgA. Furthermore, we show for the first time by transient overexpression of ASCL1 in MTC cells that CgA levels are directly correlated with ASCL1 protein levels. The fact that transfection of small interfering RNA (siRNA) against ASCL1 in MTC cells resulted in a proportional reduction in CgA further confirms that the level of CgA is tightly regulated by ASCL1. Finally, we report that activation of NOTCH1 also leads to the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in a dose-dependent manner, but that active ERK1/2 is not required for ASCL1-mediated suppression of NE markers. Human Tissue Samples—Human MTC tumor samples and other control tumor samples were collected, and tumor histology was verified by pathological review. Samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at –80 °C for long-term storage. Tumor cell lysates were prepared from the frozen samples by grinding in liquid nitrogen. The powder was then lysed with lysis buffer as described (24Sippel R.S. Carpenter J.E. Kunnimalaiyaan M. Lagerholm S. Chen H. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: G245-G254Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The lysates were analyzed by Western blotting for NOTCH1, ASCL1, and CgA as described below. Cell Culture—Human MTC (TT) cells were obtained from Dr. Barry D. Nelkin (The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 16% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 100 IU/ml penicillin (Invitrogen), and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C (1Chen H. Carson-Walter E.B. Baylin S.B. Nelkin B.D. Ball D.W. Surgery. 1996; 120: 168-172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 10Park J.I. Strock C.J. Ball D.W. Nelkin B.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 543-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Doxycycline-inducible cell lines were maintained similar to TT cells except that tetracycline-free fetal bovine serum (Clontech), 0.4 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen), and 0.4 μg/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen) were used. Doxycycline-inducible NOTCH1—The Tet-On expression system was obtained from Clontech. A 2.3-kb BamHI-XhoI fragment containing NICD (amino acids 1759–2556) from pTAN1-cDNA was subcloned into the pRevTRE vector at the BamHI/SalI sites. The cloned construct (pRevTRE-NOTCH1) was confirmed by DNA sequencing. To create an inducible TT-NOTCH cell line, TT cells were first transfected with plasmid pRevTet-On (Clontech) containing the Tet-responsive transcriptional activator using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and selected in medium containing 0.4 μg/ml G418. The resulting 12 G418-resistant, TT-Tet-on clones were screened for doxycycline-dependent inducibility of the reporter gene luciferase by transient transfection of the pRevTRE-Luc vector into TT-Tet-on clones. A clone with low background, which reproducibly induced the luciferase gene by >60-fold, was maintained and used for transfection with the response plasmid containing the NOTCH1 (NICD) gene (pRevTRE-NOTCH1) and the empty vector (pRevTRE). TT-Tet-on cells were transfected with pRevTRE-NOTCH1 and the pRevTRE empty vector using Lipofectamine 2000. Transfected cells were selected in 0.4 μg/ml hygromycin. Resistant TT-NOTCH and TT-TRE (vector alone) clones were treated with 1 μg/ml doxycycline for 48 h and screened for the presence of NOTCH1 protein by Western blot analysis. Western Blot Analysis—Cell pellets were lysed in sample buffer as described (24Sippel R.S. Carpenter J.E. Kunnimalaiyaan M. Lagerholm S. Chen H. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: G245-G254Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Total cellular protein concentrations were determined using a BCA assay kit (Pierce). Cell extracts (20–30 μg) were boiled with equal amounts of loading dye (24Sippel R.S. Carpenter J.E. Kunnimalaiyaan M. Lagerholm S. Chen H. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: G245-G254Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) for 10 min and separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schüll) by electroblotting. Membranes were blocked in milk and incubated with primary and secondary antibodies as described (24Sippel R.S. Carpenter J.E. Kunnimalaiyaan M. Lagerholm S. Chen H. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: G245-G254Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The following primary antibodies at the indicated dilutions were used: anti-NOTCH1 (1:500); anti-HA probe (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); anti-MASH1 (mammalian ASH1) to detect ASCL1 (1:1000; Pharmingen); anti-HES-1 (Hairy Enhancer of Split-1; 1:10,000; a kind gift from Tetsuo Sudo, Toray Industries, Inc., Kanagawa, Japan); anti-CgA (1:1000; Zymed Laboratories Inc.); anti-phospho-ERK1/2, anti-ERK1/2, anti-p21, anti-p27, anti-cyclin D1, anti-Cdk4, and anti-Cdc2 phospho-Tyr15 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA); and anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; 1:10,000; Trevigen, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Primary antibody incubations were kept overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were then washed with wash buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline and 0.01% Tween 20) and incubated with a 1:500 dilution of goat anti-rabbit (for NOTCH1, HES-1, CgA, and GAPDH) or goat anti-mouse (for MASH1) secondary antibody (Pierce) coupled with horseradish peroxidase. The membranes were washed with wash buffer and developed with Immun-Star (Bio-Rad) for HES-1, CgA, and GAPDH or with SuperSignal West Femto chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) for MASH1, cell cycle inhibitors, and NOTCH1 according to the manufacturers' directions. NOTCH1 Functional Analysis—Plasmids containing four copies of either the wild-type or mutant CBF1-binding elements in pGL2pro (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) were obtained from Dr. Diane Hayward (The Johns Hopkins University). TT-NOTCH cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 16% tetracycline-free fetal bovine serum, 0.4 μg/ml hygromycin, and 0.4 μg/ml G418. Cells grown overnight were cotransfected with 1 μg of wild-type or mutant CBF1 plasmid and 0.5 μg of plasmid containing the β-galactosidase gene driven by the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (CMV-β-galactosidase plasmid) as an internal control for transfection efficiency. The next day, cells were treated with or without doxycycline and incubated for 2 days to induce NOTCH1. The cells were then lysed, and luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were carried out as recommended by Promega Corp. using a luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, Ann Arbor, MI) and a plate reader, respectively. Luciferase activity was determined relative to the expression calculated by the wild type over the mutant (25Hsieh J.J. Henkel T. Salmon P. Robey E. Peterson M.G. Hayward S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 952-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed in triplicate at least twice. Cell Proliferation Assay and Calcitonin Measurement—To measure the proliferation rate, cells were plated in triplicate in 6-well plates, and the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was performed as described (20Kunnimalaiyaan M. Traeger K. Chen H. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: G636-G642PubMed Google Scholar, 26Van Gompel J.J. Kunnimalaiyaan M. Holen K. Chen H. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2005; 4: 910-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The cells were treated with or without doxycycline at various concentrations for the indicated number of days. Experiments were performed at least twice. To determine the amount of calcitonin in cell extracts, we utilized a calcitonin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (BIOSOURCE) following the manufacturer's instructions. Calcitonin values were standardized and quantified relative to control cell extracts. Samples were analyzed in triplicate. Transfection, Reporter Assays, and siRNA Experiments—To determine the effect of ASCL1 on the level of CgA, TT-NOTCH cells were transiently transfected with plasmid pcDNA3.0 containing the CMV promoter-derived ASCL1 gene fused with an HA tag (a kind gift from Dr. Douglas W. Ball, The Johns Hopkins University) using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's directions. The next day, transfected cells were treated with or without doxycycline for 2 days, and cell lysates were prepared and analyzed for the levels of ASCL1 and CgA by Western analysis. Luciferase Assay for the ASCL1 Promoter—The ASCL1 promoter DNA fragment (–7900 to +37) containing the 5′-flanking region of ASCL1 genomic DNA, including the HES-1-binding site, was cloned into the luciferase reporter gene in pGL2 (Promega Corp.) (27Chen H. Thiagalingam A. Chopra H. Borges M.W. Feder J.N. Nelkin B.D. Baylin S.B. Ball D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5355-5360Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Transfection of the ASCL1 promoter DNA showed a reduction in luciferase activity in the presence of HES-1 expression (27Chen H. Thiagalingam A. Chopra H. Borges M.W. Feder J.N. Nelkin B.D. Baylin S.B. Ball D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5355-5360Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of NOTCH1 activation on ASCL1 transcription, we transiently transfected the plasmid containing the luciferase gene under the control of the ASCL1 promoter (27Chen H. Thiagalingam A. Chopra H. Borges M.W. Feder J.N. Nelkin B.D. Baylin S.B. Ball D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5355-5360Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) into TT-NOTCH cells. Plasmids pGL2-Control (positive control for luciferase) and pGL2-Basic (negative control) were also transfected into TT-NOTCH cells as controls. In addition, the CMV-β-galactosidase plasmid was also cotransfected into TT-NOTCH cells to normalize the transfection. The next day, the medium was changed with or without doxycycline to activate NOTCH1 for 2 days. Cell lysates were then prepared and analyzed for luciferase activity as described (20Kunnimalaiyaan M. Traeger K. Chen H. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: G636-G642PubMed Google Scholar). ASCL1 siRNA—To determine the effect of ASCL1 on CgA, siRNA against ASCL1 (catalog no. sc-37692, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and nonspecific siRNA (catalog no. sc-37007) were transfected into TT cells using Lipofectamine 2000 as described by the manufacturer. After 2 days of incubation, cell lysates were prepared and analyzed for the levels of ASCL1 and CgA proteins by Western analysis. Growth Rescue Experiment—To determine the importance of ASCL1 in NOTCH1-mediated growth suppression, we carried out the MTT assay. Briefly, TT-NOTCH cells grown overnight were transfected with plasmid pcDNA 3.0 containing the CMV promoter-derived ASCL1 gene fused with an HA tag using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's directions. The next day, cells were trypsinized, and equal numbers of cells were plated onto 24-well plates and incubated overnight. The following day, the cells were treated with or without doxycycline (1 μg/ml) and incubated for 4 days, and the MTT assay was then carried out as described above. Northern Analysis—To study the effect of NOTCH1 on ASCL1 transcription, TT-NOTCH cells were treated with doxycycline (0, 0.2, 0.5, and 1 μg/ml) at indicated time points, and total RNA was isolated using an RNA isolation kit (Qiagen Inc.). Ten micrograms of this RNA was separated on denaturing 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred onto positively charged nylon membrane (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX). DNA probes using ASCL1 and GAPDH DNAs were made using a random primer labeling kit (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA). The probes were denatured and hybridized with the membrane using a standard protocol (24Sippel R.S. Carpenter J.E. Kunnimalaiyaan M. Lagerholm S. Chen H. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: G245-G254Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Analysis of variance with Bonferroni's post hoc test (SPSS Version 10.0 software, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was utilized for statistical analysis. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. Unless noted, data are represented as the means ± S.E. Expression of NOTCH1 Components in MTC Tumors—We demonstrated previously the presence of ASCL1 mRNA in MTC, carcinoid, and pheochromocytoma cells by Northern analysis (7Chen H. Udelsman R. Zeiger M.A. Ball D.A. Oncol. Rep. 1997; 4: 775-778PubMed Google Scholar). However, the protein levels of ASCL1 in human tumor samples have not been determined. Fig. 1 shows significant amounts of ASCL1 protein present in six human MTC tumors (four sporadic and two multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A patients) as well as in human MTC (TT) cells. However, ASCL1 is not present in non-NE tumor tissues such as papillary thyroid cancer samples (Fig. 1). Furthermore, as expected, expression of the NE marker CgA is restricted to NE tumors (MTC). Given the importance of NOTCH1 signaling and its role in ASCL1, we expected a lack of active NOTCH1 (NICD) protein in these NE tumors. As shown in Fig. 1, MTC tumors lack NICD protein. In contrast, NOTCH1 is expressed in papillary thyroid cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma tissues. Because cleaved active NOTCH1 is absent in MTC tumors and cells, we hypothesized that overexpression of active NOTCH1 (NICD) in MTC cells may down-regulate ASCL1 and possibly affect cell growth and/or differentiation. Thus, we created a doxycycline-inducible NICD (NOTCH1) system in TT cells. Dose-dependent Functional NOTCH1 Expression in TT-NOTCH Cells—To determine the inducibility of NICD by doxycycline in TT-NOTCH cells, we carried out Western analysis after treatment with various concentrations of doxycycline. As shown in Fig. 2A, there was no detectable NOTCH1 protein in TT-NOTCH cells in the absence of doxycycline. However, treatment of TT-NOTCH cells with doxycycline led to an induction of NOTCH1 protein. Notably, the amount of NOTCH1 protein was proportional to the dose of doxycycline. To determine the functionality of NOTCH1 protein in TT cells, we utilized a well described reporter system in which binding of NOTCH1 leads to high levels of luciferase expression (25Hsieh J.J. Henkel T. Salmon P. Robey E. Peterson M.G. Hayward S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 952-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). CBF1/RBP-Jκ (recombination signal-binding protein 1 for J-κ) is the best characterized downstream effector of NOTCH1 in mammals (25Hsieh J.J. Henkel T. Salmon P. Robey E. Peterson M.G. Hayward S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 952-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 28Ronchini C. Capobianco A.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3914-3924Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Fig. 2B shows that NOTCH1 activation increased the relative -fold induction of luciferase activity. This increase in luciferase activity was dependent on the amount of doxycycline used. However, in the absence of doxycycline, there was a minimal amount of luciferase activity, suggesting the lack of functional NOTCH1 activity (Fig. 2B). Taken together, the results of the Western and NOTCH1 functional analyses clearly suggest that NOTCH1 protein produced after doxycycline treatment in TT-NOTCH cells is functional and that the activity is proportional to the amount of protein present. Conservation of the NOTCH1 Signaling Pathway in MTC Cells—To determine whether the downstream targets of activated NOTCH1 are intact in MTC cells, Western blotting was performed for HES-1 protein, an ASCL1 transcriptional repressor and an immediate downstream mediator of NOTCH1 signaling. In a dose-response assay, the TT-NOTCH cells treated with various concentration of doxycycline for 2 days showed an increase in the amount of HES-1 protein (Fig. 3A). The increase in NOTCH1 expression resulted in a significant increase in the level of HES-1 protein. However, the level of HES-1 protein plateaued after treatment with 0.5 μg/ml doxycycline. This is consistent with previous findings that HES-1 protein negatively regulates its expression by binding to its own promoter (29Kuroda K. Tani S. Tamura K. Minoguchi S. Kurooka H. Honjo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7238-7244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 30Sriuranpong V. Borges M.W. Strock C.L. Nakakura E.K. Watkins D.N. Blaumueller C.M. Nelkin B.D. Ball D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3129-3139Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). HES-1 is also present in control cells at a minimal level, and it has been shown that, under normal conditions, HES-6, another basic helix-loop-helix protein, binds to HES-1 and blocks the binding of HES-1 to the ASCL1 promoter (31Bae S. Bessho Y. Hojo M. Kageyama R. Development (Camb.). 2000; 127: 2933-2943PubMed Google Scholar, 32Joseph J. Mudduluru G. Antony S. Vashistha S. Ajitkumar P. Somasundaram K. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 6304-6315Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, HES-6 is expressed in TT cells, and this could be the reason why we observed ASCL1 expression in the presence of HES-1 protein in untreated cells. Notably, the level of HES-6 was reduced after NOTCH1 activation. Activation of NOTCH1 has been shown to down-regulate the expression of ASCL1 and its homologs in multiple organisms. A previous study has shown that ASCL1 expression is associated with NE markers (33Borges M. Linnoila R.I. van de Velde H.J. Chen H. Nelkin B.D. Mabry M. Baylin S.B. Ball D.W. Nature. 1997; 386: 852-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ASCL1 transcriptional repression due to NOTCH1-mediated HES-1 expression has been well characterized (27Chen H. Thiagalingam A. Chopra H. Borges M.W. Feder J.N. Nelkin B.D. Baylin S.B. Ball D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5355-5360Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 34Kunnimalaiyaan M.

First, a modeled binding mode for inhibitor 2-mercapto-3-phenylpropionyl-RATKML (Ki = 330 nm) was generated, and required the use of a molecular dynamic conformer of the enzyme displaying the reorientation of surface loops bordering the substrate binding cleft. These flexible loops are conformationally variable in x-ray crystal structures, and the model predicted that they were pivotal for providing complementary binding surfaces and solvent shielding for the pseudo-peptide.

Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) 3The abbreviations used are: BoNT, botulinum neurotoxins; SMNPI, small molecule (non-peptidic) inhibitors; LC, light chain; SNAP, synaptosomal-associated protein; SAR, structure-activity relationship. are the most potent of the biological toxins (1.Paddle B.M. J. Appl. Toxicol. 2003; 23: 139-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and are listed as category A (highest priority) bioterror agents by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They may be delivered by aerosol route (1.Paddle B.M. J. Appl. Toxicol. 2003; 23: 139-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 2.Burnett J.C. Henchal E.A. Schmaljohn A.L. Bavari S. Nat. Rev.

Moreover, BoNTs are now established biotherapeutics for a range of physical ailments and cosmetic treatments (2.Burnett J.C. Henchal E.A. Schmaljohn A.L. Bavari S. Nat. Rev.

Neither the currently available BoNT antitoxin nor antibodies can counter these toxins once they are inside neurons; currently, critical care mechanical ventilation is the only life-saving treatment option. However, the effects of internalized BoNTs can last for months (10.Meunier F.A. Lisk G. Sesardic D. Dolly J.O. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 22: 454-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and mechanical ventilation would be impractical if even a limited number of individuals were clandestinely/accidentally intoxicated. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify and develop small molecule (non-peptidic) inhibitors (SMNPIs) that can serve as both prophylactics and post-exposure therapeutics. BoNTs are composed of a heavy chain and a light chain (LC) that are connected by a disulfide bridge (11.Lacy D.B. Tepp W. Cohen A.C. DasGupta B.R. Stevens R.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). The heavy chain binds to neurons and transports the LC into the cytosol (12.Dong M. Yeh F. Tepp W.H. Dean C. Johnson E.A. Janz R. Chapman E.R. Science. 2006; 312: 592-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). The LC is a zinc metalloprotease. Each of the seven BoNT serotypes (A-G) cleaves a component of the SNARE (soluble NSF-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) proteins (13.Singh B.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 617-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), which mediate the exocytosis of acetylcholine into neuromuscular junctions.

Recently, it was shown that sequence variability exists within serotypes, and that this subtype variability can have an impact on antibody binding and neutralization (20.Smith T.J. Lou J. Geren I.N.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In the second, derivatives were generated, and 2-mercapto-3-phenylpropionyl-RATKML (mpp-RATKML) (Table 1) was found to possess a Ki = 330 nm (21.Schmidt J.J. Stafford R.G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). An extensive structure-activity relationship (SAR) study was performed on this inhibitor (Table 1) (21.Schmidt J.J. Stafford R.G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Structure activity data (21.Schmidt J.J. Stafford R.G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and structure-based rationales for replacement, deletion, and addition derivatives of mpp-RATKML In this study, we docked mpp-RATKML in the BoNT/A LC substrate binding cleft to map out potential new steric volume and intermolecular interactions for SMNPIs. The conformer of the bound pseudo-peptide was used to: 1) refine our pharmacophore for BoNT/A LC inhibition; and 2) generate search queries that were used to mine potent SMNPIs of the BoNT/A LC from the National Cancer Institute's Open Repository. One of the identified inhibitors displays dose-dependent protection of SNAP-25 in a primary culture of embryonic chicken neurons. Molecular Modeling−All molecular modeling was performed on a Silicon Graphics Octane 2. Insight II (Accelrys, San Diego, CA) was used to build and inspect models. Energy refinement and molecular dynamics were performed using the Discover and Discover 3.0 programs (Accelrys) and the cff91 force field. The HINT (hydropathic interactions) program (eduSoft, Richmond, VA) was used to evaluate model quality based on the quantitation of intra- and intermolecular contacts (23.Nguyen T.L. McGrath C. Hermone A.R. Burnett J.C. Zaharevitz D.W. Day B.W. Wipf P. Hamel E. Gussio R. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 6107-6116Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) (supplemental Refs. 1.Paddle B.M. J. Appl.

HINT parameter settings: steric term = Lennard-Jones 6-9 (for cff91 compatibility); lone pair vector focusing = 10; and distance dependence atom-atom interactions = exp (-1/r). Figures for molecular models were generated using Insight II and Catalyst 4.7 (Accelrys). Conformational sampling of mpp-RATKML was performed using a previously described molecular dynamics protocol (24.Giannakakou P. Gussio R. Nogales E. Downing K.H. Zaharevitz D. Bollbuck B. Poy G. Sackett D. Nicolaou K.C. Fojo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2904-2909Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). In brief, the objective was to sample a sufficient volume of conformational space to determine whether mpp-RATKML and/or its derivatives (from Table 1) utilized the preorganization of molecular substituents to facilitate binding in the BoNT/A LC substrate cleft. An equilibration phase using direct velocity scaling for 10 ps was followed by 100 ps of dynamics using the Berendson method of temperature-bath coupling. The temperature was increased by 25° increments from0Kto the simulation temperature of 300 K. A sample structure was collected every 100 fs. A distance dielectric of 1.0 was used. The 100 lowest energy conformers from the trajectory were examined for preorganizational intramolecular contacts and BoNT/A LC substrate cleft compatibility. The x-ray crystal structure of the BoNT/A LC that was used for enzyme coordinates: Protein Data Bank code 1E1H (25.Segelke B. Knapp M. Kadkhodayan S. Balhorn R. Rupp B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6888-6893Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar); resolution = 1.8 Å. Energy refinement and molecular dynamics protocols for 1E1H have been described previously (26.Burnett J.C. Schmidt J.J. McGrath C.F. Nguyen T.L. Hermone A.R. Panchal R.G. Vennerstrom J.L. Kodukula K. Zaharevitz D.W. Gussio R. Bavari S. Bioorg. Med.

Sausville E.A. Zaharevitz D.W. Gussio R. Bavari S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 310: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The coordinates of the energy-refined model of 1E1H were within its experimentally determined x-ray crystallographic resolution. For root mean square deviation comparisons between the energy-refined dynamics conformer of 1E1H and its corresponding x-ray crystal structure see supplemental materials “Methods.” For the x-ray co-crystal of SNAP-25 residues 146-204 in complex with the BoNT/A LC (PDB code 1XTG (28.Breidenbach M.A. Brunger A.T. Nature. 2004; 432: 925-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), resolution = 2.1 Å), mutated residues (28.Breidenbach M.A. Brunger A.T. Nature. 2004; 432: 925-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) Gln-224 and Phe-366 were restored to Glu and Tyr, respectively. Energy refinement performed on the 1XTG co-crystal followed the same methods as described for 1E1H. During mpp-RATKML docking, ranges for the S-zinc interaction distance and angle of incidence were 2.1-2.4 Å (29.Alberts I.L. Nadassy K. Wodak S.J. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1700-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 30.Roe R.R. Pang Y.P. J. Mol. Model. 1999; 5: 134-140Crossref Google Scholar) and 98-112° (29.Alberts I.L. Nadassy K. Wodak S.J. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1700-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), respectively. The manual docking of each inhibitor component involved translational, rotational, and torsional adjustments, as well as torsional adjustments to enzyme residue side chains (within acceptable limits defined by rotamer libraries). A van der Waals bump of 0.25 Å was used to remove unacceptably close atom-atom contacts. A tethered minimization strategy was used during model refinement. The strategy involved the application of 2000 kcal/mol per Å2 of force that was stepped off the inhibitor-protein model in 100 kcal/mol decrements by minimizing with conjugate gradients until the norm of the gradient was 0.001 kcal/Å. This process was repeated until all external force was removed. Following, inter- and intramolecular analyses of the docked inhibitor were performed using the HINT program (23.Nguyen T.L. McGrath C. Hermone A.R. Burnett J.C. Zaharevitz D.W. Day B.W. Wipf P. Hamel E. Gussio R. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 6107-6116Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), and unfavorable interactions were removed using rounds of manual adjustments (translational, rotational, and torsional) and tethered minimizations. This optimization cycle was repeated until a binding mode meeting all of our requirements was achieved. Finally, the inhibitor-enzyme complex was saturated with an 8.0-Å thick shell of water molecules. Hydrogens only were minimized until the gradient of the norm was 0.001 kcal/Å, and then the entire complex (enzyme, inhibitor, and water molecules) was again energy refined (until the gradient of the norm was 0.001 kcal/Å) to give the final model. Search query generation and compound library data base mining was performed using Catalyst 4.7 (Accelrys). The “best flexible” search mode was used for all data base screens. The molecular docking of SMNPIs was performed using the tethered minimization protocol described for mpp-RATKML. Assay of BoNT/A LC Protease Activity−The assay for BoNT/A protease activity was carried out as previously described (21.Schmidt J.J. Stafford R.G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 22.Schmidt J.J. Stafford R.G. Bostian K.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 31.Schmidt J.J. Bostian K.A. J. Protein Chem. 1995; 14: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 32.Schmidt J.J. Bostian K.A. J. Protein Chem. 1997; 16: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Ki values for the inhibitors were calculated from the slopes of Dixon plots with the equation: Ki = Km/(slope × Vmax × S), where S is the substrate concentration (33.Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. Wiley, New York1975Google Scholar). Each value is the average of two independent determinations, using nine concentrations of inhibitor in each. In all cases, standard deviations were less than ±25%. Neuronal Cell Cultures−Embryonic chicken spinal motor neurons were cultured by the method described in detail by Kuhn (34.Kuhn T.B. Methods Cell Biol. 2003; 71: 67-87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, fertilized chicken eggs (SPAFAS/Charles River Laboratories, North Franklin, CT) were incubated at 37 °C for 6 days. Embryos were removed from the eggs and ventral spinal cords were isolated from the embryos. Cells were dissociated by trypsinization and trituration. Cells were preplated into a culture dish with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum for 1 h to allow non-neuronal cells to attach to the dish, thereby increasing the percentage of neuronal cells in the suspension. Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in Leibovitz L15 medium (Invitrogen) with N3 supplement and 10% fetal bovine serum. The mitotic inhibitor 5-fluorodeoxyuridine was added to further reduce the population of non-neuronal (i.e. dividing) cells. Cells were plated into 6-well tissue culture plates that were coated first with poly-l-lysine, then with laminin. Cultures were incubated overnight at 37 °C prior to intoxication. Microscopy−Autofluorescence was used to examine inhibitor entry into cells. Chick spinal motor neurons were incubated for 30 min with 20 μm inhibitor and examined for an increase in intracellular fluorescence on an inverted Nikon TE300 microscope with a standard 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole filter set. Images were collected with a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000MP confocal/multiphoton system (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). For confocal images used to assay morphological indicators of general cell health after toxin and inhibitor treatments, spinal motor neuron cultures were fixed for 30 min in 3.7% formaldehyde and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min. After blocking for 30 min in 1% bovine serum albumin, cells were incubated with 1:500 DM1A anti-α-tubulin (Sigma). Cells were then labeled with 1:500 Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody, 1:25 Texas Red phalloidin, and Hoechst stain (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Intoxication, Inhibitor Treatment, and Western Blot Analysis−Cells were preincubated with inhibitor for 45 min, followed by 3.5 h incubation with 10 nm BoNT/A (MetaBiologics Inc., Madison, WI) and inhibitor. Cells were rinsed with fresh culture medium, scraped, collected, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed, and assessed for protein content using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Cell lysates were run on a 12% Tris glycine gel (Invitrogen), transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with SMI 81 mouse anti-SNAP-25 (Sternberger Monoclonals Inc., Lutherville, MD), and mouse anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Covance Research Products, Inc., Berkeley, CA) primary antibodies. A horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody was used (Pierce) in combination with an ECL Western blotting detection system (Pierce). Densitometry was performed using a UN-SCAN-IT gel automated digitizing system (Silk Scientific, Inc., Orem, UT). Isothermal Titration Calorimetry−Purified BoNT/A LC was subjected to a final gel filtration step (Superdex 200 column) to ensure a complete buffer exchange, as well as to exclude trace amounts of autocleavage products. All experiments were carried out in the same buffer to control for heat of dilution effects: 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) supplemented with 150 mm NaCl and 0.5 mm ZnCl2. Concentrations of NSC 240898 solutions were confirmed by UV-visible absorbance measurements. Calorimetric titration was performed multiple times on a VP-ITC calorimeter (MicroCal, Northhampton, MA) at 293 K. BoNT/A LC was used at a concentration of 28 μm in the isothermal titration calorimetry cell and inhibitor NSC 240898 at a concentration of 390 μm in the injection syringe. Prior to the titration, the samples were degassed for 10 min. The positive deflections observed at the end of the titration (Fig. 7) reflect the enthalpy of dilution of the inhibitor solution and were subtracted from the binding data. The first injection systematically showed a decreased enthalpy due to the technical limitations of the instrument and was omitted from curve fitting. The titration curve was then fit to a single site model by non-linear least squares regression as implemented by MicroCal Softwar5e Inc. in the Origin software package. According to this model, the parameters to be determined are: the number of binding sites (N), the binding enthalpy per site (ΔH), and the binding constant (Kd). The pseudo-peptide mpp-RATKML is a potent (Ki = 330 nm (21.Schmidt J.J. Stafford R.G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar)), specific, and competitive inhibitor of the BoNT/A LC. Due to its size, diverse composition, and the extensive amount of empirical structure-activity data available for this compound, it was an ideal candidate for molecular docking studies. Indeed, a rational binding mode for this inhibitor could be used to identify new intermolecular contacts and map available steric volume within the BoNT/A LC substrate cleft. This information could then be used to refine our pharmacophore for BoNT/A LC inhibition (26.Burnett J.C. Schmidt J.J. McGrath C.F. Nguyen T.L. Hermone A.R. Panchal R.G. Vennerstrom J.L. Kodukula K. Zaharevitz D.W. Gussio R. Bavari S. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2005; 13: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 27.Burnett J.C. Schmidt J.J. Stafford R.G. Panchal R.G. Nguyen T.L. Hermone A.R. Vennerstrom J.L. McGrath C.F. Lane D.J. Sausville E.A. Zaharevitz D.W. Gussio R. Bavari S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 310: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), allowing for the generation of new three-dimensional search queries to chemoinformatically “mine” novel SMNPIs from virtual compound databases. However, the conformational flexibility of mpp-RATKML (see Table 1 for the two-dimensional structure) represented a major challenge. Therefore, a comprehensive, biochemically realistic strategy for docking was established to ensure that the model: 1) was consistent with empirical data; 2) followed the fundamental principles of structural biochemistry (i.e. the hydrophobic effect, π stacking, etc.); and 3) adhered to our hydrophobicity-first rule of molecular docking, which formed the basis of our previous successes in a number of targets (for a detailed description of the hydrophobicity first rule, see supplemental “Methods”). A Dynamic Conformer of the BoNT/A LC Was Necessary for Generating an mpp-RATKML Binding Mode That Rationalized the Inhibitor SAR−An energy refined x-ray structure of the BoNT/A LC with the highest available resolution (PDB code 1E1H (25.Segelke B. Knapp M. Kadkhodayan S. Balhorn R. Rupp B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6888-6893Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar); resolution = 1.8 Å) was initially used for enzyme coordinates. However, even with parameters set for the S-zinc interaction (see “Experimental Procedures”), exhaustive molecular modeling studies failed to generate an mpp-RAT-KML:BoNT/A LC binding mode that satisfied our docking criteria. For example, all feasible binding conformations of the pseudo-peptide failed to rationalize its SAR, empirical data indicated a >1000-fold loss in potency for a Lys substitution (mpp-KATKML) (which is normally considered to be a conservative Arg replacement) (Table 1). Nevertheless, in our binding models of the inhibitor with the energy refined x-ray structure of the BoNT/A LC a Lys replacement was feasible, the cationic side chain Nε of the Lys could still engage in the same interactions as the Arg guanidinium, and therefore could not account for the SAR. Our inability to identify an acceptable binding mode for mpp-RATKML led to a pivotal question: is it possible that the conformation of the x-ray determined BoNT/A LC may not be the bioactive conformation, at least with respect to inhibitor binding? There is evidence suggesting that this is the case (22.Schmidt J.J. Stafford R.G. Bostian K.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 31.Schmidt J.J. Bostian K.A. J.

For example, a molecular dynamics study (26.Burnett J.C. Schmidt J.J. McGrath C.F. Nguyen T.L. Hermone A.R. Panchal R.G. Vennerstrom J.L. Kodukula K. Zaharevitz D.W. Gussio R. Bavari S. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2005; 13: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) demonstrated that both a BoNT/A LC extracted from the holotoxin (PDB code 3BTA (11.Lacy D.B. Tepp W. Cohen A.C. DasGupta B.R. Stevens R.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar); resolution = 3.2 Å) and the 1E1H (25.Segelke B. Knapp M. Kadkhodayan S. Balhorn R. Rupp B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6888-6893Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) x-ray crystal structure displayed very similar surface loop reorientations (loop 1 = residues 48-78 and loop 2 = residues 167-180) toward the substrate binding cleft. In doing so, these loops decreased the solvent accessibility of the cleft and formed potential new complementary binding surfaces for SMNPIs (26.Burnett J.C. Schmidt J.J. McGrath C.F. Nguyen T.L. Hermone A.R. Panchal R.G. Vennerstrom J.L. Kodukula K. Zaharevitz D.W. Gussio R. Bavari S. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2005; 13: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, α-helices and β-sheets of the LCs remained virtually unchanged (26.Burnett J.C. Schmidt J.J. McGrath C.F. Nguyen T.L. Hermone A.R. Panchal R.G. Vennerstrom J.L. Kodukula K. Zaharevitz D.W. Gussio R. Bavari S. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2005; 13: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Likewise, a comparison of different crystal forms of the BoNT/A LC revealed that all show variation in the indicated surface loops, whereas core secondary structures for all were identical (see supplemental “Results and Discussion”). Key to our docking studies was the identification of a BoNT/A LC conformer allowing for a structure-based rationalization of the complete loss in potency that is observed for replacement derivative mpp-KATKML (Table 1). When examining a dynamics trajectory for 1E1H (25.Segelke B. Knapp M. Kadkhodayan S. Balhorn R. Rupp B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6888-6893Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) we found that loop 1 reorientation toward the substrate binding cleft creates a hydrophobic pocket composed of the aliphatic methylenes of Lys-165 and the side chains of Val-67 and Pro-68; however, it was not until we explored the preorganizational state of mpp-RATKML that we fully understood the significance of this pocket. Specifically, the nearest local minimum for the pseudo-peptide indicated that the Arg side chain guanidinium may engage in an intramolecular cation-π interaction (39.Flocco M.M. Mowbray S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 709-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) with the mpp phenyl (Fig. 1A). This conformation allowed the guanidinium Nε to form an intramolecular hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of the Ala of the inhibitor (40.Borders Jr., C.L. Broadwater J.A. Bekeny P.A. Salmon J.E. Lee A.S. Eldridge A.M. Pett V.B. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The cation-π interaction, in combination with the intramolecular hydrogen bond, provided: 1) an Arg side chain conformation with good steric and hydropathic complementarity for the hydrophobic pocket (described above) presented by the dynamic conformer, thus allowing for hydrophobic collapse/desolvation (Fig. 1B); and 2) an Arg orientation with the guanidinium of the residue facing the polar contact region of the enzyme (26.Burnett J.C."
https://openalex.org/W2060844117,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has at least two fundamental conformations: an inactive tethered conformation and an active untethered, ligand-bound “back-toback” dimer, which may be part of an oligomeric complex. Monoclonal antibody (mAb) 806 is an EGFR-specific antibody that only binds a transitional form of the receptor after it untethers but before forming the back-to-back, ligated, active oligomer. We have shown that AG1478, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the EGFR, synergistically inhibits the growth of tumors overexpressing EGFR when used in combination with mAb 806 but the mechanism for this was not elucidated (Johns, T. G., Luwor, R. B., Murone, C., Walker, F., Weinstock, J., Vitali, A. A., Perera, R. M., Jungbluth, A. A., Stockert, E., Old, L. J., Nice, E. C., Burgess, A. W., and Scott, A. M. (2003) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 100, 15871–15876). We now show that AG1478 increases binding of mAb 806 to the cell surface through two distinct mechanisms: an immediate effect on the conformation of EGFR and a longer term increase in cell surface under-glycosylated EGFR, an event known to increase mAb 806 reactivity. Cross-linking studies demonstrated the presence of spontaneously occurring mAb 806-reactive dimers on the surface of cells overexpressing EGFR, which are rapidly increased by AG1478. Because they react with mAb 806, these dimers must exist in a conformation distinct from the ligated back-to-back dimer. Indeed, we detected similar dimers in 293T cells expressing the EGFR lacking the small dimerization/activation arm essential to the formation of the back-to-back dimer. Thus, some of the EGFR on the cell surface of cancer cells must exist as an untethered dimer that adopts a previously unreported conformation that is inactive. This information was used to optimize the therapeutic synergy between mAb 806 and AG1478 in a xenograft model.

The extracellular domain of EGFR can be divided into four sections, two ligand binding domains (L1 and L2) and two cysteine-rich domains (CR1 and CR2). It can adopt two distinct conformations: a tethered conformation (see Fig. 9A, top panel) where the CR1 domain interacts with the CR2 domain via a critical sequence of amino acids at position 242–259 in the CR1 domain (the “extracellular domain dimerization/activation arm”), and an untethered or extended conformation where L1 and CR1 undergo a 130° rotation so that the dimerization arm is no longer in contact with CR2 but is available to facilitate dimerization with a second EGFR molecule (see Fig. 9A, bottom panel). Although the conformation and aggregation state of the EGFR in the absence of ligand remains controversial (with possibilities including tethered monomers, untethered monomers, tethered dimers, and unligated “back-to-back” dimers) (7Clayton A.H.

Mattoon D. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 929-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), it is clear that the presence of ligand favors the formation of ligated, activated dimers/oligomers by facilitating either monomeric untethering or realignment of pre-existing dimeric forms. The active receptors then undergo autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic tail of the EGFR, recruitment of adaptor proteins, and initiation of multiple signaling cascades. In addition to ligand binding, receptor glycosylation is likely to be a determinant of EGFR conformation. In particular, high mannose forms of the receptor enable the conformationally sensitive mAb 806 to bind more readily to its epitope, either through increased receptor untethering or perhaps through protein misfolding (9Johns T.G. Mellman I. Cartwright G.A. Ritter G. Old L.J. Burgess A.W. Scott A.M. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 780-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Mutations of EGFR are common when EGFR is overexpressed in glioblastoma (10Frederick L. Wang X.Y. Eley G. James C.D. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1383-1387PubMed Google Scholar) and several other tumors (11Moscatello D.K. Holgado-Madruga M. Godwin A.K. Ramirez G. Gunn G. Zoltick P.W. Biegel J.A. Hayes R.L. Wong A.J.

Cancer. 2000; 82: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The most common of these is the de2–7 EGFR (also known as EGFRvIII) (10Frederick L. Wang X.Y. Eley G. James C.D. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1383-1387PubMed Google Scholar) in which there is a deletion of the 801 bp encoded by exons 2–7 (13Sugawa N. Ekstrand A.J. James C.D. Collins V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This results in a truncated receptor (140 kDa) lacking 267 amino acid residues in the extracellular domain, with the insertion of a novel glycine residue at the site of the deletion (14Humphrey P.A.

Despite an inability to bind ligand, de2–7 EGFR has low level constitutive kinase activity, which increases the tumorigenicity of tumors in vivo (15Nishikawa R. Ji X.D. Harmon R.C. Lazar C.S.

Two major classes of agents have been developed to target the EGFR: tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). TKIs such as gefitinib (ZD1839), erlotinib (OSI-774), or AG1478 (4-(3-chloroanilino-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline) competitively bind to the ATP pocket of EGFR to inhibit its activity (17Ciardiello F.

In contrast, antibodies against EGFR such as mAb 528 and C225 (cetuximab) competitively inhibit ligand binding and thereby prevent receptor activation (20Gill G.N. Kawamoto T. Cochet C. Le A.

Subsequent epitope mapping studies have shown that mAb 806 binds to a short cysteine loop between amino acids 287 and 302 on the extracellular domain that is only exposed transiently as the wt EGFR moves from the tethered to the extended conformation (23Johns T.G.

Thus, mAb 806 reactivity is found only in cells with favorable conditions for receptor untethering, such as the presence of mutations (e.g. de2–7 EGFR), overexpression of the receptor, or increased presence of EGFR ligands. In the case of EGFR overexpression, there is increased untethering as a result of ligand-independent EGFR activation and changes in glycosylation (9Johns T.G. Mellman I. Cartwright G.A. Ritter G.

We postulated that AG1478 influences the conformation of the EGFR, thereby augmenting mAb 806 binding and increasing its therapeutic effect. In this report, we undertake a detailed biochemical study of this phenomenon to determine the underlying mechanisms. The information obtained was then used to develop better therapeutic strategies for the use of AG1478 and mAb 806 in combination therapy.

AG1478 Increases mAb 806 Binding to Cells Overexpressing wt EGFR—The ability of AG1478 to influence mAb 806 binding to the EGFR on A431 cells was examined initially by determining the amount of receptor captured by mAb 806 IP in the presence and absence of AG1478. Cells were grown in media containing AG478 (2 μm) or vehicle for periods ranging from 20 min to 3 days before being lysed, subjected to IP with the relevant antibodies, and immunoblotted for EGFR. AG1478 was able to increase mAb 806 reactivity as reflected by the increased amount of EGFR immunoprecipitated in the AG1478-treated groups (Fig. 1). The addition of AG1478 for 20 min rapidly increased mAb 806 reactivity; the mean increase was 181% above control (Fig. 1, A and C, lower panels). This was a relatively selective effect on mAb 806 binding as mAb 528 reactivity increased by only 25% with similar treatment (Fig. 1, A and C, upper panels). Where cells were exposed to AG1478 for 24 h or greater, IP was performed on samples containing equal amounts of total cellular protein to control for the cytostatic effects of AG1478 on A431 cells. AG1478 treatment for 24 h increased mAb 806 reactivity by 121%, at 2 days the increase was 242%, and at 3 days it was 449% (Fig. 1, B and D, lower panels). Again, this increase was not a reflection of a total increase in EGFR, because IP with mAb 528 showed no increase in total EGFR at identical time points of AG1478 treatment (Fig. 1, B and D, upper panels). The effect of AG1478 on mAb 806 binding was examined in other cell lines overexpressing the wt EGFR. All cell lines were treated with 2 μm AG1478 for 20 min (Fig. 2A) or 24 h (Fig. 2B). The parental U87MG cells, which does not overexpress the wt EGFR or its ligands, show no mAb 806 reactivity (24Johns T.G. Stockert E. Ritter G. Jungbluth A.A. Huang H.J. Cavenee W.K. Smyth F.E.

Cancer. 2002; 98: 398-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and were not rendered mAb 806-positive by treatment with AG1478 (Fig. 2, A and B). The derivative cell line U87MG.wtEGFR, which has been transfected to overexpress wt EGFR, was mAb 806-positive at baseline, and this reactivity was increased by 96% with 20-min AG1478 (Fig. 2, A and C, left panel) and by 209% with 24 h of AG1478 (Fig. 2, B and C, right panel). Similar results were seen with another cell line transfected with wt EGFR, 293T.wt (Fig. 2, A and B). There was a 139% increase in mAb 806 reactivity with 20 min of AG1478 (Fig. 2, A and D, left panel) and a 145% increase with 24 h of AG1478 (Fig. 2, B and D, right panel). Thus, the effect of AG1478 on mAb 806 reactivity was not limited to A431 cells but was observed in several cell lines. The durability of this effect was examined by treating A431 cells with AG1478 for 20 min, withdrawing the media containing AG1478 and replacing it with media devoid of AG1478. At subsequent time points, cells were lysed and mAb 806 reactivity was determined by IP (Fig. 3). mAb 806 reactivity increased with 20 min of AG1478, and this effect persisted for at least 4 h following AG1478 withdrawal (Fig. 3). AG1478 Increases mAb 806 Binding to Cell Surface EGFR— The experiments above showed an increase in mAb 806 binding to total cellular EGFR, but they do not distinguish between mAb 806 reactivity at the cell surface and that within the cell. This is important, because we have previously shown that mAb 806 recognizes the substantial intracellular pool of high mannose EGFR in A431 and U87MG.wtEGFR cells (9Johns T.G. Mellman I.

https://openalex.org/W1984970029,"The benefits of apoptosis for a multicellular organism are obvious and fit the current dogma that the maintenance and viability of such organisms are dependent on the selective elimination of unneeded or deleterious cell types. However, self destruction at the level of the individual cell defies the most basic precepts of biology (sustaining life). If apoptosis is viewed through this construct then one question becomes paramount, i.e., why would an individual cell and its progeny develop, retain, or evolve a mechanism the sole purpose of which is to eliminate itself? In consideration of such a paradox, it is reasonable to postulate that prospective apoptotic pathways coevolved with and or were co-opted from another basic cell function(s) that did not involve the death of the cell per se. In the following article, we present the hypothesis that the conserved biochemical pathways of apoptosis are integral components of terminal cell differentiation and it is the time of engagement and activity level of these pathways that ultimately determines the choice between cell death or cell maturation."

ENaC is activated by serine proteases secreted in the extracellular milieu. In cystic fibrosis lungs, high concentrations of secreted neutrophil elastase (NE) are observed. hNE could activate ENaC and contribute to further decreased mucociliary clearance. The aims of this study were (i) to test the ability of an engineered human neutrophil elastase inhibitor (EPI-hNE4) to specifically inhibit the elastase activation of ENaC-mediated amiloride-sensitive currents (INa) and (ii) to examine the effect of elastase on cell surface expression of ENaC and its cleavage pattern (exogenous proteolysis). Oocytes were exposed to hNE (10–100 μg/ml) and/or trypsin (10 μg/ml) for 2–5 min in the presence or absence of EPI-hNE4 (0.7 μm). hNE activated INa 3.6-fold (p < 0.001) relative to non-treated hENaC-injected oocytes.

The highly sodium-selective epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) 2The abbreviations used are: ENaC, epithelial sodium channel; PCL, periciliar liquid; NE, neutrophil elastase; MBS, modified Barth solution; CAP, channel-activating protease. is composed of three homologous subunits (α, β, γ) and is expressed in several ion-transporting epithelia, including the kidney, colon, and lung (1Kellenberger S. Schild L. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 735-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). The physiological importance of ENaC in the lung was recognized when α ENaC knock-out mice were shown to die prematurely because of defective lung liquid clearance (2Hummler E. Barker P. Gatzy J. Beermann F. Verdumo C. Schmidt A. Boucher R. Rossier B.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar), indicating ENaC as a major driving force for fluid reabsorption from the alveolar space at the time of birth. Active transepithelial sodium transport by surface airway epithelia provides a major driving force for the control of airway surface liquid and periciliar liquid (PCL), highly critical for mucociliary clearance (3Boucher R.C. Pflugers. Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2003; 445: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 4Knowles M.R. Boucher R.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). ENaC, located at the apical membrane of the surface airways epithelium (SAE), constitutes a limiting step for sodium absorption by SAE, as shown by human genetic diseases (5Rossier B.C. Pradervand S. Schild L. Hummler E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 877-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Thus, loss of function of ENaC, as observed in pseudohypoaldosteronism, leads to a 2–3-fold increase in mucociliary clearance (6Kerem E. Bistritzer T. Hanukoglu A. Hofmann T. Zhou Z. Bennett W. MacLaughlin E. Barker P. Nash M. Quittell L. Boucher R. Knowles M.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). By contrast, increased ENaC activity, secondary to a loss of function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator, is observed in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. CF is a disease that is characterized by mutation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator gene (7Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 1251-1254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). The cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator is responsible for Cl–-driven fluid secretion in upper and lower airways and inhibits antagonistic fluid absorption through ENaC (8Guggino W.B.

J. 2004; 23: 146-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Mall et al. (11Mall M. Grubb B.R. Harkema J.R. O'Neal W.K. Boucher R.C. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar) have recently established that increased ENaC expression and activity in airways of transgenic mice may cause per se a “cystic fibrosis-like lung disease” characterized by decreased mucociliary clearance and tissue inflammation even in the absence of microbial infection. Together, these findings suggest that overactivity of ENaC contributes significantly to the CF phenotype. Thus, ENaC becomes a valid drug target for treating CF patients. Numerous studies have shown that several serine proteases are capable of increasing ENaC-mediated INa in multiple cell types (12Rossier B.C. Proc. Am. Thorac. Soc. 2004; 1: 4-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), including the in vitro and in vivo rodent lung (13Bridges R.J. Newton B.B. Pilewski J.M. Devor D.C. Poll C.T. Hall R.L. Am. J.

Because over-activity of ENaC is capable of inducing a CF-like phenotype, proteolytic activation of ENaC could be detrimental to CF patients. The serine protease neutrophil elastase (hNE) has been shown to reach concentrations >200 μg/ml in the lungs of patients with CF (21Delacourt C. Herigault S. Delclaux C. Poncin A. Levame M. Harf A. Saudubray F. Lafuma C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 26: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and to overcome antiprotease activity (19Birrer P. McElvaney N.G. Rudeberg A.

The hNE in the lungs of patients with CF is known to cause cellular damage, production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 8, and increased neutrophil influx (20Nakamura H. Yoshimura K.

If hNE is also capable of activating ENaC, it would thereby exacerbate the CF phenotype and actions taken to reduce this activation could be beneficial to CF patients. Recently, Caldwell et al. (23Caldwell R.A. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: L813-L819Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) have shown that hNE is capable of stimulating INa in a human bronchiole cell line and that an elastase inhibitor can prevent elastase-mediated stimulation. Elastase inhibitor therapy is currently being developed to treat CF and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by preventing hNE-induced lesions in the pulmonary epithelium. In this study, we have examined the effectiveness of one of these compounds, EPI-hNE4, an engineered hNE inhibitor that was designed to be a specific, high affinity drug, resistant to oxidative and proteolytic inactivation. We have hypothesized that hNE can cleave cell surface-expressed ENaC, which results in channel activation, and that EPI-hNE4 can prevent this cleavage/activation. To identify whether ENaC was being directly cleaved by hNE, oocytes were analyzed for increased ENaC-mediated INa and for proteolytic cleavage of cell surface proteins. Here, we present data indicating that elastase is capable of activating ENaC, possibly by cleaving cell surface-expressed γ ENaC and that this effect can be blocked by the elastase-specific inhibitor EPI-hNE4. The elastase-induced cleavage (exogenous proteolysis) is distinct from the cleavage pattern observed upon preferential assembly of α, β, and γ ENaC subunits by oocyte proteases (endogenous proteolysis), suggesting a causal relationship between cleavage and ENaC activation. cRNAs—Complementary RNAs of human or rat αβγ ENaC subunits and human prostasin were synthesized in vitro, using SP6 and T7 polymerase. C terminus V5 epitope-tagged α, β, and γ ENaC subunits were created by PCR amplification. For each subunit, two primers were synthesized. The forward primer contains the SpeI site and the start codon of the ENaC gene; the reverse primer contains the NotI site, the coding sequence for V5, and the C-terminal sequence of the ENaC gene. PCR products were purified and cloned into the SpeI/NotI sites of pSDE vector. Antibodies—Monoclonal anti-V5 antibody was obtained from Invitrogen and used according to the manufacturer's instruction. The actin antibody was from Sigma. Expression of ENaC and Human Prostasin cRNA in Xenopus oocytes—The cRNAs were injected into Xenopus oocytes (3.3 ng of each subunit and 3.3 ng of human CAP-1 (prostasin) = 13.2 ng of total cRNA/oocyte), and injected oocytes were kept in modified Barth solution (MBS) containing 88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 0.3 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.4 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.2. Electrophysiological measurements and cell surface biotinylation were performed 24 h after injection. Amiloride-sensitive Na+ current (INa) was recorded using the two-electrode voltage clamp and was defined as the difference between Na+ current obtained in the presence (5 μm) and in the absence of amiloride. Incubation of Xenopus oocytes with Proteases and Inhibitors—ENaC-injected oocytes were incubated for 2 min at room temperature in MBS solution containing proteases and/or inhibitors. hNE from human neutrophils (Serva Electrophoresis) was used at a concentration of 10–100 μg/ml, trypsin (Sigma) was used at a concentration of 10 μg/ml, engineered human elastase inhibitor (Debiopharm SA) was used at a concentration of 4.4 μg/ml, and aprotinin was used overnight at a concentration of 100 μg/ml. At the end of the incubation, elastase inhibitors were added to all samples before biotinylation. Biotinylation of ENaC Subunits on the Cell Surface—Biotinylation was performed in 40-well plates, using 50 oocytes/experimental condition as described (24Michlig S. Harris M. Loffing J. Rossier B.C. Firsov D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38264-38270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). All biotinylation steps were performed at 4 °C. After incubation in MBS solution for 30 min at 4 °C, the oocytes were washed three times with MBS. After the last wash, the MBS solution was removed and replaced by a biotinylation buffer containing 10 mm triethanolamine, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mg/ml EZ-link sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce), pH 9.5. The incubation lasted 15 min with gentle agitation. The biotinylation reaction was stopped by washing the oocytes two times with Quench buffer containing 192 mm glycine, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, added to MBS solution. After the second wash, oocytes were incubated for 5 min in the Quench buffer with gentle agitation. Oocytes were then washed two times with MBS solution and lysed by repeated pipetting with Pasteur pipettes in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-Cl, 5 μg/ml each of leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 4.4 μg/ml EPI-hNE4 (20 μl/oocyte). The lysates were vortexed for 30 s and centrifuged for 10 min at ∼10,000 × g. Supernatants were transferred to the new 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes containing 50 μl of immunopure immobilized streptavidin beads (Pierce) washed with lysis buffer. After overnight incubation at 4 °C with agitation, the tubes were centrifuged for 1 min at 5,000 rpm. Supernatant was removed, and beads were washed three times with lysis buffer. 35 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to the beads. All samples were heated for 5 min at 95 °C before loading on the 8–15% SDS-PAGE. The endogenous processing of ENaC in the Xenopus oocyte expression system is significant and specific for each subunit. Hughey et al. (16Hughey R.P. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L. Harkleroad K.L. Tong Q. Carattino M.D. Johnson J.P. Stockand J.D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18111-18114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) have implicated furin in ENaC proteolytic processing. It is not known if other enzymes are involved, and it is not clear whether this processing is related to the activation of ENaC at the cell surface. The study of exogenous secreted serine proteases (trypsin, elastase) could help in understanding whether ENaC cleavage is required for activation or not. We coupled the use of hNE with a highly specific inhibitor to study the relationship between cleavage of ENaC at the cell surface and the sodium transport response. Engineered Elastase Inhibitor EPI-hNE4 Specifically Inhibits Human hNE, and Not Trypsin, Stimulation of hENaC—To determine whether EPI-hNE4 was capable of inhibiting hNE-mediated stimulation of hENaC, we used the Xenopus oocyte expression system to overexpress hENaC proteins by injecting α, β, and γ hENaC subunit cRNAs. Xenopus oocytes injected with hENaC were exposed to hNE for 2 min, and INa was measured using the two-electrode voltage clamp system. Exposure of the Xenopus oocytes to hNE in MBS solution resulted in a >3.5-fold increase in INa over untreated oocytes (Fig. 1, lane 2 versus lane 1). This stimulation of hENaC (lane 2) was significantly inhibited in oocytes exposed to hNE in the presence of the elastase inhibitor EPI-hNE4 (lane 3), suggesting that the catalytic activity of hNE is involved in the activation of ENaC. Trypsin stimulated INa in hENaC-injected oocytes >5.5-fold over nontreated oocytes (lane 4), but EPI-hNE4 did not inhibit trypsin-induced activation of hENaC (lane 5), demonstrating the specificity of the inhibitor for elastase. Thus, both hNE and trypsin activate ENaC. To determine whether the activation pathways for these proteases were similar, hENaC-injected oocytes were exposed to trypsin alone (lane 4) or to hNE and trypsin together (lane 6). Simultaneous exposure to hNE and trypsin resulted in a 5-fold increase in INa (lane 6), but no additive effect was observed (compare lanes 6 versus 4 and 6 versus 2). This non-additive stimulation of INa in hENaC-injected oocytes by hNE and trypsin suggests that each protease can achieve maximum proteolytic stimulation of ENaC, either through proteolytic cleavage of the channel itself or through one of its regulatory proteins. The possibility that the expression system was translationally saturated was ruled out by injecting ten times more ENaC cRNAs, leading to a >10-fold increase in INa (lane 7). EPI-hNE4 Does Not Inhibit Amiloride-sensitive Na+ Transport Induced by Co-injected Prostasin—Channel-activating proteases (CAPs) are membrane-bound serine proteases (12Rossier B.C. Proc. Am. Thorac. Soc. 2004; 1: 4-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) known to be expressed and to regulate ENaC in the lung (13Bridges R.J. Newton B.B. Pilewski J.M. Devor D.C. Poll C.T. Hall R.L. Am. J.

Physiol. 2005; 288: L1099-L10109Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To determine whether EPI-hNE4 was capable of inhibiting exogenously expressed membrane proteases, hENaC-injected oocytes were co-injected with human CAP-1 (prostasin) (Fig. 2), a serine protease known to be expressed in airway epithelia and known to increase amiloride-sensitive INa. Oocytes co-injected with hCAP-1 and hENaC significantly increased INa (3-fold) (lane 2) over hENaC-injected oocytes (lane 1). Increasing concentrations of EPI-hNE4 added at the time of cRNA injection (lanes 3–5) were unable to significantly decrease the CAP-1-induced increase in INa. This further indicated that EPI-hNE4 is specific for hNE and does not affect human CAP-1 (prostasin) activity. As shown previously, the protease inhibitor aprotinin (added at the time of cRNA injection) was able to significantly decrease the prostasin-mediated increase in INa (lane 6), indicating that inhibition of CAP-1-mediated stimulation was effective. EPI-hNE4 had no significant effect on amiloride-sensitive INa when applied in the absence of hNE (lane 7). Aprotinin had no significant effect on basal currents (lane 8). NE Cleaves γ rENaC, but Not α and β rENaC, and Is Specifically Inhibited by EPI-hNE4—Recently, Hughey et al. (25Hughey R.P. Mueller G.M. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L. Poland P.A. Harkleroad K.L. Carattino M.D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37073-37082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) have shown that ENaC is proteolytically processed. It was demonstrated that cell surface-expressed ENaC proteins are cleaved and that cleavage correlated with channel activity. This suggested that intracellular proteolytic cleavage was involved in channel maturation (25Hughey R.P. Mueller G.M. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L. Poland P.A. Harkleroad K.L. Carattino M.D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37073-37082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The mechanism of extracellular protease stimulation of ENaC activity has not been identified. We wished to determine whether extracellular stimulation of ENaC by hNE was correlated with direct cleavage of the channel at the cell surface. Exposure of rENaC-injected Xenopus oocytes to hNE increased amiloride-sensitive Na+ current (INa) >7.5-fold (p < 0.001, n = 13) within 2 min. This stimulation of rENaC by hNE was significantly inhibited (p < 0.001) when the elastase inhibitor EPI-hNE4 was present in the MBS solution. To determine whether hNE activation was mediated by direct cleavage of the cell surface-expressed protein, cell surface biotinylation was performed. Xenopus oocytes injected with rENaC and exposed briefly (2 min) to hNE alone or to hNE and EPI-hNE4 together were biotinylated to separate membrane and intracellular proteins. Biotinylated and non-biotinylated V5-tagged α rENaC coinjected with β and γ rENaC was separated on a 8–15% gradient PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for Western blotting, and probed with V5 antibody (Fig. 3B). Control oocytes as well as those exposed to hNE, and hNE4 in the presence of EPI-hNE4 (lanes 1–3, respectively), had a major band at 95 kDa as well as 80- and 65-kDa fragments corresponding to the full-length α ENaC molecule, and two cleavage products. The non-biotinylated protein pool (Fig. 3C) also contained the 95-kDa full-length α ENaC molecule, but not the 80- and 65-kDa fragments (lanes 1–3). These products were ENaC specific and not observed in water-injected oocytes (lane 4). Absence of actin in the biotinylated cell surface proteins and its presence in the non-biotinylated protein pool confirmed that the biotinylation reaction did not label intracellular proteins. This result indicated that α ENaC was not cleaved by hNE but was cleaved by endogenous proteases. The corresponding amiloride-sensitive INa currents are shown in panel A showing a 5-fold increase of INa after 2 min of incubation in the presence of elastase, an effect fully inhibited by the inhibitor. V5-tagged β rENaC coinjected with α and γ ENaC was also Western blotted and probed with V5 antibody. β ENaC was expressed as a single band of 105 kDa at the cell surface (Fig. 4B, lanes 1–3) as well as in the non-biotinylated protein pool (Fig. 4C, lanes 1–3) in all ENaC-injected conditions. These products were ENaC specific and not observed in water-injected oocytes (lane 4). This result indicated that β ENaC was not cleaved by hNE or by intracellular proteases. The corresponding amiloride-sensitive INa currents are shown in panel A showing a 5-fold increase of INa after 2 min of incubation in the presence of elastase, an effect fully inhibited by the inhibitor. V5-tagged γ rENaC coinjected with α and β rENaC was also Western blotted and probed with V5 antibody. Control oocytes as well as those exposed to hNE and hNE4 in the presence of EPI-hNE4 (Fig. 5B, lanes 1–3, respectively) exhibited a band of 87 kDa as well as a 76-kDa fragment, corresponding to the full-length γ ENaC molecule and the endogenous cleavage product, respectively. In addition, the hNE-treated oocytes exhibited an additional fragment of 67 kDa (Fig. 5B, lane 2, *) that was not present when oocytes were exposed to hNE in the presence of EPI-hNE4 (lane 3). The nonbiotinylated protein pool (Fig. 5C) similarly contained the 87-kDa full-length γ ENaC molecule, as well as the 76-kDa fragment, but not the 67-kDa fragment in all ENaC-injected conditions (lanes 1–3). These products were ENaC specific and not observed in water-injected oocytes (lane 4). This result indicated that γ ENaC was cleaved by endogenous proteases and further cleaved by hNE at the cell surface. The corresponding amiloride-sensitive INa currents are shown in panel A showing a 6-fold increase of INa after 2 min of incubation in the presence of elastase, an effect fully inhibited by the inhibitor. Western blot densitometry was performed (Molecular Imager FX; Bio-Rad) to quantify the appearance of the hNE-induced 67-kDa γ rENaC fragment at the cell surface (Fig. 6A) and in the non-biotinylated total pool (Fig. 6B). Band densities of five independent Western blots were normalized to full-length 87-kDa γ ENaC in untreated oocytes (Fig. 6, A and B, lanes 1). Biotinylated cell surface 87-kDa γ ENaC band density was not significantly altered by exposure to hNE alone or when co-incubated with its inhibitor EPI-hNE4 (Fig. 6A, lanes 2 and 3). Cell surface 76-kDa γ ENaC was similarly not affected (lanes 4–6). The hNE-induced 67-kDa fragment was significantly increased by hNE treatment (lane 8,*, p < 0.05) over untreated controls (lane 7). The appearance of the hNE-induced 67-kDa fragment was prevented by inhibiting hNE with EPI-hNE4 (lane 8 versus lane 7,#, p < 0.05). The non-biotinylated total pool 87- and 76-kDa γ rENaC band densities were not significantly affected by treatment with hNE nor hNE with EPI-hNE4 (Fig. 6B, lanes 1–6). The 67-kDa γ rENaC band was not detected in the non-biotinylated total pool protein (lanes 7–9). These results indicated that the hNE-induced 67-kDa γ rENaC cleavage product was significantly increased relative to non-hNE treated controls and that inhibition of hNE by EPI-hNE4 prevented the formation of this cleavage product. The presence of the 67-kDa γ rENaC cleavage product at the cell surface and not in the non-biotinylated total protein pool indicated that hNE was acting uniquely on cell surface-expressed γ rENaC and not on the intracellular γ rENaC proteins. Elastase-induced ENaC Activation and Cleavage at the Cell Surface: Evidence for Specific Exogenous Proteolysis—Recent evidence clearly indicates that ENaC activation can be directly induced by exposing membrane patches to external trypsin (17Caldwell R.A. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C190-C194Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) or elastase (17Caldwell R.A. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C190-C194Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The effect is rapid, characterized by a large change in ENaC open probability (Po). Obviously, this approach does not allow the correlation of ENaC activity with proteolysis. In the present study, we took advantage of the very rapid ENaC activation (within 2 min) by external application of hNE, which can then be correlated with the pattern of proteolysis at the cell surface in the same oocytes. A short time course (2 min) minimizes the problem of endo- or exocytosis so that mainly the pool of ENaC molecules pre-existing at the plasma membrane are studied. We used a highly specific elastase inhibitor to definitively assign induced functional and biochemical events to elastase catalytic activity. Using this protocol we have demonstrated that the γ ENaC subunit undergoes a cleavage that is cell surface specific (within 2 min), because it is not observed in the intracellular pool. The induced fragment is 67 kDa, (Fig. 5, *). Cell surface cleavage was efficiently prevented by the elastase inhibitor EPI-hNE4. It is therefore tempting to speculate that this cell surface-specific cleaved form of γ ENaC represents the activation of “near silent” channels observed in membrane patches. In other words, the change in Po may not only correlate with, but be caused by, proteolysis. How could cleaving a channel increase its Po? This is not so unlikely if one considers the number of biological processes, e.g. prohormones (i.e. insulin), the coagulation cascade, that are activated by cleavage. Serine proteases (trypsin, chymotrypsin) secreted as inactive pro-enzymes and activated into zymogens by intramolecular cleavage are other well known examples. A similar scheme could also apply to an ionic channel, such as ENaC. ENaC is characterized by its unusual gating kinetics, with postulated transitions from different modes, i.e. from low Po (i.e.“near silent”, Po < 0.05) to high Po gating modes (Po > 0.8) (1Kellenberger S. Schild L. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 735-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). These different gating modes could correspond to the cleavage of γ ENaC. Importantly, the β subunit is insensitive to both endogenous and exogenous proteolysis (Fig. 4). We have no explanation for this resistance. One can, however, speculate that the N-glycosylation of the β subunit might play a role because the β subunit has no less than 12 N-glycosylation sites. This could protect the proteolytic cleavage sites from enzyme access to their substrate. In addition, it is worth noting that the primary sequence of the β subunit does not have any consensus sequences for cleavage by furin. Therefore, differences in primary sequence and protein folding/maturation may explain the striking difference between the β and γ subunits. Interestingly, the α ENaC subunit undergoes endogenous cleavage producing an 80-kDa fragment and a 65-kDa fragment at the cell surface (Fig. 3A). These cleavage products are not seen in the non-biotinylated intracellular pool (Fig. 3B) as an abundant form of the channel. However, overexposure of the Western blot reveals that these fragments are present intracellularly in low quantities relative to the full-length 95-kDa α ENaC (data not shown). Taken together these data indicate that α ENaC is endogenously processed late in its maturation, consistent with a furin cleavage profile, which occurs in the late Golgi or at the cell surface. Our Western blots of α ENaC indicate that hNE is unable to further cleave this subunit. However, in a small percentage (6%) of our Western blots cleavage of the α ENaC subunit is observed upon exposure to hNE. This is, however, inconsistent with the activation of INa by hNE that is observed in all experiments irrespective of the hNE-specific cleavage of α ENaC. This is in contrast to the hNE-induced 67-kDa γ ENaC cleavage product that is observed to correlate 100% with induction of INa. Physiological and Pathophysiological Implications of Serine Proteases and Serine Protease Inhibitors—Our findings are relevant to the development of novel drug therapies for patients suffering from CF. In this disease, mucociliary clearance is severely decreased. Mucociliary clearance is critically dependent on the control of the periciliar liquid (PCL). Combined defects of accelerated Na+ transport and the failure to secrete Cl– deplete the PCL compartment, abrogating both cilia-dependent and cough clearance. Subsequent to PCL depletion, mucus adheres to airway surfaces and persistent mucin secretion generates the formation of “thickened” mucus plaques and plugs, which become the nidus for bacterial infection (10Boucher R.C. Eur. Respir. J. 2004; 23: 146-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). This pathogenic scheme has been validated by the generation of a mouse model overexpressing the β ENaC subunit in distal airways that led to a PCL depletion and CF lung phenotype mimicking the human disease (11Mall M. Grubb B.R. Harkema J.R. O'Neal W.K. Boucher R.C. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). In this setting, ENaC becomes a valid target for the treatment of CF lung disease. The inhibition of ENaC by amiloride has already been shown to be effective in increasing mucociliary clearance (27Sood N. Bennett W.D. Zeman K. Brown J. Foy C. Boucher R.C. Knowles M.R. Am. J. Resp. Crit. Care Med. 2003; 167: 158-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Similar beneficial effects can be observed by inhalation of hypertonic saline, producing a sustained acceleration of mucus clearance and improved lung function (26Donaldson S.H. Bennett W.D. Zeman K.L. Knowles M.R. Tarran R. Boucher R.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 2006; 354: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Inhibition of elastase by the specific inhibitor would have dual and synergistic effects on CF airways: blocking ENaC activity, thereby repleting PCL and improving mucociliary clearance, and blocking the effect of elastase on tissue inflammation and destruction. This inhibitor would have the advantage of not interfering with the physiological control of ENaC by endogenous lung serine proteases, such as prostasin or other membrane-bound serine proteases, expressed in airway epithelia (15Planes C. Leyvraz C. Uchida T. Angelova M.A. Vuagniaux G. Hummler E. Matthay M. Clerici C. Rossier B. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: L1099-L10109Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar)."

Biochemical and immunological analyses indicate that N-WASP is expressed in SK-OV-3.ipl cells and that the binding of HA stimulates N-WASP association with CD44 and Arp2/Arp3 leading to filamentous actin formation and ovarian tumor cell migration. In addition, HA binding promotes CD44-N-WASP association with ErbB2 and activates ErbB2 kinase activity that in turn increases phosphorylation of the cytoskeletal protein, β-catenin. Subsequently, phosphorylated β-catenin is transported into the nucleus leading to β-catenin-mediated TCF/LEF-transcriptional co-activation. Because HA-induced β-catenin phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and TCF/LEF transcriptional activation is effectively blocked by the ErbB2 inhibitor, AG825, we conclude that HA/CD44-N-WASP-associated ErbB2 activation is required for β-catenin-mediated signaling events. Transfection of SK-OV-3.ipl cells with N-WASP-VCA (verpolin homology, cofilin homology, and acidic domain) fragment cDNA not only blocks HA/CD44-induced N-WASP-Arp2/3 complex formation but also inhibits actin polymerization/F-actin assembly and tumor cell migration. Overexpression of the N-WASP-VCA domain also significantly reduces HA-induced ErbB2 recruitment to CD44, diminishes β-catenin phosphorylation/nuclear translocation, and abrogates TCF/LEF-specific transcriptional co-activation by β-catenin. Taken together, our findings strongly suggest that N-WASP plays a pivotal role in regulating HA-mediated CD44-ErbB2 interaction, β-catenin signaling, and actin cytoskeleton functions that are required for tumor-specific behaviors and ovarian cancer progression.

Ovarian carcinoma is the most lethal tumor of the female genital tract and continues to be a major cause of mortality in female cancer patients. A common mechanism for the spread of ovarian cancer is the shedding of cells from the primary tumor into the peritoneal cavity (1Hoskins W.J. Cancer. 1993; 71: 1534-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This event is then followed by the formation of secondary tumor masses attached to the bowel and omental surface, both of which are covered by a single layer of mesothelial cells (2Fox H. Shepherd J. Monaghan J. Clinical Gynecological Cancer. Blackwell Scientific Publishers, Oxford1990: 188-217Google Scholar). Extracellular matrix components, such as hyaluronan (HA), 2The abbreviations used are: HA, hyaluronan; N-WASP, neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; F-actin, filamentous actin; WASP, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA; TCF/LEF, T-cell factor/lymphocyte enhancer factor; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; WH1, WASP-homology 1. are present in large amounts in the mesothelial lining of the peritoneum (3Laurent T.C.

Metastasis. 1995; 13: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). HA is often bound to CD44, which is a ubiquitous, abundant, and functionally important surface receptor that displays HA-binding site(s) (5Underhill C. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 293-298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both CD44 and HA are overexpressed at sites of tumor attachment and are involved in tumor cell-specific functions (3Laurent T.C.

Thus, it has been postulated that CD44 interaction with HA may be one of the important requirements for the spread of ovarian cancer. CD44 denotes a family of cell-surface glycoproteins that are expressed in a variety of human solid neoplasms, particularly those of gynecologic origin (e.g. ovarian cancers) (6Lesley J. Hyman R. English N. Catterall J.B. Turner G.A. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: 611-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 7Naor D. Sionov R.V. Ish-Shalom D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1997; 71: 241-319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of the distinct features of CD44 is the enormous heterogeneity in the molecular masses of this family of proteins. It is known that CD44 is encoded by a single gene that contains 19 exons (10Screaton G.R. Bell M.V. Jackson D.G. Cornelis F.B. Gerth U. Bell J.I. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12160-12164Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar), and out of the 19 exons, 12 exons can be alternatively spliced (10Screaton G.R. Bell M.V. Jackson D.G. Cornelis F.B. Gerth U. Bell J.I. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12160-12164Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). Most often, the alternative splicing occurs between exons 5 and 15 leading to an insertion in tandem of one or more variant exons (v1–v10, involving exons 6–14 in human cells) within the membrane proximal region of the extracellular domain (10Screaton G.R.

WASP family proteins such as N-WASP contain a number of functional domains and motifs known to interact with both the cytoskeleton and various signaling complexes. These domains include a verprolin homology, a cofilin homology, and an acidic domain (VCA) at the C terminus; a proline-rich region in the center of the molecule, a GTPase binding domain/CRIB motif, a WASP-homology 1 (WH1) domain, and a basic region at the N terminus (25Derry J.M.

In particular, the verprolin homology (V) binds to actin directly, whereas the cofilin homology-acidic (CA) region interacts with an actin-related protein (Arp) 2/3 complex (a 7-component protein complex), initiating the nucleation reaction of actin filaments in vitro and inducing actin polymerization/filamentous actin (F-actin) formation in vivo (26Miki H.

Thus, these findings suggest that N-WASP not only serves as a scaffolding protein (mediating multiprotein Arp2/3 complex aggregation) but also directly participates in F-actin assembly and cytoskeleton reorganization. The VCA domain also interacts with the middle region of the N-WASP, generating an autoinhibitory configuration and preventing Arp2/3 association. Subsequently, this VCA-mediated autoinhibitory process blocks actin polymerization (37Miki H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Takenawa T.

The HER2 oncogene (also called ErbB2 or neu) encodes a 185-kDa membrane protein (p185HER2) that contains a single transmembrane spanning region and a tyrosine kinase-associated cytoplasmic domain (48Bargmann C.I.

Overexpression or amplification of HER2 oncogenes appears to correlate with poor survival rates of many known cancers, including ovarian cancer (50Berchuck A. Kamel A. Whitaker R. Kerns B. Olt G.

However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which ErbB2 enhances the growth and survival of ovarian cancer cells are not completely understood. Previously, we have determined that CD44 and ErbB2 are physically linked to each other via interchain disulfide bonds (11Bourguignon L.Y.W. Zhu H.B. Chu A. Zhang L. Hung M.C. J. Biol.

The binding of HA to a CD44-asociated ErbB2 complex stimulates ErbB2 kinase activity and promotes Ras-mediated stimulation of a downstream kinase cascade, which includes the Raf-1/MEK/MAPK(ERK) pathway leading to tumor cell growth and migration (11Bourguignon L.Y.W.

The cytoskeletal protein β-catenin is a multifunctional protein known to play a key role in cell-cell adhesion and the Wnt signaling pathway (52Reynolds A.B. Roczniak-Ferguson A.

Science. 1997; 275: 1752-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In normal cells, β-catenin is associated with E-cadherin and mediates cell-cell adhesion (52Reynolds A.B. Roczniak-Ferguson A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7947-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 53Logan C.Y. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

To maintain homeostasis, the β-catenin/E-cadherin association is regulated in part by serine/tyrosine phosphorylation on specific residues. Serine phosphorylation in the N terminus of β-catenin targets it for proteosomal degradation, whereas tyrosine phosphorylation in the C terminus of β-catenin influences its interaction with E-cadherin (52Reynolds A.B.

In the Wnt signaling pathway, glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β, a kinase that normally phosphorylates excess β-catenin and causes its ubiquitination and degradation) is inactivated when soluble Wnt protein binds to the frizzled receptor (52Reynolds A.B.

In cancer cells, an uncomplexed phosphorylated form of β-catenin also accumulates in the cytoplasm prior to trans-location into the nucleus where it binds to the TCF/LEF family of transcription factors and activates transcription of downstream genes such as cyclin D1 and c-myc (58Shtutman M. Zhurinsky J. Simcha I. Albanese C. D'Amico M. Pestell R. ben-Ze'ev A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5522-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar, 75Roose J. Clevers H. Biochim.

In particular, β-catenin phosphorylation by ErbB2 tyrosine kinase destabilizes the E-cadherin-catenin complexes leading to a decrease of cell adhesion and a shifting of β-catenin into the oncogenic pathway (59Hazan R.B.

Until the present time, the mechanism by which HA/CD44 activation of ErbB2 modulates β-catenin-mediated signal transduction and oncogenesis in ovarian tumor cells has not been addressed. In this study, we have discovered a new mechanistic role for HA/CD44-mediated N-WASP signaling and ErbB2 activation that is centered on F-actin formation and β-catenin phosphorylation/nuclear translocation. These events then promote cell migration and transcriptional up-regulation in ovarian tumor cells.

In certain bacteria, the reaction is reversed and the enzyme generates pmf, working as a proton-pumping ATPase. The ATPase activity of bacterial enzymes is prone to inhibition by both ADP and the C-terminal domain of subunit ϵ. We studied the effects of ADP, Pi, pmf, and the C-terminal domain of subunit ϵ on the ATPase activity of thermophilic Bacillus PS3 and Escherichia coli ATP synthases. We found that pmf relieved ADP inhibition during steady-state ATP hydrolysis, but only in the presence of Pi. The C-terminal domain of subunit ϵ in the Bacillus PS3 enzyme enhanced ADP inhibition by counteracting the effects of pmf. It appears that these features allow the enzyme to promptly respond to changes in the ATP:ADP ratio and in pmf levels in order to avoid potentially wasteful ATP hydrolysis in vivo.

ATP synthase (FOF1) is a ubiquitous enzyme present in the plasma membrane of bacteria, the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts, and the inner mitochondrial membrane.

At low pmf the activity is reversed and the enzyme functions as a proton-pumping ATPase. ATP synthase consists of two distinct regions: the hydrophobic FO, which is embedded in the membrane, and the hydrophilic F1 that protrudes ∼100 Å from the membrane bilayer. F1 contains three catalytic and three non-catalytic nucleotide-binding sites and is responsible for both ATP synthesis and hydrolysis reactions. FO performs transmembrane proton transport. The simplest subunit composition is found in bacteria (e.g. Escherichia coli or thermophilic Bacillus PS3; see Refs. 1Capaldi R.A. Schulenberg B. Murray J. Aggeler R. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 29-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 2Altendorf K. Stalz W. Greie J. Deckers-Hebestreit G. J. Exp.

It is now widely accepted that the enzyme operates according to the “binding change mechanism” (see Ref. 3Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39045-39061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar and the references therein). Briefly, proton translocation is coupled to the rotation of the c-ring oligomer (4Junge W. Lill H. Engelbrecht S. Trends Biochem.

Nature. 2005; 433: 773-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar and references therein for details). Rotation of the γ subunit inside the α3β3 hexamer causes sequential conformational changes to the catalytic sites. These sequential conformational changes result in substrate binding, the chemical step, and product release (8Nakamoto R.K. Ketchum C.J. Kuo P.H. Peskova Y.B. al Shawi M.K. Biochim. Biophys.

This “rotary binding change mechanism” is usually considered reversible, and numerous demonstrations of ATP-driven proton pumping support this assumption. However, several observations indicate that this is not the case. Many factors (e.g. products/substrates of catalysis, inhibitors, inorganic anions, etc.) affect ATP synthesis and the hydrolysis activities of the enzyme (see Ref. 11Vinogradov A.D. J. Exp.

One of the most well known anisotropic regulatory factors is ADP; it not only serves as a substrate for ATP synthesis but also inhibits ATPase activity of the enzyme in a non-competitive manner.

It was also demonstrated that the tightly bound inhibitory ADP can be expelled by pmf (19Creczynski-Pasa T.B. Graber P.

In view of the single molecule data, it is conceivable that activation by pmf is caused by pmf-driven rotation of the γ subunit. Another regulatory mechanism found in chloroplast and bacterial ATP synthase is the inhibition of ATPase activity by subunit ϵ (see Refs. 37Vik S.B. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 38Capaldi R.A. Schulenberg B. Biochim. Biophys.

Subunit ϵ is composed of two domains: the N-terminal β-sandwich that is bound to both the c-ring and subunit γ, and two mobile C-terminal α-helices. Only the C-terminal domain appears to be responsible for inhibition of ATP synthase (40Kuki M. Noumi T. Maeda M. Amemura A. Futai M. J. Biol.

In the last few years, it was demonstrated that in both the E. coli and Bacillus PS3 enzymes, the C-terminal domain adopted two conformations: “contracted”, with the two helices forming a hairpin structure close to the c-ring, and “extended”, with the helices stretched toward the F1 region (46Tsunoda S.P.

Ono S. Shirakihara Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46840-46846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Cross-linking experiments with the Bacillus PS3 enzyme revealed that the extended conformation correlates with the inhibition of ATPase activity, but not of ATP synthesis. The contracted conformation inhibited neither synthesis nor hydrolysis (47Suzuki T. Murakami T. Iino R. Suzuki J. Ono S. Shirakihara Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46840-46846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In this work, we investigated the factors necessary to maintain bacterial ATP synthase activity during ATP hydrolysis. We measured ATPase activity in wild-type enzymes from thermophilic Bacillus PS3 (TFOF1) and from E. coli (EFOF1) and in a mutant of TFOF1 where the C-terminal domain of subunit ϵ was truncated, TF0F1(ϵΔC). We demonstrated that energization of the membrane (pmf) not only stimulated initial ATPase activity (activation by pmf) but also counteracted ADP inhibition during steady-state ATP hydrolysis. The latter phenomenon was dependent upon the presence of Pi and was opposed by the C-terminal domain of subunit ϵ.A model describing the regulatory interplay between ADP inhibition, Pi affinity, subunit ϵ conformational transitions, and membrane energization is proposed. E. coli cells expressing His-tagged TFOF1 or EFOF1 were grown as previously described (48Suzuki T. Ueno H. Mitome N. Suzuki J. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13281-13285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The plasmid pTR19-ASDS was used for expression of wild-type TF0F1. The TFOF1(ϵΔC) mutant of TFOF1 (containing a stop codon after Asp-87 of subunit ϵ) was expressed in the same plasmid modified as described previously (49Masaike T. Suzuki T. Tsunoda S.P. Konno H. Yoshida M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 342: 800-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Plasmid pFV2 (provided by Prof. S. Vik from Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX) was used for expression of His-tagged EFOF1 (50Ishmukhametov R.R. Galkin M.A. Vik S.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1706: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). All proteins were expressed in DK8 E. coli cells (bglR, thi-1, rel-1, HfrPO1, Δ(uncB-uncC), ilv:Tn10) lacking the wild-type EFOF1 operon. Inverted membranes were obtained using a French press treatment (48Suzuki T. Ueno H. Mitome N. Suzuki J. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13281-13285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). No further purification of the EFOF1 enzyme was performed. TFOF1 and TF1 were purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography as previously described (47Suzuki T. Murakami T. Iino R. Suzuki J. Ono S. Shirakihara Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46840-46846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 48Suzuki T. Ueno H. Mitome N. Suzuki J. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13281-13285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The enzymes were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in aliquots at -80 °C until use. Inverted membrane vesicles stripped of F1 were prepared by sonication in 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. After sonication, the suspension was centrifuged (190,000 × g, 45 min, 4 °C) and resuspended in 0.5 mm EDTA, and the procedure was repeated twice. Then, the membranes were resuspended in buffer containing 10 mm HEPES-KOH, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol, pH 7.5. The stripping efficiency was verified by measurement of residual ATPase activity. Reconstitution of stripped membranes was carried out by mixing with excess purified TF1 for 30 min at room temperature. Excess TF1 was washed away by the same buffer in two sequential centrifugations (190,000 × g, 45 min, 4 °C). The reconstituted membranes were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until use. Phosphatidylcholine (Sigma S-II type) was resuspended to a final concentration of 44 mg/ml in buffer containing 10% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5. The suspension was mixed for 30 min at room temperature and then sonicated at maximum power with an Astrason XL2020 ultrasonic liquid processor (Misonix) for 15 s on ice. The liposomes were then divided into 1-ml aliquots, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. For reconstitution, the liposomes were diluted to a concentration of 8 mg/ml in buffer containing 10 mm Tricine, 80 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.8% w/v Triton X-100, pH 8.0. Purified TFOF1 was added to a final concentration of 0.1-0.15 mg/ml, and the sample was incubated1hat room temperature with gentle agitation. BioBeads (Bio-Rad) that had been pre-soaked in water were then added to a concentration of 320 mg/ml, and the sample was incubated for 2 h at room temperature with gentle agitation. The BioBeads were removed by filtration, and the proteoliposomes were used immediately or kept overnight at room temperature and used the next day. The same procedures were applied for the mutant TFOF1(ϵΔC). ATPase activity was measured by three different methods. ADP Assay—ATP hydrolysis was monitored via NADH oxidation enzymatically coupled to the rephosphorylation of produced ADP (51Pullman M.E. Penefsky H.S. Datta A. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 3322-3329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NADH concentration was measured optically at 340 nm in buffer containing 10 mm HEPES-KOH, 10% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm potassium phosphate, 200 μm NADH, 3 mm phosphoenolpyruvate (tricyclohexylammonium salt), 0.1 mg/ml pyruvate kinase, and 0.1 mg/ml lactate dehydrogenase. The final pH was 8.0-8.1. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 1 mm ATP. KCN (3 mm) was present in measurements with sub-bacterial inverted membrane particles to prevent NADH oxidation by respiratory chain enzymes. pH Assay—ATP hydrolysis was measured by following proton release using the pH indicator phenol red at 557 nm (52Nishimura M. Ito T. Chance B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 59: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) in buffer containing 2.5 mm HEPES-KOH, 10% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, and 2.5 mm MgCl2, pH 8.0-8.1. Potassium phosphate (2.5 mm) was present unless otherwise indicated. The response of phenol red was calibrated by the addition of either 10 mm H2SO4 or 10 mm NaOH aliquots. The calibration was verified by measurements of ATPase activity in the same sample by following the concomitant production of either ADP or Pi. The observed ratio of H+:ATP was ∼0.85. Pi Assay—In this assay, ATP hydrolysis was measured following the production of Pi by an enzymatic colorimetric method (53Webb M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4884-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) using an EnzCheck® Phosphate Assay kit (Invitrogen). Samples contained 270 μm MESG (2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine riboside), 2 units/ml purine nucleotide phosphorylase, 2.5 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol, pH 8.0. Inorganic phosphate produced from ATP hydrolysis reacts with MESG, producing ribose 1-phosphate and 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine. The concentration of the latter product was followed in real time via absorbance at 360 nm. All measurements were done using a Jasco V-550 spectro-photometer. Activity of TFOF1 was measured at 43 °C; measurements with EFOF1 were done at 36 °C. To analyze changes in ATP hydrolysis rate during the measurements, the experimental traces were differentiated using Origin 7.0 software (Origin-Lab Corp.) and smoothed by averaging 20 adjacent data points. The reliability of this procedure was verified by comparison of the derivatives using the usual linear fits of the experimental data (20 data points/fit). ATP and succinate-driven proton-pumping activity was measured by fluorescence quenching of 0.3 μg/ml 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine. The fluorescence (excitation at 410 nm and emission at 480 nm) was followed in buffer containing 2.5 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm potassium phosphate, and 10% glycerol at either 43 °C (TFOF1) or 36 °C (EFOF1). Protein concentration was determined by BCA assay (Bio-Rad). Experimental Setup—We observed the ATPase activity of FOF1 in real time by monitoring 1) production of ADP via oxidation of NADH mediated by lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase in an ATP-regenerating system (ADP assay), 2) pH change caused by the release of “scalar” protons during ATP hydrolysis via phenol red (pH assay), or 3) production of Pi via enzymatic conversion of Pi by purine nucleotide phosphorylase inaPi-scavenger system (Pi assay). In the ADP assay, the ATP concentration is unchanged and the ADP concentration is negligibly small throughout the reaction, while Pi concentration increases as the reaction proceeds. The pH assay allows activity measurements in the presence of ADP; ATP concentration decreases while concentrations of both ADP and Pi increase as the reaction proceeds. As the ADP concentration increases, so does the possibility of ADP inhibition. The Pi assay keeps the concentration of Pi negligibly small, while the ATP and ADP concentrations change reciprocally during the reaction. All three assay methods provided time resolution in the range of seconds. We plotted the data as differentials of the original kinetic traces that represent ATPase activity, to directly see the changes in ATPase activity over time. In this report, we measured the FOF1 ATPase activity in both reconstituted proteoliposomes and inverted membrane vesicles prepared from E. coli. The reactions were initiated by the addition of ATP to final concentration of 1 mm. As ATP hydrolysis proceeded, pmf was built up across membranes and acted as “backpressure” that limited the rate of ATP hydrolysis. Valinomycin and nigericin, which collectively act as an uncoupler (in the presence of K+), dissipated the pmf. Hereafter, we refer to the valinomycin-nigericin mixture as “uncoupler”. Effect of Uncoupler and ADP on the ATPase Activity of Wild-type TF0F1 in Proteoliposomes—We measured ATPase activities of wild-type TFOF1 and mutant TFOF1(ϵΔC) reconstituted into proteoliposome membranes in the presence of 2.5 mm Pi (Fig. 1). With the ADP assay, the wild-type TFOF1 exhibited low hydrolysis activity that gradually increased, reaching a higher steady-state level (Fig. 1A, red trace). The apparent time constant (τ) of this activation (hereafter denoted as “initial activation”) was ∼40 s. In the presence of uncoupler, this initial low activity increased at a slow rate (τ ∼60 s), reaching an ∼2-fold higher steady-state level compared with that in the absence of uncoupler (Fig. 1A, blue trace). This higher steady-state activity was due to the abolishment of the pmf back-pressure. The stimulating effect of uncoupler was also observed when uncoupler was added during the reaction (Fig. 1A, yellow trace). Similar measurements were done using the pH assay (Fig. 1C). In this assay, the initial ADP concentration was ∼5 μm (due to contamination of the ATP preparation used), gradually increasing to ∼100 μm after several minutes of ATP hydrolysis. The time course in the absence of uncoupler was almost identical to that seen with the ADP assay (Fig. 1C, red trace). In the presence of uncoupler, ATPase activity reached a maximum after initial activation (τ ∼10 s). However, in contrast to the ADP assay, the activity slowly decreased (Fig. 1C, blue trace). This slow decrease can be attributed to ADP inhibition caused by the increase in ADP concentration. The addition of uncoupler during the reaction induced a steep increase in activity that was followed by a rapid decay (Fig. 1C, yellow trace). As mentioned, FOF1 is readily inhibited by ADP. Consequently, ATPase activity was very low when measured in the presence of 640 μm ADP (Fig. 1E, red trace; note the expanded y-axis scale). During the assay, ATPase activity increased slowly (τ ∼ 60 s). However, activity in the presence of uncoupler was not stimulated and remained low (Fig. 1E, blue trace). We noted that activity in the presence of uncoupler was lower than that in the absence of uncoupler. Similarly, addition of uncoupler during the reaction induced an immediate decrease in activity (Fig. 1E, yellow trace). Thus, the effect of uncoupling on the ATPase activity of wild-type TFOF1 was reversed in the presence of ADP; ATPase activity was inhibited rather than stimulated by uncoupler. These results suggest that pmf assists TFOF1 in recovery from ADP inhibition. Effect of Uncoupler and ADP on the ATPase Activity of TF0F1(ϵΔC) in Proteoliposomes—To determine the contribution of the two C-terminal helices of the subunit ϵ to ATPase activity, we examined the activity of the TFOF1(ϵΔC) mutant, which lacks the C-terminal region of subunit ϵ. As reported previously (42Kato-Yamada Y. Bald D. Koike M. Motohashi K. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33991-33994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), in the ADP assay, the mutant enzyme immediately hydrolyzed ATP at a maximal, steady-state rate without apparent initial activation (Fig. 1B, red trace). Uncoupler added either prior to or during the reaction immediately increased the activity, but again slow initial activation was not observed in the TFOF1(ϵΔC) mutant. These results suggested that the C-terminal domain of subunit ϵ was responsible for the low initial ATPase activity. It was likely that the relief of subunit ϵ inhibitory effect, but not pmf, caused the initial activation of the wild-type TFOF1 in the ADP assay. With the pH assay, a similar trace was obtained in the absence of uncoupler (Fig. 1D, red trace). Steady-state activity was reached without obvious initial activation. However, activity in the presence of uncoupler measured with the pH assay was very different from that measured with the ADP assay; the initial activity was high and it immediately started to decay (Fig. 1D, blue trace). The decay continued below the level of activity in the absence of uncoupler. The addition of uncoupler during the reaction induced a similar response (Fig. 1D, yellow trace). The decay was likely due to progressive inhibition by accumulated ADP as ATP hydrolysis proceeded. The reasons for the high initial activity were not clear. In the presence of 640 μM ADP, the steady-state ATPase activity of TFOF1(ϵΔC) was nearly 2-fold higher than that of wild type under the same conditions (Fig. 1F, red trace). This activity was achieved after a period of initial activation (τ ∼19 s). In the presence of uncoupler, the activity remained low throughout the reaction (Fig. 1F, blue trace). The addition of uncoupler during the reaction caused a decrease in the activity to the same low level (Fig. 1F, yellow trace). It should be noted that in the TFOF1(ϵΔC) mutant (i) the steady state ATPase activity was higher both with and without uncoupler, and (ii) the initial activation in the coupled sample was markedly faster than in the wild-type. These results indicate that the C-terminal domain of subunit ϵ in wild-type TFOF1 increases ADP inhibition by counteracting the effects of pmf. Effect of Pi on the Relief of ADP Inhibition by pmf in Wild-type TF0F1 and TF0F1(ϵΔC)—All the experiments shown in Fig. 1 were done in the presence of 2.5 mm Pi. To investigate the effect of Pi on the relief of ADP inhibition by pmf, we compared the activity of TFOF1 in the presence and absence of Pi (Fig. 2, A and C; note that 640 μm ADP was present). Without added Pi, ATPase activity was unaffected by the presence of uncoupler; in other words, pmf did not relieve ADP inhibition if Pi was not present. Next, the same measurements were done for TFOF1(ϵΔC). In contrast to wild-type TFOF1, the effect of pmf was obvious even without added Pi. Steady-state ATPase activity was significantly higher without uncoupler than in its presence (Fig. 2D). It should be noted, however, that the initial activation was markedly slower when Pi was omitted (compare red traces in Fig. 2, B and D). The above-mentioned slow activation could be due to a gradual increase in Pi concentration resulting from ATP hydrolysis during the pH assay. To address this possibility, we measured the ATPase activity of TFOF1(ϵΔC) using the Pi assay (Fig. 2E). In this assay, Pi produced by ATP hydrolysis is removed instantaneously. The results obtained were markedly different than what was observed with the pH assay (compare Fig. 2, E and D). There was no detectable effect of uncoupler on activity. The same results were observed for the wild-type enzyme using the Pi assay (not shown), implying that the relief of ADP inhibition by pmf was dependent upon Pi.

The newborn neurons then migrate away from the proliferative zone and enter the cortical plate. The molecules that coordinate migration with neuronal differentiation have been unclear. We have proposed in this study that the cdk inhibitors p57 and p27 play a role in this coordination. We have found that p57 and p27 mRNA increase upon neuronal differentiation of neocortical neuroepithelial cells. Knockdown of p57 by RNA interference resulted in a significant delay in the migration of neurons that entered the cortical plate but did not affect neuronal differentiation. Knockdown of p27 also inhibits neuronal migration in the intermediate zone as well as in the cortical plate, as reported by others. We have also found that knockdown of p27 increases p57 mRNA levels. These results suggest that both p57 and p27 play essential roles in neuronal migration and may, in concert, coordinate the timing of neuronal differentiation, migration, and possibly cell cycle arrest in neocortical development.

In the developing mammalian cerebral cortex, cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration are highly coordinated and temporally linked. Neocortical neurons are generated in the proliferative pseudostratified ventricular zone, where neural precursor cells undergo massive expansion before they differentiate into cortical neurons and exit the cell cycle. Newborn neurons leave the ventricular zone and move toward the cortical pial surface in a highly ordered process of neuronal migration (1Takahashi T. Goto T. Miyama S. Nowakowski R.S.

The precise temporal coupling between neuronal differentiation, cell cycle arrest, and migration is essential for determining the number and location of each type of neurons generated through orchestrated waves of cortical neurogenesis and thus for the formation of the organized layers of the neocortex. Although the proneural basic helix-loop-helix protein Neurogenin2 has been reported to be involved in cell migration (3Hand R. Bortone D. Mattar P. Nguyen L. Heng J.I. Guerrier S. Boutt E. Peters E.

One candidate that may couple neuronal differentiation, cell cycle arrest, and cell migration is p27, a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) 3The abbreviations used are: cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; En, embryonic day n; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; EGF, epidermal growth factor; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; RT, reverse transcription; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine. -interacting protein/kinase inhibitor protein (Cip/Kip) family of the cdk inhibitors. Nuclear p27 negatively regulates G1 cell cycle progression by sequestering and inactivating cyclin E or A-cdk2 complexes. p27 protein levels are increased upon induction of neuronal differentiation, and this is implicated in the cell cycle arrest of neural precursor cells during cortical development (5Fero M.L.

However, emerging data also suggest a role for cytoplasmic p27 in the regulation of cell migration, independent of cyclin-cdk inhibition. For example, mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient in p27 exhibited impaired cell motility, whereas expression of p27 has been shown to promote migration of HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma, embryonic fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells (8Besson A. Assoian R.K. Roberts J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 948-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of p27 is capable of rescuing the migration defect of p27-deficient fibroblasts and thus appears to be responsible for the regulation of cell motility (9Besson A. Gurian-West M. Schmidt A. Hall A. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 862-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Very recently, it has been shown that knockdown of p27 by RNA interference or p27 gene deletion results in a delay in neuronal migration in the developing neocortex (10Kawauchi T. Chihama K.

We also found that acute knockdown of p27 by RNA interference inhibits neuronal migration, although deletion of p27 had less of an inhibitory effect (see “Results and Discussion”). This observation prompted us to examine the possibility that some related molecule might compensate for the function of p27 to regulate neuronal migration within the developing neocortex when the p27 gene was deleted. The member of the cdk inhibitor family closest to p27 is p57 (12Lee M.H. Reynisdottir I. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 13Matsuoka S. Edwards M.C.

Indeed, p27 and p57 function redundantly to control cell cycle arrest and the differentiation of lens fiber cells and placental trophoblasts, as revealed by the phenotypes of single and double mutants (14Zhang P. Wong C. DePinho R.A. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3162-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). p57 is expressed in the neocortex during development, but its functions in the developing neocortex are largely unknown (15Yan Y.

In addition to a well conserved cdk inhibitor domain in the N-terminal half, p27 and p57 share a QT domain with a low similarity in the C-terminal half, which is important for recognition by SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein complex (SCF)skp2-dependent ubiquitylation and for degradation of each protein (18Kamura T. Hara T. Kotoshiba S. Yada M. Ishida N. Imaki H. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, it has been unknown whether p57 is involved in cell migration. In this study, we found that the level of p57 transcript was elevated when p27 was knocked down in neuroepithelial cells. We also observed an increase in p57 and p27 mRNA after induction of neuronal differentiation. Moreover, we found that knockdown of p57 resulted in impaired neuronal migration in the cortical plate of developing neocortex, although it did not affect neuronal differentiation. These results suggest that p57 is involved in neocortical neuronal migration and possibly compensates in part for the functions of p27 in this process. Plasmids—To construct short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-expressing vectors, oligonucleotides targeting the coding sequence and their complementary sequences were inserted into pSIREN vector (BD Biosciences). All contain a nine-base hairpin loop sequence (5′-TTCAAGAGA-3′). The targeting sequences used in this study are as follows: p27 shRNA (5′-GTGGAATTTCGACTTTCAG-3′), p57 shRNA number 1 (5′-GCAGGACGAGAATCAAGAG-3′), p57 shRNA number 2 (5′-GAGAACTGCGCAGGAGAAC-3′), control shRNA (5′-GCACTGCCGGGATATGGAA-3′) (Fig. 1), control shRNA (5′-GTGCGTTGCTAGTACCCAC-3′) (Fig. 2), and control shRNA (5′-TGCGAACGACTTCTTCGCC-3′) (Figs. 3 and 4 and supplemental Figs. S3 and S5). We used control shRNA plasmids that were originally designed to target the p27 or p57 coding sequence but did not reduce p27 or p57 expression (Fig. 1 and 3, respectively). We used shRNA that targets the luciferase gene product as a control shRNA plasmid (Fig. 2). Under the conditions used in this study, no detectable effect on neuronal migration was observed by the expression of these control shRNAs (supplemental Fig. S6). We also verified that neither of the control shRNAs used in this study affected the expression of p27 or p57 (data not shown).FIGURE 2Expression patterns of p27 and p57 during neocortical development.

Retrovirus particles were collected by centrifugation of culture supernatants of the transfected cells at 6,000 × g for 16 h, resuspended in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12, and used to infect cells for 24 h. Under the conditions used in this study, the infection efficiency was 60-70% for cortical primary culture and mouse embryonic fibroblasts and ∼95% for NIH3T3 cells (data not shown). In Utero Electroporation—Introduction of plasmid DNA into neuroepithelial cells of mouse developing neocortex was performed as previously described (20Hirabayashi Y. Itoh Y. Tabata H. Nakajima K.

Neuroscience. 2001; 103: 865-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was expressed by introducing the pCAGIG vector at 1 μg/μl. pSIREN shRNA-expressing vector was injected at 1 μg/μl. Briefly, mixtures of plasmid DNA solution were injected into the lateral ventricle of each littermate at embryonic day (E)14 (ICR background mice) or E15 (C57/BL6 background mice). Electrodes were positioned at the flanking ventricular regions of each embryo and pulsed four or five times at 35 V for 50 ms, with intervals of 950 ms, with an electroporator (CUY21E, Tokiwa Science). The uterine horn was returned to the abdominal cavity to allow the embryos to continue development. The embryos were harvested after the number of days indicated in the figure legends, and the brains were examined immunohistochemically as previously described (22Yoshimatsu T. Kawaguchi D. Oishi K. Takeda K. Akira S. Masuyama N. Gotoh Y. Development (Camb.). 2006; 133: 2553-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Antibodies, Neocortical Primary Culture, and Immunocytochemistry—Primary antibodies used in this study were rabbit anti-p27 (C-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-p27 (clone 57; BD Biosciences), rabbit anti-p57 (Sigma), rabbit anti-p57 (C-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-GAPDH (Chemicon), rabbit anti-GFP (MBL), mouse anti-βIII-tubulin (TuJ1, Covance), mouse anti-Nestin (BD Biosciences), mouse anti-HuC/D (Molecular Probes), mouse anti-microtubule-associated protein MAP2a/b (AP20; Sigma), and mouse anti-BrdUrd (BD Biosciences). Immune complexes were detected with Alexa Fluor 488- or Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated secondary antibodies. Neocortical neuroepithelial cells were isolated and subjected to immunocytochemistry as described previously (20Hirabayashi Y. Itoh Y. Tabata H. Nakajima K. Akiyama T. Masuyama N. Gotoh Y. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 2791-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Quantitative Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR Analysis— Quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed as previously described (22Yoshimatsu T. Kawaguchi D. Oishi K. Takeda K. Akira S. Masuyama N. Gotoh Y. Development (Camb.). 2006; 133: 2553-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The sense and antisense primers, respectively, were as follows: GAPDH (5′-TGGGTGTGAACCACGAG-3′ and 5′-AAGTTGTCATGGATGACCTT-3′), p27 (5′-TCAGCGCAAGTGGAATTT-3′ and 5′-GGGCCTGTAGTAGAACTCG-3′), p57 (5′-GGACCTTTCGTTCATGTAGC-3′ and 5′-ACATGGTACAGAGTGTTCTCA-3′), and p21 (5′-CACCTCTAAGGCCAGCTA-3′ and 5′-AGCAATGTCAAGAGTCGG-3′). BrdUrd Birth Date Analysis—E14 or E15 pregnant p27+/- mothers plugged by a p27+/- male mouse (C57/BL6 background) were given a single injection of BrdUrd intraperitoneally at 50 mg/kg body weight. The embryos were grown for the times indicated in the figure legends. After antigen retrieval by autoclave treatment for 15 min at 105 °C in 10 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0), the coronal brain sections were subjected to immunohistochemistry with antibodies to BrdUrd. Two recent studies have reported that knockdown of p27 in the developing mouse neocortex by the introduction of shRNA targeting p27 causes delayed neuronal migration (10Kawauchi T. Chihama K. Nabeshima Y. Hoshino M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 11Nguyen L. Besson A. Heng J.I. Schuurmans C. Teboul L. Parras C. Philpott A. Roberts J.M. Guillemot F. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1511-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). We independently obtained similar results by the use of a different shRNA against p27, as shown in Fig. 1. p27 shRNA (but not control shRNA) effectively reduced the amount of endogenous p27 protein when introduced into NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 1A). When a plasmid expressing p27 shRNA, together with that of EGFP, was introduced into neuroepithelial cells in the developing neocortex of ICR mice at E14 by in utero electroporation, the immunoreactivity of p27 was reduced only in the GFP-positive cells at E18 (Fig. 1B). Remarkably, in this experiment, expression of p27 shRNA, together with EGFP, caused a significant delay in the radial migration of neocortical cells at E18 compared with the expression of control shRNA with EGFP or EGFP alone (Fig. 1, C and D). Cells expressing p27 shRNA accumulated in the intermediate zone and the lower cortical plate, suggesting that cell migration from the intermediate zone to and through the cortical plate was impaired. A delay in neuronal migration was also observed when p27 shRNA was introduced into the neocortical neuroepithelium of mice of a C57/BL6J background at E15, and the cellular position was analyzed at E19 (supplemental Fig. S1). We also examined the role of p27 in neocortical neuronal migration by analyzing mice in which the p27 gene had been deleted. Neuronal migration was investigated by a pulse administration of BrdUrd at E15 and subsequent detection of BrdUrd-positive cells in the brain at E19. To our surprise, neuronal migration was only slightly affected in homozygous (p27-/-) C57/BL6J mice compared with their wild-type littermates (Fig. 1E). Although the number of BrdUrd-positive cells in the upper cortical plate decreased slightly in p27-/- mice (Fig. 1F), this might be attributable to the enlargement of the brain and increase in the migration distance between the ventricular zone and cortical plate in these mice, as previously reported (5Fero M.L. Rivkin M. Tasch M. Porter P. Carow C.E. Firpo E. Polyak K. Tsai L.H. Broudy V. Perlmutter R.M. Kaushansky K. Roberts J.M.

Nakayama K. Cell. 1996; 85: 707-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1475) Google Scholar). Deletion of the p27 gene had little effect on the percentage of cells localized at the intermediate zone (Fig. 1F). We also observed only subtle defects in neuronal migration in p27-deficient mice when BrdUrd was administrated at E14 and detected at E17 or E18 (supplemental Fig. S2; data not shown). Thus, long term loss of the p27 gene might induce some compensatory mechanism that substitutes for its function in neuronal migration. We therefore examined whether reduction of p27 expression affects the levels of p27-related molecules in neocortical cultures. The Cip/Kip family of Cdk inhibitors consists of three members, p21, p27, and p57. We focused on p57, because p27 and p57 are structurally related and genetically interact in the developing retina (14Zhang P. Wong C. DePinho R.A. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3162-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). When endogenous p27 was knocked down by RNA interference in neuroepithelial culture prepared from E11 mouse neocortex, the level of p57 mRNA was significantly increased, whereas that of p21 mRNA was unaffected (Fig. 2A). This suggested that p57 could play a compensatory role to replace p27 in differentiating neurons. Supporting a possible role for p57 in neurons (together with p27), we observed that the amounts of p57 and p27 mRNA (but not those of p21 mRNA) were increased upon neuronal differentiation induced by removal of growth factors (fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 2 and epidermal growth factor (EGF)) in these neuroepithelial cultures (Fig. 2B). In the developing neocortex, p57 protein was mainly localized in the cortical plate and to a lesser extent in the intermediate zone (Fig. 2C), as described by a previous report (11Nguyen L. Besson A. Heng J.I. Schuurmans C. Teboul L. Parras C. Philpott A. Roberts J.M. Guillemot F. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1511-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). On the other hand, p27 staining was found to be intense in the intermediate zone and cortical plate and faint in the subventricular and ventricular zones, as previously reported (Fig. 2D) (11Nguyen L. Besson A. Heng J.I. Schuurmans C. Teboul L. Parras C. Philpott A. Roberts J.M. Guillemot F. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1511-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). These results were consistent with the possibility that p57 may be up-regulated when p27 is absent or when neurons exit the cell cycle, and p57 may thus partially substitute for deletion of the p27 gene. Because p57 is expressed in newly differentiated neurons, we next investigated whether p57 plays a role in neuronal migration. We designed two different shRNAs targeting p57 (p57 shRNA numbers 1 and 2), which effectively, although not completely, reduced the amounts of endogenous p57 protein in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (Fig. 3A) and endogenous p57 mRNA in primary neuroepithelial cultures (Fig. 3B). This partial reduction of p57 might be in part because of the inefficient viral infection under the conditions used in this study (60-70% efficiency) (Fig. 3, A and B). When p57 shRNA numbers 1 and 2 (but not control shRNA) was introduced into E14 mouse cortex by in utero electroporation, we observed impaired radial neuronal migration when the neuronal localization was analyzed at E18 (Fig. 3, D and E). In brains expressing control shRNA together with EGFP or EGFP alone, most GFP-positive cells migrated to reach the superficial layer. On the other hand, many cells expressing p57 shRNA number 1 or 2 still had not reached the brain surface (Fig. 3, D and E). We confirmed by immunohistochemistry that the immunoreactivity of p57 was indeed reduced in the migrating neurons harboring p57 shRNA number 2 and GFP but not GFP alone (Fig. 3C). In contrast to the effects of p27 knockdown (see the effects of p27 shRNA in Fig. 1, C and D), most of the cells expressing p57 shRNA number 1 or 2 migrated beyond the intermediate zone but accumulated in the middle and lower cortical plate (Fig. 3, D and E). We next asked what might have caused impaired neuronal migration within the cortical plate in the absence of p57. Neuronal migration can be affected by radial scaffolds (radial fibers of neural precursor cells) that support neuronal migration in a non-cell autonomous manner. We performed immunostaining of radial fibers with an antibody against Nestin, a marker of neural precursor cells. We found no distinguishable differences in the radial fibers of neuroepithelial cells expressing p57 shRNA number 2 versus those of normal neuroepithelial cells (supplemental Fig. S3). In addition, because migration defects could be observed even when p57 was knocked down in only a small number of neuroepithelial cells in the neocortex (data not shown), it is likely that cell-autonomous mechanisms are crucial for the effects of p57 on neuronal migration. It has been established that cytoskeletal organization plays a central role in regulating neuronal morphology and migration in a cell-autonomous manner. We, however, observed no gross morphological changes of neurons expressing p57 shRNA number 2 (supplemental Fig. S4A). Moreover, expression of p57 shRNA number 2 had little effect on F-actin organization, as detected by staining with Alexa 594-labeled phalloidin (supplemental Fig. S4B). Localization of microtubule-associated protein 2, which identifies microtubule networks, was also unaffected by the reduction of p57 protein by shRNA number 2 (supplementary Fig. S4C). We then examined the possibility that p57 affects neuronal migration through its potential to regulate neuronal differentiation. To test this, we electroporated a plasmid expressing p57 shRNA into the neuroepithelial cells of mouse neocortex at E14 and examined the neuronal differentiation of the plasmid-expressing (GFP-positive) cells at E16. Neuronal differentiation was examined by immunohistochemistry using the pan-neuronal markers βIII-tubulin (detected by an antibody called TuJ1) and HuC/D, which are expressed both in immature and mature neurons. βIII-tubulin is localized mainly within the microtubule network of neurons, whereas HuC/D is localized predominantly to the cell soma (23Sakakibara S. Okano H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8300-8312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Knockdown of p57, however, did not affect neuronal differentiation (Fig. 4 and supplemental Fig. S5). These results do not necessarily mean that p57 is dispensable for neuronal differentiation or establishment of cell morphology, given that the knockdown of p57 was not complete, but suggest that the migration defects observed by p57 knockdown were not a secondary effect caused by gross changes in either of these processes. These results together suggest that p57 directly controls neuronal migration in the developing neocortex. In this study, we found that p57 regulates radial migration of newly differentiated neurons within the neocortex. Knockdown of p57 caused delayed migration within the cortical plate. This delay appeared to be independent of radial fiber formation or the timing of neuronal differentiation, because knockdown of p57 had little effect on either of these events. It is thus unclear how p57 regulates neuronal migration. p57 has been shown to sequester LIM-kinase into the nucleus and inactivate it, resulting in the activation of actin-depolymerizing factor cofilin, which is usually phosphorylated and inactivated by LIM-kinase in the cytoplasm (24Yokoo T. Toyoshima H. Miura M. Wang Y. Iida K.T. Suzuki H. Sone H. Shimano H. Gotoda T. Nishimori S. Tanaka K. Yamada N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52919-52923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, we could not detect gross changes in F-actin organization caused by p57 knockdown (supplemental Fig. S4B), although this does not exclude the possibility that actin organization is affected locally, such as in the leading process of migrating neurons. Further study is necessary to elucidate the function of p57 and its downstream effectors in neuronal migration. In addition to p57, we have also revealed that p27 regulates neuronal migration by introduction of p27 shRNA into developing mouse neocortex, in agreement with two recent reports (10Kawauchi T. Chihama K. Nabeshima Y. Hoshino M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 11Nguyen L. Besson A. Heng J.I. Schuurmans C. Teboul L. Parras C. Philpott A. Roberts J.M. Guillemot F. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1511-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). p27 has been shown to affect actin organization by inhibiting the interaction between RhoA and its guanine-nucleotide exchange factors via its C-terminal domain (9Besson A. Gurian-West M. Schmidt A. Hall A. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 862-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Because p57 and p27 share a common QT domain in their C-terminal domains, it would be interesting to examine whether the QT domain contributes to the regulation of actin organization and neuronal migration in future studies. p57 and p27 may have overlapping functions in the regulation of neuronal migration, but they may also have distinct functions, because the phenotypes resulting from their respective knockdowns are somewhat different (Figs. 1C and 3D); knockdown of either p57 or p27 resulted in a delayed neuronal migration within the cortical plate, whereas knockdown of p27 (but not of p57) resulted in accumulation of migrating neurons in the intermediate zone. It is possible that the differential expression patterns of these proteins account for this difference, because p27 (but not p57) is expressed in the newly differentiating neurons localized in the intermediate zone, whereas both proteins are expressed in the neurons in the cortical plate (Fig. 2, C and D). In the developing neocortex, neuronal fate commitment is linked to cell cycle exit and radial migration. We found that p57, in addition to p27, is induced upon neuronal differentiation and that p57 plays an essential role in neuronal migration. We therefore propose that the cell cycle inhibitor p57 may act in concert with p27 in coordinating the timing of three events that are key to neocortical development, neuronal differentiation, cell cycle exit, and neuronal migration, and thereby contribute to the establishment of the finely organized neocortical structure.

https://openalex.org/W2144682901,"The developing reproductive tract is sensitive to endocrine perturbation. Bisphenol A (BPA), a xenoestrogen, is a common component of food storage plastics and dental composites. We tested the ability of BPA to alter expression of HOXA10, a gene necessary for uterine development. A dose-response increase in HOXA10 mRNA expression was demonstrated in Ishikawa cells treated with 0.1 nM to 25 microM BPA. To determine whether in utero BPA exposure resulted in a lasting alteration of uterine HOXA10 expression, mice were treated with 0.5-5.0 mg/kg BPA on gestational days 9-16. A dose-responsive increase was seen in stromal cell HOXA10 expression in 2- and 6-week-old mice exposed in utero. To discern the mechanism of BPA action, the HOXA10 estrogen response element (ERE) and autoregulatory element (ARE) were tested for BPA responsiveness. BPA drove luciferase expression from HOXA10-ERE and ARE reporter constructs. HOXA10 ERE mediated induction was blocked by ER antagonist ICI, while HOXA10 ARE induction was blocked by either ICI or HOXA10 antisense. BPA affects HOXA10 expression through the HOXA10 ERE and indirectly through the ARE. BPA initially alters HOXA10 expression through the ERE, however, the response is imprinted and uncoupled from estrogen stimulation in the adult. Several xenoestrogens alter HOX gene expression, indicating that HOX genes are a common target of endocrine disruption. In utero exposure to a xenoestrogen produces reproductive tract alterations by imprinting essential developmental regulatory genes."

In fact, deletion of the plug confers to the cell and to the membranes a Prl-like phenotype: reduced proton-motive force dependence of translocation, increased membrane insertion of SecA, diminished requirement for functional leader peptide, and weakened SecYEG subunit association. Although the plug domain does not seem essential, locking the plug in the center of the channel inactivates the translocon.

The crystal structure of the Methanococcus jannaschii SecY complex (6Van den Berg B. Clemons Jr., W.M. Collinson I. Modis Y. Hartmann E. Harrison S.C. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2004; 427: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar) has unraveled the architecture of the core translocon. It consists of four key structural elements: the “channel,” located in the body of the SecY subunit; the “pore ring” made of 6 residues forming a constriction point in the middle of the channel; the “plug” domain formed by a small helix seating on top of the constriction on its periplamic side; and the “lateral gate” made by the juxtaposition of two SecY transmembrane (TM2 and TM7) segments that create an opening toward the lipid bilayer. The pore ring and the plug domain were proposed to close and to seal the channel, whereas the lateral gate would serve to accommodate the leader peptide of the preprotein or to release membrane protein domains into the membrane (6Van den Berg B.

Rapoport T.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 390-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Increasing experimental evidences support the model predicted from the crystal structure. Using a photo-cross-linking approach, it was demonstrated that the leader peptide contacts the two TM segments forming the lateral gate (8Plath K. Mothes W. Wilkinson B.M. Stirling C.J. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1998; 94: 795-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Using disulfide cross-linking techniques, it was shown that the plug moves away from the center of the channel (9Tam P.C. Maillard A.P. Chan K.K. Duong F. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3380-3388Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), whereas the polypep-tide substrate transits through the pore ring of the SecY subunit (10Cannon K.S. Or E. Clemons Jr., W.M. Shibata Y. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Retrospectively, the proposed mechanism of SecYEG channel gating is also supported by earlier studies. A specific class of mutations, called prl, into the SecY or SecE subunit allow the transport of proteins with defective or even missing leader peptides (11Bieker K.L. Phillips G.J. Silhavy T.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1990; 22: 291-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 12Derman A.I. Puziss J.W. Bassford Jr., P.J. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 879-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies showed that the mutation prlA4 enhances the translocation rates, abrogates the stimulatory effect of the PMF, and increases the affinity of the SecYEG complex for SecA (13Nouwen N. de Kruijff B. Tommassen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5953-5957Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 14van der Wolk J.P. Fekkes P. Boorsma A. Huie J.L. Silhavy T.J. Driessen A.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3631-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Analyses of the stability of the SecYEG complexes carrying the prl mutations led to the proposal that these various phenotypes result from a loosened association among the SecYEG subunits (15Duong F. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3263-3270Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The crystal structure shows that most of the prl mutations are located in the pore ring or in the plug domain, and these mutations may indeed destabilize the closed state of the channel (6Van den Berg B. Clemons Jr., W.M. Collinson I. Modis Y. Hartmann E. Harrison S.C. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2004; 427: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have analyzed further the contribution of the plug domain to the gating mechanism of the translocon. Our results show that the plug is not essential for the function of the SecYEG complex, both in vivo and in vitro. These results are in agreement with a recent study performed on the yeast translocon (16Junne T. Schwede T. Goder V. Spiess M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4063-4068Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, in bacteria, we find that deletion of the plug enhances the activity of the channel during ATP-driven translocation and causes a phenotype similar to the Prl mutations. Accordingly, the absence of the plug results in loosened SecYEG subunit associations. The results suggest that the plug domain is not essential to seal the channel but rather acts as a structural element necessary for the stability, regulation, and selectivity of the translocon. Materials—ATP, AMP-PNP, carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone, and the monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin antibody were purchased from Sigma. β-octyl-glucoside and dodecyl-maltopyranoside (DDM) were purchased from Roche Applied Science and Anatrace. Mouse monoclonal antibody raised against the last cytoplasmic loop of SecY was a gift from Dr. I. Collinson. Polyvinylidene fluoride membrane used in Western blotting was purchased from Bio-Rad. Goat anti-mouse antibody coupled to the horseradish peroxydase was from Jackson Laboratories. Plamids and Constructs—The plasmid pBAD22-hisEYG and pBAD22-HAEYG carrying the prl mutations used in this study were previously described (15Duong F. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3263-3270Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 17Douville K. Price A. Eichler J. Economou A. Wickner W. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2462-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The structure of M. jannaschii (Protein Data Bank: 1RHZ) and the published sequence alignments (6Van den Berg B. Clemons Jr., W.M. Collinson I. Modis Y. Hartmann E. Harrison S.C. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2004; 427: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar) were used to identify the Escherichia coli amino-acyl residues forming the SecY plug domain. The two SecY plug deletions were performed by PCR amplification of the region on each side of the desired deletion followed by digestion and replacement into the parental vector pBAD22-HAEYG. Residues from position 62 to 69 (TM2a) and 42 to 74 (periplasmic loop P1) were deleted to form SecYΔ8 and SecYΔ33, respectively. The deleted regions are replaced by the ApaI restriction site, which encodes for the sequence Gly-Pro. The residues at position Ser-68 and Ser-282 were replaced by cysteines in pBAD-hisEYG using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech). For plasmid expression of SecY in the absence of the SecE subunit, plasmid pBAD22-HAEYG was digested with NheI and SalI, treated with the Klenow fragment, and religated. The plasmid pCM10K-Y+ was built from pKY248 (19Taura T. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 243: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and pCM10K (20Murphy C.K. Stewart E.J. Beckwith J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 155: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). pCM10K-Y+ carries the origin of replication of pBR322, which is destabilized in strains containing the pcnB mutation, the rpsL+ gene, which confers dominant sensitivity to streptomycin, the secY+ gene under the control of the pLac promoter, and the resistance gene to kanamycin. Strain DB824 (MC4100, leu+, araΔ714, malE16, pcnB, secY::aadA, recA::cat, rpsL150) was built in several steps. Briefly, the substitution of the open reading frame of secY by aadA was achieved in E. coli DY378 cells (21Yu D. Ellis H.M. Lee E.C. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Court D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5978-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar) carrying secY on the plasmid pKY248 (19Taura T. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 243: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The product of aadA confers spectinomycin resistance, and the correct disruption of secY was checked by Southern blotting. Strain DB824, which carries secY+ on the plasmid pCM10K-Y+, was produced by P1-mediated transduction of the secY::aadA allele into E. coli DB757 followed by transduction of the recA deletion. The strain becomes resistant to 100 μg/ml streptomycin because of the aadA gene but sensitive to 1.5 mg/ml streptomycin because of the presence of rpsL+. Plasmid pCM10K-Y+ is unstable in DB824 because of the pcnB mutation. The genes coding for SecY, PrlA3, and the two plug-less mutants proteins were cloned in pBAD104, an AmpR plasmid that contains the pSC101 origin of replication compatible with pCM10K-Y+. In Vitro and in Vivo Translocation Assays—Preparation of inner membrane vesicles (IMVs), SecA, proOmpA, and the procedure for 125I radiolabeling were previously described (17Douville K. Price A. Eichler J. Economou A. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20106-20111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 22Bessonneau P. Besson V. Collinson I. Duong F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In vitro translocation assays were performed in 50 μl of TL buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9; 50 mm NaCl; 50 mm KCl; 5 mm MgCl2) containing SecA (40 μg/ml), bovine serum albumin (200 μg/ml), IMVs (50 μg/ml), ATP (2 mm), and 125I-proOmpA (∼60,000 cpm; 0.56 μg/ml; 15 nm). After an 8-min incubation at 37 °C, translocation reactions were stopped on ice, treated with proteinase K (1 mg/ml, 15 min), trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, and analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. Translocation efficiency was measured with a phosphorimaging device using the ImageQuant software and quantified by comparison with 125I-proOmpA standard curve. The SecA membrane insertion assay was performed using urea-stripped IMVs as described previously (23Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The measure of alkaline phosphatase PhoA exported to the periplasm, and the biosynthetic labeling and immuno-precipitation of the maltose-binding protein MalE were performed using protocols described previously (24Bost S. Belin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4087-4093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Intramolecular SecY Cross-links—Cross-link between the cysteine residues Cys-68 and Cys-282 was performed in 50 μl of TL buffer containing bovine serum albumin (200 μg/ml), IMVs (100 μg/ml), and the indicated amount of Cu2+(phenanthroline)3 (CP3) for 10 min at room temperature (9Tam P.C. Maillard A.P. Chan K.K. Duong F. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3380-3388Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Oxidized IMVs were layered over 1 volume of 0.2 m sucrose in TL buffer and reisolated by ultracentrifugation (30 min, 4 °C, 55,000 rpm, Beckman TLA-55 rotor). IMVs were washed three times and resus-pended in TL buffer with brief sonication. Cross-linking efficiency was monitored by trypsin digestion (30 min, 4 °C, 1 mg/ml trypsin). Production of Plug-less Translocation Channels—The plug domain is located in the first periplasmic loop of SecY, just ahead of the transmembrane segment TM2. It is a short, distorted helix that seats atop of the channel, about half-way through the membrane (Fig. 1A). In most organisms, the plug region is connected to TM1 and TM2 by the sequences PΦXG and GΦXP, respectively (where Φ is a conserved hydrophobic amino acid). These motifs are proposed to serve as a hinge for the motion of the plug (6Van den Berg B. Clemons Jr., W.M. Collinson I. Modis Y. Hartmann E. Harrison S.C. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2004; 427: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). In this study, we deleted the plug domain (residues 62–69; hereafter referred to as SecYΔ8) or most of the region delimited by the hinge motifs (residues 42–74; hereafter referred to as SecYΔ33) to minimize the possibility that the missing plug be replaced by adjacent residues from the loop. To determine whether these two deletions affect the stability or activity of the SecY protein, the mutant genes were cloned in the plasmid pBAD22 and introduced into the strain DB703, which carries the secY24 mutation (25Shiba K. Ito K. Yura T. Cerretti D.P. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). secY24 encodes a SecY protein that is fully functional at 30 °C but sufficiently inactive at 42 °C to prevent colony formation on minimal medium glucose plates. The results show that partial complementation is obtained upon expression of the plasmids carrying the plug-less secY alleles (Fig. 1B, top panel), suggesting that activity of the plug-less translocons is somehow altered at 42 °C. Partial complementation is also observed when the plasmid expresses SecY containing the prlA3 mutation (mutation F67C in the plug domain). To analyze further the functionality of the plug-less secY mutants, we tested the ability of the secY mutant alleles to complement the strain DB824. DB824 has the chromosomal secY gene substituted by the aadA gene (which confers spectinomycin resistance) and carries the plasmid pCM10K-Y+ (which encodes a wild-type SecY and confers resistance to kanamycin). This plasmid also carries the rpsL+ gene and therefore confers dominant sensitivity to streptomycin. The genes encoding the secY mutant alleles were cloned onto the pBAD104 plasmid and introduced in strain DB824. Growth in the absence of kanamycin leads to the loss of pCM10K-Y+, but the cells remain viable and become resistant to a high concentration of streptomycin if a functional copy of the secY gene is provided by the plasmid pBAD104. The results show that both the plug-less secY gene and the prlA3 gene complement efficiently the strain DB824 (Fig. 1B, bottom panel). We thus conclude that the plug-less mutants form a functional translocon in cells growing at 37 °C. Finally, the secY mutant genes were cloned along secE and secG to test whether production of a stable SecYEG heterotrimeric complex is possible. Western blot analysis of purified IMVs shows that the SecY, SecE, and SecG proteins are produced to similar levels, regardless of the presence or the absence of the plug domain (Fig. 1C). Because the SecY protein is stable only if it forms a stoichiometric complex with SecE (26Matsuyama S. Akimaru J. Mizushima S. FEBS Lett. 1990; 269: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), the result suggests that the plug-less mutants are correctly assembled in the membrane and that the absence of the plug domain in these over-produced channels is not deleterious to the cell. Activity of the Plug-less Translocation Channel—Previous studies have shown that displacing the SecY-plug away from the center of the channel, either by covalent linkage or by using the prlA3 mutation (which increases the mobility of the plug), enhances the translocation activity of the channel (9Tam P.C. Maillard A.P. Chan K.K. Duong F. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3380-3388Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It is thus conceivable that the deletion of the SecY-plug domain produces the same effect and confers a Prl-like phenotype. The in vitro translocation activity of the two plug-less SecYEG complexes was compared with the activity of the wild-type and the PrlA3 or PrlA4 translocons (Fig. 2A). The prlA4 mutation (I408N located in the pore ring) is the most potent prl mutation isolated to date (27Prinz W.A. Spiess C. Ehrmann M. Schierle C. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5209-5217Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As reported previously (13Nouwen N. de Kruijff B. Tommassen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5953-5957Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 15Duong F. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3263-3270Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), both the prlA3 and the prlA4 mutations abrogate the stimulatory effect of the PMF on polypeptide translocation (Fig. 2A, upper and lower panels). When compared with the activity of the wild-type SecYEG complex measured in the absence of PMF, the prlA3 and prlA4 mutations stimulate proOmpA translocation by a factor of ∼5 and ∼12, respectively. In the presence of PMF, the plug-less SecYΔ8 and SecΔ33 mutant complexes also support efficient polypeptide translocation, at a level comparable with that obtained with the prlA3 mutation. It is clear that the two plug-less SecYEG mutants also bypass the stimulatory effect of the PMF. When compared with the wild type, the plug deletion stimulates the translocation activity by a factor of ∼6. A quantitative analysis using increasing amounts of polypep-tide substrate (Fig. 2B) supports the conclusion that the deletion of the plug domain enhances the activity of the SecYEG complex during ATP-driven translocation. Next, we tested the ability of the plug-less translocation channel to generate the “membrane-inserted state” of SecA, as assessed by the formation of a SecA-30-kDa protease-protected domain (23Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The SecA membrane insertion occurs at the initial step of the translocation cycle, and it represents another way to monitor the activity of the translocon. The results show that the prlA3 and prlA4 mutations increase the yield of protease-protected SecA, in agreement with previous studies (14van der Wolk J.P. Fekkes P. Boorsma A. Huie J.L. Silhavy T.J. Driessen A.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3631-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 15Duong F. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3263-3270Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Similarly, the two plug-less mutants increase the formation of the SecA-30-kDa protease-protected domain (Fig. 2C). Since the plug-less and PrlA mutant complexes present similar in vitro translocation activities, we tested whether the deletion of the plug also confers a Prl phenotype in vivo. The Prl phenotype is characterized by the capacity of the cells to export proteins with a defective leader peptide (28Flower A.M. Doebele R.C. Silhavy T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5607-5614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmids encoding the SecYEG mutant complexes were transformed into a strain producing PhoA(Δ8–9) (29Michaelis S. Inouye H. Oliver D. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 366-374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the amount of exported alkaline phosphatase was measured in the periplasmic fraction of the cells (Fig. 3A). The results show that the deletion of the plug effectively suppresses the translocation defect of PhoA(Δ8–9). The suppression obtained with the SecYΔ8 mutant complex is almost as strong as that observed with the complex carrying the prlA3 or prlA4 mutation. As a complementary assay, we measured the export efficiency of the maltose-binding protein MalE(T16K) (30Bedouelle H. Bassford Jr., P.J. Fowler A.V. Zabin I. Beckwith J. Hofnung M. Nature. 1980; 285: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) using radioactive pulse labeling followed by immunoprecipitation and densitometry scanning. As determined by the extent of signal sequence cleavage, only 10% of the MalE(T16K) protein is exported during the radioactive pulse in cells expressing the wild-type SecYEG complex (Fig. 3B). In contrast, in cells expressing the plug-less SecYEG complexes, the export is strongly improved and almost reaches the level observed in cells expressing the PrlA3 mutant complex. Altogether, the results show that the deletion of the plug domain increases the activity of the SecYEG channel but reduces its selectivity. Structural Stability of the Plug-less Translocation Channel— When extracted from the lipid bilayer with detergents, the SecYEG complex easily dissociates into single subunits (31Brundage L. Fimmel C.J. Mizushima S. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4166-4170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This property was exploited to demonstrate that a fundamental distinction between the wild-type and the PrlA mutant channel resides in the strength of the SecYEG subunit associations (15Duong F. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3263-3270Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The two plug-less SecYEG complexes were thus tested for the stability of their quaternary structure upon extraction from the membrane with DDM. The solubilized membrane proteins were analyzed by blue native-PAGE (BN-PAGE (32Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar)) followed by immunostaining with SecG antibodies (Fig. 4A). As reported previously (22Bessonneau P. Besson V. Collinson I. Duong F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), the SecYEG complex migrates as a population of monomers and dimers, and the same behavior is observed for the SecYEG complex carrying the prlA3 or prlA4 mutation. In contrast, signs of complex instability are observed when analyzing the SecYEG complex with the large SecYΔ33 deletion. With this mutant, the population of SecYEG monomer-dimer is strongly reduced with a concomitant increase of dissociated products, migrating below the SecYEG monomer. The SecYΔ8 deletion also appears to destabilize the SecYEG channel but to a lesser extent. To analyze further the strength of the SecYEG association, the plug-less and PrlA4 mutant complexes were His-tagged and purified by Ni2+-chelating chromatography in the presence of DDM, as described previously (18Collinson I. Breyton C. Duong F. Tziatzios C. Schubert D. Or E. Rapoport T.A. Kuhlbrandt W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2462-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). With SecYΔ33 deletion, the purification yielded only the SecE subunit, as expected since the SecYEG complex readily dissociates during incubation with the detergent (data not shown but see Fig. 4A). The SecYEG complex carrying the secYΔ8 deletion was, however, sufficiently stable to allow its purification, and it was obtained at a yield comparable with the wild-type or the PrlA4 complex. Next, these purified complexes were incubated at room temperature with β-octyl-glucoside and then analyzed by BN-PAGE (Fig. 4B). The detergent β-octyl-glucoside was used in the past to monitor the strength of the SecYEG subunit association (15Duong F. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3263-3270Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 31Brundage L. Fimmel C.J. Mizushima S. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4166-4170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results show that the oligomeric state of the SecYEG complex is shifted toward the monomer when it carries the prlA4 or secYΔ8 mutation (Fig. 4B, left panel). Furthermore, incubation with a higher amount of detergent dissociates further the PrlA4 and SecYΔ8 mutant complexes into single subunits, whereas the wild-type complex remains mostly intact in these conditions (Fig. 4B, middle panel). Altogether, the results show that the SecYEG subunit associations are more fragile when the SecY plug is absent or when SecY carries the prlA4 mutation. The results agree with the proposal that the stability of the SecYEG structure is correlated to the activity of the channel (15Duong F. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3263-3270Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The Dynamics of the Plug Are Essential for Protein Translocation—Disulfide cross-linking studies have shown that the plug domain moves away from the center of the channel during protein translocation (9Tam P.C. Maillard A.P. Chan K.K. Duong F. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3380-3388Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), but this study reveals that the plug domain is not essential per se for the function of the translocon. We thus asked whether the plug dynamics are essential for the translocation reaction. This was achieved by reducing the mobility of the plug by cysteine cross-linking. The crystal structure of the M. jannaschii SecY complex allowed us to predict that the E. coli SecY residues Ser-68 (located in the plug domain) and Ser-282 (located in TM7) would be close to each other in the resting (closed) state of the channel. These 2 aminoacyl residues were replaced by cysteine residues, and the resulting SecYEG complex was overproduced in E. coli. The membranes were isolated and oxidized with CP3 before being reisolated. The presence of a trypsin cleavage site located in the cytosolic loop between TM6 and TM7 of SecY (33Brundage L. Hendrick J.P. Schiebel E. Driessen A.J. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 62: 649-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) allowed monitoring the efficiency of disulfide linkage between the residues Cys-68 and Cys-282 (Fig. 5A). In the presence of trypsin, the SecY protein is digested into two fragments, and the C-terminal fragment (∼14 kDa) is detected using an antibody recognizing the most C-terminal cytoplasmic loop of SecY (Fig. 5A, top panel). When the residues Cys-68 and Cys-282 form a disulfide bond, the N- and C-terminal fragments remain tethered together, and the trypsinolyzed-SecY migrates like the uncleaved SecY on non-reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5A, lower panel). This disulfide bond depends on the presence of both cysteines in SecY (data not shown), and the results show that an efficient covalent linkage is obtained upon incubation of the IMVs with 200 μm CP3 (Fig. 5A). The membranes containing the oxidized SecYEG complex were then tested for their protein translocation activity (Fig. 5B). The results show that the progressive oxidation of the SecYEG complex leads to a concomitant decrease of the protein translocation efficiency. At 200 μm CP3, the plug domain is covalently linked to residue Cys-282 of TM7 (Fig. 5A), and the translocation activity is reduced to a level comparable with that of wild-type membranes (i.e. containing only chromosomally encoded wild-type SecYEG). This reduction of translocation activity depends on the presence of both Cys-68 and Cys-282 in SecY (Fig. 5B). Thus, the mobility of the plug is essential to the mechanism of protein translocation. The crystal structure of the SecY complex represents the closed state of the channel because the central passage is blocked by the plug domain and the constriction ring. For the channel to open, the plug needs to move away, and the constriction ring must expand to widen the passage for outgoing polypeptide substrate. Computer-based simulations support this model (34Bostina M. Mohsin B. Kuhlbrandt W. Collinson I. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 1035-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 35Gumbart J. Schulten K. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 2356-2367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 36Tian P. Andricioaei I. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 2718-2730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and experimental data show that the plug domain is indeed relocated outside the channel toward the C terminus of the SecE subunit during translocation (9Tam P.C. Maillard A.P. Chan K.K. Duong F. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3380-3388Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 37Harris C.R. Silhavy T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3438-3444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that locking the plug in the open state enhances the in vitro activity of the translocon (9Tam P.C. Maillard A.P. Chan K.K. Duong F. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3380-3388Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), whereas locking the plug in its closed position (this study) abolishes translocation. These experimental observations clearly indicate that the movement of the plug is an essential subreaction occurring during polypeptide transport across the membrane. The function of the plug is, however, not yet fully understood. Earlier in vivo experiments showed that the combination of the mutations prlA3 (F67C in the plug domain of SecY) with a cysteine at position 120 in SecE (periplasmic end of SecE) results in synthetic lethality (37Harris C.R. Silhavy T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3438-3444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because formation of a disulfide bridge between the 2 cysteines should leave the channel in a permanently open state, it was logical to suppose that an important function of the plug is to close the channel pore to small molecules. However, both this study in bacteria and a recent study in yeast (16Junne T. Schwede T. Goder V. Spiess M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4063-4068Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) rather indicate that the plug domain is not essential for cell viability or for the general function of the translocon. A partial growth defect is observed on minimal medium at 42 °C when the plug-less SecY protein is overproduced in the absence of its interacting partner SecE (Fig. 1B). The reason remains unclear and could be linked to the stress of cells growing on minimal medium (38Tao H. Bausch C. Richmond C. Blattner F.R. Conway T. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6425-6440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In yeast, the absence of the plug reduces the steady state level and the activity of the translocon, but the cells are viable (16Junne T. Schwede T. Goder V. Spiess M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4063-4068Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Here, we show that overproduction of the plug-less SecYEG complex is possible and does not yield dominant-negative effects. This last observation clearly indicates that the plug domain is not required per se to seal the channel in the resting state. Instead, the constriction ring may be sufficient to hinder ions and other molecules from permeating through the channel. In eukaryotes, there are evidences that the lumenal chaperone BiP forms an alternative or additional sealing system on the extracytoplasmic side of the translocon (39Hamman B.D. Hendershot L.M. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 747-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 40Alder N.N. Shen Y. Brodsky J.L. Hendershot L.M. Johnson A.E. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 389-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Although the role of the plug domain as a membrane seal before or during protein transport cannot be ruled out, our results suggest another function. The results show that the deletion of this domain converts the SecYEG complex into a “Prl-like” translocon. In the majority, the prl in secY mutations are confined to the pore and plug domains (6Van den Berg B. Clemons Jr., W.M. Collinson I. Modis Y. Hartmann E. Harrison S.C. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2004; 427: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar, 41Smith M.A. Clemons Jr., W.M. DeMars C.J. Flower A.M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 6454-6465Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and they confer various in vivo and in vitro phenotypes: enhanced trans-location rates, increased membrane affinity and insertion of SecA, diminished requirement for canonical leader peptides, reduced PMF dependence of translocation, facilitated translocation of folded domains, and for some leader peptides or TM segments, inversion of their membrane topology (13Nouwen N. de Kruijff B. Tommassen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5953-5957Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 14van der Wolk J.P. Fekkes P. Boorsma A. Huie J.L. Silhavy T.J. Driessen A.J.

Boyd D.H. Ehrmann M. Beckwith J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8419-8424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It was proposed that these seemingly unrelated effects all derive from an enhanced conformational flexibility of the trans-location channel (15Duong F. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3263-3270Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the SecYEG complex is expected to be very dynamic to let the polypeptide substrate move through or be released laterally into the lipid bilayer. Our results show that the plug domain interacts with the middle part of TM7 (forming part of the lateral gate), whereas the deletion of the plug domain weakens the SecYEG associations. It is thus possible that the plug domain in the resting position interacts with the inner walls of the channel, which, in turn, contributes to stiffen and stabilize the structure of the channel in the closed state. In such a scenario, binding of the leader peptide between TM2 and TM7 (8Plath K. Mothes W. Wilkinson B.M. Stirling C.J. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1998; 94: 795-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) would disrupt the interaction between the plug domain and the walls of the channel, provoke the relaxation of the channel structure, and enable the widening of the central pore to open the channel for translocation. In conclusion, the genetic selections yielded prl mutations that enhance the dynamics of the plug domain and loosen the SecYEG association of the subunits, whereas preserving sufficient stability for the channel to avoid dissociation. More radical mutations such as the deletion of the plug domain do not affect the basic function of the translocon but, like the prl mutations, relax the channel structure and deregulate its activity. In the absence of the plug domain, the channel becomes less sensitive to the stimulatory effect of the PMF and less selective toward the composition of the leader peptide.

In human cells, the effects of 8-oxoG are counteracted by OGG1, a DNA glycosylase that catalyzes excision of 8-oxoguanine base followed by a much slower β-elimination reaction at the 3′-side of the resulting abasic site. Many features of OGG1 mechanism, including its low β-elimination activity and high specificity for a cytosine base opposite the lesion, remain poorly explained despite the availability of structural information. In this study, we analyzed the substrate specificity and the catalytic mechanism of OGG1 acting on various DNA substrates using stopped-flow kinetics with fluorescence detection. Combining data on intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence to detect conformational transitions in the enzyme molecule and 2-aminopurine reporter fluorescence to follow DNA dynamics, we defined three pre-excision steps and assigned them to the processes of (i) initial encounter with eversion of the damaged base, (ii) insertion of several enzyme residues into DNA, and (iii) enzyme isomerization to the catalytically competent form. The individual rate constants were derived for all reaction stages. Of all conformational changes, we identified the insertion step as mostly responsible for the opposite base specificity of OGG1 toward 8-oxoG:C as compared with 8-oxoG:T, 8-oxoG:G, and 8-oxoG:A. We also investigated the kinetic mechanism of OGG1 stimulation by 8-bromoguanine and showed that this compound affects the rate of β-elimination rather than pre-excision dynamics of DNA and the enzyme. 7,8-Dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) is one of the major DNA lesions formed by reactive oxygen species that can result in transversion mutations following replication if left unrepaired.

Living cells continuously experience a great number of insults from reactive oxygen species that are both produced during aerobic respiration and generated by environmental factors such as ionizing radiation (1Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine.2nd Ed. Clarendon Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar). The adverse effects of oxidative damage to DNA include miscoding and mutagenesis, cytotoxicity, and disregulation of gene expression and may ultimately lead to cancers and aging (2Beckman K.B. Ames B.N. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 547-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (3156) Google Scholar). To counteract these effects, cells maintain an extensive system of antioxidant defense, one branch of which is formed by DNA repair mechanisms (3Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. Wood R.D. Schultz R.A. Ellenberger T. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2006Google Scholar). Base excision repair is one subpathway that mostly deals with non-bulky base lesions and single-strand breaks, the lesions that are predominantly produced by oxidative damage (4Burrows C.J. Muller J.G. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 1109-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar, 5Pogozelski W.K. Tullius T.D. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 1089-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). Base excision repair of damaged bases is initiated by DNA glycosylases, enzymes that recognize such lesions and hydrolyze their N-glycosidic bonds (3Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. Wood R.D. Schultz R.A. Ellenberger T. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2006Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, a prominent role is played by 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase OGG1, which excises 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) 3The abbreviations used are: 8-oxoG, 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine; 8-BrG, 8-bromoguanine; AP, apurinic/apyrimidinic; 2-aPu, 2-aminopurine; F, 3-hydroxytetrahydrofuran-2-yl)methylphosphate (tetrahydrofuran abasic site analog); HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; ODN, oligodeoxynucleotide.

Carcinog. 2005; 42: 127-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and enhanced mutagenesis (10Thomas D. Scot A.D. Barbey R. Padula M. Boiteux S. Mol. Gen.

Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4287-4292PubMed Google Scholar), and accelerated senescence has been observed in a mouse strain with thermolabile OGG1 (12Choi J.-Y. Kim H.-S. Kang H.-K. Lee D.-W. Choi E.-M. Chung M.-H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 848-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In addition to 8-oxoG, OGG1 has been shown to excise formamidopyrimidine derivatives of G (13Karahalil B. Girard P.-M. Boiteux S. Dizdaroglu M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1228-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 14Dherin C. Radicella J.P. Dizdaroglu M. Boiteux S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4001-4007Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). During the reaction, a covalent Schiff base intermediate is formed between an active site lysine residue (Lys-249 in human OGG1) and C-1′ of the damaged nucleoside (15Nash H.M. Lu R. Lane W.S. Verdine G.L. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Similar to other DNA glycosylases that form the Schiff base (16Dodson M.L. Michaels M.L. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32709-32712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), OGG1 possesses an abasic (apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP)) lyase activity, which catalyzes β-elimination at the nascent AP site to break the damaged DNA strand. This activity is weak, being about 1 order of magnitude lower than the glycosylase activity (17Bjørås M. Luna L. Johnsen B. Hoff E. Haug T. Rognes T. Seeberg E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6314-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 18Zharkov D.O. Rosenquist T.A. Gerchman S.E. Grollman A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28607-28617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), but can be enhanced by analogs of 8-oxoG such as 8-bromoguanine (8-BrG) (19Fromme J.C. Bruner S.D. Yang W. Karplus M. Verdine G.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 20Kuznetsov N.A. Koval V.V. Zharkov D.O. Nevinsky G.A. Douglas K.T. Fedorova O.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 3919-3931Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). OGG1 demonstrates a profound specificity for the base opposite the lesion, especially if DNA strand cleavage is used as the assay end point, with C being preferred at this position and purines strongly discriminated against (17Bjørås M. Luna L. Johnsen B. Hoff E. Haug T. Rognes T. Seeberg E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6314-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 18Zharkov D.O. Rosenquist T.A. Gerchman S.E. Grollman A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28607-28617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). If C is opposite the lesion, the enzyme may even excise bases not cleaved in their natural context; for example, it excises 8-oxoadenine from 8-oxoA:C mispairs (18Zharkov D.O. Rosenquist T.A. Gerchman S.E. Grollman A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28607-28617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 21Girard P.M. D'Ham C. Cadet J. Boiteux S. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 1299-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). As with many other DNA glycosylases, the structure of OGG1 is known (22Bruner S.D. Norman D.P.G. Verdine G.L. Nature. 2000; 403: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar), but not all aspects of its substrate preference can be explained solely by structural considerations, suggesting that dynamic features of lesion recognition can contribute to the enzyme specificity (reviewed in Ref. 23Zharkov D.O. Grollman A.P. Mutat. Res. 2005; 577: 24-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Recognition and excision of damaged bases by DNA glycosylases is accompanied by several conformational rearrangements that bring the base into the enzyme catalytic site. As a rule, DNA is severely kinked at the site of the lesion, the damaged nucleotide is everted from the double helix and inserted in a deep catalytic pocket, and several amino acid residues of the enzyme are inserted into the resulting void in DNA (a process commonly referred to as “plugging”) to stabilize the whole structure (for a recent review, see Ref. 24Huffman J.L. Sundheim O. Tainer J.A. Mutat. Res. 2005; 577: 55-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). These processes occur in a rapid consequence and are not easily studied by conventional steady-state enzyme kinetic methods. Recently, stopped-flow techniques have been applied by several groups, including ours, to investigate the multiple conformational changes accompanying damage recognition (20Kuznetsov N.A. Koval V.V.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 926-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In particular, we have used stopped-flow with detection of intrinsic tryptophan (Trp) fluorescence to study the dynamics of 8-oxoG recognition and removal by human OGG1 and its activation by 8-BrG (20Kuznetsov N.A. Koval V.V. Zharkov D.O. Nevinsky G.A. Douglas K.T. Fedorova O.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 3919-3931Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We were able to derive a minimal kinetic scheme (Scheme I) of this process and to suggest the conformational changes underlying each step. However, DNA conformational dynamics during OGG1 catalysis was not addressed, and neither was the amazing opposite-base specificity of this enzyme. In the present study, we have investigated changes in the conformation of DNA processed by OGG1 by using 2-aminopurine (2-aPu) as a fluorescent marker complementing the Trp fluorescent studies. This nucleobase analog has a high quantum yield in aqueous solution, but the fluorescence is highly quenched when it is incorporated into DNA or transferred into a nonpolar environment (30Ward D.C. Reich E. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1228-1237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Rachofsky E.L. Osman R. Ross J.B.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 946-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). These properties make 2-aPu attractive for stopped-flow analysis of protein-DNA interaction; indeed, the combination of Trp and 2-aPu fluorescence has been used to dissect the kinetic pathway of damage recognition by the repair enzyme uracil-DNA glycosylase (32Stivers J.T. Pankiewicz K.W. Watanabe K.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 952-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). We have also analyzed the DNA dynamics associated with stimulation of the AP lyase activity of the enzyme by 8-BrG. Finally, we have addressed the origins of OGG1 specificity for the base opposite the lesion by stopped-flow kinetics. Materials and Buffers—The chemicals used were purchased mostly from Sigma-Aldrich. 8-Bromoguanine was synthesized according to a published procedure (33Long R.A. Robins R.K. Townsend L.B. J. Org. Chem. 1967; 32: 2751-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). T4 polynucleotide kinase was purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). [γ-32P]ATP (>3000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Radioisotope (Moscow). Unless indicated otherwise, all experiments were carried out at 25 °C in a reaction buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 9% glycerol (v/v). Oligodeoxynucleotides and Enzymes—Human OGG1 was purified as described (20Kuznetsov N.A. Koval V.V. Zharkov D.O. Nevinsky G.A. Douglas K.T. Fedorova O.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 3919-3931Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The final enzyme stock of 23.4 μm, as determined spectrophotometrically using the Gill-von Hippel algorithm (34Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar) (ϵ280 = 6.84 × 104 m–1 cm–1), was stored at –20 °C. The purified OGG1 had 65% of the active enzyme form as determined by borohydride trapping with 8-oxoG substrate as follows. The reaction mixture (10 μl) included 2 μm enzyme, 25 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.8), 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaBH4, and varying amounts of oligonucleotide duplex containing an 8-oxoG residue opposite C. The samples were incubated for 1 h at room temperature and analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue and quantified using Gel-Pro Analyzer 4.0 software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). The concentration of active form of enzyme was taken into account in all experiments. The sequences of ODNs used in this work are listed in Table 1. The ODNs were synthesized on an ASM-700 synthesizer (Biosset, Novosibirsk, Russia) using phosphoramidites purchased from Glen Research (Sterling, VA) and purified by anion exchange HPLC on a Nucleosil 100-10 N(CH3)2 column followed by reverse-phase HPLC on a Nucleosil 100-10 C18 column (both columns from Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). The purity of ODNs exceeded 98% as estimated by electrophoresis in 20% denaturing PAGE after staining with the Stains-All dye (Sigma-Aldrich). The concentration of the ODNs was determined from their absorbance at 260 nm. ODN duplexes were prepared by annealing modified and complementary strands taken at 1:1 molar ratio in the reaction buffer described under “Materials and Buffers.”TABLE 1Sequences of oligodeoxynucleotides used in this workShorthandSequenceoxoGd (CTCTC (oxoG) CCTTCC)oxoG-aPud (CTCTC (oxoG) (2 — aPu) CTTCC)AP-aPud (CTCTC (AP) (2 — aPu) CTTCC)F-aPud (CTCTCF (2 — aPu) CTTCC)G-aPud (CTCTCG (2 — aPu) CTTCC)Cd (GGAAGGCGAGAG)Ad (GGAAGGAGAGAG)Gd (GGAAGGGGAGAG)Td (GGAAGGTGAGAG)CCGd (GGAAGCCGAGAG) Open table in a new tab Stopped-flow Fluorescence Measurements—Stopped-flow measurements with fluorescence detection were carried out essentially as described (20Kuznetsov N.A.

To detect intrinsic Trp fluorescence only, λex = 283 nm was used and λem > 320 nm was followed as transmitted by a Schott filter WG 320 (Schott, Mainz, Germany). If 2-aPu was present in the ODNs, λex = 310 nm was used to excite 2-aPu residues, and their emission was followed at λem > 370 nm (Corion filter LG-370); Trp fluorescence of the enzyme (λex = 283 nm) was detected in this case using a Corion filter P10-340, which transmits a 10-nm-wide band at ∼340 nm to avoid overlapping with 2-aPu emission. The dead time of the instrument was 1.4 ms. The concentration of OGG1 in all experiments with Trp fluorescence detection was 2 μm, and concentrations of ODN substrates were varied from 0.5 to 4 μm. The concentration of substrates containing 2-aPu in experiments with 2-aPu fluorescence detection was 1 μm, and concentrations of OGG1 protein were varied from 0.5 to 4 μm. Concentrations of reactants reported are those in the reaction chamber after mixing. Typically, each trace shown is the average of four or more individual experiments.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1520-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), F=(Fobs-Fb)×exp(kb×t)+Fb(Eq. 1) where F is the corrected fluorescence intensity, Fobs is the observed fluorescence intensity, Fb is the background fluorescence, and kb is the coefficient determined for each substrate concentration in experiments with noncleaved substrates. The difference between the observed and corrected values did not exceed 10%. Global Nonlinear Simulation Fitting of Stopped-flow Data—Accurate modeling of all stopped-flow traces was obtained by numerical fitting using DynaFit software (BioKin, Pullman, WA) (36Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar) as described (20Kuznetsov N.A. Koval V.V. Zharkov D.O. Nevinsky G.A. Douglas K.T. Fedorova O.S.

Biochemistry. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Differential equations were written for each species in the mechanisms described by Schemes I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII (see “Results”), and the stopped-flow fluorescence traces were directly fit by expressing the corrected fluorescence intensity (Fc) at any reaction time t as the sum of the background fluorescence (Fb) and the fluorescence intensities of each protein species, Fc=Fb+∑i=0nFi(t)(Eq. 2) where Fi(t) = fi(Ei(t)), fi are the coefficients of specific fluorescence for each discernible OGG1 conformer, and (Ei(t)) are the concentrations of the conformers at any given time t (i = 0 relates to the free protein and i > 0, to the protein-DNA complexes). These specific fluorescence coefficients describe only the part of fluorescence that changes due to DNA binding. The minimal nature of the reaction schemes was confirmed by analyzing the dependence of the standard deviation of the residuals on the number of steps in the scheme using a scree plot (35Kuznetsov N.A.

Reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained reaction buffer, 1, 2, or 4 μm 32P-labeled substrate, and 2 μm enzyme. The reaction was initiated by adding the enzyme and allowed to proceed at 25 °C for 25–60 min. Aliquots (2 μl) were withdrawn as required, mixed with 3 μl of gel-loading dye containing 7 m urea, and analyzed by 20% denaturing PAGE. The gels were exposed to Agfa CP-BU x-ray film (Agfa-Geavert), and the autoradiograms were scanned and quantified using Gel-Pro Analyzer, version 4.0. Kinetic parameters were obtained by numerical fitting using Microcal Origin version 7.0 software (OriginLab, Northampton, MA). Recently, we studied the dynamics of fluorescence of OGG1 tryptophan residues in the course of enzymatic reaction using stopped-flow technique (20Kuznetsov N.A. Koval V.V. Zharkov D.O. Nevinsky G.A. Douglas K.T. Fedorova O.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 3919-3931Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). When the substrate contained 8-oxoG opposite C, a series of changes in Trp fluorescence intensity were observed, attributed to binding and catalytic stages of enzyme process. The proposed kinetic scheme of OGG1 interaction with its DNA substrate included at least three fluorescently discernible consecutive steps accompanying damaged base recognition and its binding in the active site of the enzyme. The rate of damaged base excision (DNA glycosylase activity) by OGG1 is ∼10-fold higher than the rate of elimination of the 3′-phosphate of the damaged nucleotide (AP lyase activity) (18Zharkov D.O. Rosenquist T.A. Gerchman S.E. Grollman A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28607-28617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). This difference allowed us to propose the kinetic mechanism containing three equilibrium steps of the specific complex formation and two non-equilibrium catalytic steps. The nonequilibrium steps were attributed to glycosylase reaction and β-elimination. At the end of the process, formation of an enzyme-product complex was observed indicated by a decrease in final Trp fluorescence intensity in comparison with its initial values (Scheme I). However, only weak changes in the fluorescence intensity of the Trp residues of the enzyme were detected when OGG1 interacted with duplexes containing G, F, or AP residues opposite C (20Kuznetsov N.A. Koval V.V. Zharkov D.O. Nevinsky G.A. Douglas K.T. Fedorova O.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 3919-3931Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In the present work, to gain a better understanding of the recognition of various substrates by OGG1, we studied a set of model duplexes (see Table 1 for the sequences) in which the target residue (8-oxoG, AP site, F, or G; Fig. 1) was flanked by 2-aPu, a fluorescent marker sensitive to the structure of DNA duplex. This approach allowed us to observe conformational changes in the oligonucleotide duplex in parallel with those in the enzyme and to assign conformational changes in the interacting molecules to the elementary steps in Scheme I. Furthermore, we determined the enzyme specificity for substrates with different bases opposite 8-oxoG and defined the stages of discrimination of these substrates by OGG1. We also analyzed the effect of 8-BrG on the processing of substrates containing 8-oxoG or AP. G-ligand—The process of OGG1 binding the nonspecific G-ligand was essentially complete by 0.02 s (Fig. 2A). An increase in fluorescence intensity of 2-aPu was observed, indicating destabilization of Watson-Crick or stacking interactions in the primary nonspecific enzyme-DNA complex (30Ward D.C. Reich E. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1228-1237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Rachofsky E.L. Osman R. Ross J.B.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 946-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Fitting the experimental data to the one-site binding model (Scheme II) gave the values for the forward and reverse rate constants, k1 = (2.4 ± 0.1) × 108 m–1 s–1 and k–1 = 24.2 ± 5.0 s–1, respectively. F-ligand—The kinetic curves for the F-ligand, a non-cleavable analog of the AP site, were characterized by a decrease in 2-aPu fluorescence intensity during 5 s, suggestive of transition of the 2-aPu residue to a more hydrophobic environment (Fig. 2B). This could be the result of filling the abasic void in the DNA duplex by amino acids of OGG1 (37Norman D.P.G. Bruner S.D. Verdine G.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 359-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The rate constants of the forward and reverse reactions of this single-stage mechanism (Scheme II) are k1 = (0.48 ± 0.05) × 106 m–1 s–1 and k–1 = 0.23 ± 0.04 s–1, respectively. AP Substrate—The substrate containing the AP site is expected to interact with the enzyme in a more complicated way. In this case, DNA binding and void-filling by OGG1 should be followed by β-elimination and dissociation of the enzyme-product complex. The last process resulted in an increase in the 2-aPu fluorescence intensity due to a transition of the 2-aminopurine to a more hydrophilic environment (Fig. 2C) at times >100 s. Scheme III describes the observed fluorescence changes in minimal terms. Its first step obviously reflects substrate binding and the transition to the catalytically active complex (E·AP). The irreversible step was attributed to the reaction of β-elimination. Therefore, the final step of the scheme most likely corresponds to the equilibrium between OGG1 and the reaction product. However, although we did see the beginning of this last reversible stage, the equilibrium could not be achieved, likely because of a very tight product binding. Therefore, numerical values were not calculated for Kp; Table 2 presents the rate constants obtained by fitting. The forward and reverse rate constants of the binding step (k1 and k–1, respectively) were close for the F-ligand and AP substrate, suggesting that this step reflects identical processes in both cases.TABLE 2The rate constants for interactions of OGG1 with G- and F-ligands and AP and 8-oxoG substratesConstantsaKbind=∑i=1i=5∏j=1j=iKj.G2-aPuF2-aPuAP2-aPuoxoG2-aPuoxoGTrpk1 (M-1 × s-1)(2.4 ± 0.1) × 108(0.48 ± 0.05) × 106(0.34 ± 0.02) × 106(1.2 ± 0.1) × 108(2.0 ± 0.5) × 108k-1 (s-1)24 ± 50.23 ± 0.040.13 ± 0.03120 ± 10230 ± 90k2 (s-1)0.0015 ± 0.00021.4 ± 0.12.5 ± 0.4k-2 (s-1)1.5 ± 0.10.59 ± 0.07k3 (s-1)0.10 ± 0.010.035 ± 0.010k-3 (s-1)0.013 ± 0.0020.019 ± 0.003k4 (s-1)0.029 ± 0.0010.040 ± 0.001kglyc (s-1)0.03k5 (s-1)0.0036 ± 0.00020.0065 ± 0.0001kelim (s-1)0.006KP (M)NDbND, not determined.(7.0 ± 1.1) × 10-6(3.3 ± 0.4) × 10-6Kbind (M-1)1 × 1072.1 × 1062.6 × 1069.2 × 1061.2 × 107a Kbind=∑i=1i=5∏j=1j=iKj.b ND, not determined."

Many systemic and neurodegenerative disorders whose etiologies are linked to misfolded or unfolded proteins are characterized by the accumulation of intracellular or extracellular protein deposits or aggregates (1Muchowski P.J. Wacker J.L. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). The pathologies of these diseases are complex, and the accumulation of misfolded and unfolded proteins in the cells can contribute to or be causal for at least some of these neurodegenerative and systemic diseases (2Soto C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). However, the direct relationship between the protein deposition and the disease pathology is still controversial.

These soluble amyloid oligomer proteins generally appear to have β-sheet structures, whose formation is correlated with the appearance of a hydrophobic environment (6Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L.

An antibody that specifically recognizes the structure of the amyloid oligomer reacts with oligomers generated from all types of amyloidogenic proteins and peptides, such as Aβ-(1-42), α-synuclein, polyglutamine, and prions (6Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3437) Google Scholar). This result implies that the amyloid oligomer has a shared structure with diverse proteins (6Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3437) Google Scholar). Furthermore, amyloid oligomers from several different proteins share the ability to permeabilize cellular membranes and lipid bilayers, indicating that this may represent the primary toxic mechanism of amyloid pathogenesis (12Glabe C.G. Neurobiol. Aging. 2006; 27: 570-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). This suggests that the amyloid oligomer may share a common mechanism of pathogenic action as a primary toxic species (12Glabe C.G. Neurobiol. Aging. 2006; 27: 570-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The R120G missense mutation in α-β-crystallin (CryAB or HSP B5), which is a small heat-shock protein (HSP), can cause a desmin-related cardiomyopathy (DRM) (13Vicart P. Caron A. Guicheney P. Li Z. Prevost M.C. Faure A. Chateau D. Chapon F. Tome F. Dupret J.M. Paulin D. Fardeau M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). This disease, which is characterized by the formation of aggregates containing CryAB and desmin, can be recapitulated in transgenic mice by expression of the mutant protein specifically in the heart (14Wang X. Osinska H. Klevitsky R. Gerdes A.M. Nieman M. Lorenz J. Hewett T. Robbins J. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). We showed that the R120G missense mutation in the CryAB protein led to perinuclear aggresome formation and that these aggresomes contained the amyloid oligomer (15Sanbe A. Osinska H. Saffitz J.E.

These results suggest that CryAB-DRM is a subclass of the aggresomal and amyloid-related diseases (15Sanbe A. Osinska H. Saffitz J.E. Glabe C.G. Kayed R. Maloyan A. Robbins J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10132-10136Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Furthermore, using a cardiac-specific inducible transgenic system (16Sanbe A. Gulick J. Hanks M.C. Liang Q. Osinska H. Robbins J. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), we found that continuous expression of the mutant protein is needed to sustain the high concentrations of the amyloid oligomer that correlate with depressed cardiac function as well as premature lethality (17Sanbe A. Osinska H. Villa C. Gulick J. Klevitsky R. Glabe C.G. Kayed R. Robbins J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13592-13597Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the CryAB-DRM disease is reversible and that the amyloid oligomer is critical for the DRM disease (17Sanbe A. Osinska H. Villa C. Gulick J. Klevitsky R. Glabe C.G. Kayed R. Robbins J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13592-13597Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The oligomer amyloid was also present in cardiomyocytes derived from multiple human dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathies (15Sanbe A. Osinska H. Saffitz J.E. Glabe C.G. Kayed R. Maloyan A. Robbins J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10132-10136Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Thus, potential commonalities due to the presence of the amyloid oligomer may exist in cardiovascular diseases (15Sanbe A. Osinska H. Saffitz J.E. Glabe C.G. Kayed R. Maloyan A. Robbins J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10132-10136Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). This suggests that the reduction and/or prevention of toxic amyloid oligomer formation may represent a new therapeutic approach for the DRM disease as well as other amyloid-related diseases. To address this therapeutic approach for the DRM disease, it will be important to analyze the molecular mechanisms of amyloid oligomer formation by the CryAB R120G protein. Small HSP families, such as HSP22 (HSP B8 or H11kinase) and HSP25 (HSP B1), share their sequence similarity within the α-crystallin domain but exhibit different patterns of gene expression, transcriptional regulation, and subcellular localization (18Taylor R.P. Benjamin I.J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2005; 38: 433-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The chaperone-like activity of small HSPs, which are classified according to their ability to prevent protein aggregation and/or restore the biological activity of the substrates, is widely believed to be a protective mechanism for protein misfolding and denaturation triggered by noxious environmental stimuli, such as hyperthermia stress, heavy metals, ischemic injury, and some genetic diseases (1Muchowski P.J. Wacker J.L. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar, 18Taylor R.P. Benjamin I.J. J. Mol. Cell.

Commun. 1998; 244: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). At least 10 mammalian small HSPs have been identified in recent genome surveys of mice, rats, and humans, but their functions have remained poorly understood (18Taylor R.P. Benjamin I.J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2005; 38: 433-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In this study, we show the results of amyloid oligomer formation by self-polymerization of the CryAB R120G protein. Recombinant HSP25 or HSP22 proteins can interrupt oligomer formation by the CryAB R120G protein in both the recombinant protein and cardiomyocyte systems. Blockade of amyloid oligomer formation by either HSP22 or HSP25 recovered the ubiquitin proteosomal activity as well as the cellular toxicity. Blockade of oligomer formation by small HSPs, such as HSP22 and HSP25, may be a new therapeutic strategy for treating the DRM disease as well as other types of amyloid-based degenerative diseases.

The cells were normally transfected at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 10 for each virus except where indicated. To distinguish the transgenic products from the endogenous protein, a FLAG epitope was introduced at the N termini of both wild-type CryAB and CryAB R120G, and an HA epitope was introduced at the N termini of HSP22. The filter assay for the detection of the aggregates was performed as described (15Sanbe A. Osinska H. Saffitz J.E. Glabe C.G. Kayed R. Maloyan A. Robbins J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10132-10136Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The aggregate fraction on the membrane was detected with an anti-CryAB antibody. The activity of the ubiquitin-proteosome system (UPS) was estimated using a modified GFP construct, which was kindly provided by Dr. Kopito (Stanford University) (20Bence N.F. Bennett E.J. Kopito R.R. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 399: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The modified GFP construct was used to generate adenoviral constructs as described previously (15Sanbe A.

The cells were transfected by adenovirus containing the modified GFP at an m.o.i. of 1, and the GFP signal was traced as a parameter of UPS in the cardiomyocytes. Co-immunoprecipitation Assay Under Native Conditions—Coimmunoprecipitation was performed under a native condition as described previously (21Chavez Zobel A.T. Loranger A. Marceau N. Theriault J.R.

Cells were scraped into 0.5 ml of a TEPT buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The extracts were vortexed and centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were mixed with 1.5 volumes of a TEBS buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Triton X-100) and an anti-FLAG antibody conjugated to agarose beads (Sigma) followed by incubation at 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed three times with the TEBS buffer. The complexes were analyzed by Western blot after SDS-PAGE as described above (16Sanbe A. Gulick J. Hanks M.C. Liang Q. Osinska H. Robbins J. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemical analyses were performed as described (15Sanbe A. Osinska H. Saffitz J.E. Glabe C.G.

All cell culture media were from Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rabbit and Alexa 568-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies (Invitrogen), and TO-PRO-3 for nuclear staining was from Molecular Probes. The anti-CryAB antibody (SPA-223) and anti-HSP25 (SPA-801) were from StressGen; anti-FLAG was from Stratagene, and anti-HA (Y11) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The anti-cTnI antibody (MAB1691) was from Chemicon International, and the anti-HSP22 antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., and the anti-oligomer antibody was from BIOSOURCE. The cellular viability was measured 4 days after transfection using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Image J 1.36b was used to quantify the immunofluorescent intensity. The results from 30 to 50 cells were averaged for cohort comparison. The area stained with the oligomer antibody was defined, and the average pixel intensity of the cardiomyocyte was determined for comparison. Recombinant Protein—To produce a recombinant protein, His epitope-tagged wild-type CryAB-FLAG, CryAB R120G-FLAG, and HSP22HA were overexpressed in BL21 cells or Rosseta™ cells using the pET system (Novagen, Madison, WI) and purified with a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen, Santa Claret, CA). After dialysis or dilution with a Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.5, amyloid oligomer dot-blot analysis was performed. To quantify the amyloid oligomer level, each recombinant protein or protein mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h and blotted on a nitrocellulose membrane. After fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde in TBS for 3 min, blots were incubated with the anti-oligomer antibody (1:1000) (BIOSOURCE). Image J 1.36b was used to quantify the intensity of the amyloid oligomer. For Western blot analysis, protein samples were loaded onto a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed at 100 V for ∼3 h. The separated proteins were then transferred onto PVDF or nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C overnight. Native gel analysis was performed using the PAGEL® native gel system (Atto Corp., Tokyo, Japan). In some experiments, the recombinant protein was separated by the native gel and extracted from the gel into TBS. The extract from the native gel was used for dot-blot analysis as described above. Western blot was performed using a standard method described previously (16Sanbe A. Gulick J. Hanks M.C. Liang Q. Osinska H. Robbins J. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The cellular toxicity of the recombinant CryAB R120G protein in HEK293T cells was determined using an MTT assay. Recombinant proteins were added to give a final concentration of 0.2 or 0.4 mg/ml in a serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated for 4 h. After incubation, MTT assays were performed. Statistics—Data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using the unpaired Student's t test, and the analysis of variance was followed by a post hoc comparison with Fisher's PLSD using Statview version 5.0 software (Concepts, Inc., Berkeley, CA). Differences between groups were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. The Recombinant CryAB R120G Protein Is Immunoreactive against the Anti-oligomer Antibody—Recent studies support the toxic amyloid oligomer hypothesis for amyloid-based disease (12Glabe C.G. Neurobiol. Aging. 2006; 27: 570-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The amyloid oligomer structure, which is observed in several distinct amyloidogenic proteins, including CryAB R120G, Aβ, α-synuclein, and polyglutamine proteins, shares a common epitope that is recognized by an oligomer-specific antibody (6Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3437) Google Scholar, 15Sanbe A. Osinska H. Saffitz J.E. Glabe C.G. Kayed R. Maloyan A. Robbins J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10132-10136Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 17Sanbe A. Osinska H. Villa C. Gulick J. Klevitsky R. Glabe C.G. Kayed R. Robbins J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13592-13597Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To address the molecular mechanism(s) of amyloid oligomer formation by the CryAB R120G, a recombinant CryAB R120G protein was generated and purified using a standard Ni2+ column. The CryAB R120G protein was quite difficult to isolate in a soluble form because it easily forms an inclusion body in bacteria. Thus, we tried to isolate the CryAB R120G protein with Rossetta and Rossetta 2 (Novagen, Madison, WI) with incubation at 30 °C to increase the soluble protein level of CryAB R120G. SDS-PAGE showed a single band in both the wild-type CryAB-FLAG protein (>95% of total protein) and the CryAB R120G-FLAG protein (>95% of total protein) (Fig. 1A). The recombinant proteins were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h and blotted on a nitrocellulose membrane. The CryAB R120G-FLAG proteins showed strong immunoreactivity against the anti-oligomer antibody, and their reactivity was relatively stable in TBS solutions from pH 6.5 to 8.5 (Fig. 1, B and C). The CryAB R120G-FLAG proteins (0.4 mg/ml) showed cellular toxicity in HEK 293 cells, whereas the wild-type CryAB was neither cytotoxic nor immunoreactive against the anti-oligomer antibody (1.2 and 2.5 μg) (Fig. 1, B and D). This result suggests that the missense mutation in the CryAB protein can alter the entire protein conformation and/or the polymerized form to be reactive against the anti-oligomer antibody. Characterization of the CryAB-Amyloid Oligomer—The missense mutation of the CryAB protein led to toxic amyloid oligomer formation. To address the biochemical characteristics of the mutant CryAB-amyloid oligomer, we tried a native PAGE system. The CryAB R120G protein showed multiple bands with various molecular weights in the native gel (Fig. 2A, right panel indicated as arrows), whereas most of the wild-type CryAB protein formed a high molecular mass protein (Fig. 2A, left panel). Immunoreactivity against the oligomer antibody (Fig. 2B) as well as multiple bands with various molecular weights (Fig. 2A) was lost by treatment with either 5% β-mercaptoethanol or 0.1% SDS for 10 min, suggesting that immunoreactivity against the anti-oligomer antibody is dependent on the polymerized protein structure. This oligomer conformation was also partially blocked by metal ion chelating (data not shown). It is unlikely that β-mercaptoethanol affects a disulfide bond in the CryAB R120G proteins, because no cysteine residue is present in the CryAB protein (22Dubin R.A. Ally A.H. Chung S. Piatigorsky J. Genomics. 1990; 7: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 23Dubin R.A. Wawrousek E.F. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). To confirm the effect of β-mercaptoethanol on the amyloid oligomer, we examined the effect of 5 mm DTT and ethanol on CryAB R120G amyloid formation. Immunoreactivity against the anti-oligomer antibody was slightly increased by treatment with 10 or 20% ethanol but reduced by treatment with 5 mm DTT (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that a chemical compound containing a thiol residue can interfere with the conformation of the amyloid oligomer. To analyze the possibility of interaction between a sulfur-containing amino acid, i.e. methionine, at position 68 of the CryAB protein and chemical compound-containing thiol, such as β-mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol, we generated a recombinant protein in which the methionine residue at position 68 was changed to alanine (Fig. 2D). The immunoreactivity of the CryAB R120G protein containing an additional missense mutation (M68A) against the anti-oligomer antibody was the same as that of the CryAB R120G protein (Fig. 2D), whereas the CryAB M68A protein without an R120G mutation was scarcely immunoreactive against the anti-oligomer antibody. Thus, these results suggest that the effect of a thiol residue on the CryAB-amyloid oligomer is independent of the sulfur-containing amino acid. To further address the biochemical characteristics of the CryAB-amyloid oligomer, in particular the molecular size of the immunoreactive oligomer mass protein of the mutant CryAB, we performed Western blot analysis using a native gel without any reductant or detergent treatment. However, no detectable amyloid oligomer was observed as a result of Western blot analysis, although numerous CryAB proteins were present in the blot (data not shown). The reason that it was difficult to detect the amyloid oligomer by Western blot is unclear. We hypothesized that the protein conformation of the CryAB-amyloid is unstable during transfer to PVDF or nitrocellulose membranes. Thus, we tried to extract the protein from the native gel after the native PAGE. We divided the gel sample into 11 pieces by molecular weight and performed protein extraction from the gel (Fig. 2E). Of these extracts, a protein mixture with a molecular mass from 240 to 480 kDa showed the most potent immunoreactivity against the anti-oligomer antibody (Fig. 2, F and G). These results suggest that the polymerized CryAB R120G protein at 240-480 kDa, an ∼12-24-merized CryAB R120G protein, could potentially be a major source of the amyloid oligomer. HSP25 and HSP22 Can Interrupt CryAB R120G Oligomer Formation—The polymerized mutant CryAB protein can form an amyloid oligomer. As described above, the soluble amyloid oligomer may represent the primary toxic mechanism of amyloid pathogenesis (12Glabe C.G. Neurobiol. Aging. 2006; 27: 570-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). This suggests that the soluble oligomer amyloid is a potent therapeutic target for amyloid-related diseases, including DRM. Because the CryAB is present as a high molecular mass complex by self-polymerization and/or binding with other small HSP families, such as HSP25 (24Ito H. Hasegawa K. Inaguma Y. Kozawa O. Kato K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 332-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and HSP22 (18Taylor R.P. Benjamin I.J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2005; 38: 433-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), we analyzed the interaction between the CryAB-amyloid oligomers HSP25 and HSP22. In our previous report, we presented the effects of co-transfection of the wild-type CryAB with CryAB R120G in cardiomyocytes (17Sanbe A. Osinska H. Villa C. Gulick J. Klevitsky R. Glabe C.G. Kayed R. Robbins J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13592-13597Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The level of the amyloid oligomer was sustained by co-transfection of the wild-type CryAB with CryAB R120G in cardiomyocytes, whereas the aggresome disappeared (17Sanbe A. Osinska H. Villa C. Gulick J. Klevitsky R. Glabe C.G. Kayed R. Robbins J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13592-13597Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows that the mixture of the purified CryAB R120G protein with the wild-type CryAB protein can be immunoreactive against the anti-oligomer antibody and that its intensity was elevated in the mixed sample rather than the CryAB R120G protein (Fig. 3A). Thus, the wild-type CryAB can directly enhance amyloid oligomer formation. To analyze the effect of HSP25 and HSP22 on the CryAB-amyloid oligomer, recombinant HSP25 and HSP22 proteins were overexpressed and purified from the bacteria (Fig. 3B). SDS-PAGE showed a single band of each of the HSP25 and the HSP22 proteins (>95% of the total protein) (Fig. 3B). Either the HSP25 or the HSP22 protein can reduce the immunoreactivity against the anti-oligomer antibody in the mutant CryAB protein (Fig. 3, C and D). These results suggest that small HSPs, such as HSP25 and HSP22, can interfe"

For all three enzymes, the phosphorylation reaction was specific for ATP with apparent Km values between 14 and 67 μm. They did not utilize other NTPs nor were those able to compete for ATP in the reaction. An excess of ADP was able to inhibit ATP-dependent phosphorylation. Furthermore, all three kinases exhibited autophosphorylation. The protein kinases described here could represent subunits of a regulatory network involved in the cytosolic events of chloroplast protein import.

Furthermore, all three kinases exhibited autophosphorylation. The protein kinases described here could represent subunits of a regulatory network involved in the cytosolic events of chloroplast protein import. The biogenesis and differentiation of chloroplasts as well as their function require a vast number of nuclear-encoded proteins. Chloroplasts must therefore import about 3000 different proteins from the cytosol in a posttranslational process (1Abdallah F. Salamini F. Leister D. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 141-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Most but not all precursor proteins use a standard import pathway, which requires an N-terminal, cleavable presequence and involves the Toc complex (translocon at the outer envelope of chloroplasts) and the Tic complex (translocon at the inner envelope of chloroplasts) at the chloroplast outer and inner envelope membranes, respectively (2Vothknecht U.C. Soll J. Gene. 2005; 354: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Translocation of precursor proteins across the envelope membrane is a highly regulated process including GTP regulation by two prominent GTPases, Toc34 and Toc159, at the state of precursor recognition and translocation initiation (3Schleiff E. Jelic M. Soll J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4604-4609Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). At the level of the Tic translocon several subunits exhibit redox properties (4Hormann F. Kuchler M. Sveshnikov D. Oppermann U. Li Y. Soll J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34756-34762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 5Kuchler M. Decker S. Hormann F. Soll J. Heins L.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7342-7350Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and therefore the import route of certain precursor proteins might depend on the redox status of the organelle as conveyed to the translocon by the ratio of NADPH/NADP in the stroma. Recently, calcium regulation of the translocation process has been described (7Chigri F. Soll J. Vothknecht U.C. Plant J. 2005; 42: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Very little is known about the events that occur between translation of precursor proteins in the cytosol and their arrival at the organellar surface. Once emerged from the ribosome, they must maintain their import competence until they have been transported to their final compartment within the eukaryotic cell (8Attardi G. Schatz G. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 289-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar, 9Hartl F.U. Pfanner N. Nicholson D.W. Neupert W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 1-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Molecular chaperones of the Hsp70 and Hsp90 family have been shown to bind to precursor proteins to maintain an unfolded state compatible with translocation (10Ellis R.J. van der Vies S.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 321-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Waegemann K. Paulsen H. Soll J. FEBS Lett. 1990; 261: 89-92Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 12Rial D.V. Ottado J. Ceccarelli E.A. J.

This rather ubiquitous mechanism appears to be complemented, at least in plants, by a more specific precursor protein interaction with distinct soluble factors. It has been demonstrated that chloroplast precursor proteins can be phosphorylated by a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase, which is found in the cytosol of pea leaf mesophyll cells or in a translationally active wheat germ lysate (15May T. Soll J. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 53-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Waegemann K. Soll J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6545-6554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The protein kinase activity is only detected in plant extracts but not in mammalian systems like reticulocyte lysate (15May T. Soll J. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 53-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, mitochondrial precursor proteins were not accepted as substrates by the plant kinase, although they contained similar numbers of serine/threonine residues within their presequences. Phosphorylation of the chloroplast precursor proteins resulted in the binding of a cytosolic guidance complex, consisting of at least a 14-3-3 dimer and Hsp70 (15May T. Soll J. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 53-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although phosphorylation of precursor proteins and their association with the guidance complex did not affect targeting specificity; it clearly influenced the rate of translocation. A guidance complex-associated precursor of the stroma localized small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (pSSU) imported with a 4-5-fold higher rate compared with its free form (15May T. Soll J. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 53-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These differences in import kinetics are most likely because of the fact that the primary import receptor Toc34 has a higher affinity for the phosphorylated presequence than for its nonphosphorylated form (17Schleiff E. Soll J. Sveshnikova N. Tien R. Wright S. Dabney-Smith C. Subramanian C. Bruce B.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1934-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), thus discriminating against the latter. Although phosphorylation is not essential for targeting and translocation, it might be an important regulatory mechanism under certain developmental or environmental conditions that require the preferential import of one precursor protein over the other. The nature of the protein kinase that phosphorylates chloroplast precursor proteins, however, has so far remained elusive. We have therefore undertaken a biochemical approach to purify this kinase from the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana.A serine/threonine-specific protein kinase was enriched several thousand-fold and identified by mass spectrometry. The substrate requirements of the kinase suggest its specific action in chloroplast precursor phosphorylation. Further analysis revealed that the protein was part of a small family, which might regulate chloroplast import at a cytosolic stage. Materials—[32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. All other chemicals were p.a. grade or of the highest purity available. Purification of a Cytosolic Precursor-phosphorylating Protein Kinase—A cytosol-enriched protein fraction was isolated from 8-week-old leaves of A. thaliana (ecotype Columbia). Unless otherwise mentioned, all procedures were performed at 4 °C. Leaves were ground in a Warring blender in PS-A buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and the extract was filtered through four layers of gauze and two layers of Swiss cloth. The final leaf extract was obtained by two subsequent centrifugations for 15 min at 48,000 × g and 30 min at 150,000 × g, respectively.

The column was pre-equilibrated in the same buffer. Chromatography was performed at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Unbound protein was washed off the column with the equilibration buffer. Bound proteins were eluted by a linear gradient from 1 m NaCl to NaCl-free buffer over five-column volumes. The eluate was collected in 5-ml fractions and immediately assayed for kinase activity. Fractions with the highest enzyme activity were pooled and diluted 1:8 in MQ-A buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) to reach a final salt concentration under 50 mm NaCl. Anion exchange chromatography was performed on a Mono Q HR 5/5 (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in buffer MQ-A with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. After loading of the column, the unbound protein was washed off with buffer MQ-A, and bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 0.5 m NaCl in MQ-A buffer over two-column volumes. The eluate was collected in 0.5-ml fractions and immediately assayed for enzyme activity. The fractions with the highest enzyme activity were purified separately by size exclusion chromatography on Superose 6 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare) using SR6 buffer (50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. 0.25 ml of fractions were collected and immediately assayed for enzyme activity. The fraction with the highest activity was pooled from all runs and used for SDS-PAGE analysis. Identification of the Purified Precursor Protein Kinase—Proteins from the size exclusion chromatography purification were separated on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by staining with colloidal Coomassie. Protein bands, 50-65 kDa, were cut out of the gel and used for protein sequencing by mass spectrometry.

For the transient transformation seedlings of Nicotiana tabacum cv., petite Havana were germinated on B5-modified medium (19Gamborg O.L. Murashige T. Thorpe T.A. Vasil I.K. In Vitro. 1976; 12: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), and leaves of 3-4-week-old plants were used for protoplast isolation and transformation as described previously (20Koop H.U.

In all other cases, the full-length gene including presequence was utilized. For phosphorylation assays, all substrate proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (16Waegemann K. Soll J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6545-6554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). AT2G17700, AT4G35780, and AT4G38470 were cloned by PCR. AT2G17700 and AT4G38470 were amplified from cDNA isolated from Arabidopsis rosette leaves by the plant RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and SuperScript™ III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). AT4G35780 was amplified from the expressed sequence tag clone RAFL11-12-O20 (RIKEN BioResource Center). The PCR products were cloned directly into pCRHis2 TOPO (Invitrogen) in frame with a C-terminal His6 tag, and all constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Heterologous expression of AT2G17700, AT4G35780, and AT4G38470 was obtained in E. coli BL21(DE3) cell using 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2.5 h at 37 °C. For purification of the proteins, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 × g and resuspended in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5. The cells were ruptured by passage through a French pressure cell at 1200 psi. After removal of the cell debris by centrifugation at 12,000 × g, the supernatant was used for nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity purification (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. After the purification, the protein concentrations were determined and equalized for all preparations. The α-AT2G17700 antiserum was prepared in rabbit using purified heterologously expressed AT2G17700-His6. Precursor Protein Phosphorylation Assay—In vitro phosphorylation of proteins was performed as described in Ref. 16Waegemann K. Soll J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6545-6554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar. A standard phosphorylation (50 μl) was performed in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm MnCl2 with 2.5 μm ATP plus 2-5 μCi of [32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol). Each assay contained 1-3 μg of heterologously expressed and purified substrate protein, which were dissolved in 8 m urea prior to the experiment. The final urea concentration in the phosphorylation assay did not exceed 150 mm. The reaction was started by the addition of either protein from different column fractions or of the recombinant, nickel-nitrilotriacetic purified proteins. If not mentioned otherwise, the reaction was carried out for 10 min at 20 °C. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 12 μl of 4× SDS-gel buffer (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207192) Google Scholar). All phosphorylation assays were analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis and phosphorimaging on a Fuji film FLA-3000. Quantification of the radioactivity signals was performed using the software included in the AIDA package version 3.52.046. For the antibody depletion assay either α-AT2G17700 or preimmune serum was added to freshly prepared leaf extract in a 1:200 dilution and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C before being used in a standard phosphorylation assay. Purification of a Precursor Protein Kinase from Arabidopsis Leaves—A soluble protein extract was obtained from 8-week-old Arabidopsis leaves. After clearing the extract by ultracentrifugation, it was passed over a HIC matrix in the presence of 1 m NaCl. Bound proteins were eluted from the matrix by a decreasing linear NaCl gradient (Fig. 1A). Although most proteins did not bind to the HIC matrix under these conditions, the flow-through did not contain any precursor-specific protein kinase activity (data not shown). All precursor protein kinase activity was detected in the eluate at a salt concentration of ∼150 mm NaCl (Fig. 1A, upper panel). Active kinase fractions were detected by their capacity to phosphorylate pSSU (Fig. 1A, lower panel) and were pooled for further purification. The HIC resulted in a 50-fold enrichment of specific kinase activity compared with leaf extract (Table 1). The pooled enzyme fractions from the HIC were diluted 8-fold to lower the NaCl concentrations before they were passed over a Mono Q anion exchange matrix (Fig. 1B). Bound proteins were eluted by an increasing NaCl gradient. The precursor protein kinase eluted from the matrix at a NaCl concentration of ∼200 mm in a peak far removed from the bulk of proteins (Fig. 1B), resulting in a 460-fold enrichment of specific activity (Table 1). The active enzyme fractions were further fractionated by size exclusion chromatography on Superose 6 (Fig. 1C). The kinase eluted in the shoulder of the major peak, resulting in ∼3000-fold purification factor over the initial leave extract (Table 1).TABLE 1Purification of a chloroplast precursor phosphorylating kinase from leaf extracts of A. thaliana Enzyme activity was measured by the phosphorylation of pSSU.FractionTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityEnrichment factorYieldmgIntensityIntensity/mg%Leaf extract576.0089,183.00154.801.00100.00Phenyl-Sepharose9.3568,750.007353.3047.0077.09Mono Q1.0474,117.2071,266.50460.0083.11Superose 60.1044,242.10442,421.002858.0049.61 Open table in a new tab When we analyzed the most active kinase fraction by SDS-PAGE and silver staining, it still contained a number of different proteins in the range expected for the precursor protein kinase (Fig. 2A). Earlier studies had indicated that the kinase from pea as well as wheat germ has a molecular mass slightly above 50 kDa (15May T. Soll J. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 53-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Waegemann K. Soll J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6545-6554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Therefore polypeptides were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and the gel was cut into multiple pieces covering the molecular mass range from 50 to 65 kDa. Polypeptides present in each slice were identified by tandem mass spectrometry. This approach resulted in a peptide fingerprint with seven distinct peptides matching the deduced amino acid sequence of AT2G17700 from Arabidopsis, a protein that had been tentatively identified as a serine/threonine/tyrosine-specific kinase in the databases (Fig. 2B). The peptides were identified in the slice corresponding to about 60 kDa, which correlated well to the estimated size of the AT2G17700 gene product (Mr, 61,509.26). Arabidopsis Encodes a Small Precursor Protein Kinase Family—Blast searches against the complete Arabidopsis genome revealed the presence of two more genes, namely AT4G35780 and AT4G38470, that encoded proteins with a very high identity to AT2G17700 at the primary amino acid sequence level (Fig. 2C). Domain analysis clearly identified all three proteins as dual-specificity protein kinases (Sty kinases) containing the typical motifs found in this protein family (22Rudrabhatla P. Reddy M.M. Rajasekharan R. Plant Mol. Biol. 2006; 60: 293-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A number of other proteins possess similarity to AT2G117700 within the C-terminal kinase domain but only AT4G35780 and AT4G38470 showed high similarity also within the N-terminal part of the protein sequence. Furthermore, a bioinformatic analysis of protein kinases by Rajasekharan and co-workers (22Rudrabhatla P. Reddy M.M. Rajasekharan R. Plant Mol. Biol. 2006; 60: 293-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) placed AT4G35780 and AT4G38470 into a separate subfamily together with AT2G17700. Thus it appears that these three genes represent a small gene family within Arabidopsis. Even though the overall identity between these three proteins is very high, all except one of the peptides identified by mass spectrometry matched exclusively to AT2G17700. Only a single peptide could be matched to AT4G38470 as well as AT2G17700. All Three Precursor Protein Kinases Have Similar Enzymatic Properties for pSSU Phosphorylation— To perform a biochemical characterization of AT2G17700 and a comparison of its properties with AT4G35780 and AT4G38470, we expressed all three proteins heterologously in E. coli. The corresponding cDNA was obtained by PCR either from mRNA or from an expressed sequence tag clone (AT4G35780). The genes were cloned into the expression vector pDest17 allowing expression via a T7 promotor as well as adding a C-terminal His tag for purification. For all three constructs, soluble expression of the protein was obtained. They were subsequently purified to apparent homogeneity by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (supplemental Fig. 1 and Fig. 4A). The purified enzymes retained their activity for several days at 4 °C but were inactivated by freezing and thawing. In general, nonspecific model substrates like casein, phosvitin, histone, or myeline basic protein are used to characterize the biochemical properties of protein kinases (23Edelman A.M. Blumenthal D.K. Krebs E.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 567-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). All three heterologously expressed kinases could utilize these substrates as do other serine/threonine kinases from plants or mammalian systems (data not shown). Nevertheless, to study the enzymatic properties in more detail we used pSSU as a substrate. Equal amounts of freshly purified enzymes were used in each assay. All three proteins phosphorylated pSSU in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3A), while at the same time displaying autophosphorylation (data not shown and compare Fig. 5). Phosphorylation of pSSU required ATP, which could not be substituted for by GTP as a phosphate donor. Phosphorylation was furthermore dependent on ATP concentration, and the S0.5 for ATP was determined to be 14 μm for AT4G35780 and 21.6 μm for AT2G17700 (Fig. 3B). These values correspond well with Km values measured for other serine/threonine protein kinases (24Zhang X. Zhang S. Yamane H. Wahl R. Ali A. Lofgren J.A. Kendall R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13949-13956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The third kinase, AT4G38470, showed a much lower affinity for ATP, namely, a S0.5 of 67 μm. The physiological basis for this difference is currently unknown. The ATP-dependent phosphorylation of pSSU could be inhibited by ADP. Already at a one-to-one ratio of ADP to ATP, a slight inhibition could be observed but 200-fold excess was necessary to obtain complete inhibition. In contrast, no effect on pSSU phosphorylation could be observed with either GTP, CTP, or UTP at a 50-fold excess, and even a 200-fold excess resulted only in minor inhibition (Fig. 3C).FIGURE 5Substrate requirement of the three precursor protein kinases compared with Arabidopsis leaf extract. Panel 1 of A and B show the purity of substrate proteins as analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining and their phosphorylation by leaf extract (panel 2) as well as the heterologously expressed and purified protein kinases (panels 3-5). The set of proteins in A includes a number of different chloroplast precursor proteins and a mitochondrial-targeted control protein. B includes a number of chloroplast precursor proteins with mutations in their phosphorylation sites as well as mSSU and iOE23 without their chloroplast targeting presequences. The protein substrate used in each lane is indicated at the bottom of panel 5. The position of the autophosphorylated kinases is marked by arrows. The positions of the substrate proteins are indicated by asterisks. The following substrates were used: pSSU, pLHCP2, pCAO, pNDPK2, pAPC1, pCPHSP70B, pF1β, mSSU, pHCF136, pOE23 (precursor of the oxygen evolving protein of 23 kDA), iOE23 (OE23 without chloroplast targeting peptide but with thylakoid targeting peptide).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) α-AT2G17700 Antiserum Inhibits Precursor Phosphorylation in Leaf Extracts—To test whether the kinase purified from Arabidopsis leaves was indeed responsible for the phosphorylation of precursor proteins in vivo, we raised an antiserum against heterologously expressed AT2G17700. The antibody predominantly recognized its antigen, AT2G17700, as shown by immunoblot analysis using equal amounts of heterologously expressed AT2G17700, AT4G35780, and AT4G38470 protein (Fig. 4A). The antiserum did not recognize an unrelated serine/threonine kinase (AT2G43790) and furthermore showed only one immunoreactive band of the right size when tested against complete leaf extracts of Arabidopsis (Fig. 4A). When the antiserum was used in immunoblot analysis of different protein fractions, the protein was found to be soluble and present in the cytosol. The cytosolic localization of AT2G17700 was confirmed by transient expression of an AT2G17700-GFP fusion protein in tobacco protoplasts (Fig. 4C). The antiserum was then used to deplete the precursor protein kinase activity of a soluble leaf extract from Arabidopsis (Fig. 4D). Immunodepletion resulted in a more than 50% decrease of phosphorylation activity. Failure to completely inhibit pSSU phosphorylation was most likely because of the presence of the other two kinases in the leaf extract, which were not well detected by the antiserum against AT2G17700. Therefore, some enzyme activity remained in the immunodepleted extract. These results strongly support the idea that AT2G17700 indeed is a cytosol-localized precursor protein kinase of Arabidopsis. Substrate Requirements of the Heterologously Expressed Precursor Protein Kinases—To further establish the substrate specificity of the three kinases we heterologously expressed and purified several chloroplast-destined precursor proteins, their mature forms without the presequence or mutant proteins, which contained specific amino acid exchanges at the precursor phosphorylation site (Fig. 5, A and B, top panels). A mitochondrial precursor protein (pF1β) was included into the set as a further control for phosphorylation specificity. We then tested the selectivity of the soluble leaf extract in comparison to all three heterologously expressed kinases (Fig. 5, A and B, panels 2-5). Because the leaf extract was not purified further, a number of radioactive protein bands were observed that were independent from the substrate protein and occurred also in assays without the substrate (data not shown). In case of the heterologously expressed kinases, a radioactive protein band at around 65 kDa is because of autophosphorylation of the proteins. The position of the substrate used in each assay is thus marked by an asterisk. The leaf extract phosphorylated the transit sequence of several chloroplast precursor proteins such as pSSU, pAPC1, pHCF136, pOE23, pLHCP2, pNDPK2, and pCPHSP70 but neither the chloroplast precursor protein pCAO nor the mitochondrial precursor protein pF1β (Fig. 5, A (all lanes) and B (lanes 1, 4, and 6)). Further analysis showed that phosphorylation was confined to distinct phosphorylation sites within the transit peptide (Fig. 5B, lanes 2, 3, 5, 7, and 8). Neither the mature form of pSSU, i.e. mSSU nor iOE23, which contained only the thylakoid transfer signal but no longer the chloroplast targeting signal, were phosphorylated by the leaf extract. Phosphorylation occurs at specific residues within the transit peptide, as established before for pSSU-M31/34-S/A and pOE23-M22-S/A (16Waegemann K. Soll J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6545-6554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In addition, we determined the phosphorylation site in pHCF136. Exchange of serine residues at positions 52 and 54 by threonine drastically reduced (>90%) the extent of phosphorylation by leaf extract (Fig. 5A, panel 2). These results clearly demonstrate the substrate requirements of the crude leaf extract system. In case of the heterologously expressed kinases, all three isoforms exhibited autophosphorylation capacity in the presence (Fig. 5, A and B, panels 3-5, see arrows) or absence of exogenous protein substrates (data not shown). With regard to the substrates tested, AT2G17700 showed a specificity similar to the leaf extract with the only exception that pOE23 was not phosphorylated by the purified enzyme (Fig. 4, compare panel 2 with panel 3). Because of the nature of the exchange (threonine for serine) and because pHCF136 is such a good substrate for AT2G17700, some phosphorylation (<10%) occurred also in the pHCF136-M52/54-S/T mutant in the purified in vitro system (Fig. 5B). AT4G35780 and AT4G35780 were comparable in their specificity to AT2G17700 except that pOE23 was phosphorylated (Fig. 5, compare panels 3-5) by both proteins. However, because iOE23 and pOE23-M22-S/A also became phosphorylated by these enzymes, this phosphorylation did not appear to be specific for the transit peptide but occurred instead somewhere within the mature part. In case of pSSU or pHCF136, the phosphorylation was specific to the precursor protein with no phosphorylation of the mature form or the phosphorylation site mutants. It cannot be excluded that AT4G38470 and AT4G35780 might require a specificity factor for pOE23, which is present in the leaf extract but absent from the reconstituted in vitro system consisting solely of the kinase and its substrate. Although AT4G38470 behaved very much like AT4G35780 in its selectivity properties, the overall yield of phosphorylation was significantly lower. This is most likely because of the fact that all assays were conducted at an ATP concentration of 2.5 μm, which was close to the S0.5 determined for AT2G17700 and AT4G35780 but much below the one for AT4G38470. Taken together, our data clearly demonstrate that all three members of this kinase family can phosphorylate chloroplast precursor proteins. Further factors might be involved in the regulation of the kinase activity and its selectivity in vivo. Chloroplast differentiation in young, rapidly expanding leaves requires the massive influx of polypeptides to build up the thylakoid membrane and establish the full photosynthetic and CO2 fixation capacity of the organelle (1Abdallah F. Salamini F. Leister D. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 141-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Similarly, during normal day/night cycles the maintenance of the photosynthetic redox chemistry, which is highly prone to polypeptide damage and turnover, requires a constant but strictly regulated replenishment of the organelle with nuclear-encoded proteins (25Dahlin C. Cline K. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 1131-1140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Bauer J. Hiltbrunner A. Kessler F. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 420-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 27Jarvis P. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: R314-R316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Therefore, a tight regulatory network exists between chloroplasts and the nucleus to coordinate gene expression, most likely via metabolite and redox signaling (28Baier M. Dietz K.J. J. Exp. Bot. 2005; 56: 1449-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 29John C.G. James A.S. Jun-Hui W. Cheryl A.J. Daniel M. Philos. Trans. R Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2003; 358: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 30Lopez-Juez E. Pyke K.A. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2005; 49: 557-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Additionally, post-transcriptional processes influence mRNA processing, stability, and hence translation efficiency. It therefore appears highly unlikely that a regulatory “no man's land” exists between completion of translation and recognition of the protein at the organellar surface. Controlled phosphorylation of chloroplast-destined precursor proteins might be such a mechanism, working at the post-translational level. Although phosphorylation is essential neither for chloroplast targeting nor for conveying organelle (sorting) specificity within the cell (16Waegemann K. Soll J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6545-6554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 31Nakrieko K.A. Mould R.M. Smith A.G. FEBS J. 2004; 271: 509-516Google Scholar), it increases the rates of chloroplast import by several folds (15May T. Soll J. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 53-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore phosphorylated precursor proteins are imported preferentially (have the right of way) over nonphosphorylated precursor proteins. This differential import kinetics are established through the import receptor Toc34, which binds phosphorylated precursor proteins with much higher affinity than nonphosphorylated precursor proteins (17Schleiff E. Soll J. Sveshnikova N. Tien R. Wright S. Dabney-Smith C. Subramanian C. Bruce B.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1934-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Using a biochemical approach we were able to identify AT2G17700 as a precursor protein phosphorylating kinase of Arabidopsis. This protein was the only potential serine/threonine kinase detected in a fraction highly enriched for pSSU phosphorylation activity obtained from a cytosol-enriched leaf extract. Its deduced amino acid sequence contains all signature sequences of protein kinases, and the protein has been tentatively classified by a bioinformatical approach as one of about 60 dual Sty kinases and is termed Sty8 (22Rudrabhatla P. Reddy M.M. Rajasekharan R. Plant Mol. Biol. 2006; 60: 293-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Dual-specificity kinases contain domains characteristic for both serine/threonine as well as tyrosine kinases and are believed to posses both activities. Our characterization of the heterologously expressed and purified AT2G17700 shows that the protein is indeed a bona fide serine/threonine kinase, which phosphorylates chloroplast precursor proteins within their transit sequence. Because no phosphorylation on tyrosine residues has been detected so far for precursor proteins, our results suggest that the tyrosine protein kinase activity does not play an important role in this case. The genome of Arabidopsis contains two other protein kinases, AT4G35780 and AT4G38470, with high sequence similarity to AT2G17700. These three are the only Arabidopsis proteins sharing significant amino acid homology over the whole of their sequence. Because all the heterologously expressed proteins have serine/threonine kinase activities as well as similar substrate requirements as AT2G17700, we conclude that the three proteins represent a small family of chloroplast precursor phosphorylating kinases. This is supported by the fact that a phylogenetic analysis placed these three proteins in a small subfamily of Sty kinases. According to array data of the AtGenExpress consortium, all three genes were ubiquitously expressed in all the tissues. Although it is most likely from the peptides obtained by mass spectrometry that we only detected AT2G17700 in our biochemical purification, the fact that the α-AT2G17700 antiserum could not completely deplete pSSU phosphorylation in leaf extracts indicates that all three proteins were present in the cytosol of mesophyll cells at the same time. Because building and refurbishing an organelle with proteins is an extremely complex process, which requires feedback and “feed forward” control circuits at all levels, having three precursor protein kinases present simultaneously would allow for differential regulation of the import process. Organellar needs for selective protein replacement, changes in metabolic conditions, or environmental adaptation and differentiation are signaled to the cytosol where they could influence either directly or indirectly the precursor protein kinase activity and specificity. Precursor protein phosphorylation could then serve as a process to adapt and fine-tune protein import rates to the requirement of the organelles. Specificity as well as differential regulation could be aided by the cytosolic factors that still have to be determined. Certain differences in the phosphorylation properties between the leaf extract and the purified kinases suggest the existence of such factors. The identification of these three precursor protein kinases will allow us to identify and characterize further components of this regulatory network. Download .pdf (.08 MB) Help with pdf files"

However, little is known about the precise roles of cathepsin E in this system. Here we report that cathepsin E deficiency (CatE-/-) leads to a novel form of lysosome storage disorder in macrophages, exhibiting the accumulation of the two major lysosomal membrane sialoglycoproteins LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 and the elevation of lysosomal pH. These striking features were also found in wild-type macrophages treated with pepstatin A and Ascaris inhibitor. Whereas there were no obvious differences in their expression, biosynthesis, and trafficking between wild-type and CatE-/- macrophages, the degradation rates of these two membrane proteins were apparently decreased as a result of cathepsin E deficiency. Because there was no difference in the vacuolar-type H+-ATPase activity in both cell types, the elevated lysosomal pH in CatE-/- macrophages is most likely due to the accumulation of these lysosomal membrane glycoproteins highly modified with acidic monosaccharides, thereby leading to the disruption of non-proton factors controlling lysosomal pH. Furthermore, the selective degradation of LAMP-1 and LAMP-2, as well as LIMP-2, was also observed by treatment of the lysosomal membrane fraction isolated from wild-type macrophages with purified cathepsin E at pH 5.

Tumor Biol. 2006; 27: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), which is significantly associated with survival. Furthermore, we recently reported that a deficiency of cathepsin E in mice caused atopic dermatitis, a pruritic inflammatory skin disease (14Tsukuba T. Okamoto K. Okamoto Y. Yanagawa M. Kohmura K. Yasuda Y. Uchi H. Nakahara T. Furue M. Nakayama K. Kadowaki T. Yamamoto K. Nakayama K.I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 134: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we have suggested that cathepsin E plays an important role in the maintenance of homeostasis by participating in host defense mechanisms. However, because physiological substrates for cathepsin E have not yet been identified, the precise function of this enzyme remains elusive. If cathepsin E plays a critical role in the catabolism of one or several of substrate proteins, its deficiency may cause an accumulation of the substrate proteins or their metabolites in lysosomal compartments, thereby manifesting a certain phenotype of lysosomal storage disorders.The endolysosome system represents the final destination for many endocytic, autophagic, and secretory molecules targeted for destruction or recycling (15Gruenberg J. Stenmark H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). This system therefore contributes to the maintenance of homeostasis via numerous functions, including the supply of nutrients, the turnover of cellular proteins, the elimination of defective or unfavorable molecules, and the down-regulation of surface receptors (16Kornfeld S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar, 17Mullins C. Bonifacino J.S. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). These organelles are extremely unique in containing a variety of acidic hydrolases able to degrade or modify the transported macromolecules. Accordingly, the limiting membranes of the endolysosomal organelles most likely not only protect other cellular constituents against the attack by these potent hydrolases but also serve to maintain the acidification of the endolysosomal lumen (16Kornfeld S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar, 18Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21327-21330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the endolysosomal membrane contains several unique integral proteins such as LAMP-1, 3The abbreviations used are: LAMP, lysosome-associated membrane protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CatE-/-, cathepsin E-deficient; LIMP, lysosomal integral membrane protein; LAP, lysosomal acid phosphatase; MPR300, cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor; V-ATPase, the vacuolar-type H+-ATPase; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. 3The abbreviations used are: LAMP, lysosome-associated membrane protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CatE-/-, cathepsin E-deficient; LIMP, lysosomal integral membrane protein; LAP, lysosomal acid phosphatase; MPR300, cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor; V-ATPase, the vacuolar-type H+-ATPase; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. LAMP-2, and LIMP-2/LGP85, whose luminal domains are heavily N-glycosylated with complex poly-N-acetyllactosamines (19Peters C. Von Figura K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 20Eskelinen E.L. Tanaka Y. Saftig P. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 137-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Of further importance, these membrane proteins represent more than 50% of the total membrane proteins of endolysosomes (18Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21327-21330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Eskelinen E.L. Tanaka Y. Saftig P. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 137-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) and their glycosylation constitutes about 60% (LAMP-1 and LAMP-2) and 20% (LIMP-2/LGP85) of the total mass of the respective molecules (21Hunziker W. Geuze H.J. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), and for the most part are present on the intraluminal side of endosomes and lysosomes, suggesting their significance in protecting the membrane from degradation by lysosomal hydrolases. To better understand the role of cathepsin E in the endolysosomal system, therefore, it was of particular importance for us to investigate the effect of cathepsin E deficiency on expression, trafficking, localization, and turnover of these membrane proteins as well as lysosomal soluble enzymes. We herein report that cathepsin E deficiency leads to a novel form of lysosome storage disorder in macrophages, exhibiting the accumulation of major lysosomal membrane sialoglycoproteins, including LAMP-1, LAMP-2, and LIMP-2, and the elevation of lysosomal pH. We also found that the trafficking of soluble lysosomal proteins to lysosomes was partially impaired in CatE-/- macrophages. To address the mechanism underlying these consequences, we determined the synthesis, expression, and turnover of the lysosomal membrane proteins in CatE-/- macrophages in comparison to those of the wild-type cells. In addition, to determine whether cathepsin E is directly involved in the degradation of these lysosomal membrane proteins, the effects of its inhibitors on the cellular levels of lysosomal membrane proteins and the lysosomal pH in wild-type macrophages. Our results indicate that cathepsin E is essential for degradation of these lysosomal membrane proteins, and that its deficiency is implicated in the development of a new form of lysosomal storage disorder associated with the elevation of lysosomal pH.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Pepstatin A was purchased from Peptide Institute Inc.

Three and one-half days later, peritoneal exudate cells were isolated from the peritoneal cavity by washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cells were incubated with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. After incubation for 2 h, non-adherent cells were removed by washing with Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS three times. Peritoneal macrophages isolated as adherent MAC-2-positive cells were obtained at a purity of greater than 95% by this procedure.Preparation of Media and Cell Lysates—The culture media of macrophages were collected after 24 h and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant fraction was concentrated at 10-fold using Centriprep-30 and Microcon-30 concentrators (Millipore Co. Bedford, MA). For the preparation of the cell lysates, the cells were washed twice with PBS, removed from the plates with a rubber scraper, and centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min. The precipitated cells were resuspended in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and then subjected to sonication for 1 min at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant fraction is referred to as the cell lysate. For SDS-PAGE or immunoblot analyses, the supernatant was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid at a final concentration of 5% and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min after incubation on ice for 15 min. After washing with ice-cold acetone and evaporating with air, the pellets were suspended in the buffer for SDS-PAGE.

(23Ohsumi Y. Ishikawa T. Kato K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 93: 547-556PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, after suspension in a solution containing 0.25 m sucrose and 0.2 m KCl, wild-type macrophages were homogenized with Potter-Elvehjem type homogenizer. After centrifugation at 650 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 20 min. The pellet was suspended with a dilute solution containing 25 mm sucrose and 20 mm KCl to be lysed, and then further centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was referred to as the crude lysosome fraction. After addition of CaCl2 (a final concentration of 10 mm), this fraction was further centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 10 min, and then the supernatant was centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 10 min. Then, the supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min and subsequently at 50,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 30 min, the resultant supernatant was referred to as the final lysosomal membrane fraction, which were almost free from mitochondria, peroxisomes, and endoplasmic reticulum (23Ohsumi Y. Ishikawa T. Kato K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 93: 547-556PubMed Google Scholar).Degradation of Lysosomal Membrane Proteins by Purified Cathepsin E—The lysosomal membrane fractionation (50 μg) was incubated with purified cathepsin E (0–2 μg) (24Yamamoto K. Katsuda N. Kato K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 92: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) at 25 °C for 12 h. The reaction was stopped by addition of 2.0 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 9.0) to give a final concentration of 0.2 m. Then, the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses.Enzyme Assays—Cathepsins B and L were assayed as described previously (22Nakanishi H. Tominaga K. Amano T. Hirotsu I. Inoue T. Yamamoto K. Exp. Neurol. 1994; 126: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). β-Glucronidase was assayed by the method of Robins et al. (25Robins E. Hirsch H.E. Emmons S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 4246-4252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cathepsin D activity was determined using MOCAc-Gly-Lys-Pro-Ile-Phe-Phe-Arg-Leu-Lys(Dnp)-d-Arg-NH2 (Peptide Institute, Inc., Osaka, Japan) as a substrate according to the method described previously (26Yasuda Y. Kageyama T. Akamine A. Shibata M. Kominami E. Uchiyama Y. Yamamoto K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 1137-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). β-Hexosaminidase and α-mannnosidase were assayed with 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-glucopyranoside and 4-methylumbelliferyl-α-d-mannopyranoside as synthetic substrates essentially according to the method of Robins et al. (25Robins E. Hirsch H.E. Emmons S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 4246-4252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Pulse-Chase Analysis—Pulse-chase experiments were performed as described previously (27Tsukuba T. Ikeda S. Okamoto K. Yasuda Y. Sakai E. Kadowaki T. Sakai H. Yamamoto K. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were preincubated for 1 h at 37°C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without methionine supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and then pulse-labeled for 30 or 60 min with [35S]methionine (100 μCi/ml) and chased in fresh RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (1.5 ml/plate). At the times indicated, the cells were separated from the medium, washed twice with PBS, lysed in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.02% sodium azide, and a proteinase inhibitor mixture (1 mg/ml of each inhibitor: antipain, chymostatin, leupeptin, pepstatin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and then subsequently sonicated for 1 min.Immunoprecipitation—The cell lysates and media were mixed with 40 μl of Pansorbin for 1 h at 4 °C to prevent non-specific binding to IgG-protein A beads, and then centrifuged at 6,500 × g for 30 min. For immunoprecipitation of LAMP-1 and LAMP-2, the supernatant fractions were incubated with 10 μl of each monoclonal antibody at 37 °C for 10 min, and then stored at 4 °C for 16 h. The mixtures were further incubated with 20 μg of goat anti-rat antibody at 37 °C for 10 min and stored at 4 °C for 3 h. For the immunoprecipitation of cathepsins B and D, the supernatant fractions were incubated with 10 μl of each polyclonal antibodies at 37 °C for 10 min, and then stored at 4 °C for 16 h. Immune complexes were adsorbed onto protein A-Sepharose beads (50% gel suspension) at 4 °C for 3 h with gentle agitation, followed by three washes with 0.1% SDS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 200 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The immunoprecipitates were washed 3 more times with the same buffer containing 1 m NaCl and 0.1% sodium lauryl sarcosinate and twice with 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0). The beads were boiled for 5 min at 100 °C with 50 μl of 0.1% SDS, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5% sucrose, 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) with 2-mercaptoethanol.Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblot Analysis—SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (27Tsukuba T. Ikeda S. Okamoto K. Yasuda Y. Sakai E. Kadowaki T. Sakai H. Yamamoto K. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The quantification of the immunoreactive bands was analyzed by LAS 1000 and Image Gauge software (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).Two-dimensional Electrophoresis and Proteomic Analyses— The culture supernatant was applied to immobilized pH gradient gel strips (Amersham Biosciences) and then subjected to isoelectric focusing using a Multiphor II (Amersham Biosciences). After isoelectric focusing, the strips were equilibrated for 15 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), containing 6 m urea, 30% glycerol, 1% SDS, and 64 mm dithiothreitol and subsequently immersed for 15 min in the same buffer containing 135 mm iodoacetamide instead of dithiothreitol. The strips were then transferred onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After eletrophoresis, the gels were silver-stained for proteins. Peptide mass mapping was performed by recording the peptide mass fingerprints of typical in-gel digests of the corresponding gel bands using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight MS (AXIMA-CFR plus, Shimadzu, Tsukuba, Japan) and the subsequent use of the mascot search engine (Matrix Science, Tokyo, Japan).Measurement of Endolysosomal pH—The endolysosomal pH in macrophages was determined in situ by the method of Chen et al. (28Chen Q.R. Zhang L. Luther P.W. Mixson A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1338-13453Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, after plating on a 96-well plate, macrophages were incubated with 500 μg/ml of an acidotropic probe, Lysosensor yellow/blue dextran (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 24 h and then washed with PBS. The fluorescence from the acidic compartments in the labeled cells was quantified with a fluorescence microplate reader at an emission wavelength of 430/535 nm with excitation at 340 nm (Wallac 1420 ARVOsx, PerkinElmer Inc., Wellesley, MA). To confirm the validity of a pH titration curve, Chinese hamster ovary cells were also incubated with Lysosensor yellow/blue dextran for 24 h and then treated with 10 μm monensin and 0.5 μm bafilomycin A1. These cells were treated for 20 min with the equilibration buffers consisting of 5 mm NaCl, 115 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, and 25 mm MES varied between pH 4.5 and 7.0. After incubation, the fluorescence intensity was determined.Measurement of V-ATPase Activity by Immunoprecipitation— Both wild-type and CatE-/- macrophages (1 × 107 cells) were lysed with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and the total ATPase activity was then measured by the method of Ramirez-Montealegre and Pearce (29Ramirez-Montealegre D. Pearce D.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 3759-3773Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The cell lysates (50 μg) were mixed with 0–20 μl of anti-V-ATPase A subunit antibody, which was raised using a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acid sequence 366AEMPADSGYPAYLGARS381 of bovine V-ATPase and exhibited cross-reaction with V-ATPase of most organisms such as animals, bacteria, and plant, but not with other ATPases such P-ATPase and F-ATPase, and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, and stored at 4 °C for 3 h. The immune complexes were adsorbed onto 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (50% gel suspension) at 4 °C for 3 h with gentle agitation. After centrifugation to remove immunoprecipitates, ATPase activity remaining in the supernatant was remeasured. The amount of V-ATPase could be calculated from the amount of ATPase activity remaining in the supernatant. The enzyme unit, U, was defined as micromole of Pi liberated per min per ml.mRNA Extraction and Quantitative Real-time PCR—The total mRNA of the cells was prepared using a RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Complementary DNA was synthesized using 1 μg of total RNA incubated with random hexamers, followed by a 50-μl reverse transcription reaction with 6.25 units of Multiscribe reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems) at 25 °C for 10 min for binding, at 48 °C for 30 min for reverse transcription, and at 95 °C for 5 min for inactivation, respectively. The cDNA products were amplified using the following oligonucleotide primers for mouse LAMP-1, LAMP-2, LIMP-2, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNAs; LAMP-1, 5′ primer = CAAGGCAGACATCAACAAAG and 3′ primer = TAGGGVATCAGGAACACTCA; LAMP-2, 5′ primer = GGTGCTGGTCTTTCAGGCTTGATT and 3′ primer = ACCACCCAATCTAAGAGCAGGACT; LIMP-2, 5′ primer = TGTTGAAACGGGAGACATCA and 3′ primer = TGGTGACAACCAAAGTCGTG; GAPDH, 5′ primer = ACTCCCACTCTTCCACCTTC and 3′ primer = TCTTGCTCAGTGTCCTTGC. The housekeeping gene GAPDH was also amplified in parallel as a reference for the quantification of LAMP-1, LAMP-2, and LIMP-2 transcripts. The cDNA samples (1 μl) were added to 12.5 μl of 2× SYBR Green PCR Master Mix, 1 μl of 10 μm for the 5′- and 3′-primers to give a total volume of 25μl. All reactions were performed in duplicate in the ABI PRISM 7000 Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems). The thermal cycling was performed at 50 °C for 2 min, at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s plus at 56 °C for 1 min. Realtime PCR data were analyzed for at least three different experiments.Immunofluorescence Microscopy— The cells were grown on glass coverslips and briefly washed with PBS and then fixed with 4.0% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. The fixed cells were washed and permeabilized with 50 mm NH4Cl and 0.3% Tween 20 in PBS. The cells were incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin plus 1% normal goat serum for 3 h, and subsequently incubated with the primary antibodies overnight at 4.0 °C followed by fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies, and then inspected by microscopy using a laser-scanning confocal imaging system (Leica TCS, Leica-Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany).Statistical Analysis—Quantitative data are presented as mean ± S.D. The statistical significance of differences between mean values was assessed by Student's t test. p values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant.RESULTSEffect of Cathepsin E Deficiency on the Cellular Levels of Major Lysosomal Membrane Glycoproteins—To determine the effect of cathepsin E deficiency on intracellular levels of lysosomal membrane proteins, we performed SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis for the cell lysates of wild-type and CatE-/- macrophages. Two major lysosomal membrane sialoglycoproteins, LAMP-1 and LAMP-2, were highly increased in CatE-/- macrophages compared with the wild-type cells (Fig. 1). Another major lysosomal membrane sialoglycoprotein LIMP-2 was also increased, but not significantly, in CatE-/- macrophages. In contrast, cellular levels of other endolysosomal membrane glycoproteins, including lysosomal acid phosphatase (LAP), which is known to be synthesized and transported to lysosomes as an integral type I membrane protein and slowly released its luminal domain into the lysosomal lumen by proteolytic processing (19Peters C. Von Figura K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), V-ATPase A-subunit, which is an integral endolysosomal membrane protein essential for V-ATPase activity (30Forgac M. J. Biol.

Funct. 2003; 28: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (MPR300), which is known as a type I integral membrane protein found mainly in the trans-Golgi network and plays a critical role in the intracellular trafficking of soluble lysosomal hydrolases (32Ghosh P. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 202-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar), were not different between wild-type and CatE-/- macrophages.Elevation of Lysosomal pH in CatE-/- Macrophages—The luminal acidic pH is essential for the normal function of intracellular acidic organelles including endosomes and lysosomes (16Kornfeld S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence suggests that the accumulation of undegraded metabolites in lysosomal compartments induces an elevated lysosomal pH, thereby impairing the functions of the endolysosomal system (33Futerman A.H. van Meer G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 554-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed the lysosomal pH in CatE-/- macrophages using an acidotropic fluorescent probe, namely, Lysosensor yellow/blue dextran. The lysosomal pH of the wild-type cells was estimated to be 5.3 ± 0.4, which closely agreed with the findings previously reported in macrophages (34Lukacs G.L. Rotstein O.D. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24540-24548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas that of CatE-/- m"

Coagulation of plasma supplemented with a matching amount of PF4 results in a translucent jelly-like clot. Saturating amounts of PF4 reduce the porosity of the fibrin network 4.4-fold and decrease the values of the elastic and loss moduli by 31- and 59-fold, respectively. PF4 alters neither the cleavage of fibrinogen by thrombin nor the cross-linking of protofibrils by activated factor XIII but binds to fibrin and dramatically transforms the structure of the ensuing network. Scanning electron microscopy showed that PF4 gives rise to a previously unreported pattern of polymerization where fibrin assembles to form a sealed network. The subunits constituting PF4 form a tetrahedron having at its corners a RPRH motif that mimics (in reverse orientation) the Gly-His-Arg-Pro-amide peptides that co-crystallize with fibrin. Molecular modeling showed that PF4 could be docked to fibrin with remarkable complementarities and absence of steric clashes, allowing the assembly of irregular polymers. Consistent with this hypothesis, as little as 50 μm the QVRPRHIT peptide derived from PF4 affects the polymerization of fibrin.

In addition to catalyzing the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, thrombin activates the G protein-coupled protease-activated receptor 1, triggering platelet adhesion and activation (1Mann K.G.

The physiologic function of PF4 is not fully understood even if one of the first clues to the existence of endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors came with the observation that it inhibits endothelial cell proliferation (5Maione T.E. Gray G.S. Petro J. Hunt A.J. Donner A.L. Bauer S.I. Carson H.F. Sharpe R.J. Science. 1990; 247: 77-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). PF4 is otherwise mainly known for binding polysulfated glycosaminoglycans such as heparin and has been extensively studied for its role in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (6Chong B.H. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2003; 1: 1471-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Generally speaking, PF4 binds to glycosaminoglycans, modulating their activity. Both pro-coagulant and anti-coagulant properties for PF4 have been reported. PF4 accelerates the activation of the anticoagulant protein C (7Dudek A.Z. Pennell C.A. Decker T.D. Young T.A. Key N.S.

Fibrinogen is a Mr 340,000 glycoprotein consisting of a pair of α-, β-, and γ-chains. The molecule comprises two outer D-nodules connected through coiled-coil domains to a central E-nodule (10Doolittle R.F. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2003; 1: 1559-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 11Doolittle R.F. Blood Rev. 2003; 17: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The E-nodule includes all six NH2 termini, and each D-nodule contains the COOH terminus of the β- and γ-chains folded into globular domains, namely βC and γC (12Brown J.H. Volkmann N. Jun G. Henschen-Edman A.H. Cohen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 13Yang Z. Pandi L. Doolittle R.F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15610-15617Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Fibrin formation is initiated by a thrombin-catalyzed removal of two peptides (fibrinopeptides A) from the NH2 termini of the α-chains within the central E-nodule, thus exposing two new NH2 termini that begin with GPRV (14Yang Z. Mochalkin I. Doolittle R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14156-14161Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 15Blombäck B. Bark N. Biophys. Chem. 2004; 112: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These new NH2 termini constitute A-knobs capable of binding to an appropriate site (the “hole a”) in the distal γC-domain of another fibrin molecule. The ensuing non-covalent interaction assembles fibrin monomers into overlapping half-staggered structures called protofibrils (16Mosesson M.W. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2005; 3: 1894-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). Protofibrils undergo a transverse association to form a three-dimensional insoluble, yet porous, network of thicker and branched fibers. A second or concurrent step is further cleavage by thrombin of fibrinopeptides B of the β-chains, again within the central E-nodule. Each new NH2 terminus exposes a GHRP sequence constituting a B-knob that potentially complements an additional site (the “hole b”) within the βC-domain of an outer D-nodule (14Yang Z. Mochalkin I. Doolittle R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14156-14161Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Although the role of the A-knob/hole a interaction is well established, that of the B-knob/hole b interaction is unclear since it is not critical for network formation, although it presumably enhances lateral aggregation and assembly of protofibrils (17Weisel J.W. Veklich Y. Gorkun O. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 285-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 18Lounes K.C. Ping L. Gorkun O.V. Lord S.T.

Snake venom toxins such as reptilase (Ancrod) that remove only fibrinopeptide A from fibrinogen (leaving fibrinopeptide B intact), trigger fibrin network assembly resembling that induced by thrombin (18Lounes K.C.

Haemost. 2005; 3: 1791-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Accordingly, Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro-amide (GPRPam), which mimics the A-knob, impedes polymerization, whereas Gly-His-Arg-Pro-amide (GHRPam), which mimics the B-knob, does not (21Laudano A.P. Doolittle R.F.

A. 1985; 82: 1410-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In a final step, the fibrin network is strengthened by activated factor XIII (FXIIIa) through transglutamination of γC-domains, covalently cross-linking the network (23Ariëns R.A. Lai T.S. Weisel J.W. Greenberg C.S. Grant P.J. Blood. 2002; 100: 743-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 24Lorand L. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2005; 3: 1337-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Fibrin is eventually degraded by plasmin such that D-nodules originally belonging to different fibrinogen molecules are kept together by the covalent linkages formed by FXIIIa. Named D-dimers, these fragments include two γC-domains (with a hole a), two βC-domains (with a hole b), and part of the coiled-coil domains originally linking the D- to E-nodules. Most D-dimer crystal structures show an offset arrangement, in accord with the anticipated half-staggered overlapping structure of protofibrils and the banding pattern of mature fibrin fibers observed by transmission or scanning electron microscopy (16Mosesson M.W. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2005; 3: 1894-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar, 17Weisel J.W. Veklich Y. Gorkun O. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 285-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Two interfaces (namely, I and II) have been observed (13Yang Z. Pandi L. Doolittle R.F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15610-15617Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Interface I, most commonly deduced from x-ray diffraction data, seems to be the “preferred” interface (11Doolittle R.F. Blood Rev. 2003; 17: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, the γC-γC cross-linking takes place unambiguously across the alternate interface (II), whereas it had never been confirmed to occur through interface I. Nevertheless, although their geometry differs, both the interface I and the interface II models are consistent with the organization of protofibrils into overlapping half-staggered fibrin. Since the highest amount of PF4 is released in the vicinity of expanding fibrin clots, and subnanomolar amounts of monomeric (25Chen M.J. Mayo K.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6402-6411Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) PF4 enhance fibrin fiber polymerization (26Carr M.E. White II, G.C. Gabriel D.A. Thromb. Res. 1987; 45: 539-543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 27Weisel J.W. Nagaswami C. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 111-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), we investigated whether large amounts of PF4 could contribute to blood coagulation. We here provide direct biophysical evidence that tetrameric PF4 (25Chen M.J. Mayo K.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6402-6411Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) in amounts released in the neighborhood of platelets incorporates into and structures a previously unidentified soft and transparent fibrin network having a low porosity. Proteins and Reagents—Blood was collected with informed consent from healthy volunteers by venipuncture in 1:9 (v/v) acid citrate dextrose. Platelet-rich plasma was prepared by centrifugation (170 × g, 12 min, 20 °C) and used immediately. Platelet-poor plasma was obtained after further centrifugation (680 × g, 12 min, 20 °C). Human prothrombin and fibrinogen were purified from outdated plasma, and prothrombin was converted to thrombin and titrated as described previously (28Le Bonniec B.F. MacGillivray R.T. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13796-13803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Le Bonniec B.F. Guinto E.R. MacGillivray R.T. Stone S.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19055-19061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Soluble fibrin (10 μm) was prepared from clots formed in the presence of 5 mm iodoacetamide. Clots were washed in kinetic buffer (Tris-HCl 50 mm, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl and 5 mm CaCl2) and solubilized by incubation (1 h, 20 °C) with 50 mm CH3COOH. Mixtures of D-dimers and D-nodules were prepared according to Everse et al. (30Everse S.J. Pelletier H. Doolittle R.F. Protein. Sci. 1995; 4: 1013-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) by affinity chromatography on silica gel linked to the COOH-terminal end of peptide GPRPAAAAA (Altergen, Schiltigheim, France). Briefly, plasmin (300 nm) was added to fibrin clots prepared without iodoacetamide, incubated (16 h, 20 °C), and neutralized with aprotinin (10 μm). Bound material was eluted by NaH2PO4 50 mm, pH 3.7, and precipitated with ammonium sulfate (70% saturation, 4 °C) after correcting the pH to 7.5 with 2.0 m Tris-HCl. Recombinant PF4 and the chromogenic substrate H-d-Phe-Pip-Arg-pNA (S2238) were purchased from Biogenic (Maurin, France); reptilase (Ancrod), plasmin, FXIIIa, and sheep antihuman PF4 were from Kordia (Leiden, the Netherlands); bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (aprotinin), GPRPam, poly-l-lysine (Mr 15,000-30,000), Polybrene, and iodoacetamide were from Sigma (Saint-Quentin, Fallavier, France); and rabbit brain phospholipids (Platelet factor 3 reagent) were from Organon Teknika (Durham, NC). The peptide QVRPRHIT derived from PF4 and the control peptide RQVHIRPT were prepared by Altergen. Buffers were made daily, and all proteins were stored at -80 °C in small aliquots until use. Experiments were reproduced a number of times in various conditions, and several were repeated independently by two of the authors. Data obtained in identical conditions were fully exchangeable. The figures illustrate representative experiments. Turbidimetry and Enzyme Kinetics—Turbidity was recorded at 405 nm in prewarmed (37 °C) microtiter plates after adding 170 μl of prewarmed plasma to a mixture of 10 μl of platelet factor 3 reagent and 20 μl of CaCl2 (60 mm) with or without PF4. With purified fibrinogen (1-5 μm), A405 was recorded in kinetic buffer after adding thrombin (0.2-5 nm) or reptilase (3-5 units/ml). Fibrin repolymerization (3 μm) was triggered in the presence or absence of PF4 by raising the pH to 7.5 by adding (v/v) a mixture of 50 mm MOPS, 50 mm NaOH, 20 mm CaCl2, and 0.15 m NaCl. In all experiments evaluating fibrin (re)polymerization, particular care was taken to maintain NaCl and CaCl2 concentrations, total ionic strength, and pH identical in all samples as these influence dramatically the fibrin network structure (27Weisel J.W. Nagaswami C. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 111-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 31Mihalyi E. Biophys. Chem. 2004; 112: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The progress of fibrinopeptides A and B release was studied according to Higgins et al. (32Higgins D.L. Lewis S.D. Shafer J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9276-9282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as described previously (28Le Bonniec B.F. MacGillivray R.T. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13796-13803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, reactions were stopped at timed intervals by adding phosphoric acid (10%), and fibrinopeptides were separated and quantified by reverse phase chromatography on a C18 column (218TP54, Vidac) developed with a linear gradient (0-50% CH3-CN in 0.5%, v/v, phosphoric acid). Progress of γ-γ dimer formation by FXIIIa was also examined as described previously (29Le Bonniec B.F. Guinto E.R. MacGillivray R.T. Stone S.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19055-19061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, reactions were stopped at timed intervals, and clots were dissolved by adding 5% (v/v) CH3COOH in Laemmli's buffer. Samples (about 4 μg of protein) were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10%) after denaturation (15 min, 95 °C) in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol (30%, v/v) and just enough Tris-HCl to raise the pH to 6.8. Rheology—The dynamic viscoelasticity of fibrin gels prepared with and without PF4 was studied at 25 °C using a straincontrolled rheometer (ARES LS1, TA Instruments, New Castle, DE) essentially according to Janmey et al. (33Janmey P.A. Amis E.J. Ferry J.D. J. Rheol. 1983; 27: 135-153Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and Ryan et al. (34Ryan E.A. Mockros L.F. Weisel J.W. Lorand L. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2813-2826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The reaction components were thoroughly mixed, and 300 μl quickly transferred between the titanium cone and stainless plate of the apparatus (25-mm diameter, 0.04-radian angle, 45-μm gap). Elastic (G′) and loss (G″) moduli (1% strain, 1 Hz) were recorded every 9 s for 1 h. Following polymerization, the frequency dependence of G′ and G″ between 1 and 100 Hz were characterized at 1% strain. Sequentially increasing strain (up to 1000%, 1 Hz) was then applied, allowing detection of strain hardening when relevant and the minimum required for the gel to collapse. Sample evaporation was prevented by a homemade cover maintaining a 100% humidity atmosphere, and preliminary short strain sweep scanning indicated that with all gels studied, a 1% strain deformation at 1 Hz was fully reversible. Scanning Electron Microscopy—Clots (10 μl) were formed in kinetic buffer on a glass lens by mixing (v/v) thrombin (2.5 nm) with fibrinogen (5 μm) and varying concentrations of PF4. Immediately following the initiation of clotting, the solution was sprayed, and polymerization was allowed to proceed in a humid chamber (1 h, 20 °C). Clots were washed in kinetic buffer, fixed in buffered glutaraldehyde (1 h, 2%, v/v), dehydrated by stepwise ethanol gradients, and critical point-dried in hexamethyldisilizane (Sigma). Samples were mounted on specimen stubs, sputter coated with gold using a JEOL JFC100, and examined at 16 kV using a JEOL ISM 35CF (Croissy sur Seine, France). Modeling Studies—Swiss-Pdb viewer was used to generate models of complexes between PF4 tetramer (1PFN) and human D-dimers (1FZF) or lamprey D-dimers (1N73). Docking was achieved by superimposing the Arg22 Cα of the PRH motif in PF4 with the Arg3 Cα of GHRPam co-crystallized with D-dimer (the Cαs were separated by 0.1 Å for double docking of PF4 to holes a). A unique docking satisfying both overlapping of the tripeptides (running antiparallel) and absence of steric hindrance was achieved by simple rotation around the overlapping points. Physiologic Amounts of PF4 Alter the Rate of Formation of Fibrin Clots—The progress of clot formation may be monitored through its absorbance since protofibril association increases light scattering. Typically, the shorter the clotting time, the thinner (thus less turbid) is the bunch of protofibrils constituting the fibrin network. Platelet-rich plasma has a higher intrinsic turbidity than platelet-poor plasma due to light scattering by platelets. We nevertheless observed that the difference between final and initial turbidities was less in platelet-rich plasma than in platelet-poor plasma (Fig. 1A). This observation was puzzling because the time to gelation (i.e. to reach half-maximum turbidity) differed by less than 4% (10 s), whereas the relative turbidity almost doubled. To investigate the possible contribution of PF4 to clot formation, we compared the effect of various amounts of PF4 on the turbidity of clots formed in platelet-poor plasma (Fig. 1B). As little as 25 nm PF4 had a discernible effect on final turbidity, and increasing amounts of PF4 decreased final turbidity further. In contrast to clots triggered in platelet-rich plasma, however, the time to gelation was also affected. At a concentration occurring in the vicinity of blood clot extension in vivo (300-600 nm), PF4 not only caused a dramatic decrease of the final turbidity, it also considerably increased the lag phase (from 218 s without PF4 to 552 s with 375 nm PF4). Platelets alter the fibrin network structure through thrombospondin release (35Dhall T.Z. Shah G.A. Ferguson I.A. Dhall D.P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1983; 49: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 36Bale M.D. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 862-868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Collet J.P. Montalescot G. Lesty C. Weisel J.W. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 428-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Similar to PF4, thrombospondin decreases the final turbidity of clots, but contrary to PF4, it decreases the lag phase (36Bale M.D. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 862-868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the low increase of turbidity in platelet-rich plasma required PF4, possibly in synergy with thrombospondin, whereas the unaltered lag phase perhaps originated from their opposing effects. Thrombin Catalysis Is Unaffected by PF4—Since PF4 is heavily charged, we investigated whether the observed effects could simply reflect an electrostatic steering interference with thrombin catalysis. Polybrene and poly-l-lysine are polycationic compounds having an average Mr of 7500, comparable with that of PF4 monomers, and of 22,500, comparable with that of PF4 tetramers, respectively. If the effect of PF4 were nonspecific and resulted solely from charge repulsion, Polybrene and/or poly-l-lysine would mimic PF4. We therefore compared the effect of PF4, Polybrene, and poly-l-lysine on thrombin-mediated clotting of purified fibrinogen. Increasing amounts of PF4 resulted in a similar effect as observed in platelet-poor plasma; as concentration increased, the final turbidity decreased, and the lag phase lengthened, yet gelation ultimately occurred (Fig. 1C). Polybrene had little or no effect on fibrinogen clotting (Fig. 1E). As reported by Carr et al. (38Carr M.E. Cromartie R. Gabriel D.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1384-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), poly-l-lysine had an effect opposite to PF4, i.e. increasing concentrations enhanced the final turbidity, whereas the lag phase decreased (Fig. 1F). Thus, the effects of PF4 clearly differ from that of two other positively charged compounds and were therefore unlikely to result from a general unspecific charge effect on fibrin assembly. When fibrinogen clotting was triggered by reptilase instead of thrombin, PF4 still affected the outcome (Fig. 1D). The final turbidity decreased and the lag phase lengthened with increasing PF4 concentration, yet gelation ultimately occurred. Similar effects were thus obtained with both reptilase and thrombin, supporting the hypothesis that PF4 interacted with fibrinogen and/or fibrin; alternately, PF4 would have to affect both proteases through discrete allosteric alterations. The rates of H-d-Phe-Pro-Arg-pNA hydrolysis by either thrombin or reptilase were unaffected by large amounts of PF4 or poly-l-lysine and only marginally affected by Polybrene (data not shown), rendering it unlikely that the impact of PF4 on clot formation was mediated through allosteric alteration (39Marque P.E. Spuntarelli R. Juliano L. Aiach M. Le Bonniec B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 809-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). That the effect of PF4 resulted from a specific interaction and not from an incompletely controlled parameter was also attested by the observation that a stoichiometric amount of an anti-PF4 antibody attenuated the effect of PF4 by 75% (Fig. 2A). Fibrinogen Cleavage Is Little Affected, if at All, by PF4—Fibrinogen hydrolysis is a partially ordered reaction with release of fibrinopeptide A preceding that of fibrinopeptide B. We considered that through binding to fibrinogen, PF4 could shield it from thrombin and/or reptilase, thus preventing cleavage. However, the release of fibrinopeptide A by thrombin or reptilase was little affected, if at all, by PF4 (Fig. 2B). In contrast, hydrolysis of fibrinopeptide B by thrombin was delayed in the presence of PF4 (Fig. 2C). Thus, binding of PF4 to partially hydrolyzed fibrinogen (lacking fibrinopeptide A only) could not be ruled out. Nevertheless, since the cleavage of fibrinopeptide B is not required for fibrin to polymerize, we concluded that the dramatic effect of PF4 on clot formation must occur at a later stage during assembly of the network. PF4 Alters the Structure of the Fibrin Network—Given that PF4 appeared to act neither through binding to the enzyme nor through binding to fibrinogen, we hypothesized that it interacted with fibrin. Fibrin monomers associate both through non-covalent interactions and through covalent γ-γ cross-linking. If γ-γ cross-linking has been prevented, the fibrin network will dissolve at low pH, whereas spontaneous repolymerization occurs when the pH is raised to 6.5. We reasoned that if PF4 chaperoned fibrin network assembly, it should also affect the repolymerization of soluble fibrin. Conclusively, when repolymerization of fibrin monomers was triggered in the presence of increasing amounts of PF4, final turbidity decreased, and gelation was delayed, although it still occurred (Fig. 2D). In addition, the macroscopic aspect of the clot was evidently affected by PF4 as the fibrin gel gradually turned jelly-like, although supra-physiologic amount of PF4 did not prevent gelation. A-knob to hole a interactions are essential for the formation of fibrin polymers; we therefore examined whether PF4 prevented binding. GPRPam (which mimics the A-knob) binds to the hole a and thus prevents self-assembly of protofibrils and network formation (20Lu Q. Clemetson J.M. Clemetson K.J. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2005; 3: 1791-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 22Bale M.D. Muller M.F. Ferry J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1410-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In accord with the concept that the size of the fibrils augments when polymerization is retarded, the final turbidity and the lag phase increased with the amount of GPRPam added (Fig. 2E). Above 500 μm, however, GPRPam extended the lag phase to the point that turbidity (and gelation) no longer developed within 2 h. Thus, the effect of GPRPam on fibrin polymerization was clearly different from that of PF4. In particular, fibrin polymerization in the presence of PF4 always resulted in a discernible jelly-like mass even when clots were near transparent. Binding of synthetic B knobs to fibrinogen also increases the turbidity of fibrin clots (40Doolittle R.F. Pandi L. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2657-2667Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), suggesting that PF4 did not act through simple blockage of either the holes a or the holes b. PF4 Considerably Alters the Porosity and Viscoelasticity of the Fibrin Network—Turbidity reflects only in part the structure of a fibrin network; porosity and viscosity are also essential features (34Ryan E.A. Mockros L.F. Weisel J.W. Lorand L. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2813-2826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 41Blombäck B. Carlsson K. Hessel B. Liljeborg A. Procyk R. Aslund N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 997: 96-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The porosity of a clot can be evaluated by measuring flow-through. With stiff structures, clots can be formed in a small plugged syringe. Once the fibrin has polymerized, the syringe is unplugged, a given volume of buffer is added, and flow-through is recorded. Clots formed in the presence of saturating amounts of PF4 were too soft to stand alone in a syringe. Thus, to evaluate the effect of PF4 on porosity, fibrinogen containing various amount of PF4 was polymerized on top of a “normal” fibrin network serving as a supporting grid. PF4 dramatically changed the porosity. Permeability decreased rapidly with increasing PF4 concentrations and leveled off at about 25% that of the control. The flow rates for PF4-free clots and clots containing 300 nm PF4 were 1.1 ± 0.16 and 0.25 ± 0.01 μl min-1, respectively (Fig. 2F). Thus, the maximum effect of PF4 on porosity occurred when the molar ratio of fibrin to PF4 was four (two fibrin molecules for each PF4 monomer). Assuming that viscosity of the buffer was 10-3 poise (dynes s cm-2), the permeation coefficient (Darcy constant, which reflects the structure of the pore within the network) would drop from 1.054 ± 0.168 10-9 to 0.239 ± 0.01 10-9 cm2 with saturating amounts of PF4 (42Woodhead J.L.

PF4 evidently modified the viscoelastic properties of the fibrin network; it induced the formation of jelly-like masses instead of the stiff clot that formed in its absence. The values of G′ and G″ decreased simultaneously when the amount of PF4 increased: from 559 ± 6 to 18.1 ± 1.5 and from 26.3 ± 1.9 to 0.44 ± 0.16, respectively (Fig. 3, A and B). Thus, irrespective of the amount of PF4 added, the elastic resistances to deformation (the shear modulus G″/G′) were relatively comparable for all gels ("

Recently, transcription of seven human (h) protein coding genes was reported to be activated by the human ortholog hStaf/ZNF143. Here we have used a combined in silico and biochemical approach to identify 1175 conserved hStaf/ZNF143-binding sites (SBS) distributed in 938 promoters of four mammalian genomes. The SBS shows a significant positional preference and occurs mostly within 200 bp upstream of the transcription start site. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays with 295 of the promoters established that 90% contain bona fide SBS. By extrapolating the values of this mapping to the full sizes of the mammalian genomes, we can infer the existence of at least 2500 SBS distributed in 2000 promoters. This unexpected large number strongly suggests that SBS constitutes one of the most widespread transcription factor-binding sites in mammalian promoters. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the presence of the SBS alone is sufficient to direct expression of a luciferase reporter gene, suggesting that hStaf/ZNF143 can recruit per se the transcription machinery.

The vertebrate transcription factor Staf was originally identified in Xenopus laevis as the transcriptional activator of the tRNASec gene (1Schuster C. Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3777-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Since then, Staf has also been involved in transcriptional activation of snRNA 2The abbreviations used are: snRNA, small nuclear RNA; h, human; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; WT, wild type; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; SBS, Staf-binding site; TSS, transcription start sites; USP, unique site promoter; MSP, multiple site promoter; MCS, motif conservation score; DBTSS, Data Base of Human Transcription Start Sites. and snRNA-type genes (2Schaub M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2502-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Staf binds to the Staf-binding site (SBS), a sequence identified in promoters of many vertebrate snRNA and snRNA-type genes transcribed by RNA polymerases II or III. Seven contiguous zinc fingers of the C2-H2 type, located in the central part of the protein, contain the DNA-binding domain. Binding site selection experiments identified the 18-bp YWCCCRNMATSCMYYRCR (Y, W, R, N, M, and S stand for T/C, A/T, A/G, any nucleotide, A/C, and G/C, respectively) or TACCCATAATGCATYGCG sequences as the Staf consensus binding sites, depending on whether moderate or highly stringent conditions were employed (2Schaub M. Myslinski E. Schuster C. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 4Schaub M. Krol A. Carbon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24241-24249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Compared with the consensus sequences, known Staf-binding sites revealed a high degree of divergence. This is well illustrated by the absence of either the 5′ part in the Xenopus tRNASec or the 3′ part in the human U6 snRNA sites (5Schaub M. Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25042-25050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Not all the seven zinc fingers are necessary for the binding of Staf to the SBS. For example, zinc finger 7 does not establish base-specific contacts in Staf-DNA complexes, and the requirement for zinc finger 1 is flexible because it contacts the DNA at the Xenopus tRNASec but not human U6 snRNA Staf motifs (5Schaub M. Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25042-25050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The nonutilization of zinc finger 1 at the human U6 promoter enables the simultaneous binding of Staf and Oct-1 to their cognate DNA motifs; Oct-1 is another factor involved in transcriptional activation of the human U6 snRNA gene (5Schaub M. Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25042-25050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). ZNF76 and ZNF143 are two human homologs of Xenopus Staf, with ZNF143 being the ortholog and ZNF76 a likely paralog (6Ragoussis J. Senger G. Mockridge I. Sanseau P. Ruddy S. Dudley K. Sheer D. Trowsdale J. Genomics. 1992; 14: 673-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 7Tommerup N. Vissing H. Genomics. 1995; 27: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 8Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21998-22006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). ZNF143 is conserved in vertebrates and urochordates, such as Ciona intestinalis, whereas ZNF76 is only present in vertebrates. In this study, human Staf will be referred to as hStaf/ZNF143. Moreover, Staf possesses the capacity to stimulate chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression from a synthetic mRNA promoter (SBS-tkCAT), containing SBS linked to the basal promoter of the thymidine kinase gene fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter (9Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The presence of two physically and functionally distinct activation domains constitutes the molecular basis underlying the abilities of hStaf/ZNF143 to stimulate transcription from either snRNA-type or mRNA promoters. Indeed, although a 93-amino acid domain made of four repeat units is specialized for activating transcription from an mRNA promoter, a segment of only 18 amino acids acts specifically on snRNA and snRNA-type promoters (10Schuster C. Krol A. Carbon P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2650-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To date, only the following seven protein coding genes have been described to be regulated by hStaf/ZNF143: the cytosolic chaperonin containing t-complex polypeptide 1 (TCP1) (11Kubota H. Yokota S.

In this work, we describe the results of an analysis aimed at identifying hStaf/ZNF143-binding sites across mammalian genomes. We have used in silico genome-wide analysis to identify 1175 SBS distributed in 938 promoters, among which 295 were chosen for experimental validation by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Semi-quantitative PCR confirmed the binding of hStaf/ZNF143 to 266 (90%) of the tested loci. Most of the identified SBS were located near the transcription start site and were tightly associated with CpG islands. Extrapolated to the full sizes of the mammalian genomes, this partial mapping revealed an unexpected large number of SBS in the promoters of protein coding genes, with at least 2500 SBS distributed in 2000 promoters. Furthermore, this study established that the presence of SBS alone is sufficient to stimulate the expression of a luciferase reporter gene, suggesting that hStaf/ZNF143 can recruit the transcription machinery and up-regulate transcription of an extraordinary high number of genes. Bioinformatics—Human promoters containing putative SBS were obtained by searching transcription factor-binding sites at DBTSS (18Suzuki Y. Yamashita R. Nakai K. Sugano S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 328-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 19Yamashita R. Suzuki Y. Wakaguri H. Tsuritani K. Nakai K. Sugano S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D86-D89Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). DBTSS version 4 (2003 human hg16 assembly) was queried with the Staf-binding sites listed in Table 1. Alignments of the human and mouse promoter sequences provided by DBTSS were examined for Staf-binding site conservation in the mouse. Using the human promoter sequences containing the SBS motif as the query, we looked for motif conservation in mouse (for promoters not present in DBTSS), rat, and dog genomes based on the vertebrate Multiz alignment (BLAT search at the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Site). Assignment of the identified genes to categories of functional groups was performed using information from NCBI Entrez gene and Gene Ontology provided by GOA.TABLE 1Identification of Staf-binding sites by searching transcription factor-binding sites at DBTSSQuery nameSequenceHuman/mouse hitsACTACAN and variants%A1YYCCCANNRNRCNNYRCR18561B1-R----------------3129C1R-----------------7945D1-----G------------9338E1RR----------------170.5F1----------Y-------9734G1-----------------Y3253H1--T---------------1376I1---------------GGG4763J1--------Y---------1612K1--------------R---3838A1—K164847 Open table in a new tab The proximity of CpG islands to the identified SBS was found by examining at DBTSS the results of the search for transcription factor-binding sites. The coordinates of the human Staf-binding sites (based on the May 2004 human hg17) were extracted by BLAT search at the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Site, using the corresponding sequence. Positions of the Staf-binding sites in human and mouse promoters were obtained by searching DBTSS for transcription factor-binding site. Identification of additional Staf-binding sites from the work of Xie et al. (20Xie X. Lu J. Kulbokas E.J. Golub T.R. Mootha V. Lindblad-Toh K. Lander E.S. Kellis M. Nature. 2005; 434: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar) was performed as follows. The coordinates of the discovered motifs corresponding to sequences ACTAYRNNNCCCR, ACTACNNNNCCC, and ACTACNNNTCCCR (Xie motifs), in direct and reverse orientations, were obtained on line. Sequences located 3′ to the Xie motifs were extracted with the Human Genome Browser. 3′-Extended Xie motifs were visually examined for the presence of an associated Staf-binding site. Conservation of the newly identified Staf motifs, in the mouse, rat, and dog genomes, was evaluated by the vertebrate Multiz alignment. Sequence logos were created using WebLogo (21Crooks G.E. Hon G. Chandonia J.M. Brenner S.E. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 1188-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (8318) Google Scholar). Reporter Constructs—WTSBS-Luc, mut-1 SBS-Luc, and mut-2 SBS-Luc were obtained by inserting into the promoter-less pGL3-basic vector (Promega) a 150-bp KpnI-HindIII DNA fragment containing three copies of the tRNASec gene SBS, either the WT GTACCAGCATGCCTCGCG, mut-1 GTACCATACGTACTCGCG, or mut-2 GTAAACGCATGCCTCGCG sequences, respectively (1Schuster C. Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3777-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 9Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Transfection and Luciferase Assays—COS-7 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation procedure with 1 μg of reporter construct, 0.5 μg of pCH110 plasmid as the internal control, and carrier DNA to bring up the total DNA content to 10 μg/plate. After 24 h, cells were lysed, and the β-galactosidase activity was measured as described previously (10Schuster C. Krol A. Carbon P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2650-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The luciferase assay was performed as recommended by the manufacturer. The luciferase activity was normalized to the β-galactosidase activity. Each transfection experiment was done in triplicate. ChIP Assay—The ChIP procedure was essentially as described in Weinmann and Farnham (22Weinmann A.S. Farnham P.J. Methods (Orlando). 2002; 26: 37-47Crossref Scopus (301) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. HeLa cells (106 cells/ml) were treated with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of glycine to a final concentration of 125 mm. Cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors, scraped, centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 min, then resuspended in cell lysis buffer (5 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 8, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitors), and kept on ice for 10 min. They were homogenized 10 times with a Dounce homogenizer, and the resultant homogenates were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min to pellet the nuclei. Nuclei were resuspended in 1.5 ml of shearing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, protease inhibitors). Nuclear lysates were sonicated on ice to an average chromatin length of 0.5–1 kb (three pulses of 20 s at a setting of 25 with a Vibra-cell sonicator; Bioblock Scientific) and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 12 min. The supernatant was incubated with 10 volumes of ChIP buffer (50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.9, 140 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.01% SDS, protease inhibitors) with protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4°C. After protein A-Sepharose removal, the precleared lysates were used as the soluble chromatin for ChIP. Chromatin was incubated at 4 °C overnight with 3.5 μg of anti-hStaf/ZNF143. Control for no antibody was included. Immune complexes were recovered by incubation for 2 h at 4°C with protein A-Sepharose previously blocked in buffer containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 1 mg/ml salmon testis DNA. Immune complexes were washed four times sequentially in the following buffers (shearing buffer; wash buffer 1: 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.9, 300 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS; wash buffer 2: 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS; wash buffer 3: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 250 mm LiCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1% deoxycholate; TE buffer). The DNA-protein complex was eluted in 400 μl of elution buffer (100 mm NaHCO3, 1% SDS) at room temperature for 15 min. The formaldehyde cross-link was reversed by overnight incubation at 65 °C in the presence of 190 mm NaCl. Immunoprecipitated DNA was released by treatment with 100 μg of proteinase K for 1 h at 45 °C in the presence of 10 mm EDTA and 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5. The DNA was purified by phenol extraction and ethanol-precipitated. The rabbit polyclonal antipeptide antibody against a C-terminal epitope of the Xenopus Staf protein (5Schaub M. Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25042-25050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) was used for ChIP. PCR Analysis—Purified DNA was analyzed in 25-μl PCRs with primer pairs flanking the predicted SBS and in the presence of 3 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol). PCR products were 140–400 bp in length. Half of the samples were resolved by native PAGE and revealed by autoradiography. Typically, 1/500 and 1/2000 of the immunoprecipitated DNA were used for PCR analysis. Decreasing amounts of input DNA (1/10,000, 1/25,000, and 1/100,000) were used to determine the linear range of the PCR for each primer pair. Cycling parameters were 95 °C for 3 min, 35 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 52–72 °C (depending on each primer pair) for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 5 min. For the negative controls of ChIP assay, we used the PP1 to PP4 primer pairs hybridizing to unique regions lying 2.4, 2.1, 6.5, and 2.5 kbp upstream of the tRNASec, U4 ATAC, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and Budding Uninhibited by Benzimidazoles 1 (BUB1B) genes, respectively. The primer sequences used in this study are available on request. In Silico Identification of 893 Potential hStaf/ZNF143-binding Sites across Human and Mouse Protein Gene Promoters—Our strategy for identifying human promoters directly bound by Staf was based on the pre-selection of candidates showing phylogenetic conservation of the SBS site in orthologous mammalian promoters, followed by the experimental analysis of a large number of individual sites with a semi-quantitative ChIP assay. The pre-selected promoters were identified by searching potential human transcription factor-binding sites at the DBTSS promoter data base (18Suzuki Y. Yamashita R. Nakai K. Sugano S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 328-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 19Yamashita R. Suzuki Y. Wakaguri H. Tsuritani K. Nakai K. Sugano S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D86-D89Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) that are conserved in orthologous mouse promoters. The DBTSS data base was originally constructed from a collection of experimentally determined transcription start sites (TSS) of human genes and is suitable for comparative analysis of human and mouse orthologous promoters. Version 4 used in this study was based on human hg16 and contains 8793 human promoter sequences. From the scrutiny of seven known target genes, we could localize the Staf-binding sites in promoters lying at the proximity of TSS. Therefore, the analysis was further limited to sequences spanning 1000 bp upstream and 200 bp downstream of the TSS. Eleven 18-bp-long sequences (A1 to K1 in Table 1) were used as queries for the first round of motif search. The 18-bp YYCCCANNRNRCNNYRCR A1 sequence is the consensus derived by comparing the eight Staf motifs identified in seven human and mouse protein coding genes (11Kubota H. Yokota S. Yanagi H. Yura T.

It is more degenerated than the Staf consensus sequences derived from binding site selection experiments under moderately stringent conditions (see Introduction). With respect to A1, the B1 to K1 sequences bear 1-, 2-, or 3-bp variations (Table 1). These changes were chosen from the constraints observed at several positions in binding site selection experiments (2Schaub M. Myslinski E. Schuster C. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 4Schaub M. Krol A. Carbon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24241-24249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Among the DBTSS entries, a high number of promoters scored positive with one or more potential Staf-binding sites within the predetermined boundaries, identifying a total of 1488 potential binding sites with 648 motifs (43.5%) conserved in the orthologous mouse promoters (Table 1 and supplemental Table S1). Table 1 indicates that the score distribution is not uniform, the highest ones being obtained for the A1 and F1 sequences with 185 and 97 human/mouse conserved hits, the lowest score arising from the H1 sequence with 13 human/mouse conserved hits. Generally, a good correlation was observed at one given position between score distribution and the nucleotide preference obtained from binding site selection experiments (2Schaub M. Myslinski E. Schuster C. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 4Schaub M. Krol A. Carbon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24241-24249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For example, binding site selection indicated that a C occupied position 3 in 95% of the sequences, whereas a T occurred in only 3% of the cases (2Schaub M. Myslinski E. Schuster C. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In the DBTSS screen, the same distribution was observed. The query sequence carrying a C at position 3 (A1) produced 185 conserved hits between human and mouse, a single C to T change (H1) leading to only 13 hits (Table 1). Interestingly, sequence alignments of putative SBS show that residues preferentially occupying positions 7–11, 13–16, and 18 (Fig. 1A, right panel), corresponding to N, R, or Y in the queried sequences in Table 1, are identical to those derived from the binding site selection experiments (2Schaub M. Myslinski E. Schuster C. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This strongly suggests that the identified sequences represent bona fide SBS. Inspection of the adjacent sequences to the potential SBS revealed the presence of the 7-bp ACTACAN motif, or a 1–2-bp variant, among 305 (47%) of the 648 identified SBS (Table 1; Fig. 1A, left panel; supplemental Table S1). It lies immediately 5′ to the SBS. Therefore, to identify novel SBS that would harbor the ACTACAN motif, we performed a second round of motif search at DBTSS with the A2 to F2, H2, and J2 motifs as queries. These 19-bp motifs are arranged in the following way (see Table 2). The 5′ part is now composed of the 7-bp submotif ACTACAN, the 3′ part corresponding to bp 1–12 of the A1 to F1, H1, and J1 sequences. This second round generated 459 hits with 183 occurrences conserved in the orthologous mouse promoters but not identified by the A1 to K1 queries. It is striking to observe that the consensus sequence derived for the 6-bp sequence directly adjacent to the 3′ part of the newly identified motifs, although not included in the queries, bears high sequence similarity to sequence CC(C/T)GCG of the A1 to K1 motifs (compare positions 13–18 in Fig. 1, A and B; note that the heights of the letters are not directly proportional to occurrences). Again, this strongly argues for the characterization of genuine binding sites. Next, to characterize promoters containing at least two potential SBS, we performed a third search at DBTSS (LA1–LK1, Table 3). This round was implemented with two simultaneous queries: (i) one with the previous A1-K1 motifs (sequence motif 1 in Table 3); (ii) the second one with only the newly identified ACTACAN motif (sequence motif 2 in Table 3). The bioinformatic search was followed by visual inspection of the occurrences to detect the presence of potential SBS linked to the ACTACAN motif. In this way, we could identify 21 additional motifs that are conserved in orthologous mouse promoters (Table 3, Fig. 1C, and supplemental Table S1). Finally, the sequences of the identified promoters were visually examined for unidentified sequence elements that might serve as Staf-binding sites. This inspection enabled detection of 41 additional sites conserved in orthologous mouse promoters (named X in Fig. 1D and supplemental Table S1). To extend the phylogenetic comparison, a comparative analysis was performed in the orthologous promoters of the rat and dog genomes. Among the 893 identified motifs that we found conserved in the human and mouse genomes, 772 orthologous regions were detected in the rat and canine genomes. Interestingly, sequence comparisons revealed that 753 (97%) are also conserved in these two genomes. In 18 cases, the SBS is conserved in one of the two genomes, and in one single case only (NM_003085) they both lack it (supplemental Table S1).TABLE 2Identification of Staf-binding sites by searching transcription factor-binding sites at DBTSSQuery nameSequenceNew human/mouse hitsA2ACTACANYYCCCANNRNRC56B2--------R----------10C2-------R-----------34D2------------G------29E2-------RR----------2F2-----------------Y-39H2---------T---------3J2---------------Y---10A2—J2183 Open table in a new tab TABLE 3Identification of Staf-binding sites by searching transcription factor-binding sites at DBTSSQuery nameSequence motif 1Sequence motif 2New human/mouse hitsLA1A1 (YYCCCANNRNRCNNYRCR)ACTACAN12LB1B1 (-R----------------)ACTACAN0LC1C1 (R-----------------)ACTACAN6LD1D1 (-----G------------)ACTACAN1LE1E1 (RR----------------)ACTACAN1LF1F1 (----------Y-------)ACTACAN0LG1G1 (-----------------Y)ACTACAN1LH1H1 (--T---------------)ACTACAN0LI1I1 (---------------GGG)ACTACAN0LJ1J1 (--------Y---------)ACTACAN0LK1K1 (--------------R---)ACTACAN0LA1—LK121 Open table in a new tab Altogether, our comparative search identified 893 SBS conserved in mouse and residing in 716 promoters of human protein coding genes.

Both the SBS and the associated ACTACAN motifs are also conserved with a very high prevalence in the rat and dog genomes. Identification of 282 Other Putative hStaf/ZNF143-binding Sites—A recent report described the systematic discovery of regulatory motifs in human promoters by comparing several mammalian genomes (20Xie X. Lu J. Kulbokas E.J. Golub T.R. Mootha V. Lindblad-Toh K. Lander E.S. Kellis M. Nature. 2005; 434: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). Among the 174 conserved motifs that the authors discovered in the promoters of protein coding genes, the 13-bp ACTAYRNNNCCCR M4 sequence is particularly interesting because ACTAYRN shows a strong match to the SBS-adjacent ACTACAN submotif, and NNCCCR is highly similar to the 5′ part of the SBS. We thus sought to use the M4 motif to uncover new SBS by searching for the presence of SBS overlapping the M4 motif. This led us to discover 282 new potential SBS (see logo sequence derived from sequence comparisons, Fig. 1E). Among these, 23 are located in promoters previously identified by our search at DBTSS, and the other 259 SBS are located in 222 new promoters containing this site (Fig. 2A). The 282 sites are conserved in the rat and dog genomes, with 273 (96.8%) occurring also in the mouse genome (supplemental Table S1). Collectively, our in silico analysis resulted in the identification of 1175 conserved putative SBS harbored in 938 promoters of mammalian protein coding genes (Fig. 2A). Considering the results of this phylogenetic footprinting, it is likely that a high proportion of the identified SBS represent target sites for hStaf/ZNF143. Characteristic Features of the Identified SBS and SBS-containing Promoters—Two features characterize a transcription factor-binding site as follows: first, its position, and second, its orientation relative to the gene. Fig. 2B (see also supplemental Table S1) shows the number of human SBS, with assigned positions, plotted versus their position relative to the TSS. We found that 673 (62%) of the 1077 SBS with assigned positions occur within 200 bp upstream of the TSS. Similar values were obtained with the SBS identified in mouse promoters, consistent with the involvement of this motif in initiation of transcription. We observed that 32% of the human/mouse orthologous SBS are positioned at the same distance from the TSS but that a difference of up to 50 bp occurs in 47% of the cases. It is very likely that this variation is related to the lack of accuracy in determining the TSS of numerous genes. Another feature of the SBS motif that we detected is its property to appear as multiple copies. Overall, 188 (20%) of the 939 mammalian promoters we have identified contained multiple SBS lying within 500 bp (Fig. 2C). The majority (150) contain two SBS, with three SBS being found in 31 promoters; four genes contain four SBS (CDK5 (cyclin-dependent kin"

Although it is established that Bcl-2 localized at the mitochondria functions as an anti-apoptotic protein, the function of Bcl-2 at the nucleus remains unclear. Recently we showed that nuclear compartment-associated Bcl-2 inhibits transcription factor activation. Based on this observation, we hypothesized that presence of Bcl-2 at the nucleus may induce rather than protect cells from apoptosis. Here we investigated the putative apoptotic role of nuclear compartment-associated Bcl-2. Additionally, we examined the role of the Bcl-2 BH4 domain in mediating binding to FKBP38, the Bcl-2 mitochondrial chaperone. Our results demonstrate a novel, pro-apoptotic function for nuclear Bcl-2 and identify the Bcl-2 BH4 domain as a key regulator in mediating Bcl-2/FKBP38 binding. These results indicate that Bcl-2 has a dual role as both a protector and a killer and that the ability to switch roles depends on Bcl-2 subcellular localization.

These results indicate that Bcl-2 has a dual role as both a protector and a killer and that the ability to switch roles depends on Bcl-2 subcellular localization. Programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is a complex and well organized cellular process important during development as well as normal tissue maintenance (1Arends M.J. Wyllie A.H. Int. Rev. Exp. Pathol. 1991; 32: 223-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar, 2Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6235) Google Scholar). Abrogation of apoptotic regulation or failure to execute a precise cascade of apoptotic events can lead to premature cell loss or survival of undesired cells (3Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6179) Google Scholar). Regulation of apoptosis by the Bcl-2 family of proteins has been extensively characterized (4Bruckheimer E.M. Cho S.H. Sarkiss M. Herrmann J. McDonnell T.J. Adv. Biochem. Eng. Biotechnol. 1998; 62: 75-105PubMed Google Scholar, 5Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Annu. Rev.

Biol. 1999; 457: 217-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This family of proteins comprises more than 20 members, which can be further divided into 2 broad subfamilies depending on their function as either anti- or pro-apoptotic proteins. The prototypical anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member is Bcl-2 itself. Cells stably transfected with Bcl-2 are resistant to several apoptosis-inducing stimuli, including staurosporine, serum withdrawal, and H2O2 treatment (7Hunter J.J. Bond B.L. Parslow T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 877-883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Maroto R. Perez-Polo J.R. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 514-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the prototypical pro-apoptotic family member is Bax. Overexpression of Bax induces apoptosis and exacerbates the extent of cell death following apoptotic cell stressors (9Rosse T. Olivier R. Monney L. Rager M. Conus S. Fellay I. Jansen B. Borner C. Nature. 1998; 391: 496-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). The ability of Bcl-2 to protect cells from apoptosis is critically influenced by protein-protein interactions, post-translational modifications, and notably, subcellular localization (10Hacker G. Vaux D.L. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 622-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 11Massaad C.A. Portier B.P. Taglialatela G. J. Biol.

Bcl-2 primarily localizes to cytoplasmic facing membranes and is most commonly associated with the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), 2The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HEK cells, human embryonic kidney cells; siRNA, small interfering RNA; HA, hemagglutinin; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; IP, immunoprecipitation; PI, propidium iodide; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein. 2The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HEK cells, human embryonic kidney cells; siRNA, small interfering RNA; HA, hemagglutinin; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; IP, immunoprecipitation; PI, propidium iodide; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein. and nuclear envelope (13Krajewski S. Tanaka S. Takayama S. Schibler M.J. Fenton W. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4701-4714PubMed Google Scholar). Although Bcl-2 localizes to multiple organelles, its anti-apoptotic function has predominantly been investigated at the mitochondria, a site in which Bcl-2 is actively transported to via the mitochondrial chaperone protein FKBP38 (14Shirane M. Nakayama K.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), an atypical member of the FK506-binding immunophilin protein family (15Fisher G. Aumüller T. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 148: 105-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). FKBP38 binds and shuttles Bcl-2 away from its default localization at the ER and nuclear envelope and places it at the mitochondria (16Germain M. Shore G.C. Sci. STKE. 2003; 2003: pe10PubMed Google Scholar). Perturbations of this shuttling mechanism both alter the subcellular localization of Bcl-2 and interfere with its anti-apoptotic function (14Shirane M. Nakayama K.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Once Bcl-2 is placed on the outer mitochondrial membrane, it is capable of forming heterodimers with pro-apoptotic family members such as Bax and, thus, prevents initiation of apoptosis through blocking the formation of mitochondrial transition pores, release of cytochrome c, and subsequent activation of a caspase-9/caspase-3 cascade (17Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6199) Google Scholar, 18Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J.

Although FKBP38 is crucial for directing Bcl-2 to the mitochondria, little is known about the mechanisms of interaction between Bcl-2 and FKBP38 (19Kang C.B. Tai J. Chia J. Yoon H.S. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 1469-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) or the function of non-mitochondrial localized Bcl-2. Recent reports have described a role for Bcl-2 at the ER in regulating intralumen calcium levels, thus contributing to prevention of apoptosis through buffering of intracellular free calcium (20Baffy G. Miyashita T. Williamson J.R. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6511-6519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Distelhorst C.W. Lam M. McCormick T.S.

Among the limited reports of nuclear Bcl-2 function, two distinct activities have been observed. These include the ability of nuclear compartment-associated Bcl-2 to sequester GSH within the nucleus (23Voehringer D.W. McConkey D.J. McDonnell T.J. Brisbay S. Meyn R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2956-2960Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and the ability to block transcription factor activation (11Massaad C.A. Portier B.P. Taglialatela G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54470-54478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that in aged rats there is an oxidative stress-dependent up-regulation of nuclear compartment-associated Bcl-2 (24Kaufmann J.A. Bickford P.C. Taglialatela G. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1099-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 25Kaufmann J.A. Perez M. Zhang W. Bickford P.C. Holmes D.B. Taglialatela G. J. Neurochem. 2003; 87: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In addition, this nuclear compartment-associated Bcl-2 failed to protect cells from apoptosis induced by oxidative stress (26Kaufmann J.A. Bickford P.C. Taglialatela G. Neuroreport. 2002; 13: 1917-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). More recently, we reported that Bcl-2 localized at the nuclear compartment decreased activity of several transcription factors, particularly nuclear factor κ B (NFκB), likely through depression of nuclear trafficking (11Massaad C.A. Portier B.P. Taglialatela G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54470-54478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Given the requirement of proper NFκB activity to prevent cell death both in vitro (27Taglialatela G. Robinson R. Perez-Polo J.R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 47: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and in vivo (28Taglialatela G. Kaufmann J.A. Trevino A. Perez-Polo J.R. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 489-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), these results suggested that nuclear Bcl-2 may induce rather than prevent apoptosis. The notion that Bcl-2 can act in a pro-apoptotic fashion, albeit counterintuitive, has been previously reported. Both transient expression of Bcl-2 (29Uhlmann E.J. Subramanian T. Vater C.A. Lutz R.

Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 142-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), an event that removes the Bcl-2 BH4 domain and converts Bcl-2 into a Bax like protein, have been shown to induce apoptosis. Furthermore, interaction of Bcl-2 with the nuclear orphan receptor Nur-77, a protein that leaves the nucleus during apoptosis and binds Bcl-2 at the mitochondrion, also converts Bcl-2 into a pro-apoptotic protein (33Lin B. Kolluri S.K. Lin F. Liu W. Han Y.H. Cao X. Dawson M.I. Reed J.C. Zhang X.K. Cell. 2004; 116: 527-540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Based on published evidence of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 activity and our observation that nuclear compartment-associated Bcl-2 blocks transcription factor activation, we have investigated nuclear Bcl-2′s role in modulating cell apoptosis. We report here that nuclear compartment-associated Bcl-2 functions as a pro-apoptotic protein and that localization of Bcl-2 at the nucleus results from failure of FKBP38-mediated delivery of Bcl-2 to the mitochondria. In addition, we show that a Bcl-2 deletion mutant lacking the BH4 domain (Bcl-2ΔBH4) fails to bind FKBP38 and is solely localized at the nucleus, where it promotes apoptosis. Last, we show that an 18-amino acid peptide corresponding to the BH4 domain of human Bcl-2 binds to FKBP38. Collectively, these results illustrate that Bcl-2 can act as both a pro- or anti-apoptotic regulator depending on its subcellular localization and that the Bcl-2 BH4 domain is critical for regulating Bcl-2 subcellular localization via binding to FKPB38. These findings suggest a target for future utilization of endogenous Bcl-2 as a specific cell death inducer through the modulation of the mechanisms controlling Bcl-2 subcellular localization and function. Cell culture and general reagents were obtained from Invitrogen, Fisher, and Sigma-Aldrich unless specified otherwise. Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). pMKitNeo (vector) and pMKitNeo-Bcl-2α were kind gifts of Dr. S. May (University of Florida, Gainesville, FL). pHA-FKBP38 was a kind gift of Dr. K. I. Nakayama (Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan). Mito-Bcl-2 and Mito-Bcl-2-GFP were both kind gifts of Dr. C. W. Distelhorst (Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH). Bcl-2ΔBH4 was generated by introducing a start codon at amino acid position 25 of parental pMKitNeo-Bcl-2α flanked by a XhoI site. The obtained fragment was then digested with XhoI/EcoRI and re-cloned into pMKit-Neo. pEYFP-N1 (YFP) vector was purchased from Clontech (Mountain View, CA). pBcl-2/YFP was generated by PCR amplification of amino acids 1-661 of parental pMKitNeo-Bcl-2α, substituting the stop codon of Bcl-2 with an alanine flanked by an XhoI site. The obtained fragment was then digested with XhoI/EcoRI and re-cloned into pEYFP-N1 in-frame with its EYFP coding region. Stock cultures of rat pheochromocytoma PC12 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks in 12 ml of RPMI 1640 culture medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% (v/v) heat-inactivated donor horse serum (Invitrogen), 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gemini, Woodland, CA), and 1% antibiotic mixture penicillin, streptomycin (Cellgro, Herndon, VA) in a humidified cell incubator at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. B104 cells were maintained in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks in 12 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Both HeLa and HEK293 cells were maintained in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks in 12 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For all cultured cells medium (5 ml) was replaced every other day for maintenance of cell viability. Cells were subcultured twice a week. PC12 and B104 cells were subcultured by tapping flask, and 25% of cells were removed to a new culture flask and replaced with normal growth medium. Subculturing HeLa and HEK293 cells was achieved by incubating cells for 5 min with PBS supplemented with 5 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) to detach cells from the plate surface. After detachment, cells were collected, centrifuged (800 × g for 5 min), and ultimately plated at 1/10th the original cell density in fresh growth medium. All transfections were performed using Lipofectamine with Plus reagent (Invitrogen). Transfections were carried out via the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells at 40-50% confluence received DNA/plus reagent coupled to Lipofectamine and diluted in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). 3 h post-transfection, the liposome/DNA mixture was replaced with fresh culture medium, and the transiently transfected cells were allowed 24-48 h of recovery. Stable cell lines were generated using the same transfection method followed by the addition of a selective antibiotic to the culture medium (Geneticin; Invitrogen). PC12 cells (1.0 × 105) were seeded into 6-well plates and grown to 50% confluency. The fkbp8 (FKBP38 small interfering RNA (siRNA)) (ON TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNA; Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) or control siRNA (ON TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNA; Dharmacon) was combined with Dharma-FECT transfection reagent #1 (Dharmacon), and the cells were transfected according to the recommended protocol with siRNA (100 nm final concentration). After 48 h of transfection, cell lysates were prepared for Western blot analysis. Peptides were generated by solid-phase peptide synthesis using standard Fmoc chemistry and purified by HPLC. Identity was confirmed by amino acid analysis and mass spectrometry. hBcl-2 amino acids 11-28, BH4 (DNREIVMKYIHYKLSQRG) and BH4scramble (VKRDYRSMIKGEHQLYIN) peptides were synthesized by the University of Texas Medical Branch protein synthesis core and were HPLC-purified to >95% purity. Western blotting was performed as previously described (11Massaad C.A. Portier B.P. Taglialatela G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54470-54478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein extracts were resolved on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide denaturing gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, blocked, incubated with primary antibody, washed, incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and washed, and immunoreactive bands were detected using a chemiluminescent Western blot detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Both Pan-Lamin and FKBPN1 were generous gifts from Dr. Allan Fields (Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville) and Dr. K. I. Nakayama (Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan), respectively; all other antibodies were purchased from sources as indicated: monoclonal HA antibody 12CA5 (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA), monoclonal Bcl-2 10C4, polyclonal Bcl-2 N19, polyclonal IκBα (FL) (secondary 1:2500) (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA), polyclonal Bcl-2 554087 (BD Pharmingen), calnexin polyclonal SPA-860 (Stressgen Biotechnologies, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada), monoclonal enhanced green fluorescence protein antibody (Clontech, Mountain View, CA), monoclonal β-actin AC-15 (secondary 1:50,000) (Sigma). All horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Bio-Rad and used at 1:7500 unless stated otherwise. Performed as described previously (34Portier B.P. Ferrari D.C. Taglialatela G. J Neurosci. Methods. 2006; 155: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Briefly, for non-nuclear proteins, cells were lysed in hypotonic lysis buffer and centrifuged. The resulting nuclear pellet was further purified as described under nuclear proteins section below. The supernatant was transferred to a new 1.5-ml tube and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant from this second centrifugation (non-nuclear protein) was transferred to a new 1.5-ml tube, and the protein concentration in each sample was measured using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). For nuclear proteins, after isolation of the nuclear pellet (as described above), nuclei were lysed in 50 μl of SDS lysis buffer (5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, and 2% SDS) and disrupted by sonication for 15 s. Protein concentration was determined in each sample using the standard bicinchoninic acid protein assay. Isolation of nuclei was performed as previously described (34Portier B.P. Ferrari D.C. Taglialatela G. J Neurosci. Methods. 2006; 155: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in hypotonic lysis buffer, and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended, layered on a 1.8 m sucrose cushion, and ultracentrifuged. Centrifuged nuclear pellets were re-suspended in PBS and centrifuged. Pelleted nuclei were then resuspended in appropriate assay buffer and utilized for further analysis. Isolated nuclei were resuspended in Vecta-shield hard mount fluorescent mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and mounted on 1.5 borosilicate round cover glass (Fisher). Mounting medium was allowed to set at room temperature in the dark for 2 h. Slides were then stored at 4 °C in the dark until imaging. Images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM510 META advanced laser scanning confocal microscope with laser excitations at 351, 364, 457, 477, 488, 514, 543, and 633 nm. Differential interference contrast and fluorescent imaging analysis was performed using Meta-morph imaging software V.6.0 (Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA). Cells were plated between 40 and 50% confluency into 12-well plates. After 24 h of recovery cells were transiently transfected. 24-48 h post-transfection these cells were washed 3 times with PBS (pH 7.4) then resuspended in 500 μl of annexin binding buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm CaCl2). 100 μl of this suspension (1 × 105 cells) was removed to a new 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube. 6 μl of annexin-Vallophycocyanin (APC) (BD Pharmingen) was added to each tube and gently mixed. Tubes were incubated at room temperature for 15 min. After incubation, 400 μl of annexin binding buffer (containing 1 ng/ml propidium iodide (PI)) was added to each tube. Samples were gently mixed, placed on ice, and analyzed by flow cytometry within 60 min. Flow cytometry was performed on a BD Biosciences Canto with excitations of 488 and 633 nm. Emission wavelengths detected included >530 nm (YFP), 660 nm (allophycocyanin), and 670 nm (PI). Data analysis was performed using WinMDI 2.8 software program (written by Joseph Trotter, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) and FCS express V3 (De Novo Software, Los Angeles, CA). Apoptosis detection by physical light scatter was carried out as previously described in detail (34Portier B.P. Ferrari D.C. Taglialatela G. J Neurosci. Methods. 2006; 155: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclei were collected after transient transfection by hypotonic lysis and sucrose gradient purification. The highly purified nuclei were resuspended in propidium iodide stain solution. After staining, nuclei were analyzed via flow cytometry to detect forward scatter, side scatter, YFP fluorescence (excitation 488 nm, emission 530 nm) and propidium iodide fluorescence (excitation 488 nm, emission >590 nm). Data analysis was performed using WinMDI 2.8 software program (written by Joseph Trotter, Scripps Research Institute) and FCS express V3 (De Novo Software, Los Angeles, CA). PC12 cells grown in 75-cm2 flasks were washed 3 times with PBS and solubilized in 400 μl of ice-cold immunoprecipitation buffer (1% Nonidet P-40 in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, including the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), aprotinin (10pg/ml), and leupeptin (10pg/ml)) by gentle rocking for 1 h at 4°C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. All immunoprecipitation steps were performed at 4 °C. HA Pulldown—HA pulldown was performed according to manufacture's instructions (Profound HA immunoprecipitation kit, Pierce). Briefly, protein extracts (800 μg) were incubated with agarose-coupled HA antibody rotating overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted from the beads using elution buffer, gel loading buffer was added, and samples were heated at 100 °C for 5 min. Bcl-2-mediated Agarose A/G Pulldown—Protein extracts (800 μg) were incubated with primary antibody Bcl-2 N19 (8 μl) with agarose A/G beads (50 μl). Samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C, and subsequently each immunoprecipitation was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 min and washed 3 times with ice-cold immunoprecipitation buffer and once with PBS (pH 7.4). For SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the immunoprecipitated proteins, agarose A/G beads were heated at 100 °C for 5 min in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis buffer (each 100 ml of buffer contained 3 g of Tris, 8 g of SDS, 2.5g dithiothreitol, 0.05g bromphenol blue, 40% (v/v) glycerol). PC12 cells were transiently transfected with HA-FKBP38 construct for 24 h as described above. Cells were lysed in nondenaturing lysis buffer, and total cell proteins were collected. Immunoprecipitation was performed using a HA antibody pulldown (Profound HA immunoprecipitation kit, Pierce), 800 μg of total protein, and 2 ng/μl BH4 or BH4 scramble peptide. After an overnight incubation rotating at 4 °C, proteins were eluted and utilized for polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After immunoprecipitation and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, gels were stained using GelCode (Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, gels were washed 3 times with deionized water for 15 min. After washes, gels were incubated with ∼50 ml of GelCode (for 8.3 × 7.3 cm gel) for 1 h. After staining, gels were rinsed three times with deionized water and then incubated overnight in water at room temperature. After an overnight wash, stained gels were placed on a light box, and digital images were taken using UVP 12bit monochrome digital Chemi HR camera (UVP, Upland, CA). Experiments were performed in triplicate (intra-assay variability). Final results were statistically evaluated on the average calculated of the three independent replicate experiments. Statistical differences between groups were assessed using Student's t test. An α level below 5% (p < 0.05) between groups was considered statistically significant. Apoptosis Induction after Transient Expression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-2ΔBH4—Rat PC12, human HeLa, mouse B104, and human HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with YFP, Bcl-2/YFP, or Bcl-2ΔBH4/YFP. After transient transfection, cells were stained with annexin-V and propidium iodide and analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells expressing the transfected constructs, as determined by YFP fluorescence, were gated (R1), and the degree of apoptosis specifically in the R1 population was determined by assessing the number of cells that were simultaneously annexin-V-positive and propidium iodide-negative (Fig. 1A) (see supplemental Fig. 1 for an example of R1 gating). Analyses performed on three independent experiments revealed that all cell lines assayed underwent a significant degree of apoptosis upon transient transfection of Bcl-2/YFP or Bcl-2ΔBH4/YFP as compared with cells transfected with the YFP control vector. Western blot analysis detecting Bcl-2 in total protein extracts from non-transfected PC12, HeLa, B104, and HEK293 cells revealed different degrees of endogenous Bcl-2 expression in these cell lines, with the highest expression in HeLa cells and levels below the limit of detection in PC12 cells (Fig. 1B). Because induction of apoptosis by transient expression of exogenous Bcl-2 seemed not to be restricted to any specific cell line and was independent of endogenous Bcl-2 expression, we elected to focus our subsequent studies on PC12 cells. Next, we determined whether the fusion protein Bcl-2/YFP used in these experiments retained function similar to wild type Bcl-2. To test this, PC12 cells stably expressing either Bcl-2 or Bcl-2/YFP were exposed to serum withdrawal or staurosporine treatment. Both of these apoptosis-inducing stimuli have been shown to be attenuated by stable, mitochondrial compartment-localized Bcl-2 in PC12 cells (7Hunter J.J. Bond B.L. Parslow T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 877-883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Maroto R. Perez-Polo J.R. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 514-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Both stably expressed wild type Bcl-2 and Bcl-2/YFP provided significant protection from cell death after 24 h of serum withdrawal or 24 h of treatment with staurosporine (supplemental Fig. 2A). In addition, both stably expressed Bcl-2 and Bcl-2/YFP shared a non-nuclear subcellular localization (supplemental Fig. 2B). Nuclear Localization of Bcl-2 or Bcl-2ΔBH4 Is Associated with a Significant Increase in Apoptosis—The representative Western blot shown in Fig. 2A compares the subcellular distribution of exogenously expressed Bcl-2 and Bcl-2ΔBH4 after either transient or stable transfection. Although transiently expressed Bcl-2 localized to both nuclear and non-nuclear fractions, transiently expressed Bcl-2ΔBH4 solely localized within the nuclear fraction. Conversely, stably expressed Bcl-2 was predominately found in the non-nuclear protein fraction, whereas expression of Bcl-2ΔBH4 in the non-nuclear fraction was not detected after long-term growth in selection medium. Purity of nuclear and non-nuclear fractions was confirmed by re-probing with antibodies specific for nuclear and non-nuclear proteins (IκBα for cytosolic, Pan Lamin for nuclear, and calnexin for ER) (Fig. 2A). Although satisfactory separation of nuclear from non-nuclear fractions was confirmed, the small degree of calnexin identified in the nuclear fraction was expected since the ER is contiguous with the outer nuclear envelope (35Voeltz G.K. Rolls M.M. Rapoport T.A. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 944-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) and our method of nuclei isolation preserves the outer nuclear membrane (34Portier B.P. Ferrari D.C. Taglialatela G. J Neurosci. Methods. 2006; 155: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Fig. 2B shows representative confocal photomicrographs of nuclei isolated from PC12 cells transiently transfected with either Bcl-2/YFP or Bcl-2ΔBH4/YFP. These isolated nuclei showed a perinuclear association of Bcl-2 and Bcl-2ΔBH4, indicating that nuclear Bcl-2 is retained through the process of nuclei isolation. To investigate the extent of apoptosis in cells bearing Bcl-2 and Bcl-2ΔBH4 at the nuclear compartment, we employed a technique recently developed by us whereby flow cytometry-based analysis of physical light scattering properties (forward versus side scatter) is used to determine apoptotic status of isolated nuclei (34Portier B.P. Ferrari D.C. Taglialatela G. J Neurosci. Methods. 2006; 155: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Using this new technique coupled wit"
https://openalex.org/W2023150899,"Increasingly a number of proteins important in the regulation of bone osteoclast development have been shown primarily influence osteoclastogenesis under conditions of physiologic or pathologic stress. Why basal osteoclastogenesis is normal and how these proteins regulate stress osteoclastogenic responses, as opposed to basal osteoclastogenesis, is unclear. LIM proteins of the Ajuba/Zyxin family localize to cellular sites of cell adhesion where they contribute to the regulation of cell adhesion and migration, translocate into the nucleus where they can affect cell fate, but are also found in the cytoplasm where their function is largely unknown. We show that one member of this LIM protein family, Limd1, is uniquely up-regulated during osteoclast differentiation and interacts with Traf6, a critical cytosolic regulator of RANK-L-regulated osteoclast development. Limd1 positively affects the capacity of Traf6 to activate AP-1, and Limd1–/– osteoclast precursor cells are defective in the activation of AP-1 and thus induction of NFAT2. Limd1–/– mice, although having normal basal bone osteoclast numbers and bone density, are resistant to physiological and pathologic osteoclastogenic stimuli. These results implicate Limd1 as a potentially important regulator of osteoclast development under conditions of stress.

These results implicate Limd1 as a potentially important regulator of osteoclast development under conditions of stress. Vertebrate bone development and homeostasis requires the exquisite balance between the bone resorptive capacity of osteoclasts and bone forming capacity of osteoblasts. Perturbation of this equilibrium can have pathologic consequences. For example, pathologic bone loss, as occurs in osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Paget disease of the bone, and tumor metastasis to bone represents enhanced net osteoclastic activity. Alternatively, defective osteoclastogenesis can lead to increased bone mass or osteopetrosis. These pathologies can result from enhanced or inhibited osteoclast development, altered osteoclast function without change in number of osteoclasts, or both.The extent of bone resorption is directly related to the control of osteoclast differentiation. Osteoclasts derive from bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) 3The abbreviations used are: BMDM, bone marrow-derived macrophage; TRAF, TNF receptor-associated factor; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T cells; PTH, parathyroid hormone; aPKC, atypical protein kinase C; FHL2, four and one-half LIM domains 2; M-CSF, macrophage colony-stimulating factor; RANK-L, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TNFR, tumor necrosis factor receptor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; PKC, protein kinase D; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TRAP, tartrate resistant acid phosphatase; preOC, prefusion osteoclast precursors; OC, osteoclast; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; WT, wild type. 3The abbreviations used are: BMDM, bone marrow-derived macrophage; TRAF, TNF receptor-associated factor; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T cells; PTH, parathyroid hormone; aPKC, atypical protein kinase C; FHL2, four and one-half LIM domains 2; M-CSF, macrophage colony-stimulating factor; RANK-L, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TNFR, tumor necrosis factor receptor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; PKC, protein kinase D; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TRAP, tartrate resistant acid phosphatase; preOC, prefusion osteoclast precursors; OC, osteoclast; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; WT, wild type. under the influence of macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANK-L), and incompletely understood co-stimulatory factors acting through immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif-containing receptors to give rise to large, motile, multinucleated, terminally differentiated osteoclasts (1Boyle W.J.

Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 2004; 14: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Other RANK-L-related inflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα and interleukin-1β, also influence osteoclastogenesis and function, either independently or in synergy with RANK-L (4Kwan Tat S. Padrines M. Theoleyre S. Heymann D. Fortun Y. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2004; 15: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Whereas M-CSF is thought to largely provide a survival/proliferative signal to macrophage precursor cells, RANK-L signals are critical for osteoclast differentiation (1Boyle W.J. Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Nature. 2003; 423: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (4806) Google Scholar).The cellular receptor for RANK-L, RANK, is a member of the TNFR superfamily that includes the interleukin-1 receptor and Toll-like receptors (5Dunne A. O'Neill L.A. Sci. STKE. 2003; 2003: re3Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Like other TNFRs, RANK recruits adapter proteins after ligand-induced multimerization. A central family of such adapters is the TNF receptor-associated factors or TRAFs. RANK binds multiple TRAFs but only Traf6 has been shown to be critical for osteoclast development and function (6Lomaga M.A. Yeh W. Sarosi I. Duncan G.S. Furlonger C. Ho A. Morony S. Capparelli C.

Nature. 2002; 418: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). TRAFs share a common C-terminal TRAF domain that serves to localize TRAFs to their target proteins and results in oligomerization of the N-terminal effector domain leading to the activation of IKK, NF-κB, the MAPKs (particularly JNK and p38), and AP-1 (9Arch R.H.

Recently, Traf6 was also found to form a complex with the atypical PKC-interacting adapter protein p62 in osteoclasts (aPKC-p62-Traf6 complex), and this complex was shown to be important for the activation of NF-κB by RANK-L (12Duran A.

The importance of p62 to bone physiology is evident as mutations in p62 have been identified in a group of patients with 5q35-linked Paget disease (13Laurin N. Brown J.P. Morissette J. Raymond V. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 70: 1582-1588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), and deletion of the p62 gene in mice results in normal basal bone structure but inhibited osteoclastogenic response to parathyroid hormone (PTH) challenge (12Duran A.

Cell. 2004; 6: 303-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar).The NF-κB and AP-1 transcriptional complexes are particularly critical for osteoclast development (14Wagner E.F. Matsuo K. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2003; 62: ii83-ii85PubMed Google Scholar, 15Franzoso G. Carlson L. Xing L. Poljak L. Shores E.W. Brown K.D. Leonardi A. Tran T. Boyce B.F. Siebenlist U.

AP-1 synergizes with the nuclear factor of activated T cells, NFAT1 (or NFATc2), and transcription factor to induce transcription of NFAT2 (or NFATc1) (17Ikeda F. Nishimura R. Matsubara T. Tanaka S.

Whereas there is abundant genetic evidence demonstrating the importance of AP-1 and NF-κB component proteins in the regulation of osteoclastogenesis (for review see Ref. 14Wagner E.F. Matsuo K. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2003; 62: ii83-ii85PubMed Google Scholar), it is still not completely understood how RANK-L-induced Traf6 activation leads to the activation of these transcriptional complexes.LIM domains are unique protein-protein interacting modules found in multiple proteins throughout all cellular compartments. The Ajuba/Zyxin family are cytosolic, complex LIM proteins that associate with cellular cytoskeletal components particularly at sites of cell adhesion where they can regulate cell-cell adhesion and migration (20Marie H.

Longmore G.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4010-4022Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Within this family Ajuba is most closely related to Limd1. LIMD1 was originally identified as a gene present at chromosome locus 3p21 in humans (26Kiss H. Kedra D. Yang Y. Kost-Alimova M. Kiss C. O'Brien K.P. Fransson I. Klein G. Imreh S. Dumanski J.P. Hum.

We found that the expression of Limd1 is uniquely regulated during osteoclast differentiation, interacts with Traf6, and affects the ability of Traf6 to activate AP-1. Limd1–/– mice, although having normal basal bone osteoclast numbers and bone density, are resistant to physiological and pathologic osteoclastogenic stimuli. We discuss the potential role of Limd1 as a positive regulator of Traf6 activity, only during states of osteoclastogenic stress.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies and Protein Purification—Mouse Limd1 cDNA was PCR amplified from a mouse kidney cDNA library, sequenced, and subcloned. The full-length protein and the N-terminal PreLIM region were cloned into pBacPAK9 containing a His6-FLAG tag (HF-PreLIM), baculovirus generated, and proteins purified from infected Sf9 cells using Talon metal affinity resin (Clontech). Polyclonal rabbit antiserum was raised against the purified PreLIM peptide and partially purified by mixing with purified HF-PreLIM peptide charged to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Ajuba antiserum has previously been described (20Marie H. Pratt S.J. Betson M. Epple H. Kittler J.T. Meek L. Moss S.J. Troyanovsky S. Attwell D. Longmore G.D. Braga V.M. J. Biol.

Traf6 mouse monoclonal, and NFAT2, c-Jun, c-Fos, and Traf6 rabbit polyclonal antibodies were from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). M2AG (mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody immobilized on agarose), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal anti-FLAG, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal anti-Myc, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal anti-HA antibodies were all from Sigma. Phospho-ERK, ERK1, phospho-JNK, JNK1, phosphor-p38, p38, and phospho-c-Jun rabbit polyclonal antibodies were all from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Nucleophosmin antibodies were from J. Weber (Washington University). p65 RelA antiserum was from Oncogene Research Products (San Diego, CA).In Vivo Bone Analyses—Bone mineral density (BMD) was determined in male mice, 6–7 weeks of age, by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry using a PIXCImus2 scanner (Lunar Corp., Madison, WI). Seven-week-old female mice were injected subcutaneously every 6 h for 3 days with 10 μg of hPTH peptide-(1–34) (Bachem, King of Prussia, PA). Animals were sacrificed 24 h after the last PTH injection. GST and GST-RANK-L were prepared, as described (29McHugh K.P. Hodivala-Dilke K. Zheng M.H. Namba N. Lam J. Novack D. Feng X. Ross F.P. Hynes R.O. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Eight to 10-week-old mice were subcutaneously injected daily for 7 days at the base of the skull with 100 μg of GST or GST-RANK-L, then sacrificed. In both instances following sacrifice calvariae were isolated, fixed overnight in 10% neutral buffered formalin, and decalcified in 14% EDTA for 4–5 days. Following sample dehydration, paraffin-embedded sections were prepared and stained for TRAP with a hematoxylin counterstain. Histomorphometric analysis of osteoclast number per millimeter of trabecular surface and percent surface covered by osteoclasts were measured and analyzed using Osteomeasure (OsteoMetrics, Atlanta, GA) in a blinded fashion. Three to four calvaria slices per mouse were analyzed and statistics performed with the unpaired Student's t test. K/BxN serum (200 μl, intraperitoneally) was injected into 8-week-old mice on days 1 and 4. On day 7 clinical evidence for ankle inflammation was assessed and ankle swelling measured. Mice were sacrificed and ankles and feet prepared for histological analysis. Serum was also obtained on day 7 and levels of type I collagen C-terminal fragments determined, as described by manufacturer (Nordic Biosciences, Denmark).Bone Marrow Macrophage Isolation and Osteoclast Differentiation—Primary BMDM were extracted from femora and tibia of 6–8-week-old mice and cultured overnight in α-10 medium (lipopolysaccharide-free α-minimal essential medium containing 10% inactivated fetal bovine serum). Nonadherent cells were collected by centrifugation and re-plated in fresh α-10 medium containing 1/10 volume of CMG 14–12 culture supernatant (which was equivalent to 130 ng/ml of recombinant M-CSF) for 4 days. Fresh media and M-CSF were supplemented every other day. For osteoclast differentiation cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, lifted, and reseeded at 1.5 × 106 cells/10-cm dish, in osteoclast differentiation medium (α-10 medium containing 10 ng/ml M-CSF and 100 ng/ml of recombinant RANK-L). Media was changed every other day. TRAP+ mononuclear prefusion osteoclast precursors (preOCs) are present after 3 days of differentiation, whereas TRAP+ mature, terminally differentiated, multinucleated osteoclast cells (OCs) are produced after 5 or 6 days in culture. TRAP staining was performed as described by the manufacturer (Sigma).Osteoclast Bone Matrix Resorption Assay—BMDM were plated on synthetic calcium matrices (BD Biosciences), and allowed to differentiate in the presence of 100 ng/ml RANK-L and 10 ng/ml MM-CSF for 10 days. Cells were removed with a bleach solution and calcium matrix washed 3 times with water. Resorption pits were analyzed by phase-contrast microscopy and the total area of bone resorption was determined using the Metamorph program (Molecular Devices).Retroviral Production and Macrophage Transduction—Full-length mouse Limd1 was cloned into the pMX-IRES-Bsr retrovirus vector (30Onishi M. Nosaka T. Misawa K. Mui A.L. Gorman D. McMahon M. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3871-3879Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), and transiently transfected into Plat-E packaging cells (31Morita S. Kojima T. Kitamura T. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar) using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche). Virus was collected 48 h after transfection. BMDMs were infected with virus for 24 h in the presence of M-CSF and 4 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). Cells were then selected in the presence of M-CSF and 1 μg/ml blasticidin (Calbiochem) for 3 days.Subcellular Fractionation—Subconfluent cultures of BMDMs, preOCs, or OCs were starved of serum, M-CSF, and RANK-L in α-minimal essential medium for 6 h, then stimulated with RANK-L (100 ng/ml). Cell fractionation (nuclear, cytosolic, and total cell lysates) was performed as described (25Feng Y. Longmore G.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4010-4022Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined with Bio-Rad protein assay kit. For Western blots, 5 μg of nuclear extract or 25 μg of cytosolic or total cell lysate were loaded in each lane.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blots—For immunoprecipitation cells were harvested, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed with IP buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture from Sigma). Extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min. For each IP, cell extract proteins were mixed with primary antibody or preimmune serum on ice for 2 h, and then incubated with 25 μl of protein AG/slurry (1:1, v/v) overnight with gentle rotation at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed five times with IP buffer, and boiled in SDS-loading buffer. After SDS-PAGE, under reducing conditions, products were transferred to nitrocellulose ECL membrane and subjected to Western blot analysis with ECL detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences).Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—DNA oligos were labeled with biotin at the 5′ ends during synthesis, annealed, and purified as described (25Feng Y. Longmore G.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4010-4022Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). 3 μg of nuclear extract were mixed with EMSA binding buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KC1, 2.5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 0.2 nm NF-κB or AP-1 binding site to a final volume of 20 μl and kept at room temperature for 30 min. The mixture was then subjected to 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Biotin complex signals were developed with the Pierce kit following the manufacturer's instruction. Oligos used were: NF-κB, 5′-biotin-AAGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGCT-3′ and 5′-biotin-AGCCTGGGAAAGTCCCCTCAACTT-3′ and AP-1, 5′-biotin-ACGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAAT-3′ and 5′-biotin-ATTCCGGCTGAGTCATCAAGC-3′.Luciferase Assay—HEK293T cells (6 × 104 cells/well) were transfected with pAP-1-luciferase (0.025 μg/well, Stratagene), pTK-Renilla luciferase (0.025 μg/well, Promega), pcDNA3-Flag-Limd1 isoforms (0.1 μg/well), and pcDNA3-Flag-Traf6 (0.1 μg/well). Total plasmid amount was balanced to 0.25 μg/well with pcDNA3-Stop-Limd1 (stop codon after the ATG start site) or pcDNA3, as needed. Forty-eight hours post-transfection cells were lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer (Promega) and firefly and Renilla luciferase activity was determined using substrates from Promega and a luminometer.RESULTSLimd1 Associates with Traf6—LIMD1 was found to interact with the atypical PKC interacting adapter protein p62/sequestosome in a yeast two-hybrid protein-protein interactive screen (25Feng Y.

BMDM were isolated from wild type adult mice, expanded in M-CSF, and then induced to differentiate into osteoclasts by adding RANK-L. At each of 6 days in cultures containing M-CSF and RANK-L, total cell protein extracts were prepared and the level of Limd1 protein determined by quantitative Western blot. BMDM were found to express low levels of Limd1 protein (Fig. 1), but during RANK-L-induced osteoclast differentiation Limd1 protein levels significantly increased (Fig. 1). This occurred, in part, at the level of transcriptional regulation as reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis revealed an increase in Limd1 mRNA during osteoclast differentiation (data not shown). The induced expression of Limd1 protein during osteoclast differentiation was similar to previously reported induced expression of Traf6 (12Duran A. Serrano M. Leiyges M. Flores J.M. Picard S.

Likewise, the level of other related LIM proteins: Wtip, Zyxin, and Lpp, did not fluctuate significantly during osteoclast differentiation (data not shown). These results indicated that of the Ajuba/Zyxin LIM protein family Limd1 protein expression was uniquely up-regulated during osteoclast differentiation, and thus, might contribute to osteoclast development and bone homeostasis.When bone osteoclast progenitors are stimulated with RANK-L, p62 assembles into a multiprotein complex containing Traf6 and atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) (12Duran A.

HEK293T cells were co-transfected with epitope-tagged plasmids expressing Limd1 and Traf6, Limd1 was immunoprecipitated, and bound products Western blotted for the presence of Traf6. Limd1 was found to associate with Traf6 (Fig. 2A). Mapping studies identified the C-terminal LIM region as directing the interaction of Limd1 with Traf6 (Fig. 2A). The N-terminal PreLIM region of Limd1 did not interact with Traf6 (Fig. 2A). The association of Limd1 with Traf6 was specific, as related LIM proteins LPP and Zyxin did not co-immunoprecipitate with Traf6 (Fig. 2B), nor did Traf2 interact with Limd1 (data not shown).FIGURE 2Limd1 interacts with Traf6. A, a representation of the modular organization of Limd1. The C-terminal LIM region is comprised of three LIM domains, whereas the PreLIM region is the N-terminal end of the protein. HEK293T cells were transiently co-transfected with myc-Traf6, full-length FLAG-Limd1, FLAG-PreLIM region, or FLAG-LIM region as indicated. Limd1 isoforms were immunoprecipitated (anti-FLAG) and bound products Western blotted for the presence of Traf6 (anti-myc) and Limd1 (anti-FLAG). Input controls are shown on the right panels. B, HEK293 cells were transiently co-transfected with FLAG-Traf6, myc-tagged Lpp, Zyxin, or Limd1. Traf6 was immunoprecipitated (anti-FLAG) and bound products Western blotted for the presence of bound LIM protein (anti-myc) and Traf6 (anti-FLAG). Input controls are shown in the third and fourth lanes of each panel. C, Limd1+/+ or Limd1–/– BMDM were differentiated to form preOCs, cells were lysed, and endogenous Limd1 immunoprecipitated. Bound products were Western blotted for the presence of Traf6, p62, PKCζ, and Limd1. Input controls are shown in the third and fourth lanes. D, aliquots of purified His-FLAG-tagged Limd1 (HF-LIMD1), purified GST, and GST-Traf6 were run on SDS-PAGE and the gel Coomassie stained (lower panel). Control GST (lane 1) or GST-Traf6 (lane 2) proteins were mixed with HF-Limd1. Glutathione-agarose beads were added, pelleted, washed, and bound products incubated with Prescission enzyme to cleave Traf6 from GST. The final reaction was then run on SDS-PAGE and Western blotted for Limd1 and Traf6. Input controls are shown in the third and fourth lanes. In the second lane both cleaved Traf6 and uncleaved GST-Traf6 are present. E, p62 does not affect the amount of Traf6 associated with Limd1.

Using a direct radioactive copper incorporation assay in transfected cells and the established tools of single crystal x-ray diffraction, we now demonstrate that this variant does not stably bind copper. We find that single mutations at copper ligands, including H46R, H48Q, and a quadruple mutant H46R/H48Q/H63G/H120G, also diminish the binding of radioactive copper. Further, using native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and a yeast two-hybrid assay, the binding of copper was found to be related to the formation of the stable dimeric enzyme.

Each subunit of the mature homodimeric SOD1 enzyme binds one atom of copper and one atom of zinc and contains a single oxidized disulfide bond between Cys-57 and Cys-146 (11Hartz J.W. Deutsch H.F. J.

Tainer J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6109-6113Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Because copper can participate in many types of potentially deleterious reactions, the role of the copper cofactor of SOD1 in the toxicity associated with mutant protein has been intensely studied (for review see Refs. 4Hart P.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2006; 10: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar and 14Valentine J.S. Hart P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3617-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). To dissect the role of copper in the toxicity of mutant SOD1, we have examined the impact of mutations of the four histidine residues that are the primary copper ligands of the enzyme. Two of the four histidine residues that coordinate copper have been documented as targets of natural FALS mutations; His-46 to Arg and His-48 to Gln (www.alsod.org). Both of these mutants are almost completely devoid of superoxide-scavenging activity (15Ratovitski T. Corson L.B. Strain J. Wong P. Cleveland D.W. Culotta V.C. Borchelt D.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1451-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Combining these two mutations into one protein produces a molecule that also lacks demonstrable activity but retains high toxicity to motor neurons (16Wang J. Xu G. Gonzales V. Coonfield M. Fromholt D. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Borchelt D.R. Neurobiol. Dis. 2002; 10: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Additional substitutions at the two other copper ligands (His-63 to Gly and His-120 to Gly), eliminate the copper-binding ligands, generating a protein that remains capable of inducing motor neuron disease in transgenic mice (17Wang J. Slunt H. Gonzales V. Fromholt D. Coonfield M. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Borchelt D.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 2753-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Studies of SOD1-H46R suggest that this single mutation interferes with copper binding (18Elam J.S. Taylor A.B. Strange R. Antonyuk S. Doucette P.A. Rodriguez J.A. Hasnain S.S. Hayward L.J.

Hayward L.J. Valentine J.S. Hart P.J. Hasnain S.S. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 1201-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), whereas the H48Q mutant can be made to bind copper in the correct site, although with an altered coordination geometry (20Liochev S.I. Chen L.L. Hallewell R.A. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 346: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The copper-binding abilities of H46R/H48Q or SOD1-Quad are also predicted to be severely compromised, but this has not yet been demonstrated experimentally. To fill this gap in knowledge, we here study copper binding of four SOD1 variants, H46R, H48Q, H46R/H48Q, and H46R/H48Q/H63G/H120G (Quad), using a direct radioactive copper incorporation assay. In transfected cell models, we show that none of these variants possess high affinity for copper. We also use single crystal x-ray diffraction to examine directly the copper binding site of SOD1-H46R/H48Q protein expressed in yeast and isolated by standard non-denaturing biochemical methods. This analysis reveals that the H46R/H48Q mutant protein does not bind copper in either of the metal-binding sites of the protein. We also noted that mutation of copper ligands correlated with reduced ability to form stable dimers, using native gel electrophoresis and a yeast two-hybrid assay. We interpret these findings as evidence that the loss of copper-binding His ligands in SOD1 reduces the stable binding of copper, and that the lack of such binding may underlie the inability of these mutants to mature into stable dimeric enzymes. We note that nearly all of SOD1-H46R/H48Q or SOD1-Quad proteins found in spinal cord tissues display an electrophoretic migration pattern of monomeric enzyme, suggesting that the poor incorporation of copper in these mutants also occurs in spinal cord tissues.

Cells were labeled in Opti-Mem (Invitrogen) containing 50 μCi/ml 64Cu for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed, harvested, and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.6) containing protease inhibitors. The lysate, 100 μg, was mixed with Laemmli sample buffer (final SDS concentration 1%) (22Laemmli U.K. Nature (Lond.). 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and electrophoresed on a non-reducing 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS. Samples were not heated prior to electrophoresis. The gel was exposed to PhosphorImager plates (Amersham Biosciences) overnight; plates were analyzed in the instrument as described by the manufacturer. For SOD1 immunoblot, the gel from the copper labeling study was transferred at 400 mA for 1 h then blocked in 5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline with Tween-20 (standard protocol, Pierce Biotechnology). Primary α-SOD1 antibody (SOD1 100, Stressgen Bioreagents Corp.-Nventa Biopharmaceuticals Corp., San Diego, CA) at 1:5,000 was incubated overnight at 4 °C.

First, each of the 10 different mutants, and the wild-type cDNAs, were fused to the LexA DNA-binding domain of the bait-fusion protein (plasmid pEG202 between EcoR1 and BamH1 sites). Wild-type SOD1 cDNA was cloned into the target plasmid pJG4-5 between EcoR1 and XhoI sites located at 3′ of the activation domain. Bait plasmids were transformed into the EGY48 strain of yeasts, and the target plasmid was transformed into the mating strain RFY206. Before mating, yeasts harboring the bait constructs were screened for sufficient expression of the bait-fusion protein to repress transcription of a reporter gene in the plasmid pJK101 encoding β-galactosidase under the transcriptional control of a constitutive promoter interrupted by the LexA operator. Yeast cells were cultured on media containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal, Sigma-Aldrich). For each bait construct, we identified three or four independent yeast clones that were white; indicating complete repression of β-galactosidase expression. Low expression of β-galactosidase in each colony was verified by liquid assay. This approach established that each clone expressed the bait-fusion protein at levels sufficient to saturate the DNA-binding site recognized by the LexA domain of the fusion protein. Each of the three clones harboring the bait-fusion and reporter constructs were then made ready for mating to the RFY206 yeast strain (harboring the SOD1-wt target fusion proteins) by culturing the yeast on media containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (Sigma-Aldrich). The pJK101 repressor-reporter plasmids utilize URA-3 as the selectable marker gene, allowing the use of media containing 5-fluoroorotic acid to force the segregation of the bait-fusion constructs and the reporter construct (URA-3 is an enzyme in the uracil biosynthetic assay, which acts upon 5-fluoroorotic acid to produce a toxin). Only cells that have lost the repressor-reporter construct will grow. Again, three independent colonies were isolated, and these clones were screened by growth on media lacking uracil to ensure loss of pJK101 plasmid. These strains were then mated to SOD1-wt/RFY206 yeast that also harbored a plasmid (pSH18-34) encoding β-galactosidase behind a promoterless LexA DNA-binding domain. Initially, yeast cells harboring all three constructs were selected solely on the basis of selectable-marker genes within the plasmids. Again, three independent clones were isolated and cultures of yeast harboring both genes were then grown for lysis and liquid assay of β-galactosidase activity. Yeast cells were lysed mechanically, and the total amount of protein in each lysate was measured by a BCA kit (Pierce). The liquid assay contained a colorimetric substrate, 2-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, at a concentration of 0.67 mg/ml, and lysate from ∼1 × 106 cells or 0.2 A600 units. Reactions were incubated at 28 °C for 15 min before absorbance was read by A420 on a standard spectrophotometer (Amersham Biosciences). Structure Determination of SOD1-H46R/H48Q—The H46R/H48Q double mutant protein was expressed in yeast, purified, and characterized as previously described (28Doucette P.A. Whitson L.J. Cao X.

Chem. 2004; 279: 54558-54566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) with the addition of a DEAE-Sephadex chromatography step between the hydrophobic interaction chromatography and gel-filtration column steps. The metal content of the double mutant prior to crystallization screens was determined using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Crystals suitable for x-ray diffraction work were grown by the hanging drop, vapor-diffusion method. H46R/H48Q SOD1 at 26 mg/ml in 2.25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, was mixed with a precipitating solution consisting of 20% polyethylene glycol 1000, 0.1 m phosphate, pH 6.2, 0.2 m NaCl at 25 °C. Hexagonal plates appeared within 2 months. A suitable specimen was flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen using mother liquor made 20% (w/v) in polyethylene glycol 400 as a cryoprotectant. Diffraction data were gathered at beam line 4.2.2 at the Advanced Light Source, Berkeley, CA. All diffraction data were processed using the program d*TREK (29Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1718-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). The structure was determined by molecular replacement using the program MOLREP (30Vagin A. Teplyakov A. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1622-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). A monomer of human G37R SOD1 (31Hart P.J. Liu H. Pellegrini M. Nersissian A.M. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) was used as the search model. Crystallographic refinement was performed initially in CNS (32Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) and, in later stages, in SHELX-97 (33Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1892) Google Scholar). The program COOT (34Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar) was used for manual adjustment of the molecular models. Previous studies had established that natural pathogenic mutations at histidines 46 (H46R) and 48 (H48Q) drastically reduce enzyme activity (15Ratovitski T. Corson L.B. Strain J. Wong P. Cleveland D.W. Culotta V.C. Borchelt D.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1451-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, combining the H46R/H48Q mutations into one variant or adding experimental mutations H63G/H120G did not restore activity (16Wang J. Xu G. Gonzales V. Coonfield M. Fromholt D. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Borchelt D.R. Neurobiol. Dis. 2002; 10: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 17Wang J. Slunt H. Gonzales V. Fromholt D. Coonfield M. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Borchelt D.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 2753-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). However, whether any of these mutants stably bind copper has not been directly assayed. In previous work, we demonstrated that SOD1-H46R/H48Q is relatively stable, inactive, and capable of inducing motor neuron disease in transgenic mice (16Wang J. Xu G. Gonzales V. Coonfield M. Fromholt D. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Borchelt D.R. Neurobiol. Dis. 2002; 10: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). To examine the copper-binding site of this mutant, purified protein was crystallized and analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Analysis of the copper- and zinc-binding sites of the double mutant superimposed on SIGMAA electron density contoured at 1.5 σ demonstrated that the mutations preclude copper ion binding at the copper site without spurious binding in the zinc site (Fig. 1). This observation agrees with data obtained from inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry on the protein sample prior to crystallization, which returned values of 0.05 equivalents of copper and 1.5 equivalents of zinc, per dimer. To assess copper binding by these variants, and others, in mammalian cells, we used a cell transfection model to express high levels of mutant SOD1 in CHO cells. 48 h after transfection, cells were incubated with 64Cu, then lysed in buffers with non-ionic detergent and chromatographed on non-reducing, non-denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gels, containing 0.1% SDS and standard Laemmli buffers (22Laemmli U.K. Nature (Lond.). 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), before exposure to PhosphorImager plates (21Bartnikas T.B. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33602-33608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cells transfected with human SOD1-wt expression plasmids contained abundant levels of radiolabeled homodimer enzyme, whereas in cells transfected with the H46R, H48Q, H46R/H48Q, or Quad variants, the only labeled protein evident was the endogenous CHO protein (Fig. 2A). Because these gels allow for assay of crude cell lysates and because there are currently no radioactively labeled forms of zinc that are available to us, whether any of the proteins visualized on these gels contain zinc could not be determined. Thus apo/holo designation refers to the absence/presence of copper only, respectively, here and throughout this report. To confirm expression of the mutant proteins and to determine the relative position of migration in these gels, after exposure to the PhosphorImager plates, the gels were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The only SOD1 found in the lysates of cells transfected with the histidine mutants displayed an electrophoretic migration consistent with the previously reported electrophoretic migration of monomeric SOD1 (21Bartnikas T.B. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33602-33608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 35Malinowski D.P. Fridovich I. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which migrates much faster than the holo, dimeric enzyme (also see supplemental Fig. S2). Note the lack of 64Cu labeling (in Fig. 2A) at positions on the gel corresponding to the position of the four histidine variants (Fig. 2B). To further address the effect of FALS mutations on dimer interactions, we developed a yeast two-hybrid assay to measure interactions between mutant and wild-type subunits. The variants tested included the four histidine variants described above as well as the A4V mutant, which has been reported to be prone to monomerization (24Ray S.S. Nowak R.J. Strokovich K.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4899-4905Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and the G37R, G85R, G93A, and I113T mutants, which we have previously established to form stable active dimers (5Borchelt D.R.

The assay involved two steps described in detail under “Experimental Procedures.” In the first step, yeast cells were transfected with plasmids that harbor the bait fusion constructs (each mutant cDNA fused to a LexA DNA-binding domain) and a reporter plasmid to assess the stable expression of the bait-fusion protein. Three independent yeast clones showing complete repression of reporter transcription were isolated for each bait-fusion construct. This assay established that the expression of the various bait proteins was at a level sufficient to saturate binding of the promoter elements of reporter constructs. Each of these clones was then cultured in selection media to screen for segregation of the bait-fusion constructs and the repression-reporter construct. Three independent clones for each were isolated and cultured in media to confirm loss of the reporter construct. In the second step, these strains were mated to yeast harboring the targetfusion construct (SOD1-wt/transcriptional activator domain) and a promoterless β-galactosidase reporter plasmid before selection solely on the basis of selectable-marker genes within the plasmids. Assays for β-galactosidase activity in yeast lysates revealed significant variation in the strength of bait-target fusion interaction to promote β-galactosidase production (Fig. 3). The wt, G37R, G85R, G93A, and I113T bait-fusion constructs showed strong activation of β-galactosidase synthesis. Whereas, the A4V construct, and all variants harboring mutations at copper-binding histidines, showed very poor activation of β-galactosidase production (Fig. 3). Given the apparent correlation between mutation of copper ligand residues and loss of stable homodimer interactions, we prepared extracts of spinal cords from transgenic mice that express wt, G37R, G85R, G93A, H46R/H48Q, and Quad variants of human SOD1. These extracts were then electrophoresed on native gels for SOD1 activity assay (5Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Guarnieri M. Xu Z.-S. Wong P.C. Brown Jr., R.H. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S.

PSK interacts with PSKR1 in a highly specific manner with a nanomolar dissociation constant. However, it is not known which residues in the PSKR1 extracellular domain constitute the ligand binding pocket. Here, we have identified the PSK binding domain of carrot PSKR1 (DcPSKR1) by photoaffinity labeling. We cross-linked the photoactivatable PSK analog [125I]-[Nϵ-(4-azidosalicyl)Lys5]PSK with DcPSKR1 using UV irradiation and mapped the cross-linked region using chemical and enzymatic fragmentation. We also established a novel “on-column photoaffinity labeling” methodology that allows repeated incorporation of the photoaffinity label to increase the efficiency of the photoaffinity cross-linking reactions. We purified a labeled DcPSKR1 tryptic fragment using anti-PSK antibodies and identified a peptide fragment that corresponds to the 15-amino-acid Glu503-Lys517 region of DcPSKR1 by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Deletion of Glu503-Lys517 completely abolishes the ligand binding activity of DcPSKR1. This region is in the island domain flanked by extracellular LRRs, indicating that this domain forms a ligand binding pocket that directly interacts with PSK.

Cell-to-cell communication is essential for growth and development of multicellular organisms throughout their life. In plants, hormones, including small lipophilic compounds and secreted peptides, comprise a large group of signaling molecules that are central to intercellular communication. They elicit biological activity by binding to cell surface receptors that have kinase activity or by directly interacting with intracellular proteins. Phytosulfokine (PSK) 2The abbreviations used are: PSK, phytosulfokine; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; RK, receptor kinase; DcPSKR1, Daucus carota phytosulfokine receptor 1; MALDI-TOF MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry; KD, kinase domain; ID, island domain; ASA-PSK, [Nϵ-(4-azidosalicyl)Lys5]PSK; TPCK, l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone; BR, brassinosteroid. is a 5-amino-acid-secreted peptide that has been identified in the medium of plant cell cultures, based on the results of assays of the growth-promoting activity of cultured cells (1Matsubayashi Y. Sakagami Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7623-7627Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The addition of chemically synthesized PSK to culture medium, even at nanomolar concentrations, significantly promotes the proliferation of callus and suspension cells. PSK also promotes tracheary element differentiation (2Matsubayashi Y. Takagi L. Omura N. Morita A. Sakagami Y. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 1043-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), somatic embryogenesis (3Kobayashi T. Eun C. Hanai H. Matsubayashi Y. Sakagami Y. Kamada H. J. Exp.

Plant Res. 1998; 111: 453-458Crossref Google Scholar), and pollen germination in vitro (7Chen Y.F. Matsubayashi Y. Sakagami Y. Planta. 2000; 211: 752-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). PSK is produced from ≈80-amino-acid precursor peptides via post-translational sulfation of tyrosine residues and proteolytic processing (8Yang H. Matsubayashi Y. Nakamura K. Sakagami Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13560-13565Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Genes encoding PSK precursors are redundantly distributed in the genome and are expressed in cultured cells and in a variety of tissues, including leaves, stems, flowers, and roots (9Yang H. Matsubayashi Y. Nakamura K. Sakagami Y. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 842-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 10Matsubayashi Y. Ogawa M. Kihara H. Niwa M. Sakagami Y. Plant Physiol. 2006; 142: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). PSK binds the membrane-localized PSK receptor PSKR1, which is a leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase (LRR-RK) that has been purified from solubilized carrot microsomes by ligand-based affinity chromatography (hereafter referred to as DcPSKR1) (11Matsubayashi Y. Ogawa M. Morita A. Sakagami Y. Science. 2002; 296: 1470-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The extracellular domain of DcPSKR1 contains 21 tandem copies of LRR interrupted by a 36-amino-acid island domain rich in hydrophilic and charged amino acid residues. Disruption or overexpression of the Arabidopsis ortholog of PSKR1 (AtPSKR1) significantly alters cellular longevity and potential for growth without interfering with primary morphogenesis of plants (10Matsubayashi Y. Ogawa M. Kihara H. Niwa M. Sakagami Y. Plant Physiol. 2006; 142: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). PSK appears to activate the basic potential for cellular growth rather than directly determining cell fate and thereby exerts a pleiotropic effect on individual cells in response to environmental hormonal conditions. Ligand binding generally causes a receptor protein to undergo a conformational change that directly activates the receptor so that it can interact with another cellular molecule and/or exert intrinsic enzyme activities such as kinase activity. PSK interacts with DcPSKR1 in a highly specific manner, with a high affinity dissociation constant of Kd = 4.2 nm (11Matsubayashi Y. Ogawa M. Morita A. Sakagami Y. Science. 2002; 296: 1470-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). However, it is not known which amino acids in the DcPSKR1 extracellular domain constitute the ligand binding pocket. Photoaffinity labeling is one of the most useful methods for analyzing ligand-receptor interactions. Identification of the labeled amino acid residues can yield valuable information about the ligand binding domain of the receptor. However, it is often quite difficult to identify the cross-linked residues by MS analysis due to the low efficiency of cross-linking reactions. These difficulties are further compounded by low concentrations of binding proteins, especially in the case of transmembrane receptors and channels that cannot be functionally overexpressed in bacteria. In fact, most known cross-linked regions of membrane-localized proteins have been identified by analyzing chemical and enzymatic fragmentation patterns of labeled proteins using radioactive photoaffinity ligands rather than direct MS analysis of purified peptide fragments cross-linked with photoaffinity ligands (12Bixel M.G. Weise C. Bolognesi M.L. Rosini M. Brierly M.J. Mellor I.R. Usherwood P.N. Melchiorre C. Hucho F. J. Biol.

In the present paper, we have reported identification of the PSK binding site of DcPSKR1 by SDS-PAGE mapping of the cross-linked fragments generated by chemical and enzymatic fragmentation of the photoaffinity-labeled ligand-receptor complex and by direct analysis of the purified cross-linked fragments by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). We have also reported the usefulness of a novel solid-phase photoaffinity labeling technology, “on-column photoaffinity labeling,” which allows repeated incorporation of a photoaffinity label to increase the efficiency of the photoaffinity cross-linking reactions. Vector Construction and Transformation of Tobacco BY-2 Cells—For construction of plasmids pBI121-DcPSKR1-His6 and pBI121-DcPSKR1-ΔKD-His6, PCR was performed using primers PSKR-5f (5′-GCtctagaATTTGCCTTGTTTTGTTGAGC-3′) and PSKR-3r (5′-CTAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGACTACTGACATCAATGTTTTCGAGCC-3′) for DcPSKR1-His6, using primers PSKR-5f and PSKR-3t (5′-CTAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGACTGCTAGTGGATTTCAAAATGTC-3′) for DcPSKR1-ΔKD-His6 (His6 coding regions are underlined; restriction sites are in lowercase), and using DcPSKR1 cDNA as a template. The amplified fragments were digested with XbaI and inserted into the binary vector pBI121, which had been digested with XbaI and SacI (blunted). For the construction of plasmid pBI121-DcPSKR1-ΔID[Glu503-Lys517], the PCR-ligation-PCR method was used (15Ali S.A. Steinkasserer A. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 746-750PubMed Google Scholar). Two independent PCRs were performed 1) using primers PSKR-5f and DcR1ID-3e (5′-GGAGACAAGGCTCTGTAAACTGG-3′) and 2) using primers DcR1ID-5e (5′-AAAAACACAAATGCCGGAGG-3′) and PSKR-3p (5′-AATGACAGGACAATGCTAACTACTGACATC-3′). The two PCR products were then phosphorylated and blunt-ligated. A second series of PCRs were performed to amplify the ligated DcPSKR1-ΔID[Glu503-Lys517] using primers PSKR-5f and PSKR-3p. Finally, the product was purified, digested with XbaI, and inserted into the binary vector pBI121, which had been digested with XbaI and SacI (blunted). For construction of pBI121-DcPSKR1-ΔID[Lys518-Ile538], two independent PCRs were performed 1) using primers PSKR-5f and DcR1ID-3d (5′-TTTTTTCTTGAAAAATGGAAAATCTGG-3′) and 2) using primers DcR1ID-5d (5′-ATAGACCTTAGTTATAATTCCCTCAATGG-3′) and PSKR-3p. The PCR products were phosphorylated, blunt-ligated, and subjected to a second PCR using primers PSKR-5f and PSKR-3p. The products were purified, digested with XbaI, and inserted into the binary vector pBI121. The resultant recombinant plasmids were used to transform Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58C1 (pMP90) using electroporation. Tobacco BY-2 cells were co-cultivated with Agrobacterium for 2 days, and the resultant transformed BY-2 cells were selected on modified MS agar medium containing 200 mg/liter kanamycin and 500 mg/liter carbenicillin for 3–4 weeks until transformed cells were formed (16An G. Plant Physiol. 1985; 79: 568-570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Selected cell lines were transferred into MS liquid medium containing 100 mg/liter kanamycin to initiate suspension culture and were used for subsequent analysis. Transgenic BY-2 cells were maintained in both liquid and solid culture by subculturing once a week. Ligand Binding Assay—The ligand binding assay of plant microsomal fractions and affinity-purified DcPSKR1 was performed using [3H]PSK and following a protocol described previously (11Matsubayashi Y.

Solubilized materials were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were applied to a [Lys5]PSK-Sepharose column (5.0-ml column) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min using the AKTA prime chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences) (11Matsubayashi Y. Ogawa M. Morita A. Sakagami Y. Science. 2002; 296: 1470-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). After washing with 50 ml of buffer containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100 (wash buffer), the column was eluted with 15 ml of buffer containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 500 mm KCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100 (elution buffer). The eluates were added to a 1.0-ml Macro-Prep ceramic hydroxyapatite Type I column (Bio-Rad) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at 4 °C. The column was washed with 20 ml of wash buffer and eluted with an 18-ml gradient of KH2PO4 (0–400 mm) in wash buffer. Aliquots of active fractions (1.0 ml), as determined by [3H]PSK binding assay, were concentrated by ultrafiltration (Ultra-free-MC MWCO 30,000; Millipore) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 7.5% gels for confirmation of purity. Protein bands in SDS-polyacrylamide gels were visualized using the fluorescent dye SYPRO Red (Molecular Probes). The immunoblot of the active fraction (20 μl) was probed with anti-DcPSKR1 antibodies raised against the DcPSKR1 100-amino-acid N-terminal region (11Matsubayashi Y. Ogawa M. Morita A. Sakagami Y. Science. 2002; 296: 1470-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) and was visualized using ECL Advance (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. PNGase F Treatment of Purified DcPSKR1-ΔKD-His6—Affinity-purified DcPSKR1-ΔKD-His6 (10 μl) was added to PNGase F buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.6) and 0.1% SDS and was incubated at 95 °C for 3 min. The denatured sample was then incubated with 2 milliunits of peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F; TakaraBio, Shiga, Japan) in the presence of Nonidet P-40 (1.0% final solution) at 37 °C for 16 h at a total volume of 25 μl. After deglycosylation, samples were mixed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, as described above. Preparation of Photoactivatable Analog of PSK—Preparation of the photoactivatable PSK analog [Nϵ-(4-azidosalicyl)Lys5]PSK (ASA-PSK) and radioactive [125I]ASA-PSK was performed as previously described (18Matsubayashi Y. Sakagami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15520-15525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The specific radioactivity of [125I]ASA-PSK was estimated to be 210 Ci/mmol. In-solution Photoaffinity Labeling—Aliquots of purified DcPSKR1-ΔKD-His6 (10 μl) were incubated with 1 μm [125I]ASA-PSK for 10 min at 4 °C. Thereafter, the samples were irradiated with a UV lamp (model ENF-260C/J, 365 nm; Spectronics Co. Ltd., NY) for 10 min on ice at a distance of <1 cm. SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to each of the samples, which were then heated at 95 °C for 5 min. The samples were loaded onto NuPage 12% BisTris gel (Invitrogen) and separated according to the manufacturer's protocol. The dried gels were exposed to a bio-imaging plate (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) for 16 h at room temperature and were analyzed using a bio-imaging analyzer (BAS 2000, Fujifilm). Chemical Cleavage and Protease Digestion—[125I]ASA-PSK-labeled DcPSKR1-ΔKD-His6, with or without PNGase F treatment, was used for chemical cleavage and protease digestion. Cyanogen bromide (CNBr) cleavage of cross-linked proteins (100 μl) was performed in 75% formic acid containing 0.5 mg/ml CNBr under a nitrogen atmosphere. After this solution was incubated for 16 h at room temperature, it was diluted 10-fold with distilled water and lyophilized. For trypsin digestion, 10 μl of labeled DcPSKR1-ΔKD-His6 was treated with 100 pmol of TPCK-treated trypsin (Sigma) in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 10 mm CaCl2 and 10% CH3CN (v/v) at 37 °C for 16 h at a total volume of 20 μl. For Asp-N digestion, 10 μl of labeled DcPSKR1-ΔKD-His6 was treated with 100 pmol of endoproteinase Asp-N (TakaraBio, Shiga, Japan) in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) at 37 °C for 16 h at a total volume of 20 μl. All of these samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using the NuPage 12% BisTris gel and autoradiography. On-column Photoaffinity Labeling and Trypsin Digestion—Affinity-purified DcPSKR1-ΔKD-His6 (9 ml) was immobilized on Ni2+-loaded HiTrap chelating HP-Sepharose (bed volume 200 μl; Amersham Biosciences) by recycling three times. After the column was washed with 1 ml of the above-described wash buffer, 1 ml of 10 nm [125I]ASA-PSK or 1 μm cold ASA-PSK (dissolved in the wash buffer) was loaded onto the column, which was then left to stand for 5 min for ligand binding. After the column was washed with 600 μl of the wash buffer to remove unbound ligand, the bound ligand was cross-linked to DcPSKR1-ΔKD-His6 by directly irradiating the column with UV light (365 nm) for 10 min. Uncross-linked ligand was removed by washing the column with 1 ml of the wash buffer, and the labeling cycle was then repeated up to 3 times for [125I]ASA-PSK and 10 times for ASA-PSK. For trypsin digestion, labeled DcPSKR1-ΔKD-His6 on Sepharose was suspended in 200 μl of digestion buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 10 mm CaCl2, and 10% CH3CN in a total volume and was then digested by 100 pmol of TPCK-treated trypsin (Sigma) at 37 °C for 16 h. Sepharose was then removed by filtration, and liberated peptides were used for the following analysis. Gel Filtration of the Labeled Tryptic Peptides—Gel filtration analysis was performed using Sephadex G-25 Superfine (1.5 cm inner diameter × 35 cm; Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Column equilibration and chromatography were performed using buffer containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.0) and 150 mm NaCl. On-column tryptic digests of [125I]ASA-PSK-labeled DcPSKR1-ΔKD-His6 (200,000 counts/min eq.) were applied to the column, and 1.0-ml fractions were analyzed for radioactivity using an autowell γ system (ALOKA). Blue dextran (Amersham Biosciences) and cyanocobalamin were used for molecular mass calibration. Immunoaffinity Purification of the Labeled Tryptic Peptides—For the purification of the anti-PSK antibodies, anti-PSK antiserum (5 ml) (19Matsubayashi Y. Morita A. Matsunaga E. Furuya A. Hanai N. Sakagami Y. Planta. 1999; 207: 559-565Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar) was loaded onto a [Lys5]PSK-Sepharose column (1.0-ml column). After the antiserum was recycled three times, the column was washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the bound antibodies were then eluted with 0.1% formic acid (pH 2.6) and immediately neutralized with NaHCO3. Purified antibodies were coupled with HiTrap NHS-activated HP-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 16 h at 4 °C. The immobilized anti-PSK antibodies were stored in phosphate-buffered saline until use. On-column tryptic digests of ASA-PSK-labeled DcPSKR1-ΔKD-His6 were incubated at 95 °C for 10 min to inactivate trypsin and were then loaded onto the immunoaffinity column (20-μl column). After the column was washed with 200 μl of the trypsin digestion buffer and 200 μl of distilled water, bound fragments were eluted with 1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v). The eluate was used for MALDI-TOF MS analysis. MALDI-TOF MS Analysis—The eluate from the immunoaffinity column was concentrated by evaporation, desalted using Zip Tip C18™ pipette tips (Millipore), and mass-profiled with a 4700 proteomics analyzer (Applied Biosystems) using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as the matrix. A pulsed nitrogen laser (337 nm) was used to induce desorption/ionization, and mass spectra were obtained using the reflector mode. Each representative mass spectrum shown in the present figures was the smoothed average of 100,000 laser shots. Overexpression of DcPSKR1 in Tobacco BY-2 Cells—To obtain the relatively large amount of DcPSKR1 protein required for the direct identification of the PSK binding domain by photoaffinity labeling, we first overexpressed DcPSKR1 in BY-2 suspension cells, which grow rapidly and can be harvested weekly. For DcPSKR1 expression, BY-2 cells were transformed using two constructs, 35S::DcPSKR1-His6, as a positive control for functional expression of full-length DcPSKR1 in heterologous cells, and the 35S::DcPSKR1-ΔKD-His6 construct, in which the coding region for the kinase domain of DcPSKR1 had been removed (Fig. 1A). The latter construct was used to test whether the extracellular domain of DcPSKR1 is sufficient for interaction with PSK. The His6 tag was introduced to immobilize these proteins on the nickel column to perform on-column photoaffinity labeling (described below). Northern blot and immunoblot analysis of the membrane fractions of each transformed BY-2 cell clone revealed that both DcPSKR1-His6 and DcPSKR1-ΔKD-His6 proteins were successfully overexpressed in BY-2 cells (Fig. 1B). Both proteins migrated, with apparent molecular sizes of 150 and 120 kDa, respectively. The theoretical molecular masses of these proteins, without the signal sequence, are 110.2 and 78.8 kDa, respectively, indicating that both proteins are post-translationally modified by the addition of an ∼40-kDa moiety, most likely by glycosylation. The ligand binding assay using [3H]PSK confirmed a significant increase in PSK binding activity in the membrane fractions derived from both transformants, compared with fractions derived from untransformed BY-2 cells (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that DcPSKR1 is functionally expressed in BY-2 cells and that the intracellular kinase domain of DcPSKR1 is not essential for PSK binding. Scatchard analysis of the binding of [3H]PSK to membranes expressing DcPSKR1-ΔKD-His6 showed that the dissociation constant (Kd) of DcPSKR1-ΔKD-His6 is 2.1 ± 0.3 nm, which is comparable with that of wild-type DcPSKR1 (4.2 ± 0.4 nm) (Fig. 1D) (11Matsubayashi Y. Ogawa M. Morita A. Sakagami Y. Science. 2002; 296: 1470-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Because this truncated DcPSKR1 lacks the kinase domain, and therefore theoretically yields fewer peptide fragments after chemical and/or enzymatic digestion, we used DcPSKR1-ΔKD-His6 in the following experiments. Purification and Photoaffinity Labeling of DcPSKR1-ΔKD-His6—We purified DcPSKR1-ΔKD-His6 protein from solubilized microsomal fractions derived from transgenic BY-2 cells using [Lys5]PSK-Sepharose and hydroxyapatite column chromatography. The relative expression level of DcPSKR1-ΔKD-His6 protein was estimated to be 190 fmol/mg microsomal proteins based on Scatchard analysis. SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified fractions confirmed that DcPSKR1-ΔKD-His6 protein had been recovered at relatively high purity (Fig. 1E, left panel). After the PNGase F treatment, the apparent molecular mass of DcPSKR1-ΔKD-His6 changed from 120 to ∼110 kDa, indicating that at least 10 kDa of the presumed 40-kDa post-translationally added moiety is composed of N-linked glycans (Fig. 1E, right panel). It has been reported that α1,3-fucosylated glycans, which are often found in N-linked glycans in plants, are resistant to PNGase F treatment (20Altmann F. Schweiszer S. Weber C. Glycoconj. J. 1995; 12: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Incubation of the purified DcPSKR1-ΔKD-His6 with 10 nm [125I]ASA-PSK (photoaffinity ligand) (Fig. 2A), followed by cross-linking by UV irradiation, resulted in specific labeling of the 120-kDa band that corresponds to DcPSKR1-ΔKD-His6. The incorporation of [125I]ASA-PSK into the 120-kDa band was completely abolished by the presence of excess unlabeled PSK, indicating specific cross-linking between [125I]ASA-PSK and DcPSKR1-ΔKD-His6 (Fig. 2B). Chemical Fragmentation and Enzymatic Digestion of [125I]ASA-PSK-labeled DcPSKR1-ΔKD-His6—Extracellular domain of DcPSKR1 contains 21 LRRs with a 36-amino-acid island domain between the 17th and 18th LRR. To roughly map the cross-linked region within DcPSKR1-ΔKD-His6, we chemically and enzymatically fragmented the [125I]ASA-PSK-labeled protein and estimated the apparent molecular size of the radioactive fragments. Treatment of labeled DcPSKR1-ΔKD-His6 with CNBr, which cleaves polypeptides at the N-terminal of Met residues (21Gross E. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 238-255Crossref Scopus (759) Google Scholar), and subsequent analysis by SDS-PAGE revealed a labeled 45-kDa polypeptide (Fig. 2B). After the PNGase F treatment, the apparent molecular mass of this band changed from 45 to ∼35 kDa, indicating that a 10-kDa N-linked glycan moiety is attached to this fragment. After tryptic digestion of this band, MALDI-TOF MS analysis showed a signal at m/z 1752.8, which corresponds to Glu503-Lys517, indicating that this fragment contains the island domain (data not shown). Because the presence of the Met-Thr sequence causes conversion of Met to homoserine without cleavage, we speculated that the 45-kDa polypeptide (35 kDa after PNGase treatment) corresponds to the Pro295-Met537 fragment (Fig. 2C). We confirmed that both of the two Met-Thr sequences within DcPSKR1-ΔKD-His6 are resistant to CNBr treatment, using bacterially expressed recombinant DcPSKR1-ΔKD-His6 (data not shown). The theoretical molecular size of this fragment is 26.6 kDa, indicating that it contains several post-translationally added moieties that are resistant to PNGase F treatment. Digestion of labeled DcPSKR1-ΔKD-His6 by endoproteinase Asp-N, which cleaves polypeptides at the N-terminal of Asp residues (five sites within the Pro295-Met537 fragment) yielded fast migrating labeled peptides with an approximate size of 5 kDa, with or without PNGase F treatment (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the cross-linking site is in the C-terminal region of the CNBr fragment (Fig. 2C). In contrast, the labeled fragment obtained by trypsin digestion (18 sites within Pro295-Met537 fragment) was no longer detectable on the gel, indicating that the molecular size of the labeled fragment was <3.5 kDa (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that the cross-linking site is confined to one tryptic fragment within the island domain. The most likely location of the cross-linking site in DcPSKR1-ΔKD-His6 is the region Glu503-Lys517 (Fig. 2C). On-column Photoaffinity Labeling of DcPSKR1-ΔKD-His6—To confirm the location of the cross-linking site of ASA-PSK by mass spectrometry, we performed large scale photoaffinity labeling followed by trypsin digestion. The main difficulty in identifying photoaffinity-labeled peptide fragments contained in the complex enzymatic digests of the labeled protein is that the relative abundance of the labeled fragment is extremely low due to the low efficiency of the photoaffinity cross-linking reaction. To overcome this limitation, we established a novel oncolumn photoaffinity labeling methodology that allows repeated incorporation of the photoaffinity label. We immobilized DcPSKR1-ΔKD-His6 on nickel-chelating HiTrap™ HP-Sepharose beads using a His6 tag and performed solid-phase photoaffinity labeling in a transparent narrow column by directly irradiating the column with UV light (365 nm). The crucial advantage of the on-column photoaffinity labeling is that the cross-linking reaction can be repeated after washing out the uncross-linked ligands that act as potential competitors of the newly added ligands in the next round of photoaffinity reaction. In addition, this system allows direct buffer exchange without dialysis upon enzymatic digestion. We repeated sequential on-column photoaffinity labeling three times and confirmed the significant increase in cross-linking of [125I]ASA-PSK to immobilized DcPSKR1-ΔKD-His6 (Fig. 3A). We also confirmed that labeled DcPSKR1-ΔKD-His6 can be successfully digested by trypsin even if it is immobilized on nickel-chelating beads (Fig. 3A). Released labeled fragment was no longer detectable on SDS-PAGE after trypsin digestion, confirming that its molecular size was <3.5 kDa. To gain more information about the molecular size of the labeled tryptic fragment, we chromatographed the tryptic digest of labeled DcPSKR1-ΔKD-His6 on a gel filtration column. Autowell γ counting of each fraction revealed the presence of two clear peaks (Fig. 3B). High pressure liquid chromatography analysis of the larger peak fraction showed that radioactivity was not retained on the reverse-phase column, suggesting that the radioactive molecule contained in this fraction was free 125I rather than labeled fragments (data not shown). Based on the separation range of Sephadex G-25 (Mr 5000–800) and the elution profiles of blue dextran (marker for V0) and cyanocobalamin (marker for molecular mass separation, Mr 1355), the apparent molecular size of the labeled peptide contained in the smaller peak was estimated to be between 1.5 and 5 kDa. Together with the data from the SDS-PAGE of the labeled tryptic peptide, we estimated the apparent molecular size of the labeled fragment to be between 1.5 and 3.5 kDa. Immunoprecipitation and MALDI-TOF MS Analysis of the Labeled Peptide—To directly detect the peptide fragment cross-linked with ASA-PSK using MALDI-TOF MS, we purif"
https://openalex.org/W2048602769,"Nix, a pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein, promotes apoptosis of non-neuronal cells, although the mechanisms involved remain incompletely understood. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen with POSH (plenty of SH3 domains, a scaffold involved in activation of the apoptotic JNK/c-Jun pathway) as the bait, we identified an interaction between POSH and Nix. Co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro binding studies confirmed a direct interaction between POSH and Nix in mammalian cells. When overexpressed in HEK293 cells, Nix promotes apoptosis along with enhanced phosphorylation/activation of JNKs and their target c-Jun. These effects appear to be dependent on POSH because Nix does not promote either JNK/c-Jun phosphorylation or apoptosis of 293 cells that do not express POSH. Nix and POSH appear to mutually stabilize one another and this effect could contribute to their promotion of death. Past work showed induction of Nix transcripts in a cellular model of Parkinson disease based on neuronal PC12 cells exposed to 6-hydroxydopamine. Here, we confirm elevation of Nix protein in this model and that Nix over-expression causes apoptotic death of PC12 cells by a mechanism dependent on c-Jun activation. Expression of s-Nix, a dominant-negative form of Nix, protects neuronal PC12 cells from 6-hydroxydopamine but not from nerve growth factor deprivation. These results indicate that Nix promotes cell death via interaction with POSH and activation of the JNK/c-Jun pathway and that Nix protein is induced and contributes to cell death in a cellular model of Parkinson disease."

https://openalex.org/W1974442662,"The marine parasitic protozoon Perkinus marinus synthesizes the polyunsaturated fatty acid arachidonic acid via the unusual alternative Delta8 pathway in which elongation of C18 fatty acids generates substrate for two sequential desaturations. Here we have shown that genes encoding the three P. marinus activities responsible for arachidonic acid biosynthesis (C18 Delta9-elongating activity, C20 Delta8 desaturase, C20 Delta5 desaturase) are genomically clustered and co-transcribed as an operon. The acyl elongation reaction, which underpins this pathway, is catalyzed by a FAE1 (fatty acid elongation 1)-like 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase class of condensing enzyme previously only reported in higher plants and algae. This is the first example of an elongating activity involved in the biosynthesis of a polyunsaturated fatty acid that is not a member of the ELO/SUR4 family. The P. marinus FAE1-like elongating activity is sensitive to the herbicide flufenacet, similar to some higher plant 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthases, but unable to rescue the yeast elo2Delta/elo3Delta mutant consistent with a role in the elongation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. P. marinus represents a key organism in the taxonomic separation of the single-celled eukaryotes collectively known as the alveolates, and our data imply a lineage in which ancestral acquisition of plant-like genes, such as FAE1-like 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthases, occurred via endosymbiosis. The P. marinus FAE1-like elongating activity is also indicative of the independent evolution of the alternative Delta8 pathway, distinct from ELO/SUR4-dependent examples."
https://openalex.org/W2013640615,"UvsW protein belongs to the SF2 helicase family and is one of three helicases found in T4 phage. UvsW governs the transition from origin-dependent to origin-independent replication through the dissociation of R-loops located at the T4 origins of replication. Additionally, in vivo evidence indicates that UvsW plays a role in recombination-dependent replication and/or DNA repair. Here, the biochemical properties of UvsW helicase are described. UvsW is a 3′ to 5′ helicase that unwinds a wide variety of substrates, including those resembling stalled replication forks and recombination intermediates. UvsW also contains a potent single-strand DNA annealing activity that is enhanced by ATP hydrolysis but does not require it. The annealing activity is inhibited by the non-hydrolysable ATP analog (adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate)), T4 single-stranded DNA-binding protein (gp32), or a small 8.8-kDa polypeptide (UvsW.1). Fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments indicate that UvsW and UvsW.1 form a complex, suggesting that the UvsW helicase may exist as a heterodimer in vivo. Fusion of UvsW and UvsW.1 results in a 68-kDa protein having nearly identical properties as the UvsW-UvsW.1 complex, indicating that the binding locus of UvsW.1 is close to the C terminus of UvsW. The biochemical properties of UvsW are similar to the RecQ protein family and suggest that the annealing activity of these helicases may also be modulated by protein-protein interactions. The dual activities of UvsW are well suited for the DNA repair pathways described for leading strand lesion bypass and synthesis-dependent strand annealing.

With the exception of host cell RNA polymerase, bacteriophage T4 supplies all the proteins necessary for the replication and repair of its 169-kilobase linear genome (1Miller E.S. Kutter E. Mosig G. Arisaka F. Kunisawa T. Ruger W. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 86-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar).

On the other hand, very little is known about the biochemical properties of UvsW helicase. The majority of the functional information regarding UvsW comes from in vivo experiments studying the effects of UvsW loss-of-function mutants alone or in combination with other gene knockouts (6Wakem L.P. Zahradka C.L. Ebisuzaki K. Virology. 1984; 137: 338-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 7Derr L.K. Kreuzer K.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 643-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 8Woodworth D.L. Kreuzer K.N. Genetics. 1996; 143: 1081-1090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Through these in vivo experiments, the Kreuzer laboratory (9Carles-Kinch K. George J.W. Kreuzer K.N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4142-4151Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that UvsW regulates the initiation of DNA replication from T4 origins and plays a role in recombination and/or DNA repair. T4 phage utilizes two methods for the initiation of its replication: origin-dependent, which requires Escherichia coli RNA polymerase to synthesize a stably bound R-loop, and origin-independent, which requires the T4 proteins UvsX and UvsY to catalyze recombination between single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and homologous double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) (10Mosig G. Colowick N. Gruidl M.E. Chang A. Harvey A.J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 17: 83-98Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A controlling factor governing the transition between these two modes of initiation is the UvsW protein, which has been shown both in vitro and in vivo to dissociate R-loops from the origins of replication in T4 phage (11Dudas K.C. Kreuzer K.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2706-2715Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Partially based on this ability, UvsW has been described as a functional analog of the E. coli RecG protein. In support of this, expression of UvsW is able to complement some of the defects in RecG- E. coli (9Carles-Kinch K. George J.W. Kreuzer K.N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4142-4151Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In comparison to what is known regarding the function of UvsW in the initiation of replication, the precise role of UvsW in recombination and DNA repair is much less clear. Inactivation of the UvsW gene results in sensitivity to hydroxyurea and UV light, indicating some role in the processing of damaged DNA and stalled replication forks (12Derr L.K. Drake J.W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 222: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 13Conkling M.A. Drake J.W. Genetics. 1984; 107: 505-523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Hamlett N.V. Berger H. Virology. 1975; 63: 539-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Additionally, the inactivation of the T4 Holliday junction endonuclease (gp49) does not completely eliminate the ability of T4 phage to resolve branched DNA structures, suggesting an alternative mechanism for resolution (15George J.W. Kreuzer K.N. Genetics. 1996; 143: 1507-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Kreuzer laboratory (9Carles-Kinch K. George J.W. Kreuzer K.N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4142-4151Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) has demonstrated the ability of UvsW to unwind a three-way branched DNA substrate, strongly suggesting that UvsW is responsible for branch migration in T4 phage. However, a complete description of the biochemical properties of UvsW is lacking, making the assignment of addition roles for UvsW in DNA repair difficult. Even though there have been few in vitro studies of UvsW function, an x-ray crystal structure of a truncated UvsW mutant has been solved (Ref. 16Sickmier E.A. Kreuzer K.N. White S.W. Structure. 2004; 12: 583-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar; Fig. 1). The structure consists of one of the two predicted RecA-like domains and a putative substrate binding domain resembling a “double wing” motif (17Li N. Sickmier E.A. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. White S.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Based on this structure, a model for UvsW-catalyzed unwinding has been proposed that is consistent with previous descriptions of the “inchworm” model (18Velankar S.S. Soultanas P. Dillingham M.S. Subramanya H.S. Wigley D.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 75-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). This model relies on the two RecA-like domains to undergo alternating opening and closing structural changes while translocating on DNA. The structure of UvsW revealed that there is very little structural homology shared between RecG and UvsW outside of the RecA-like domains, leading to the suggestion that UvsW and RecG recognize their nucleic acid substrates through different mechanisms (19Singleton M.R. Scaife S. Wigley D.B. Cell. 2001; 107: 79-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 16Sickmier E.A. Kreuzer K.N. White S.W. Structure. 2004; 12: 583-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To complement the functional data from in vivo experiments and structural information from the x-ray crystallography, we have carried out biochemical experiments using purified full-length UvsW protein. We show that UvsW is a DNA-dependent ATPase that is capable of unwinding a variety of DNA/DNA and RNA/DNA substrates, with a preference for structures resembling stalled replication forks and recombination intermediates. Surprisingly, UvsW also possesses an ssDNA annealing activity that can be partially inhibited by ssDNA-binding protein (gp32) or a small 8.8-kDa polypeptide (UvsW.1). We demonstrate with fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments that that UvsW and UvsW.1 form a complex and that fusion of UvsW.1 to the C terminus of UvsW reproduces the effects of UvsW.1 addition. Based on these properties, we suggest that the biochemical properties of UvsW are most similar to the RecQ protein family and that the annealing activity of these helicases may also be modulated by interaction with other proteins. Additionally, the dual activities of UvsW are well suited for several DNA repair pathways that require both unwinding and annealing activities. [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Unlabeled ribonucleotides were purchased from Roche Applied Science. 7-Diethylamino-3-(4′-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin (CPM) was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Bacteriophage T4 gp32 were purified as described (20Yang J. Trakselis M.A. Roccasecca R.M. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49828-49838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The pGEM, pTYB3, and pet28a vectors were from Promega, New England Biolabs, and Novagen, respectively. T4 genomic DNA was obtained from Sigma. RecA protein and the chitin resin came from New England Biolabs. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of UvsW Helicase—The open reading frame encoding UvsW helicase was PCR-amplified from T4 genomic DNA using the following forward and reverse primers, respectively: 5′-GCGGCAGCCATATGGATATTAAAGTACATTTTCACGAC-3′ and 5′-GTCGGATCCCGTAAATTAACTGTTTTCATTAC-3′. The underlined sequences indicate NdeI and BamHI restriction sites, respectively, which were used to clone the PCR product into the pet28a expression vector. The pet28a vector supplies a hexahistidine tag at the N terminus of the protein, which is connected to the open reading frame of UvsW by a 10-residue amino acid linker. The vector containing the gene for UvsW was transformed into BL21 (DE3) E. coli, and a single colony was used to inoculate a 20 ml of overnight culture of Luria broth. Two liters of Luria broth in two 2-liter flasks were inoculated with 10 ml of overnight culture each and grown to an absorbance of 1.0 at 600 nm. The cells were then cooled to 18 °C, induced with 0.15 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and allowed to grow an additional 16 h before being harvested by centrifugation at 6000 × g. The harvested cell pellet was resuspended in 60 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, and 5 mm imidazole (pH 8.0) and lysed using sonication. After centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 45 min, the cell-free extract was loaded onto a nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column and washed with 50 of lysis buffer containing 40 mm imidazole followed by 50 column volumes of lysis buffer containing 40 mm imidazole and 1 m NaCl. Lysis buffer containing 100 mm imidazole eluted UvsW from the column. The eluted protein was diluted 3-fold with P11-A buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 400 mm NaCl (pH 7.5)) and loaded onto a 20-ml P11 phosphocellulose column that was pre-equilibrated in P11-A. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of the same buffer before eluting UvsW with a 0.4-1.5 m NaCl gradient. UvsW eluted at a NaCl concentration of ∼1 m. UvsW was concentrated to 10 μm using an Amicon centrifugation device and frozen in aliquots at -80 °C. Protein concentration was calculated based on an extinction coefficient of 73920 m-1 cm-1. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of UvsW.1 and UvsW/W.1 Fusion Proteins—The UvsW operon was PCR-amplified from T4 genomic DNA using the following forward and reverse primers, respectively: 5′-GATCGATACCATGGTACTAGAATTTAAACAATTTC-3′ and 5′-GGTGGTTGCTCTTCCAACAAAGCTTTCTTCTACTTC-3′. The underlined sequences indicate NcoI and SapI restriction sites, respectively, which were used to clone the PCR product into the pTYB3 expression vector. The pTYB3 vector aids in the purification of the 8.8-kDa peptide via an intein/chitin binding domain fused to the C terminus. UvsW.1 was expressed in Bl21 (DE3) cells in an identical fashion as UvsW. The harvested cell pellet was resuspended in 60 ml of 20 mm Tris acetate, 500 mm sodium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.8) and lysed using sonication. After centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 45 min, the cell-free extract was loaded onto a 5-ml chitin column and washed overnight with 2 liters of 20 mm Tris acetate, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.8). After the wash, the column was resuspended in 20 ml of lysis buffer containing 75 mm β-mercaptoethanol and incubated at 4 °C for 24 h to facilitate intein mediated cleavage. After cleavage, UvsW.1 was eluted from the column using lysis buffer and dialyzed into 10 mm Tris acetate, 50 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, and 20% glycerol (pH 7.8). Protein concentration was calculated based on an extinction coefficient of 3900 m-1 cm-1. The UvsW/W.1 fusion was constructed by performing QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis on the pTYB3-UvsW operon vector using the following forward primer (reverse primer is the reverse-complement of forward): 5′-CGT AAT GAA AAC AGT TAA TTT AAT AAG CTT CGG CCC TTT GGA G-3′. The mutation was confirmed using dideoxy sequencing. The fusion protein was purified essentially as described for UvsW.1 with an additional phosphocellulose column (P11) carried out in an identical fashion as that of UvsW. Protein concentration was determined using the same extinction coefficient as UvsW. Labeling of UvsW.1 with 7-Diethylamino-3-(4′-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin—UvsW.1 was extensively dialyzed into labeling buffer (20 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl (pH 7.0), and diluted to a concentration of 20 μm before labeling with a 20-fold excess of CPM for 2 h at room temperature. The reaction (1 ml) was quenched with 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol and dialyzed against four 1-liter changes of labeling buffer. Labeling efficiency was ∼95%, as determined by the protein/label ratio. DNA Constructs—Oligonucleotide substrate specificity studies were performed using various combinations of the following primers: P1, 5′-CATCATGCAGGACAGTCGGATCGGAGTCAGATTTACTGTGTCATATAGTACGTATTCAGT-3′; P2, 5′-TAACGTATTCAAGATACCTCGTACTCTGTACTGACTCCGATCCGACTGTCCTGCATGATG-3′; P3, 5′-ACTGAATACGTACTATATGACACAGTAAA-3′; P4, 5′-ACAGAGTACGAGGTATCTTGAATACGTTA-3′. The combination of oligonucleotides annealed to make the DNA substrates can be found in Table 1. All substrates were annealed before 5′ phosphorylation with [γ-32P]ATP (8000 mCi/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using polynucleotide kinase under standard conditions.TABLE 1Structures of oligonucleotide-based substrates used for DNA unwinding and strand annealing reactions Open table in a new tab The R-loop substrate (pGEM-ori) was synthesized using a supercoiled 3.53-kilobase pGEM vector containing the T4 DNA replication origin oriF (positions 114754-115284 of the T4 genome). 10 μg of the vector was treated with 50 units of T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of 0.2 mm ribonucleotide triphosphates and 10 μCi of [α-32P]CTP (3000 mCi/mmol) at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was purified using Qiagen spin columns following the manufacturer's instructions. The concentration and purity of the R-loop-containing vector was determined using a 1% agarose gel using 0.5× Tris borate EDTA as a buffer. The D-loop substrate was synthesized as described with minor modifications (21McIlwraith M.J. Hall D.R. Stasiak A.Z. Stasiak A. Wigley D.B. West S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4509-4517Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The invading oligonucleotide (300 nm), with a sequence of 5′-CGCGAATTTTAACAAAATATTAACGCTTACAATTTCCTGATGCGGTATTTTCTCCTTACGCATCTGTGCGGTATTTCAC-3′, was polynucleotide kinase-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. The oligonucleotide was diluted 10-fold and incubated in replication buffer (25 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.8), 125 mm potassium acetate, and 10 mm magnesium acetate) with 0.75 μm RecA protein for 5 min at 37 °C in the presence of 2 mm ATP, 20 mm creatine phosphate, and 2 units/ml of creatine kinase. After the preincubation period, the pGEM-ori vector was added to a concentration of 70 nm to initiate the strand invasion reaction. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 1.45 min before the addition of helicase. Nucleotide Hydrolysis Assays—Hydrolysis of triphosphate nucleotides (ATP, GTP, dATP, CTP, UTP) was monitored at 340 nm using pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase to couple the phosphorylation of nucleoside diphosphates by phosphoenolpyruvate to the oxidation of NADH to NAD+. The reactions were performed at 25 °C in complex buffer containing 0.2 mm NADH, 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 10 units of pyruvate kinase, and 5 units of lactate dehydrogenase. For nucleotide specificity, KmATP, and kcat determination, the concentration of UvsW and ssDNA M13 were 20 nm and 2 μm, respectively. Substrate specificity assays used a duplex made up of oligonucleotides P1 and P3 (substrate A in Table 1), a duplex using P4 and the complement to P4, and ssDNAs P1 and P3. The validity of the coupled assay was confirmed by a linear relationship, starting at the origin, in plots of velocity versus UvsW concentration. Initial rate data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation using IgorPro software. Fluorescence Experiments—All steady-state fluorescence experiments were carried out on an ISA FluoroMax-2 spectrofluorometer at 25 °C using slit widths of 2 nm for both excitation and emission. UvsW.1-CPM (200 nm) was mixed with UvsW (200 nm) in replication buffer. An excitation wavelength of 295 nm was used specifically to excite the tryptophan residues of UvsW. Donor (UvsW) quenching and acceptor (UvsW.1) sensitization due to fluorescence resonance energy transfer was observed over a wavelength range between 305 and 580 nm. After the addition of UvsW.1 to the solution containing UvsW, the system was allowed to come to equilibrium for a period of 20 min. A blank spectrum containing only replication buffer was subtracted from all spectra. Identical experimental conditions were employed for experiments using direct excitation of UvsW.1-CPM at a wavelength of 385 nm. Unwinding of R- and D-loop Plasmid-based Substrates—The R-loop unwinding reactions were performed in the standard replication buffer with 10 nm R-loop, 5 mm ATP, and 200 nm UvsW, UvsW/W.1, or UvsW-W.1 proteins in a total volume of 45 μl. After 30 s, an aliquot was removed from the reaction and quenched in 1 μg/μl proteinase K, 20 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, and loading buffer (25% Ficoll, 5 μg/ml xylene cyanol FF, and 4 μg/ml orange G). Reaction products were analyzed using 1% agarose gels run in 0.5× Tris borate EDTA buffer at 40 V for 16 h at room temperature. After electrophoresis, the agarose gel was dried on DE81 paper and exposed to a phosphorimaging plate overnight and analyzed using phosphorimaging. The D-loop unwinding reactions were carried out by adding UvsW, UvsW/W.1, or UvsW-W.1 (200 nm) to an ongoing RecA-catalyzed strand invasion reaction (see above). After the addition of helicase, the reactions were quenched after 30 s and treated in an identical manner as the R-loop reactions. Unwinding and ssDNA Annealing Assays Using Oligonucleotide-based Substrates—Unwinding and annealing assays were performed under identical conditions. Reactions were carried out at 37 °C in replication buffer containing 5 mm ATP (where indicated) with DNA and protein concentrations given in the figure legends. Where indicated, UvsW.1 or gp32 were added to yield final concentrations of 200 nm and 1 μm, respectively. Reactions were quenched at various time points with 1 μg/μl proteinase K, 20 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, and loading buffer (50% glycerol, 1 μg/ml bromphenol blue, 1 μg/ml xylene cyanol FF). Reaction products were analyzed using a 10% polyacrylamide gel run in 1× Tris borate EDTA buffer at 25 mA for 3 h at room temperature. Gels were exposed to a phosphorimaging plate overnight and analyzed using phosphorimaging. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of UvsW Helicase—It has been noted that there is a discrepancy in the sequence of UvsW gene (Ref. 16Sickmier E.A. Kreuzer K.N. White S.W. Structure. 2004; 12: 583-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, Fig. 2A). The UvsW operon found in the Entrez sequence data base (BAT4INH) encodes for a single 68-kDa protein, whereas the operon found in the T4 genome data base (PT4UVSWD, Tulane University) encodes for two polypeptides annotated as UvsW (58 kDa) and UvsW.1 (8.8 kDa). To determine which of these sequence entries is correct, we PCR-amplified T4 genomic DNA and sequenced the entire operon. Our results are consistent with the Tulane data base, indicating that there are indeed two separate polypeptides encoded within the UvsW operon. Due the reported poor solubility of UvsW, we cloned the open reading frame for UvsW (58 kDa) into several different expression vectors (pet28 with no tag, pet28 with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag, pet28 with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag, and pTYB3 with a C-terminal chitin binding and intein domains). Of these vectors, pet28 with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag provided soluble protein that could be easily purified. No soluble protein was recovered using the other constructs that were tested. The N-terminal His-tagged protein eluted from the nickel column containing a small amount of DNA contamination (as evidenced by an absorbance at 260 nm), which is removed by the additional phosphocellulose chromatography step (Fig. 2B). Cloning, Expression, and Purification of UvsW.1 and UvsW/W.1 Fusion Proteins—To determine whether the UvsW.1 gene is efficiently translated within E. coli, we cloned the entire operon into the pTYB3 vector. This vector supplies a C-terminal chitin binding and intein domain (CBD/intein), which allows for rapid purification of full-length protein without additional amino acids (22Chong S. Montello G.E. Zhang A. Cantor E.J. Liao W. Xu M.-Q. Benner J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5109-5115Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Because the CBD/intein is fused to the 3′-end of the operon, protein will be captured by the chitin column if UvsW.1 is expressed from the transcript. SDS-PAGE analysis indicates that the UvsW.1-CBD/intein fusion is highly expressed within E. coli (data not shown), and we were able to capture this protein with the chitin column and efficiently elute UvsW.1 at a high level of purity (Fig. 2B). To investigate the properties of a fusion between UvsW and UvsW.1 (referred to as UvsW-W.1; UvsW/W.1 indicates a mixture of two separate proteins), we removed the stop codon in the UvsW operon in the pTYB3 vector. This resulted in the overexpression of a soluble 68-kDa protein fused to the CBD/intein domain, which is captured by the chitin column and elutes normally with overnight incubation with β-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 2B). Apparently, fusion of the UvsW.1 protein to the C terminus of UvsW overcomes the solubility problems associated with expression of UvsW in isolation. Similar to UvsW, the UvsW-W.1 fusion protein also contained DNA contamination that is removed through phosphocellulose chromatography. Fluorescence Experiments—The proximity of the open reading frame for UvsW.1 to the open reading frame of UvsW suggested that these two proteins might form a complex. To test for an interaction between UvsW and UvsW.1, we labeled UvsW.1 on its only cysteine residue (Cys24) with CPM dye. UvsW.1 contains no tryptophan residues, allowing the eight tryptophan residues of UvsW to act as fluorescent donors to the CPM acceptor on UvsW.1. As shown in Fig. 3A, there is strong fluorescence resonance energy transfer between UvsW and UvsW.1 indicated by the decrease in the fluorescence of UvsW (λmax of 340 nm) and a large increase in the fluorescence of UvsW.1-CPM (λmax of 465 nm). The slight blue shift in the λmax of UvsW.1-CPM indicates that the change in fluorescence properties of the CPM dye is due to a change in environment in addition to bona fide fluorescence resonance energy transfer from UvsW. Indeed, when directly exciting the CPM dye (excitation = 360 nm), an increase in the fluorescence of UvsW.1-CPM was observed upon the addition of UvsW (Fig. 3B). Nucleotide Hydrolysis Activity—Several nucleotide triphosphates were tested using ssM13 as a substrate. Due to multiple regions of highly stable secondary structure, ssM13 contains both ssDNA and dsDNA regions. Using this substrate, UvsW is able to hydrolyze both ATP and GTP, with a slight preference for ATP (supplemental Fig. 1A). The KmATP is 170 ± 40 μm with a turnover number (kcat) of 50.1 ± 3.4 s-1 (supplemental Fig. 1B) We also examined the ATPase activity of UvsW in the presence of short oligonucleotides. UvsW is both a ssDNA- and a dsDNA-dependent ATPase, hydrolyzing ATP in the presence of a wide variety of DNA structures, including blunt dsDNA and ssDNA (supplemental Fig. 1C). Unwinding Assays—To confirm that our preparation of UvsW unwinds origin bound R-loops (11Dudas K.C. Kreuzer K.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2706-2715Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we used a plasmid based system containing a 0.6-kilobase fragment corresponding to the oriF region of the T4 genome. Transcription from the plasmid encoded T7 promoter results in the formation of a stably bound transcript resistant to RNaseA but susceptible to RNase H or thermal denaturation (data not shown). Treatment of the R-loop-containing plasmid with UvsW, UvsW/W.1, or UvsW-W.1 in the presence of ATP leads to the dissociation of the R-loop (Fig. 4A). This reaction is extremely efficient, with complete dissociation of the R-loop in 30 s. We also tested the ability of UvsW helicase to unwind a D-loop using an oligonucleotide/plasmid-based substrate (Fig. 4B). The supercoiled plasmid is identical to that used for the R-loop experiment, but the primer strand is an 80-base DNA oligonucleotide rather than a RNA polymerase-synthesized mRNA transcript. UvsW, UvsW/W.1, or UvsW-W.1 proteins were added to an ongoing reaction (2 min before the addition) containing plasmid, oligonucleotide, and RecA. Carried out in this manner, the RecA-catalyzed strand invasion reaction is occurring simultaneously with the unwinding activity of UvsW. As shown, all three proteins catalyze similar amounts of D-loop dissociation during the 30 s unwinding reaction. A time course indicates an ATP-dependent loss of D-loops with an observed rate of ∼1.5 min-1 under our conditions (Fig. 4C). We tested several oligonucleotide-based DNA structures as substrates for the unwinding activity of UvsW. UvsW, UvsW/W.1, and UvsW-W.1 were tested against each substrate both in the absence (data not shown) and presence (Fig. 5) of T4 single-strand DNA-binding protein (gp32). In the absence of gp32 under these assay conditions, there is a low level of helicase activity (less than 5% DNA unwinding) in the order of UvsW/ W.1 = UvsW-W.1 > UvsW. Substrate specificity of DNA unwinding appears to be unaltered by the presence or absence of gp32. UvsW is capable of unwinding a simple duplex containing a 3′ ssDNA (substrate B) overhang but not a 5′ ssDNA overhang (substrate A). This type of substrate preference is consistent with the prediction that UvsW translocates on DNA ina3′ to 5′ direction. Several branched DNA structures resembling stalled replication forks are also substrates for the unwinding activity of UvsW. The short arm(s) of substrates D, E, and F are all unwound from the DNA fork structures. Time courses of unwinding reactions using substrates D, E, and F reveal that only a fraction of the available substrate is unwound (Fig. 6). At the DNA concentrations used, spontaneous annealing cannot be the cause of this phenomenon. Likewise, trapping of the protein by the unwound strand can be ruled out because the ratio of protein to DNA is mu"
https://openalex.org/W2065164437,"The double par locus of Escherichia coli virulence factor pB171 consists of two adjacent and oppositely oriented par loci of different types, called par1 and par2. par1 encodes an actin ATPase (ParM), and par2 encodes an oscillating, MinD-like ATPase (ParA). The par loci share a central cis-acting region of ≈200 bp, called parC1, located between the two par loci. An additional cis-acting region, parC2, is located downstream of the parAB operon of par2. Here we show that ParR of par1 and ParB of par2 bind cooperatively to unrelated sets of direct repeats in parC1 to form the cognate partition and promoter repression complexes. Surprisingly, ParB repressed transcription of the noncognate par operon, indicating cross-talk and possibly epistasis between the two systems. The par promoters, P1 and P2, affected each other negatively. The DNA binding activities of ParR and ParB correlated well with the observed transcriptional regulation of the par operons in vivo and in vitro.

Integration host factor (IHF) was identified as a novel factor involved in par2-mediated plasmid partitioning. Bacterial plasmids have been used extensively as model systems in the study of DNA segregation. This is because plasmids encode centromere-like loci, also called partitioning (par) loci, that ensure stable propagation of their replicons (1Gerdes K. Møller-Jensen J. Ebersbach G. Kruse T. Nordstrom K. Cell. 2004; 116: 359-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 2Hayes F. Barilla D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 247-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) Plasmidborne par loci invariably consist of two proteins encoded by a bicistronic operon and one or more cis-acting centromere regions where the proteins act. The first gene in the operon (called parA, parF, or parM) encodes an ATPase. The second gene (called parB, parG, or parR) encodes an adaptor protein that binds to its cognate centromere and thereby forms the “partition complex” that, in turn, is recognized by the ATPase. Based on the ATPase, all par loci are divided into two types: Type I loci, which encode Walker box ATPases related to the MinD family, and Type II loci, which encode actin-like ATPases (3Bork P. Sander C. Valencia A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7290-7294Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 4Koonin E.V. J. Mol.

Based on gene sizes and arrangement, Type I loci are subdivided in Type Ia and Ib. Type Ib ATPases are generally smaller than those of Type Ia, which include ParA of plasmid P1 and SopA of plasmid F. The Type Ib ATPases lack the DNA-binding helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain found in the N-terminal part of the longer Type Ia ATPases (5Gerdes K. Møller-Jensen J. Jensen R.B. Mol.

Thus, contrary to the Type Ia ATPases, the Type Ib ATPases do not themselves specifically bind DNA. The molecular mechanism specified by Type II loci is well understood (1Gerdes K. Møller-Jensen J. Ebersbach G. Kruse T. Nordstrom K. Cell. 2004; 116: 359-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 7Møller-Jensen J. Borch J. Dam M. Jensen R.B. Roepstorff P. Gerdes K.

Science. 2004; 306: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). By contrast, the molecular mechanism behind the common and more efficient Type I loci has been more difficult to understand (2Hayes F. Barilla D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 247-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 9Ebersbach G. Gerdes K. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2005; 39: 453-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The Escherichia coli virulence plasmid, pB171, has two par loci designated par1 (Type II) and par2 (Type I) with a peculiar genetic arrangement. The oppositely oriented par1 and par2 loci share a common cis-acting region, parC1, of ≈200 bp only (see Fig. 1, A and B) (10Ebersbach G. Gerdes K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15078-15083Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). parC1 contains 17 6-bp direct repeats (called B1 to B17) organized in two clusters. As described previously (10Ebersbach G. Gerdes K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15078-15083Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), parC1 expresses both par1- and par2-specific incompatibility, indicating that the full-length parC1 fragment contains centromere-like sites for both par loci. The parC2 region downstream of parB also expresses par2-specific incompatibility and contains 18 6-bp direct repeats (B18–B35) that are related to the B repeats in parC1. In contrast, parC2 does not express par1-specific incompatibility (10Ebersbach G. Gerdes K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15078-15083Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Based on sequence similarity, the B repeats could be divided into two subclasses (I and II) (see Fig. 1, B and C) (10Ebersbach G. Gerdes K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15078-15083Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Individual repeats belonging to the two subclasses of B repeats are interspersed among each other in parC1 and parC2. In analogy with other Type I par loci (2Hayes F. Barilla D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 247-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 9Ebersbach G. Gerdes K. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2005; 39: 453-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), the genetic organization of parC1 and parC2 suggests that ParB binds to the B repeats. parC1 also harbors the P1 and P2 promoters that transcribe par1 and par2 (Fig. 1, A and B) (10Ebersbach G. Gerdes K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15078-15083Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). ParA of par2 is a Walker box ATPase, which forms filaments that oscillate in spiral-shaped structures over the nucleoid (10Ebersbach G. Gerdes K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15078-15083Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 11Ebersbach G. Gerdes K. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 385-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In the presence of par2, plasmids localize to midcell and/or cell quarters, a pattern that is dependent on ParA spiral formation and oscillation (11Ebersbach G. Gerdes K. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 385-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Recently, we proposed a working model for how an oscillating and filament-forming protein can localize plasmids primarily at midcell and quarter-cell positions (12Ebersbach G. Ringgaard S. Møller-Jensen J. Wang Q. Sherratt D.J. Gerdes K. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 1428-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The unusual genetic arrangement of the double par locus of pB171 stimulated an analysis of parC1 and parC2. We show here that both ParB and ParR bind to parC1 and that ParB binds to parC2. ParB recognizes the 6-bp direct repeats located within parC1 and parC2. Interestingly ParR recognizes two 10-bp direct repeats located in parC1 just upstream of parM. The ability of ParB and ParR to bind to parC1 is consistent with their transcriptional regulation of the two par operons, i.e. ParR regulates the par1 operon and parB the par2 operon. Surprisingly, however, ParB represses the par1 operon as efficiently as ParR, suggesting that par2 is epistatic to par1. This is, to our knowledge, the first example of cross-talk regulation between two different par loci. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—Plasmids are listed in Table 1.

In the pGE3100 series the P1 promoter reads into lacZ, and in the pGE3200 series, the P2 promoter reads into lacZ. The different truncated parC1 fragments were generated by PCR amplification using plasmid pB171 as the template (the names of the PCR primers used for the construction of the individual plasmids are shown in Table 1, and oligonucleotide sequences are given in Tables 2, 3, 4). All upstream primers contained an XhoI site, and the downstream primers contained a BamHI site. PCR fragments digested with BamHI and XhoI were cloned into the same sites of pRBJ200. A StuI-BamHI fragment of each pGE3000 series plasmid (harboring the cloned promoter fragment and the lacZYA genes) was subsequently cloned into the StuI-BamHI of plasmid pOU254, resulting in the plasmids used in the LacZ assays. The plasmids were transformed into the E. coli strain MC1000.TABLE 2Primers for construction of truncated ParR binding site in EMSADirection of truncationacw, clockwise; ccw, counterclockwisePrimer namePrimer sequencepar2, cwB171-995′-TATACGTTCATCTATAGCCCCTT-3′B171-1005′-ATCTATAGCCCCTTAAATACTCAA-3′B171-1015′-CCTTAAATACTCAATCTGAGTAAA-3′B171-1025′-TCAATCTGAGTAAATCACTGTTTC-3′B171-1035′-TAAATCACTGTTTCTGGTTGCAAG-3′B171-1045′-TTCTGGTTGCAAGGTAATACTCA-3′B171-1055′-CAAGGTAATACTCAATTTGAGCAC-3′B171-1175′-CTCAATTTGAGCACTATCATAGTT-3′B171-1065′-GCACTATCATAGTTATGAAATCAC-3′par2, ccwB171-PE25′-GATCTCCGTTTAACAGGC-3′par1, ccwB171-1075′-TTTCATAACTATGATAGTGCTCAA-3′B171-1085′-ATGATAGTGCTCAAATTGAGTATT-3′B171-1095′-TCAAATTGAGTATTACCTTGCAAC-3′B171-1105′-TATTACCTTGCAACCAGAAACAGT-3′B171-1115′-CAACCAGAAACAGTGATTTACTCA-3′B171-1125′-CAGTGATTTACTCAGATTGAGTAT-3′B171-1135′-CTCAGATTGAGTATTTAAGGGGCT-3′B171-1145′-GTATTTAAGGGGCTATAGATGAAC-3′B171-1155′-GGCTATAGATGAACGTATACTGCG-3′par2, cwB171-1165′-TCCAGTTCATAGTTAAATGTCTGG-3′a cw, clockwise; ccw, counterclockwise Open table in a new tab TABLE 3Primers for construction of truncated ParB binding site in EMSADirection of truncationacw, clockwise; ccw, counterclockwisePrimer namePrimer sequencepar2, cwB171-405′-CCCCCGGATCCGACGTCGCCCCTTAAATACTCAATCTGAG-3′B171-415′-CCCCCGGATCCGACGTCTATCATAGTTATGAAATCAC-3′B171-835′-TAAATCACTGTTTCTGGTTGCAAG-3′B171-425′-CCCCCGGATCCGACGTCAGTATTATTTATTACATCACATG-3′B171-445′-CCCCCGGATCCGACGTCTTTCATACTTCATAAATATGAATAC-3′B171-455′-CCCCCGGATCCGACGTCATTGACACCTCAGGTTACCGTGTC-3′B171-465′-CCCCCGGATCCGACGTCCATCATACTTCACACATCACA-3′par2, ccwB171-395′-CCCCCCTCGAGCTGCAGGCAACCTCATAAATGTGATGTGTG-3′par1, ccwB171-495′-CCCCCGGATCCGACGTCGATATTTTGACACGGTAACCTGAGG-3′B171-505′-CCCCCGGATCCGACGTCATATGTATTCATATTTATGAAGTATG-3′B171-515′-CCCCCGGATCCGACGTCATATGAAGTGTGTCATGTGATG-3′B171-525′-CCCCCGGATCCGACGTCGTAATAAATAATACTTGTGTTTTG-3′B171-535′-CCCCCGGATCCGACGTCTTGTGTTTTGTGATTTCATAAC-3′B171-545′-CCCCCGGATCCGACGTCAGTGCTCAAATTGAGTATTACC-3′par2, cwB171-405′-CCCCCGGATCCGACGTCGCCCCTTAAATACTCAATCTGAG-3′a cw, clockwise; ccw, counterclockwise Open table in a new tab TABLE 4Additional oligonucleotides used for PCRPrimer namePrimer sequenceB171-105′-CCCCCCTGCAGGGATCCGCAATACTTAAAAACACTAACG-3′B171-115′-CCCCCGACGTCCTCGAGCAATGCTGAAAAACAGACACGC-3′B171-195′-CCCCCGTCGACTCACCATGGGCCAAATACCTC-3′B171-205′-CCCCGGATCCTAAGGATTTATAAATGCATCACCATCACCATCACGTGAAGAAACCCAGCCAGCAAGC-3′B171-215′-CCCCCGTCGACTTATTACGTTAGTGTTTTTAAGTATTGC-3′B171-225′-CCCCGGATCCTAAGGAGGATTTATAAATGCATCACCATCACCATCACGACGATGAACGGAAAAGGAAAAAAT-3′B171-235′-CCCCCGTCGACCCCATTGCTTCATTCTGATATATCAG-3′B171-435′-CCCCCGGATCCGACGTCCATCACATGACACACTTCATATTTC-3′B171-475′-CCCCCCTCGAGCTGCAGGCCCCTTAAATACTCAATCTGAG-3′B171-485′-CCCCCGGATCCGACGTCGCAACCTCATAAATGTGATGTGTG-3′B171-555′-CCCCCGGATCCGAGCTCATAAGGAGTTTTATAAATGGTGAAGAAACC-3′B171-565′-CCCCCCTCGAGGGTACCAAGCTTGCGGCCGCTTATTACGTTAGTGTTTTTAAGTATTGC-3′B171-575′-CCCCCGGATCCGAGCTCATAAGGAGTTTTATAAGTGGACGATGAACGGAAAAGG-3′B171-585′-CCCCCCTCGAGGGTACCAAGCTTTCAGAATAATTTTTTCATTTTAAGACGC-3′B171-595′-CCCCCGGATCCGAGCTCATGAGGTTGCAATGATTACTGTAGTTGG-3′B171-605′-CCCCCGGATCCGAGCTCGCGGCCGCTTAAGGGGCTATAGATGAACGTATAC-3′B171-685′-CCCCCGCGGCCGCGAGCAGGCAAGCTATTTACCG-3′B171-695′-CCCCCGCGGCCGCCCTGGTTAGTTCAACATAGC-3′B171-925′-CCCCGGATCCTAAGGAGGATTTATAAATGCATCACCATCACCATCACGCAGAGGCTCTGGCTCAGCGCCTTG-3′B171-935′-CCCCGGATCCTAAGGAGGATTTATAAATGCATCACCATCACCATCACCCAGAAAAACAATGTCGGACGACAA-3′B171-SP75′-GACGCAATGCGTAACCTTAACCCGG-3′B171-SP105′-CCGGTGCCGTTGCTCATGCAATCG-3′ParM-up5′-CCCCCGGTACCTTAAGGGGCTATAGATGAACGTATACTGC-3′ParM-down5′-CCCCCTCTAGAGGATCCTTACTCCTCTTTGAAAGCCGCGATAGC-3′171SR145′-GGGGCAGCTGGCGAAAGGGGGATGTGCTGC-3′171SR165′-GGGGCAGCTGAATTTCACACAGGAAACAGCTA-3′ Open table in a new tab Construction of Plasmids Expressing ParR (pGE207) or ParB (pGE107)—DNA fragments containing parR and parB were PCR-amplified using pB171 as template. The primers used are listed in Table 1, and the DNA sequences of the oligonucleotides are given in Tables 2, 3, 4. A Shine-Dalgarno sequence (from parMR of R1, included in the upstream primer) was cloned in front of the parR and parB open reading frames. Upstream primers harbored a SacI site and downstream primers a HindIII site. These sites were subsequently used to clone the PCR fragments into the corresponding sites located downstream of the arabinose-inducible PBAD promoter of vector pBAD33. The pBAD33 derivatives were transformed into strains of MC1000 already harboring the pOU254 derivatives. The growth rate of almost all strains (except control strains containing the pBAD33 vector) decreased slightly upon arabinose addition, especially strains expressing ParB. Construction of Plasmids Used for Overexpression of His6-ParR and His6-ParB—ParR and ParB were amplified from plasmid pB171 by using PCR with the following DNA primers: parB, B171-20 + B171-21; parR, B171-22 + B171-23 (sequences are given in Table 4). Upstream primers contained His6 codons inserted between the start codon and the second codon of the ParR and ParB reading frames, respectively. The PCR products were digested with restriction enzymes BamHI and XhoI and cloned into the BamHI and SalI sites located downstream of the IPTG-inducible PA1/O4/O3 promoter of plasmid pMG25 thereby creating plasmids pGE121 (PA1/O4/O3::his6-parR) and pGE223 (PA1/O4/O3::his6-parB). DNA sequences of all PCR-amplified constructs were verified by DNA sequencing by using the CEQ2000 sequencing system provided by Beckman. Protein Purification—E. coli strain Top10 harboring either pGE223 (PA1/O4/O3::his6-parB) or pGE121 (PA1/O4/O3::his6-parR) was grown in LB medium at 37 °C to an A450 of 0.8 before expression of recombinant protein was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. Induction was continued for 4 h. All of the following steps of the purification procedure were performed on ice or in a 4 °C cold room. Harvested cells were resuspended in 4 ml of lysis buffer/200 ml of culture. Egg white lysozyme was added to resuspended cells at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml and incubated for 30 min. Cells were then sonicated three times for 20 s. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 30 min. The cleared lysate from 1 liter of culture was mixed with 1.0 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose matrix (Qiagen) and incubated with rotation for 1 h for binding of the histidines in the His6 tag to the nickel ions. The mixture was then allowed to settle in a column. The column was washed twice with 4 ml of wash buffer. Flow-through was collected for further analysis. Recombinant proteins were eluted four times with 0.5 ml of elution buffer. Each elution fraction was stored separately. 5 μl of all samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (4% stacking gel, 12.5% separation gel) followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of the gel. Lysis buffer consisted of 50 mm Na2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 30 mm imidazole, pH 8.0; wash buffer consisted of 50 mm Na2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 40 mm imidazole, pH 8.0; elution buffer consisted of 50 mm Na2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, pH 8.0. LacZ Assay—Cells of strain MC1000 harboring one mini-R1 plasmid (pOU254 derivative) and one expression plasmid (pBAD33 derivative) were grown at 35 °C in AB medium supplemented with 0.5% glycerol, 0.1% casamino acids, 0.1 μg/ml thiamin, and antibiotics (50 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 30 μg/ml ampicillin). The generation time in this medium was about 50 min. Overnight cultures were diluted 50-fold into fresh medium with antibiotics and grown to an A450 of ∼0.04–0.05. Then, 0.2% arabinose was added, and the cultures were grown for 3 h to an A450 of ∼0.4. Samples were collected for β-galactosidase activity measurements carried out according to Miller (14Miller J.F. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). The stability of the R1 plasmids containing the parC1-lacZ fusions were tested by plating on LA plates containing selection only for the pBAD33 derivatives in addition to 40 μg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal). The R1 plasmids were found to be stable during the time course of the experiment. Prolonged growth of the cultures in the presence of arabinose resulted in reduced plasmid stability especially in strains expressing ParB. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—DNA oligonucleotides were 32P-end-labeled in a kinase reaction. 20 pmol of oligonucleotide was mixed with 1.5 μl of 10 × polynucleotide kinase (PNK) buffer (1 m Tris-HCl, 100 mm MgCl2, 70 mm DTT, pH 8.0), 2 μl of 10 μCi/μl [γ-32P] ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), 1 unit of PNK buffer, of PNK, and H2O to a total volume of 15 μl. The reaction mixture was then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C followed by 10 min at 70 °C. End-labeled oligonucleotides were then used in a PCR reaction with an additional oligonucleotide designed to obtain the DNA fragment of interest.

The standard reaction mixture (20 μl) for the ParB/ParR experiments contained 10 mm Tris-base (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.1 μg/μl sonicated salmon sperm DNA. In EMSA experiments performed with integration host factor (IHF), the standard reaction mixture (20 μl) contained 25 mm Tris-base (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 μg/μl sonicated salmon sperm DNA. The standard reaction mixture was mixed on ice followed by the addition of 32P-end-labeled DNA fragments. Protein concentrations are given in the figure legends. We used a concentration of 5 nm 32P-labeled DNA fragments throughout. The reactions were then incubated for 20 min at ambient temperature. After incubation, glycerol was added to a concentration of 5%, and reactions were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 0.5× TBE (pH 7.5) 5% polyacrylamide gel in 1× TBE running buffer (0.89 m Tris-base, 0.89 m boric acid, 0.02 m EDTA, pH 8.3) at 200 V for 11/2 h. The polyacrylamide gels were prerun at 200 V for 1 h, and the TBE running buffer was changed once every hour. Gels were dried on paper and exposed to a phosphor screen over night for imaging on a phosphorimaging device. In determination of the Hill coefficient, the amount (log10 (X/(1 - X))) of bound parC1 (X) was plotted as a function of log10 to the respective concentrations of ParB and ParR. Generation of Biotinylated Double-stranded parC1 Fragments for Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)—Biotinylated parC1-containing DNA fragments were produced by PCR using a 5′-end-biotinylated B171-39 clockwise primer and B171-40 counterclockwise primer (Table 3) with pGE2 as template DNA. B171-39 was biotinylated. The PCR product was purified using the GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit (Amersham Biosciences) as recommended by the manufacturer. SPR Measurements—SPR was carried out using a Biacore 3000 instrument (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) with streptavidin-coated SA sensor chips (Biacore AB). Biacore measures the binding of molecules to ligands immobilized on sensor chips as real-time changes in the optical SPR phenomenon that is caused by changes in the refractive index near the sensor chip. The refractive index changes are linearly dependent on mass binding to the sensor chip, and hence the amount of analyte that binds the immobilized ligand can be calculated. Because the injections of analyte supply constant concentrations, the binding kinetics is monitored. When the flow is changed to buffer without analyte, the dissociation kinetics is monitored, as bound analyte leaves the immobilized ligand. For the binding studies, 150 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.005% Tween 20, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, was used as running buffer. 200 resonance units of the biotinylated parC1 PCR product was captured on flow cell 2 by injecting the cell with running buffer supplied with 0.5 m NaCl, whereas flow cell 1 was left blank for reference subtraction. Analysis of ParB binding to immobilized parC1 was conducted as follows. A continuous flow of running buffer at 10 μl/min over the two flow cells created a stable base line. ParB diluted to the specified concentration in running buffer was then injected over the two flow cells. To release the ParB complex from the immobilized DNA, the flow was increased to 40 μl/min, and two 15-s pulses of 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride were injected over both flow cells leaving the immobilized DNA ready for another binding cycle. The SPR response is dependent on mass bound to the sensor chip. Thus the relative numbers of ParB binding per immobilized parC1 were calculated according to n=Ranalyte×MrligandRligand×Mranalyte(Eq. 1) where Ranalyte is the SPR response contributed by the analyte (i.e. ParB) binding to the immobilized ligand (parC1 or ParB captured by parC1), Rligand is the response contributed by the immobilized ligand, and Mr ligand and Mr analyte are the molecular weights of the ligand and analyte, respectively. Calculation of the Number of ParB Molecules per Iteron in parC1— This calculation is as follows: R(ParB) = 450; R(parC1) = 200; Mr(His6-ParB) = 10,882.5 g/mol; Mr(parC1) = 165,472.4 g/mol. n=R(parB)×Mr(parC1)R(parC1)×Mr(His6-ParB)=450×165,472.4200×10,882.5=34.2≈34(Eq. 2) Thus, at 100 nm ParB, 34 molecules of ParB binds to parC1, corresponding to two ParB molecules per direct repeat in parC1; this suggests that one repeat binds one ParB dimer. R denotes response units in the SPR experiments. In Vitro Transcription Reactions— PCR fragments for P1 and P2 transcription were obtained using the primers B171-SP3/B171-39 and B171-40/B171-SP9 resulting in fragments of 1174 bp and 1114 bp, respectively (Tables 3 and 4). The standard reaction mixture contained 4 μl of 5 × transcription buffer (Promega), 2 μl of 100 mm DTT, 0.8 μl of RNA-guard, 4 μl of NTPmix (2.5 mm ATP, GTP, UTP), 2.4 μl of 100 μm CTP, 1 μl of template DNA (stock concentration, 20 ng/μl), 1 μl of [α-32P]CTP (10 mCi/μl), and 1 unit of DNA polymerase in a total volume of 25 μl. Where indicated protein was added to a concentration of 1 μm for ParB and 10 μm for ParR. Samples were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C followed by the addition of 1 μl of DNase (1 unit) and were then incubated an additional 15 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of formamide loading buffer and boiled for 10 min at 99 °C followed by denaturing PAGE on a 5% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried on paper and exposed to a 32P-sensitive screen overnight for imaging on a PhosphorImager. Oligonucleotides Used for PCR—These primer sequences are listed in Tables 2, 3, 4. The Divergent P1 and P2 Promoters Are Negatively Coupled— As described above, parC1 contains the B1–B17 repeats located in two clusters that are potential operators for ParB binding (Fig. 1B). Further inspection of the parC1 region revealed two 10-bp direct repeats, R1 and R2, separated by"

These organelles are the repository of proteins and peptides that are secreted in a regulated manner when the cell receives a physiological stimulus. The targeting of proteins to these secretory granules is crucial for the generation of certain peptide hormones, including insulin and ACTH. Although previous work has demonstrated that proteins destined to a variety of cellular locations, including secretory granules, contain targeting sequences, no single consensus sequence for secretory granule-sorting signals has emerged. We have shown previously that α-helical domains in the C-terminal tail of the prohormone convertase PC1/3 play an important role in the ability of this region of the protein to direct secretory granule targeting (Jutras, I. Seidah, N. G., and Reudelhuber, T. L. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 40337–40343). In this study, we show that a variety of α-helical domains are capable of directing a heterologous secretory protein to granules. By testing a series of synthetic α-helices, we also demonstrate that the presence of charged (either positive or negative) amino acids spatially segregated from a hydrophobic patch in the α-helices of secretory proteins likely plays a critical role in the ability of these structures to direct secretory granule sorting.

Many enzymes and peptide hormones, including renin, insulin, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), 2The abbreviations used are: ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; TGN, trans-Golgi network; POMC, pro-opiomelanocortin. 2The abbreviations used are: ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; TGN, trans-Golgi network; POMC, pro-opiomelanocortin. are synthesized as precursors that are proteolytically activated before secretion from the cell. In most cases, this proteolytic activation occurs only after the precursors are selectively targeted to specialized organelles found in endocrine and neuroendocrine cells called dense core secretory granules (1Orci L. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Madsen O. Perrelet A. Vassalli J.D. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2273-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 2Tanaka S. Yora T. Nakayama K. Inoue K. Kurosumi K. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 425-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This process depends on the efficient co-targeting of the activating protease and its substrate from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to nas-cent secretory granules, where the protease processes the precursor. Because the resulting polypeptide hormones are stored within secretory granules until the cell receives a signal for their release, this mode of protein export from the cell is called the regulated secretory pathway. Several protein domains have been implicated in the process of sorting proteins to dense core secretory granules. The function of these domains can be grossly subdivided into three groups. The first group involves formation of high molecular weight protein complexes or aggregates. Indeed, many granule-targeting proteins have the ability to multimerize or aggregate, leading in most cases to the formation of electron dense cores (reviewed in Ref. 3Dannies P.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 177: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Expression of a variety of granule cargo proteins, including chromogranin A (4Kim T. Tao-Cheng J.H. Eiden L.E. Loh Y.P.

Stettler H. Renold A. Rutishauser J. Spiess M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20242-20249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), is sufficient to induce aggregate-containing cytoplasmic vesicles in cells that do not normally contain secretory granules, although these vesicles do not have all of the characteristics of secretory granules (5Beuret N. Stettler H. Renold A. Rutishauser J. Spiess M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20242-20249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Proinsulin, POMC, and engineered proteins containing the C-terminal tail of the prohormone convertase PC1/3 also form multimers; however, this property alone is insufficient to direct granule sorting (6Quinn D. Orci L. Ravazzola M. Moore H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 7Jutras I. Seidah N.G. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40337-40343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, aggregation or multimerization may contribute to secretory granule-targeting efficiency, although it has not been shown in many cases to be essential. The second group of granule-sorting domains may act by binding cargo proteins to granule-tethered proteins. For example, carboxypeptidase E has been proposed to interact with a number of granule cargo proteins, including POMC, proenkephalin, growth hormone, and proinsulin, and to promote their retention in secretory granules, even though some of these are not enzymatic substrates of carboxypeptidase E (8Cool D.R.

In addition, paired basic amino acids (which may form semi-stable complexes with granule-resident proteases) have been reported to direct secre-tory granule sorting in some proteins, including prosomatostatin (11Brakch N. Cohen P. Boileau G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), prorenin (12Brechler V. Chu W.N. Baxter J.D. Thibault G. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 5488-5493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Muclin, a type I membrane protein granule-resident protein, has also been suggested to act as a granule cargo “receptor” in pancreatic cells through its binding of sulfate groups on O-linked glycosylated proteins (14Boulatnikov I. De Lisle R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40918-40926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, a variety of interactions with “tethers” may serve to target proteins to secretory granules. The third class of granule-targeting protein domains involves the direct association of proteins with the secretory granule membrane. Peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (15O'Donnell P.J.

Proteins may also interact, but not span, granule membranes; for example, the membrane-binding domains of the granule-resident protein carboxypeptidase E (17Mitra A. Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7798-7807Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) are key for their targeting to dense core secretory granules. In each of these cases, as well as in prosomatostatin (21Mouchantaf R. Kumar U. Sulea T. Patel Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26308-26316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and the neuronal and endocrine polypep-tide VGF (22Garcia A.L. Han S.K. Janssen W.G. Khaing Z.Z. Ito T.

Taken together, these results raise the possibility that the presence of α-helical domains plays an important role in the targeting of certain proteins to nascent secretory granules. In this study, we sought to obtain a better understanding of the mechanism by which granule-sorting α-helices function. A systematic analysis of a series of α-helices varying in either their polar or non-polar residues or their amphipathicity indicated that the combination of charged residues with a hydrophobic patch in an α-helix is sufficient for targeting proteins to secretory granules. Recombinant Plasmid Construction—Naturally occurring peptide fragments to be analyzed for secretory granule sorting were derived from the mouse PC1/3 (GenBank™ accession number NM_013628) and human prorenin (accession number NM_000537) cDNAs. The numbering used to identify the protein domains is relative to the initiator methionine of both proteins. Protein fragments were tested for their ability to sort heterologous proteins to secretory granules by attachment to a fragment of mouse IgG2b (referred to as Fc; illustrated in Fig. 1C) as described previously (7Jutras I.

Expression vectors were stably transfected into AtT-20 cells by cotransfection with pSV-Neo (Invitrogen), and selection of stable pools was carried out in Geneticin (G418, Invitrogen). G418-resistant pools of cells were used for all subsequent studies. For metabolic labeling, 4.5 × 105 stably transfected cells were plated in each of two 35-mm dishes. Twenty-four hours later, the medium was replaced with 0.5 ml of prewarmed methionine-free Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum for 1 h. Labeling was achieved by addition of 300 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine (Tran35S-label, MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) for 2 h. The medium was then replaced with prewarmed complete medium for 16 h (chase). To test for regulated secretion, the cells were rinsed in complete medium; in one of the wells, the cells were incubated for an additional 3 h in complete medium to measure constitutive secretion, whereas in the other well, the cells were incubated in complete medium supplemented with 10 μm forskolin (Sigma), a secretagogue that stimulates secretory granule release. The corresponding culture supernatants were then immunoprecipitated with protein A-Sepharose (Sigma), and the immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. The gels were incubated with three changes of 10% 2,5-diphenyloxazole (Sigma) in dimethyl sulfoxide, rinsed in water, dried, and subjected to fluorography. Dried gels were subsequently exposed to storage phosphor screens, and emissions were quantified using a Storm PhosphorImager (GE Health-care, Mississauga, Ontario).

Twenty-four hours later, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in Tris-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature, rinsed in Tris-buffered saline, and permeabilized with absolute methanol at -20 °C for 10 min. Nonspecific binding was blocked for 30 min with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline at 4 °C for 1 h (blocking buffer). Slides were incubated with rabbit anti-ACTH polyclonal antibody (1:300 dilution; obtained from Dr. Nabil G. Seidah, Clinical Research Institute of Montreal) and anti-mouse IgG antibody (Invitrogen) conjugated to Alexa 488 (1:200 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature in blocking buffer. The slides were subsequently washed with Tris-buffered saline and incubated with anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to rhodamine (1:100 dilution; Chemicon, Temecula, Ca) for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were mounted using a SlowFade Light antifade kit (Invitrogen) and visualized using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. Exposed α-Helices Direct Secretory Proteins to Granules—To compare the ability of various α-helical domains to redirect a constitutively secreted protein into secretory granules, we analyzed the secretory properties of a series of pulse-labeled recombinant fusion proteins in mouse pituitary AtT-20 cells in either the absence or presence of forskolin, a secretagogue that increases intracellular cAMP, resulting in the release of secre-tory granules. AtT-20 cells contain dense core secretory granules in which endogenous POMC is processed into ACTH by a series of proteolytic cleavages involving PC1/3 (reviewed in Ref. 29Seidah N.G. Prat A. Essays Biochem. 2002; 38: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). As we have shown previously (7Jutras I. Seidah N.G. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40337-40343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), a recombinant protein expressing a single chain fragment of the mouse immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region (Fc) was secreted constitutively (i.e. not retained in granules) when expressed in these cells as evidenced by both its low abundance after a 16-h chase (most of the protein had already been secreted) and its equivalent levels of secretion in the absence (constitutive secretion; -F lane) and presence (regulated secretion; +F lane) of forskolin (Fig. 1C). By contrast, attaching the region of the PC1/3 C-terminal tail comprising amino acids 711–753 to the C terminus of the Fc fragment (Fc-PC1/3-(711–753)) led to its increased retention after the 16-h chase and increased secretion in the presence of forskolin, demonstrating that the fusion protein had been stored in the regulated secretory pathway. This portion of the PC1/3 C-terminal tail contains a region predicted to form an α-helix (Fig. 1A), which is crucial for its ability to direct secretory granule sorting (7Jutras I. Seidah N.G. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40337-40343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The importance of the α-helix in directing sorting was confirmed by the loss of forskolin-stimulated release of the fusion protein in which the helical domain was deleted (Fc-PC1-(711–740)) (Fig. 1). To determine whether there is some unique characteristic of α-helices that are capable of sorting proteins to secretory granules, we replaced the natural helix predicted to reside in the last 13 amino acids of the PC1/3 C terminus with an entirely synthetic amphipathic α-helix (23Lee S.

Surprisingly, substitution of the native helical peptide with the synthetic α-helix (Fc-PC1/3-(711–740)K/L+W) led to regulated secretion of the fusion protein in AtT-20 cells (Fig. 1C). To further test whether the simple exposure of α-helical domains on secretory proteins could be sufficient to target proteins to secretory granules, we attached the first 31 amino acids of the human prorenin prosegment to the C terminus of the Fc fragment (Fc-human prorenin-(1–31)) (Fig. 1C). Although this region of human prorenin contains two predicted α-helical domains (Fig. 1B) (33Heinrikson R.L. Hui J. Zurcher-Neely H. Poorman R.A. Am. J. Hypertens. 1989; 2: 367-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), these play no role in secretory granule sorting in the native protein context (12Brechler V. Chu W.N. Baxter J.D. Thibault G. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20636-20640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, when placed C-terminal to the Fc fragment (Fc-human prorenin-(1–31)), the prorenin prosegment had the ability to confer regulated secretion to the fusion protein (Fig. 1C). Quantification of granule-sorting efficiency and comparison with the forskolin-stimulated secretion of endogenous β-endorphin (a peptide product of POMC cleavage in secretory granules) confirmed that all of the helix-containing domains diverted the normally constitutively secreted Fc fragment into the regulated secretory pathway (Table 1). As an independent confirmation of the ability of these α-helices to direct secretory granule targeting, we compared the sub-cellular distribution of the various Fc fusion proteins with that of ACTH, an endogenous granule-resident protein in AtT-20 cells (Fig. 2). Labeling the transfected AtT-20 cells with anti-ACTH antibody (Fig. 2, middle panels) resulted in staining of POMC, the precursor of ACTH in the Golgi apparatus (asterisks), as well as speckled staining of ACTH in dense core secre-tory granules, which are concentrated in cytoplasmic extensions (arrowheads) (34De Bie I. Marcinkiewicz M. Malide D. Lazure C. Nakayama K. Bendayan M. Seidah N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1261-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). When either the Fc protein alone or the Fc protein attached to fragment 711–740 of PC1/3 was expressed, staining was localized primarily in the Golgi apparatus and perinuclear area (Fig. 2, left panels, arrowheads), indicating inefficient sorting to granules as predicted by our biochemical studies (see above). In contrast, attachment of either fragment 711–753 of PC1/3 or the human prorenin prosegment to the Fc fragment or of the synthetic K/L+W α-helix to Fc-PC1/3-(711–740) led to a dramatic increase in fusion protein detection in cytoplasmic extensions (Fig. 2, arrowheads). This staining co-localized with ACTH-containing secretory granules (Fig. 2, right panels). Thus, the steady-state distribution of the fusion proteins as determined by confocal microscopy confirms the results obtained by kinetic secretory assays and strongly suggests that any exposed α-helical domain in a secretory protein can direct the protein to dense core secretory granules. Biochemical Characteristics of Granule-targeting α-Helices— Although the data presented above demonstrate that the presence of an α-helix is necessary for the granule-sorting activity of the protein fragments tested, they do not indicate whether an α-helix is sufficient to constitute a granule-sorting signal. To test this possibility, we attached the K/L+W helix directly to the C terminus of the Fc protein and examined its sorting to secretory granules in stably transfected AtT-20 cells. Because the fusion proteins attached to various synthetic α-helices were secreted with variable kinetics from the transfected cells (data not shown), we could not directly compare their sorting by pulse-chase analysis. For this reason and because the cellular distribution of the fusion prote"

WaaJ belongs to glycosyltransferase CAZy family 8, characterized by the GT-A fold, a DXD motif, and by retention of configuration at the anomeric carbon of the donor sugar. Detailed kinetic and structural information for bacterial family 8 glycosyltransferases has resulted from studies of Neisseria meningitidis LgtC. As many as 28 amino acids could be deleted from the C terminus of LgtC without affecting its in vitro catalytic behavior. This C-terminal domain has a high ratio of positively charged and hydrophobic residues, a feature conserved in WaaJ and some other family 8 representatives. Unexpectedly, deletion of as few as five residues from the C terminus of WaaJ resulted in substantially reduced in vivo activity. With deletions of 15 residues or less, activity was only detected when levels of expression were elevated. No in vivo activity was detected after the removal of 20 amino acids, regardless of expression levels. Longer deletions (20 residues and greater) compromised the ability of WaaJ to associate with the membrane. However, the reduced in vivo activity in enzymes lacking 5–12 C-terminal residues also reflected a dramatic drop in catalytic activity in vitro (a 294-fold decrease in the apparent kcat/Km,LPS). Deletions removing 20 or more residues resulted in a protein showing no detectable in vitro activity. Therefore, the C-terminal domain of WaaJ plays a critical role in enzyme function.

Deletions removing 20 or more residues resulted in a protein showing no detectable in vitro activity. Therefore, the C-terminal domain of WaaJ plays a critical role in enzyme function. The outer leaflet of the Gram-negative outer membrane contains lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 3The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; core OS, core oligosaccharide; Kdo, 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid; FCHASE, 6-(fluoresce-in-5-carboxamido)-hexanoic acid, succimidyl ester. as a major component. LPS consists of three structural domains as follows: lipid A, the core oligosaccharide region (core OS), and O antigen. In the Enter-obacteriaceae, the core OS can be further conceptually divided into the inner core, containing Kdo residues and a heptose backbone, and the outer core, composed of hexoses and acetamido sugars (Fig. 1). Lipid A-core OS is formed by the combined activity of Lpx* enzymes synthesizing lipid A, which then becomes the acceptor for the Waa* glycosyltransferase enzymes involved in the further synthesis of the inner and outer core OS regions (reviewed in Ref. 1Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3423) Google Scholar). Once formed, the lipid A-core OS is transported by MsbA to the periplasmic face of the inner membrane (reviewed in Ref. 2Doerrler W.T. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 542-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). O antigen is synthesized separately and added to core OS by the action of the putative ligase, WaaL, prior to translocation of completed LPS to the outer leaflet of the outer membrane. LPS plays a variety of roles in the virulence of bacterial pathogens and is essential for outer membrane integrity and the viability of most Gram-negative bacteria (1Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3423) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli isolates produce one of five core OS types: K-12, R1, R2, R3, and R4 (reviewed in Ref. 3Amor K. Heinrichs D.E. Frirdich E. Ziebell K. Johnson R.P. Whitfield C. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 1116-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and there are at least two core OS types in Salmonella isolates (4Kaniuk N. Monteiro M. Parker C. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1305-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The backbone of the inner (lipid A proximal) core OS is typically conserved, and the various core types primarily arise from differences in inner core substitution and the structure of the part of the outer core that provides the attachment site for O antigen. The genetic basis for these differences has been described (4Kaniuk N. Monteiro M. Parker C. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1305-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 5Heinrichs D.E. Yethon J.A. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Glycosyltransferases play diverse critical roles in the biology of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. However, bacterial enzymes have provided some influential models to assess glycosyltransferase structure and function because of the relative ease of their manipulation. The outer core OS biosynthesis glycosyltransferases in E. coli provide an interesting collection of related enzymes to examine principles of substrate (UDP-sugar) and linkage specificity. These enzymes transfer hexose residues to a lipid A-core acceptors in reactions that, unlike O antigen biosynthesis, do not involve polyprenol-linked donors (1Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3423) Google Scholar). WaaJ is required for the addition of an α-1,2-glucose to the outer core OS in R3 E. coli (6Kaniuk N.A. Vinogradov E. Li J. Monteiro M.A. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31237-31250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (7Kadam S.K. Rehemtulla A. Sanderson K.E. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 277-284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which becomes the point of attachment for O antigen (Fig. 1) (8Haishima Y. Holst O. Brade H. Eur. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 3817-3829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). According to the CAZy classification system, WaaJ belongs to glycosyltransferase family 8, a family with a relatively solid foundation of structure-function data. Although the nature of the UDP-sugar donors and in vivo acceptors differ widely, this group of enzymes is characterized by the GT-A structural fold, a DXD motif that binds a catalytically important divalent metal ion, and retention of configuration at the anomeric carbon of the donor sugar. Solved structures are available for the family 8 glycosyltransferase representatives, Neisseria meningitidis LgtC (10Lairson L.L. Chiu C.P. Ly H.D. He S. Wakarchuk W.W. Strynadka N.C. Withers S.G. J.

Biol. 2002; 319: 463-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). N. meningitidis LgtC is an α-(1,4)-galactosyltransferase that has been subject to detailed kinetic characterization using a variety of synthetic acceptor substrates (11Persson K. Ly H.D. Dieckelmann M. Wakarchuk W.W. Withers S.G. Strynadka N.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 13Wakarchuk W.W. Cunningham A. Watson D.C. Young N.M. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), LgtC follows an ordered bi bi mechanism, with binding of UDP-Gal preceding binding of the acceptor (11Persson K. Ly H.D. Dieckelmann M. Wakarchuk W.W. Withers S.G. Strynadka N.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). UDP-sugar donor binding is achieved with the participation of the metal ion and is thought to be followed by a conformational change that forms the binding site for the acceptor. The donor anomeric carbon is positioned at an opening in the binding pocket to be accessible to attack by the acceptor sugar nucleophile. After the reaction occurs, the Gal-linked product is released first, followed by UDP. Although N. meningitidis LgtC and E. coli R3 WaaJ both belong to glycosyltransferase family 8, they exhibit limited sequence similarity, utilize different UDP-sugar donor substrates, and catalyze different linkages of the donor sugar to their respective acceptors. They do, however, share a C-terminal domain with predominantly hydrophobic and positively charged residues (Fig. 2). This region (25 amino acid residues) was deleted to obtain derivatives of LgtC that did not aggregate and were amenable to crystallization (10Lairson L.L. Chiu C.P. Ly H.D. He S. Wakarchuk W.W. Strynadka N.C. Withers S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28339-28344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 11Persson K. Ly H.D. Dieckelmann M. Wakarchuk W.W. Withers S.G. Strynadka N.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The resulting protein was active with soluble synthetic acceptors. It was speculated that the predominantly hydrophobic and positively charged residues in the deleted domain contributed to aggregation and, furthermore, that the C-terminal domain might play a role in associating LgtC with the membrane. However, the precise function of this C-terminal domain has not been investigated directly, and this represents the objective of this work. The work presented here conclusively demonstrates the importance of the C-terminal 20 amino acids of WaaJ in membrane association, in vivo function, and in vitro catalytic activity. Bacterial Strains—The E. coli F653 R3 prototype is a derivative of serotype O111 with a complete core OS and an undefined defect in O antigen biosynthesis (14Schmidt G. Jann B. Jann K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 10: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 15Schmidt G. Fromme I. Mayer H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 14: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). E. coli CWG350 is a waaJ::aacC1 (gentamycinr) mutant derived from F653 (6Kaniuk N.A. Vinogradov E. Li J. Monteiro M.A. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31237-31250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). WaaJ derivatives were expressed in E. coli TOP10 (F- mcrA Δ(mrr-hsdRMS-mcrBC) f80ΔlacZM15 ΔlacX74 deoR recA1 araD139 Δ(ara-leu)7697 galU galK rpsL (Strr) endA1 nupG) and E. coli BL21 (DE3) (B F- hsdSB(rB-mB-) gal dcm ompT (λDE3)); both were purchased from Novagen. DNA Methods and Plasmid Construction—The plasmids used in this work are described below, and the primers used in their construction are listed in supplemental Table I. Plasmid pWQ272 is a pBAD18 derivative (16Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3978) Google Scholar) containing the coding sequence for a His6-WaaJWT fusion protein that was moved from the previously reported pET-based pWQ155 plasmid (6Kaniuk N.A. Vinogradov E. Li J. Monteiro M.A. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31237-31250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). PCR amplification was used to generate constructs encoding proteins with deletions of 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 37 residues from the C terminus (designated His6-WaaJΔ5 through His6-WaaJΔ37, respectively). The forward primer (ML18) anneals upstream of the coding sequence with the AGG-3′ in the primer forming part of the AGGA ribosome-binding site located nine nucleotides upstream of the ATG initiation codon. The reverse primers (ML19, ML20, ML23, ML26, ML24, and NK5) all introduced new termination (TAA) codons at the appropriate positions. PCR-generated products were digested with the appropriate restriction endonucleases at sites incorporated into the primer sequences and cloned in pBAD18 as pWQ273 (encoding His6-WaaJΔ5), pWQ274 (His6-WaaJΔ10), pWQ276 (His6-WaaJΔ15), pWQ277 (His6-WaaJΔ20), pWQ278 (His6-WaaJΔ30), and pWQ279 (His6-WaaJΔ37), respectively. Plasmid pWQ275 (encoding His6-WaaJΔ12) was created by introducing a stop codon through QuickChange (Stratagene) mutagenesis of pWQ272 template using primers CF24 and CF25. All DNA primers were synthesized by Sigma Genosys, and all of the constructs were confirmed to be error-free by sequencing at the Guelph Molecular Supercenter (University of Guelph). Complementation Experiments to Assess in Vivo Activity of His6-WaaJ Derivatives—WaaJ functionality was determined by electrotransformation of E. coli CWG350 with plasmids encoding the various WaaJ derivatives. Cultures of transformed bacteria were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and 0.1-ml aliquots were used to inoculate 5-ml cultures of the same medium supplemented with 0, 0.002, or 0.02% l-arabinose to induce expression from the pBAD promoter in pBAD18 (16Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3978) Google Scholar). After growth at 37 °C for 5 h, SDS-proteinase K whole-cell lysate samples were made following the procedure of Hitchcock and Brown (17Hitchcock P.J. Brown T.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 269-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LPS molecular species in these samples were then separated by electrophoresis using 4–12% gradient NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen). Electrophoresis was carried out at 150 V for 75 min. The gels were silver-stained using standard methods (18Tsai G.M. Frasch C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2317) Google Scholar). The extent of complementation was determined by scanning the gels using a Bio-Rad GS-800 calibrated densitometer and determining the relative amounts of the two major bands with QuantityOne software. Overexpression and Purification of WaaJ—His6-WaaJ derivatives were overexpressed in E. coli TOP10 cells. A 250-ml culture was grown at 37 °C until it reached an A600 ∼ 0.5, and gene expression was then induced with l-arabinose at a final concentration of 0.02%. After 3 h at 37°C, the cells were collected by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 4 °C, 15 min). The pellet was resuspended in 8 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and one-half of a Mini-EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science) was added. The suspension was then stored at -20 °C until use. The frozen cell pellet was thawed and supplemented with 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 15 mm imidazole, and one-half of a protease inhibitor tablet. The cell suspension was sonicated on ice, and unbroken cells were removed from the lysate by centrifugation (20,000 × g, 4 °C, 10 min). The resulting cell-free supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation (112,000 × g, 4 °C, 1 h). The clarified supernatant was mixed with 1 ml of His-Select nickel affinity gel resin slurry (Sigma), and one-half of a protease inhibitor tablet was added. After batch binding at 4 °C for 1 h, the mixture was packed into a gravity column. The resin was washed twice with 5 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 30 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol. The protein was eluted from the resin with four 1-ml washes using the same buffer containing 500 mm imidazole; the majority of the protein eluted in the first two fractions. The protein-containing fractions were concentrated and the buffer exchanged using a PD10 column (GE HealthCare) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 50% glycerol, according to manufacturer's procedure. The protein was eluted with 3.5 ml of the same buffer, yielding a sample of >95% purity, based on SimplyBlue (Invitrogen) staining. The protein was dispensed in 0.2-ml aliquots for single use, and total protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The enzyme was stable in this form at 4 °C for periods of up to 2 weeks. Storage at -20 °C offered no additional stability, and enzyme samples thawed after storage at -80 °C showed significant loss of activity. Subcellular Localization of His6-WaaJ Derivatives—Subcellular localization studies were performed by expressing the various constructs in E. coli CWG350. Preparation of the cell-free lysates followed the protocols used for enzyme purification. After the ultracentrifugation step, the soluble fraction was collected, and the membrane pellet was washed twice with 2 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and resuspended in the same buffer. The fraction volumes were adjusted to facilitate direct comparison of the amount of membrane protein corresponding to a given amount of soluble protein. Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The Western immunoblots were developed using HisProbe H3 mouse anti-His6 primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and goat anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase-conjugate secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Montréal, Quebec, Canada). Nitro blue tetrazolium (from Sigma) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (from Roche Applied Science) were used as substrates to develop the Western blots. The bands were quantified by densitometry using a Bio-Rad GS-800 calibrated densitometer with QuantityOne software. In Vitro Determination of the Activity of His6-WaaJ Derivatives—The activity of the various constructs was determined based on the transfer of radioactivity from UDP-14C-Glc (305.9 mCi/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to an acceptor comprising the LPS isolated from E. coli CWG350. To achieve the appropriate donor concentrations, nonradioactive UDPGlc was added from stock. Activity was compromised by concentrations of ethanol (from the radioactive donor) above 6% (v/v) ethanol (data not shown); all reactions contained <3% (v/v). The LPS (3453 g/mol calculated molecular weight) was purified as described previously (6Kaniuk N.A. Vinogradov E. Li J. Monteiro M.A. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31237-31250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) by the phenol/chloroform/petroleum ether method (19Galanos C. Lüderitz O. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1993; 9: 11-18Google Scholar). The isolated LPS was frozen and lyophilized. Working stocks were stored as 2 or 5 mg/ml aqueous solutions at -20 °C. To determine the precise LPS content in the samples, Kdo content was determined (20Karkhanis Y.D. Zeltner J.Y. Jackson J.J. Carlo D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 85: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Recognizing there is heterogeneity in Kdo content in the isolated R3 LPS (6Kaniuk N.A. Vinogradov E. Li J. Monteiro M.A. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31237-31250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 8Haishima Y. Holst O. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the measured Kdo values were entirely consistent with the calculated values for a homogeneous sample containing (on average) two Kdo residues (data not shown). For reactions, the LPS stock was thawed, vortexed to resuspend any precipitated LPS, and then placed at 55 °C for at least 10 min to redissolve the LPS. After this, the LPS stayed in solution at room temperatures or higher. Aliquots of the LPS stock were then added to a reaction buffer containing Tris, pH 7.5, and EDTA. The UDP-glucose and MgCl2 were then added. Incubation of LPS with MgCl2 for extended periods led to precipitation of the substrate. However, under the conditions and time course employed, no precipitation was detected. Final reaction conditions after the addition of WaaJ were 1–145 μm UDP-Glc, 2–750 μm LPS, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.4 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, and 200–900 nm WaaJ in a final volume of 0.1 ml. The WaaJ concentration was adjusted to ensure that it was always at least 5-fold below the lowest substrate concentration. To test the effect of phosphatidylethanolamine (E. coli l-α type 5, Sigma; 700 g/mol calculated molecular weight) on WaaJ activity, a 6 mg/ml (8.57 mm) stock solution in 25% (v/v) methanol/water) was added to the LPS solution before heating to 55 °C; it was present at 2.23 mm in the final 100-μl reaction volume. This followed a method reported previously (21Levy S.B. Leive L. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 585-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Endo A. Rothfield L. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 3508-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme. Twenty-microliter samples were removed and transferred to 1 ml of ice-cold 2 m acetic acid. Although dilute acetic acid is known to release polysaccharide from lipid A, no such release was observed during the course of the reaction as long as all fractions were kept on ice. Incorporation of radioactivity into LPS was measured using a filter-binding assay. A cellulose filter (0.45 μm, 25 mm; MicroSep Cellulosic, Osmonics Inc.) was pre-washed with 1 ml of 2 m acetic acid, and the 1-ml stopped sample was then added. The filter was washed three times with 1 ml of 2 m acetic acid and left to air-dry. Each filter was then placed in a scintillation vial with 4 ml of EcoLite (MP, Irvine, CA) scintillation mixture, and the samples were quantified using a Beckman Coulter LS 6500 multipurpose scintillation counter. Data were derived from (at least) triplicate samples. Prism 4 (GraphPad) was used to calculate the rates of reaction for WaaJ at each UDP-glucose and LPS concentration from the linear fit of the 0-, 0.5-, and 1-min time points. In each case, less than 20% substrate conversion had occurred. However, assays over a longer time course established that the reaction was linear to at least 50% substrate conversion (corresponding to 4–5 min for His6-WaaJWT at saturation of both substrates). The rates at each substrate concentration were then fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation to determine values for kcat and Km. Because this was a stopped assay, these should be considered as apparent values for kcat and Km. Similarities Shared by LgtC and WaaJ—As might be anticipated for proteins that both belong to glycosyltransferase family 8, LgtC and WaaJ primary sequences share some highly conserved domains (Fig. 2A), despite the fact that the overall sequence identity (22%) and similarity (43%) are limited. When secondary structure predictions are taken into consideration, there is evident similarity in overall architecture. As a result, when WaaJ is threaded over the solved LgtC structure (Fig. 2B), there is extensive overlap. The base structure for LgtC lacks the 25 C-terminal amino acid residues because their presence resulted in aggregation problems that prevented crystallization (11Persson K. Ly H.D. Dieckelmann M. Wakarchuk W.W. Withers S.G. Strynadka N.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). This region is therefore not included in the threading experiment. The sequences of WaaJ and LgtC predict no transmembrane helices. However, given that their acceptors are nascent lipid A-core OS molecules, membrane association of the enzyme might be beneficial for its activity. Although the truncated LgtC derivative was active with synthetic acceptors, Persson et al. (11Persson K. Ly H.D. Dieckelmann M. Wakarchuk W.W. Withers S.G. Strynadka N.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) proposed that native LgtC might be tethered to the membrane by interactions between positive and aromatic amino acids of this C-terminal region with the hydrophobic and negatively charged regions of the inner membrane phospholipids. Alignment of the C-terminal domains of LgtC and other known and predicted family 8 members, including several core biosynthesis (Waa-prefix proteins (5Heinrichs D.E. Yethon J.A. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar)), demonstrates the conserved presence of a region enriched in positively charged and aromatic amino acids (Fig. 3; Table 1).TABLE 1Analysis of positively charged and aromatic amino acid content of representative bacterial glycosyltransferases from CAZy family 8 The proteins (and corresponding GenBank™ accession numbers) are as follows: E. coli WaaJ (AF019745), E. coli WaaT (Q8KMW8), E. coli WaaO (Q8KMW9), E. coli WaaI (Q9ZIT4), E. coli WaaW (Q8KMW6), E. coli WaaS (O68207), R. etli LgtA (Q52832), N. meningitidis LgtC (P96945), H. pylori HO0159 (O24967), and H. pylori HP1416 (O25962).ProteinNo. of amino acids comparedPercent aromatic + positiveRelative enrichment in C-terminal domainC-terminal domainaC-terminal region is aligned in Fig. 3N-terminal domainbRemaining polypeptide after C-terminal domain is excludedC-terminal domainaC-terminal region is aligned in Fig. 3N-terminal domainbRemaining polypeptide after C-terminal domain is excludedEcWaaJ7226739251.6EcWaaT7126035251.4EcWaaO7426435191.8EcWaaI7326239251.6EcWaaW7926338221.7EcWaaS7421640192.1ReLgtA7323632191.7NmLgtC6824335231.5HpHP01598828440221.8HpHP14168528235251.4a C-terminal region is aligned in Fig. 3b Remaining polypeptide after C-terminal domain is excluded Open table in a new tab Function of His6-WaaJ Derivatives in Vivo—To investigate the role of the C-terminal region in the activity of WaaJ, a series of constructs was created encoding WaaJ proteins with sequential C-terminal deletions. These deletions were designed to progressively remove the terminal α-helical domain enriched in basic and hydrophobic residues (Fig. 2A). In vivo WaaJ activity was assessed by the ability of the various constructs to complement the waaJ defect in E. coli CWG350 and to restore full-length core OS (Fig. 4, A and B). The waaJ mutant, E. coli CWG350, lacks two hexose residues from the outer core OS (Fig. 1) as follows: the Glc residue added by WaaJ and an additional residue attached to it by WaaD (6Kaniuk N.A. Vinogradov E. Li J. Monteiro M.A. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31237-31250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Expression of full-length His6-WaaJWT complemented the mutation and restored the expected PAGE profile of the LPS. Based on PAGE, His6-WaaJWT was able to fully restore core OS biosynthesis with basal expression levels, independent of addition of l-arabinose to induce gene expression from the pBAD18-based constructs (Fig. 4, A and B). Under these conditions, the level of expression of the His6-WaaJ derivatives was insufficient to allow their detection in whole-cell lysates (data not shown). C-terminal truncation had a marked effect on the ability of the mutant WaaJ proteins to complement the defect. The compromised activity was evident with even the shortest deletion (His6-WaaJΔ5). Furthermore, the efficiency of core OS extension declined with the larger deletions. The His6-WaaJΔ10, His6-WaaJΔ12, and His6-WaaJΔ15 proteins were only able to generate detectable extension of the core OS of E. coli CWG350 when the amount of the His6-WaaJ derivative in the cell was increased (Fig. 4C). This was achieved by elevating that level of gene expression by exploiting the l-arabinose-inducible pBAD promoter (16Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3978) Google Scholar). For example, His6-WaaJΔ15 showed ∼20% conversion of the waaJ mutant core OS to the wild-type product after induction in 0.02% arabinose, but no activity was detected with lower expression levels (i.e. less l-arabinose). WaaJΔC20, WaaJΔC30, and WaaJΔC37 were unable to complement at any l-arabinose concentration tested. There was no significant difference in the relative level of expression of the various plasmid-encoded WaaJ proteins in whole-cell lysates of transformed E. coli CWG350 waaJ::aacC1 cells (Fig. 4C). Similar observations were made for expression in E. coli derivatives TOP10 and BL21 (DE3) (data not shown). Overexpression and Subcellular Localization of His6-WaaJ Derivatives—The results from the complementation experiments could reflect altered association of the truncated proteins with the membrane where the acceptor (lipid A-core OS) resides. Analysis of the cellular distribution of His6-WaaJ indicated that ∼55% of the full-length protein was associated with the membrane fraction (Fig. 5). Removal of five residues resulted in an ∼10% reduction in membrane-associated protein. Deletions of 5–15 residues (i.e. within the predicted terminal α-helix) had no significant effect on this distribution. In contrast, C-terminal truncations exceeding 15 residues led to a progressive loss of protein from the membrane fractio"
