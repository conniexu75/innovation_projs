https://openalex.org/W2950629294,"Determining the pathogenicity of genetic variants is a critical challenge, and functional assessment is often the only option. Experimentally characterizing millions of possible missense variants in thousands of clinically important genes requires generalizable, scalable assays. We describe variant abundance by massively parallel sequencing (VAMP-seq), which measures the effects of thousands of missense variants of a protein on intracellular abundance simultaneously. We apply VAMP-seq to quantify the abundance of 7,801 single-amino-acid variants of PTEN and TPMT, proteins in which functional variants are clinically actionable. We identify 1,138 PTEN and 777 TPMT variants that result in low protein abundance, and may be pathogenic or alter drug metabolism, respectively. We observe selection for low-abundance PTEN variants in cancer, and show that p.Pro38Ser, which accounts for ~10% of PTEN missense variants in melanoma, functions via a dominant-negative mechanism. Finally, we demonstrate that VAMP-seq is applicable to other genes, highlighting its generalizability."

We analyzed genome-wide SNP data for asthma and allergic diseases in 33,593 cases and 76,768 controls of European ancestry from UK Biobank. Two publicly available independent genome-wide association studies were used for replication. We have found a strong genome-wide genetic correlation between asthma and allergic diseases (rg = 0.75, P = 6.84 × 10−62). Cross-trait analysis identified 38 genome-wide significant loci, including 7 novel shared loci. Computational analysis showed that shared genetic loci are enriched in immune/inflammatory systems and tissues with epithelium cells. Our work identifies common genetic architectures shared between asthma and allergy and will help to advance understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying co-morbid asthma and allergic diseases. Genome-wide cross-trait analysis shows a strong genetic correlation between asthma and allergic diseases. Shared susceptibility loci are enriched for genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses and genes expressed in epithelial tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2804088280,"The mammary gland is composed of basal cells and luminal cells. It is generally believed that the mammary gland arises from embryonic multipotent progenitors, but it remains unclear when lineage restriction occurs and what mechanisms are responsible for the switch from multipotency to unipotency during its morphogenesis. Here, we perform multicolour lineage tracing and assess the fate of single progenitors, and demonstrate the existence of a developmental switch from multipotency to unipotency during embryonic mammary gland development. Molecular profiling and single cell RNA-seq revealed that embryonic multipotent progenitors express a unique hybrid basal and luminal signature and the factors associated with the different lineages. Sustained p63 expression in embryonic multipotent progenitors promotes unipotent basal cell fate and was sufficient to reprogram adult luminal cells into basal cells by promoting an intermediate hybrid multipotent-like state. Altogether, this study identifies the timing and the mechanisms mediating early lineage segregation of multipotent progenitors during mammary gland development."
https://openalex.org/W2803983823,"Recent lineage tracing studies have revealed that mammary gland homeostasis relies on unipotent stem cells. However, whether and when lineage restriction occurs during embryonic mammary development, and which signals orchestrate cell fate specification, remain unknown. Using a combination of in vivo clonal analysis with whole mount immunofluorescence and mathematical modelling of clonal dynamics, we found that embryonic multipotent mammary cells become lineage-restricted surprisingly early in development, with evidence for unipotency as early as E12.5 and no statistically discernable bipotency after E15.5. To gain insights into the mechanisms governing the switch from multipotency to unipotency, we used gain-of-function Notch1 mice and demonstrated that Notch activation cell autonomously dictates luminal cell fate specification to both embryonic and basally committed mammary cells. These functional studies have important implications for understanding the signals underlying cell plasticity and serve to clarify how reactivation of embryonic programs in adult cells can lead to cancer. Lilja et al. report that multipotent mouse embryonic mammary cells become lineage restricted as early as embryonic day 12.5 during development in a potency switch regulated by Notch1 signalling."
https://openalex.org/W2804956073,"We evaluated the composition of individual clots retrieved during intra-arterial thrombectomy in relation to recanalization success, stroke subtype, and the presence of clot signs on initial brain images. We analyzed clot and interventional data from 145 retrieval trials performed for 37 patients (69.5±14.0 years, 20 men, large artery atherosclerosis, n = 7; cardioembolism, n = 22; undetermined etiology, n = 8) who had undergone intra-arterial thrombectomy. Rates of clot retrieval and successful recanalization (Arterial Occlusive Lesion score of 2-3) for separate retrieval trials were evaluated. The area occupied by red blood cell (RBC), fibrin/platelets, and white blood cell (WBC) was measured from digitized images of hematoxylin-eosin stained clots. Compositional differences were compared according to recanalization success, stroke subtype, and the presence of hyperdense clot sign on initial computed tomography and/or blooming artifact on magnetic resonance image. Of the 145 total retrieval trials (3.4±2.4 times per patient), clot was retrieved in 93 trials (64%), while recanalization was successful in 73 (50%). Fibrin/platelets (63%) occupied the greatest area in retrieved clots, followed by RBCs (33%) and WBCs (4%). Clots retrieved from successful recanalization exhibited higher RBC composition (37%) than those retrieved from non-recanalization trials (20%, p = 0.001). RBC composition was higher in cardioembolic stroke (38%) rather than large artery atherosclerosis (23%) and undetermined etiology (26%, p = 0.01). Clots exhibiting clot signs (40%) had higher RBC composition than those without clot signs (19%, p = 0.001). RBC-rich clots were associated with successful recanalization of intra-arterial thrombectomy, cardioembolic stroke, and the presence of clot-signs on initial brain images."
https://openalex.org/W2804112509,"New biotic stresses have emerged around the globe over the last decades threatening food safety and security. In 2016, scientists confirmed the presence of the devastating wheat-blast disease in Bangladesh, South Asia–its first occurrence outside South America. Severely blast-affected wheat fields had their grain yield wiped out. This poses a severe threat to food security in a densely-populated region with millions of poor inhabitants where wheat is a major staple crop and per capita wheat consumption has been increasing. As an ex ante impact assessment, this study examined potential wheat-blast scenarios in Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan. Based on the agro-climatic conditions in the epicenter, where the disease was first identified in Bangladesh in 2016, this study identified the correspondingly vulnerable areas in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh amounting to 7 million ha. Assuming a conservative scenario of 5–10% for blast-induced wheat production loss, this study estimated the annual potential wheat loss across the sampled countries to be 0.89–1.77 million tons, equivalent to USD 132–264 million. Such losses further threaten an already-precarious national food security, putting pressure on wheat imports and wheat prices. The study is a call for action to tackle the real wheat-blast threat in South Asia."
https://openalex.org/W2803422725,"Current therapeutics for hepatitis B virus (HBV) patients such as nucleoside analogs (NAs) are effective; however, new antiviral drugs against HBV are still desired. Since the interaction between the epsilon (ε) sequence of HBV pregenomic RNA and viral polymerase (Pol) is a key step in the HBV replication cycle, we aimed to identify small compounds for its inhibition, and established a pull-down assay system for the detection of ε-RNA-binding-Pol. Screening showed that 5 out of 3,965 compounds inhibited ε-Pol binding, and we identified rosmarinic acid, which exhibited specificity, as a potential antiviral agent. In order to examine the anti-HBV effects of rosmarinic acid, HBV-infected primary human hepatocytes from a humanized mouse liver were treated with rosmarinic acid. The rosmarinic acid treatment decreased HBV components including the amounts of extracellular HBV DNA with negligible cytotoxicity. We also investigated the combined effects of rosmarinic acid and the NA, lamivudine. rosmarinic acid slightly enhanced the anti-HBV activity of lamivudine, suggesting that the HBV replication step targeted by rosmarinic acid is distinct from that of NA. We analyzed an additional 25 rosmarinic acid derivatives, and found that 5 also inhibited ε-Pol. Structural comparisons between these derivatives implied that the ""two phenolic hydroxyl groups at both ends"" and the ""caffeic acid-like structure"" of rosmarinic acid are critical for the inhibition of ε-Pol binding. Collectively, our results demonstrate that rosmarinic acid inhibits HBV replication in HBV-infected cells by specifically targeting ε-Pol binding."
https://openalex.org/W2577555776,"This study investigates the effect of perceived discrimination on the mental health of Afghan refugees, and secondly, tests the distress moderating effects of pre-migration traumatic experiences and post-resettlement adjustment factors. In a cross-sectional design, 259 Afghans completed surveys assessing perceived discrimination and a number of other factors using scales developed through inductive techniques. Multivariable analyses consisted of a series of hierarchical regressions testing the effect of perceived discrimination on distress, followed by a sequential analysis of moderator variables. Perceived discrimination was significantly associated with higher distress, and this relationship was stronger among those with a strong intra-ethnic identity and high pre-resettlement traumatic experiences. The expected buffering effects of civic engagement, ethnic orientation (e.g. integration), and social support were not significant. Discrimination is a significant source of stress for Afghan refugees, which may exacerbate stresses associated with other pre- and post-migration stressors. Future research is needed to tailor interventions that can help mitigate the stress associated with discrimination among this highly vulnerable group."

https://openalex.org/W2804267567,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a devastating disease with poor prognosis. The pathogenic role of the lysophospholipid mediator sphingosine-1-phosphate and its receptor S1PR2 in lung fibrosis is unknown. We show here that genetic deletion of S1pr2 strikingly attenuated lung fibrosis induced by repeated injections of bleomycin in mice. We observed by using S1pr2LacZ/+ mice that S1PR2 was expressed in alveolar macrophages, vascular endothelial cells and alveolar epithelial cells in the lung and that S1PR2-expressing cells accumulated in the fibrotic legions. Bone marrow chimera experiments suggested that S1PR2 in bone marrow-derived cells contributes to the development of lung fibrosis. Depletion of macrophages greatly attenuated lung fibrosis. Bleomycin administration stimulated the mRNA expression of the profibrotic cytokines IL-13 and IL-4 and the M2 markers including arginase 1, Fizz1/Retnla, Ccl17 and Ccl24 in cells collected from broncho-alveolar lavage fluids (BALF), and S1pr2 deletion markedly diminished the stimulated expression of these genes. BALF cells from bleomycin-administered wild-type mice showed a marked increase in phosphorylation of STAT6, a transcription factor which is activated downstream of IL-13, compared with saline-administered wild-type mice. Interestingly, in bleomycin-administered S1pr2-/- mice, STAT6 phosphorylation in BALF cells was substantially diminished compared with wild-type mice. Finally, pharmacological S1PR2 blockade in S1pr2+/+ mice alleviated bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. Thus, S1PR2 facilitates lung fibrosis through the mechanisms involving augmentation of IL-13 expression and its signaling in BALF cells, and represents a novel target for treating lung fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2804109467,"Background Sepsis is now operationally defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by an infection, identified by an acute change in SOFA-Score of at least two points, including clinical chemistry such as creatinine or bilirubin concentrations. However, little knowledge exists about organ-specific microRNAs as potentially new biomarkers. Accordingly, we tested the hypotheses that micro-RNA-122, the foremost liver-related micro-RNA (miR), 1) discriminates between sepsis and infection, 2) is an early predictor for mortality, and 3) improves the prognostic value of the SOFA-score. Methods We analyzed 108 patients with sepsis (infection + increase SOFA-Score ≥2) within the first 24h of ICU admission and as controls 20 patients with infections without sepsis (infection + SOFA-Score ≤1). Total circulating miR was isolated from serum and relative miR-122 expression was measured (using spiked-in cel-miR-54) and associated with 30-day survival. Results 30-day survival of the sepsis patients was 63%. miR-122 expression was 40-fold higher in non-survivors (p = 0.001) and increased almost 6-fold in survivors (p = 0.013) compared to controls. miR-122 serum-expression discriminated both between sepsis vs. infection (AUC 0.760, sensitivity 58.3%, specificity 95%) and survivors vs. non-survivors (AUC 0.728, sensitivity 42.5%, specificity 94%). Multivariate Cox-regression analysis revealed miR-122 (HR 4.3; 95%-CI 2.0–8.9, p<0.001) as independent prognostic factor for 30-day mortality. Furthermore, the predictive value for 30-day mortality of the SOFA-Score (AUC 0.668) was improved by adding miR-122 (AUC 0.743; net reclassification improvement 0.37, p<0.001; integrated discrimination improvement 0.07, p = 0.007). Conclusions Increased miR-122 serum concentration supports the discrimination between infection and sepsis, is an early and independent risk factor for 30-day mortality, and improves the prognostic value of the SOFA-Score, suggesting a potential role for miR-122 in sepsis-related prediction models."
https://openalex.org/W2804201529,"Protein folding in the cell is regulated by several quality-control mechanisms. Correct folding of glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is tightly monitored by the recognition of glycan signals by lectins in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. In mammals, mannose trimming from N-glycans is crucial for disposal of misfolded glycoproteins. The mannosidases responsible for this process are ER mannosidase I and ER degradation–enhancing α-mannosidase–like proteins (EDEMs). However, the molecular mechanism of mannose removal by EDEMs remains unclear, partly owing to the difficulty of reconstituting mannosidase activity in vitro. Here, our analysis of EDEM3-mediated mannose-trimming activity on a misfolded glycoprotein revealed that ERp46, an ER-resident oxidoreductase, associates stably with EDEM3. This interaction, which depended on the redox activity of ERp46, involved formation of a disulfide bond between the cysteine residues of the ERp46 redox-active sites and the EDEM3 α-mannosidase domain. In a defined in vitro system consisting of recombinant proteins purified from HEK293 cells, the mannose-trimming activity of EDEM3 toward the model misfolded substrate, the glycoprotein T-cell receptor α locus (TCRα), was reconstituted only when ERp46 had established a covalent interaction with EDEM3. On the basis of these findings, we propose that disposal of misfolded glycoproteins through mannose trimming is tightly connected to redox-mediated regulation in the ER.

Mannose is trimmed from N-glycans by α1,2-mannosidases (glycoside hydrolase family 47) in the ER. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the mechanism of creation of the glycan moiety critical for glycoprotein ERAD has been elucidated (11Xie W. Ng D.T. ERAD substrate recognition in budding yeast.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2010; 21 (20178855): 533-53910.1016/j.semcdb.2010.02.007Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). First, the mannose is trimmed from the middle branch (branch B) of the Man9GlcNAc2 glycan (M9), forming Man8GlcNAc2 isomer B (M8B) (Fig. S1). Next, the terminal mannose on branch C is removed from the M8B glycan, yielding Man7GlcNAc2 isomer A (M7A), which serves as the glycan signal for degradation. Mns1p, a homologue of mammalian ER mannosidase I (ERManI), catalyzes the first step of creation of M8B, followed by trimming by Htm1p/Mnl1p, the homologue of mammalian EDEMs, to yield M7A. Sequential demannosylation is thought to ensure protein quality control by allowing enough time for nascent polypeptides to fold (12Helenius A.

Among the three mammalian EDEMs, EDEM3 has a mannose-trimming activity that is readily detected when the protein is expressed in cultured cells (16Hirao K. Natsuka Y. Tamura T. Wada I. Morito D. Natsuka S. Romero P. Sleno B. Tremblay L.O. Herscovics A. Nagata K. Hosokawa N.

However, because the mannose-trimming activity of EDEM3 has not been successfully detected in vitro, it remains unclear how the reaction takes place in the ER by EDEM3. In this study, we searched for proteins that interact with and regulate the mannosidase activity of EDEM3. We identified the oxidoreductase ERp46 (ER-resident protein 46) as a binding partner that accelerates the mannose-trimming activity of EDEM3 in vivo. By purifying recombinant proteins from HEK293 cells, we succeeded in analyzing the demannosylation activity of EDEM3 in vitro. We found that ERp46 triggers the mannose trimming of EDEM3 in vitro and that this effect requires a covalent interaction between the two proteins, most probably involving mixed disulfide bond formation. Our findings suggest that mammalian EDEM3 is the mannosidase that generates the glycan signal on glycoproteins that is crucial for ERAD and that interaction with ERp46 through its redox-active sites is required for this process. To identify proteins that regulate the mannose-trimming activity of EDEM3, we first searched for proteins that associate with EDEM3. For this purpose, we expressed FLAG-tagged EDEM3 in HEK293 cells, immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody, and then separated the co-immunoprecipitated proteins by SDS-PAGE, followed by silver staining (Fig. 1A). A ∼50-kDa protein that associated with EDEM3 (Fig. 1A, arrowhead) was identified by MS analysis as ERp46, a member of the PDI family (22Appenzeller-Herzog C. Ellgaard L. The human PDI family: versatility packed into a single fold.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1783 (18093543): 535-54810.1016/j.bbamcr.2007.11.010Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 28Kozlov G.

When oxidoreductases ERp46, P5, and PDI were co-expressed with EDEM3, ERp46 was specifically associated with EDEM3, whereas P5 and PDI were not (Fig. 1B and Fig. S2). ERManI (ERM in Fig. 1) was included in the experiment because its co-expression with EDEM3 promotes mannose trimming from misfolded glycoproteins (31Fujimori T. Kamiya Y. Nagata K. Kato K. Hosokawa N. Endoplasmic reticulum lectin XTP3-B inhibits endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation of a misfolded α1-antitrypsin variant.FEBS J. 2013; 280 (23356641): 1563-157510.1111/febs.12157Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of ERp46 on the mannose-trimming activity of EDEM3, we transfected HEK293 cells with ATZ, the Z variant of α1-antitrypsin, which misfolds and is retained in the ER. ATZ has three N-glycans, and thus, we evaluated their demannosylation by the mobility shift on SDS-PAGE. Consistent with our previous report (16Hirao K. Natsuka Y. Tamura T. Wada I. Morito D. Natsuka S. Romero P. Sleno B. Tremblay L.O. Herscovics A. Nagata K. Hosokawa N. EDEM3, a soluble EDEM homolog, enhances glycoprotein endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation and mannose trimming.J. Biol.

Co-expression of ERp46 with EDEM3 further enhanced mannose processing from ATZ (Fig. 1C, lanes 7–9). ATZ co-immunoprecipitated with both EDEM3 and ERp46 (Fig. 1C (small arrow) and Fig. S3). Collectively, these data suggest that ERp46 interacts specifically with EDEM3 and promotes the mannose-trimming activity of EDEM3 in vivo. PDI family proteins, which have multiple thioredoxin-like domains containing CXXC redox-active sequences, promote the formation and exchange of disulfide bonds in nascent polypeptides synthesized in the ER (22Appenzeller-Herzog C.

Mature EDEM3 contains nine Cys residues (Fig. S4). To examine the redox state of EDEM3, we resolved cell lysates under nonreducing conditions. EDEM3 migrated as two discrete bands (Fig. 2B, lane 2), and we noticed that the slower migrating band disappeared under reducing conditions. Hence, we assigned the corresponding signal as the oxidized (Ox) and the faster migrating band as the reduced (Red) form, respectively (Fig. S5; see Fig. 3 as discussed below). Interestingly, when EDEM3 was co-expressed with ERp46, the level of reduced EDEM3 decreased, and EDEM3-containing complexes appeared (Fig. 2B, lane 3, open arrowheads), but this effect was not observed when EDEM was co-expressed with PDI or P5. Co-expression of P5 and PDI did not alter the Ox/Red ratio of EDEM3 (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 4 and 5 with lane 2). Furthermore, in cells expressing P5 and PDI, the levels of high-molecular weight EDEM3-containing complexes were elevated, probably due to up-regulation of ER oxidation capacity by overexpression of P5 and PDI (Fig. 2B, bracket). However, in contrast to ERp46-transfected cells, no distinct EDEM3-containing complexes were detected.Figure 3ERp46 covalently associates with the mannosidase domain of EDEM3.

To determine whether the oxidoreductase activity of ERp46 is required to alter the redox state of EDEM3, we co-expressed ERp46 mutants with EDEM3 and analyzed them by Western blotting (Fig. 2, C and D). The CXXA mutant contains three CGHA motifs in place of the WT CGHC motifs. We assumed that this mutant lacked the isomerase activity (i.e. the ability to exchange disulfides) (32Schwaller M. Wilkinson B. Gilbert H.F. Reduction-reoxidation cycles contribute to catalysis of disulfide isomerization by protein-disulfide isomerase.J. Biol.

Melo E.P. Yang Y. Wahlander Å. Neubert T.A. Ron D. Oxidative protein folding by an endoplasmic reticulum-localized peroxiredoxin.Mol.

Remarkably, the ERp46 CXXA mutant trapped all of the EDEM3 protein into high-molecular weight complexes, resulting in the disappearance of EDEM3 monomer (Fig. 2D, lane 4). On the other hand, the ERp46 AXXA mutant, in which all three redox-active sites were replaced by AGHA, did not affect the redox state of EDEM3, similar to what was observed in cells expressing only EDEM3 (Fig. 2D, compare lane 5 with lane 2). Collectively, these results suggest that ERp46 causes a specific change in the redox state of EDEM3 via its oxidoreductase activity. To determine whether the oxidoreductase activity of ERp46 is required for its interaction with EDEM3, we co-expressed EDEM3 and WT ERp46 or its redox-active site mutants. WT ERp46 and CXXA mutant co-immunoprecipitated with EDEM3, whereas the ERp46 AXXA mutant did not (Fig. 2E, lanes 5–8). In cells co-expressing the CXXA mutant, all of the EDEM3 formed disulfide-bonded complexes, which were detected by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 2F, lane 7, open arrowheads). In WT ERp46-expressing cells, similar disulfide-bonded complexes were detected in addition to the EDEM3 monomer (Fig. 2F, lane 6), indicating that the interaction of ERp46 with EDEM3 depends on the redox-active sites of ERp46. ERp46 was present in these covalently associated complexes (Fig. 2G, gray arrows). These results suggest that ERp46 associates with EDEM3 by forming disulfide bonds through the redox-active sites. Mammalian EDEM3 has an α-mannosidase domain at the N terminus that contains four Cys residues (Fig. S4). A structural model of the EDEM3 α-mannosidase domain based on the crystallographic structure of human ERManI suggests that two Cys residues, Cys83 and Cys442, are close to each other (Fig. 3A). Because recombinant EDEM3 α-mannosidase domain purified from bacteria can adopt either the oxidized or reduced conformation, depending on the redox conditions, 3I. Wada and N. Hosokawa, unpublished observations. we predicted that Cys83 and Cys442 form a disulfide bond in the ER. As expected, all three EDEM3 mutants in which Ser replaced Cys83 and/or Cys442 (C83S, C442S, and C83S/C442S) adopted only the reduced conformation (Fig. 3, B and C), even in cells co-expressing ERp46. The high-molecular weight disulfide-bonded complexes of EDEM3 were present only in cells expressing WT EDEM3 (Fig. 3C, open arrowheads). The stability of EDEM3 C83S/C442S mutant was similar to that of WT EDEM3 (Fig. 4A (IP: HA) and Fig. S6), suggesting that these mutations did not cause gross misfolding. We next analyzed the association of ERp46 with the Cys mutants in the EDEM3 α-mannosidase domain. ERp46 co-immunoprecipitated only with WT EDEM3 (Fig. 3D, lane 5), indicating that both Cys83 and Cys442 are required for the interaction. As in Fig. 3C, the covalent complex was detected only in lysates from WT EDEM3-expressing cells resolved under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 3, E and F, open arrowheads). These data suggest that ERp46 forms a disulfide bond between Cys83 and Cys442 in the α-mannosidase domain of EDEM3. To examine the effect of Cys mutation on the mannose-trimming and ERAD-enhancing activities of EDEM3, we transfected HEK293 cells with terminally misfolded glycoprotein NHK, a variant of α1-antitrypsin. Mobility shift of NHK on SDS-PAGE revealed that demannosylation activity was strongly promoted by co-expression of WT EDEM3 (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 4–6 with lanes 1–3) (16Hirao K. Natsuka Y. Tamura T. Wada I. Morito D. Natsuka S. Romero P. Sleno B. Tremblay L.O. Herscovics A. Nagata K. Hosokawa N. EDEM3, a soluble EDEM homolog, enhances glycoprotein endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation and mannose trimming.J. Biol.

However, co-transfection of the EDEM3 Cys mutants described above did not alter the electrophoretic mobility of NHK as the WT did (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 7–12 with lanes 1–3). Measurements of the rate of disappearance of NHK from cells (Fig. 4A, quantified in B) revealed that the EDEM3 Cys mutations abolished the ERAD-promoting activity of EDEM3. In addition, the D294N mutant of EDEM3, which corresponds to a mutation in proton donor Asp-463 of human ERManI, exhibited no mannose-processing or ERAD-promoting activity (Fig. 4, C and D). Collectively, these findings show that Cys83 and Cys442 in the EDEM3 α-mannosidase domain are necessary for the mannose-trimming and subsequent ERAD-promoting activity of EDEM3. To clarify the molecular mechanism by which ERp46 promotes the mannose-trimming activity of EDEM3, we monitored mannose removal from misfolded glycoprotein TCRα in vitro. TCRα is a glycoprotein with four N-glycans that is degraded rapidly by ERAD when expressed in cells. FLAG-tagged TCRα was purified from HEK293 cells using FLAG-agarose beads followed by FLAG-peptide elution. To purify recombinant EDEM3 and ERp46, EDEM3-FLAG was expressed in HEK293 cells with or without ERp46-FLAG. After incubating the purified proteins at 37 °C, mannose trimming of TCRα was monitored by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5A). When EDEM3 was co-purified with ERp46, mannose trimming from TCRα was clearly detected even after 1 h of incubation (Fig. 5A, lane 2), whereas in samples containing only EDEM3, demannosylation was only faintly detected even after 24 h (Fig. 5A, lane 13). The addition of kifunensine, an inhibitor of processing α1,2-mannosidases, completely inhibited the mannose removal from TCRα (Fig. 5A, Kifunensine +). CBB staining of the recombinant proteins revealed that the amounts of EDEM3 and ERp46 purified were ∼2.5 and ∼3.5 μg, respectively, corresponding to final concentrations of ∼15 and ∼20 μg/ml, respectively (Fig. 5B). TCRα migrated at the same position after removal of the N-glycans by PNGase F treatment (Fig. 5C, compare lane 2 with lane 4), indicating that the electrophoretic mobility shift of TCRα was the result of N-glycan trimming. Next, we analyzed the mannose-trimming activity of EDEM3 D294N and C83S/C442S mutants in vitro. This analysis confirmed that the mutants lacked enzyme activity even in the presence of ERp46 (Fig. 5D). We then tested the requirement for divalent cations and ATP in vitro (Fig. 5E). Ca2+ was necessary for the mannosidase activity of EDEM3, whereas Mn2+ was not. ATP did not affect the mannose-trimming activity of EDEM3. It should be noted that decrease of TCRα signal in Fig. 5E was not reproduced in other experiments, suggesting that the observed loss was caused by a contamination of nonspecific ATP-dependent or regulatable proteases. The amounts of recombinant proteins in all reactions were monitored by CBB staining (Fig. S7). We next investigated how redox conditions influence EDEM3 manno"

Previous research has shown that improving knowledge, providing feedback on past behaviour and targeting social norms are promising approaches to improve hand hygiene practices. The present field experiment was designed to direct people on when to perform hand hygiene and prevent forgetfulness. This intervention is the first to examine the effect of inducing injunctive social norms via an emoticon-based feedback system on hand hygiene behaviour. Electronic monitoring and feedback devices were installed in hospital patient rooms on top of hand-rub dispensers, next to the doorway, for a period of 17 weeks. In the emoticon condition, screens at the devices activated whenever a person entered or exited the room. Before using the alcohol-based hand-rub dispenser, a frowny face was displayed, indicating that hand hygiene should be performed. If the dispenser was subsequently used, this picture changed to a smiley face to positively reinforce the correct behaviour. Hand hygiene behaviour in the emoticon rooms significantly outperformed the behaviour in three other tested conditions. The strong effect in this field experiment indicates that activating injunctive norms may be a promising approach to improve hand hygiene behaviour. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed."

Amyloid β (Aβ), a component of drusen, may promote complement activation by inhibiting CFI bioactivity. We determined whether Aβ reduced CFI bioactivity and whether antibodies against Aβ including a monoclonal antibody, GSK933776 could restore CFI bioactivity. We also measured CFI bioactivity in plasma of subjects with AMD and AD. In support of the GSK933776 development program in AMD (geographic atrophy), we developed a quantitative assay to measure CFI bioactivity based on its ability to cleave C3b to iC3b, and repeated it in presence or absence of Aβ and anti-Aβ antibodies. Using this assay, we measured CFI bioactivity in plasma of 194 subjects with AMD, and in samples from subjects with AD that had been treated with GSK933776 as part of the GSK933776 development program in AD. Aβ reduced the CFI bioactivity by 5-fold and pre-incubation with GSK933776 restored CFI bioactivity. In subjects with AMD, plasma CFI levels and bioactivity were not significantly different from non-AMD controls. However, we detected a positive linear trend, suggesting increasing activity with disease severity. In subjects with AD, we observed a 10% and 27% increase in overall CFI bioactivity after treatment with GSK933776 during the second and third dose. Our studies indicate that CFI enzymatic activity can be inhibited by Aβ and be altered in proinflammatory diseases such as AMD and AD, in which deposition of Aβ and activation of the alternative complement cascade are believed to play a key role in the disease process."

Each binding site is composed of a principal face provided by one subunit, which contributes three loops, named A, B and C, and a complementary face provided by the adjacent subunit, which contributes loops D, E, and F (10Sine S.M.

The homomeric α7 receptor has five identical ACh-binding sites; however, ACh occupancy of only one site is enough for activation (12Andersen N. Corradi J. Sine S.M. Bouzat C.

The α7 receptor subunit gene, CHRNA7, has 10 exons and is located on the long arm of chromosome 15 (15q13–q14). A hybrid gene, CHRFAM7A, has arisen from a relatively recent partial duplication that comprises exons 5 to 10 of the CHRNA7 gene and is positioned in the same chromosome, centromeric to the CHRNA7 gene by 1.6 Mb, interrupting the genetic element FAM7A. Interestingly, the CHRFAM7A gene is human specific (6Sinkus M.L. Graw S. Freedman R. Ross R.G. Lester H.A. Leonard S.

The final protein, dupα7, is a truncated receptor subunit that lacks the first 95 amino acid residues of the α7 protein, which includes loops D and A of the agonist-binding site, and instead contains 27 amino acid residues from FAM7A at the N-terminal domain (15Costantini T.W.

The CHRFAM7A gene is located in a complex region on chromosome 15 that includes many segmental, highly variable, duplications that result in several different copy number variants. These multiple polymorphisms are associated with the risk to develop several neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism, and idiopathic epilepsies (16Flomen R.H.

These findings suggest that the duplicated isoform might have a role in the immune system and cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway.

The dupα7 subunit has been expressed heterologously in mammalian cell lines and Xenopus oocytes in a few studies.

The stoichiometry of these hybrid receptors and their function remain unknown. To find a way to identify the possible pentameric α7/dupα7 arrangements and determine their functional signature, we combined cell expression and single-channel recordings with the electrical fingerprinting strategy (12Andersen N.

Receptors were generated using combinations of α7 and dupα7 subunits, one of which carries a reporter conductance mutation that allows defining the subunit stoichiometry of the receptor that originated each single-channel opening event in real time. Our results provide novel information about the function of the duplicated α7 subunit, which may have a significant role in immunomodulation and in the pathophysiology of neurological disorders. The cloned dupα7 cDNA includes the 1236-nucleotide sequence previously deposited in NCBI and corresponds to the CHRFAM7A isoform 1 (accession number NM_139320). The initiator methionine in exon B of CHRFAM7A will produce a protein including amino acid residues coded by part of exon B, exon A of the FAM7A gene, and exons 5–10 of CHRNA7 (Fig. 1A). The final protein contains the N-terminal domain with 27 residues of FAM7A followed by the α7 sequence starting at amino acid residue 96 and therefore lacks loop A and D of the ACh-binding site (Fig. 1A). To establish that the cloned dupα7 cDNA is translated into the truncated subunit in our system, BOSC-23 cells were transfected with plasmid vectors containing either dupα7 or α7 cDNAs together with plasmids encoding the chaperone proteins, Ric-3 and NACHO in a 2:1:1 molar ratio, respectively. The expression of α7 and dupα7 subunit proteins was detected by Western blotting from whole cell lysates using a previously characterized antibody raised against the intracellular M3–M4 loop that is common to both subunits (27Gotti C.

Western blotting revealed bands in the 55–57-kDa range in α7 expressing cells and in a lower molecular mass range (45–50 kDa) in those transfected with dupα7 cDNA. These bands, which were not detected in nontransfected cells, are compatible with the expected molecular weights of both subunits (Fig. 1B) (18Villiger Y. Szanto I. Jaconi S. Blanchet C. Buisson B.

Thus, our Western blotting results confirm that dupα7 is transcribed and translated in our heterologous expression system. To detect the presence of surface receptors, transfected cells were labeled by Alexa Fluor 488/α-BTX, a selective α7 antagonist, and examined by confocal microscopy.

Analysis of the membrane fluorescence intensity revealed reduced fluorescence in cells that co-expressed dupα7 with α7 (α7:dupα7 1:3 cDNA subunit ratio) with respect to those expressing α7 (Fig. 2). To examine function, α7 or dupα7 were expressed in BOSC-23 cells and examined by single-channel recordings. In the presence of 100–500 μm ACh, α7 exhibits single brief openings (∼0.25 ms) flanked by long closings, or less often, few openings in quick succession, known as bursts (Fig. 3A, Table 1) (5Corradi J.

https://openalex.org/W2803389808,"Several network features and information retrieval methods have been proposed to elucidate the structure of citation networks and to detect important nodes. However, it is difficult to retrieve information related to trends in an academic field and to detect cutting-edge areas from the citation network. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that detects the trend as the growth direction of a citation network using network representation learning(NRL). We presume that the linear growth of citation network in latent space obtained by NRL is the result of the iterative edge additional process of a citation network. On APS datasets and papers of some domains of the Web of Science, we confirm the existence of trends by observing that an academic field grows in a specific direction linearly in latent space. Next, we calculate each node’s degree of trend-following as an indicator called the intrinsic publication year (IPY). As a result, there is a correlation between the indicator and the number of future citations. Furthermore, a word frequently used in the abstracts of cutting-edge papers (high-IPY paper) is likely to be used often in future publications. These results confirm the validity of the detected trend for predicting citation network growth."
https://openalex.org/W2804426591,"In commercial aviation, fatigue is defined as a physiological state of reduced mental or physical performance capability resulting from sleep loss, extended wakefulness, circadian phase, and/or workload. The International Civil Aviation Organisation mandates that responsibility for fatigue risk management is shared between airline management, pilots, and support staff. However, to date, the majority of research relating to fatigue mitigations in long range operations has focused on the mitigations required or recommended by regulators and operators. Little research attention has been paid to the views or operational experience of the pilots who use these (or other) mitigations. This study focused on pilots’ views and experiences of in-flight sleep as the primary fatigue mitigation on long range flights. It also sought information about other fatigue mitigation strategies they use. Thematic analysis was used to explore written comments from diary and survey data collected during long range and ultra-long range trips (N = 291 pilots on three different aircraft types, 17 different out-and-back trips, and four airlines based on three continents). The findings indicate that the recommended fatigue mitigation strategies on long-haul flights (particularly in-flight sleep) are effective and well-utilised, consistent with quantitative findings from the same trips. Importantly however, the analyses also highlight areas that require further investigation, including flight preparation strategies in relation to the uncertainty of in-flight break allocation. There were two strategies for sleep prior to a flight: maximising sleep if pilots were expecting later breaks in the flight; or minimising sleep if they were expecting breaks earlier or at unfavourable times in the circadian cycle. They also provide a broader view of the factors that affect the amount and quality of pilots’ in-flight sleep, about which evidence has previously been largely anecdotal. The study underscores the value of including the views and experience of pilots in fatigue risk management."
https://openalex.org/W2803734785,"The energy-growth nexus has important policy implications for economic development. The results from many past studies that investigated the causality direction of this nexus can lead to misleading policy guidance. Using data on China from 1953 to 2013, this study shows that an application of causality test on the time series of energy consumption and national output has masked a lot of information. The Toda-Yamamoto test with bootstrapped critical values and the newly proposed non-linear causality test reveal no causal relationship. However, a further application of these tests using series in different time-frequency domain obtained from wavelet decomposition indicates that while energy consumption Granger causes economic growth in the short run, the reverse is true in the medium term. A bidirectional causal relationship is found for the long run. This approach has proven to be superior in unveiling information on the energy-growth nexus that are useful for policy planning over different time horizons."

Methods Eighteen women were tested beginning at the 12th week of gestation at six time-points throughout pregnancy and six weeks postpartum. Heart rate, heart rate variability, blood pressure, pulse transit time (PTT), respiration, and baroreceptor sensitivity were analyzed in resting conditions. Additionally, hemoglobin, asymmetric and symmetric dimethylarginine and Endothelin (ET-1) were obtained. Results Heart rate and sympathovagal balance favoring sympathetic drive increased, the vagal tone and the baroreflex sensitivity decreased during pregnancy. Relative sympathetic drive (sympathovagal balance) reached a maximum at 6 weeks postpartum whereas the other variables did not differ compared to first trimester levels. Postpartum diastolic blood pressure was higher compared to first and second trimester. Pulse transit time and endothelial markers showed no difference throughout gestation. However, opposing variables PTT and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) were both higher six weeks postpartum. Conclusions The sympathetic up regulation throughout pregnancy goes hand in hand with a decreased baroreflex sensitivity. In the postpartum period, the autonomic nervous system, biochemical endothelial reactions and PTT show significant and opposing changes compared to pregnancy findings, indicating the complex aftermath of the increase of blood volume, the changes in perfusion strategies and blood pressure regulation that occur in pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W2804766403,"Translocated in liposarcoma (TLS) is an RNA-binding protein and a transcription-regulatory sensor of DNA damage. TLS binds promoter-associated noncoding RNA (pncRNA) and inhibits histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity of CREB-binding protein (CBP)/E1A-binding protein P300 (p300) on the cyclin D1 (CCND1) gene. Although post-translational modifications of TLS, such as arginine methylation, are known to regulate TLS's nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and assembly in stress granules, its interactions with RNAs remain poorly characterized. Herein, using various biochemical assays, we confirmed the earlier observations that TLS is methylated by protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) in vitro. The arginine methylation of TLS disrupted binding to pncRNA and also prevented binding of TLS to and inhibition of CBP/p300. This result indicated that arginine methylation of TLS abrogates both binding to pncRNA and TLS-mediated inhibition of CBP/p300 HAT activities. We also report that an arginine residue within the Arg–Gly–Gly domain of TLS, Arg-476, serves as the major determinant for binding to pncRNA. Either methylation or mutation of Arg-476 of TLS significantly decreased pncRNA binding and thereby prevented a pncRNA-induced allosteric alteration in TLS that is required for its interaction with CBP/p300. Moreover, unlike WT TLS, an R476A TLS mutant did not inhibit CCND1 promoter activity in luciferase reporter assays. Taken together, we propose the hypothesis that arginine methylation of TLS regulates both TLS–nucleic acid and TLS–protein interactions and thereby participates in transcriptional regulation.

https://openalex.org/W2804501766,"Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are trimeric proton-gated cation permeable ion channels expressed primarily in neurons. Here we employed site-directed mutagenesis and electrophysiology to investigate the mechanism of inhibition of ASIC1a by diminazene. This compound inhibits mouse ASIC1a with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 2.4 μM. At first, we examined whether neutralizing mutations of Glu79 and Glu416 alter diminazene block. These residues form a hexagonal array in the lower palm domain that was previously shown to contribute to pore opening in response to extracellular acidification. Significantly, single Gln substitutions at positions 79 and 416 in ASIC1a reduced diminazene apparent affinity by 6–7 fold. This result suggests that diminazene inhibits ASIC1a in part by limiting conformational rearrangement in the lower palm domain. Because diminazene is charged at physiological pHs, we assessed whether it inhibits ASIC1a by blocking the ion channel pore. Consistent with the notion that diminazene binds to a site within the membrane electric field, diminazene block showed a strong dependence with the membrane potential. Moreover, a Gly to Ala mutation at position 438, in the ion conduction pathway of ASIC1a, increased diminazene IC50 by one order of magnitude and eliminated the voltage dependence of block. Taken together, our results indicate that the inhibition of ASIC1a by diminazene involves both allosteric modulation and blocking of ion flow through the conduction pathway. Our findings provide a foundation for the development of more selective and potent ASIC pore blockers."

For example, ion channels are dynamically relocalized to or from the plasma membrane in response to physiological alterations, allowing cells and organisms to maintain osmotic and salt homeostasis. To identify additional factors that regulate the selective trafficking of a specific ion channel, we used a yeast model for a mammalian potassium channel, the K+ inward rectifying channel Kir2.1. Kir2.1 maintains potassium homeostasis in heart muscle cells, and Kir2.1 defects lead to human disease. By examining the ability of Kir2.1 to rescue the growth of yeast cells lacking endogenous potassium channels, we discovered that specific α-arrestins regulate Kir2.1 localization. Specifically, we found that the Ldb19/Art1, Aly1/Art6, and Aly2/Art3 α-arrestin adaptor proteins promote Kir2.1 trafficking to the cell surface, increase Kir2.1 activity at the plasma membrane, and raise intracellular potassium levels. To better quantify the intracellular and cell-surface populations of Kir2.1, we created fluorogen-activating protein fusions and for the first time used this technique to measure the cell-surface residency of a plasma membrane protein in yeast. Our experiments revealed that two α-arrestin effectors also control Kir2.1 localization. In particular, both the Rsp5 ubiquitin ligase and the protein phosphatase calcineurin facilitated the α-arrestin–mediated trafficking of Kir2.1.

https://openalex.org/W2804806832,"3-Hydroxyanthranilate 3,4-dioxygenase (HAO) is an iron-dependent protein that activates O2 and inserts both oxygen atoms into 3-hydroxyanthranilate (3-HAA). An intriguing question is how HAO can rapidly bind O2, even though local O2 concentrations and diffusion rates are relatively low. Here, a close inspection of the HAO structures revealed that substrate- and inhibitor-bound structures exhibit a closed conformation with three hydrophobic loop regions moving toward the catalytic iron center, whereas the ligand-free structure is open. We hypothesized that these loop movements enhance O2 binding to the binary complex of HAO and 3-HAA. We found that the carboxyl end of 3-HAA triggers changes in two loop regions and that the third loop movement appears to be driven by an H-bond interaction between Asn27 and Ile142. Mutational analyses revealed that N27A, I142A, and I142P variants cannot form a closed conformation, and steady-state kinetic assays indicated that these variants have a substantially higher Km for O2 than WT HAO. This observation suggested enhanced hydrophobicity at the iron center resulting from the concerted loop movements after the binding of the primary substrate, which is hydrophilic. Given that O2 is nonpolar, the increased hydrophobicity at the iron center of the binary complex appears to be essential for rapid O2 binding and activation, explaining the reason for the 3-HAA–induced loop movements. Because substrate binding-induced open-to-closed conformational changes are common, the results reported here may help further our understanding of how oxygen is enriched in nonheme iron-dependent dioxygenases. 3-Hydroxyanthranilate 3,4-dioxygenase (HAO) is an iron-dependent protein that activates O2 and inserts both oxygen atoms into 3-hydroxyanthranilate (3-HAA).

We present a detailed study of Ultrafast Extreme Events in stock market data. In contrast to popular belief, our analysis suggests that most of the Ultrafast Extreme Events are not necessarily due to feedbacks in High Frequency Trading: In at least 60 percent of the observed Ultrafast Extreme Events, the largest fraction of the price change is due to a single market order. In times of financial crisis, large market orders are more likely which leads to a significant increase of Ultrafast Extreme Events occurrences. Furthermore, we analyze the 100 trades following each Ultrafast Extreme Events. While we observe a tendency of the prices to partially recover, less than 40 percent recover completely. On the other hand we find 25 percent of the Ultrafast Extreme Events to be almost recovered after only one trade which differs from the usually found price impact of market orders."
https://openalex.org/W2803439471,"Background Although many previous studies have examined the determinants of happiness in older adults, few have investigated the association between pension types and happiness. When compared to other conventional socioeconomic indicators, pension types may be more indicative of long-term socioeconomic status as they can reflect a person’s job history over their life course. This study examined the association between pension types and happiness in Japanese older people. Methods Cross-sectional survey data from the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study were used to analyze the association between pension types and happiness. The study population comprised 120152 participants from 2013. We calculated the prevalence ratios of happiness for the different pension types using Poisson regression models that controlled for age, sex, marital status, equivalent income, wealth, education level, working status, occupation, depression, and social support. Results After controlling for socioeconomic indicators, the prevalence ratios (95% confidence intervals) of happiness for no pension benefits, low pension benefits, and moderate pension benefits relative to high pension benefits were 0.77 (0.73–0.81), 0.95 (0.94–0.97), and 0.98 (0.97–0.99), respectively. However, the inclusion of depression as a covariate weakened the association between pension types and happiness. Conclusions While pension types were associated with happiness after adjusting for other proxy measures of socioeconomic status, the association diminished following adjustment for depression. Pension types may provide rich information on socioeconomic status and depression throughout the course of life. In addition to conventional socioeconomic indicators, pension types should also be considered when assessing the determinants of happiness in older adults."
https://openalex.org/W2803808832,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to enhance cognitive performance on a variety of tasks. It is hypothesized that tDCS enhances performance by affecting task related cortical excitability changes in networks underlying or connected to the site of stimulation facilitating long term potentiation. However, many recent studies have called into question the reliability and efficacy of tDCS to induce modulatory changes in brain activity. In this study, our goal is to investigate the individual differences in tDCS induced modulatory effects on brain activity related to the degree of enhancement in performance, providing insight into this lack of reliability. In accomplishing this goal, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) concurrently with tDCS stimulation (1 mA, 30 minutes duration) using a visual search task simulating real world conditions. The experiment consisted of three fMRI sessions: pre-training (no performance feedback), training (performance feedback which included response accuracy and target location and either real tDCS or sham stimulation given), and post-training (no performance feedback). The right posterior parietal cortex was selected as the site of anodal tDCS based on its known role in visual search and spatial attention processing. Our results identified a region in the right precentral gyrus, known to be involved with visual spatial attention and orienting, that showed tDCS induced task related changes in cortical excitability that were associated with individual differences in improved performance. This same region showed greater activity during the training session for target feedback of incorrect (target-error feedback) over correct trials for the tDCS stim over sham group indicating greater attention to target features during training feedback when trials were incorrect. These results give important insight into the nature of neural excitability induced by tDCS as it relates to variability in individual differences in improved performance shedding some light the apparent lack of reliability found in tDCS research."

This study aimed to analyze the aesthetic outcome and changes in flap volume in patients with breast cancer undergoing radiation therapy of the surgical site after immediate autologous tissue reconstruction. Methods Immediate abdominal free flap breast reconstruction following unilateral mastectomy was performed in 42 patients; 21 patients received adjuvant radiation (study group) and 21 patients did not (control group). To compare flap volume, three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) was performed before and after radiation. Also, aesthetic analysis was performed in both groups to evaluate shape changes. Results There was a 12.3% flap volume reduction after the completion of radiation in the experimental group that was significantly greater than the 2.6% volume reduction observed in the non-radiation group (P<0.01). There was no significant difference in the short- and long-term aesthetic results between the groups. Conclusions When performing immediate autologous breast reconstruction, 14% volume overcorrection is recommended for patients in whom adjuvant radiation therapy is anticipated to improve aesthetic outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2803643873,"Factors that limit African lion populations are manifold and well-recognized, but their relative demographic effects remain poorly understood, particularly trophy hunting near protected areas. We identified and monitored 386 individual lions within and around South Luangwa National Park, Zambia, for five years (2008–2012) with trophy hunting and for three additional years (2013–2015) during a hunting moratorium. We used these data with mark-resight models to estimate the effects of hunting on lion survival, recruitment, and abundance. The best survival models, accounting for imperfect detection, revealed strong positive effects of the moratorium, with survival increasing by 17.1 and 14.0 percentage points in subadult and adult males, respectively. Smaller effects on adult female survival and positive effects on cub survival were also detected. The sex-ratio of cubs shifted from unbiased during trophy-hunting to female-biased during the moratorium. Closed mark-recapture models revealed a large increase in lion abundance during the hunting moratorium, from 116 lions in 2012 immediately preceding the moratorium to 209 lions in the last year of the moratorium. More cubs were produced each year of the moratorium than in any year with trophy hunting. Lion demographics shifted from a male-depleted population consisting mostly of adult (≥4 years) females to a younger population with more (>29%) adult males. These data show that the three-year moratorium was effective at growing the Luangwa lion population and increasing the number of adult males. The results suggest that moratoria may be an effective tool for improving the sustainability of lion trophy hunting, particularly where systematic monitoring, conservative quotas, and age-based harvesting are difficult to enforce."

We investigated the influence of Paraclostridium bifermentans PAGU1678 strain on the pathology of a UC mouse model and found it increased UC pathosis scores such as loose and bloody stools, reduced diversity of fecal flora, disappearance of the crypt structure of distal colon tissue, destruction of intestinal epithelial cells, and atrophy of the colon. Furthermore, we observed an increase in COX-2, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1, and IL-17 expression and a decrease in Foxp3 and SOCS3 expression, as inflammation-related factors and inflammatory cytokines, a decrease in the concentration of short chain fatty acids (acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid) in feces, and an increase of intestinal mucosal myeloperoxidase activity. These results suggest that P. bifermentans PAGU1678 is a pathology-exacerbating factor in a mouse model of UC.

Here, seeking to resolve these conflicting observations, we show that DXP synthase catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate under conditions in which LThDP accumulates. O2-dependent LThDP decarboxylation led to one-electron transfer from the C2α-carbanion/enamine to O2, with intermediate ThDP-enamine radical formation, followed by peracetic acid formation en route to acetate.

https://openalex.org/W2804919711,"Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL), a spinal ligament, reduces the range of motion in limbs. No treatment is currently available for OPLL, which is why therapies are urgently needed. OPLL occurs in obesity, is more common in men, and has an onset after 40 years of age. The mechanisms underlying OPLL remain unclear. In this study, we performed a serum proteomic analysis in both OPLL patients and healthy subjects to identify factors potentially involved in the development of OPLL, and found reduced levels of a protein that might underlie the pathology of OPLL. We isolated the protein, determined its amino acid sequence, and identified it as chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 7 (CXCL7). Based on these proteomics findings, we generated a CXCL7 knockout mouse model to study the molecular mechanisms underlying OPLL. CXCL7-null mice presented with a phenotype of OPLL, showing motor impairment, heterotopic ossification in the posterior ligament tissue, and osteoporosis in vertebrate tissue. To identify the mechanisms of CXCL7 deficiency in OPLL, we searched for single nucleotide polymorphisms and altered DNA exons, but no abnormalities were found. Although miR-340 levels were found to be high in an miRNA array, they were insufficient to reduce CXCL7 levels. Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase1 (UCHL1) was found to be overexpressed in CXCL7-null mice and in the sera of patients with OPLL, and was correlated with OPLL severity. Post-translational modifications of proteins with ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like modifiers, orchestrated by a cascade of specialized ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (E2), and ubiquitin ligase (E3) enzymes, are thought to control a wide range of cellular processes, and alterations in the ubiquitin–proteasome system have been associated with several degenerative disorders. In addition, the OPLL tissue of CXCL7-null mouse and its primary cells expressed the antibody to ubiquitin (linkage-specific K48). Our data clearly show decreased CXCL7 levels in patients with OPLL, and that OPLL developed in mice lacking CXCL7. Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF)6 expression was decreased in CXCL7-null mouse primary cells. Furthermore, K48 polyubiquitination was found in posterior longitudinal ligament ossified tissue and primary cells from CXCL7-null mice. We performed a phosphoproteomics analysis in CXCL7-deficient mice and identified increased phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (ME3K)15, ubiquitin protein ligase E3C (UBE3C) and protein kinase C (PKC) alpha, suggesting that ubiquitin-dependent degradation is involved in CXCL7 deficiency. Future studies in the CXCL7-null mouse model are, therefore, warranted to investigate the role of ubiquitination in the onset of OPLL. In conclusion, CXCL7 levels may be useful as a serum marker for the progression of OPLL. This study also suggests that increasing CXCL7 levels in patients can serve as an effective therapeutic strategy for the treatment of OPLL."
https://openalex.org/W2804126198,"Microtubules are dynamic polymers required for a number of processes, including chromosome movement in mitosis. While regulators of microtubule dynamics have been well characterized, we lack a convenient way to predict how the measured dynamic parameters shape the entire microtubule system within a cell, or how the system responds when specific parameters change in response to internal or external signals. Here we describe a Monte Carlo model to simulate an array of dynamic microtubules from parameters including the cell radius, total tubulin concentration, microtubule nucleation rate from the centrosome, and plus end dynamic instability. The algorithm also allows dynamic instability or position of the cell edge to vary during the simulation. Outputs from simulations include free tubulin concentration, average microtubule lengths, length distributions, and individual length changes over time. Using this platform and reported parameters measured in interphase LLCPK1 epithelial cells, we predict that sequestering ~ 15-20% of total tubulin results in fewer microtubules, but promotes dynamic instability of those remaining. Simulations also predict that lowering nucleation rate will increase the stability and average length of the remaining microtubules. Allowing the position of the cell's edge to vary over time changed the average length but not the number of microtubules and generated length distributions consistent with experimental measurements. Simulating the switch from interphase to prophase demonstrated that decreased rescue frequency at prophase is the critical factor needed to rapidly clear the cell of interphase microtubules prior to mitotic spindle assembly. Finally, consistent with several previous simulations, our results demonstrate that microtubule nucleation and dynamic instability in a confined space determines the partitioning of tubulin between monomer and polymer pools. The model and simulations will be useful for predicting changes to the entire microtubule array after modification to one or more parameters, including predicting the effects of tubulin-targeted chemotherapies."
https://openalex.org/W2803190924,"Background Acupuncture treatment is common among stroke patients, but there is limited information available on whether acupuncture effectively prevents post-stroke pneumonia. The aim of this study was to analyze the differential risk of pneumonia after stroke between patients who did and did not receive acupuncture after discharge. Methods We used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database to conduct a retrospective cohort study using propensity score matched-pairs of new stroke patients in 2000–2004 who did and did not receive acupuncture post-stroke. Both cohorts were followed up until the end of 2009 for new-onset pneumonia. After correcting for immortal time bias, the incidence and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of pneumonia associated with acupuncture use were calculated using multivariate Cox proportional hazard models. Results Overall, 12557 stroke patients with 12557 paired controls were included in the analysis; pneumonia was diagnosed in 6796 (27.1%). Stroke patients receiving acupuncture had a lower incidence of pneumonia than those without acupuncture (53.4 vs. 58.9 per 1000 person-years), with an adjusted HR of 0.86 (95% CI 0.82–0.90). The association between pneumonia risk and acupuncture use was significant in men (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86–0.98) and women (HR 0.79, 95% 0.70–0.82) and was also observed in every age group from 20–79 years. Conclusion Stroke patients receiving acupuncture had a lower risk of pneumonia than those who did not. Further randomized control studies are needed to validate the protective effect of acupuncture on the risk of pneumonia among stroke patients."

Six root-pruning treatments were conducted with different combinations of intensity (at a distance of six, eight or ten times DBH from the trunk) and orientation (on two or four sides of the trees). Results showed that the N, P, K, photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, and stomatal conductance of leaves were all significantly decreased by root pruning over the initial period following root pruning (30 days), but increased in the subsequent investigations. The values of the above indexes peaked in 8-2 treatment (i.e., eight times DBH distance on two sides). The leaf WUE in 8-2 treatment, and average growth rates of DBH, tree height and volume, were the highest among all treatments within 3 years of root pruning. The results indicated that the root pruning based on the appropriate selection of intensity and orientation had significant positive effects on leaf nutrients, photosynthesis, and growth of trees in a closed-canopy poplar plantation."
https://openalex.org/W2804515647,"Copper plays key roles in catalytic and regulatory biochemical reactions essential for normal growth, development, and health. Dietary copper deficiencies or mutations in copper homeostasis genes can lead to abnormal musculoskeletal development, cognitive disorders, and poor growth. In yeast and mammals, copper is acquired through the activities of the CTR1 family of high-affinity copper transporters. However, the mechanisms of systemic responses to dietary or tissue-specific copper deficiency remain unclear. Here, taking advantage of the animal model Caenorhabditis elegans for studying whole-body copper homeostasis, we investigated the role of a C. elegans CTR1 homolog, CHCA-1, in copper acquisition and in worm growth, development, and behavior. Using sequence homology searches, we identified 10 potential orthologs to mammalian CTR1. Among these genes, we found that chca-1, which is transcriptionally up-regulated in the intestine and hypodermis of C. elegans during copper deficiency, is required for normal growth, reproduction, and maintenance of systemic copper balance under copper deprivation. The intestinal copper transporter CUA-1 normally traffics to endosomes to sequester excess copper, and we found here that loss of chca-1 caused CUA-1 to mislocalize to the basolateral membrane under copper overload conditions. Moreover, animals lacking chca-1 exhibited significantly reduced copper avoidance behavior in response to toxic copper conditions compared with WT worms. These results establish that CHCA-1–mediated copper acquisition in C. elegans is crucial for normal growth, development, and copper-sensing behavior.

Copper is a crucial micronutrient involved in a wide range of catalytic reactions. It serves as a cofactor in cuproenzymes necessary for mitochondrial ATP synthesis, redox reactions, iron homeostasis, and neuropeptide biogenesis (1.Kim B.E. Nevitt T. Thiele D.J.

Given its redox properties, copper accumulation can also be toxic to organisms due to generation of reactive oxygen species (1.Kim B.E. Nevitt T. Thiele D.J.

Organisms have adopted conserved copper homeostatic mechanisms to regulate copper uptake, detoxification, and distribution at both the cellular and systemic levels. The intestinal epithelium is the main site for dietary copper absorption. Following reduction from Cu(II) to Cu(I) by a metalloreductase, copper enters cells via the high-affinity copper transporter 1 (CTR1). Several metallochaperones such as CCS, COX17, and ATOX1 then deliver copper to Cu, Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1), cytochrome c oxidase, and ATP7A/ATP7B, respectively. ATP7A and ATP7B are P-type ATPases that transport copper to copper-dependent enzymes in the secretary pathway and export copper out of the cell. Upon export from the basolateral membrane of intestinal cells by ATP7A, copper is delivered to the liver, the main copper storage tissue, and other peripheral tissues as needed (1.Kim B.E. Nevitt T.

CUA-1 has been functionally characterized as a key intestinal copper exporter responsible for maintaining systemic copper homeostasis (28.Chun H. Sharma A.K. Lee J. Chan J. Jia S. Kim B.-E. The intestinal copper exporter CUA-1 is required for systemic copper homeostasis in Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Biol.

However, mechanisms by which C. elegans acquires copper have yet to be characterized. In this study, 10 CTR ortholog genes are identified in C. elegans; of these, CHCA-1 is functionally characterized. We show that chca-1 is transcriptionally regulated by copper in both the intestine and hypodermis and is essential for normal copper level, growth, and reproduction. Furthermore, we found that altered copper balance caused by the loss of CHCA-1 resulted in defects in copper-responsive behavior. Identification of this CTR-like gene in C. elegans, which appears to be essential for normal copper balance, illustrates the importance of copper delivery via CHCA-1 for normal metazoan development and behavioral phenotypes. To identify potential genes for copper acquisition in C. elegans, a Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) search was performed using the human CTR1 protein sequence as a probe. Unlike many characterized organisms that contain two or three CTR homologs (10.Puig S. Lee J. Lau M. Thiele D.J.

The BLAST result scores for the 15 candidate proteins demonstrate that, in general, worm CTR candidates share 30–40% amino acid sequence identity with hCTR1 (Table S1). Worm CTR1 candidate proteins were further analyzed based on the conserved features of CTR proteins, such as number of transmembrane domains and copper-transporting motifs at the N and C termini, and the second predicted TMD. In general, C. elegans CTR candidates have a shorter N terminus as compared with human and mouse CTR1 (Fig. S1). Candidate proteins expressed at F31E8.4, Y58A7A.1, F58G6.3, F58G6.7, and F58G6.9 gene loci are enriched with both methionine and histidine at the N terminus. All 15 candidates contain a Met–Xaa3–Met domain within or close to one of the predicted TMD. CTR1 abundance is regulated by copper availability. In yeast and mammalian cells, high copper induces CTR1 protein degradation, whereas copper deprivation stabilizes the protein (13.Nose Y. Wood L.K. Kim B.E. Prohaska J.R. Fry R.S. Spears J.W.

In yeast, such regulation occurs at the transcriptional level. CTR1 expression is induced under copper-depleted conditions by the transcriptional factor Mac1 (2.Nevitt T. Ohrvik H Thiele D.J. Charting the travels of copper in eukaryotes from yeast to mammals.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1823 (22387373): 1580-159310.1016/j.bbamcr.2012.02.011Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). To test whether worm CTR mRNA abundance can be regulated by altered copper status, qRT-PCR was performed for the 10 candidate genes under optimal, high, and low copper conditions in liquid axenic growth media. To determine the desired range of copper concentration for worm growth, the C. elegans Habituation and Reproduction (mCeHR) axenic liquid culture (22.Rao A.U. Carta L.K. Lesuisse E. Hamza I. Lack of heme synthesis in a free-living eukaryote.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102 (15767563): 4270-427510.1073/pnas.0500877102Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) was further modified to contain minimal levels of copper (“low copper” mCeHR). Around 100 synchronized L1 stage worms were grown in axenic culture supplemented with various concentrations of copper chloride (CuCl2) or bathocuproinedisulfonic acid (BCS, a Cu(I) chelator) for 9 days; the total worm number was counted for each condition on day 9. Supplementation with 10 μm copper was most favorable for worm growth, whereas worms exhibited the defects in development or embryogenesis under both copper-replete and copper-deficient conditions, resulting in significantly decreased total populations (Fig. 1A). Either 10 μm copper, 300 μm copper, or 100 μm BCS was applied to generate normal, strong copper-overload and strong copper-deficiency conditions, respectively, to measure changes in gene expression. Synchronized L1 worms were cultured to the L4 stage, and levels of mRNA of each candidate gene under high- and low-copper conditions were calculated by normalizing to expression levels under the 10 μm copper condition. Under copper-deprived conditions, expression of only F58G6.3, F58G6.7, and F58G6.9 was significantly elevated (Fig. 1B). These three genes, together with other candidate genes such as F01G12.1, Y58A7A.1, and K12C11.6, had expression suppressed by 300 μm copper (Fig. 1C). Our recent studies have shown that limited availability of dietary copper causes developmental defects in worms and that depletion of the copper exporter CUA-1 in the intestine inhibits copper distribution to peripheral tissues, resulting in reduced growth and brood size (28.Chun H. Sharma A.K. Lee J. Chan J. Jia S. Kim B.-E. The intestinal copper exporter CUA-1 is required for systemic copper homeostasis in Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292 (27881675): 1-1410.1074/jbc.M116.760876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To test whether our potential CTR genes were required for worm growth in a copper-dependent manner, L1 stage worms were grown on NGM media plates seeded with OP50 bacteria. Plates were supplemented with either 150 μm CuCl2, 50 μm BCS, or nothing. Milder copper conditions were used (as compared with the experiments in Fig. 1) to more closely mimic physiologically-relevant conditions of copper abundance and deprivation and to enable observation of intermediate growth phenotypes. Following 3 days of growth, F58G6.9- and F27C1.2-depleted P0 animals cultured with 50 μm BCS were found to be stage-delayed, as indicated by time of flight (TOF, worm length quantification), compared with vector-treated animals (Fig. 2, A–D). There were no apparent growth defects observed in worms treated with RNAi against other CTR-like genes under different copper conditions (Fig. 2, A–C) suggesting an important role of the proteins encoded by F27C1.2 and F58G6.9 in response to copper deficiency in worms. To determine the efficiency of knockdown, qRT-PCR was performed to test candidate gene expression levels after RNAi treatment. The mRNA levels of all candidate genes were significantly decreased after worms were fed RNAi bacteria. Although F01G12.1, F31E8.4, and K12C11.3 transcripts exhibited a mild reduction (∼80–60% of WT expression), silencing of all other CTR candidates was highly effective (less than 30% of WT expression) (Fig. S2). To further test whether CTR candidates are important for normal copper levels in worms, each gene was individually silenced, and whole-body metal levels were examined by ICP-MS. When providing synchronized L1 (P0) with sufficient copper (10 μm) for two generations, F1 worms lacking a number of the candidate genes displayed decreased copper accumulation (73–80% of that of vector) (Fig. 2E). To identify the gene most strongly associated with copper accumulation in C. elegans, a copper-pulse assay was conducted on each RNAi-treated candidate by pre-culturing worms in copper-limited conditions followed by a 12-h, 50 μm CuCl2 pulse (Fig. 2F). Following BCS treatment, all worms had extremely low systemic copper concentrations, in a range of 0.03–0.06 μg/g (data not shown). When calculating the level of copper acquired during the copper pulse, F58G6.3-, F58G6.7-, and F58G6.9-depleted worms displayed significant defects in restoration of copper levels. Of these, the most defective were the F58G6.9 RNAi animals, which only accumulated 40% of the copper measured in vector-treated worms (Fig. 2G). Depleting a number of other candidate genes decreased body copper accumulation under prolonged copper treatment (Fig. 2E). However, these conditions did not significantly impact copper restoration from a copper-deficient state within the time frame assayed, suggesting that these genes, when functioning independently, are not required for effective copper uptake. Our results narrowed down the CTR-like gene list, leading to F58G6.9 as the strongest candidate copper importer in worms. To further explore the role of F58G6.9 in worm regeneration, we measured brood size in F58G6.9-silenced worms under copper-limited conditions. P0 worms after one generation of F58G6.9 RNAi under 50 μm BCS supplementation showed substantially smaller brood sizes compared with control animals. Similarly, worms treated with F58G6.9 RNAi exhibited severe defects in generating embryos when treated with 100 μm BCS (Fig. 2H). Given that the F58G6.9 gene showed significantly elevated transcript levels under low copper conditions and that it is required for normal growth, reproduction, and copper accumulation in a low-copper environment, we focused on the F58G6.9 gene as a potential CTR candidate and named it CTR1 homolog required for copper accumulation-1 (chca-1). We tested functional complementation by worm CHCA-1 in yeast cells defective in the high-affinity copper transporters, Ctr1 and Ctr3, on nonfermentable carbon sources (29.Lee J. Prohaska J.R. Dagenais S.L. Glover T.W. Thiele D.J. Isolation of a murine copper transporter gene, tissue specific expression, and functional complementation of a yeast copper transport mutant.Gene. 2000; 254 (10974539): 87-9610.1016/S0378-1119(00)00287-0Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Expression of the CHCA-1 protein with a C-terminal FLAG epitope tag (CHCA-1–2×FLAG) in the heterologous system failed to restore yeast growth (Fig. S3). To test the functional consequence of loss of the endogenous CHCA-1 in vivo system, we exploited an established copper-responsive CUA-1–trafficking reporter animal model. Our recent studies have demonstrated that the intestinal CUA-1.1 copper exporter maintains systemic copper homeostasis by altering its subcellular localization (28.Chun H. Sharma A.K. Lee J. Chan J. Jia S. Kim B.-E. The intestinal copper exporter CUA-1 is required for systemic copper homeostasis in Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Biol.

It localizes to the basolateral membrane during copper deficiency, and upon copper overabundance, it re-distributes to lysosome-like organelles, called gut-granules, to protect peripheral tissues from copper toxicity. As ICP-MS assays only measure whole-body copper levels, we silenced chca-1 in transgenic worms expressing CUA-1.1::GFP from the constitutive, intestine-specific vha-6 promoter (32.Oka T. Toyomura T. Honjo K. Wada Y. Futai M. Four subunit a isoforms of Caenorhabditis elegans vacuolar H+-ATPase. Cell-specific expression during development.J. Biol.

Importantly, when given sufficient dietary copper, worms lacking chca-1 showed CUA-1.1::GFP localized to the intestinal basolateral membrane with significantly decreased distribution to the gut granules when compared with vector-treated animals (Fig. 3A). Individual silencing of all other CTR candidate genes did not change CUA-1.1 localization in the intestine (Fig. S4), suggesting the CHCA-1 is a major player in intestinal copper homeostasis. Our studies have also shown that endogenous CUA-1.1 expression is induced in the hypodermis under dietary copper restriction (28.Chun H. Sharma A.K. Lee J. Chan J. Jia S. Kim B.-E. The intestinal copper exporter CUA-1 is required for systemic copper homeostasis in Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292 (27881675): 1-1410.1074/jbc.M116.760876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Upon depleting chca-1 in transgenic worms expressing CUA-1.1::GFP driven by its own promoter (BK017 strain), CUA-1.1 expression was significantly enhanced in the hypodermis under basal culture conditions at a comparable level to that of the transgenic strain grown in 25 μm BCS (Fig. 3B). Together, copper-dependent CUA-1.1 distribution and expression in worms lacking chca-1 were similar to dietary copper-deficient worms, suggesting a role for CHCA-1 in copper acquisition in C. elegans. To further characterize CHCA-1 and to verify the RNAi-based findings, a chca-1 mutant animal (chca-1 (tm6506) IV) was obtained from the National Bioresource Project (33.Mitani S.

https://openalex.org/W2803192810,"Paget’s disease of bone (PDB) is a chronic bone disorder and although genetic factors appear to play an important role in its pathogenesis, to date PDB causing mutations were identified only in the Sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1) gene at the PDB3 locus. PDB6 locus, also previously linked to PDB, contains several candidate genes for metabolic bone diseases. We focused our analysis in the most significantly associated variant with PDB, within the Optineurin (OPTN) gene, i.e. the common variant rs1561570. Although it was previously shown to be strongly associated with PDB in several populations, its contribution to PDB pathogenesis remains unclear. In this study we have shown that rs1561570 may contribute to PDB since its T allele results in the loss of a methylation site in patients’ DNA, leading to higher levels of OPTN gene expression and a corresponding increase in protein levels in patients’ osteoclasts. This increase in OPTN expression leads to higher levels of NF-κB translocation into the nucleus and increasing expression of its target genes, which may contribute to the overactivity of osteoclasts observed in PDB. We also reported a tendency for a more severe clinical phenotype in the presence of a haplotype containing the rs1561570 T allele, which appear to be re-enforced with the presence of the SQSTM1/P392L mutation. In conclusion, our work provides novel insight towards understanding the functional effects of this variant, located in OPTN intron 7, and its implication in the contribution to PDB pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2804570077,"Tropical small-scale fisheries are typical for providing complex multivariate data, due to their diversity in fishing techniques and highly diverse species composition. In this paper we used for the first time a supervised Self-Organizing Map (xyf-SOM), to recognize and understand the internal heterogeneity of a tropical marine small-scale fishery, using as model the fishery fleet of San Pedro port, Tabasco, Mexico. We used multivariate data from commercial logbooks, including the following four factors: fish species (47), gear types (bottom longline, vertical line+shark longline and vertical line), season (cold, warm), and inter-annual variation (2007–2012). The size of the xyf-SOM, a fundamental characteristic to improve its predictive quality, was optimized for the minimum distance between objects and the maximum prediction rate. The xyf-SOM successfully classified individual fishing trips in relation to the four factors included in the model. Prediction percentages were high (80–100%) for bottom longline and vertical line + shark longline, but lower prediction values were obtained for vertical line (51–74%) fishery. A confusion matrix indicated that classification errors occurred within the same fishing gear. Prediction rates were validated by generating confidence interval using bootstrap. The xyf-SOM showed that not all the fishing trips were targeting the most abundant species and the catch rates were not symmetrically distributed around the mean. Also, the species composition is not homogeneous among fishing trips. Despite the complexity of the data, the xyf-SOM proved to be an excellent tool to identify trends in complex scenarios, emphasizing the diverse and complex patterns that characterize tropical small scale-fishery fleets."
https://openalex.org/W2804694830,"Organic hydroperoxide resistance (Ohr) enzymes are highly efficient Cys-based peroxidases that play central roles in bacterial response to fatty acid hydroperoxides and peroxynitrite, two oxidants that are generated during host-pathogen interactions. In the active site of Ohr proteins, the conserved Arg (Arg19 in Ohr from Xylella fastidiosa) and Glu (Glu51 in Ohr from Xylella fastidiosa) residues, among other factors, are involved in the extremely high reactivity of the peroxidatic Cys (Cp) toward hydroperoxides. In the closed state, the thiolate of Cp is in close proximity to the guanidinium group of Arg19. Ohr enzymes can also assume an open state, where the loop containing the catalytic Arg is far away from Cp and Glu51. Here, we aimed to gain insights into the putative structural switches of the Ohr catalytic cycle. First, we describe the crystal structure of Ohr from Xylella fastidiosa (XfOhr) in the open state that, together with the previously described XfOhr structure in the closed state, may represent two snapshots along the coordinate of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction. These two structures were used for the experimental validation of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. MD simulations employing distinct protonation states and in silico mutagenesis indicated that the polar interactions of Arg19 with Glu51 and Cp contributed to the stabilization of XfOhr in the closed state. Indeed, Cp oxidation to the disulfide state facilitated the switching of the Arg19 loop from the closed to the open state. In addition to the Arg19 loop, other portions of XfOhr displayed high mobility, such as a loop rich in Gly residues. In summary, we obtained a high correlation between crystallographic data, MD simulations and biochemical/enzymatic assays. The dynamics of the Ohr enzymes are unique among the Cys-based peroxidases, in which the active site Arg undergoes structural switches throughout the catalytic cycle, while Cp remains relatively static."

Their vaccine preferences are unclear, especially given recent pharmaceutical quality scandals and widely held beliefs deriving from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). This study characterized parental beliefs about the safety and effectiveness of Chinese and foreign vaccines.In May 2014, caregivers of young children at public immunization clinics in Shanghai, China, responded to a survey on vaccine perceptions. The two outcomes (differential belief in the effectiveness and safety of foreign vs domestic vaccines) were separately regressed onto demographic predictors in multinomial logistic regression models.Among 618 caregivers, 56% thought the effectiveness of domestic and foreign vaccines were comparable; 33% thought domestic were more effective and 11% foreign. Two-thirds thought foreign and domestic vaccines had similar safety; 11% thought domestic were safer and 21% thought foreign were safer. Compared to college graduates, those with a high school education or less had greater odds of believing domestic vaccines were more effective, and also had greater odds of believing imported vaccines were safer. Greater trust in TCM was not associated with differential beliefs in the effectiveness or safety of domestic vs foreign vaccines.Although there is no evidence that foreign and domestic vaccines differ in either effectiveness or safety, less educated caregivers in China (but not those with greater trust in TCM) appear to believe such differences exist. Further exploration of the causes of these beliefs may be necessary in order to optimize vaccine communications in China."

By solving the crystal structure of archaeal ADPGK in complex with 8-bromoadenosine phosphate (8-Br-AMP) at 1.81 Å resolution, we identified the mechanism of inhibition. We observed that 8-Br-AMP is a competitive inhibitor of ADPGK and that the bromine substitution induces marked structural changes within the protein's active site by engaging crucial catalytic residues. The results obtained using the Jurkat model of activated human T cells suggest its moderate activity in a cellular setting.

https://openalex.org/W2804366674,"Spatially explicit modelling allows to estimate population abundance and predict species’ distribution in relation to environmental factors. Abiotic factors are the main determinants of a herbivore´s response to environmental heterogeneity on large spatiotemporal scales. We assessed the influence of elevation, geographic location and distance to the coast on the seasonal abundance and distribution of guanaco (Lama guanicoe) in central Tierra del Fuego, by means of spatially explicit modelling. The estimated abundance was 23,690 individuals for the non-breeding season and 33,928 individuals for the breeding season. The factors influencing distribution and abundance revealed to be the elevation for the non-breeding season, and the distance to the coast and geographic location for the breeding season. The southwest of the study area presented seasonal abundance variation and the southeast and northeast presented high abundance during both seasons. The elevation would be the driving factor of guanaco distribution, as individuals move to lower areas during the non-breeding season and ascend to high areas during the breeding season. Our results confirm that part of the guanaco population performs seasonal migratory movements and that the main valleys present important wintering habitats for guanacos as well as up-hill zones during summer. This type of study would help to avoid problems of scale mismatch and achieve better results in management actions and is an example of how to assess important seasonal habitats from evaluations of abundance and distribution patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2803424121,"Six fungal-type cellulose binding domains were found in the genome of the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi and cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Sequence comparison indicate high similarity to fungal cellulose binding domains, raising the question of why these domains exist in coccolithophores. The proteins were tested for binding with cellulose and chitin as ligands, which resulted in the identification of two functional carbohydrate binding modules: EHUX2 and EHUX4. Compared to benchmark fungal cellulose binding domain Cel7A-CBM1 from Trichoderma reesei, these proteins showed slightly lower binding to birch and bacterial cellulose, but were more efficient chitin binders. Finally, a set of cellulose binding domains was created based on the shuffling of one well-functioning and one non-functional domain. These were characterized in order to get more information of the binding domain’s sequence–function relationship, indicating characteristic differences between the molecular basis of cellulose versus chitin recognition. As previous reports have showed the presence of cellulose in coccoliths and here we find functional cellulose binding modules, a possible connection is discussed."

In this study we evaluated the effect of IAV vaccination on aerosol shedding in pigs housed in warm environmental conditions. Thirty-six, three-week old weaned pigs were obtained from an IAV negative herd and were randomly allocated to one of 4 groups: 1) a homologous vaccine group, 2) a heterologous multivalent vaccine group, 3) a heterologous monovalent group and, 4) a non-vaccinated group. After vaccination pigs were challenged with the triple reassortant A/Sw/IA/00239/04 H1N1 virus. Environmental temperature and relative humidity were recorded throughout the study. Nasal swabs, oral fluids and air samples were collected daily. All samples were tested by RRT-PCR and virus isolation was attempted on positive samples. Average temperature and relative humidity throughout the study were 27°C (80°F) and 53%, respectively. A significantly higher proportion of infected pigs was detected in the non-vaccinated than in the vaccinated group. Lower levels of nasal virus shedding were found in vaccinated groups compared to non-vaccinated group and IAV was not detected in air samples of any of the vaccinated groups. In contrast, positive air samples were detected in the non-vaccinated group at 1, 2 and 3 days post infection although the overall levels were considered low most likely due to the elevated environmental temperature. In conclusion, both the decrease in shedding and the increase in environmental temperature may have contributed to the inability to detect airborne IAV in vaccinated pigs."

Design of the study Case-control study. The sample was composed of 30 volunteers, 15 with BMS and 15 in the control group. The pressure-pain threshold (PPT) and vibration-detection threshold (VDT) were examined. The clinical evaluation was complemented with the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ), Douleur Neuropathique 4 (DN4) and Beck Depression and Anxiety Inventories (BDI and BAI, respectively). Results BMS subjects showed a statistically significant higher PPT in the tongue (p = 0.002), right (p = 0.001) and left (p = 0.004) face, and a significant reduction of the VDT in the tongue (p = 0.013) and right face (p = 0.030). Significant differences were also found when comparing the PPT and the VDT of distinct anatomical areas. However, a significant interaction (group × location) was only for the PPT. BMS subjects also showed significantly higher levels of depression (p = 0.01), as measured by the BDI, compared to controls; and a significant inverse correlation between the VDT in the left face and anxiety levels was detected. Conclusions The study of somatosensory changes in BMS and its correlations with the clinical features as well as the levels of anxiety and depression expands current understanding of the neuropathic origin and the possible contribution of psychogenic factors related to this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2803905702,"The evaluation of protected area networks on their capacity to preserve species distributions is a key topic in conservation biology. There are different types of protected areas, with National Parks those with highest level of protection. National Parks can be declared attending to many ecological features that include the presence of certain animal species. Here, we selected 37 vertebrate species that were highlighted as having relevant natural value for at least one of the 10 National Parks of mainland Spain. We modelled species distributions with the favourability function, and applied the Insecurity Index to detect the degree of protection of favourable areas for each species. Two metrics of Insecurity Index were defined for each species: the Insecurity Index in each of the cells, and the Overall Insecurity Index of a species. The former allows the identification of insecure areas for each species that can be used to establish spatial conservation priorities. The latter gives a value of Insecurity for each species, which we used to calculate the Representativeness of favourable areas for the species in the network. As expected, due to the limited extension of the National Park network, all species have high values of Insecurity; i.e., just a narrow proportion of their favourable areas are covered by a National Park. However, the majority of species favourable areas are well represented in the network, i.e., the percentage of favourable areas covered by the National Park network is higher than the percentage of mainland Spain covered by the network (result also supported by a randomization approach). Even if a reserve network only covers a low percentage of a country, the Overall Insecurity Index allows an objective assessment of its capacity to represent species. Beyond the results presented here, the Insecurity Index has the potential to be extrapolated to other areas and to cover a wide range of species."

The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term effects of psychotropic monotherapy use during lactation on the breastfed infant.In this prospective study, we followed 280 infants whose mothers contacted the Drug Consultation Center (DCC) at Assaf Harofeh Medical Center between January 2011 and December 2015, seeking information regarding the chronic use of psychotropic medications during lactation. This group was compared with a group of 152 callers, who inquired evidence regarding the use of antibiotics compatible with breastfeeding. Information on adverse effects, physical measures and gross motor developmental milestone achievements of the breastfed infants was obtained during a follow-up telephone interview. At follow up, the median age of the infants in the Psychotropic-drug group was 20 (11-33) months versus 36 (20-48) months in the Antibiotic group (p < 0.001). The outcomes were compared between the groups followed by a propensity score matching to control for difference in baseline characteristics.At follow-up, no significant differences between infants in the two groups were observed with regard to height, weight, head circumference and weight-length ratio percentile (p = 0.339, p = 0.223, p = 0.738, p = 0.926, respectively). Children in both groups were, according to their parents, within the normal developmental range for all milestones, according to the Denver Developmental Scale. Use of psychotropic medications during breastfeeding was not significantly associated with adverse reactions. After propensity score matching (n = 120 pairs) to control for differences in baseline characteristics and the length of lactation, only one significant difference was reported, sleepiness in infants in the study group (7/120) and none in the comparison group (p = 0.008).Chronic use of psychotropic monotherapy during lactation is associated with normal growth and gross motor developmental as by milestone achievements reported by parents. Sleepiness was reported, it seemed self-limited with no developmental effect."

The aim of the present case-control study was to analyse the correlation between family history of breast cancer or presence of a BRCA mutation and PBL-TL in the hypothesis that TL is a modifier of cancer risk.PBL-TL was measured using the real-time quantitative PCR method in DNA for 142 cases and 239 controls. All the women enrolled were characterized for cancer family history. A subgroup of 48 women were classified for the presence of a BRCA mutation. PBL-TL were summarized as means and standard deviations, and compared by standard analysis of variance. A multivariable Generalised Linear Model was fitted to the data with PBL-TL as the dependent variable, case/control status and presence of a BRCA/VUS mutation as factors, and age in 4 strata as a covariate.Age was significantly associated with decreasing PBL-TL in controls (p = 0.01), but not in BC cases. The telomere length is shorter in cases than in controls after adjusting for age. No effect on PBL-TL of BMI, smoke nor of the most common risk factors for breast cancer was observed. No association between PBL-TL and family history was detected both in BC cases and controls. In the multivariate model, no association was observed between BRCA mutation and decreased PBL-TL. A statistically significant interaction (p = 0.031) between case-control status and a BRCA-mutation/VUS was observed, but no effect was detected for the interaction of cancer status and BRCA or VUS.Our study fails to provide support to the hypothesis that PBL-TL is associated with the risk of hereditary BC, or that is a marker of inherited mutations in BRCA genes."

In the current study we examined malingering practices by comparing the performance of college students instructed to malinger dyslexia (n = 28) to that of students actually diagnosed with dyslexia (n = 16). We also included a control group of students without reading and spelling difficulties (n = 28). The test battery included tasks tapping literacy skills as well as underlying cognitive skills associated with literacy outcomes. These tasks are commonly used in diagnosing dyslexia. We examined patterns in the performance of malingerers across tasks and tested whether malingerers could be identified based on their performance on a limited number of tasks. Results indicated that malingerers scored significantly lower than students with dyslexia on reading and spelling skills; i.e., the core characteristics of dyslexia. Especially reading performance was extremely low and not in line with students’ age and level of education. Findings for underlying cognitive skills were mixed. Overall, malingerers scored lower than students with dyslexia on tasks tapping mainly speed, whereas the two groups did not differ on tasks reflecting mainly accuracy. Based on word and pseudoword reading and letter and digit naming, the three groups could be distinguished with reasonable sensitivity and specificity. In all, results indicate that college students seem to understand on which tasks they should feign dyslexia, but tend to exaggerate difficulties on these tasks to the point where diagnosticians should mistrust performance."

There were 570,403 acute medical admissions and 334 children died, including 83 who died after an admission on Saturday or Sunday and 251 who died following admission between Monday and Friday. The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for a child dying after admission on a weekend compared to weekday was 1.03 [95% CI 0.80 to 1.32]. The OR for a child admitted over the weekend requiring intensive care unit (ICU) or high dependency unit (HDU) care was 1.24 [1.16 to 1.32], but the absolute number of admissions to HDU and ICU per day were similar on weekends and weekdays. We see no evidence of increased in-hospital paediatric mortality after admission on a weekend. The increased risk for admission to ITU or HDU with more serious illness over weekends is explained by fewer less serious admissions."
https://openalex.org/W2803624884,"Many chemicals have been reported to induce phototoxicity. The absorbance of light energy within the sunlight range is a common characteristic of phototoxicity. The 3T3 NRU phototoxicity test (PT) in 3T3 mouse skin fibroblasts has been used to identify the phototoxic potential induced by excited chemicals after exposure to ultra violet (UV). However, as phototoxicity may occur in ocular cells, it is necessary to develop a more suitable test for cornea-derived cells. In this study, we attempted to establish a new in vitro PT method in rabbit corneal cell lines (SIRC). We evaluated five ophthalmic agents, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, and tetracycline, for their cytotoxic potential and in vitro phototoxicity. The results obtained using 3D human corneal models revealed that the UV-induced eye tissue toxicity by the test substances showed good correlation with those obtained using the in vitro phototoxicity test. However, the results from the 3D PT for ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and tetracycline in the 3D human cornea model were only partially comparable. Therefore, we suggest the SIRC cell line as a new phototoxicity test model; however, a sequential testing strategy, such as 3D PT, was also proposed to obtain relevant information for topical eye agents."
