https://openalex.org/W2081246006,"Both sexes of the bark beetle Dendroctonus brevicomis convert the (+) and (-) enantiomers of the tree terpene alpha-pinene to the corresponding enantiomers of trans-verbenol at about equal rates. (-)-trans-Verbenol inhibited the response of females, but not of males, to a mixture of attractive pheromone components. Since the female initiates the attack on a pine tree, (-)-trans-verbenol may play a role in reducing intraspecific competition for breeding areas."
https://openalex.org/W2032945326,"The Morgan Hill, California, earthquake (magnitude 6.1) of 24 April 1984 ruptured a 30-kilometer-long segment of the Calaveras fault zone to the east of San Jose. Although it was recognized in 1980 that an earthquake of magnitude 6 occurred on this segment in 1911 and that a repeat of this event might reasonably be expected, no short-term precursors were noted and so the time of the 1984 earthquake was not predicted. Unilateral rupture propagation toward the south-southeast and an energetic late source of seismic radiation located near the southeast end of the rupture zone contributed to the highly focused pattern of strong motion, including an exceptionally large horizontal acceleration of 1.29g at a site on a dam abutment near the southeast end of the rupture zone."
https://openalex.org/W4245696036,"In technology development significant advances are as often the result of a series of evolutionary steps as they are of breakthroughs. This is illustrated by the examples of the steam engine and the computer. Breakthroughs, such as the transistor, are relatively rare, and are often the result of the introduction of new knowledge coming from a quite different area. Technology development is often difficult to predict because of its complexity; practical considerations may far outweigh apparent scientific advantages, and cultural factors enter in at many levels. In a large technological organization problems exist in bringing scientific knowledge to bear on development, but much can be done to obviate these difficulties."

https://openalex.org/W2019154862,"Sixty oceanic normal modes are used to synthesize the M2 and K1 (principal lunar semidiurnal and declinational diurnal) tides. The ten most energetic modes in the M2 synthesis account for 87 percent of the energy; the corresponding figure for K1 is 93 percent, two-thirds of which is contributed by a single mode whose natural period is about 29 hours. Model calculations indicate that the quality (Q) of the ocean response to tidal forcing resembles that of a frictionally controlled oscillator. In particular, for M2 the global Q is about 10."

By incorporating a number of cost-saving measures, an exciting program of planetary exploration can be achieved within a highly constrained NASA budget."

https://openalex.org/W4243118944,Most stars in the solar neighborhood are either double or multiple systems. They provide a unique opportunity to measure stellar masses and radii and to study many interesting and important phenomena. The best candidates for black holes are compact massive components of two x-ray binaries: Cygnus X-1 and LMC X-3. The binary radio pulsar PSR 1913 + 16 provides the best available evidence for gravitational radiation. Accretion disks and jets observed in close binaries offer a very good testing ground for models of active galactic nuclei and quasars.
