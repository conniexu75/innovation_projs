https://openalex.org/W1995822744,Retinoblastoma is one of several human tumors to which predisposition can be inherited. Molecular genetic analysis of several nonheritable cases has led to the hypothesis that this tumor develops after the occurrence of specific mitotic events involving human chromosome 13. These events reveal initial predisposing recessive mutations. Evidence is presented that similar chromosomal events occur in tumors from heritable cases. The chromosome 13 found in the tumors was the one carrying the predisposing germline mutation and not the homolog containing the wild-type allele at the Rb-1 locus. These results suggest a new approach for identifying recessive mutant genes that lead to cancer and a conceptual basis for accurate prenatal predictions of cancer predisposition.
https://openalex.org/W1970023609,"We have localized the regulatory sequence required for viral or poly([)-poly(C) activation of human β-interferon gene expression to a region located between −37 and −77 from the mRNA cap site. This sequence has the characteristics of an inducible enhancer element: it can act upstream or downstream of the β-interferon gene regardless of its orientation, and at distances up to approximately 1 kilobase from its normal location. Moreover, this element can confer inducibility on a heterologous promoter. Further analysis has identified a minimal regulatory element of 14 base pairs within this enhancer. Sequences closely related to this element are present five times within the 5′-flanking regions of both the α- and β-interferon genes. The number of these minimal regulatory elements required for maximal β-interferon gene expression appears to differ in different cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W2019542866,Modified Drosophila heat shock genes were introduced into the germ line by P element transformation. The genes were altered such that several factors could be tested for their influence upon chromosome puffing. Deletion of promoter sequences upstream of position -73 of an hsp70-IacZ hybrid gene was sufficient to abolish puffing. Analysis of progressive 5' deletions defines a 16 bp interval that contains sequences required for both heat-induced puffing and gene expression. An internal deletion of the hsp70-IacZ gene that reduces the transcript size from 9 kb to 0.8 kb results in a dramatic reduction in puff size. The chromosomal insertion sites of 26 variant hsp70 or hsp26 genes fail to influence puffing greatly with one marked exception. This transformant possesses an insert that fails to puff and exhibits a tissue-restricted pattern of expression. These results indicate that variation in either promoter strength or transcript length have profound effects on puffing.
https://openalex.org/W2125652977,"Monkeys trained on both visual and tactual versions of an object memory task (delayed nonmatching-to-sample) received bilateral ablations of either the amygdaloid complex or the hippocampal formation of the brain. Although both groups performed well on the two intramodal versions (visual-to-visual and tactual-to-tactual), the amygdalectomized monkeys were severely impaired relative to the hippocampectomized monkeys on a crossmodal version (tactual-to-visual). The findings suggest that the amygdala is critical for certain forms of crossmodal association and that the loss of such associations underlies many of the bizarre behaviors that make up the Klüver-Bucy syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W1569726016,"The carbohydrate-binding specificity of Aleuria aurantia lectin was investigated by analyzing the behavior of a variety of fucose-containing oligosaccharides on an A. aurantia lectin-Sepharose column. Studies with complex-type oligosaccharides obtained from various glycoproteins by hydrazinolysis and their partial degradation fragments indicated that the presence of the alpha-fucosyl residue linked at the C-6 position of the proximal N-acetylglucosamine moiety is indispensable for binding to the lectin column. Binding was not affected by the structures of the outer chain moieties nor by the presence of the bisecting N-acetylglucosamine residue. These results indicated that A. aurantia lectin-Sepharose is useful for the group separation of mixtures of complex-type asparagine-linked sugar chains. Studies of glycosylated Bence Jones proteins indicated that this procedure is also applicable to intact glycoproteins. The behavior of oligosaccharides isolated from human milk and the urine of patients with fucosidosis indicated that the oligosaccharides with Fuc alpha 1----2Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc and Gal beta 1----4(Fuc alpha 1----3)GlcNAc groups interact with the lectin, but less strongly than complex-type sugar chains with a fucosylated core. Lacto-N-fucopentaitol II, which has a Gal beta 1----3(Fuc alpha 1----4)GlcNAc group, interacts less strongly than the above two groups with the matrix. Oligosaccharides with Fuc alpha 1----2Gal beta 1----3GlcNAc and Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----3Gal beta 1----4(Fuc alpha 1----3)GlcNAc groups showed almost no interaction with the matrix."

https://openalex.org/W1483785017,"Six microbicidal peptides, NP-1, NP-2, NP-3a, NP-3b, NP-4, and NP-5, from rabbit peritoneal neutrophils were characterized. As a family, the peptides were 32-34 residues in length, were cystine- and arginine-rich, and each contained three intramolecular disulfide bonds. Within their sequences, the six peptides shared 11-residue positions, which included the six half-cystines contained in each peptide. NP-1 and NP-2 differed by a single residue and were identical in their respective sequences to MCP-1 and MCP-2, the peptide analogs from rabbit alveolar macrophages. NP-4 and NP-5 were homologous in 27 of their residues, but NP-3a and NP-3b shared little more than the 11-residue backbone common to all members of this peptide family."

https://openalex.org/W1997031405,"A hybrid gene consisting of the human IFN-α1 promoter and a β-globin transcription unit is expressed correctly only after viral induction. To determine the region required for inducibility, 25 hybrid promoters consisting of varying upstream IFN-α1 and downstream β-globin promoter moieties were analyzed, and 5′-deletion analysis was performed on an inducible hybrid promoter. An IFN promoter region from position −109 to −64 conferred maximal inducibility on downstream β-globin promoter segments and even on the intact β-globin promoter. This region is strikingly conserved among human IFN-α and -β genes. As constitutive expression of the β-globin gene was not diminished by placing IFN promoter fragments in various positions, induction is attributed largely to positive, rather than to negative control."
https://openalex.org/W2058392451,The dendritic arbors of sympathetic neurons in different species of mammals vary systematically: the superior cervical ganglion cells of smaller mammals have fewer and less extensive dendrites than the homologous neurons in larger animals. This difference in dendritic complexity according to body size is reflected in the convergence of ganglionic innervation; the ganglion cells of progressively larger mammals are innervated by progressively more axons. These relations have implications both for the function of homologous neural systems in animals of different sizes and for the regulation of neuronal geometry during development.
https://openalex.org/W1668765375,"Glycoproteins which contain about 45 mol% proline were dramatically induced in mouse parotid and submandibular glands by isoproterenol treatment, but these unusual proteins were not detected in control animals. These acid-soluble substances were obtained by extracting tissues with 10% trichloroacetic acid, as reported previously for isolating proline-rich proteins from rat submandibular glands (Mehansho, H., and Carlson, D.M. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 6616-6620). Three major proline-rich glycoproteins were induced in parotid glands with apparent molecular weights of 66,000 (GP-66p), 45,000 (GP-45p), and 27,000 (GP-27p), whereas only one such protein was expressed by the submandibular glands (66,000 (GP-66sm]. Both GP-66p and GP-66sm contained about 19% carbohydrate with the following molar ratios, respectively; GalNAc, 1.0, 1.0; Gal, 1.6, 2.3; GlcNAc, 0.8, 1.1; sialic acid, 0.9, 1.9. The peptide chains of GP-66p and GP-66sm appear to be identical by amino acid compositions, glycopeptide analysis, and preliminary amino acid sequencing data. Northern blot analysis of RNAs from parotid glands of normal and isoproterenol-treated rats, probed with a 32P-labeled proline-rich protein cDNA, confirmed that control animals were devoid of mRNAs encoding these proteins and that isoproterenol treatment dramatically induced expression of these genes. Feeding sorghum high in tannins caused changes in the parotid glands similar to those observed upon isoproterenol treatment, as noted earlier with rats (Mehansho, H., Hagerman, A., Clements, S., Butler, L., Rogler, J., and Carlson, D.M. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80, 3948-3952). These glycoproteins have high affinities for tannins as demonstrated by competitive binding curves."
https://openalex.org/W2001672262,"The structure of the (H2A-H2B-H3-H4)2 histone octamer has been determined by means of x-ray crystallographic techniques at a resolution of 3.3 angstroms. The octamer is a prolate ellipsoid 110 angstroms long and 65 to 70 angstroms in diameter, and its general shape is that of a rugby ball. The size and shape are radically different from those determined in earlier studies. The most striking feature of the histone octamer is its tripartite organization, that is, a central (H3-H4)2 tetramer flanked by two H2A-H2B dimers. The DNA helix, placed around the octamer in a path suggested by the features on the surface of the protein, appears like a spring holding the H2A-H2B dimers at either end of the (H3-H4)2 tetramer."
https://openalex.org/W2025329465,"In Volvox cultures synchronized by a light-dark cycle, juveniles containing presumptive somatic and reproductive cells are produced during the dark, but their cells do not differentiate until after the lights come on. The pattern of protein synthesis changes rapidly after the lights come on. Action spectra and effects of photosynthesis inhibitors indicate that this protein synthetic change is not simply a consequence of renewed flow of energy from illuminated chloroplasts. Actinomycin, at a level adequate to block the response to heat shock, has virtually no effect on the response of the same cells to light; furthermore, RNAs isolated from unilluminated and illuminated juveniles yield indistinguishable in vitro translation products. We conclude, therefore, that this effect of light is exerted almost exclusively at the translational level, generating one of the most striking examples of translational regulation yet described."
https://openalex.org/W2045170820,"A 37-kilodalton protein is synthesized at higher rates in the peripheral and central nervous system of newborn rats than in adult animals. As a specific response to denervation, the synthesis of the 37-kilodalton protein is increased in the mature peripheral and central nervous system; however, this protein accumulates only in the peripheral nervous system. The differences in accumulation of the protein correlate with the apparent differences in the ability of peripheral and central axons to regenerate. The synthesis of the 37-kilodalton protein is inhibited when proper innervation or reinnervation is established."
https://openalex.org/W1966240406,"The T-cell receptor is formed by two chains, alpha and beta, for which specific clones were recently obtained. In this report the gene for the beta chain of the human T-cell receptor was located on the long arm of chromosome 7, band q35, by means of in situ hybridization. This chromosome region in T cells is unusually prone to develop breaks in vivo, perhaps reflecting instability generated by somatic rearrangement of T-cell receptor genes during normal differentiation in this cell lineage."
https://openalex.org/W2058482362,"Rhizomatous growth may permit the nonrandom placement of ramets into different environments, but whether clonal plants are able to use this means to exercise adaptive habitat choice is not known. Western ragweed (Ambrosia psilostachya) plants are shown to preferentially colonize nonsaline soil over saline soil patches, and clones with the strongest preference for nonsaline soil are those least able to grow when restricted to saline conditions. In clonal plant species, nonrandom associations of genotypes with specific environments may thus reflect habitat selection by plants as well as selective mortality imposed by different habitat patches."

https://openalex.org/W2076646611,"The effects of ethanol on chick embryo sensory and spinal cord neurons growing on one of several biological substrates (poly-D-lysine, laminin, or neuron-produced neurite-promoting materials) were examined. Ethanol inhibited process formation by the neurons in a dose-dependent manner and inhibited the production of neurotrophic factors. Neuronal attachment to the substrates, survival of attached neurons, and receptor interactions of sensory neurons with nerve growth factor were not influenced by ethanol. It appears that ethanol alters certain metabolic characteristics of developing neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1520004893,"Proteoglycan Lt (PG-Lt), isolated from 17-day-old chicken embryo sterna, appeared to differ from its counterpart from tibia and femur (Noro, A., Kimata, K., Oike, Y., Shinomura, T., Maeda, N., Yano, S., Takahashi, N., and Suzuki, S. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 9323-9331). The intact disulfide-bonded molecule of approximately 300 kDa was separable into three chains of 115, 84, and 68 kDa on reduction, the molecular masses being relative to those of collagen standards on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). This is in contrast to tibial cartilage PG-Lt, from which there was no observed release of a 68-kDa chain (100 kDa relative to globular protein standards) after reduction. The 115-kDa chain of sternum PG-Lt consists of a core 68-kDa polypeptide to which the chondroitin sulfate chains are attached. The ratio of 4-sulfated to 6-sulfated disaccharides released after either chondroitinase ABC or AC digestion is 3:1. Identity of PG-Lt with type IX collagen was indicated by their similar elution profiles on DEAE-Trisacryl and by the presence in both proteins of co-migrating 84- and 68-kDa bands on SDS-PAGE. This identity was confirmed by immunoblotting PG-Lt after SDS-PAGE, with affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies specific for a triple helical domain (HMW) of type IX collagen. The nonreduced high molecular mass material and all three bands of the reduced PG-Lt were immunoreactive, giving immunostaining patterns similar to autoradiographs from the [14C]glycine-labeled protein."
https://openalex.org/W2038520891,"Using a monoclonal antibody (No-194) we have identified, in Xenopus laevis and other amphibia, an acidic protein of Mr 40,000 (ribocharin) which is specifically associated with the granular component of the nucleolus and nucleoplasmic 65S particles. These particles contain the nuclear 28S rRNA and apparently represent the precursor to the large ribosomal subunit in nucleocytoplasmic transit. By immunoelectron microscopy ribocharin has been localized in the granular component of the nucleolus and in interchromatin granules. During mitosis ribocharin-containing particles are associated with surfaces of chromosomes and are recollected in the reconstituting nucleoli in late telophase. We suggest that ribocharin is a specific component of precursor particles of the large ribosomal subunit, which dissociates from the 65S particle before passage through the nuclear envelope, and is reutilized in ribosome biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2069248200,"The interrupted T4 phage td gene, which encodes thymidylate synthase, is the first known example of an intron-containing prokaryotic structural gene. Analysis of td-encoded transcripts provides evidence in favor of maturation at the RNA level. Northern blotting with T4 RNA and with region-specific probes revealed three classes of RNA: diffuse premessage (ca. 2.5 kb), a low-abundance mature mRNA (ca. 1.3 kb), and an abundant free intron RNA (ca. 1.0 kb). The existence of covalently joined mature mRNA was suggested by hybridization and S1 protection experiments and was confirmed by primer extension analysis of the splice junction. In analogy to expression of interrupted eukaryotic genes, these results are consistent with an RNA processing model that would account for the direct gene transcript serving as precursor for both free intron RNA and a spliced mRNA that is colinear with the thymidylate synthase product."
https://openalex.org/W2022651416,"The retroviral oncogene v-fms encodes a glycoprotein whose transport to the plasma membrane is required for transformation. Tryptic digestion of microsomes from transformed cells yielded membrane-protected amino-terminal fragments 40 kd smaller than intact molecules. These fragments were glycosylated, and they included v-fms-coded epitopes expressed at the cell surface. Deletion of the predicted membrane-spanning peptide generated polypeptides that were completely sequestered within microsomes. The mutant glycoproteins acquired more asparagine-linked oligosaccharide chains than did wild-type molecules, lacked kinase activity in vitro, were not transported to the cell surface, and had no transforming activity. Thus, the membrane-spanning segment in the middle of the glycoprotein interrupts translocation of nascent chains into the endoplasmic reticulum, ultimately orienting the amino-terminal domain outside the cell and the carboxy-terminal kinase domain in the cytoplasm. These topological features are similar to those of several growth factor receptors, suggesting that v-fms transforms cells through modified receptor-mediated signals."
https://openalex.org/W2059709337,"The assembly of the spicules (primitive skeleton) of the sea urchin embryo is being studied in primary mesenchyme cells cultured in vitro. A monoclonal antibody (1223) has been prepared that inhibits the deposition of CaCO3 into the spicules. This antibody reacts with a 130,000 Mr cell-surface protein that is concentrated on the surface of approximately 5% of the cells of dissociated gastrula stage embryos. When primary mesenchyme cells in the embryo or cells cultured in vitro are examined, the 1223 antigen is detected on the surface of the cells and on the extracellular material associated with the spicule. We conclude that the 1223 antibody recognizes a cell-surface protein that plays an essential role in spicule formation."
https://openalex.org/W2010946778,The T-cell antigen receptor is a cell-surface molecule that participates in the immune response. In the present experiments the genes encoding the beta chain of the T-cell receptor were found to reside on the long arm of human chromosome 7 at or near band q32. Related sequences were found on the short arm of chromosome 7 in bands p15-21 in some experiments. Chromosomal rearrangements in T-cells from normal individuals and patients with ataxia telangiectasia have previously been observed at and near these map assignments for the beta-chain genes.
https://openalex.org/W1512824894,"A mixture of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine labeled with different radioisotopes in the uridine and glucosamine was used to show that the intact sugar nucleotide was translocated across the membrane of vesicles derived from rat liver rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and Golgi apparatus. Translocation was dependent on temperature, saturable at high concentrations of sugar nucleotide, and inhibited by treatment of vesicles with proteases, suggesting protein carrier mediated transport. Translocation of UDP-GlcNAc by RER-derived vesicles appeared to be specific since these vesicles were unable to translocate UDP-galactose, in contrast to those derived from the Golgi apparatus. Preliminary results suggest that the mechanism of UDP-GlcNAc translocation into RER-derived vesicles is via a coupled exchange with lumenal nucleoside monophosphate. This is similar to the recently postulated mechanism for translocation of sugar nucleotides into vesicles derived from the Golgi apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W1632217019,"Acetylcholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.7) from fetal bovine serum (FBS) was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. The procedure involved procainamide affinity chromatography with native FBS, followed by chromatography on Sepharose 6B and DEAE-Sephadex. The acetylcholinesterase was purified approximately 44,000-fold, and 13 mg was obtained corresponding to an overall yield of about 45%. The purified acetylcholinesterase was stable at 4 degrees C for at least 8 weeks but was labile to freezing; however, in 50% glycerol the enzyme was stable at -20 degrees C for at least 12 weeks. FBS acetylcholinesterase exhibited typical substrate inhibition, had a Km of 120 microM, and a turnover number of 5300 s-1 with the substrate acetylthiocholine. The enzyme was highly sensitive to the specific acetylcholinesterase inhibitor 1,5-bis(4-allyldimethylammoniumphenyl)pentan-3-one. FBS acetylcholinesterase was characterized as a G4 form of acetylcholinesterase and was distinguished from bovine erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase on the basis of lectin gel binding, [3H] Triton X-100 binding, amino acid composition, number of catalytic subunits/molecule, and hydrodynamic properties. FBS acetylcholinesterase had a Stokes radius of 76 A as judged by gel filtration, and from this a molecular weight of 340,000 daltons was calculated. The enzyme had a subunit weight of approximately 83,000 daltons by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; paraoxon titration indicated a relative active site mass of 75,000 daltons. The amino acid composition of FBS acetylcholinesterase was similar to the human erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase (Rosenberry, T. L., and Scoggin, D. M. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 5643-5652). A monoclonal antibody directed against human erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase, AE-2, (Fambrough, D. M., Engel, A. G., and Rosenberry, T. L. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 79, 1078-1082) cross-reacted with FBS acetylcholinesterase."
https://openalex.org/W2085035608,"Regeneration of fish optic nerve (representing regenerative central nervous system) was accompanied by increased activity of regeneration-triggering factors produced by nonneuronal cells. A graft of regenerating fish optic nerve, or a ""wrap-around"" implant containing medium conditioned by it, induced a response associated with regeneration in injured optic nerves of adult rabbits (representing a nonregenerative central nervous system). This response was manifested by an increase of general protein synthesis and of selective polypeptides in the retinas and by the ability of the retina to sprout in culture."
https://openalex.org/W1591330829,"Radioactive- and stable isotope-containing substrates were used to identify the biosynthetic precursors of the beta-lactam antibiotic, thienamycin, in Streptomyces cattleya. Acetate is utilized by the organism to form C(6) and C(7) of the beta-lactam ring. The two carbons of the hydroxyethyl group attached to C(6) are both derived from the methyl of methionine. The cysteaminyl side chain attached to C(2) is derived from cysteine. Selective inhibition of thienamycin and cephamycin C biosynthesis has been achieved either through the addition of metabolic inhibitors or through manipulation of the growth medium. These results suggest that the two beta-lactam antibiotics, thienamycin and cephamycin C, are formed by different biosynthetic pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2026847480,The functional properties of an isolated dendritic branch of an identified sensory interneuron in the cricket were studied. The branch responded to wind stimuli directed at the animal and displayed a distinct directional sensitivity to those stimuli. A technique was used that allows a neuron to be specifically lesioned in a semi-intact preparation during intracellular recording. Lesioning was achieved by dye-sensitized photoinactivation with a laser epi-illumination stereomicroscope.
https://openalex.org/W1969441181,"An active cellular oncogene was demonstrated in hepatocellular neoplasms arising spontaneously in 24-month-old B6C3F1 mice. DNA isolated from the tumorous tissue and transfected into NIH 3T3 cells showed an 82 percent (9 of 11 animals) frequency of foci induction. In contrast, DNA isolated from the surrounding nontumorous hepatic tissue from the same animals and DNA from other 24-month-old B6C3F1 mice without tumors did not cause transformation in the NIH 3T3 cell assay. This strain of mouse is used extensively in carcinogen bioassays, and the observed high frequency of transformation (82 percent, compared to 10 to 20 percent in humans) supports the concept that the B6C3F1 mouse is hypersusceptible to liver tumor development. It also emphasizes the need to further understand the mechanisms of oncogene activation in animals used for long-term studies of toxicity and oncogenicity before evaluating potential human risk."
https://openalex.org/W1570680588,"Quantitative rates of DNA synthesis can be determined by DNA:propidium fluorescence measurements of synchronized cells progressing through S-phase. We have previously reported that HeLa cells have discontinuous rates with values of about 2.9, 1.6, and 4.4 pg of DNA/h for early, middle, and late S-phase, respectively. In attempts to understand why two peaks of DNA synthesis rates are observed, we have examined the nuclear DNA polymerases alpha and beta over the S-phase. Nuclear matrices isolated from HeLa cells contained 2% of the alpha polymerase and 12% of the beta polymerase that was present in cell lysates, and about 2% of the original DNA. The amounts of endogenous DNA synthesis in isolated nuclear matrices were comparable to the amounts observed when exogenous DNA was added. DNase treatment abolished the endogenous DNA synthesis but not the exogenous DNA synthesis, suggesting that polymerase alpha binding does not depend on matrix-bound DNA. As synchronized cells progressed through the S-phase, there appeared two peaks of enzymatic activity of alpha polymerase bound to the nuclear matrix which correlated with in vitro DNA synthesis in these nuclear matrices and with the two peaks of quantitative DNA synthesis rates. Two peaks of alpha polymerase activity were also observed with isolated nuclei, but not with cell lysates or cytosol. Our results suggest that, over the S-phase, the differential binding of polymerase alpha to the nuclear matrix determines the differential rates of DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1969915716,"In contrast to other kinds of phospholipases, phospholipases D that are toxic for humans and animals are not commonly encountered as constituents of venoms or as products of pathogenic microorganisms. Toxic phospholipases D are present, however, in the venom of the brown recluse spider (Loxosceles reclusa) and in supernatants or filtrates of cultures of Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis. Although the two enzyme toxins are derived from phylogenetically disparate entities, they are similar in molecular weight, charge, substrate specificity, and in several biological activities. They are immunologically distinguishable."
https://openalex.org/W1599831741,"We have compared surface charge and the surface charge density on the polyanions heparin and potassium polyvinyl sulfate (KPVS), as well as on hydrolyzed heparin and KPVS, with their accelerating effect on the inhibitory action of antithrombin III on thrombin. Polyelectrolyte titration of thrombin with KPVS or heparin at pH 7.4 clearly indicates an electrostatic interaction. In contrast, at the same pH no electrostatic interaction is observed between polyanions and antithrombin III. KPVS accelerates the inhibitory action of antithrombin III to the same extent as heparin on the basis of charge equivalence. Heparin and KPVS with a mean distance between two charged centers of less than 0.75 and 0.95 nm, respectively, accelerate strongly whereas hydrolysates with lower charge densities are far less active. The following observations are indicated. Intramolecular neutralization of oppositely charged residues occurs within thrombin, antithrombin III, and partially hydrolyzed heparin. Heparin acts on the antithrombin III-thrombin reaction through cooperative electrostatic binding to thrombin and nonelectrostatic interaction with antithrombin III. This indicates a quasi-catalytic action of the polyelectrolyte. Hydrolysis of only a few N-sulfate residues within the heparin molecule decreases the linear surface charge density to such an extent that the accelerating action is drastically reduced. The loss of accelerating capacity agrees with the sudden loss of counterion condensation due to the decrease of the linear surface charge density beyond limits postulated by Manning in a theory of polyelectrolytes."
https://openalex.org/W1539089855,"The biosynthesis and secretion of dopamine beta-hydroxylase were investigated by radiolabeling rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells in culture. Intracellular dopamine beta-hydroxylase from a crude chromaffin vesicle fraction and secreted dopamine beta-hydroxylase from culture medium were immunoprecipitated using antiserum made against purified bovine soluble dopamine beta-hydroxylase. Analysis of the immunoprecipitated enzyme on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that: 1) the membrane-bound form of the hydroxylase from crude secretory vesicle membrane extracts contained two nonidentical subunits in approximately stoichiometric amounts (Mr = 77,000 and 73,000); 2) the soluble hydroxylase from the lysate of these secretory vesicles was composed predominantly of a single subunit (Mr = 73,000); and 3) the hydroxylase secreted into the medium under resting conditions was also composed of a single subunit (approximate Mr = 73,000). All subunits of the multiple forms of hydroxylase were glycoproteins. Under resting conditions, the rate of secretion of hydroxylase was approximately 6% of total cellular enzyme/15 min. The secreted form of the hydroxylase incorporated [35S]sulfate, whereas no significant [35S]sulfate was incorporated into the cellular forms of enzyme. We propose that in addition to the dopamine beta-hydroxylase which is found in catecholamine storage vesicles and released during stimulus-coupled exocytosis, PC12 cells also have a constitutive secretory pathway for dopamine beta-hydroxylase and that the enzyme released by this second pathway is sulfated."
https://openalex.org/W1965676132,"Coliphage N4 virion encapsulated RNA polymerase shows a marked preference for denatured N4 DNA as a template. We show that initiation on denatured N4 virion DNA occurs with in vivo specificity. The location of the in vivo and in vitro initiation sites and the corresponding DNA sequences were determined. The N4 virion RNA polymerase promoters contain extensive sequence homology from position −18 to position 1, with a conserved GC-rich heptamer centered at −12, and two sets of short inverted repeats. We suggest that the N4 virion RNA polymerase recognizes the promoter only in a novel single-stranded form, and that the formation of the initiation complex is facilitated in vivo by supercoiling and E. coli single-stranded DNA binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W1503485944,"Lipid specificity has been studied in the lipid transfer reaction facilitated by the glycolipid transfer protein from pig brain. The lipid transfer was measured by determining the transfer of a radioisotopically labeled lipid from donor liposomes to either acceptor liposomes or mitochondria. Whenever possible, the liposomes contained 1 mol % of the lipid whose transfer was under study. The transfer protein accelerates the transfer of glucosylceramide, galactosylceramide (GalCer), lactosylceramide (LacCer), galactosylceramide 3-sulfate, globotriaosylceramide, LacCer sulfate, sialosyl-LacCer, globotetraosylceramide, and globopentaosylceramide. An inverse relationship is found between the length of sugar chains in glycosphingolipids and the transfer rates. In addition to the glycosphingolipids, the transfer protein facilitates the transfer of galactosyldiacylglycerol, digalactosyldiacylglycerol, glucosyldiacylglycerol, and diglucosyldiacylglycerol. The protein does not facilitate the transfer of dimannosyldiacylglycerol. The transfer of periodate-oxidized and subsequently reduced derivatives of GalCer and LacCer is facilitated by the transfer protein. The derivatives of GalCer are transferred at lower rates than GalCer, whereas the derivatives of LacCer are transferred at higher rates than LacCer. The transfer protein does not facilitate the transfer of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, cholesterol, or cholesteryloleate. These results suggest that the glycolipid transfer protein from pig brain has specificity to hydroxyl groups present in the sugar residue directly linked to either ceramide or diacylglycerol. The presence of glucose or galactose linked to these hydrophobic moieties makes the glycolipid transferable by the protein."

The final R factor is 0.179 (including 247 water molecules). The folding of the main chain of the independent molecules is the same within experimental error but the same does not generally apply to the side chain stereochemistry. From this we conclude that the folding of a protein structure is basically independent of most of the detailed stereochemistry of its side chains. The side chains of the interface region between the independent molecules display pronounced asymmetry. This asymmetry suggests that dynamic and asymmetrical structural changes take place at the time of oligomerization leading to more energetically favorable interactions for the dimer. Comparison of the structures of the independent molecules of alpha-chymotrypsin with the structure of monomeric gamma-chymotrypsin revealed that although the folding of the three molecules is essentially the same, numerous and significant differences pervade the side chain stereochemistry attributable to general flexibility. The specificity site of alpha-chymotrypsin is occupied by ordered water molecules in a similar way to gamma-chymotrypsin and other proteins. Some of these water molecules are displaced when substrate binds to the enzyme, while the others appear to help identify and position the aromatic side chain in catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1497707727,"The 2-methyl branched-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase was purified to homogeneity from mitochondria of the parasitic nematode, Ascaris suum. The native molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated to be 170,000 by gel filtration. The enzyme migrated as a single protein band with Mr = 42,500 during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis suggesting that the enzyme is a tetramer composed of identical subunits. The enzyme exhibited absorbance maxima at 272, 375, and 452 with a ratio 7.9:0.8:1.0, respectively. FAD content was estimated to be 0.9 mol/mol of subunit and the absorption coefficient of FAD at 452 nm was 14.1 mM-1 cm-1. The purified enzyme dehydrogenated both 2-methylbutyryl-CoA and 2-methylvaleryl-CoA with apparent Km and Vmax values of 18 microM and 1.62 mumol/min/mg and 21 microM and 1.58 mumol/min/mg, respectively. This enzyme also appeared to dehydrogenate butyryl-CoA, valeryl-CoA, and octanoyl-CoA but at a much lower rate. The enzyme did not dehydrogenate propionyl-CoA, isobutyryl-CoA, isovaleryl-CoA, and palmitoyl-CoA. Tiglyl-CoA and 2-methyl-2-pentenoyl-CoA were identified as reaction products from 2-methylbutyryl- and 2-methylvaleryl-CoA, respectively. Dehydrogenating activity with both substrates was inhibited by tiglyl-CoA, acetoacetyl-CoA, and straight chain acyl CoAs of increasing chain length. N-Ethylmaleimide and p-hydroxymercuribenzoate had little effect on dehydrogenating activity but the heavy metals Hg2+ and Ag2+ were potent inhibitors. Physiologically, the dehydrogenase functions as a branched-chain enoyl-CoA reductase. Incubations of A. suum submitochondrial particles, NADH, tiglyl-CoA, purified A. suum electron-transfer flavoprotein, and the 2-methyl branched-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase resulted in the rotenone-sensitive, dehydrogenase-dependent formation of 2-methylbutyryl-CoA."
https://openalex.org/W2056718449,"Nanomolar concentrations of peptidoleukotrienes evoke sustained cerebral edema and arterial constriction. Peptidoleukotrienes are thus considered to play an important role in eliciting cerebral edema after cerebral ischemia and vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage. It was hypothesized that the choroid plexus, the locus of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, might minimize the vasoactivity of locally generated or systemically derived leukotrienes by transporting leukotrienes from cerebrospinal fluid into the blood. Consistent with this hypothesis, leukotriene C4 in vitro was transported into and released from isolated rabbit choroid plexus by a system that was specific, energy-dependent, probenecid-sensitive, and depressed by cold temperatures. The accumulation of leukotriene C4 in the choroid plexus was not dependent on tissue binding or metabolism of leukotriene C4."
https://openalex.org/W1573515586,"Bovine milk lipase was noncovalently bound to a heparin-Sepharose support and a [3H]glycerol/[14C]triolein emulsion was circulated through it. This system, more closely simulating in vivo conditions than the standard lipoprotein lipase assay, was employed to determine the effect of human apo-E and apo-C-II on the lipolysis of the circulating substrate. Both apo-C-II and apo-E produced enhanced lipolysis in comparison to unsupplemented emulsions, at appropriate enzyme densities on the heparin-Sepharose. With high enzyme densities the stimulation produced by apo-E was lost but that of apo-C-II persisted. When apo-E and apo-C-II were added together they produced significantly more lipolysis than when either was added separately. The enhancement of lipolysis produced by apo-E was correlated with the increased binding of triglyceride to the heparin-Sepharose enzyme complex. The effect of additions of both apoproteins to rat intestinal chylomicrons resulted in data quite similar to the triglyceride emulsions. Heparin-Sepharose columns with high and low zones of enzyme density produced greater lipolysis than when the enzyme was distributed more uniformly throughout the column. Perfusions of substrate supplemented with sufficient apo-E to produce maximal binding and lipolysis resulted in a progressive elution of the triglyceride substrate from the column during the perfusion. Free fatty acid:albumin molar ratios greater than 2 resulted in desorption of substrate from the column. This suggests the possibility of regulation of the lipolytic process by the products of lipolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1499300891,"Reactions of human oxyhemoglobin A with iron(II) compounds have been investigated. Human oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) reacts with aquopentacyanoferrate(II), Fe(II)(CN)5H2O3-, to yield hydrogen peroxide, aquomethemoglobin and Fe(III)(CN)5H2O2-. The reaction follows a second order rate law, first order in the pentacyanide and in HbO2. Since reaction rates are lower in the presence of catalase, the H2O2 produced must promote metHb formation in reactions independent of pentacyanide. Changes in concentrations of effectors (e.g. H+, inositol hexaphosphate, Cl-, and Zn2+), alkylation of beta-93 cysteine with N-ethylmaleimide, and substitution at distal histidine (as in Hb Zurich with beta-63 His----Arg) in each case can markedly affect pentacyanide reaction rates demonstrating a fine control of rates by protein structure. Hexacyanoferrate(II) (ferrocyanide) reacts with HbO2 to produce cyano-metHb as well as aquo-metHb but the reaction with the hexacyanide is much slower than with the aquopentacyanide. Iron(II) EDTA converts HbO2 to deoxy-Hb with no evidence for formation of metHb as an intermediate. These findings support a mechanism in which the pentacyanide anion reacts directly with coordinated dioxygen. One-electron transfers to O2 from both pentacyanide iron(II) and heme iron(II) result in the formation of a mu-peroxo intermediate, HbFe(III)-O-O-Fe(III) (CN)5(3-). Hydrolysis of this intermediate yields metHb . H2O, H2O2, and FeIII(CN)5H2O2-. The reaction of HbO2 with Fe(CN)6(4-) must follow an outer sphere electron transfer mechanism. However, the very slow rate that is seen with Fe(CN)6(4-) could arise entirely from the pentacyanide produced from loss of one cyanide ligand from the hexacyanide. Fe(II)EDTA reacts rapidly with free O2 in solution but can not interact directly with the heme-bound O2 of HbAO2. The dynamic character of the O2 binding sites apparently permits access of the Fe2+ of the pentacyanide to coordinated dioxygen but the protein structure is not sufficiently flexible to allow the larger Fe2+EDTA molecule to react with bound O2. It is necessary for maintenance of the oxygen transport function of the red cell for reductants such as the methemoglobin reductase system, glutathione, and ascorbate to be able to reduce metHb to deoxy-Hb. It is also important for these reductants to be unable to donate an electron to HbO2 to yield H2O2 and metHb. Thus, a mechanistic requirement for the delivery of one-electron directly to the dioxygen ligand, if peroxide is to be produced, enables the protein to protect the oxygenated species from those electron donors normally present in the cell by denying these reductants steric access to coordinated O2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

https://openalex.org/W1578550702,"The ribose-modified chromophoric and fluorescent analog of ATP, 2',3'-O-(2,4,6-trinitrocyclohexadienylidene)-ATP (TNP-ATP) (Hiratsuka, T., and Uchida, K. (1973) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 320, 635-647 and Hiratsuka, T. (1976) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 453, 293-297) has been widely used as an ATP analog for various ATPases. Although the corresponding analog of GTP,2',3'-O-(2,4,6-trinitrocyclohexadienylidene)-GTP (TNP-GTP) should be useful for the study of various GTP-requiring enzymes, it is difficult to prepare TNP-GTP by the conventional method. In the present study, we succeeded in the synthesis of TNP-GTP with the use of an alternative method. The analogs of GDP, GMP, and guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p) were also synthesized. Visible absorption and fluorescent properties of TNP-GTP, TNP-GDP, TNP-GMP, and TNP-Gpp(NH)p were quite similar to those of TNP-ATP. TNP-GTP was found to be able to replace GTP as an inhibitor for bovine liver glutamate dehydrogenase. The enzyme was inhibited by TNP-GTP to a maximum extent of 54% at saturating concentrations of the analog with a KI of 2.7 microM. TNP-Gpp(NH)p and other ribose-modified fluorescent analogs of GTP,3'-O-anthraniloyl-GTP and 3'-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-GTP (Hiratsuka, T. (1983) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 742, 496-508), also inhibited the enzymatic activity. Binding of TNP-GTP to the enzyme was characterized by a 5.6-fold enhancement in analog fluorescence. In the presence of NADH, the limiting fluorescence enhancement of the bound analog decreased to 2.7-fold. As determined by fluorometric titration, the maximum number of TNP-GTP binding sites on the enzyme was 1.9 mol/mol of subunit with a KD of 0.66 microM in the absence of NADH and 2.2 mol/mol of subunit with two KD values of 0.11 and 0.71 microM in the presence of NADH. These observations suggest that NADH binding increases the affinity of only 1 mol of the 2 mol of TNP-GTP bound to the enzyme. These spectroscopic and biological properties of TNP-GTP should make this analog useful as a chromophoric and fluorescent probe for studies not only of glutamate dehydrogenase but also of various GTP-requiring enzymes, which have a high specificity for the base moiety of GTP."
https://openalex.org/W1493532528,"A novel approach to the analysis of mass spectrally assayed stable isotope-labeling experiments for studies of biosynthetic pathways is reported. This method determines in a mixture of product molecules, the relative number of product molecules synthesized from the stable labeled precursor pathway and those that were either present prior to the labeling period or were produced by an alternate pathway during the course of an experiment. In addition, the isotopic enrichment of the labeled atoms in the product molecules produced from the stable labeled precursor is determined. These isotopic enrichments represent the isotopic enrichment in the immediate precursors which form the product molecules and would reflect any cellular compartmentation of precursor pools. The feasibility of the method using 15NH4Cl and L-[5-15N]glutamine as precursors to study the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway in isolated rat hepatocytes is demonstrated. The results of these studies show that after incubation of rat hepatocytes with either precursor it is possible to determine the fraction of the uracil nucleotide pool that is formed by the de novo pathway during the period of exposure. The pattern of 15N labeling in the N1 and N3 positions in the uracil moiety is different for the two precursors; however, in most cases the 15N enrichment of each position remained relatively constant for each precursor with either time (15-120 min) or precursor concentration (1 to 10 mM). This method will allow the actual quantitation and isotopic enrichment of product formed by a specific biosynthetic pathway during the course of an experiment and, as such is an improvement over existing labeling techniques."
https://openalex.org/W1513537943,"The hemoglobin found in the nucleated erythrocytes of the arcid blood clam Noetia ponderosa is heterogeneous and consists of two electrophoretic components, Hb-Major and Hb-Minor, present in about 80% and 20% proportions, respectively. Both components are hemoglobin dimers over a wide concentration range based on light-scattering measurements. No higher aggregation states are observed. The oxygen binding by Hb-Major and Hb-Minor is characterized by p50 values of 16.8 and 8.7 mm of Hg and Hill coefficients of 1.4 and 1.2, respectively, at pH 7.0 and 25 degrees C. Neither component exhibits an alkaline Bohr effect. An unusual nonlinear Hill plot is observed for Hb-Major. Hb-Major is composed of two different polypeptide chains and thus is a heterodimer based on sodium dodecyl sulfate/urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. By the same methods, Hb-Minor is a homodimer and may share a common chain with Hb-Major. Amino acid compositions of the two hemoglobins indicate 2 histidines/polypeptide chain which are presumably involved in the coordination of the heme iron. Visible absorption spectra indicate the heme environment is normal in the oxy state but perhaps more constrained in the deoxy state. Oxygen binding as a function of temperature and concentration and binding by the intact erythrocytes indicates the absence of intracellular regulators of oxygen binding."

https://openalex.org/W1483168398,"Antiserum has been prepared against an isolated polypeptide fragment, designated BPS4, which comprises residues 181-211 of the bovine myelin proteolipid. The antiserum recognizes the intact bovine proteolipid protein but not several other polypeptide fragments within the molecule, nor the myelin basic protein, thus demonstrating specificity of the antiserum. In a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, both the major proteolipid and the DM 20 bands observed on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels reacted equally well with the antiserum, indicating that the BPS4 segment is present in both molecular species. The rat myelin proteolipid protein cross-reacted with antiserum against the intact bovine protein but showed minimal cross-reactivity with the antiserum against the bovine BPS4 fragment. This was demonstrated in parallel experiments using three types of preparations, namely, sodium dodecyl sulfate-solubilized myelin, delipidated myelin, and isolated proteolipid apoprotein. The difference between the bovine and rat proteins, which presumably reflects amino acid sequence differences, is thus detectable by the antiserum against the polypeptide fragment but not by the antiserum against the intact protein. Isolated bovine myelin membranes did not bind the antiserum in the absence of detergent or without delipidation. On the other hand, in vesicles reconstituted with the intact bovine apoprotein, the BPS4 segment was oriented on the exterior face of the liposome where it was capable of binding antibody and was susceptible to Pronase digestion."
https://openalex.org/W1498067810,"The high molecular weight basic nuclear proteins from winter flounder sperm are a group of at least 16 proteins which are on average 1000 amino acids long. Despite their large size and complexity, this group of proteins gave rise to only 20 major peptides when digested with trypsin, suggesting that they are closely related to each other and contain sequences which are repeated internally many times over. When the phosphorylated forms of the high molecular weight basic nuclear proteins were isolated from mid-spermatid nuclei and digested with trypsin, six of the major peptides were shown to be phosphorylated. Five of these phosphopeptides were purified, and sequenced by automated Edman degradation. Each of the five contained all or part of the consensus sequence X-Ser(P)-X-Ser(P)-Pro, where X represents lysine or arginine. These phosphorylation sites which may be repeated an average of 20 times in each of the high molecular weight proteins, are different from the phosphorylation sites seen in other basic nuclear proteins. The dephosphorylated high molecular weight basic nuclear proteins from flounder sperm are phosphorylated in vitro at these sites by mid-spermatid nuclei."
