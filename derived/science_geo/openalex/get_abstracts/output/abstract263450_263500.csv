Here we report that SIRT2 maintains a largely cytoplasmic localization during interphase by active nuclear export in a Crm1-dependent manner. We identified a functional, leptomycin B-sensitive, nuclear export signal sequence within SIRT2. During the cell cycle, SIRT2 becomes enriched in the nucleus and is associated with mitotic structures, beginning with the centrosome during prophase, the mitotic spindle during metaphase, and the midbody during cytokinesis. Cells overexpressing wild-type or a catalytically inactive SIRT2 exhibit an increase in multinucleated cells. The findings suggest a novel mechanism of regulating SIRT2 function by nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling, as well as a role for SIRT2 in the nucleus during interphase and throughout mitosis."

Some S100 proteins are also secreted and exert extracellular paracrine and autocrine functions. Experimental results suggest that the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) plays important roles in mediating S100 protein-induced cellular signaling. Here we compared the interaction of two S100 proteins, S100B and S100A6, with RAGE by in vitro assay and in culture of human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Our in vitro binding data showed that S100B and S100A6, although structurally very similar, interact with different RAGE extracellular domains. Our cell assay data demonstrated that S100B and S100A6 differentially modulate cell survival. At micromolar concentration, S100B increased cellular proliferation, whereas at the same concentration, S100A6 triggered apoptosis. Although both S100 proteins induced the formation of reactive oxygen species, S100B recruited phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT and NF-κB, whereas S100A6 activated JNK. More importantly, we showed that S100B and S100A6 modulate cell survival in a RAGE-dependent manner; S100B specifically interacted with the RAGE V and C1 domains and S100A6 specifically interacted with the C1 and C2 RAGE domains. Altogether these results highlight the complexity of S100/RAGE cellular signaling.

Altogether these results highlight the complexity of S100/RAGE cellular signaling. The S100 proteins constitute the largest family of EF-hand calcium-binding proteins. They present 25–65% homology in their amino acid sequence (1Fritz G. Kim C.W. Messerschmidt A. Bode W. Cygler M. Handbook of Metalloproteins. 3. 2004: 529-540, Wiley, Chichester, UKGoogle Scholar, 2Santamaria-Kisiel L. Kim A.C. Shaw G.S. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 201-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). All S100 proteins, except S100G, form homo- and heterodimers. Each subunit contains two EF-hand type calcium-binding sites. The C-terminal EF-hand presents the classical “canonical” EF-hand motif common to all EF-hand proteins and displays the highest affinity for calcium (KD = 20–50 μm). In contrast, the N-terminal “pseudo-EF-hand” is typical for the S100 proteins and binds calcium with lower affinity (KD = 200–500 μm) (3Heizmann C.W. J. Pediatr. 2005; 147: 731-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 4Heizmann C.W. Kim G.E. Galichet A. Carafoli E. Brini M.

The S100 proteins possess various intra- and extracellular functions. Intracellular functions range from regulation of cell motility, protein phosphorylation, and calcium homeostasis to tumor progression or suppression. Most S100 proteins undergo a conformational change upon calcium binding allowing them to interact with target proteins, although some S100 proteins can also interact with their target in a calcium-independent way (4Heizmann C.W. Kim G.E. Galichet A. Carafoli E. Brini M. Calcium Signaling and Disease. 2007: 93-138, Springer, New YorkGoogle Scholar). Interestingly several members of the S100 protein family have been shown to interact with the same target. For instance, S100A4, S100A5, S100A11, and S100A13 regulate in vitro activity of aldolase A in a calcium-independent manner (4Heizmann C.W. Kim G.E. Galichet A. Carafoli E. Brini M. Calcium Signaling and Disease. 2007: 93-138, Springer, New YorkGoogle Scholar). The interaction of several S100 proteins with the same target can also result in different effects on the target: whereas S100A1 stimulates phosphoglucomutase activity in vitro, S100B inhibits this enzyme. Interestingly a few S100 proteins are secreted and exert cytokine functions (4Heizmann C.W. Kim G.E. Galichet A. Carafoli E. Brini M. Calcium Signaling and Disease. 2007: 93-138, Springer, New YorkGoogle Scholar). S100B is secreted by astrocytes, and increased S100B concentration has been found in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients suffering from brain trauma, ischemia, or Alzheimer disease (6Rothermundt M. Kim M. Prehn J.H. Arolt V. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2003; 60: 614-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). S100A1 is released in the serum of patients suffering from acute myocardial damage and promotes neurite outgrowth at micromolar concentration (7Huttunen H.J. Kim J. Sorci G. Agneletti A.L. Donato R.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 865-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). S100A4 secretion in culture medium was estimated to be about 10 μm, a concentration that induces neuritogenesis in primary rat neurons (9Duarte W.R. Kim T. Takenaga K. Ohya K. Ishikawa I. Kasugai S.

Biol. 2006; 26: 3625-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Similarly S100A12 is found in synovial fluid of patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis and also triggers neuritogenesis of hippocampal neurons when added extracellularly at submicromolar to micromolar concentrations (11Mikkelsen S.E.

Geczy C.L. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2001; 69: 986-994PubMed Google Scholar). Finally S100A6 was found in the extracellular medium of breast cancer cells (13Mbeunkui F. Kim B.J. Shevde L.A. Pannell L.K. J. Proteome Res. 2007; 6: 2993-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). S100B is mainly expressed in the brain and primarily in astrocytes of the human cortex and hippocampus but is also present in certain populations of oligodendrocytes and neurons (14Gerlach R. Kim G.

In contrast, S100A6 is mainly expressed in neurons in restricted areas of the brain (amygdala and entorhinal cortex) and found in a few astrocytes (19Yamashita N. Kim E.C. Schafer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Kosaka T. J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 404: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 20Yamashita N. Kim K. Ilg E.C. Schafer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Kosaka T. Brain Res. 1997; 778: 388-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The expression of both S100A6 and S100B proteins has been shown to be modulated during human brain development (21Tiu S.C. Kim W.Y. Heizmann C.W. Schafer B.W. Shu S.Y. Yew D.T. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 2000; 119: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Higher levels of S100B have also been detected in the serum of patients after brain trauma or ischemia and of patients with Alzheimer disease or Down syndrome (6Rothermundt M. Kim M. Prehn J.H. Arolt V. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2003; 60: 614-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Interestingly overexpression of S100A6 has also been observed in patients suffering from Alzheimer disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (22Hoyaux D. Kim A. Van den Bosch L. Belot N. Martin J.J.

EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3868-3878Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). RAGE is a member of the immunoglobulin-like cell surface receptor superfamily composed of three extracellular domains, a “V” type immunoglobulin-like domain followed by two “C” type domains, a single transmembrane-spanning helix, and a short cytosolic domain (27Neeper M. Kim A.M. Brett J. Yan S.D. Wang F. Pan Y.C. Elliston K. Stern D. Shaw A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14998-15004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additional RAGE isoforms lacking the transmembrane and cytosolic regions (soluble RAGE (sRAGE)) or the “V” immunoglobulin domain (NtRAGE) were identified in human brain suggesting isoform-specific functions for the receptor (28Ding Q. Kim J.N. Neurosci. Lett. 2005; 373: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). RAGE is expressed at high levels during brain development, but its expression is low in adult human brain and restricted to specific population of neurons and glial cells (29Malherbe P. Kim J.G. Gaillard H. Thompson A. Diener C. Schuler A. Huber G. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 71: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). RAGE is also expressed in other cell types such as monocytes/macrophages, endothelial cells, mesangial cells, or smooth muscle cells (30Brett J. Kim A.M. Yan S.D. Zou Y.S. Weidman E. Pinsky D. Nowygrod R. Neeper M. Przysiecki C. Shaw A. Migheli A. Stern D. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 1699-1712PubMed Google Scholar). It is also overexpressed in pathologic states such as oxidative stress or inflammation (31Schmidt A.M. Kim S.D. Yan S.F. Stern D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1498: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). In this study, we compared the interaction of S100A6 and S100B with sRAGE both in vitro by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and in cell assays using human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Our SPR experiments showed that both S100 proteins bind to RAGE and suggested that S100A6 and S100B do not recognize the same binding site. We showed that, at micromolar concentration, extracellular S100B and S100A6 trigger opposite effects on cells: whereas S100B activated cell proliferation, S100A6 enhanced apoptosis. More importantly, we showed that binding of S100A6 and S100B induces the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) but also triggers different signaling pathways: whereas S100B-RAGE interaction resulted in the activation of PI 3-kinase/AKT and NF-κB transcription factor, S100A6-RAGE interaction induced the activation/phosphorylation of JNK. Our results suggest that the two S100 proteins trigger distinct RAGE-dependent signaling pathways in vivo. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Human S100B and S100A6—Recombinant S100B and S100A6 were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (32Hsieh H.L. Kim B.W. Weigle B. Heizmann C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 316: 949-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The purity of the proteins was checked by SDS-PAGE, Western blot, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. After dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), bacterial endotoxin was removed from the purified S100B and S100A6 by treatment with Affi-Prep polymyxin B matrix (Bio-Rad) overnight at 4 °C. The absence of endotoxin contamination was assayed using the commercially available E-TOXATE kit (Sigma). S100B and S100A6 were aliquoted by 100 μl and kept at–20 °C prior to use. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Expression and Purification of Soluble RAGE and the RAGE Domains—sRAGE composed of the three extracellular immunoglobulin domains was expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified as described previously (33Ostendorp T. Kim M. Leclerc E. Kleinert P. Kroneck P.M. Heizmann C.W. Fritz G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 347: 4-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The purified RAGE V, VC1, and C2 domains were expressed in E. coli and purified as described previously (24Dattilo B.M. Kim G. Leclerc E. Kooi C.W. Heizmann C.W. Chazin W.J. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 6957-6970Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Antibodies—The generation of rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the RAGE V, C1, and C2 domains has been described previously (33Ostendorp T. Kim M. Leclerc E. Kleinert P. Kroneck P.M. Heizmann C.W. Fritz G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 347: 4-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The polyclonal IgGs were affinity-purified using a HiTrap protein A column (GE Healthcare) following the manufacturer's protocol and were dialyzed against PBS. These RAGE polyclonal antibodies were either used individually or mixed together for the purpose of the experiments. Nonspecific mouse and rabbit immunoglobulins (IgGs) and the mouse monoclonal antibody (MAB1145) directed against the C1 domain of RAGE were from R&D Systems and were resuspended in PBS. The rabbit polyclonal antibodies against S100B and S100A6 were from Dako, the monoclonal mouse anti-β-tubulin 1 was from Sigma, the goat polyclonal anti-flotillin 1 was from AbCam, and the rabbit polyclonal antibodies anti-p-JNK (Thr-183/Tyr-185), -JNK, -p-AKT (Ser-473), and anti-AKT were from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. Other Reagents—SN50, SP600125, and LY294002 were from Calbiochem; ionomycin, N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), and 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenyl-indole (DAPI) were from Sigma; and 2′, 7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate was from Molecular Probes. Surface Plasmon Resonance—sRAGE was purified from HEK293 cells as described previously (26Ostendorp T. Kim E. Galichet A. Koch M. Demling N. Weigle B. Heizmann C.W. Kroneck P.M. Fritz G. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3868-3878Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The V, VC1, and C2 domains were purified from E. coli as described previously (24Dattilo B.M. Kim G. Leclerc E. Kooi C.W. Heizmann C.W. Chazin W.J. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 6957-6970Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). sRAGE and the RAGE domains were immobilized onto CM5 Biacore sensor chips according to procedures described previously (34Leclerc E. Kim D. Ball H. Sakurai H. Legname G. Serban A. Prusiner S.B. Burton D.R. Williamson R.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1547-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly the proteins or fragments were diluted at 50 μg/ml in 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5, and injected over the sensor chips that had been preactivated with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide as recommended by the manufacturer. After injection of the proteins, the surface of the sensor chip was then blocked with ethanolamine prior to measurements. About 4,000 RU were obtained with sRAGE, and 5000 RU were obtained for the V and VC1 domains. Due to difficulties in immobilization, only 300 RU were obtained after immobilization with the C2 domain. A series of increasing concentrations of S100B (from 0.78 to 12.6 μm) and S100A6 (from 0.125 to 10 μm) were then injected over the flow cells in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.005% P20. The sensorgrams were analyzed by global analysis using BiaEvaluation 3.1 software (35Roden L.D. Kim D.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 1073-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Between each cycle of binding, the surface was regenerated by 1-min contact with 0.5 m EDTA followed by 1-min contact with 50 mm sodium borate, pH 8.5, containing 1 m NaCl. Cell Culture and Treatment—The human U87-MG glioblastoma cells (ATCC) were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (BioConcept), 2 mm glutamine, and streptomycin/penicillin. After plating in a 12-well plate, U87-MG cells were cultivated for 24 h and were then serum-starved for an additional 24 h. Cells were then stimulated without serum for 20 min with Me2SO, H2O, 2 mm EGTA, or 1 μm ionomycin in medium supplemented with 1.5 mm CaCl2. The cell culture media were harvested after the different treatments and centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 5 min to remove cells. The human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y (ATCC) was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and streptomycin/penicillin. After plating, cells were cultured with 10% fetal bovine serum for 24 h and were then serum-starved for an additional 24 h before treatment with S100B or S100A6 in serum-free medium. SP600125 and LY294002 were dissolved in Me2SO, whereas NAC and SN50 were dissolved in water. Each inhibitor was added to the cells in serum-free medium simultaneously to the S100 proteins at the indicated concentration and for the indicated time periods and then incubated at 37 °C. Control cells were treated with a similar amount of Me2SO or water or with the same concentration of inhibitor in the absence of S100 protein. Both control and treated cells were harvested at the same time. Purified RAGE domains, sRAGE, and RAGE antibodies were all diluted in PBS. Each component was added to the cells in serum-free medium simultaneously to the S100 proteins at the indicated concentration and for the indicated period of time, and the incubation was performed at 37 °C. Control cells were treated either with PBS or with the same concentration of RAGE domain, sRAGE, or RAGE antibody in the absence of S100 protein. Both control and treated cells were harvested at the same time. S100A6 Immunoassay—The amount of S100A6 present in the cell culture medium was determined by a “sandwich” ELISA method. Briefly an S100A6-specific rabbit antibody was coated onto an ELISA plate overnight at 4 °C in the presence of 100 mm NaH2PO4, 100 mm Na2HPO4, pH 8.1. After blocking with 10% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 3 h at room temperature and washing with PBS-T (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20), S100A6 standards and the supernatants of U87-MG cells (100 μl) were added to the wells in triplicate overnight at 4 °C. The wells were then washed three times with PBS-T, and a second S100A6-specific goat antibody (19Yamashita N. Kim E.C. Schafer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Kosaka T. J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 404: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) was added in the presence of 10% bovine serum albumin in PBS-T. After a 3-h incubation at room temperature, the wells were washed three times with PBS-T, and wells were then incubated with an anti-goat antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) for 2 h at room temperature. After a final washing procedure, the HRP substrate tetramethylbenzidine (TMB Peroxidase EIA Substrate kit, Bio-Rad) was added to the wells, and the reaction was stopped by addition of H2SO4. The HRP products were read at 450 nm using an ELISA plate reader (TECAN). The absorbances obtained from cell culture medium were compared with a standard curve. Specificity of the ELISA test for S100A6 was assessed by the absence of cross-reactivity with S100B, S100A1, or S100A12. Cell Viability Assays—Cell viability was determined using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (Roche Applied Science) as instructed by the manufacturer. Percentage of viability was determined by comparing the number of viable cells in treated cultures to the number of viable cells in a control culture treated in parallel with PBS for an equivalent time. Cell cycle distribution analysis was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Isolation and staining of the SH-SY5Y cells were performed using the CycleTEST Plus DNA kit (BD Biosciences), and cell cycle analysis was then performed with a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur flow cytometer. A total of 104 cells were analyzed for each sorting, and quantification of cell cycle distribution was performed with CellQuest Pro software. Apoptotic cells were detected by the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay using the In Situ Cell Death Detection kit with fluorescein (Roche Applied Science). Detection of apoptotic cells and counterstaining with DAPI were performed according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. The slides were viewed and photographed by using a fluorescence Zeiss microscope, and cells stained with DAPI and by TUNEL assay were then counted on random fields and by scoring at least 1,000 cells per experimental group. Caspase 3/7 activity was measured using the caspase 3/7 luminescence assay kit according to the directions of the manufacturer (Promega). Cells were incubated with the caspase-Glo 3/7 substrate for 1 h at room temperature, and caspase 3/7 was measured by luminescence quantification using a microplate reader (TECAN). Incorporation of 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) into newly synthesized DNA was performed as a cell proliferation assay. Cells were treated for 24 h with S100B in the presence of 10 μm BrdUrd. Immunofluorescence detection of BrdUrd incorporation was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Applied Science). Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI, and slides were visualized by fluorescence microscopy and photographed with a digital camera. Cells stained with DAPI and with incorporated BrdUrd were then counted on random fields and by scoring at least 1,000 cells per experimental group. ROS Formation—SH-SY5Y cells were seeded in 96-well plates in RPMI 1640 containing 10% serum. After 24 h, cells were serum-starved for an additional 24 h and were then treated with or without S100B or S100A6 for the indicated time periods. 30 min prior to harvesting, cells were incubated with 10 μm cellpermeable fluorescent dye 2′, 7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate and washed with PBS, and fluorescence was measured with a microplate reader (excitation, 485 nm; emission, 520 nm). Transfection and NF-κB Activation Assay—SH-SY5Y cells were co-transfected with the pNFκB-Luc construct (Clontech) and a plasmid containing the β-galactosidase gene using the FuGENE®HD transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) for 24 h in the presence of serum according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were serum-starved for 24 h before being treated with S100B or S100A6. After 24 h in culture, cells were washed with PBS and lysed in Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was monitored using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) using a microplate reader. β-Galactosidase activity was quantified by mixing cell lysate with an equal volume of 2× β-galactosidase assay mixture (120 mm Na2HPO4, 80 mm NaH2PO4, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1.33 mg/ml O-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside) and incubation at 37 °C; the absorbance was read at 420 nm. Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Western Blot Analysis—The cells were washed twice with PBS and scraped from the plates in lysis buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-10, 10 nm NaF, 10 nm β-glycerophosphate, and 1 mm Na3VO4) in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The membrane fraction and soluble proteins were prepared as described previously (36Culvenor J.G. Kim N.T. Ryan M.T. Canterford L. Hoke D.E. Williamson N.A. McLean C.A. Masters C.L. Evin G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). SH-SY5Y cells were washed with PBS, scraped from the plates, and centrifuged, and then lysis buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, containing Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) was added to the cell pellet. Cells were homogenized with a glass Dounce homogenizer and then centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. The membrane pellet was resuspended in sucrose homogenization buffer with protease inhibitors and stored at–80 °C. The supernatant contained the cytosolic fraction. The protein concentration of both fractions was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). For SDS-PAGE, an equal amount of protein was loaded on a 10% bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen). The SDS gel was transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The blot was blocked with 4% fat-free milk powder in TBS-T (Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20) and incubated with the primary antibody dissolved in TBS-T containing 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation, the blot was washed with TBS-T and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody (diluted in TBS-T with 5% bovine serum albumin at 1:10,000 for the anti-mouse, 1:5,000 for the anti-goat, and 1:10,000 for the anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated with HRP. Detection was performed using a chemoluminescent HRP substrate (Pierce). The dilution of the primary antibodies were as follow: anti-β-tubulin 1, 1:10,000; anti-flotillin 1, 1:1,000, anti-p-JNK, 1:1,000; anti-JNK, 1:1,000; anti-p-AKT, 1:1,000; and anti-AKT, 1:1,000. Immunofluorescence Staining of SH-SY5Y Cells—Immunofluorescence staining of SH-SY5Y cells grown on coverslips was performed as follow. Serum-starved cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 15 min, and washed with PBS. The cells were then immunostained with the anti-C1 RAGE antibody diluted at 1:500 for 1 h, washed with PBS, and incubated with the Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody diluted at 1:200 for 1 h. DNA was counterstained with DAPI. Coverslips were mounted on slides prior to analysis using a fluorescence microscope. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis between the different groups was determined using the one-way analysis of variance, and where indicated individual comparison was performed by analysis of variance with posthoc analysis using SPSS software. S100B and S100A6 Bind Differently to RAGE—We have shown previously by surface plasmon resonance that S100B binds to sRAGE (26Ostendorp T. Kim E. Galichet A. Koch M. Demling N. Weigle B. Heizmann C.W.

Here we show that both S100B and S100A6 interacted with glycosylated sRAGE purified from HEK293 cells (Fig. 1A). Analysis of the S100B sensorgrams, after fitting with a two-independent binding site model, revealed binding constants of KD1 = 3.6 μm (62% species) and KD2 = 2.2 nm (38% species) (Table 1). The sensorgrams of S100A6 could also be fit with a two-binding site model with binding constants of KD1 = 0.6 μm (51% species) and KD2 = 0.5 μm"
https://openalex.org/W2081673277,"To better understand the dual, tumour-suppressive and tumour-promoting function of transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta), we analysed mammary epithelial NMuMG cells in response to short and long-term TGFbeta exposure. NMuMG cells became proliferation-arrested and apoptotic after exposure to TGFbeta for 2-5 days, whereas surviving cells underwent epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). After chronic TGFbeta exposure (2-3 weeks), however, NMuMG cells became resistant to proliferation arrest and apoptosis, showing sustained EMT instead (TD cells). EMT was fully reversed by a pharmacologic TGFbeta-receptor-I kinase inhibitor or withdrawal of TGFbeta for 6-12 days. Interestingly, both cell cycle arresting/proapoptotic (Smads, p38 kinase) and antiapoptotic, proliferation and EMT-promoting signalling pathways (PI3K-PKB/Akt, ERK) were co-suppressed to low, but significant levels. Except for PI3K-Akt, TGFbeta-dependent downregulation of these signalling pathways in transdifferentiated (TD) cells was fully reversed upon TGFbeta withdrawal, together with partial re-induction of proliferation arrest and apoptosis. Co-injection of non-tumorigenic NMuMG cells with tumour-forming CHO cells oversecreting exogenous TGFbeta1 (CHO-TGFbeta1) allowed outgrowth of epithelioid cells in CHO-TGFbeta1 cell-induced tumours. These epithelial islands enhanced CHO-TGFbeta1 tumour cell proliferation, possibly due to chemokines (for example, JE/MCP-1) secreted by NMuMG/TD cells. We conclude that suppression of antiproliferative, proapoptotic TGFbeta signalling in TD cells may permit TGFbeta-dependent proliferation, survival and EMT-enhancing signalling pathways to act at low levels. Thus, TGFbeta may modulate its own signalling to facilitate switching from tumour suppression to tumour progression."

https://openalex.org/W1971407834,"Protein translocation across the peroxisomal membrane requires the concerted action of numerous peroxins. One central component of this machinery is Pex5p, the cycling receptor for matrix proteins. Pex5p recognizes newly synthesized proteins in the cytosol and promotes their translocation across the peroxisomal membrane. After this translocation step, Pex5p is recycled back into the cytosol to start a new protein transport cycle. Here, we show that mammalian Pex5p is ubiquitinated at the peroxisomal membrane. Two different types of ubiquitination were detected, one of which is thiol-sensitive, involves Cys11 of Pex5p, and is necessary for the export of the receptor back into the cytosol. Together with mechanistic data recently described for yeast Pex5p, these findings provide strong evidence for the existence of Pex4p- and Pex22p-like proteins in mammals.

Together with mechanistic data recently described for yeast Pex5p, these findings provide strong evidence for the existence of Pex4p- and Pex22p-like proteins in mammals. Protein translocation across the peroxisomal membrane requires a complex machinery comprising many different peroxins. In yeasts, 15–16 peroxins have been implicated in this process, whereas in mammals, only 10 are known so far (reviewed in Refs. 1Baker A. Kim I.A. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2005; 8: 640-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar and 2Heiland I. Kim R. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2362-2372Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). For several of the extra peroxins found in yeasts, it is presently unclear if their apparent absence in mammals is related simply to a high rate of gene divergence during evolution, hampering the identification of the mammalian genes by homology searches, or if it reflects the existence of mechanistic differences in the protein import pathways of distantly related organisms. The fact that differences of this type do exist feeds this uncertainty. A good example is provided by the import pathways of matrix proteins possessing a type 2 peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS) 3The abbreviations used are: PTS, peroxisomal targeting signal; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino) propanesulfonic acid; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); GST, glutathione S-transferase; Ub, ubiquitin; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; DTT, dithiothreitol.3The abbreviations used are: PTS, peroxisomal targeting signal; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino) propanesulfonic acid; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); GST, glutathione S-transferase; Ub, ubiquitin; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; DTT, dithiothreitol. (3Lazarow P.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 1599-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). PTS2-containing proteins are recognized by Pex7p and transported to the peroxisome by Pex5p in many organisms. However, although yeasts also possess Pex5p, they do not rely on this peroxin for this purpose. Instead, Pex20p or Pex18p/Pex21p escorts the Pex7p-cargo protein complex to the organelle (reviewed in Ref. 4Schliebs W. Kim W.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).Despite these differences, all organisms characterized up to now use Pex5p to target PTS1-containing proteins to the peroxisomal matrix. These proteins are characterized by the existence of a conserved tripeptide at their extreme C terminus that is recognized by Pex5p (5Brocard C. Kim A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 1565-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). According to current models (1Baker A. Kim I.A. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2005; 8: 640-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 2Heiland I. Kim R. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2362-2372Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), Pex5p interacts with newly synthesized matrix proteins in the cytosol and transports them to the peroxisomal membrane. Here, Pex5p participates in a complex network of protein-protein interactions involving several components of the importomer (6Agne B. Kim N.M. Niederhoff K. Einwachter H. Rehling P. Sickmann A.

FEBS J. 2006; 273: 3804-3815Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These interactions ultimately result in the insertion of Pex5p into the organelle membrane with the concomitant translocation of the cargo protein across the membrane (10Azevedo J.E. Kim J.

Rev. 2005; 6: 738-742Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Remarkably, all available evidence suggests that energy in the form of ATP is not required at these steps. The need for ATP hydrolysis occurs only at the next step, when Pex5p is exported from the importomer by the action of Pex1p and Pex6p (12Miyata N. Kim Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10822-10832Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 13Oliveira M.E. Kim A.M. Pinto R.A. Sá-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 817-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Then, a new cycle of protein transportation can be initiated.Using an in vitro import/export system, Erdmann and co-workers (15Platta H.W. Kim F. Schlee D. Grunau S. Girzalsky W. Erdmann R. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) have shown recently that export of yeast Pex5p from the importomer requires Pex4p and Pex22p. They also demonstrated that a small fraction of membrane-bound yeast Pex5p can be monoubiquitinated by recombinant Pex4p, although the lability of this ubiquitinated Pex5p population precluded its detection in the in vitro import/export experiments. These data led the authors to propose that yeast Pex5p has to be monoubiquitinated to be recognized by the export machinery. Whether or not such a step also applies to the mechanism of protein translocation in mammals is not clear at present. In fact, many independent observations could suggest otherwise. For instance, although several Pex4p-like proteins can be found in the human proteome, the protein displaying the highest similarity to yeast/plant Pex4p has been reported to be localized in the nucleus (16Zolman B.K. Kim M. Silva I.D. Bartel B. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 3422-3435Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In the case of Pex22p, no evidence for the existence of the corresponding gene in mammals could be found, despite several attempts (17Kiel J.A. Kim M. van der Klei I.J.

Proteomic approaches aiming at defining the protein repertoire of mammalian peroxisomes also failed in identifying these peroxins (19Islinger M. Kim G.H. Li K.W. Loos M. Volkl A. J. Biol.

Furthermore, the genes involved in the so-called peroxisomal biogenesis disorders have been identified for all complementation groups presently known, and none corresponds to a PEX4- or PEX22-like gene (21Steinberg S.J. Kim G. Raymond G.V. Braverman N.E. Moser A.B. Moser H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 1733-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Finally, despite the numerous experiments that have been described by several groups over the years aiming at characterizing the Pex5p-mediated protein import cycle in mammals, no evidence for a ubiquitinated Pex5p population was ever found. Obviously, all these facts represent negative observations that may lose significance in face of positive results. This is, we believe, what happens in this work.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIn Vitro Import Reactions—Rat liver post-nuclear supernatants were prepared in SE buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2, and 1 mm EDTA-NaOH, pH 7.2) exactly as described previously (22Gouveia A.M.

After 30 min on ice, the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatants were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with either glutathione-Sepharose beads (50-μl bed volume) or 5 mg of protein G-Sepharose previously incubated with 10 μg of a monoclonal antibody directed against ubiquitin (clone FK2, BIOMOL International). An anti-c-Myc antibody (10 μg; clone 9E10, Roche Applied Science) was used as a negative control in the immunoprecipitation experiments. The Sepharose beads were then washed three times with 1 ml of solubilization buffer and once with the same buffer lacking detergent and incubated with Laemmli gel loading buffer (lacking reducing agents) supplemented with 10 mm NEM at 45 °C for 30 min. Where indicated, samples received 100 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) and were then heated at 60 °C for 15 min.RESULTSIn the experiments presented below, we will make frequent reference to two peroxisomal membrane-associated Pex5p populations. Their properties have been described (see Ref. 27Carvalho A.F. Kim C.P. Pinto M.P. Alencastre I.S. Costa-Rodrigues J. Fransen M. Sá-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 1141-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar and references cited therein). However, for the sake of clarity, a summary is presented here. Both populations represent Pex5p molecules passing through the importomer during the protein transport cycle and are operationally defined by a protease protection assay and SDS-PAGE analysis under reducing conditions. The so-called stage 2 Pex5p exposes the majority of its mass to the matrix of the organelle and ∼2 kDa of its N terminus to the cytosol as assessed with proteinase K; stage 3 Pex5p is completely resistant to this protease as long as the organelles are kept intact. The conversion of stage 2 into stage 3 Pex5p is a relatively slow process. In contrast, the subsequent export of stage 3 Pex5p into the cytosol is very rapid at 37 °C, provided that ATP is not limiting. In fact, under these conditions, stage 3 Pex5p is a minor species. In the absence of exogenous ATP (i.e. in the presence of the small amounts of ATP derived from the post-nuclear supernatant and the reticulocyte lysates used in these experiments), stage 3 Pex5p is easily detectable; in the presence of ATPγS, it becomes the most abundant species. It is also important to note that ATPγS blocks the export step of Pex5p from the peroxisomal membrane. Because of the fact that a significant fraction of the peroxisomal importomer present in our reactions is already occupied by endogenous rat liver Pex5p (13Oliveira M.E. Kim A.M. Pinto R.A. Sá-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39483-39488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the addition of ATPγS at the beginning of the reactions results in a low import rate of the 35S-labeled peroxin.Ubiquitination of Pex5p in yeasts is well documented and serves two different purposes (14Platta H.W. Kim S. Rosenkranz K. Girzalsky W. Erdmann R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 817-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 15Platta H.W. Kim F. Schlee D. Grunau S. Girzalsky W. Erdmann R. J.

J. 2004; 384: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Polyubiquitination of Pex5p is observed in several peroxisomal deficient mutant strains and reflects the existence of a quality control system aiming at removing arrested/entangled Pex5p molecules from the importomer; monoubiquitination of Pex5p was recently linked to the export of yeast Pex5p from the importomer.In an attempt to determine whether mammalian Pex5p is also poly/monoubiquitinated, we initiated a series of in vitro import experiments using 35S-labeled Pex5p and Pex5p(C11S). The substitution of Cys11 with serine blocks the ATP-dependent export step of Pex5p from the peroxisomal membrane by specifically impeding the stage 2-to-stage 3 transition (27Carvalho A.F. Kim C.P. Pinto M.P. Alencastre I.S. Costa-Rodrigues J. Fransen M. Sá-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 1141-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, high amounts of this protein can be accumulated at the peroxisomal membrane in in vitro import reactions containing ATP, a property that should increase our chances to detect ubiquitination of Pex5p. To facilitate the identification of putative ubiquitinated Pex5p or Pex5p(C11S) molecules, a recombinant GST-Ub fusion protein was included in some of the reactions. GST-Ub is 28 kDa larger than ubiquitin alone, and thus, a similar increase in the molecular mass of in vitro ubiquitinated molecules should be observed in the presence of this ubiquitin analog. Finally, considering that any putative ubiquitinated molecules should be, in principle, exposed to the cytosol (and thus protease accessible), both protease-treated and -untreated reactions were analyzed.The results of one of these experiments are presented in Fig. 1. When the protease treatment step was omitted, a faint radioactive protein band migrating above Pex5p(C11S) (apparent molecular mass of 100 kDa) could be detected upon SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (Fig. 1, upper panel, lane 5). This abnormally migrating protein band was no longer visible when the import reaction was supplemented with GST-Ub. Instead, a new species displaying an apparent molecular mass of 130 kDa was observed (lane 11), suggesting that it represents a ubiquitinated Pex5p(C11S) population (see also below). Occasionally, a similar 100-kDa protein band was also detected when Pex5p was used in these experiments, although the fraction of the in vitro imported protein displaying such a behavior was always much smaller than that detected with Pex5p(C11S) (compare lanes 2 and 5). This observation could suggest that this ubiquitination event is linked to the existence of a quality control system acting on defective Pex5p molecules, although further data are necessary to clarify this issue.To our surprise, inclusion of GST-Ub in the import reactions revealed a phenomenon of a completely different magnitude. Indeed, in the protease-treated aliquots, stage 2 Pex5p was no longer the predominant species in the ATP-supplemented reaction (Fig. 1, lower panel, compare lanes 2 and 8). A fully protease-protected species corresponding to (or resembling) stage 3 Pex5p was the most abundant species. Notably, the total amount of protease-protected Pex5p in this sample was similar to that detected for Pex5p(C11S) under the same conditions (compare lanes 8 and 11). Clearly, GST-Ub strongly inhibited the export of Pex5p from the importomer, an observation that provides, for the first time, evidence that ubiquitin is involved in the Pex5p-mediated import pathway also in mammals.The finding that GST-Ub blocks peroxisomal Pex5p at the stage 3 level together with the fact that Pex5p(C11S) is unable to reach this stage led us to address the possibility that Cys11 might be the residue modified by ubiquitin. In fact, this hypothesis was formulated before for both Pex5p and Pex20p, a Pex5p-like peroxin from Pichia pastoris (27Carvalho A.F. Kim C.P. Pinto M.P. Alencastre I.S. Costa-Rodrigues J. Fransen M.

Chem. 2007; 282: 7424-7430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This type of ubiquitin-conjugated molecule cannot be detected under reducing conditions because the bond linking the carboxyl group of the C-terminal glycine of ubiquitin to the thiol group of a cysteine is thiol-sensitive (33Ciechanover A. Kim S. Heller H. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2537-2542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we subjected 35S-labeled Pex5p and Pex5p(C11S) to import reactions containing ATP and GST-Ub, but this time, the reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under both reducing and nonreducing conditions. Two additional questions were addressed in this experiment. 1) How fast is this ubiquitination event? 2) Does it occur in the soluble (cytosolic) phase of the reactions, in the organelle fraction, or in both? As shown in Fig. 2A, a prominent thiol-sensitive 130-kDa protein band was visible in the Pex5p-containing organelles (compare upper and lower panels). Data indicating that this protein band corresponds to GST-Ub-Pex5p are presented in Fig. 2B. In agreement with the results described above, Pex5p(C11S) was also modified by this ubiquitin analog. However, in this case, treatment with DTT did not destroy the GST-Ub-conjugated species, as expected (see also Fig. 2B). Another important property differentiates these two GST-Ub-conjugated populations. In the case of Pex5p, this species was easily detectable already after 5 min of import, whereas with Pex5p(C11S), it was necessary to incubate the reactions for 45 min to generate similar amounts of the 130-kDa band protein (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2Cys11 of in vitro imported Pex5p forms a thiol ester conjugate with GST-Ub. A, 35S-labeled Pex5p or Pex5p(C11S) was subjected to import reactions in the presence of ATP and GST-Ub. At time 0, one aliquot of the import reactions was withdrawn, supplemented with NEM (20 mm), and kept on ice (T lanes). Three other aliquots were removed from the import reactions at the indicated time periods. These aliquots were supplemented with NEM and separated into an organelle fraction (Pellet) and a soluble phase (Supernatant) by centrifugation. The samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing (lower panel) or nonreducing (upper panel) conditions. To avoid protein overloading problems, only one-third of the Supernatant and T samples were analyzed in these gels. The arrowheads indicate the 130-kDa species. Note that the 130-kDa bands detected with Pex5p and Pex5p(C11S) in the upper panel seem to display different migrations. This is due to a small distortion of this gel because the two bands display exactly the same migration when analyzed side-by-side. B, organelles from import reactions containing Pex5p or Pex5p(C11S) performed in the presence of GST-Ub and ATP were isolated by centrifugation, resuspended in solubilization buffer, and subjected to a pulldown assay using glutathione-Sepharose beads. The total (T), unbound (Unb), and bound (in this case, treated (B+) or not (B–) with DTT) fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Three equivalents of the bound fractions in relation to the total and unbound samples were loaded onto the gel. C, 35S-labeled ΔC1Pex5p was subjected to import reactions in the presence of ATP and GST-Ub or GST-Control. At the end of the 37 °C incubation, each reaction was divided into three equal aliquots that were treated (+PK) or not (–PK) with proteinase K, as specified in the legend to Fig. 1. The organelles were then isolated by centrifugation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing (+DTT) or nonreducing (–DTT) conditions. The thiol-sensitive GST-Ub-ΔC1Pex5p species and stage 2 and 3 ΔC1Pex5p are indicated. I lanes, 10% of the reticulocyte lysate containing ΔC1Pex5p used in each lane.

Although the results described above already suggest that the thiol-sensitive bond involves Cys11 of Pex5p, we decided to address this issue in a direct way. For this purpose, we explored the properties of a truncated version of Pex5p comprising its first 324 amino acid residues (ΔC1Pex5p) and containing a single cysteine residue, the one at position 11. Although it lacks the PTS1-binding domain, this C-terminally truncated molecule is still a substrate for the peroxisomal import and export machineries (24Gouveia A.M. Kim C.P. Oliveira M.E.

As shown in Fig. 2C, inclusion of GST-Ub in import reactions containing ATP also led to an arrest of ΔC1Pex5p at the importomer (right panel, compare GST-Control and GST-Ub lanes). Again, a species corresponding to (or resembling) stage 3 was observed. Notably, under these conditions, a thiol-sensitive protein band displaying an apparent molecular mass of ∼80 kDa (the expected value for a GST-Ub-conjugated ΔC1Pex5p species) was detected (left and middle panels, compare GST-Ub lanes). Taken together, these data suggest that Cys11 of Pex5p is the residue involved in the thiol ester bond.The experiments described above unveil the existence of a ubiquitin-conjugating system acting on mammalian Pex5p during its transient passage through the importomer. However, because GST-Ub interferes with the normal transit of Pex5p, these data do not clearly reveal the relationship between ubiquitinated Pex5p and the stage 2 and 3 Pex5p populations. In an attempt to clarify this issue, Pex5p was subjected to standard import reactions in the absence of exogenous nucleotides or in the presence of ATP or ATPγS. Each reaction was then divided into four aliquots that were treated or not with proteinase K and analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions. The results obtained for each of these four sets of samples are shown in Fig. 3A. A thiol-sensitive 100-kDa protein band could be easily detected in these assays (compare–PK/–DTT and–PK/+DTT panels), suggesting that 35S-labeled Pex5p forms a conjugate with endogenous rat liver ubiquitin. Indeed, the 100-kDa species was recognized by an anti-ubiquitin antibody (Fig. 3B). In addition, inclusion of GST-Ub in the ATPγS-containing import reactions led to the loss of this species with the concomitant appearance of a 130-kDa protein band (Fig. 3C). Notably, the ubiquitinated Pex5p species detected in these experiments corresponds to stage 3 Pex5p. This relationship was particularly evident when the protease-treated samples were analyzed under reducing or nonreducing conditions (Fig. 3A, +PK/+DTT and +PK/–DTT panels, respectively). Whereas stage 2 Pex5p behaved in a similar way under both conditions (ATP lanes), nonreduced stage 3 Pex5p (ATPγS lanes) was detected as a group of protein bands derived from partial proteolysis of the 100-kDa species. We note that this proteolysis does not affect Pex5p itself but rather the conjugated ubiquitin molecule because, as expected, all these bands disappeared upon reduction with DTT, yielding the intact peroxin (i.e. the stage 3 Pex5p population, as defined at the beginning of “Results”).

A, 35S-labeled Pex5p was subjected to import reactions containing no exogenous nucleotides (–lane) or ATP or ATPγS as indicated. At the end of the 37 °C incubation, each reaction was divided into four equal aliquots. The aliquots were treated (+PK) or not (–PK) with proteinase K and analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing (+DTT) or nonreducing (–DTT) conditions as indicated. Pex5p, the 100-kDa species (arrow a), and stage 2 and 3 Pex5p are indicated. B, an organelle pellet from an import reaction performed in the presence of ATPγS was solubilized with detergent and subjected to immunoprecipitation using an anti-ubiquitin antibody (upper panel) or a control antibody (lower panel) (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The total (T), unbound (Unb), and immunoprecipitated (in this case, treated (B+) or not (B–) with DTT) fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Note that although the yield in this immunoprecipitation experiment was quite low, the anti-ubiquitin antibody recognized the 100-kDa component, but not the unmodified Pex5p species. C, 35S-labeled Pex5p was subjected to import reactions containing 10 mm ATPγS and GST-Control or GST-Ub for 10 min at 37 °C. The reactions were diluted with SE buffer supplemented with 20 mm NEM, and the organelles were isolated by centrifugation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions.

Here we demonstrate that leptin stimulates the phosphorylation of STAT5 and ribosomal protein S6 in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus in mice. In cultured cells, we investigate the mechanisms by which leptin regulates each of these pathways. Our analysis reveals a dominant role for LepRb Tyr1077 (which we demonstrate to be phosphorylated during receptor activation) and a secondary role for LepRb Tyr1138 in the acute phosphorylation of STAT5a and STAT5b. Tyr1138 and STAT3 attenuate STAT5-dependent transcription over the long-term, however. In contrast, Tyr985 (the LepRb phosphorylation site required for ERK activation) mediates the phosphorylation of the ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and S6, as well as cap-dependent translation. Thus, these data demonstrate the phosphorylation of Tyr1077 on LepRb during receptor activation, substantiate the hypothalamic regulation of STAT5 and S6 by leptin, and define the alternate LepRb signaling pathways that mediate each of these signals and their effects in cultured cells. Dissecting the contributions of these individual pathways to leptin action will be important for our ultimate understanding of the processes that regulate energy balance in vivo.

The lack of leptin action due to mutations in leptin (e.g. ob/ob mice) or LepRb (e.g. db/db mice) or as a consequence of lowered fat stores results in increased appetite and an energy-sparing neuroendocrine starvation response that includes infertility and growth retardation (6Farooqi I.S.

Stammsen D. Preibisch G. Eckel J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3027-3032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, whereas the regulation of S6(P) by leptin has been shown in vivo (34Cota D.

Science. 2006; 312: 927-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanisms by which leptin mediates S6(P) and the cellular effects of this regulation are not known. Here we demonstrate the regulation of STAT5 by leptin in vivo and dissect the phosphorylation events by which leptin regulates STAT5 and ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation and action. Antibodies, Growth Factors, and Reagents—Rabbit αJak2 and αLepRb have been described previously (22Banks A.S. Davis S.M. Bates S.H. Myers Jr., M.G. J. Biol.

Antibodies specific for phosphorylated Tyr985, Tyr1077, and Tyr1138 of LepRb were raised in rabbits by injection of a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled synthetic 11-amino acid phosphorylated peptide centered on the phosphorylated residue in question. All site- and phospho-specific anti-sera were affinity purified on the antigen peptide coupled to a mixture of Affi-Gel 10 and 15 (Bio-Rad), followed by passage over Affi-Gel coupled to irrelevant phosphopeptides and non-phosphorylated antigen peptide to remove antibodies directed against other sites of phosphorylation and to the non-phosphorylated form of the site. Monoclonal 4G10 was used for αPY immunoblotting (Chemicon). Antibodies directed against ERK(PT202/PY204), STAT5, STAT5(PY694), STAT3(PY705), S6(PS235/236), and S6(PS240/244), RSK, and RSK(PS380) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Recombinant human erythropoeitin (Epo) was purchased from Amgen. Bovine serum albumin fraction V was purchased from Sigma. Protein A-Sepharose 6MB and horseradish peroxidase-protein A were from Amersham Biosciences and secondary antibodies for immunoblotting were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Generation of Mutant ELR cDNAs—pcDNA3ELR, pcDNA3ELRL985, pcDNA3ELRL985/S1138, pcDNA3ELRS1138, and pcDNA3ELRL985/F1077/S1138 (aka pcDNA3ELRTriple) have been described previously (22Banks A.S.

The presence of the desired mutations and the absence of adventitious mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Preparation of Cell Lysates for Immunoprecipitation—HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and maintained in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. ELR constructs in pcDNA3 were transiently transfected into subconfluent HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) as described (44Feener E.P. Rosario F. Dunn S.L. Stancheva Z. Myers Jr., M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4968-4978Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Prior to each experiment, subconfluent cells were made quiescent by overnight incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin before stimulation with Epo for the indicated time at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mm sodium orthovanadate (lysis buffer). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. Protein concentrations of the resulting lysates were determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) and bovine serum albumin standards, and equivalent amounts of protein were added to the appropriate antibodies for immunoprecipitation or denatured in Laemmli buffer for direct resolution by 10% SDS-PAGE. For immunoprecipitates, lysates were incubated with antibody at 4 °C overnight followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose for 60 min. Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation and washed three times in lysis buffer before denaturation in Laemmli buffer and separation by 8% SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was performed as previously described (44Feener E.P. Rosario F. Dunn S.L. Stancheva Z. Myers Jr., M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4968-4978Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). For stripping blots, the membrane was stripped with Reblot plus (Chemicon) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stripped membranes were blocked overnight in blocking buffer and reprobed as described above. Analysis of Reporter Activity—HEK293 cells were transfected in triplicate with the ELR constructs and/or the cDNAs for STAT3 (27Bjorbaek C. Lavery H.J. Bates S.H. Olson R.K. Davis S.M. Flier J.S.

Cells were made quiescent overnight before stimulation with vehicle or various concentrations of Epo for the indicated times. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with a bicistronic luciferase reporter plasmid, pRL-5′-IRES-FL (the generous gift of Dr. John Blenis), which directs cap-dependent translation of the Renilla luciferase (RL) gene and cap-independent HCV IRES-mediated translation of the firefly (FL) gene (40Roux P.P.

Cells were lysed and assayed for Firefly and Renilla luciferase using the Dual Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) on a Victor3 instrument (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Analysis of Hypothalamic Protein—Mice were C57Bl/6 animals from our in-house breeding program at the University of Michigan or purchased from Taconic Farms with intracerebroventricular cannulae in place. Mice had ad libitum access to food and water and all experimental procedures were approved by the University Committee on the Use and Care of Animals. Hypothalami were isolated between 10 and 12 a.m., arcuate nucleus was microdissected and snap frozen. Lysis, SDS-PAGE analysis, and immunoblotting procedures were as described (17Munzberg H. Flier J.S. Bjorbaek C. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 11797-11802Crossref Scopus (578) Google Scholar), using the antibodies indicated above. Immunofluorescence—8-10-Week-old mice were treated with recombinant mouse leptin (5 μg/g) (National Hormone & Peptide Program (NHPP), Torrance, CA) or vehicle immunoprecipitation for 60 min before being deeply anesthetized (90 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital) and perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde. Removal of the brain, post-fixation, cryoprotection, sectioning, and immunohistochemistry were as described. In brief, free-floating tissue sections were blocked in donkey serum and then incubated with αS6(PS240/244) (Cell Signaling) or with rabbit αSTAT5 (Cell Signaling) and chicken αGFP (Abcam), before further processing for immunofluorescent detection. Images were captured under fluorescence or confocal microscopy with a digital camera. All images for a single figure were from sections that were processed simultaneously and obtained under identical camera settings (17Munzberg H. Flier J.S. Bjorbaek C. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 11797-11802Crossref Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of STAT5 and S6 during LepRb Signaling in Cultured Cells and in Vivo—We initially examined the phosphorylation of STAT5 and S6 (STAT5(P) and S6(P), respectively) in cultured 293 cells expressing a chimera of the erythropoeitin (Epo) receptor extracellular domain with the intracellular domain from the long form of the mouse leptin receptor (LepRb) (ELR chimera). In this ELR chimera, the activation of LepRb-dependent signals is under the control of Epo stimulation (22Banks A.S. Davis S.M. Bates S.H. Myers Jr., M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14563-14572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). We and others have utilized ELR extensively to examine signal transduction by the intracellular domain of LepRb, because ELR faithfully recapitulates the intracellular signaling program initiated by native LepRb (22Banks A.S.

Additionally, the shorter Epo receptor extracellular domain mediates increased cell surface expression of ELR compared with native LepRb in cultured cells, facilitating the analysis of intracellular signaling systems. We thus transfected ELR into 293 cells, rendered them quiescent, and examined the phosphorylation of downstream signaling proteins following various times of ligand stimulation (Fig. 1A). As expected, this analysis revealed the rapid phosphorylation of endogenous STAT3 protein (STAT3(P)) on the tyrosine responsible for transcriptional activation following ELR stimulation. Epo treatment of these cells also mediated STAT5(P) and S6(P), demonstrating the ability of the intracellular domain of LepRb to mediate the activation of these signaling pathways in cultured cells. The tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT proteins, such as the phosphorylation of STAT5 on Tyr694 (detected here), promotes their nuclear translocation and ability to mediate transcriptional regulation (24Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1994; 264: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1721) Google Scholar, 25Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). S6 kinase 1/2 and the ERK/RSK pathways mediate S6 phosphorylation on several sites, including Ser235/236 and Ser240/244 to modulate protein translation (40Roux P.P. Shahbazian D. Vu H. Holz M.K.

Others have shown the LepRb-dependent induction of STAT5(P) in cultured cells (30Hekerman P. Zeidler J. Bamberg-Lemper S. Knobelspies H. Lavens D. Tavernier J. Joost H.G. Becker W. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 31Ghilardi N. Ziegler S. Wiestner A. Stoffel R. Skoda R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6231-6235Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar), but it has not been clear whether leptin is able to activate this signaling pathway in the hypothalamus of intact animals (43Rizk N.M. Stammsen D. Preibisch G. Eckel J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3027-3032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore examined the ability of leptin to regulate STAT5(P) and S6(P) in mice by immunoblotting lysates from the microdissected arcuate nucleus of mice following intracerebroventricular injection of leptin (Fig. 1B). Whereas anti-STAT5(P) antibodies have not proved sufficiently robust to enable the immunohistochemical detection of STAT5(P) in brain, leptin treatment of wild-type mice robustly increased the immunofluorescent detection of S6(P) in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC) (Fig. 1C), as previously reported for rats (34Cota D. Proulx K. Smith K.A. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Woods S.C. Seeley R.J. Science. 2006; 312: 927-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). Thus, leptin promotes the phosphorylation of STAT5 and S6 in the ARC of mice. Requirement for LepRb Tyr1077 for the Phosphorylation of STAT5 and Phosphorylation of LepRb Tyr1077 during Receptor Activation—To examine the mechanism by which LepRb regulates STAT5, we employed a panel of ELR mutants of various intracellular tyrosine residues to examine the role for potential events to mediate STAT5(P) (Fig. 2A).

Here we show that expression of the CXC motif chemokine ligand-14 (CXCL14), which targets tissue macrophages, is elevated in WAT of obese mice fed a high fat diet (HFD) compared with lean mice fed a regular diet. We found that HFD-fed CXCL14-deficient mice have impaired WAT macrophage mobilization and improved insulin responsiveness. Insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt kinase in skeletal muscle was severely attenuated in HFD-fed CXCL14+/- mice but not in HFD-fed CXCL14-/- mice. The insulin-sensitive phenotype of CXCL14-/- mice after HFD feeding was prominent in female mice but not in male mice. HFD-fed CXCL14-/- mice were protected from hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypoadiponectinemia and did not exhibit increased levels of circulating retinol-binding protein-4 and increased expression of interleukin-6 in WAT. Transgenic overexpression of CXCL14 in skeletal muscle restored obesity-induced insulin resistance in CXCL14-/- mice. CXCL14 attenuated insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in cultured myocytes and to a lesser extent in cultured adipocytes. These results demonstrate that CXCL14 is a critical chemoattractant of WAT macrophages and a novel regulator of glucose metabolism that functions mainly in skeletal muscle.

These results indicate that the interaction of CCL2 and CCR2 contributes to WAT macrophage infiltration and impaired glucose metabolism in obese mice. However, in a different genetic background, blood glucose levels and the number of WAT macrophages in CCR2-deficient obese mice were similar to control mice (17Chen A. Mumick S. Zhang C. Lamb J.

This suggests that there is an additional chemoattractant for WAT macrophages in obese animals. CXCL14 (originally designated as BRAK, BMAC, or Mip-2γ) is expressed in skeletal muscle, WAT, and brown adipose tissue (BAT), which suggests that it may play a role in myogenesis, adipogenesis, and metabolic regulation. CXCL14 is a chemoattractant for activated tissue macrophages and dendritic progenitor cells (18Hromas R. Broxmeyer H.E. Kim C. Nakshatri H. Christopherson II, K. Azam M. Hou Y.H. Biochem. Biophys.

Human monocytes acquire CXCL14 responsiveness and lose their chemotactic response to CCL2 after prostaglandin E2 treatment, suggesting that the role of CXCL14 may be distinct from other inflammatory monokines (25Kurth I.

However, the CXCL14 receptor has not yet been identified, and the physiological roles of CXCL14 have not been fully explored in animal models. In this study, we generated CXCL14-null mice and demonstrated that CXCL14 is involved in the obesity-associated infiltration of macrophages into WAT, alteration of serum adipokine levels, hepatic steatosis, and attenuation of insulin signaling in skeletal muscle, thereby contributing to whole body insulin resistance in HFD-induced obese mice. Generation of CXCL14 Knock-out and Transgenic Mouse Lines—The CXCL14 targeting vector consisted of the genomic DNA sequence of mouse CXCL14 (GenBank™ accession numbers AC165347 and AC124395) containing a deletion of the translation initiation site and exon 2 and a Neo cassette insertion (supplemental Fig. S1A). TT2 embryonic stem cells derived from CBA × C57BL/6 F1 mice were electroporated with linearized targeting vector and cultured in the presence of G418 (350 μg/ml) for 10-12 days. Homologous recombination was assessed by PCR using P1 (5′-CATGCAGATCAACTGATGTCAGACACAGAC-3′) and P2 (5′-CGAATGGGCTGACCGCTTCC-3′) primers (product size 2,193 bp). Embryonic stem cell clones were microinjected into 8-cell-stage eggs of ICR mice to generate chimeras, which were bred to C57BL/6 mice to obtain F1 heterozygous mutant mice (C57BL/6-CBA mixed background). F1 and F2 mice were intercrossed to obtain CXCL14+/+, CXCL14+/-, and CXCL14-/- littermates. For genotyping, PCR was carried out on tail fragment-derived DNA, using wild-type primers (5′-AGACCTGTACGGCGGCGACTC-3′ and 5′-GTCCGATCTAACCCTAGGTTG-3′, 210-bp product) and mutant primers (5′-CTGCATCTGCGTGTTCGAAT-3′ and 5′-GTCCGATCTAACCCTAGGTTG-3′, 251-bp product). As CXCL14+/+ and CXCL14+/- mice were phenotypically indistinguishable, most experiments were performed using CXCL14+/- and CXCL14-/- littermates of F2 and F3 generations. To generate the CXCL14 transgenic mouse line, the open reading frame of the mouse CXCL14 cDNA was amplified by PCR and inserted downstream of the 6.5-kb version of the mouse MCK promoter/enhancer region (26Cox G.A. Cole N.M. Matsumura K. Phelps S.F. Hauschka S.D. Campbell K.P. Faulkner J.A. Chamberlain J.S. Nature. 1993; 364: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The SV40-derived polyadenylation signal from pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) was then added to the 3′ end. The DNA fragment was gel-purified, and microinjected into the pronucleus of fertilized eggs of C57BL/6 mice. The following set of PCR primers was used to detect the mck-CXCL14 transgene in tail fragment-derived DNA: 5′-CAGGATGTGGCCACATCAGGCAACTTGGGC-3′ and 5′-CCAGGCATTGTACCACTTGA-3′ (430-bp product). All mice were maintained under a 12-h light, 12-h dark cycle in a pathogen-free animal facility. All experimental procedures with mice were pre-approved by the ethical committee of the institute. Southern Blot Analysis—High molecular weight DNA (10 μg) extracted from the spleen was digested with EcoRI. Southern blot hybridization was carried out according to standard procedures. The 390-bp [32P]dCTP-labeled probe was generated by PCR using the following primers: 5′-GCTTCCAGATGTGAGATCCAG-3′ and 5′-AGTAGACTGAGTTCCTCTA-3′. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA (20 μg) was isolated from the indicated tissues and organs using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Northern blot analysis was carried out using a PCR-amplified cDNA fragment as a probe. Sequences of the gene-specific primer sets used for PCR are listed in supplemental Table S1. Cell Fractionation—Fragmented periovarian fat pads were digested in a solution of collagenase/dispase (1 mg/ml PBS; Roche Applied Science) for 45 min at 37 °C with gentle agitation. After centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 5 min, floating cells (adipocytes) were recovered, and cells in the pellet were incubated in a solution of biotinylated anti-Mac1 antibody (M1/70, 1:50 dilution; BD Biosciences) in PBS containing 5% fetal calf serum (FCS) on ice for 30 min, followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated streptavidin (BD Biosciences) (10 μg/ml). Fluorescence intensity and number of viable cells were measured by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), using a FACSAria system (BD Biosciences). Mac1-positive (Mac1+) cells and Mac1-negative (Mac1-) cells were collected and designated as macrophages and stromal and vascular cells (SVCs), respectively. Immunohistochemistry—For histological analysis, fat pads were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and paraffin-embedded sections were prepared (5-μm sections). Sections were incubated with biotinylated F4/80 antibody (1:20 dilution; BM8, Caltag) at room temperature for 30 min, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (1:50 dilution; Molecular Probes) and diaminobenzidine (Sigma), as described previously (27Nakayama Y.

For fatty liver analysis, fixed cryostat sections (7 μm thick) were with stained with Oil Red O (Sigma; 1.5 mg/ml in 60% isopropyl alcohol) for 10 min at room temperature. Chemotaxis Assay—Mac1+ mononuclear cells in the peripheral blood of 5-month-old C57BL/6 female mice were sorted by FACSAria and applied to the D-6 chamber (width, 260 μm; depth, 5 μm) of EZ-TAXIScan™ MIC-1000 (Effector Cell Institute, Tokyo, Japan) (28Kanegasaki S.

Methods. 2003; 282: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) containing 0.1% BSA in 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0. Human CXCL14 (PeproTech, 100 nm) was added to a lower well of the chamber, and cell migration was recorded for 3 h at 37 °C. Diet Study and Metabolic Measurements—Mice were fed a regular diet (RD) (12% fat, CE-2; CLEA, Tokyo) or an HFD (32% fat, HFD-32; CLEA). Initial studies were carried out using female mice fed an RD alone (11 months) or an HFD (6 months with RD and 3 months with HFD). We also used younger mice fed an HFD (2 months with RD and 3 months with HFD) and obtained similar results. For the intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test (IITT) and intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IGTT), mice were fasted for 16 h and then injected intraperitoneally with human insulin (0.75 milliunits/g; Sigma) or glucose (0.75 mg/g; Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd., Osaka, Japan), respectively. To measure insulin concentrations for the IGTT, glucose (2 mg/g) was administered. Blood glucose was measured using a Glutest Ace R glucometer (Sanwa Chemical, Nagoya, Japan). Levels of serum cholesterol, serum, and hepatic triglyceride and serum FFAs were analyzed using the corresponding enzyme-based measurement kits (Wako). To determine hepatic triglyceride concentrations, liver fragments (100 mg) were homogenized in 1 ml of 0.1 m KCl, and lipids were extracted from the homogenate with chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v) (29Akiyama T.E.

An aliquot of the organic phase was collected, dried, and resuspended in isopropyl alcohol containing 1% Triton X-100. Serum concentrations of insulin, leptin, and adiponectin were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits from Shibayagi (Shibukawa, Gumma, Japan), Morinaga Chemical (Yokohama, Japan), and Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan), respectively. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was carried out using the unpaired Student's t test and Statview J5.0 software (Abacus Concepts). A p value of <0.05 was considered to be significant. CT Scan Analysis—The amount of visceral fat and subcutaneous fat of HFD-fed mice was examined by radiography using a CT apparatus (LaTheta LCT-100M, Aloka, Tokyo), according to the manufacturer's protocol. CT scanning was done at 2-mm intervals from the diaphragm to the bottom of the abdominal cavity. Western Blot Analysis—For the in vivo analysis, mice were fasted for 16 h, injected with human insulin (10 milliunits/g) intraperitoneally, and then sacrificed 4 min after injection. Liver and skeletal muscle (tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius muscles) were dissected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. For in vitro analysis, confluent C2C12 myoblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% horse serum for 4 days to induce myotube differentiation. After 16 h of serum starvation, cells were incubated with or without CXCL14 (100 nm) for 1 h followed by stimulation with insulin (10 nm) at 37 °C for 10 min in the presence or absence of CXCL14. Total protein (20 μg) was subjected to Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody to phosphorylated Akt (Akt-pSer473) or nonphosphorylated Akt (Cell Signaling) according to the manufacturer's instructions. CXCL14 in the brain and RBP4 in serum were detected using sheep anti-mouse CXCL14 antibody (R & D Systems) and rabbit anti-human RBP4 antibody (DAKO), respectively. Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR—First-strand cDNAs were prepared from total RNA (5 μg) using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase and a random primer (Invitrogen). One percent of the cDNA mixture was subjected to 30-40 cycles of PCR using the primer sets listed in supplemental Table S1, an annealing temperature of 57 °C, and ExTaq DNA polymerase (Takara, Otsu, Japan). Measurement of 2-Deoxyglucose (2-DG) Uptake—Differentiated C2C12 myocytes were generated as described for Western blot analysis. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FCS at 37 °C. Two days after reaching confluence, cells were treated with 0.25 μm dexamethasone and 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine for 48 h, followed by 10 μm insulin alone for an additional 48 h. The cells were then maintained for 6 days in DMEM containing 10% FCS. For the 2-DG uptake assay, C2C12-derived myocytes or 3T3-L1-derived adipocytes were serum-starved for 16 h, and then incubated with 0, 0.1, 1, or 10 nm CXCL14 at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were stimulated with insulin (10 nm) for 30 min and incubated with 100 nm [1-3H]2-DG (0.8 μCi/ml, Amersham Biosciences) at 37 °C for 10 min in the presence or absence of CXCL14. Specific uptake of 2-DG was measured as described previously (30Wang L. Huang J. Saha P. Kulkarni R.N. Hu M. Kim Y. Park K. Chan L. Rajan A.S. Lee I. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 2671-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Obesity-associated Up-regulation of CXCL14 mRNA—In adult mice, CXCL14 was expressed in the brain, lung, kidney, ovary, skeletal muscle, uterus, and WAT (Fig. 1A). Expression of CXCL14 was strikingly elevated in WAT, BAT, and skeletal muscle (tibialis anterior muscle) in obese mice fed an HFD (Fig. 1B), and in ob/ob mice (Fig. 1C) compared with mice fed an RD. This was the first demonstration that CXCL14 is an obesity-induced gene. In WAT, the expression level of CXCL14 mRNA in SVCs and macrophages was equivalent in RD-fed and HFD-fed mice, whereas in adipocytes, CXCL14 transcripts were detectable only in HFD-fed mice (Fig. 1D). The WAT of HFD-fed mice was infiltrated by a larger number of SVCs and macrophages than the WAT of RD-fed mice (see Fig. 3A); thus, all three types of cells in WAT may contribute to the increased level of expression of CXCL14 in WAT of obese mice. Currently available antibodies were not sensitive enough to quantitate CXCL14 protein levels in WAT or other tissues.FIGURE 3Reduced infiltration of macrophages into WAT of HFD-fed CXCL14-/- mice. A, cells were enzymatically dissociated from periovarian fat pads of RD-fed or HFD-fed CXCL14+/- or CXCL14-/- female mice, and the total numbers of Mac1+ and Mac1- cells in WAT were calculated based on FACS analysis. RD, n = 6 for each group; HFD, n = 4 for CXCL14+/-; n = 5 for CXCL14-/-. B, paraffin sections of periovarian fat pads from representative RD-fed or HFD-fed CXCL14+/- and CXCL14-/- female mice were immunostained with anti-F4/80 antibody. Brown signals surrounding adipocytes represent F4/80+ macrophages. Magnification, ×200. C, chemotactic response of peripheral blood Mac1+ cells to CXCL14 was examined using an EZ-TAXIScan™ apparatus.

(n = 4). *, p < 0.01; n.s., not significant compared with the cells in the absence of CXCL14.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) General Properties of CXCL14-deficient Mice—To understand the physiological role of CXCL14, we generated heterozygous (CXCL14+/-) and homozygous (CXCL14-/-) CXCL14 mutant mice, according to standard gene targeting strategies (supplemental Fig. S1A). Southern, Northern, and Western blot analyses confirmed that region-specific recombination occurred and that CXCL14 transcripts and protein were absent in null mutant mice (supplemental Fig. S1, B-D). Although the birth ratio of CXCL14-/- mice was lower than the expected Mendelian frequency, CXCL14-/- adult mice were fertile and asymptomatic for severe diseases. However, CXCL14-/- and CXCL14+/- mice exhibited several differences in body weight and metabolic parameters. Female CXCL14-/- mice showed a more pronounced phenotype than male CXCL14-/- mice, particularly under HFD feeding conditions. Thus, the following experiments were conducted using female homozygous CXCL14-/- and heterozygous CXCL14+/- littermates. Under RD feeding conditions, the mean body weight of CXCL14-/- mice (26.3 ± 1.3 g) was 24.6% less than that of CXCL14+/- mice (34.9 ± 2.3 g) (Fig. 2A). Periovarian WAT mass in RD-fed CXCL14-/- mice was significantly reduced, to 25.4% of CXCL14+/- mice (Fig. 2, B and C). The weights of the liver and kidney were comparable between the two strains of RD-fed mice (Fig. 2C). Under RD feeding conditions, CXCL14-/- mice ate 19.3% less than CXCL14+/- mice (Fig. 2F), which indicated that the lean phenotype and WAT hypoplasia of CXCL14-/- mice is because of decreased appetite. The total macrophage number in WAT was not significantly different between RD-fed CXCL14-/- and CXCL14+/- mice (see Fig. 3A); thus, the decreased appetite of CXCL14-/- mice appeared to be independent of the macrophage chemoattractant activity of CXCL14 in adipose tissues. Under HFD feeding conditions, whereas both CXCL14-/- and CXCL14+/- mice gained a significant amount of weight (Fig. 2, A and B), CXCL14-/- mice were 20.8% lighter than CXCL14+/- mice (Fig. 2A). In contrast to RD-feeding conditions, the periovarian WAT mass of CXCL14-/- mice increased under HFD-feeding conditions and was not significantly different from that of CXCL14+/- mice (3.4 ± 0.4 and 4.7 ± 0.6 g, respectively; p = 0.107) (Fig. 2, B and D). To accurately determine the adiposity of HFD-fed CXCL14-/- mice, we analyzed a second group of HFD-fed female mice by CT scan. The estimated weights of total visceral fat and subcutaneous fat in the body were not statistically different (p = 0.0671 and 0.958, respectively) (Fig. 2E). Next, we compared fat cell size in HFD-fed CXCL14-/- mice and HFD-fed CXCL14+/- mice. As shown in supplemental Fig. S2, A-D, there was an HFD feeding-dependent hypertrophy of adipocytes in WAT of CXCL14-/- mice. These data collectively indicated that CXCL14-/- mice are not defective in adipogenesis and WAT development under HFD-feeding conditions. Although the WAT was enlarged in HFD-fed CXCL14-/- mice compared with HFD-fed CXCL14+/- mice, the dimensions (supplemental Fig. S3A) and mass (1.6 ± 0.1 and 3.8 ± 0.3 g, respectively) (Fig. 2D) of the livers were smaller in HFD-fed CXCL14-/- mice. The livers of HFD-fed CXCL14-/- mouse had less Oil Red O-positive lipid deposits compared with HFD-fed CXCL14+/+ or CXCL14+/- mice (supplemental Fig. S3B). The amount of triglyceride in the livers of HFD-fed CXCL14-/- mice was 20.0% less than HFD-fed CXCL14+/- mice (supplemental Fig. S3C). These results indicated that CXCL14-deficient mice are partially protected from HFD-induced hepatic steatosis. In contrast to adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, HFD-induced up-regulation of CXCL14 mRNA was not observed in the livers of CXCL14+/- mice (supplemental Fig. S3D). Thus, the smaller size and decreased fat content in the livers of HFD-fed CXCL14-/- mice were likely an indirect effect of the CXCL14 deficiency. The kidney mass of HFD-fed CXCL14-/- mice was also smaller than HFD-fed CXCL14+/- mice (0.36 ± 0.02 and 0.45 ± 0.02 g, respectively) (Fig. 2D). The level of food intake of HFD-fed CXCL14-/- mice was not significantly different from that of HFD-fed CXCL14+/- mice (p = 0.097) (Fig. 2F). As mentioned above, although HFD-fed CXCL14-/- mice were able to convert excess energy into WAT, their body weight and organ masses were smaller than HFD-fed CXCL14+/- mice. This unusual phenotype implied that CXCL14-/- mice have central nervous system defects as well, because CXCL14 mRNA was also observed in the brain (Fig. 1A). The mean nasal-anal length of HFD-fed CXCL14-/- mice (9.22 ± 0.086 cm) was signi"

Dengue virus is a positive-sense RNA virus that harbors a genome of ∼10.7 kb. Replication of dengue virus is mediated coordinately by cis-acting genomic sequences, viral proteins, and host cell factors. We have isolated and identified several host cell factors from baby hamster kidney cell extracts that bind with high specificity and high affinity to sequences within the untranslated regions of the dengue virus genome. Among the factors identified, Y box-binding protein-1 (YB-1) and the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), hnRNP A1, hnRNP A2/B1, and hnRNP Q, bind to the dengue virus 3′-untranslated region. Further analysis indicated that YB-1 binds to the dengue virus 3′ stem loop, a conserved structural feature located at the 3′ terminus of the 3′-untranslated region of many flaviviruses. Analysis of the impact of YB-1 on replication of dengue virus in YB-1+/+ and YB-1–/– mouse embryo fibroblasts indicated that host YB-1 mediates an antiviral effect. Further studies demonstrated that this antiviral impact is due, at least in part, to a repressive role of YB-1 on dengue virus translation via a mechanism that requires viral genomic sequences.

DENV is related to other medically important flaviviruses, including West Nile, yellow fever, and Japanese encephalitis viruses, and is transmitted to humans by the mosquitoes Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. DENV contains a positive-sense RNA genome of 10.7 kb that is translated in the cytoplasm of infected cells as a single polyprotein and subsequently cleaved to yield three structural proteins (capsid, envelope, and pre-membrane) and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) (1Hahn C.S. Hahn Y.S. Rice C.M. Lee E. Dalgarno L. Strauss E.G. Strauss J.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Following a requisite first round of viral translation in the cytoplasm, the subsequent steps of genome replication, second round translation, and assembly are coordinated to generate infectious DENV virions. Four serotypes of DENV (DENV1–4) co-circulate in most endemic countries, increasing the incidence of the more severe forms of the disease, dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. To date, only palliative treatments and supportive therapies are available for tens of millions of patients who acquire the disease annually. The identification of host cell factors that play a role in DENV infection remains an essential and largely unexplored area in the characterization of the mechanism of viral replication and the development of effective antiviral therapies. The DENV genome contains a 7mG cap and is flanked by 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs) of ∼96 and 451 nucleotides, respectively. The 3′-UTR of DENV differs from nearly all host cell mRNA 3′-UTRs in that it lacks a poly(A) tail. The DENV 5′- and 3′-UTRs contain sequences and secondary structures that are highly conserved among flaviviruses and are important for the regulation of translation and replication (1Hahn C.S.

Viral end-to-end interactions have been demonstrated directly (3Alvarez D.E. Lodeiro M.F. Luduena S.J. Pietrasanta L.I. Gamarnik A.V. J.

Gamarnik A.V. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2238-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). 5′-to-3′-UTR interactions are presumed to be involved in the regulation of viral translation as well (13Edgil D. Harris E. Virus Res. 2006; 119: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The ∼100 nucleotides at the 3′ terminus of the 3′-UTR of all flaviviruses form a thermodynamically stable and conserved structural element, the 3′ stem loop (3′SL), that has been demonstrated to play an important role in viral replication. Deletion of the 3′SL significantly reduces translation of viral reporter RNAs (6Holden K.L. Harris E. Virology. 2004; 329: 119-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), whereas mutagenesis of the 3′SL has been demonstrated to impair DENV translation and replication (7Holden K.L. Stein D.A.

Virol. 2005; 79: 2309-2324Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The loop region of the 3′SL, referred to as the pentanucleotide loop, contains sequences that are necessary for replication of flaviviruses, including West Nile and dengue viruses (10Tilgner M. Deas T.S. Shi P.Y. Virology. 2005; 331: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Phosphorodiamidate oligomers targeted to this region interfered with both translation and replication of DENV reporter replicons (7Holden K.L. Stein D.A. Pierson T.C. Ahmed A.A. Clyde K. Iversen P.L.

Despite the delineation of many important cis-elements in the DENV genome, our understanding of the molecular basis of their action remains unclear. In particular, very little is currently understood about the role of host factors in maintenance and modulation of DENV genomic structure and function. Although host-derived proteins, including La autoantigen (La) (14De Nova-Ocampo M. Villegas-Sepulveda N. del Angel R.M.

Virol. 1997; 71: 6433-6444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (14De Nova-Ocampo M. Villegas-Sepulveda N. del Angel R.M. Virology. 2002; 295: 337-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), have been shown to interact with the 3′-UTRs of DENV and West Nile virus genomes, their precise roles in viral replication are not clear. For example, investigators have demonstrated that La can bind to both the 5′- and 3′-UTRs of DENV (15Garcia-Montalvo B.M. Medina F. del Angel R.M. Virus Res. 2004; 102: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although subsequent experiments indicated that La undergoes changes in cellular localization during DENV infection and that La can repress viral RNA synthesis in vitro (16Yocupicio-Monroy M. Padmanabhan R. Medina F. del Angel R.M. Virology. 2007; 357: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), using a dominant negative La protein, we were unable to demonstrate any impact of La on DENV propagation in cultured cells. 3J. Walker, S. Paranjape, and E. Harris, unpublished results.3J. Walker, S. Paranjape, and E. Harris, unpublished results. Clearly, the identification and characterization of host cell factors that are involved in the orchestration of different stages of the DENV life cycle will extend our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of DENV replication. One of the challenges to identification of host cell proteins that interact with a viral genome is to ensure that isolated proteins bind with sufficient specificity and affinity to suggest biological significance. To increase the likelihood of biochemical isolation of physiologically relevant host cell binding factors, we have utilized an in vitro biochemical system that mimics properties of DENV infection observed in vivo. Specifically, we employed RNA affinity chromatography to isolate DENV UTR-interacting host cell factors from a baby hamster kidney cell extract that recapitulates DENV translation dynamics observed in vivo. In further experiments, we investigated the role of one of the host cell factors identified, Y box-binding protein 1 (YB-1), in DENV replication. YB-1 is a cold shock domain protein that has been shown previously to be involved in diverse cellular processes, including the regulation of cap-dependent translation, transcription, and signal transduction (reviewed in Ref. 19Kohno K. Izumi H. Uchiumi T. Ashizuka M. Kuwano M. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). YB-1 has previously been implicated in oncogenesis and has been shown to associate with several DNA viruses. Our results indicate that YB-1 elicits an antiviral effect on DENV replication that is mediated, in part, through repression of DENV viral translation. Cell Lines, Extracts, Virus Infection, and Flow Cytometry—Baby hamster kidney (BHK)-21 cells (clone 15) were maintained in minimum essential media α (Invitrogen) containing 5% fetal calf serum (FCS, HyClone, Logan, UT), 2 mm Glutamax (Invitrogen), and 100 units of penicillin/100 μg of streptomycin (P/S) (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Immortalized mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) generated from YB-1+/+ and YB-1–/– mice (20Lu Z.H. Books J.T. Ley T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4625-4637Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) were obtained from Zhi Hong Lu and Timothy Ley (Washington University, St Louis). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media (Invitrogen) containing 10% FCS, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), 2 mm Glutamax (Invitrogen), and P/S. C6/36 A. albopictus mosquito cells were maintained in Leibovitz's L-15 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS, P/S, and 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. For extract preparation, BHK cells were adapted for growth in suspension by maintenance in a rich growth medium. Specifically, cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% FCS, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, and P/S. Cells were seeded in a spinner bottle and supplemented with growth medium every 2–3 days to maintain a density of 106 cells/ml. Twelve to 24 h prior to harvesting, growth medium was added to ensure that harvested cells were in growth phase. Translation extracts were prepared as described previously (21Edgil D. Diamond M.S. Holden K.L. Paranjape S.M. Harris E. Virology. 2003; 317: 275-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, BHK cells were harvested, washed with PBS, resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer (21Edgil D. Diamond M.S. Holden K.L. Paranjape S.M. Harris E. Virology. 2003; 317: 275-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and lysed via passage through a 21-gauge needle. Lysates were subjected to centrifugation (10,000 × g) for 5 min. Supernatant was harvested and supplemented with glycerol to a final concentration of 10% prior to flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen. Translation extracts were thawed and supplemented with a freshly prepared mixture of ATP, GTP, creatine phosphokinase, phosphocreatine, and protease inhibitors prior to use. Infection of MEFs by DENV2 strain 16681 was performed as described previously (22Diamond M.S. Edgil D. Roberts T.G. Lu B. Harris E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7814-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with virus at an indicated m.o.i. for 2 h in a volume of medium sufficient to cover the cells. At 2 h post-infection, cells were washed four times and then incubated in growth medium. At indicated times post-infection, cell supernatants were collected and supplemented with FCS to 20%. Detached cells and cellular debris were removed by centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 3 min. Viral supernatants were stored at –80 °C until plaque assays were conducted. Plaque assays were performed on BHK cells as described previously (22Diamond M.S. Edgil D. Roberts T.G. Lu B. Harris E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7814-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Flow cytometric analysis was performed to determine intracellular levels of DENV2 NS3 protein in infected MEF cells. Flow cytometry was conducted as described previously (22Diamond M.S. Edgil D. Roberts T.G. Lu B. Harris E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7814-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 23Helt A.M. Harris E. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 13218-13230Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). DENV NS3 protein was detected using a mouse monoclonal antibody to DENV NS3. 4P. R. Beatty and E. Harris, unpublished results. Following overnight incubation with the primary antibody at 4 °C, samples were washed with PBS and stained with a secondary Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Invitrogen) for 1–2 h at 25 °C. NS3 expression was measured using an EPICs XL flow cytometer (Beckman-Coulter, Fullerton, CA). RNA Constructs, in Vitro Transcription, and Transfection—A region consisting of five nucleotides of NS5 and the entire 3′-UTR of DENV2 (451 nucleotides) was amplified from infectious clone pD2/IC (a gift of Richard Kinney, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Fort Collins, CO) using a forward primer containing an EcoRI site and a T7 promoter (5′-CCGGAATTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGTAGAAAGCAAAAC-3′) and a reverse primer containing an XbaI restriction site (5′-GACTTCTAGCCTTGTTTCATGTTAG-3′). PCR products were cloned into pBSKS II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to create a vector from which sense and antisense 3′-UTR could be transcribed in separate reactions following digestion with different restriction enzymes and gel purification. DENV2 3′SL constructs were generated from the DENV2 3′-UTR constructs using a forward primer containing an EcoRI site, a T7 consensus site, and homology to the 5′ end of the 3′SL (5′-CGGAATTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAAAGACCAGAGATCCTGCTGTCTCC-3′) and a reverse primer with homology to the 3′ end of the 3′SL (5′-GGTCGACTCTAGAGAACCTGTTGATTCAAAC-3′). PCR fragments were subcloned into pTOPO (Invitrogen), excised, and cloned into pBSKS II (Stratagene). DENV2 3′-UTR RNA and firefly luciferase reporter RNAs, 5DLuc3D and 5DLuc3ΔSL (6Holden K.L. Harris E. Virology. 2004; 329: 119-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and DENV2 Renilla luciferase replicons, (p)DRrep and (p)DRrep-RdRPmut, 5K. Clyde, J. Barrera, and E. Harris, submitted for publication. were transcribed using a Ribomax T7 RNA polymerase kit (Promega, Madison, WI). A 7-methyl-GpppA nucleotide was incorporated at the initial adenosine residue during transcription of luciferase reporter constructs (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). Unincorporated nucleotides were removed using Nuc-Away columns (Ambion, Austin, TX). RNA was concentrated, when necessary, by ethanol/ammonium acetate precipitation. DENV2 luciferase reporter constructs were transfected into YB-1–/– and YB-1+/+ MEF and BHK cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as described previously (7Holden K.L. Stein D.A. Pierson T.C. Ahmed A.A. Clyde K. Iversen P.L. Harris E. Virology. 2006; 344: 439-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). MEF and BHK cells transfected with Renilla luciferase replicons were harvested at various times post-transfection as indicated. MEF cells transfected with 5DLuc3D and 5DLuc3ΔSL firefly luciferase reporter constructs were harvested at 4–7 h post-transfection. Translation was monitored by luciferase production as described previously (6Holden K.L. Harris E. Virology. 2004; 329: 119-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 7Holden K.L. Stein D.A. Pierson T.C. Ahmed A.A. Clyde K. Iversen P.L. Harris E. Virology. 2006; 344: 439-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with PBS and lysed with Cell Culture Lysis Reagent (Promega) for assessment of firefly luciferase levels or with Renilla Luciferase Assay Lysis Buffer (Promega) for measurement of Renilla luciferase. Luciferase production was monitored using Luciferase Assay Reagent Substrate or Renilla Luciferase Assay Substrate (Promega) and a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Biosystems, Sunnyvale, CA). Assessment of transfection efficiency was determined by quantitative RT-PCR analysis as described elsewhere (7Holden K.L. Stein D.A. Pierson T.C. Ahmed A.A. Clyde K. Iversen P.L. Harris E. Virology. 2006; 344: 439-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).5 Specifically, RNA was harvested from cells at 2 h post-transfection using the RNeasy system (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) or mini RNA Isolation II kits (Zymoresearch, Orange County, CA) and then quantitated using the Lux system (Invitrogen) for RNA reporter constructs or the Taqman system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) for DENV replicon constructs. Relative transfection efficiencies of YB-1–/– and YB-1+/+ cells were determined and used to normalize luciferase activity. Affinity Chromatography—To prepare affinity resin, 5 μm of DENV reporter RNA was oxidized by incubation in 0.1 m sodium periodate, 0.1 m NaOAc, pH 5.0, for 1 h at 25°C. Following oxidation, RNA was precipitated by addition of 1 ml of ice-cold ethanol and isolated by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min. Precipitated RNA was washed with 70% ethanol, dried briefly in a speedvac, and resuspended in 0.1 m NaOAc, pH 5.0. Coupling of RNA to the resin was accomplished by incubating oxidized RNA with 100 μl of hydrazide-agarose resin (Sigma) (equilibrated in 0.1 m NaOAc, pH 5.0) on an end-over-end rotator at 4 °C for 12–18 h. Uncoupled RNA was removed by washing three times each with 2.0 m NaCl, 0.1 m NaOAc, and translation buffer (21Edgil D. Diamond M.S. Holden K.L. Paranjape S.M. Harris E. Virology. 2003; 317: 275-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Equilibrated resin was incubated with BHK translation extract at 30 °C for 30–60 min. Reactions were conducted in the presence of translation inhibitors and/or RNA competitors as indicated. Translation competence of the extract was monitored by luciferase production using Luciferase Assay Reagent (Promega) as above. Following binding, protein-RNA complexes were washed extensively in buffer containing 100 mm KCl and then eluted with a step gradient of KCl (0.1–1 m). Eluted protein fractions were concentrated with 20% trichloroacetic acid containing deoxycholate salt and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were stained with Coomassie Colloidal Blue (Invitrogen). Protein bands of interest were excised and submitted for MS/MS mass spectrometry as described below. Mass Spectrometry—Gel bands of interest were excised and digested with trypsin (Promega) (25Bienvenut W.V. Deon C. Pasquarello C. Campbell J.M. Sanchez J.C. Vestal M.L. Hochstrasser D.F. Proteomics. 2002; 2: 868-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The resulting digests were purified with C18 μZipTips (Millipore) and subjected to mass spectrometric analysis on an Applied Biosystems 4700 Proteomics Analyzer, which is a MALDI-time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometer (26Jiminez, A., Huang, L., Qiu, Y., and Burlingame, A. L. (1998) in Current Protocols in Protein Science (Coligan, J., Dunn, B. M., Ploegh, H. L., Speicher, D. W., and Wingfield, P. T., eds) pp. 16.14.11–16.14.15, Wiley Interscience, New YorkGoogle Scholar). The purified sample was mixed 1:1 with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix (10 g/liter), and 1.2 μl of the mixture was spotted onto the MALDI target plate. A reflector mode mass spectrum of the digest was first obtained, after which several individual peptide peaks were manually selected for MS/MS analysis. The peptide sequence for each was manually deduced from its MS/MS spectrum. Viral RNA Immunoprecipitation—BHK cells were infected with DENV2 strain 16681 at an m.o.i. of 1. Specifically, BHK cells at 80% confluency were incubated with DENV2 16681 in RPMI medium with 2% FCS and P/S. Following incubation for 2 h, cells were washed four times to remove unincorporated virus and then incubated in RPMI growth media. At the indicated times post-infection, cells were harvested and cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde. Cells were disrupted by bead-beating in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm leupeptin, 1 mm aprotinin, and 20 units/ml Superasin (Ambion)), and resultant cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-YB-1 polyclonal rabbit antibody (gift of Valentina Evdokimova, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada). Co-immunoprecipitated RNA was isolated using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). One-step RT-PCR (Qiagen) was conducted using forward (5′-TTCCACACAATGTGGCACGTCAC-3′) and reverse (5′-GGAGATCCTGACGTTCCRGG-3′) primers homologous to DENV NS3. RT-PCR products were resolved via electrophoresis on 1% agarose and visualized with ethidium bromide. Footprinting and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Analysis—RNA encoding the 3′SL of DENV was transcribed in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase. Following purification using NucAway columns (Ambion) to remove unincorporated nucleotides, RNA probes were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. Probes were resolved on a 5% denaturing acrylamide gel, excised, and eluted. Gel-purified probe was extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in double distilled H2O. Probe concentration was determined by measurement of absorbance at 260 nm, and specific activity was determined by scintillation counting. Recombinant His-YB-1 was expressed in Escherichia coli using pHISYB-1 (gift of Valentina Evdokimova) following the procedure of Evdokimova et al. (27Evdokimova V. Ruzanov P. Imataka H. Raught B. Svitkin Y. Ovchinnikov L.P. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5491-5502Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). For footprinting reactions, 10 pm of probe was incubated with purified His-YB-1 protein (at molar ratios indicated) for 15 min at room temperature. Subsequently, RNase T2 (Sigma), RNase T1 (Ambion), or RNase VI (Ambion) was added at the concentrations indicated, and reactions were incubated for an additional 10 min at room temperature before being stopped by the addition of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol. Following phenol/chloroform extraction, reactions were ethanol-precipitated in the presence of 3 μg of glycogen (Ambion). Samples were resuspended in formaldehyde loading buffer, heated to 95 °C for 3 min, and immediately cooled on ice. One-third of each sample was resolved on a 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. For electrophoretic mobility shift assays, 3′SL RNA probes were synthesized via in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase, and [α-32P]CTP was incorporated during transcription. 3′SL probe (10,000 cpm per reaction) was incubated with buffer or 5- or 10-fold molar excess of YB-1 at 25 °C for 15 min. Samples were resolved by electrophoresis on a 5%, 0.5 × TBE nondenaturing acrylamide minigel. Gels were dried and visualized using a PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). Isolation and Identification of Host Cell Proteins That Bind to the DENV 3′-UTR—To isolate and identify mammalian host factors that are involved in various stages of DENV replication, we employed an RNA affinity chromatography strategy that involved the use of a mammalian cell extract that was competent for translation. BHK cells support high levels of DENV replication and, consequently, are widely employed to study DENV infection. This prompted us to develop a methodology for large scale production of BHK extracts. The BHK extract faithfully recapitulated DENV 3′-UTR-dependent translation observed in cells (6Holden K.L. Harris E. Virology. 2004; 329: 119-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). For example, translation of DENV reporter RNAs (described in Fig. 1A) harboring the full-length 3′-UTR (5DLuc3D) was significantly more efficient than translation of constructs containing a deletion of the 3′SL (5DLuc3ΔSL) or lacking the DENV 3′-UTR (Fig. 1B and data not shown), similar to results obtained in cultured cells (6Holden K.L. Harris E. Virology. 2004; 329: 119-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Moreover, translation in BHK cell extracts was effectively competed with excess sense (Fig. 1B) but not antisense DENV 3′-UTR RNA (Fig. 1C). At high concentrations (100-fold molar excess) of antisense RNA, nonspecific titration of translation factors is likely responsible for the slight decrease in translation that is observed (Fig. 1C). BHK extracts were distinct from rabbit reticulocyte lysates; translation of 5DLuc3D reporter constructs could not be efficiently competed by excess 3′-UTR sense competitor when reactions were performed in rabbit reticulocyte lysate extracts (data not shown). We reasoned that RNA affinity chromatography employing this functional BHK extract should therefore enable us to identify factors present in BHK cells that are potentially important for mediating DENV translation by the 3′-UTR. To isolate proteins that associate with the UTRs of the DENV genome, 5DLuc3D RNA reporter constructs (Fig. 1A) were transcribed in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase, oxidized with sodium periodate, and coupled to hydrazide-agarose resin. Neither oxidation of RNA nor immobilization of reporter constructs prevented translational competency of reporter RNAs (data not shown). After extensive washing to remove uncoupled RNA, immobilized reporter constructs were incubated at 30 °C in a BHK S-10 translation extract. Importantly, the BHK S-10 lysate was not nuclease-treated, thereby ensuring the presence of endogenous competitor RNAs and more closely mimicking physiologic conditions. In these experiments, BHK extracts were treated with the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue, GMP-PNP, which prevents translation by inhibiting the for"

Previously, we demonstrated a role for c-Src kinase activation in Ox-PAPC-induced IL-8 transcription. In this study, we have examined the mechanism regulating IL-8 transcription by Ox-PAPC downstream of c-Src. Our findings demonstrate an important role for JAK2 in the regulation of IL-8 transcription by Ox-PAPC. Treatment of human aortic EC with Ox-PAPC and 1-palmitoyl-2-epoxyisoprostane-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine induced a rapid yet sustained activation of JAK2; activation of JAK2 by Ox-PAPC was dependent on c-Src kinase activity. Furthermore, pretreatment with selective JAK2 inhibitors significantly reduced Ox-PAPC-induced IL-8 transcription. In previous studies, we also demonstrated activation of STAT3 by Ox-PAPC. Here we provide evidence that STAT3 activation by Ox-PAPC is dependent on JAK2 activation and that STAT3 activation regulates IL-8 transcription by Ox-PAPC in human EC. Transfection with small interfering RNA against STAT3 significantly reduced Ox-PAPC-induced IL-8 transcription. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we demonstrated binding of activated STAT3 to the sequence flanking the consensus γ-interferon activation sequence (GAS) in the IL-8 promoter; site-directed mutagenesis of GAS inhibited IL-8 transcription by Ox-PAPC. Finally, these studies demonstrate a role for STAT3 activation in atherosclerosis in vivo. We found increased staining for activated STAT3 in the inflammatory regions of human atherosclerotic lesions and reduced fatty streak formation in EC-specific STAT3 knock-out mice on the atherogenic diet. Taken together, these data demonstrate an important role for the JAK2/STAT3 pathway in Ox-PAPC-induced IL-8 transcription in vitro and in atherosclerosis in vivo.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) 2The abbreviations used are: CVD, endothelial cell; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; GAS, γ-interferon activation sequence; Ox-PAPC, oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine; PEIPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-epoxyisoprostane-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine; HAEC, human aortic endothelial cells; IFN, interferon; IL, interleukin; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; qRT, quantitative real time; HMEC, human microvascular endothelial cells. is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Western nations. It is estimated that 80 million Americans have one or more forms of CVD. Atherosclerosis, a common cause of CVD, is a chronic inflammatory condition, involving enhanced monocyte/endothelial cell interactions. Clinical studies suggest that the inflammatory index, as measured by levels of C-reactive protein or myeloperoxidase activity, is an important independent predictor of the risk of atherosclerosis. Our laboratory has demonstrated that oxidation products of palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (PAPC) accumulate in atherosclerotic lesions and other sites of chronic inflammation. Oxidized PAPC (Ox-PAPC) and its component phospholipid, 1-palmitoyl-2-epoxyisoprostane-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (PEIPC), activate human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) in vitro to bind monocytes. Furthermore, these oxidized phospholipids increase the expression and secretion of chemokines known to activate monocytes; elevated levels of these proatherogenic chemokines have also been shown to accumulate within the vessel wall (1Berliner J.A. Kim A.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 353: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Thus, we propose that Ox-PAPC plays an important role in regulating atherosclerosis. Interleukin 8 (IL-8), an important mediator of monocyte transmigration and retention in vessel wall, is one such chemokine strongly induced in HAEC treated with Ox-PAPC. IL-8 plays an important role in the regulation of atherosclerosis. Boisvert et al. (2Boisvert W.A. Kim R. Curtiss L.K. Terkeltaub R.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) demonstrated that knock-out mice of the homologue of IL-8 had reduced levels of atherosclerotic lesions. We recently demonstrated a role for c-Src kinase in the regulation of Ox-PAPC- and PEIPC-induced IL-8 synthesis in HAEC (3Yeh M. Kim N. de Martin R. Onai N. Matsushima K. Vora D.K. Berliner J.A.

In these studies, we also presented evidence that activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 might be involved in Ox-PAPC-induced IL-8 transcription. Downstream of c-Src, however, the mechanism of IL-8 transcription by Ox-PAPC remained to be examined. In this study, we have defined the mechanism of c-Src-mediated IL-8 transcription by Ox-PAPC. Previous studies by others had demonstrated interaction between Src kinases and JAK kinases, including their role in regulating several inflammatory processes (5Bhattacharya S. Kim R.M. Johnson L.R.

The JAK family consists of four members in mammals, JAK1–3, and TYK2 (8Verma A. Kim S. Parmar S. Platanias L.C. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2003; 22: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Although JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2 are expressed in all cell types (9Rane S.G. Kim E.P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5662-5679Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), including human endothelial cells, the expression of JAK3 is restricted to cells of the myeloid and lymphoid lineages (10Leonard W.J. Kim J.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 293-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar). JAK activation is mediated by phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues (9Rane S.G. Kim E.P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5662-5679Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar); phosphorylation of tyrosine residues 1007/1008 is a marker of JAK2 activation (11Chatti K. Kim W.L. Duhe R.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4272-4283Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). JAKs are activated by autophosphorylation via direct association with cell surface receptors (9Rane S.G. Kim E.P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5662-5679Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), such as the interferon (IFN) receptor (12Qing Y. Kim G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41679-41685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), or through interaction with tyrosine kinases, such as the Src family of kinases (13Lo R.K. Kim H. Wong Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52154-52165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The major action of JAK is to promote gene transcription by activating STAT proteins (14Rane S.G. Kim E.P. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3334-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). To date, seven mammalian STAT proteins have been identified, referred to as STAT1–4, -5A, -5B, and -6 (15Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3383) Google Scholar). STAT3 activation can be detected as phosphorylation of tyrosine 705 and serine 727 (16Bhattacharjee A. Kim B. Frank D.A. Feldman G.M. Cathcart M.K. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 3771-3781Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Once activated, STAT proteins homo- or heterodimerize and translocate into the nucleus, where they activate gene transcription through binding to specific promoter response elements (17Kisseleva T. Kim S. Braunstein J. Schindler C.W. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 285: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). Most STAT dimers recognize and bind to members of the γ-IFN activation sequence (GAS) (18Decker T. Kim P. Meinke A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1997; 17: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) or the IFN-stimulated response element (19Kessler D.S. Kim D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8521-8525Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) family of enhancers to promote gene transcription; to date, homodimerized STAT3 has only been shown to have affinity for and bind to the GAS (20Yang C.H.

J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 986-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this study, we have demonstrated that in response to Ox-PAPC treatment, c-Src kinase activates JAK2, which subsequently phosphorylates and activates STAT3. Activated STAT3 then translocates into the nucleus and binds to a GAS element in the IL-8 promoter, which regulates IL-8 transcription. We have also demonstrated a role for endothelial STAT3 in atherosclerosis in mice, as well as the presence of activated STAT3 in the inflammatory regions of human atherosclerotic lesions. These findings suggest that STAT3 activation by oxidized phospholipids may be an important therapeutic target for treatment of atherosclerosis.

Treatment with lipids and other activating agents was performed in media supplemented with 1–2% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Cell Lysate Preparation—Confluent endothelial cells (HAEC and HMEC) were harvested and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer as described previously (25Walton K.A. Kim A.L. Yeh M. Subbanagounder G. Krutzik S.R. Modlin R.L. Lucas R.M. Nakai J. Smart E.J. Vora D.K. Berliner J.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1197-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). After centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatants (cell lysates) were collected. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (23Gharavi N.M. Kim N.A. Mouillesseaux K.P. Yeung W. Honda H.M. Hsieh X. Yeh M. Smart E.J. Berliner J.A. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 768-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analyses were performed as described previously (23Gharavi N.M. Kim N.A. Mouillesseaux K.P. Yeung W. Honda H.M. Hsieh X. Yeh M. Smart E.J. Berliner J.A. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 768-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and separated on 4–20% acrylamide gels. There were transferred overnight using polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. The membranes were then stained for specific antibody binding according to manufacturers' recommended protocols for the individual antibodies. Peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody was employed and developed with ECL plus. Films were scanned for quantitation of the levels of antibody staining. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—IL-8 levels in cell media were measured with an IL-8 ELISA kit (Quantikine, R & D Systems) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Plasmids—Luciferase-reporter plasmids containing the human IL-8 promoter (pIL-8-Luc, -1481 to +44 bp) were obtained from Dr. K. Matsushima (University of Tokyo, Japan) (26Yasumoto K. Kim S. Mukaida N. Murakami S. Mai M. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22506-22511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dominant-negative JAK2 (DN-JAK2) construct, which contains a double mutation in C-terminal kinase domain, was provided by Dr. Sunil Srivastava (University of Cincinnati, Ohio) (27Srivastava S. Kim M. Hou Z. Bailey J.P. Kitazawa R. Herbst M.P. Horseman N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46171-46178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). PCR Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutations in the GAS element in the pIL-8-Luc were created with a commercially available site-directed mutagenesis kit (QuikChange, Stratagene), and protocols were provided by the manufacturer. Mutation primers were designed as described previously (3Yeh M. Kim N. de Martin R. Onai N. Matsushima K. Vora D.K. Berliner J.A. Reddy S.T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1585-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and ordered from Invitrogen. The potential GAS element, found at -537, was mutated from 5′-ttcctagaa-3′ to 5′-tgcatggca-3′. Transient Transfection of Plasmids—HMEC were plated in 48-well culture dishes (2.0 × 106 cells/plate). After 48 h, with cells at 90% confluence, transfections were performed in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) with 0.125 μg of total DNA (0.05 μg of p-IL8-Luc, 0.025 μg of phRL-Renilla, and 0.05 μg of either the empty vector, pEFBos, or DN-JAK2) per well and Lipofectin Transfection reagent (Invitrogen) at 1:5 as described previously (4Yeh M. Kim N.M. Choi J. Hsieh X. Reed E. Mouillesseaux K.P. Cole A.L. Reddy S.T. Berliner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30175-30181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity, normalized to phRL-Renilla (Promega), was analyzed. Transient Transfection of Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—siRNA against STAT3, GC %-matched scrambled control (scRNA), and Lipofectamine 2000 were purchased from Invitrogen. Conditions were optimized from the manufacturer's suggested 50 nm siRNA and 5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 by testing 5, 20, and 100 nm siRNA. It was found that 5 nm, along with a slightly reduced amount of Lipofectamine 2000, yielded the greatest mRNA knockdown and eliminated transfection-induced IL-8 mRNA synthesis. HAEC were transfected in a 6-well dish at 50% confluence for 3 h with 5 nm siRNA or scRNA, and 4 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 in 2 ml of Opti-MEM minimal serum-free media per well. Afterward, cells were rinsed and plated in full-growth media, and allowed to grow an additional 48 h, until confluent. Quantitative Real Time PCR (qRT-PCR) Using SYBR Green Chemistry—Primers for IL-8 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were designed using Primer Quest on-line design tool (Integrated DNA Technologies). Sequences were as follows: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-cattgccctcaacgaccactttgt-3′ and 5′-accaccctgttgctgtagccaaat-3′; IL-8, 5′-accacactgcgccaacacagaaat-3′ and 5′-tccagacagagctctcttccatcaga-3′; JAK2, 5′-gcaccaagtgggcagaattagca-3′ and 5′-tgatggtctgaaagaaggcctga-3′; STAT3, 5′-agggtgtcagatcacatgggctaa-3′ and 5′-ttcgttccaaagggccaggatgta-3′. qRT-PCR was performed, and data were analyzed as described previously (23Gharavi N.M. Kim N.A. Mouillesseaux K.P. Yeung W. Honda H.M. Hsieh X. Yeh M. Smart E.J. Berliner J.A. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 768-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP assays were performed using the ChIP-IT™ chromatin immunoprecipitation kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions with the average size of sheared fragments ∼500 bp. The following forward and reverse primers that targeted sequence flanking GAS element (5′-ttcctagaa-3′, 537 bp upstream of START), in the IL-8 gene promoter were used: 5′-ggttttcacagtgctttcac-3′ and 5′-tttccctctttgagtcatgc-3′. To identify the GAS element in the IL-8 promoter, we used Gene2Promoter program (Genomatix) to identify potential transcription factor binding sites. Approximately 1-kb sequence upstream and 100-bp sequence downstream of the transcription start site were examined. This GAS element was also confirmed by the MOTIF program. For confirmation, the promoter sequence for the gene of interest was obtained from the UCSC genome browser and analyzed using the MOTIF program. Approximately 2 kb upstream of the start site in the IL-8 promoter were examined. Similar results with ChIP assays were obtained in two experiments. Immunohistochemistry—Human carotid endarterectomy samples from seven different donors were obtained. Specimens were placed directly on ice and fixed within 1 h in fixative containing 3% buffered neutral formalin and subsequently paraffin-embedded. Four-μm-thick sections were de-paraffinized and rehydrated. Immunostaining was performed as described previously (28Qiao J.H. Kim R.B. Fishbein M.C. Geller S.A. Hum. Pathol. 2003; 34: 402-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). For incubation with blocking peptide 5 μg/ml of peptide were employed and incubated with antibody for 0.5 h before use in immunostaining. Mice and Atherosclerotic Lesion Quantitation—Mice with a conditional STAT3 allele (STAT3f/f) were obtained from the laboratory of Dr. Xin-Yuan Fu (Yale University, New Haven, CT) (29Kano A. Kim M.J. Gao Q. Jacoby J. Chai G.X. Hansen W. Iwamoto Y. Pober J.S. Flavell R.A. Fu X.Y. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1517-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Cre-recombinase transgenic mice, in which Cre expression was regulated by the VE-cadherin promoter (VE-Cre), were obtained from the laboratory of Dr. Luisa Iruela-Arispe (UCLA) (30Alva J.A. Kim A.C. Monvoisin A. Murphy T. Salazar A. Harvey N.L. Carmeliet P. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Dev. Dyn. 2006; 235: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). VE-Cre mice were backcrossed a total of six generations onto the C57BL/6J background and then bred with STAT3f/f mice, which were already on the C57BL/6J background. The resulting heterozygotes (Cre STAT3f/+) were backcrossed with STAT3f/f to generate 12 STAT3f/f (eSTAT3+/+) and 12 Cre STAT3f/f mice (eSTAT3-/-). At 8 weeks of age, mice were transferred onto the atherogenic diet containing 15% fat, 1.25% cholesterol, and 0.5% sodium cholate (TD 90221, Harlan Teklad) for 16 weeks. Mice were subsequently fasted for 12 h, weighed, and bled by retro-orbital puncture for lipid profile analysis. Cholesterol measurements were performed in triplicates as described previously (31Hedrick C.C. Kim L.W. Warden C.H. Puppione D.L. Lusis A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20676-20682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sectioning of the heart and quantitative analysis of lesion size were performed as described previously (31Hedrick C.C. Kim L.W. Warden C.H. Puppione D.L. Lusis A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20676-20682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Macrophage content was also examined after staining with CD68 antibody of five sections from each mouse. The number of nuclei in the lesion area stained positively with CD68 was determined. We only included cells with an identifiable nucleus. Ox-PAPC and PEIPC Treatment of HAEC Activates JAK2—To determine whether treatment of HAEC with Ox-PAPC and its most active component, PEIPC, activated JAK2, phosphorylation of JAK2 at Tyr-1007/1008 was examined using Western analysis at various time points following Ox-PAPC and PEIPC treatment. Phospho-specific JAK2 antibodies detected an increase in Tyr-1007/1008 phosphorylation within 2 min (and for up to 4 h) following treatment with Ox-PAPC (45 μg/ml; see Fig. 1A, top panel) and PEIPC (1 μg/ml; see Fig. 1B, top panel). Total levels of JAK2 remained unchanged at all time points following treatment with Ox-PAPC (Fig. 1A, middle panel) and PEIPC (Fig. 1B, middle panel). Using densitometry, we calculated the fold activation of JAK2 by measuring the ratio of Ox-PAPC- or PEIPC-induced phosphor-JAK2 band to that of PAPC-induced phosphor-JAK2 band intensity. Over several experiments, at their respective 1-h peaks, Ox-PAPC treatment of HAEC induced a 4-fold increase in JAK2 phosphorylation (Fig. 1A, bottom panel), whereas PEIPC treatment induced a 3-fold increase (Fig. 1B, bottom panel). We also examined the activation state of JAK1 following Ox-PAPC treatment. Our findings demonstrated that Ox-PAPC treatment of HAEC did not alter the levels of JAK1 Tyr-1022/1023 phosphorylation, a marker of JAK1 activation (data not shown). These findings demonstrated that treatment of HAEC with Ox-PAPC and PEIPC activated JAK2, but not JAK1, in a rapid, yet sustained manner. In a previous study (4Yeh M. Kim N.M. Choi J. Hsieh X. Reed E. Mouillesseaux K.P. Cole A.L. Reddy S.T. Berliner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30175-30181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), we demonstrated activation of c-Src kinase in HAEC following Ox-PAPC treatment. The interaction between c-Src and JAK2 has been reported in other systems (13Lo R.K. Kim H. Wong Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52154-52165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 32Masamune A. Kim M. Kikuta K. Suzuki N. Shimosegawa T. World J. Gastroenterol. 2005; 11: 3385-3391Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Because our findings demonstrated that Ox-PAPC-induced JAK2 activation was sustained for up to 4 h, whereas c-Src activation was rapid and transient, we hypothesized that activation of JAK2 was downstream of c-Src activation. To address whether Ox-PAPC-induced JAK2 activation was mediated though c-Src kinase, we utilized the chemical inhibitor of c-Src kinase activity, PP2, and its inactive analogue, PP3. Pretreatment of HAEC with PP2, but not PP3, decreased Ox-PAPC-induced JAK2 Tyr-1007/1008 phosphorylation (Fig. 1C, top panel), whereas total JAK2 levels remained unchanged (Fig. 1C, middle panel). Densitometry from four experiments revealed a 50% reduction in JAK2 activation with PP2 (Fig. 1C, bottom panel). Furthermore, we observed that the inhibitory effect of PP2 on JAK2 activation was specific to Ox-PAPC, because PP2 did not affect the activation of JAK2 by IFNγ, a known JAK2 activator (Fig. 1C). Inhibition of JAK2 Activation Decreases Ox-PAPC- and PEIPC-induced IL-8 Synthesis—To test the hypothesis that JAK2 plays a role in Ox-PAPC-induced IL-8 synthesis, we employed the selective JAK2 inhibitor, AG490. This inhibitor represses JAK2 activity with an IC50 in the low (<10 μm) micromolar range, and concentrations as high as 50 μm have been shown to have no effect on the activity of Src kinases (33Meydan N. Kim T. Dadi H. Shahar M. Arpaia E. Lapidot Z. Leeder J.S. Freedman M. Cohen A. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Roifman C.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). In our studies, using 10 μm AG490, we also observed no effect on phosphorylation of Tyr-418 of c-Src in response to OxPAPC (data not shown). Pretreatment of HAEC with AG490 caused a significant dose-dependent decrease in Ox-PAPC-induced IL-8 protein synthesis, as measured by ELISA (Fig. 2A). Pretreatment of HAEC with 10 μm AG490 also significantly reduced the induction of IL-8 protein synthesis by PEIPC (Fig. 2B). Because the induction of IL-8 protein synthesis by Ox-PAPC is mediated at the transcription level, we examined the role of JAK2 in mediating Ox-PAPC-induced IL-8 mRNA levels. Pretreatment of HAEC with AG490 significantly reduced the levels of IL-8 mRNA induced by Ox-PAPC at 2 h (data not shown) and at 4 h (Fig. 2C) following treatment, as measured by qRT-PCR. In this experiment, we also demonstrated that AG9, the inactive analogue to AG490, did not inhibit Ox-PAPC-induced IL-8 transcription (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, pretreatment of HAEC with 10 μm AG490 did not reduce the levels of c-Src activation by Ox-PAPC presented as fold change in level of Src phosphorylation (no addition 2.7 ± 0.4, AG490 3.1 ± 0.3). For this experiment cells were pretreated with AG490 10 μm for 30 min followed by a 1-min treatment with Ox-PAPC (the optimal time for Src phosphorylation). To further test the role of JAK2 in regulating Ox-PAPC-induced IL-8 transcription, we examined the effect of a dominant-negative kinase-deficient JAK2 construct (DN-JAK2) on IL-8 promoter (pIL-8-Luc) activation. In HMEC, transient transfection of DN-JAK2 caused a significant reduction in Ox-PAPC-induced IL-8 promoter activation by ∼40%, as compared with empty vector (Fig. 2D). These findings demonstrated that JAK2 activation regulates the induction of IL-8 transcription by Ox-PAPC. JAK2 Activation Regulates IL-8 Transcription through STAT3—We next examined the mechanism by which JAK2 activation regulated Ox-PAPC-induced IL-8 transcription. Previously, we had proposed a role for STAT3 in IL-8 transcription by Ox-PAPC. Therefore, we examined the role of JAK2 on the activation of STAT3 by Ox-PAPC. For these studies, siRNA to JAK2 was employed. Treatment of HAEC with siRNA to JAK2 down-regulated JAK2 mRNA levels by greater than 90%, as compared with transfection with scRNA oligonucleotides (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, JAK2 siRNA completely inhibited Ox-PAPC-induced STAT3 activation, as measured by Tyr-705 phosphorylation (Fig. 3B, top panel), but has no significant effect on total STAT3 levels (Fig. 3B, middle panel). This result was observed in several experiments (Fig. 3B, bottom panel). Next, we examined the role of STAT3 in Ox-PAPC-induced IL-8 transcription using siRNA against STAT3. STAT3 is composed of two isoforms, STAT3α (86 kDa) and STAT3β (79 kDa); the siRNA used in our studies targeted the STAT3α isoform. Our findings demonstrated a 90% knockdown in relative STAT3α mRNA levels following transfection with the STAT3 siRNA, as compared with transfection with scRNA oligonucleotides (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, STAT3 siRNA significantly reduced the levels of IL-8 mRNA induced by Ox-PAPC in HAEC, as compared with transfection with scRNA (Fig. 3D). These findings demonstrated that JAK2 activation regulated IL-8 transcription in HAEC through STAT3 activation. Identification of the GAS Element in the IL-8 Promoter and Its Role in IL-8 Transcription by Ox-PAPC—To determine the mechanism by which STAT3 regulated IL-8 transcription by Ox-PAPC, we first examined the human IL-8 promoter for a sequence homologous to the known STAT3 response element, GAS.

The human HIF-P4Hs have three isoenzymes, HIF-P4Hs 1-3 (also known as PHDs 1-3, HPHs 3-1, and EGLNs 2, 1, and 3, respectively), which show a 42–59% sequence identity to each other but essentially no sequence similarity to the C-P4Hs except for the catalytically critical residues (12Bruick R.K.

The human HIF-α subunit has three isoforms, HIF-1α–HIF-3α. HIF-1α and HIF-2α are synthesized constitutively, and hydroxylation of at least one of two critical proline residues in their oxygen-dependent degradation domain (ODDD), Pro402 and Pro564 in HIF-1α, generates a binding site for the von Hippel-Lindau E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that targets HIF-αs for rapid proteasomal degradation under normoxic conditions. This hydroxylation is inhibited in hypoxia, so that the HIF-αs escape degradation, translocate to the nucleus, and dimerize with HIF-β. The dimer then recognizes the HIF-responsive elements in various hypoxia-regulated genes (5Schofield C.J. Ratcliffe P.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

All P4Hs are 2-oxoglutarate dioxygenases that require Fe2+, 2-oxoglutarate, O2, and ascorbate. The C-terminal region of the C-P4H α subunits contains four conserved residues, two histidines, and one aspartate that bind the Fe2+ atom and a lysine that binds the C-5 carboxyl group of the 2-oxoglutarate (15Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1173-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar).

We report here on the characterization of a novel human P4H (P4H-TM), which, unlike any other P4H characterized so far, possesses a transmembrane domain. Oehme et al. (16Oehme F. Ellinghaus P. Kolkhof P. Smith T.J. Ramakrishnan S. Hütter J. Schramm M. Flamme I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) have studied this same protein, noted its sequence similarity to the C-P4Hs but not the HIF-P4Hs, shown it to be associated with the ER, suggested an orientation in which the catalytic site may be on the cytosolic surface, and shown that its overexpression suppressed cellular HIF-1α and HIF-2α reporter transactivation activity and reduced the HIF-2α protein level. P4H-TM was inactive in vitro, however, suggesting that it may need a modification to become active or may modify a member of the HIF degradation pathway without directly acting on HIF-α (16Oehme F. Ellinghaus P. Kolkhof P. Smith T.J. Ramakrishnan S. Hütter J. Schramm M. Flamme I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Correspondingly it was not possible to demonstrate directly whether P4H-TM is indeed a P4H (16Oehme F. Ellinghaus P. Kolkhof P. Smith T.J. Ramakrishnan S. Hütter J. Schramm M. Flamme I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Our surveys of gene bank sequences indicated that the gene encoding P4H-TM is found only in vertebrates, including zebrafish, but not in flies and nematodes. Its sequence resembles more closely those of the C-P4Hs than the HIF-P4Hs, but P4H-TM lacks sequences corresponding to those of the peptide substrate-binding domain of the C-P4Hs. P4H-TM is a hypoxia-inducible homodimer, it is N-glycosylated and is located in the ER membrane in an orientation in which the catalytic site is inside the lumen. Despite this location, its overexpression in cultured human neuroblastoma Kelly cells reduced HIF-α-ODDD reporter construct levels, and its siRNA increased the HIF-1α protein level. Furthermore, recombinant human P4H-TM produced in insect cells hydroxylated the two critical prolines in HIF-1α and its ODDD in vitro, with a preference for the C-terminal hydroxylation site, whereas it did not hydroxylate any prolines in recombinant type I procollagen chains. Cloning, Expression, and Analysis of Recombinant Human P4H-TM—Full-length human P4H-TM cDNA was cloned into the baculovirus expression vector pVL1392 (for details see supplemental material). In addition, baculovirus vectors encoding the signal sequence of PDI or GP67, a His6 tag, and P4H-TM beginning at Asp88 were generated. The recombinant baculovirus vectors were cotransfected into Sf9 cells with BaculoGold DNA (PharMingen), and the resultant viruses were amplified and used to infect Sf9 and H5 cells. Full-length human P4H-TM cDNA was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1(–)/Zeo (Invitrogen), which was transiently or stably transfected into HEK293 cells. Expression of the recombinant P4H-TM polypeptides was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining or Western blotting. The molecular mass of P4H-TM was determined by gel filtration of the Triton X-100-soluble fraction of insect cells expressing full-length recombinant P4H-TM in a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated, and eluted with 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 m glycine, 10 μm dithiothreitol, 0.01 m Tris buffer, pH 7.8, after which the fractions were analyzed by Western blotting. The His-tagged P4H-TM starting at Asp88 was purified with ProBond resin (Invitrogen) pre-equilibrated with 0.015 m imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.02 m Tris buffer, pH 8.0, at 4 °C. The proteins were eluted using a gradient of 0.015–0.5 m imidazole, and fractions containing P4H-TM were pooled and passed through a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 μm FeSO4, 0.002 m CaCl2, 0.02 m Tris buffer, pH 8.0. Protein concentrations were measured with RotiQuant (Roth), N-terminal sequencing was performed in Procise™ 492 (Applied Biosystems), and CD spectra were measured in a Jasco J715 spectropolarimeter in a 1-mm quartz cuvette at 20 °C in 0.01 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.5. A rabbit polyclonal antibody to the purified His-tagged P4H-TM beginning at Asp88 was generated at Innovagen (Lund, Sweden), and the immunoglobulins were purified using a HiTrap Protein G column (Amersham Biosciences). The deglycosylation experiments were performed in 0.005% SDS, 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.05 m sodium acetate, pH 6.0, with 0.2 units/ml N-glycosidase F (Roche Applied Science) for 2 h at 37 °C. Control samples were incubated similarly but without N-glycosidase F. Analysis of the Expression of P4H-TM mRNA—Human multiple tissue Northern blots (Clontech) were hybridized with a fragment of P4H-TM cDNA (bp 193–966). Total RNA from human epiphyseal cartilage (a gift from Dr. Eero Vuorio, University of Turku) and cultured fibroblasts were reverse transcribed to cDNA (SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit, Clontech) and used as templates in PCR with the same primers that gave the above fragment. A 1000-bp fragment of the C-P4H α(II) subunit cDNA was amplified in control experiments. PCR analysis of the human tumor multiple tissue panel (Clontech) was performed with P4H-TM primers, amplifying a fragment of bp 193–488. The PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel. P4H Activity Assays—P4H activity was assayed by the hydroxylation-coupled decarboxylation of 2-oxo[1-14C]glutarate (17Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R.

Analysis of the Expression of Endogenous P4H-TM in Various Human Cell Lines—Human adult fibroblasts (CRL-2068) and embryonic kidney (HEK293), hepatocellular carcinoma (Hep3B), fibrosarcoma (HT1080), and neuroblastoma (Kelly) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection or the German Resource Centre for Biological Material and cultured in Dulbecco's (Biochrom) or Eagle's (Sigma) minimal essential medium or in RPMI 1640 (Sigma) medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (BioClear) and 50 μg/ml ascorbate. The cells were exposed to hypoxia in 1% O2 balanced with 5% CO2 and 95% N2 for 20 h in an InVivo2 400 hypoxia work station (Ruskinn Technologies). The culture medium was removed, and cell extracts were obtained by lysing the cells in 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, followed by analysis on SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with P4H-TM and α-tubulin (Sigma) antibodies. Immunofluorescence and Immuno-EM—Cellular location of endogenous P4H-TM in normoxic and hypoxic HEK293 cells was studied by immunofluorescence staining and the ultrastructural location of endogenous and recombinant P4H-TM in HEK293 and Sf9 cells by immuno-EM staining with the P4H-TM antibody (for details see supplemental material). Transient Overexpressions and ODDD Reporter Gene Assays—Triplicate wells of 4 × 104 Kelly cells seeded in 96-well plates were cotransfected with 37.5 ng of HIF-ODDD reporter plasmids in which the N-terminal or C-terminal region of the HIF-1α or HIF-2α ODDDs (20Appelhoff R.J.

The empty vector pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) was used to obtain equal amounts of DNA in each cotransfection. The cells were cultured in the presence of the transfection mixture in RPMI and 10% fetal bovine serum for 24 h, after which cell extracts were prepared and analyzed for β-galactosidase and luciferase activities (Tropix). Luciferase levels were normalized to β-galactosidase activity to assess the transfection efficiency. siRNA Transfections and HIF-1α Protein Determination—Kelly cells (1.6 × 106) were transfected with 120 pmol of siRNA for HIF-P4H-1, 2, or 3 (Ambion) or P4H-TM (Dharmacon) or a nontargeting control siRNA (siCNTL, Dharmacon) with an Amaxa nucleoporator according to the manufacturer's instructions (Solution V, Program D-23) and seeded to 50% confluency. The cells were cultured in RPMI and 10% fetal bovine serum for 48 h, after which cell extracts were prepared and analyzed for HIF-1α protein levels using a HIF-1α whole cell lysate kit (MesoScale Discovery). The amount of HIF-1α was normalized to mg of total protein as determined by a BCA assay (Pierce). The efficiency of silencing by siRNA was monitored by 18 S normalized quantitative PCR on Cells-to-Signal (Ambion) lysates with an ABI7000 machine, and the values were found to be 78, 82, 51, and 93% for HIF-P4H-1, HIF-P4H-2, HIF-P4H-3, and P4H-TM mRNAs, respectively. Intron-spanning probes for HIF-P4H-1 (Hs00363196_m1), HIF-P4H-2 (Hs00254392_m1), HIF-P4H-3 (Hs00222966_m1), and P4H-TM (Hs00214665_m1) from Applied Biosystems were used with QuantiTect Multiplex reverse transcription-PCR reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The P4H-TM Sequence Is More Closely Related to the C-P4H than the HIF-P4H Sequences but Lacks Sequences Corresponding to the Peptide Substrate-binding Domain of the C-P4Hs—The human P4H-TM cDNA encodes a 502-residue polypeptide with no signal sequence but a putative transmembrane domain (Fig. 1, residues 59–82). Our data base searches indicated that P4H-TM is also found in other vertebrates and that a polypeptide with 51% identity to the human sequence is present in the zebrafish (accession number ENS-DART00000012024.3) but not in Caenorhabditis elegans or Drosophila melanogaster. The human P4H-TM sequence is 14–15% identical to those of the human C-P4H α(I)-α(III) subunits and 10–13% identical to those of the human HIF-P4Hs 1–3 (Fig. 1). The identity is highest within the catalytically important C-terminal region, P4H-TM residues 314–502 being 26–28% and 13–15% identical to the corresponding residues in the C-P4H α subunits and the HIF-P4Hs, respectively (Fig. 1). The two histidines and one aspartate that bind the Fe2+ atom and the basic residue that binds the C-5 carboxyl group of 2-oxoglutarate are conserved (stars in Fig. 1), the basic residue being a lysine, as in the C-P4Hs, whereas it is an arginine in the HIF-P4Hs (12Bruick R.K.

The catalytically critical C-terminal region of P4H-TM is thus more closely related to those of the C-P4Hs than the HIF-P4Hs, both in terms of overall identity and on account of the 2-oxoglutarate-binding residue. The C terminus of the polypeptide has a sequence Arg-Val-Glu-Leu that is a functional variant of the Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu ER retention signal. 3Lloyd Ruddock, personal communication. The human polypeptide has two potential N-glycosylation sites, Asn-Val-Thr (residues 368–370) and Asn-Arg-Thr (residues 382–384). The C-P4Hs have a peptide substrate-binding domain that is distinct from the catalytic domain and is located between Phe144 and Ser244 in the human α(I) subunit (23Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Many characteristic features of peptide binding to the C-P4Hs can be explained by binding to this domain rather than the catalytic domain (24Hieta R. Kukkola L. Permi P. Pirilä P. Kivirikko K.I.

This region of the P4H-TM sequence shows no similarity to those of the C-P4H α subunits, and none of the seven tyrosines is conserved in the human P4H-TM sequence (Fig. 1). As pointed out (16Oehme F. Ellinghaus P. Kolkhof P. Smith T.J. Ramakrishnan S. Hütter J. Schramm M. Flamme I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), a calcium-binding EF hand motif is found between P4H-TM residues 192 and 249. P4H-TM mRNA Is Expressed in Many Human Tissues, with the Highest Levels in the Pancreas, Heart, Skeletal Muscle, Brain, Placenta, and Kidney—Northern analysis indicated that P4H-TM mRNA is expressed in many human tissues, with adult tissues showing higher levels than fetal tissues (Fig. 2, A–C). Three mRNA species of 2.7, 2.3, and 1.8 kb were seen in several tissues, the 1.8-kb species being the main form in all except the brain. Additional experiments using PCR indicated that the mRNA is also expressed at low levels in epiphyseal cartilage, where C-P4H II is the main C-P4H form (2Myllyharju J. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), and in fibroblasts (Fig. 2D). The expression pattern differs markedly from those of the C-P4H mRNAs. The C-P4H α(I)-(III) mRNAs, for example, show very little expression in the adult brain where P4H-TM mRNA was expressed at high levels. PCR analysis showed that P4H-TM mRNA is also expressed in all of the tumor samples studied (Fig. 2E). Recombinant Human P4H-TM Is a Homodimer and Is in Part Cleaved after the Transmembrane Domain—A recombinant baculovirus encoding human P4H-TM was generated and used to infect Sf9 insect cells. The cells were homogenized in a buffer containing Triton X-100 and centrifuged, and the pellets were solubilized in 1% SDS. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions followed by Coomassie Blue staining or Western blotting (Fig. 3A). The recombinant polypeptide was mainly found in the SDS extract, but significant amounts were also seen in the Triton X-100 fraction (Fig. 3A, lanes 1, 2, 7, and 8). The polypeptide was found in two forms (Fig. 3A, lanes 7 and 8). N-terminal sequencing indicated that these began with Met1 and Asp88 (not shown), indicating that some of the full-length polypeptides become cleaved after the transmembrane domain. Western blot analysis of the soluble fraction of human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells transfected with a plasmid encoding full-length P4H-TM likewise showed the presence of two immunoreactive polypeptides (Fig. 3A, lane 11) with mobilities identical to those in the insect cells, indicating that the cleavage also occurs in mammalian cells. The molecular composition of recombinant P4H-TM was studied by gel filtration of the soluble fraction from insect cells expressing the full-length polypeptide. P4H-TM was found in fractions corresponding to molecular masses of ∼105–120 kDa and 85–90 kDa, suggesting that both the full-length P4H-TM and its cleaved form exist as homodimers (details not shown). To overcome difficulties that are common in the purification of membrane proteins, two additional viruses were generated to produce truncated P4H-TM polypeptides starting from Asp88, thus lacking the transmembrane domain. One of them contained a baculovirus GP67 signal sequence followed by a His tag in its N terminus. The majority of this recombinant polypeptide was secreted into the culture medium by the H5 insect cells but not by the Sf9 cells. The other virus encoded a polypeptide beginning at Asp88 and contained a PDI signal sequence and a His tag, the majority of this polypeptide remaining inside both cell types (Fig. 3A, lanes 3, 4, 9, and 10). Both polypeptides could be purified to homogeneity from the culture medium or the soluble fraction of the cell lysate, depending on the signal sequence, using a metal chelate resin and imidazole elution (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 6). N-terminal sequencing indicated that the signal peptide had been cleaved from both polypeptides (not shown). To study whether recombinant P4H-TM is glycosylated, purified P4H-TM starting from Asp88 was treated with N-glycosidase F and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. A distinct increase was found in the mobility of the polypeptide after the treatment, indicating that it had been synthesized in the insect cells in an N-glycosylated form (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 2). Recombinant full-length P4H-TM and its cleaved form were also found to be glycosylated in HEK293 cells, because an increase in their mobility was seen after N-glycosidase F treatment (Fig. 3B, lanes 3–6). The CD spectrum of the polypeptide beginning at Asp88 was typical of a folded protein (details not shown). P4H-TM Is Expressed in Many Human Cell Lines and Is Induced by Hypoxia—We studied expression of the P4H-TM polypeptide in cultured human adult fibroblasts and embryonic kidney (HEK293), hepatoma (Hep3B), fibrosarcoma (HT1080), and neuroblastoma (Kelly) cells by Western blotting. Two immunoreactive polypeptides with molecular masses corresponding to those of glycosylated and nonglycosylated recombinant full-length P4H-TM (see above) were seen in all of the cell lines studied (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the amount of P4H-TM was greatly increased by hypoxia in all the cell lines except the HT1080 cells, where the increase was only moderate, and the Kelly cells, where no increase was observed (Fig. 4). The normoxic expression level of P4H-TM was highest in the HT1080 cells, whereas P4H-TM was not detected in normoxic HEK293 and Hep3B cells at all (Fig. 4). In agreement with the induction by hypoxia, the 5′-untranslated sequence of the gene encoding human P4H-TM was found to contain five hypoxia-responsive elements 5′-RCGTG-3′, at positions –1961, –1952, –874, –757, and –197 with respect to the translation start site.

MstI is a common component of apoptosis initiated by various stresses. MstI kinase activation requires autophosphorylation and proteolytic degradation by caspases. The role of Akt in regulating MstI activity has not been previously examined. Here, we show that MstI is a physiological substrate of Akt. Akt phosphorylation of MstI diminishes its apoptotic cleavage by caspases and prevents its kinase activity on FOXO3. MstI directly binds to Akt, which is regulated Akt kinase activity. Akt phosphorylates MstI on the Thr387 residue and protects MstI from apoptotic cleavage in vitro and in apoptotic cells. Interestingly, Akt phosphorylation of MstI strongly inhibits its kinase activity on FOXO3. The phosphorylation mimetic mutant MST1 T387E blocks H2O2-triggered FOXO3 nuclear translocation and apoptosis. Thus, our findings support that Akt blocks MstI-triggered FOXO3 nuclear translocation by phosphorylating MstI, promoting cell survival.

(forkhead box O; forkhead members of the O class) are transcription factors. FOXO factors mediate cell death by regulating numerous apoptotic genes transcription (1Kops G.J. Burgering B.M. J. Mol.

Insulin-mediated inhibition of FOXO factors is predominantly regulated through a shuttling mechanism that distributes FOXO localization to the cytoplasm, thereby terminating its transcriptional function (4Van Der Heide L.P. Hoekman M.F. Smidt M.P. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 297-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). FOXO factors contain three highly conserved putative Akt recognition motifs (RXRXX(S/T), where X denotes any residue), two at the N and C termini, respectively, and one located in the forkhead domain. All FOXO proteins require Akt phosphorylation in the N terminus and in the forkhead domain to translocate from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (5Brownawell A.M. Kops G.J. Macara I.G. Burgering B.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 3534-3546Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The two phosphorylated residues are essential components for translocation, as they influence the NLS (nuclear localization sequence) function and the association with 14-3-3 proteins (2Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5454) Google Scholar). Recently, Bonni and co-workers demonstrated that MstI mediates oxidative stress-induced neuronal apoptosis through FOXO factors by phosphorylating FOXO3 on Ser207. This phosphorylation triggers its nuclear translocation and disrupting the association between 14-3-3 and FOXO in the cytoplasm (6Lehtinen M.K. Yuan Z. Boag P.R. Yang Y. Villen J. Becker E.B.

MstI belongs to class II GC (protein Ser/Thr) kinase (7Creasy C.L. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21695-21700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), which contains 487 residues and predominantly resides in the cytoplasm. MstI consists of an N-terminal catalytic domain in the Ste20 class, followed by a non-catalytic tail comprising of an autoinhibitory domain and a coiled-coil domain that mediates dimerization (8Creasy C.L. Ambrose D.M. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21049-21053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that, physiologically, MstI exists as an autoinhibitory homodimer that is activated after post-translational modification such as phosphorylation and/or cleavage. Although caspase-mediated cleavage removes the C-terminal regulatory domain, which is associated with an increase in MstI activity, there is evidence that caspase-mediated cleavage alone cannot activate MstI and both phosphorylation and proteolysis are necessary to activate fully this enzyme (9Graves J.D.

Several phosphorylation sites have now been identified in MstI, namely Thr175, Thr177, Thr183, Thr187, Ser327, and Thr387 (9Graves J.D. Draves K.E. Gotoh Y. Krebs E.G. Clark E.A. J. Biol.

Overexpression of MstI alone is sufficient to initiate apoptosis in various cells, which involves activation of SAPK (stress-activated protein kinase)/JNK (13Graves J.D. Gotoh Y. Draves K.E.

MstI potently interacts with both growth inhibitory proteins RASSF1A and NORE1A. Overexpression of RASSF1A increases kinase activity of MstI in intact cells (17Praskova M. Khoklatchev A. Ortiz-Vega S. Avruch J. Biochem.

Interestingly, PP2A treatment up-regulates MstI kinase activity, whereas EGF treatment decreases its kinase activity, suggesting that phosphorylation on the resting MstI negatively modulates its kinase activity. Mitogenic signal might trigger its further phosphorylation, resulting in reduction of its kinase activity (7Creasy C.L. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21695-21700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that Akt binds and phosphorylates MstI, leading to its resistance against apoptotic cleavage and inhibition of its kinase activity on FOXO3. In addition, we show that MstI T387E, an Akt phosphorylation mimetic mutant, blocks FOXO3 nuclear translocation regardless of H2O2 stimulation, preventing apoptosis. In contrast, MstI T387A, a nonphosphorylated mutant, strongly phosphorylates FOXO3 and triggers its nuclear translocation, enhancing cell death. Cells and Reagents—HEK293 cells were maintained in medium A (DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units of penicillin-streptomycin) at 37 °C with 5% CO2 atmosphere in a humidified incubator. EGF was from Roche Applied Sciences. Anti-caspase-3 and anti-tubulin antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-Myc, anti-phospho-Akt-473, and anti-Akt were from Cell Signaling. Anti-MstI and anti-phospho-MstI antibodies and active Akt protein were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-Foxo3 Ser207 antibody was from Invitrogen. All the chemicals not included above were from Sigma. Cell-free Apoptotic Solution Preparation and MstI Cleavage Assay—The procedures are exactly as described (19Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4484) Google Scholar). Briefly, the pellets of 293 cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 5 vol of buffer A, supplemented with protease inhibitors. After sitting on ice for 15 min, the cells were broken by passing 15 times through a G22 needle. After centrifugation in a microcentrifuge for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were further centrifuged at 105 × g for 30 min in an ultracentrifuge (Beckman). The resulting supernatants were used for in vitro apoptosis assay. The purified activated caspase 3 was added into S-100 extract to initiate caspase cascade. After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, in vitro transcripted and translated MstI protein, which was treated with or without active Akt, or purified GST-MstI recombinant proteins were introduced and incubated for another hour. The reaction mixture was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-GST-HRP or autoradiography, respectively. In Vitro Binding Assays—GST fusion proteins were prepared and coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads. HEK293 cells were transfected with HA-tagged Akt constructs, and the cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 40 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin A), and centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 × g at 4 °C. The cell lysates were incubated with GST protein-conjugated glutathione beads at 4 °C for 3 h. After incubation, the beads were washed three times with 500 μl of lysis buffer each time. The agarose then was resuspended in 30 μl of sample buffer separated by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting analysis. Cytochemical Staining of Apoptotic Cells—MstI-transfected cells were treated with or without 35 μm etoposide for 16 h, followed by incubation with a fluorescent dye MR(DEVD)2 for 1 h. The red cells are considered apoptotic. Morphological changes in the nuclear chromatin of cells undergoing apoptosis were detected by staining with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) as described (20Ye K. Ke Y. Keshava N. Shanks J. Kapp J.A. Tekmal R.R. Petros J. Joshi H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1601-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Totally, about 500 nuclei were counted under different fields. The Picture was taken on an Olympus IX71 invert fluorescent microscope. In Vitro Kinase Assay—Ectopically expressed MstI were immunoprecipitated with glutathione beads. After extensive washing, the complex was employed in a kinase assay. The precipitated MstI were incubated with 2 μg of histone H2B or FOXO3 in 20 μl of kinase reaction buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5 with 10 mm MgCl2) containing 25 μm ATP and 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated by adding 7 μl of Laemmli's sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. A portion of the sample (15 μl) was separated on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel and autoradiographed or analyzed by PhosphorImage analyzer. Caspase-3 Activity Assay—Caspase-3 activity was measured by means of the CaspACE Assay System Fluorometric kit (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Cells were initially seeded at a density of 1 × 106 in 10-cm dishes, and transfected with various GST-tagged MstI constructs, followed by 35 μm VP16 treatment for 24 h, caspase-3 activity was measured by the cleavage of the fluorometric substrate Ac-DEVD-AMC according to the manufacturer's instructions. Subcellular Fractionation—Briefly, GST-MstI constructs transfected HEK293 cells (1 × 106 to 5 × 106/ml) were washed once with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and once with 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.9). Cells were lysed by suspending the cell pellet in 20 μl of lysis buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 for 10 min on ice. To isolate nuclei, the lysates were microcentrifuged for 5 min at 12,000 × g, and the nuclear pellet was washed with lysis buffer without Nonidet P-40. Nuclear proteins were obtained by resuspending the nuclear pellet in 20 μl of extraction buffer (420 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, pH 7.9) for 10 min at 4 °C. The nuclear suspension was microcentrifuged, the pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was diluted in dilution buffer (50 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, pH 7.9). Akt Phosphorylates MstI on Thr387—In exploring the sequence of MstI, we noticed that amino acids 120, RLRNKTL; 345, TVRVAST; 387, KRRDETM, correspond to a motif that is identified as a consensus Akt phosphorylation element present in numerous Akt substrates (Fig. 1A). We prepared GST-recombinant proteins from three fragments of MstI containing putative phosphorylation domains, and examined the ability to be phosphorylated by Akt through in vitro kinase assays. Fragment (amino acids 300-487) and positive control GSK-β were robustly phosphorylated by active Akt, as manifested by immunoblotting analysis with anti-phospho-Akt substrate antibody, which recognizes the consensus Akt phosphorylation elements R/KXR/KXX(S/T) present in numerous Akt substrates. By contrast, fragments 1-100 and 1-160 and GST alone were not phosphorylated (Fig. 1B, left panel). Similar results were also observed in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (data not shown). Mutation with T387A but not S345A abolished MstI phosphorylation by active Akt, suggesting that the Thr387 residue can be phosphorylated by Akt in vitro (Fig. 1C, upper panel), fitting with previous report that Thr387 is a phosphorylation site on MstI (11Glantschnig H. Rodan G.A. Reszka A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42987-42996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To explore whether MstI can be phosphorylated by Akt in intact cells, we transfected HEK293 cells with GST-tagged MstI and pretreated the cells with various inhibitors, followed by EGF stimulation. The transfected GST proteins were pulled down with glutathione beads and monitored by immunoblotting analysis with anti-phospho-Akt substrate antibody. EGF treatment triggered a potent phosphorylation in MstI, which was substantially decreased by PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 and Wortmannin but not PKC inhibitor GF109203X or MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 (Fig. 1D, top panel). Equal amounts of GST fusion proteins were precipitated (Fig. 1D, 2nd panel). Akt phosphorylation status tightly coupled to MstI phosphorylation (3rd panel). Immunoblotting with anti-phospho-MstI Thr387 antibody further confirmed that Akt phosphorylates MstI on Thr387 residue in intact cells (Fig. 1D, bottom panel) To ascertain that MstI is the physiological substrate of Akt, we transfected HEK293 cells with GST-MstI, and infected the transfected cells with adenovirus expressing plasma membrane localized active myristoylated Akt or sh-RNA of Akt. MstI was pulled down with glutathione beads. Immunoblotting analysis reveals that MstI was robustly phosphorylated by Myr-Akt, and its phosphorylation was completely blocked when Akt was depleted (Fig. 1E, top left panel). Mutation of Thr387 into alanine totally abolished MstI phosphorylation by membrane-localized active Akt (Fig. 1E, top right panel). Immunoblotting with anti-phospho-MstI Thr387 antibody verified these observations (Fig. 1E, bottom panels). Endogenous MstI exhibited the similar results (Fig. 1F). Thus, Akt phosphorylates MstI in vitro and in vivo. Akt Associates with MstI—Akt can exist in a stable complex with several of its substrate proteins (e.g. Mdm2, TSC2, EDG-1) and can also interact with many proteins that do not serve as Akt substrate, but rather seem to play a modulatory role in Akt regulation (21Brazil D.P. Park J. Hemmings B.A. Cell. 2002; 111: 293-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). To explore whether MstI binds to Akt, we transfected HA-Akt into HEK293 cells with GST-MstI construct, and pretreated the transfected cells with various pharmacological agents, followed by EGF for 10 min. GST-MstI proteins was pulled down with glutathione beads, and the associated proteins were analyzed with anti-HA antibody. MstI potently associated with Akt, and EGF treatment enhanced their binding. PI3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin or LY294002 pretreatment markedly attenuated the association. By contrast, PKC inhibitor GF109203X had no effect (Fig. 2A, top panel). Equal amounts of transfected GST-MstI and HA-Akt proteins and Akt phosphorylation status were verified (Fig. 2A, 2nd, 3rd, and bottom panels). As control, PKC kinase inhibitory effect by GF109203X was verified (Fig. 2A, 4th panel). To determine whether endogenous MstI binds to Akt in HEK293 cells, we conducted coimmunoprecipitation with anti-Akt antibody. Compared with control cells, EGF treatment stimulated robust interaction between MstI and Akt. PI3-kinase inhibitors pretreatment significantly decreased the binding; by contrast, PKC inhibitor exhibited negligible effect (Fig. 2B, top panel). Akt phosphorylation was robustly blocked by PI 3-kinase inhibitors (Fig. 2B, 2nd panel). As the control, PKC kinase inhibitory effect by GF109203X was verified (Fig. 2B, 3rd panel). Similar levels of total protein lysate were employed in all samples, and equal amounts of MstI was pulled-down (Fig. 2B, 4th, 5th, and bottom panels). Thus, activation of PI 3-kinase pathway is indispensable for the interaction between Akt and MstI. To further explore the interaction between Akt and MstI, we transfected HA-Akt into HEK293 cells with various GST-tagged MstI constructs. GST pull-down assay demonstrates that Akt robustly interacted with various MstI proteins except T387A, a mutant unable to be phosphorylated by Akt (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that MstI phosphorylation by Akt is essential for its association with Akt. Nevertheless, MstI phosphorylation on Thr183 or its kinase activity is not required for its interaction with Akt. To explore whether Akt kinase activity is also implicated in this event, we conducted coimmunoprecipitation studies with a variety of Akt constructs. MstI strongly bound to both wild-type and constitutively active Akt-CA (T308DS473D), but it failed to interact with kinase-dead Akt-KD (K179M) or phosphorylation mimetic Akt lacking kinase activity Akt-KD* (T308DS473DK179M) (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that Akt phosphorylation status is not imperative for its association with MstI; instead, its kinase activity is critical for this event. Mapping assay with a variety of MstI fragments reveals that the C terminus of MstI was strongly involved in binding to Akt (Fig. 2E). Therefore, Akt interacts with MstI, for which Akt kinase activity is indispensable. Akt Phosphorylation of MstI Prevents Its Proteolytic Cleavage and Blocks Apoptosis—MstI undergoes several proteolytic cleavage during apoptosis (10Lee K.K. Ohyama T. Yajima N. Tsubuki S. Yonehara S.

To examine whether Akt phosphorylation could suppress its degradation by caspases, we radiolabeled wild-type and T387A mutant MstI with [35S]methionine. After incubation with active Akt, the reaction mixture was introduced into active cell-free apoptotic solution, consisting of HEK293 cell cytosol supplemented with purified active caspase 3 (19Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4484) Google Scholar). Autoradiography shows that wild-type MstI was completely cleaved in active S-100, yielding 37- and 25-kDa fragments, which was completely blocked by caspase inhibitor (Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 4). Akt phosphorylation evidently reduced its proteolytic degradation, leading to a portion of full-length MstI remained intact. In contrast, MstI T387A mutant was actively cleaved irrespective of Akt treatment, as equal amounts of 37- and 25-kDa cleaved products presented in both samples (Fig. 3A, lanes 6 and 7), suggesting that Akt phosphorylation of MstI protects it from apoptotic degradation. The phosphorylation of MstI was verified by anti-phospho-MstI Thr387 antibody (data not shown). To compare whether different MstI mutants possess distinct apoptotic cleavage activities, we prepared numerous GST-MstI recombinant proteins and incubated with active cell-free apoptotic solution. Immunoblotting analysis reveals that T387A was completely degraded and T183E cleavage was faster than wild-type MstI. Nonetheless, T387E exhibited the slowest degradation rate, indicating that Akt phosphorylation protects it from caspase cleavage. These data suggest that Thr183 phosphorylation enhances MstI apoptotic cleavage, and blockade of MstI phosphorylation by Akt evidently facilitates its apoptotic cleavage (Fig. 3B). To investigate whether Akt phosphorylation of MstI protects it from proteolytic degradation in apoptotic cells, we transfected HEK293 cells with various MstI constructs and treated the transfected cells with VP16. Wild-type MstI and kinase-dead K59R mutant were actively cleaved upon VP16 treatment. Interestingly, T183A was evidently cut regardless of VP16 stimulation. Notably, T387E, which mimics Akt phosphorylation, somehow resisted against apoptotic cleavage compared with other constructs (Fig. 3C). Apoptotic assay with a fluorescent dye MR(DEVD)2, which turns red upon caspase-3 cleavage, showed that transfection of T387A alone initiated the most apoptosis, followed by T183E. However, kinase-dead MstI (K59R), wild-type MstI, and T183A displayed similar apoptotic activities. The lowest apoptosis occurs to Akt phosphorylation mimetic mutant T387E. VP16 treatment virtually displayed the similar apoptotic activity pattern with the most apoptosis in T387A cells and the least cell death in T387E (Fig. 3D, left panel). Caspase-3 activity assay revealed the parallel effects (Fig. 3D, right panel). Therefore, our data support that Akt phosphorylates MstI, protects MstI from apoptotic degradation and suppresses the programmed cell death. Akt Phosphorylation of MstI Inhibits Its Kinase Activity on FOXO3—Previous studies demonstrate that histone H2B and FOXO3 are the substrates of MstI (6Lehtinen M.K. Yuan Z. Boag P.R. Yang Y.

Histone H2BS14 is reported to be directly phosphorylated by MstI during apoptosis to trigger chromatin condensation (16Cheung W.L. Ajiro K. Samejima K. Kloc M. Cheung P. Mizzen C.A. Beeser A.

To explore the effect of Akt phosphorylation on MstI kinase activity, we conducted in vitro kinase assay with various MstI recombinant proteins using H2B as a substrate. As expected, both wild-type and MstI T183E mutant potently phosphorylated H2B, whereas MstI T183A exhibited a decreased activity. The kinase-dead MstI K59R failed to phosphorylate H2B. Surprisingly, MstI T387E, an Akt phosphorylation mimetic mutant, displayed the strongest kinase activity on H2B, while its unphosphorylated mutant T387A was unable to phosphorylate H2B (Fig. 4A). These results suggest that Akt phosphorylation of MstI enhances its kinase activity on H2B. However, when we performed MstI kinase assay with FOXO3 as a substrate, we found that MstI T183E exhibited a kinase activity much less than that of wild-type or T183A MstI. Interestingly, MstI T387A robustly phosphorylated FOXO3. By contrast, both MstI K59R and T387E failed to phosphorylate FOXO3 (Fig. 4B, left panel). MstI phosphorylates FOXO3 on Ser207 and triggers its nuclear translocation (6Lehtinen M.K. Yuan Z. Boag P.R. Yang Y. Villen J. Becker E.B. DiBacco S. de la Iglesia N. Gygi S. Blackwell T.K. Bonni A. Cell. 2006; 125: 987-1001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). To confirm the specificity of FOXO3 phosphorylation by MstI, we conducted MstI kinase assay with S207A FOXO3 recombinant protein as a substrate. None of MstI proteins was able to phosphorylate the mutant (Fig. 4B, right panel), verifying that Ser207 is the MstI phosphorylation site and our kinase assay for FOXO3 is specific. Quantitative analysis showed that MstI T387A and T387E mutants exhibited the completely opposite kinase activities on H2B and FOXO3. Interestingly, MstI T183A and T183E possessed inverse kinase activities on H2B and FOXO3 as well (Fig. 4C). To further examine the effect of H2B and FOXO3 phosphorylation by various MstI mutants, we performed immunoblotting analysis with MstI-transfected cells. Compared with the pronounced kinase activities by other MstI proteins, neither MstI T387A nor MstI K59R was able to trigger H2BS14 phosphorylation in the transfected cells (Fig. 4D, top panel), consistent with the in vitro kinase assay results. Interestingly, both wild-type MstI and T387A mutant strongly phosphorylated FOXO3, whereas MstI T387E and MstI K59R mutants failed to phosphorylate FOXO3 in the transfected cells, fitting with the in vitro findings. Similarly, MstI T187A displayed slightly higher kinase activity on FOXO3 than MstI T183E did (Fig. 4D, 2nd panel). As expected, we did not observe any phosphorylation on FOXO3 S207A mutant (Fig. 4E). To further confirm the notion that blocking Akt phosphorylation on MstI enhances its kinase activity on FOXO3, we treated HEK293 cells with various pharmacological inhibitors and monitored FOXO3 Ser207 and H2BS14 phosphorylation. EGF suppressed FOXO3 Ser207 phosphorylation, and inhibition of Akt activation by PI 3-kinase inhibitors lead to marked phosphorylation of FOXO3 Ser207. By contrast, the PKC inhibitor GF109203X had no effect. Nevertheless, H2BS14 phosphorylation was not affected by any of the above treatments (Fig. 4F). Thus, these data demonstrate that blockage of Akt activity strongly promotes MstI kinase activity on FOXO3, but it has no effect on H2B. To investigate whether MstI apoptotic cleavage is required for Akt-mediated mechanism, we employed MstI D326N and D330N mutants, which resist against proteolytic cleavage by caspases. Compared with potent Ser207 phosphorylation in FOXO3 by wild-type MstI, both MstI D326N and D330N mutants barely phosphorylated FOXO3. Ablation of endogenous Akt enhanced MstI kinase activity on FOXO3, which was substantially attenuated by overexpression of active Akt-CA. The apoptotic cleavage-resistant MstI mutants displayed negligible kinase activity on FOXO3 regardless of Akt (Fig. 4G, top panel). By contrast, H2BS14 was not obviously altered no matter which MstI construct was transfected, and Akt protein level had no significant affect either (Fig. 4G, 3rd panel). Hence, MstI apoptotic cleavage is required for Akt to exert its regulatory effect on MstI kinase activity to FOXO3 but not to H2B. Akt Phosphorylation Mimetic MstI T387E Prevents H2O2-triggered FOXO3 Nuclear Translocation—Upon oxidative stress, MstI phosphorylates FOXO3 on Ser207 and triggers its nuclear translocation and induces neuronal cell death (6Lehtinen M.K. Yuan Z. Boag P.R. Yang Y. Villen J. Becker E.B. DiBacco S. de la Iglesia N. Gygi S. Blackwell T.K. Bonni A. Cell. 2006; 125: 987-1001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). To explore the physiological consequence of Akt phosphorylation of MstI, we monitored FOXO3 nuclear translocation in cotransfected HEK293 cells in the presence or absence of H2O2 stimulation. In the absence of H2O2, a portion of FOXO3 (18%) resided in the nucleus when cotransfected with wild-type MstI and 74% of FOXO3 translocated into the nucleus in T183E-cotransfected cells. Interestingly, 88% of FOXO3 occurred in the nucleus when cotransfected with T387A. Negligible nuclear FOXO3 was found when cotransfected with T187A, T387E, or K59R. In response to H2O2 treatment, 78% FOXO3 distributed in the nucleus when cotransfected with wild-type MstI, and the ratios increased to 93 and 97% in T183E and T387A cotransfected cells. By contrast, ∼20% nuclear FOXO3 occurred when cotransfected with T387E or K59R. T183A evidently triggered FOXO3 phosphorylation, it also strongly provoked FOXO3 nuclear translocation upon H2O2 stimulation (Fig. 5, A and B). The quantitative analysis is summarized in Fig. 5C. Thus, these data demonstrate that Akt phosphorylation of MstI prevents FOXO3 nuclear translocation. Inhibition of MstI phosphorylation by Akt enhances FOXO3 nuclear residency. To further test the notion the blockage of MstI phosphorylation by Akt elicits FOXO3 nuclear residency, we transfected HEK293 cells with FOXO3, and infected the transfected cells with control adenovirus or virus expressing shRNA-Akt, followed by H2O2 stimulation. We monitored FOXO3 nuclear translocation by immunostaining. In the absence of H2O2, 11% of FOXO3 is in the control nucleus. Depletion of Akt enhanced the ratios to 38%. H2O2 stimulation triggered 79% FOXO3 nuclear translocation, which was further elevated to 98% when Akt was knocked down (Fig. 5D), underscoring that inhibition of MstI phosphorylation by depletion of Akt increased FOXO3 nuclear retention. These results are consistent with the observations in MstI T387A transfected cells. As an alternative approach to explore the effect of MstI phosphorylation by Akt on FOXO3 nuclear translocation, we conducted subcellular fractionation assay with various GST-MstI constructs transfected HEK293 cells. In the nuclear fraction, p-FOXO3 was markedly increased upon H2O2 treatment in most of GST-MstI construct-transfected cells except MstI T387E (Fig. 5E, top panel), an effect correlating with the quantitative nuclear translocation results. The minor ratio discrepancy between wild-type and T183A MstI in nuclear fractionation and microscopic examination might be due to the variation from the different analytical approaches. The purity of nuclear fraction was verified by immunoblotting with anti-tubulin and anti-PARP antibodies, respectively (Fig. 5E, middle and bottom panels). Thus, Akt phosphorylates MstI and inhibits its kinase activity on FOXO3, preventing FOXO3 nuclear translocation. In this study, we have demonstrated that MstI acts as a physiological substrate of Akt. Akt phosphorylation of MstI protects MstI from apoptotic cleavage. Interestingly, this phosphorylation substantially enhances its in vitro kinase activity to H2B and completely abolishes its kinase activity to FOXO3. Moreover, we provide compelling evidence that Akt mediates MstI kinase activity on FOXO3 Ser207 but not on H2BS14 in intact cells. Thus, these data support that MstI possesses distinct effects on FOXO3 and histone H2B, although both nuclear proteins are implicated in apoptosis. David Allis and co-workers (16Cheung W.L. Ajiro K. Samejima K. Kloc M. Cheung P. Mizzen C.A. Beeser A. Etkin L.D. Chernoff J. Earnshaw W.C. Allis C.D. Cell. 2003; 113: 507-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) show that MstI can phosphorylate H2B at Ser14 in vitro and in vivo, and the onset of H2BS14 phosphorylation is dependent upon cleavage of MstI by caspase-3. Moreover, H2BS14 phosphorylation correlates with apoptotic chromatin condensation, indicating that MstI phosphorylates H2BS14 and promotes apoptotic chromatin condensation. Surprisingly, MstI T387E, an Akt phosphorylation mimetic mutant, exhibits the strongest kinase activity on H2B, a nonspecific universal substrate for in vitro kinase assay. However, T387A fails to phosphorylate H2B, acting exactly as kinase-dead K59R in vitro and in transfected cells (Fig. 4, A and D). This observation suggests that MstI Thr387 phosphorylation by Akt is necessary for the phosphorylation of H2BS14. If H2B is a physiological substrate of MstI as claimed by Allis group, then Akt phosphorylation of MstI should decrease its kinase activity on H2BS14 to repress apoptosis, which is completely opposite to our results in Fig. 4, A and D. Hence, our finding does not support the previous report that MstI is a physiological kinase for H2B. Our discovery is supported by a recent report that H2BS14 phosphorylation is almost negligible in PKC-δ-deficient B cells compared with wild-type cells and PKC-δ but not MstI might be responsible for H2BS14 phosphorylation in apoptotic cells (22Blois J.T. Mataraza J.M. Mecklenbrauker I. Tarakhovsky A. Chiles T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30123-30132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Conceivably, MstI might regulate PKC-δ kinase activity on H2BS14 phosphorylation during apoptosis. On the other hand, we observed marked FOXO3 Ser207 phosphorylation in vitro and in transfected cells by T387A but not T387E, indicating that MstI phosphorylation by Akt blocks its kinase activity on FOXO3. This finding fits perfectly with the current paradigm that Akt promotes cell survival by phosphorylating and inhibiting pro-apoptotic proteins. Akt phosphorylates FOXO3 and elicits its cytoplasmic translocation and association with 14-3-3, preventing its transcriptional activity (2Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5454) Google Scholar). Recently, MstI has been reported to act oppositely. Oxidative stress triggers MstI to phosphorylate FOXO3 and promotes its nuclear translocation and dissociates from 14-3-3, enhancing neuronal apoptosis (6Lehtinen M.K. Yuan Z. Boag P.R. Yang Y. Villen J. Becker E.B. DiBacco S. de la Iglesia N. Gygi S. Blackwell T.K. Bonni A. Cell. 2006; 125: 987-1001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Here, we show that Akt physically associates with MstI and phosphorylates it and abolishes its kinase activity on FOXO3, resulting in FOXO3 cytoplasmic retention (Fig. 5). Further, we show that T387A, a nonphosphorylated MstI mutant, possesses robust kinase activity on FOXO3 and elicits its nuclear distribution even in the absence of oxidative stress. Both gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments support that Akt mediates FOXO3 nuclear export not only through direct modification of FOXO3 by Akt but also through phosphorylation of MstI to block its stimulatory effect on FOXO3 nuclear translocation. Accumulative evidence supports that Akt suppresses apoptosis through phosphorylating and inhibiting pro-apoptotic effectors including Bad (23Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3543-3554Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) etc. Here, we provide more evidence that Akt promotes cell survival by phosphorylating and inhibiting the apoptotic kinase MstI. MstI acting as an apoptotic kinase requires both caspase cleavage and phosphorylation (11Glantschnig H. Rodan G.A. Reszka A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42987-42996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 27de Souza P.M. Lindsay M.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 485-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Interestingly, MstI may function both upstream and downstream of caspases, because exogenously expressed MstI activates caspases, which results in its own cleavage (13Graves J.D. Gotoh Y. Draves K.E. Ambrose D. Han D.K. Wright M. Chernoff J. Clark E.A. Krebs E.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2224-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In the current study, we show that Akt phosphorylates MstI and protects it from apoptotic process (Fig. 3). Although Akt directly binds MstI, which might shield MstI from proteolytic attack; however, we show that T387E, a phosphorylation mimetic mutant, resists against caspase-mediated cleavage, whereas T387A, a nonphosphorylated mutant, displays the fastest degradation effect. These results support that Akt protects MstI through phosphorylation on Thr387 residue. Recently, it has been report that MstI and RanBP2 levels are elevated in transgenic animals that express a constitutively active p110-α subunit in the epithelial cells of the prostate. Additionally, Akt phosphorylation, MstI and RanBP2 protein levels, can be inhibited in transgenic animals by LY294002 (28Renner, O., Fominaya, J., Alonso, S., Blanco-Aparicio, C., Leal, J. F., and Carnero, A. (2007) Carcinogenesis, 28, 1418-1425Google Scholar). This finding is consistent with our conclusion that Akt phosphorylation of MstI protects it from apoptotic degradation. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that MstI is a physiological substrate of Akt. In addition to direct phosphorylation of FOXOs, Akt exerts its anti-apoptotic action on FOXOs by phosphorylation of MstI and blockage of its kinase activity. We thank Dr. Alfred Reszka at Merck Research Laboratories, West Point, PA for providing various MstI plasmids."

The N-terminal cysteine of TIMP-1 plays a key role in the inhibitory activity of the protein because it coordinates the essential catalytic Zn2+ of the MMP, preventing the metal ion from functioning. An important mechanism for controlling the interaction of TIMPs with MMPs might involve hypochlorous acid (HOCl), a potent oxidant produced by the myeloperoxidase (MPO) system of phagocytes. Here, we show that HOCl generated by the MPO-H2O2-chloride system inactivates TIMP-1 by oxidizing its N-terminal cysteine. The product is a novel 2-oxo acid. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry analyses demonstrated that methionine and N-terminal cysteine residues were rapidly oxidized by MPO-derived HOCl but only oxidation of the N-terminal cysteine of TIMP-1 correlated well with loss of inhibitory activity. Importantly, we detected the signature 2-oxo-acid N-terminal peptide in tryptic digests of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, demonstrating that TIMP-1 oxidation occurs in vivo. Loss of the N-terminal amino group and disulfide structure are crucial for preventing TIMP-1 from inhibiting MMPs.

Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H. Bode W. Nature. 1997; 389: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Moreover, the N-terminal α-amino and carbonyl groups of the Cys1 residue coordinate the essential catalytic Zn2+ of the metalloproteinase. Importantly, all TIMPs have a conserved N-terminal sequence, CT/SCXPXHPQ, that contains Cys1 (3Brew K. Kim D. Nagase H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 267-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that Cys1 plays a key role in inhibiting MMP activity.Although the structure and inhibitory mechanism of TIMP-1 have been investigated intensively, less is known about the regulation of its inhibitory activity. Neutrophil elastase and Porphyromonas gingivalis (a bacterium involved in periodontal disease) inactivate TIMP-1 by proteolytic degradation in vitro (16Itoh Y. Kim H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16518-16521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 17Grenier D. Kim D. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 203: 161-164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). High concentrations of reagent hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and peroxynitrite also inactivate TIMP-1 in vitro (18Shabani F. Kim J. Tippett L. Free Radic.

MPO converts hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), another phagocyte product, to HOCl under physiological concentrations of Cl– (20Harrison J.E. Kim J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1371-1374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as shown in the equation Cl– + H2O2 + H+ → HOCl + H2O. HOCl is a potent antimicrobial oxidant that plays an important role in host defense (21Gaut J.P. Kim G.C. Tran H.D. Byun J. Henderson J.P. Richter G.M. Brennan M.L. Lusis A.J. Belaaouaj A.

Toxicology. 2002; 181–182: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar).In the current studies, we determined whether oxidants derived from phagocytes impair the ability of TIMP-1 to regulate MMP. We demonstrated that HOCl generated by MPO, but not H2O2 alone, oxidizes Cys1 and Met residues of TIMP-1. Loss of TIMP-1 inhibitory activity strongly correlated with Cys1 oxidation and the formation of a novel 2-oxo acid product. Furthermore, we identified this novel oxidation product in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Our observations suggest an in vivo oxidative molecular mechanism by which MPO can prevent TIMP-1 from inhibiting MMPs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsSodium hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), trifluoroacetic acid, and HPLC-grade acetonitrile (CH3CN) were obtained from Fisher Scientific. Human matrilysin (MMP-7) and pro-gelatinase B (pro-MMP-9) were obtained from Calbiochem. Unless otherwise indicated, all other materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. MPO was isolated by lectin affinity and size exclusion chromatographies from human neutrophils (25Heinecke J.W. Kim W. Daehnke H.L. III Goldstein J.A. J. Biol.

Purified enzyme had an A430/A280 ratio of 0.8 and was apparently homogeneous on SDS-PAGE analysis. Its concentration was determined spectrophotometrically (ε430 = 0.17 m–1 cm–1) (27Morita Y. Kim H. Aibara S. Kobayashi T. Hasegawa E. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 99: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).METHODSPreparation of Disulfides of N-terminal Peptide—Peptide (AcC)CT(AcC)CVPPH was synthesized by incubating 500 μm CTCVPPH (GenScript Corp., Piscataway, NJ) with 5 mm N-acetyl-l-cysteine and 2.5 mm H2O2 at 37 °C for 120 min in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 10 mm sodium phosphate, 138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.4). It was then isolated by reverse-phase HPLC. Modification of cysteine residues was confirmed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis.Oxidation Reactions—Reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 60 min in PBS supplemented with 1 μm human TIMP-1 (Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA) or 20 μm (AcC)CT(AcC)CVPPH and 50 nm MPO. Reactions were initiated by adding oxidant and terminated by adding methionine (10:1, mol/mol, methionine/oxidant). The concentration of H2O2 was determined spectrophotometrically (ε240 = 39.4 m–1 cm–1) (28Nelson D.P. Kim L.A. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 49: 474-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar).Proteolytic Digestion of Proteins—Native or oxidized TIMP-1 was reduced with 4 mm dithiothreitol at 70–80 °C in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate and 10% acetonitrile for 20 min. The reduced protein was alkylated with 10 mm iodoacetamide at room temperature for 15 min. Alkylated protein was digested overnight at 37 °C with sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) at a ratio of 25:1 (w/w) protein/trypsin or endoproteinase Glu-C (Roche Applied Science) at a ratio of 20:1 (w/w) protein/Glu-C. Digestion was halted by acidification (pH 2–3) with 10% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid.BAL Fluid—All human studies were approved by the Human Studies Committee of the University of Washington. BAL was performed on patients with ARDS and normal control subjects as described (29Matute-Bello G. Kim W.C. Radella F. II Steinberg Ruzinski K.P. Jonas J.T. M. Chi Hudson E.Y. Martin L.D. T. R. Am.

The six most abundant proteins (albumin, IgG, IgA, transferrin, haptoglobin, and antitrypsin) in the BAL sample were depleted using a multiple affinity removal spin cartridge (Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, DE). All depletion procedures were performed at room temperature according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The flow-through fraction was separated on a macroporous reverse-phase C18 (mRP-C18) high recovery protein column (Agilent Technologies) using an Agilent 1100 HPLC system. The fraction containing TIMP-1 was reduced, alkylated, and digested overnight at 37 °C with sequencing grade modified trypsin. Tryptic peptides were concentrated and desalted with 3 m Empore High Performance C18HD extraction disk cartridges according to the manufacturer’s protocol, dried under vacuum, and resuspended in 0.1% formic acid and 5% acetonitrile.LC-Electrospray Ionization-MS Analysis—LC-MS analyses of synthetic peptides were performed in the positive ion mode with a Finnigan Mat LCQ ion trap instrument (San Jose, CA) coupled to a Waters 2690 HPLC system (Milford, MA). Peptides were separated at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min on a reverse-phase column (Vydac C18 MS column; 250 × 2.1 mm), using solvent A (0.2% formic acid in water) and solvent B (0.2% formic acid in 90% CH3CN, 10% water). Peptides were eluted using a linear gradient of 0–40% solvent B over 30 min. The spray voltage was 4.5 kV, and the temperature of the heated capillary was 220 °C. The collision energy for MS/MS was 35%.Micro-LC-MS analyses of proteolytic peptides of TIMP-1 were performed in the positive ion mode with a Finnigan LCQ Deca XP ion trap instrument (Thermo Electron Corp., San Jose, CA) coupled to a Surveyor HPLC system. Peptides were separated at a flow rate of 2 μl/min on a BioBasic-18 MS column (100 × 0.18 mm; Thermo Hypersil-Keystone, Bellefonte, PA) using solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water) and solvent B (0.1% formic acid in CH3CN). Peptides were eluted using a linear gradient of 5–35% solvent B over 90 min. The spray voltage was 3.5 kV, and the temperature of the heated capillary was 170 °C. The collision energy for MS/MS was 35%.Nano-LC-MS analyses of tryptic peptides of BAL samples were performed in the positive ion mode with a Finnigan LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron Corp.) coupled to a Paradigm MS4 LC system (Michrom BioResources, Inc.). Peptides were separated at a flow rate of 1.0 μl/min on a Magic C18 AQ column (150 × 0.15 mm, 5 μm 200 Å; Michrom BioResources, Inc.) using solvent A (0.1% formic acid, 5% CH3CN in water) and solvent B (0.1% formic acid in 90% CH3CN). Peptides were eluted using a linear gradient of 5–35% solvent B over 180 min. The spray voltage was 1.8 kV, and the temperature of the heated capillary was 200 °C. The collision energy for MS/MS was 35%.Reverse Zymography—Reverse zymography of TIMP-1 was performed by electrophoresis on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel copolymerized with 0.8 mg/ml gelatin and 160 ng/ml human recombinant MMP-9 (proenzyme) (30Kobayashi T. Methods Mol. Biol. 2005; 289: 201-208PubMed Google Scholar). Gels were washed with 2.5% Triton X-100 and then incubated in enzyme assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.02% brij-35 (w/v)) for 36 h. After the TIMP-1 band was stained with Simply Blue™ Safestain and destained with water, it was visualized against the clear background of the gel. The inhibitory activity of TIMP-1 was determined by scanning the bands with a densitometer.Determination of TIMP-1 Inhibitory Activity—0.4 μm native and oxidized TIMP-1 was incubated for 60 min at 37 °C with MMP-7 at a molar ratio of 2:1 (TIMP-1:MMP-7) in assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.02% NaN3, 0.05% Brij35 (w/v)). The proteolytic activity of MMP-7 was assayed for 20 min at 37 °C, using the fluorescent synthetic peptide (7-methoxycoumarin-4-acetyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-β-(2,4-dinitrophenylamino)-Ala-Ala-Arg-NH2, Mca peptide) as substrate (31Knight C.G. Kim F. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 32Fu X. Kim S.Y. Parks W.C. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41279-41287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). 4 μl of the incubated mixture (∼15 ng of MMP-7) was added to individual wells of a 96-well microtiter plate containing 200 μl of assay buffer and 2 μm Mca peptide. Fluorescence (λex 328 nm, λem 392 nm) was monitored using a microplate reader (SPECTRAmax GEMINI XS, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) when enzyme activity was a linear function of enzyme concentration.RESULTSMPO Inactivates TIMP-1—To determine whether HOCl can restrain the MMP inhibitory activity of TIMP-1, we exposed the protein to the MPO-H2O2-chloride system. Human TIMP-1 (1 μm) was incubated in PBS (141 mm chloride, pH 7.4) with increasing concentrations of H2O2 in the presence of the complete MPO system or with H2O2 alone. The ability of TIMP-1 to inhibit gelatinase B (MMP-9) was then determined by reverse zymography (Fig. 1). The complete MPO-H2O2-Cl system dramatically decreased the inhibitory activity of TIMP-1. Band density analysis demonstrated that 78 or 94% of the inhibitory activity of TIMP-1 was lost when either 20 μm or 50 μm H2O2 was included in the complete MPO system. In contrast, twice the concentration (100 μm) of H2O2 alone had no effect. We observed similar results when TIMP-1 was exposed to HOCl (data not shown). These observations strongly suggest that HOCl produced by MPO can inactivate TIMP-1.MPO Oxidizes Specific Residues in TIMP-1—To investigate the molecular basis for the oxidative inactivation of TIMP-1, we first digested unmodified protein with trypsin and identified the resulting peptides through LC-MS and MS/MS analysis. We detected all the cysteine-containing peptides (Table 1, P1–P7), which account for the disulfide structure of TIMP-1 and also contain the most important residues for its inhibitory activity (33Pattison D.I. Kim M.J. Chem. Res.

Interestingly, two tryptic peptides, P1 (C1TC3VPPHPQTAFC13NSDLVIR) and P2 (FVYTPAM66ESVC70GYFHR), were selectively oxidized. Quantification revealed dramatic loss of both peptides (Figs. 2A and 3A), with a decline of ion intensity of 50% for P1 and of almost 100% for P2. In contrast, H2O2 alone oxidized neither P1 nor P2 (Figs. 2A and 3A). These findings suggest that the MPO-H2O2-chloride system selectively oxidizes P1 and P2. Importantly, these peptides contain Cys1 and Cys70, which form the disulfide bond that is critical to the inhibitory activity of TIMP-1 (15Gomis-Ruth F.X. Kim K. Betz M. Bergner A. Huber R. Suzuki K.

Therefore, we used LC-MS and MS/MS to analyze P1 and its oxidation product(s) in tryptic digests of native or oxidized TIMP-1. Unmodified P1 showed major ions of mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) 791.8 and 1186.9, which is consistent with the anticipated m/z of the triply and doubly charged peptide ions [M + 3H]3+ and [M + 2H]2+. MS/MS analysis of the peptide ion of m/z 791.8 confirmed the sequence of P1 from the digest of unmodified TIMP-1 (Fig. 2, A2). Reconstructed ion chromatograms revealed that the relative abundance of this peptide decreased significantly after TIMP-1 was exposed to the complete MPO-H2O2-chloride system (Fig. 2A). Unexpectedly, we failed to detect any known product(s) (e.g. Cys + 16, Cys + 32, Cys + 48) (32Fu X. Kim S.Y. Parks W.C. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41279-41287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 34Fu X. Kim D.M. Heinecke J.W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1293-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) that would be anticipated if cysteine residues or disulfide bonds were oxygenated.These observations suggested that HOCl might convert P1 to unusual products. Indeed, LC-MS/MS detected a new peak of material with m/z 1142.7 (Fig. 2B). MS/MS analysis of this ion revealed a series of fragment ions with the same m/z as y-type ions from MS/MS analysis of P1 (y16+, y16+2, y14+2, y12, y14, y5, y4, etc.). Thus, the new peak of material was derived from P1. The isotopic pattern demonstrated that the ion was doubly charged, suggesting that the precursor peptide had lost 88 atomic mass units when it formed the product peptide (Fig. 2, B1). We therefore named this product P1–88. MS/MS analysis of P1–88 revealed a series of y-type ions and a prominent ion of m/z 1120.9, which is consistent with loss of 44 atomic mass units from the doubly charged precursor ion ([M – 44 + 2H]2+) (Fig. 2, B2). Detection of the fragment ion y19+2 (Fig. 2, B2, m/z 1106.4) located the modification on the N-terminal cysteine residue. This observation indicates that Cys1 is modified to Cys1-88 in P1–88 and raises the possibility that generation of P1–88 contributes to TIMP-1 inactivation.MPO Oxidizes the Met Residue in P2 to Methionine Sulfoxide—The methionine residue, disulfide bond, and 2 tyrosine residues in P2 are potential targets of oxidation. To identify the site at which HOCl modifies P2, we exposed TIMP-1 in PBS to H2O2 (1:20, molar/molar, protein/oxidant) and MPO and used reconstructed ion chromatograms to detect the product. The results revealed that P2 precursor disappeared in the tryptic digest of oxidized TIMP-1, and a new peak of material was observed (Fig. 3, A and B). LC-MS analysis of this material demonstrated a major ion at m/z 661.3 (Fig. 3, B1), which is consistent with the addition of 16 atomic mass units to triply charged P2 ([M + 16 + 3H]3+). MS/MS analysis of the modified peptide indicated that the methionine residue (Met66) of P2 had gained 16 atomic mass units (Fig. 3, B2), whereas the 2 tyrosine residues and 1 cysteine residue remained unmodified. These observations demonstrate that HOCl generated by the MPO-H2O2-chloride system readily converts the thioether group of Met66 in P2 to the sulfoxide.To determine whether the MPOH2O2-chloride system also oxidizes other methionine residues in TIMP-1, we digested TIMP-1 with endoproteinase Glu-C, which cleaves peptide bonds C-terminal of glutamic acid when the reaction is performed in ammonium bicarbonate buffer (35Drapeau G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 189-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). We detected a peptide containing all 3 methionine residues (IKM42TKM45YKGFQALGDAADIRFVYTPAM66E). LC-MS and MS/MS analysis of oxidized TIMP-1 revealed that all 3 methionine residues (Met42, Met45, and Met66) had gained 16 atomic mass units when the protein was exposed to a 10:1 mole ratio of oxidant: TIMP-1 (data not shown). These results suggest that HOCl generated by the MPO-H2O2-chloride system readily converts all 3 methionine residues in TIMP-1 to methionine sulfoxide.Loss of TIMP-1 Activity Strongly Associates with Loss of N-Terminal Peptide and Formation of Cys1-88—To determine quantitatively whether oxidation of specific amino acid residues in P1 or P2 correlates with loss of TIMP-1 activity, we first incubated 1 μm human TIMP-1 with increasing concentrations of H2O2 in the complete MPO system or with H2O2 alone in PBS. We then monitored the influence of control and oxidized TIMP-1 on MMP-7 activity using the fluorescent Mca peptide substrate. P2 disappeared completely from the tryptic digest of TIMP-1 that had been exposed to the MPOH2O2-chloride system at low molar ratios of oxidant to protein (Fig. 4A). However, there was little correlation between P2 loss and the inhibitory activity of the protein (Fig. 4B). In contrast, as the mole ratio of oxidant to TIMP-1 increased from 0 to 50, both the relative intensity of the precursor peptide P1 and the inhibitory ability of TIMP-1 decreased to a similar extent (Fig. 4B). Thus, loss of P1 associated with loss of inhibitory activity.FIGURE 4Loss of TIMP-1 inhibitory activity associates with oxidative modification of Cys1. TIMP-1 (1 μm) was exposed to the MPO-H2O2-chloride system at the indicated molar ratio of oxidant/protein for 60 min at 37 °C in PBS (pH 7.4). The reaction was initiated by adding oxidant and terminated by adding methionine. The inhibitory activity of TIMP-1 was assessed by monitoring the rates of MMP-7 hydrolysis of Mca peptide. Precursor and product peptides were detected and quantified by LC-electrospray ionization-MS analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)P1 contains the Cys1 residue that is essential for the inhibitory activity of TIMP-1. To further study whether modifying the N-terminal cysteine might account for the loss of TIMP-1 inhibitory function, we examined the relationship between the latter and Cys1-88 formation. The yield of Cys1-88 correlated strongly with the loss of TIMP-1 inhibitory activity (R2 = 0.95) (Fig. 4D). In contrast, the production of P2 containing methionine sulfoxide showed little association with the inhibitory activity of TIMP-1.T"
https://openalex.org/W2088863563,"There is much uncertainty as to whether plants use arogenate, phenylpyruvate, or both as obligatory intermediates in Phe biosynthesis, an essential dietary amino acid for humans. This is because both prephenate and arogenate have been reported to undergo decarboxylative dehydration in plants via the action of either arogenate (ADT) or prephenate (PDT) dehydratases; however, neither enzyme(s) nor encoding gene(s) have been isolated and/or functionally characterized. An in silico data mining approach was thus undertaken to attempt to identify the dehydratase(s) involved in Phe formation in Arabidopsis, based on sequence similarity of PDT-like and ACT-like domains in bacteria. This data mining approach suggested that there are six PDT-like homologues in Arabidopsis, whose phylogenetic analyses separated them into three distinct subgroups. All six genes were cloned and subsequently established to be expressed in all tissues examined. Each was then expressed as a Nus fusion recombinant protein in Escherichia coli, with their substrate specificities measured in vitro. Three of the resulting recombinant proteins, encoded by ADT1 (At1g11790), ADT2 (At3g07630), and ADT6 (At1g08250), more efficiently utilized arogenate than prephenate, whereas the remaining three, ADT3 (At2g27820), ADT4 (At3g44720), and ADT5 (At5g22630) essentially only employed arogenate. ADT1, ADT2, and ADT6 had kcat/Km values of 1050, 7650, and 1560 m-1 s-1 for arogenate versus 38, 240, and 16 m-1 s-1 for prephenate, respectively. By contrast, the remaining three, ADT3, ADT4, and ADT5, had kcat/Km values of 1140, 490, and 620 m-1 s-1, with prephenate not serving as a substrate unless excess recombinant protein (>150 μg/assay) was used. All six genes, and their corresponding proteins, are thus provisionally classified as arogenate dehydratases and designated ADT1–ADT6. There is much uncertainty as to whether plants use arogenate, phenylpyruvate, or both as obligatory intermediates in Phe biosynthesis, an essential dietary amino acid for humans.

By contrast, the remaining three, ADT3, ADT4, and ADT5, had kcat/Km values of 1140, 490, and 620 m-1 s-1, with prephenate not serving as a substrate unless excess recombinant protein (>150 μg/assay) was used. All six genes, and their corresponding proteins, are thus provisionally classified as arogenate dehydratases and designated ADT1–ADT6. The aromatic amino acid Phe, formed in both plants and microorganisms, serves as a building block for proteins and as a pathway intermediate to a wide range of aromatic compounds. For mammals, Phe is also an essential dietary requirement. In vascular plants, some of the physiologically important secondary metabolites derived from Phe include pigments and defense molecules (e.g. flavonoids, proanthocyanidins, oligomeric lignans, cyanidins, etc.) (1Griesbach R.J.

(2008) in Lignocellulose Recalcitrance (Himmel, M., ed) Blackwell, LondonGoogle Scholar). Taken together, the metabolism of Phe in planta can account for up to 30–40% of organic carbon depending upon the species (9van Heerden P.S. Towers G.H.N. Lewis N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12350-12355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In principle, prephenate (from the shikimate-chorismate pathway (10Herrmann K.M.

With microbes, two different enzymes, prephenate dehydratase (PDT) 2The abbreviations used are: PDT, prephenate dehydratase; ADT, arogenate dehydratase; CDT, cyclohexadienyl dehydratase; PITC, phenylisothiocyanate; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; RT, reverse transcriptase. and arogenate dehydratase (ADT), are able to catalyze the dehydration/decarboxylation reactions of prephenate and arogenate to afford phenylpyruvate and Phe, respectively. Moreover, whereas most known microorganisms contain PDTs (13Fischer R.S. Bonner C.A. Boone D.R. Jensen R.A. Arch. Microbiol. 1993; 160: 440-446Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 14Berry A. Ahmad S.

Byng G.S. Gherna R.L. Jensen R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 147: 526-534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A third class of enzyme, cyclohexadienyl dehydratase (CDT), common in enteric bacteria, can also either utilize prephenate or arogenate as a substrate (17Xia T. Ahmad S. Zhao G. Jensen R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 286: 461-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 18Zhao G. Xia T. Fischer R.S. Jensen R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2487-2493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, some microorganisms contain dual function “P-proteins” with a N-terminal chorismate mutase domain followed by a PDT domain (19Zhang S. Pohnert G. Kongsaeree P. Wilson D.B. Clardy J. Ganem B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6248-6253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Microbial PDTs are often allosterically regulated by binding of pathway end products (19Zhang S. Pohnert G. Kongsaeree P. Wilson D.B. Clardy J. Ganem B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6248-6253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), this being envisaged to occur through a C-terminal ACT domain (name derived from aspartokinase, chorismate mutase and TyrA), whereas CDTs are not (18Zhao G. Xia T. Fischer R.S. Jensen R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2487-2493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The P-proteins also contain a C-terminal ACT domain that has been shown to bind Phe (19Zhang S. Pohnert G. Kongsaeree P. Wilson D.B. Clardy J. Ganem B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6248-6253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). As a result of these different enzyme types, some bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, can use both routes to Phe (20Patel N. Pierson D.L. Jensen R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5839-5846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas others, such as Escherichia coli, only utilize phenylpyruvate (21Byng G.S. Whitaker R.J. Jensen R.A. Arch. Microbiol. 1983; 136: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Accordingly vascular plants might be anticipated to employ either one or both of these pathways for Phe biosynthesis. Indeed, in the mid-1980s, two research groups reported ADT activities using partially purified enzyme preparations from Nicotiana silvestris cell cultures and spinach (Spinacia oleracea) chloroplasts (22Jung E. Zamir L.O. Jensen R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7231-7235Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), as well as from etiolated seedlings of Sorghum bicolor (23Siehl D.L. Conn E.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 260: 822-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Since then, arogenate has been provisionally considered as an intermediate in Phe biosynthesis in plants (7Lewis, N. G., Davin, L. B., and Sarkanen, S. (1999) in Comprehensive Natural Products Chemistry (Barton, Sir D. H. R., Nakanishi, K., and Meth-Cohn, O., eds) Vol. 3, 617-745 Elsevier, OxfordGoogle Scholar, 9van Heerden P.S. Towers G.H.N.

Mattheus N. Aeschliman D.S. Li E. Hamberger B. Cullis I.F. Zhuang J. Kaneda M. Mansfield S.D. Samuels L. Ritland K. Ellis B.E. Bohlmann J. Douglas C.J. Plant J. 2005; 42: 618-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, a prephenate aminotransferase activity was described in some plant species, such as N. silvestris (28Bonner C.A. Jensen R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 238: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and etiolated shoots of S. bicolor (29Siehl D.L. Connelly J.A. Conn E.E. Z. Naturforsch. 1986; 41C: 79-86Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It has not, however, been possible to detect arogenate in the study of various extracts from a number of vascular plants (26Razal R.A. Lewis N.G. Towers G.H.N. Phytochem. Anal. 1994; 5: 98-104Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar) under the conditions employed, indicating that it must be present (at best) at very low levels. This, however, is quite frequently observed in primary metabolism. Attempts to establish the presence of PDT activity in higher plants, by comparison, have either been inconclusive (30Cotton R.G.H. Gibson F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 156: 187-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) (in pea) or unsuccessful (22Jung E. Zamir L.O. Jensen R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7231-7235Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) (using both N. silvestris and spinach). Yet a recent report indicated that Phe nevertheless results from the activity of PDTs in Arabidopsis (31Warpeha K.M. Lateef S.S. Lapik Y. Anderson M. Lee B.S. Kaufman L.S. Plant Physiol. 2006; 140: 844-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus it remains unclear in the literature whether Phe results from ADT and/or PDT conversions in plants, and it has become essential to biochemically characterize the corresponding dehydratases involved. In The Arabidopsis Information Resource data base, there are six Arabidopsis genes (At1g11790, At3g07630, At2g27820, At3g44720, At5g22630, and At1g08250), putatively annotated as PDT homologues. This annotation is based solely on sequence comparison (and thus a reliance on existing annotations) of bacterial sequences. However, because there is no existing functional linkage between any ADT enzyme activity and the corresponding gene sequence, none are annotated as being arogenate dehydratase-like. Yet recently, Ehlting et al. (27Ehlting J. Mattheus N. Aeschliman D.S. Li E. Hamberger B. Cullis I.F. Zhuang J. Kaneda M. Mansfield S.D. Samuels L. Ritland K. Ellis B.E. Bohlmann J. Douglas C.J. Plant J. 2005; 42: 618-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) assigned ADT labels (ADT1–ADT6, respectively) to all six Arabidopsis PDT-like genes, but also without any functional characterization in support of this nomenclature. To investigate whether any of these genes encode functional ADTs, their coding sequences were cloned with the corresponding functional recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli. Although all six displayed ADT activity, only ADT1, ADT2, and ADT6 showed any level of PDT activity, albeit at much lower levels related to ADT. This study describes the biochemical parameters obtained for each recombinant protein and provides the first functional characterization of ADTs, the phenylalanineforming machinery, in Arabidopsis. Instrumentation—HPLC analyses employed an Alliance 2695 HPLC system (Waters, Milford, MA) equipped with either a NovaPak C18 column (150 × 3.9 mm; Waters), or a Pico-Tag column (300 × 3.9 mm; Waters). Protein purification was carried out on a fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) system. Materials—Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and reagents for making buffers were bought from Sigma; phenylisothiocyanate was from Pierce. PD-10 and DEAE-Sepharose were purchased from GE Healthcare, with POROS MC 20 obtained from Applied Biosystems and Dowex 21K Cl- and AG1-X8 Cl- from Bio-Rad. The expression vector, pET43.1 Ek/LIC, the Rosetta™ (DE3) E. coli cells and BugBuster protein extraction reagent were purchased from Novagen. SuperScript™ II reverse transcriptase, BL21 Star™ (DE3) E. coli cells, and TRIzol reagent were procured from Invitrogen, whereas rDNase I (DNA-free) was from Ambion and Fast RNA Pro-Green Kit from QBioGene. PicoTag reversed phase column (150 × 3.9 mm inner diameter) and PicoTag sample diluent were purchased from Waters (Milford, MA). Prephenate (∼78% purity) was obtained from Sigma and purified (>95% purity) using a Chromabond C18 cartridge (Macherey-Nagel) eluted with HPLC grade water. Crude arogenate was isolated from Neurospora crassa (75001/5212/C-167) cultures as described in Ref. 32Jensen R.A. Zamir L. St Pierre M. Patel N. Pierson D.L. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 132: 896-903Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, then purified (33Zamir L.O. Jensen R.A. Arison B.H. Douglas A.W. Albers-Schönberg G. Bowen J.R. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 4499-4504Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar), lyophilized, and stored at -80 °C until needed. Cloning of Arabidopsis ADT/PDT—Clones U16103 (for At1g11790) and U11052 (for Atg07630) were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Research Center, with the open reading frames of each gene individually amplified and subcloned into the expression vector, pET43.1 Ek/LIC, which was designed for cloning and high level expression of peptide sequences fused with the Nus·Tag™ protein. Primers used for subcloning were 5′-GACGACGACAAGATGGCTCTGAGGTGT-3′ and 5′-GAGGAGAAGCCCGGTTTATCTGACTAGATC-3′ for At1g11790 and 5′-GACGACGACAAGATGGCAATGCACACTGTTCGA-3′ and 5′-GAGGAGAAGCCCGGTTTAGAGCATTGTAGTGTC-3′ for At3g07630, respectively. The remaining ADTs/PDTs (At2g27820, At3g44720, At5g22630, and At1g08250) were individually amplified from an Arabidopsis cDNA library and subcloned into the expression vector, pET44 Ek/LIC. Primers used for subcloning were 5′-GACGACGACAAGATGCGTGTAGCTTATCAAGG-3′ and 5′-GAGGAGAAGCCCGGTCACAATGAAAATGTTG-3′ for At2g27820, 5′-GACGACGACAAGATGCGTGTAGCTTACCAAG-3′ and 5′-GAGGAGAAGCCCGGTTCATGCTTCTTCTGTG-3′ for At3g44720, 5′-GACGACGACAAGATGCGTGTCGCGTATCAAG-3′ and 5′-GAGGAGAAGCCCGGTTCATACGTCTTCGCTAG-3′ for At5g22630, and 5′-GACGACGACAAGATGCGCGTCGCTTATCAAG-3′ and 5′-GAGGAGAAGCCCGGTTACGATGAAGTTGATG-3′ for At1g08250, respectively. Recombinant plasmids named pADT1–pADT6, bearing open reading frames of At1g11790, At3g07630, At2g27820, At3g44720, At5g22630, and At1g-08250, respectively, were transformed into Gigasingles competent cells, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Novagen). After sequence confirmation, pADT1–pADT6 were individually transformed into either BL21 Star™ (DE3) (pADT1) or Rosetta™ (DE3) (pADT2-pADT6) E. coli cells for expression of recombinant proteins. Tissue Preparation and RNA Isolation—Leaf, stem, floral, and whole silique tissues were harvested from at least 4-week-old (flowering) wild type Arabidopsis thaliana plants (The Ara-bidopsis Information Resource data base accession number CS3879, ecotype Columbia) grown in sterile soil under 24-h fluorescent light (150 μE/m2/s) at 20 °C. For root tissues, the plants were initially grown on 0.5× Murashige and Skoog basal medium with Gamborg's vitamins (MS; Sigma) and then transferred into 1× MS liquid medium and grown to maturity. The media were supplemented with plant preservative medium (Plant Cell Technology). Upon harvest, all of the tissues were immediately submerged into liquid nitrogen. To isolate total RNA, 100 mg of each plant tissue was lysed in 1 ml of TRIzol containing a large lysing matrix bead and shaken in a FastPrep machine (BIO101/QBioGene) once (flower and root) or twice (leaf, stem, and silique) for 45 s (setting 4). RNA was isolated using the QBioGene Fast RNA ProGreen Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR Analysis—RNA (10 μg) was treated with rDNase I (2 units) to remove single- and double-stranded DNA, and 2 μg was reverse transcribed using Super-Script™ II reverse transcriptase (200 units). PCR amplification was performed using primer pairs specific to the 3′-untranslated region of each ADT (ADT1-F, 5′-AATTGATTTCATGTTACCATACCG-3′; ADT1-R, 5′-TCTCAACAATGAAGAGTTTGAAGC-3′; ADT2-F, 5′-TCTTCTTGTTTGTGACAGAGATCC-3′; ADT2-R, 5′-AAACTAAACAGAATTTGTAACAAGAGC-3′; ADT3-F, 5′-CAACGTGTGAAGTCAATTGTG-3′; ADT3-R, 5′-CGATCAAACGAAACTCCAAAG-3′; ADT4-F, 5′-TCATTATTCACGTGGTGATTAGG-3′; ADT4-R, 5′-TTTGCTTTTCTTGGTTAAAATCG-3′; ADT5-F, 5′-TCGTTTTGCATGTGAAGTGG-3′; ADT5-R, 5′-TCATCAGAACCAAACTACAAACC-3′; ADT6-F, 5′-TGTAAATTTTGGAGAAGATAACAAAG-3′; and ADT6-R, 5′-TTTACCAATTGTTTATTGATTTATACG-3′). To ensure that PCR products originated solely from mRNA, each template was PCR-amplified using a primer set that specifically recognizes a genomic DNA sequence that is not transcribed (GEN-F, 5′-GCTTTCATGTTTTAGCAATGGCG-3′; GEN-R, 5′-ATTAATTCTTCGTGGATGCCGG-3′). The absence of amplification of a 600-bp product in DNase treated versus untreated samples demonstrates that experimental PCR amplifications are solely based on RNA templates. PCR products were sequenced to ensure that the proper ADT was amplified. As a control, PCR was also performed for all RNA extracts using an RNA-specific primer set (TUB2-F, 5′-TGTCTGCAAGGGTTCCAGGTT-3′; TUB2-R, 5′-TCACCTTCTTCATCCGCAGTT-3′) that amplifies the ubiquitously expressed gene TUBULIN2 (TUB2) (34Ludwig S.R. Oppenheimer D.G. Silflow C.D. Snustad D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5833-5837Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 35Suzuki T. Higgins P.J. Crawford D.R. BioTechniques. 2000; 29: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). All PCR amplifications were performed according to the following protocol: 2 min at 94 °C; 35 cycles of 15 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, 2 min at 68 °C; and a final extension for 10 min at 68 °C. PCR products were size-separated in a 6% polyacrylamide gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Expression in E. coli and Purification of Recombinant Nus Proteins—The E. coli transformants, individually harboring pADT1–pADT6, were grown at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with carbenicillin (0.1 mg ml-1) until an A600 of ∼0.9 was reached, at which time isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside (0.3 mm) was added. The cells were grown at 16 °C for 20–24 h, individually harvested by centrifugation (3,000 × g for 20 min), and stored at -20 °C until required. The cell pellets were individually resuspended in BugBuster Protein Extraction Reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions, with the cell debris removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 20 min). These crude protein preparations were individually applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column (1.6 × 3 cm) equilibrated in buffer A (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5), and eluted with buffer A containing 1 m NaCl. Fractions from the flow-through were combined and further subjected to POROS MC 20 column (1 × 9 cm) chromatography with Cu2+ (CuSO4) as metal ions (36Ueda E.K.M. Gout P.W. Morganti L. J. Chromatogr. A. 2003; 988: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). After washing with buffer B (20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 50 ml) containing 20 mm imidazole, recombinant proteins were individually eluted with an imidazole gradient (20–500 mm, 100 ml) in buffer B. Fractions containing each recombinant protein (i.e. eluting between 50 and 130 mm imidazole) were combined, buffer-exchanged to Buffer A, and concentrated to a small volume (∼0.5 ml) using a Centricon Plus-20 (Amicon). Because of the instability of the ADT proteins, the purification steps described above (from cell harvest to affinity chromatography) were carried out over a 24 h duration, with purified proteins immediately used for enzyme assays. PDT Assays—PDT activities were determined by measuring phenylpyruvate formation. Each assay consisted of prephenate (1 mm), recombinant protein (15 μg for ADT1 and ADT6, 2 μg for ADT2, and >150 μg for ADT3–ADT5), and buffer A in a total volume of 50 μl. The enzymatic reaction was initiated by individual addition of recombinant protein, and after incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, MeOH (50 μl) was added to stop the reaction. An aliquot (50 μl) of each assay mixture was then subjected to reversed phase HPLC (NovaPak C18, Waters) analysis. Phenylpyruvate and prephenate were separated using a linear MeOH gradient (0–18%) in eluant A (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.9) at a flow rate of 1 ml min-1, with detection at 210 nm. The amount of phenylpyruvate was determined using an external calibration curve. ADT Assays—ADT activities were measured by determining the amounts of phenylthiocarbamyl derivatives of Phe (26Razal R.A. Lewis N.G. Towers G.H.N. Phytochem. Anal. 1994; 5: 98-104Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Each assay mixture consisted of arogenate (1 mm), the recombinant protein (100 ng for ADT1 and ADT3–ADT6 and 50 ng for ADT2) and potassium phosphate buffer (200 mm, pH 7.5) in a total volume of 50 μl. The enzymatic reaction was initiated by individual addition of recombinant protein. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the reaction mixtures were immediately placed on ice to stop the reaction and freeze-dried. Lyophilized reaction mixtures were subsequently individually derivatized with phenylisothiocyanate as previously described (26Razal R.A. Lewis N.G. Towers G.H.N. Phytochem. Anal. 1994; 5: 98-104Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). After drying in vacuo, the reaction mixtures were reconstituted in 100 μl of PicoTag sample diluent. An aliquot (50 μl) was subjected to HPLC analysis on a PicoTag reversed phase column. The phenylthiocarbamyl derivatives were eluted with a linear gradient (0–100%) of eluant B (CH3CN-MeOH-H2O, 45:15:40) to eluant C (0.07 m sodium acetate, titrated to pH 6.5 with glacial acetic acid-CH3CN, 97.5:2.5) over 20 min at 1 ml min-1. Detection was at 254 nm. Amounts of Phe formed were determined using an external calibration curve. Control assays were conducted for both arogenate and prephenate activities as described above but in the absence of recombinant proteins. In Silico Analysis of Putative PDT and ACT Domains in Bacterial and Plant Genes and Proteins—Although ADT activity has been biochemically detected in bacteria, plants, and green algae (16Whitaker R.J.

Biol. 1981; 1: 426-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), there are no reports of molecular studies of any putative ADT genes in any organisms, only that of PDTs and CDTs. Our in silico screening, however, resulted in the provisional identification of six putative PDT domain-containing genes in Arabidopsis (At1g08250, At1g11790, At2g27820, At3g07630, At3g44720, and At5g22630) as mentioned above. Additionally, 35 possible ADT/PDT sequences were identified for other plant species, i.e. in Allium cepa, Glycine max, Gossypium hirsutum, Hordeum vulgare, Lotus japonicus, Lycopersicon esculentum, Medicago truncatula, Nicotiana benthamiana, Oryza sativa, Pinus taeda, Saccharum officinarum, Solanum tuberosum, Triticum aestivum, Vitis vinifera, and Zea mays, in available data bases (NCBI and TIGR), based on sequence similarity to the six Arabidopsis genes (nucleotide and translated amino acid sequences). All plant putative ADTs/PDTs contained three distinct (albeit putative) domains at the amino acid level: a N-terminal transit peptide, followed by a PDT-like domain, and a C-terminal ACT or ACT-like domain (Fig. 2A). By contrast, all bacterial PDT sequences lack the N-terminal signal peptide extension, whereas P-proteins have an N-terminal chorismate mutase domain. Although previously only two of the ADT/PDTs were annotated as possessing a partial (At1g11790) or full (At3g07630) ACT domain, our analysis suggests that the remaining four do as well. All share many of the conserved amino acids (Fig. 2B) considered important for feedback regulation in bacteria (see below). However, whether these enzymes utilize prephenate, arogenate, or both as a substrate could not be predicted by sequence analysis alone. Alignments also indicate that there are many conserved amino acids throughout the putative ADT/PDT domains in the selected plant and bacterial sequences examined (Fig. 2B). However, the rooted phylogenetic tree, constructed from amino acid sequences encompassing ADT/PDT and ACT domains from all species included, suggests that the plant and bacterial sequences are evolutionarily quite distinct from one another (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. S1). The plant sequences seem to form three distinct subgroups that are conserved across monocots and dicots. Interestingly, the Arabidopsis genes that segregated into subgroup I (At1g11790) and II (At3g07630) contain introns, whereas the remaining four (At2g27820, At3g44720, At5g22630, and At1g08250), which cluster within a subgroup III, do not (data not shown). Further distinction between Arabidopsis ADTs/PDTs is evident in the amino acid sequence similarities within their catalytic (ADT/PDT) domains. That is to say, all four Arabidopsis ADTs/PDTs from subgroup III show a higher degree of ADT/PDT domain amino acid similarity to each other (81–98%) than to either of the other two ADTs (61–72%) (Table 1). The conservation of these subgroups may denote unique roles (e.g. in distinct metabolic branches) for the members of each group (discussed later).TABLE 1Amino acid sequence identity of the PDT domains of putative Arabidopsis ADTs/PDTs The sequences were aligned using ClustalW, and then identity matrices were created using BioEdit, version 7.0.0.

https://openalex.org/W1995011145,"Although obesity is a risk factor for development of type 2 diabetes and chemical modification of proteins by advanced glycoxidation and lipoxidation end products is implicated in the development of diabetic complications, little is known about the chemical modification of proteins in adipocytes or adipose tissue. In this study we show that S-(2-succinyl)cysteine (2SC), the product of chemical modification of proteins by the Krebs cycle intermediate, fumarate, is significantly increased during maturation of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts to adipocytes. Fumarate concentration increased ≥5-fold during adipogenesis in medium containing 30 mm glucose, producing a ≥10-fold increase in 2SC-proteins in adipocytes compared with undifferentiated fibroblasts grown in the same high glucose medium. The elevated glucose concentration in the medium during adipocyte maturation correlated with the increase in 2SC, whereas the concentration of the advanced glycoxidation and lipoxidation end products, Nϵ-(carboxymethyl)lysine and Nϵ-(carboxyethyl)lysine, was unchanged under these conditions. Adipocyte proteins were separated by one- and two-dimensional electrophoresis and ∼60 2SC-proteins were detected using an anti-2SC polyclonal antibody. Several of the prominent and well resolved proteins were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight mass spectrometry. These include cytoskeletal proteins, enzymes, heat shock and chaperone proteins, regulatory proteins, and a fatty acid-binding protein. We propose that the increase in fumarate and 2SC is the result of mitochondrial stress in the adipocyte during adipogenesis and that 2SC may be a useful biomarker of mitochondrial stress in obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes.

The adipocyte is increasingly recognized as a dynamic cell that readily adapts to the changing nutritional status of the body. In a state of over-nutrition, the adipocyte responds by synthesizing and storing triglycerides, a process that may eventually lead to obesity and insulin resistance and then to diabetes.

However, relatively little is known about the chemical modification of proteins in adipocytes or adipose tissue or the possible role of chemical modifications of proteins in the regulation of adipocyte metabolism during adipogenesis or diabetogenesis.In general, AGE/ALEs are derivatives of lysine and arginine residues, formed by reaction of the amino or guanidino groups on protein with electrophilic intermediates in carbohydrate and lipid autoxidation or metabolism (4Uchida K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1685-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). In contrast to extracellular proteins, the lower pKa sulfhydryl group of cysteine residues is a more likely target for modification by electrophiles on intracellular proteins. We recently described S-(2-succinyl)cysteine (2SC) as a novel chemical modification of cysteine residues in proteins, formed by a Michael addition reaction between the Krebs cycle intermediate (KCI) fumarate and cysteine residues in protein (5Alderson N.L. Wang Y. Blatnik M. Frizzell N. Walla M.D. Lyons T.J. Alt N. Carson J.A. Nagai R. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 450: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). 2SC was detected in human serum albumin and was increased in the skeletal muscle protein and urine of diabetic rats. 2SC was also present at trace levels and increased with age in human skin collagen. Levels of 2SC correlated strongly with the concentration of the AGE/ALE, Nϵ-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML) in both human skin collagen and skeletal muscle of diabetic rats, suggesting that 2SC might be a useful marker of oxidative stress and tissue damage in diabetes. In other work, we have determined that the increase in 2SC in muscle proteins in diabetes is caused by a comparable increase in intracellular fumarate concentration, suggesting that KCIs are elevated in muscle in diabetes as a result of mitochondrial stress or dysfunction. Based on these observations, we have begun to study the formation of AGE/ALEs and 2SC in other biological systems or conditions in which fumarate concentration is increased.The 3T3-L1 fibroblast is a well studied model of cellular differentiation and adipogenesis. In response to insulin, glucose, dexamethasone, and isobutylmethylxanthine, it matures into a fat-laden adipocyte in vitro (6Rubin A.H. Terasaki M. Sanui H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4379-4383Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), a process that is characterized by an ≥10-fold increase in fumarate secretion into the medium (7Lai R.K. Goldman P. Metabolism. 1992; 41: 545-547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Adipocyte differentiation and maturation is associated with a dramatic shift in metabolic processes; cells rapidly metabolize glucose as they switch to triglyceride synthesis and storage. The maturation process depends on increased glucose uptake and utilization since lipid deposition increases with increasing glucose concentration in the medium (8Lin Y. Berg A.H. Iyengar P. Lam T.K. Giacca A. Combs T.P. Rajala M.W. Du X. Rollman B. Li W. Hawkins M. Barzilai N. Rhodes C.J. Fantus I.G. Brownlee M. Scherer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4617-4626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Like adipose tissue in diabetic animals, adipocytes become insulin-resistant during maturation in high glucose medium (8Lin Y. Berg A.H. Iyengar P. Lam T.K. Giacca A. Combs T.P. Rajala M.W. Du X. Rollman B. Li W. Hawkins M. Barzilai N. Rhodes C.J. Fantus I.G. Brownlee M. Scherer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4617-4626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Maturation at high glucose concentration is also accompanied by a significant increase in oxidative stress and mitochondrial superoxide production, apparently as a result of hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial inner membrane (IMM) (8Lin Y. Berg A.H. Iyengar P. Lam T.K. Giacca A. Combs T.P. Rajala M.W. Du X. Rollman B. Li W. Hawkins M. Barzilai N. Rhodes C.J. Fantus I.G. Brownlee M. Scherer P.E. J. Biol.

Thus, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) can be decreased by treatment with uncouplers or by overexpression of uncoupling protein-1 (8Lin Y. Berg A.H. Iyengar P. Lam T.K. Giacca A.

Alterations in mitochondrial function are also apparent in adipocytes from diabetic (db/db) mice (9Choo H.J. Kim J.H. Kwon O.B. Lee C.S. Mun J.Y. Han S.S. Yoon Y.S. Yoon G. Choi K.M. Ko Y.G. Diabetologia. 2006; 49: 784-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), consistent with the role of mitochondrial stress or dysfunction in the development of diabetes and its complications.We show here that both the fumarate concentration in adiocytes and the 2SC content of adipocyte proteins increase dramatically as a function of both time and glucose concentration during maturation of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts to adipocytes. We also identify several target proteins modified by 2SC in the adipocyte, but not in undifferentiated fibroblasts grown in high glucose medium, and show that in contrast to 2SC, the AGE/ALEs, CML and CEL, do not increase in response to oxidative stress during adipocyte differentiation and maturation. Our results suggest that irreversible, nonenzymatic modification of thiol proteins by fumarate may contribute to alterations in metabolism in response to mitochondrial stress during the transitions from obesity to insulin resistance and diabetes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals—Unless otherwise noted, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma/Aldrich. [U-13C3,15N]Cysteine and d8-lysine were from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Woburn, MA). 2SC and [U-13C3,15N]2SC were synthesized as previously described (5Alderson N.L. Wang Y. Blatnik M. Frizzell N. Walla M.D. Lyons T.J. Alt N. Carson J.A. Nagai R. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 450: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). CML, d4-CML, CEL, and d8-CEL were also synthesized and analyzed as previously described (10Ahmed M.U. Brinkmann Frye E. Degenhardt T.P. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 11Lowry O.H. Rosenbrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Polyacrylamide gels, polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, ECL chemiluminescent substrate, and BioSafe Coomassie Blue stain were purchased from Bio-Rad, and large 27.6 × 21.2-cm pre-cast gels were obtained from Jule Biotechnologies (Milford, CT). Immobiline IPG strips and ampholytes for isoelectric focusing were purchased from GE Healthcare, and Sypro Ruby gel stain and Sypro Ruby protein blot stain were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Bovine pancreatic DNase I was obtained from Pierce.Synthesis of 2-Succinylcysteamine (2SCEA) and Preparation of Anti-2SC Antibody—2SCEA was prepared by reacting cysteamine (500 mm) with a 10% molar excess of N-ethylmaleimide in phosphate buffer (200 mm, pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. 2SCEA was recovered by hydrolysis in 6 m HCl for 6 h at 110 °C followed by desalting on a Dowex-50 cation exchange resin and lyophilization. 2SCEA was detected by amino acid analysis using cation exchange chromatography on a 250 × 3-mm polydivinylbenzene sulfonate column and the sodium buffer system from Pickering Laboratories (Mountain View, CA) with post-column derivatization using o-phthaldialdehyde and fluorescence detection at excitation = 375 nm, and emission = 425 nm. 2SCEA was then collected by chromatography without post-column reaction, desalted on Dowex 50 cation exchange resin, and lyophilized. The chemical purity and identity of 2SCEA was confirmed by proton NMR, and its concentration was determined by amino acid analysis using a valine standard.Purified rabbit polyclonal antibody against 2SC was prepared by Eurogentec (San Diego, CA). Briefly, purified 2SCEA was cross-linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin with glutaraldehyde. A New Zealand White rabbit was inoculated with 2SCEA-keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) and Freund's complete adjuvant followed by three booster inoculations with 2SCEA-KLH and Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Antiserum was collected, and the polyclonal antibody was purified by affinity chromatography on a 2SCEA-glutaraldehyde resin. By direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the purified anti-2SCEA antibody showed reactivity to 2SC-RNase and 2SC-ovalbumin but not with unmodified RNase, ovalbumin, or keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The antibody did not cross-react with N-carboxymethylalbumin, prepared by reductive alkylation with glyoxylic acid using NaCNBH3 (10Ahmed M.U. Brinkmann Frye E. Degenhardt T.P. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar) nor with proteins reduced with dithiothreitol in denaturing buffer (below) and carboxymethylated with iodoacetic acid.Fibroblast and Adipocyte Studies—Murine fibroblasts (3T3-L1) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured on 10-mm plates in basal Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro, Herndon, VA) containing 5 mm d-glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Atlanta, GA). Medium was replaced at 48-h intervals throughout. Differentiation of confluent fibroblasts into adipocytes was induced by the addition of dexamethasone (0.3 μm), 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (0.5 mm), insulin (10 μg/ml), and glucose (30 mm) in complete culture medium for 2.5 days (6Rubin A.H. Terasaki M. Sanui H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4379-4383Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This mixture was then replaced with basal medium containing a range of glucose concentrations (5–30 mm) and 5 μg/ml insulin for a further 2–8 days (maturation period) during which time lipid droplets accumulated in the cytoplasm. Undifferentiated fibroblasts incubated in basal growth medium alone (5 mm glucose) or with high glucose (30 mm) served as controls. Cells were harvested in 500 μl of lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100) and were sheared using a 21-gauge needle attached to a 1-ml syringe. The cell lysate was pulse-sonicated at 2 watts using a Model 100 sonic dismembrator (Fisher) for 1 min before DNase treatment (200 units) for 15 min in lysis buffer. Protein content was determined by the Lowry assay (11Lowry O.H. Rosenbrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Triglyceride Analysis—Triglyceride concentration was measured in 5-μl aliquots of cell lysates using the Thermo DMA triglyceride assay kit and standard (Thermo Electron Corp., Waltham, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.GC-MS Analysis of 2SC, CML, and CEL in Cell Lysates—Protein (2 mg) from whole cell lysate was used for analysis of AGEs and 2SC. After overnight reduction at 4 °C with 100 mm NaBH4 in 0.2 m borate buffer, pH 9.2, the protein was precipitated with an equal volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid. The protein pellet was re-suspended in 200 μl of 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and lipids were removed by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold acetone with vortexing, after which the samples were placed on ice for 15 min followed by centrifugation at 4 °C at 2000 × g for 10 min. The pellets were dried under nitrogen before the addition of isotopically labeled internal standards (d8-lysine, U-13C3, 15N-2SC, d4-CML, and d8-CEL), then hydrolyzed in 6 m hydrochloric acid at 110 °C for 24 h. The samples were dried in vacuo, and brown materials were removed by application to a C-18 Sep Pak column (1 ml; Waters, Milford, MA) followed by elution of polar amino acids with H2O. N,O-Trifluoroacetyl methyl ester derivatives were prepared (12Shaw J.N. Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 186: 129-137PubMed Google Scholar) and then analyzed by multiple reaction monitoring GC-MS/MS on a TSQ 7000 (Thermo-Finnigan, Waltham, MA). The injection port was maintained at 200 °C, and the temperature program was 90 °C hold for 2 min, 10 °C/min from 90 to 140 °C, 3 °C/min to 220 °C, 15 °C/min to 300 °C, then hold at 300 °C for 5 min. The parent and daughter ion pairs monitored were: lysine m/z 180 > 69, d8-lysine, m/z 188 > 69; 2SC, m/z 284 > 242, U-13C3, 15N-2SC m/z 288 > 246; CML m/z 392 > 191; d4-CML m/z 396 > 195; CEL m/z 379 > 206; d8-CEL m/z 387 > 214. Quantification of analytes in protein samples was performed by isotope dilution mass spectrometry based on standard curves constructed from mixtures of known amounts of heavy labeled and natural abundance standard. The amounts of all analytes were normalized to the lysine content of the sample.Analysis of Fumarate Concentration—Fumarate was measured in whole cell lysates (1 mg protein) according to the method of Tanaka et al. (13Tanaka A. Nose N. Watanabe A. J. Chromatogr. 1980; 194: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cell lysates were treated with 20 μl of hydroxylamine at room temperature for 30 min in glass tubes before the addition of 100 nmol of nonanoic acid as an internal standard. The samples were acidified with 500 μl of 3 m hydrochloric acid, then extracted twice with 2 ml ethyl acetate and dried under nitrogen. The trimethylsilyl derivatives were prepared by the addition of 100 μl of acetonitrile and 100 μl of N-methyltrimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (Pierce). After incubating at 60 °C for 15 min, the samples were analyzed by multiple reaction monitoring GC-MS/MS on the TSQ 7000. For analysis of nonanoic acid and fumarate, the injection port was maintained at 200 °C, and the temperature program was 80 °C hold for 3 min, 10 °C/min from 80 to 300 °C, then hold at 300 °C for 5 min. The parent and daughter ion pairs monitored were: fumarate, m/z 245 > 147, and nonanoic acid, m/z 215 > 74. Quantification of fumarate was based on standard curves constructed from known mixtures of fumarate and nonanoic acid standards.One-dimensional PAGE and Western Blotting—Fibroblast or adipocyte protein (50 μg) was diluted to 30 μl in deionized water before adding fresh Laemmli loading buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar). The samples were boiled for 10 min at 95 °C and then loaded onto 12.5% Tris-HCl polyacrylamide gels; electrophoresis was carried out at 200 V for 55 min. The separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane at 20 V for 45 min, and the membranes were blocked overnight in 5% nonfat dry milk. The membrane was probed with 0.5 μg of polyclonal anti-2SC antibody dissolved in 1% nonfat dry milk for 1 h. Blots were washed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, containing 0.05% Tween 20 followed by the addition of goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., Carlsbad, CA). After a series of washes, 2SC immunoreactivity was detected using ECL chemiluminescent substrate exposed to CL-XPosure film (Pierce).Two-dimensional PAGE—Isoelectric focusing was performed on an Ettan IPGPhor II (GE Healthcare). Both fibroblast and adipocyte samples (250 μg of protein for 17-cm gels at pH 4–7 and 700 μg for 24-cm gels at pH 4.5–5.5) were precipitated with acetone, then dissolved in re-hydration buffer (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 2% CHAPS, 1% immobilized pH gradient (IPG) buffer, and 50 mm dithiothreitol). The samples were loaded in the IPGphor strip holder before the addition of the Immobiline IPG strips and were allowed to rehydrate overnight for 18 h before isoelectric focusing at 21 °C on the IPGphor IEF system using the following step programs; linear at 500 V for 45 min, linear at 1000 V for 1 h, linear for 8000 V·h for a total of 27 kV·h for 17-cm strips or linear at 200 V for 1 h, linear at 500 V for 1 h, linear at 1000 V for 45 min, linear at 2000 V for 45 min, and gradient to 3500 V for 28 h for a total of 101 kV for 24-cm strips. After electrophoresis the strips were each equilibrated in 15 ml of equilibration buffer I (6 m urea, 0.4 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, containing 30% glycerol (v/v), 2%SDS (w/v), 1% dithiothreitol) then shaken gently for 15 min at 21 °C. The solution was decanted and replaced with 15 ml of equilibration buffer II (6 m urea, 0.4 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, containing 30% glycerol (v/v), 2%SDS (w/v), 1% iodoacetamide) and incubated with gentle shaking for an additional 15 min. After equilibration, the strips were loaded onto 12.5% precast gels; the 17-cm strips were electrophoresed on a Bio-Rad Protean II system, and the 24-cm strips were electrophoresed on an Ettan Dalt 6 system (GE Healthcare). The separated proteins were fixed with 7.5% acetic acid, 10% methanol for 1 h before overnight staining with Sypro Ruby gel stain. The stained gels were imaged on a Typhoon 9400 multilaser scanner (GE Healthcare). A duplicate gel was transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and fixed as above before staining for 15 min with Sypro Ruby blot stain. The blot was washed in water and imaged in the same manner as the gel. The blot was then washed in 150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, for 10 min before blocking and immunostaining with anti-2SC antibody as described above. 2SC-positive spots on the immunoblots were overlaid with the Sypro-stained membrane and matched to the corresponding spots on the Sypro stained gel using DeCyder two-dimensional differential analysis software (GE Healthcare). The protein spots were then manually excised from the gel using the Ettan Spot Picker (GE Healthcare).Protein Identification by Mass Spectrometry—The excised spots were processed for MS analysis using an automated gel-processing robot (PerkinElmer Life Sciences MultiProbe II). The spots were placed in wells of ZipPlates (Millipore Inc., Billerica, MA) and washed twice with 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate in 5% acetonitrile, then dehydrated with 100% acetonitrile. Trypsin digestion was carried out overnight with sequence grade-modified trypsin by adding 15 μl of a 100 ng/ml solution in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate. Tryptic peptides were drawn through the bottom of the ZipPlate wells then washed with 5% acetonitrile in 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid and a final wash with 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides were eluted from the ZipPlate with 1.5 μl of 5 mg/mlα-cyano-4-hydroxycinnaminic acid in 50% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid directly onto a MALDI plate insert then analyzed on an Applied Biosystems 4700 MALDI TOF-TOF. The data were searched using GPS software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and Mascot (Matrix Science, London, UK).Statistical Analysis—Data are summarized throughout as the means ± S.E. and are plotted using Sigma Plot 8 software (Systat Software, Inc. (SSI), Point Richmond, CA). Statistical analyses were performed using InStat (GraphPad software, San Diego, CA). Differences between groups were analyzed using the unpaired two-tailed t test.RESULTSTriglycerides and 2SC Increase in Adipocytes as a Function of Time and Glucose Concentration—The continuous formation of intracellular triglyceride vesicles over time and with increasing glucose concentrations was clearly visible by light microscopic observation of maturing 3T3-L1 adipocytes (not shown). The triglyceride content increased 3–4-fold compared with undifferentiated fibroblasts during 8 days of maturation in 30 mm glucose (63 versus 16 μg/mg cell protein, Fig. 1A). The increase in triglyceride content was also dependent on the glucose concentration in the medium during fibroblast differentiation (Fig. 1B). Fibroblasts cultured in 5 mm glucose and harvested at day 0 had essentially the same triglyceride content (∼17 μg/mg cell protein) as fibroblasts grown for 8 days in 5 mm glucose (Fig. 1B).2SC also increased as a function of time and glucose concentration in adipocytes, with the maximal rate of 2SC accumulation occurring between 2 and 4 days in culture and the maximum 2SC levels observed after 6–8 days of maturation (Fig. 2A). The level of 2SC in adipocytes was ∼20-fold greater than that in fibroblasts after 8 days in culture in 30 mm glucose (adipocytes, 0.46 mmol 2SC/mol of lysine; fibroblasts, 0.025 mmol 2SC/mol of lysine, p < 0.0001, Fig. 2A). In a separate experiment, adipocyte 2SC also increased as a function of glucose concentration in the medium over a concentration range from 5–30 mm, rising from an average of 0.22 mmol 2SC/mol of lysine in 5 mm glucose to 0. 44 mmol 2SC/mol of lysine in 30 mm glucose (p = 0.02, Fig. 2B). 2SC also increased about 2-fold in undifferentiated fibroblasts after 8 days in culture in 30 mm glucose, but in general the increase in 2SC was dependent on both differentiation and glucose concentration. Although the concentrations of CML and CEL were comparable with that of 2SC in fibroblasts (Fig. 2, C versus A), neither CML nor CEL (Fig. 2C) changed significantly in either fibroblasts or adipocytes as a function of time of maturation. CML (Fig. 2D) and CEL (not shown) were also unaffected by glucose concentration during maturation.FIGURE 2Intracellular 2SC, but not CML or CEL, increases during adipocyte maturation as a function of both time and extracellular glucose concentration. Cell lysates (2 mg protein) from the same samples described in Fig. 1 were analyzed for 2SC, CML, and CEL by GC-MS as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Adipocytes (open circles, open bars) and fibroblasts (closed circles, closed bars) were incubated in 30 mm glucose for 0–8 days (A and C) or with increasing concentrations of glucose (5–30 mm) for 8 days (B and D). 2SC, CML (circles), and CEL (squares) were quantified by multiple reaction monitoring-GC-MS/MS.

Biophys. 2006; 450: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and has been reported to increase during adipocyte maturation (7Lai R.K. Goldman P. Metabolism. 1992; 41: 545-547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), we examined the relationship between fumarate concentration and 2SC formation in fibroblasts and adipocytes. Fumarate did not change in fibroblasts cultured for up to 8 days in 30 mm glucose but increased gradually in adipocytes as a function of time, yielding a 5–6-fold increase at 6 days (fibroblasts, 0.28 nmol fumarate/mg of protein; adipocytes, 1.6 nmol fumarate/mg of protein, p = 0.01, Fig. 3A). Mean adipocyte fumarate content also rose when cells were differentiated at higher glucose concentration compared with fibroblasts cultured under the same conditions (Fig. 3B). Notably, fumarate concentrations in adipocytes increased 3-fold when glucose in the medium was increased from 5 to 10 mm, rising from 0.66 nmol of fumarate/mg of protein to 1.9 nmol/mg but did not change further with increasing glucose concentration. In contrast, in fibroblasts the mean fumarate concentration over all glucose concentrations was 0.42 nmol/mg of protein (Fig. 3B). In general, these experiments demonstrate that exposure to high glucose both enhanced the production of fumarate and increased the formation of 2SC on protein during adipocyte maturation. The stepwise change in fumarate concentration between 5 and 10 mm glucose without further change at higher glucose concentration (Fig. 3B) suggests a threshold effect; above 10 mm glucose there is no further increase in fumarate concentration.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Slc1 has been shown to mediate this reaction, but distinct activity remains after its removal from the genome. To identify the enzyme that mediates the remaining activity, we performed synthetic genetic array analysis using a slc1Δ strain. One of the genes identified by the screen, LPT1, was found to encode for an acyltransferase that uses a variety of lysophospholipid species, including 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate. Deletion of LPT1 had a minimal effect on 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase activity, but overexpression increased activity 7-fold. Deletion of LPT1 abrogated the esterification of other lysophospholipids, and overexpression increased lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase activity 7-fold. The majority of this activity co-purified with microsomes. To test the putative role for this enzyme in selectively incorporating unsaturated acyl chains into phospholipids in vitro, substrate concentration series experiments were performed with the four acyl-CoA species commonly found in yeast. Although the saturated palmitoyl-CoA and stearoyl-CoA showed a lower apparent Km, the monounsaturated palmitoleoyl-CoA and oleoyl-CoA showed a higher apparent Vmax. Arachidonyl-CoA, although not abundant in yeast, also had a high apparent Vmax. Pulse-labeling of lpt1Δ strains showed a 30% reduction in [3H]oleate incorporation into phosphatidylcholine only. Therefore, Lpt1p, a member of the membrane-bound o-acyltransferase gene family, seems to work in conjunction with Slc1 to mediate the incorporation of unsaturated acyl chains into the sn-2 position of phospholipids.

Therefore, Lpt1p, a member of the membrane-bound o-acyltransferase gene family, seems to work in conjunction with Slc1 to mediate the incorporation of unsaturated acyl chains into the sn-2 position of phospholipids. It has long been known that phospholipids commonly contain an asymmetrical distribution of acyl chains (1Hanahan D.J. Brockerhoff H. Barron E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 1917-1923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Yamada K. Okuyama H. Endo Y. Ikezawa H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 183: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Saturated acyl chains are usually found at the sn-1 position and unsaturated acyl chains at sn-2. The reason for this asymmetry may be that the liquid crystal transition temperature (Tc) for phospholipids with two saturated acyl chains, such as distearoyl phosphatidylcholine (58 °C), is much higher than that for 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (3 °C) (3Phillips M.C. Hauser H. Paltauf F. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1972; 8: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The incorporation of unsaturated acyl chains prevents membranes from assuming the gel phase at common physiological temperatures. During the de novo synthesis of phospholipids (Fig. 1A), acyl chains are incorporated into the sn-2 position by 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (AGPAT), 2The abbreviations used are: AGPAT, 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase; LPCAT, lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase; SGA, synthetic genetic array; LPLAT, lysophospholipid acyltransferase; MBOAT, membrane-bound o-acyltransferase; ACAT, acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase; DGAT, acyl-CoA diacylglycerol acyltransferase; PA, phosphatidic acid; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PS, phosphatidylserine. also known as lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase. The acyl-CoA substrate specificity for the reaction in rat liver microsomes (4Lands W.E. Inoue M. Sugiura Y. Okuyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14968-14972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by overexpressed human AGPAT1 (5Aguado B. Campbell R.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 20299-20305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) shows only a mild, if any, preference for unsaturated species. Thus, whereas the reaction produces a necessary intermediate, phosphatidic acid, in the synthesis of phospholipids and triglycerides, the substrate specificity does not match the acyl chain composition of most phospholipids. However, the reaction clearly has physiological importance because mutations in AGPAT2 result in the dramatic lack of many, but not all, adipose depots in congenital general lipodystrophy (8Agarwal A.K. Arioglu E. de Almeida S. Akkoc N. Taylor S.I. Bowcock A.M. Barnes R.I. Garg A. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 21-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Given this necessity of AGPAT2 function, it is surprising that there are nine AGPAT paralogs in humans. AGPAT6 has been implicated in triglyceride synthesis in mammary glands (9Beigneux A.P. Vergnes L. Qiao X. Quatela S. Davis R. Watkins S.M. Coleman R.A. Walzem R.L. Philips M. Reue K. Young S.G. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 734-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). AGPAT8 encodes for an endoplasmic reticulum glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (10Agarwal A.K. Barnes R.I. Garg A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 449: 64-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and AGPAT9 is highly homologous to lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 1 (LPCAT1) (11Agarwal A.K. Sukumaran S. Bartz R. Barnes R.I. Garg A. J. Endocrinol. 2007; 193: 445-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Whether the members of this gene family are responsible for all AGPAT activity in mammals cannot be practically determined. The only AGPAT gene family member in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae is SLC1. SLC1 deletion mutants contain no AGPAT activity in lipid particles and ∼50% activity in microsomes (12Athenstaedt K. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7611-7616Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Clearly, a unique AGPAT exists in the yeast genome. The product of AGPAT, PA, can be used to synthesize phospholipids by two pathways (Fig. 1A) (reviewed in Ref. 13de Kroon A.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1771: 343-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Additionally, after de novo synthesis, phospholipids can undergo remodeling (Fig. 1B). This involves deacylation at the sn-2 position by phospholipase A2 and reacylation by acyl-CoA-dependent lysophospholipid acyltransferase (Lands' Cycle) (14Lands W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 2233-2237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are many possible physiological functions of this remodeling that may be organism- and cell type-specific. In addition to incorporating unsaturated acyl chains for membrane fluidity, specific incorporation of the polyunsaturated arachidonyl into the sn-2 position may prime phospholipase A2-inducible signal cascades that involve eicosanoid synthesis (15Chilton F.H. Hadley J.S. Murphy R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 917: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Alternatively, preferential incorporation of saturated acyl chains occurs during surfactant production in lungs (16Post M. Schuurmans E.A. Batenburg J.J. Van Golde L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 750: 68-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The remodeling enzymes may also re-esterify exogenous lysophospholipids generated by extracellular lipases. For instance, yeast can absorb and esterify lysophosphatidylethanolamine (lysoPE) (17Riekhof W.R. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36588-36596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In mammals, this process may prevent the inflammation that lysophospholipids can induce (18Kougias P. Chai H. Lin P.H. Lumsden A.B. Yao Q. Chen C. Med. Sci. Monit. 2006; 12: RA5-16PubMed Google Scholar). To date, the only cloned lysophospholipid acyltransferases are the mouse LPCAT1 and lyso-platelet-activating factor acyltransferase/LPCAT2 (19Chen X. Hyatt B.A. Mucenski M.L. Mason R.J. Shannon J.M.

These are primarily expressed in lungs, have a mild preference for saturated acyl-CoA, are specific for lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC), and have conserved motifs in common with the AGPAT gene family. In yeast, acyl-CoA-independent LPCAT (i.e. transacylase) activity is mediated by Taffazin (22Testet E. Laroche-Traineau J. Noubhani A. Coulon D. Bunoust O. Camougrand N. Manon S. Lessire R. Bessoule J.J. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 617-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and acyl-CoA dependent LPCAT activity has been reported (2Yamada K. Okuyama H. Endo Y. Ikezawa H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 183: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 23Richard M.G. McMaster C.R. Lipids. 1998; 33: 1229-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), but the enzyme had not been identified. In this study, the application of synthetic genetic array (SGA) analysis lead to the identification of the enzyme, Lpt1p. SGA is an automated approach to create double gene deletion mutants by crossing a gene deletion strain of interest and the ∼5,000 viable yeast gene deletion strains. Inviability of the double deletion mutants (i.e. synthetic lethality) defines a relationship whereby mutation in two different genes, neither by itself lethal, causes cell death when combined in a haploid genome (24Tong A.H. Evangelista M. Parsons A.B. Xu H. Bader G.D. Page N. Robinson M. Raghibizadeh S. Hogue C.W. Bussey H. Andrews B. Tyers M. Boone C. Science. 2001; 294: 2364-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). Such genetic interactions are of particular interest because they can identify genes whose products perform complementary biological functions. Materials—Synthetic complete medium and yeast nitrogen base were obtained from Q-biogene (MP Biomedicals). Myristoyl lysophosphatidylethanolamine and oleoyl lysophosphatidylserine were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). [1-14C]Palmitoyl-lysoPC (55 mCi/mmol) was from Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences. Nourseothricin was obtained from Werner BioAgents. All other chemicals were obtained from either Sigma or Fisher. Yeast Strains—Molecular biology and yeast genetic procedures were performed according to conventional protocols (25Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.

Deletion mutant strains for SLC1 and LPT1 were generated by homologous recombination in a W303-1B haploid (MATa ade2-1, can1-1, trp1-1, ura3-1, his3-11, 15, leu2-3, 112) (26Thomas B.J. Rothstein R.

Successful deletion was confirmed by PCR using gene-specific primers. Yeast were grown in YP medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone) with 2% glucose (yYPD) or in synthetic complete (SC) medium (29Adams, A., Gottschling, D. E., Kaiser, C., and Stearns, T. (1997) Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual, pp. 148–149, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NYGoogle Scholar). Synthetic Lethality Screen—SGA was performed as described previously (24Tong A.H. Evangelista M. Parsons A.B. Xu H. Bader G.D. Page N. Robinson M. Raghibizadeh S. Hogue C.W. Bussey H. Andrews B. Tyers M. Boone C. Science. 2001; 294: 2364-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). A MATα slc1Δ::NatMX4 can1Δ::STE2pr-Sp_his5 lyp1Δ strain was crossed to an array containing the set of ∼5,000 viable deletion mutant strains. Yeast Expression Plasmid Construction—A PCR product including the LPT1 open reading frame, 90 bp of 5′-flanking sequence, and 46 bp of 3′-flanking sequence was generated using the primers: 175-1, CAAAATACAGGCACAGGTCAAGC; 175-2, GACAACAAGACTGTGACTTCCAC, and W303-1B genomic DNA. The 2.0-kb PCR product was cloned into pCR2.1 TOPO (Invitrogen) and subsequently subcloned (NotI/SacI) into pRS423GP to create pRS423GP-LPT1. Pulse Labeling—Pulse labeling of yeast was performed for 30 min with log phase cultures cultured in YPD with [3H]oleate as described previously (30Oelkers P. Cromley D. Padamsee M. Billheimer J.T. Sturley S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8877-8881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Phospholipids were resolved by thin layer chromatography in chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:water (50:25:8:4), and neutral lipids were resolved as described previously (30Oelkers P. Cromley D. Padamsee M. Billheimer J.T. Sturley S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8877-8881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Each lane was cut according to lipid standards and counted by liquid scintillation. Assays were performed on a minimum of two independent strains of each genotype on two different days. Statistical analysis was performed using t tests. Preparation of Cell Lysates, Mitochondria, and Microsomes–Yeast cells were grown in YP containing either 2% glucose or 3% glycerol at 30 °C into early stationary phase (A660 = 1.0). SC-His medium containing 2% galactose was used for yeast harboring a plasmid. The cells were harvested and washed, and cell lysates were prepared as described previously (30Oelkers P. Cromley D. Padamsee M. Billheimer J.T. Sturley S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8877-8881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The mitochondria were prepared using a previously published protocol (31Meisinger C. Sommer T. Pfanner N. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were grown in YP medium containing 3% glycerol, harvested, and lysed, and crude mitochondria were precipitated by centrifugation at 12,000 × g. Resuspension of the pellet, followed by sucrose step gradients allowed purified mitochondria to be collected. The microsomes were purified from the 12,000 × g supernatant by precipitation by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h (30Oelkers P. Cromley D. Padamsee M. Billheimer J.T. Sturley S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8877-8881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Lowry assays were used to measure protein concentration. AGPAT and LPLAT Assays, Spectrophotometric Method–AGPAT activity was measured by the reaction of thiol groups of the released CoA with 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid) resulting in absorbance at 412 nm (32Yamashita S. Hosaka K. Miki Y. Numa S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 528-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1.5 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid), 50 μm lysophosphatidic acid (lysoPA), 50 μm acyl CoA, and cell lysate (210–840 μg) in a total volume of 1 ml. The reaction was monitored in real time for 3 min in a Spectronic Genesys 2 spectrophotometer at room temperature. A molar absorbance of 13,600 m–1 cm–1 was used to calculate relative specific activity. Lysophospholipid acyltransferase (LPLAT) activity was measured by replacing lysoPA with lysoPC, lysoPE, lysoPI, or lysoPS. LPCAT Assay, Radioactive Substrate—LPCAT activity was measured by the incorporation of [1-14C]palmitoyl lysoPC into PC. The reaction contained 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 μm [1-14C]palmitoyl lysoPC (50,000 dpm/nmol), 1–110 μm of the respective acyl-CoA, and 3 μg of cell lysate protein in a final volume of 100 μl. Fixed time assays were performed for 5 min at 28 °C. The reactions were stopped by adding chloroform:methanol (2:1), and lipids were extracted and resolved as described elsewhere (20Nakanishi H.

EZ-Fit software was used for nonlinear regression, curve fit analysis to calculate Km and Vmax. To calculate Vmax/Km, Vmax was first changed to nm/min/mg to remove volume from the units of the ratio. SGA Screen with slc1Δ Identified LPT1—To identify the second AGPAT in S. cerevisiae, a SGA screen (24Tong A.H. Evangelista M. Parsons A.B. Xu H. Bader G.D. Page N. Robinson M. Raghibizadeh S. Hogue C.W. Bussey H. Andrews B. Tyers M. Boone C. Science. 2001; 294: 2364-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar) was carried out using an slc1Δ query strain. The primary screen identified 52 nonessential genes that resulted in a synthetic lethal/sick phenotype when disrupted in combination with deletion of SLC1 (data not shown). Although the primary screen often contains a number of false positive interactions, some functionally relevant genes were identified including the fatty acid elongase gene, ELO2. The screen also identified two genes, PMT5 and YOR175C, that were previously shown to exhibit genetic interactions with SLC1 (33Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (9290) Google Scholar). PMT5 encodes for a component of the dolichyl-phosphate-mannose-protein mannosyltransferase complex, whereas a function for YOR175c (from here on referred to as LPT1) 3While this paper was under review, two papers describing the same gene have been electronically published. Riekhof et al. (51Riekhof, W. R., Wu, J., Jones, J. L., and Voelker, D. R. (July 24, 2007) J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbc.M705256200Google Scholar) named it ALE1, and Benghezal et al. (52Benghezal, M., Roubaty, C., Veepuri, V., Knudsen, J., and Conzelmann, A. (August 3, 2007) J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbc.M702719200Google Scholar) named it SLC4. was uncharacterized previously. To confirm the synthetic-lethal interaction, independent slc1Δ and lpt1Δ haploid strains were generated and mated to form compound heterozygous diploids. Following meiosis, 80 haploid spores were isolated by tetrad dissection. Sixty spores were viable, and all were of the wild-type, slc1Δ or lpt1Δ genotype. In line with Hardy Weinberg equilibrium, ¼ of the progeny were therefore inviable and slc1Δlpt1Δ, confirming the synthetic lethal interaction. Lpt1p Primary Structure—The LPT1 gene encodes for a predicted protein of 619 amino acids and 72.2 kDa. Computer algorithm analysis predicts seven transmembrane domains (33Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (9290) Google Scholar). The C-terminal four amino acids, KKEE, agree with the conserved ER retention signal KKXX (34Nilsson T. Jackson M. Peterson P.A. Cell. 1989; 58: 707-718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). This is consistent with studies that have shown Lpt1p to co-purify with ribosomes (35Fleischer T.C. Weaver C.M. McAfee K.J. Jennings J.L. Link A.J. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1294-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and a Lpt1p-green fluorescent protein chimera to localize to the endoplasmic reticulum (36Huh W.K. Falvo J.V. Gerke L.C.

In terms of homology, Lpt1p belongs to the membrane-bound o-acyltransferase (MBOAT) family of proteins (37Hofmann K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 111-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Within the MBOAT domain (Pfam PFO3062), Lpt1p shares ∼25% identity with three characterized members of the MBOAT family in humans (Fig. 2). The presence of this domain in Lpt1p is consistent with it being an acyltransferase. Determining Whether Altering LPT1 Expression Alters AGPAT Activity—Initial experiments characterizing the acyltransferase activity in yeast cell lysates were performed by measuring the release of coenzyme A from acyl-CoA substrates. Assays with and without lysoPA were performed in parallel so that lysoPA-independent CoA generation could be measured and subtracted. This “background” activity was not different between wild-type and lpt1Δ samples. Two acyl-CoA species, palmitoyl-CoA and oleoyl-CoA, were provided to represent saturated and monounsaturated substrates. To establish the amount of Slc1-independent AGPAT activity in yeast, slc1Δ cell lysates were assayed and showed a 60% reduction, with either acyl-CoA, compared with wild-type yeast (Fig. 3A). In contrast, lpt1Δ cell lysates showed no statistically significant changes in AGPAT activity. However, overexpression of LPT1 resulted in a 7-fold increase in AGPAT activity (Fig. 3B). This suggests that Lpt1p can mediate the reaction, but in the early stationary phase of growth, from which these cells were harvested, Slc1 is the primary AGPAT. Lpt1p Esterifies Other Lysophospholipids—Because yeast have been shown to mediate LPCAT activity (2Yamada K. Okuyama H. Endo Y. Ikezawa H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 183: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 23Richard M.G. McMaster C.R. Lipids. 1998; 33: 1229-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we tested whether Lpt1p is also responsible for that activity. Similar assays to the above were performed by replacing lysoPA with lysoPC. Activity was seen with wild-type yeast cell lysates supplied with palmitoyl-CoA, oleoyl-CoA, and arachidonyl-CoA representing saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated substrates (Fig. 4A). Unsaturated acyl-CoAs showed 4–7-fold higher activity than the saturated palmitoyl-CoA. No activity was observed in lpt1Δ cell lysates with any of the acyl-CoAs, suggesting that Lpt1p is the main, if not only, LPCAT in yeast. Similar assays using [14C]lysoPC and oleoyl-CoA showed essentially no activity with lpt1Δ cell lysates (0.2 ± 0.2 nmol/min/mg) and robust activity in wild-type lysates (55.6 ± 4.7 nmol/min/mg). To address the possibility that Lpt1p is an accessory protein, necessary for the expression and/or activity of the true LPCAT, Lpt1p was overexpressed in wild-type yeast. LPCAT activity was increased 7-fold compared with wild-type yeast harboring an empty vector (Fig. 4B), consistent with Lpt1p being the catalyst of the observed activity. LysoPC-independent activity was modestly increased (11.5 versus 6.9 nmol/min/mg) with LPT1 overexpression. Because Lpt1p may be the only LPCAT in yeast, we hypothesized that it will have broad substrate specificity regarding lysophospholipids. Replacing lysoPC with lysoPE, lysophosphatidylinositol (lysoPI), or lysophosphatidylserine (lysoPS) showed distinct acyltransferase activity (Fig. 5, A and B). Comparing the enzyme activities of each lysophospholipid with oleoyl-CoA suggests that Lpt1p has a substrate preference of lysoPC = lysoPI = lysoPS > lysoPE (Figs. 4 and 5). Because Lpt1p can use multiple lysophospholipids as substrates, it should be referred to as a LPLAT. Acyl-CoA Substrate Specificity for Lpt1p—The ability to esterify lysophospholipids suggests that Lpt1p is involved in phospholipid remodeling. This hypothesis predicts that Lpt1p will preferentially utilize unsaturated acyl-CoA substrates. To test this, we performed substrate concentration series experiments with [14C]lysoPC and the four acyl-CoA species commonly found in yeast: palmitoyl-CoA (16:0), palmitoleoyl-CoA (16:1), stearoyl-CoA (18:0), and oleoyl-CoA (18:1). Arachidonyl-CoA (20:4) was also included to represent polyunsaturated acyl-CoAs. Curve fitting of the Michaelis-Menten plots (Fig. 6) determined the apparent Km and Vmax (Table 1). Palmitoyl-CoA and stearoyl-CoA showed relatively low Km and low Vmax values, whereas the monounsaturated palmitoleoyl-CoA and oleoyl-CoA showed relatively high Km and high Vmax values and arachidonyl-CoA showed intermediate values. Because all of the reactions have the same, although undetermined, enzyme concentration, Vmax/Km should be proportional to the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km). This value tended to be higher for the unsaturated acyl-CoAs than the saturated acyl-CoAs. However, because of the very low Km for palmitoyl-CoA, this trend was not absolute.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters of Lpt1pAcyl-CoAKmVmaxVmax/Kmμmnmol/min/mgmin-1 mg-1Palmitoyl-CoA (16:0)1.87.843Palmitoleoyl-CoA (16:1)2114269Stearoyl-CoA (18:0)5.91220Oleoyl-CoA (18:1)4912525Arachidonyl-CoA (20:4)115852 Open table in a new tab Subcellular Location of LPLAT Activity—Previous studies have identified acyl-CoA-dependent LPCAT activity in both yeast microsomes (23Richard M.G. McMaster C.R. Lipids. 1998; 33: 1229-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and mitochondria (22Testet E. Laroche-Traineau J. Noubhani A. Coulon D. Bunoust O. Camougrand N. Manon S. Lessire R. Bessoule J.J. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 617-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To determine the subcellular location of LPLAT activity, wild-type yeast organelles were separated by differential and density gradient centrifugation. Using lysoPC as a representative lysophospholipid in LPLAT assays, microsomes contained 10-fold enriched activity compared with whole cell lysates, whereas mitochondria showed no enrichment (Table 2). Because microsomes comprised a much larger fraction of total cell protein, they contained 65% of total cellular LPLAT activity. Mitochondria contained 2% of total activity with the remainder either lost during extraction or in another cellular compartment. No activity was detected in lpt1Δ mitochondria, suggesting that there is not a second, mitochondrial-specific LPCAT.TABLE 2Subcellular localization of acyl-CoA-dependent LPCAT activitySubcellular fractionLPCAT activityFold enrichmentRecoverynmol/min/mg%Cell lysate10.2 ± 0.5Mitochondria8.1 ± 1.90.8 ± 0.11.9 ± 0.9Microsomes99.2 ± 2.79.7 ± 0.265.1 ± 14.5 Open table in a new tab Role of Lpt1p in Oleate Incorporation into Glycerolipids—We next addressed the physiological importance of Lpt1p mediated LPLAT activity. Wild-type and lpt1Δ strains were pulse-labeled for 30 min with [3H]oleate. Incorporation of the radiolabel into PC in lpt1Δ strains was 30% less than in wild-type yeast (Fig. 7). Incorporation into PE, PI, and PS and neutral lipids was not affected. Because the product of AGPAT activity, PA, is required for the de novo synthesis of phospholipids and triglycerides, the selective effect on PC synthesis may be due to attenuated remodeling. If this is the case, then of the exogenous oleate incorporated into PC in wild-type yeast, 70% is via de novo synthesis and 30% is via remodeling. Why the phenotype was limited to PC is unclear. It may be that the phospholipase A2 component of the remodeling cycle preferentially generates lysoPC. AGPAT mediates the second step in de novo triglyceride and phospholipid synthesis. This pathway seems to be well conserved through evolution as evidenced by all of the enzymes of the pathway in S. cerevisiae identif"
https://openalex.org/W2099607251,"Evolutionary theory predicts that senescence, a decline in survival rates with age, is the consequence of stronger selection on alleles that affect fertility or mortality earlier rather than later in life. Hamilton quantified this argument by showing that a rare mutation reducing survival is opposed by a selective force that declines with age over reproductive life. He used a female-only demographic model, predicting that female menopause at age ca. 50 yrs should be followed by a sharp increase in mortality, a ""wall of death."" Human lives obviously do not display such a wall. Explanations of the evolution of lifespan beyond the age of female menopause have proven difficult to describe as explicit genetic models. Here we argue that the inclusion of males and mating patterns extends Hamilton's theory and predicts the pattern of human senescence. We analyze a general two-sex model to show that selection favors survival for as long as men reproduce. Male fertility can only result from matings with fertile females, and we present a range of data showing that males much older than 50 yrs have substantial realized fertility through matings with younger females, a pattern that was likely typical among early humans. Thus old-age male fertility provides a selective force against autosomal deleterious mutations at ages far past female menopause with no sharp upper age limit, eliminating the wall of death. Our findings illustrate the evolutionary importance of males and mating preferences, and show that one-sex demographic models are insufficient to describe the forces that shape human senescence."
https://openalex.org/W2063320400,"Abstract Isoforms in the PDE1 family of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases were recently found to comprise a significant portion of the cGMP-inhibited cAMP hydrolytic activity in human hearts. We examined the expression of PDE1 isoforms in human myocardium, characterized their catalytic activity, and quantified their contribution to cAMP hydrolytic and cGMP hydrolytic activity in subcellular fractions of this tissue. Western blotting with isoform-selective anti-PDE1 monoclonal antibodies showed PDE1C1 to be the principal isoform expressed in human myocardium. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that PDE1C1 is distributed along the Z-lines and M-lines of cardiac myocytes in a striated pattern that differs from that of the other major dual-specificity cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase in human myocardium, PDE3A. Most of the PDE1C1 activity was recovered in soluble fractions of human myocardium. It binds both cAMP and cGMP with Km values of ∼1 μm and hydrolyzes both substrates with similar catalytic rates. PDE1C1 activity in subcellular fractions was quantified using a new PDE1-selective inhibitor, IC295. At substrate concentrations of 0.1 μm, PDE1C1 constitutes the great majority of cAMP hydrolytic and cGMP hydrolytic activity in soluble fractions and the majority of cGMP hydrolytic activity in microsomal fractions, whereas PDE3 constitutes the majority of cAMP hydrolytic activity in microsomal fractions. These results indicate that PDE1C1 is expressed at high levels in human cardiac myocytes with an intracellular distribution distinct from that of PDE3A and that it may have a role in the integration of cGMP-, cAMP- and Ca2+-mediated signaling in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W2040223070,"4F2hc (CD98hc) is a multifunctional type II membrane glycoprotein involved in amino acid transport and cell fusion, adhesion, and transformation. The structure of the ectodomain of human 4F2hc has been solved using monoclinic (Protein Data Bank code 2DH2) and orthorhombic (Protein Data Bank code 2DH3) crystal forms at 2.1 and 2.8 Å, respectively. It is composed of a (βα)8 barrel and an antiparallel β8 sandwich related to bacterial α-glycosidases, although lacking key catalytic residues and consequently catalytic activity. 2DH3 is a dimer with Zn2+ coordination at the interface. Human 4F2hc expressed in several cell types resulted in cell surface and Cys109 disulfide bridge-linked homodimers with major architectural features of the crystal dimer, as demonstrated by cross-linking experiments. 4F2hc has no significant hydrophobic patches at the surface. Monomer and homodimer have a polarized charged surface. The N terminus of the solved structure, including the position of Cys109 residue located four residues apart from the transmembrane domain, is adjacent to the positive face of the ectodomain. This location of the N terminus and the Cys109-intervening disulfide bridge imposes space restrictions sufficient to support a model for electrostatic interaction of the 4F2hc ectodomain with membrane phospholipids. These results provide the first crystal structure of heteromeric amino acid transporters and suggest a dynamic interaction of the 4F2hc ectodomain with the plasma membrane."

Together with the universally conserved SRP particle, FtsY is responsible for the cotranslational targeting of many integral membrane proteins that are consequently inserted into the membrane via the SecYEG translocon (1Luirink J.

In addition, recent studies identified interactions between the SRP receptor and the translocon in the endoplasmic reticulum (10Snapp E.L. Kim G.A. Bogert B.A. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Hegde R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and in E. coli (11Angelini S. Kim S. Koch H.G.

These observations thus underscore the central role of FtsY in ribosome targeting and biogenesis of membrane proteins (13Herskovits A.A. Kim E.S. Bibi E. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 927-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, despite extensive genetic, biochemical, and structural studies, important aspects of the function of FtsY are not yet fully understood. FtsY contains three distinct domains: the C-terminal N- and G-domains (together 302 residues long), which constitute a universally conserved SRP-GTPase (14Montoya G. Kim C. Luirink J. Sinning I. Nature. 1997; 385: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), and an N-terminal A-domain (195 residues long) that was shown to be dispensable under various growth conditions (15Eitan A. Kim E. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2492-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). At steady state, FtsY is distributed between the cytoplasm and the membrane (16Luirink J. Kim C.M. van der Weijden C.C. Oudega B. High S. Dobberstein B. Kusters R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2289-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), and it has no known membrane anchor partner homologous to the mammalian β-subunit of the SRP receptor (SR-β), which coordinates the transfer of ribosomes translating SRP substrates to the translocon (17Fulga T.A. Kim I. Dobberstein B. Pool M.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2338-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, various studies have suggested that FtsY functions as a membrane-bound receptor (18Zelazny A. Kim A. Cooper A. Bibi E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Demel R. de Kruijff B. Oudega B. Luirink J. Sinning I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 531-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), possibly through the N-domain (22Millman J.S. Kim D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33227-33234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), an interaction that seems to be dominated by electrostatic forces (21de Leeuw E. Kim K. Moser C.

However, the precise lipid-interacting domain in FtsY has not been defined, and the mechanism and functional role of lipid binding to the receptor remain elusive. Interestingly, an A-domain-truncated version of FtsY (termed NG+1) that is functional in vivo was identified by deletion analysis (15Eitan A. Kim E. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2492-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Removal of the N-terminal amino acid Phe2 (hereafter termed Phe196 according to the sequence of wild-type FtsY) from NG+1 inactivated the receptor (termed NG). In the present study, we describe comparative structure/function analyses of the two mutants, which shed light on the mechanism underlying FtsY interaction with membrane lipids and revealed an essential and autonomous lipid-binding domain of the receptor. Materials—Antibodies to FtsY were described previously (6Herskovits A.A. Kim E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4621-4626Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).

Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6025-6029Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) were digested with XhoI and NcoI, respectively, treated with Klenow, and cleaved again with HindIII. The large fragment released from pET-14b and the small fragment from pTftsY were ligated to produce plasmid pET-14b(6His-FtsY). The resultant plasmid was cut with NcoI and HindIII, and the small fragment was ligated with the large fragment released from pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) cut with the same enzymes to create plasmid pGEX(6His-FtsY). Mutant NG was generated by PCR with pGEX(6His-FtsY) as a template, using the 5′ primer: 5′-ttataccatggcgcgcctgaaacgcagcctg and a homologous 3′ primer. The PCR fragment was cloned into pGEX(6His-FtsY) by NcoI and SacII digestion, to create pGEX(NG). Mutant NG+1 was created by two stages of PCR using pGEX(FtsY-NG) as a template with two internal primers: 5′-agtattccatgttcgcgcgcctgaaacg and 5′-tcaggcgcgcgaacatggaatactgtttcc, and two external primers: 5′-tggctggagtgcgatcttcctg and 5′-tgtggtttccacacccacatcgg. The final PCR product was cloned into pGEX(FtsY-NG) by Bsu36I and BspEI digestion to create PGEX(NG+1). A plain vector was prepared from pGEX(FtsY-NG) by digestion with NcoI and AvaI, Klenow treatment, and self-ligation of the large fragment. The indicated mutations were created by site-directed PCR mutagenesis using pGEX(NG) or PGEX(NG+1) as templates. PGEX(NG+1)(R198C/D479C) was prepared by digesting PGEX(NG+1)(R198C) with BspEI and Bsu36I and ligating the 0.5-kb fragment with the 4.8-kb fragment of PGEX(NG+1)(D479C) digested with the same enzymes. Plasmids used for protein expression and purification were prepared as follows: the coding region of LacIq was amplified by PCR on pGEX-2T with the 5′ primer 5′-aataataacatgtaattccgacaccatcgaatggtgc and the 3′ primer 5′-aattattacatgtccacacaacatacgagccggaagc. The PCR product and plasmid pT7-5 were digested with AflIII and ligated. The resultant plasmid was digested by EcoRI and BamHI and ligated with the NG or NG+1 encoding genes from pGEX(NG) or PGEX(NG+1), which were PCR-amplified with the 5′ primer 5′-aatataagaattcgccgacatcataacggttctggc and the 3′ primer 5′-tataataggatccatcgataagcttgggctgcagg and digested by the same enzymes. The final constructs were pT7-5(NG) and pT7-5(NG+1). To tag the mutants by a 6-histidine extension at the C termini of these mutants we amplified the 3′ region of the ftsY gene with the 5′ primer 5′-ttaatccggatttatcagcctgttccgc and the 3′ primer 5′-aattacgcgttaatgatgatgatgatgatggtcctctcgggcaaaaagtgcc, and both the PCR products and pT7-5(NG) and pT7-5(NG+1) were digested with MluI and BspEI and ligated to create pT7-5(NG-6H) and pT7-5(NG+1-6H). pT7-5(NG+1-6H) was used for expression and purification of NG+1 for crystallization. To construct tagged mutants we used a 5′ primer, 5′-aatataagaattcgccgacatcataacggttctggc, and a 3′ primer, 5′-tgtggtttccacacccacatcgg, for PCR amplification using as templates pGEX(NG+1)(R198C), PGEX(NG+1)(F196A), and PGEX(NG+1)(F196I). Each of the PCR products and pT7-5(NG+1-6H) were digested with EcoRI and BspEI and ligated to produce pT7-5(NG+1-R198C-6H), pT7-5(NG+1-F196A-6H), and pT7-5(NG+1-F196I-6H). All the mutations were verified by sequencing through the PCR-generated segments, or the Klenow-treated ligation junctions. For mutating the amphipathic helix in NG+1 (NG+1/quadro), R198L, K200L, K205L, and K207L were replaced. This construct was created by one-step PCR using PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and mutagenic primers that together encode the four mutations: sense, 5′-ctgttactgaccctggaaaatctcggttccgga and antisense, 5′-gctgcgcagcagcagcgcgaacatggaatactg. The PCR product was then treated with DpnI endonuclease for the digestion of methylated, non-mutated parental DNA templates, purified from 0.8% agarose gel, and ligated. Next, the ligation mixture was transformed into E. coli HB101, and purified plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. A similar procedure was utilized for deleting the helix from full-length FtsY (Phe196-Lys207). Growth Experiments and FtsY Complementation Studies—Cultures were grown at 37 °C in LB medium, supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml), kanamycin (10 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (10 μg/ml), and spectinomycin (33 μg/ml) when necessary. For growth experiments in liquid media, cells were grown overnight at 37 °C, and then diluted to 0.01 A600. In experiments with E. coli FJP10, cells were diluted to A600 of 0.025. FtsY complementation experiments were executed by plating transformed E. coli FJP10 (23Herskovits A.A. Kim A. Rajsbaum R. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Henrichs T. Bochkareva E.S. Phillips G.J. Probst F.J.

Cell Fractionation Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Harvested cultures were washed in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and resuspended in the same buffer. Cell suspensions were sonicated, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation (5 min at 13,000 rpm). Membranes were collected by ultracentrifugation (45 min at 150,000 × g). SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (6Herskovits A.A. Kim E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4621-4626Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Construction and Purification of Thioredoxin Mutants—Plasmid petM20 containing the sequence for E. coli thioredoxin (Trx-a, kindly provided by Gunter Stier, EMBL, Germany Heidelberg) was digested with MscI and XbaI. The small fragment released containing the Trx sequence was used as a template for a PCR utilizing a forward primer, 5′-ggaaggcccatgggtagcgataaaattattcacct, and a reverse primer, 5′-cgggatccattagtggtggtggtggtggtggccctgaaaataaagattctcggccaggttagcgtcgagga. Via the PCR, a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease site, a 6-histidine tag, and a BamHI cleavage site were introduced in the 3′-end, and an NcoI site was introduced at the 5′-end. The resulting PCR product was digested with NcoI and BamHI and ligated into vector pETM13 (kindly provided by Gunter Stier) digested with the same enzymes. NG+1-Trx was constructed by using the PCR template described above and the primers 5′-ggaaggcacatgttcgcgcgcctgaaacgcagcctgttaaaaaccaaagaaaatctcggtagcgataaaattattcacctg and 5′-cgggatccattaatggtgatggtgatggtgggccaggttagcgtcgagg, which introduce a 5′-end PciI restriction site and a 3′-end BamHI site and a 6-histidine tag. The PCR product was digested with PciI and BamHI and then ligated into the pET24d Vector (Novagen) cut by NcoI and BamHI. NG-Trx was constructed by using the PCR template described above and the primers 5′-ggaaggccatggcgcgcctgaaacgcagcctgttaaaaaccaaagaaaatctcggtagcgataaaattattcacctg and 5′-cgggatccattaatggtgatggtgatggtgggccaggttagcgtcgagg, which introduce a 5′ NcoI cleavage site, a 3′ BamHI cleavage site and a 6-histidine tag. The PCR product was digested with NcoI and BamHI and ligated into the pET24d vector (Novagen) cut by NcoI and BamHI. The final constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Proteins were overexpressed in E. coli BL21/DE3, nucleic acids were precipitated after cell lysis with protamine sulfate, and the proteins were purified by nickel affinity chromatography and gel filtration as described for NG FtsY (24Montoya G. Kim C. Luirink J. Sinning I. Proteins. 1997; 28: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of the A-domain (FtsY 1-188)—A Factor Xa cleavage site (Q185I, Q187G, and E188R) was introduced into the plasmid containing FtsY6His (Luirink et al. 16Luirink J. Kim C.M. van der Weijden C.C. Oudega B. High S. Dobberstein B. Kusters R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2289-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) and the following primer pair: forward primer, 5′-ccggtggaagaaatcgctatcgagggtcgtaaaccgaccaaagaagg, and reverse primer, 5′-ccttctttggtcggtttacgaccctcgatagcgatttcttccaccgg. Cleavage of mutated FtsY with Factor Xa (400/1 (n/n), New England Biolabs) was carried out at 274 K for 60 h in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 1 mm CaCl2, 100 mm NaCl. Cleavage products were isolated by gel filtration on an S200 column (Amersham Biosciences) in 20 mm Tris/HCl, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2. Cleavage products were confirmed by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry and in-line static-light scattering (Wyatt Technologies). Binding to LUVs—Preparation of liposomes and flotation ultracentrifugation were carried out essentially as described previously (21de Leeuw E. Kim K. Moser C. Menestrina G. Demel R. de Kruijff B. Oudega B. Luirink J. Sinning I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 531-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified FtsY, NG, NG+1, Trx, NG-Trx, or NG+1-Trx (20 μg) were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 125 nmol (∼100 μg) of LUVs prepared from synthetic POPE (2-oleoyl-1-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine) and POPC (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-(phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)-ammonium salts) phospholipids (Sigma) in assay buffer (20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 240 mm sucrose). Samples were subjected to flotation analysis as described previously (28Valent Q.A. Kim P.A. High S. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. Lentzen G. Wintermeyer W. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: samples were mixed with 360 μl of assay buffer containing 30% iodixanol and overlaid with 1.16 ml of assay buffer containing 18% iodixanol and 450 μl of assay buffer. The gradient was collected in four fractions (600, 400, 400, and 600 μl) from the top. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, Coomassie staining, gels were photographed, and the bands were quantified with ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). The percentage of values given represents protein found in the top fraction (bound to liposomes). Site-directed Mutagenesis of the N Terminus of NG+1—As described previously (15Eitan A. Kim E. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2492-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the functional NG+1 mutant of FtsY was created by insertion of a single phenylalanine residue at position 2 of the inactive mutant NG (Phe196). The dramatic functional difference between NG and NG+1 was now investigated by mutating this phenylalanine in an attempt to explore the importance of the chemical properties at the N terminus of NG+1. The expression of selected mutants harboring hydrophobic and large (leucine, isoleucine, and tryptophan), small (alanine), or charged (lysine) residues at position 196 was examined by immunoblotting, and their activity was assayed by complementation of FtsY depletion (Fig. 1). The results (summarized in Table 1) indicated that a large hydrophobic residue is required at position 196. However, because additional truncation studies and characterization of other mutants indicated that the length of the N terminus might also be important (data not shown), we investigated f-Met processing of selected mutants. Briefly, NG, NG+1, and several of the active and nonactive mutants were purified using a C-terminal His6 tag, and the purified proteins were analyzed by N-terminal sequencing. As shown in Table 1, NG+1 and the functional constructs retained their N-terminal methionine. In contrast, the inactive mutants lost this methionine (NG, NG+1(F196A)). Together, the results suggest that the length of the N terminus of NG might be important, as well as a large hydrophobic residue at position 196. To evaluate these conclusions and investigate possible structural requirements at the N terminus of NG, we crystallized NG+1.TABLE 1Characterization of the various FtsY mutantsMutantActivityExpressionN-terminal sequencewt FtsY++++NG–++ARLKNG+1++++MFARLKNG+1(R198C)–/++++MFACLKNG+1(D479C)++++NG+1(R198C/D479C)–/++++NG+1(D479A)+++++NG+1(D479R)++++NG+1(F196A)–+++AARLKNG+1(F196L)++++NG+1(F196I)++++MIARLKNG+1(F196W)+++NG+1(F196K)–+++NG+1(F196L/A197E)+++ Open table in a new tab Structural Differences between NG and NG+1—In the crystal structure of NG from E. coli FtsY the N terminus is not ordered (14Montoya G. Kim C. Luirink J. Sinning I. Nature. 1997; 385: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). For a direct assessment of the observed differences between NG and NG+1, we crystallized and solved the structure of NG+1 at 1.9-Å resolution (supplemental Table S2). A comparison with the NG structure (1FTS (14Montoya G. Kim C. Luirink J. Sinning I. Nature. 1997; 385: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar)) revealed that, unlike NG (Fig. 2A), the N terminus of NG+1 is well ordered and forms a regular α-helix (Fig. 2B). Apart from this N-terminal peptide, the overall structures of NG and NG+1 are identical (the root mean square deviation between the 295 Cα atoms of residues 201-495 is 0.54 Å). Interestingly, the structure of NG+1 also reveals a polar interaction between Arg198 and Asp479 (Fig. 2C). Arg198 is located at the ordered N terminus of NG+1, and Asp479 is part of the closing loop (G5) of the GTPase. The N- and C-terminal helices are in proximity (Fig. 2D), and this interaction might be involved in regulation of the GTPase, as suggested earlier (29Gariani T. Kim T. Sauer-Eriksson A.E. J. Struct. Biol. 2006; 153: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 30Gawronski-Salerno J. Kim J.S. Focia P.J. Freymann D.M. Proteins. 2007; 66: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 31Reyes C.L. Kim E. Walter P. Stroud R.M. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e607Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Taken together, comparison of the three-dimensional structures and the results presented above enabled us to draw the following conclusions: (i) the Arg198-Asp479 interaction might be important for the functional assembly of the receptor, (ii) this interaction might also facilitate the formation of a regular α-helix, and (iii) the α-helical N terminus might be important for NG+1 function. These possibilities were explored further (see below). Importantly, the recently solved structure of the full-length FtsY 7R. Parlitz and I. Sinning, unpublished data. revealed that the N-terminal α-helix of NG+1 is part of an authentic structural element of the wild-type receptor, where the helix is even longer. Moreover, a comparison with recent structures of FtsY from Mycoplasma mycoides (29Gariani T. Kim T. Sauer-Eriksson A.E. J. Struct. Biol. 2006; 153: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and Thermotoga maritima (Joint Center for Structural Genomics, PDB entry code: 1vma) indicates that this helix is conserved in FtsY homologues. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The interaction between Arg198 and Asp479 (Fig. 2C) was not observed in the NG structure (14Montoya G. Kim C. Luirink J. Sinning I. Nature. 1997; 385: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and could be of structural and functional relevance. Sequence alignment shows that Asp479 is universally conserved, whereas Arg198 is partially conserved among SRP receptors (data not shown). We performed non-conservative replacements at positions Asp479 and Arg198, independently and simultaneously, to analyze the importance of these residues. The mutants were expressed (Fig. 3A), and their in vivo functions were tested by complementing FtsY depletion. Surprisingly, replacement of the fully conserved residue Asp479 for cysteine (D479C), alanine (D479A), or even arginine (D479R) did not have any appreciable effect on NG+1 function in vivo (Fig. 3B). In contrast, replacing residue Arg198 had a dramatic inhibitory effect. Mutation R198C strongly inhibited the function of NG+1, and mutant R198D could not even be constructed, possibly due to its toxicity even under non-induced, basal expression levels. These results indicated that the observed interaction between Arg198 and Asp479 is not essential for NG+1 function, but might contribute to the stability of the NG+1 structure. The observation that the functional mutant D479R could not be crystallized, due to aggregation of the purified protein at elevated concentrations, might further support this notion, although additional studies are required to establish the structural role of the Arg198-Asp479 interaction. The N Terminus of NG+1 Forms a Class A Amphipathic Helix—A more detailed analysis of the N-terminal sequence of NG+1 reveals the presence of a class A amphipathic helix (Fig. 4). Class A amphipathic helices have a distinct charge distribution on their polar face, containing a negative charge that is typically flanked by positive charges. The positive charges interact preferentially with the negatively charged head groups of anionic phospholipids, thereby anchoring the helix to the membrane (32Segrest J.P. Kim H. Dohlman J.G. Brouillette C.G. Anantharamaiah G.M. Proteins. 1990; 8: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). The polar face of the N-terminal helix in NG+1 contains the characteristic positive charges (Arg198, Lys200, Arg210, Lys205, and Lys207) as well as a negative charge (Glu208). The hydrophobic face is mainly formed by Met195, Phe196, Leu199, and Leu203. The inactive mutants (Table 1) have significantly reduced hydrophobicity at their N termini (Fig. 4). NG lacks both Met195 and Phe196. The F196A mutant lacks Met195, and the alanine at position 196 cannot compensate for the loss of the aromatic side chain. The F196K mutant should contain Met195 according to the rules of f-Met processing (33Hirel P.H. Kim M.J. Dessen P. Fayat G. Blanquet S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8247-8251Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar), but replacing Phe196 by a lysine destroys the amphipathic character of the helix. All in vivo active mutants have Phe196 replaced by larger hydrophobic residues, in addition to Met195 (as shown for F196I). Multiple sequence alignments of FtsY show that a motif of 13 amino acid residues, which corresponds to the amphipathic helix observed in the NG+1 structure, is conserved in eubacteria, archea, and chloroplasts (Fig. 5A). Yet we noticed that the negative charge (Glu208) is not fully conserved. It was proposed that, although the negative charge is not essential for interaction with lipids, when present, it enhances binding of the amphipathic helix to membranes by repulsion, pushing the helix further down in between the head groups and the carbon chains of the lipid layer (32Segrest J.P. Kim H. Dohlman J.G. Brouillette C.G. Anantharamaiah G.M. Proteins. 1990; 8: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a similar functionally important motif (termed membrane-targeting sequence (MTS)) was described previously for the conserved cell division determinant MinD (34Szeto T.H. Kim S.L. Rothfield L.I. King G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15693-15698Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 35Szeto T.H. Kim S.L. Habrukowich C.L. King G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40050-40056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). MinD is an ATPase closely related to FtsY, because both are members of the SIMIBI class of NTP-binding proteins (36Leipe D.D. Kim Y.I. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 41-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Notably, certain MTS sequences are similar to the amphipathic helix of FtsY (Fig. 5B). However, unlike in FtsY, MinD proteins harbor the amphipathic helix at their C termini. Interaction with LUVs—The results described above strongly suggest that the N-terminal helix of NG+1 is involved in the documented interaction of the receptor with lipids (21de Leeuw E. Kim K. Moser C. M"
https://openalex.org/W1994113226,"Oligomerization of the Class II G protein-coupled secretin receptor has been reported, but the molecular basis for this and its functional significance have not been determined. In the current work, we have examined the possible contribution of each of the transmembrane (TM) segments of this receptor to its homo-oligomerization, using the method of competitive disruption screening for inhibition of receptor bioluminescence resonance energy transfer signal. TM IV was the only segment that was found to disrupt receptor bioluminescence resonance energy transfer. Evaluation of predicted interhelical and lipid-exposed faces of this TM segment demonstrated that its lipid-exposed face represented the determinant for oligomerization. This was further confirmed by mutagenesis of the intact secretin receptor. Morphological FRET was utilized to demonstrate that secretin receptor oligomerization occurred at the cell surface and that this oligomerization was disrupted by mutating Gly(243) and Ile(247), key residues within the lipid-exposed face of TM IV. Although disruption of the receptor oligomerization interface had no effect on secretin binding parameters, it reduced the ability of secretin to stimulate intracellular cAMP. This supports a clear functional effect of oligomerization of this receptor. Such an effect might be particularly relevant to clinical situations in which this receptor is overexpressed, such as in certain neoplasms."
https://openalex.org/W2147373645,"A novel ArsR-SmtB family transcriptional repressor, KmtR, has been characterized from mycobacteria. Mutants of Mycobacterium tuberculosis lacking kmtR show elevated expression of Rv2025c encoding a deduced CDF-family metal exporter. KmtR-dependent repression of the cdf and kmtR operator-promoters was alleviated by nickel and cobalt in minimal medium. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and fluorescence anisotropy show binding of purified KmtR to nucleotide sequences containing a region of dyad symmetry from the cdf and kmtR operator-promoters. Incubation of KmtR with cobalt inhibits DNA complex assembly and metal-protein binding was confirmed. KmtR is the second, to NmtR, characterized ArsR-SmtB sensor of nickel and cobalt from M. tuberculosis suggesting special significance for these ions in this pathogen. KmtR-dependent expression is elevated in complete medium with no increase in response to metals, whereas NmtR retains a response to nickel and cobalt under these conditions. KmtR has tighter affinities for nickel and cobalt than NmtR consistent with basal levels of these metals being sensed by KmtR but not NmtR in complete medium. More than a thousand genes encoding ArsR-SmtB-related proteins are listed in databases. KmtR has none of the previously defined metal-sensing sites. Substitution of His88, Glu101, His102, His110, or His111 with Gln generated KmtR variants that repress the cdf and kmtR operator-promoters even in elevated nickel and cobalt, revealing a new sensory site. Importantly, ArsR-SmtB sequence groupings do not correspond with the different sensory motifs revealing that only the latter should be used to predict metal sensing."

Our results suggest that the efficiency with which APE1 can process an AP site in vivo is limited by the rate at which it diffuses to the site and that a slow step after chemistry may prevent APE1 from leaving the site of damage before the next enzyme arrives to continue the repair process.

APE1 is an endonuclease that functions within the base excision repair (BER) pathway to initiate the repair of abasic (AP) sites in DNA (reviewed in Refs. 1Wilson III, D.M. Barsky D. Mutat. Res. 2001; 485: 283-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar and 2Evans A.R. Limp-Foster M. Kelley M.R. Mutat. Res. 2000; 461: 83-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The BER pathway is a series of enzymatically catalyzed reactions used by cells to remove and replace damaged or lost bases (reviewed in Ref. 3Krokan H.E. Nilsen H. Skorpen F. Otterlei M. Slupphaug G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). APE1 catalyzes the hydrolysis of the sugar-phosphate backbone of DNA 5′ to an AP site. The 3′ end of the nick generated in the damaged DNA strand can then be extended by a DNA polymerase to replace the damaged or missing base. Human APE1 is homologous to Escherichia coli EXOIII (4Demple B. Herman T. Chen D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11450-11454Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 5Robson C.N. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5519-5523Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), and like EXOIII, it possesses 3′-5′-exonuclease activity as well as 3′-phosphatase and 3′-phosphodiesterase activities (6Seki S. Hatsushika M. Watanabe S. Akiyama K. Nagao K. Tsutsui K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1131: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Unlike E. coli EXOIII, the AP endonuclease activity of human APE1 is far more robust than any of its other repair activities (7Kane C.M. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3405-3414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). APE1 also has several other functions in the cell beyond its DNA repair functions and has been shown to stimulate the DNA binding activity of certain transcription factors (AP-1 (FOS/JUN), Egr-1, NF-κb, and p53). APE1 can act as a transcription factor itself and bind to promoters containing negative Ca2+-response elements (8Bhakat K.K. Izumi T. Yang S.H. Hazra T.K. Mitra S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6299-6309Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 9Kuninger D.T. Izumi T. Papaconstantinou J. Mitra S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 823-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Finally, a truncated form of APE1 with increased 3′-to 5′-exonuclease activity and increased endonuclease activity on undamaged DNA has been implicated in the fragmentation of the genome associated with apoptosis (10Yoshida A. Urasaki Y. Waltham M. Bergman A.C. Pourquier P. Rothwell D.G. Inuzuka M. Weinstein J.N. Ueda T. Appella E. Hickson I.D. Pommier Y. J. Biol.

All of the above functions of APE1 have been found to be essential for cell viability and/or cell division and differentiation (12Izumi T. Brown D.B. Naidu C.V. Bhakat K.K. Macinnes M.A. Saito H. Chen D.J. Mitra S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5739-5743Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 13Zou G.M. Luo M.H. Reed A. Kelley M.R. Yoder M.C. Blood. 2007; 109: 1917-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). APE1-null mice or mouse embryonic stem cells could not be made because these embryos had significant developmental flaws and lost viability at about embryonic day 5.5 (14Xanthoudakis S. Smeyne R.J. Wallace J.D. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8919-8923Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Studies using RNA interference to reduce the levels of APE1 in several human cell types have shown that reduction of APE1 expression halted cell proliferation, resulted in an accumulation of AP sites in DNA, and stimulated cell death via apoptosis (15Fung H. Demple B. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 463-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Although the role of APE1 in base excision repair has been fairly well defined, the mechanism by which APE1 catalyzes the hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bond 5′ to an AP site has not been characterized as extensively. Questions as simple as how fast the hydrolysis reaction is remain to be answered. Presumably, hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bond requires mechanisms for 1) activating a water molecule or perhaps another nucleophile for attack on the phosphoryl group, 2) stabilizing a charge that builds up on what is most likely a pentameric phosphoryl transition state, and 3) donating a proton to the leaving group (3′-alkoxide). Divalent cations could perform some of these functions and are required for the AP endonuclease activity of APE1, but the number required and their role in catalysis is not clear. Depending on the pH, crystalline forms of the enzyme contain either one or two divalent cations in the active site (16Mol C.D. Izumi T. Mitra S. Tainer J.A. Nature. 2000; 403: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 17Beernink P.T. Segelke B.W. Hadi M.Z. Erzberger J.P. Wilson III, D.M. Rupp B. J. Mol.

Amino acid residues serving as general acids and/or general bases could also perform these functions in catalysis, and structural and mutagenesis studies have suggested that His-309 and Asp-210 could function in this capacity. His-309 has been proposed to hydrogen-bond to an oxygen on the phosphoryl moiety to stabilize charge in the transition state, and mutation of His-309 to Asn reduces steady-state AP endonuclease rates by 30,000-fold (19Lowry D.F.

First, it may activate a water molecule for attack on the phosphoryl, and second, it may subsequently protonate the 3′-alkoxide leaving group. Mutation of Asp-210 to Ala reduces the steady-state AP endonuclease activity by 25,000-fold (21Erzberger J.P. Wilson III, D.M. J. Mol.

As an initial step in defining the kinetic mechanism of APE1 and the contributions of two amino acid residues, His-309 and Asp-210, to catalysis, pre-steady-state kinetics of AP site incision and equilibrium binding to AP site-containing DNA were measured for wild-type and mutant enzymes. Preparation of 32P-labeled DNA Substrates and APE1 Proteins—All DNA substrates were of the sequence 5′-GCGTCAAAATGTFGGTATTTCCATG-3′, in which F indicates the position of tetrahydrofuran, a reduced abasic site analog. DNA duplexes were labeled on the 5′ end of the damaged strand with 32P and annealed to a complementary oligonucleotide containing an thymine opposite tetrahydrofuran as in Refs. 23Abner C.W. Lau A.Y.

Feller J.A. Bloom L.B. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2007; 6: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). APE1 Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate APE1 mutants with specific amino acid changes in the active site. The pET-14b plasmid containing the APE1 sequence was mutagenized using the QuikChange (Stratagene) site-directed mutagenesis kit following the manufacturer's protocol. Histidine 309 was replaced with asparagine (H309N) using two primers of the sequence 5′-ccc tcg gca gtg ata act gtc cta tca ccc t-3′ and 5′-agg gtg ata gga cag tta tca ctg ccg agg g-3′ (Integrated DNA Technologies). Aspartic acid 210 was replaced with alanine (D210A) using two primers of the sequence 5′-cct tgt gct gtg tgg agc act caa tgt ggc aca tg-3′ and 5′-cat gtg cca cat tga gtg ctc cac aca gca caa gg-3′ (Integrated DNA Technologies). Fluorescence Anisotropy Binding Assays—An oligonucleotide 25 nucleotides in length of the sequence 5′-GCGTCAAAATGTFGGTATTTCCATG-3′ containing tetrahydrofuran, a reduced abasic site analog, indicated by F at position 13, was annealed to a complementary strand that contains a T opposite the AP site. This complement was labeled with X-rhodamine via an amino linker on the 5 position of a thymine two nucleotides from the 5′ end. These two strands were mixed in equal molar amounts in 50 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, heated to 80 °C, and annealed through slow cooling to room temperature. Anisotropy measurements were obtained using a QuantaMaster QM-1 fluorometer (Photon Technology International) equipped with a 75-watt xenon arc lamp, an excitation monochromator, and dual emission monochromators. The excitation monochromator was set to 580 nm with a band pass of 8 nm leading to the cuvette. The dual monochromators, set in line with the photomultiplies tubes, were set to 610 nm with a band pass of 8 nm leading to the photomultiplies tube. All binding reactions had a final volume of 80 μl. Labeled substrate was diluted into the cuvette in binding buffer (50 mm HEPES pH 8, 100 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 20 mm EDTA) to a final concentration of 20 or 40 nm. Anisotropy of the free DNA was calculated according to Equation 1, in which Ivv is the intensity of the vertically polarized emission and Ivh is the intensity of the horizontally polarized emission when exciting with vertically polarized light, and Equation 2, in which g is a correction factor to account for differences in the efficiencies of the two detectors. The g factor was calculated from the intensities of vertically, Ihv, and horizontally, Ihh, polarized emission measured using horizontally polarized excitation light. APE1 was added in various concentrations, and the “bound” anisotropy was calculated just as for the free DNA. These data were then globally fit to Equation 3, using Prism (GraphPad software), to determine the Kd in which Kd is the dissociation constant, Et is the total enzyme concentration, Dt is the total DNA concentration, robs is the observed anisotropy, rb is the maximum anisotropy, and rf is the anisotropy of the unbound DNA. robs=Ivv−gIvhIvv+2gIvh(Eq. 1) g=IhvIhh(Eq. 2) robs=((Kd+Et+Dt)−((Kd+Et+Dt)2−4EtDt)2Dt)×(rb−rf)+rf(Eq. 3) Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Binding Assays—A 25-mer oligonucleotide containing tetrahydrofuran was labeled at the 5′ end with 32P as described above and annealed to a complementary strand with a thymine opposite tetrahydrofuran. This substrate was then mixed at room temperature with various amounts of APE1 in electrophoretic mobility shift assay buffer (50 mm HEPES pH 8, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 20 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Aliquots of the binding mixtures were loaded into a 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Polyacrylamide electrophoresis was performed at 4 °C at 8 V/cm2 for 90 min. Gels were visualized and quantified using the Storm PhosphorImager and ImageQuant analysis software (Amersham Biosciences). Data were fit to Equation 4 using SigmaPlot (Systat Software) to determine the Kdapp in which [ED] is the concentration of the DNA bound by the enzyme, Kdapp is the apparent dissociation constant, Et is the total enzyme concentration, and Dt is the total DNA concentration. ED]=(Kdapp+Et+Dt)−(Kdapp+Et+Dt)2−4EtDt)2(Eq. 4) APE1 AP Endonuclease Activity Assays—APE1 endonuclease activity assays were performed using the KinTek RQF-3 rapid quench instrument (KinTek) in constant quench mode. APE1 and tetrahydrofuran containing DNA were mixed in a reaction buffer containing 50 mm HEPES pH 8, 100 mm KCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Reactions were quenched using 0.2 m NaOH. Two volumes of 96% formamide, 20 mm EDTA were added to quenched reactions, which were then heated to 95 °C for 10 min. Substrates were separated from products by denaturing PAGE on 12% acrylamide, 8 m urea gels. Gels were visualized and quantified using a Storm PhosphorImager and ImageQuant analysis software (Amersham Biosciences). The concentration of sodium hydroxide necessary to effectively quench the reaction was determined empirically by titrating the quencher. In one series of experiments done in duplicate, reactions containing 20 nm AP-DNA and 1,000 nm APE1 were quenched after 2 ms with 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 m NaOH. In the absence of quencher, substrate was completely converted to product (98.8%), whereas the sodium hydroxide quencher stopped reactions with about the same efficiency at all concentrations tested. Concentrations of 0.05 and 0.1 m NaOH limited the percentage of substrate converted to product to 80.8 ± 0.2%, and concentrations of 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 m NaOH limited product formation to 79.3 ± 0.5%. AP endonuclease activity assays for the APE1 mutants were done using hand mixing techniques with the same buffers and conditions used in the assays for the wild-type enzyme. Multiple-turnover assays for wild-type APE1 were fit by single exponentials plus linear steady-state phases (Equation 5). Single-turnover data for wild-type APE1 were fit to double exponentials (Equation 6), and single-turnover data for APE1 mutants were fit to single exponentials (Equation 7). Curve fitting was done using SigmaPlot (Systat Software), and figures were made using Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software). y=a(1−e−kt)+st(Eq. 5) y=a(1−e−k1t)+b(1−e−k2t)(Eq. 6) y=a(1−e−kt)(Eq. 7) Equilibrium Binding to AP Site DNA—A fluorescence anisotropy-based binding assay was employed to determine the binding affinity of APE1 for DNA duplexes containing an AP site (AP-DNA). Duplex DNA contained a single reduced abasic site analog, tetrahydrofuran, at position 13. APE1 binds both natural and reduced AP sites and catalyzes hydrolysis of the 5′-phosphodiester bond (25Wilson III, D.M. Takeshita M. Grollman A.P. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16002-16007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The reduced AP site was used in these assays because it is less reactive and more stable than the natural AP site. Duplexes were covalently labeled with X-rhodamine (RhX) via an amino linker on the 5-position of a thymine located on the strand complementary to the AP-containing strand, two nucleotides from the 5′ end. Binding of WT APE1 to AP-DNA was determined by measuring the anisotropy of the RhX probe in assays containing either 20 or 40 nm AP-DNA in the presence of 20 mm EDTA to inhibit strand incision. Given that the APE1-AP-DNA complex is larger and tumbles more slowly than free AP-DNA, the anisotropy of the RhX reporter increases as the fraction of bound DNA increases (26Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Second. Kluwer Academic/Plenum, New York1999Crossref Google Scholar). Binding data from four independent experiments were globally fit to a single dissociation constant (Equation 3) yielding a Kd value of 11 ± 2nm for WT APE1 (Fig. 1). Binding to undamaged DNA was not detectable under conditions used in Fig. 1 (data not shown), and therefore, this Kd value reflects a specific interaction with AP-DNA. Multiple-turnover AP Site Incision Assays—Incision 5′ to a reduced AP site by APE1 was measured under pre-steady-state multiple-turnover conditions in which AP-DNA was present in excess over enzyme. AP endonuclease reactions were initiated by the rapid addition of APE1 to 32P-labeled DNA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Time courses for product formation were measured by rapidly quenching reactions in sodium hydroxide after different incubation times, separating DNA substrates from products by denaturing PAGE and phosphorimaging. Two series of reactions were done. One series (Fig. 2, upper panel) contained 40 nm APE1 and 80, 160, 250, 350, or 500 nm AP-DNA, and the second series (Fig. 2, lower panel) contained 200 nm APE1 and 500, 1,000, or 2,000 nm AP-DNA. Time courses for both series of reactions gave a rapid burst of product followed by a linear increase in the amount of product. This kinetic behavior shows that the first round of conversion of substrate to product occurs rapidly but that some step following the chemical step limits the rate at which APE1 can dissociate from product and catalyze subsequent rounds of incision. The overall rate of product formation in the rapid pre-steady-state phase of the reaction increased with increasing DNA concentrations. However, due to difficulty in quantitating the relatively small fraction of substrate converted to product in the burst phase of the reactions, particularly at high DNA concentrations, rates obtained from empirical fits of these data (Fig. 2, solid curves) to an exponential plus a linear rise (Equation 5) contain considerable error. That being said, these fits indicated that the pre-steady-state burst rate was greater than 200 s–1 in reactions containing 200 nm APE1 and 500 nm AP-DNA (legend for Fig. 2). Steady-state rate constants for the linear phase of product formation were 1.4 ± 0.1 and 2.3 ± 0.4 s–1 for experiments done at 40 and 200 nm APE1, respectively, or about 2 orders of magnitude slower than the observed rate for the pre-steady-state burst. Another notable feature of both series of reactions was that the burst amplitudes were less than one enzyme equivalent of product. The amplitudes for reactions containing 40 nm APE1 are just under 30 nm, and the amplitudes for reactions containing 200 nm APE1 are less than 150 nm. One explanation for burst amplitudes that are less than one enzyme equivalent in multiple-turnover reactions is that the total protein concentration determined from the absorbance at 280 nm (see “Experimental Procedures”) is greater than the concentration of active enzyme. APE1-AP-DNA Binding under Stoichiometric Conditions–To test possibility that the active site concentration of APE1 was less than the total protein concentration, binding of APE1 to AP-DNA was measured under stoichiometric conditions using the RhX anisotropy-based assay. Binding reactions contained 1,000 nm AP-DNA in the presence of 20 mm EDTA to inhibit the incision reaction. Fig. 3 shows the average results for two independent experiments. The increase in anisotropy due to APE1-AP-DNA binding reaches a maximum at a concentration of about 1,000 nm APE1 or an enzyme:DNA ratio of about 1:1 and does not increase further. The simplest interpretation of this result is that the enzyme is at least 90% active, and the enzyme binds AP-DNA as a monomer. This result suggests that the reduced burst amplitudes in multiple-turnover incision reactions may not stem from a reduction in the active site concentration relative to the total protein concentration. Single-turnover AP Site Incision Assays—Another explanation for burst amplitudes less than one enzyme equivalent in multiple-turnover experiments is an internal equilibrium between enzyme-substrate and enzyme-product complexes that arises from a significant rate of the reverse reaction relative to the forward reaction (27Johnson K.A. The Enzymes. 1992; 20: 1-60Crossref Scopus (379) Google Scholar). To test this possibility and to determine the maximal rate of incision 5′ to AP sites, the AP endonuclease reaction was measured under single-turnover conditions with enzyme in excess of DNA. Reactions contained 0.02 μm AP-DNA and APE1 concentrations ranging from 0.04 to 6 μm (Fig. 4) and were initiated by the rapid addition of AP-DNA to APE1. The overall rates of the AP endonuclease reactions increased with increasing enzyme concentrations; however, analysis of individual reaction progress curves showed that each was composed of two phases and was best fit by a double exponential rise to a maximum (Equation 6 and Fig. 4, solid curves through the data points). Data from a second independent series of single-turnover experiments gave the same results and are presented separately in supplemental Fig. 1 for clarity. The rate of the rapid phase increased linearly with enzyme concentration until a concentration of about 2 μm APE1, at which point rates became too fast to measure experimentally (Figs. 4 and 5). Given that the observed rates are a function the rates of both enzyme-DNA binding and formation of product in the enzyme active site (Fig. 5, steps a and b in the reaction scheme), a linear increase in rate with enzyme concentration indicates that enzyme-DNA binding and not chemistry is rate-limiting over this concentration range. A fit of the observed rates of the rapid phase as a function of enzyme concentration to a line (Fig. 5) yielded an apparent on-rate constant (slope) of 3.5 × 108 m–1 s–1 and an apparent off-rate constant (y intercept) 47 s–1 (27Johnson K.A. The Enzymes. 1992; 20: 1-60Crossref Scopus (379) Google Scholar). At concentrations greater than 2 μm APE1, about 70% of the substrate was consumed in the shortest time, 2 ms, that could be measured, and the majority of the rapid phase was already complete. This rapid reaction precluded determination of a maximal single-turnover rate, but it must be at least 850 s–1 to give rise to these data.FIGURE 5Plot of observed rate constants from fits of single-turnover data as a function of WT APE1 concentration. Observed rate constants calculated for the rapid phase of single-turnover data plotted in Fig. 4 and supplemental Fig. 1 were plotted as a function of APE1 concentration and fit (solid line) to a line. At concentrations greater than 2 μm APE1, accurate values for this observed rate constant could not be determined because the reactions were too fast. An apparent binding constant (kon,app of 3.5 × 108 m–1 s–1 and apparent dissociation constant (koff,app) of 47 s–1 were calculated from the slope and y intercept, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The amplitudes of each kinetic phase were also a function of enzyme concentration. At the lowest APE1 concentration, 0.04 μm, the amplitudes for the rapid and slow phases were about the same. As the APE1 concentration increased, the fraction of product turned over in the rapid phase, as measured by the amplitude, increased, whereas the amplitude of the slow phase decreased (Fig. 4 and supplemental Fig. 1). At APE1 concentrations greater than 2 μm, the amplitudes no longer changed with increasing APE1 concentrations and reached maximum values of about 16 nm product formed in the rapid phase and 4nm in the slow phase for reactions that contained 20 nm AP-DNA substrate. The biphasic nature of the single-turnover kinetic data is consistent with an internal equilibrium being established between enzyme-substrate and enzyme-product that requires an “irreversible” step to drive the reaction toward completion. The fraction of product formed in the rapid phase reflects product produced in the enzyme active site ((enzyme-product) EP), and the slow phase reflects the step that drives the pathway forward by limiting the reverse reaction. The observed rates of the slow phase showed a smaller dependence on enzyme concentration and increased from a value of about 4 s–1 at 0.4 μm APE1 to a maximum value of about 20–30 s–1 at APE1 concentrations of 0.5 μm and greater. Effects of Mutation of His-309 to Asn on APE1 DNA Binding and AP Endonuclease Activity—Binding of APE1-H309N to the same AP-DNA substrate used for WT APE1 in Fig. 1 was measured using the anisotropy-based binding assay. A Kd value of 53 ± 7nm was calculated from data shown in Fig. 6A, a value about 5-fold greater than that for WT APE1. Single-turnover AP site incision assays were performed for APE1-H309N as described for those with WT APE1 (Fig. 4); however, reactions catalyzed by the mutant were so slow that assays could be done by hand mixing rather than using a rapid-mixing apparatus. Results from experiments done using 20 nm AP-DNA and 100–1000 nm APE1-H309N are shown in Fig. 6B. In contrast to reactions with WT APE1, the rate of incision 5′ to the AP site reached a maximal value at saturating APE1-H309N concentrations. A fit of these data to a single exponential (Equation 7 and Fig. 6B, solid lines through data) yielded a maximal rate of 0.001 s–1. Effects of Mutation of Asp-210 to Ala on APE1 DNA Binding and AP Endonuclease Activity—Binding of APE1-D210A to AP-DNA was measured in the anisotropy-based equilibrium binding assay. A Kd value of 2.4 ± 1.3 nm was calculated from the binding isotherm shown in Fig. 7A. Given that the Kd value was about 10-fold lower than the absolute DNA concentration used in the binding assay, it was desirable to repeat the measurement at a lower DNA concentration to confirm this value. Because the fluorescence at low DNA concentrations was relatively weak, these experiments were done using 32P-labeled AP-DNA in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Radiolabeled AP-DNA (5 nm) was incubated with APE1-D210A at concentrations ranging from 1 to 20 nm in the presence of EDTA. Bound DNA was separated from free DNA by electrophoresis on non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels and quantitated by phosphorimaging. A fit of these data (Fig. 7B) to a quadratic equation (Equation 4) yielded a Kd value of 1.5 ± 0.4 nm in good agreement with the value of 2.4 ± 1.3 nm obtained from the anisotropy-based assay. These results show that APE1-D210A binds AP-DNA with about 5-fold greater affinity than WT APE1 and about 25-fold greater than APE1-H309N. AP endonuclease activity of APE1-D210A was measured in single-turnover assays as done for APE1-H309N in reactions containing 20 nm AP-DNA and up to 20 μm APE1-D210A. In the case of the D210A mutant, the incision reaction was much slower, and less than half the substrate was converted to product in 23 h (data not shown). Rates were not calculated based on these experiments because of the prolonged incubation times required and the possibility that loss of enzyme activity during the extended reaction could contribute to the kinetics. APE1 is the major enzyme in human cells responsible for initiating the repair of AP sites in DNA. Although much work has been done in characterizing the AP endonuclease activity under steady-state conditions, this is the first study to investigate the pre-steady-state kinetics of incision 5′ to AP sites by APE1. This work showed that the first turnover of substrate by APE1 is rapid"
https://openalex.org/W2030340060,"Lysosomal cysteine cathepsin B participates in numerous diverse cellular processes. In acquiring its activity, the proregion, which blocks the substrate-binding site in the proenzyme, needs to be cleaved off. Here we demonstrate that polyanionic polysaccharides, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), can accelerate the autocatalytic removal of the propeptide and subsequent activation of cathepsin B. We show that naturally occurring GAGs such as chondroitin sulfates and heparin, as well as the synthetic analog dextran sulfate, accelerate the processing in a concentration-dependent manner. Heparin oligosaccharides down to the size of tetrasaccharides were efficient in accelerating the procathepsin B processing, whereas disaccharides were without effect. Further, the ability of the GAGs to accelerate procathepsin B processing was sensitive to increasing NaCl concentrations, indicating that electrostatic interaction between the GAGs and procathepsin B are operative in the accelerating effect. Also the processing of the catalytic procathepsin B mutant by wild type cathepsin B was enhanced in the presence of GAGs, suggesting that GAGs induce a conformational change in procathepsin B, converting it into a better substrate. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that His(28), Lys(39), and Arg(40), located within the procathepsin B propeptide, have significant roles in the acceleration of procathepsin B activation induced by short GAGs. Because procathepsin B and GAGs often co-localize in vivo, we propose that GAGs may play a physiological role in the activation of procathepsin B."

We report the cloning and characterization of two Toxoplasma gondii farnesyl-diphosphate synthase (TgFPPS) homologs. A single genetic locus produces two transcripts, TgFPPS and TgFPPSi, by alternative splicing. Both isoforms were heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli, but only TgFPPS was active. The protein products predicted from the nucleotide sequences have 646 and 605 amino acids and apparent molecular masses of 69.5 and 64.5 kDa, respectively. Several conserved sequence motifs found in other prenyl-diphosphate synthases are present in both TgFPPSs. TgFPPS was also expressed in the baculovirus system and was biochemically characterized. In contrast to the FPPS of other eukaryotic organisms, TgFPPS is bifunctional, catalyzing the formation of both farnesyl diphosphate and geranylgeranyl diphosphate. TgFPPS localizes to the mitochondria, as determined by the co-localisation of the affinity-purified antibodies against the protein with MitoTracker, and in accord with the presence of an N-terminal mitochondria-targeting signal in the protein. This enzyme is an attractive target for drug development, because the order of inhibition of the enzyme by a number of bisphosphonates is the same as that for inhibition of parasite growth. In summary, we report the first bifunctional farnesyl-diphosphate/geranylgeranyl-diphosphate synthase identified in eukaryotes, which, together with previous results, establishes this enzyme as a valid target for the chemotherapy of toxoplasmosis.

In summary, we report the first bifunctional farnesyl-diphosphate/geranylgeranyl-diphosphate synthase identified in eukaryotes, which, together with previous results, establishes this enzyme as a valid target for the chemotherapy of toxoplasmosis. Toxoplasma gondii is a pathogenic protozoan parasite that infects a wide range of vertebrate hosts, including humans. T. gondii has been recognized as a major opportunistic pathogen of fetuses from recently infected mothers and of immunocompromised patients, i.e. those with AIDS. Toxoplasmic encephalitis is associated with high mortality and morbidity and is one of the most common opportunistic infections of the central nervous system in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients (1Roullet E. J. Neurol. 1999; 246: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The chemotherapy for toxoplasmosis is not ideal especially for the AIDS patient because there is relapse of the infection if the treatment is halted because of intolerance of the patient to the side effects. Almost all the drugs in use have toxicity associated with their continued use. In addition, most of the recommended treatments do not have an effect on the slow growing bradyzoite forms. Isoprenoids are the most diverse and abundant compounds occurring in nature. Many types of isoprenoids (e.g. steroids, cholesterol, retinoids, carotenoids, ubiquinones, and prenyl groups bound to proteins) are essential components of the cellular machinery of all organisms because of their roles in a variety of biological processes. Despite their structural and functional variety, all isoprenoids derive from a common precursor, isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), 2The abbreviations used are: IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate; FPP, farnesyl diphosphate; DMAPP, dimethylallyl diphosphate; GPP, geranyl diphosphate; GGPP, geranylgeranyl diphosphate; GGPPS, geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase; FPPS, farnesyl diphosphate synthase; TgFPPS, T. gondii farnesyl diphosphate/geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase; PBS, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcription; ORF, open reading frame; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; FARM, first aspartic acid-rich motif; ACP, acyl carrier protein.2The abbreviations used are: IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate; FPP, farnesyl diphosphate; DMAPP, dimethylallyl diphosphate; GPP, geranyl diphosphate; GGPP, geranylgeranyl diphosphate; GGPPS, geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase; FPPS, farnesyl diphosphate synthase; TgFPPS, T. gondii farnesyl diphosphate/geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase; PBS, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcription; ORF, open reading frame; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; FARM, first aspartic acid-rich motif; ACP, acyl carrier protein. and its isomer, dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). Farnesyl-diphosphate synthase (FPPS) catalyzes the consecutive condensation of IPP with DMAPP and geranyl diphosphate (GPP) to form the 15-carbon isoprenoid compound, farnesyl diphosphate (FPP). FPP is the substrate for enzymes catalyzing the first committed step for biosynthesis of sterols, ubiquinones, dolichols, heme a, and prenyl groups that bind to proteins. FPP can also be condensed with an additional molecule of IPP by geranylgeranyl-diphosphate synthase (GGPPS) to form the 20-carbon isoprenoid geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP), also used in protein prenylation.

RNA interference experiments in T. brucei show that the FPPS gene is essential (9Montalvetti A. Fernandez A. Sanders J.M. Ghosh S. Van Brussel E. Oldfield E. Docampo R. J. Biol.

Recent work has shown that bisphosphonates, diphosphate analogs in which a carbon atom replaces the oxygen atom bridge between the two phosphorus atoms of the diphosphate, are potent inhibitors of FPPS (12Rogers M.J. Frith J.C. Luckman S.P. Coxon F.P. Benford H.L. Monkkonen J. Auriola S. Chilton K.M. Russell R.G. Bone (Tarrytown). 1999; 24: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Several bisphosphonates are potent inhibitors of bone resorption and are in clinical use for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis, Paget disease, hypercalcemia caused by malignancy, tumor metastases in bone, and other diseases (13Rodan G.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In early work, it was shown that nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates were effective in the inhibition of T. cruzi, in vitro and in vivo, without toxicity to the host cell (14Urbina J.A. Moreno B. Vierkotter S. Oldfield E. Payares G. Sanoja C. Bailey B.N. Yan W. Scott D.A. Moreno S.N. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33609-33615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). More recently, we tested a series of bisphosphonates for their effects on the growth of T. gondii, T. brucei rhodesiense, Leishmania donovani, and Plasmodium falciparum in vitro, finding that several bisphosphonates can effectively inhibit the growth of these parasites (15Martin M.B. Grimley J.S. Lewis J.C. Heath III, H.T. Bailey B.N. Kendrick H. Yardley V. Caldera A. Lira R. Urbina J.A. Moreno S.N. Docampo R. Croft S.L. Oldfield E. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 909-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Moreover, in vivo testing of bisphosphonates against T. gondii in mice has shown that one of the nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates, risedronate, significantly increases the survival of mice infected by T. gondii (16Yardley V. Khan A.A. Martin M.B. Slifer T.R. Araujo F.G. Moreno S.N. Docampo R. Croft S.L. Oldfield E. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 929-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). All these results indicate that bisphosphonates are promising candidate drugs to treat infections caused by T. gondii as well as some other protozoan parasites. In this study we report the cloning and characterization of a T. gondii FPPS (TgFPPS) homolog. Interestingly, we found the enzyme to be bifunctional, capable of forming both farnesyl diphosphate as well as geranylgeranyl diphosphate. This unique characteristic was previously found only in enzymes of the Archaea (17Chen A. Poulter C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11002-11007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Fujiwara S. Yamanaka A. Hirooka K. Kobayashi A. Imanaka T. Fukusaki E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 325: 1066-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Bisphosphonates that inhibit the proliferation of T. gondii in vitro and in vivo are shown to be potent inhibitors of the enzyme, indicating that the isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway may constitute a novel target for the development of drugs to treat toxoplasmosis.

J. 1996; 313: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), whereas bradyzoites were obtained by differentiation of tachyzoites of the ME49 strain as described before (20Luo S. Vieira M. Graves J. Zhong L. Moreno S.N. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Host cells were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Host cells were infected with tachyzoites at a ratio of 5:1 (parasites:host). Tachyzoites were collected 2-3 days post-infection. Cell cultures were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2. T. gondii tachyzoites of the 2F1 clone expressing β-galactosidase were a gift from Dr. L. David Sibley (21Dobrowolski J.M. Sibley L.D. Cell. 1996; 84: 933-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) and were routinely maintained in vitro in the same media as used for the RH strain. In vitro growth inhibition was done using confluent human fibroblast cells in 96-well plates as described previously (22Ling Y. Sahota G. Odeh S. Chan J.M. Araujo F.G. Moreno S.N. Oldfield E. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 3130-3140Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Tachyzoites of the 2F1 clone at 104 per ml were used for infection, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C. At 48 h post-infection, the plates were processed for β-galactosidase activity as described previously (22Ling Y. Sahota G. Odeh S. Chan J.M. Araujo F.G. Moreno S.N. Oldfield E. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 3130-3140Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Bioinformatics—Preliminary genomic and/or cDNA sequence data were accessed on line. Genomic data were provided by The Institute for Genomic Research and by the Sanger Center (Wellcome Trust). EST sequences were generated by Washington University, St. Louis. The N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence was predicted by use of the iPSORT prediction program. RT-PCR and 5′-RACE—Total RNA was isolated from ∼5 × 108 T. gondii tachyzoites using TRIzol reagent. About 2 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA by SuperScript II reverse transcriptase using oligo(dT) primers. Gene-specific primers were designed and used to do standard PCR using the first strand cDNA as template. 5′-RACE was carried out using the kit from Invitrogen. The first cDNA strand was synthesized with a gene-specific primer 1 (5′-CTGAGAGCTGCAAGTGCATCTTCG-3′) by SuperScript II reverse transcriptase. cDNA was tailed with dCTP and then amplified using the abridged anchor primer and nested gene-specific primer 2 (5′-GGAGATCTTGGAGCTGCACATACG-3′). The primary PCR product was amplified using abridged universal amplification primer and nested gene-specific primer (5′-GTCCATCACATCGTCCATGACCAA-3′). DNA Sequencing and Sequence Analysis—Sequencing reactions were done following the instructions of the DNA sequencing kit. An ABI 3730XL capillary sequencer was used. Screening of the cDNA Library—A cDNA library of T. gondii tachyzoites was obtained from the Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health (catalog number1896). Membranes with λ phage plaques were hybridized with an [α-32P]dCTP-labeled probe obtained by RT-PCR. The first screening of 5 × 105 plaques yielded five positive cDNA clones. After the second and third screenings, only one positive clone was obtained. The positive plaque was purified, and the phagemid was isolated by in vivo excision. The insert DNA from the phagemid was then sequenced. Construction of TgFOi and TgFO—Both TgFPPSi (GenBank™ accession number AY196327) and TgFPPS (GenBank™ accession number DQ630749) open reading frames (ORFs) were amplified by PCR using primers TgFPPS-BamHI, 5′-GGATCCATGGTGGATGCGGTG-3′ (sense) and TgFPPS-AvrII: 5′-CCCTAGGTTTCTGCCGTTTGT-3′ (antisense), and introduced into the expression vector ptubP30-FLAG/sag-CAT (a gift form Dr. William Sullivan, Indiana University, IN) in place of P30, to yield the plasmid ptubTgFPPS-FLAG/sag-CAT. A basic electroporation protocol (23Soldati D. Boothroyd J.C. Science. 1993; 260: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) was then used for transfection. Briefly, 107 freshly prepared parasites and 50 μg of sterilized plasmid ptubTgFPPS-FLAG/sag-CAT DNA in a 2-mm gap electroporation cuvette were mixed. After electroporation, parasites were allowed to recover for 15 min and then inoculated into human fibroblasts cells in 25-cm2 T flasks. Stable transformants were selected in medium containing 20 μm chloramphenicol and cloned by limited dilution in 96-well plates. The selected positive clone was denoted as TgFOi if expressing recombinant TgFPPSi or TgFO if expressing recombinant TgFPPS. The isolated positive clones were verified by PCR with chloramphenicol acetyltransferase-specific primers and Western blot analysis with specific antibodies. Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression—Gene specific primers with two restriction enzyme sites were designed as 5′-CGGATCCATGCGTGCTCCGCCT-3′ (sense primer with BamHI site, underlined) and 5′-CCTCGAGCTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGTTTCTGCCGTTTGTG-3′ (antisense primer with a His6 tag and an XhoI site underlined). PCRs were performed using FastStart TaqDNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science) at 94 °C for 10 min, followed by 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1.5 min. The PCR product was cloned into a TA vector using the TOPO TA cloning kit and double digested with XhoI and BamHI. The digested fragment was separated by agarose-gel electrophoresis, purified with QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and ligated with a linearized pFastBac 1 vector predigested with XhoI and BamHI. The correct construction of the expression cassette pFastBac1-TgFPPS was verified by DNA sequencing. The DH10Bac-competent cells (Invitrogen) were transformed with pFastBac1-TgFPPS plasmid, and blue/white selection was used to identify the colonies containing the recombinant bacmid. The incorporation of pFastBac1-TgFPPS into the baculovirus genome (bacmid DNA) with help of Tn7 site-specific transposition was verified by PCR with M13 forward (-40) and M13 reverse primers, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The recombinant bacmid DNA was purified with plasmid miniprep kit (Qiagen), incubated with Cellfectin reagent (Invitrogen), and transfected to Sf9 cells. The resultant recombinant baculovirus was amplified, and viral titers were determined using a conventional plaque assay. Transfected Sf9 cells were collected after 24, 48, 72, and 96 h of infection, and the overexpression of the recombinant protein was detected by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Purification of Recombinant Protein by Ni-NTA-Agarose—150 ml of baculovirus-infected H5 insect cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 4 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 600 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0) and then broken by freezing and thawing six times. Supernatant and pellet fractions were separated by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. 200 μl of 50% Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) equilibrated with lysis buffer were added per 4 ml of the cleared lysate and then mixed gently on a rotary shaker at 4 °C for 2 h. After washing with 8 ml of lysis buffer and 8 ml of washing buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 600 mm NaCl, 50 mm imidazole, pH 8.0), the His tag protein was eluted with elution buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 600 mm NaCl, 300 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). The purified protein was dialyzed against storage buffer (10 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.4) at 4 °C overnight. The purity of the protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the protein concentration was determined by using a Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad). The protein solution was mixed with 30% (v/v) glycerol and stored at -80 °C. Expression and Purification of Recombinant TgFPPS in E. coli—The primers 5′-TCCATGGTTTCCGACGAACGGACTTCC-3′ and 5′-CCTCGAGTTTCTGCCGTTTGTGGAGCC-3′ were used to amplify the gene encoding the N-terminal truncated TgFPPSi. The PCR product was then subcloned into pCR 2.1-TOPO vector, and the sequence was verified by sequencing. The NcoI and XhoI fragment was then removed and subcloned into pET28a (Novagen) vector. The region corresponding to the C-terminal portion of TgFPPSi was replaced with the PstI-XhoI fragment of TgFPPS to generate pET28a-TgFPPS. Both expressing constructs were introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3) strain. The expression of recombinant TgFPPS and TgFPPSi was induced by 0.4 mm isopropyl β-thiogalactopyranoside at 20 °C overnight. The recombinant proteins were purified using HisBind 900 cartridges (Novagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Preparation of Anti-TgFPPS Antibody—PCR with two primers TgFPPSAntiF “5′-CATATGTATCGCTGCGACGGCATTGG-3′” (including an NdeI site, underlined) and TgFPPSExp4 “5′-CCTCGAGTTTCTGCCGTTTGTGGAGCC-3′” (including a XhoI site, underlined) was performed to amplify the region corresponding to the C-terminal portion of TgFPPS (amino acids 348-605). The PCR product was ligated with the E. coli expression vector pET-28a, and the recombinant peptide was overexpressed in E. coli. The resulting recombinant protein, Ag-TgFPPS, contained a His6 tag at both the N terminus and C terminus and had a molecular mass of ∼31.7 kDa, as shown by SDS-PAGE. The recombinant protein was found in the insoluble fraction. The Ag-TgFPPS was solubilized with 6 mm urea, purified using a Quick 900 cartridge nickel resin column (Novagen) under denaturing conditions according to the manufacturer's instructions, and then dialyzed to remove the urea. The purified protein was then sent to Cocalico Biologicals Inc. (Reamstown, PA) to generate antibodies in a guinea pig. Affinity Purification of the Anti-TgFPPS Antibody—7 mg of Ag-TgFPPS was coupled to a CNBr-activated resin (Sigma C9142). Two ml of the final bleeding serum was applied to the resin and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The resin was washed with ∼20 volumes of PBS and eluted with 0.1 m glycine (pH 2.5-3.0) at 4 °C. The eluted antibody was neutralized immediately after elution. Purification of the Overexpressed TgFPPS with an Anti-FLAG Column—Approximately 8 × 109 of TgFO cells from 20 75-cm2 flasks were filtered with a 5 μm pore-size membrane, collected, and resuspended with lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, 50 mm KCl, 125 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.2). A freeze and thaw method was used to break the parasites. The supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and then mixed with the anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin for 3 h at 4 °C. After washing with TBS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), the FLAG-tagged protein was eluted with 3× FLAG peptide in TBS buffer at 200 ng/μl. SDS-Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blot Analysis—The electrophoresis system originally described by Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) was used. The protein sample was mixed with an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE buffer (1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.6, 20% SDS, 6% glycerol, 10% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 0.4% bromphenol blue) and boiled for 5 min before loading into an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After separation by electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane with a Bio-Rad Transblot apparatus. 5% nonfat milk in PBS-T (0.1% Tween 20 in PBS) was used to block the nitrocellulose membrane at 4 °C overnight. The primary antibodies at the appropriate dilution in PBS-T were then incubated with the nitrocellulose membrane for 1 h at room temperature or 4 °C overnight. After three washes with PBS-T for 15 min each, the membrane was incubated with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at the appropriate dilution at room temperature for 1 h. After three washes with PBS-T for 15 min each, the immunoblots were visualized on blue-sensitive x-ray film by using ECL detection kit. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Freshly isolated tachyzoites from lysed HFB cells were stained with 50 nm MitoTracker™ Red CMXRos at 37 °C for 45 min, fixed in 4% formaldehyde at room temperature for 1 h, and then allowed to adhere to poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips. 0.3% Triton X-100 was used to permeabilize the parasites for 30 min. 3% bovine serum albumin, 1% fish gelatin, 50 mm NH4Cl, and 5% goat serum in PBS were used to block at room temperature for 1 h. A 1:100 dilution of the purified anti-TgFPPS antibody and a 1:200 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled goat anti-guinea pig secondary antibody were incubated with the parasites for 1 h each. Alternatively, mouse monoclonal antibodies raised against T. gondii rhoptry protein 1 (ROP1) a gift from Dr. J. Dubremetz (25Leriche M.A. Dubremetz J.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 45: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against the apicoplast protein acyl carrier protein (ACP) a gift from Dr. B. Striepen (26Waller R.F. Keeling P.J. Donald R.G. Striepen B. Handman E. Lang-Unnasch N. Cowman A.F. Besra G.S. Roos D.S. McFadden G.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12352-12357Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar) were used in combination with anti-TgFPPS antibody in co-localization studies. Cells were observed with a Delta Vision fluorescence microscope. Images were recorded with a Photometrics Coolsnap camera and deconvolved over 15 cycles using Softwarx deconvolution software. Enzymatic Activity Assay and Kinetic Studies—The activity of the enzyme was determined by a radiometric assay. The assay was performed in a total volume of 100 μl and included a 10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm [4-14C]IPP (10 μCi/μmol), an allylic substrate (100 μm DMAPP, 27 μm GPP, or 13 μm FPP), and 40-160 ng of protein. The reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 30 min and terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 6 m HCl. The reaction mixture was made alkaline by addition of 15 μl of 6 m NaOH, extracted with 1 ml of hexane, washed with water, then transferred to a scintillation vial for counting. For kinetic studies, the concentration of DMAPP, GPP, FPP, or [4-14C]IPP was varied, whereas the corresponding counter-substrate was kept at saturating concentration. A nonlinear regression analysis in Sigma Plot 7.0 was used to estimate the kinetic parameters. Reverse Phase TLC—To analyze the products after enzymatic reaction, the radioactive prenyl products in the mixture were hydrolyzed to the corresponding alcohols by using alkaline phosphatase at room temperature, overnight (8Montalvetti A. Bailey B.N. Martin M.B. Severin G.W. Oldfield E. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33930-33937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The resultant alcohols were extracted with hexane and separated on reverse phase Silica Gel 60 plates (Merck) with acetone:H2O (6:1; v/v). The position of the standard prenyl alcohol was visualized using iodine vapor. Radioactivity was visualized by autoradiography. Effects of Bisphosphonates on TgFPPS Activity—The activity of TgFPPS was assayed in the presence of bisphosphonates in mixtures containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 47 μm [4-14C]IPP (10 μCi/μmol), 13 μm FPP, and 168 ng of protein in a final volume of 100 μl. Reactants were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and the prenyl products were extracted and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. IC50 values were calculated using the same methods as described previously for in vitro testing (22Ling Y. Sahota G. Odeh S. Chan J.M. Araujo F.G. Moreno S.N. Oldfield E. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 3130-3140Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Bisphosphonates—The structures of the bisphosphonates investigated are as shown in Scheme 1, and their synthesis followed standard methods (15Martin M.B. Grimley J.S. Lewis J.C. Heath III, H.T. Bailey B.N. Kendrick H. Yardley V. Caldera A. Lira R. Urbina J.A. Moreno S.N. Docampo R. Croft S.L. Oldfield E. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 909-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Isolation of the TgFPPS Gene—The amino acid sequence of the T. cruzi FPPS was used to do a TBLASTN search of the T. gondii gDNA and EST data bases (ToxoDB Release 2.0). Two hits, TGG16412 and TGG12970, were found with high similarity to the T. cruzi FPPS. Using these sequences as template, primers were designed and used to amplify T. gondii cDNA by RT-PCR. A 574-bp (RT-574) RT-PCR product was obtained and used as a probe to screen a T. gondii cDNA library (AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, National Institutes of Health). A 1194-bp cDNA sequence (TgLibr) was obtained with 597 bp of ORF, a truncated 5′ end, and the complete 3′ end. Gene-specific primers according to the RT-574 sequence were designed and used to do 5′-RACE, whi"
https://openalex.org/W2001376867,"The incidence of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is very high among the Turkmen population of Iran. Family studies suggest a genetic component to the disease. Turkmen are ethnically homogenous and are well suited for genetic studies. A previous study from China suggested that BRCA2 might play a role in the etiology of ESCC. We screened for mutations in the coding region of the BRCA2 gene in the germline DNA of 197 Turkmen patients with ESCC. A nonsense variant, K3326X, was identified in 9 of 197 cases (4.6%) vs 2 of 254 controls (0.8%) (OR=6.0, 95% CI=1.3–28; P=0.01). This mutation leads to the loss of the C-terminal domain of the BRCA2 protein, a part of the region of interaction with the FANCD2 protein. We observed nine other BRCA2 variants in single cases only, including two deletions, and seven missense mutations. Six of these were judged to be pathogenic. In total, a suspicious deleterious BRCA2 variant was identified in 15 of 197 ESCC cases (7.6%)."
https://openalex.org/W2062900990,"We reported previously that a signaling pathway consisting of Gi-Ras-NF-κB mediates lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)-induced urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) upregulation in ovarian cancer cells. However, it is not clear what signaling components link Ras to nuclear factor (NF)-κB for this LPA-induced event. In the present study, we found that treatment of protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors including conventional PKC (cPKC) inhibitor Gö6976 abolished LPA-induced uPA upregulation in ovarian cancer cell lines tested, indicating the importance of cPKC activity in this LPA-induced event. Indeed, LPA stimulation led to the activation of PKCα and Ras–PKCα interaction. Although constitutively active mutants of PKCα (a cPKC), PKCθ (a novel PKC (nPKC)) and PKCζ (an atypical PKC (aPKC)) were all able to activate NF-κB and upregulate uPA expression, only dominant-negative PKCα mutant attenuated LPA-induced NF-κB activation and uPA upregulation. These results suggest that PKCα, rather than PKC isoforms in other PKC classes, participates in LPA-induced NF-κB activation and uPA upregulation in ovarian cancer cells. To determine the signaling components downstream of PKCα mediating LPA-induced uPA upregulation, we showed that forced expression of dominant-negative CARMA3 or silencing CARMA3, Bcl10 and MALT1 with specific siRNAs diminished these LPA-induced events. Furthermore, we demonstrated that PKCα/CARMA3 signaling axis is important in LPA-induced ovarian cancer cell in vitro invasion."
https://openalex.org/W1991859212,"Oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in ischemic injury, and p66ShcAko mice exhibit both lower oxidative stress and decreased tissue damage following hind limb ischemia. Thus, it was investigated whether tissue regeneration following acute hind limb ischemia was altered in p66ShcAko mice. Upon femoral artery dissection, muscle regeneration started earlier and was completed faster than in wild-type (WT) control. Moreover, faster regeneration was associated with decreased oxidative stress. Unlike ischemia, cardiotoxin injury induced similar skeletal muscle damage in both genotypes. However, p66ShcAko mice regenerated faster, in agreement with the regenerative advantage upon ischemia. Since no difference between p66ShcAwt and knock-out (ko) mice was found in blood perfusion recovery after ischemia, satellite cells (SCs), a resident population of myogenic progenitors, were examined. Similar SCs numbers were present in WT and ko mice. However, in vitro cultured p66ShcAko SCs displayed lower oxidative stress levels and higher proliferation rate and differentiated faster than WT. Furthermore, when exposed to sublethal H2O2 doses, p66ShcAko SCs were resistant to H2O2-induced inhibition of differentiation. Finally, myogenic conversion induced by MyoD overexpression was more efficient in p66ShcAko fibroblasts compared with WT. The present work demonstrates that oxidative stress and p66ShcA play a crucial role in the regenerative pathways activated by acute ischemia.

Furthermore, when exposed to sublethal H2O2 doses, p66ShcAko SCs were resistant to H2O2-induced inhibition of differentiation. Finally, myogenic conversion induced by MyoD overexpression was more efficient in p66ShcAko fibroblasts compared with WT. The present work demonstrates that oxidative stress and p66ShcA play a crucial role in the regenerative pathways activated by acute ischemia.

Mitochondria are one of the main sources of intracellular ROS, which are generated as an unavoidable consequence of aerobic metabolism. Pathologic events or exogenous insults can affect mitochondrial electron transfer chain and increase ROS production. ROS imbalance leads to cellular oxidative damage and impairment of physiologic functions and is presently regarded as a mechanism for aging and aging-related diseases (3Finkel T. Kim N.J.

The mammalian adaptor protein ShcA has three isoforms, p46, p52 and p66, which share a common structure, but p66ShcA has an additional domain at the N terminus. This domain contains a serine residue at position 36 (Ser-36) that is phosphorylated in response to several stimuli, including UV irradiation and H2O2 (10Migliaccio E. Kim M. Mele S. Pelicci G.

This rapid repair process is mainly carried out by satellite cells (SCs) (24Dhawan J. Kim T.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 666-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). SCs are quiescent myogenically specified precursor cells, situated between the plasma membrane and the basal lamina of mature muscle fibers. Upon injury, SCs become active and proliferate, and their progeny progress down the myogenic lineage, giving rise to fusion-competent myoblasts and then to new myofibers. Several authors have shown an increased ROS production after ischemia (6Zaccagnini G. Kim F. Fasanaro P. Magenta A. Gaetano C. Di Carlo A. Biglioli P. Giorgio M. Martin-Padura I. Pelicci P.G.

In the present study, we investigated the role of oxidative stress and p66ShcA in skeletal muscle regeneration that follows acute hind limb ischemia. Results show that p66ShcA and oxidative stress negatively modulate myogenic differentiation; in contrast, p66ShcA deletion enhances skeletal muscle regeneration after ischemia.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimal Model and Surgical Procedures—All experimental procedures complied with the Guidelines of the Italian National Institutes of Health and with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, National Academy of Sciences, Bethesda, MD) and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. 129 Sv-Ev p66ShcAwt and knock-out (ko) inbred mice were previously described (10Migliaccio E. Kim M. Mele S. Pelicci G. Reboldi P. Pandolfi P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 1999; 402: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar); their genetic background was identical except for the p66ShcA locus. Surgical procedures are described in supplemental data.Histology and Morphometric Analysis—Hematoxylin/eosine-stained sections were prepared, and both capillary density and arteriolar length density (ALD) were measured as previously described (25Turrini P. Kim C. Antonelli A. Capogrossi M.C. Aloe L. Neurosci. Lett. 2002; 323: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 26Emanueli C. Kim M.B. Pinna A. Graiani G. Manni L. Madeddu P. Circulation. 2002; 106: 2257-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Regenerating myofibers were identified by morphological criteria, central nucleus/i, and <30-μm diameter in hematoxylin/eosine-stained sections or by Desmin immunofluorescence staining. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were carried out according to standard procedures (25Turrini P. Kim C. Antonelli A. Capogrossi M.C. Aloe L. Neurosci.

FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1242-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A Zeiss Axioplan 2 fluorescence microscope with image analyzer KS300 software was used to acquire images and to measure areas. All histological and morphometric analyses were carried out by two blinded readers with comparable results.Cell Culture—Primary SCs were isolated as previously described (28Rando T.A. Kim H.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1275-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose supplemented with 20% horse serum (Sigma), 3% chicken embryo extract (MP Biomedicals Europe) (growth medium, GM). C2C12 murine myoblasts were cultured as previously described (29Di Carlo A. Kim R. Martelli F. Pompilio G. Capogrossi M.C. Germani A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16332-16338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To induce terminal differentiation, myoblasts were shifted to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% horse serum (differentiation medium, DM). To induce oxidative stress, H2O2 was added for 4 h before switching the cells to DM in order to induce differentiation. H2O2 was renewed daily. Primary mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) were isolated as previously described (30Martelli F. Kim D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2858-2863Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).Immunofluorescence, BrdUrd Assay, and Oxidative Stress Measurement—Immunofluorescence stainings were performed as previously described (29Di Carlo A. Kim R. Martelli F. Pompilio G. Capogrossi M.C. Germani A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16332-16338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In vitro SC proliferation was assessed by anti-BrdUrd (B44; BD Biosciences) immunofluorescence staining of proliferating myoblasts incubated with 20 μM BrdUrd for 1 h. Intracellular ROS production was evaluated through the oxidation of 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA). Briefly, 25 μM DCFH-DA (Eastman Kodak Co.) was added to the cells, and, 30 min later, DCFH-DA fluorescence was revealed by fluorescence microscopy, using the same exposure conditions in each experiment. Images were taken and analyzed by two blinded readers with comparable results.To measure oxidative stress levels in adductor muscles, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) were evaluated. The formation of TBARS was determined using the OXI-TEK kit (ZeptoMetrix Corp.) and a luminescence spectrometer (LS55; PerkinElmer) with excitation set at 530 nm, emission at 550 nm, and slit width at 5 nm (31Yagi K. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 108: 107-110PubMed Google Scholar).Western Blotting—Cell cultures were lysed with Laemmli buffer, while adductor muscle extracts were derived in radioimmune precipitation buffer containing protease inhibitors (30Martelli F. Kim D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2858-2863Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Immunoblottings were performed according to standard procedures (30Martelli F. Kim D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2858-2863Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Membranes were stained with Red Ponceau (Sigma) to assess equal protein loading and even transfer.Antibodies—Antibodies used throughout the study are described in the supplemental data.Statistical Analysis—Variables were analyzed by Student's t test and one way analysis of variance. A value of p ≤ 0.05 was deemed statistically significant. Results are reported as mean values ± S.E.RESULTSFaster Skeletal Muscle Regeneration of p66ShcAko Mice after Hind Limb Ischemia—In order to evaluate the role of p66ShcA and oxidative stress in skeletal muscle regeneration, unilateral hind limb ischemia was induced in p66ShcAwt and ko mice by removing the femoral artery. Regenerating myofibers were identified in hematoxylin/eosin-stained sections of ischemic adductor muscles at 2-50 days after ischemia. Important differences were observed in the density of regenerating myofibers and in the time course of regeneration. Seven days after ischemia, WT adductor muscles showed minimal regeneration and numerous necrotic myofibers with infiltrating cells. In contrast, in p66ShcAko adductor muscles, wide areas of regenerating myofibers and minimal necrotic damage were observed. In WT muscles the density of regenerating myofibers reached a maximum at 21 days after ischemia when necrotic myofibers were still present. Conversely, in p66ShcAko muscles 21 days after ischemia, regeneration was almost completed and most fibers displayed mature size and peripheral nucleus, in the absence of overt necrosis (Fig. 1, A and B). As expected, the overall number of regenerating myofibers was lower in ko mice than in WT controls since we previously demonstrated that ko mice display lower tissue damage after ischemia (6Zaccagnini G. Kim F. Fasanaro P. Magenta A. Gaetano C. Di Carlo A. Biglioli P. Giorgio M. Martin-Padura I. Pelicci P.G. Capogrossi M.C. Circulation. 2004; 109: 2917-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Faster regeneration of p66ShcAko ischemic adductor muscles at 7 days after ischemia was confirmed by Desmin immunofluorescence staining of regenerating myofibers (Fig. 1C).In order to analyze muscle regeneration in a model in which p66ShcAwt and ko mice showed a similar amount of tissue damage, tibialis anterior muscles of both p66ShcAwt and ko mice were injected with cardiotoxin. Cardiotoxin induced similar areas of myonecrosis 1 day after injection in p66ShcAwt and ko tibialis anterior muscles (supplemental Fig. S1A). Time course of muscle regeneration showed that also in this experimental model, p66ShcAko mice displayed faster regeneration 7 days after skeletal muscle damage (supplemental Fig. S1B). Taken together, these data indicate that p66ShcAko mice regenerate skeletal muscle faster than WT controls.Lower Oxidative Stress in p66ShcAko Mice during Ischemia—In order to clarify whether skeletal muscle regeneration after ischemia takes place in an environment with increased oxidative stress levels, ROS-mediated damage was evaluated. To this aim, nitrotyrosine was detected by immunohistochemistry in ischemic adductor muscle sections. Accumulation of nitrotyrosine was found in necrotic, healthy, and regenerating myofibers of p66ShcAwt skeletal muscle sections at 5, 7, and 14 days of ischemia. In contrast, in ko sections nitrotyrosine accumulation was observed only in occasional regenerating myofibers at 5 days after ischemia (Fig. 2A). To confirm these results, tissue levels of TBARS were evaluated in ischemic adductor muscles 5, 7, and 14 days after surgery. Significant increases of TBARS were observed in WT, but not in ko, muscles (Fig. 2B). These data indicate that ischemia leads to oxidative damage that extensively affects p66ShcAwt, but not ko, muscles.FIGURE 2Lower oxidative stress in p66ShcAko mice during ischemia.

Significant differences were observed in capillary density of both normoperfused and ischemic mice. Normoperfused p66ShcAwt adductor muscles showed a higher capillary density than ko. As expected (6Zaccagnini G. Kim F. Fasanaro P. Magenta A. Gaetano C. Di Carlo A. Biglioli P. Giorgio M. Martin-Padura I. Pelicci P.G. Capogrossi M.C. Circulation. 2004; 109: 2917-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 32Couffinhal T. Kim M. Zheng L.P. Kearney M. Witzenbichler B. Isner J.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 1667-1679PubMed Google Scholar), p66ShcAwt capillary density decreased after ischemia, remained low between 2 and 21 days, and returned to initial value between 35 and 50 days. In contrast, no decrease was observed in p66ShcAko adductor muscles and a transient increment was observed between 7 and 21 days (supplemental Fig. S2A). Interestingly, it was found there was no effect of ischemia on ALD in both genotypes (supplemental Fig. S3, A and B). Because evaluation of capillary density and ALD are morphological analyses that give no information about capillary functionality, laser Doppler perfusion imaging was performed to assess hind limb perfusion. Supplemental Fig. S2B shows no significant difference in perfusion recovery between p66ShcAwt and ko ischemic mice.Higher Proliferation Rate and Spontaneous Differentiation of Cultured p66ShcAko Satellite Cells—Afterward, it was examined whether SCs may play a role in the accelerated muscle regeneration of p66ShcAko mice. A similar number of SCs was observed in normoperfused p66ShcAwt and ko adductor muscle sections, as assessed by m-Cadherin and c-Met immunohistochemistry (supplemental Fig. S4, A and B). SCs were then isolated from p66ShcAwt and ko mice and characterized. Proliferation rate was evaluated by BrdUrd incorporation assay at 4 days from isolation. The percentage of BrdUrd-positive SCs, estimated at the same cell density, was significantly higher in ko than in WT cell cultures, indicating a faster proliferation rate of p66ShcAko SCs (Fig. 3A).FIGURE 3Higher proliferation rate and spontaneous differentiation of p66ShcAko satellite cells in vitro.

C, representative Western blotting of proliferating (6 days) and differentiating (24 h) p66ShcAwt and ko SCs. MHC, myogenin, and the three isoforms of ShcA were detected with specific antibodies. p52ShcA and p46ShcA isoforms indicate similar protein loading in each lane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In order to examine SCs differentiation, cells were allowed to proliferate for 6 days in growth factorrich medium (GM) and then switched to low growth factor medium (DM). Differentiation was assessed by myosin heavy chain (MHC) immunofluorescence staining and Western blot (WB) analysis for MHC and for the myogenic transcription factor myogenin. Fig. 3, B and C, shows that ko SCs, at the same cell density as WT cells, were able to differentiate spontaneously, giving rise to small myotubes in GM. In contrast, this condition was not suitable for WT cell differentiation. In agreement with these results, ko cells exhibited higher MHC and myogenin levels in GM. As expected, in DM both WT and ko SCs gave rise to myotubes. Taken together, these results show that p66ShcAko SCs proliferate faster and exhibit a higher rate of spontaneous differentiation than WT SCs.Higher Myogenic Potential of p66ShcAko Mouse Embryo Fibroblasts upon MyoD Overexpression—To confirm the higher myogenic potential of p66ShcAko cells, the master gene of myogenic differentiation, MyoD, was overexpressed in non-myogenic cells in order to induce myogenic conversion (33Davis R.L. Kim H. Lassar A.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 987-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2438) Google Scholar). To this aim, p66ShcAwt and ko MEFs were infected, with similar efficiencies, with adenoviral vectors encoding either MyoD or LacZ. Cells were cultured for 32 h in GM and then switched to DM for an additional 48 h. Fig. 4 shows that MyoD overexpression induced a much higher expression of MHC and myogenin in ko than in WT cells. Interestingly, some expression of myogenic markers was observed in ko MEFs transduced with MyoD in GM conditions as well (supplemental Fig. S5).FIGURE 4Higher myogenic potential of p66ShcAko MEFs upon MyoD overexpression. MEFs were infected, achieving similar efficiencies between WT and ko, with 100, 300, and 900 multiplicity of infection of Adeno-MyoD to induce myogenic conversion. After infection, cells were cultured in GM for 32 h and then shifted to DM for 48 h. Control infection was performed with 900 multiplicity of infection of Adeno-LacZ. WB was carried out after 48 h of culture in DM. MyoD, myogenin, MHC, and cdk4 (loading control) were detected with specific antibodies. The picture shows representative Western blottings.

https://openalex.org/W2157146089,"Cyclin D1 levels are maintained at steady state by phosphorylation-dependent nuclear export and polyubiquitination by SCFFBX4-αB crystallin. Inhibition of cyclin D1 proteolysis has been implicated as a causative factor leading to its overexpression in breast and esophageal carcinomas; however, the contribution of stable cyclin D1 to the genesis of such carcinomas has not been evaluated. We therefore generated transgenic mice wherein expression of either wild-type or a stable cyclin D1 allele (D1T286A) is regulated by MMTV-LTR. MMTV-D1T286A mice developed mammary adenocarcinomas at an increased rate relative to MMTV-D1 mice. Similar to human cancers that overexpress cyclin D1, D1T286A tumors were estrogen receptor-positive and exhibited estrogen-dependent growth. Collectively, these results suggest that temporal control of cyclin D1 subcellular localization and proteolysis is critical for maintenance of homeostasis within the mammary epithelium."
https://openalex.org/W1564388687,"Heat-shock proteins (HSP) 90 exert a relevant role in the survival and response to therapy of many neoplastic cell types. Here, we show that the promoter of hsp90α gene, that encodes the inducible form of HSP90, is regulated by nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activity. Indeed, we found that NF-κB factors bound to one of the two putative consensus sequences present in the hsp90α-flanking region; mutation of such motif hampered the phorbol-myristate-13-acetate-stimulated expression of a luciferase reporter gene under the control of the hsp90α promoter. Furthermore, the downmodulation of NF-κB (p65) levels by a specific small interfering (si) RNA resulted in reducing the levels of endogenous HSP90α protein. These findings disclose a previously unrecognized mechanism that contributes to connect NF-κB factors and HSPs in cell defence machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2042596920,"Daidzein and genistein are isoflavones found in soybean. Genistein is known to exhibit anticarcinogenic activities and inhibit tyrosine kinase activity. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of the chemopreventive activities of daidzein and its metabolite, equol, are not understood. Here we report that equol inhibits 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced neoplastic transformation of JB6 P+ mouse epidermal cells by targeting the MEK/ERK/p90RSK/activator protein-1 signaling pathway. TPA-induced neoplastic cell transformation was inhibited by equol, but not daidzein, at noncytotoxic concentrations in a dose-dependent manner. Equol dose-dependently attenuated TPA-induced activation of activator protein-1 and c-fos, whereas daidzein did not exert any effect when tested at the same concentrations. The TPA-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p90RSK, and Elk, but not MEK or c-Jun N-terminal kinase, was inhibited by equol but not by daidzein. In vitro kinase assays revealed that equol greatly inhibited MEK1, but not Raf1, kinase activity, and an ex vivo kinase assay also demonstrated that equol suppressed TPA-induced MEK1 kinase activity in JB6 P+ cell lysates. Equol dose-dependently inhibited neoplastic transformation of JB6 P+ cells induced by epidermal growth factor or H-Ras. Both in vitro and ex vivo pull-down assays revealed that equol directly bound with glutathione S-transferase-MEK1 to inhibit MEK1 activity without competing with ATP. These results suggested that the antitumor-promoting effect of equol is due to the inhibition of cell transformation mainly by targeting a MEK signaling pathway. These findings are the first to reveal a molecular basis for the anticancer action of equol and may partially account for the reported chemopreventive effects of soybean.

Carcinogenesis is characterized as a multistage process that includes initiation, promotion, and progression stages. Cancer prevention strategies that involve intervention at the tumor promotion stage, a reversible and long-term process, seem to be more practical than those intervening at the tumor initiation stage, which is an irreversible and short-term process. Activator protein-1 (AP-1) 5The abbreviations used are: AP-1, activator protein-1; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; EGF, epidermal growth factor; FBS, fetal bovine serum; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; ROS, reactive oxygen species; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MEM, Eagle's minimum essential medium; MTS, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxy-phenyl)-2-(4-sulfonyl)-2H-tetrazolium. is a well characterized transcription factor composed of homodimers and/or heterodimers of the Fos and Jun protein families and plays a key role in “preneoplastic-to-neoplastic” transformation and proliferation (1Dong Z. Birrer M.J. Watts R.G. Matrisian L.M. Colburn N.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). A diverse variety of stimuli induce AP-1 binding to various genes that govern cellular processes such as transformation and proliferation (2Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3279) Google Scholar). In particular, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), H-Ras, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) are the most common experimental stimuli used to activate AP-1 and induce cellular transformation in many different cell types and animal models (3Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). Many mechanisms are involved in the up- and down-regulation of AP-1 activity (2Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3279) Google Scholar). The mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are the most common signaling pathways known to mediate AP-1 function (4Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar), and the blocking of MAP kinases leads to the inhibition of AP-1 transactivation and subsequent cell transformation (5Dong Z. Ma W.Y. Huang C. Yang C.S. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4414-4419PubMed Google Scholar). These kinase families include extracellular-signal-regulated protein kinases (ERKs), c-Jun N-terminal kinases, and the p38 family of kinases. Although the proteins have some redundancy in function, ERKs generally play a critical role in transmitting signals initiated by tumor promoters such as TPA, EGF, and platelet-derived growth factor (6Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar, 7Bode A.M. Dong Z. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2005; 79: 237-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). MEK is a dual-specificity protein kinase that phosphorylates its downstream target ERK on specific tyrosine and threonine residues. The constitutive activation of MEK1 results in cellular transformation, whereas a small molecular inhibitor of MEK was shown to suppress transformation and tumor growth in both cell culture and mouse models (6Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar, 8Sebolt-Leopold J.S. Dudley D.T. Herrera R. Becelaere K. Wiland A. Gowan R.C. Tecle H. Barrett S.D. Bridges A. Przybranowski S. Leopold W.R. Saltiel A.R. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). Moreover, a mutant H-ras gene perpetually activates the MEK/ERK signaling pathway and drives cells to develop a more aggressive cancer-like phenotype, such as anchorage-independent growth (9Shapiro P. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 2002; 39: 285-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 10Chung J.Y. Park J.O. Phyu H. Dong Z. Yang C.S.

These results indicated that MEK is important in the transformation of cells and development of tumors. The National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health has identified about 40 plant-based foods, including soybean, green tea, red wine, onion, ginger, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, and turmeric, which have been reported to possess cancer preventive properties (7Bode A.M. Dong Z. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2005; 79: 237-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 12Bode A.M. Dong Z. Lancet Oncol. 2000; 1: 181-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 13Surh Y.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 768-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (2511) Google Scholar). Naturally occurring dietary phenolic phytochemicals originating from these plant-based foods have been suggested to have chemopreventive effects in carcinogenesis, particularly in the stage of promotion (7Bode A.M. Dong Z. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2005; 79: 237-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 14Lee K.W. Lee H.J. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2006; 127: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 15Lee K.W. Lee H.J. Biofactors. 2006; 26: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Soybean is an excellent source of dietary phenolic substances in the Asian diet (13Surh Y.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 768-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (2511) Google Scholar, 16Birt D.F. Hendrich S. Wang W. Pharmacol. Ther. 2001; 90: 157-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). The two major isoflavones in soybean are genistein and daidzein (see Fig. 1A), which together compose 100-300 mg/100 g of soybean and are found in tissues as glycoside conjugates (17Eldridge A.C. Kwolek W.F. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1983; 31: 394-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). These compounds are heat-stable and, hence, are also abundant in many processed and fermented soybean products (18Setchell K.D. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1998; 68: 1333-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). Genistein was originally described as a protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (19Akiyama T. Ishida J. Nakagawa S. Ogawara H. Watanabe S. Itoh N. Shibuya M. Fukami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5592-5595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it also has been reported to suppress angiogenesis (20Peterson G. J. Nutr. 1995; 125 (Suppl. 3): 784-789PubMed Google Scholar) and cell cycle progression (21Kim H. Peterson T.G. Barnes S. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1998; 68 (Suppl. 6): 1418-1425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and stimulate apoptosis (22Spinozzi F. Pagliacci M.C. Migliorati G. Moraca R. Grignani F. Riccardi C. Nicoletti I. Leuk. Res. 1994; 18: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Daidzein is another prominent isoflavone found in soybean foods but has consistently been reported to be less active then genistein (23Verma S.P. Goldin B.R. Nutr. Cancer. 1998; 30: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This conclusion is probably not accurate because, unlike genistein, daidzein is converted to equol (Fig. 1B) by the intestinal microflora, which can lead to bioactivation (24Xu X. Harris K.S. Wang H.J. Murphy P.A. Hendrich S. J. Nutr. 1995; 125: 2307-2315Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Specifically, after ingestion, daidzein is converted to equol (70%), dihydrodaidzein (10-25%), and O-desmethylangolensin (5-20%) (25Chang Y.C. Nair M.G. Nitiss J.L. J. Nat. Prod. 1995; 58: 1901-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The half-life in the body for equol is significantly longer compared with daidzein or genistein (26Kelly G.E. Joannou G.E. Reeder A.Y. Nelson C. Waring M.A. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1995; 208: 40-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), and equol is consistently reported to be present at high levels in the blood (27Rowland I.R. Wiseman H. Sanders T.A. Adlercreutz H. Bowey E.A. Nutr. Cancer. 2000; 36: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Several independent lines of evidence indicate that equol is one of the most biologically active metabolites of daidzein. In many cell types equol is more potent than daidzein in terms of its antioxidant properties (28Arora A. Nair M.G. Strasburg G.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). For example, equol at concentrations within the physiological range were shown to protect against hydrogen peroxide-mediated DNA damage in human lymphocytes as determined by alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis (29Sierens J. Hartley J.A. Campbell M.J. Leathem A.J. Woodside J.V. Mutat. Res. 2001; 485: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Equol was reported to exhibit protective effects against UV-induced DNA damage in hairless mice (30Widyarini S. J. Vet. Sci. 2006; 7: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Moreover, equol was shown to protect against UV-induced skin cancer in the hairless mouse model (31Widyarini S. Husband A.J. Reeve V.E. Photochem. Photobiol. 2005; 81: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The UV-induced activation of ornithine decarboxylase, a skin tumor promotion biomarker enzyme, was attenuated by equol treatment, indicating that the anticancer activity of equol may be attributed to its inhibition of the tumor promotion phase of carcinogenesis (31Widyarini S. Husband A.J. Reeve V.E. Photochem. Photobiol. 2005; 81: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These accumulated data represent evidence suggesting that equol is a potent chemopreventive agent against carcinogenesis, particularly skin cancer, but the underlying molecular mechanisms and molecular target(s) remain unclear. The skin is highly sensitive to TPA induction of MEK/ERK/AP-1 signaling activation and tumorigenesis (32Zhong S. Quealy J.A. Bode A.M. Nomura M. Kaji A. Ma W.Y. Dong Z. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4084-4091PubMed Google Scholar). In JB6 mouse epidermal cell lines, TPA and EGF were shown to induce AP-1 transcriptional activity in promotion-sensitive (P+), but not in promotion-resistant (P-), cellular phenotypes (1Dong Z. Birrer M.J. Watts R.G. Matrisian L.M. Colburn N.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). When AP-1 induction was blocked, P+ cells reverted to the P-phenotype, indicating that AP-1 activity is required for TPA- or EGF-induced cell transformation (1Dong Z. Birrer M.J. Watts R.G. Matrisian L.M. Colburn N.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The JB6 P+ mouse epidermal cell line provides a validated model for screening cancer chemopreventive agents and elucidating their molecular mechanisms of action (33Dong Z. Cmarik J.L. Sci. STKE 2002. 2002; : PL7Google Scholar). In the present study we compared the effects of equol and daidzein on TPA-induced AP-1 activity and cell transformation in JB6 P+ cells. We found that equol, but not daidzein, was a potent inhibitor of MEK activity and subsequently inhibited AP-1 transactivation and cell transformation. The results of this investigation suggested a molecular mechanism that underlies the chemopreventive activity of equol and might partially account for the chemopreventive effects of soybean foods. Chemicals—Equol, daidzein, TPA, and trypan blue solution were obtained from Sigma. Eagle's minimum essential medium (MEM), basal medium Eagle, gentamicin, and l-glutamine were purchased from Invitrogen; fetal bovine serum (FBS) was purchased from Gemini Bio-Products (Calabasas, CA). PD098059 was purchased from Calbiochem. The antibodies against phosphorylated MEK (Ser-217/221), phosphorylated ERK (Tyr-202/Tyr-204), total ERK, phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (Thr-183/Tyr-185), total c-Jun N-terminal kinase, phosphorylated p90RSK (Thr-359/Ser-363), total p90RSK, phosphorylated Elk-1 (Ser-383), and total Elk-1 were purchased from Cell Signal Biotechnology (Beverly, MA). The antibody against total MEK was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The MEK1 and Raf1 kinase assay kit was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). CNBr-Sepharose 4B, glutathione-Sepharose 4B, and [γ-32P]ATP were purchased from Amersham Biosciences, and the protein assay kit was from Bio-Rad. G418, the CellTiter96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit, and the luciferase assay substrate were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Cell Culture—The JB6 P+ mouse epidermal (JB6 P+) cell line and H-Ras-transformed JB6 P+ mouse epidermal (H-Ras JB6 P+) cell line were cultured in monolayers at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator in MEM containing 5% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 25 μg/ml gentamicin. The JB6 mouse epidermal cell line was stably transfected with an AP-1 luciferase reporter plasmid and maintained in MEM supplemented with 5% FBS containing 200 μg/ml G418. Cell Proliferation Assay—To estimate cell proliferation, JB6 P+ cells were seeded (103 cells/well) in 96-well plates with 5% FBS, MEM at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. After culturing for the indicated times, 20 μl of CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution (Promega) were added to each well, and the cells were then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Absorbance was measured at 492 and 690 nm. Cell Viability Assay—The trypan blue exclusion assay was based on the capability of viable cells to exclude the dye. Because viable JB6 P+ cells maintain membrane integrity, the cells do not allow trypan blue dye to pass through the cell membrane. Cells with damaged membrane appeared blue due to their accumulation of dye and were counted as dead. Trypan blue (0.4%) was added to JB6 P+ cells, and after 5 min, cells were loaded into a hematocytometer and counted. The number of viable cells was calculated as percent of the total cell population. Anchorage-independent Transformation Assay—The effects of daidzein or equol on TPA-induced cell transformation were investigated in JB6 P+ cells. Cells (8 × 103/ml) were exposed to TPA with or without daidzein (0-20 μm) or equol (0-100 μm) in 1 ml of 0.33% basal medium Eagle agar containing 10% FBS or in 3.5 ml of 0.5% basal medium Eagle agar containing 10% FBS. The cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 14 days, and the cell colonies were counted under a microscope with the aid of the Image-Pro Plus software (Version.4) program (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD) as described by Colburn et al. (34Colburn N.H. Wendel E.J. Abruzzo G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6912-6916Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Luciferase Assay for AP-1 Transactivation—Confluent monolayers of JB6 P+ cells stably transfected with an AP-1 luciferase reporter plasmid were trypsinized, and 8 × 103 viable cells suspended in 100 μl of 5% FBS, MEM were added to each well of a 96-well plate. Plates were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. When cells reached 80-90% confluence, they were starved by culturing them in 0.1% FBS, MEM for another 24 h. The cells were then treated for 1 h with daidzein (0-100 μm) or equol (0-100 μm) and then exposed to 20 ng/ml TPA for 24 h. After treatment, cells were disrupted with 100 μl of lysis buffer (0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8), 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm EDTA), and the luciferase activity was measured using a luminometer (Luminoskan Ascent, Thermo Electron, Helsinki, Finland). Reporter-gene Assay—The reporter gene assay for firefly luciferase activity was performed using lysates from transfected cells. In addition, the reporter gene vector pRL-SV40 (Promega) was co-transfected into each cell line, with the transfection efficiencies normalized to the Renilla luciferase activity generated by this vector. Cell lysates were prepared by first washing the transfected JB6 P+ cells once in phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C. After removing the phosphate-buffered saline completely, 500 μl of passive lysis buffer (Promega Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay system) were added, and the cells were incubated for 1 h with gentle shaking. The lysate was then transferred to a reaction tube, and the cellular debris was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant fraction was used for the measurement of firefly and Renilla luciferase activities. Cell lysates (20 μl each) were mixed with 100 μl of Luciferase Assay II reagent, and the emitted firefly luciferase light was measured (Luminoskan Ascent). Subsequently, the coelenterazine reagent (100 μl) containing the substrate for the emission of Renilla luciferase light was mixed to normalize the firefly luciferase data. The c-fos luciferase promoter (pFos-WT GL3) and constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Ron Prywes (Columbia University, New York, NY). Western Blotting—After the cells (1.5 × 106) were cultured in a 10-cm dish for 48 h, they were starved in serum-free medium for another 24 h to eliminate the influence of FBS on the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases. The cells were then treated with daidzein (0-100 μm) or equol (0-100 μm) for 1 h before they were exposed to 20 ng/ml TPA for different time periods. The harvested cells were disrupted, and the supernatant fractions were boiled for 5 min. The protein concentration was determined using a dye-binding protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) as described in the manufacturer's manual. Lysate protein (20 μg) was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). After blotting, the membrane was incubated with the specific primary antibody at 4 °C overnight. Protein bands were visualized by the chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) after hybridization with the horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The relative amounts of proteins associated with specific antibodies were quantified using Sicon Image (NIH, Bethesda, MD). In Vitro MEK1 and Raf1 Kinase Assay—The in vitro kinase assays were performed in accordance with the instructions provided by Upstate Biotechnology. In brief, every reaction contained 20 μl of assay dilution buffer (20 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and a magnesium-ATP mixture buffer. For MEK1, 1 μg of the inactive ERK2 substrate peptide was also included. For Raf1, 0.4 μg of inactive MEK1 and 1 μg of inactive ERK2 were included. A 4-μl aliquot was removed from the reaction mixture containing 20 μg of myelin basic protein substrate peptide and 10 μl of diluted [γ-32P]ATP solution and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. This mixture was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C, and then 25-μl aliquots were transferred onto p81 paper and washed 3 times with 0.75% phosphoric acid for 5 min per wash and once with acetone for 2 min. The radioactive incorporation was determined using a scintillation counter. The effects of daidzein (0-100 μm) or equol (0-100 μm) were evaluated by separately incubating each compound with the reaction mixtures at 30 °C for 30 min. Each experiment was performed 3 times. Ex Vivo MEK1 Immunoprecipitation and Kinase Assay—JB6 P+ cells were cultured to 80% confluence and then serumstarved in 0.1% FBS, MEM for 24 h at 37 °C. Cells were either treated or not treated with daidzein (0-100 μm) or equol (0-100 μm) for 1 h, then treated with 20 ng/ml TPA for 30 min, disrupted with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and finally centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min in a microcentrifuge. The lysates containing 500 μg of protein were used for immunoprecipitation with an antibody against MEK1 and then incubated at 4 °C overnight. Protein A/G Plus-agarose beads were then added, and the mixture was continuously rotated for another 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed 3 times with kinase buffer (20 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and then resuspended in 20 μl of 1× kinase buffer supplemented with 1 μg of inactive ERK2 and incubated for an additional 30 min at 30 °C. Then myelin basic protein (20 μg) and 10 μl of diluted [γ-32P]ATP solution were added, and the mixture was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. A 20-μl aliquot was transferred onto p81 paper and washed 3 times with 0.75% phosphoric acid for 5 min per wash and once with acetone for 2 min. The radioactive incorporation was determined using a scintillation counter. Each experiment was performed 3 times. In Vitro Pulldown Assay—Recombinant MEK1 (2 μg), Raf1 (2 μg), or a JB6 P+ cellular supernatant fraction (500 μg) was incubated with equol- or daidzein-Sepharose 4B (or -Sepharose 4B as control) beads (100 μl, 50% slurry) in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 2 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.02 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× protease inhibitor mixture). After incubation with gentle rocking overnight at 4 °C, the beads were washed 5 times with buffer (50 mm Tris, (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 0.02 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and proteins bound to the beads were analyzed by immunoblotting. ATP and Equol Competition Assay—Briefly, 0.2 μg of active MEK1 was incubated with 100 μl of equol-Sepharose 4B or 100 μl of Sepharose 4B in reaction buffer (see “In vitro Pulldown Assay” above) for 12 h at 4 °C, and ATP was added at different concentrations (1, 10, or 100 μm) to a final volume of 500 μl for 30 min. The samples were washed, and then proteins were detected by Western blot. Expression and Purification of Recombinant MEK1 Mutants—For the expression of full-length and deletion mutants of MEK1, the appropriate plasmids (pGEX-MEK1 and deletion mutants for GST-MEK1) were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21. Single colonies were selected after culturing in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium at 37 °C for 16 h with vigorous agitation. When liquid cultures exhibited an absorbance of 0.8 at 600 nm, they were diluted 100-fold with fresh LB medium. Isopropyl-d-thiogalactoside was added to these cultures at a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and cultures were then continuously agitated for another 3 h at 25 °C. The bacteria were collected by centrifugation (4000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C), and the pellets were disrupted by sonication. The lysate was again centrifuged, and the supernatant fraction was saved. A 50% slurry (250 μl) of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads was added to each sample and then mixed gently for 1 h at room temperature, and GST proteins were purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. The molecular mass and relative protein expression were estimated by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Molecular Modeling—Insight II (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA) was used for the docking study and structure analysis with the crystal coordinates of MEK1 (Protein Data Bank code 1S9J). Equol Has No Cytotoxic Effects on JB6 P+ Cells—Although daidzein has been reported to exhibit antiproliferative activities in several cell types (35Iwashita K. Kobori M. Yamaki K. Tsushida T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2000; 64: 1813-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), little is known about the effect of equol on cell proliferation. Therefore, we examined the effects of daidzein (Fig. 1A) or equol (Fig. 1B) on the proliferation of JB6 P+ cells using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxy-phenyl)-2-(4-sulfonyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay. Even though equol is a metabolite of daidzein, it did not significantly affect cell growth at 1, 3, or 5 days after treatment at concentrations up to 100 μm (Fig. 2A). By contrast, daidzein at a concentration of 50 μm was cytotoxic to JB6 P+ cells at 3 or 5 days after treatment (Fig. 2B). These results indicated that, compared with daidzein, equol was less cytotoxic to JB6 P+ cells. To further confirm these results, we examined the effect of equol on the viability of JB6 P+ cells using the trypan blue assay. Results confirmed that equol, at concentrations up to 100 μm, did not significantly affect cell viability at 1, 3, or 5 days after treatment (Fig. 2C), agreeing with the MTS assay results. Equol, but Not Daidzein, Inhibits TPA-induced Neoplastic Transformation of JB6 P+ Cells—We next examined the effect of equol and daidzein on TPA-induced neoplastic transformation of JB6 P+ cells. Based on the numbers of transformed cell colonies, treatment with equol (Fig. 3A) but not daidzein (Fig. 3B), significantly inhibited TPA-promoted neoplastic transformation of JB6 P+ cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). These results suggested that not only is equol less cytotoxic (Fig. 2) than daidzein, but is more effective at inhibiting TPA-induced neoplastic cell transformation of JB6 P+ cells. Equol Attenuates TPA-induced AP-1 and c-fos Activation in JB6 P+ Cells—AP-1 activation was previously shown to be required for neoplastic transformation in JB6 P+ cells (1Dong Z. Birrer M.J. Watts R.G. Matrisian L.M. Colburn N.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 36Huang C. Ma W.Y. Dawson M.I. Rincon M. Flavell R.A. Dong Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5826-5830Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). To determine whether the repression of transformation by equol involves the inhibition of AP-1 activity, we measured AP-1 transactivation using JB6 P+ cells stably transfected with an AP-1 luciferase reporter plasmid. Consistent with the above results for cell transformation, equol inhibited TPA-induced transactivation of AP-1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A), whereas daidzein at 25-100 μm exerted no significant effects (Fig. 4B). Because TPA induces c-fos expression mainly through the ERK signaling pathway and subsequently induces AP-1 transactivation, we next investigated whether equol could inhibit c-fos promoter activation using the reporter plasmid carrying the luc"
https://openalex.org/W1973184170,"p38 MAPK family consists of four isoform proteins (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta) that are activated by the same stimuli, but the information about how these proteins act together to yield a biological response is missing. Here we show a feed-forward mechanism by which p38alpha may regulate Ras transformation and stress response through depleting its family member p38gamma protein via c-Jun-dependent ubiquitin-proteasome pathways. Analyses of MAPK kinase 6 (MKK6)-p38 fusion proteins showed that constitutively active p38alpha (MKK6-p38alpha) and p38gamma (MKK6-p38gamma) stimulates and inhibits c-Jun phosphorylation respectively, leading to a distinct AP-1 regulation. Depending on cell type and/or stimuli, p38alpha phosphorylation results in either Ras-transformation inhibition or a cell-death escalation that invariably couples with a decrease in p38gamma protein expression. p38gamma, on the other hand, increases Ras-dependent growth or inhibits stress induced cell-death independent of phosphorylation. In cells expressing both proteins, p38alpha phosphorylation decreases p38gamma protein expression, whereas its inhibition increases cellular p38gamma concentrations, indicating an active role of p38alpha phosphorylation in negatively regulating p38gamma protein expression. Mechanistic analyses show that p38alpha requires c-Jun activation to deplete p38gamma proteins by ubiquitin-proteasome pathways. These results suggest that p38alpha may, upon phosphorylation, act as a gatekeeper of the p38 MAPK family to yield a coordinative biological response through disrupting its antagonistic p38gamma family protein."
https://openalex.org/W2032314327,"The MAPK kinase kinase MEKK4 is required for neurulation and skeletal patterning during mouse development. MEKK4 phosphorylates and activates MKK4/MKK7 and MKK3/MKK6 leading to the activation of JNK and p38, respectively. MEKK4 is believed to be auto-inhibited, and its interaction with other proteins controls its dimerization and activation. TRAF4, GADD45, and Axin each bind and activate MEKK4, with TRAF4 and Axin binding to the kinase domain and GADD45 binding within the N-terminal regulatory domain. Here we show that similar to the interaction with TRAF4 and Axin, the kinase domain of MEKK4 interacts with the multifunctional serine/threonine kinase GSK3β. GSK3β binding to MEKK4 blocks MEKK4 dimerization that is required for MEKK4 activation, effectively inhibiting MEKK4 stimulation of the JNK and p38 MAPK pathways. Inhibition of GSK3β kinase activity with SB216763 results in enhanced MEKK4 kinase activity and increased JNK and p38 activation, indicating that an active state of GSK3β is required for binding and inhibition of MEKK4 dimerization. Furthermore, GSK3β phosphorylates specific serines and threonines in the N terminus of MEKK4. Together, these findings demonstrate that GSK3β binds to the kinase domain of MEKK4 and regulates MEKK4 dimerization. However, unlike TRAF4, Axin, and GADD45, GSK3β inhibits MEKK4 activity and prevents its activation of JNK and p38.

Although the phenotypes of the dishevelled-2 knock-out and MEKK4 kinase-inactive knock-in are similar, there is no evidence that dishevelled-2 interacts with MEKK4. MEKK4 and dishevelled-2 are both binding partners of Axin, a scaffold protein involved in Wnt and Notch signaling (6Luo W. Lin S.C. NeuroSignals. 2004; 13: 99-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The binding of MEKK4 to Axin has been shown to regulate JNK activity (7Luo W. Ng W.W. Jin L.H. Ye Z. Han J. Lin S.C. J.

Tsutsui J. Takekawa M. Witten E.A. Saito H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4544-4555Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Binding to MEKK4 by activators, including TRAF4, GADD45α, -β, and -γ, and possibly Axin is thought to release MEKK4 from its auto-inhibited state and to promote MEKK4 homodimerization (5Abell A.N.

The requirement of MEKK4 dimerization in promoting activation was demonstrated using a chemical inducer of dimerization to activate MEKK4 (5Abell A.N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol.

The fact that MEKK4 and dishevelled-2 both bind Axin and appear genetically to be in the same pathway led us to search for other Axin-interacting proteins that would potentially regulate MEKK4 activity. Analysis of the MEKK4 primary sequence identified several putative GSK3 phosphorylation sites.GSK3 is a serine/threonine kinase that regulates multiple signaling pathways. There are two highly homologous isoforms, GSK3α and GSK3β. GSK3β is a constitutively active kinase that is regulated by phosphorylation, localization, and GSK3β-binding proteins (10Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar, 11Doble B.W. Woodgett J.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar). GSK3β is activated by phosphorylation of tyrosine 216 and negatively regulated by phosphorylation of serine 9 (10Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar, 11Doble B.W. Woodgett J.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar). GSK3β is a negative regulator of several signaling networks in cells. For example, GSK3 inhibits the canonical Wnt signaling pathway by promoting β-catenin degradation (10Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar, 11Doble B.W. Woodgett J.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar, 12Dominguez I. Green J.B. Dev. Biol. 2001; 235: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition, GSK3β has been shown to negatively regulate JNK activation, but the mechanism of this regulation is undefined (13Liu S. Yu S. Hasegawa Y. Lapushin R. Xu H.J. Woodgett J.R. Mills G.B. Fang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51075-51081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Here we show that GSK3β binds the kinase domain of MEKK4, inhibiting dimerization and MEKK4 activity. The findings define MEKK4 as a MAP3K regulated by GSK3β for the negative regulation of JNK and p38 signaling.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Lines, Culture Conditions, and Transfections—COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's high glucose media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin and streptomycin. Transfection of COS-7 cells was performed in 35- and 60-mm dishes for 24 h using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Trophoblast stem (TS) cells were isolated from blastocysts as described previously (14Tanaka S. Kunath T. Hadjantonakis A.K. Nagy A. Rossant J. Science. 1998; 282: 2072-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). Blastocysts were isolated at E3.5 from timed matings of 129 SvEv mice according to university and federal guidelines for the use of animals. TS cells were cultured without feeders in 30% TS media (RPMI 1640, 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1% sodium pyruvate, 1% penicillin and streptomycin, 1% glutamine, and 100 μm β-mercaptoethanol) and 70% conditioned media isolated from primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) cultured in TS media. Isolation of MEFs from littermate wild-type and homozygous MEKK4K1361R MEFs was described previously (1Abell A.N. Rivera-Perez J.A. Cuevas B.D. Uhlik M.T. Sather S. Johnson N.L. Minton S.K.

For treatment with GSK3 inhibitor, cells were incubated with 30 μm SB216763 (Sigma).Plasmids—Wild-type and K1361R FLAG-tagged MEKK4 were constructed as described previously (5Abell A.N. Johnson G.L.

Full-length HA-tagged MEKK4 and HA-tagged MEKK4 kinase domain were as described previously (15Gerwins P. Blank J.L. Johnson G.L. J. Biol.

HA-tagged GSK3β wild-type and K85M constructs were kind gifts of Xianjun Fang (Virginia Commonwealth University). Potential serine/threonine phosphorylation sites were mutated to alanines using the QuikChange® multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The resulting four mutated fragments were verified by sequencing and reinserted into full-length FLAG-tagged MEKK4.Immunoprecipitations, Western Blot Analysis, Measurement of JNK and p38 Activity, and Kinase Assays—For kinase assays using purified proteins, His-MEKK4 purified from Sf9 cells was incubated with His-GSK3β (Sigma) in kinase buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 10 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min at 30 °C. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, visualized by autoradiography, and quantitated using a PhosphorImager.

Kinase assays were performed as described previously (1Abell A.N. Rivera-Perez J.A. Cuevas B.D. Uhlik M.T. Sather S. Johnson N.L. Minton S.K. Lauder J.M. Winter-Vann A.M. Nakamura K. Magnuson T.

Briefly, immunoprecipitates were washed with cold kinase buffer described above. Reactions were incubated with kinase buffer containing kinase-inactive His-MKK6 and cold 0.5 mm ATP or 10 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min at 30 °C. Cold kinase assays were probed with anti-phospho-MKK3/6 (Cell Signaling), and radioactive assays were exposed to film and quantitated with a PhosphorImager.λ Protein Phosphatase Treatment—2.5 μg of His-MEKK4 purified from Sf9 cells or immunoprecipitated HA-MEKK4 from transfected COS-7 cells was incubated for 45 min at 30 °C in the absence or presence of 800 units of λ protein phosphatase (New England Biolabs). Phosphatase reactions were terminated by washing twice with cold buffer A containing phosphatase inhibitors and once with kinase buffer described above. Reactions were incubated with or without His-GSK3β in radioactive kinase buffer as described above.RESULTSGSK3β Phosphorylates MEKK4—The consensus sequence for GSK3β phosphorylation is (S/T)XXX(S/T)P (Fig. 1A) (11Doble B.W. Woodgett J.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar). The first serine or threonine in the consensus sequence is predicted to be phosphorylated by GSK3β. Although not absolutely required, GSK3β prefers substrates that are already phosphorylated on the second serine or threonine in the consensus sequence. This priming phosphorylation located four residues C-terminal to the GSK3β phosphorylation site is thought to increase the efficiency of GSK3β toward its substrates (11Doble B.W. Woodgett J.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar). Scanning of the MEKK4 sequence identified three consensus GSK3β phosphorylation sequences (Fig. 1A). All of the consensus sequences were located in the N terminus of MEKK4 (amino acids 1–1326), whereas none were found in the catalytic domain (amino acids 1327–1597). Two of the potential sites, Ser77 and Thr112, are located approximately 50 residues upstream of the GADD45 binding domain. The third site, Ser1237, is located within a putative dimerization domain located 90 residues upstream of the kinase domain (9Miyake Z. Takekawa M. Ge Q. Saito H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2765-2776Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that MEKK4 was a substrate for GSK3β, purified recombinant GSK3β and MEKK4 were used. MEKK4 purified from Sf9 cells was incubated with increasing units of recombinant GSK3β. In vitro kinase assays were performed, and phosphorylation of MEKK4 was quantitated (Fig. 1B). Addition of 2 units of GSK3β resulted in a 31-fold increase in MEKK4 phosphorylation demonstrating that MEKK4 is a direct phosphorylation substrate for GSK3β. Similar results were obtained using immunoprecipitated HA-MEKK4 as a substrate for purified GSK3β (Fig. 1C). Kinase-inactive MEKK4 (HA-MEKK4K1361M) was also a phosphorylation substrate for GSK3β (Fig. 1C). However, the autophosphorylation of GSK3β was not affected by the expression of either wild-type or kinase-inactive MEKK4K1361M (Fig. 1C).As described above, preferred substrates for GSK3β are generally primed by phosphorylation of a second site by another kinase (11Doble B.W. Woodgett J.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar). To test for a role of a second site priming phosphorylation on MEKK4, purified MEKK4 was treated with λ-phosphatase, a protein with activity toward phosphorylated serine, threonine, and tyrosine (Fig. 1D). Subsequent GSK3β in vitro kinase assays with control or phosphatase-treated MEKK4 demonstrated that phosphatase-treated MEKK4 was no longer a substrate for GSK3β, consistent with the known properties of previously defined GSK3β substrates (11Doble B.W. Woodgett J.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar). Identical results were obtained using λ-phosphatase-treated immunoprecipitated HA-MEKK4 (data not shown). Cumulatively, the findings in Fig. 1 demonstrate that MEKK4 is a prototypical in vitro GSK3β phosphorylation substrate.When expressed alone, transfected MEKK4 exhibits a modest basal level of phosphorylation and kinase activity (Fig. 2A), as predicted from studies suggesting that the N terminus of MEKK4 is auto-inhibitory (9Miyake Z. Takekawa M. Ge Q. Saito H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2765-2776Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In vitro kinase assay of coimmunoprecipitated GSK3β and MEKK4 from cell lysates resulted in a 21-fold increase in the GSK3β-dependent phosphorylation of MEKK4 compared with immunoprecipitation of MEKK4 in the absence of GSK3β (Fig. 2A). The addition of purified, recombinant MKK6, a MEKK4 substrate (16Takekawa M. Tatebayashi K. Saito H. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 295-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), to the in vitro kinase assay resulted in the expected MEKK4-dependent phosphorylation of MKK6. Strikingly, coimmunoprecipitation of GSK3β with MEKK4 resulted in a marked inhibition of MKK6 phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). This phosphorylation of MKK6 is MEKK4-dependent as kinase-inactive MEKK4K1361M that is phosphorylated by GSK3β was unable to phosphorylate MKK6 (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2GSK3β phosphorylates the N terminus of MEKK4. A, GSK3β phosphorylates MEKK4, and this phosphorylation is independent of MEKK4 kinase activity. COS-7 cells were transfected with HA-MEKK4wt or HA-MEKK4K1361M in the absence or presence of HA-GSK3β. HA-MEKK4 and HA-GSK3β were immunoprecipitated (IP) together with an anti-HA antibody, and immunoprecipitates were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with [γ-32P]ATP and purified His-MKK6. An autoradiogram shows the phosphorylation of MEKK4 is increased greater than 20-fold in the presence of HA-GSK3β. Because HA-GSK3β and His-MKK6 migrate very closely, phosphorylation of His-MKK6 was monitored using a phospho-specific antibody for MKK6. Equal expression of HA-MEKK4 and HA-GSK3β was monitored by Western blot with an anti-HA antibody. A representative experiment from three independent experiments with similar results is shown. B, GSK3β phosphorylates the N terminus of MEKK4. Cells were transfected with FLAG-MEKK4wt, the N terminus of MEKK4, or HA-MEKK4 kinase domain in the absence or presence of GSK3β. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with both anti-HA and anti-MEKK4 antibodies, and immunoprecipitates were incubated 20 min at 30 °C with [γ-32P]ATP. An autoradiogram shows the phosphorylation of full-length MEKK4, N terminus of MEKK4, and kinase domain alone of MEKK4. A representative experiment from four independent experiments with similar results is shown. C, GSK3β does not phosphorylate the kinase domain of MEKK4. COS-7 cells were transfected with full-length HA-MEKK4wt, wild-type HA-MEKK4wt kinase domain, or HA-MEKK4K1361R kinase domain in the absence or presence of HA-GSK3β. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody, and immunoprecipitates were incubated as described in B. An autoradiogram shows the phosphorylation of full-length MEKK4, GSK3β, and MEKK4 kinase domain. Western blotting with an anti-HA antibody shows equal protein expression. A representative experiment from two independent experiments with similar results is shown. D, phosphorylation of MEKK4 requires GSK3β kinase activity. COS-7 cells were transfected with HA-MEKK4wt in the absence or presence of HA-GSK3βwt or HA-GSK3βK85M. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody, and immunoprecipitates were incubated as described in B. An autoradiogram shows the phosphorylation of MEKK4. Western blotting with an anti-HA antibody shows equal protein expression.

Phosphorylation of full-length MEKK4 and the N terminus of MEKK4 in the presence of GSK3β was similar, suggesting that GSK3β phosphorylates the N terminus of MEKK4 (Fig. 2B). The kinase domain of MEKK4 is weakly autophosphorylated (Fig. 2, B and C), whereas the autophosphorylation of the kinase-inactive MEKK4K1361R kinase domain is completely inhibited (Fig. 2C). In the presence of GSK3β, autophosphorylation of the kinase domain of MEKK4 was significantly reduced (Fig. 2, B and C), even though the MEKK4 kinase domain does not appear to be a phosphorylation substrate for GSK3β (Fig. 2, B and C). Consistent with this conclusion, a downward mobility shift during SDS-PAGE of the kinase domain of MEKK4 was observed in the presence of GSK3β, suggesting that GSK3β inhibited the autophosphorylation of MEKK4. Fig. 2D shows that kinase-inactive GSK3β (GSK3βK85M) does not phosphorylate MEKK4, confirming that GSK3β kinase activity is essential for phosphorylation of MEKK4.Identification of MEKK4 Phosphorylation Sites for GSK3β—Fig. 1A identified three consensus sequences in MEKK4 as potential sites for GSK3β phosphorylation. Phosphatase treatment of MEKK4 inhibited GSK3β phosphorylation of MEKK4, suggesting a priming phosphorylation is required for GSK3β phosphorylation of MEKK4 (Fig. 1D). Both the consensus GSK3β phosphorylation site and the priming site were mutated in each of the three consensus sequences (Fig. 3A). Mutation of each GSK3β phosphorylation consensus sequence individually resulted in a partial loss of GSK3β-catalyzed phosphorylation of MEKK4 (Fig. 3B). Mutation of serine 1237 and 1241 in the third consensus sequence resulted in the greatest inhibition of MEKK4 phosphorylation (Fig. 3B). Mutation of multiple consensus sequences was generally additive with simultaneous mutation of all three sequences resulting in a very dramatic loss of MEKK4 phosphorylation catalyzed by GSK3β (Fig. 3C). These findings define three different sites of MEKK4 phosphorylation catalyzed by GSK3β.FIGURE 3Identification of specific residues in the N terminus of MEKK4 that are phosphorylated by GSK3β. A, description of MEKK4 phosphorylation mutants. B, phosphorylation of MEKK4 is reduced by mutation of specific serine and threonines in the N terminus of MEKK4. HA-GSK3β was transfected with either wild-type or phosphorylation mutant FLAG-MEKK4 constructs as indicated. HA-GSK3β and FLAG-MEKK4 were immunoprecipitated (IP) together with anti-HA and anti-FLAG antibodies, and immunoprecipitates were incubated for 20 min with [γ-32P]ATP. Autoradiograms (Autorad) show phosphorylation of MEKK4 and GSK3β. Western blotting with anti-FLAG and anti-HA antibodies shows equal expression of FLAG-MEKK4 and HA-GSK3β. Phosphorylation of MEKK4 was measured using a PhosphorImager. Percent phosphorylation of MEKK4 was calculated by dividing mutant MEKK4 phosphorylation in the presence of HA-GSK3β by the phosphorylation of MEKK4wt in the presence of HA-GSK3β. A representative experiment from two independent experiments with similar results is shown. C, substitution of all putative GSK3β phosphorylation sites results in a 71% reduction in MEKK4 phosphorylation. Experiments were performed as described in B. The percent phosphorylation of MEKK4 phosphorylation mutants relative to wild-type MEKK4 obtained from two independent experiments expressed as the mean ± range for M1, M2, and M3 and obtained from three independent experiments expressed as the mean ± S.E. for M4 and M5 were the following: M1, 72.8 ± 2.1; M2, 82.9 ± 2.9; M3, 67.7 ± 13.1; M4, 46.9 ± 13.8; and M5, 22.6 ± 8.9.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Endogenous GSK3β and MEKK4 Are Binding Partners—Cumulatively, the findings in Figs. 1, 2, 3 clearly demonstrate that MEKK4 is a GSK3β phosphorylation substrate. The findings in Fig. 2, A–C, and Fig. 3 are striking but seemed at first to be somewhat contradictory. First, GSK3β phosphorylates three sites N-terminal to the kinase domain and inhibits MEKK4 phosphorylation of MKK6. Second, GSK3β appears to inhibit the autophosphorylation activity of the MEKK4 kinase domain even though the MEKK4 kinase domain is not phosphorylated by GSK3β. For these reasons, the interaction of endogenous MEKK4 and GSK3β was examined by coimmunoprecipitation (Fig. 4A). Unlike GSK3β that is expressed ubiquitously and strongly in most cell types, MEKK4 is expressed rather weakly in most adult cell types (1Abell A.N. Rivera-Perez J.A. Cuevas B.D. Uhlik M.T. Sather S. Johnson N.L. Minton S.K. Lauder J.M. Winter-Vann A.M. Nakamura K. Magnuson T. Vaillancourt R.R. Heasley L.E. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell.

However, MEKK4 is expressed strongly during development in both embryonic and extraembryonic cells (1Abell A.N. Rivera-Perez J.A. Cuevas B.D. Uhlik M.T. Sather S. Johnson N.L. Minton S.K. Lauder J.M.

Flavell R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3846-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Therefore, the association of endogenous GSK3β and MEKK4 was examined using trophoblast stem (TS) cells, which are epithelial extraembryonic cells that differentiate to form the tissues of the placenta (14Tanaka S. Kunath T. Hadjantonakis A.K. Nagy A. Rossant J. Science. 1998; 282: 2072-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of TS cell lysates with anti-GSK3β antibody resulted in the specific coimmunoprecipitation of MEKK4 with GSK3β (Fig. 4A). MEKK4 did not coimmunoprecipitate with a nonspecific anti-rabbit antibody (Fig. 4A). These data show the specific association of endogenous GSK3β and MEKK4 in TS cells.FIGURE 4The association of MEKK4 and GSK3β. A, endogenous coimmunoprecipitation of MEKK4 and GSK3β.

https://openalex.org/W2112145177,"The primary pharmacological target of acetaminophen is prostaglandin endoperoxide H2 synthase (PGHS). The enzymatic catalytic mechanism is radical-based, initiated, and maintained by the persistent presence of peroxides, particularly peroxynitrite, which is termed ""peroxide tone"". Whereas the prevailing concept assumes a direct reduction of the active, oxidized enzyme by acetaminophen, here we show that acetaminophen is a potent scavenger of peroxynitrite (peroxynitrite-mediated phenol nitration, IC50 approximately 72 microM; Sin-1-mediated DHR123 oxidation, IC50 approximately 11 microM) and thus inhibits PGHS by eliminating the peroxide tone. Nanomolar concentrations of peroxynitrite increased the activity of isolated PGHS and prostacyclin formation by aortic endothelial cells. This elevated activity was efficiently inhibited by pharmacologically relevant concentrations of acetaminophen (IC50 approximately 10 microM for 6-keto-PGF1alpha) and other free radical scavengers. However, when the peroxide tone was provided by H2O2 or tert-butyl-OOH, acetaminophen had only negligible inhibitory effects. Our concept could help to explain the efficacy of acetaminophen to inhibit PGHS in cell types with moderate oxidant formation. However, high levels of peroxynitrite or other peroxides such as lipid peroxides formed at inflammatory sites might overwhelm the ability of acetaminophen to decrease PGHS activation. The concept presented herein provides a molecular basis to explain the excellent analgesic and antipyretic properties of acetaminophen together with its minimal anti-inflammatory effects."
https://openalex.org/W1995489986,"Molecular evolutionary analyses revealed that histone H2A.Bbd is a highly variable quickly evolving mammalian replacement histone variant, in striking contrast to all other histones. At the nucleotide level, this variability appears to be the result of a larger amount of nonsynonymous variation, which affects to a lesser extent, the structural domain of the protein comprising the histone fold. The resulting amino acid sequence diversity can be predicted to affect the internucleosomal and intranucleosomal histone interactions. Our phylogenetic analysis has allowed us to identify several of the residues involved. The biophysical characterization of nucleosomes reconstituted with recombinant mouse H2A.Bbd and their comparison to similar data obtained with human H2A.Bbd clearly support this notion. Despite the high interspecific amino acid sequence variability, all of the H2A.Bbd variants exert similar structural effects at the nucleosome level, which result in an unfolded highly unstable nucleoprotein complex. Such structure resembles that previously described for the highly dynamically acetylated nucleosomes associated with transcriptionally active regions of the genome. Nevertheless, the structure of nucleosome core particles reconstituted from H2A.Bbd is not affected by the presence of a hyperacetylated histone complement. This suggests that replacement by H2A.Bbd provides an alternative mechanism to unfold chromatin structure, possibly in euchromatic regions, in a way that is not dependent on acetylation."
https://openalex.org/W2022379516,"The serine-threonine kinase PAK1 is activated by small GTPase-dependent and -independent mechanisms and promotes cell survival. However, the role of tyrosyl phosphorylation in the regulation of PAK1 function is poorly understood. In this study, we have shown that the prolactin-activated tyrosine kinase JAK2 phosphorylates PAK1 in vivo. Wild type, but not kinase-dead, JAK2 directly phosphorylates PAK1 in cells and in an in vitro kinase assay. PAK1 tyrosines 153, 201, and 285 were identified as sites of JAK2 tyrosyl phosphorylation by mass spectrometry and two-dimensional peptide mapping. Mutation of PAK1 tyrosines 153, 201, and 285 to phenylalanines individually or in combination implicated these PAK1 tyrosines in the regulation of PAK1 kinase activity. Tyrosyl phosphorylation by JAK2 significantly increases PAK1 kinase activity, whereas similar phosphorylation of the PAK1 Y153F,Y201F,Y285F mutant has no effect on PAK1 activity. Tyrosyl phosphorylation of wild type PAK1 decreases apoptosis induced by serum deprivation and staurosporine treatment and increases cell motility. In contrast, these parameters are unaltered in the PAK1 Y153F,Y201F,Y285F mutant.

The emerging roles of PAK1 in the regulation of multiple fundamental cellular processes have directed significant attention toward understanding how PAK1 activity is controlled. Autoinhibition of the PAK1 C-terminal catalytic domain by the N-terminal domain is a key mechanism of PAK1 regulation. Several layers of inhibition, involving dimerization and occupation of the catalytic cleft by contact between the N- and C-terminal domains, keep PAK1 kinase activity in check (4Lei M. Lu W. Meng W. Parrini M.C. Eck M.J. Mayer B.J. Harrison S.C. Cell. 2000; 102: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Autoinhibition of PAK1 occurs in trans, meaning that the inhibitory domain of one PAK1 molecule interacts with the kinase domain of another PAK1 molecule (5Parrini M.C. Lei M. Harrison S.C. Mayer B.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Association of GTP-bound forms of Cdc42 and Rac1 with the PAK1 PBD/CRIB domain induces conformational changes in the N-terminal domain that no longer support its autoinhibitory function. In addition to Cdc42 and Rac1, PAK1 is activated by the binding of small GTPases, Rac2 and Rac3, as well as TC10, CHP, and Wrich-1 proteins (6Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L.

In addition to PDK, several other protein kinases regulate PAK1. Thus, Akt1 phosphorylates PAK1 at Ser21, decreasing Nck binding to the PAK1 N terminus and stimulating PAK1 activity (18Tang Y.

In addition, a multiprotein complex containing Tyr-phosphorylated and highly active PAK was identified in constitutively activated v-ErbB receptor-transformed cells. Formation of this complex appeared to be Rho-dependent (25McManus M.J. Boerner J.L. Danielsen A.J. Wang Z. Matsumura F. Maihle N.J. J. Biol.

PAK2 phosphorylation at Tyr130 by Src kinase strongly potentiates action of Cdc42/Rac1 on PAK2 (26Renkema G.H. Pulkkinen K. Saksela K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6719-6725Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Another tyrosine kinase, Abl, associates with PAK2 in vivo and decreases PAK2 kinase activity concomitantly with PAK2 Tyr phosphorylation on multiple sites (27Roig J. Tuazon P.T. Zipfel P.A.

These studies suggest that the tyrosine kinase-dependent modulation of PAK1 activity may provide important mechanism(s) enabling cells to respond appropriately to different external stimuli. PAKs have been implicated in apoptosis, possessing either anti-apoptotic (PAK1, PAK4, and PAK5) or both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic (PAK2) properties (for review see Refs. 1Bokoch G.M. Annu.

PAK1 is activated by growth factors (epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor), and cytokines that promote cell survival. The survival signals induced by PAKs might be related to phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bad (Bcl-2 family member), Raf-1, the forkhead transcriptional factor (FKHR), BimL (that interacts with and inactivates the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2), and dynein light chain 1 (18Tang Y.

The anti-apoptotic effects of PAK1 also may be mediated by activation of NFκB, a critical transcription factor involved in cell survival (34Karin M. Lin A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2445) Google Scholar). PAK1 mediates NFκB activation by Ras, Raf-1, and Rac1 and the expression of active PAK1 can stimulate NFκB on its own without activation of the inhibitor of κB kinases (35Frost J.A. Swantek J.L.

PAK1 plays a key role in coordinating dynamic reorganizations of the actin and microtubule cytoskletons. PAK1 is localized in areas of the cortical actin cytoskeleton (36Dharmawardhane S.

JAK2 is a tyrosine kinase that is activated by approximately two-thirds of the cytokine hematopoietin superfamily of receptors, including receptors for γ-interferons, most interleukins, ciliary neurotrophic factor, leptin, growth hormone, prolactin, leukemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M, erythropoietin, and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (43Murata T.

The activation of JAK2 tyrosine kinase initiates a variety of downstream signaling events that lead to diverse physiological responses to cytokines, including regulation of body growth, hematopoiesis, satiety, lactation, and various components of immune function (47Parganas E.

The widely expressed SH2 domain-containing protein SH2-Bβ was initially identified as a binding partner and substrate of JAK2 (48Rui L. Mathews L.S. Hotta K. Gustafson T.A. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6633-6644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SH2-Bβ binds preferentially via its SH2 domain to the tyrosyl-phosphorylated, active form of JAK2. SH2-Bβ binding dramatically increases JAK2 activity and enhances the tyrosyl phosphorylation of downstream targets of JAK2, such as STAT5 (49Rui L. Carter-Su C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7172-7177Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Both JAK2 and PAK1 play critical roles in cell survival and their dysregulation can have negative consequences in terms of human disease. However, there is a gap between upstream JAK2 events and downstream PAK1 and PAK1-dependent cell survival. Elucidation of the mechanism by which signaling events downstream of JAK2 are regulated is therefore critical for our understanding of JAK2 signaling. Here we report that prolactin-activated JAK2 phosphorylates PAK1. We mapped three sites of JAK2-dependent phosphorylation of PAK1 and showed that phosphorylation at these sites significantly increases PAK1 kinase activity. In addition, these three phosphorylated tyrosines are required for maximal anti-apoptotic and motility-promoting PAK1 activities. Together, these results indicate that PAK1 is a new member of a JAK2-dependent signaling pathway playing an important role in cell survival and cell migration.

Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 1751-1755PubMed Google Scholar) were provided by Dr. Yu-Lee (Baylor College of Medicine) and Dr. Buckley (University of Cincinnati). The cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech Cellgro) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), 10% horse serum (HyClone), 10-4 m 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), 1 mm glutamine (HyClone), 100 units of penicillin (HyClone) per ml, and 100 mg of streptomycin (HyClone) per ml. COS-7 and 293T cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech Cellgro) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (for COS-7) or 10% calf serum (Mediatech Cellgro, for 293T cells), 1 mm glutamine, 100 units of penicillin/ml, and 100 mg of streptomycin/ml. Immortalized normal mammary epithelial (HME) cells were provided by Drs. Ethier (Karmanos Cancer Institute, MI) and Band (Northwestern University, IL). The cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium (Mediatech Cellgro) supplemented with 5 μg/ml insulin (Sigma), 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma), 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (Sigma), 100 ng/ml cholera toxin (Sigma), 2.5 μg/ml plasmocin (Amaxa), 2.5 μg/ml fungizone (Invitrogen), 5 μg/ml gentamicin (Invitrogen), and 5% fetal bovine serum. Co-immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—For prolactin treatment, the Nb2 cells were rendered quiescent by growth in maintenance medium with 3% horse serum and no fetal bovine serum in the presence or absence of 50 μm AG 490 (Calbiochem) for 24 h at 1 × 107 cells/ml and treated with 10 nm ovine prolactin for 10 min (purchased from Dr. Parlov, National Hormone and Peptide Program, NIDDK, National Institutes of Health). PAK1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-PAK1 Ab and protein A-agarose, resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-Tyr(P), anti-PAK1, and anti-JAK2 Abs. 293T cells were transiently transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation. HA-PAK1 was overexpressed with JAK2 or JAK2 K882E, and SH2-Bβ. The cells were serum deprived overnight and PAK1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA, rabbit anti-mouse IgG, and protein A-agarose and resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with the indicated AB. In Vitro Kinase Assay—HA-PAK1 was overexpressed with JAK2 or JAK2 K882E, and SH2-Bβ in 293T cells. After overnight deprivation, the cells were lysed, HA-PAK1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA and immune complexes were collected using protein A-agarose. The immobilized PAK1 was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in 50 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (ICN), 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin (39Sells M.A. Pfaff A. Chernoff J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1449-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Precipitates were washed extensively with lysis buffer and protein A-agarose-PAK1-JAK2 complexes were pelleted. Radiolabeled proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and visualized by autoradiography followed by immunoblotting with anti-Tyr(P), anti-JAK2, and anti-PAK1 Abs. For pull-down assays, JAK2 or JAK2 K882E were overexpressed with SH2-Bβ-(504-670) in 293T cells, and immunoprecipitated with anti-JAK2. The immobilized JAK2 was incubated with 1 μg of GST-PAK1 in the kinase buffer as described above and PAK1 phosphorylation was assessed. To assess PAK1 in vitro kinase activity, HA-tagged wild type or mutated PAK1 or Myc-tagged PAK1 K299R were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA or anti-Myc Abs from 293T cells and subjected to in vitro kinase assay in the presence of 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 1 μm ATP, and 5 μg of histone H4 (substrate of PAK1). Relative levels of incorporation of 32P into histone H4, an indicator of phosphorylation, were assessed by autoradiography and estimated by phosphorimager. The same membrane was blotted with anti-HA or anti-Myc to assess the amount of PAK1 for each condition. Nitrocellulose patterns were scanned and the amount of PAK1 was quantified using Multi-Analyst (Bio-Rad) software. Relative PAK1 kinase activity was then normalized by the amount of immunoprecipitated PAK1 for each lane. Phosphopeptide Mapping and Phosphoamino Acid Analysis—Wild type and mutant forms of HA-tagged PAK1 were co-expressed with JAK2 and SH2-Bβ in 293T cells. The cells were deprived of serum overnight. PAK1 were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA and incubated with 0.5 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP as described above. Proteins will be resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and visualized by autoradiography. The region of the nitrocellulose containing 32P-labeled PAK1 was excised, soaked in 500 μl of 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone in 100 mm acetic acid at 37 °C for 30 min, and digested with 5 μg of methylated trypsin (Promega) for 4 h at 37 °C. Digested peptides were lyophilized, oxidized in performic acid, and re-lyophilized. Peptides were then separated first by thin layer electrophoresis and then in the second dimension by ascending chromatography (53Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T.

Detection of Phosphorylation Sites by Tandem MS—HA- or Myc-tagged PAK1 was overexpressed in 293T cells with JAK2 and SH2-Bβ. The cells were serum deprived overnight and PAK1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA or anti-Myc and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Gel slices containing PAK1 were digested with 5 ng/μl sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega) in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate containing 0.01% n-octylglucoside for 18 h at 37 °C. Peptides were eluted from the gel slices with 80% acetonitrile, 1% formic acid. Tryptic digests were separated by capillary high pressure liquid chromatography (C18, 75 μm inner diameter Picofrit column, New Objective) using a flow rate of 100 nl/min over a 3-h reverse phase gradient and analyzed using a LTQ linear Ion Trap LC/MSn system (Thermo Electron). Resultant MS/MS spectra were matched against the PAK1 sequence using TurboSequest (BioWorks 3.2, Thermo Electron) with fragment ion tolerance <0.3 and amino acid modification variables including phosphorylation (80 Da) of Ser, Thr, and Tyr, and oxidation (16 Da) of Met. PAK1 Gene Silencing—For synthesis of PAK1 siRNA in vivo, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with cDNA encoding PAK1 pSUPER-GFP targeting the PAK1 mRNA or control pSUPER-GFP that produces a siRNA that is 2 base pairs different from the PAK1 siRNA using Nucleofector kit V (Amaxa Biosystmes) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 72 h, cells were analyzed for PAK1 by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with anti-PAK1. Apoptosis Assay—COS-7 cells grown on coverslips were transfected with cDNA encoding myc-PAK1 T423E, myc-PAK1 K299R, HA-PAK1 WT, HA-PAK1 Y3F, JAK2, or JAK2 K882E as indicated using FuGENE 6 (Roche) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In 24 h the cells were serum-deprived and treated with 50 nm staurosporine. In 16 h the cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde solution for 30 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton, and incubated with 2% human serum for 15 min for blocking of nonspecific staining. Next, the coverslips were incubated with anti-HA or anti-Myc Ab followed by rabbit anti-mouse/Oregon Green AB (Molecular Probes, Inc.) and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes, Inc.). After washing, the coverslips were incubated with the TUNEL reaction mixture (Roche) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The images presented are representative of at least 3 separate experiments. In all cases staining by secondary antibody reagent alone was negligible (not shown). Apoptotic index was calculated as a ratio of amount of TUNEL- and tag-positive cells to the amount of tag-positive cells (for at least 100 cells for each experiment). Each experiment was repeated at least three times, data were pooled, the average apoptotic index for each condition was plotted and analyzed using two-tailed unpaired t test. When individual experiments were analyzed, the results were indistinguishable from those obtained from the pooled data. Differences were considered to be statistically significant at p < 0.05. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Phagokinetc Assay—For the phagokinetic assay, HME cells were transfected with cDNA encoding myc-PAK1 T423E, HA-PAK1 WT, HA-PAK1 Y3F, JAK2, or JAK2 K882E as indicated using Express-Fect (Denville Scientific, Inc.) and plated on colloid gold-covered coverslips 48 h after transfection (55Albrecht-Buehler G.

The incubation time (16 h) was experimentally determined to avoid the overlapping of the particle-free areas produced by neighbor cells. In 16 h the coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min, and incubated with anti-HA or anti-Myc followed by goat anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate. F-actin was stained with Texas Red-phalloidin. Individual transfected cells were located with a fluorescein isothiocyanate filer set using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope.

The particle-free area was measured in three independent experiments for about 50 cells. The phagokinetic index was cal"
https://openalex.org/W2010770459,"RNF8 is a ubiquitin ligase with a FHA domain near its N terminus, and a RING-finger domain at its C terminus, through which it recruits several ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. In metazoans, only the mitotic checkpoint regulator CHFR shares this domain architecture. Here we show that RNF8 is a nuclear protein that follows a cell-cycle-dependent turnover, reaching its highest levels in mitosis, followed by a strong decline in late mitotic stages. Overexpression of RNF8 caused a delay in cytokinesis and the frequent appearance of aberrant mitotic figures. These effects were dependent on the ubiquitin ligase activity of RNF8, since they were significantly attenuated when a RING-finger mutant, inactive as an E3, was overexpressed. Depletion of RNF8 also caused a delay in the exit from the mitotic arrest induced by nocodazole, associated with a reduced turnover of the APC/C substrate cyclin B1. These observations suggest that RNF8 regulates the rate of exit from mitosis and cytokinesis."
https://openalex.org/W2054495459,"The mechanism underlying the interaction of the Escherichia coli signal recognition particle (SRP) receptor FtsY with the cytoplasmic membrane is not fully understood. We investigated this issue by utilizing active (NG+1) and inactive (NG) mutants of FtsY. In solution, the mutants comparably bind and hydrolyze nucleotides and associate with SRP. In contrast, a major difference was observed in the cellular distribution of NG and NG+1. Unlike NG+1, which distributes almost as the wild-type receptor, the inactive NG mutant accumulates on the membrane, together with ribosomes and SRP. The results suggest that NG function is compromised only at a later stage of the targeting pathway and that despite their identical behavior in solution, the membrane-bound NG-SRP complex is less active than NG+1-SRP. This notion is strongly supported by the observation that lipids stimulate the GTPase activity of NG+1-SRP, whereas no stimulation is observed with NG-SRP. In conclusion, we propose that the SRP receptor has two distinct and separable roles in (i) mediating membrane targeting and docking of ribosomes and (ii) promoting their productive release from the docking site.

Membrane-bound ribosomes are responsible for the biosynthesis of many integral membrane proteins that insert into the membrane in a co-translational manner (1Luirink J. Kim G. Houben E. de Gier J.W.

Besides its interaction with the inner membrane, FtsY functionally interacts with the SRP and the SRP protein Ffh in a nucleotide-dependent manner (reviewed in Ref. 5Luirink J. Kim I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1694: 17-35PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, additional studies demonstrated that FtsY forms a complex with membrane-bound ribosomes (6Herskovits A.A. Kim E. Minsky A. Bibi E. J.

These observations thus underscore the central role of the SRP receptor in ribosome targeting and biogenesis of membrane proteins (1Luirink J. Kim G. Houben E. de Gier J.W. Annu. Rev.

However, despite extensive genetic, biochemical, and structural studies, important aspects of the function of FtsY are not yet fully understood. At steady state, FtsY is distributed between the cytoplasm and the membrane (10Luirink J. Kim C.M. van der Weijden C.C. Oudega B. High S. Dobberstein B. Kusters R.

Interestingly, however, FtsY has no known membrane anchor partner homologous to the mammalian β-subunit of the SRP receptor. FtsY contains three domains. The C-terminal N- and G-domains (together 302 residues long) constitute a universally conserved SRP-GTPase (13Montoya G. Kim C. Luirink J. Sinning I. Nature. 1997; 385: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) that interacts with the homologous NG domain of the SRP protein Ffh. In its N terminus, FtsY contains an acidic A-domain (195 residues long) that was proposed to mediate membrane targeting and association of the receptor. Nevertheless, A-domain-truncated FtsY versions exhibit strong affinity for membranes (14de Leeuw E. Kim D. Mol O. Sinning I. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Oudega B. Luirink J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 15de Leeuw E. Kim K. Moser C. Menestrina G. Demel R. de Kruijff B. Oudega B. Luirink J. Sinning I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 531-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), possibly through the N-domain (16Millman J.S. Kim D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33227-33234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This interaction is dominated by electrostatic forces (15de Leeuw E. Kim K. Moser C. Menestrina G. Demel R. de Kruijff B. Oudega B. Luirink J. Sinning I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 531-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and is abolished by protease treatment of the membranes. The current view of FtsY association with the inner membrane combines interactions with lipids and protein(s). However, the mechanisms underlying these interactions and their functional importance remain largely unknown. Recently we have shown by deletion analysis that FtsY retains its essential functions in vivo in the absence of the 195-residue-long A-domain (termed NG+1) (17Eitan A. Kim E. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2492-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Interestingly, removal of a single N-terminal amino acid (Phe196) from NG+1 (termed NG) inactivates the receptor by an unknown mechanism. By investigating the functional differences between NG+1 and NG in vivo, and their interactions with SRP, nucleotides, SecYEG translocon, and the cytoplasmic membrane, we now show that although NG functions properly during membrane targeting and docking of ribosomes, it is defective at a late stage of the pathway, which consequently leads to dissociation of the ribosomes from their putative docking site. The results strongly suggest that this later step requires stimulation of FtsY-GTPase activity by lipids and that the response of the inactive NG mutant to lipids is impaired. Materials—Antibodies to FtsY, Ffh, and ribosomes were described previously (6Herskovits A.A. Kim E. Minsky A. Bibi E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 18Herskovits A.A. Kim A. Rajsbaum R. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Henrichs T. Bochkareva E.S. Phillips G.J. Probst F.J. Nakae T.

Bacterial Strains—E. coli HB101 was used for propagation and preparation of various plasmid constructs. E. coli FJP10 (18Herskovits A.A. Kim A. Rajsbaum R. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Henrichs T. Bochkareva E.S. Phillips G.J. Probst F.J. Nakae T. Ehrmann M. Luirink J. Bibi E. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1040-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and E. coli IY28, 4I. Yosef and E. Bibi, unpublished observations. which contain a chromosomal ftsY gene under the arabinose promoter, were used for FtsY complementation experiments. E. coli BL21 was used for the overexpression of SRP and FtsY mutants. E. coli UT5600 was used for studying membrane association of FtsY mutants, ribosomes, and SRP. Interaction of NG Mutants with Guanosine Nucleotides—Dissociation constants were determined by fluorescence titration experiments as described previously (19Moser C. Kim O. Goody R.S. Sinning I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11339-11344Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). GTP hydrolysis experiments were carried out as described previously (15de Leeuw E. Kim K. Moser C. Menestrina G. Demel R. de Kruijff B. Oudega B. Luirink J. Sinning I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 531-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.5 nmol of protein were incubated in the presence of 0.5 nmol of SRP and GTP at a concentration of 1 mm (dotted with approximately 400 kBq of [γ-32P]GTP). The reactions (total volume of 250 μl) were monitored for 30 min, and the total amount of GTP hydrolyzed was determined. Stimulation by liposomes was determined as described above (in the presence of SRP), after preincubation with preformed liposomes (70% phosphatidylethanolamine and 30% phosphatidylglycerol). Large unilamellar vesicles were prepared as described previously (14de Leeuw E. Kim D. Mol O. Sinning I. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Oudega B. Luirink J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by calculation of the absorption coefficients at 280 nm according to Gill and von Hippel (20Gill S.C. Kim P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar) and measured in 5.4 m guanidinium HCl, 20 mm phosphate, pH 6.5. Cell Fractionation, Gel Electrophoresis, and Immunoblotting—Harvested cultures were washed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (for SDS-PAGE experiments) or 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgOAc, 50 mm KOAc, 5% sucrose, 250 mm NH4Cl, 0.1 mm EDTA (for membrane purification experiments), and resuspended in the same buffer. The cell suspensions were sonicated, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation (5 min at 13,000 rpm). The membranes were collected by ultracentrifugation (45 min at 150,000 × g). Floatation centrifugation, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (6Herskovits A.A. Kim E. Minsky A. Bibi E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Interaction of NG Mutants with SRP—Cytosolic fractions of E. coli overexpressing SRP (10 μg of total protein) were incubated (30 min at room temperature) with purified His6-tagged NG mutants (10 μg) with or without 2 mm GMP-PNP. After incubation the NG-SRP complexes were isolated using Ni-NTA and then separated by SDS-PAGE. The dissociation constants were obtained from similar equilibrium binding assays using constant amounts of cytosolic fractions containing SRP (10 μg of total protein) and increasing concentrations of purified His6-tagged NG mutants in the presence of 1 mm GMP-PNP. Kd values were obtained by a nonlinear regression fit of experimental data to Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The dissociation of NG-SRP complexes was studied as follows: cytosolic fractions of E. coli overexpressing SRP (10 μg of total protein) were incubated (30 min at room temperature) with purified His6-tagged NG mutants (10 μg) with or without 1 mm GMP-PNP. Next, the complexes were bound to Ni-NTA. The samples that were incubated with GMP-PNP were now washed (twice) with 1 mm GMP-PNP or 2 mm GTP. The samples that were incubated without GMP-PNP were now washed without guanine nucleotides. Finally, all of the samples were incubated (30 min at room temperature) and washed (twice) with or without the respective nucleotide and separated by SDS-PAGE. Growth Experiments and FtsY Complementation Studies—The cultures were grown at 37 °C in LB medium, supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml), kanamycin (10-30 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (10 μg/ml), and spectinomycin (33 μg/ml) when necessary. For growth experiments in liquid medium, the cells were grown overnight at 37 °C and then diluted to A600 of 0.01. In experiments with E. coli IY28, cells were diluted to A600 0.0005. In experiments with E. coli FJP10, the cells were diluted to A600 of 0.03. FtsY complementation experiments were also executed by plating transformed cells, harboring various constructs, on LB agar plates with or without arabinose, the inducer of the chromosomal ftsY, and when necessary the indicated inducer of the complementing constructs (IPTG or arabinose). Co-precipitation Studies—E. coli UT5600 cultures expressing NG-His6 or NG+1-His6 were induced by IPTG (0.5 mm) for 2 h and harvested. The cells were sonicated in the presence of 1 mm Pefabloc and 10 μg/ml DNase and centrifuged (10,000 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C), and the supernatants were ultracentrifuged (150,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C). The pellets were homogenized in 0.1 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 20% glycerol, and 1 mm Pefabloc. Samples containing the same amount of proteins were solubilized in 1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside (DDM) by homogenization and 30 min of incubation on ice. Nonsolubilized material was removed by ultracentrifugation (55,000 rpm, 30 min, 4 °C). The supernatants were incubated with pre-equilibrated Ni-NTA beads (60 μl) in 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 20% glycerol, 250 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazol, and 0.02% DDM, for 1 h at 4 °C with agitation for binding of NG-His6 or NG+1-His6 and associated membrane proteins. The beads were washed three times with 0.5 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 20% glycerol, 250 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazol, and 0.02% DDM, and the bound proteins were eluted using the same buffer (0.5 ml) supplemented with 200 mm imidazol. Eluated proteins were concentrated 10-fold, using 2 ml Vivaspin concentrators (10,000 Da). Nucleotide Binding and Hydrolysis by NG and NG+1—To examine their enzymological properties, we purified and analyzed NG and NG+1 for their nucleotide binding activities and GTP hydrolysis in the presence of SRP. The binding affinities of NG+1 and NG for nucleotides were determined by measuring the steady state dissociation constant of each mutant for GDP (Fig. 1, A and B) and GTP (Fig. 1, C and D), using tryptophan fluorescence (19Moser C. Kim O. Goody R.S. Sinning I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11339-11344Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). No significant differences in the dissociation constants of the mutants were detected, although with both GDP and GTP, the change in fluorescence intensity of the single tryptophan 343 is somewhat smaller in NG+1, compared with NG. In the presence of SRP, GTP hydrolysis is almost identical for both NG and NG+1 (Fig. 1E). Therefore, nucleotide binding and hydrolysis by NG and NG+1 in vitro do not provide a satisfactory explanation for the observed differences in their functionality in vivo. Nucleotide-mediated Complex Formation (and Dissociation) of NG or NG+1 with SRP—Previous biochemical studies of FtsY have established the importance of its functional association with SRP in a guanosine nucleotide-dependent manner and its ability to hydrolyze GTP (21Miller J.D. Kim H.D. Walter P. Nature. 1994; 367: 657-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 22Kusters R. Kim G. Eppens E. van Geel A. van der Weijden C.C. Wintermeyer W. Luirink J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Recent x-ray structures show a tight complex between the NG domains of FtsY and SRP54 (Ffh) from Thermus aquaticus and Sulfolobus solfataricus with bound nucleotides (23Egea P.F. Kim S.O. Napetschnig J. Savage D.F. Walter P. Stroud R.M. Nature. 2004; 427: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 24Focia P.J. Kim I.V. Seidler J.A. Freymann D.M. Science. 2004; 303: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). 5G. Bange and I. Sinning, unpublished data. To search for possible functional differences between the truncated FtsY mutants, we characterized the interaction of NG and NG+1 with SRP. Both NG-His6 and NG+1-His6 were purified and tested for their ability to bind SRP in extracts prepared from cells overexpressing SRP (both Ffh and 4.5 S RNA). In these cells, the amount of SRP is ∼50-fold higher than that in wild-type cells, and more than 70% of the SRP is found in the soluble fractions (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2A, NG and NG+1 bind SRP to a similar extent in a GMP-PNP-dependent manner. In both cases much less complex is formed in the absence of GMP-PNP, presumably because the SRP-containing extracts also contain small amounts of nucleotides. To analyze the GMP-PNP-dependent interaction quantitatively, we assayed equilibrium binding by using a fixed amount of SRP-containing ultracentrifuged cell extract (devoid of membranes and ribosomes) and increasing concentrations of purified NG or NG+1 (Fig. 2B). The results indicate specific binding that reaches saturation at about the same concentration for NG or NG+1, with an estimated Kd for both mutants in the range of ∼0.22-0.25 μm. This Kd value is in good agreement with the value obtained for full-length FtsY (25Jagath J.R. Kim M.V. Wintermeyer W. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, efficient association of NG or NG+1 with SRP requires the slow hydrolyzable GTP analog. Previously, it was demonstrated that GTP hydrolysis drives the dissociation of SRP from its receptor (21Miller J.D. Kim H.D. Walter P. Nature. 1994; 367: 657-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 26Connolly T. Kim P.J. Gilmore R. Science. 1991; 252: 1171-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Also shown was that the SRP-FtsY complex dissociation occurs even in the absence of membranes and upon exchange of the stabilizing nonhydrolyzable guanosine nucleotide with GDP (27Shepotinovskaya I.V. Kim D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1597: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Here we tested whether NG and NG+1 behave similarly regarding their release from SRP in a GTP-dependent manner. Following the incubation of the purified NG-His6 or NG+1-His6 with SRP extracts in the presence of GMP-PNP, the complexes were immobilized by Ni-NTA beads. Next, the beads were washed and incubated with either GMP-PNP (Fig. 2C, lanes 1) or GTP (Fig. 2C, lanes 2). Finally, the beads were collected, and their elution samples were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies against Ffh. As shown, SRP is released from either NG or NG+1, in a GTP-dependent manner. In summary, these results indicate that the formation and dissociation of the SRP-SRP receptor complex in solution is preserved both with the active (NG+1) and the inactive (NG) mutants of FtsY. Interaction of NG and NG+1 with the Translocon—Previous studies suggested two sites of interaction between FtsY and the cytoplasmic membrane in E. coli lipids (14de Leeuw E. Kim D. Mol O. Sinning I. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Oudega B. Luirink J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 15de Leeuw E. Kim K. Moser C. Menestrina G. Demel R. de Kruijff B.

Chem. 2001; 276: 25982-25989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and the translocon (7Angelini S. Kim S. Koch H.G. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 476-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 8Angelini S. Kim D. Schiltz E. Koch H.G. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To test possible differences between NG and NG+1 in their association with the translocon, we performed co-precipitation experiments with solubilized membranes, utilizing equal amounts of overexpressed His6-tagged NG and NG+1 and Ni-NTA resin. As shown in Fig. 3, both NG and NG+1 co-precipitate SecY. Surprisingly, however, in addition to SecY, Ffh was also precipitated by NG or NG+1, despite our prediction and previous studies (8Angelini S. Kim D. Schiltz E. Koch H.G. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Notable, NG co-precipitated substantially more Ffh than NG+1, suggesting that Ffh might get stuck on the NG membranes together with NG and/or the translocon (see below). Cellular Distribution of NG and NG+1—Because mutant NG does not support growth in the FtsY complementation assay (17Eitan A. Kim E. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2492-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 7), despite the fact that its apparent interactions with nucleotides, SRP, and the translocon were not impaired, another function of FtsY must be compromised in this mutant. Previously, it was shown that FtsY distributes between the cytosolic and membrane fractions of disrupted cells (10Luirink J. Kim C.M. van der Weijden C.C. Oudega B. High S. Dobberstein B. Kusters R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2289-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Although at steady state most of the FtsY molecules are cytosolic, an appreciable amount of a membrane-bound form cannot be released from the membrane even by elevated ionic strength, alkaline pH, or chaotropic agents (10Luirink J. Kim C.M. van der Weijden C.C. Oudega B. High S. Dobberstein B. Kusters R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2289-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), suggesting that a strong interaction with the membrane takes place in vivo. To address the possibility that the inactive mutant NG might be defective in its ability to interact with the membrane in vivo, we examined the cellular distribution of both mutants. Wild-type E. coli cells transformed with plasmids encoding IPTG-inducible versions of either NG+1 or NG were induced at the mid-log phase. As shown in Fig. 4A, the growth of NG cells was arrested, possibly because of a dominant negative effect of overexpressed NG. 6E. Malul and E. Bibi, unpublished observations. The cells were harvested after 5.5 h, and then membranes were purified by floatation in a stepwise density gradient and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-FtsY antibodies. Surprisingly, an unanticipated behavior for NG was observed (Fig. 4B). Instead of an impaired membrane association as predicted, the results revealed that the inactive NG mutant accumulates on the membrane in contrast to NG+1, of which only a small fraction co-purifies with membranes (see also Ref. 17Eitan A. Kim E. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2492-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).FIGURE 4Cellular distribution of NG mutants and ribosomes. Cells expressing NG-His6 or NG+1-His6 were grown in LB broth to 0.05 A600. Then 0.2 mm IPTG was added for induction of the NG mutants. A, growth was monitored by measuring the optical density of the cultures every 1 h after induction with IPTG. The cultures were harvested 4 h after induction, and the cells were fractionated. The membrane fractions were purified by floatation. Cytosolic and membrane fractions, equivalent to total extract samples containing equal amount of NG/NG+1, were analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies against FtsY (B) and the ribosomal proteins L-15 and S-13 (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previously, a linkage was identified between the amount of membrane-bound FtsY and ribosomes under various experimental conditions (3Herskovits A.A. Kim E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4621-4626Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 6Herskovits A.A. Kim E. Minsky A. Bibi E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), suggesting that FtsY plays a direct role in ribosome targeting and docking. Therefore, we tested whether NG retains these essential functions of the receptor. This was done by subjecting membranes purified from cells expressing NG+1 or NG to Western blotting with antibodies against proteins of the large and small ribosomal subunits. Fig. 4C shows that remarkably, ribosomes also accumulated on NG membranes, compared with NG+1 membranes, suggesting that the function of NG during the early stages of the pathway (ribosome targeting and docking) is not defective, whereas its function at a later step is compromised. Does the accumulation of NG on the membrane reflect nonrelevant membrane aggregation of this toxic protein in arrested cells? Although this is unlikely because ribosomes also accumulate on membranes of NG-expressing cells, we examined further the cellular distribution of NG, ribosomes, and also Ffh, at various times after induction of expression of NG or NG+1 (Fig. 5). The results show that in NG cells, both NG and ribosomes accumulate, and their membrane-bound amount increases with time. Interestingly, under the same conditions, the results show that although the amount of Ffh in NG+1 membranes decreases during growth, it remains relatively constant in NG membranes (Fig. 5, bottom panel; see also Fig. 3). These results suggest that whereas SRP releases membrane-associated ribosome-NG+1 complexes efficiently, it is unable to release NG-associated ribosomes. These observations raise the possibility that NG behaves differently in solution (Figs. 1 and 2) than on the membrane, regarding its functional interaction with SRP. A possible explanation could be that the GTPase-mediated dissociation of the NG-SRP complex, compared with that of NG+1-SRP, is less efficient on the membrane than in solution. Effect of Overexpressed SRP on the Cellular Distribution and Biological Function of NG—The experiments described above utilized wild-type E. coli cells overexpressing NG. The amount of the natively expressed SRP (Ffh and 4.5 S RNA) in these cells is significantly lower than that of overexpressed NG. Assuming that the efficiency of dissociation of the membrane-bound NG-SRP complex is lower than that of NG+1-SRP, we reasoned that overexpressing SRP might affect the equilibrium toward more dissociation in vivo. To test this possibility and the apparent effect of SRP on the cellular distribution of NG and ribosomes, we grew cells simultaneously overexpressing both NG and SRP. As shown in Fig. 6A, overexpression of SRP clearly improves the growth of NG-expressing cells in a reproducible manner. The membranes purified from these cells were analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 6B), and the results show that overexpression of SRP indeed reduces the amount of membrane-associated NG and ribosomes. This observation led to the suggestion that high SRP concentrations might also restore the function of NG in vivo, and this was examined by FtsY complementation assays. To this end, FtsY depletion cells were transformed with plasmid(s) encoding NG alone or NG together with SRP (Ffh and 4.5 S RNA). The transformants were grown in LB broth (Fig. 7A) or plated on LB agar plates (Fig. 7B) with or without arabinose (the inducer of chromosomal FtsY) and IPTG (for induction of NG). The expression of FtsY, NG, and Ffh in these cells is shown in Fig. 7C. Results of this assay indicate that although NG alone is unable to complement FtsY depletion, co-expression of SRP had a marked positive effect on the growth, both in liquid and solid media. Effect of Lipids on the GTPase Activity of NG and NG+1—What is the reason for the proposed inefficient dissociation of the membrane-bound NG-SRP complex? To address this critical issue, we tested the effect of lipids on the enzymological properties of various mutants, because FtsY-SRP dissociation requires GTP hydrolysis. It has been previously shown that phospholipids stimulate the GTPase activity of full-length FtsY, but not NG (15de Leeuw E. Kim K. Moser C. Menestrina G. Demel R. de Kruijff B. Oudega B. Luirink J. Sinning I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 531-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Here we repeated these experiments utilizing SRP together with either NG, NG+1, or FtsY, in the presence of liposomes containing E. coli-mimicked phospholipid mixture (70% phosphatidylethanolamine and 30% phosphatidylglycerol). The results show that the GTPase activity of NG-SRP is not stimulated by phospholipids, whereas NG+1- and FtsY-SRP are stimulated (Fig. 8), suggesting that indeed, the interaction of NG with SRP on the membrane differs from that observed in solution (Fig. 1E), possibly because of its impaired capacity to respond to lipids. Previous studies of the overall domain structure of FtsY and the functional importance of its subdomains have suggested that both the A- and N-domains play a role in membrane association of the receptor (14de Leeuw E. Kim D. Mol O. Sinning I. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Oudega B. Luirink J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 15de Leeuw E. Kim K. Moser C. Menestrina G.

Chem. 1999; 274: 33227-33234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This interaction is dominated by electrostatic forces and requires acidic phospholipids (15de Leeuw E. Kim K. Moser C. Menestrina G. Demel R. de Kruijff B. Oudega B. Luirink J. Sinning I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 531-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Later, our studies revealed that the A-domain (residues 1-195) is dispensable in vivo, raising the possibility that essential contact with the membrane is mainly dictated by the N-domain. This notion is supported by the observation that shortening the N-domain of the functional mutant (NG+1) by one N-terminal residue (NG) abolished the in vivo activity of the receptor (17Eitan A. Kim E. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2492-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The proposal that FtsY is peripherally associated with membranes was first raised by Luirink et al., (10Luirink J. Kim C.M. van der Weijden C.C. Oudega B. High S. Dobberstein B. Kusters R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2289-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), who noted that at steady state, FtsY is distributed between the cytoplasm and the membrane. However, FtsY has no known membrane anchor partner homologous to the mammalian β-subunit of the SRP receptor. Nevertheless, further studies supported the original suggestion that FtsY functions as a membrane-bound receptor (11Zelazny A. Kim A. Cooper A. Bibi E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6025-6029Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 12Bibi E. Kim A.A. Bochkareva E.S. Zelazny A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 15-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism by which FtsY associates with the membrane is yet not fully understood. Previous studies showed that membrane attachment of FtsY, like that of SecA (29Lill R. Kim W. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 60: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 30Hendrick J.P. Kim W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24596-24600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), involves lipids (15de Leeuw E. Kim K. Moser C. Menestrina G. Demel R. de Kruijff B. Oudega B. Luirink J. Sinning I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 531-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and proteins (8Angelini S. Kim D. Schiltz E. Koch H.G. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Strong support for functional interaction of FtsY with lipids, preferentially acidic ones, was obtained by in vitro studies, which demonstrated marked stimulation of the FtsY GTPase activity by lipids (15de Leeuw E. Kim K. Moser C. Menestrina G. Demel R. de Kruijff B. Oudega B. Luirink J. Sinning I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 531-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been shown that a postulated FtsY membrane assembly domain binds to E. coli inner membrane inverted vesicles via an interaction with a trypsin-sensitive component (28Millman J.S.

EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 476-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 8Angelini S. Kim D. Schiltz E. Koch H.G. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Based on these and additional data, a model was proposed that FtsY binding to the membrane occurs initially through phospholipid binding, followed by targeting to translocation sites via an interaction with an unknown membrane protein. However, our present studies suggest that interaction with lipids is required only at a late stage in the pathway and not for membrane targeting and docking of the receptor. To gain functionally related mechanistic insight into the various interactions of FtsY, we investigated the functional differences between active NG+1 and inactive NG, and the results enabled us to identify distinct and separable functions of the receptor in (i) targeting of ribosomes to the membrane and (ii) release of the ribosomes. Whereas NG retains the receptor role in the ribosome-targeting step, it is unable to function during the release of ribosomes from their docking site, possibly because of its defective functional response to membrane lipids. These conclusions are supported mainly by the following observations: (i) The inactive mutant NG accumulates on the cytoplasmic membrane, together with ribosomes and SRP, indicating proper targeting function. (ii) However, the accumulation per se indicates that the release of these complexes from the membrane is defective. (iii) The GTPase activity of the lipid-associated SRP-NG complex is substantially lower than that measured for NG+1 or FtsY. These results also indicate that deletion of one amino acid from the N terminus of NG+1 damages the lipid responsive domain of the receptor. 7Parlitz, R., Eitan, A., Stjepanovic, G. Bahari, L., Bange, G., Bibi, E., and Sinning, I. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282, 32176-32184. As discussed previously (31Gariani T. Kim T. Sauer-Eriksson A.E. J. Struct. Biol. 2006; 153: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the N-terminal peptide of the FtsY N-domain protrudes into a conserved hydrophobic interface (32Montoya G. Kim K. Moll R. Schafer G. Sinning I. Structure. 2000; 8: 515-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) between the N- and G-domains. In addition, an intimate linkage has been identified between this peptide and the C-terminal helix in FtsY of different organisms, also recently including NG+1 from E. coli.7 As such, in addition to sensing lipids, this peptide might be able to transmit lipid-mediated structural information to the active site of FtsY (probably via motif IV of the G-domain). Although it has not yet been fully elucidated whether the receptor must associate with lipids for its physical attachment to the E. coli cytoplasmic membrane, our results strongly suggest that regulation of FtsY GTPase activity by lipids is essential for proper function only at a later step of the pathway. A possible scenario would be that the receptor associates with a membrane protein (the translocon or another receptor; see Refs 33Cristobal S. Kim P. Luirink J. von Heijne G. de Gier J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20068-20070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar and 34Facey S.J. Kim S.A. Krauss S. Kuhn A. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 365: 995-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and in addition, it has a membrane-responsive domain that is not essential for membrane attachment of the receptor. This domain would then be responsible for transferring lipid-mediated regulatory information to the receptor active site. Why would that be important for the receptor’s function? We favor the possibility that there is a mechanism that delays the dissociation of the SRP-FtsY complex and transfer of the associated ribosomes to the translocon, until a free translocon is ready to accept the nascent chain. In vivo, one such scenario would be that prior to its association with the free translocon, the receptor is kept nonresponsive to lipids. This repressed form of the receptor can be activated and converted into a lipid-responsive form only upon interaction with the free translocon and release of the hydrophobic nascent chain from SRP. Although speculative, we propose that lipid receptor interaction in E. coli might fulfill a task conceptually analogous to that proposed for the mammalian β-subunit of the SRP receptor of the SRP receptor (35Fulga T.A. Kim I. Dobberstein B. Pool M.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2338-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) in regulating the last step of targeting, by utilizing an entirely different mechanism. Currently, this hypothesis is being evaluated by in vivo and in vitro studies. No external GTPase-activating proteins have so far been identified for FtsY or Ffh, although such regulation is probably needed to prevent premature SRP cycles during the biogenesis of membrane proteins. Recently, an interesting mechanism was proposed for constitutive Ffh activation by the 4.5 S RNA tetraloop (36Siu F.Y. Kim R.J. Doudna J.A. RNA (N. Y.). 2007; 13: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It was suggested that activation of Ffh by the RNA is suppressed by hydrophobic nascent chains but only when SRP associates with ribosomes translating SRP substrates. Similarly, our studies raise the interesting possibility that lipids provide a functionally relevant GTPase-activating mechanism for FtsY, which regulates a later step in the pathway. Interestingly, although certain 4.5 S RNA mutants (in the tetraloop) were found inactive in in vivo complementation studies (36Siu F.Y. Kim R.J. Doudna J.A. RNA (N. Y.). 2007; 13: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), different results were obtained by Jagath et al. (37Jagath J.R. Kim N.B. de Leeuw E. Warnecke J.M. Lentzen G. Rodnina M.V. Luirink J. Wintermeyer W. RNA. 2001; 7: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Siu et al. (36Siu F.Y. Kim R.J. Doudna J.A. RNA (N. Y.). 2007; 13: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) suggest that this apparent contradiction could be resolved because different expression levels of the mutants were utilized in the two studies and that activation of Ffh by these mutants was only decreased and could be compensated for by higher amounts of the RNA. A similar scenario was observed in our studies, where overexpression of SRP partially restored the ability of NG to complement FtsY depletion in vivo. These results suggest that the expression level of components of the SRP machinery might be tightly controlled in vivo to assure proper regulation of the SRP-related GTPases Ffh and FtsY during different stages of the targeting pathway.

Here, we demonstrate the presence of vacuole-associated actin polymerization activity, and its dependence on Cdc42p and Vrp1p. Using a sensitive in vitro pyrene-actin polymerization assay, we found that vacuole membranes stimulated polymerization, and this activity increased when vacuoles were preincubated under conditions that support membrane fusion. Vacuoles purified from a VRP1-gene deletion strain showed reduced polymerization activity, which could be recovered when reconstituted with excess Vrp1p. Cdc42p regulates this activity because overexpression of dominant-negative Cdc42p significantly reduced vacuole-associated polymerization activity, while dominant-active Cdc42p increased activity. We also used size-exclusion chromatography to directly examine changes in yeast actin induced by vacuole fusion. This assay confirmed that actin undergoes polymerization in a process requiring ATP. To further confirm the need for actin polymerization during vacuole fusion, an actin polymerization-deficient mutant strain was examined. This strain showed in vivo defects in vacuole fusion, and actin purified from this strain inhibited in vitro vacuole fusion. Affinity isolation of vacuole-associated actin and in vitro binding assays revealed a polymerization-dependent interaction between actin and the SNARE Ykt6p.

The cytoskeleton plays an important role in regulating many cellular processes including cell division, motility, polarization, endocytosis, and exocytosis (1Moseley J.B. Goode B.L. Microbiol. Mol.

Two general classification of actin regulatory functions have been established; those that depend on stable actin filaments, such as polarized organelle transport (5Hill K.L. Catlett N.L.

Cell. 2003; 112: 453-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3231) Google Scholar). There is a growing body of evidence that supports the need for dynamic actin monomerpolymer transitions during exocytosis and membrane fusion (8Malacombe M. Bader M.F. Gasman S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 1175-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 9Yu H.-Y.E. Bement W.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Traditionally, cortical actin has been viewed as a barrier structure that would only require disassembly to allow membrane contact prior to exocytosis (10Orci L. Gabbay K.H. Malaisee W.J. Science. 1972; 175: 1128-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 11Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Exp. Biol. 1988; 139: 253-266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Trifaro J.M. Vitale M.L. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 466-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This would seemingly be the case for neurotransmitter release at the synapse, where actin remodeling is controlled by scinderin, which severs actin in a calcium-dependent manner to promote exocytosis (13Zhang L. Marcu M.G. Nau-Staudt K. Trifaro J.M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Interestingly, scinderin is also reported to negatively regulate exocytosis via actin nucleating activity (14Marcu M.G. Zhang L. Elzagallaai A. Trifaro J.M. J. Biol.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 649-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). We have shown that membrane fusion is inhibited by antibodies to Las17p (yeast WASp ortholog) (16Eitzen G. Wang L. Thorngren N. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 669-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) or deletion of VRP1 (yeast WIP ortholog) (27Tedrick K. Trischuk T. Lehner R. Eitzen G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4609-4621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using an established in vitro assay of vacuole membrane fusion (28Wickner W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Cdc42p is located on the vacuole membrane and is needed for homotypic vacuole fusion (29Eitzen G. Thorngren N. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5650-5656Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 30Muller O. Johnson D.I. Mayer A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5657-5665Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), which suggests that actin polymerization may be a subreaction of the fusion mechanism. Indeed, both of the actin ligands jasplakinolide and latrunculin, which stabilize and destabilize F-actin, respectively, inhibit vacuole fusion implicating the need for cycles of actin polymerization and depolymerization. However, final membrane bilayer mixing is only inhibited by F-actin destabilization via latrunculin, suggesting actin polymerization is the final process needed (16Eitzen G. Wang L. Thorngren N. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 669-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar).Here, we used two assays to demonstrate that purified vacuole membranes stimulate actin polymerization in vitro. We used a pyrene-actin polymerization assay to show that vacuole membranes stimulate actin polymerization via a Cdc42p-dependent signaling mechanism. We used an actin-sizing assay to show that F-actin is formed during incubations of vacuoles in conditions that support in vitro membrane fusion. We also show that polymerization-deficient actin is an inhibitor of vacuole fusion, and F-actin directly interacts with SNAREs that have longin domains. Our results suggest that membrane-stimulated actin polymerization is a subreaction of the membrane fusion mechanism.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains and Sample Preparation—Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Rho overexpression strains were prepared using Drop&Drag cloning (31Jansen G. Wu C. Schade B. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. Gene (Amst.). 2004; 344: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) as described under supplemental data. Strains were grown at 28 °C in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose), or YPDGk (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 1% dextrose, 1% galactose, 30 μg/ml kanamycin) when growing Rho overexpression strains. Cytosol was prepared from strain K91-1A grown to ∼4 A600, by vortexing cells for 10 min at 4 °C with glass beads using a ratio of 1 vol of glass beads to 2 vol of cells, resuspended at 1/100th the original culture volume in lysis buffer (20 mm PIPES-KOH, pH 6.8, 200 mm sorbitol, 1 mm Mg-ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2× PIC). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Typical cytosol protein concentrations were 20 mg/ml. Actin was purified from cytosol by DNaseI affinity chromatography followed by DEAE ion exchange chromatography as previously described (32Rutkevich L.A. Teal D.J. Dawson J.F. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2006; 84: 111-119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Actin was concentrated to ∼4 mg/ml using a Centricon-10 (Millipore).TABLE 1Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceK91-1AMatA, pho8::AL134, pho13::pPH13, his3, ura3, lys233BJ2168Matα, pep4-3, prb1-1122, prc1-407, leu2, ura333KTY1Matα, pep4::kanMX, prb1::LEU2, his3, leu2, ura3, lys227KTY2Matα, pho8::kanMX, his3, leu2, ura3, lys227KTY5Matα, vrp1::kanMX, pep4::URA3, prb1::LEU2, his3, leu2, ura3, lys227DBY6945Matα, his3, leu2, ura3, tub2, act1::LEU2, pRB668(URA3)::ACT132JDY318Matα, his3, leu2, ura3, tub2, act1::LEU2, pJD318(URA3)::act1-A204C/C374A32LJYC42wtMatα, pep4-3, prb1-1122, prc1-407, leu2, ura3, pGREG535:CDC42This studyLJYC42GMatα, pep4-3, prb1-1122, prc1-407, leu2, ura3, pGREG535:CDC42-G12VThis studyLJYC42TMatα, pep4-3, prb1-1122, prc1-407, leu2, ura3, pGREG535:CDC42-T17NThis studyLJYR1wtMatα, pep4-3, prb1-1122, prc1-407, leu2, ura3, pGREG535:RHO1This studyLJYR1GMatα, pep4-3, prb1-1122, prc1-407, leu2, ura3, pGREG535:RHO1-G19VThis studyLJYR1TMatα, pep4-3, prb1-1122, prc1-407, leu2, ura3, pGREG535:RHO1-T24NThis study Open table in a new tab Biochemical Reagents—Reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise indicated; the actin binding drugs jasplakinolide (Invitrogen) and latrunculin B (Biomol) were dissolved in Me2SO at 1 mm; phalloidin was dissolved in methanol and U73122 and U73343 were dissolved in ethanol at 10 mm; apyrase VII was dissolved in PS-buffer (20 mm PIPES-KOH, pH 6.8, 200 mm sorbitol) at 1 unit/μl. Vrp1p, Rdi1p, and Gdi1p were prepared and used as previously described (27Tedrick K. Trischuk T. Lehner R. Eitzen G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4609-4621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Eitzen G. Thorngren N. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5650-5656Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Antibodies against Cdc42p, Rho1p, and Vrp1p were purified as IgG fractions from rabbit sera as previously described (16Eitzen G. Wang L. Thorngren N. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 669-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 29Eitzen G. Thorngren N. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5650-5656Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). 1× ATPreg (ATP-regenerating system) was made as a 10× stock solution in PS-buffer (10× ATPreg = 5 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 200 mm creatine phosphate, 2 mg/ml creatine kinase). Protease inhibitor mixture (PIC) was made as a 60× stock solution (60× PIC = 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml pepstatin, 25 mm o-phenanthroline, 5 mm Pefabloc SC).Vacuole Isolation, Fusion, and Pretreatment Reactions—Vacuoles were isolated from yeast by floatation on Ficoll gradients as previously described (33Haas A. Methods Cell Sci. 1995; 17: 283-294Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Vacuole fusion was assayed essentially as previously described (33Haas A. Methods Cell Sci. 1995; 17: 283-294Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, fusion reactions (30 μl) contained 3.5 μg of vacuoles from each of KTY1 (pro-ALP fusion reporter) and KTY2 (protease donor to cleave pro-ALP upon fusion) in fusion reaction buffer (F.R.B. = 20 mm PIPES-KOH, pH 6.8, 125 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 200 mm sorbitol, 10 μm CoA, 1× PIC), 1× ATPreg, and 0.5 mg/ml cytosol. To assay the stimulation of actin polymerization, vacuoles were preincubated at 30 °C in buffers normally used for in vitro vacuole fusion. Reactions contained 0.3 mg/ml of vacuoles in F.R.B. + 1× ATPreg; 0.5 mg/ml of cytosol was included where indicated. Vacuoles were re-isolated (centrifugation at 18,000 × g, 4 °C, 5 min) from preincubation reactions after 2-fold dilution in cold PS-buffer and then added to polymerization assays.Pyrene-actin Polymerization Assay—To assay actin polymerization activity we used an established pyrene-actin polymerization assay (34Cooper J.A. Pollard T.D. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 182-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Briefly, 70 μl of a sample dissolved in G-buf/NP/Mg (5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.17% Nonidet P-40, 0.35 mm MgCl2) was mixed with 50 μl of 6–12 μm actin polymerization stock mixture containing 35% pyrenelabeled actin in G-buffer (5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP) (Cytoskeleton Inc.). Actin polymerization buffer (10× A.P.B. = 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 500 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ATP) was added to some reactions, which initiates spontaneous polymerization because of a lowering of the critical concentration for polymerization (34Cooper J.A. Pollard T.D. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 182-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensity readings were taken every 18 s using a QM-4SE spectrofluorimeter (Ex360/Em407, 10-nm bandwidth, 2-s integration), with a four position heated sample holder set to 30 °C (Photon Technologies Inc.). Baseline fluorescence of the pyrene-actin stock mixture was taken for ∼5 min, test samples were then added, and measurements continued for 1 h. Actin polymerization activity (A.P.A) was calculated from polymerization curves by determining the average rate of fluorescence intensity increase for 3000 s of reaction time (i.e. after sample addition, multiple slopes were calculated over the course of a reaction and averaged), divided by the micrograms of test sample protein (ΔFI/μg).Actin Sizing Assay—To examine the dynamics of yeast actin assembly on intact vacuoles, reactions devoid of cytosol, but containing 0.1 μm purified yeast actin were analyzed for changes in the size of actin complexes by size-exclusion chromatography. For this assay 150-μl reactions containing 0.3 mg/ml vacuoles in F.R.B. + ATPreg were incubated at 30 °C for the specified times and conditions. Reactions were stopped by transferring to ice and addition of 15 μl of 10× F-actin stabilization buffer (1 mm phalloidin, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, and 5% Triton X-100). Membranes were dissolved by gentle mixing and incubation on ice for 15 min. 150 μl of the sample was applied to a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (GE Healthcare) run at 0.5 ml/min in GF-running buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100). 0.5-ml fractions were collected, and the elution profile of actin was analyzed by immunoblotting of equal fractions.Immunoprecipitation of Actin-Vacuole Protein Complexes and Direct Binding Assays—150-μl reactions containing 0.3 mg/ml vacuoles in F.R.B. + ATPreg plus cytosol were incubated for the indicated times and conditions. Membranes were then washed by 2-fold dilution in PS-buffer, re-isolated by centrifugation, and dissolved in 400 μl of A-buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 80 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm ATP, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1.25% (wt/v) β-octylglucoside, 2× PIC). Actin-associated complexes were immunoprecipitated by addition of 100 μl of anti-actin antibodies cross-linked to protein A-agarose (20% slurry in A-buffer). Nonspecific binding was determined in parallel using preimmune serum cross-linked beads. Binding reactions were incubated for 2 h at 4°C with nutation. Beads were then washed three times in A-buffer, eluted with 500 μl of 100 mm glycine-HCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 2.5, followed by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and immunoblot analysis. Production of GST and MBP-tagged proteins was performed as previously described (36Thorngren N. Collins K.M. Fratti R.A. Wickner W. Merz A.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2765-2776Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Direct binding of F-actin and SNAREs was examined by incubating 10 μm of immobilized GST-Vam3p, GST-Vam7p, GST-Vti1p, GST-Nyv1p, GST, or 10 μm MBP-Ykt6p or MBP with 30 μm yeast G-actin in 1× A.P.B, 0.2% Nonidet P-40 for 1 h at 4°C, or at 27°C to allow for actin polymerization. Actin and SNARE interactions were determined by immunoblotting for actin after washing beads in HS-buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40).Microscopy and in Vivo Analyses—Vacuoles were stained with FM4-64 (27Tedrick K. Trischuk T. Lehner R. Eitzen G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4609-4621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and vacuole morphology was either observed while cells were still growing in YPD media (A600 ∼ 1) or after incubation for 1 min in hypotonic conditions (1:5 dilution in water). This hypotonic shock has previously been shown to induce vacuole fusion in vivo (37Wang Y.X. Kauffman E.J. Duex J.E. Weisman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35133-35140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Images were acquired using a Axioskop2 with a 100×/1.4 NA plan apochromat oil immersion len (Zeiss), a CoolSnap HQ camera (Photometrics) and ImagePro Plus software (Media Cybernetics).RESULTSWe have recently shown that actin ligands, which block either F-actin assembly or disassembly, inhibit vacuole membrane fusion (16Eitzen G. Wang L. Thorngren N. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 669-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). These results suggested that both actin depolymerization and repolymerization (i.e. actin remodeling) was needed for membrane fusion. However, this does not agree with the traditional view that actin is a barrier requiring only depolymerization. Our approach here was to directly examine vacuole-associated actin polymerization activity. To determine the capacity of a sample to stimulate actin polymerization we first used pyrene-labeled actin, which undergoes a fluorescence intensity increase when incorporated into F-actin (33Haas A. Methods Cell Sci. 1995; 17: 283-294Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). As expected, yeast cytosol, which stimulates vacuole membrane fusion (16Eitzen G. Wang L. Thorngren N. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 669-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 27Tedrick K. Trischuk T. Lehner R. Eitzen G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4609-4621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), also stimulated the polymerization of pyrene-actin, and actin ligands enhanced or blocked this activity depending on their known specificity (Fig. 1A). From pyrene-actin polymerization curves we calculated A.P.A. as the average rate of fluorescence intensity change per microgram of test sample (Fig. 1C).Vacuole-associated Actin Polymerization Activity—We next tested whether purified vacuoles stimulate actin polymerization. Detergent-solubilized vacuoles purified from wild-type yeast showed significant stimulation of pyrene-actin polymerization, whereas vacuoles purified from a VRP1 gene deletion strain were devoid of this activity (Fig. 1B). Addition of actin polymerization buffer (A.P.B.) increased activity in both samples (Fig. 1B, arrow A.P.B.), therefore, both reactions had the equivalent capacity to polymerize actin. Preincubation of vacuoles with semi-purified Vrp1p enhanced the A.P.A. of wild-type vacuoles and recovered the A.P.A. of vrp1Δ vacuoles (Fig. 1D). Vrp1p is the yeast WIP ortholog (38Vaduva G. Martinez-Quiles N. Anton I.M. Martin N.C. Geha R.S. Hopper A.K. Ramesh N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17103-17108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), which together with WASp catalyzes the nucleation of actin polymerization via the Arp2/3 complex (26Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 649-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that vacuoles isolated from the vrp1Δ strain do not undergo membrane fusion in vitro (27Tedrick K. Trischuk T. Lehner R. Eitzen G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4609-4621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and our results here suggest this may be because of the lack of actin polymerization activity.We next performed a vacuole titration to determine the optimal concentration needed to stimulate actin polymerization. We found that polymerization increased with increasing vacuole concentration with peak specific activity obtained at vacuole concentrations of 0.33 mg/ml (Fig. 2, A and C). The titration was repeated with vacuoles that were preincubated for 30 min in a reaction buffer typically used for in vitro membrane fusion (33Haas A. Methods Cell Sci. 1995; 17: 283-294Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This showed a similar optimal concentration; however, A.P.A. values were significantly increased compared with unincubated vacuoles (Fig. 2, B and C). Pyrene-actin was also titrated which showed optimal actin concentration were ∼5 μm for our assay conditions (Fig. 2D).FIGURE 2Titration of vacuole-associated actin polymerization activity. Wild-type vacuoles (BJ2168) were pre-incubated in fusion reaction buffer (F.R.B.) + 1× ATPreg, and 0.5 mg/ml cytosol for 0 min (A)or 30 min (B), washed in PS-buffer, reisolated and titrated into polymerization reactions containing 3.5μm pyrene-actin. C, actin polymerization activities (A.P.A.) from titration curves shown in A and B. D, actin polymerization activities from pyrene-actin titrations containing 0.33 mg/ml vacuoles preincubated as in A and B. Polymerization curves for actin titration are shown in supplemental data (supplemental Fig. S1, C and D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because optimization experiments revealed that preincubation of vacuoles increased polymerization activity (Fig. 2, C and D, compare 0 min bars to 30 min bars), we further tested the effect of vacuole preincubation on their capacity to stimulate actin polymerization. Vacuoles were incubated for 0–80 min in F.R.B., reisolated and assayed for stimulation of actin polymerization. Initially, activity levels decreased; however, after 40 min of incubation, activity levels rose 1.6-fold higher than unincubated samples (Fig. 3A, –cytosol). Including cytosol in preincubations stimulated a 2.4-fold increase in activity, which was also more rapid with maximal activity levels obtained after only 20 min of preincubation (Fig. 3, +cytosol). These data suggest that purified vacuoles contain residual actin polymerization activity upon isolation, which is initially reduced during preincubation while longer incubations can regenerate activity. We tested this hypothesis by incubating vacuoles in the absence of reaction buffer, and these did not recover activity (Fig. 3, –rxn buffer). Hence, residual activity was “run-down” in the absence of an adequate reaction buffer. We also tested membrane fusion for these conditions and times (Fig. 3B). Although A.P.A. levels did not temporally coincide with membrane fusion levels, reactions condition that enhanced (+cytosol) or reduced (–rxn buffer) membrane fusion had similar effects on A.P.A. levels.FIGURE 3Kinetics of vacuole-associated actin polymerization activity. A, actin polymerization activity was determined for wild-type vacuoles (BJ2168) that were preincubated for 0–80 min in either PS-buffer (black bars), F.R.B. + 1× ATPreg (gray bars) or F.R.B. + 1× ATPreg and 0.5 mg/ml cytosol (hatched bars). At the specified times vacuoles were washed in PS-buffer, reisolated and added to pyrene-actin polymerization mixtures. Polymerization reactions contained 5 μm pyrene-actin and 0.33 mg/ml vacuoles. Shown are average A.P.A. values (±S.E.) from at least three experiments normalized to unincubated samples. Typical polymerization curves and A.P.A values are shown in supplemental data (Fig. S2, A–D). B, vacuole fusion (see “Experimental Procedures”) for conditions corresponding to preincubation conditions as in A. Fusion (±S.E.) was calculated as a percentage of standard reactions incubated for 80 min from three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Endogenous Actin Remodeling—Intact vacuoles could not be directly assayed using the pyrene-actin assay because of light scattering during fluorescence measurements. Therefore, we developed an actin-sizing assay based on gel filtration chromatography, which would examine the remodeling of unlabeled yeast actin (rather than pyrene-actin) by intact vacuoles. For this assay, vacuoles were incubated in membrane fusion reaction buffer and, at specific times, membranes were solubilized and actin filaments stabilized by the addition of 10× F-buffer. Samples were then applied to a Superose 6 column for size-fractionated and the elution profile of actin was determined by immunoblot analysis. Large complexes representing F-actin eluted near the column void volume (fractions 13–15) well separated from monomeric actin (fractions 31–35) and what likely represents dimer/trimer nucleating actin fragments (fractions 27–30) (see Ref. 35Weber A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 190: 67-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cytosol was not included in these reactions to limit our examination specifically to vacuole-stimulated changes in F-actin. This analysis showed that actin was initially monomeric with small amounts of F-actin, however, incubation triggered the formation of F-actin (Fig. 4A). This agrees well with our previous results which showed that vacuoles were more active in stimulating pyrene-actin polymerization after 20–40 min of preincubation (Fig. 3). Similar experiments were performed with vacuoles purified from the VRP1 gene deletion strain, and these did not show significant F-actin formation (Fig. 4B, vrp1Δ). Reactions done in the presence of apyrase (i.e. the absence of ATP) showed reduced F-actin formation (Fig. 4B, –ATP). These result"

NPCs are supramolecular structures with an approximate molecular mass of 125 MDa and comprise 30–50 different proteins, with multiple copies of each (1Rout M.P. Kim J.D. Suprapto A. Hjertaas K.

Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). NPC models obtained by computational analyses of electron microscope data indicate the presence of a large central channel ∼45–50 nm in diameter (3Akey C.W. Kim M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 4Hinshaw J.E. Kim B.O. Milligan R.A.

Biol. 2003; 328: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). This is contradicted by the size exclusion limit for the passive diffusion of macromolecules being ∼9 nm (6Paine P.L. Kim L.C. Horowitz S.B. Nature. 1975; 254: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). In fact, electron micrographs and the resulting models often show a quite fuzzy structure blocking the central channel, generally termed the “transporter” or the “central plug” (7Reichelt R. Kim A. Buhle E.L. Jr. Jarnik M. Engel A. Aebi U. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 883-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 8Wang H. Kim D.E. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 241-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, during active transport, NPCs are capable of transporting substrates with diameters of up to 39 nm (9Pante N. Kim M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). This shows clearly that this central plug must be somewhat flexible. Recent studies in yeast show that ∼30% of the whole NPC mass consists of natively unfolded protein fibers (10Lim R.Y. Kim N.P. Koser J. Deng J. Lau K.H. Schwarz-Herion K. Fahrenkrog B. Aebi U. Proc.

A. 2003; 100: 2450-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). These protein domains comprise so-called phenylalanine- and glycine-rich repeats (FG repeats) that are hydrophobic and interact with each other (12Ribbeck K. Kim D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2664-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). One of the currently discussed models for active protein transport, the selective phase model (13Bednenko J. Kim G. Gerace L. Traffic. 2003; 4: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 14Fahrenkrog B. Kim J. Aebi U. Trends Biochem.

Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 328-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), states that the FG repeats form a gel-like meshwork inside the central channel. This meshwork can be interrupted by transport factors that appear to be the most hydrophobic soluble proteins, such as importin-β (12Ribbeck K. Kim D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2664-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). The size of the mesh has been estimated at ∼3 nm (18Bickel T. Kim R. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3079-3087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Whereas the active transport of proteins is known to occur through the central channel, the route for ions and small macromolecules is less clear. The first evidence for a spatial separation between active transport and passive diffusion appeared in the late 1980s. Finlay et al. (19Finlay D.R. Kim D.D. Price T.M. Forbes D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) and Yoneda et al. (20Yoneda Y. Kim N. Yamaizumi M. Uchida T. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 173: 586-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) independently found that binding of wheat germ agglutinin blocks the active transport of nucleoplasmin but has no influence on the passive diffusion of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled dextran molecules. The first computer model of the NPC by Hinshaw et al. in 1992 (4Hinshaw J.E. Kim B.O. Milligan R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 1133-1141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) led to speculation that ions and small macromolecules use small channels with a radius of ∼10 nm, located in the periphery of NPCs. Subsequent data provided further evidence for the existence of these peripheral channels (3Akey C.W. Kim M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 21Yang Q. Kim M.P. Akey C.W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 223-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), although their functionality remained unclear. The above observations show that the central channel is not an open gap, but rather is occupied by a meshwork formed by hydrophobic FG repeats that can only be opened by specific hydrophobic keys (transport factors). This gives new reason to suspect an additional permeability in the periphery of the pore because macromolecules up to 9 nm in diameter are able to diffuse freely through the NPC (6Paine P.L. Kim L.C. Horowitz S.B. Nature. 1975; 254: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). So far, only a few studies have favored the hypothesis of a separate route for ions and small macromolecules (4Hinshaw J.E. Kim B.O. Milligan R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 1133-1141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 22Danker T. Kim H. Storck J. Shahin V. Kramer B. Wilhelmi M. Oberleithner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1895-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) revealed that calcium depletion of the perinuclear space, which leads to inhibition of signal-promoted protein transport (25Greber U.F. Kim L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 26Santella L. Kim E. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1091-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), has a contrary promotional effect on ion conductivity. This study provides direct evidence for a pathway for ions and small solutes that is separate from the central channel. To achieve this, we combined three methods: (i) the nuclear hourglass technique (NHT) (22Danker T. Kim H. Storck J. Shahin V. Kramer B. Wilhelmi M. Oberleithner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13530-13535Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), which allows measurement of the electrical resistance of the nuclear envelope; (ii) atomic force microscopy (AFM), which allows topographic measurements of NPCs; and (iii) permeability assays with fluorescently labeled small dextran molecules, which provide information regarding the function of the nuclear envelope barrier. Preparation of Cell Nuclei—Xenopus laevis females were anesthetized with 0.1% ethyl m-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany), and their ovaries were removed. Oocytes were dissected from ovary clusters and stored in modified Ringer's solution (87 mm NaCl, 6.3 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 100 units/100 μg penicillin/streptomycin, pH 7.4) until used. For isolation of the cell nuclei, the oocytes were transferred into nuclear isolation medium (NIM) composed of 90 mm KCl, 26 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm MgCl2 (corresponding to a free Mg2+ concentration of 2 mm), 1.1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES and titrated to pH 7.4. We added 1.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone (Mr = 40,000; Sigma) to compensate for the lack of macromolecules in NIM, mimicking the intact cytosol. The presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone is crucial to prevent the swelling (>100% in the absence of polyvinylpyrrolidone) of total nuclear volume that occurs instantaneously after isolation in pure electrolyte solution. We used X. laevis oocytes because they provide the unique possibility to manually prepare the nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic faces of a nuclear envelope for AFM investigations. NHT—The technical aspects of this method and its application to isolated cell nuclei have been described previously in detail (22Danker T. Kim H. Storck J. Shahin V. Kramer B. Wilhelmi M. Oberleithner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13530-13535Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In brief, this method uses a tapered glass tube that narrows in the middle to two-thirds the diameter of the nucleus. A current of up to 1 mA is injected via two Ag/AgCl electrodes through either end of the glass tube. The voltage drops across the cell nucleus are measured with two conventional microelectrodes, the tips of which are placed near the narrow part of the capillary opposite each other so as to measure the electrical resistance of the fluid column between them. Because current and voltage are measured simultaneously, the resistance can be calculated on-line and monitored during the measurements. The nucleus is sucked into the narrow part of the capillary by gentle fluid movement (see Fig. 2A and supplemental Movie 1). Thus, the current flows through the nucleus. The resulting increase in total electrical resistance indicates the specific electrical resistance of the cell nucleus. In this study, a direct current of 15 μA was used to induce electrophoretic movement of FITC-labeled bovine serum albumin (BSA) molecules toward the nuclear envelope. FITC-BSA was either present from the beginning of the measurement or added subsequently using a stretched pipette tip. In both cases, the nucleus was kept for 5 min in the narrowed part of the capillary in the presence of 15 mg/ml FITC-BSA. At the same time, nuclear resistance was recorded as described above. The nuclear resistance after incubation with importin-β-(45–462) was measured using alternating square-wave current pulses of 15 μA. Preparation of Nuclear Envelopes—After the oocytes were placed in NIM, nuclei were isolated manually by piercing the oocyte with two pincers. Individual intact nuclei were picked up with a Pasteur pipette and transferred to a glass coverslip placed under a stereomicroscope. The chromatin was then carefully removed using sharp needles, and the nuclear envelope was spread on BD Biosciences Cell-Tak™-coated glass, with the nucleoplasmic side facing downwards or upwards. Finally, the specimens were washed with deionized water and dried. Fluorescence Detection of FITC-BSA at the Nuclear Envelope—The fluorescence of whole nuclei was measured in NIM in small Petri dishes using a Zeiss Axiovert 100 inverted microscope equipped with a cooled CCD camera and the imaging software MetaMorph (Visitron Systems GmbH, Puchheim, Germany). Fluorescence measurements of membrane preparations were performed with the same setup by placing the coverslips with the membranes onto a microscope slide that was mounted on a holder. AFM—The application of AFM to nuclear envelopes has been described in detail (27Danker T. Kim M. Tonini R. Rakowska A. Oberleithner H. Cell Biol. Int. 1997; 21: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We used a MultiMode™ atomic force microscope (with a NanoScope IIIa controller; Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA) equipped with an optical microscope, a video camera, and a monitor to visualize the nuclear envelope and the AFM tip on its stage. We used standard V-shaped 200-μm-long silicon nitride cantilevers with a spring constant of 0.06 newtons/m and pyramidal tips with an estimated tip diameter of 10 nm (Digital Instruments). The images were recorded with 512 lines per screen at constant force (height mode) in contact mode with a scan rate of 3–10 Hz. The forces applied during the scanning procedure were minimized by retracting the AFM tip until it lost contact with the sample surface and re-engaging the tip at a set point (i.e. force value) as close as possible to the lift-off value. The scanning forces were usually below 3 nanonewtons with this approach. Although the AFM tip physically interacts with the nuclear envelope, the repeatability of results from multiple scans indicated that the preparation was not damaged. Moreover, scanning at low forces (3 nanonewtons or less) left no visible marks in the preparation. Macromolecule Permeability Assays—X. laevis oocyte nuclei were isolated, incubated for the indicated times in NIM (controls) or in NIM containing 0.5 μm importin-β-(45–462) at room temperature, and washed for 5 min with NIM. Nuclei were then mounted onto a chamber on the stage of an Olympus CLSM FluoView confocal laser-scanning microscope and superfused with NIM containing 19.5-kDa FITC-dextran (Sigma). The light source of the confocal microscope was an argon/krypton ion laser (Omnichrome) with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm. Comparison of diffusion rates under different experimental conditions allows conclusions to be drawn about the passive NPC permeability (28Enss K. Kim T. Schlune A. Buchholz I. Oberleithner H. J.

Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2881-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). During the measurement procedure, the nucleus was placed into a superfusion chamber (volume of 10 μl), which, in combination with a perfusor, allowed permanent superfusion and fast changes in perfusion solutions. Cell-Tak™ was used to immobilize the cell nucleus. The diffusion of 19.5-kDa FITC-dextran across the nuclear envelope was measured and analyzed by confocal fluorescence microscopy as described previously (29Ludwig Y. Kim C. Kramer A. Albermann L. Oberleithner H. Shahin V. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2006; 17: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 30Shahin V. Kim Y. Schafer C. Nikova D. Oberleithner H. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2881-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Expression of Importin-β-(45–462)—The expression plasmid for importin-β-(45–462) was a kind gift from Prof. Dirk Görlich (Zentrum für Molekulare Biologie Heidelberg). Importin-β-(45–462) was expressed and purified as described previously (31Kutay U. Kim F.R. Kostka S. Kraft R. Görlich D. Cell. 1997; 90: 1061-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Briefly, the expression plasmid pQE60 (Qiagen Inc., Hilden, Germany), containing the coding sequence of human importin-β-(45–462) and an N-terminal His tag, was used to transform Escherichia coli BLR/Rep4. Expression was at 18 °C for 3 h. After centrifugation, the bacterial pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm imidazole, 200 mm NaCl, and 5 mm mercaptoethanol, and lysis was performed by sonication. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min and loaded onto a column containing nickel-agarose. The column was washed with the same buffer and eluded with 300 mm imidazole. The buffer was exchanged for 50 mm Tris-HCl and 250 mm sucrose. Electrophoretic Decoration of Ion-conductive Sites—We employed two approaches to test the hypothesis that two separate pathways exist. In the first approach, we attempted to visualize the entry site for ions through NPCs by combining the NHT with AFM. Fig. 1A illustrates this approach, in which an electric field applied across the nucleus drives charged impermeable macromolecules (albumin) toward the cytoplasmic face of NPCs. Albumin is too big to enter the nuclear interior through the ion-conductive sites of the nuclear envelope and thus gets stuck at the surface. The position of the albumin molecules at the pore surface indicates the position of the ion-conductive entry gates. We decided to use albumin for several reasons. First, albumin has a certain (yet unspecific) affinity for various surfaces and therefore would remain in place after the current was turned off. Second, the albumin stickiness is not strong enough to “glue” the nucleus to the NHT capillary, a fact that would make electrical measurements with the NHT impossible. Third, because there is no specific affinity of albumin for nuclear pore proteins, we expect that the position of the albumin molecules on the nuclear pore surface is determined exclusively by the electrical current flow. We used the NHT to expose X. laevis oocyte nuclei to an electric field in the presence of FITC-BSA. By applying a direct current, we detected the electrophoretic movement of FITC-BSA toward the nucleus residing in the narrowed part of the glass tube (Fig. 2A and supplemental Movie 1). Because of its negative charge, FITC-BSA moved toward the nuclear envelope surface facing the cathode. The accompanying electrical measurements revealed a significant increase in nuclear resistance (Fig. 1, B and C). Fig. 1B shows a recording in which FITC-BSA was added locally after the nucleus had been inserted into the hourglass. This method allowed us to avoid possible interaction between FITC-BSA and the electrodes. To ensure that the observed increase in resistance was due only to the directed movement of FITC-BSA and not to some unspecific binding of FITC-BSA to the nuclear envelope, we repeated the experiment with an alternating current (Fig. 1C, right bar). The data indicate that the increase in electrical resistance is due to the direct current-driven albumin-pore interaction and not to the simple presence of albumin molecules that randomly stick to the nuclear envelope surface. Fluorescence Detection of FITC-BSA at the Nuclear Membrane—After the nucleus was removed from the electrical setup, a bright fluorescent spot was still detectable on the apex of the nucleus that had been facing the cathode during the electrical measurement (Fig. 2B). In the next step, nuclear envelopes were spread on glass with the cytoplasmic side facing up for AFM measurements. Supplemental Movies 2 and 3 and supplemental Fig. 1 show how we routinely prepared the membranes of both cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic sides. We chose to work with dried preparations because FITC-BSA molecules should remain attached to the envelope surface and thus should be detectable by AFM. Fluorescence microscopy of the nuclear envelope spread on glass allowed us to distinguish between stained and unstained membrane areas (Fig. 2C). AFM Measurements of “Electrophoretically” Decorated Nuclear Pores—AFM was applied to fluorescent and nonfluorescent areas of the nuclear envelope (Fig. 2, D and E). We would like to emphasize that the membrane areas in Fig. 2, each 1 μm2, are representative of far larger areas (several thousands of μm2) investigated. We assumed that a “central channel-borne conductivity” should lead to an obstructed central channel opening or, in other words, reduction in the depth of the channel. In contrast, a “ring-borne peripheral conductivity” should lead to decoration of the cytoplasmic ring with albumin molecules. This should result in an increased height difference between the deepest measurable point of the central channel and the NPC ring surface. Fig. 2 (D and E) indicates that the central channels of pores were deeper at fluorescent than at nonfluorescent sites. To investigate the observed changes, we analyzed sections as well as rim profiles of single pores (Fig. 2, F and G), with nuclear pores located in nonfluorescent areas serving as controls. The histogram in Fig. 3A shows that the ring height (measured from the deepest point of the central channel) was significantly increased in pores of fluorescent areas relative to nonfluorescent areas. We assumed that binding of albumin molecules to the pore rim should lead to an increased roughness. To quantify this, we analyzed rim profiles and tested three different roughness parameters (Fig. 3, A–C). The first parameter, the average roughness, describes the arithmetic mean of the absolute distances of the surface points from the mean line. The second parameter, the peak-peak distance, is the distance between the highest and lowest peaks of a rim profile. The third parameter, the 10-point height, results from the average distances of the five highest peaks from the mean line plus the average distances of the five lowest peaks. All three parameters show an increased rim roughness of nuclear pores that were located at fluorescent sites of the nuclear envelope. This indicates that albumin molecules accumulated at the pore rims. Plugging of the NPC Central Channel Using Importin-β-(45–462)—In a second approach, the “separate pathway” hypothesis was tested by addressing whether the central channel is required for the passive diffusion of inorganic ions and small macromolecules. To this end, we blocked the central channel with the mutant importin-β-(45–462), a truncated version of the well studied nuclear transport factor (31Kutay U. Kim F.R. Kostka S. Kraft R. Görlich D. Cell. 1997; 90: 1061-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Importin-β-(45–462) lacks the binding site for importin-α and for GTP-bound Ran, which is required for the dissociation of importin-β from the pore after its arrival in the nucleoplasm (32Chook Y.M. Kim G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 703-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 33Görlich D. Kim M.J. Ribbeck K.

Cell. 2003; 112: 441-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). It is known that this results in the accumulation of the mutant in the central channel (36Jaggi R.D. Kim A. Ensslin K. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 4093-4098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), which blocks the active transport of proteins (31Kutay U. Kim F.R. Kostka S. Kraft R. Görlich D. Cell. 1997; 90: 1061-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). In this study, we analyzed the impact of this effective blocking protein on ion conductivity as well as on small solute permeability. After incubation of whole X. laevis oocyte nuclei with purified importin-β-(45–462), we prepared nuclear envelopes for AFM measurements. AFM Detection of Importin-β-(45–462) at the Nuclear Membrane—Compared with preparations of untreated control nuclei, virtually all the pores appeared to be plugged (Fig. 4, A–D), as quantified by profile measurements of individual pores (E and F). Whereas the data in Fig. 4 were obtained from the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear envelope, the data in Fig. 5 (A and B) were collected from the nucleoplasmic side. Again, all central channels appeared to be plugged, in contrast to controls. The results indicate the transport of importin-β-(45–462) through the central channel, consistent with the observations of Görlich et al. (33Görlich D. Kim M.J. Ribbeck K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1088-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), who found that an importin-β mutant stuck to the nuclear basket that was likewise deficient in the Ran-binding site.FIGURE 5Nucleoplasmic side, plugging dynamics, and permeability experiments after application of importin-β-(45–462). A, nucleoplasmic face of an untreated nuclear envelope (control). B, nucleoplasmic face of a nuclear envelope prepared from a nucleus that was incubated with 0.5 μm importin-β-(45–462) for 10 min. Instead of simple central channel plugs as observed on the cytoplasmic side, pores carry “hoods” resembling the structure of the nuclear basket. C, test of different incubation times. Shown are single nuclear pores viewed from the cytoplasmic face. After 60 min of incubation with 0.5 μm importin-β-(45–462), plugging was virtually completed. The grove between the plug and pore vanished completely. D, permeability for 19.5-kDa FITC-dextran and nuclear electrical resistance after 60 min of incubation with 0.5 μm importin-β-(45–462). Data are the mean ± S.E. (n = number of nuclei). The p values obtained by Student's t test were 0.92 for the dextran permeability and 0.75 for the electrical resistance.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As the plugs mentioned above are visible from both sides of the NPC, it becomes conceivable that accumulation of importin-β molecules has taken place in the interior of the NPC central channel. Again, we would like to emphasize that the membrane areas, each 4 μm2, displayed in Figs. 4 and 5 are representative of far larger areas (several thousands of μm2) investigated. We tested different incubation times and found the plugging to be most efficient after 60 min (Fig. 5C). This incubation time was then used for the following experiments. Electrical Measurements and Macromolecule Permeability Assays—After we found that the importin mutants consistently stuck in the NPC central channels, we performed electrical and fluorescence measurements under identical conditions. To our great surprise, neither the electrical conductivity of the nuclear envelope, which corresponds to passive ion transport across the nuclear envelope (24Shahin V. Kim T. Enss K. Ossig R. Oberleithner H. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1895-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), nor the nuclear envelope permeability to 19.5-kDa FITC-dextran showed any significant impairment (Fig. 5D). Thus, plugging of the central channel with importin-β-(45–462), as visualized by AFM, did not affect the permeability of the nuclear envelope for ions and small solutes. In summary, we conclude that there exists in NPCs a route for inorganic ions and small solutes that is separate from the central channel. Electric field-driven albumin cannot enter the central channel and plugs this pathway. Rather, albumin molecules reside at the cytoplasmic ring, as indicated by the apparent swelling of the NPC ring structure and the decrease in the ion permeability of the nuclear envelope. The data also indicate that the ion permeability of the central channel must be lower than that of the NPC rim. This “nonparticipation” of the central channel in the ion permeability of the nuclear envelope is further supported by mechanical blocking of the central channel with importin-β-(45–462) changing neither the ion permeability nor the small solute permeability. These findings are in apparent contradiction to those of Bustamante et al. (37Bustamante J.O. Kim J.A. Liepins A. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 146: 239-251PubMed Google Scholar), who found a decrease in ion conductivity after blocking the central channel. However, the antibody used in their study to block the central channel binds to four different pore proteins, two of which are indeed located on the cytoplasmic ring (38Saitoh H. Kim C.A. Burgess W.H. Earnshaw W.C. Dasso M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1319-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Recent support for peripheral routes of the NPC have been provided by Ohba et al. (39Ohba T. Kim E.C. Nishimoto T. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1051-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), who investigated the transport route of integral membrane proteins toward the inner nuclear membrane. They showed that integral membrane proteins move between the outer and inner nuclear membranes by lateral diffusion at the periphery of the NPC. Strong support in favor of our findings comes from a more recent study in which the interconnection between passive and active transport was investigated. Naim et al. (40Naim B. Kim V. Kapon R. Kiss V. Nevo R. Reich Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3881-3888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) found that active transport and passive transport of macromolecules are largely uncoupled and concluded that both pathways are spatially separated. Our findings suggest that the meshwork comprising the FG repeat domains inside the central channel (12Ribbeck K. Kim D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2664-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) could be denser than assumed previously. The hydrophobic interactions upon which the meshwork appears to be based are known to operate across long distances (41Singh S. Kim J. van Swol F. Brinker C.J. Nature. 2006; 442: 526Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Therefore, a repulsive effect for ions and charged molecules is likely to occur. The proposed alternative “peripheral” route for ions and small solutes is therefore presumably hydrophilic in nature. Some further support is provided by the observation that the diameter of the peripheral channels, 10 nm (4Hinshaw J.E. Kim B.O. Milligan R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 1133-1141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), matches the molecule size exclusion limit of ∼9 nm for passive diffusion (6Paine P.L. Kim L.C. Horowitz S.B.

https://openalex.org/W2001331637,"Previous work showed that prothrombin derivatives cleavable only at Arg-320 (rMZ) or Arg-271 (rP2) are partial, rather than competitive, inhibitors of prothrombin activation by prothrombinase. A “ping-pong”-like model, which posits two equilibrating forms of prothrombinase, explained the inhibition pattern. The present studies were undertaken to further investigate this putative mechanism. Two models were developed, one allowing for one form of the enzyme and the other allowing for two forms. Both models also allowed channeling and ratcheting. The models were fit to full time courses of prothrombin, meizothrombin, prethrombin-2, and the B-chain. In the absence of ratcheting and channeling, neither model fits the data. In their presence, however, both models fit very well, and thus they could not be distinguished. Therefore, inhibition of rMZ activation by rP2 was studied. Inhibition was partial and the two-form model fit the data with randomly distributed residuals, whereas the one-form model did not. Initial rates of fluorescein-labeled prothrombin cleavage in the presence of various prothrombin derivatives reported by Brufatto and Nesheim (Brufatto, N., and Nesheim, M. E. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 6755–6764) were also analyzed using the two models. The two-form model fit the partial inhibition data well, whereas the one-form model did not. In addition, prothrombin at varying concentrations was activated, and subsequently, the initial rates were plotted with respect to the initial prothrombin concentration. When compared with the expected initial rates as determined by the simulation of the models, the two-form model fit the observed rates better than the one-form model. The results obtained here further support the existence of two functional forms of prothrombinase.

The results obtained here further support the existence of two functional forms of prothrombinase. Prothrombinase is a multicomponent enzymatic complex that catalyzes the conversion of prothrombin to the blood clotting enzyme thrombin (1Esmon C.T. Suttie J.W. Jackson C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4095-4099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Steen M. Dahlbäck B. J. Biol.

Sci. 1991; 614: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It is composed of the serine protease factor Xa, the cofactor factor Va, a negatively charged phospholipid surface, and calcium ion. Prothrombin is activated to thrombin by two factor Xa-catalyzed cleavages, one at Arg-320 and the other at Arg-271 (5Jackson C.M. Nemerson Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 765-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 6Mann K.G. Elion J. Butkowski R.J. Downing M. Nesheim M. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 23: 286-302Google Scholar). Because two cleavages are required for activation, two intermediates are possible. Cleavage at Arg-320 first produces the intermediate meizothrombin, whereas cleavage at Arg-271 first produces the pair fragment 1.2 and prethrombin-2. Factor Xa alone is sufficient to activate prothrombin, but the process is remarkably slow. The combination of factor Va, calcium ion, and phospholipid increases the rate of activation by about a factor of 270,000 (7Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Rijn J.L. Govers-Riemslag J.W. Zwaal R.F. Rosing J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4557-4564Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the absence of factor Va, the preferred pathway is through the prethrombin-2 intermediate. In the presence of factor Va, however, the preferred pathway is through the meizothrombin intermediate (9Rosing J. Zwaal R.F. Tans G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4224-4228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Krishnaswamy S. Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1987; 262: 3291-3299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Many studies have been carried out to determine the mechanism by which factor Va enhances the rate of activation. Earlier studies indicated that it facilitates the association of factor Xa with the surface, thereby lowering the Km value for prothrombin activation (7Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Krishnaswamy S. Jones K.C. Mann K.G. J. Biol.

It also enhances the turnover number for prothrombin activation by a factor of about 3000 (7Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4557-4564Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Several groups have shown that factor Va interacts with factor Xa (13Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 16435-16442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) inferred an interaction between factor Va and proexosite I of prothrombin. In addition, Beck et al. (24Beck D.O. Bukys M.A. Singh L.S. Szabo K.A. Kalafatis M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3084-3095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) have shown that amino acid residues 695–699 are very important for optimum prothrombinase function, presumably because they mediate a prothrombin-factor Va interaction. This conclusion, however, is currently at odds with the data of Toso and Camire (25Toso R. Camire R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8773-8779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) who found that truncated mutants of factor Va lacking these residues were fully functional. Thus, the role of these residues in prothrombinase function is not fully resolved. In addition to these, prothrombin activation appears to involve an exosite for prothrombin on factor Xa, which becomes available upon interaction of factor Xa with factor Va (26Krishnaswamy S. Vlasuk G.P. Bergum P.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7897-7907Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 27Betz A. Vlasuk G.P. Bergum P.W. Krishnaswamy S.

Chem. 2004; 279: 20786-20793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that prothrombin activation can involve channeling whereby prothrombin is directly converted to thrombin without release of the intermediates (30Boskovic D.S. Bajzar L.S. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28686-28693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This mechanism is not exclusive in that intermediates are clearly released during the reaction. In addition, recent work by Bianchini et al. (31Bianchini E.P. Orcutt S.J. Panizzi P. Bock P.E. Krishnaswamy S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10099-10104Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) has shown that ratcheting during prothrombin activation occurs, i.e. following cleavage at Arg-320, the intermediate meizothrombin spontaneously changes conformation thereby making the second cleavage site at Arg-271 available for cleavage by prothrombinase. In efforts to characterize the four partial reactions involved in prothrombin activation, both Brufatto and Nesheim (32Brufatto N. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6755-6764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and Orcutt and Krishnaswamy (33Orcutt S.J. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54927-54936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) prepared recombinant mutants of prothrombin that could be cleaved only at Arg-271 or Arg-320. Orcutt and Krishnaswamy (33Orcutt S.J. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54927-54936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) found with their mutants that cleavage at Arg-271 in intact prothrombin is 30-fold slower than cleavage at Arg-320 in the presence of factor Va, thus explaining the utilization of the meizothrombin pathway. They inferred from their results that ordered bond cleavage is because of constraints associated with the binding of the substrates in one of two conformations to a single form of prothrombinase. Brufatto and Nesheim (32Brufatto N. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6755-6764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) found with their mutants that the catalytic efficiencies for the four partial reactions were very similar and thus could not rationalize selectivity for the meizothrombin pathway by kinetics of the partial reactions. They found, however, that the substrates that could be cleaved at only Arg-271 (rP2; R155A, R284A, R320A) or Arg-320 (rMZ; R155A, R271A, R284A) were partial inhibitors of prothrombin activation. To explain this effect, a model for prothrombin activation was devised that involves two forms of prothrombinase, each selective for one of the two bond cleavages. In addition, the model requires that the two forms spontaneously interconvert and that prothrombinase exhibits a “ping-pong”-like catalytic mechanism. Although the results of Brufatto and Nesheim (32Brufatto N. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6755-6764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) were consistent with the ping-pong-like model, and rationalized well the partial inhibition phenomenon, they were based on initial rate kinetics only. In addition, the model required the assumption that not only was the enzyme in steady state but also were the intermediates. Therefore, this study was carried out to determine whether the ping-pong-like model could rationalize the full time courses of prothrombin, meizothrombin, prethrombin-2, and thrombin B-chain during complete activation of prothrombin, and to further test the validity of the ping-pong-like model.

The quality of factor Va was assessed by titration with factor Xa and by SDS-PAGE (supplemental Figs. S4 and S5). Cell Culture and Recombinant Protein Purification—Baby hamster kidney cells transfected with rMZ-cDNA or rP2-cDNA in pNUT vector were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 nutrient mixture (1:1) supplemented with 5% newborn calf serum and 88 μm methotrexate. Once confluent, the growth medium was replaced by serum-free Opti-MEM I, supplemented with 50 μm ZnCl2, 10 μg/ml vitamin K1, and 1% v/v penicillin/streptomycin/Fungizone mixture. The medium was collected at 24-h intervals and stored at 4 °C for no more than 24 h prior to purification. The collected media were loaded onto XAD-2 (2.5 × 15 cm) and Q-Sepharose columns (1.4 × 8 cm) in tandem at room temperature. Once the media were loaded, the columns were dissected, and Q-Sepharose was washed with 5–10 column volumes of 0.02 m Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4 (TBS), and the prothrombin derivatives were eluted with 0.02 m Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.4. Fractions containing the eluted protein were identified using a Bio-Rad assay and pooled. The pooled fractions were then subjected to barium citrate precipitation by the addition of sodium citrate to a final concentration of 0.025 m and subsequent slow addition of 1.0 m barium chloride solution to a final concentration of 0.08 m. The solution was stirred at 4 °C for 1 h and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting pellet was washed with the supernatant from a parallel precipitation carried out in 0.02 m Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.4. The final pellet was then dissolved in minimal volume of 0.2 m EDTA, pH 8.0. The sample was then dialyzed against TBS at 4 °C overnight and subjected to anion-exchange chromatography by fast protein liquid chromatography on a Mono-Q HR 5/5 column at 4 °C. The protein was eluted using a 0–30 mm CaCl2 gradient in TBS over 1 h at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The first peak containing fully γ-carboxylated prothrombin derivatives eluted around 12 mm CaCl2, whereas the non-fully γ-carboxylated protein eluted in a broad second peak. Fractions in the first peak were pooled, precipitated by 80% ammonium sulfate, and stored at –20 °C in 50% glycerol in TBS. SDS-PAGE Time Course Analysis of Prothrombin Activation by Prothrombinase—Prothrombin (1.4 μm) with 10 μm DAPA, 50 μm PCPS, 20 nm factor Va, and 5 mm CaCl2 in 0.02 m HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4, 0.01% Tween 80 (HBST) was activated by adding 0.07 nm factor Xa at time 0. Aliquots were removed at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4–8, 10, 15, and 30 min and added to acetic acid to a final concentration of 0.134 n. These samples were then dried down, redissolved in gel sample buffer, and resolved by 10–14.5% SDS-PAGE. The gels were fixed in 50% methanol, 20% ethanol, and 6% trichloroacetic acid for at least 2 h and were stained with Coomassie Blue and destained. The gels were then dried down using BioDesignGelWrap (BioDesign Inc., New York) and scanned using CanoScan 5000F (Canon, Canada). Densitometry was carried out to determine the concentration of each band present. Quantification of Bands—To correct for the different amounts of Coomassie staining in each fragment of prothrombin and to convert the counts into molar concentrations, the stoichiometry of prothrombin fragments was used. When prothrombin is fully consumed, the relative concentration between fragment 1.2, B-chain, and A-chain would be 1:1:1. Using this relationship, molar concentrations of various fragments were determined using its respective correction coefficient, which were experimentally determined to be 0.849, 0.4468, 0.3695, 0.6265, 0.5492, and 0.0773 for prethrombin-1, fragment 1.2:A-chain, fragment 1.2, prethrombin-2, B-chain, and A-chain, respectively. Prothrombinase Models—Although prothrombinase is a multicomponent enzyme, for the purposes of modeling, it is considered to be a single enzymatic entity, designated E. Inone of the models, only one form of E is considered. This model is designated one-form prothrombinase (OF). In the other model, two interconvertible forms of the enzyme are considered (E1, E2), and the model is designated two-form prothrombinase (TF). Variations of both of these models, which incorporate either “ratcheting” of the intermediates, as demonstrated by Bianchini et al. (31Bianchini E.P. Orcutt S.J. Panizzi P. Bock P.E. Krishnaswamy S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10099-10104Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), for meizothrombin or channeling directly to thrombin without release of intermediates, as described by Boskovic et al. (30Boskovic D.S. Bajzar L.S. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28686-28693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), or both are considered as well. Thus, the one-form and two-form models each have four variants; one has neither ratcheting nor channeling (OF, TF); one has ratcheting only (OF-R, TF-R); one has channeling only (OF-C, TF-C), and one has both ratcheting and channeling (OF-RC, TF-RC). One-form Model—This model is depicted in Scheme 1. The enzyme (E) interacts with prothrombin (P) to form either complex (E ·P)1, from which meizothrombin (M) is produced, or complex (E ·P)2, from which prethrombin-2 (P2) is produced. The formations of (E ·P)1 and (E ·P)2 are characterized by Km values Km1 and Km4. These complexes turn over to free E and the intermediates M and P2, with kcat values k1 and k4, respectively. The intermediates M and P2 interact with free E to form complexes E ·M and E ·P2, with Km values Km2 and Km5, respectively. The complexes E ·M and E ·P2 turn over to yield free E and thrombin, with kcat values k2 and k5, respectively. Ratcheting occurs when M or P2 spontaneously convert to altered forms of the intermediates, designated M1 and P21, respectively. These events are depicted in Scheme 1 by boldface arrows. The kinetics of these processes are first order, with respective rate constants k7 and k8. The altered forms interact with free E to form E ·M1 and E ·P21, with respective Km values of Km3 and Km6. E ·M1 and E ·P21 convert to free E and thrombin, with respective kcat values of k3 and k6. Channeling occurs when (E ·P)1 or (E ·P)2 converts directly to thrombin without release of intermediates. These channeling pathways are depicted in Scheme 1 by the dashed lines. They are first order processes with rate constants kC1 for (E ·P)1, and kC2 for (E ·P)2. The rate equations for the one-form model with ratcheting and channeling are shown in Equations 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, d[P]/dt=−((k1+kC1)/Km1+(k4+kC2)/Km4)[E][P](Eq. 1) d[M]/dt=k1[E][P]/Km1−k2[E][M]/Km2−k7[M](Eq. 2) d[M1]/dt=k7[M]−k3[E][M1]/Km3(Eq. 3) d[P2]/dt=k4[E][P]/Km4−k5[E][P2]/Km5−k8[P2](Eq. 4) d[P21]/dt=k8[P2]−k6[E][P21]/Km6(Eq. 5) The conservation equation of total enzyme is shown in Equation 6, [E]0=[E]+[(E·P)1]+[(E·P)2]+[E·M]+[E·M1]+[E·P2]+[E·P21](Eq. 6) or Equation 7, [E]0=[E](1+[P]/Km1+[P]/Km4+[M]/Km2+[M1]/Km3+[P2]/Km5+[P21]/Km6)(Eq. 7) From Equation 7, free [E] is expressed in terms of [E]0, [P], [M], [M1], [P2], [P21], and Km values as in Equation 8. [E]=[E]0/(1+[P]/Km1+[P]/Km4+[M]/Km2+[M1]/Km3+[P2]/Km5+[P21]/Km6)(Eq. 8) The rate equations for the variant without channeling are identical to the above except that kC1 and kC2 are set to 0. The rate equations for the model without ratcheting are identical to the above except that k7 and k8 (and [M1] and [P21]) are set to 0. The rate equation for the variant lacking both channeling and ratcheting is identical to the above equations, except that kC1, kC2, k7, and k8 (and [M1] and [P21]) are set to 0. Two-form (Ping-Pong-like) Model—This model is depicted in Scheme 2. It is similar in many respects to the one-form model. However, it includes two forms of the enzyme, E1 and E2. The form E1 catalyzes cleavage at Arg-320, thereby converting prothrombin to meizothrombin or prethrombin-2 to thrombin. The other form, E2, catalyzes cleavage at Arg-271, thereby converting prothrombin to prethrombin-2 or meizothrombin to thrombin. E1 and E2 spontaneously interconvert with first-order rate constants k9 and k10. In addition, when either form of the enzyme engages its substrate and catalyzes bond cleavage, it reverts to the other form. In this respect, the enzyme exhibits a classic ping-pong-like mechanism (39Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Systems. 1975; (pp. , John Wiley & Sons, Toronto): 606-625Google Scholar). According to this model, E1 interacts with prothrombin (P) to form the complex E1 ·P, and E2 interacts with P to form the complex E2 ·P. The dissociation constants for these interactions are Km1 and Km4, respectively. E1 ·P converts to meizothrombin (M) and free E2, whereas E2 ·P converts to prethrombin-2 (P2) and free E1. The first-order rate constants for these steps are k1 and k4, respectively. E2 binds M with Km2 to form E2 ·M, and E1 binds P2 with Km5 to form E1 ·P2. E2 ·M turns over to form thrombin (T) and free E1, and E1 ·P2 turns over to form T and free E2. The rate constants for these steps are k2 and k5, respectively. As in the one-form model, M and P2 can spontaneously “ratchet” to M1 and P21, with first-order rate constants k7 and k8, respectively. These steps are depicted in Scheme 2 with boldface arrows. E2 binds to M1 to form E2 ·M1 and E1 binds to P21 to form E1 ·P21. The dissociation constants are Km3 and Km6, respectively. E2 ·M1 converts to T and E1, and E1 ·P21 converts to T and E2. The rate constants for these steps are k3 and k6, respectively. In addition, E1 ·P can channel directly to T and E1, and E2 ·P can channel directly to T and E2. These pathways are depicted in Scheme 2 with dashed lines. The corresponding first-order rate constants are kC1 and kC2, respectively. The rate equations for this model are shown as Equations 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. d[P]/dt=−((k1+kC1)[E1]/Km1+(k4+kC2)[E2]/Km4)[P](Eq. 9) d[M]/dt=k1[E1][P]/Km1−k7[M]−k2[E2][M]/Km2(Eq. 10) d[M1]/dt=k7[M]−k3[E2][M1]/Km3(Eq. 11) d[P2]/dt=k4[E2][P]/Km4−k8[P2]−k5[E1][P2]/Km5(Eq. 12) d[P21]/dt=k8[P2]−k6[E1][P21]/Km6(Eq. 13) In addition, [E1] and [E2] are presumed to be in a steady state so that Equation 14 is the result, d[E1]/dt=0=[E2](k2[M]/Km2+k3[M1]/Km3+k4[P]/Km4+k10)−[E1](k1[P]/Km1+k5[P2]/Km5+k6[P21]/Km6+k9)(Eq. 14) (Eq. 14) The conservation equation for the enzyme is shown as Equation 15, [E]0=[E1]+[E1·P]+[E1·P2]+[E1·P21]+[E2]+[E2·P]+[E2·M]+[E2·M1](Eq. 15) or Equation 16, [E]0=[E1](1+[P]/Km1+[P2]/Km5+[P21]/Km6)+[E2](1+[P]/Km4+[M]/Km2+[M1]/Km3)(Eq. 16) With the definitions given below in Equations 17, 18, 19, 20, Equations 14 and 16 can be expressed as in Equations 21 and 22, respectively. α1=1+[P]/Km1+[P2]/Km5+[P21]/Km6(Eq. 17) α2=1+[P]/Km4+[M]/Km2+[M1]/Km3(Eq. 18) β1=k1[P]/Km1+k5[P2]/Km5+k6[P21]/Km6+k9(Eq. 19) β2=k4[P]/Km4+k2[M]/Km2+k3[M1]/Km3+k10(Eq. 20) 0=β2[E2]−β1[E1](Eq. 21) [E]0=α1[E1]+α2[E2](Eq. 22) These latter two equations can be solved for [E1] and [E2]. The solutions are shown in Equations 23 and 24, where D (Equation 25) is the determinant of the matrix implicit in Equations 21 and 22. [E1]=[E]0β2/D(Eq. 23) [E2]=[E]0β1/D(Eq. 24) D=α1β2+α2β1(Eq. 25) Concentrations of P, M, M1, P2, and P21 over time were calculated by numerical integration with Berkeley Madonna software (University of California, Berkeley). For the one-form model, Equations 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 were integrated, with [E] given by Equation 8. For the two-form model, Equations 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 were integrated, with [E1] and [E2] given by Equations 23 and 24, respectively. The concentration of the B-chain was calculated according to [B] = [P]0–[P]–[P2]–[P21], where [P]0 is the initial prothrombin concentration. Parameter values were optimized by the software using the Simplex procedure of Nelder and Mead (40Nelder J.A. Mead R. Comput. J. 1965; 7: 308-313Crossref Google Scholar) to minimize the sum of the least squares differences between the calculated and observed results (loss). In addition, two conditions were imposed during the fit of models to data to be consistent with the previous experimental data observed by Brufatto and Nesheim (32Brufatto N. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6755-6764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These were as follows: 1) the total turnover rate of meizothrombin to thrombin represented by k2 without ratcheting or k3 with ratcheting in Schemes 1 and 2 was limited to at least 150 s–1, and 2) the total turnover rate of prethrombin-2 to thrombin represented by k5 or k6 in Schemes 1 and 2 was limited to at least 114 s–1. These models are based on the approximation that all enzyme forms are in the steady state. The validity of this approximation was established by examining the stopped-flow, rapid chemical quench data of Walker and Krishnaswamy (Fig. 4 of Ref. 41Walker R.K. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27441-27450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), by measuring the time course of fluorescent rMZ cleavage by prothrombinase, and by fitting the time course data on prothrombin activation by numerical analysis without including the steady state approximation. According to the Michaelis-Menten model the reaction can be described by Reaction 1, [E]+[S]⇌k−1k1[E·S]→k2[E]+[P]REACTION 1 The concentration of E ·S is given by Equation 26, [E·S]=[E]0[S]Km+[S](1−exp(−k1(Km+[S])t))(Eq. 26) At “long” times, the time-dependent term is negligible and steady state in [E ·S] exists such that [E ·S] = [E]0[S]/(Km + [S]). The magnitude of time transient is reflected in the exponential term exp(–k1(Km + [S]t). Walker and Krishnaswamy showed (see Fig. 4 in Ref. 41Walker R.K. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27441-27450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that prothrombin at 0.3 μm is converted to thrombin at a rate of 3.1 μm/s. Because the reaction rate is less than or equal to k1[E][S], a lower limit for the value of k1 can be calculated to be 3.3 × 107/m/s. Thus, with a Km value of 0.3 μm and a prothrombin concentration of 1.4 μm, the value of the exponent in the transient term evaluates to 56.1/s. Thus, the maximum half-time for the assembly of the E ·S complex is about"
https://openalex.org/W2076421117,"Post-translational modification of histones is critical for gene expression, mitosis, cell growth, apoptosis, and cancer development. Thus, finding protein kinases that are responsible for the phosphorylation of histones at critical sites is considered an important step in understanding the process of histone modification. The serine/threonine kinase Cot is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase family. We show here that Cot can phosphorylate histone H3 at Ser-10 in vivo and in vitro, and that the phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser-10 is required for Cot-induced cell transformation. We found that activated Cot is recruited to the c-fos promoter resulting in increased activator protein-1 (AP-1) transactivation. The formation of the Cot-c-fos promoter complex was also apparent when histone H3 was phosphorylated at Ser-10. Furthermore, the use of dominant negative mutants of histone H3 revealed that Cot was required for phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser-10 to induce neoplastic cell transformation. These results revealed an important function of Cot as a newly discovered histone H3 kinase. Moreover, the transforming ability of Cot results from the coordinated activation of histone H3, which ultimately converges on the regulation of the transcriptional activity of the c-fos promoter, followed by AP-1 transactivation activity."
https://openalex.org/W1994932470,"The GADD45γ protein is a potential tumor suppressor whose expression is reduced in several tumors. However, very little is known about the regulation of its expression. We have determined that the most relevant region of its promoter lies between nucleotides −112 and −54, relative to the transcription start site. Putative Oct and NF-Y elements were found in this region and factors belonging to these families interacted with these elements in vitro and with the promoter in vivo. Mutation of these elements reduced the basal activity of the promoter, suggesting that both sites are essential for basal expression. These factors interact with chromatin modifying proteins and we found that histone deacetylase 1 or silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor overexpression reduced the basal activity of the promoter. In contrast, forced expression of the histone acetylase protein PCAF or cell treatment with the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A increased GADD45γ mRNA levels and induced GADD45γ promoter activity through its Oct and NF-Y elements. Moreover, ectopic expression of a dominant-negative version of NF-YA strongly inhibited trichostatin A-induced activation of the promoter. Our data strongly suggest that inhibition of deacetylase activity could potentially be used for treatment of tumors where GADD45γ expression is reduced."
https://openalex.org/W2171766579,"The p53 gene is often mutated during cancer development. Frequency and functional consequences of these mutations vary in different tumor types. We analysed conformation and temperature dependency of 23 partially inactivating temperature-dependent (td) p53 mutants derived from various human tumors in yeast. We found considerable differences in transactivation capabilities and discriminative character of various p53 mutants. No correlations in transactivation rates and conformations of the td p53 proteins were detected. Amifostine-induced p53 reactivation occurred only in 13 of 23 td mutants, and this effect was temperature dependent and responsive element specific. The most of the p53 mutations (10/13) reactivated by amifostine were located in the part of the p53 gene coding for hydrophobic β-sandwich structure of the DNA-binding domain."
https://openalex.org/W2054977180,"The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip1) arrests cell cycle progression through G1/S phases and is regulated by phosphorylation of serine/threonine residues. Recently, we identified the serine/threonine kinase, KIS, which phosphorylates p27(Kip1) on serine 10 leading to nuclear export of p27(Kip1) and protein degradation. However, the molecular mechanisms of transcriptional activation of the human KIS gene and its biological activity are not known. We mapped the transcription initiation site approximately 116 bp 5' to the translation start site, and sequences extending to -141 were sufficient for maximal promoter activity. Mutation in either of two Ets-binding sites in this region resulted in an approximately 75-80% decrease in promoter activity. These sites form at least 3 specific complexes, which contained GA-binding protein (GABP). Knocking down GABPalpha by siRNA in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) diminished KIS gene expression and reduced cell migration. Correspondingly, in serum stimulated GABPalpha-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), KIS gene expression was also significantly reduced, which was associated with an increase in p27(Kip1) protein levels and a decreased percentage of cells in S-phase. Consistent with these findings, following vascular injury in vivo, GABPalpha-heterozygous mice demonstrated reduced KIS gene expression within arterial lesions and these lesions were significantly smaller compared to GABP+/+ mice. In summary, serum-responsive GABP binding to Ets-binding sites activates the KIS promoter, leading to KIS gene expression, cell migration, and cell cycle progression."
https://openalex.org/W2061484053,"We have previously described the identification of a nucleoside analog transcriptional inhibitor ARC (4-amino-6-hydrazino-7-β-D-ribofuranosyl-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]-pyrimidine-5-carboxamide) that was able to induce apoptosis in cancer cell lines of different origin. Here, we report the characterization of ARC on a panel of neuroblastoma cell lines. We found that these cell lines were more than 10-fold sensitive to ARC than to the well-known nucleoside analog DRB (5,6-dichloro-1-β-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole), and that ARC-induced apoptosis proceeds through mitochondrial injury. Also, we observed that ARC-mediated cell death was accompanied by caspase-3 cleavage and repression of antiapoptotic proteins such as Mcl-1 and survivin. Conversely, we found that overexpression of Mcl-1-protected neuroblastoma cell line NB-1691 from ARC-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that while ARC inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt Ser-473 in multiple cancer cell lines, forced expression of myristoylated Akt promoted resistance to ARC-induced apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells. In addition, we observed that ARC was able to downregulate the protein levels of N-myc, a commonly amplified oncogene in neuroblastomas, and Akt protected N-myc from ARC-induced downregulation. These data suggest that ARC may antagonize different antiapoptotic pathways and induce apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells via multiple mechanisms. Overall, ARC could represent an attractive candidate for anticancer drug development against neuroblastomas."

The first step of HIV entry is gp120 association with the CD4 receptor on the target cell surface, which initiates conformational changes that reveal a second site on gp120 that binds to a co-receptor (CXCR4 or CCR5) (5Doms R.W.

Concomitantly, the ectodomain of HIV-1 gp41 undergoes conformational change(s) resulting in the six helix bundle formation that drives membrane fusion (9Cohen F.S. Kim G.B. J. Membr.

Each monomer has an N-terminal helical region (NHR) followed by a more disordered loop and a C-terminal helical region (CHR). The N-terminal helices pack tightly together to form a three-helical bundle while the C-terminal helices pack around the outside of this bundle into hydrophobic grooves (10Gallo S.A. Kim C.M.

The most successful of these peptides have turned out to be those derived from the CHR of gp41.

The challenge in developing peptide-based therapeutics is complicated primarily by their relatively short half-lives and poor distribution in vivo because of their susceptibility to enzymatic degradation and rapid renal clearance. Effective anti-HIV activity in humans taking Fuzeon® (T20, Trimeris/Roche Applied Sciences) requires two subcutaneous injections daily totaling 180 mg of drug (28Patel I.H. Kim X. Nieforth K. Salgo M. Buss N. Clin. Pharmacokinet. 2005; 44: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We postulated that an anti-fusogenic peptide chemically modified to react covalently with the surface of HIV, and more specifically with gp41, would produce a more effective anti-viral such that (i) the peptide renders the gp41 to which it is attached fusion incompetent on a permanent basis; (ii) the covalently attached peptide is sheltered from proteolysis by plasma or lymph-derived enzymes and (iii) permanent specific attachment of the covalent inhibitor is projected to counteract rapid clearance of the compound after in vivo administration.Using a temperature-arrested state prime wash in vitro assay (29Melikyan G.B.

J. 2006; 3:36: 36Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar), we report a novel inhibition strategy of HIV that is based upon the design of compounds composed of two parts: a binding element responsible for conferring selectivity and high affinity for the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein, and a reactive group responsible for the formation of a covalent bond between the affinity probe and the virus. We used CHR peptides composed of chemical spacers and labile groups strategically designed to form a covalent bond with the ε-NH of Lys574 (Fig. 1). Based upon x-ray crystal and NMR structures reported to date (11Weissenhorn W. Kim A. Harrison S.C. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 426-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar, 12Chan D.C. Kim D. Berger J.M. Kim P.S.

A. 1998; 95: 9134-9139Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), the addition of the reactive groups was hypothesized to be optimally aligned when placed onto or near the site normally occupied by Asp632 of the CHR peptide. This was due to close proximity and also to the role of Asp632 in salt-bridge formation with Lys574 of the NHR. Indeed, Lys574 has been found to be an important target for small molecule inhibitors and has been determined by mutational analysis to be critical for six helix bundle formation and stability (33He Y. Kim S. Jing W. Lu H. Cai D. Chin D.J. Debnath A.K. Kirchhoff F. Jiang S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25631-25639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). From this model, we have chemically linked the reactive groups to the ε-NH of a lysine residue inserted within the amino acid sequence of C34 normally occupied by Asp632 or onto the N terminus of the peptide using the α-NH of Trp628 (Fig. 1).The temperature-arrested state prime wash in vitro assay has provided evidence for the trapping of the gp41 pre-hairpin intermediate in HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion by the covalent reaction with the specific anti-HIV-1 peptide. Our results are strong evidence for the notion that gp41 intermediates exist transiently during the HIV fusion process and can be permanently trapped.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPeptide Synthesis—Synthesis of the corresponding reactive peptides, CHR peptide analogs, and the scrambled peptides corresponding to maleimido-glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), and maleimido-growth hormone releasing factor (GRF) peptides, were performed using an automated solid-phase procedure on a Symphony Peptide Synthesizer with manual intervention during the generation of the peptides. The synthesis was performed on Fmoc-protected Ramage amide linker resin, using Fmoc-protected amino acids. Coupling was achieved by using O-benzotriazol-1-yl-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-uronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU) and diisopropylethylamine (DIEA) as the activator mixture in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution. The Fmoc protective group was removed using 20% piperidine/DMF. A Boc-protected amino acid was used at the N terminus to generate the free α-N terminus following cleavage of the peptides from the resin. Sigmacoted glass reaction vessels were used during the synthesis.When the maleimide is positioned at the C terminus portion of the molecule (Compounds E and F, see Table 1), the solid-phase synthesis of the peptide was initiated by the addition of Fmoc-Lys(Aloc). Aloc is a specific orthogonal protective group stable to acidic medium. The peptide chain was then elongated on solid support via the sequential addition of amino acids having their side chains protected with groups labile to acidic medium. When the peptide chain was completed, the Aloc protective group on the C-terminal lysine was removed selectively using tetrakistriphenylphosphine palladium. The Fmoc-aminoethoxy ethoxy acetic acid (AEEA) linker was then chemically coupled to the unprotected lysine. Following classical Fmoc deprotection protocols, maleimide proprionic acid (MPA) was then chemically coupled to the AEEA spacer. Finally, the acid labile protecting groups were removed from the peptide and the peptide was cleaved from the solid support using a strong acidic mixture.TABLE 1HIV entry inhibitorsC34AcaAc acetyl. -(628)WMEWDREINNYTSLIHSLIEESQNQQEKNEQELL(661)-CONH2bCONH2, carboxamide.Inhibitor (control)AMPA-AEEA-(628)WMEWDREINNYTSLIHSLIEESQNQQERNEQELL(661)-CONH2bCONH2, carboxamide.Covalent inhibitorBAcaAc acetyl. -(628)WMEWDREINNYTSLIHSLIEESQNQQERNEQELL(661)-CONH2bCONH2, carboxamide.C34 peptide (control)CAcaAc acetyl. -(628)WMEWK(AEEA-MPA)REINNYTSLIHSLIEESQNQQERNEQELL(661)-CONH2bCONH2, carboxamide.Covalent inhibitorDAcaAc acetyl. -(628)WMEWK(CO-OPH)REINNYTSLIHSLIEESQNQQERNEQELL(661)-CONH2bCONH2, carboxamide.Covalent inhibitor - less reactive groupEH(dA)EGTFTSDVSSYLEGQAAKEFIAWLVKGRK(AEEA-MPA)-CONH2bCONH2, carboxamide.Scrambled peptideFY(dA)DAIFTQSYRKVLAQLSARKLLQDILSRK(MPA)-CONH2bCONH2, carboxamide.Scrambled peptideN36AcaAc acetyl. -(546)SGIVQQQNNLLRAIEAQQHLLQLTVWGIKQLQARIL(581)-CONH2bCONH2, carboxamide.N36 peptide (Control)N36(K574R)AcaAc acetyl. -(546)SGIVQQQNNLLRAIEAQQHLLQLTVWGIRQLQARIL(581)-CONH2bCONH2, carboxamide.N36 peptide K574R mutation (control)a Ac acetyl.b CONH2, carboxamide. Open table in a new tab Because the C34 peptide is composed of only two free amino groups, the free N terminus and the ε-NH of Lys655 of gp41, insertion of the chemical spacers and reactive moieties onto the intended sites within the C34 peptide was facilitated by substitution of Lys655 with an arginine residue, followed by direct chemical coupling either onto the free N terminus of the peptide (Compound A) or by insertion of a new Fmoc-Lys(Aloc) residue at the site normally occupied by Asp632 (Compound C). Therefore, a negative control (i.e. unreactive) C34 peptide analog is also composed of Lys655 substituted with an arginine residue (Compound B).Peptide Purification—Each product was purified by preparative reverse-phase HPLC, using a Varian (Dynamax) binary HPLC system. Purification of all DAC peptides were performed using a Phenomenex Luna phenyl-hexyl (10 micron, 50 mm × 250 mm) column equilibrated with a water/trifluoroacetic acid mixture (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O; Solvent A) and acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in CH3CN; Solvent B). Elution was achieved at 50 ml/min by running various gradients of Solvent B over 180 min. Fractions containing peptide were detected by UV absorbance (Varian Dynamax UVD II) at 214 and 254 nm.Fractions containing the desired product were identified by mass after direct injection onto LC/MS. The selected fractions were subsequently analyzed by analytical HPLC (20-60% B over 20 min; Phenomenex Luna 5 micron phenyl-hexyl, 10 mm × 250 mm column, 0.5 ml/min) to identify fractions with ≥90% purity for pooling. The pool was then freeze-dried using liquid nitrogen and subsequently lyophilized yielding a white powder.In Vitro Complex Formation between NHR and CHR Peptide—N36 peptide derived from the sequence of the N-terminal helical region of HIV gp41 was allowed to react with the covalent and non-covalent entry inhibitors in vitro and analyzed by HPLC. 2 mm of each CHR peptide analog was prepared in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer pH 7 and N36 peptide was prepared at 2 mm in 95% ethanol. The peptides were then diluted to 0.2 mm in 50% ethanol/50% sodium phosphate buffer pH 7 and allowed to incubate at 37 °C for 30 min. Reverse-phase HPLC assays were performed on a Waters™ model 2695 system in line with a UV absorbance detector (model 2487) set at 214 nm, and fitted with a Zorbax 300 SB-C18 column (Agilent Technologies; 150 × 4.6 mm; 3.5 μm, 300 Å) equilibrated with a mixture of H2O/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (Solvent A) and acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (Solvent B) at 35% solvent B at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. For each sample injection, ∼10 μg of each peptide was loaded onto HPLC and the various compounds (i.e. CHR peptide analogs, N36 peptides, dimers of CHR peptide analog/N36) were resolved by applying a gradient from 35-37% solvent B over 2 min followed by a linear gradient from 37-55% solvent B over 20 min.Cell-Cell Fusion Assay—HL2/3 cells were obtained through the AIDS Reference and Reagent Program, NIH from Dr. Barbara Felber and Dr. George Pavlakis (34Ciminale V.

Fusion was measured by a luciferase enzyme assay using the BriteLite Reporter Gene Assay System according to the manufacturer’s directions (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Experiments were performed in triplicate and normalized to the appropriate fusion signal in the absence of inhibitor. IC50 values were computed by fitting a four-parameter nonlinear regression model with R statistical software (37DeLean A. Kim P.J. Rodbard D. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 235: E97-E102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Bates D.M. Kim D.G. Nonlinear Regression Analysis. Wiley, New York1988Google Scholar).Temperature-arrested State Prime Wash Assays—HL2/3 cells were plated the day prior to the assay at 200,000 cells/ml in a 96-well plate. Inhibitors were reconstituted into phosphate-buffered saline. TZM cells were prepared to 200,000 cells/ml in the presence of serum, and the selected amounts of inhibitors were diluted into the cells or into medium with serum to the appropriate concentrations. All samples were cooled to 24 °C and then TZM cells in suspension in medium with serum were added to the plated HL2/3 cells with or without the presence of inhibitor. This was followed by incubation in the presence of serum at 24 °C for 3 h to establish the temperature-arrested state. Appropriate wells were washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline. Each wash step was incubated for 4 min. TZM cells or medium with serum were then added to appropriate wells, and the plates were moved immediately to 37 °C to initiate full fusion and incubated for 4 h. The fusion levels were measured by a luciferase enzyme assay using the BriteLite Reporter Gene Assay System according to the manufacturer’s directions (Perkin-Elmer). All experiments were in triplicate and each treated set shown was normalized to the corresponding wild-type fusion level.Mutagenesis and Transfection—The mutant K574R was made in the plasmid pHXB2-env from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (39Page K.A. Kim N.R. Littman D.R. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5270-5276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutation was verified by DNA sequence analysis by the DNA sequencing facility in the Research Technology Program at the NCI-Frederick. HeLa cells were cotransfected with EnvK574R, Rev, and Tat (pBsTAT and pCMVsREV were gifts of George Pavlakis and Margherita Rosati, National Cancer Institute, Vaccine Branch, Frederick, MD) in a 1:1:1 ratio using ExGen500 (Fermentas). Transfected cells were incubated 48 h at 37 °C and TAS fusion assays with TZM cells were performed as described above.RESULTSHPLC Analysis of Covalent Entry Inhibitors Added to N36—The CHR peptide analogs were designed to bind with high affinity to the N-terminal helix of gp41 (Table 1). Compounds A, C, and D are CHR peptide analogs designed for specific alignment with Lys574 of gp41 yet expected to have differing reaction rates (i.e. reactive group location more distant or maleimide ring versus phenyl ester). Compounds E and F are negative controls made up of a GLP-1 and a GRF peptide respectively, both of which were not expected to associate with the NHR. Compound B was a control peptide that is identical to C34 except for an acetylated N terminus and Lys655 substituted with an arginine; necessary to have only one reactive lysine in the experimental peptides. Following purification by HPLC, the compounds were tested for their ability to link covalently to the N-terminal helix of gp41. A small NHR peptide, N36, corresponding to the amino acid sequence from positions 546-581 within the N-terminal helix of gp41, was incubated with the covalent entry inhibitors and controls and the binding was studied by reverse-phase HPLC. It is important to note that the N36 peptides used in these experiments were capped at the free N terminus with an acetyl group (Table 1) resulting in a compound containing only one free amine group on the peptide, that being the lysine representing the structural equivalent to Lys574 of gp41. Following incubation of N36 with Compound A or Compound C shown in Fig. 2, A and C, a new species with a retention time of ∼18 min is observed that does not correspond to any of the peaks that appear when the compounds are analyzed prior to coincubation. Furthermore, LC/MS analysis confirms that the identities of these new species correspond to one copy each of N36 and the C-peptide (data not shown). Conversely, the co-incubation of compound B with N36 did not show the formation of any additional peak (Fig. 2B) that would have indicated formation of a new species. This panel also demonstrates that the reverse-phase HPLC conditions used in these studies abrogated non-covalent interactions between N36 and the C-peptide. The overall yield and rate of reaction in forming this new species appears greatest when using compound C in these experiments. Furthermore, the precise location of covalent attachment within N36 was identified by preparing a mutant N36 peptide wherein Lys574 was substituted with an arginine, N36(K574R) (Fig. 2D). Co-incubation of compound C with the N36(K574R) peptide yields results that are similar to the co-incubation of Compound B with N36; no formation of an additional peak representing a covalent dimer (Fig. 2, B and D).FIGURE 2NHR peptides and the covalent entry inhibitors derived from CHR peptides form covalent dimers. Panels show HPLC analyses after co-incubation of peptides. A, top trace is N36 incubated with Compound A. The middle trace is N36 alone, and the bottom trace is Compound A alone.

IC50 values were computed by fitting a four-parameter nonlinear regression model (38Bates D.M. Kim D.G. Nonlinear Regression Analysis. Wiley, New York1988Google Scholar, 40DeLean A. Kim P.J. Rodbard D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1979; 15: 60-70PubMed Google Scholar) with R statistical software. The IC50 values for the experimental compounds (A, B, C, and D) and the C34 control without washing were very similar ranging from 1.1-2.2 nm (Table 2). Hence, the chemical modifications found in compounds A and C had no impact upon the affinity of the C34 peptide for the NHR region of gp41. Compounds E and F correspond to maleimido peptides composed of the peptide sequences of human GLP-1 and a mutated form of GRF. As expected, compounds E and F were found to be inactive in all assays performed.TABLE 2IC50 values for HIV entry inhibitorsIC50PWaPrime wash.PNWbPrime-no wash.NPWcNo prime wash.nmC34NIdLittle or no inhibition at [inhibitor] ≤ 5 μm.2.17 ± 0.31NIdLittle or no inhibition at [inhibitor] ≤ 5 μm.A465.1 ± 102.72.09 ± 0.20NIdLittle or no inhibition at [inhibitor] ≤ 5 μm.BNIdLittle or no inhibition at [inhibitor] ≤ 5 μm.1.01 ± 0.07NIdLittle or no inhibition at [inhibitor] ≤ 5 μm.C679.0 ± 77.51.99 ± 0.22NIdLittle or no inhibition at [inhibitor] ≤ 5 μm.DNIdLittle or no inhibition at [inhibitor] ≤ 5 μm.1.05 ± 0.08NIdLittle or no inhibition at [inhibitor] ≤ 5 μm.ENIdLittle or no inhibition at [inhibitor] ≤ 5 μm.NIdLittle or no inhibition at [inhibitor] ≤ 5 μm.NIdLittle or no inhibition at [inhibitor] ≤ 5 μm.FNIdLittle or no inhibition at [inhibitor] ≤ 5 μm.NIdLittle or no inhibition at [inhibitor] ≤ 5 μm.NIdLittle or no inhibition at [inhibitor] ≤ 5 μm.a Prime wash.b Prime-no wash.c No prime wash.d Little or no inhibition at [inhibitor] ≤ 5 μm.

This assay is based upon the temperature sensitivity of envelope-mediated membrane fusion and functions by using low temperature to arrest the fusion process at an intermediate state. Fusion is a multi-step mechanism activated by the addition of cells bearing the CD4 receptor and the CXCR4/CCR5 co-receptors to a cell line which has the HIV envelope proteins expressed on the surface. Unlike traditional HIV replication and fusion assays, in vitro incubation at 24 °C (priming) was found to establish a conformationally arrested state which exhibits no evidence of fusion pore formation until the temperature is shifted to 37 °C (29Melikyan G.B. Kim R.M. Hemmati H. Delmedico M.K. Lambert D.M. Cohen F.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 413-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), thus allowing a homogeneous and prolonged exposure of the normally camouflaged NHR and CHR regions of gp41 (see Fig. 5). Because of the ability to arrest the intermediate conformational state of gp41 using lowered temperature, the temperature-arrested state prime wash assay was used to test the panel of experimental compounds designed to covalently cross-link the inhibitor to gp41 for permanent inhibition (Table 2 and Fig. 3).FIGURE 5Cartoon model of inhibitory peptides targeting intermediates in HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion. The HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein is depicted as a trimer of heterodimers consisting of gp120 (brown/yellow) and gp41 (blue) molecules. For simplicity only one trimer is shown although more may be involved in the fusion reaction. The target membrane contains CD4 (green) and co-receptor (pink) molecules. At room temperature CD4 binds gp120, which results in the opening up of gp120 sites for co-receptor attachment and gp41 regions for binding to inhibitory peptides (pre-hairpin conformation). This is the TAS. Inhibitory peptides are then added, and the cells are washed before increasing the temperature to 37 °C. The non-reactive peptide (e.g. C34)"

VEGF receptor 2 (Flk1) functions as the major signal transducer of angiogenesis, mediating VEGF induction of endothelial tubulogenesis. We have cloned and analyzed expression of Flk1 in the blind subterranean mole rat Spalax ehrenbergi. Spalax experience abrupt and sharp changes in oxygen supply in their sealed underground niche and, hence, are genetically adapted to hypoxia and serve as a unique, natural mammalian model organism for hypoxia tolerance. Spalax Flk1 is relatively conserved at the nucleic acid and amino acid level compared to human, mouse, and rat orthologs. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze Flk1 expression in muscle and brain of animals exposed to ambient or variant hypoxic oxygen levels at multiple stages of development. Transcript levels were compared with those obtained from Rattus, a primary model for human physiology. Our findings demonstrate that under normoxic conditions Flk1 patterns of expression correlate well with our previous investigations of VEGF expression. Exposure to hypoxic conditions resulted in divergent patterns of Flk1 expression between Spalax and Rattus and between muscle and brain. It appears that the regulatory mechanisms differentiating expression between the species and between tissues are most likely unique, suggesting that Flk1 expression may be regulated by multiple processes, including both angiogenesis and neurogenesis."
