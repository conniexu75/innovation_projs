https://openalex.org/W3211202897,"We report severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine effectiveness against infection (VE-I) and death (VE-D) by vaccine type in 780,225 veterans in the Veterans Health Administration, covering 2.7% of the US population. From February to October 2021, VE-I declined for all vaccine types, and the decline was greatest for the Janssen vaccine, resulting in a VE-I of 13.1%. Although breakthrough infection increased risk of death, vaccination remained protective against death in persons who became infected during the Delta variant surge. From July to October 2021, VE-D for age &lt;65 years was 73.0% for Janssen, 81.5% for Moderna, and 84.3% for Pfizer-BioNTech; VE-D for age ≥65 years was 52.2% for Janssen, 75.5% for Moderna, and 70.1% for Pfizer-BioNTech. Findings support continued efforts to increase vaccination, booster campaigns, and multiple additional layers of protection against infection."
https://openalex.org/W3210408195,"Efforts to determine why new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants demonstrate improved fitness have been limited to analyzing mutations in the spike (S) protein with the use of S-pseudotyped particles. In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles (SC2-VLPs) can package and deliver exogenous transcripts, enabling analysis of mutations within all structural proteins and at multiple steps in the viral life cycle. In SC2-VLPs, four nucleocapsid (N) mutations found universally in more-transmissible variants independently increased messenger RNA delivery and expression ~10-fold, and in a reverse genetics model, the serine-202→arginine (S202R) and arginine-203→methionine (R203M) mutations each produced >50 times as much virus. SC2-VLPs provide a platform for rapid testing of viral variants outside of a biosafety level 3 setting and demonstrate N mutations and particle assembly to be mechanisms that could explain the increased spread of variants, including B.1.617.2 (Delta, which contains the R203M mutation)."
https://openalex.org/W3210780992,"The stability of supported nanocatalysts is crucial to meeting environmental and energy challenges and necessitates fundamental theory to relieve trial-and-error experimentation and accelerate lab-to-fab translation. Here, we report a Sabatier principle of metal-support interaction for stabilizing metal nanocatalysts against sintering based on the kinetic simulations of 323 metal-support pairs using scaling relations from 1252 energetics data. Too strong of an interaction is shown to trigger Ostwald ripening, whereas too weak of an interaction stimulates particle migration and coalescence. High-throughput screening of supports enables the sintering resistance of nanocatalysts to reach the Tammann temperature on homogeneous supports and far beyond it on heteroenergetic supports. This theory, which is substantiated by first-principles neural network molecular dynamics simulations and experiments, paves the way for the design of ultrastable nanocatalysts."
https://openalex.org/W3208793204,"Fine particulate matter (PM2.5, particles with a mass median aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers) in the atmosphere is associated with severe negative impacts on human health, and the gases sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and ammonia are the main PM2.5 precursors. However, their contribution to global health impacts has not yet been analyzed. Here, we show that nitrogen accounted for 39% of global PM2.5 exposure in 2013, increasing from 30% in 1990 with rising reactive nitrogen emissions and successful controls on sulfur dioxide. Nitrogen emissions to air caused an estimated 23.3 million years of life lost in 2013, corresponding to an annual welfare loss of 420 billion United States dollars for premature death. The marginal abatement cost of ammonia emission is only 10% that of nitrogen oxides emission globally, highlighting the priority for ammonia reduction."
https://openalex.org/W3210441301,"The evolutionary origin of metazoan cell types such as neurons and muscles is not known. Using whole-body single-cell RNA sequencing in a sponge, an animal without nervous system and musculature, we identified 18 distinct cell types. These include nitric oxide–sensitive contractile pinacocytes, amoeboid phagocytes, and secretory neuroid cells that reside in close contact with digestive choanocytes that express scaffolding and receptor proteins. Visualizing neuroid cells by correlative x-ray and electron microscopy revealed secretory vesicles and cellular projections enwrapping choanocyte microvilli and cilia. Our data show a communication system that is organized around sponge digestive chambers, using conserved modules that became incorporated into the pre- and postsynapse in the nervous systems of other animals."
https://openalex.org/W3209858224,"Clonal hematopoiesis results from enhanced fitness of a mutant hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC), but how such clones expand is unclear. We developed a technique that combines mosaic mutagenesis with color labeling of HSPCs to study how acquired mutations affect clonal fitness in a native environment. Mutations in clonal hematopoiesis–associated genes such as asxl1 promoted clonal dominance. Single-cell transcriptional analysis revealed that mutations stimulated expression of proinflammatory genes in mature myeloid cells and anti-inflammatory genes in progenitor cells of the mutant clone. Biallelic loss of one such immunomodulator, nr4a1, abrogated the ability of asxl1-mutant clones to establish clonal dominance. These results support a model where clonal fitness of mutant clones is driven by enhanced resistance to inflammatory signals from their mutant mature cell progeny."

https://openalex.org/W3209993921,"The Birch reduction dearomatizes arenes into 1,4-cyclohexadienes. Despite substantial efforts devoted to avoiding ammonia and cryogenic conditions, the traditional, cumbersome, and dangerous procedure remains the standard. The Benkeser reduction with lithium in ethylenediamine converts arenes to a mixture of cyclohexenes and cyclohexanes; this is operationally easier than the Birch reduction but does not afford 1,4-cyclohexadienes. Here, we report a Birch reduction promoted by lithium and ethylenediamine (or analogs) in tetrahydrofuran at ambient temperature. Our method is easy to set up, inexpensive, scalable, rapid, accessible to any chemical laboratory, and capable of reducing both electron-rich and electron-deficient substrates. Our protocol is also compatible with organocuprate chemistry for further functionalization."

The pristine lattice of monolayer graphene and hexagonal boron nitride, although impermeable to helium atoms, allows for transmission of electrons and permits transport of thermal protons and its isotopes. We discuss advances in selective subatomic species transport through atomically thin membranes and their potential for transformative advances in energy storage and conversion, isotope separations, in situ electron microscopy and spectroscopy, and future electronic applications. We outline technological challenges and opportunities for these applications and discuss early adoption in imaging and spectroscopy that are starting to become commercially available, as well as emerging applications in the nuclear industry and future application potential in grid storage, clean/green transportation, environmental remediation, and others."
https://openalex.org/W3210456590,"During development, neural circuit formation requires the stabilization of active γ-aminobutyric acid–mediated (GABAergic) synapses and the elimination of inactive ones. Here, we demonstrate that, although the activation of postsynaptic GABA type A receptors (GABAARs) and adenosine A2A receptors (A2ARs) stabilizes GABAergic synapses, only A2AR activation is sufficient. Both GABAAR- and A2AR-dependent signaling pathways act synergistically to produce adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate through the recruitment of the calcium–calmodulin–adenylyl cyclase pathway. Protein kinase A, thus activated, phosphorylates gephyrin on serine residue 303, which is required for GABAAR stabilization. Finally, the stabilization of pre- and postsynaptic GABAergic elements involves the interaction between gephyrin and the synaptogenic membrane protein Slitrk3. We propose that A2ARs act as detectors of active GABAergic synapses releasing GABA, adenosine triphosphate, and adenosine to regulate their fate toward stabilization or elimination."
https://openalex.org/W3211224315,"A strategy that facilitates the construction of a wide variety of trisubstituted stereocenters through a catalytically accessed common chiral intermediate could prove highly enabling for the field of synthetic chemistry. We report the discovery of enantioselective, catalytic 1,2-boronate rearrangements for the synthesis of α-chloro pinacol boronic esters from readily available boronic esters and dichloromethane. The chiral building blocks produced in these reactions can undergo two sequential stereospecific elaborations to generate a wide assortment of trisubstituted stereocenters. The enantioselective reaction is catalyzed by a lithium-isothiourea-boronate complex, which is proposed to promote rearrangement through a dual–lithium-induced chloride abstraction orchestrated by Lewis basic functionality on the catalyst scaffold."
https://openalex.org/W3210495999,"Assembly-line polyketide synthases, such as the 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase (DEBS), are large enzyme factories prized for their ability to produce specific and complex polyketide products. By channeling protein-tethered substrates across multiple active sites in a defined linear sequence, these enzymes facilitate programmed small-molecule syntheses that could theoretically be harnessed to access countless polyketide product structures. Using cryogenic electron microscopy to study DEBS module 1, we present a structural model describing this substrate-channeling phenomenon. Our 3.2- to 4.3-angstrom-resolution structures of the intact module reveal key domain-domain interfaces and highlight an unexpected module asymmetry. We also present the structure of a product-bound module that shines light on a recently described “turnstile” mechanism for transient gating of active sites along the assembly line."
https://openalex.org/W3210665796,"A diverse group of antimicrobial proteins (AMPs) helps protect the mammalian intestine from varied microbial challenges. We show that small proline-rich protein 2A (SPRR2A) is an intestinal antibacterial protein that is phylogenetically unrelated to previously discovered mammalian AMPs. In this study, SPRR2A was expressed in Paneth cells and goblet cells and selectively killed Gram-positive bacteria by disrupting their membranes. SPRR2A shaped intestinal microbiota composition, restricted bacterial association with the intestinal surface, and protected against Listeria monocytogenes infection. SPRR2A differed from other intestinal AMPs in that it was induced by type 2 cytokines produced during helminth infection. Moreover, SPRR2A protected against helminth-induced bacterial invasion of intestinal tissue. Thus, SPRR2A is a distinctive AMP triggered by type 2 immunity that protects the intestinal barrier during helminth infection."
https://openalex.org/W3211302022,"Type I modular polyketide synthases are homodimeric multidomain assembly line enzymes that synthesize a variety of polyketide natural products by performing polyketide chain extension and β-keto group modification reactions. We determined the 2.4-angstrom-resolution x-ray crystal structure and the 3.1-angstrom-resolution cryo–electron microscopy structure of the Lsd14 polyketide synthase, stalled at the transacylation and condensation steps, respectively. These structures revealed how the constituent domains are positioned relative to each other, how they rearrange depending on the step in the reaction cycle, and the specific interactions formed between the domains. Like the evolutionarily related mammalian fatty acid synthase, Lsd14 contains two reaction chambers, but only one chamber in Lsd14 has the full complement of catalytic domains, indicating that only one chamber produces the polyketide product at any given time."
https://openalex.org/W3208387474,"Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is an increasingly important tool for surveying biodiversity in marine ecosystems. However, the scale of temporal and spatial variability in eDNA signatures, and how this variation may impact eDNA-based marine biodiversity assessments, remains uncertain. To address this question, we systematically examined variation in vertebrate eDNA signatures across depth (0 m to 10 m) and horizontal space (nearshore kelp forest and surf zone) over three successive days in Southern California. Across a broad range of teleost fish and elasmobranchs, results showed significant variation in species richness and community assemblages between surface and depth, reflecting microhabitat depth preferences of common Southern California nearshore rocky reef taxa. Community assemblages between nearshore and surf zone sampling stations at the same depth also differed significantly, consistent with known habitat preferences. Additionally, assemblages also varied across three sampling days, but 69% of habitat preferences remained consistent. Results highlight the sensitivity of eDNA in capturing fine-scale vertical, horizontal, and temporal variation in marine vertebrate communities, demonstrating the ability of eDNA to capture a highly localized snapshot of marine biodiversity in dynamic coastal environments."
https://openalex.org/W3209791879,"A surface-promoted sulfate-reducing ammonium oxidation reaction was discovered to spontaneously take place on common inorganic aerosol surfaces undergoing solvation. Several key intermediate species—including elemental sulfur (S0), bisulfide (HS−), nitrous acid (HONO), and aqueous ammonia [NH3(aq)]—were identified as reaction components associated with the solvation process. Depth profiles of relative species abundance showed the surface propensity of key species. The species assignments and depth profile features were supported by classical and first-principles molecular dynamics calculations, and a detailed mechanism was proposed to describe the processes that led to unexpected products during salt solvation. This discovery revealed chemistry that is distinctly linked to a solvating surface and has great potential to illuminate current puzzles within heterogeneous chemistry."
https://openalex.org/W3208759153,"To date, it remains challenging to selectively migrate a carbonyl oxygen within a given molecular scaffold, especially to an adjacent carbon. In this work, we describe a simple one- or two-pot protocol that transposes a ketone to the vicinal carbon. This approach first converts the ketone to the corresponding alkenyl triflate, which can then undergo the palladium- and norbornene-catalyzed regioselective α-amination and ipso-hydrogenation enabled by a bifunctional hydrogen and nitrogen donor. The resulting “transposed enamine” intermediate can subsequently be hydrolyzed to produce the 1,2-carbonyl–migrated product. This method allows rapid access to unusual bioactive analogs through late-stage functionalization."
https://openalex.org/W3209283859,"Radiocarbon (14C), as a consequence of its production in the atmosphere and subsequent dispersal through the carbon cycle, is a key tracer for studying the Earth system. Knowledge of past 14C levels improves our understanding of climate processes, the Sun, the geodynamo, and the carbon cycle. Recently updated radiocarbon calibration curves (IntCal20, SHCal20, and Marine20) provide unprecedented accuracy in our estimates of 14C levels back to the limit of the 14C technique (~55,000 years ago). Such improved detail creates new opportunities to probe the Earth and climate system more reliably and at finer scale. We summarize the advances that have underpinned this revised set of radiocarbon calibration curves, survey the broad scientific landscape where additional detail on past 14C provides insight, and identify open challenges for the future."
https://openalex.org/W3211239622,"Background The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to a mental health crisis on a global scale. Epidemiological studies have reported a drastic increase in mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, increased loneliness and feelings of disconnectedness from others, while resilience levels have been negatively affected, indicating an urgent need for intervention. The current study is embedded within the larger CovSocial project which sought to evaluate longitudinal changes in vulnerability, resilience and social cohesion during the pandemic. The current second phase will investigate the efficacy of brief online mental training interventions in reducing mental health problems, and enhancing psychological resilience and social capacities. It further provides a unique opportunity for the prediction of intervention effects by individual biopsychosocial characteristics and preceding longitudinal change patterns during the pandemic in 2020/21. Methods We will examine the differential effects of a socio-emotional (including ‘Affect Dyad’) and a mindfulness-based (including ‘Breathing Meditation’) intervention, delivered through a web- and cellphone application. Participants will undergo 10 weeks of intervention, and will be compared to a retest control group. The effectiveness of the interventions will be evaluated in a community sample ( N = 300), which is recruited from the original longitudinal CovSocial sample. The pre- to post-intervention changes, potential underlying mechanisms, and prediction thereof, will be assessed on a wide range of outcomes: levels of stress, loneliness, depression and anxiety, resilience, prosocial behavior, empathy, compassion, and the impact on neuroendocrine, immunological and epigenetic markers. The multi-method nature of the study will incorporate self-report questionnaires, behavioral tasks, ecological momentary assessment (EMA) approaches, and biological, hormonal and epigenetic markers assessed in saliva. Discussion Results will reveal the differential effectiveness of two brief online interventions in improving mental health outcomes, as well as enhancing social capacities and resilience. The present study will serve as a first step for future application of scalable, low-cost interventions at a broader level to reduce stress and loneliness, improve mental health and build resilience and social capacities in the face of global stressors. Trial registration This trial has been registered on May 17, 2020 with the ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04889508 registration number (clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/ NCT04889508 )."

Differences between hospital-acquired (HA-AKI) and community-acquired AKI (CA-AKI) are not well established.Prospective, observational cohort study. We included 877 patients hospitalized with COVID diagnosis at two third-level hospitals in Mexico. Primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 28 days compared between COVID patients with CA-AKI and HA-AKI. Secondary outcomes included the need for KRT, and risk factors associated with the development of CA-AKI and HA-AKI.A total of 377 patients (33.7%) developed AKI. CA-AKI occurred in 202 patients (59.9%) and HA-AKI occurred in 135 (40.1%). Patients with CA-AKI had more significant comorbidities, including diabetes (52.4% vs 38.5%), hypertension (58.4% vs 39.2%), CKD (30.1% vs 14.8%), and COPD (5.9% vs 1.4%), than those with HA-AKI. Patients' survival without AKI was 87.1%, with CA-AKI it was 75.4%, and with HA-AKI it was 69.6%, log-rank test p < 0.001. Only age > 60 years (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.06-1.18, p <0.001), COVID severity (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.03-1.16, p = 0.002), the need in mechanical lung ventilation (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.56-1.78, p <0.001), and HA-AKI stage 3 (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.05-1.29, p = 0.003) had a significant increase in mortality. The presence of CKD (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.391.56, p < 0.001), serum lymphocytes < 1000 μL (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.00-1.07, p = 0.03), the need in mechanical lung ventilation (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02-1.11, p = 0.003), and CA-AKI stage 3 (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.29-1.46, p < 0.001) were the only variables associated with a KRT start.We found that COVID patients who are complicated by CA-AKI have more comorbidities and worse biochemical parameters at the time of hospitalization than HA-AKI patients, but despite these differences, their probability of dying is similar."

However, the role of IDO-1 in brain immunity, especially in the meninges, is unclear. We aim to elucidate the distribution pattern of IDO-1+ macrophages/microglia in the human brain tissues, human glioblastoma, APP/PS1 mouse brains, and quinolinic acid model brains and explore the physiological and immunological roles of IDO-1+ macrophages/microglia. Here, we find that both human and mouse macrophages/microglia of the perivascular and subarachnoid space and in glioblastoma (GBM) expressed IDO-1 but not macrophages/microglia of parenchyma. Using IDO-1 inhibitors including 1-MT and INCB24360, we observed that inhibiting IDO-1 reduced the cellular size and filopodia growth, fluid uptake, and the macropinocytic and phagocytic abilities of human blood monocytes and RAW264.7/BV-2 cells. Inhibiting IDO-1 with 1-MT or INCB24360 increased IL-1β secretion and suppressed NLRP3 expression in RAW264.7/BV-2 cells. Our data collectively show that IDO-1 expression in perivascular and meninges macrophages/microglia increases cellular phagocytic capacity and might suppress overactivation of inflammatory reaction."
https://openalex.org/W3167744789,"Overnight consolidation processes are thought to operate in a selective manner, such that important (i.e. future-relevant) memories are strengthened ahead of irrelevant information. Using an online protocol, we sought to replicate the seminal finding that the memory benefits of sleep are enhanced when people expect a future test [Wilhelm et al., 2011]. Participants memorised verbal paired associates to a criterion of 60 percent (Experiment 1) or 40 percent correct (Experiment 2) before a 12-hour delay containing overnight sleep (sleep group) or daytime wakefulness (wake group). Critically, half of the participants were informed that they would be tested again the following day, whereas the other half were told that they would carry out a different set of tasks. We observed a robust memory benefit of overnight consolidation, with the sleep group outperforming the wake group in both experiments. However, knowledge of an upcoming test had no impact on sleep-associated consolidation in either experiment, suggesting that overnight memory processes were not enhanced for future-relevant information. These findings, together with other failed replication attempts, show that sleep does not provide selective support to memories that are deemed relevant for the future."

Though some Mantodea mitogenomes have been reported, an evolutionary genomic and phylogenetic analysis study lacks the latest taxonomic system. In the present study, four new mitogenomes were sequenced and annotated. Deroplatys truncate, D. lobate, Amorphoscelis chinensis and Macromantis sp. belong to Deroplatyidae, Amorphoscelidae and Photinaidae family, respectively. Our results indicated that the ATP8 gene may be lost in D. truncate and D. lobata mt genome, and four tRNA genes have not been found in D. truncate, D. lobata and Macromantis sp. A dN/dS pair analysis was conducted and it was found that all genes have evolved under purifying selection. Furthermore, we tested the phylogenetic relationships between the eight families of the Mantodea, including 35 species of praying Mantis. Based on the complete mitochondrial genome data, it was also suggested as sister to Deroplatyidae + Mantidae, Metallyticus sp., the only representative of Metallyticidae, is sister to the remaining mantises. Our results support the taxonomic system of Schwarz and Roy and are consistent with previous studies."
https://openalex.org/W3210545077,"Cementum, the tissue attaching mammal tooth roots to the periodontal ligament, grows appositionally throughout life, displaying a series of circum-annual incremental features. These have been studied for decades as a direct record of chronological lifespan. The majority of previous studies on cementum have used traditional thin-section histological methods to image and analyse increments. However, several caveats have been raised in terms of studying cementum increments in thin-sections. Firstly, the limited number of thin-sections and the two-dimensional perspective they impart provide an incomplete interpretation of cementum structure, and studies often struggle or fail to overcome complications in increment patterns that complicate or inhibit increment counting. Increments have been repeatedly shown to both split and coalesce, creating accessory increments that can bias increment counts. Secondly, identification and counting of cementum increments using human vision is subjective, and it has led to inaccurate readings in several experiments studying individuals of known age. Here, we have attempted to optimise a recently introduced imaging modality for cementum imaging; X-ray propagation-based phase-contrast imaging (PPCI). X-ray PPCI was performed for a sample of rhesus macaque ( Macaca mulatta ) lower first molars (n = 10) from a laboratory population of known age. PPCI allowed the qualitative identification of primary/annual versus intermittent secondary increments formed by splitting/coalescence. A new method for semi-automatic increment counting was then integrated into a purpose-built software package for studying cementum increments, to count increments in regions with minimal complications. Qualitative comparison with data from conventional cementochronology, based on histological examination of tissue thin-sections, confirmed that X-ray PPCI reliably and non-destructively records cementum increments (given the appropriate preparation of specimens prior to X-ray imaging). Validation of the increment counting algorithm suggests that it is robust and provides accurate estimates of increment counts. In summary, we show that our new increment counting method has the potential to overcome caveats of conventional cementochronology approaches, when used to analyse three-dimensional images provided by X-ray PPCI."
https://openalex.org/W3208219880,"Groups with higher cognitive diversity, i.e. variations in how people think and solve problems, are thought to contribute to improved performance in complex problem-solving. However, embracing or even engineering adequate cognitive diversity is not straightforward and may even jeopardize social inclusion. In response, those that want to promote cognitive diversity might make a simplified assumption that there exists a link between identity diversity, i.e. range of social characteristics, and variations in how people perceive and solve problems. If this assumption holds true, incorporating diverse identities may concurrently achieve cognitive diversity to the extent essential for complex problem-solving, while social inclusion is explicitly acknowledged. However, currently there is a lack of empirical evidence to support this hypothesis in the context of complex social-ecological systems-a system wherein human and environmental dimensions are interdependent, where common-pool resources are used or managed by multiple types of stakeholders. Using a fisheries example, we examine the relationship between resource stakeholders' identities and their cognitive diversity. We used cognitive mapping techniques in conjunction with network analysis to measure cognitive distances within and between stakeholders of various social types (i.e., identities). Our results empirically show that groups with higher identity diversity also demonstrate more cognitive diversity, evidenced by disparate characteristics of their cognitive maps that represent their understanding of fishery dynamics. These findings have important implications for sustainable management of common-pool resources, where the inclusion of diverse stakeholders is routine, while our study shows it may also achieve higher cognitive coverage that can potentially lead to more complete, accurate, and innovative understanding of complex resource dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W3209698156,"Physical fitness is related to well-being and health. Adolescence is a key period in the psychological and social development of the person, in which interpersonal relationships gain strength, being bullying a type of violence that can affect the personality of those involved. At present, there is not enough research to determine the relationships between bullying and physical condition. The purpose of this study is to find out if there are any relationships among physical fitness, victimisation, and aggression in bullying, and to identify these behaviours. This is a descriptive study done in 1035 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years (M = 14.67, SD = 1.49). The European Bullying Intervention Project Questionnaire (EBIPQ) scale was used, and anthropometric characteristics of weight and height were measured. In addition, physical fitness tests from the Eurofit battery, sit-and-reach, 30-second sit-ups, horizontal jump, manual dynamometry, and 20-meter Multistage Shuttle Run Test (SRT) were included. The relationships between variables were analysed using Spearman correlations, linear regressions, and ordinal regressions. The most relevant findings indicate an inverse relationship between being a victim of bullying and having a better cardiorespiratory cardiovascular endurance. These also show a direct relationship between being a bully and skeletal muscle strength measured through the horizontal jump, 30-second sit-ups, and manual dynamometry tests. Theoretically, we can conclude that physical condition can be considered a predictor to consider in bullying. Specifically, cardiorespiratory fitness, in addition to its multiple physical and mental benefits, may be a protective element against bullying victimisation. In contrast, muscular strength, especially in boys, may be an important predictor, especially in the physical component, of aggression in bullying."
https://openalex.org/W3210034627,"Introduction Pregnancy and perinatal periods are significant risk factors of intimate partner violence (IPV), a major public health problem that could begin or intensify during these periods. Perinatal care providers have a major role in the identification and the management of IPV. This study aimed to cross-culturally adapt into French the Physician Readiness to Manage Intimate Partner Violence Survey (PREMIS) tool, a reliable instrument to assess the knowledge, attitudes and preparedness to address IPV, and to evaluate its psychometric properties. Methods The PREMIS was cross-culturally adapted by conducting forward and backward translations, following international guidelines. An online cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the psychometric properties of the PREMIS-French in perinatal care providers: data completeness, factor analysis, score distribution, floor and ceiling effects, internal consistency, item-total correlations, inter-subscale correlations and test-retest reliability. Results The PREMIS was successfully translated and cross-culturally adapted to the context of metropolitan France. The results obtained from 360 perinatal care providers showed good acceptability. Exploratory factor analysis of the “Opinions” items resulted in a six-factor solution with six of the eight subscales of the original structure identified. Good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha ranging from 0.54 to 0.97) and good test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients ranging from 0.46 to 0.92) for the “Background” and “Opinions” subscales were found. Discussion This study provides evidence of the good psychometric properties of the PREMIS-French. This valid instrument will help to understand perinatal care providers’ barriers to IPV screening and management and will help to focus on specific lacks of knowledge for developing IPV education programs."
https://openalex.org/W3211014900,"To minimize the intrinsic toxicity of the antibacterial agent hydrazinyloxadiazole 1, the hydrazine moiety was replaced with ethylenediamine (compound 7). This replacement generated a potent antifungal agent with no antibacterial activity. Notably, use of a 1,2-diaminocyclohexane moiety, as a conformationally-restricted isostere for ethylenediamine, potentiated the antifungal activity in both the cis and trans forms of N-(5-(2-([1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl)-4-methylthiazol-5-yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)cyclohexane-1,2-diamine (compounds 16 and 17). Both compounds 16 and 17 were void of any antibacterial activity; nonetheless, they showed equipotent antifungal activity in vitro to that of the most potent approved antifungal agent, amphotericin B. The promising antifungal effects of compounds 16 and 17 were maintained when assessed against an additional panel of 26 yeast and mold clinical isolates, including the Candida auris and C. krusei. Furthermore, compound 17 showed superior activity to amphotericin B in vitro against Candida glabrata and Cryptococcus gattii. Additionally, neither compound inhibited the normal human microbiota, and both possessed excellent safety profiles and were 16 times more tolerable than amphotericin B."

IBD patients are at higher risk of osteopenia, osteoporosis and fracture compared to non-IBD patients. The impact of IBD on the performance of orthopedic implants has not been well studied. We hypothesized that a history of IBD at the time of primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) would increase the risk of subsequent failure as assessed by revision surgery. A retrospective implant survival analysis was completed using the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty Registry and the Sweden National Patient Register. A total of 150,073 patients undergoing THA for osteoarthritis within an 18-year period were included in the study. THA patients with (n = 2,604) and without (n = 147,469) a history of IBD at the time of THA were compared with primary revision as the main endpoint and adjusted using sex, age category and comorbidity (Elixhauser scores) as covariates. We found that patients with a history of IBD had a relatively higher risk of revision surgery for septic causes while the non-IBD patients had a relatively higher risk of revision for aseptic causes (p = 0.004). Our findings suggest there may be an association between gut health and THA performance."

https://openalex.org/W3211227308,"Field pea (Pisum sativum L.), a cool-season legume crop, is known for poor heat tolerance. Our previous work identified PR11-2 and PR11-90 as heat tolerant and susceptible lines in a recombinant inbred population. CDC Amarillo, a Canadian elite pea variety, was considered as another heat tolerant variety based on its similar field performance as PR11-2. This study aimed to characterize the differential transcription. Plants of these three varieties were stressed for 3 h at 38°C prior to self-pollination, and RNAs from heat stressed anthers and stipules on the same flowering node were extracted and sequenced via the Illumina NovaSeq platform for the characterization of heat responsive genes. In silico results were further validated by qPCR assay. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified at log2 |fold change (FC)| ≥ 2 between high temperature and control temperature, the three varieties shared 588 DEGs which were up-regulated and 220 genes which were down-regulated in anthers when subjected to heat treatment. In stipules, 879 DEGs (463/416 upregulation/downregulation) were consistent among varieties. The above heat-induced genes of the two plant organs were related to several biological processes i.e., response to heat, protein folding and DNA templated transcription. Ten gene ontology (GO) terms were over-represented in the consistently down-regulated DEGs of the two organs, and these terms were mainly related to cell wall macromolecule metabolism, lipid transport, lipid localization, and lipid metabolic processes. GO enrichment analysis on distinct DEGs of individual pea varieties suggested that heat affected biological processes were dynamic, and variety distinct responses provide insight into molecular mechanisms of heat-tolerance response. Several biological processes, e.g., cellular response to DNA damage stimulus in stipule, electron transport chain in anther that were only observed in heat induced PR11-2 and CDC Amarillo, and their relevance to field pea heat tolerance is worth further validation."
https://openalex.org/W3209058364,"Ali-M3, an artificial intelligence program, analyzes chest computed tomography (CT) and detects the likelihood of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) based on scores ranging from 0 to 1. However, Ali-M3 has not been externally validated. Our aim was to evaluate the accuracy of Ali-M3 for detecting COVID-19 and discuss its clinical value. We evaluated the external validity of Ali-M3 using sequential Japanese sampling data. In this retrospective cohort study, COVID-19 infection probabilities for 617 symptomatic patients were determined using Ali-M3. In 11 Japanese tertiary care facilities, these patients underwent reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. They also underwent chest CT to confirm a diagnosis of COVID-19. Of the 617 patients, 289 (46.8%) were RT-PCR-positive. The area under the curve (AUC) of Ali-M3 for predicting a COVID-19 diagnosis was 0.797 (95% confidence interval: 0.762‒0.833) and the goodness-of-fit was P = 0.156. With a cut-off probability of a diagnosis of COVID-19 by Ali-M3 set at 0.5, the sensitivity and specificity were 80.6% and 68.3%, respectively. A cut-off of 0.2 yielded a sensitivity and specificity of 89.2% and 43.2%, respectively. Among the 223 patients who required oxygen, the AUC was 0.825. Sensitivity at a cut-off of 0.5% and 0.2% was 88.7% and 97.9%, respectively. Although the sensitivity was lower when the days from symptom onset were fewer, the sensitivity increased for both cut-off values after 5 days. We evaluated Ali-M3 using external validation with symptomatic patient data from Japanese tertiary care facilities. As Ali-M3 showed sufficient sensitivity performance, despite a lower specificity performance, Ali-M3 could be useful in excluding a diagnosis of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3209299660,"The aim of this research project was to validate the work-related version of the Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction and Frustration Scale (BPNSFS) into the Polish language and culture. Although studies have demonstrated the benefits associated with basic psychological need satisfaction and the costs associated with need frustration at work, the concept of needs has been neglected both in Polish scientific research and in practical organizational studies. The adaptation of the BPNSFS-Work Domain may change this situation and stimulate research in the Polish community. The scale has been validated in a sample consisting of three occupational groups: healthcare workers, education staff and customer service workers ( N = 1315, M age = 43.8). The findings suggest that the Polish scale has robust psychometric features. The CFA analysis proves that the scale has a six-dimensional structure similar to the original scale. These dimensions show satisfactory to high Cronbach’s α and McDonalds ω reliability, and high criterion validity is shown by association of the six need dimensions with correlates of both positive (i.e., engagement, job crafting and self-efficacy) and negative aspects of work (i.e., burnout and stress). The structure of the scale is the same in all three occupational groups, although the regression weights and covariances are only partially invariant. The validated version of the BPNSFS-Work Domain can be used in future basic and applied studies in the paradigm of self-determination theory."
https://openalex.org/W3209545333,"As in many parts of the world, the management of environmental science research in Antarctica relies on cost-benefit analysis of negative environmental impact versus positive scientific gain. Several studies have examined the environmental impact of Antarctic field camps, but very little work looks at how the placement of these camps influences scientific research. In this study, we integrate bibliometrics, geospatial analysis, and historical research to understand the relationship between field camp placement and scientific production in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of East Antarctica. Our analysis of the scientific corpus from 1907-2016 shows that, on average, research sites have become less dispersed and closer to field camps over time. Scientific output does not necessarily correspond to the number of field camps, and constructing a field camp does not always lead to a subsequent increase in research in the local area. Our results underscore the need to consider the complex historical and spatial relationships between field camps and research sites in environmental management decision-making in Antarctica and other protected areas."
https://openalex.org/W3210973498,"Environmental laws need sound data to protect species and ecosystems. In 1996, a proliferation of mountaintop removal coal mines in a region home to over 50 federally protected species was approved under the Endangered Species Act. Although this type of mining can degrade terrestrial and aquatic habitats, the available data and tools limited the ability to analyze spatially extensive, aggregate effects of such a program. We used two large, public datasets to quantify the relationship between mountaintop removal coal mining and water quality measures important to the survival of imperiled species at a landscape scale across Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. We combined an annual map of the extent of surface mines in this region from 1985 to 2015 generated from Landsat satellite imagery with public water quality data collected over the same time period from 4,260 monitoring stations within the same area. The water quality data show that chronic and acute thresholds for levels of aluminum, arsenic, cadmium, conductivity, copper, lead, manganese, mercury, pH, selenium, and zinc safe for aquatic life were exceeded thousands of times between 1985 and 2015 in streams that are important to the survival and recovery of species on the Endangered Species List. Linear mixed models showed that levels of manganese, sulfate, sulfur, total dissolved solids, total suspended solids, and zinc increased by 6.73E+01 to 6.87E+05 μg/L and conductivity by 3.30E+06 μS /cm for one percent increase in the mined proportion of the area draining into a monitoring station. The proportion of a drainage area that was mined also increased the likelihood that chronic thresholds for copper, lead, and zinc required to sustain aquatic life were exceeded. Finally, the proportion of a watershed that was mined was positively related to the likelihood that a waterway would be designated as impaired under the Clean Water Act. Together these results demonstrate that the extent of mountaintop removal mining, which can be derived from public satellite data, is predictive of water quality measures important to imperiled species-effects that must be considered under environmental law. These findings and the public data used in our analyses are pertinent to ongoing re-evaluations of the effects of current mine permitting regulations to the recovery and survival of federally protected species."
https://openalex.org/W3208487204,"Deltamethrin is a widely used insecticide that kills a wide variety of insects and ticks. Deltamethrin resistance develops as a result of intensive, repeated use, as well as increased environmental contamination and a negative impact on public health. Its negative impact on aquatic ecology and human health necessitated the development of a new technique for environmental remediation and wastewater treatment, such as the use of nanotechnology. The co-precipitation method was used to create Zn-Fe/LDH, Zn-AL-GA/LDH, and Fe-oxide nanoparticles (NPs), which were then characterized using XRD, FT-IR, FE-SEM, and HR-TEM. The kinetic study of adsorption test revealed that these NPs were effective at removing deltamethrin from wastewater. The larval packet test, which involved applying freshly adsorbed deltamethrin nanocomposites (48 hours after adsorption), and the comet assay test were used to confirm that deltamethrin had lost its acaricidal efficacy. The kinetics of the deltamethrin adsorption process was investigated using several kinetic models at pH 7, initial concentration of deltamethrin 40 ppm and temperature 25°C. Within the first 60 min, the results indicated efficient adsorption performance in deltamethrin removal, the maximum adsorption capacity was 27.56 mg/L, 17.60 mg/L, and 3.06 mg/L with the Zn-Al LDH/GA, Zn-Fe LDH, and Fe Oxide, respectively. On tick larvae, the results of the freshly adsorbed DNC bioassay revealed larval mortality. This suggests that deltamethrin's acaricidal activity is still active. However, applying DNCs to tick larvae 48 hours after adsorption had no lethal effect, indicating that deltamethrin had lost its acaricidal activity. The latter result corroborated the results of the adsorption test's kinetic study. Furthermore, the comet assay revealed that commercial deltamethrin caused 28.51% DNA damage in tick cells, which was significantly higher than any DNC. In conclusion, the NPs used play an important role in deltamethrin decontamination in water, resulting in reduced public health risk. As a result, these NPs could be used as a method of environmental remediation."
https://openalex.org/W3209044457,"The default mode network (DMN), the salience network (SN), and the central executive network (CEN) are considered as the core resting-state brain networks (RSN) due to their involvement in a wide range of cognitive tasks. Despite the large body of knowledge related to their regional spontaneous activity (RSA) and functional connectivity (FC) of these networks, less is known about the dynamics of the task-associated modulation on these parameters and the task-induced interaction between these three networks. We have investigated the effects of the visual-oddball paradigm on three fMRI measures (amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations for RSA, regional homogeneity for local FC, and degree centrality for global FC) in these three core RSN. A rest-task-rest paradigm was used and the RSNs were identified using independent component analysis (ICA) on the resting-state data. The observed patterns of change differed noticeably between the networks and were tightly associated with the task-related brain activity and the distinct involvement of the networks in the performance of the single subtasks. Furthermore, the inter-network analysis showed an increased synchronization of CEN with the DMN and the SN immediately after the task, but not between the DMN and SN. Higher pre-task inter-network synchronization between the DMN and the CEN was associated with shorter reaction times and thus better performance. Our results provide some additional insights into the dynamics within and between the triple RSN. Further investigations are required in order to understand better their functional importance and interplay."
https://openalex.org/W3210108418,"On-call research and guidance materials typically focus on 'traditional' on-call work (e.g., emergency services, healthcare). However, given the increasing prevalence of non-standard employment arrangements (e.g., gig work and casualisation), it is likely that a proportion of individuals who describe themselves as being on-call are not included in current on-call literature. This study therefore aimed to describe the current sociodemographic and work characteristics of Australian on-call workers.A survey of 2044 adults assessed sociodemographic and work arrangements. Of this population, 1057 individuals were workforce participants, who were asked to provide information regarding any on-call work they performed over the last three months, occupation type, weekly work hours, and the presence or absence of non-standard work conditions.Of respondents who were working, 45.5% reported working at least one day on-call in the previous month. There was a high prevalence of on-call work in younger respondents (63.1% of participants aged 18-24 years), and those who worked multiple jobs and more weekly work hours. Additionally, high prevalence rates of on-call work were reported by machinery operators, drivers, community and personal service workers, sales workers, and high-level managers.These data suggest that on-call work is more prevalent than previously recorded and is likely to refer to a broad set of employment arrangements. Current classification systems may therefore be inadequate for population-level research. A taxonomy for the classification of on-call work is proposed, incorporating traditional on-call work, gig economy work, relief, or unscheduled work, and out of hours work."
https://openalex.org/W3211063714,"In this study, the complete mitogenome of Lysmata vittata (Crustacea: Decapoda: Hippolytidae) has been determined. The genome sequence was 22003 base pairs (bp) and it included thirteen protein-coding genes (PCGs), twenty-two transfer RNA genes (tRNAs), two ribosomal RNA genes (rRNAs) and three putative control regions (CRs). The nucleotide composition of AT was 71.50%, with a slightly negative AT skewness (-0.04). Usually the standard start codon of the PCGs was ATN, while cox1, nad4L and cox3 began with TTG, TTG and GTG. The canonical termination codon was TAA, while nad5 and nad4 ended with incomplete stop codon T, and cox1 ended with TAG. The mitochondrial gene arrangement of eight species of the Hippolytidae were compared with the order of genes of Decapoda ancestors, finding that the gene arrangement order of the Lebbeus groenlandicus had not changed, but the gene arrangement order of other species changed to varying degrees. The positions of the two tRNAs genes (trnA and trnR) of the L. vittata had translocations, which also showed that the Hippolytidae species were relatively unconserved in evolution. Phylogenetic analysis of 50 shrimp showed that L. vittata formed a monophyletic clade with Lysmata/Exhippolysmata species. This study should be helpful to better understand the evolutionary status, and population genetic diversity of L. vittata and related species."
https://openalex.org/W3208093541,"The majority of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) patients are not sufficiently physically active post-surgery, yet little support from the Swedish healthcare system is offered. We investigated if a dissonance-based group intervention, aiming to increase health-related quality of life after surgery, had any effect on patients' physical activity two years post-RYGB.Women undergoing RYGB surgery were recruited from five Swedish hospitals and randomized to intervention or control group (standard post-surgery care). The dissonance-based intervention was conducted three months post-RYGB and consisted of four group sessions, each with a specific topic, of which one addressed physical activity. ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometers were used to measure physical activity at pre-RYGB, one- and two-years post-surgery.At pre-RYGB, 259 women were recruited and randomized (intervention n = 156 and control n = 103). Participants had a mean age of 44.7 years (SD 10.3) and pre-RYGB body mass index of 40.8 (SD 4.5) kg/m2. At two-years follow-up, 99 participants (63.5%) in intervention group and 68 (66.0%) in control group had valid accelerometer-measurements. Pre- to post-surgery increases were seen in all physical activity outcomes, but no statistically significant differences between the groups were observed at the two-years follow-up, and intervention effects were poor (d = 0.02-0.35).To our knowledge, this is the first dissonance-based intervention targeting women undergoing RYGB surgery. At two-years follow-up, we did not observe any differences in physical activity levels between the intervention group and control group. Trial registration number: ISRCTN16417174."

https://openalex.org/W3208422996,"Reverse engineering is a burning issue in Integrated Circuit (IC) design and manufacturing. In the semiconductor industry, it results in a revenue loss of billions of dollars every year. In this work, an area efficient, high-performance IC camouflaging technique is proposed at the physical design level to combat the integrated circuit's reverse engineering. An attacker may not identify various logic gates in the layout due to similar image output. In addition, a dummy or true contact-based technique is implemented for optimum outcomes. A library of gates is proposed that contains the various camouflaged primitive gates developed by a combination of using the metal routing technique along with the dummy contact technique. This work shows the superiority of the proposed technique's performance matrix with those of existing works regarding resource burden, area, and delay. The proposed library is expected to make open source to help ASIC designers secure IC design and save colossal revenue loss."

https://openalex.org/W3210701811,"The blind spot is a region in the temporal monocular visual field in humans, which corresponds to a physiological scotoma within the nasal hemi-retina. This region has no photoreceptors, so is insensitive to visual stimulation. There is no corresponding perceptual scotoma because the visual stimulation is ""filled-in"" by the visual system. Investigations of visual perception in and around the blind spot allow us to investigate this filling-in process. However, because the location and size of the blind spot are individually variable, experimenters must first map the blind spot in every observer. We present an open-source tool, which runs in Psychopy software, to estimate the location and size of the blind spot psychophysically. The tool will ideally be used with an Eyelink eye-tracker (SR Research), but it can also run in standalone mode. Here, we explain the rationale for the tool and demonstrate its validity in normally-sighted observers. We develop a detailed map of the blind spot in one observer. Then, in a group of 12 observers, we propose a more efficient, pragmatic method to define a ""safe zone"" within the blind spot, for which the experimenter can be fully confident that visual stimuli will not be seen. Links are provided to this open-source tool and a user manual."
