https://openalex.org/W2087557066,Encephalomyocarditis virus was isolated from the organs of swine dying during an outbreak of an acutely fatal disease occurring on a farm in Panama. The outstanding lesion was severe myocarditis. Pigs inoculated with the viral isolate developed a systemic infection with myocarditis.

https://openalex.org/W1915795894,"The phospholipide compositions of human serum lipoproteins have been determined on ultracentrifugally separated serum lipoprotein classes by silicic acid column chromatography and infrared spectrophotometry. The phospholipides were separated into a fraction containing phosphatidylethamolamine and phosphatidyl serine, a lecithin fraction, and a sphingomyelin fraction. All phospholipides are present in each lipoprotein class, but their distributions in each class are sufficiently different to be characteristic. Analyses were run on sera from five individuals and only small deviations from the average values were observed. In a few cases the fatty acids of the separated phospholipides were analyzed by gas chromatography. (auth)"

https://openalex.org/W2091534004,Series of triphenylmethane and xanthene dyes were found to be effective as inducers of respiration-deficient mutation in yeast. The quantitative difference in the mutagenic effect appeared to be in close relationship to the chemical structure of the respective dyes. This survey may provide a useful clue for elucidation of the mechanism of mutagenic induction.

https://openalex.org/W2028535524,"NORMAL human serum contains sufficient haptoglobin to bind approximately 130 mgm. of hæmoglobin per 100 ml. (ref. 1). A number of other mammalian species, including the rabbit, have much lower serum haptoglobin-levels2. In order to have available a plentiful source of rabbit haptoglobin a method was sought by which the normal serum level could be elevated. Observations on patients with various diseases suggested that tissue inflammation might provide a means to this end3. Accordingly, the effect of administering turpentine to rabbits was investigated."

https://openalex.org/W2064196146,"In the course of its life cycle the eastern newt, Triturus (Diemyctylus) viridescens, undergoes two metamorphoses, the first from the aquatic larva to the terrestrial red eft; the second, 2 to 3 years later, from the eft to the permanently aquatic and sexually mature adult newt. The pattern of nitrogen exretion changes during both transformations. Older larvae excrete about 75 percent of the nitrogen as ammonia, 25 percent as urea; during the first metamorphosis the ratio of ammonia to urea is about 57:43; completely transformed efts excrete 87 percent of the nitrogen as urea. Adult aquatic newts show a partial return to the larval pattern, with an increase in the proportion of ammonia from the 13 percent typical for the eft to 26 percent, a highly significant difference."

https://openalex.org/W2046156637,"Small quantities of Zn 65 have been found in a wide variety of foods obtained from the local markets serving Cincinnati, Ohio. The highest levels of radioactivity were observed in oysters harvested from Chesapeake Bay; however, none of the samples contained significant quantities of this radionuclide in terms of a potential radiological health hazard. In view of the widespread occurrence of Zn 65 in foods, it has been postulated that this radionuclide has been dispersed by high-altitude fallout."

https://openalex.org/W2012287504,"BEMEGRIDE (β-ethyl β-methyl glutarimide), labelled with carbon-14 in both the α positions, is excreted largely in the urine and to a lesser extent in the bile and fæces when administered to mice, rats and guinea pigs1. Chromatograms of urine and bile from these animals were developed by the ascending technique using n-butanol/acetic acid/water (12: 3: 5, v/v). Autoradiographs of chromatograms of guinea pig bile showed only one spot (R F 0.88) which was identical in mobility to the control-labelled bemegride. The urine of rats, collected 15–120 min. after administration of labelled bemegride, revealed two spots of R F values 0.88–0.89 and 0.77–0.81. The faster moving fraction moved as one spot when labelled bemegride was added to the urine before chromatography. The spot with the lower mobility increased in intensity over the 15–120 min. period of urine collection. Urine from mice, 15–120 min. after bemegride injection, showed two spots with R F values similar to those of rat urine, while urine collected 8 hr. after injection revealed a third spot of R F 0.40–0.46. This spot became progressively more intense and the faster moving fractions correspondingly less up to 24 hr."
