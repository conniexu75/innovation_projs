https://openalex.org/W2027329006,"Pneumococcal disease is a major cause of childhood death. Almost a third of the world's children live in Southeast Asia, but there are few data from the region on pneumococcal colonization or disease. Our aim was to document the dynamics of pneumococcal carriage in a rural SE Asian birth cohort.We studied 234 Karen mother-infant pairs in Northwestern Thailand. Infants were followed from birth and nasopharyngeal swabs were taken from mother and infant at monthly intervals until 24 months old.8,386 swabs were cultured and 4,396 pneumococci characterized. Infants became colonized early (median 45.5 days; 95% confidence interval [CI] 44.5-46.0) and by 24 months had a median of seven (range 0-15) carriage episodes. Maternal smoking and young children in the house were associated with earlier colonization (hazard ratio [HR] 1.5 (95% CI 1.1-2.1) and 1.4 (95% CI 1.0-1.9)). For the four commonest serotypes and non-typeable pneumococci, previous exposure to homologous or heterologous serotypes resulted in an extended interval to reacquisition of the same serotype. Previous colonization by serotypes 14 and 19F was also associated with reduced carriage duration if subsequently reacquired (HR [first reacquisition] 4.1 (95% CI 1.4-12.6) and 2.6 (1.5-4.7)). Mothers acquired pneumococci less frequently, and carried them for shorter periods, than infants (acquisition rate 0.5 vs. 1.1 /100 person-days, p<0.001; median duration 31.0 vs. 60.5 days, p = 0.001). 55.8% of pneumococci from infants were vaccine serotypes (13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, PCV13), compared with 27.5% from mothers (p<0.001). Non-typeable pneumococcal carriage was common, being carried at least once by 55.1% of infants and 32.0% of mothers.Pneumococcal carriage frequency and duration are influenced by previous exposure to both homologous and heterologous serotypes. These data will inform vaccination strategies in this population."

Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a member of a subfamily of fibroblasts growth factors (FGFs) (with includes FGF15/19 and FGF23) that lacks the FGF heparin binding domain (1.Nishimura T.

Previous evidence indicates that, in mammals, fasting induces the expression of FGF21 in the liver and raises its circulating levels; increased FGF21 expression and activity modulates metabolic adaptation to fasting by inducing increased gluconeogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, and ketogenesis (3.Inagaki T.

Additional evidence also indicates that transgenic mice overexpressing FGF21 are significantly smaller, have reduced tibial length, and display reduced hepatic GH insensitivity when compared with wild-type mice (7.Inagaki T.

The aim of our study was to determine whether during prolonged undernutrition FGF21 may also inhibit bone growth by directly suppressing chondrogenesis and GH action at the growth plate. FGF receptor growth hormone recombinant mouse GH GH receptor recombinant human FGF21. The cartilaginous portions of metatarsal bones isolated from C57BL/6N mouse embryos (19 days post-coitus) were dissected, rinsed in PBS, then incubated in 0.2% trypsin for 1 h and 0.2% collagenase for 3 h. Cell suspension was aspirated repeatedly and filtered through a 70-μm cell strainer, rinsed first in PBS then in serum-free DMEM, and counted. Chondrocytes were seeded in 100-mm dishes at a density of 5 × 104/cm2 in DMEM with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid, and 10% FBS. The culture medium was changed at 72-h intervals. Upon confluence, cells were subcultured, and their chondrogenic phenotype was confirmed by studying the expression of type-I collagen, type-II collagen, and type X collagen by immunocytochemistry. In our culture conditions the percentage of cells expressing type-I, type-II, and type-X collagen was 3.9, 97.1, and 22.0%, respectively. Subsets of cells with confirmed chondrogenic phenotype (with at least 95% of the cells positive for type II collagen and negative for type I collagen) were treated without or with graded concentrations of rhFGF21 (0.01, 0.1, 1, 5, and 10 μg/ml, recombinant human, Lilly Research Laboratories) up to 14 days. In another series of experiments, cells were first cultured for 24 h without or with graded concentrations of rhFGF21 (0.01, 0.1, 1, 5, and 10μg/ml). After 24 h, culture medium containing FGF21 was removed and replaced with fresh serum-free DMEM without or with recombinant mouse growth hormone (rmGH; 10 ng/ml, National Hormone and Peptide Program, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, CA). To assess cell proliferation, we measured [3H]thymidine incorporation into newly synthesized DNA. At the indicated time points during the culture period, 2.5 μCi of [3H]thymidine/well (25 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) was added to the culture medium for an additional 3 h. Cells were released by trypsin and collected onto glass fiber filters. Incorporation of [3H]thymidine was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The data represent percentage of control from three independent experiments. Whole cell lysates were solubilized with 1% SDS sample buffer and electrophoresed on a 4–15% SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad). Proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with the following primary antibodies: rabbit polyclonal against p-ERK 1/2 and ERK 1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), mouse beta Klotho Affinity-purified polyclonal antibody (R&D Systems Inc. Minneapolis, MN), goat polyclonal antibody against FGFR1 (Santa Cruz), mouse monoclonal antibody against FGFR3 (Santa Cruz), rabbit polyclonal antibody against GH receptor (GHR) (Santa Cruz), and rabbit polyclonal antibody against β-actin (Sigma). The blots were developed using a horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal donkey-anti rabbit or mouse IgG antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence system (GE Healthcare). Quantitation of exposed x-ray films was performed with Image-J software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda MD). Total RNA was extracted from the 3-week-old mouse liver and tibial growth plates and from cultured chondrocytes isolated from fetal (20 days post-coitus) mouse metatarsal growth plates using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia CA). The recovered RNA was further processed using the 1st Strand cDNA synthesis kit for RT-PCR avian myeloblastosis virus (Roche Applied Science) to produce cDNA. 1 μg of total RNA and 1.6 μg of oligo-p(dT)15 primer were incubated for 10 min at 25 °C followed by incubation for 60 min at 42 °C in the presence of 20 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase and 50 units of RNase inhibitor in a total 20-μl reaction. The cDNA products were directly used for PCR or stored at −80 °C for later analysis. Real-time quantitative PCR was carried out using the StepOne real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in a final volume of 25 μl containing 1 μl of cDNA, 12.5 μl of 2× SYBR Green master mix (Applied Biosystems), 0.1 μm primers (Applied Biosystems) in DNase-free water. Primers used were: mouse β-actin, 5′-TGT GAT GGT GGG AAT GGG TCA GAA-3′ and 5′-TGT GGT GCC AGA TCT TCT CCA TGT-3′ (PCR fragment 140 bp); mouse FGF21, 5′-AAC AGC CAT TCA CTT TGC CTG AGC-3′ and 5′-GGC AGC TGG AAT TGT GTT CTG ACT-3′ (PCR fragment 85 bp); mouse Collagen X, 5′-ATA AGA ACG GCA CGC CTA CGA TGT-3′ and 5′-CTG CAT TGG GCA ATT GGA GCC ATA-3′ (PCR fragment 128bp); FGFR1, 5′-CCA GTG CAT CCA TGA ACT CTG GGG TTC TCC-3′, 5′-GGT CAC ACG GTT GGG TTT GTC CTT ATC CAG-3′ (PCR fragment 230 bp); FGFR3, 5′-AGT GCT AAA TGC CTC CCA CGA AGA-3′, 5′-AGG ATG GAG CAT CTG TTA CAC GCA-3′(PCR fragment 107 bp); β-klotho, 5′-CTG GCT AAG GTT CAA GTA CGG AGA CCT CCC-3′ and 5′-GGA GCT GAG CGA TCA CTA AGT GAA TAC GCA-3′ (PCR fragment 198 bp); GHR, 5′-AGC CTC GAT TCA CCA AGT GTC GTT-3′ and 5′-CAG CTT GTC GTT GGC TTT CCC TTT-3′ (PCR fragment 138 bp); ERK 1, 5′-TCA ACC CAA ACA AGC GCA TCA CAG-3′ and 5′-TCC AGC TCC ATG TCG AAG GTG AAT-3′ (PCR fragment 121 bp); IGF-1, 5′-TGA GCT GGT GGA TGC TCT TCA GTT-3′ and 5′-TCA TCC ACA ATG CCT GTC TGA GGT-3′ (PCR fragment 114 bp). The real time PCR conditions were: 50 °C for 2 min followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Values were quantified using the comparative cycle threshold (CT) method (14.Schmittgen T.D. Livak K.J. Analyzing real-time PCR data by the comparative C(T) method.Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (17278) Google Scholar), and samples were normalized to β-actin. Chondrocytes were transfected with pools of siRNAs targeted for IGF-1 (sc-37194, Santa Cruz), IGF-1R (sc-35638, Santa Cruz), ERK 1 (sc-29308, Santa Cruz), or for FGFR1 (sc-29317, Santa Cruz). A pool of siRNAs consisting of scrambled sequences was similarly transfected as control siRNA (Santa Cruz) and introduced into cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. One day before transfection, cells were plated in 500 μl of growth medium without antibiotics such that they were 30–50% confluent at the time of transfection. The transfected cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FCS for 72 h after transfection. To validate siRNA-mediated inhibition of the target(s) expression, we analyzed the mRNA expression by real-time PCR. In the cells co-transfected with IGF-1 siRNAs and IGF-1R siRNAs, IGF-1 mRNA and IGF-1R mRNA were markedly reduced (13 and 20% of those measured in control siRNA-transfected cells, respectively). In cells transfected with ERK 1 siRNA or FGFR1 siRNA, the ERK 1 mRNA and FGFR1 mRNA were also significantly reduced (35 and 31% of those measured in control siRNA-transfected cells, respectively). Once reached 70–80% confluence, chondrocytes were washed with serum-free medium and treated for 24 h without or with graded concentrations of rhFGF21 (0.01, 0.1, 1, 5, and 10 μg/ml). After 24 h, culture medium containing FGF21 was removed and replaced with serum-free DMEM. Monolayer cultures set up in 100-mm culture (15.Leung K.C. Doyle N. Ballesteros M. Waters M.J. Ho K.K.

After centrifugation, the packed cells were resuspended in 2.5 ml of ice-cold inhibitor mixture and disrupted by sonication. Total cellular membranes were obtained by centrifugation of the cell sonicates at 150,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. To measure GH binding, the membrane pellets were resuspended at protein concentrations of 1 mg/ml in 300 μl of binding assay buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 0.1% BSA, and 10 mm MgCl2) and incubated at 4 °C in triplicate with 105 cpm human 125I-labeled GH in the presence or absence of 10 μg of unlabeled GH. At the indicated time points (1, 6, and 24 h), the membrane suspensions were centrifuged and washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS/BSA, and radioactivity was counted using a scintillation counter. To determine the soluble GH binding activity, conditioned media were collected, centrifuged for 5 min at 1500 × g to remove cell debris, and concentrated approximated 15-fold by ultracentrifugation using a Centricon (Millipore). Identical volumes of each supernatant were incubated for 8 h at 4 °C with 2 × 105 cpm of [125I]GH, and radioactivity was counted using a scintillation counter. To determine whether components of the FGF21 signaling pathway are expressed in growth plate chondrocytes, we used real-time PCR and Western blot. In cultured chondrocytes isolated from 3-week-old mouse tibial growth plates and from fetal (20 days post-coitus) mouse metatarsal growth plates, we demonstrated mRNA (FGF21, FGFR1, FGFR3, and β-klotho) and protein (FGFR1, FGFR3, and β-klotho) expression (Figs. 1 and 2).FIGURE 2mRNA and protein expression of FGFR1, FGFR3, and β-klotho in the mouse liver and fetal metatarsal chondrocytes. A, FGFR1, FGFR3, and β-klotho mRNA expression in chondrocytes and liver was assessed by real time PCR. Total RNA was extracted from chondrocytes isolated from fetal (20 days post-coitus) mouse metatarsal growth plates and from the liver of 3-week-old mice. It was then processed as described under “Materials and Methods.” The mRNA expression of FGFR1, FGFR3, and β-klotho mRNA was normalized by β-actin in the same samples. B, protein extracted from liver and chondrocytes was immunoblotted for FGFR1, FGFR3, and β-klotho. β-Actin was used as a loading control. A representative blot from three independent experiments is presented.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To evaluate the direct effects of FGF21 on chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation, we added graded concentrations of rhFGF21 (0.01, 0.1, 1, 5, and 10 μg/ml) to the culture medium. After 24 h, higher concentrations of rhFGF21 (5–10 μg/ml) significantly reduced total thymidine incorporation (Fig. 3A, p < 0.01 versus control) and decreased the mRNA expression of collagen X (assessed by real-time PCR, Fig. 3B, p < 0.01 versus control), a marker of chondrocyte differentiation. The inhibitory effects of the higher concentrations of FGF21 on both total thymidine incorporation (supplemental Fig. 1A) and collagen X mRNA expression (supplemental Fig. 1B) persisted at subsequent time points (days 3, 7, and 14). These findings suggest that the FGF21-dependent decreased chondrocyte differentiation is, at least in part, independent from the inhibitory effects of FGF21 on chondrocyte proliferation. To determine whether FGF21 directly modulates the expression and activation of the FGF-dependent signaling pathway in chondrocytes, we first studied the effects of graded concentrations of FGF21 on the expression of FGFR1, FGFR3, and β-klotho. None of the concentrations of rhFGF21 used induced the expression of FGFR3, whereas the highest concentration (10 μg/ml) significantly increased the mRNA expression of FGFR1 and β-klotho (Fig. 4A, p < 0.05 versus control). We then evaluated the effects of rhFGF21 on the phosphorylation of ERK 1/2, members of the FGFR-dependent intracellular signaling cascade. After 24 h, rhFGF21 (0.1, 1, 5, and 10 μg/ml) increased ERK 1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 4, B and C, p < 0.01 or p < 0.05 versus control). To determine whether FGF21 antagonizes the effects of GH on chondrocyte function, we cultured mouse growth plate chondrocytes without or with graded concentrations of rhFGF21 (0.01, 0.1, 1, 5, and 10 μg/ml) for 24 h. After removal of FGF21 from the culture medium, chondrocytes were incubated with 10 ng/ml rmGH. In chondrocytes previously cultured without rhFGF21, rmGH significantly induced total thymidine incorporation (Fig. 5A) and collagen X mRNA expression (Fig. 5B). Both effects were prevented in chondrocytes previously treated with rhFGF21, with the lowest effective concentration being 0.1 μg/ml. We then evaluated the effects of rhFGF21 on GH binding; in chondrocytes previously cultured in the presence of rhFGF21, 125I-labeled GH binding (Fig. 6) was significantly decreased when compared with that in chondrocytes not previously cultured in the presence of FGF21. Such effect was detected as early as 1 h after 125I-labeled GH incubation. To determine whether the FGF21-dependent decreased GH binding was due to increased proteolysis at the cell surface, we measured soluble growth hormone binding protein by analyzing 125I-labeled GH binding in transfected cell culture medium. The GH binding in the medium of FGF21-treated cells was not significantly different from that in the medium of untreated cells (supplemental Fig. 2). We then evaluated the GHR expression in mouse growth plate chondrocytes cultured in the presence of graded concentrations of FGF21. None of the FGF21 concentrations significantly modified GHR mRNA expression (assessed by real-time PCR, Fig. 7A) or GHR protein expression (assessed by Western, Fig. 7, B and C) when compared with untreated chondrocytes. These findings indicate that FGF21 specifically prevents the GH stimulatory effects on chondrocyte function by reducing GH binding. Such reduced binding is not due to either changes in GHR expression or increased proteolysis of the cell surface-bound GHR.FIGURE 6Time-dependent and concentration-dependent effects of FGF21 on GH receptor binding activity in chondrocytes.

Chondrocytes were washed with fresh serum-free DMEM, seeded in 24-well plate, and cultured for 24 h in the absence or presence of graded concentrations of rhFGF21 (0.01–10 μg/ml). A, total RNA was extracted from chondrocytes and then processed as described under “Materials and Methods.” GHR mRNA expression was evaluated by real time PCR. The relative expression levels of mRNA were normalized by β-actin in the same samples. Results were expressed as -fold change compared with control (untreated) chondrocytes (mean ± S.E.).

Results are expressed as ratio of GHR to β-actin (mean ± S.E.).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the effects of GH and/or FGF21 depend on the intracellular activity of IGF-1 in chondrocytes, we transfected cells with both IGF-1 siRNAs and IGF-1R siRNAs. Total thymidine incorporation and collagen X mRNA expression in GH-treated, siRNA-transfected chondrocytes remained significantly greater than in untreated transfected chondrocytes (supplemental Figs. 3 and 4, respectively). In addition, the antagonistic effects of rhFGF21 on GH activity were confirmed in IGF-1 siRNA + IGF-1R siRNA-transfected cells. Last, we evaluated the effects of FGF21 and GH in chondrocytes transfected with FGFR1 siRNA or ERK 1 siRNA. As previously shown, FGF21 dose-dependently (0.1, 1, 5, and 10 μg/ml) prevented the GH stimulatory effects on total thymidine incorporation (Fig. 8, panel A) and collagen X expression (Fig. 8, panel B) in control siRNA-transfected chondrocytes. In contrast, in FGFR1 siRNA-transfected or ERK 1 siRNA-transfected cells only the highest concentration of FGF21 (10 μg/ml) prevented the GH effects in chondrocytes. These findings suggest that the FGF21 effects on chondrocyte function are specific and depend on the normal activity of the FGFR1 and ERK 1. Longitudinal bone growth occurs at the growth plate by a process called endochondral ossification (17.Hunziker E.B. Mechanism of longitudinal bone growth and its regulation by growth plate chondrocytes.Microsc. Res. Tech. 1994; 28: 505-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) in which cartilage is first formed and then remodeled into bone tissue. Cartilage formation primarily results from growth plate chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy (18.Farnum C.E. Wilshan N.J. Morphologic stages of terminal hypertrophic chondrocyte of growth plate cartilage.Anat. Rec. 1987; 219: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and extracellular matrix secretion. The newly formed cartilage is invaded by blood vessels and bone cell precursors from the metaphysis, which remodel the cartilaginous hypertrophic zone into bone (19.Aharinejad S. Marks Jr., S.C. Böck P. MacKay C.A. Larson E.K. Tahamtani A. Mason-Savas A Firbas W. Microvascular pattern in the metaphysis during bone growth.Anat. Rec. 1995; 242: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The net effect of these events is that new bone tissue is progressively laid down at the bottom of the growth plate, resulting in bone elongation. Longitudinal bone growth is tightly governed by a complex network of endocrine and paracrine growth factors, the latter of which includes the FGFs. The FGFs is a family of proteins known to be implicated in the regulation of growth plate chondrogenesis (20.De Luca F. Baron J. Control of bone growth by fibroblast growth factors.Trends. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 10: 61-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 21.Horton W.A. Degnin C.R. FGFs in endochondral skeletal development.Trends. Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 20: 341-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The murine growth plate expresses several members of this family, including FGF21; it has been shown to be expressed in the perichondrium surrounding the rat postnatal growth plate (22.Lazarus J.E.

Because these FGFs lack the typical FGF heparin binding domain, they can be released from the tissue of synthesis and act on distant sites as systemic or endocrine factors. On the other hand, recent evidence suggests that FGF21 may also function in a paracrine/autocrine manner (32.Johnson C.L. Weston J.Y. Chadi S.A. Fazio E.N. Huff M.W. Kharitonenkov A. Köester A.

Although some studies indicate that FGF21 may preferentially activate the FGFR1/β-klotho complex, other evidence indicates that it can bind all the four FGFRs (2.Kharitonenkov A. Shiyanova T.L.

From pharmacology to physiology.Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2010; 91: 254S-257SCrossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). FGF21 is predominantly expressed in the exocrine and endocrine pancreas, liver, muscle, and white adipose tissue. The co-localization of the FGFRs and β-klotho in these tissues suggest that that FGF21 may exert its function in the same sites (12.Kurosu H. Choi M. Ogawa Y. Dickson A.S. Goetz R. Eliseenkova A.V.

Endocrinol. 2010; 24: 2050-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Although FGF21 is most known as an important metabolic regulator during fasting, recent evidence suggests that it may be implicated in the regulation of skeletal growth. In 2008, Inagaki et al. (7.Inagaki T. Lin V.Y. Goetz R. Mohammadi M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Kliewer S.A. Inhibition of growth hormone signaling by the fasting-induced hormone FGF21.Cell Metab. 2008; 8: 77-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) showed that transgenic mice overexpressing FGF21 are smaller and exhibit shorter tibiae when compared with WT mice. In addition, the decreased expression of phosphorylated Stat5 and IGF-1 in the liver of FGF21 transgenic mice suggests that overexpression of FGF21 may cause GH insensitivity. These findings and the fact that FGF21 expression is increased during fasting, led us to hypothesize that increased expression of FGF21 during chronic undernutrition may cause undernutrition-associated growth failure in mammals. Indeed, we have recently demonstrated that mice undergoing food restriction experience reduced body and tibial growth along with increased FGF21 expression in the liver and in the tibial growth plate (6.Kubicky R.A. Wu S. Kharitonenkov A. De Luca F. Role of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) in undernutrition-related attenuation of growth in mice.Endocrinology. 2012; 153: 2287-2295Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Food-restricted Fgf21 knock-out mice exhibit greater body and tibial growth and spared growth plate chondrogenesis compared with food-restricted wild-type littermates. In addition, food-restricted Fgf21 knock-out mice are more GH-sensitive than the wild-type mice, with such difference resulting from greater GH receptor abundance in hepatocytes. These findings suggest that increased expression of FGF21 during prolonged food restriction causes growth attenuation by inducing systemic GH insensitivity. Interestingly, food-restricted Fgf21 knock-out mice also show greater GH receptor abundance and reduced Stat5 phosphorylation and IGF-1 expression in the tibial growth plate chondrocytes. Although it is plausible to hypothesize that FGF21 may also cause GH insensitivity directly at the growth plate, these previous findings do not confirm a direct effect of FGF21 on growth plate chondrocytes. In this study, we have demonstrated that FGF21 directly antagonizes GH stimulatory effects on proliferation and differentiation of growth plate chondrocytes. Of note, the GH effects on chondrocyte function (as well as the antagonistic effects of FGF21) persist in IGF-1 siRNA-transfected chondrocytes. Thus, it is plausible to speculate that these effects are, at least in part, non-IGF-1-dependent. The direct effects of FGF21 on the growth plate are supported by the expression of FGFR1, FGFR3, and β-klotho in growth plate chondrocytes as well as by the FGF21-mediated induction of ERK 1/2 phosphorylation (ERK 1/2 are members of the FGFR-dependent intracellular signaling cascade). The fact that the antagonistic properties of FGF21 on GH binding and GH-stimulated chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation are prevented in FGFR1 siRNA- or ERK 1 siRNA-transfected chondrocytes further support the conclusion that the effects of FGF21 are specific. In our study high concentrations of rhFGF21 have been found to directly inhibit chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation; such effects may be explained by the increased expression of FGFR1 and β-klotho induced by the highest concentration of FGF21, which could potentiate the intracellular transcriptional changes elicited by FGF21. However, we do not know whether these high concentrations used in vitro reflect the levels of expression in tissues or the serum levels of FGF21 during prolonged food restriction. In our study the lack of any direct effect of FGF21 on GHR expression or on the proteolysis of the cell membrane-bound GHR suggests that the FGF21-dependent decreased GH binding likely results from a reduced GHR intracellular recycling. Interestingly, a recent study has demonstrated the increased hepatic expression of LEPROT and LEPROTL1 (two small proteins known to regulate intracellular protein trafficking) during fasting in rodents. The increased activity of LEPROT and LEPROTL1 causes GH insensitivity by inhibiting GHR intracellular trafficking and, in turn, GHR cell-surface abundance without affecting GHR expression (16.Touvier T. Conte-Auriol F. Briand O. Cudejko C. Paumelle R. Caron S. Baugé E. Rouillé Y. Salles J.P. Staels B. Bailleul B. LEPROT and LEPROTL1 cooperatively decrease hepatic growth hormone action in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 3830-3838Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Ongoing studies in our laboratory are evaluating the functional interaction between FGF21 and LEPROT/LEPROTL1 in the liver and in chondrocytes. Although our study demonstrates its direct effects on chondrocytes, it is still unclear whether FGF21 antagonizes GH effects on growth plate chondrogenesis as a systemic (endocrine) and/or as a paracrine growth factor. Indeed, its food restriction-related increased expression in the liver (and plausibly in other tissues) as well as in the mouse tibial growth plate would suggest both (or either) modalities of action. In conclusion, our study provides evidence for a specific, direct effect of FGF21 on growth plate chondrocytes; by binding FGFR1 and/or FGFR3 (negative regulators of growth plate chondrogenesis), FGF21 prevents GH-mediated stimulation of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation. In addition, high concentrations of FGF21 directly inhibit cell proliferation and differentiation. Thus, our findings contribute to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the growth attenuation associated with the increased expression of FGF21 during food restriction in rodents.

https://openalex.org/W2014978522,"Chlorpyrifos is of great environmental concern due to its widespread use in the past several decades and its potential toxic effects on human health. Thus, the degradation study of chlorpyrifos has become increasing important in recent years. A fungus capable of using chlorpyrifos as the sole carbon source was isolated from organophosphate-contaminated soil and characterized as Cladosporium cladosporioides Hu-01 (collection number: CCTCC M 20711). A novel chlorpyrifos hydrolase from cell extract was purified 35.6-fold to apparent homogeneity with 38.5% overall recovery by ammoniumsulfate precipitation, gel filtration chromatography and anion-exchange chromatography. It is a monomeric structure with a molecular mass of 38.3 kDa. The pI value was estimated to be 5.2. The optimal pH and temperature of the purified enzyme were 6.5 and 40°C, respectively. No cofactors were required for the chlorpyrifos-hydrolysis activity. The enzyme was strongly inhibited by Hg²⁺, Fe³⁺, DTT, β-mercaptoethanol and SDS, whereas slight inhibitory effects (5-10% inhibition) were observed in the presence of Mn²⁺, Zn²⁺, Cu²⁺, Mg²⁺, and EDTA. The purified enzyme hydrolyzed various organophosphorus insecticides with P-O and P-S bond. Chlorpyrifos was the preferred substrate. The Km and Vmax values of the enzyme for chlorpyrifos were 6.7974 μM and 2.6473 μmol·min⁻¹, respectively. Both NH2-terminal sequencing and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF-MS) identified an amino acid sequence MEPDGELSALTQGANS, which shared no similarity with any reported organophosphate-hydrolyzing enzymes. These results suggested that the purified enzyme was a novel hydrolase and might conceivably be developed to fulfill the practical requirements to enable its use in situ for detoxification of chlorpyrifos. Finally, this is the first described chlorpyrifos hydrolase from fungus."
https://openalex.org/W1985076554,"LRP5 and LRP6 are proteins predicted to contain four six-bladed β-propeller domains and both bind the bone-specific Wnt signaling antagonist sclerostin. Here, we report the crystal structure of the amino-terminal region of LRP6 and using NMR show that the ability of sclerostin to bind to this molecule is mediated by the central core of sclerostin and does not involve the amino- and carboxyl-terminal flexible arm regions. We show that this structured core region interacts with LRP5 and LRP6 via an NXI motif (found in the sequence PNAIG) within a flexible loop region (loop 2) within the central core region. This sequence is related closely to a previously identified motif in laminin that mediates its interaction with the β-propeller domain of nidogen. However, the NXI motif is not involved in the interaction of sclerostin with LRP4 (another β-propeller containing protein in the LRP family). A peptide derived from the loop 2 region of sclerostin blocked the interaction of sclerostin with LRP5/6 and also inhibited Wnt1 but not Wnt3A or Wnt9B signaling. This suggests that these Wnts interact with LRP6 in different ways."

The doctor/patient dialogue has been extensively researched from different perspectives, with findings emphasising a range of behaviours that lead to effective communication. Much research involves self-reports, however, so that behavioural engagement cannot be disentangled from patients’ ratings of effectiveness. In this study we used a highly efficient and time economic automated computer visualisation measurement technique called Discursis to analyse conversational behaviour in consultations. Discursis automatically builds an internal language model from a transcript, mines the transcript for its conceptual content, and generates an interactive visual account of the discourse. The resultant visual account of the whole consultation can be analysed for patterns of engagement between interactants. The findings from this study show that Discursis is effective at highlighting a range of consultation techniques, including communication accommodation, engagement and repetition."
https://openalex.org/W2064547101,"Inflammation and oxidative stress play a crucial role in angiotensin (Ang) II-mediated vascular injury. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has recently been identified as a specific Ang II-degrading enzyme but its role in vascular biology remains elusive. We hypothesized that loss of ACE2 would facilitate Ang II-mediated vascular inflammation and peroxynitrite production. 10-week wildtype (WT, Ace2+/y) and ACE2 knockout (ACE2KO, Ace2−/y) mice received with mini-osmotic pumps with Ang II (1.5 mg.kg−1.d−1) or saline for 2 weeks. Aortic ACE2 protein was obviously reduced in WT mice in response to Ang II related to increases in profilin-1 protein and plasma levels of Ang II and Ang-(1–7). Loss of ACE2 resulted in greater increases in Ang II-induced mRNA expressions of inflammatory cytokines monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6 without affecting tumor necrosis factor-α in aortas of ACE2KO mice. Furthermore, ACE2 deficiency led to greater increases in Ang II-mediated profilin-1 expression, NADPH oxidase activity, and superoxide and peroxynitrite production in the aortas of ACE2KO mice associated with enhanced phosphorylated levels of Akt, p70S6 kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Interestingly, daily treatment with AT1 receptor blocker irbesartan (50 mg/kg) significantly prevented Ang II-mediated aortic profilin-1 expression, inflammation, and peroxynitrite production in WT mice with enhanced ACE2 levels and the suppression of the Akt-ERK-eNOS signaling pathways. Our findings reveal that ACE2 deficiency worsens Ang II-mediated aortic inflammation and peroxynitrite production associated with the augmentation of profilin-1 expression and the activation of the Akt-ERK-eNOS signaling, suggesting potential therapeutic approaches by enhancing ACE2 action for patients with vascular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2017969572,"Three independent line intercept transect surveys on northern Red Sea reef slopes conducted in 1988/9 and 1997/8 in Egypt and from 2006–9 in Saudi Arabia were used to compare community patterns and coral size. Coral communities showed scale-dependent variability, highest at fine spatial and taxonomic scale (species-specific within and among reef patterns). At coarser scale (generic pattern across regions), patterns were more uniform (regionally consistent generic dominance on differently exposed reef slopes and at different depths). Neither fine- nor coarse-scale patterns aligned along the sampled 1700 km latitudinal gradient. Thus, a latitudinal gradient that had been described earlier from comparable datasets, separating the Red Sea into three faunistic zones, was no longer apparent. This may indicate subtle changes in species distributions. Coral size, measured as corrected average intercept of corals in transects, had decreased from 1997 to 2009, after having remained constant from 1988 to 1997. Recruitment had remained stable (∼12 juvenile corals per m2). Size distributions had not changed significantly but large corals had declined over 20 years. Thus, data from a wide range of sites taken over two decades support claims by others that climate change is indeed beginning to show clear effects on Red Sea reefs."

Biofilm formation is one of the mechanisms through which the endotracheal tube (ET) facilitates bacterial contamination of the lower airways. In the present study, we analyzed the composition of the ET biofilm flora by means of culture dependent and culture independent (16 S rRNA gene clone libraries and pyrosequencing) approaches. Overall, the microbial diversity was high and members of different phylogenetic lineages were detected (Actinobacteria, beta-Proteobacteria, Candida spp., Clostridia, epsilon-Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria and gamma-Proteobacteria). Culture dependent analysis, based on the use of selective growth media and conventional microbiological tests, resulted in the identification of typical aerobic nosocomial pathogens which are known to play a role in the development of VAP, e.g. Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Other opportunistic pathogens were also identified, including Staphylococcus epidermidis and Kocuria varians. In general, there was little correlation between the results obtained by sequencing 16 S rRNA gene clone libraries and by cultivation. Pyrosequencing of PCR amplified 16 S rRNA genes of four selected samples resulted in the identification of a much wider variety of bacteria. The results from the pyrosequencing analysis suggest that these four samples were dominated by members of the normal oral flora such as Prevotella spp., Peptostreptococcus spp. and lactic acid bacteria. A combination of methods is recommended to obtain a complete picture of the microbial diversity of the ET biofilm."
https://openalex.org/W2135522818,"Heart and skeletal inflammation (HSMI) of farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) is a disease characterized by a chronic myocarditis involving the epicardium and the compact and spongious part of the heart ventricle. Chronic myositis of the red skeletal muscle is also a typical finding of HSMI. Piscine reovirus (PRV) has been detected by real-time PCR from farmed and wild salmon with and without typical changes of HSMI and thus the causal relationship between presence of virus and the disease has not been fully determined. In this study we show that the Atlantic salmon reovirus (ASRV), identical to PRV, can be passaged in GF-1 cells and experimental challenge of naïve Atlantic salmon with cell culture passaged reovirus results in cardiac and skeletal muscle pathology typical of HSMI with onset of pathology from 6 weeks, peaking by 9 weeks post challenge. ASRV replicates in heart tissue and the peak level of virus replication coincides with peak of heart lesions. We further demonstrate mRNA transcript assessment and in situ characterization that challenged fish develop a CD8+ T cell myocarditis."
https://openalex.org/W1994222503,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the chemopreventive effect of a novel flavonoid, ampelopsin (AMP) on the growth and metastasis of prostate cancer cells. AMP showed the more potent activity in inhibiting the proliferation of androgen-sensitive LNCaP and, to less extent, androgen-independent PC-3 human prostate cancer cell lines in vitro, primarily by induction of apoptosis associated with down-regulation of bcl-2. On the other hand, AMP showed much less activity in inhibiting the proliferation of normal prostate epithelial cells than that of prostate cancer cell lines. AMP also inhibited the migration and invasion of PC-3 cells in vitro associated with down-regulation of CXCR4 expression. In the animal study using an orthotopic prostate tumor model, AMP (150 and 300 mg/kg body weight) inhibited the growth of PC-3 tumors and lymph node and lung metastases in a dose-dependent manner. Compared to the control mice, mice treated with AMP at 300 mg/kg BW had reduced final tumor weight by 49.2% (P<0.05), lymph node metastases by 54.5% (P = 0.3) and lung metastases by 93% (P<0.05), but had no apparent alteration on food intake or body weight. The in vivo anti-growth and anti-metastasis activities of AMP were associated with induction of apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation of prostate cancer cells, reduction of prostate tumor angiogenesis, and reduction of CXCR4 expression. Our results provide supporting evidence to warrant further investigation to develop AMP as a novel efficacious and safe candidate agent against progression and metastasis of prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2032555624,"Chronic inflammation promotes atherosclerosis in cardiovascular disease and is a major prognostic factor for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is involved in the progress of atherosclerosis and plaque destabilization and plays a pivotal role in the development of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Little is known to date about the clinical impact of MIF in patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD).In a pilot study, 286 patients with symptomatic CAD (n = 119 ACS, n = 167 stable CAD) undergoing PCI were consecutively evaluated. 25 healthy volunteers served as control. Expression of MIF was consecutively measured in patients at the time of PCI. Baseline levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6), ""regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed, and secreted"" (RANTES) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) were measured by Bio-Plex Cytokine assay. C-reactive protein (CRP) was determined by Immunoassay. Patients with ACS showed higher plasma levels of MIF compared to patients with stable CAD and control subjects (median 2.85 ng/mL, interquartile range (IQR) 3.52 versus median 1.22 ng/mL, IQR 2.99, versus median 0.1, IQR 0.09, p<0.001). Increased MIF levels were associated with CRP and IL-6 levels and correlated with troponin I (TnI) release (spearman rank coefficient: 0.31, p<0.001). Patients with ACS due to plaque rupture showed significantly higher plasma levels of MIF than patients with flow limiting stenotic lesions (p = 0.002).To our knowledge this is the first study, demonstrating enhanced expression of MIF in ACS. It is associated with established inflammatory markers, correlates with the extent of cardiac necrosis marker release after PCI and is significantly increased in ACS patients with ""culprit"" lesions. Further attempts should be undertaken to characterize the role of MIF for risk assessment in the setting of ACS."
https://openalex.org/W2094524925,"Free-ranging animals often cope with fluctuating environmental conditions such as weather, food availability, predation risk, the requirements of breeding, and the influence of anthropogenic factors. Consequently, researchers are increasingly measuring stress markers, especially glucocorticoids, to understand stress, disturbance, and population health. Studying free-ranging animals, however, comes with numerous difficulties posed by environmental conditions and the particular characteristics of study species. Performing measurements under either physical restraint or chemical sedation may affect the physiological variable under investigation and lead to values that may not reflect the standard functional state of the animal. This study measured the stress response resulting from different handling conditions in northern elephant seals and any ensuing influences on carbohydrate metabolism. Endogenous glucose production (EGP) was measured using [6-(3)H]glucose and plasma cortisol concentration was measured from blood samples drawn during three-hour measurement intervals. These measurements were conducted in weanlings and yearlings with and without the use of chemical sedatives--under chemical sedation, physical restraint, or unrestrained. We compared these findings with measurements in adult seals sedated in the field. The method of handling had a significant influence on the stress response and carbohydrate metabolism. Physically restrained weanlings and yearlings transported to the lab had increased concentrations of circulating cortisol (F(11, 46) = 25.2, p<0.01) and epinephrine (F(3, 12) = 5.8, p = 0.01). Physical restraint led to increased EGP (t = 3.1, p = 0.04) and elevated plasma glucose levels (t = 8.2, p<0.01). Animals chemically sedated in the field typically did not exhibit a cortisol stress response. The combination of anesthetic agents (Telazol, ketamine, and diazepam) used in this study appeared to alleviate a cortisol stress response due to handling in the field without altering carbohydrate metabolism. Measures of hormone concentrations and metabolism made under these conditions are more likely to reflect basal values."

Methodology and Principal Findings Five M.tb infection phase-dependent antigens, comprising of three DosR-regulon-encoded proteins (Rv2032, Rv0081, Rv1737c), and two resucitation promoting factors (Rv0867c and Rv2389c), were evaluated in a case-control study with 15 pulmonary TB patients and 15 household contacts that were recruited from a high TB incidence setting in Cape Town, South Africa. After a 7-day whole blood culture, supernatants were harvested and the levels of the host markers evaluated using the Luminex platform. Multiple antigen-specific host markers were identified with promising diagnostic potential. Rv0081-specific levels of IL-12(p40), IP-10, IL-10 and TNF-α were the most promising diagnostic candidates, each ascertaining TB disease with an accuracy of 100%, 95% confidence interval for the area under the receiver operating characteristics plots, (1.0 to 1.0). Conclusions Multiple cytokines other than IFN-γ in whole blood culture supernatants after stimulation with M.tb infection phase-dependent antigens show promise as diagnostic markers for active TB. These preliminary findings should be verified in well-designed diagnostic studies employing short-term culture assays."
https://openalex.org/W2093884383,"Microtubule plus-end-tracking proteins (+TIPs) specifically localize to the growing plus-ends of microtubules to regulate microtubule dynamics and functions. A large group of +TIPs contain a short linear motif, SXIP, which is essential for them to bind to end-binding proteins (EBs) and target microtubule ends. The SXIP sequence site thus acts as a widespread microtubule tip localization signal (MtLS). Here we have analyzed the sequence-function relationship of a canonical MtLS. Using synthetic peptide arrays on membrane supports, we identified the residue preferences at each amino acid position of the SXIP motif and its surrounding sequence with respect to EB binding. We further developed an assay based on fluorescence polarization to assess the mechanism of the EB-SXIP interaction and to correlate EB binding and microtubule tip tracking of MtLS sequences from different +TIPs. Finally, we investigated the role of phosphorylation in regulating the EB-SXIP interaction. Together, our results define the sequence determinants of a canonical MtLS and provide the experimental data for bioinformatics approaches to carry out genome-wide predictions of novel +TIPs in multiple organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2053146785,"Bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) balance proliferation and differentiation by integrating complex transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms regulated by cell intrinsic and extrinsic factors. We found that transcripts of G(0)/G(1) switch gene 2 (G0S2) are enriched in lineage(-) Sca-1(+) c-kit(+) (LSK) CD150(+) CD48(-) CD41(-) cells, a population highly enriched for quiescent HSCs, whereas G0S2 expression is suppressed in dividing LSK CD150(+) CD48(-) cells. Gain-of-function analyses using retroviral expression vectors in bone marrow cells showed that G0S2 localizes to the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and early endosomes in hematopoietic cells. Co-transplantation of bone marrow cells transduced with the control or G0S2 retrovirus led to increased chimerism of G0S2-overexpressing cells in femurs, although their contribution to the blood was reduced. This finding was correlated with increased quiescence in G0S2-overexpressing HSCs (LSK CD150(+) CD48(-)) and progenitor cells (LS(-)K). Conversely, silencing of endogenous G0S2 expression in bone marrow cells increased blood chimerism upon transplantation and promoted HSC cell division, supporting an inhibitory role for G0S2 in HSC proliferation. A proteomic study revealed that the hydrophobic domain of G0S2 interacts with a domain of nucleolin that is rich in arginine-glycine-glycine repeats, which results in the retention of nucleolin in the cytosol. We showed that this cytosolic retention of nucleolin occurs in resting, but not proliferating, wild-type LSK CD150(+) CD48(-) cells. Collectively, we propose a novel model of HSC quiescence in which elevated G0S2 expression can sequester nucleolin in the cytosol, precluding its pro-proliferation functions in the nucleolus."
https://openalex.org/W2063863569,"Pattern recognition receptors and receptors for pro-inflammatory cytokines provide critical signals to drive the development of protective immunity to infection. Therefore, counter-regulatory pathways are required to ensure that overwhelming inflammation harm host tissues. Previously, we showed that lipoxins modulate immune response during infection, restraining inflammation during infectious diseases in an Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)/suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS)2-dependent-manner. Recently, Indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3- dioxygenase (IDO)-derived tryptophan metabolites, including L-kynurenine, were also shown to be involved in several counter-regulatory mechanisms. Herein, we addressed whether the intracellular molecular events induced by lipoxins mediating control of innate immune signaling are part of a common regulatory pathway also shared by L-kynurenine exposure. We demonstrate that Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF)6--member of a family of adapter molecules that couple the TNF receptor and interleukin-1 receptor/Toll-like receptor families to intracellular signaling events essential for the development of immune responses--is targeted by both lipoxins and L-kynurenine via an AhR/SOCS2-dependent pathway. Furthermore, we show that LXA₄- and L-kynurenine-induced AhR activation, its subsequent nuclear translocation, leading SOCS2 expression and TRAF6 Lys47-linked poly-ubiquitination and proteosome-mediated degradation of the adapter proteins. The in vitro consequences of such molecular interactions included inhibition of TLR- and cytokine receptor-driven signal transduction and cytokine production. Subsequently, in vivo proteosome inhibition led to unresponsiveness to lipoxins, as well as to uncontrolled pro-inflammatory reactions and elevated mortality during toxoplasmosis. In summary, our results establish proteasome degradation of TRAF6 as a key molecular target for the anti-inflammatory pathway triggered by lipoxins and L-kynurenine, critical counter-regulatory mediators in the innate and adaptive immune systems."
https://openalex.org/W1992753049,"The freshwater fauna of Southern Australia is primarily restricted to the southwestern and southeastern corners of the continent, and is separated by a large, arid region that is inhospitable to this biota. This geographic phenomenon has attracted considerable interest from biogeographers looking to explain evolutionary diversification in this region. Here, we employed phylogenetic and phylogeographic approaches to evaluate the effect of this barrier on a group of four galaxiid fish species (Galaxiella) endemic to temperate Southern Australia. We also tested if continental shelf width has influenced connectivity among populations during low sea levels when rivers, now isolated, could have been connected. We addressed these questions by sampling each species across its range using multiple molecular markers (mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences, nuclear S7 intron sequences, and 49 allozyme loci). These data also allowed us to assess species boundaries, to refine phylogenetic affinities, and to estimate species ages. Interestingly, we found compelling evidence for cryptic species in G. pusilla, manifesting as allopatric eastern and western taxa. Our combined phylogeny and dating analysis point to an origin for the genus dating to the early Cenozoic, with three of the four species originating during the Oligocene-Miocene. Each Galaxiella species showed high levels of genetic divergences between all but the most proximate populations. Despite extensive drainage connections during recent low sea levels in southeastern Australia, populations of both species within G. pusilla maintained high levels of genetic structure. All populations experienced Late Pleistocene-Holocene population growth, possibly in response to the relaxation of arid conditions after the last glacial maximum. High levels of genetic divergence and the discovery of new cryptic species have important implications for the conservation of this already threatened group of freshwater species."
https://openalex.org/W2136158765,"Arginine methylation of non-histone proteins by protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) has been shown to be important for various biological processes from yeast to human. Although PRMT genes are well conserved in fungi, none of them have been functionally characterized in plant pathogenic ascomycetes. In this study, we identified and characterized all of the four predicted PRMT genes in Fusarium graminearum, the causal agent of Fusarium head blight of wheat and barley. Whereas deletion of the other three PRMT genes had no obvious phenotypes, the Δamt1 mutant had pleiotropic defects. AMT1 is a predicted type I PRMT gene that is orthologous to HMT1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The Δamt1 mutant was slightly reduced in vegetative growth but normal in asexual and sexual reproduction. It had increased sensitivities to oxidative and membrane stresses. DON mycotoxin production and virulence on flowering wheat heads also were reduced in the Δamt1 mutant. The introduction of the wild-type AMT1 allele fully complemented the defects of the Δamt1 mutant and Amt1-GFP fusion proteins mainly localized to the nucleus. Hrp1 and Nab2 are two hnRNPs in yeast that are methylated by Hmt1 for nuclear export. In F. graminearum, AMT1 is required for the nuclear export of FgHrp1 but not FgNab2, indicating that yeast and F. graminearum differ in the methylation and nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of hnRNP components. Because AMT2 also is a predicted type I PRMT with limited homology to yeast HMT1, we generated the Δamt1 Δamt2 double mutants. The Δamt1 single and Δamt1 Δamt2 double mutants had similar defects in all the phenotypes assayed, including reduced vegetative growth and virulence. Overall, data from this systematic analysis of PRMT genes suggest that AMT1, like its ortholog in yeast, is the predominant PRMT gene in F. graminearum and plays a role in hyphal growth, stress responses, and plant infection."
https://openalex.org/W2077146255,"Vibrio vulnificus is a halophilic marine pathogen associated with human diseases such as septicemia and serious wound infections. Genes vvsA and vvsB, which are co-transcribed and encode a member of the nonribosomal peptide synthase family, are required for vulnibactin biosynthesis in V. vulnificus. In this study, we found that quorum sensing represses the transcription of a vvsAB-lux reporter fusion. Gel shift assay and DNaseI footprinting experiments show that the main regulator of quorum sensing, SmcR, binds to a 22-bp region located between -40 and -19 with respect to the vvsA transcription start site. Mutation of the SmcR binding site abolishes the repression of vvsA::luxAB by SmcR. Fur represses vvsAB transcription in the presence of iron by binding to a 47-bp region located between -45 and +2 with respect to the vvsA transcription start site. A competition gel shift assay and footprinting experiment using Fur and SmcR showed that Fur binds to the vvsA promoter region with higher affinity than SmcR. Studies with the vvsAB::luxAB transcriptional fusion demonstrate that in the presence of iron, Fur is the key repressor of vvsAB transcription, whereas in iron-limited conditions, SmcR is the key regulator repressing vvsAB transcription. This study demonstrates that the Fe-Fur complex and quorum sensing cooperate to repress the transcription of vvsAB in response to iron conditions, suggesting that fine tuning of the intracellular iron level is important for the survival and pathogenicity of V. vulnificus."
https://openalex.org/W2080138200,"Introduction The orphan nuclear receptor COUP-TFII plays an undefined role in breast cancer. Previously we reported lower COUP-TFII expression in tamoxifen/endocrine- resistant versus sensitive breast cancer cell lines. The identification of COUP-TFII-interacting proteins will help to elucidate its mechanism of action as a transcriptional regulator in breast cancer. Results FLAG-affinity purification and multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) identified nucleolin among the proteins interacting with COUP-TFII in MCF-7 tamoxifen-sensitive breast cancer cells. Interaction of COUP-TFII and nucleolin was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins in MCF-7 and T47D breast cancer cells. In vitro studies revealed that COUP-TFII interacts with the C-terminal arginine-glycine repeat (RGG) domain of nucleolin. Functional interaction between COUP-TFII and nucleolin was indicated by studies showing that siRNA knockdown of nucleolin and an oligonucleotide aptamer that targets nucleolin, AS1411, inhibited endogenous COUP-TFII-stimulated RARB2 expression in MCF-7 and T47D cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed COUP-TFII occupancy of the RARB2 promoter was increased by all-trans retinoic acid (atRA). RARβ2 regulated gene RRIG1 was increased by atRA and COUP-TFII transfection and inhibited by siCOUP-TFII. Immunohistochemical staining of breast tumor microarrays showed nuclear COUP-TFII and nucleolin staining was correlated in invasive ductal carcinomas. COUP-TFII staining correlated with ERα, SRC-1, AIB1, Pea3, MMP2, and phospho-Src and was reduced with increased tumor grade. Conclusions Our data indicate that nucleolin plays a coregulatory role in transcriptional regulation of the tumor suppressor RARB2 by COUP-TFII."
https://openalex.org/W2028490462,"Interstrand cross-links (ICLs) covalently link complementary DNA strands, block DNA replication, and transcription and must be removed to allow cell survival. Several pathways, including the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway, can faithfully repair ICLs and maintain genomic integrity; however, the precise mechanisms of most ICL repair processes remain enigmatic. In this study we genetically characterized a conserved yeast ICL repair pathway composed of the yeast homologs (Mph1, Chl1, Mhf1, Mhf2) of four FA proteins (FANCM, FANCJ, MHF1, MHF2). This pathway is epistatic with Rad5-mediated DNA damage bypass and distinct from the ICL repair pathways mediated by Rad18 and Pso2. In addition, consistent with the FANCM role in stabilizing ICL-stalled replication forks, we present evidence that Mph1 prevents ICL-stalled replication forks from collapsing into double-strand breaks. This unique repair function of Mph1 is specific for ICL damage and does not extend to other types of damage. These studies reveal the functional conservation of the FA pathway and validate the yeast model for future studies to further elucidate the mechanism of the FA pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2000438775,"The Mediator complex transmits activation signals from DNA bound transcription factors to the core transcription machinery. In addition to its canonical role in transcriptional activation, recent studies have demonstrated that S. cerevisiae Mediator can interact directly with nucleosomes, and their histone tails. Mutations in Mediator subunits have shown that Mediator and certain chromatin structures mutually impact each other structurally and functionally in vivo. We have taken a UV photo cross-linking approach to further delineate the molecular basis of Mediator chromatin interactions and help determine whether the impact of certain Mediator mutants on chromatin is direct. Specifically, by using histone tail peptides substituted with an amino acid analog that is a UV activatible crosslinker, we have identified specific subunits within Mediator that participate in histone tail interactions. Using Mediator purified from mutant yeast strains we have evaluated the impact of these subunits on histone tail binding. This analysis has identified the Med5 subunit of Mediator as a target for histone tail interactions and suggests that the previously observed effect of med5 mutations on telomeric heterochromatin and silencing is direct."
https://openalex.org/W2018498466,"Optical trapping (tweezing) has been used in conjunction with fluid flow technology to dissect the mechanics and spatio-temporal dynamics of how neural progenitor/stem cells (NSCs) adhere and aggregate. Hitherto unavailable information has been obtained on the most probable minimum time (∼5 s) and most probable minimum distance of approach (4–6 µm) required for irreversible adhesion of proximate cells to occur. Our experiments also allow us to study and quantify the spatial characteristics of filopodial- and membrane-mediated adhesion, and to probe the functional dynamics of NSCs to quantify a lower limit of the adhesive force by which NSCs aggregate (∼18 pN). Our findings, which we also validate by computational modeling, have important implications for the neurosphere assay: once aggregated, neurospheres cannot disassemble merely by being subjected to shaking or by thermal effects. Our findings provide quantitative affirmation to the notion that the neurosphere assay may not be a valid measure of clonality and “stemness”. Post-adhesion dynamics were also studied and oscillatory motion in filopodia-mediated adhesion was observed. Furthermore, we have also explored the effect of the removal of calcium ions: both filopodia-mediated as well as membrane-membrane adhesion were inhibited. On the other hand, F-actin disrupted the dynamics of such adhesion events such that filopodia-mediated adhesion was inhibited but not membrane-membrane adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W2163785498,"So far, genetic diversity among strains within Mycobacterium massiliense has rarely been studied. To investigate the genetic diversity among M. massiliense, we conducted phylogenetic analysis based on hsp65 (603-bp) and rpoB (711-bp) sequences from 65 M. massiliense Korean isolates. We found that hsp65 sequence analysis could clearly differentiate them into two distinct genotypes, Type I and Type II, which were isolated from 35 (53.8%) and 30 patients (46.2%), respectively. The rpoB sequence analysis revealed a total of four genotypes (R-I to R-IV) within M. massiliense strains, three of which (R-I, R-II and R-III) correlated with hsp65 Type I, and other (R-IV), which correlated with Type II. Interestingly, genotyping by the hsp65 method agreed well with colony morphology. Despite some exceptions, Type I and II correlated with smooth and rough colonies, respectively. Also, both types were completely different from one another in terms of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry profiles of whole lipid. In addition, we developed PCR-restriction analysis (PRA) based on the Hinf I digestion of 644-bp hsp65 PCR amplicons, which enables the two genotypes within M. massiliense to be easily and reliably separated. In conclusion, two distinct hsp65 genotypes exist within M. massiliense strains, which differ from one another in terms of both morphology and lipid profile. Furthermore, our data indicates that Type II is a novel M. massiliense genotype being herein presented for the first time. The disparity in clinical traits between these two hsp65 genotypes needs to be exploited in the future study."
https://openalex.org/W2021938275,"Changing patterns of sea-ice distribution and extent have measurable effects on polar marine systems. Beyond the obvious impacts of key-habitat loss, it is unclear how such changes will influence ice-associated marine mammals in part because of the logistical difficulties of studying foraging behaviour or other aspects of the ecology of large, mobile animals at sea during the polar winter. This study investigated the diet of pregnant bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus) during three spring breeding periods (2005, 2006 and 2007) with markedly contrasting ice conditions in Svalbard using stable isotopes (δ13C and δ15N) measured in whiskers collected from their newborn pups. The δ15N values in the whiskers of individual seals ranged from 11.95 to 17.45 ‰, spanning almost 2 full trophic levels. Some seals were clearly dietary specialists, despite the species being characterised overall as a generalist predator. This may buffer bearded seal populations from the changes in prey distributions lower in the marine food web which seems to accompany continued changes in temperature and ice cover. Comparisons with isotopic signatures of known prey, suggested that benthic gastropods and decapods were the most common prey. Bayesian isotopic mixing models indicated that diet varied considerably among years. In the year with most fast-ice (2005), the seals had the greatest proportion of pelagic fish and lowest benthic invertebrate content, and during the year with the least ice (2006), the seals ate more benthic invertebrates and less pelagic fish. This suggests that the seals fed further offshore in years with greater ice cover, but moved in to the fjords when ice-cover was minimal, giving them access to different types of prey. Long-term trends of sea ice decline, earlier ice melt, and increased water temperatures in the Arctic are likely to have ecosystem-wide effects, including impacts on the forage bases of pagophilic seals."
https://openalex.org/W2045715626,"The general transcription factor TFIID recognizes specifically the core promoter of genes transcribed by eukaryotic RNA polymerase II, nucleating the assembly of the preinitiation complex at the transcription start site. However, the understanding in molecular terms of TFIID assembly and function remains poorly understood. Histone fold motifs have been shown to be extremely important for the heterodimerization of many TFIID subunits. However, these subunits display several evolutionary conserved noncanonical features when compared with histones, including additional regions whose role is unknown. Here we show that the conserved additional C-terminal region of TFIID subunit TAF6 can be divided into two domains: a small middle domain (TAF6M) and a large C-terminal domain (TAF6C). Our crystal structure of the TAF6C domain from Antonospora locustae at 1.9 Å resolution reveals the presence of five conserved HEAT repeats. Based on these data, we designed several mutants that were introduced into full-length human TAF6. Surprisingly, the mutants affect the interaction between TAF6 and TAF9, suggesting that the formation of the complex between these two TFIID subunits do not only depend on their histone fold motifs. In addition, the same mutants affect even more strongly the interaction between TAF6 and TAF9 in the context of a TAF5-TAF6-TAF9 complex. Expression of these mutants in HeLa cells reveals that most of them are unstable, suggesting their poor incorporation within endogenous TFIID. Taken together, our results suggest that the conserved additional domains in histone fold-containing subunits of TFIID and of co-activator SAGA are important for the assembly of these complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2096189376,"Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified common variants in the UMOD region associated with kidney function and disease in the general population. To identify novel rare variants as well as common variants that may account for this GWAS signal, the exons and 4 kb upstream region of UMOD were sequenced.Individuals (n = 485) were selected based on presence of the GWAS risk haplotype and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the ARIC Study and on the extremes of of the UMOD gene product, uromodulin, in urine (Tamm Horsfall protein, THP) in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS). Targeted sequencing was conducted using capillary based Sanger sequencing (3730 DNA Analyzer). Variants were tested for association with THP concentrations and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and identified non-synonymous coding variants were genotyped in up to 22,546 follow-up samples. Twenty-four and 63 variants were identified in the 285 ARIC and 200 FHS participants, respectively. In both studies combined, there were 33 common and 54 rare (MAF<0.05) variants. Five non-synonymous rare variants were identified in FHS; borderline enrichment of rare variants was found in the extremes of THP (SKAT p-value = 0.08). Only V458L was associated with THP in the FHS general-population validation sample (p = 9*10(-3), n = 2,522), but did not show direction-consistent and significant association with eGFR in both the ARIC (n = 14,635) and FHS (n = 7,520) validation samples. Pooling all non-synonymous rare variants except V458L together showed non-significant associations with THP and eGFR in the FHS validation sample. Functional studies of V458L revealed no alternations in protein trafficking.Multiple novel rare variants in the UMOD region were identified, but none were consistently associated with eGFR in two independent study samples. Only V458L had modest association with THP levels in the general population and thus could not account for the observed GWAS signal."
https://openalex.org/W1993114581,"Background The study on the rare earth (RE)-doped layered double hydroxides (LDHs) has received considerable attention due to their potential applications in catalysts. However, the use of RE-doped LDHs as polymer halogen-free flame retardants was seldom investigated. Furthermore, the effect of rare earth elements on the hydrophobicity of LDHs materials and the compatibility of LDHs/polymer composite has seldom been reported. Methodology/Principal Findings The stearate sodium surface modified Ni-containing LDHs and RE-doped Ni-containing LDHs were rapidly synthesized by a coprecipitation method coupled with the microwave hydrothermal treatment. The influences of trace amounts of rare earth ions La, Ce and Nd on the amount of water molecules, the crystallinity, the morphology, the hydrophobicity of modified Ni-containing LDHs and the adsorption of modifier in the surface of LDHs were investigated by TGA, XRD, TEM, contact angle and IR, respectively. Moreover, the effects of the rare earth ions on the interfacial compatibility, the flame retardancy and the mechanical properties of ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA)/LDHs composites were also explored in detail. Conclusions/Significance S-Ni0.1MgAl-La displayed more uniform dispersion and better interfacial compatibility in EVA matrix compared with other LDHs.

https://openalex.org/W2041888890,"Control of polyene macrolide production in Streptomyces natalensis is mediated by the transcriptional activator PimR. This regulator combines an N-terminal domain corresponding to the Streptomyces antibiotic regulatory protein (SARP) family of transcriptional activators with a C-terminal half homologous to guanylate cyclases and large ATP-binding regulators of the LuxR family. The PimR SARP domain (PimRSARP) was expressed in Escherichia coli as a glutathione S-transferase (GST)–fused protein. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that GST-PimRSARP binds a single target, the intergenic region between the regulatory genes pimR and pimMs in the pimaricin cluster. The PimRSARP-binding site was investigated by DNaseI protection studies, revealing that it contains three heptameric direct repeats adjusting to the consensus 5′-CGGCAAG-3′. Transcription start points of pimM and pimR promoters were identified by 5′-RACE, revealing that unlike other SARPs, PimRSARP does not interact with the -35 region of its target promoter. Quantitative transcriptional analysis of these regulatory genes on mutants on each of them has allowed the identification of the pimM promoter as the transcriptional target for PimR. Furthermore, the constitutive expression of pimM restored pimaricin production in a pimaricin-deficient strain carrying a deletion mutant of pimR. These results reveal that PimR exerts its positive effect on pimaricin production by controlling pimM expression level, a regulator whose gene product activates transcription from eight different promoters of pimaricin structural genes directly."

https://openalex.org/W1966330027,"The introduction of non-native species into new habitats poses a major threat to native populations. Of particular interest, though often overlooked, are introductions of populations that are not fully reproductively isolated from native individuals and can hybridize with them. To address this important topic we used different approaches in a multi-pronged study, combining the effects of mate choice, shoaling behaviour and genetics. Here we present evidence that behavioural traits such as shoaling and mate choice can promote population mixing if individuals do not distinguish between native and foreign conspecifics. We examined this in the context of two guppy (Poecilia reticulata) populations that have been subject to an introduction and subsequent population mixing event in Trinidad. The introduction of Guanapo River guppies into the Turure River more than 50 years ago led to a marked reduction of the original genotype. In our experiments, female guppies did not distinguish between shoaling partners when given the choice between native and foreign individuals. Introduced fish are therefore likely to benefit from the protection of a shoal and will improve their survival chances as a result. The additional finding that male guppies do not discriminate between females on the basis of origin will further increase the process of population mixing, especially if males encounter mixed shoals. In a mesocosm experiment, in which the native and foreign populations were allowed to mate freely, we found, as expected on the basis of these behavioural interactions, that the distribution of offspring genotypes could be predicted from the proportions of the two types of founding fish. This result suggests that stochastic and environmental processes have reinforced the biological ones to bring about the genetic dominance of the invading population in the Turure River. Re-sampling the Turure for genetic analysis using SNP markers confirmed the population mixing process and showed that it is an on-going process in this river and has led to the nearly complete disappearance of the original genotype."
https://openalex.org/W2021815261,"Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is the cytokine crucial to inflammatory and immune response. Two dominant routes are populated in the folding to native structure. These distinct routes are a result of the competition between early packing of the functional loops versus closure of the β-barrel to achieve efficient folding and have been observed both experimentally and computationally. Kinetic experiments on the WT protein established that the dominant route is characterized by early packing of geometrically frustrated functional loops. However, deletion of one of the functional loops, the β-bulge, switches the dominant route to an alternative, yet, as accessible, route, where the termini necessary for barrel closure form first. Here, we explore the effect of circular permutation of the WT sequence on the observed folding landscape with a combination of kinetic and thermodynamic experiments. Our experiments show that while the rate of formation of permutant protein is always slower than that observed for the WT sequence, the region of initial nucleation for all permutants is similar to that observed for the WT protein and occurs within a similar timescale. That is, even permutants with significant sequence rearrangement in which the functional-nucleus is placed at opposing ends of the polypeptide chain, fold by the dominant WT ""functional loop-packing route"", despite the entropic cost of having to fold the N- and C- termini early. Taken together, our results indicate that the early packing of the functional loops dominates the folding landscape in active proteins, and, despite the entropic penalty of coalescing the termini early, these proteins will populate an entropically unfavorable route in order to conserve function. More generally, circular permutation can elucidate the influence of local energetic stabilization of functional regions within a protein, where topological complexity creates a mismatch between energetics and topology in active proteins."

Depending on the task, about 50%-80% of patients with schizophrenia have difficulties in maintaining SPEM. We designed a study that comprised different target velocities as well as testing for internal (extraretinal) guidance of SPEM in the absence of a visual target. We applied event-related fMRI by presenting four velocities (5, 10, 15, 20°/s) both with and without intervals of target blanking. 17 patients and 16 healthy participants were included. Eye movements were registered during scanning sessions. Statistical analysis included mixed ANOVAs and regression analyses of the target velocity on the Blood Oxygen Level Dependency (BOLD) signal. The main effect group and the interaction of velocity×group revealed reduced activation in V5 and putamen but increased activation of cerebellar regions in patients. Regression analysis showed that activation in supplementary eye field, putamen, and cerebellum was not correlated to target velocity in patients in contrast to controls. Furthermore, activation in V5 and in intraparietal sulcus (putative LIP) bilaterally was less strongly correlated to target velocity in patients than controls. Altered correlation of target velocity and neural activation in the cortical network supporting SPEM (V5, SEF, LIP, putamen) implies impaired transformation of the visual motion signal into an adequate motor command in patients. Cerebellar regions seem to be involved in compensatory mechanisms although cerebellar activity in patients was not related to target velocity."

The purpose of this study was threefold: to classify the spinal curvature based on the classification system defined by Satoh consisting of the entire spine alignment; to identify the change of trunk mobility; and to relate spinal curvature to balance disorder in a Chinese population.450 osteoporotic volunteers were recruited for this study. Spinal range of motion and global curvature were evaluated noninvasively using the Spinal-Mouse® system and sagittal postural deformities were characterized.We found a new spine postural alignment consisting of an increased thoracic kyphosis and decreased lumbar lordosis which we classified as our modified round back. We did not find any of Satoh's type 5 classification in our population. Type 2 sagittal alignment was the most common spinal deformity (38.44%). In standing, thoracic kyphosis angles in types 2 (58.34°) and 3 (58.03°) were the largest and lumbar lordosis angles in types 4 (13.95°) and 5 (-8.61°) were the smallest. The range of flexion (ROF) and range of flexion-extension (ROFE) of types 2 and 3 were usually greater than types 4 and 5, with type 1 being the largest.The present study classified and compared for the first time the mobility, curvature and balance in a Chinese population based on the entire spine alignment and found types 4 and 5 to present the worst balance and mobility. This study included a new spine postural alignment classification that should be considered in future population studies."
https://openalex.org/W2015049615,"Carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) is a hypoxia-regulated transmembrane protein over-expressed in various types of human cancer. Recently, a new peptide with affinity for human carbonic anhydrase IX (CaIX-P1) was identified using the phage display technology. Aim of the present study is to characterize the binding site in the sequence of CaIX-P1, in order to optimize the binding and metabolic properties and use it for targeting purposes.Various fragments of CaIX-P1 were synthesized on solid support using Fmoc chemistry. Alanine scanning was performed for identification of the amino acids crucial for target binding. Derivatives with increased binding affinity were radiolabeled and in vitro studies were carried out on the CA IX positive human renal cell carcinoma cell line SKRC 52 and the CA IX negative human pancreatic carcinoma cell line BxPC3. Metabolic stability was investigated in cell culture medium and human serum. Organ distribution and planar scintigraphy studies were performed in Balb/c nu/nu mice carrying subcutaneously transplanted SKRC 52 tumors. The results of our studies clearly identified amino acids that are important for target binding. Among various fragments and derivatives the ligand CaIX-P1-4-10 (NHVPLSPy) was found to possess increased binding potential in SKRC 52 cells, whereas no binding capacity for BxPC3 cells was observed. Binding of radiolabeled CaIX-P1-4-10 on CA IX positive cells could be inhibited by both the unlabeled and the native CaIX-P1 peptide but not by control peptides. Stability experiments indicated the degradation site in the sequence of CaIX-P1-4-10. Biodistribution studies showed a higher in vivo accumulation in the tumor than in most healthy tissues.Our data reveal modifications in the sequence of the CA IX affine ligand CaIX-P1 that might be favorable for improvement of target affinity and metabolic stability, which are necessary prior to the use of the ligand in clinical approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2080890481,"Given that both auditory and visual systems have anatomically separate object identification (“what”) and spatial (“where”) pathways, it is of interest whether attention-driven cross-sensory modulations occur separately within these feature domains. Here, we investigated how auditory “what” vs. “where” attention tasks modulate activity in visual pathways using cortically constrained source estimates of magnetoencephalograpic (MEG) oscillatory activity. In the absence of visual stimuli or tasks, subjects were presented with a sequence of auditory-stimulus pairs and instructed to selectively attend to phonetic (“what”) vs. spatial (“where”) aspects of these sounds, or to listen passively. To investigate sustained modulatory effects, oscillatory power was estimated from time periods between sound-pair presentations. In comparison to attention to sound locations, phonetic auditory attention was associated with stronger alpha (7–13 Hz) power in several visual areas (primary visual cortex; lingual, fusiform, and inferior temporal gyri, lateral occipital cortex), as well as in higher-order visual/multisensory areas including lateral/medial parietal and retrosplenial cortices. Region-of-interest (ROI) analyses of dynamic changes, from which the sustained effects had been removed, suggested further power increases during Attend Phoneme vs. Location centered at the alpha range 400–600 ms after the onset of second sound of each stimulus pair. These results suggest distinct modulations of visual system oscillatory activity during auditory attention to sound object identity (“what”) vs. sound location (“where”). The alpha modulations could be interpreted to reflect enhanced crossmodal inhibition of feature-specific visual pathways and adjacent audiovisual association areas during “what” vs. “where” auditory attention."
https://openalex.org/W2006169278,"We present proof-of-concept in vitro results demonstrating the feasibility of using single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) measurements to distinguish, in real time, between individual ribosomes programmed with several different, short mRNAs. For these measurements we use either the FRET signal generated between two tRNAs labeled with different fluorophores bound simultaneously in adjacent sites to the ribosome (tRNA-tRNA FRET) or the FRET signal generated between a labeled tRNA bound to the ribosome and a fluorescent derivative of ribosomal protein L1 (L1-tRNA FRET). With either technique, criteria were developed to identify the mRNAs, taking into account the relative activity of the mRNAs. These criteria enabled identification of the mRNA being translated by a given ribosome to within 95% confidence intervals based on the number of identified FRET traces. To upgrade the approach for natural mRNAs or more complex mixtures, the stoichiometry of labeling should be enhanced and photobleaching reduced. The potential for porting these methods into living cells is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2035391909,"The cotton pest, pink bollworm (Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders)), is a significant pest in most cotton-growing areas around the world. In southwestern USA and northern Mexico, pink bollworm is the target of the sterile insect technique (SIT), which relies on the mass-release of sterile pink bollworm adults to over-flood the wild population and thereby reduce it over time. Sterile moths reared for release are currently marked with a dye provided in their larval diet. There are concerns, however, that this marker fails from time to time, leading to sterile moths being misidentified in monitoring traps as wild moths. This can lead to expensive reactionary releases of sterile moths. We have developed a genetically marked strain that is engineered to express a fluorescent protein, DsRed2, which is easily screened under a specialised microscope. In order to test this marker under field conditions, we placed wild-type and genetically marked moths on traps and placed them in field cages. The moths were then screened, in a double-blind fashion, for DsRed2 fluorescence at regular intervals to determine marker reliability over time. The marker was shown to be robust in very high temperatures and generally proved reliable for a week or longer. More importantly, genotyping of moths on traps by PCR screening of the moths was 100% correct. Our findings indicate that this strain - and fluorescent protein markers in general - could make a valuable contribution to SIT."
https://openalex.org/W2038324409,"Polyparasitism is common in the developing world. We have previously demonstrated that schistosomiasis-positive (SP) Malian children have age-dependent protection from malaria compared to matched schistosomiasis-negative (SN) children. Evidence of durable immunologic memory to malaria antigens is conflicting, particularly in young children and the effect of concomitant schistomiasis upon acquisition of memory is unknown. We examined antigen-specific B memory cell (MBC) frequencies (expressed as percentage of total number of IgG-secreting cells) in 84 Malian children aged 4-14 to malaria blood-stage antigens, apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA-1) and merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP-1) and to schistosomal antigens, Soluble Worm Antigenic Preparation (SWAP) and Schistosoma Egg Antigen (SEA), at a time point during the malaria transmission season and a follow-up dry season visit. We demonstrate, for the first time, MBC responses to S. haematobium antigens in Malian children with urinary egg excretion and provide evidence of seasonal acquisition of immunologic memory, age-associated differences in MBC acquisition, and correlation with circulating S. haematobium antibody. Moreover, the presence of a parasitic co-infection resulted in older children, aged 9-14 years, with underlying S. haematobium infection having significantly more MBC response to malaria antigens (AMA1 and MSP1) than their age-matched SN counterparts. We conclude that detectable MBC response can be measured against both malaria and schistosomal antigens and that the presence of S. haematobium may be associated with enhanced MBC induction in an age-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W2036590461,"The ubiquitin-like protein ISG15 (interferon-stimulated gene of 15 kDa) is strongly induced by type I interferons and displays antiviral activity. As other ubiquitin-like proteins (Ubls), ISG15 is post-translationally conjugated to substrate proteins by an isopeptide bond between the C-terminal glycine of ISG15 and the side chains of lysine residues in the substrates (ISGylation). ISG15 consists of two ubiquitin-like domains that are separated by a hinge region. In many orthologs, this region contains a single highly reactive cysteine residue. Several hundred potential substrates for ISGylation have been identified but only a few of them have been rigorously verified. In order to investigate the modification of several ISG15 substrates, we have purified ISG15 conjugates from cell extracts by metal-chelate affinity purification and immunoprecipitations. We found that the levels of proteins modified by human ISG15 can be decreased by the addition of reducing agents. With the help of thiol blocking reagents, a mutational analysis and miRNA mediated knock-down of ISG15 expression, we revealed that this modification occurs in living cells via a disulphide bridge between the substrates and Cys78 in the hinge region of ISG15. While the ISG15 activating enzyme UBE1L is conjugated by ISG15 in the classical way, we show that the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme Ubc13 can either be classically conjugated by ISG15 or can form a disulphide bridge with ISG15 at the active site cysteine 87. The latter modification would interfere with its function as ubiquitin conjugating enzyme. However, we found no evidence for an ISG15 modification of the dynamin-like GTPases MxA and hGBP1. These findings indicate that the analysis of potential substrates for ISG15 conjugation must be performed with great care to distinguish between the two types of modification since many assays such as immunoprecipitation or metal-chelate affinity purification are performed with little or no reducing agent present."
https://openalex.org/W2049857589,"Consonants, unlike vowels, are thought to be speech specific and therefore no interactions would be expected between consonants and pitch, a basic element for musical tones. The present study used an electrophysiological approach to investigate whether, contrary to this view, there is integrative processing of consonants and pitch by measuring additivity of changes in the mismatch negativity (MMN) of evoked potentials. The MMN is elicited by discriminable variations occurring in a sequence of repetitive, homogeneous sounds. In the experiment, event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded while participants heard frequently sung consonant-vowel syllables and rare stimuli deviating in either consonant identity only, pitch only, or in both dimensions. Every type of deviation elicited a reliable MMN. As expected, the two single-deviant MMNs had similar amplitudes, but that of the double-deviant MMN was also not significantly different from them. This absence of additivity in the double-deviant MMN suggests that consonant and pitch variations are processed, at least at a pre-attentive level, in an integrated rather than independent way. Domain-specificity of consonants may depend on higher-level processes in the hierarchy of speech perception."
https://openalex.org/W2058133637,"Endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) utilizes l-arginine as its principal substrate, converting it to l-citrulline and nitric oxide (NO). l-Citrulline is recycled to l-arginine by two enzymes, argininosuccinate synthase (AS) and argininosuccinate lyase, providing the substrate arginine for eNOS and NO production in endothelial cells. Together, these three enzymes, eNOS, AS, and argininosuccinate lyase, make up the citrulline-NO cycle. Although AS catalyzes the rate-limiting step in NO production, little is known about the regulation of AS in endothelial cells beyond the level of transcription. In this study, we showed that AS Ser-328 phosphorylation was coordinately regulated with eNOS Ser-1179 phosphorylation when bovine aortic endothelial cells were stimulated by either a calcium ionophore or thapsigargin to produce NO. Furthermore, using in vitro kinase assay, kinase inhibition studies, as well as protein kinase Cα (PKCα) knockdown experiments, we demonstrate that the calcium-dependent phosphorylation of AS Ser-328 is mediated by PKCα. Collectively, these findings suggest that phosphorylation of AS at Ser-328 is regulated in accordance with the calcium-dependent regulation of eNOS under conditions that promote NO production and are in keeping with the rate-limiting role of AS in the citrulline-NO cycle of vascular endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2151254391,"Early stages of vertebrate embryogenesis are characterized by a remarkable series of shape changes. The resulting morphological complexity is driven by molecular, cellular, and tissue-scale biophysical alterations. Operating at the cellular level, extracellular matrix (ECM) networks facilitate cell motility. At the tissue level, ECM networks provide material properties required to accommodate the large-scale deformations and forces that shape amniote embryos. In other words, the primordial biomaterial from which reptilian, avian, and mammalian embryos are molded is a dynamic composite comprised of cells and ECM. Despite its central importance during early morphogenesis we know little about the intrinsic micrometer-scale surface properties of primordial ECM networks. Here we computed, using avian embryos, five textural properties of fluorescently tagged ECM networks--(a) inertia, (b) correlation, (c) uniformity, (d) homogeneity, and (e) entropy. We analyzed fibronectin and fibrillin-2 as examples of fibrous ECM constituents. Our quantitative data demonstrated differences in the surface texture between the fibronectin and fibrillin-2 network in Day 1 (gastrulating) embryos, with the fibronectin network being relatively coarse compared to the fibrillin-2 network. Stage-specific regional anisotropy in fibronectin texture was also discovered. Relatively smooth fibronectin texture was exhibited in medial regions adjoining the primitive streak (PS) compared with the fibronectin network investing the lateral plate mesoderm (LPM), at embryonic stage 5. However, the texture differences had changed by embryonic stage 6, with the LPM fibronectin network exhibiting a relatively smooth texture compared with the medial PS-oriented network. Our data identify, and partially characterize, stage-specific regional anisotropy of fibronectin texture within tissues of a warm-blooded embryo. The data suggest that changes in ECM textural properties reflect orderly time-dependent rearrangements of a primordial biomaterial. We conclude that the ECM microenvironment changes markedly in time and space during the most important period of amniote morphogenesis--as determined by fluctuating textural properties."
https://openalex.org/W1978065234,"Spontaneous disease extinction can occur due to a rare stochastic fluctuation. We explore this process, both numerically and theoretically, in two minimal models of stochastic viral infection dynamics. We propose a method that reduces the complexity in models of viral infections so that the remaining dynamics can be studied by previously developed techniques for analyzing epidemiological models. Using this technique, we obtain an expression for the infection clearance time as a function of kinetic parameters. We apply our theoretical results to study stochastic infection clearance for specific stages of HIV and HCV dynamics. Our results show that the typical time for stochastic clearance of a viral infection increases exponentially with the size of the population, but infection still can be cleared spontaneously within a reasonable time interval in a certain population of cells. We also show that the clearance time is exponentially sensitive to the viral decay rate and viral infectivity but only linearly dependent on the lifetime of an infected cell. This suggests that if standard drug therapy fails to clear an infection then intensifying therapy by adding a drug that reduces the rate of cell infection rather than immune modulators that hasten infected cell death may be more useful in ultimately clearing remaining pockets of infection."
https://openalex.org/W1994312973,"While reprogramming a foreign nucleus after somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), the enucleated oocyte (ooplasm) must signal that biomass and cellular requirements changed compared to the nucleus donor cell. Using cells expressing nuclear-encoded but mitochondria-targeted EGFP, a strategy was developed to directly distinguish maternal and embryonic products, testing ooplasm demands on transcriptional and post-transcriptional activity during reprogramming. Specifically, we compared transcript and protein levels for EGFP and other products in pre-implantation SCNT embryos, side-by-side to fertilized controls (embryos produced from the same oocyte pool, by intracytoplasmic injection of sperm containing the EGFP transgene). We observed that while EGFP transcript abundance is not different, protein levels are significantly lower in SCNT compared to fertilized blastocysts. This was not observed for Gapdh and Actb, whose protein reflected mRNA. This transcript-protein relationship indicates that the somatic nucleus can keep up with ooplasm transcript demands, whilst transcription and translation mismatch occurs after SCNT for certain mRNAs. We further detected metabolic disturbances after SCNT, suggesting a place among forces regulating post-transcriptional changes during reprogramming. Our observations ascribe oocyte-induced reprogramming with previously unsuspected regulatory dimensions, in that presence of functional proteins may no longer be inferred from mRNA, but rather depend on post-transcriptional regulation possibly modulated through metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2002778484,"Modeling sequence evolution on phylogenetic trees is a useful technique in computational biology. Especially powerful are models which take account of the heterogeneous nature of sequence evolution according to the ""grammar"" of the encoded gene features. However, beyond a modest level of model complexity, manual coding of models becomes prohibitively labor-intensive. We demonstrate, via a set of case studies, the new built-in model-prototyping capabilities of XRate (macros and Scheme extensions). These features allow rapid implementation of phylogenetic models which would have previously been far more labor-intensive. XRate 's new capabilities for lineage-specific models, ancestral sequence reconstruction, and improved annotation output are also discussed. XRate 's flexible model-specification capabilities and computational efficiency make it well-suited to developing and prototyping phylogenetic grammar models. XRate is available as part of the DART software package: http://biowiki.org/DART."

https://openalex.org/W1992602556,"The soluble monomeric domain of lipoprotein YxeF from the Gram positive bacterium B. subtilis was selected by the Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium (NESG) as a target of a biomedical theme project focusing on the structure determination of the soluble domains of bacterial lipoproteins. The solution NMR structure of YxeF reveals a calycin fold and distant homology with the lipocalin Blc from the Gram-negative bacterium E.coli. In particular, the characteristic β-barrel, which is open to the solvent at one end, is extremely well conserved in YxeF with respect to Blc. The identification of YxeF as the first lipocalin homologue occurring in a Gram-positive bacterium suggests that lipocalins emerged before the evolutionary divergence of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. Since YxeF is devoid of the α-helix that packs in all lipocalins with known structure against the β-barrel to form a second hydrophobic core, we propose to introduce a new lipocalin sub-family named 'slim lipocalins', with YxeF and the other members of Pfam family PF11631 to which YxeF belongs constituting the first representatives. The results presented here exemplify the impact of structural genomics to enhance our understanding of biology and to generate new biological hypotheses."
