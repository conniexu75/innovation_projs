https://openalex.org/W2427396309,"In the course of W-tracer studies on the biological synthesis of lecithin in lung tissue slices, the ratio of fatty acid activity to glycerol activity in lecithin was higher than in the triglyceride fraction. It was suggested that the observed isotope distributions could be due to turnover of the fatty acid portion of lecithin without a corresponding synthesis and breakdown of the remainder of the molecule (1). Such a turnover of fatty acid might require the combined actions of a phospholipase, an enzyme activity found in many tissues (2-4), and also a lysophosphatide-acylating enzyme which has not been demonstrated before. Further studies of lecithin metabolism showed that the product of phospholipase action, lysolecithin, could be utilized for lecithin synthesis by rat liver microsomes. This result is in contrast to that obtained in the chemical acylation of lysolecithin, which has been unsuccessful with several different acyl derivatives (5, 6), although Tattrie and McArthur (7) recently obtained a 31% yield of lecithin by allowing an acid chloride to react with lysolecithin in anhydrous chloroform for 3 days. It is the purpose of this paper to describe the properties of the microsomal system which catalyzes the acylation of lysolecithin to form lecithin. This reaction requires ATP and CoA, and involves the formation of an acyl-CoA derivative."

However, many of us are looking forward to the close investigation of the planets, and few inquisitive minds can fail to be intrigued by what these studies will tell of the cosmic distribution of life. To conform to the best of our contemporary science, much thoughtful insight,"

https://openalex.org/W2053840287,"IT is generally assumed that only small amounts of ethanol are metabolized outside the liver in man1,2. The results obtained when working at very low concentrations of ethanol, where the metabolic capacity of the liver is no longer fully saturated, are not consistent with this view. When the concentration of ethanol in the blood reaching the liver is below 50–60 mgm./l., the concentration in the liver vein, obtained by catheterization, has been found to be zero. If extrahepatic metabolism can be excluded the amount metabolized at these levels of ethanol must be proportional to the liver blood flow and to the concentration in the blood. Measurements of the liver blood flow by means of ethanol and bromsulphalein have shown, that the blood flow during experiments at periods similar to those mentioned below, is almost constant3,4. The amounts of ethanol metabolized can therefore be proportional only to the concentration in the blood."

https://openalex.org/W2094012726,Experimentally naive albino rats begin to press a lever for short bursts of radiant heat earlier in a 16-hour session at 2 degrees C than rats that have been living at this temperature for about a month. This difference reflects the different rates at which body temperature in the cold falls in acclimatized and nonacclimatized animals.

https://openalex.org/W2067199325,"IN 1957, Axelrod reported that epinephrine and norepinephrine were O-methylated at the C-3 position, giving metanephrine (3-O-methylepinephrine) and normetanephrine (3-O-methylnorepinephrine), respectively, in the rat1 ; in addition, he found that these compounds were normally excreted in rat urine2. The excretion of normetanephrine in the urine of humans with pheochromocytoma has also been reported3. More recently, the importance of the pathway for 3-O-methylation of epinephrine has been confirmed in man4. This report concerns the identification of metanephrine and normetanephrine of endogenous origin in the urine of normal human males."

Under a discrimination procedure, chickens responded selectively to the visual stimulus associated with food reinforcement for chirping. Control experiments demonstrated that food influenced the rate of responding because it was presented dependent on the chick's vocalizing and not because it had an innate eliciting or ""emotionalizing"" power."

Aortic intimal cells which produce mucopolysaccharides in vitro prove to be more susceptible than the nonmucopolysaccharide producing HeLa strain. This effect seems to be related to the reaction of polyanions such as ribonucleic acid, deoxyribonucleic acid, and chondroitin sulfate, with the complex cobalt salts."

https://openalex.org/W2006634018,"IN previous communications from this laboratory1–3 evidence has been presented that acid dissociations occur from the 1 : 1 cupric complexes of histidine and histamine. In the presence of equimolar cupric chloride, one equivalent of alkali additional to that needed by either of the ligands alone is required to titrate all the acid produced. When the ligand/ copper(II) ratio is 2 : 1 the amount of alkali required is the same as in the absence of the metal. From these facts it was concluded2 that a co-ordinated water molecule and not the hydrogen attached to the uncoordinated imidazole nitrogen was the source of the acid ionization from the 1 : 1 complexes. As a further test of this idea, we have investigated the copper(II) complexes of 3-methyl histamine."

https://openalex.org/W1987777670,"SINCE sickle cell anaemia is possibly related to the activity of carbonic anhydrase1, it is of interest to find some way of inhibiting the enzyme without altering the resistance of the cell membrane. Carbonic anhydrase is very stable2 but its activity can easily be changed experimentally by adjusting the pH and temperature, or by adding sulphonamides or certain inorganic ions. All these factors, however, have a marked influence on haemolysis, whereas erythrocytes seem to be rather resistant to X-rays3. We therefore decided to examine whether carbonic anhydrase could be inhibited by a dose of X-rays which would have little or no effect on haemolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2046710414,"HOUSE spraying with residual insecticides, particularly with DDT and dieldrin, plays an important part in modern anti-malaria campaigns. The tolerance of malaria vectors to these toxicants is therefore of special interest. Assessments of the susceptibility of many different species of anopheline mosquitoes before and during spraying operations have been carried out in many parts of the world1. However, nothing seems to have been published on the normal resistance-level of A. pharoensis, a vector of malaria in several countries of Africa."
