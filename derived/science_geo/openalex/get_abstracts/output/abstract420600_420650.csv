The graphene liquid cell facilitates atomic-level resolution imaging while sustaining the most realistic liquid conditions achievable under electron-beam radiation. We employ this cell to explore the mechanism of colloidal platinum nanocrystal growth. Direct atomic-resolution imaging allows us to visualize critical steps in the process, including site-selective coalescence, structural reshaping after coalescence, and surface faceting."
https://openalex.org/W2013916989,"Changing Polarization with Applied Stress The direction of electric polarization in ferroelectric materials can be switched with an applied field, but mechanical stresses can also couple to the polarization, forming the basis for piezoelectric effects. In principle, it should be possible to change the polarization of a ferroelectric material mechanically through stress gradients. Lu et al. (p. 59 ; see the Perspective by Gregg ) demonstrate such switching for nanoscale-sized regions created by the stress induced with an atomic force microscope. The substrates are single-crystalline barium titanate films that have a vertically aligned dipole moment created by compressive stresses in the film. This approach may lead to memory devices in which bits are written mechanically but read electrically."

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which reside in healthy and diseased joints, are multipotent adult stem cells that are able to differentiate into a variety of cell types. Johnson et al. (p. 717 , published online 5 April) identified a small molecule, kartogenin, which was able to induce MSCs to differentiate into chondrocytes in vitro. When administered locally, kartogenin was efficacious in two animal models of osteoarthritis."

(p. 95 ) suggest that activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex supplies a continuous signal of environmental richness predicted by foraging theory. The signal exhibits a frame of reference that is tied to the key foraging decision of whether to engage with the current choice or to search for alternatives. The same strategy is used when humans are making other types of decisions. In contrast, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, a brain region that lacks any signals pertinent to foraging, encodes choice values in a manner uninfluenced by environmental richness."
https://openalex.org/W2041579725,"Genetic exchange is common among bacteria, but its effect on population diversity during ecological differentiation remains controversial. A fundamental question is whether advantageous mutations lead to selection of clonal genomes or, as in sexual eukaryotes, sweep through populations on their own. Here, we show that in two recently diverged populations of ocean bacteria, ecological differentiation has occurred akin to a sexual mechanism: A few genome regions have swept through subpopulations in a habitat-specific manner, accompanied by gradual separation of gene pools as evidenced by increased habitat specificity of the most recent recombinations. These findings reconcile previous, seemingly contradictory empirical observations of the genetic structure of bacterial populations and point to a more unified process of differentiation in bacteria and sexual eukaryotes than previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W2011599012,"Copper-Bottomed Crust The formation of volcanic arc chains near subduction zones brings large amounts of magma from the upper mantle to the crust, contributing to the formation of island chains in the ocean and adding material to continents. Over time, arc magmas also contribute indirectly to the composition of the oceans and atmosphere through outgassing and weathering of volcanic minerals; however, it is unclear what determines the oxidized nature of arc magmas themselves. Lee et al. (p. 64 ) measured Cu contents in a range of arc-derived volcanic rocks as a proxy for arc magma redox states. An overall depletion of Cu, which is sensitive to reduced sulfur contents, in global continental crust suggests that there is a hidden reservoir of copper-rich sulfides deep in Earth's interior."
https://openalex.org/W1977975286,"Roundabout Gypsum Calcium sulfates are a common but perhaps underappreciated group of minerals used in a number of natural and industrial processes. In many ways, these crystals precipitate from solution in the same way that most other aqueous minerals form; however, mounting evidence suggests that different, unexplored mechanisms may be at work. Van Driessche et al. (p. 69 ; see the cover) performed high-resolution microscopy of the most common calcium sulfate mineral, gypsum, at various points along time-resolved, fast-quenching growth experiments. The images reveal that gypsum particles actually start out as crystalline nanoparticles of another mineral, bassanite, which then self-assemble into well-ordered nanorods. Finally, the nanorods transform into gypsum following a hydration reaction. The observation that the reaction pathway occurs below the solubility limit of the intermediate phase has wide-ranging implications for biomineralization processes and may provide ways to prevent fouling on the surfaces of desalination membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2156326705,"Normal aging and neurodegenerative diseases both lead to structural and functional alterations in synapses. Comparison of synapses that are generally similar but respond differently to insults could provide the basis for discovering mechanisms that underlie susceptibility or resistance to damage. Here, we analyzed skeletal neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) in 16 mouse muscles to seek such differences. We find that muscles respond in one of three ways to aging. In some, including most limb and trunk muscles, age-related alterations to NMJs are progressive and extensive during the second postnatal year. NMJs in other muscles, such as extraocular muscles, are strikingly resistant to change. A third set of muscles, including several muscles of facial expression and the external anal sphinter, succumb to aging but not until the third postnatal year. We asked whether susceptible and resistant muscles differed in rostrocaudal or proximodistal position, source of innervation, motor unit size, or fiber type composition. Of these factors, muscle innervation by brainstem motor neurons correlated best with resistance to age-related decline. Finally, we compared synaptic alterations in normally aging muscles to those in a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Patterns of resistance and susceptibility were strikingly correlated in the two conditions. Moreover, damage to NMJs in aged muscles correlated with altered expression and distribution of CRMP4a and TDP-43, which are both altered in motor neurons affected by ALS. Together, these results reveal novel structural, regional and molecular parallels between aging and ALS."
https://openalex.org/W2155211490,"Background Oxidative stress is known to play an important role in the pathology of traumatic brain injury. Mitochondria are thought to be the major source of the damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) following TBI. However, recent work has revealed that the membrane, via the enzyme NADPH oxidase can also generate the superoxide radical (O2−), and thereby potentially contribute to the oxidative stress following TBI. The current study thus addressed the potential role of NADPH oxidase in TBI. Methodology/Principal Findings The results revealed that NADPH oxidase activity in the cerebral cortex and hippocampal CA1 region increases rapidly following controlled cortical impact in male mice, with an early peak at 1 h, followed by a secondary peak from 24–96 h after TBI. In situ localization using oxidized hydroethidine and the neuronal marker, NeuN, revealed that the O2− induction occurred in neurons at 1 h after TBI. Pre- or post-treatment with the NADPH oxidase inhibitor, apocynin markedly inhibited microglial activation and oxidative stress damage. Apocynin also attenuated TBI-induction of the Alzheimer's disease proteins β-amyloid and amyloid precursor protein. Finally, both pre- and post-treatment of apocynin was also shown to induce significant neuroprotection against TBI. In addition, a NOX2-specific inhibitor, gp91ds-tat was also shown to exert neuroprotection against TBI. Conclusions/Significance As a whole, the study demonstrates that NADPH oxidase activity and superoxide production exhibit a biphasic elevation in the hippocampus and cortex following TBI, which contributes significantly to the pathology of TBI via mediation of oxidative stress damage, microglial activation, and AD protein induction in the brain following TBI."
https://openalex.org/W2147692999,"Prostaglandins (PGs) are important lipid mediators involved in the development of inflammatory associated pain and fever. PGE2 is a well-established endogenous pyrogen activated by proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1β. P2X7 receptors (P2X7Rs) expressed by inflammatory cells are stimulated by the danger signal extracellular ATP to activate the inflammasome and release IL-1β. Here we show that P2X7R activation is required for the release of PGE2 and other autacoids independent of inflammasome activation, with an ATP EC50 for PGE2 and IL-1β release of 1.58 and 1.23 mM, respectively. Furthermore, lack of P2X7R or specific antagonism of P2X7R decreased the febrile response in mice triggered after intraperitoneal LPS or IL-1β inoculation. Accordingly, LPS inoculation caused intraperitoneal ATP accumulation. Therefore, P2X7R antagonists emerge as novel therapeutics for the treatment for acute inflammation, pain and fever, with wider anti-inflammatory activity than currently used cyclooxygenase inhibitors.—Barberà-Cremades, M., Baroja-Mazo, A., Gomez, A.

https://openalex.org/W1963840187,"Tunneling of electrons through a potential barrier is fundamental to chemical reactions, electronic transport in semiconductors and superconductors, magnetism, and devices such as terahertz oscillators. Whereas tunneling is typically controlled by electric fields, a completely different approach is to bind electrons into bosonic quasiparticles with a photonic component. Quasiparticles made of such light-matter microcavity polaritons have recently been demonstrated to Bose-condense into superfluids, whereas spatially separated Coulomb-bound electrons and holes possess strong dipole interactions. We use tunneling polaritons to connect these two realms, producing bosonic quasiparticles with static dipole moments. Our resulting three-state system yields dark polaritons analogous to those in atomic systems or optical waveguides, thereby offering new possibilities for electromagnetically induced transparency, room-temperature condensation, and adiabatic photon-to-electron transfer."

https://openalex.org/W2077364279,"Coming Late to the Planetesimal Highly siderophile (iron-loving) elements (Re, Os, Ir, Ru, Rh, Pt, Pd, and Au) must have been added to the mantles of Earth, the Moon, and Mars after their iron cores formed; otherwise the mantles would be devoid of these elements, which tend to be segregated to the core. Dale et al. (p. 72 ) report data on highly siderophile elements in rocks from different planetary bodies, including asteroid 4 Vesta and other differentiated asteroids, which are representative of the planetesimals from which the solar system planets formed. Like the larger planetary bodies, differentiated asteroids, which formed over the first few million years of the solar system, bear the evidence of the late addition of highly siderophile elements to their mantles. Thus, this process was not unique to Earth, the Moon, and Mars and happened over an extended period of time in the inner solar system."
https://openalex.org/W2011450395,"Purpose To investigate the utility of a liposomal-iodinated nanoparticle contrast agent and computed tomography (CT) imaging for characterization of primary nodules in genetically engineered mouse models of non-small cell lung cancer. Methods Primary lung cancers with mutations in K-ras alone (KrasLA1) or in combination with p53 (LSL-KrasG12D;p53FL/FL) were generated. A liposomal-iodine contrast agent containing 120 mg Iodine/mL was administered systemically at a dose of 16 µl/gm body weight. Longitudinal micro-CT imaging with cardio-respiratory gating was performed pre-contrast and at 0 hr, day 3, and day 7 post-contrast administration. CT-derived nodule sizes were used to assess tumor growth. Signal attenuation was measured in individual nodules to study dynamic enhancement of lung nodules. Results A good correlation was seen between volume and diameter-based assessment of nodules (R2>0.8) for both lung cancer models. The LSL-KrasG12D;p53FL/FL model showed rapid growth as demonstrated by systemically higher volume changes compared to the lung nodules in KrasLA1 mice (p<0.05). Early phase imaging using the nanoparticle contrast agent enabled visualization of nodule blood supply. Delayed-phase imaging demonstrated significant differential signal enhancement in the lung nodules of LSL-KrasG12D;p53FL/FL mice compared to nodules in KrasLA1 mice (p<0.05) indicating higher uptake and accumulation of the nanoparticle contrast agent in rapidly growing nodules. Conclusions The nanoparticle iodinated contrast agent enabled visualization of blood supply to the nodules during the early-phase imaging. Delayed-phase imaging enabled characterization of slow growing and rapidly growing nodules based on signal enhancement. The use of this agent could facilitate early detection and diagnosis of pulmonary lesions as well as have implications on treatment response and monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W2085693182,"Background Prior to the onset of human labour there is an increase in the synthesis of prostaglandins, cytokines and chemokines in the fetal membranes, particular the amnion. This is associated with activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB). In this study we characterised the level of NFκB activity in amnion epithelial cells as a measure of amnion activation in samples collected from women undergoing caesarean section at 39 weeks gestation prior to the onset of labour. Methodology/Principal Findings We found that a proportion of women exhibit low or moderate NFκB activity while other women exhibit high levels of NFκB activity (n = 12). This activation process does not appear to involve classical pathways of NFκB activation but rather is correlated with an increase in nuclear p65-Rel-B dimers. To identify the full range of genes upregulated in association with amnion activation, microarray analysis was performed on carefully characterised non-activated amnion (n = 3) samples and compared to activated samples (n = 3). A total of 919 genes were upregulated in response to amnion activation including numerous inflammatory genes such cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2, 44-fold), interleukin 8 (IL-8, 6-fold), IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAP, 4.5-fold), thrombospondin 1 (TSP-1, 3-fold) and, unexpectedly, oxytocin receptor (OTR, 24-fold). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of the microarray data reveal the two main gene networks activated concurrently with amnion activation are i) cell death, cancer and morphology and ii) cell cycle, embryonic development and tissue development. Conclusions/Significance Our results indicate that assessment of amnion NFκB activation is critical for accurate sample classification and subsequent interpretation of data. Collectively, our data suggest amnion activation is largely an inflammatory event that occurs in the amnion epithelial layer as a prelude to the onset of labour."
https://openalex.org/W2071283680,"Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) involves the administration of a tumor localizing photosensitizing agent, which upon activation with light of an appropriate wavelength leads to the destruction of the tumor cells. The aim of the present study was to determine the efficacy of erythrosine as a photosensitizer for the PDT of oral malignancies. The drug uptake kinetics of erythrosine in malignant (H357) and pre-malignant (DOK) oral epithelial cells and their susceptibility to erythrosine-based PDT was studied along with the determination of the subcellular localization of erythrosine. This was followed by initial investigations into the mechanism of cell killing induced following PDT involving both high and low concentrations of erythrosine. The results showed that at 37°C the uptake of erythrosine by both DOK and H357 cells increased in an erythrosine dose dependent manner. However, the percentage of cell killing observed following PDT differed between the 2 cell lines; a maximum of ∼80% of DOK cell killing was achieved as compared to ∼60% killing for H357 cells. Both the DOK and H357 cell types exhibited predominantly mitochondrial accumulation of erythrosine, but the mitochondrial trans-membrane potential (ΔΨm) studies showed that the H357 cells were far more resistant to the changes in ΔΨm when compared to the DOK cells and this might be a factor in the apparent relative resistance of the H357 cells to PDT. Finally, cell death morphology and caspase activity analysis studies demonstrated the occurrence of extensive necrosis with high dose PDT in DOK cells, whereas apoptosis was observed at lower doses of PDT for both cell lines. For H357 cells, high dose PDT produced both apoptotic as well as necrotic responses. This is the first instance of erythrosine-based PDT's usage for cancer cell killing."
https://openalex.org/W2165528421,"In the cytoplasm of mammalian cells, either cap-binding proteins 80 and 20 (CBP80/20) or eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 4E can direct the initiation of translation. Although the recruitment of ribosomes to mRNAs during eIF4E-dependent translation (ET) is well characterized, the molecular mechanism for CBP80/20-dependent translation (CT) remains obscure. Here, we show that CBP80/20-dependent translation initiation factor (CTIF), which has been shown to be preferentially involved in CT but not ET, specifically interacts with eIF3g, a component of the eIF3 complex involved in ribosome recruitment. By interacting with eIF3g, CTIF serves as an adaptor protein to bridge the CBP80/20 and the eIF3 complex, leading to efficient ribosome recruitment during CT. Accordingly, down-regulation of CTIF using a small interfering RNA causes a redistribution of CBP80 from polysome fractions to subpolysome fractions, without significant consequence to eIF4E distribution. In addition, down-regulation of eIF3g inhibits the efficiency of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, which is tightly coupled to CT but not to ET. Moreover, the artificial tethering of CTIF to an intercistronic region of dicistronic mRNA results in translation of the downstream cistron in an eIF3-dependent manner. These findings support the idea that CT mechanistically differs from ET."
https://openalex.org/W2136523845,"Underlying mechanisms of individual variation in severity of influenza infection and response to vaccination are poorly understood. We investigated the effect of reduced heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression on vaccine response and outcome of influenza infection. HO-1-deficient and wild-type (WT) mice (kingdom, Animalia; phylum, Chordata; genus/species, Mus musculus) were infected with influenza virus A/PR/8/34 with or without prior vaccination with an adeno-viral-based influenza vaccine. A genome-wide association study evaluated the expression of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the HO-1 gene and the response to influenza vaccination in healthy humans. HO-1-deficient mice had decreased survival after influenza infection compared to WT mice (median survival 5.5 vs. 6.5 d, P=0.016). HO-1-deficient mice had impaired production of antibody following influenza vaccination compared to WT mice (mean antibody titer 869 vs. 1698, P=0.02). One SNP in HO-1 and one SNP in the constitutively expressed isoform HO-2 were independently associated with decreased antibody production after influenza vaccination in healthy human volunteers (P=0.017 and 0.014, respectively). HO-1 deficient mice were paired with sex- and age-matched WT controls. HO-1 affects the immune response to both influenza infection and vaccination, suggesting that therapeutic induction of HO-1 expression may represent a novel adjuvant to enhance influenza vaccine effectiveness.—Cummins, N.

https://openalex.org/W1979107990,"Erythropoietin acts by binding to its cell surface receptor on erythroid progenitor cells to stimulate erythrocyte production. Erythropoietin receptor expression in nonhematopoietic tissue, including skeletal muscle progenitor cells, raises the possibility of a role for erythropoietin beyond erythropoiesis. Mice with erythropoietin receptor restricted to hematopoietic tissue were used to assess contributions of endogenous erythropoietin to promote skeletal myoblast proliferation and survival and wound healing in a mouse model of cardiotoxin induced muscle injury. Compared with wild-type controls, these mice had fewer skeletal muscle Pax-7(+) satellite cells and myoblasts that do not proliferate in culture, were more susceptible to skeletal muscle injury and reduced maximum load tolerated by isolated muscle. In contrast, mice with chronic elevated circulating erythropoietin had more Pax-7(+) satellite cells and myoblasts with increased proliferation and survival in culture, decreased muscle injury, and accelerated recovery of maximum load tolerated by isolated muscle. Skeletal muscle myoblasts also produced endogenous erythropoietin that increased at low O(2). Erythropoietin promoted proliferation, survival, and wound recovery in myoblasts via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT pathway. Therefore, endogenous and exogenous erythropoietin contribute to increasing satellite cell number following muscle injury, improve myoblast proliferation and survival, and promote repair and regeneration in this mouse induced muscle injury model independent of its effect on erythrocyte production."
https://openalex.org/W1982614851,"Prions are misfolded, aggregated conformers of the prion protein that can be transmitted between species. The precise determinants of interspecies transmission remain unclear, although structural similarity between the infectious prion and host prion protein is required for efficient conversion to the misfolded conformer. The β2-α2 loop region of endogenous prion protein, PrP(C), has been implicated in barriers to prion transmission. We recently discovered that conversion was efficient when incoming and host prion proteins had similar β2-α2 loop structures; however, the roles of primary vs. secondary structural homology could not be distinguished. Here we uncouple the effect of primary and secondary structural homology of the β2-α2 loop on prion conversion. We inoculated prions from animals having a disordered or an ordered β2-α2 loop into mice having a disordered loop or an ordered loop due to a single residue substitution (D167S). We found that prion conversion was driven by a homologous primary structure and occurred independently of a homologous secondary structure. Similarly, cell-free conversion using PrP(C) from mice with disordered or ordered loops and prions from 5 species correlated with primary but not secondary structural homology of the loop. Thus, our findings support a model in which efficient interspecies prion conversion is determined by small stretches of the primary sequence rather than the secondary structure of PrP."
https://openalex.org/W2168044147,"Infectious complications, predominantly pneumonia, are the most common cause of death in the postacute phase of stroke, although the mechanisms underlying the corresponding immunosuppression are not fully understood. We tested the hypothesis that activation of the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) pathway is important in the stroke-induced increase in lung injury caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia in mice. Prior stroke increased lung vascular permeability caused by P. aeruginosa pneumonia and was associated with decreased lung neutrophil recruitment and bacterial clearance in mice. Pharmacologic inhibition (methyllycaconitine IC50: 0.2–0.6 nM) or genetic deletion of the α7nAChR significantly (P< 0.05) attenuates the effect of prior stroke on lung injury and mortality caused by P. aeruginosa pneumonia in mice. Finally, pretreatment with PNU-282987, a pharmacologic activator of the α7nAChR (EC50: 0.2 μM), significantly (P<0.05) increased lung injury caused by P. aeruginosa pneumonia, significantly (P<0.05) decreased the release of KC, a major neutrophil chemokine, and significantly (P<0.05) decreased intracellular bacterial killing by a mouse alveolar macrophage cell line and primary mouse neutrophils. In summary, the α7 nicotinic cholinergic pathway plays an important role in mediating the systemic immunosuppression observed after stroke and directly contributes to more severe lung damage induced by P. aeruginosa.—Lafargue, M., Xu, L., Carles, M., Serve, E., Anjum, N., Iles, K.

https://openalex.org/W2064024041,"Expression of the four transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc (OSKM) is sufficient to reprogram somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem (iPSCs). However, this process is slow and inefficient compared with the fusion of somatic cells with embryonic stem cells (ESCs), indicating that ESCs express additional factors that can enhance the efficiency of reprogramming. We had previously developed a method to detect and isolate early neural induction intermediates during the differentiation of mouse ESCs. Using the gene expression profiles of these intermediates, we identified 23 ESC-specific transcripts and tested each for the ability to enhance iPSC formation. Of the tested factors, zinc finger protein 296 (Zfp296) led to the largest increase in mouse iPSC formation. We confirmed that Zfp296 was specifically expressed in pluripotent stem cells and germ cells. Zfp296 in combination with OSKM induced iPSC formation earlier and more efficiently than OSKM alone. Through mouse chimera and teratoma formation, we demonstrated that the resultant iPSCs were pluripotent. We showed that Zfp296 activates transcription of the Oct4 gene via the germ cell–specific conserved region 4 (CR4), and when overexpressed in mouse ESCs leads to upregulation of Nanog expression and downregulation of the expression of differentiation markers, including Sox17, Eomes, and T, which is consistent with the observation that Zfp296 enhances the efficiency of reprogramming. In contrast, knockdown of Zfp296 in ESCs leads to the expression of differentiation markers. Finally, we demonstrated that expression of Zfp296 in ESCs inhibits, but does not block, differentiation into neural cells."

https://openalex.org/W2081696090,"HoxA10 is a member of a highly conserved family of homeodomain transcription factors that are involved in definitive hematopoiesis and implicated in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). During normal hematopoiesis, HoxA10 facilitates myeloid progenitor expansion and impedes myeloid differentiation. To better understand the molecular mechanisms that control these events, we have been identifying and characterizing HoxA10 target genes. In this study, we identified the gene encoding fibroblast growth factor 2 (Fgf2 or basic fibroblast growth factor) as a target gene that is relevant to the biological effects of HoxA10. We identified two cis elements in the proximal FGF2 promoter that are activated by HoxA10 in myeloid progenitor cells and differentiating phagocytes. We determined that Fgf2 expression and secretion are regulated in a HoxA10-dependent manner in these cells. We found that increased Fgf2 production by HoxA10-overexpressing myeloid progenitor cells induced a phosphoinositol 3-kinase-dependent increase in β-catenin protein. This resulted in autocrine stimulation of proliferation in HoxA10-overexpressing cells and hypersensitivity to other cytokines that share this pathway. Therefore, these studies identified expression of Fgf2 as a mechanism by which HoxA10 controls the size of the myeloid progenitor population. These studies also suggested that aberrant production of Fgf2 may contribute to leukemogenesis in the subset of AML with dysregulated Hox expression. Therapeutic targeting of Fgf2-stimulated signaling pathways might be a rational approach to this poor prognosis subset of AML."

In hamsters painted with DMBA, the expression of 1,700 genes was found to be altered significantly relative to control. Dietary supplementation of chlorophyllin and ellagic acid modulated the expression profiles of 104 and 37 genes respectively. Microarray analysis also revealed changes in the expression of TGFβ receptors, NF-κB, cyclin D1, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that may play a crucial role in the transformation of the normal buccal pouch to a malignant phenotype.

Thus dietary chlorophyllin and ellagic acid that can reverse gene expression signature associated with carcinogenesis are novel candidates for cancer prevention and therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2063714301,"Transglutaminase 2 (TG2) is a ubiquitously expressed enzyme that cross-links proteins and its overexpression, linked to a drug resistant phenotype, is commonly observed in cancer cells. Further, up-regulation of TG2 expression occurs during response to various forms of cell stress; however, the molecular mechanisms that drive inducible expression of the TG2 gene (TGM2) require elucidation. Here we show that genotoxic stress induces TG2 expression through the Ataxia-Telangiectasia, Mutated (ATM)/Nuclear Factor κ light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB) signaling pathway. We further document that NFκB is both necessary and sufficient to drive constitutive TG2 expression in cultured cell lines. Additionally, shRNA-mediated knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of the ATM kinase results in reduced constitutive TG2 expression and NFκB transcriptional activity. We document that the NFκB subunit p65 (RelA) interacts with two independent consensus NFκB binding sites within the TGM2 promoter, that mutation of either site or pharmacological inhibition of NFκB reduces TGM2 promoter activity, and genotoxic stress drives heightened association of p65 with the TGM2 promoter. Finally, we observed that knockdown of either p65 or ATM in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells expressing recombinant TG2 partially reduces resistance to doxorubicin, indicating that the drug resistance linked to overexpression of TG2 functions, in part, through p65 and ATM. This work establishes a novel ATM-dependent signaling loop where TG2 and NFκB activate each other resulting in sustained activation of NFκB and acquisition of a drug-resistant phenotype."

However, there are no known clinically relevant biomarkers to predict metastasis.To investigate differential gene expression signatures of metastatic vs non-metastatic NETs, we studied cell cycle regulatory genes in 19 metastatic and 22 non-metastatic colorectal NETs by PCR arrays. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantitative real-time RT-PCR were performed to verify the results and another set of 38 GEP-NETs were further studied for validation.We first delineated six candidate genes for metastasis including ATM, CCND2, RBL2, CDKN3, CCNB1, and GTSE1. ATM was negatively correlated with metastatic NETs (p<0.001) with more than 2-fold change compared to non-metastatic NETs. Overexpression of ATM protein by IHC was strongly correlated with high ATM mRNA levels and low Ki-67 labeling index. Patients with ATM-negativity by IHC showed significantly decreased overall survival than patients with ATM-positivity (median OS, metastatic vs non-metastatic NETs; 2.7 years vs not reached; p = 0.003) and 85.7% of metastatic NETs were ATM-negative. In another validation set of GEP-NETs, decreased mRNA of ATM gene was associated with metastasis and remained significant (p = 0.023).ATM down-regulation was strongly associated with metastatic NETs when compared with non-metastatic NETs and ATM may be a potential predictive marker for metastasis as well as a novel target in metastatic GEP-NETs."
https://openalex.org/W2091238258,"Inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) is generated by ATP hydrolysis in the cells and also present in extracellular matrix, cartilage and bodily fluids. Fueling an alternative pathway for energy production in cells, PPi is hydrolyzed by inorganic pyrophosphatase (PPA1) in a highly exergonic reaction that can under certain conditions substitute for ATP-derived energy. Recombinant PPA1 is used for energy-regeneration in the cell-free systems used to study the zymology of ATP-dependent ubiquitin-proteasome system, including the role of sperm-borne proteasomes in mammalian fertilization. Inspired by an observation of reduced in vitro fertilization (IVF) rates in the presence of external, recombinant PPA1, this study reveals, for the first time, the presence of PPi, PPA1 and PPi transporter, progressive ankylosis protein ANKH in mammalian spermatozoa. Addition of PPi during porcine IVF increased fertilization rates significantly and in a dose-dependent manner. Fluorometric assay detected high levels of PPi in porcine seminal plasma, oviductal fluid and spermatozoa. Immunofluorescence detected PPA1 in the postacrosomal sheath (PAS) and connecting piece of boar spermatozoa; ANKH was present in the sperm head PAS and equatorial segment. Both ANKH and PPA1 were also detected in human and mouse spermatozoa, and in porcine spermatids. Higher proteasomal-proteolytic activity, indispensable for fertilization, was measured in spermatozoa preserved with PPi. The identification of an alternative, PPi dependent pathway for ATP production in spermatozoa elevates our understanding of sperm physiology and sets the stage for the improvement of semen extenders, storage media and IVF media for animal biotechnology and human assisted reproductive therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2082969806,"Practice improves human performance in many psychophysical paradigms. This kind of improvement is thought to be the evidence of human brain plasticity. However, the changes that occur in the brain are not fully understood.The N2pc component has previously been associated with visuo-spatial attention. In this study, we used event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate whether the N2pc component changed during long-term visual perceptual learning. Thirteen subjects completed several days of training in an orientation discrimination task, and were given a final test 30 days later. The results showed that behavioral thresholds significantly decreased across training sessions, and this decrement was also present in the untrained visual field. ERPs showed training significantly increased the N2pc amplitude, and this effect could be maintained for up to 30 days. However, the increase in N2pc was specific to the trained visual field.Training caused spatial attention to be increasingly focused on the target positions. However, this process was not transferrable from the trained to the untrained visual field, which suggests that the increase in N2pc may be unnecessary for behavioral improvements in the untrained visual field."
https://openalex.org/W1973540767,"The vestibular nuclear complex (VNC) consists of a collection of sensory relay nuclei that integrates and relays information essential for coordination of eye movements, balance, and posture. Spanning the majority of the hindbrain alar plate, the rhombomere (r) origin and projection pattern of the VNC have been characterized in descriptive works using neuroanatomical tracing. However, neither the molecular identity nor developmental regulation of individual nucleus of the VNC has been determined. To begin to address this issue, we found that Hoxb1 is required for the anterior-posterior (AP) identity of precursors that contribute to the lateral vestibular nucleus (LVN). Using a gene-targeted Hoxb1-GFP reporter in the mouse, we show that the LVN precursors originate exclusively from r4 and project to the spinal cord in the stereotypic pattern of the lateral vestibulospinal tract that provides input into spinal motoneurons driving extensor muscles of the limb. The r4-derived LVN precursors express the transcription factors Phox2a and Lbx1, and the glutamatergic marker Vglut2, which together defines them as dB2 neurons. Loss of Hoxb1 function does not alter the glutamatergic phenotype of dB2 neurons, but alters their stereotyped spinal cord projection. Moreover, at the expense of Phox2a, the glutamatergic determinants Lmx1b and Tlx3 were ectopically expressed by dB2 neurons. Our study suggests that the Hox genes determine the AP identity and diversity of vestibular precursors, including their output target, by coordinating the expression of neurotransmitter determinant and target selection properties along the AP axis."

https://openalex.org/W2065132149,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), is a major global health threat. During infection, bacteria are believed to encounter adverse conditions such as iron depletion. Mycobacteria synthesize iron-sequestering mycobactins, which are essential for survival in the host, via the intermediate salicylate. Salicylate is a ubiquitous compound which is known to induce a mild antibiotic resistance phenotype. In M. tuberculosis salicylate highly induces the expression of Rv0560c, a putative methyltransferase. We identified and characterized the promoter and regulatory elements of Rv0560c. P(Rv0560c) activity was highly inducible by salicylate in a dose-dependent manner. The induction kinetics of P(Rv0560c) were slow, taking several days to reach maximal activity, which was sustained over several weeks. Promoter activity could also be induced by compounds structurally related to salicylate, such as aspirin or para-aminosalicylic acid, but not by benzoate, indicating that induction is specific to a structural motif. The -10 and -35 promoter elements were identified and residues involved in regulation of promoter activity were identified in close proximity to an inverted repeat spanning the -35 promoter element. We conclude that Rv0560c expression is controlled by a yet unknown repressor via a highly-inducible promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2139944895,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system. The proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) into the β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide is a central event in AD. While the pathway that generates Aβ is well described, many questions remain concerning general APP metabolism and its metabolites. It is becoming clear that the amino-terminal region of APP can be processed to release small N-terminal fragments (NTFs). The purpose of this study was to investigate the occurrence and generation of APP NTFs in vivo and in cell culture (SH-SY5Y) in order to delineate the cellular pathways implicated in their generation. We were able to detect 17- to 28-kDa APP NTFs in human and mouse brain tissue that are distinct from N-APP fragments previously reported. We show that the 17- to 28-kDa APP NTFs were highly expressed in mice from the age of 2 wk to adulthood. SH-SY5Y studies indicate the generation of APP NTFs involves a novel APP processing pathway, regulated by protein kinase C, but independent of α-secretase or β-secretase 1 (BACE) activity. These results identify a novel, developmentally regulated APP processing pathway that may play an important role in the physiological function of APP.—Vella, L. J., Cappai, R.

https://openalex.org/W2021766416,"Background Dendritic spines are small membranous protrusions on the neuronal dendrites that receive synaptic input from axon terminals. Despite their importance for integrating the enormous information flow in the brain, the molecular mechanisms regulating spine morphogenesis are not well understood. NESH/Abi-3 is a member of the Abl interactor (Abi) protein family, and its overexpression is known to reduce cell motility and tumor metastasis. NESH is prominently expressed in the brain, but its function there remains unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings NESH was strongly expressed in the hippocampus and moderately expressed in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum and striatum, where it co-localized with the postsynaptic proteins PSD95, SPIN90 and F-actin in dendritic spines. Overexpression of NESH reduced numbers of mushroom-type spines and synapse density but increased thin, filopodia-like spines and had no effect on spine density. siRNA knockdown of NESH also reduced mushroom spine numbers and inhibited synapse formation but it increased spine density. The N-terminal region of NESH co-sedimented with filamentous actin (F-actin), which is an essential component of dendritic spines, suggesting this interaction is important for the maturation of dendritic spines. Conclusions/Significance NESH is a novel F-actin binding protein that likely plays important roles in the regulation of dendritic spine morphogenesis and synapse formation."
https://openalex.org/W2119207982,"Binocular vision is traditionally treated as two processes: the fusion of similar images, and the interocular suppression of dissimilar images (e.g. binocular rivalry). Recent work has demonstrated that interocular suppression is phase-insensitive, whereas binocular summation occurs only when stimuli are in phase. But how do these processes affect our perception of binocular contrast? We measured perceived contrast using a matching paradigm for a wide range of interocular phase offsets (0–180°) and matching contrasts (2–32%). Our results revealed a complex interaction between contrast and interocular phase. At low contrasts, perceived contrast reduced monotonically with increasing phase offset, by up to a factor of 1.6. At higher contrasts the pattern was non-monotonic: perceived contrast was veridical for in-phase and antiphase conditions, and monocular presentation, but increased a little at intermediate phase angles. These findings challenge a recent model in which contrast perception is phase-invariant. The results were predicted by a binocular contrast gain control model. The model involves monocular gain controls with interocular suppression from positive and negative phase channels, followed by summation across eyes and then across space. Importantly, this model—applied to conditions with vertical disparity—has only a single (zero) disparity channel and embodies both fusion and suppression processes within a single framework."

Sandmeyer S.B. Ty3 integrates within the region of RNA polymerase III transcription initiation.Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, despite this unusual insertion specificity, Ty3 has substantial structural and functional similarity to retroviruses (16.Sandmeyer S.B. Aye M. Menees T.M. Saccharomyces cerevisiae.in: Craig N.L. Craigie R. Martin G. Lambowitz A.M. Mobile DNA II. ASM Press, Washington D. C2002: 663-682Crossref Google Scholar). For example, cells expressing Ty3 accumulate VLPs containing processed Ty3 proteins and cDNA and the Ty3 IN has a conserved core domain that contains residues conserved among retroviral integrases, including the D, DX35E catalytic motif of polynucleotide esterases. Although the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains of IN proteins are generally less-well conserved, they contain a zinc finger and a GPY/F motif, respectively. These motifs are also found in the Ty3 IN protein (17.Malik H.S. Eickbush T.H. Modular evolution of the integrase domain in the Ty3/Gypsy class of LTR retrotransposons.J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5186-5190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to retroviral cDNA, the Ty3 cDNA has LTRs and terminates with two “extra” bp at each end, which are endonucleolytically removed from the 3′-ends by Ty3 IN prior to strand transfer (18.Kirchner J. Sandmeyer S.B. Ty3 integrase mutants defective in reverse transcription or 3′-end processing of extrachromosomal Ty3 DNA.J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4737-4747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the retrovirus model, the resulting 3′-hydroxyls mediate SN2 nucleophilic attacks at staggered positions in the duplex chromosomal DNA. These positions are offset by 5 nts so that concerted strand transfer generates the characteristic 5-bp direct repeats flanking the ends of Ty3 insertions. These similarities to retroviruses coupled with precise targeting make Ty3 an attractive model for probing the mechanisms by which targeting proteins might interact with the retroelement intasome. However, a biochemically defined in vitro system that recapitulates the natural specificity of any retroelement including Ty3 has been lacking. We describe such a system here and use it to investigate Ty3 substrate and target sequences that influence integration.

Requirement of RNA polymerase III transcription factors for in vitro position-specific integration of a retroviruslike element.Science. 1995; 267: 1488-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Ty3 VLP-mediated cDNA strand transfer differs from Pol III transcription initiation in that it can be targeted by Brf1 and TBP without introduction of heteroduplex DNA at the TSS (24.Yieh L. Hatzis H. Kassavetis G. Sandmeyer S.B. Mutational analysis of the transcription factor IIIB-DNA target of Ty3 retroelement integration.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25920-25928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, the requirement of Ty3 for TFIIIB and TFIIIC for integration at most tRNAs and for TFIIIB or even Brf1 and TBP at SNR6 complicates identification of interactions key to targeting. In order to better define the activities required for Ty3 strand-transfer targeting, we examined whether TFP could replace TBP and Brf1 as was found for Pol III transcription. The TATA box upstream of SNR6 can bind TBP in either orientation and thus mediate bi-directional transcription initiation at upstream (SNR6 distal) and downstream (SNR6 proximal) sites (31.Whitehall S.K. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. The symmetry of the yeast U6 RNA gene's TATA box and the orientation of the TATA-binding protein in yeast TFIIIB.Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2974-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A related variant on plasmid pLY1855 supports Ty3 integration at both initiation sites (25.Yieh L. Kassavetis G. Geiduschek E.P. Sandmeyer S.B. The Brf and TATA-binding protein subunits of the RNA polymerase III transcription factor IIIB mediate position-specific integration of the gypsy-like element, Ty3.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29800-29807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This target plasmid was combined with bacterially-expressed TFIIIB (TBP, Brf1, and Bdp1) or TFP and Ty3 VLPs were added as the source of integration activity and cDNA (25.Yieh L. Kassavetis G. Geiduschek E.P. Sandmeyer S.B. The Brf and TATA-binding protein subunits of the RNA polymerase III transcription factor IIIB mediate position-specific integration of the gypsy-like element, Ty3.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29800-29807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Strand transfer was assayed using a PCR primed by cDNA- and target plasmid-specific oligonucleotides (Fig. 1A). Products consistent with TFIIIB bound to the TATA box in each orientation were observed in positive control reactions containing TFIIIB and VLPs (Fig. 1B, lane 1) (25.Yieh L. Kassavetis G. Geiduschek E.P. Sandmeyer S.B. The Brf and TATA-binding protein subunits of the RNA polymerase III transcription factor IIIB mediate position-specific integration of the gypsy-like element, Ty3.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29800-29807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and in a test reaction containing TFP (Fig. 1B, lane 2), but not in reactions containing only VLPs (Fig. 1B, lane 3). Therefore, non-conserved TBP residues 1–60 and Brf1 region 383–438, which contains HR I and the HRI-II spacer, both of which are lacking in TFP, are dispensable for targeting Ty3 strand transfer to Pol III TSS. A remaining major limitation in defining the Ty3 components required for targeting was the requirement for a complex VLP fraction as the source of both IN and cDNA. Although it might be anticipated that IN would directly mediate specificity, recent findings in the retrovirus system indicate that domains within some retroviral Gag proteins have the capacity to influence integration patterns (2.Delelis O. Zamborlini A. Thierry S. Saïb A. Chromosomal tethering and proviral integration.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1799: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). A system was therefore developed in which recombinant IN and duplex oligonucleotides were substituted for VLPs. These strategies were previously used to reconstitute the retroviral strand-transfer reaction (32.Bushman F.D. Craigie R. Activities of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) integration protein in vitro: specific cleavage and integration of HIV DNA.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 1339-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), although the greater size of the Ty3 IN complicated direct adoption of those protocols. The portion of POL3 encoding the 61-kDa Ty3 IN was tagged with 6× His and recoded for bacterial expression (23.Larsen L.S. Wassman C.D. Hatfield G.W. Lathrop R.H. Computationally optimized DNA assembly of synthetic genes.Int. J. Bioinform Res. Appl. 2008; 4: 324-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Wt IN and a catalytic site mutant (D225E/E261D) derivative (18.Kirchner J. Sandmeyer S.B. Ty3 integrase mutants defective in reverse transcription or 3′-end processing of extrachromosomal Ty3 DNA.J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4737-4747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were expressed in Escherichia coli. These recombinant IN proteins were purified by nickel affinity chromatography. A duplex oligonucleotide containing 23 nt with complementarity to a PCR primer followed by 20 nt representing the downstream (U5) end of the unprocessed Ty3 LTR and a non-transferred, complementary strand of 45 nt were introduced into the in vitro strand-transfer reaction to substitute for unprocessed VLP cDNA. An identical substrate lacking two nts from the U5 3′-end (“pre-processed”) was also tested (Fig. 2A). IN, duplex pre-processed substrates, SNR6 DNA and TFP were combined in the strand-transfer reaction. Products of this reaction were used to template PCR primed with oligonucleotides complementary to the substrate and plasmid target. The reactions including wt IN generated fragments of the size expected for Ty3 strand transfer at the divergent TSS (Fig. 2B, lane 4; Fig. 2C, lanes 1 and 2); the D22E/E261D mutant IN failed to generate these products (data not shown). Sequence analysis of four independent reactions identified eleven distinct joints of targeted strand transfers. The majority of joints were distributed within one or two nt of the TSS on the template strand or offset upstream by five nt on the nontemplate strand (Fig. 2D). A similar amount of product was generated in reactions using unprocessed duplexes (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 1 and 2). In addition, sequence analysis of strand-transfer products of the blunt substrate showed that the junction occurred at the terminal CA, so that strand transfer was preceded by removal of two nt from the 3′-end of the duplex (data not shown). These assays demonstrated for the first time that Ty3 IN is the sole Ty3 protein required to process 3′ extra nts and target strand transfer to the Pol III transcription initiation site. Terminal IR are a signature feature of integrated transposons and retroviruses with TG/CA being virtually universally conserved. Upstream of the conserved dinucleotide the two ends can have distinct sequences and in vitro evolution of IN substrates has shown that additional variation is possible in the absence of requirements for replication (33.Zhou H. Rainey G.J. Wong S.K. Coffin J.M. Substrate sequence selection by retroviral integrase.J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1359-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). As discussed above, in the cDNA the IR copies are flanked on the outside ends by 2 “extra” bp which are removed during integration. Ty3 has a terminal 8-bp IR and 2 extra bp (plus strand, 5′-gaTGTTGTAT-3′ … ATACAACAcc-3′). U5 oligonucleotide substrates substituted in the outside ends of the IR (CA, wt; TA, CG, TG, mutants) and a duplex oligonucleotide in which the terminal Ty3 sequence was randomized, were assayed for strand transfer (Fig. 2C). This assay showed little difference in activity among reactions using blunt or pre-processed substrates with IR sequences ending in wt CA or mutant TA (Fig. 2C, lanes 1–4). Strand-transfer products were not generated from the randomized oligonucleotide substrate (Fig. 2C, lane 9). Significantly less strand transfer was observed for processed and blunt substrates with IR ending in G, rather than wt A (Fig. 2C, lanes 5–8). In addition, among the latter templates, more strand transfer was observed for preprocessed substrates indicating that processing was sensitive to mutations of the terminal “A” (Fig. 2C, lanes 5–8). In the case of in vitro relative rate assays of HIV-1 and Ty1 and Tf1 retrotransposon IN proteins, 3′-end processing of the two extra nt was blocked by mutations in the IR terminal “A” and was greatly reduced by changes in the conserved penultimate IR “C” (34.Esposito D. Craigie R. Sequence specificity of viral end DNA binding by HIV-1 integrase reveals critical regions for protein-DNA interaction.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5832-5843Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) for Ty1 (35.Sharon G. Burkett T.J. Garfinkel D.J. Efficient homologous recombination of Ty1 element cDNA when integration is blocked.Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 6540-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and Tf1 (36.Hizi A. Levin H.L. The integrase of the long terminal repeat-retrotransposon Tf1 has a chromodomain that modulates integrase activities.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39086-39094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although these strand-transfer assays combined with PCR detection are unlikely to be as sensitive to perturbation as real time enzymatic assays, they showed that Ty3 IN activity is sensitive to changes in the terminal IR. Retroviral IN proteins display robust in vitro strand-transfer activity in the absence of host targeting factors. In the case of Ty3 IN, strand-transfer assays did not show evidence of a default nonspecific pathway. Nonetheless, this activity would yield more diffuse products in our assay and therefore be more difficult to detect than specific strand transfer. Therefore, the ability of IN to interact with target DNA was reinvestigated using a more direct assay. A 57-bp duplex oligonucleotide DNA containing the SNR6 TATA element was used to represent the target DNA. An identical duplex was previously used to measure binding of TFP specifically to TATA-containing DNA (22.Kassavetis G.A. Soragni E. Driscoll R. Geiduschek E.P. Reconfiguring the connectivity of a multiprotein complex: fusions of yeast TATA-binding protein with Brf1, and the function of transcription factor IIIB.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 15406-15411Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Over a range of IN concentrations, no interaction between IN and the target DNA was observed (Fig. 3, left panel). In contrast, as reported previously, addition of TFP alone retarded mobility of the SNR6 target duplex (22.Kassavetis G.A. Soragni E. Driscoll R. Geiduschek E.P. Reconfiguring the connectivity of a multiprotein complex: fusions of yeast TATA-binding protein with Brf1, and the function of transcription factor IIIB.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 15406-15411Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the presence of TFP, supershifting of the TATA-containing duplex was proportional to the amount of IN (Fig. 3, middle panel). However, this interaction was weak for both wt IN and a catalytic site mutant (data not shown). Overall, these results support a model in which the Ty3 intasome interactions with Pol III promoters is mediated by direct interaction of Ty3 IN with Brf1 and TBP components of TFIIIB. This model is similar to what has been proposed for targeting of Ty5 (37.Xie W. Gai X. Zhu Y. Zappulla D.C. Sternglanz R. Voytas D.F. Targeting of the yeast Ty5 retrotransposon to silent chromatin is mediated by interactions between integrase and Sir4p.Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 6606-6614Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and Tf1 (15.Leem Y.E. Ripmaster T.L. Kelly F.D. Ebina H. Heincelman M.E. Zhang K. Grewal S.I. Hoffman C.S. Levin H.L. Retrotransposon Tf1 is targeted to Pol II promoters by transcription activators.Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 98-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) integration by IN tethering to target-bound proteins. In vitro substitution of the natural MgCl2 metal cofactor with MnCl2 in the case of HIV-1 IN reduces specificity for cDNA termini (34.Esposito D. Craigie R. Sequence specificity of viral end DNA binding by HIV-1 integrase reveals critical regions for protein-DNA interaction.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5832-5843Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and enhances activity in disintegration assays (38.Hickman A.B. Palmer I. Engelman A. Craigie R. Wingfield P. Biophysical and enzymatic properties of the catalytic domain of HIV-1 integrase.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29279-29287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test the effect of MnCl2 on the association of Ty3 IN with its target, MgCl2 was either supplemented or substituted with MnCl2 in the strand-transfer reactions. PCR analysis of products of MnCl2-containing reactions showed surprisingly that strand transfer was dependent upon IN, but independent of TFP (Fig. 4A). Strand transfer was not observed for the randomized oligonucleotide substrate in the presence of MnCl2, indicating that it required specific interactions with IN (data not shown). Reactions containing VLPs showed only a low level of non-targeted products in the presence of MnCl2 (supplemental Fig. S1). In the presence of MnCl2, TFP shifted the TATA-containing probe indicating that MnCl2 does not produce TFP-independent strand transfer by disruption of TFP binding (Fig. 3, right panel). However, the IN supershift was no longer observed, suggesting that the presence of MnCl2 affected the interaction between TFP and IN. The PCR amplicon from products generated in the presence of MnCl2 concentrations greater than 10 mm in the presence or absence of TFP was ∼300 bp (Fig. 4, A and B). Experiments were performed in which MnCl2 or MgCl2 was increased in the absence or presence of the other metal cation and the products were amplified using PCR (Fig. 4B and data not shown). In high MgCl2 and low MnCl2 bands representing products of strand transfers flanking the TFP binding site were observed as previously described. However increasing MnCl2 correlated with increasing amounts of higher molecular weight products including a major product of about 300 bp and decreasing amounts of lower molecular weight products (Fig. 4B). Since these products were clearly discrete from previously observed targeted strand-transfer products, products of three independent reactions were cloned and submitted for sequencing. This analysis showed strand transfer mainly within a small region. Among the six sites revealed by sequencing, four occurred within a 5-bp region from −231 to −226 upstream of SNR6 and the others occurred at positions −285 and −125 (Fig. 4C). One possibility was that strand transfer at a secondary TFP-binding site occurred in the presence of MnCl2. However, inspection failed to identify TATA-like sequences, and insertions were independent of TFP (Fig. 4A). Instead, the sequence (5′-TGTTGTGT-3′/3′-ACAACACA-5′) resembling the terminal IR sequence of Ty3 (5′-TGTTGTAT-3′/3′-ACAACATA-5′) was identified between −213 and −205 upstream of SNR6. The four clustered positions of strand transfer occurred 13 to 18 nt upstream of the 5′-end of this sequence (Fig. 4C). The strand-transfer products recovered in the vicinity of plasmid sequences resembling the Ty3 IR suggested that IN might confer sequence specificity to strand transfer under some conditions. To directly test whether Ty3 IN targeted Ty3 IR-like sequences, a plasmid containing an isolated Ty3 LTR truncated at the downstream end to remove one IR (pXQ2889) was used as a target (Fig. 4D). Strand-transfer assays were performed using MnCl2 as the cation and the preprocessed U5 oligonucleotide duplex substrate. PCR templated by products of this reaction showed dominant fragments of about 300 bp (Fig. 4D, lane 1). The mixed PCR products were cloned and sequences of six clones were determined. This analysis showed strand-transfer joints at positions −13, −9, and −7 relative to the outside end of the target Ty3 LTR (5′-TGTTGTAT-3′). To assess the distribution of target sites more completely, cloned strand-transfer products at these positions were used as templates to obtain 32P-labeled markers. Migration of these markers was compared with that of products of an independent strand-transfer reaction. Comparison of the distribution of PCR fragments templated by products of the total strand-transfer reaction to the sizes of the sequenced standards showed that there was a narrow distribution of strand transfers ∼5–13 bp from the upstream end of the plasmid-borne LTR (Fig. 4E, lane 4). To further test the dependence of the strand-transfer reaction on the Ty3 IR, the target plasmid was modified in the Ty3 IR from TGTTGTAT to TCACGTAT to produce plasmid pXQ3673 (Fig. 4D). In contrast to PCR templated by the reaction using the wt IR target, PCR of the reaction containing the mutated IR failed to generate a product (Fig. 4D, lane 2). Control PCR reactions monitoring DNA recovery showed no difference in plasmid recovery between the two sets of samples (data not shown). Although it appears that in MgCl2, in the absence of a targeting factor, strand transfer does not occur or is extremely inefficient, this may be because the PCR assay is less sensitive to detection of highly distributed products. In the presence of MnCl2, strand transfer was independent of TFP and concentrated near Ty3 IR-like sequences. Thus, IN strand transfer activity per se does not depend upon the presence of a targeting transcription factor. U5 strand transfer was only observed upstream of the Ty3 IR. This is consistent with asymmetric targeting by the 8-bp sequence to regions which in a chromosomal context would lie outside of Ty3. The experiments in which the position of TFP was shifted by IN in the presence of Mg2+ but not in the presence of Mn2+, together with the redirection of strand transfer in the presence of MnCl2 suggested that IN interacts directly with IR-containing DNA in the presence of MnCl2. However, gel shift experiments similar to those which detected weak TFP-mediated IN association with TATA-containing target probe failed to identify detectable binding to IR-containing 50-mers (data not shown). The possibility that the presence of MnCl2 enhances weak sequence-specific interactions is intriguing. The crystal structure of the primate foamy virus intasome (39.Maertens G.N. Hare S. Cherepanov P. The mechanism of retroviral integration from X-ray structures of its key intermediates.Nature. 2010; 468: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) showed a dimer of dimers with the catalytic site at the dimer-dimer interface; residues interacting with the donor IR mapped to the catalytic core and C-terminal domains of the interface. If we assume a similar structure for Ty3 IN, outer subunits might be available to participate in targeting. We speculate that in the presence of MgCl2, they interact preferentially with the TFIIIB complex, whereas in the presence of MnCl2, this interaction is disfavored and IR-interacting residues mediate interactions (Fig. 4F). Although this activity is interesting in terms of intasome structure-function, it may have minimal in vivo significance. In vivo, integration into Pol III initiation sites clearly dominates (40.Qi X. Daily K. Nguyen K. Wang H. Mayhew D. Rigor P. Forouzan S. Johnston M. Mitra R.D. Baldi P. Sandmeyer S. Retrotransposon profiling of RNA polymerase III initiation sites.Genome Res. 2012; 22: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and the concentration of MnCl2 required for IR targeting was significantly greater than the reported physiologic concentration (41.Lange H.C. Heijnen J.J. Statistical reconciliation of the elemental and molecular biomass composition of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2001; 75: 334-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In summary, the involvement of multiple retroelement and host proteins and poorly-defined insertion preferences complicate elucidation of retroelement targeting. This study reconstitutes precise retroelement targeting in vitro for the first time and delimits the retroelement and host components responsible. Intriguingly, our studies showed that both protein-targeted and IR sequence-targeted modes of strand transfer can occur in vitro. We propose that outer intasome subunits not involved in strand transfer are available for target interaction. We thank B. Irwin for technical support and helpful discussions. We thank K.

https://openalex.org/W2083646126,"The nucleocapsid protein (N) and the phosphoprotein (P) of nonsegmented negative-strand (NNS) RNA viruses interact with each other to accomplish two crucial events necessary for the viral replication cycle. First, the P protein binds to the aggregation prone nascent N molecules maintaining them in a soluble monomeric (N(0)) form (N(0)-P complex). It is this form that is competent for specific encapsidation of the viral genome. Second, the P protein binds to oligomeric N in the nucleoprotein complex (N-RNA-P complex), and thereby facilitates the recruitment of the viral polymerase (L) onto its template. All previous attempts to study these complexes relied on co-expression of the two proteins in diverse systems. In this study, we have characterised these different modes of N-P interaction in detail and for the first time have been able to reconstitute these complexes individually in vitro in the chandipura virus (CHPV), a human pathogenic NNS RNA virus. Using a battery of truncated mutants of the N protein, we have been able to identify two mutually exclusive domains of N involved in differential interaction with the P protein. An unique N-terminal binding site, comprising of amino acids (aa) 1-180 form the N(0)-P interacting region, whereas, C-terminal residues spanning aa 320-390 is instrumental in N-RNA-P interactions. Significantly, the ex-vivo data also supports these observations. Based on these results, we suggest that the P protein acts as N-specific chaperone and thereby partially masking the N-N self-association region, which leads to the specific recognition of viral genome RNA by N(0)."
https://openalex.org/W2005898016,"Rubrerythrin (Rbr) is a non-heme iron protein composed of two distinctive domains and functions as a peroxidase in anaerobic organisms. A novel Rbr-like protein, ferriperoxin (Fpx), was identified in Hydrogenobacter thermophilus and was found not to possess the rubredoxin-like domain that is present in typical Rbrs. Although this protein is widely distributed among aerobic organisms, its function remains unknown. In this study, Fpx exhibited ferredoxin:NADPH oxidoreductase (FNR)-dependent peroxidase activity and reduced both hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and organic hydroperoxide in the presence of NADPH and FNR as electron donors. The calculated Km and Vmax values of Fpx for organic hydroperoxides were comparable to that for H2O2, demonstrating a multiple reactivity of Fpx towards hydroperoxides. An fpx gene disruptant was unable to grow under aerobic conditions, whereas its growth profiles were comparable to those of the wild-type strain under anaerobic and microaerobic conditions, clearly indicating the indispensability of Fpx as an antioxidant of H. thermophilus in aerobic environments. Structural analysis suggested that domain-swapping occurs in Fpx, and this domain-swapped structure is well conserved among thermophiles, implying the importance of structural stability of domain-swapped conformation for thermal environments. In addition, Fpx was located on a deep branch of the phylogenetic tree of Rbr and Rbr-like proteins. This finding, taken together with the wide distribution of Fpx among Bacteria and Archaea, suggests that Fpx is an ancestral type of Rbr homolog that functions as an essential antioxidant and may be part of an ancestral peroxide-detoxification system."

https://openalex.org/W2019756489,"Agonist-induced internalization of transmembrane receptors is a widespread biological phenomenon that also may serve as a mechanism for synaptic plasticity. Here we show that the agonist AMPA causes a depression of AMPA receptor (AMPAR) signaling at glutamate synapses in the CA1 region of the hippocampus in slices from developing, but not from mature, rats. This developmentally restricted agonist-induced synaptic depression is expressed as a total loss of AMPAR signaling, without affecting NMDA receptor (NMDAR) signaling, in a large proportion of the developing synapses, thus creating AMPAR silent synapses. The AMPA-induced AMPAR silencing is induced independently of activation of mGluRs and NMDARs, and it mimics and occludes stimulus-induced depression, suggesting that this latter form of synaptic plasticity is expressed as agonist-induced removal of AMPARs. Induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) rendered the developing synapses resistant to the AMPA-induced depression, indicating that LTP contributes to the maturation-related increased stability of these synapses. Our study shows that agonist binding to AMPARs is a sufficient triggering stimulus for the creation of AMPAR silent synapses at developing glutamate synapses."

In this report, we analyzed the cochlear hair cells of mice with specific deletion of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) in inner hair cells. MLCK-deficient mice showed impaired hearing, with a 5- to 14-dB rise in the auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds to clicks and tones of different frequencies and a significant decrease in the amplitude of the ABR waves. The mutant inner hair cells produced several ball-like structures around the hair bundles in vivo, indicating impaired membrane stability. Inner hair cells isolated from the knockout mice consistently displayed less resistance to hypoosmotic solution and less membrane F-actin. Myosin light-chain phosphorylation was also reduced in the mutated inner hair cells. Our results suggest that MLCK is necessary for maintaining the membrane stability of inner hair cells."
https://openalex.org/W2005087269,"For decades, research efforts have tried to uncover the underlying genetic basis of human susceptibility to a variety of diseases. Linkage studies have resulted in highly replicated findings and helped identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for many complex traits; however identification of specific alleles accounting for linkage remains elusive. The purpose of this study was to determine whether with a sufficient number of variants a linkage signal can be fully explained.We used comprehensive fine-mapping using a dense set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the entire quantitative trait locus (QTL) on human chromosome 7q36 linked to plasma triglyceride levels. Analyses included measured genotype and combined linkage association analyses.Screening this linkage region, we found an over representation of nominally significant associations in five genes (MLL3, DPP6, PAXIP1, HTR5A, INSIG1). However, no single genetic variant was sufficient to account for the linkage. On the other hand, multiple variants capturing the variation in these five genes did account for the linkage at this locus. Permutation analyses suggested that this reduction in LOD score was unlikely to have occurred by chance (p = 0.008).With recent findings, it has become clear that most complex traits are influenced by a large number of genetic variants each contributing only a small percentage to the overall phenotype. We found that with a sufficient number of variants, the linkage can be fully explained. The results from this analysis suggest that perhaps the failure to identify causal variants for linkage peaks may be due to multiple variants under the linkage peak with small individual effect, rather than a single variant of large effect."
