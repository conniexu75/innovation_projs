Dissolve 122.2 gm (1 mole) of Kromfax solvent in 978 gm of 36% hydrochloric acid in a 2-liter round-bottom flask and place under a reflux condenser. Heat this solution between 800 and 900 C for 1 hr. The liquid will become turbid, due to the separation of the mustard. Allow to cool and separate the lower layer by means of a separatory funnel. The mustard thus obtained may be freed from excess H0l by passing a stream of dry air through it. The weight of product should be about 149.5 gm, or 94% of theory, and the melting point about 130 C, which indicates a purity of 96%. Pure mustard has a melting point of 14.50 C. The crude material can be dried by heating under"

progress has been made in determining
the seismicity in a given area-the frequency
of occurrence, and distribution of earthquakes.
Earlier investigations were based almost completely
on field observations, but now extensive use
of instrumental records is possible. This assures much
more uniform results for the whole earth. The use of
seismograms in investigations of seismicity was made
possible by the development of methods which permit
a rapid calculation of a function of the earthquake
energy from instrumental observations."

The depository did not have that capability when Molecular Genetics Research and Development Limited Partnership filed its patent application for a genetically engineered corn plant, but it has the facilities now."
