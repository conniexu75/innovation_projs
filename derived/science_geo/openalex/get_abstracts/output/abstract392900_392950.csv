We demonstrated a conceptually different approach to enhancing solar absorption by introducing disorder in the surface layers of nanophase TiO(2) through hydrogenation. We showed that disorder-engineered TiO(2) nanocrystals exhibit substantial solar-driven photocatalytic activities, including the photo-oxidation of organic molecules in water and the production of hydrogen with the use of a sacrificial reagent."

https://openalex.org/W1996688443,"Background With the advent of second-generation sequencing, the expression of gene transcripts can be digitally measured with high accuracy. The purpose of this study was to systematically profile the expression of both mRNA and miRNA genes in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) using massively parallel sequencing technology. Methodology The expression of mRNAs and miRNAs were analyzed in tumor tissues and matched normal adjacent tissues obtained from 10 ccRCC patients without distant metastases. In a prevalence screen, some of the most interesting results were validated in a large cohort of ccRCC patients. Principal Findings A total of 404 miRNAs and 9,799 mRNAs were detected to be differentially expressed in the 10 ccRCC patients. We also identified 56 novel miRNA candidates in at least two samples. In addition to confirming that canonical cancer genes and miRNAs (including VEGFA, DUSP9 and ERBB4; miR-210, miR-184 and miR-206) play pivotal roles in ccRCC development, promising novel candidates (such as PNCK and miR-122) without previous annotation in ccRCC carcinogenesis were also discovered in this study. Pathways controlling cell fates (e.g., cell cycle and apoptosis pathways) and cell communication (e.g., focal adhesion and ECM-receptor interaction) were found to be significantly more likely to be disrupted in ccRCC. Additionally, the results of the prevalence screen revealed that the expression of a miRNA gene cluster located on Xq27.3 was consistently downregulated in at least 76.7% of ∼50 ccRCC patients. Conclusions Our study provided a two-dimensional map of the mRNA and miRNA expression profiles of ccRCC using deep sequencing technology. Our results indicate that the phenotypic status of ccRCC is characterized by a loss of normal renal function, downregulation of metabolic genes, and upregulation of many signal transduction genes in key pathways. Furthermore, it can be concluded that downregulation of miRNA genes clustered on Xq27.3 is associated with ccRCC."
https://openalex.org/W2159170056,"Resolving threats to widely distributed marine megafauna requires definition of the geographic distributions of both the threats as well as the population unit(s) of interest. In turn, because individual threats can operate on varying spatial scales, their impacts can affect different segments of a population of the same species. Therefore, integration of multiple tools and techniques--including site-based monitoring, genetic analyses, mark-recapture studies and telemetry--can facilitate robust definitions of population segments at multiple biological and spatial scales to address different management and research challenges.To address these issues for marine turtles, we collated all available studies on marine turtle biogeography, including nesting sites, population abundances and trends, population genetics, and satellite telemetry. We georeferenced this information to generate separate layers for nesting sites, genetic stocks, and core distributions of population segments of all marine turtle species. We then spatially integrated this information from fine- to coarse-spatial scales to develop nested envelope models, or Regional Management Units (RMUs), for marine turtles globally.The RMU framework is a solution to the challenge of how to organize marine turtles into units of protection above the level of nesting populations, but below the level of species, within regional entities that might be on independent evolutionary trajectories. Among many potential applications, RMUs provide a framework for identifying data gaps, assessing high diversity areas for multiple species and genetic stocks, and evaluating conservation status of marine turtles. Furthermore, RMUs allow for identification of geographic barriers to gene flow, and can provide valuable guidance to marine spatial planning initiatives that integrate spatial distributions of protected species and human activities. In addition, the RMU framework--including maps and supporting metadata--will be an iterative, user-driven tool made publicly available in an online application for comments, improvements, download and analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2142214637,"This paper investigates the dependence of synchronization transitions of bursting oscillations on the information transmission delay over scale-free neuronal networks with attractive and repulsive coupling. It is shown that for both types of coupling, the delay always plays a subtle role in either promoting or impairing synchronization. In particular, depending on the inherent oscillation period of individual neurons, regions of irregular and regular propagating excitatory fronts appear intermittently as the delay increases. These delay-induced synchronization transitions are manifested as well-expressed minima in the measure for spatiotemporal synchrony. For attractive coupling, the minima appear at every integer multiple of the average oscillation period, while for the repulsive coupling, they appear at every odd multiple of the half of the average oscillation period. The obtained results are robust to the variations of the dynamics of individual neurons, the system size, and the neuronal firing type. Hence, they can be used to characterize attractively or repulsively coupled scale-free neuronal networks with delays."

Another common feature of Parkinson disease (PD) is mitochondrial dysfunction. Here, we provide evidence that the overactivation of autophagy may be a link that connects the intracellular accumulation of α-synuclein with mitochondrial dysfunction. We found that the activation of macroautophagy in primary cortical neurons that overexpress mutant A53T α-synuclein leads to massive mitochondrial destruction and loss, which is associated with a bioenergetic deficit and neuronal degeneration. No mitochondrial removal or net loss was observed when we suppressed the targeting of mitochondria to autophagosomes by silencing Parkin, overexpressing wild-type Mitofusin 2 and dominant negative Dynamin-related protein 1 or blocking autophagy by silencing autophagy-related genes. The inhibition of targeting mitochondria to autophagosomes or autophagy was also partially protective against mutant A53T α-synuclein-induced neuronal cell death. These data suggest that overactivated mitochondrial removal could be one of the contributing factors that leads to the mitochondrial loss observed in PD models.

https://openalex.org/W2015239725,"Fasciola hepatica (liver fluke) is a physically and economically devastating parasitic trematode whose rise in recent years has been attributed to climate change. Climate has an impact on the free-living stages of the parasite and its intermediate host Lymnaea truncatula, with the interactions between rainfall and temperature having the greatest influence on transmission efficacy. There have been a number of short term climate driven forecasts developed to predict the following season's infection risk, with the Ollerenshaw index being the most widely used. Through the synthesis of a modified Ollerenshaw index with the UKCP09 fine scale climate projection data we have developed long term seasonal risk forecasts up to 2070 at a 25 km square resolution. Additionally UKCIP gridded datasets at 5 km square resolution from 1970-2006 were used to highlight the climate-driven increase to date. The maps show unprecedented levels of future fasciolosis risk in parts of the UK, with risk of serious epidemics in Wales by 2050. The seasonal risk maps demonstrate the possible change in the timing of disease outbreaks due to increased risk from overwintering larvae. Despite an overall long term increase in all regions of the UK, spatio-temporal variation in risk levels is expected. Infection risk will reduce in some areas and fluctuate greatly in others with a predicted decrease in summer infection for parts of the UK due to restricted water availability. This forecast is the first approximation of the potential impacts of climate change on fasciolosis risk in the UK. It can be used as a basis for indicating where active disease surveillance should be targeted and where the development of improved mitigation or adaptation measures is likely to bring the greatest benefits."

https://openalex.org/W2004006589,"Ralstonia solanacearum, which causes bacterial wilt of diverse plants, produces copious extracellular polysaccharide (EPS), a major virulence factor. The function of EPS in wilt disease is uncertain. Leading hypotheses are that EPS physically obstructs plant water transport, or that EPS cloaks the bacterium from host plant recognition and subsequent defense. Tomato plants infected with R. solanacearum race 3 biovar 2 strain UW551 and tropical strain GMI1000 upregulated genes in both the ethylene (ET) and salicylic acid (SA) defense signal transduction pathways. The horizontally wilt-resistant tomato line Hawaii7996 activated expression of these defense genes faster and to a greater degree in response to R. solanacearum infection than did susceptible cultivar Bonny Best. However, EPS played different roles in resistant and susceptible host responses to R. solanacearum. In susceptible plants the wild-type and eps− mutant strains induced generally similar defense responses. But in resistant Hawaii7996 tomato plants, the wild-type pathogens induced significantly greater defense responses than the eps− mutants, suggesting that the resistant host recognizes R. solanacearum EPS. Consistent with this idea, purified EPS triggered significant SA pathway defense gene expression in resistant, but not in susceptible, tomato plants. In addition, the eps− mutant triggered noticeably less production of defense-associated reactive oxygen species in resistant tomato stems and leaves, despite attaining similar cell densities in planta. Collectively, these data suggest that bacterial wilt-resistant plants can specifically recognize EPS from R. solanacearum."

This new find and several other examples of Darwinopterus demonstrate that males of this pterosaur had a relatively small pelvis and a large cranial crest, whereas females had a relatively large pelvis and no crest. The ratio of egg mass to adult mass is relatively low, as in extant reptiles, and is comparable to values for squamates. A parchment-like eggshell points to burial and significant uptake of water after oviposition. This evidence for low parental investment contradicts the widespread assumption that reproduction in pterosaurs was like that of birds and shows that it was essentially like that of reptiles."

https://openalex.org/W2068323301,"The bakers' yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae utilizes a high affinity Ca(2+) influx system (HACS) to survive assaults by mating pheromones, tunicamycin, and azole-class antifungal agents. HACS consists of two known subunits, Cch1 and Mid1, that are homologous and analogous to the catalytic α-subunits and regulatory α2δ-subunits of mammalian voltage-gated calcium channels, respectively. To search for additional subunits and regulators of HACS, a collection of gene knock-out mutants was screened for abnormal uptake of Ca(2+) after exposure to mating pheromone or to tunicamycin. The screen revealed that Ecm7 is required for HACS function in most conditions. Cycloheximide chase experiments showed that Ecm7 was stabilized by Mid1, and Mid1 was stabilized by Cch1 in non-signaling conditions, suggesting they all interact. Ecm7 is a member of the PMP-22/EMP/MP20/Claudin superfamily of transmembrane proteins that includes γ-subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels. Eleven additional members of this superfamily were identified in yeast, but none was required for HACS activity in response to the stimuli. Remarkably, many dozens of genes involved in vesicle-mediated trafficking and protein secretion were required to prevent spontaneous activation of HACS. Taken together, the findings suggest that HACS and calcineurin monitor performance of the membrane trafficking system in yeasts and coordinate compensatory processes. Conservation of this quality control system in Candida glabrata suggests that many pathogenic species of fungi may utilize HACS and calcineurin to resist azoles and other compounds that target membrane biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1987833161,"R-spondins (RSPOs) are a recently characterized family of secreted proteins that activate WNT/β-catenin signaling. In this study, we investigated the potential roles of the RSPO proteins during myogenic differentiation. Overexpression of the Rspo1 gene or administration of recombinant RSPO2 protein enhanced mRNA and protein expression of a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) class myogenic determination factor, MYF5, in both C2C12 myoblasts and primary satellite cells, whereas MYOD or PAX7 expression was not affected. RSPOs also promoted myogenic differentiation and induced hypertrophic myotube formation in C2C12 cells. In addition, Rspo2 and Rspo3 gene knockdown by RNA interference significantly compromised MYF5 expression, myogenic differentiation, and myotube formation. Furthermore, Myf5 expression was reduced in the developing limbs of mouse embryos lacking the Rspo2 gene. Finally, we demonstrated that blocking of WNT/β-catenin signaling by DKK1 or a dominant-negative form of TCF4 reversed MYF5 expression, myogenic differentiation, and hypertrophic myotube formation induced by RSPO2, indicating that RSPO2 exerts its activity through the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway. Our results provide strong evidence that RSPOs are key positive regulators of skeletal myogenesis acting through the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2000523303,"Discovery of proteins expressed in the central nervous system sharing the three-finger structure with snake α-neurotoxins provoked much interest to their role in brain functions. Prototoxin LYNX1, having homology both to Ly6 proteins and three-finger neurotoxins, is the first identified member of this family membrane-tethered by a GPI anchor, which considerably complicates in vitro studies. We report for the first time the NMR spatial structure for the water-soluble domain of human LYNX1 lacking a GPI anchor (ws-LYNX1) and its concentration-dependent activity on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). At 5-30 μM, ws-LYNX1 competed with (125)I-α-bungarotoxin for binding to the acetylcholine-binding proteins (AChBPs) and to Torpedo nAChR. Exposure of Xenopus oocytes expressing α7 nAChRs to 1 μM ws-LYNX1 enhanced the response to acetylcholine, but no effect was detected on α4β2 and α3β2 nAChRs. Increasing ws-LYNX1 concentration to 10 μM caused a modest inhibition of these three nAChR subtypes. A common feature for ws-LYNX1 and LYNX1 is a decrease of nAChR sensitivity to high concentrations of acetylcholine. NMR and functional analysis both demonstrate that ws-LYNX1 is an appropriate model to shed light on the mechanism of LYNX1 action. Computer modeling, based on ws-LYNX1 NMR structure and AChBP x-ray structure, revealed a possible mode of ws-LYNX1 binding."

These suggested a progressive switch to aerobic respiratory metabolism and a remodeling of the cell envelope as oxygen availability increased. The transcriptional responses were consistent with changes in the abundance of cytochrome bd and bo′ and the outer membrane protein OmpW.

https://openalex.org/W2109130681,"Background Diversity patterns of livestock species are informative to the history of agriculture and indicate uniqueness of breeds as relevant for conservation. So far, most studies on cattle have focused on mitochondrial and autosomal DNA variation. Previous studies of Y-chromosomal variation, with limited breed panels, identified two Bos taurus (taurine) haplogroups (Y1 and Y2; both composed of several haplotypes) and one Bos indicus (indicine/zebu) haplogroup (Y3), as well as a strong phylogeographic structuring of paternal lineages. Methodology and Principal Findings Haplogroup data were collected for 2087 animals from 138 breeds. For 111 breeds, these were resolved further by genotyping microsatellites INRA189 (10 alleles) and BM861 (2 alleles). European cattle carry exclusively taurine haplotypes, with the zebu Y-chromosomes having appreciable frequencies in Southwest Asian populations. Y1 is predominant in northern and north-western Europe, but is also observed in several Iberian breeds, as well as in Southwest Asia. A single Y1 haplotype is predominant in north-central Europe and a single Y2 haplotype in central Europe. In contrast, we found both Y1 and Y2 haplotypes in Britain, the Nordic region and Russia, with the highest Y-chromosomal diversity seen in the Iberian Peninsula. Conclusions We propose that the homogeneous Y1 and Y2 regions reflect founder effects associated with the development and expansion of two groups of dairy cattle, the pied or red breeds from the North Sea and Baltic coasts and the spotted, yellow or brown breeds from Switzerland, respectively. The present Y1-Y2 contrast in central Europe coincides with historic, linguistic, religious and cultural boundaries."
https://openalex.org/W2037357013,"Most plant glycoproteins contain substantial amounts of paucimannosidic N-glycans instead of their direct biosynthetic precursors, complex N-glycans with terminal N-acetylglucosamine residues. We now demonstrate that two β-N-acetylhexosaminidases (HEXO1 and HEXO3) residing in different subcellular compartments jointly account for the formation of paucimannosidic N-glycans in Arabidopsis thaliana. Total N-glycan analysis of hexo knock-out plants revealed that HEXO1 and HEXO3 contribute equally to the production of paucimannosidic N-glycans in roots, whereas N-glycan processing in leaves depends more heavily on HEXO3 than on HEXO1. Because hexo1 hexo3 double mutants do not display any obvious phenotype even upon exposure to different forms of abiotic or biotic stress, it should be feasible to improve the quality of glycoprotein therapeutics produced in plants by down-regulation of endogenous β-N-acetylhexosaminidase activities."

Although recent studies have shown its association with a variety of neurodegenerative disorders, the function of TDP-43 remains poorly understood. Here we address TDP-43 function using spermatogenesis as a model system. We previously showed that TDP-43 binds to the testis-specific mouse acrv1 gene promoter in vitro via two GTGTGT-motifs and that mutation of these motifs led to premature transcription in spermatocytes of an otherwise round spermatid-specific promoter. The present study tested the hypothesis that TDP-43 represses acrv1 gene transcription in spermatocytes. Plasmid chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that TDP-43 binds to the acrv1 promoter through GTGTGT motifs in vivo. Reporter gene assays showed that TDP-43 represses acrv1 core promoter-driven transcription via the N-terminal RRM1 domain in a histone deacetylase-independent manner. Consistent with repressor role, ChIP on physiologically isolated germ cells confirmed that TDP-43 occupies the endogenous acrv1 promoter in spermatocytes. Surprisingly, however, TDP-43 remains at the promoter in round spermatids, which express acrv1 mRNA. We show that RNA binding-defective TDP-43, but not splice variant isoforms, relieve repressor function. Transitioning from repressive to active histone marks has little effect on TDP-43 occupancy. Finally, we found that RNA polymerase II is recruited but paused at the acrv1 promoter in spermatocytes. Because mutation of TDP-43 sites caused premature transcription in spermatocytes in vivo, TDP-43 may be involved in pausing RNAPII at the acrv1 promoter in spermatocytes.

Virol. 1995; 69: 3584-3596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro transcription as well as transient transfection assays showed that TDP-43 repressed HIV transactivation response mediated transcription (1Ou S.H. Wu F. Harrich D. García-Martínez L.F.

Interest in TDP-43, however, increased exponentially after the discovery in 2006 that aberrantly truncated, phosphorylated, and mislocalized TDP-43 was present in the intracellular ubiquitinated inclusions in the brains of patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer disease (3Neumann M.

Although a large number of reports have since confirmed the link between TDP-43 and human neurodegenerative disorders, it is not yet clear how TDP-43 contributes to disease.

The acrv1 promoter contains two GTGTGT motifs, canonical TDP-43 binding sites, at −172 and −160 positions on the antisense strand. EMSAs showed that recombinant TDP-43 binds to this region in a GTGTGT-dependent manner. Furthermore, our previous work using transgenic mice as a reporter system showed that mutation of the GTGTGT motifs in the −186/+28 acrv1 promoter leads to premature expression of a reporter gene in the meiotic spermatocytes, whereas the wild-type −186/+28 acrv1 promoter delivers correct post meiotic round spermatid-specific reporter gene expression (10Acharya K.K. Govind C.K. Shore A.N. Stoler M.H. Reddi P.P. Dev. Biol. 2006; 295: 781-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). TDP-43 is expressed in spermatocytes as well as round spermatids. Based on the above data we hypothesized that TDP-43 represses the acrv1 gene transcription in spermatocytes. The present work addressed the following questions. 1) Does TDP-43 function as a transcriptional repressor, and if so, what are the domains necessary for repression? 2) Does TDP-43 bind to its putative target gene (acrv1) promoter in vivo in a physiological context? 3) How might TDP-43 transcriptional function be modulated? 4) What is the status of histone marks and RNAPII associated with TDP-43 promoter occupancy in vivo? Results presented in this study establish that TDP-43 is a transcriptional repressor and that the mouse acrv1 gene is a bona fide target gene for TDP-43 mediated repression in vivo. Mouse GC-2 spermatogenic cells (ATCC catalogue number CRL-2196) and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% l-glutamate, and 1% nonessential amino acids. COS-7 cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum.

Pure populations (> 95% purity) of spermatocytes and round spermatids were isolated by Sta-Put gradient as described (10Acharya K.K. Govind C.K. Shore A.N. Stoler M.H. Reddi P.P. Dev. Biol. 2006; 295: 781-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 11Abhyankar M.M. Urekar C. Reddi P.P. J. Biol.

The outer membrane of each testis was decapsulated using forceps, and the seminiferous epithelia (tubules) were collected in a 10-cm dish and washed in 10 ml of DMEM. Tubules were dissociated in 10 mg of collagenase and 20 μg of DNase in 8.5 ml of DMEM for 10 min in a 37 °C incubator with gentle disruption. Tubules were washed twice with cold DMEM. The germ cells were released by enzymatic treatment with 7 mg of collagenase, 15 mg of hyaluronidase, 10 mg of trypsin, and 20 μg of DNase in 8.5 mg of DMEM for 10 min in the 37 °C incubator as before. Tubules were cut to 5-mm lengths with scissors to further enhance the digestion during enzymatic treatment. The entire volume was transferred to a 50-ml conical tube, reconstituted in 45 ml of DMEM, and allowed to sediment for 10 min on ice to separate the heavier tubule pieces away from the germ cells. The supernatants containing the germ cells were transferred to a fresh conical tube and centrifuged at 900 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cells were washed twice with PBS and loaded onto a 2–4% BSA Sta-Put gradient to separate the larger spermatocytes and smaller spermatids by gravity sedimentation for 3 h at 4 °C. Fractions (300 drops per fraction) of the heavier spermatocytes first followed by lighter round spermatids were collected over a 1-h period. Every fifth fraction of an average total of 70 fractions was observed under a light microscope to identify spermatocyte and round-spermatid fractions based on their morphology. Fractions of spermatocytes and round spermatids were centrifuged at 900 x g for 20 min at 4 °C and pooled separately. On average, the testes of 11 Swiss Webster mice (10–12 weeks old) yielded 22 × 106 spermatocytes and 104 × 106 round spermatids. The spermatocytes and round spermatids obtained were fixed in 1% formaldehyde and divided into 10 × 106 spermatocytes and 40 × 106 round spermatid aliquots for chromatin immunoprecipitations (ChIPs). Spermatocytes and spermatids were separated by Sta Put method and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. 3 × 106 cells of each cell type were used to isolate RNA using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen; 74104) adding the optional DNase step (Qiagen; 79254). Cells were disrupted using a homogenizer. cDNA was generated with 2 μg of RNA using the AffinityScript Multi Temperature cDNA Synthesis kit (Stratagene; 200436) at a temperature of 55 °C, with the TDP specific primer, TDP nested Rev1, CAGGTGATGAATCCATTTGACTTGA. This primer sits at bp 3138 of NM_145556. For cloning out potential splice variants, we used the information available on GenBankTM for currently identified splice variants. The splice variants currently in the data base are of three different groups; that is, the annotated full-length protein and some C-terminal deletion (encompassing the Gly domain) variants that end with one of two different novel exons. Using a primer set that starts at the common ATG and ends at the most 3′ exon (the second novel terminal exon) will yield all splice variants currently in the data base (supplemental Fig. S3A). These primers were: TDP-43 forward (ATGTCTGAATATATTCGG) and TDP-43 reverse (v2, TCAAAGACGCAGCCTGT). The latter primer sits at bp 2268 of NM_145556. The products of the above PCR were cloned using the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen; K461020). The products that deviated in size from the full-length protein were sequenced. Two major species were identified. One was spermatocyte-specific, and the other was spermatid-specific. These two splice variants differed by only 9 base pairs. There were several additional products that contained TDP sequence; however, these either did not code for a protein or had retained introns. Western blotting analysis of specific histone marks was carried out after histone extraction as described by Abcam. In brief, 107 GC-2 cells were harvested and washed in ice-cold PBS supplemented with 5 mm sodium butyrate. Cells were resuspended in Triton extraction buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 0.02% NaN3 in PBS) for 10 min at 4 °C with gentle end-to-end shaking. Nuclei were pelleted at 6500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Nuclei were recovered, washed in Triton extraction buffer, and pelleted again. Acid extraction of histones were carried out in 0.2 n HCl overnight at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged as before, and supernatants containing histone proteins were recovered. GC-2 cells (0.2 × 106/well) were grown on glass coverslips in 6-well chambers. Cells were transfected with Gal4-TDP-43 (wild-type) and all of the Gal4-TDP43 mutant constructs used in this study (1 μg/well) using Mirus TransIT®-LT1 to determine subcellular localization of the fusion proteins. Transfection of Gal4 DBD alone served as a control. All cells were fixed 48 h post-transfection in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde (Alfa Aaser; 43368) in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were permeabilized and blocked in 0.2% Triton X-100 and 10% normal goat serum in PBS for 10 min. Primary antibody incubations were carried out with either anti-GAL4 DBD (1:200) or anti-TDP-43 (in-house; 1:400) antibodies at room temperature for 35 min in 10% normal goat serum in PBS-Tween. Secondary antibody incubations were carried out at room temperature for 20 min. Anti-mouse (1:200) CY3-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted in 10% normal goat serum in PBS-Tween was used for visualization of anti-Gal4 DBD. Nuclei were stained with DAPI. Cells were visualized using an Olympus BX50 microscope. Nuclear localization was observed for all of the Gal4 TDP-43 fusion constructs used in this study (supplemental Figs. S1, A and B, and S4). Full-length mouse TDP-43 (mTDP-43; amino acids 1–414) was cloned in pFLAG-CMV and pFA-CMV vectors (Stratagene). The pFA-CMV clone was used as a template to generate two N-terminal truncation constructs (104–414, 191–414), two C-terminal truncations (1–200, 1–262), and 4 domain constructs as follows: RNA recognition motif 1 (RRM1) (104–200), RRM2 (191–262), RRM1 + 2 (104–262), Gly (274–414). Human TDP-43 (hTDP-43), ΔRRM1 (hTDP-43 ΔRRM1), and amino acid 147/149 mutant (hTDP-43 F147L/F149L) in pFLAG-CMV-2 vectors were kind gifts from Dr. Emanuele Buratti (13Ayala Y.M. Zago P. D'Ambrogio A.

DBD-p53 activation domain was a kind gift from Dr. Rong Li (UT Health Science Center, Dept. of Molecular Medicine, San Antonio, TX). The −91/+28 ACRV1 reporter containing 5 Gal binding sites has been previously described (11Abhyankar M.M. Urekar C. Reddi P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 36143-36154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5X Gal element was PCR-amplified from the pFR-Luc plasmid (Stratagene) and ligated into the BGIII site of pGL3 −91/+28 Luc. The c-fos reporter containing four Gal binding sites was a kind gift from Dr. Rong Li and has been described elsewhere (14Miyake T. Hu Y.F. Yu D.S. Li R. J. Biol.

Transient transfections were performed in GC-2 and HeLa cells and COS-7 cells using Mirus TransIT®-LT1 (Mirus Corp.). 2 × 105 cells were plated overnight in 6-well tissue culture plates (BD Biosciences; 353046). Cells were 40–50% confluent at the time of transfections. 0.5 μg of reporter and 1 μg of effector (DBD-TDP-43 or empty vector DBD alone) were transfected per well GC-2 cell transfections. 0.2 μg of reporter was used per well of HeLa cell transfections. Renilla Luciferase was co-transfected at a 1:10 ratio. Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection. Luciferase activities were measured by the Dual Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the instructions provided with the kit. For experiments using HDAC inhibitors, cells were treated 24 h post-transfection, and drug treatments lasted 24 h. The reporter luciferase values were first divided by the Renilla luciferase values to normalize for transfection efficiency. These ratios were then expressed as a -fold change of control DBD vector-alone set as 1. Therefore, transcriptional repression with DBD-TDP-43 was defined as a value significantly lower than 1 as determined by one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-hoc test. To verify whether the DBD fusion proteins were expressed correctly, the insoluble cellular material from the reporter assay experiments treated with the passive lysis buffer supplied with the Dual Luciferase assays system (Promega) was used. These samples were solubilized in 1× Laemmli buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and blotted with anti-DBD antibody. Western blots indicated that all of the DBD-TDP-43 constructs used in reporter assays in this study expressed fusion proteins of the expected molecular weight (supplemental Figs. S1B and S3C and Fig. 5C). ChIPs were performed as described (16Lalmansingh A.S. Uht R.M. Endocrinology. 2008; 149: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature, and cross-linking was stopped by adding 0.125 m glycine (Fisher; G45–212) for 5 min. Cells were pelleted at 170 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and resuspended in 1 ml sonication buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) with protease inhibitors (2 μg of leupeptin (Sigma; L2884), 2 μg of aprotinin (Fisher; BP250310), 0.2 mm PMSF (Sigma; P7626)). Chromatin was sheared using a Sonicator W375 (Heat Systems-Ultrasonics, Inc., Farmingdale, NY). Sheared chromatin was precleared with 60 μl of protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz; sc-2003) and 2 μg of herring sperm DNA (Sigma; D3159) for 1 h at 4 °C. 200 μg of soluble chromatin was used for immunoprecipitation with control IgG antibody or specific target protein antibody (described above). 20 μg of chromatin was used to generate Input DNA for real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis, used as a reference for quantifying target DNA within immunoprecipitated samples. Chromatin was incubated with antibody overnight at 4 °C with rotation, after which 50 μl of protein A/G beads and 2 μg of herring sperm DNA was added for 2 h. The beads were washed sequentially with 1 ml each of sonication buffer containing high salt (500 mm NaCl), LiCl wash buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.01 m Tris, pH 8.1, 1 mm EDTA), and TE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA). Chromatin was eluted twice with 250 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3, 0.01 mg/ml herring sperm DNA). Input and immunoprecipitated samples were then heated to 65 °C in a water bath for 4 h to reverse the formaldehyde cross-links. DNA fragments were ethanol-precipitated overnight at −20 °C and centrifuged at 16, 060 x g for 20 min at 4 °C to pellet the DNA. Pelleted DNA was washed with 70% ethanol, air-dried for 10 min, resuspended in 100 μl of TE buffer with 11 μl of proteinase K buffer (0.1 m Tris pH 7.5, 0.05 m EDTA, 5% SDS) and 1 μg of proteinase K (Bioline; BIO-37037), and heated to 55 °C in a water bath for 1 h. Samples were then diluted 4 times with TE buffer, extracted once with 500 μl phenol chloroform isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), and ethanol-precipitated overnight at −20 °C. Precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 16,060 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, washed with 70% ethanol, air-dried for 10 min, and finally resuspended in 100 μl of TE buffer for qPCR. 3-μl aliquots of each sample was used in triplicate for qPCR analysis of the acrv1 promoter (−267 to +27) or a far downstream region (+5652 to +5930). Thermal cycling was performed using an iCycler (Bio-Rad). SYBR Green I dye (Molecular Probes) was added at a 1:75,000 dilution in each 25-μl PCR reaction. qPCR was performed in triplicate so that an average correlation time (Tc) was determined for each Input sample, each control immunoprecipitation sample, and each antibody immunoprecipitation sample. Enrichments relative to Input DNA were calculated by using the 2ΔTc formula where ΔTc represents the cycle difference between each IP sample and input. Finally, all relative enrichments of DNA in antibody immunoprecipitation samples were expressed as -fold of control IgG samples set as 1. Factor binding to the acrv1 gene was determined to be significantly enriched using one-way ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni post-hoc test to determine difference from IgG background. Amplification of a downstream region of the acrv1 promoter at +5652 bp was used to indicate specificity of factor binding to the proximal acrv1 promoter. For plasmid-based ChIPs, transfections were performed in COS-7 cells. 1.5 × 106 cells were plated overnight in 100-mm tissue culture dishes (Corning Inc.; #430167). 3 μg of plasmid (bearing either wild-type or GTGTGT-mutant −186 + 28 acrv1 promoter) and 3 μg of FLAG TDP-43 were transfected as described above. ChIPs were performed as described above. 500 μg of soluble chromatin was immunoprecipitated with control IgG or anti-FLAG antibody. 3-μl aliquots of each sample was used in triplicate for qPCR analysis using plasmid-specific PCR primers (−186 to +27). Factor binding to the acrv1 plasmid promoter was determined to be significantly enriched using one-way ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni post-hoc test to determine difference from IgG background. Primers were: −267 acrv1 forward (GACCCTCTGCAAAGAAGTGC), −186 acrv1 forward (AGGATCCGAAGCTACCCCTA), +27 acrv1 reverse (GGCACACTCAAGAGCTGAGA); +5652 acrv1 forward (GAACAAAGTGAATGTTGTGCACAATC), and +5930 acrv1 reverse (TCAGTCATTCCAGGAGCTGG). All data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis consisted of one-way ANOVAs followed by Bonferroni post tests to determine which means differ (p < 0.05). All data analyses were performed using the Number Cruncher Statistical System program (NCSS, Kaysville, UT). Here we directly tested the potential of TDP-43 to repress the acrv1 gene promoter using mouse spermatocyte cell line GC-2 and Gal 4 recruitment strategy. A luciferase reporter plasmid bearing five tandem Gal 4 binding sites upstream of the acrv1 core promoter (−91/+28) was constructed as a reporter (Fig. 1A). Full-length mouse TDP-43 was expressed as a fusion protein with the Gal4 DBD. Gal4DBD or Gal4DBD-TDP-43 plasmids were co-transfected with the above reporter plasmid into mouse GC-2 cells. The cells were harvested 48 h later, and luciferase activities were measured and normalized for transfection efficiencies. Transcriptional output from the vector expressing Gal4 DBD alone was used as the base line. The Gal4DBD-TDP-43 fusion protein repressed transcription of the reporter gene in a statistically significant manner, whereas the untargeted TDP-43 (FLAG-TDP-43) had no effect (Fig. 1B), indicating that the repressor effect of DBD-TDP-43 is a direct effect on the reporter gene. The positive control DBD-p53AD (activation domain of p53; a bona fide transcriptional activator) showed elevated reporter gene activity as expected. The DBD part contains a canonical nuclear localization signal that directs the location of the fusion proteins. Nuclear localization (supplemental Fig. S1A) as well as migration at the expected molecular size was verified (supplemental Fig. S1B) for all of the DBD-TDP43 fusion proteins used in reporter assays. The above results showed that TDP-43 represses transcription in the context of the acrv1 core promoter in a cell line (GC-2) of the spermatogenic lineage. Because TDP-43 is a ubiquitously expressed protein, we have also tested its function in the context of the generic c-fos minimal promoter in HeLa cells and found that TDP-43 acts as a repressor in that system as well (supplemental Fig. S2). These data suggest that the ubiquitously expressed TDP-43 protein likely functions as a repressor of transcription in multiple tissues. TDP-43 contains two RNA recognition motifs (RRM) in the N-terminal and a glycine-rich domain in the C-terminal halves (schematic in Fig. 1B). To identify which part of TDP-43 is responsible for transcriptional repression, we generated N- and C-terminal truncations of TDP-43 and expressed them as DBD fusion proteins. The DBD-TDP-43 fusion protein expression plasmids were cotransfected with 5XGal4 luciferase reporter as before. Deletion of the C-terminal portion did not alter the repressor function of TDP-43, as the 1–200 and 1–262 regions repressed transcription in a statistically significant manner (Fig. 1C). In contrast, removal of the N-terminal 191 amino acids completely abolished transcriptional repression, whereas deletion of only the first 104 amino acids maintained repression (Fig. 1C). These data showed that the 104–191 region corresponding to RRM1 is critical for the repressor function of TDP-43. To test whether RRM1 alone is sufficient for transcriptional repression, we made DBD-RRM1, DBD-RRM2, DBD-RRM1 + 2, and DBD-GLY domain fusion proteins and performed functional assays as above. The RRM1 domain alone or in combination with RRM2 caused statistically significant repression of transcription, whereas the RRM2 domain alone did not (Fig. 1D). The context of amino acids 1–104 also augmented the repressor function of RRM1 (Fig. 1C, DBD 1–200). An earlier study showed that TDP-43 1–95 region by itself does not repress transcription (1Ou S.H. Wu F. Harrich D. García-Martínez L.F. Gaynor R.B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3584-3596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the repressor activity of DBD 1–200 is contributed by the RRM1 region. On the other hand, the C-terminal 274–414 region containing the glycine-rich domain up-regulated reporter a"
https://openalex.org/W2087271040,"MicroRNAs are small, non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level and play an important role in the control of developmental and physiological processes. In particular, the developing brain contains an impressive diversity of microRNAs. Most microRNA expression profiling studies have been performed in human or rodents and relatively limited knowledge exists in other mammalian species. The domestic pig is considered to be an excellent, alternate, large mammal model for human-related neurological studies, due to its similarity in both brain development and the growth curve when compared to humans. Considering these similarities, studies examining microRNA expression during porcine brain development could potentially be used to predict the expression profile and role of microRNAs in the human brain.MicroRNA expression profiling by use of microRNA microarrays and qPCR was performed on the porcine developing brain. Our results show that microRNA expression is regulated in a developmentally stage-specific, as well as a tissue-specific manner. Numerous developmental stage or tissue-specific microRNAs including, miR-17, miR-18a, miR-29c, miR-106a, miR-135a and b, miR-221 and miR-222 were found by microarray analysis. Expression profiles of selected candidates were confirmed by qPCR.The differential expression of specific microRNAs in fetal versus postnatal samples suggests that they likely play an important role in the regulation of developmental and physiological processes during brain development. The data presented here supports the notion that microRNAs act as post-transcriptional switches which may regulate gene expression when required."
https://openalex.org/W2038631870,"Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4), an abundant selenoenzyme, is ubiquitously expressed in a tissue-, cell- and differentiation-dependent manner, and it is localized in cytoplasmic, mitochondrial, and nuclear cellular compartments. Here, we report cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of GPx4 in Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells. Enterocytic differentiation of Caco-2 cells triggers an increase in GPx4 mRNA and protein levels, mediated by enhanced promoter activity. We identified a combined cAMP response element (CREB) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) site as critical for the differentiation-triggered GPx4 promoter activity. Induction of GPx4 correlated with C/EBPα transcript levels during differentiation, suggesting a role of C/EBPα as regulator of enterocytic GPx4 expression. Consistent with the in vitro results, GPx4 protein was detected in cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments of enterocytes in human intestinal epithelia. GPx4 is uniformly expressed in colonic crypts and is differentially expressed along the crypt-to-villus axis in the small intestine with a more pronounced expression of GPx4 in the upper villi, which contain fully differentiated enterocytes. These data suggest that intestinal GPx4 expression is modulated by the enterocytic differentiation program, and the results support a direct role of nuclear GPx4 in the (selenium-dependent) prevention of oxidative damage in the gastrointestinal tract."
https://openalex.org/W2053676985,"Activated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) continues to signal in the early endosome, but how this signaling process is regulated is less well understood. Here we describe a protein complex consisting of TIP30, endophilin B1, and acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member 4 (ACSL4) that interacts with Rab5a and regulates EGFR endocytosis and signaling. These proteins are required for the proper endocytic trafficking of EGF-EGFR. Knockdown of TIP30, ACSL4, endophilin B1, or Rab5a in human liver cancer cells or genetic knock-out of Tip30 in mouse primary hepatocytes results in the trapping of EGF-EGFR complexes in early endosomes, leading to delayed EGFR degradation and prolonged EGFR signaling. Furthermore, we show that Rab5a colocalizes with vacuolar (H+)-ATPases (V-ATPases) on transport vesicles. The TIP30 complex facilitates trafficking of Rab5a and V-ATPases to EEA1-positve endosomes in response to EGF. Together, these results suggest that this TIP30 complex regulates EGFR endocytosis by facilitating the transport of V-ATPases from trans-Golgi network to early endosomes.

Therefore, the proper endosomal targeting and activity of V-ATPases contribute to the tight regulation of both endocytic trafficking and receptor endosomal signaling. Acidic luminal pH in early endosomes is the driving force for receptors to release their ligands, such as insulin and low density lipoprotein (LDL) (1Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

On the basis of individually tracking EGF and EGFR, it has long been considered that EGFR travels together with EGF until they reach lysosomes (11Carpenter G. Cohen S. Annu. Rev.

However, it is unclear whether they remain bound to each other on the way to lysosomes. Recent studies have suggested that EGFR is inactivated before being degraded and that EGF dissociates from EGFR prior to lysosomal transfer (6Murphy J.E. Padilla B.E. Hasdemir B. Cottrell G.S.

Here we report that a newly identified protein complex containing TIP30, ACSL4, and Endo B1 drives EGF-EGFR complex endocytic trafficking by facilitating the localization of Rab5a and V-ATPases to early endosomes. Rab5a and V-ATPase reside in vesicles devoid of the early endosomal marker EEA1 and the recycling endosomal marker transferrin receptor (TfR), suggesting that these vesicles are post-trans-Golgi network vesicles responsible for the transport of integral membrane protein V-ATPases. Our data suggest a mechanism by which Rab5a in cooperation with other proteins in the TIP30 complex transports V-ATPases to early endosomes and induces the dissociation of EGF from EGFR and the termination of EGFR endosomal signaling.

Nature. 1990; 345: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were homogenized by 20 strokes in two packed cell pellet volumes of buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, protease inhibitor mixture) using a Kontes homogenizer (B pestle). Another 20 strokes were applied after adding 1.5 cell pellet volumes of buffer B (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.6 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm DTT, 1.26 m NaCl, 75% glycerol) followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was dialyzed against BC300 (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.3 m KCl) (33Chiang C.M. Roeder R.G. Science. 1995; 267: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 20 min followed by rotating with anti-HA agarose beads (Roche Diagnostics) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were centrifuged and extensively washed using BC300 buffer. Immunoprecipitates were eluted with HA peptides (Roche Diagnostics), denatured, resolved on SDS-PAGE, and subjected to silver stain, immunoblot, or LC-MS/MS spectral analyses (The MSU Proteomics Facility, Michigan State University). Primary hepatocytes were isolated from 8-week-old wild type and Tip30−/− mice as described (34Seglen P.O. Exp. Cell Res. 1972; 74: 450-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, the inferior vena cava was cannulated, and the liver was first perfused in situ with an oxygenated Krebs-Ringer buffer (115 mm NaCl, 5.9 mm KCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm glucose, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) with 0.1 mm EGTA at 37 °C followed by perfusion with oxygenated Krebs-Ringer buffer containing 0.25 mm CaCl2 and 20 μg/ml Liberase Blendzyme 3 (Roche Applied Science). Liver was removed and then gently minced in ice-cold Krebs-Ringer buffer. Liver cell suspension was then filtered with Falcon cell strainers (BD Biosciences) and washed three times by centrifugation at 50 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. Cells were cultured in DMEM (with 10% FBS and 1× penicillin/streptomycin) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. To identify cytosolic proteins that interact with TIP30, we stably expressed TIP30 protein with an HA tag fused to its C-terminal end (TIP30-HA) in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (PLC/PRF/5). Co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed using whole cell extracts generated from cells expressing TIP30-HA or control vector. Mass spectrometric analysis identified Rab5a, ACSL4, and EndoB1 (also known as Bif-1) in the immunoprecipitates. Association of these proteins with TIP30-HA was confirmed by immunoblot analysis using specific antibodies (Fig. 1A). The interactions were further confirmed by reciprocal immunoprecipitation. When Rab5a, Endo B1, or ACSL4 were HA-tagged, each could be specifically co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous TIP30 and the other three endogenous proteins (Fig. 1B). Although Endo B1 failed to be immunoprecipitated with ACSL4-HA, possibly due to the interference of HA at its C terminus, endogenous ACSL4 was detected in Endo B1-HA immunoprecipitates. Notably, Rab5a was co-immunoprecipitated with these proteins in the presence of 0.2 mm EDTA, implying that the interaction is independent of its nucleotide binding status. We next used bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis (31Hu C.D. Grinberg A.V. Kerppola T.K. Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Somerset, NJ2005: 19.10.1-19.10.2Google Scholar) to visualize the association of TIP30 with these proteins in living cells. We observed that co-expression of TIP30-VC155 with VN173-Rab5a, ACSL4-VN173, or Endo B1-VN173 in cells reconstituted fluorescence, whereas co-expression of TIP30-VC155 and control VN173 did not (Fig. 1C), indicating that TIP30 directly or indirectly interacts with these proteins in living cells. To determine whether endogenous TIP30 associates with endogenous ACSL4 and EndoB1, we did glycerol gradient sedimentation and observed that these proteins co-sedimented at a position between the 150- and 443-kDa marker proteins in a 15–35% glycerol gradient (Fig. 2A). The majority of TIP30 and part of Endo B1 appeared in fractions containing proteins smaller than 66 kDa, suggesting that these two proteins may exist mainly as a heterodimer or as separated homodimers. An in vitro binding assay showed that bacterially expressed recombinant ACSL4 and Endo B1 were able to directly bind purified baculovirus-expressed recombinant TIP30 (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that TIP30, ACSL4, and Endo B1 may form a protein complex to interact with Rab5a. Rab5a colocalizes with EGFR in endosomes in response to EGF (35Lakadamyali M. Rust M.J. Zhuang X. Cell. 2006; 124: 997-1009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 36Leonard D. Hayakawa A. Lawe D. Lambright D. Bellve K.D. Standley C. Lifshitz L.M. Fogarty K.E. Corvera S. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 3445-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To test whether TIP30 is also targeted to endosomes, we co-expressed TIP30-CFP and EGFR-DsRed fusion proteins and examined their localization in HepG2 cells lacking detectable endogenous TIP30 and EGFR. Confocal microscopy analysis showed that TIP30-CFP partially colocalized with EGF and EGFR-DsRed in endosomes 10 min after cells were treated with Alexa-647-conjugated EGF (Alexa647-EGF; Fig. 2C), suggesting that TIP30 was also targeted to endosomes. Consistently, immunostaining of endogenous TIP30 and EGFR revealed that TIP30 was partially localized to EGF-EGFR-positive endosomes (Fig. 2D). Taken together, our protein-protein interaction and colocalization studies suggest that TIP30, ACSL4, and Endo B1 form a protein complex and may function together with Rab5a on the endocytic pathway. Knockdown of Rab5a expression in HeLa cells retards EGFR transport from early endosomes to late endosomes and delays the degradation of EGFR (19Chen P.I. Kong C. Su X. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 30328-30338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The interaction of TIP30, ACSL4, and Endo B1 with Rab5a raises the possibility that these proteins may also function in endocytic pathways. We performed EGFR internalization analysis to investigate whether the inhibition of TIP30, ACSL4, or Endo B1 affects the endocytic down-regulation of EGFR. Instead of continuous incubation with EGF, serum-starved cells were first incubated with EGF on ice to allow for binding of ligand to receptors, and then they were washed to remove unbound EGF before being moved to 37 °C for internalization. Nascent protein synthesis was blocked by cycloheximide in the culture medium. This approach eliminates the interference from continuous ligand entrance and new receptor synthesis, thus enabling us to monitor both the traffic and the fate of EGF-EGFR complexes. We found that knockdown of TIP30, Rab5a, ACSL4, or Endo B1 in PLC/PRF/5 cells (Fig. 3, A–D) resulted in a slower reduction of total EGFR protein levels (Fig. 4, A–F). To corroborate these findings, we further examined whether phosphorylation of EGFR at Tyr-845 (EGFR-pY845) and phosphorylation of AKT at Ser-473 (AKT-pS473), a downstream target of EGFR signaling, were affected. Remarkably, the levels of EGFR-pY845 and AKT-pS473 were sustained much longer in TIP30, ACSL4, Endo B1, or Rab5a knockdown cells than in control cells (Fig. 4, A–F). Of note, Akt phosphorylation was rapidly increased followed by a decline and then increased again after a 3-h internalization (Fig. 4, A–D). Although the exact mechanism to explain this phenomenon remains to be tested, one can envisage that it may reflect the autonomic balance of kinase and phosphatase activities for Akt in cells. To assess the effect of TIP30 deletion on EGFR endocytic down-regulation in normal cells and to exclude off-target effects of shRNAs, we performed EGFR internalization analysis using primary hepatocytes isolated from wild type and Tip30 knock-out mouse littermates. Deletion of Tip30 in primary hepatocytes delayed EGF-induced EGFR degradation (Fig. 4, G and H), and the phosphorylation of EGFR at Tyr-845 and Akt at Ser-473 was higher and sustained longer in Tip30−/− hepatocytes than in wild type hepatocytes. Together, these data provide strong evidence that TIP30, ACSL4, Endo B1, and Rab5a not only physically associate but also function together in promoting the endocytic down-regulation of EGFR protein level and signaling. An early study showed that EGF dissociates from EGFR at later stages of endocytosis (37Carter R.E. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35000-35007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been suggested that EGFR is inactivated before being transferred to lysosomes and degraded (6Murphy J.E. Padilla B.E. Hasdemir B. Cottrell G.S. Bunnett N.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 17615-17622Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 13Authier F. Chauvet G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 14Burke P. Schooler K.

Cell. 2008; 19: 3454-3462Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To test whether depletion of TIP30, ACSL4, Endo B1, or Rab5a affects EGF dissociation from EGFR, we simultaneously tracked Alexa488-EGF and EGFR at different time points after internalization using confocal microscopy. We found that fluorescent EGF partially colocalizes with EGFR and Rab5a in control cells after 15 and 30 min of internalization (supplemental Fig. S1A). Interestingly, Alexa488-EGF exited in membrane-bound vesicles from EGFR-positive endosomes in control cells after 60 min of internalization (Fig. 5A). In contrast, the majority of EGF remained colocalized with EGFR in TIP30 or Rab5a knockdown cells (control cells, 7 ± 3%; TIP30 knockdown cells, 36 ± 4%; Rab5a knockdown cells, 46 ± 5%; n = 60, p < 0.01 versus control cells; Fig. 5, A and C). The EGF vesicles were devoid of early endosomal markers EEA1 and Rab5a, as well as late endosomal and lysosomal marker LAMP1 (Fig. 5D), indicating that they are neither early/late endosomes nor lysosomes. We next performed EGFR internalization analysis using wild type and Tip30−/− primary hepatocytes. Consistently, Tip30 deletion increased the colocalization of EGF and EGFR nearly 2-fold (wild type primary hepatocytes, 15 ± 2%; Tip30−/− primary hepatocytes, 29 ± 2%; n = 20, p < 0.01; Fig. 5, B and C). Likewise, knockdown of ACSL4 or Endo B1 expression also increased the colocalization of EGF and EGFR (ACSL4 knockdown cells, 40 ± 8%; Endo B1 knockdown cells, 23 ± 5%; n = 60, p < 0.05 versus control cells; Figs. 5C and 6A). The majority of EGF colocalized with EGFR even after 120 min of internalization in knockdown and Tip30−/− cells (supplemental Fig. S1, A–C). Taken together, these results suggest that TIP30, ACSL4, Endo B1, and Rab5a are involved in promoting EGF dissociation from EGFR during endocytic trafficking. Endocytic vesicles gain Rab5a dynamically mostly by membrane fusion with Rab5-positive endosomes in the course of cargo transport (38Rink J. Ghigo E. Kalaidzidis Y. Zerial M. Cell. 2005; 122: 735-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). This is further supported by the observation that Rab5a is mainly localized on numerous vesicles in the perinuclear region of cells under steady state condition and is rapidly recruited to early endocytic vesicles at the cell periphery in response to EGF (35Lakadamyali M. Rust M.J. Zhuang X. Cell. 2006; 124: 997-1009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 36Leonard D. Hayakawa A. Lawe D. Lambright D. Bellve K.D. Standley C. Lifshitz L.M. Fogarty K.E. Corvera S. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 3445-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The similar effects of TIP30 and Rab5a knockdown on EGFR endocytosis prompted us to test whether TIP30 is involved in the loading of Rab5a on early endosomes. In control cells, Rab5a appeared in EGFR-positive endosomes from which EGF had exited after 60 min of EGF internalization (Fig. 6A). By contrast, the colocalization of Rab5a and EGFR was significantly decreased in TIP30 knockdown cells (control cells, 72 ± 11%; TIP30 knockdown cells, 18 ± 5%; n = 60, p < 0.01; Fig. 6, A and C) and Tip30−/− primary hepatocytes (wild type hepatocytes, 34 ± 8%; Tip30−/− hepatocytes, 12 ± 5%; n = 20, p < 0.05; Fig. 6, B and C). Similar results were obtained with ACSL4 or Endo B1 knockdown cells (ACSL4 knockdown cells, 3 ± 2%; Endo B1 knockdown cells, 27 ± 4%; n = 60, p < 0.01 versus control cells; Fig. 6, A and C). Interestingly, there were a few Rab5a-positive early endosomes in Endo B1 knockdown cells, which was probably the result of incomplete knockdown. However, these Rab5a-positive endosomes appeared different from those in control cells. They did not release EGF even after 120 min of internalization (supplemental Fig. S1B), indicating that Endo B1 has an additional function after Rab5a recruitment. This provides a possible explanation for the observation that Endo B1 knockdown cells have less EGF-EGFR colocalization and more Rab5a-EGFR overlap but have longer lasting EGFR stability when compared with TIP30 and ACSL4 knockdown cells (Figs. 4, A–F, 5C, and 6C). Together, these results indicate that TIP30, ACSL4, and Endo B1 promote efficient Rab5a localization to early endosomes. Intriguingly, we noted that Rab5a appeared in vesicles when it was not localized to EGFR-positive endosomes (Fig. 6, A and B). To further characterize those EGFR-negative Rab5a vesicles, we co-stained EEA1 and Rab5a in wild type mouse primary hepatocytes 30 min after EGF internalization. The EGFR-negative Rab5a vesicles were also negative for EEA1 and TfR (Fig. 7, A and B), suggesting that they are neither plasma membrane-derived endocytic vesicles nor recycling endosomes, but likely transporting vesicles that originate from the trans-Golgi network. Dissociation of ligand-receptor complexes inside endosomes is caused by the low luminal pH created by V-ATPases. Our previously presented results showed that lack of Rab5a in early endosomes was concomitant with delayed EGF-EGFR dissociation induced by loss of TIP30 or its interacting proteins. Rab5a did not coexist with EGF in EGFR-positive endosomes, suggesting that Rab5a vesicles may deliver V-ATPases to early endosomes to drive EGF-EGFR dissociation. To test this hypothesis, we examined the intracellular localization of V-ATPases by staining for the regulatory subunit H (ATP6V1H). ATP6V1H-positive staining was observed in Rab5a vesicles lacking EGF and EGFR in TIP30 knockdown cells (Fig. 7C). Significant reduction of ATP6V1H localization to EGFR-positive endosomes was observed in TIP30, Rab5a, ACSL4, or Endo B1 knockdown cells (control cells, 46 ± 7%; TIP30 knockdown cells, 25 ± 4%; Rab5a knockdown cells, 19 ± 1%; ACSL4 knockdown cells, 19 ± 2%; Endo B1 knockdown cells, 21 ± 1%; n = 60, p < 0.05 versus control cells; Fig. 8, A and C) and in Tip30−/− primary hepatocytes (wild type hepatocytes, 61 ± 4%; Tip30−/− hepatocytes, 23 ± 6%; n = 20, p < 0.01; Fig. 8, B and C). Moreover, in live PLC/PRF/5 cells co-expressing EYFP-Rab5a and ATP6V1H-DsRed, EGF-positive endosomes fused with Rab5a-ATP6V1H vesicles at 11 min after EGF internalization and released Alexa647-EGF 3 min after the merge (Fig. 8D). To determine whether mislocalization of V-ATPases affects endosomal acidification, we monitored endosomal pH after pHrodo-EGF:Alexa647-EGF (7:3) internalization (39Suprynowicz F.A. Krawczyk E. Hebert J.D. Sudarshan S.R. Simic V. Kamonjoh C.M. Schlegel R. J. Virol. 2010; 84: 10619-10629Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Indeed, TIP30 knockdown resulted in significantly less acidic endosomes (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). Taken together, these data indicate that Rab5a contribute to endosomal acidification by transporting V-ATPases to endocytic vesicles and that TIP30, ACSL4, and Endo B1 are required for efficient transport. The present study describes a novel protein complex consisting of TIP30, ACSL4, and Endo B1 that interacts with Rab5a and regulates EGFR endocytic trafficking. Down-regulation of these proteins results in trapping of EGF-EGFR complexes in early endosomes, which enabled us to further dissect the EGFR endocytic pathway. We uncovered two consecutive events following EGF-EGFR entrance into the early endosomes because these two events became obviously detectable when the function of the TIP30 complex was inhibited. First, newly formed endosomes are devoid of V-ATPases and Rab5a. V-ATPases are delivered to early endosomes by the Rab5a vesicles. Second, localization of Rab5a and V-ATPases to the early endosomes results in the termination of EGFR endosomal signaling. Clearly, inhibiting the function of the TIP30 complex can block the transport of V-ATPases to endosomes, leading to EGF-bound EGFR detention in endosomes, delayed EGFR endocytic degradation, and sustained activation of Akt. Given that EGF-bound EGFR enclosed in endosomes is sufficient to activate downstream molecules and to induce cell survival (40Wang Y. Pennock S. Chen X. Wang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7279-7290Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), our results indicate that enhanced EGFR signaling by inhibition of TIP30, ACSL4 and EndoB1 may contribute to the initiation and progression of cancers. Indeed, we have recently reported that Tip30 deletion in MMTV-Neu mice leads to enhanced EGFR signaling and development of estrogen receptor-positive and progesterone receptor-negative mammary tumors (41Zhang C. Mori M. Gao S. Li A. Hoshino I. Aupperlee M.D. Haslam S.Z. Xiao H. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 10224-10233Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, the regulation of EGFR-mediated endocytosis by the TIP30 complex may serve as a general mechanism to govern EGFR signaling and suppress tumorigenesis. Endo B1 belongs to a family of proteins containing N-terminal Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs (BAR) domains and is involved in apoptosis, autophagy, mitochondrial fission, and endocytic trafficking (42Takahashi Y. Meyerkord C.L. Wang H.G. Cell Death Differ. 2009; 16: 947-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The role of Endo B1 in EGFR endocytosis is consistent with a previous report that Endo B1 colocalizes with EEA1 in the early endosome of neural cells in response to nerve growth factor (43Wan J. Cheung A.Y. Fu W.Y. Wu C. Zhang M. Mobley W.C. Cheung Z.H. Ip N.Y. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 9002-9012Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that Endo B1 knock-out mice exhibited spontaneous development of lymphomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, and mammary tumors (44Takahashi Y. Meyerkord C.L. Wang H.G. Autophagy. 2008; 4: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These phenotypes resemble the phenotypes of Tip30 knock-out mice (25Ito M. Jiang C. Krumm K. Zhang X. Pecha J. Zhao J. Guo Y. Roeder R.G. Xiao H. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8763-8767PubMed Google Scholar). 3A. Li, J. Pecha, and H. Xiao, unpublished data. Thus, we speculate that TIP30 and Endo B1 may act in concert to suppress tumorigenesis, at least in part, through the regulation of EGFR-mediated endocytosis. With the identification of the interaction between TIP30 and Endo B1, this hypothesis can now be addressed. Rab family proteins have been well known to be essential for vesicle targeting (45Pfeffer S.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 487-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Rab5a is recruited to the early endosomes, where it promotes the endocytic down-regulation of EGFR and transition from endosome to lysosome. Before entering endosomes, Rab5a was found in smaller vesicles localized in the perinuclear region (36Leonard D. Hayakawa A. Lawe D. Lambright D. Bellve K.D. Standley C. Lifshitz L.M. Fogarty K.E. Corvera S. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 3445-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 46Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M. Cell. 1992; 70: 715-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). These Rab5 vesicles are redistributed to the cell periphery region, where they colocalize with EGFR in early endosomes in response to EGF treatment (17Nielsen E. Severin F. Backer J.M. Hyman A.A. Zerial M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 376-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 35Lakadamyali M. Rust M.J. Zhuang X.

Corvera S. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 3445-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Notably, newly formed endocytic vesicles containing transferrin, LDL, EGF, or influenza virus were devoid of Rab5a and acquired Rab5a through merging with Rab5a vesicles (35Lakadamyali M. Rust M.J. Zhuang X. Cell. 2006; 124: 997-1009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Our data support these observations and clearly show that besides the EEA1- and EGFR-positive endocytic vesicles, there is a population of Rab5a-positive vesicles that are negative for EEA1 and EGFR but positive for V-ATPases. Given that intracellular trafficking of EGF-EGFR or entry of dengue and West Nile viruses into HeLa cells by clathrin-mediated endocytosis requires vacuolar acidic pH and Rab5a (47Krishnan M.N. Sukumaran B. Pal U. Agaisse H. Murray J.L. Hodge T.W. Fikrig E. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 4881-4885Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), we propose that Rab5a is involved in post-trans-Golgi network transport of integral membrane proteins and helps create acidic endosomal pH by targeting V-ATPases to endosomes, thereby providing the driving force for EGFR endocytic trafficking and viral entry into host cells (Fig. 9). We were surprised to see that Alexa488-EGF vesicles pinched off from endosomes shortly after internalization. This event was observed in both human liver cancer cells and mouse primary hepatocytes. The Alexa488-EGF vesicles are previously uncharacterized vesicles that are devoid of early endosomal, recycling endosomal, and lysosomal markers, implying that EGF might exit endosomes after the dissociation with EGFR. Nevertheless, it will be important to determine whether Alexa488-EGF in these vesicles is intact or degraded.

Both peptides target the α9α10 nAChR and inhibit N-type calcium channels via GABAB receptor activation, but the mechanism of action of analgesic activity is unknown. PeIA has previously been shown to inhibit the α9α10 and α3β2 nAChRs. In this study, we have determined the structure of PeIA and shown that it is also a potent inhibitor of N-type calcium channels via GABAB receptor activation. The characteristic α-conotoxin fold is present in PeIA, but it has a different distribution of surface-exposed hydrophobic and charged residues compared with Vc1.1. Thus, the surface residue distribution, rather than the overall fold, appears to be responsible for the 50-fold increase in selectivity at the α3β2 nAChR by PeIA relative to Vc1.1. In contrast to their difference in potency at the nAChR, the equipotent activity of PeIA and Vc1.1 at the GABAB receptor suggests that the GABAB receptor is more tolerant to changes in surface residues than is the nAChR. The conserved Asp-Pro-Arg motif of Vc1.1 and RgIA, which is crucial for potency at the α9α10 nAChR, is not required for activity at GABAB receptor/N-type calcium channels because PeIA has a His-Pro-Ala motif in the equivalent position. This study shows that different structure-activity relationships are associated with the targeting of the GABAB receptor versus nAChRs. Furthermore, there is probably a much more diverse range of conotoxins that target the GABAB receptor than currently realized. α-Conotoxins are peptides from cone snails that target the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR).

They typically comprise 12–19 amino acids and are characterized by two disulfide bonds that have a CysI-CysIII and CysII-CysIV connectivity. Their three-dimensional structures incorporate an α-helix centered around CysIII (4Millard E.L. Daly N.L. Craik D.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2320-2326Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and they are regarded as rigid molecular frameworks based on their well defined secondary structure and disulfide bracing (5Hu S.H. Gehrmann J. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Martin J.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11323-11330Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). α-Conotoxins have a range of potential therapeutic applications, including the treatment of pain and disease states such as Parkinson disease (6Olivera B.M.

Toxicon. 2006; 48: 810-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). nAChRs comprise five subunits and a range of different receptor subtypes exist depending on the subunit composition of the pentamer (8Dani J.A.

Targeting individual subtypes can potentially result in drug leads with minimal side effects (10Gotti C. Riganti L. Vailati S. Clementi F. Curr. Pharm.

For example, the α9α10 nAChR subtype has been proposed as a potential target for pain relief (12McIntosh J.M. Absalom N. Chebib M. Elgoyhen A.B. Vincler M. Biochem.

Neurosci. 2008; 28: 10943-10951Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). So far, the only α-conotoxins that have been reported to be potent antagonists of the α9α10 nAChR subtype are PeIA (14McIntosh J.M. Plazas P.V. Watkins M. Gomez-Casati M.E. Olivera B.M. Elgoyhen A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30107-30112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), RgIA (15Ellison M. Haberlandt C. Gomez-Casati M.E. Watkins M. Elgoyhen A.B. McIntosh J.M.

Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 17880-17884Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). PeIA and Vc1.1 belong to the same structural subclass of α-conotoxins in that they both contain four and seven residues, respectively, in their two loops. In contrast, RgIA has four and three residues, respectively, in the two loops. The sequences of the three peptides are shown in Fig. 1, which highlights that RgIA and Vc1.1 have identical sequences in loop 1 but very different sequences in loop 2. PeIA and Vc1.1 have similar sequences in loop 2 but significantly different charge distributions in loop 1. RgIA and Vc1.1 exhibit analgesic activity in animal pain models when delivered via injection (16Vincler M. Wittenauer S. Parker R. Ellison M. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Brain Res. 2005; 1059: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and a cyclic form of Vc1.1 has been shown recently to be orally active, an exciting finding that augers well for its development as a therapeutic agent (19Clark R.J.

However, the mechanism by which the analgesic activity of these peptides is exerted is unclear. Electrophysiological studies have shown that RgIA and Vc1.1 inhibit N-type Ca2+ channel currents in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and Cav2.2 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes via activation of the G protein-coupled GABAB receptor (13Callaghan B.

The fact that the post-translationally modified version of Vc1.1 (Vc1a), which has Pro-6 hydroxylated and Glu-14 in loop 2 converted to a γ-carboxyglutamic acid, is a potent inhibitor of the α9α10 nAChR subtype but does not have analgesic activity (7Livett B.G.

Adams D.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 1406-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) suggests that GABAB activation is responsible for the analgesic activity. Furthermore, Vc1.1 reversal of mechanical allodynia is antagonized by pretreatment with the orally active GABAB receptor antagonist SCH50911 (22Klimis H. Adams D.J. Callaghan B. Nevin S. Alewood P.F.

However, RgIA and Vc1.1 do not potently displace [3H]CGP54626 binding in HEK293T cells transiently transfected with GABAB1b and GABAB2 subunits or activate human GABAB receptors coupled to G protein-activated inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK1/4) channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes (12McIntosh J.M. Absalom N. Chebib M. Elgoyhen A.B. Vincler M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2009; 78: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Thus, further studies are required to resolve the precise mechanism of action of RgIA and Vc1.1 that underlies their analgesic activity. Analysis of the structure-activity relationships of new peptides that target α9α10 or GABAB receptors might shed light on the mechanism of action of analgesic α-conotoxins. In this study, we have determined the activity of PeIA on GABAB receptor modulation of N-type Ca2+ channels for comparison with its activity at the α9α10 nAChR. We also determined the three-dimensional structure of PeIA. This study reveals that an α-conotoxin with a distinctive loop 1 compared with Vc1.1 and RgIA is also a potent inhibitor of N-type Ca2+ channels via GABAB receptor activation. PeIA was synthesized using methods described previously for Vc1.1 (23Halai R. Clark R.J. Nevin S.T. Jensen J.E. Adams D.J. Craik D.J. J. Biol.

Oxidation of the disulfide bonds was achieved by stirring overnight in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate buffer. Spectra were recorded at 600 MHz (Bruker AVANCE NMR spectrometer) on a sample containing 1 mm PeIA in 10% D2O and 90% H2O. The two-dimensional spectra were recorded and three-dimensional structures were calculated as described previously (24Millard E.L. Nevin S.T. Loughnan M.L. Nicke A. Clark R.J. Alewood P.F. Lewis R.J.

Distance restraints were obtained from a NOESY spectrum recorded with a 200-ms mixing time at 290 K. RNA preparation, oocyte preparation, and expression of nAChR subunits in oocytes obtained from Xenopus laevis were carried out as described previously (21Nevin S.T. Clark R.J. Klimis H. Christie M.J. Craik D.J. Adams D.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 1406-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Plasmids with cDNA encoding the rat α9 and α10 nAChR subunits were kindly provided by Dr. A. B. Elgoyhen (Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina), and all other nAChR subunit clones were kindly provided by Dr. J. Boulter (UCLA, Los Angeles, CA). All oocytes were injected with 5 ng of cRNA and then kept at 18 °C in ND96 buffer (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) supplemented with 50 mg/liter gentamycin, 5 mm pyruvic acid, and 5% horse serum 2–5 days before recording. Membrane currents were recorded from Xenopus oocytes using a two-electrode voltage clamp amplifier (OC-725C oocyte clamp, Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). Recording electrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass (GC150T-15, Harvard Apparatus Ltd., Edenbridge, UK) and had resistances of 0.3–1.5 megohms when filled with 3 m KCl. All recordings were conducted at room temperature (21–23 °C) using a bath solution of ND96 buffer as described above. During recordings, the oocytes were voltage-clamped in a small recording chamber (≤40 μl) at a holding potential of −80 mV and superfused continuously with ND96 buffer via gravity-fed tubes at 0.1–0.2 ml/min, with 5-min incubation times for the bath-applied conotoxins. Acetylcholine (ACh) was applied via gravity-fed tubes until peak current amplitude was obtained (1–3 s), with 1–2-min washout periods between applications. Data were sampled at 500 Hz and filtered at 200 Hz. Peak current amplitude was measured before and following incubation of the peptide. All data were pooled (n = 3–7 for each data point) and represent arithmetic means ± S.E. Concentration-response curves for antagonists were fitted by unweighted nonlinear regression to the logistic equation Ex = EmaxXn/(Xn + IC50n), where Ex is the response, Emax is the maximal response, X is the antagonist concentration, n is the slope factor, and IC50 is the antagonist concentration producing half-maximal inhibition of the agonist response. Computation was done using SigmaPlot 8.0 (Jandel Corp., San Rafael, CA). DRG neurons were enzymatically dissociated from ganglia of 7–14-day-old Wistar rats according to standard protocols. Briefly, rats were killed by cervical dislocation in accordance with the University of Queensland and RMIT University Animal Ethics Committees, the spinal column was hemisegmented, and the spinal cord was removed. Ganglia were removed, rinsed in cold Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen), minced, and incubated in 1 mg/ml collagenase (type 2, 405 units/mg; Worthington) in Hanks' balanced salt solution at 37 °C for ∼30 min. Following incubation, ganglia were rinsed three times with warm (37 °C) DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin and gently triturated with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette. Cells were plated on glass coverslips, incubated at 37 °C in 95% O2 and 5% CO2, and used within 4–36 h. The external recording solution for rat DRG neurons contained 150 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 2 mm BaCl2, 10 mm d-glucose, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3–7.4. Recording electrodes were filled with an internal solution containing 140 mm CsCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MgATP, 0.1 mm NaGTP, 5 mm 1,2-bis(O-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetracesium salt, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, with CsOH and had resistances of 1.0–2.5 megohms. Membrane currents were recorded using the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). A voltage protocol using step depolarizations from −80 to −10 mV was used when examining high voltage-activated (HVA) Ca2+ channel currents. Test potentials of 150-ms duration were applied every 20 s. CGP55845 hydrochloride was obtained from Tocris Bioscience (Bristol, UK), and ω-conotoxin CVID was prepared as described previously (25Lewis R.J. Nielsen K.J. Craik D.J. Loughnan M.L. Adams D.A.

Leak and capacitive currents were subtracted using a −P/4 pulse protocol. Currents were generated by a computer using pCLAMP 9.2 software (Molecular Devices Corp.), filtered at 2 kHz, and sampled at 8 kHz with a Digidata 1322A digitizer (Molecular Devices Corp.). Sampled data were stored digitally on a computer for further analysis. PeIA was synthesized using solid-phase chemistry, and one major disulfide isomer was formed during oxidation. We confirmed that this isomer contained the native disulfide connectivity using an analysis of NMR chemical shifts compared with Vc1.1, as shown in Fig. 2A. The three-dimensional structure of PeIA was determined using simulated annealing based on NMR data, and the ensemble of the 20 lowest energy structures is shown in Fig. 2B. The major element of secondary structure is an α-helix spanning residues 6–10. In addition, type I β-turns are present at residues 1–4, 2–5, and 9–12. The secondary structure present in PeIA is similar to that determined for Vc1.1 (24Millard E.L. Nevin S.T. Loughnan M.L. Nicke A. Clark R.J. Alewood P.F. Lewis R.J. Adams D.J. Craik D.J. Daly N.L. J.

The activity of the synthesized α-conotoxin PeIA was assessed on ACh-evoked currents in Xenopus oocytes expressing different nAChR subunit combinations. Concentration-response curves revealed an inhibition of α9α10 and α3β2 nAChR currents with IC50 values and Hill slopes of 54.9 ± 9.0 nm (n ≥ 4) and nH = 0.6 and 97.5 ± 10.9 nm (n ≥ 4) and nH = 0.8, respectively (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, no significant inhibition of ACh-evoked currents was observed at α4β2, human α7, and muscle αβγδ nAChRs in the presence of 1 μm PeIA. Depolarization-activated whole-cell Ba2+ currents elicited by voltage steps from a holding potential of −80 to −10 mV were inhibited by PeIA in a concentration-dependent manner. The concentration-response relationship obtained for inhibition of HVA Ca2+ channel currents in rat DRG neurons by PeIA gave an IC50 of 1.1 nm (Fig. 4, A and B). In the presence of the selective N-type Ca2+ channel inhibitor ω-conotoxin CVID, 100 nm PeIA failed to further inhibit the inward Ba2+ current. CVID (200 nm) alone reduced the Ca2+ channel current amplitude to 57.2 ± 10.8% of the control, and in the presence of CVID + PeIA, the current amplitude was 53.6 ± 12.7% of the control (n = 4) (Fig. 4C). The expression of the GABAB1 and GABAB2 receptor subunits in rat DRG neurons has been confirmed at both the mRNA and protein levels (26Towers S. Princivalle A. Billinton A. Edmunds M. Bettler B. Urban L. Castro-Lopes J. Bowery N.G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 3201-3210Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Furthermore, inhibition of N-type Ca2+ channel currents in rat DRG neurons by the GABAB agonist baclofen has been reported previously (27Dolphin A.C. Scott R.H. J. Physiol. 1987; 386: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 28Tatebayashi H. Ogata N. J. Physiol. 1992; 447: 391-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 29Campbell V. Berrow N. Dolphin A.C. J. Physiol. 1993; 470: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The inhibition of HVA Ca2+ channel currents by PeIA (100 nm) was antagonized in the presence of the selective GABAB receptor antagonist CGP55845A (1 μm) to 87.9 ± 6.1% of the control (n = 8) (Fig. 4D). Lower concentrations of CGP55845 (100 and 300 nm) also antagonized the effects of PeIA (n = 3) (Fig. 4B). Bath application of 1 μm CGP55845A alone did not affect HVA Ca2+ channel current amplitude (96.4 ± 5.1% of the control). In preliminary experiments, PeIA (100 nm) inhibited the peak amplitude of depolarization-activated Ca2+ channel currents to 63.3 ± 4.4% (n = 3) of the control in baclofen-sensitive Xenopus oocytes expressing recombinant Cav2.2 (α1B-b + α2δ + β3) (13Callaghan B. Haythornthwaite A. Berecki G. Clark R.J. Craik D.J. Adams D.J. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 10943-10951Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that PeIA inhibits ω-conotoxin-sensitive N-type Ca2+ channels via activation of the G protein-coupled GABAB receptor in DRG neurons. We report here, for the first time, that PeIA is a new member of the select group of conotoxins known to target G protein-coupled GABAB receptors as well as the α9α10 nAChR. The inhibition of N-type Ca2+ channels via GABAB receptor modulation in DRG neurons by PeIA is similar to that reported for Vc1.1 (1.1 nm for PeIA compared with 1.7 nm for Vc1.1) (13Callaghan B. Haythornthwaite A. Berecki G. Clark R.J. Craik D.J. Adams D.J. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 10943-10951Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Our observations allow some deductions regarding structure-activity relationships to be made. As well as their shared Cys framework, PeIA and Vc1.1 share two residues in common in loop 1 (Ser-4 and Pro-6) and four residues in loop 2 (residues 12–14 are identical, and residue 15 involves a conservative Leu-to-Ile substitution). Consequently, it appears that the residues that differ, i.e. residues 5 and 7 and residues 9–11, are not critically important for activity at the GABAB receptor based on the similar levels of activity for the two peptides. In particular, our results clearly show that there is not an absolute requirement for a negatively charged residue at position 5 and a positively charged residue at position 7 for GABAB receptor activity, as might have been supposed from the conservation of these residues in Vc1.1 and RgIA. The results further suggest that there is probably a much more diverse range of conotoxins that target the GABAB receptor than is currently realized based on the substantial differences seen in loop 1 between PeIA on the one hand and Vc1.1 and RgIA on the other. The activities of PeIA and Vc1.1 at the α9α10 nAChR are also similar, but there are differences observed for other nAChR subtypes. For instance, PeIA is a potent antagonist of the α3β2 subtype, whereas Vc1.1 is >50-fold less active (14McIntosh J.M. Plazas P.V. Watkins M. Gomez-Casati M.E. Olivera B.M. Elgoyhen A.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 2006; 281: 23254-23263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). A comparison of the structures of PeIA and Vc1.1 is shown in Fig. 2 (B and C). The overall fold of PeIA is similar to that of Vc1.1, but there are differences in the surface characteristics of PeIA in terms of the distribution of charged and hydrophobic residues. These surface differences presumably account for the differences in activity at specific nAChR subtypes. Mutagenesis studies on Vc1.1 (23Halai R. Clark R.J. Nevin S.T. Jensen J.E. Adams D.J. Craik D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 20275-20284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and RgIA (31Ellison M. Feng Z.P. Park A.J. Zhang X. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. Norton R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 377: 1216-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) have shown that the Asp-Pro-Arg motif in loop 1 is crucial for activity at the α9α10 nAChR. However, in PeIA, the equivalent residues are His-Pro-Ala, yet it remains a potent antagonist of the α9α10 nAChR. Interestingly, mutation of Arg-7 in Vc1.1 to alanine, the equivalent residue in PeIA, significantly decreases activity at the α9α10 receptor. Our observations reported here suggest that the loss of the positive charge at position 7 in Vc1.1 can be compensated for by the introduction of a positive charge at position 5. It is likely that the proline residue in PeIA will also be critical for activity, but this probably derives from a structural, rather than functional, role of this residue. Previous studies have shown that when this proline is mutated to alanine in Vc1.1, significant perturbations in structure are observed (23Halai R. Clark R.J. Nevin S.T. Jensen J.E. Adams D.J. Craik D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 20275-20284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we recently showed that a naturally occurring α-conotoxin, LtIa, which does not contain this conserved proline, does not have a well defined structure in solution (32Luo S. Akondi K.B. Zhangsun D. Wu Y. Zhu X. Hu Y. Christensen S. Dowell C. Daly N.L. Craik D.J. Wang C.I. Lewis R.J. Alewood P.F. McIntosh J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 12355-12366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). PeIA, Vc1.1, and RgIA all have different pI values, varying from 4.5 to 9, and this distinction is reflected in the charge distribution on the surfaces of these molecules. These differences appear more critical at the nAChR based on the different potencies observed at different subtypes. By contrast, the three peptides have similar potency at the GABAB/N-type Ca2+ channel, indicating that electrostatic interactions are not crucial for activity at this receptor. A more complete understanding of the structure-activity relationships of α-conotoxins will require further mutational studies and the testing of naturally occurring α-conotoxins at a range of membrane receptors, but the studies reported here provide a valuable starting point. In summary, we have shown that PeIA has a well defined three-dimensional structure in solution and report for the first time that it is a potent inhibitor of N-type Ca2+ channels coupled to GABAB receptors. The information reported here on the structure-activity relationships of α-conotoxins that have applications as analgesic agents should potentially be useful in the design of novel drug leads for the treatment of pain."

https://openalex.org/W2020893519,"Protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes are key signal transducers involved in normal physiology and disease and have been widely implicated in cancer progression. Despite our extensive knowledge of the signaling pathways regulated by PKC isozymes and their effectors, there is essentially no information on how individual members of the PKC family regulate gene transcription. Here, we report the first PKC isozyme-specific analysis of global gene expression by microarray using RNAi depletion of diacylglycerol/phorbol ester-regulated PKCs. A thorough analysis of this microarray data revealed unique patterns of gene expression controlled by PKCα, PKCδ, and PKCε, which are remarkably different in cells growing in serum or in response to phorbol ester stimulation. PKCδ is the most relevant isoform in controlling the induction of genes by phorbol ester stimulation, whereas PKCε predominantly regulates gene expression in serum. We also established that two PKCδ-regulated genes, FOSL1 and BCL2A1, mediate the apoptotic effect of phorbol esters or the chemotherapeutic agent etoposide in prostate cancer cells. Our studies offer a unique opportunity for establishing novel transcriptional effectors for PKC isozymes and may have significant functional and therapeutic implications."

The human genome is continuously challenged by all kinds of genotoxic stress, such as ultraviolet light, ionizing radiation, and endogeneous processes, including recombination during normal immunological response and at stalled replication forks (1Sancar A. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Unsal-Kaçmaz K. Linn S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2516) Google Scholar, 2Branzei D. Foiani M. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Severe DNA lesions, such as double-strand breaks (DSBs) 2The abbreviations used are: DSB, double-strand break; HR, homologous recombination; MBP, maltose binding protein; IR, ionizing radiation; RPA, replication protein A. and DNA cross-links, have to be appropriately repaired for cell survival. Inefficient or inaccurate repair of these lesions often lead to genomic instability and ultimately initiate cancer development (4Jeggo P.A. Löbrich M. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 7717-7719Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 5McKinnon P.J. Caldecott K.W. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2007; 8: 37-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). DSBs are repaired mainly via two parallel repair pathways: the nonhomologous end-joining pathway and homologous recombination (HR) pathway. HR is particularly important for the repair of DSBs due to its ability to restore the genetic information, whereas repair via nonhomologous end-joining may potentially lead to deletions and mutations. The central component in the HR pathway is RAD51, which is the major recombinase in mitotic cells and also plays a critical role during meiosis. RAD51 is the human homologue of Escherichia coli RecA. It ensures high fidelity DNA repair by facilitating strand exchange between homologous DNA segments (6Ogawa T. Yu X. Shinohara A. Egelman E.H. Science. 1993; 259: 1896-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 7Sung P. Robberson D.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 453-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). BRCA2 is another key protein in HR, as it mediates the loading of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA and stabilizing RAD51 filaments (8Lord C.J. Ashworth A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 461-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 9Pellegrini L. Venkitaraman A. Trends Biochem.

BRCA2 is encoded by a tumor suppressor gene that, when mutated, greatly elevates risks for breast and ovarian cancer. Recently, another tumor suppressor PALB2 (partner and localizer of BRCA2) was also found to associate with BRCA2 and be required for the loading of the BRCA2-RAD51 repair complex onto DNA (11Xia B.

PALB2 also serves as the molecular scaffold to link BRCA2 with the BRCA1 tumor suppressor (12Sy S.M. Huen M.S. Chen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Biol. 2009; 19: 524-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). In addition to BRCA2/PALB2, other important HR mediators are the five RAD51 paralogues (RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, XRCC2, and XRCC3), which are required for the assembly of DNA damage-induced RAD51 foci, and cell lines with defects in any of these RAD51 paralogues are defective in HR (14Takata M.

Given the importance of HR in the maintenance of genomic stability, it is not surprising that germ line mutations in many of the HR repair components, such as BRCA1, BRCA2, and PALB2, are associated with various human genetic disorders and cancers. Two recent studies identified biallelic mutations in RAD51C, which lead to Fanconi anemia-like disorder, and a monoallelic mutation in RAD51C that is associated with increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer (17Meindl A.

Although Swi5-Sfr1 complex participates in an Rhp51 (the fission yeast RAD51 homologue)-dependent HR pathway (22Akamatsu Y. Dziadkowiec D. Ikeguchi M. Shinagawa H. Iwasaki H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The siRNA transfection was performed using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection was repeated once with an interval of 24 h to achieve maximal RNA interference effect. RT-PCR was performed by using ProtoScript M-MuLV TaqRT-PCR Kit (New England Biolabs) following the manufacturer's instructions. The primers for SWI5 were 5′-TCTCTAGGACTGAACCAAGAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTCGCTGGAAACTCTGTAGGTG-3′ (reverse), yielding a 439-bp PCR product.

Human MEI5 (C10orf78) cDNA was obtained from human ORFeome collection (hORFeome version 5.1, GenBankTM accession no. BC020892). All cDNAs were subcloned into pDONR201 (Invitrogen) as entry clones and were subsequently transferred to gateway compatible destination vectors for the expression of N-terminal-tagged fusion protein. SFB (triple-epitope of S-protein, FLAG, and streptavidin binding peptide), Myc, MBP, and GST-tagged proteins were used in this study as described in the text. All point or deletion mutants were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and verified by sequencing. For co-immunoprecipitation assays, constructs encoding SFB-tagged and Myc-tagged proteins were transiently co-transfected into 293T cells. Cells were lysed in NETN buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) on ice for 30 min, cleared by centrifugation, and incubated with S protein beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed, boiled in 2× Laemmli buffer, and separated on SDS-PAGE. Membranes were blocked in 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline/Tween buffer and then probed with antibodies as indicated. For direct binding assays, bacterially purified MBP-tagged and GST-tagged proteins were incubated together in NETN buffer containing glutatione-agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed, boiled in 2× Laemmli buffer, and separated on SDS-PAGE. Cells cultured on coverslips were treated with ionizing radiation (IR) and then allowed to recover. Cells were then washed with PBS, pre-extracted with solution containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 3 min and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 12 min. Coverslips were washed with PBS and then immunostained with primary antibodies in 5% goat serum for 30 min at room temperature. Coverslips were washed and incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated with rhodemine or FITC for 30 min. Cells were subsequently stained with DAPI for the visualization of nuclear DNA. The coverslips were mounted onto glass slides with anti-fade solution and visualized under a Nikon ECLIPSE E800 fluorescence microscope with a Nikon Plan Fluor 40× oil objective lens (numerical aperture, 1.30) at room temperature. Cells were photographed and analyzed using a SPOT camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.) and Adobe Photoshop software. A U2OS cell clone stably expressing HR reporter direct repeat GFP was described previously (28Weinstock D.M. Nakanishi K. Helgadottir H.R. Jasin M. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 409: 524-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This reporter consists of two differentially mutated GFP genes oriented as direct repeats. Expression of I-SceI endonuclease will generate a site-specific DSB between the mutated GFP genes, which when repaired by gene conversion, results in a functional GFP gene. Briefly, 2 days after transfection with indicated siRNAs, 1 × 106 U2OS direct repeat GFP cells were electroporated with 20 μg of pCBASce, an I-SceI expression vector described previously (29Richardson C. Moynahan M.E. Jasin M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3831-3842Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 2 days after electroporation and subjected to flow cytometry analysis to determine percentages of GFP-positive cells, resulted from HR repair induced by I-SceI-induced DSBs. A total of 1 × 103 cells were seeded onto a 60-mm dish in triplicate. Twenty-four hours after seeding, cells were irradiated by using a JL Shepherd Mark I-68A 137Cs-irradiator at indicated doses and incubated for 14 days. Resulting colonies were fixed and stained with Coomassie Blue. Numbers of colonies were counted using a GelDoc with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). To identify human homologues of yeast Swi5 and Mei5, we used BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) to search for human proteins with Swi5 or Mei5 domains, similar to budding yeast Sae3 or Mei5. Two uncharacterized proteins, C9orf119 and C10orf78, are found to contain Swi5 and Mei5 domains, respectively (Fig. 1A). The C9orf119 gene is located at chromosome 9q34.11. This gene encodes a protein of 235 amino acids. The C10orf78 gene is located at chromosome 10q25.1, which encodes a protein of 232 amino acids. Although the Swi5 domain sits at the C terminus of C9orf119, the Mei5 domain occupies a major portion of C10orf78. Here, we designated C9orf119 as human SWI5 and C10orf78 as human MEI5. We selected several Swi5 and Mei5 homologues from different organisms and performed multiple sequence alignment using the ClustalW2 program (see Fig. 1A and supplemental Figs. 1 and 2). A conserved coiled-coil motif was identified in both Swi5 and Mei5 from different species (Fig. 1A and supplemental Figs. 1 and 2). As we will show below in Fig. 2, the coiled-coil motif of MEI5 is required for its interaction with SWI5, but the role of coiled-coil motif in SWI5 remains to be determined. The SWI5-MEI5 counterpart in budding yeast, Sae3-Mei5, is only expressed during meiosis (20Hayase A. Takagi M. Miyazaki T. Oshiumi H. Shinohara M. Shinohara A. Cell. 2004; 119: 927-940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 21Tsubouchi H. Roeder G.S. Genetics. 2004; 168: 1219-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 30McKee A.H. Kleckner N. Genetics. 1997; 146: 817-834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When we searched human expressed sequence tag (EST) database using UniGene entry Hs.259594 for SWI5 and Hs.93667 for MEI5, we found that both SWI5 and MEI5 are expressed in testis and ovary, but they are also expressed in many other tissues (data not shown). Indeed, the expression of SWI5 and MEI5 was easily detected by RT-PCR in all the nonmeiotic cell lines tested so far (data not shown), suggesting that the expression of human SWI5 and MEI5 is not restricted to meiosis. The SWI5 and MEI5 homologues in yeasts have been shown to form a stable complex in vivo and in vitro. To check whether human SWI5 and MEI5 also interact with each other, we first performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using epitope-tagged SWI5 and MEI5. We found that SFB-tagged SWI5 strongly interacted with Myc-tagged MEI5, and the reverse experiment confirmed this result (Fig. 1B). C1orf57 is another uncharacterized protein in the database, and we used it here as an unbiased control. It did not bind to either SWI5 or MEI5 (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, we found that the expression of tagged SWI5 or MEI5 was greatly enhanced when they were co-expressed in the cell (Fig. 1B), which indicates that SWI5 and MEI5 form a stable complex in vivo and are mutually interdependent for their stability. To verify a direct interaction between SWI5 and MEI5, we expressed and purified MBP-tagged and GST-tagged SWI5 or MEI5 from E. coli. Pulldown assay demonstrated that SWI5 and MEI5 bind directly to each other (Fig. 1C). Together, these data support that human SWI5 and MEI5 form a stable complex. To further determine the interaction between SWI5 and MEI5, we generated a series of truncation or internal deletion mutants of SWI5 and MEI5 (Fig. 2, A and D). As mentioned above, there are conserved coiled-coil motifs found in both Swi5 and Mei5 domains (supplemental Figs. 1 and 2). The coiled-coil motif is often involved in dimerization, oligomerization, and protein-protein interaction. However, we did not detect any homo-dimer or homo-oligomer formation for SWI5 or MEI5 (data not shown). The coiled-coil motif in SWI5 is not required for the binding of SWI5 to MEI5 because the SWI5 mutant deleted of this coiled-coil motif still associated with MEI5 (Fig. 2B), and a point mutation of a conserved residue in this coiled-coil domain of SWI5 (L173P) also failed to disrupt the binding of SWI5 to MEI5 (Fig. 2C). The MEI5-binding domain is located at the C terminus of SWI5, which constitutes the most conservative part of Swi5 domain (Fig. 2, A and B, and supplemental Fig. 1). The binding assays performed between SWI5 and various mutants of MEI5 indicate that a fragment of MEI5 (residues 120–180), which contains the coiled-coil motif of MEI5, is required for the binding of MEI5 to SWI5 (Fig. 2, D and E), suggesting that the coiled-coil motif of MEI5 may be involved in the formation of this conserved SWI5-MEI5 complex in humans. Studies in budding and fission yeasts have revealed that the Swi5 and Mei5 are necessary for HR-mediated DNA repair and meiotic recombination, probably through interacting with the recombinases Rad51 and Dmc1 (20Hayase A. Takagi M. Miyazaki T. Oshiumi H. Shinohara M. Shinohara A. Cell. 2004; 119: 927-940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 22Akamatsu Y. Dziadkowiec D. Ikeguchi M. Shinagawa H. Iwasaki H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 15770-15775Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The broad expression profile of human SWI5 and MEI5 in various tissues and cell lines suggests a potential role of human SWI5-MEI5 in HR mediated DNA repair in mitotic cells. We first checked the interaction between SWI5-MEI5 and human RAD51. GST-tagged SWI5 or MEI5 and MBP-tagged RAD51 were expressed in E. coli, purified, and used in GST pull-down assays. We repeatedly detected the binding of SWI5 or MEI5 with RAD51, with the interaction between SWI5 and RAD51 much stronger than that of MEI5 and RAD51 (Fig. 3A). The conserved SWI5-MEI5 complex formation and the direct binding of this complex to RAD51 suggest that the human SWI5-MEI5 complex may play a role in HR repair. To test whether SWI5 and MEI5 are required in HR mediated DNA repair, sets of siRNAs specifically targeting SWI5 or MEI5 were synthesized and introduced into U2OS cells. All four SWI5-specific siRNAs worked well because they led to significant down-regulation of SWI5 transcripts as detected by RT-PCR. The down-regulation of MEI5 by its siRNAs was also noticeable, although it was not as efficient as that of SWI5 siRNAs (Fig. 3B). It is believed that at least a fraction of HR repair is initiated via DSB end resection, which generates ssDNA overhangs rapidly bound by RPA. Subsequently, the central recombinase enzyme RAD51, with the help of its accessory factors, displaces RPA from ssDNA to form a RAD51 filament, which starts homology search and HR repair. Thus, RPA and RAD51 foci formation can be used as readouts for two different steps during HR repair. Although RPA foci formation indicates the generation of ssDNA regions after DSB induction, the formation of RAD51 foci can be used as an indicator of actively ongoing HR repair process (26Yuan J. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 1097-1104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 31Huang J. Huen M.S. Kim H. Leung C.C. Glover J.N. Yu X. Chen J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 592-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). We checked both RPA and RAD51 foci formation after IR treatment in the control, SWI5- or MEI5-depleted U2OS cells. We did not detect any obvious changes in RPA foci formation following SWI5 or MEI5 down-regulation; however, RAD51 foci formation was greatly impaired in cells transfected with SWI5 or MEI5 siRNAs (Fig. 3C, also see supplemental Fig. 3 for representative immunostaining images). Moreover, we examined HR efficiency using the established direct repeat GFP reporter system (28Weinstock D.M. Nakanishi K. Helgadottir H.R. Jasin M. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 409: 524-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In agreement with the results of reduced RAD51 foci formation, the efficiency of HR repair was clearly decreased in cells with SWI5 or MEI5 down-regulation (Fig. 3D). Consistently, down-regulation of SWI5 or MEI5 by siRNAs also resulted in increased cellular sensitivity to IR (Fig. 3E). Taken together, these data support an important role of the human SWI5-MEI5 complex in HR-mediated DNA repair. In this study, we report the identification and characterization of the human SWI5-MEI5 complex. This complex directly binds to RAD51 and promotes RAD51 focus formation following DNA damage. Together, these data support that SWI5-MEI5 is another mediator involved in homologous recombination repair in humans. During the preparation of our article, the mouse homologues of SWI5-MEI5 (or Swi5-Sfr1) was identified (32Akamatsu Y. Jasin M. PLoS Genet. 2010; 6: e1001160Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In that study, mouse Swi5-Sfr1 was identified as a complex required for genomic integrity with a specific role in the repair of DNA strand breaks (32Akamatsu Y. Jasin M. PLoS Genet. 2010; 6: e1001160Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, HR defects in Swi5−/− and Sfr1−/− embryonic stem cells were relatively mild (32Akamatsu Y. Jasin M. PLoS Genet. 2010; 6: e1001160Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The variation in the severity of HR defect between human and mouse when SWI5-MEI5 is depleted could be due to different cells used in these studies. Alternatively, it may reflect the difference in the utilization of the SWI5-MEI5 complex in HR repair in embryonic stem cells versus adult somatic cells. Future experiments are needed to distinguish these possibilities. The possible function of human SWI5-MEI5 in meiosis also needs to be investigated. It remains to be determined whether the human SWI5-MEI5 complex acts in meiosis and, if it does, whether it acts with DMC1, RAD51, or both. Considering that SWI5-MEI5 is the only human counterpart of the yeast Sae3-Mei5 complex, we speculate that SWI5-MEI5 may play important roles both in mitotic and meiotic homologous recombination reactions. Further experimentation on SWI5-MEI5 will reveal molecular mechanisms underlying HR process in humans, which is critical for the prevention of many human diseases including infertility and cancer.

https://openalex.org/W2025496902,"Recently, mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH-2) was reported to reduce ischemic damage in an experimental myocardial infarction model. ALDH-2 activity is redox-sensitive. Therefore, we here compared effects of various electrophiles (organic nitrates, reactive fatty acid metabolites, or oxidants) on the activity of ALDH-2 with special emphasis on organic nitrate-induced inactivation of the enzyme, the biochemical correlate of nitrate tolerance. Recombinant human ALDH-2 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli; activity was determined with an HPLC-based assay, and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species formation was determined by chemiluminescence, fluorescence, protein tyrosine nitration, and diaminonaphthalene nitrosation. The organic nitrate glyceryl trinitrate caused a severe concentration-dependent decrease in enzyme activity, whereas incubation with pentaerythritol tetranitrate had only minor effects. 4-Hydroxynonenal, an oxidized prostaglandin J(2), and 9- or 10-nitrooleate caused a significant inhibition of ALDH-2 activity, which was improved in the presence of Mg(2+) and Ca(2+). Hydrogen peroxide and NO generation caused only minor inhibition of ALDH-2 activity, whereas peroxynitrite generation or bolus additions lead to severe impairment of the enzymatic activity, which was prevented by the thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase (Trx/TrxR) system. In the presence of glyceryl trinitrate and to a lesser extent pentaerythritol tetranitrate, ALDH-2 may be switched to a peroxynitrite synthase. Electrophiles of different nature potently regulate the enzymatic activity of ALDH-2 and thereby may influence the resistance to ischemic damage in response to myocardial infarction. The Trx/TrxR system may play an important role in this process because it not only prevents inhibition of ALDH-2 but is also inhibited by the ALDH-2 substrate 4-hydroxynonenal."
https://openalex.org/W2044672072,"DYRK1A (dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A) has been shown to be involved in learning and memory impairments in Alzheimer disease and Down syndrome. As a homolog of Drosophila minibrain gene, DYRK1A also plays important roles in neurodevelopment; however, the function and regulatory mechanism of DYRK1A in neurodevelopment remain elusive. REST (RE1 silencing transcription factor) plays vital roles in neuronal differentiation. Here, we found that REST can activate DYRK1A transcription via a neuron-restrictive silencer element at bp −833 to −815 of human DYRK1A promoter. The coordinated expression of DYRK1A and REST in mouse brain further supports the cross-interaction of DYRK1A and REST during neurodevelopment. Moreover, we showed that DYRK1A dosage imbalance reduced REST protein stability and transcriptional activity through facilitating ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of REST protein. Therefore, the regulation of DYRK1A by REST in a negative feedback loop suggests that DYRK1A and REST are closely related in neurodevelopment."
https://openalex.org/W2060303574,"The Drosophila argonaute2 (ago2) gene plays a major role in siRNA mediated RNA silencing pathways. Unlike mammalian Argonaute proteins, the Drosophila protein has an unusual amino-terminal domain made up largely of multiple copies of glutamine-rich repeats (GRRs). We report here that the ago2 locus produces an alternative transcript that encodes a putative short isoform without this amino-terminal domain. Several ago2 mutations previously reported to be null alleles only abolish expression of the long, GRR-containing isoform. Analysis of drop out (dop) mutations had previously suggested that variations in GRR copy number result in defects in RNAi and embryonic development. However, we find that dop mutations genetically complement transcript-null alleles of ago2 and that ago2 alleles with variant GRR copy numbers support normal development. In addition, we show that the assembly of the central RNAi machinery, the RISC (RNA induced silencing complex), is unimpaired in embryos when GRR copy number is altered. In fact, we find that GRR copy number is highly variable in natural D. melanogaster populations as well as in laboratory strains. Finally, while many other insects share an extensive, glutamine-rich Ago2 amino-terminal domain, its primary sequence varies drastically between species. Our data indicate that GRR variation does not modulate an essential function of Ago2 and that the amino-terminal domain of Ago2 is subject to rapid evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2007676805,"Insulin regulates glucose uptake through effects on the trafficking of the glucose transporter Glut4. To investigate the degree of overlap between Glut4 and the general endocytic pathways, the kinetics of trafficking of Glut4 and the receptors for transferrin (Tf) and α2-macroglobulin (α-2-M; LRP-1) were compared using quantitative flow cytometric assays. Insulin increased the exocytic rate constant (kex) for both Glut4 and Tf. However, the kex of Glut4 was 5–15 times slower than Tf in both basal and insulin-stimulated cells. The endocytic rate constant (ken) of Glut4 was also five times slower than Tf. Insulin did not affect the ken of either protein. In basal cells, the ken for α-2-M/LRP-1 was similar to Glut4 but 5-fold slower than Tf. Insulin increased ken for α-2-M/LRP-1 by 30%. In contrast, the kex for LRP-1 was five times faster than Glut4 in basal cells, and insulin did not increase this rate constant. Thus, although there is overlap in the protein machineries/compartments utilized, the differences in trafficking kinetics indicate that Glut4, the Tf receptor, and LRP-1 are differentially processed both within the cell and at the plasma membrane. It has been reported that insulin decreases the ken of Glut4 in adipocytes. However, the effect of exocytosis on the “internalization” assays was not considered. Because it is counterintuitive, the effect of exocytosis on these assays is often overlooked in endocytosis studies. Using mathematical modeling and simulation, we show that the reported decrease in Glut4 ken can be entirely accounted for by the well established increase in Glut4 kex.

https://openalex.org/W2089817347,"Background Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells residing in the connective tissue of many organs and holding great potential for tissue repair. In culture, human MSCs (hMSCs) are capable of extensive proliferation without showing chromosomal aberrations. Large numbers of hMSCs can thus be acquired from small samples of easily obtainable tissues like fat and bone marrow. MSCs can contribute to regeneration indirectly by secretion of cytokines or directly by differentiation into specialized cell types. The latter mechanism requires their long-term acceptance by the recipient. Although MSCs do not elicit immune responses in vitro, animal studies have revealed that allogeneic and xenogeneic MSCs are rejected. Methodology/Principal Findings We aim to overcome MSC immune rejection through permanent down-regulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins on the surface of these MHC class II-negative cells through the use of viral immune evasion proteins. Transduction of hMSCs with a retroviral vector encoding the human cytomegalovirus US11 protein resulted in strong inhibition of MHC class I surface expression. When transplanted into immunocompetent mice, persistence of the US11-expressing and HLA-ABC-negative hMSCs at levels resembling those found in immunodeficient (i.e., NOD/SCID) mice could be attained provided that recipients' natural killer (NK) cells were depleted prior to cell transplantation. Conclusions/Significance Our findings demonstrate the potential utility of herpesviral immunoevasins to prevent rejection of xenogeneic MSCs. The observation that down-regulation of MHC class I surface expression renders hMSCs vulnerable to NK cell recognition and cytolysis implies that multiple viral immune evasion proteins are likely required to make hMSCs non-immunogenic and thereby universally transplantable."
https://openalex.org/W2056122831,"Oxidative stress is due to an imbalance of antioxidant/pro-oxidant homeostasis and is associated with the progression of several neurological diseases, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Furthermore, oxidative stress is responsible for the neuronal loss and dysfunction associated with disease pathogenesis. Survivin is a member of the inhibitors of the apoptosis (IAP) family of proteins, but its neuroprotective effects have not been studied. Here, we demonstrate that SurR9-C84A, a survivin mutant, has neuroprotective effects against H₂O₂-induced neurotoxicity. Our results show that H₂O₂ toxicity is associated with an increase in cell death, mitochondrial membrane depolarisation, and the expression of cyclin D1 and caspases 9 and 3. In addition, pre-treatment with SurR9-C84A reduces cell death by decreasing both the level of mitochondrial depolarisation and the expression of cyclin D1 and caspases 9 and 3. We further show that SurR9-C84A increases the antioxidant activity of GSH-peroxidase and catalase, and effectively counteracts oxidant activity following exposure to H₂O₂. These results suggest for the first time that SurR9-C84A is a promising treatment to protect neuronal cells against H₂O₂-induced neurotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2062449799,"Angiogenesis is a hallmark of tumor development and metastasis and now a validated target for cancer treatment. We previously reported that a novel dimer peptide (apoEdp) derived from the receptor binding region of human apolipoprotein E (apoE) inhibits virus-induced angiogenesis. However, its role in tumor anti-angiogenesis is unknown. This study demonstrates that apoEdp has anti-angiogenic property in vivo through reduction of tumor growth in a mouse model and ocular angiogenesis in a rabbit eye model. Our in vitro studies show that apoEdp inhibits human umbilical vein endothelial cell proliferation, migration, invasion and capillary tube formation. We document that apoEdp inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor-induced Flk-1 activation as well as downstream signaling pathways that involve c-Src, Akt, eNOS, FAK, and ERK1/2. These in vitro data suggest potential sites of the apoE dipeptide inhibition that could occur in vivo. This is the first evidence that a synthetic dimer peptide mimicking human apoE has anti-angiogenesis functions and could be an anti-tumor drug candidate."
https://openalex.org/W2069978642,"RNA turnover and RNA editing are essential for regulation of mitochondrial gene expression in Trypanosoma brucei. RNA turnover is controlled in part by RNA 3' adenylation and uridylation status, with trans-acting factors also impacting RNA homeostasis. However, little is known about the mitochondrial degradation machinery or its regulation in T. brucei. We have identified a mitochondrial exoribonuclease, TbRND, whose expression is highly up-regulated in the insect proliferative stage of the parasite. TbRND shares sequence similarity with RNase D family enzymes but differs from all reported members of this family in possessing a CCHC zinc finger domain. In vitro, TbRND exhibits 3' to 5' exoribonuclease activity, with specificity toward uridine homopolymers, including the 3' oligo(U) tails of guide RNAs (gRNAs) that provide the sequence information for RNA editing. Several lines of evidence generated from RNAi-mediated knockdown and overexpression cell lines indicate that TbRND functions in gRNA metabolism in vivo. First, TbRND depletion results in gRNA tails extended by 2-3 nucleotides on average. Second, overexpression of wild type but not catalytically inactive TbRND results in a substantial decrease in the total gRNA population and a consequent inhibition of RNA editing. The observed effects on the gRNA population are specific as rRNAs, which are also 3'-uridylated, are unaffected by TbRND depletion or overexpression. Finally, we show that gRNA binding proteins co-purify with TbRND. In summary, TbRND is a novel 3' to 5' exoribonuclease that appears to have evolved a function highly specific to the mitochondrion of trypanosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2052026144,"The handicap theory of sexual selection posits that male display traits that are favored in mate choice come at a significant cost to performance. We tested one facet of this hypothesis in the green swordtail (Xiphophorus helleri). In this species, the lower ray of male caudal fin is extended into a 'sword', which serves to attract potential mates. However, bearing a long sword may increase drag and thus compromise a male's ability to swim effectively. We tested escape performance in this species by eliciting C-start escape responses, an instinctive escape behavior, in males with various sword lengths. We then removed males' swords and retested escape performance. We found no relationship between escape performance and sword length and no effect of sword removal on escape performance. While having a large sword may attract a predator's attention, our results suggest that sword size does not compromise a male's escape performance."
https://openalex.org/W2143864702,"Prophylactic vaccination against HIV-1 sexual transmission will probably require antibody elicitation at genital mucosal surfaces. However, HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env)-based antigens are weakly immunogenic, particularly when applied mucosally. The polyanion PRO 2000 is safe for human vaginal application, and thus may represent a potential formulating agent for vaginal delivery of experimental vaccine immunogens. Based upon its biochemical properties, we hypothesized that PRO 2000 might enhance mucosal immunogenicity of HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env)-based antigens, promoting local and systemic immune responses. Vaginal immunization with Env-PRO 2000 resulted in significantly increased titres of Env-specific mucosal IgA and IgG in mice and rabbits, respectively, compared to Env alone, revealing modest but significant mucosal adjuvant activity for PRO 2000. In vitro, PRO 2000 associated with Env, protecting the glycoprotein from proteolytic degradation in human vaginal lavage. Unexpectedly, PRO 2000 antagonized TLR4 activation, suppressing local production of inflammatory cytokines. Since inflammation-mediated recruitment of viral target cells is a major risk factor in HIV-1 transmission, the immune modulatory and anti-inflammatory activities of PRO 2000 combined with its intravaginal safety profile suggests promise as an HIV-1 mucosal vaccine formulating agent."
https://openalex.org/W1980421663,"Schizophrenia is a mental disorder marked by an evolutionarily puzzling combination of high heritability, reduced reproductive success, and a remarkably stable prevalence. Recently, it has been proposed that sexual selection may be crucially involved in the evolution of schizophrenia. In the sexual selection model (SSM) of schizophrenia and schizotypy, schizophrenia represents the negative extreme of a sexually selected indicator of genetic fitness and condition. Schizotypal personality traits are hypothesized to increase the sensitivity of the fitness indicator, thus conferring mating advantages on high-fitness individuals but increasing the risk of schizophrenia in low-fitness individuals; the advantages of successful schzotypy would be mediated by enhanced courtship-related traits such as verbal creativity. Thus, schizotypy-increasing alleles would be maintained by sexual selection, and could be selectively neutral or even beneficial, at least in some populations. However, most empirical studies find that the reduction in fertility experienced by schizophrenic patients is not compensated for by increased fertility in their unaffected relatives. This finding has been interpreted as indicating strong negative selection on schizotypy-increasing alleles, and providing evidence against sexual selection on schizotypy.A simple mathematical model is presented, showing that reduced fertility in the families of schizophrenic patients can coexist with selective neutrality of schizotypy-increasing alleles, or even with positive selection on schizotypy in the general population. If the SSM is correct, studies of patients' families can be expected to underestimate the true fertility associated with schizotypy.This paper formally demonstrates that reduced fertility in the families of schizophrenic patients does not constitute evidence against sexual selection on schizotypy-increasing alleles. Futhermore, it suggests that the fertility estimates derived from extant studies may be biased to an unknown extent. These results have important implications for the evolutionary genetics of psychosis."
https://openalex.org/W2038205784,"Myosin phosphatase is a heterotrimeric holoenzyme consisting of myosin phosphatase-targeting subunit 1 (MYPT1), a catalytic subunit of PP1Cβ, and a 20-kDa subunit of an unknown function. We have previously reported that myosin phosphatase also controls mitosis, apparently by antagonizing polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1). Here we found that depletion of MYPT1 by siRNA led to precocious chromatid segregation when HeLa cells were arrested at metaphase by a proteasome inhibitor, MG132, or by Cdc20 depletion. Consistently, cyclin B1 and securin were not degraded, indicating that the chromatid segregation is independent of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome. Precocious segregation induced by MYPT1 depletion requires PLK1 activity because a PLK1 inhibitor, BI-2536, blocked precocious segregation. Furthermore, the expression of an unphosphorylatable mutant of SA2 (SCC3 homologue 2), a subunit of the cohesin complex, prevented precocious chromatid segregation induced by MYPT1 depletion. It has been shown that SA2 at centromeres is protected from phosphorylation by PP2A phosphatase recruited by Shugoshin (Sgo1), whereas SA2 along chromosome arms is phosphorylated by PLK1, leading to SA2 dissociation at chromosome arms. Taken together, our results suggest that hyperactivation of PLK1 caused by MYPT1 reduction could override the counteracting PP2A phosphatase, resulting in precocious chromatid segregation. We propose that SA2 at the centromeres is protected by two phosphatases. One is PP2A directly dephosphorylating SA2, and the other is myosin phosphatase counteracting PLK1.

Furthermore, the expression of an unphosphorylatable mutant of SA2 (SCC3 homologue 2), a subunit of the cohesin complex, prevented precocious chromatid segregation induced by MYPT1 depletion. It has been shown that SA2 at centromeres is protected from phosphorylation by PP2A phosphatase recruited by Shugoshin (Sgo1), whereas SA2 along chromosome arms is phosphorylated by PLK1, leading to SA2 dissociation at chromosome arms. Taken together, our results suggest that hyperactivation of PLK1 caused by MYPT1 reduction could override the counteracting PP2A phosphatase, resulting in precocious chromatid segregation. We propose that SA2 at the centromeres is protected by two phosphatases. One is PP2A directly dephosphorylating SA2, and the other is myosin phosphatase counteracting PLK1. It has become increasingly clear that Ser/Thr protein phosphatases play active roles in regulating protein phosphorylation during mitosis (1Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Lamond A.I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 623-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) belongs to the phosphoprotein phosphatase (PPP) family of Ser/Thr protein phosphatases, and its catalytic subunits (PP1C) are known to bind to a variety of targeting subunits (2Cohen P.T. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 241-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Ceulemans H. Bollen M. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). The association of PP1C with its targeting subunits is physiologically important for temporal and spatial regulation of protein phosphorylation because such binding provides the limited number of PP1C a means to counteract a wide array of Ser/Thr kinases by targeting PP1C either to a specific subcellular site or to a particular substrate at a specific stage of cell cycle and/or by allowing them to directly counteract a Ser/Thr kinase (2Cohen P.T. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 241-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Ceulemans H. Bollen M. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). For example, it has been demonstrated that Repo-Man, a novel PP1C-targeting protein, is essential for recruiting PP1Cγ, one of three mammalian PP1C isoforms, to chromatin during anaphase. This targeting plays a critical role in the maintenance of chromosome architecture (4Vagnarelli P. Hudson D.F. Ribeiro S.A. Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Spence J.M. Lai F. Farr C.J. Lamond A.I. Earnshaw W.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1133-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 5Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Andersen J. Lam Y.W. Moorhead G. Mann M. Lamond A.I. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 679-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). However, judging from the complexity of cell cycle control, multiple targeting subunits must be involved in various mitotic events. Thus, major questions remaining to be addressed are how and which mitotic event each targeting subunit controls and which kinase each targeting subunit counteracts. Myosin phosphatase-targeting subunit 1 (MYPT1, 2The abbreviations used are: MYPT1, myosin phosphatase-targeting subunit 1; PLK1, polo-like kinase 1; MP, myosin phosphatase; APC/C, anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome; ROCK, Rho-associated protein kinase. also called myosin binging subunit (MBS) or M130) is a known targeting subunit of PP1C (2Cohen P.T. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 241-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hartshorne D.J. Ito M. Erdödi F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37211-37214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that MYPT1 also controls mitosis, apparently by antagonizing polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) (7Yamashiro S. Yamakita Y. Totsukawa G. Goto H. Kaibuchi K. Ito M. Hartshorne D.J. Matsumura F. Dev. Cell. 2008; 14: 787-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). MYPT1 binds to PP1Cβ at its N terminus and to a 20-kDa subunit of unknown function at its C terminus to form a heterotrimeric holoenzyme. As the holoenzyme is known to dephosphorylate the regulatory light chains of myosin II and control actomyosin contractility in smooth muscle and nonmuscle cells, it is often called myosin phosphatase (MP) (2Cohen P.T. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 241-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hartshorne D.J. Ito M. Erdödi F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37211-37214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The phenotype of mice lacking MYPT1, however, indicates that MYPT1 plays a fundamental role in cell proliferation beyond the regulation of actomyosin contractility. Deletion of MYPT1 is embryonic lethal; the mice die at a very early stage of development (7.5 days postcoitus), and no MYPT1 null cells have been isolated so far (8Okamoto R. Ito M. Suzuki N. Kongo M. Moriki N. Saito H. Tsumura H. Imanaka-Yoshida K. Kimura K. Mizoguchi A. Hartshorne D.J. Nakano T. Transgenic Res. 2005; 14: 337-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In contrast, mice lacking myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), a major kinase that phosphorylates the regulatory myosin light chains, are able to survive until birth, although they show postnatal lethality (9Somlyo A.V. Wang H. Choudhury N. Khromov A.S. Majesky M. Owens G.K. Somlyo A.P. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2004; 25: 241-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Our previous finding that MYPT1 controls mitosis by counteracting PLK1 (7Yamashiro S. Yamakita Y. Totsukawa G. Goto H. Kaibuchi K. Ito M. Hartshorne D.J. Matsumura F. Dev. Cell. 2008; 14: 787-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) explains, at least in part, the lethal phenotype of MYPT1 KO mice. PLK1 is an essential mitotic kinase that controls a variety of critical mitotic events including the G2/M transition, centrosome maturation, bipolar mitotic spindle assembly, chromatid segregation, mitotic exit, and cytokinesis (10Blagden S.P.

We previously showed that depletion of MYPT1 resulted in increased phosphorylation of PLK1 at its activation site of Thr-210, and consistently, simultaneous reduction of both MYPT1 and PLK1 levels by siRNA rescued the mitotic arrest phenotype caused by single reduction of PLK1 levels. Due to this antagonism between MP and PLK1, loss of MYPT1 would be predicted to deleteriously activate PLK1 at incorrect times and/or places, disrupting one or more PLK1-mediated mitotic events. In this work, we examined the effects of MYPT1 depletion on mitotic exit, one of the PLK1-mediated mitotic events. We found that MYPT1 depletion resulted in premature chromatid segregation. SW962 human vulva carcinoma (HTB-118, ATCC, Manassas, VA) and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum. HeLa Tet-On cells that were able to induce Myc-tagged, wild type SA2 (called Myc-SA2-wild), as well as an unphosphorylatable mutant of SA2 (called Myc-SA2-12xA, mitosis-specific, 12 Ser and Thr sites replaced with Ala) were kindly provided by Dr. J.-M. Peters (Research Institute of Molecular Pathology, Vienna, Austria) (16Hauf S. Roitinger E. Koch B. Dittrich C.M. Mechtler K. Peters J.M. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e69Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Myc-tagged SA2 was induced by 2 μg/ml doxycycline for 2 days. In some experiments, HeLa cells were synchronized by a double thymidine block. Treatment of MG132 (5 μm) was performed for 1–5.5 h. We confirmed that HeLa cells were kept arrested at mitosis during this time window of MG132 treatment. As live cell imaging (supplemental Fig. 1A) shows, HeLa cells stably expressing histone H2B-GFP were arrested at the metaphase during a 6-h treatment of MG132, and the metaphase chromatid morphology appeared intact without any sign of mitotic exit or apoptosis (see supplemental Movie 1). Furthermore, Western blotting revealed that the levels of cyclin B1, as well as those of securin and phospho-(Ser-10) histone H3, remained unaltered during 6 h of MG132 treatment (supplemental Fig. 1B). The following antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal antibodies against MYPT1 (17Totsukawa G. Yamakita Y. Yamashiro S. Hartshorne D.J. Sasaki Y. Matsumura F. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 797-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar); a mouse polyclonal antibody against Ser-473-phopshorylated MYPT1 (7Yamashiro S. Yamakita Y. Totsukawa G. Goto H. Kaibuchi K. Ito M. Hartshorne D.J. Matsumura F. Dev. Cell. 2008; 14: 787-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar); a monoclonal antibody against Myc (9E10, Covance, Richmond, CA); human autoimmune serum against CREST (B. Brinkley, Baylor College of Medicine); a rabbit polyclonal antibody against Shugoshin (Sgo1) (Y. Watanabe, University of Tokyo); a rabbit polyclonal antibody against cyclin B1 (BioLegend, San Diego, CA); a mouse monoclonal antibody against cyclin B1 (GNS1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); a rabbit polyclonal antibody against phospho-(Ser-10) histone H3 (Cell Signaling Technology, Boston MA); a rabbit polyclonal antibody against Cdc20 (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery TX); and a rabbit polyclonal antibody against securin (Invitrogen). Immunofluorescence was performed as described (17Totsukawa G. Yamakita Y. Yamashiro S. Hartshorne D.J. Sasaki Y. Matsumura F. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 797-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in the PHEM buffer (54 mm Pipes, 22.5 mm Hepes, 10 mm EGTA, and 8 mm MgSO4, pH 7.0) for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PHEM for 5 min. After blocking with normal goat serum (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME), cells were labeled with primary antibodies. Chromosomes were detected by DAPI staining (Molecular Probes). Mitotic cells were obtained by the shake-off method, cytospun onto poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips, and analyzed by immunofluorescence as described above. Immunofluorescent images were taken as Z-stacks with a DeltaVision image restoration microscope system (Applied Precision LLC, Issaquah, WA) and deconvoluted with the SoftWoRx software (Applied Precision LLC) or the Huygen software (Scientific Volume Imaging, Hilversum, The Netherlands), and projected images were generated. Exposure times and settings for deconvolution were constant for all samples to be compared within any given experiment. Image contrast and brightness were adjusted by Photoshop (Adobe, San Jose, CA). Immunofluorescent images were also taken by a Nikon TE300 microscope with a ×60 plan Apo lens (NA 1.40). Live cell imaging was performed with HeLa cells or SW962 cells stably expressing histone H2B GFP as described previously (7Yamashiro S. Yamakita Y. Totsukawa G. Goto H. Kaibuchi K. Ito M. Hartshorne D.J. Matsumura F. Dev. Cell. 2008; 14: 787-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). HeLa cells stably expressing histone H2B-GFP were kindly provided by Dr. G. M. Wahl (Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, CA) (18Kanda T. Sullivan K.F. Wahl G.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 377-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar), and SW962 cells stably expressing histone H2B-GFP were isolated by transfection with a pBOS-H2BGFP vector (BD Biosciences). After transfection with siRNAs for 72 h, cells were imaged at 37 °C using a DeltaVision Microscope system with a Narishige temperature control system (MS-200D, Narishige International USA, East Meadow, NY). Five Z-section images were taken in 1-min intervals and deconvoluted, and projected images were generated with the SoftWoRx software (Applied Precision LLC). MYPT1 was depleted by siRNA treatment as described (7Yamashiro S. Yamakita Y. Totsukawa G. Goto H. Kaibuchi K. Ito M. Hartshorne D.J. Matsumura F. Dev. Cell. 2008; 14: 787-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and the effects of depletion were analyzed at either 48 or 72 h after transfection. Sgo1 depletion was performed according to Ref. 19McGuinness B.E. Hirota T. Kudo N.R. Peters J.M. Nasmyth K. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e86Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar. Cdc20 depletion was performed using an siRNA sequence described in Ref. 20Huang H.C. Shi J. Orth J.D. Mitchison T.J. Cancer Cell. 2009; 16: 347-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, which has been demonstrated to deplete Cdc20 levels less than 5% and to arrest HeLa cells at mitosis for an average of 18 h (20Huang H.C. Shi J. Orth J.D. Mitchison T.J. Cancer Cell. 2009; 16: 347-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Single-strand, sense RNA was used for a mock control. Lentiviral-based shRNA constructs (Mission shRNA, Sigma-Aldrich) were used to generate stable, MYPT1-depleted HeLa cells as described (21Zagórska A. Deak M. Campbell D.G. Banerjee S. Hirano M. Aizawa S. Prescott A.R. Alessi D.R. Sci. Signal. 2010; 3: ra25Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Of three shRNA constructs (TRCN0000231493; 0000002445; 0000002444) we tested, an shRNA construct (TRCN0000231493) was found to show strongest reduction of MYPT1. The MYPT1-depleted, stable HeLa cells exhibited oblique chromatid segregation (data not shown), the phenotype characteristic to MYPT1-depleted HeLa cells by siRNA transfection (7Yamashiro S. Yamakita Y. Totsukawa G. Goto H. Kaibuchi K. Ito M. Hartshorne D.J. Matsumura F. Dev. Cell. 2008; 14: 787-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), indicating that the shRNA-based depletion of MYPT1 replicated the phenotype observed with siRNA-based MYPT1 depletion. Control cells were isolated using a nontargeted shRNA construct. Chromosome spreading was performed as described (22Giménez-Abián J.F. Clarke D.J. Mullinger A.M. Downes C.S. Johnson R.T. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, mitotic cells were diluted four times with water for 7 min at room temperature. After centrifugation, swollen cells were fixed in Camoy's solution (75% methanol, 25% acetic acid). After washing three times with the same solution, cells were dropped onto coverslips, dried, and stained either with DAPI or with 5% Giemsa solution. Seventy to hundred chromatids were analyzed to determine chromatid segregation, and analyses were repeated three times. Immunofluorescence of chromosome spreads was performed as described (19McGuinness B.E. Hirota T. Kudo N.R. Peters J.M. Nasmyth K. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e86Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) with slight modification. Briefly, cells swollen as described above were cytospun on a coverslip, fixed with 4% formaldehyde containing 0.2% Triton X-100, and stained with the anti-Myc, anti-CREST antibodies together with DAPI. Statistical analyses were performed with two-tailed Student's t test. To determine the statistical significance of precocious segregation, fractions of mostly detached and completely scattered chromatids (see Fig. 1 for definition) were combined and analyzed by Student's t test. Means and standard deviations for the analyses of precocious chromatid segregation are listed in supplemental Table 1. Using Giemsa staining, we examined whether MYPT1 depletion affects chromatid segregation when cells are arrested overnight by nocodazole (0.25 μg/ml) or taxol (5 μm). We found that MYPT1 depletion resulted in premature chromatid segregation. To quantitatively determine the effects of MYPT1 depletion on chromatid segregation, we categorized chromatid morphology into the following five groups (Fig. 1A, panels a–e): (a) prophase chromatids; (b) metaphase chromatids; (c) partially detached chromatids (arrowheads, less than 50% detached at the centromere); (d) mostly detached chromatids (more than 50% sister detachment); and (e) completely scattered chromatids with no identifiable pairs of sister chromatids representing completely and prematurely segregated chromatids. Although categories “a” and “b” represent normal chromatids, categories “c” and “d” represent the process of premature chromatid segregation. Figs. 1, B and C, show quantitative analyses of chromatid segregation of SW962 and HeLa cells, respectively. In nocodazole-treated SW962 cells, MYPT1 depletion greatly increased the fraction of category “e” (completely scattered chromatids) from 12 (control) to 35% (MYPT1-depleted). The fraction of mostly detached chromatids (category d) also increased from 17 to 34%. On the other hand, the percentage of sister chromatids attached at the centromeres (category b) was reduced from 43 (control) to 18% (MYPT1-depleted). Similar results were obtained when SW962 cells were treated with taxol. HeLa cells also showed premature segregation of sister chromatids when MYPT1 was depleted. After overnight treatment of nocodazole or taxol, MYPT1 depletion increased the category of completely scattered chromatids (from 3 to 25% by nocodazole treatment and from 0 to 9% by taxol treatment). The category of mostly detached chromatids was also increased from 13 to 25% by nocodazole treatment and from 15 to 35% by taxol treatment. These results indicate that MYPT1 depletion results in precocious chromatid segregation when cells are arrested at mitosis. One possibility for precocious chromatid segregation is premature activation of APC/C. To test this possibility, we examined whether the inhibition of APC/C by a proteasome inhibitor, MG132, can block the precocious chromatid segregation of MYPT1-depleted HeLa cells. MYPT1-depleted cells were treated with MG132 for 1 and 3 h, and chromatid segregation was examined by Giemsa staining. Because MG132-arrested mitotic cells had few prophase cells, chromatid morphology was categorized into the following four groups including: (a) metaphase chromatids; (b) partially detached chromatids (less than 50% detached at the centromere); (c) mostly detached chromatids (more than 50% sister detachment); and (d) completely scattered chromatids. As Fig. 2A shows, control mock-transfected cells showed no obvious chromatid segregation at 1 h, whereas MYPT1-depleted cells exhibited slightly increased chromatid segregation. At 3 h of MG132 treatment, however, the effects of MYPT1 depletion became obvious. About 19% of MYPT1-depleted cells exhibited completely scattered chromatids, whereas only 6% of control cells showed such chromatid morphology. Western blots with MG132-treated cells confirmed that cyclin B1 was not degraded in both control and MYPT1-depleted cells (B), indicating that APC/C was effectively blocked by MG132. Precocious segregation in the presence of MG132 was confirmed by live cell imaging using HeLa cells stably expressing GFP-histone H2B (C). We found that about one-fifth of MYPT1-depleted cells (4 out of 20 cells) exhibited precocious chromatid segregation (Fig. 2C, lower panel; see supplemental Movie 1), whereas virtually all control cells were arrested at metaphase (upper panel; see supplemental Movie 2). Shugoshin (Sgo1) depletion has been demonstrated to cause precocious chromatid segregation (19McGuinness B.E. Hirota T. Kudo N.R. Peters J.M. Nasmyth K. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e86Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 23Salic A. Waters J.C. Mitchison T.J. Cell. 2004; 118: 567-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). It was thus possible that MYPT1 depletion might cause dissociation of Sgo1 from the centromeres, leading to precocious segregation. To test this possibility, Sgo1 localization was examined in MYPT1-depleted cells. We found that Sgo1 localization was not affected by MYPT1 depletion (see supplemental Fig. 2), indicating that precocious chromatid segregation by MYPT1 depletion is independent of Sgo1. In reciprocal experiments, we found that Sgo1 depletion did not affect MYPT1 localization. These results indicate that the localization of Sgo1 and MYPT1 is not interdependent. Because MG132 is a general inhibitor of proteasomes, we asked whether MYPT1-depleted cells show precocious segregation when APC/C is specifically inhibited by depletion of Cdc20, an activator of APC/C. To this end, MYPT1-depleted, stable HeLa cells generated with a lentiviral-based shRNA construct were transfected with siRNA to deplete Cdc20. Eight hours after transfection, control cells, as well as MYPT1-depleted, stable HeLa cells, were treated with thymidine (2 mm) for 24 h and released for synchronization. Cells entered mitosis at about 11 h after the release and stayed arrested at mitosis as reported (20Huang H.C. Shi J. Orth J.D. Mitchison T.J. Cancer Cell. 2009; 16: 347-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 24Wolthuis R. Clay-Farrace L. van Zon W. Yekezare M. Koop L. Ogink J. Medema R. Pines J. Mol.

Henley J.R. van Deursen J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 313-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We collected mitotic cells at 14 h after thymidine block (at which time cells were arrested at mitosis for 4 h) and analyzed by Giemsa staining, as well as by Western blotting, to determine chromatid morphology and states of mitosis, respectively. Western blots (Fig. 3A) revealed that Cdc20 depletion effectively blocked APC/C in both control cells (lanes 1 and 2) and MYPT1-depleted stable HeLa cells (lanes 3 and 4). The levels of cyclin B1 and securin (another substrate of APC/C) of Cdc20-depleted cells (lanes 2 and 4) were equivalent to those of MG132-arrested (for 2 h) mitotic cells (lanes 1 and 3). The levels of phospho-(Ser10)-histone H3 are also similar, indicating that Cdc20-depleted cells were arrested at mitosis in this time window. We first checked whether shRNA-based MYPT1 depletion replicated the precocious chromatid segregation phenotype observed with siRNA-based MYPT1 depletion. Giemsa staining (B) revealed that MYPT1-depleted, stable HeLa cells, when arrested at mitosis for 2 h by MG132, showed precocious chromatid segregation. The fraction of completely scattered chromatids in MYPT1-depleted, stable HeLa cells was increased from 1.4 to 5%. The fraction of mostly detached chromatids also increased from 1.4 to 19%. The extent of precocious segregation is equivalent to that observed with siRNA-based MYPT1 depletion (compare Fig. 3B with Fig. 2A). MYPT1 depletion also resulted in increased precocious segregation when cells were arrested at mitosis by Cdc20 depletion (C). Although Cdc20-depleted cells exhibited precocious chromatid segregation to a certain extent, double depletion of both Cdc20 and MYPT1 greatly increased the fraction of completely scattered chromatids from 27 to 52%. These findings, together with the precocious segregation of MYPT1-depleted cells in the presence of MG132, support the notion that precocious chromatid segregation by MYPT1 depletion is APC/C-independent. We do not know why Cdc20 depletion alone resulted in precocious segregation. Cdc20 has been reported to localize at kinetochores (25Malureanu L. Jeganathan K.B. Jin F. Baker D.J. van Ree J.H. Gullon O. Chen Z. Henley J.R. van Deursen J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 313-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 26Kallio M.J. Beardmore V.A. Weinstein J. Gorbsky G.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and affect kinetochore-microtubule attachments (25Malureanu L. Jeganathan K.B. Jin F. Baker D.J. van Ree J.H. Gullon O. Chen Z. Henley J.R. van Deursen J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 313-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It is thus possible that Cdc20 is involved in sister chromatid cohesion. Our previous results indicate that MYPT1 depletion increased PLK1 activity (7Yamashiro S. Yamakita Y. Totsukawa G. Goto H. Kaibuchi K. Ito M. Hartshorne D.J. Matsumura F. Dev. Cell. 2008; 14: 787-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). If the precocious chromatid segregation is caused by hyperactivated PLK1, then inhibition of PLK1 should block the precocious segregation. To test this idea, we examined whether MYPT1-depleted cells showed precocious segregation in the presence of a PLK1 inhibitor of BI-2536. After short time (1.5-h) treatment with MG132, metaphase cells were isolated by the shake-off method from control, as well as MYPT1-depleted cells (in this short time treatment, precocious chromatid segregation was minimum in both control and MYPT1-depleted cells, Fig. 2). The metaphase cells were then transferred into MG132-containing medium with or without BI-2536 for another 4 h, and their chromosome morphology was categorized into the same four groups as described in Fig. 2A, i.e. (a) metaphase chromatids; (b) partially detached chromatids (less than 50% detached at the centromere); (c) mostly detached chromatids (more than 50% sister detachment); and (d) completely scattered chromatids. It was noted that PLK1 inhibition altered chromosome appearance. As Fig. 4A shows, chromosomes in the presence of BI-2536 are more condensed and shorter than those in the absence of the inhibitor. Nonetheless, we were able to categorize the chromatid morphology of PLK1-inhibited cells into the above four groups (Fig. 4A, panels a–d). Quantitative analyses (Fig. 4B) revealed that PLK1 inhibition blocked precocious segregation caused by MYPT1 depletion. In the absence of BI-2536, MYPT1 depletion causes precocious chromatid segregation. Forty-one percent of MYPT1-depleted cells exhibited either completely scattered chromatids or mostly detached chromatids, whereas only 13% of control cells showed such detached chromatids (the extent of precocious segregation in this experimental setting was more severe than that observed in Fig. 2, which is probably due to the longer treatment with MG132 (5.5 versus 3 h)). PLK1 inhibition, however, greatly reduced the fractions of the precociously segregated chromatids of MYPT1-depleted cells. Although 20% of MYPT1-depleted cells showed completely scattered chromatids in the absence of BI-2536, PLK1 inhibition decreased this fraction to 8%. The fraction of mostly detached chromatids was also lessened from 21 to 9%. PLK1 inhibition in control cells also reduced the fraction of completely scattered chromatids from 8 to 5%. These findings indicate that PLK1 activity is required for the precocious dissociation of cohesin at the centromeres in MYPT1-depleted cells and are consistent with our previous result that MP antagonizes PLK1 (7Yamashiro S. Yamakita Y. Totsukawa G. Goto H. Kaibuchi K. Ito M. Hartshorne D.J. Matsumura F. Dev. Cell. 2008; 14: 787-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2084524029,"Many age-associated disorders (including diabetes, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases) are linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, which leads to impaired cellular bioenergetics and increased oxidative stress. However, it is not known what genetic and molecular pathways underlie differential vulnerability to mitochondrial dysfunction observed among different cell types.Starting with an insulinoma cell line as a model for a neuronal/endocrine cell type, we isolated a novel subclonal line (named CRI-G1-RS) that was more susceptible to cell death induced by mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitors than the parental CRI-G1 line (renamed CRI-G1-RR for clarity). Compared to parental RR cells, RS cells were also more vulnerable to direct oxidative stress, but equally vulnerable to mitochondrial uncoupling and less vulnerable to protein kinase inhibition-induced apoptosis. Thus, differential vulnerability to mitochondrial toxins between these two cell types likely reflects differences in their ability to handle metabolically generated reactive oxygen species rather than differences in ATP production/utilization or in downstream apoptotic machinery. Genome-wide gene expression analysis and follow-up biochemical studies revealed that, in this experimental system, increased vulnerability to mitochondrial and oxidative stress was associated with (1) inhibition of ARE/Nrf2/Keap1 antioxidant pathway; (2) decreased expression of antioxidant and phase I/II conjugation enzymes, most of which are Nrf2 transcriptional targets; (3) increased expression of molecular chaperones, many of which are also considered Nrf2 transcriptional targets; (4) increased expression of β cell-specific genes and transcription factors that specify/maintain β cell fate; and (5) reconstitution of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.The molecular profile presented here will enable identification of individual genes or gene clusters that shape vulnerability to mitochondrial dysfunction and thus represent potential therapeutic targets for diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, the newly identified CRI-G1-RS cell line represents a new experimental model for investigating how endogenous antioxidants affect glucose sensing and insulin release by pancreatic β cells."

The predominant nAChR subtype in the mammalian brain with a high affinity for nicotine is composed of α4 and β2 subunits. This nAChR subtype is responsible for addiction to nicotine and is thought to be implicated in Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases and therefore presents an important target for drug design. In an effort to obtain water-soluble, ligand-binding domains of the human α4β2 nAChR for structural studies, we expressed the extracellular domains (ECDs) of these subunits in the eukaryotic expression system Pichia pastoris. The wild-type ECDs and their mutants containing the more hydrophilic Cys-loop from the snail acetylcholine-binding protein (individually expressed or coexpressed) did not demonstrate any specific interaction with ligands. We then linked the mutated ECDs with the 24-amino acid peptide (AGS)8 and observed that the β2-24-α4 ECD concatamer, but not the α4-24-β2 one, exhibited very satisfactory water solubility and ligand binding properties. The 125I-epibatidine and [3H]nicotine bound to β2-24-α4 with dissociation constants (Kd) of 0.38 and 19 nm, respectively, close to the published values for the intact α4β2 AChR.

Interestingly, deglycosylation of the concatamer did not affect its ligand binding properties.

Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) 3The abbreviations used are: nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; ECD, extracellular domain; LsAChBP, L. stagnalis acetylcholine-binding protein; mECD, mutated ECD; DLS, dynamic light scattering; PNGase, peptide:N-glycosidase; Endo Hf, endoglycosidase Hf; PB, phosphate buffer. are pentameric cation channels that open in response to the binding of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (1Corringer P.J. Le Novère N. Changeux J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 431-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Together with the GABAA, GABAC, glycine, and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT3) receptors, nAChRs belong to the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily. They are formed by five homologous transmembrane subunits, chosen from a pool of 17 homologous subunits (α1–10, β1–4, γ, δ, and ϵ). Each subunit consists of the N-terminal extracellular domain (ECD) (210–220 amino acids) containing the characteristic Cys-loop (2Dennis M. Giraudat J. Kotzyba-Hibert F. Goeldner M. Hirth C.

Greengard P. Neuron. 1990; 5: 555-567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Based on their different locations, the nAChRs are divided into muscle and neuronal receptors (5Karlin A. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 102-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). Muscle nAChR consists of α1, β1, δ, and γ or ϵ subunit. In contrast, neuronal nAChRs consist of five similar α subunits (α7, α8, α9, or α10) or a combination of α and β subunits (e.g. α4β2 and α6α3β2) (6Kullmann D.M. Brain. 2002; 125: 1177-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Both the α and β subunits contribute to the pharmacological properties of the binding sites, which have principal and complementary components and lie at the interface between an α (α2, α3, α4, or α6) and a β (β2 or β4) subunit in the case of heteromeric receptors or between two identical subunits in the case of homomeric receptors. It is thought that homomeric receptors made up of α7, α8, or α9 subunits have five identical acetylcholine-binding sites per receptor molecule (one on each subunit interface), whereas heteromeric receptors including the muscle type receptor have two binding sites per molecule (reviewed in Ref. 7Gotti C. Zoli M. Clementi F. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2006; 27: 482-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). The α4β2 nAChR displays the highest affinity for nicotine and constitutes the most abundant type of neuronal nAChR in brain tissues. A stoichiometry of (α4)2(β2)3 has been proposed, generating two agonist-binding sites, whereas manipulation of the stoichiometry of α4β2 nAChRs expressed in Xenopus oocytes indicates that (α4)3(β2)2 nAChRs can be also viable, displaying higher Ca2+ permeability and a lower affinity for nicotinic agonists (8Moroni M. Zwart R. Sher E. Cassels B.K. Bermudez I. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 755-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). α4β2 nAChRs are implicated in many pathological conditions, including Alzheimer disease (9Paterson D. Nordberg A. Prog.

As expected, this AChR subtype presents an invaluable target for the development of new drugs acting mainly as nicotinic agonists (14Arneric S.P. Holladay M. Williams M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2007; 74: 1092-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Despite the considerable progress toward the synthesis of relatively specific α4β2 ligands, improved treatments for the above diseases require the development of new nAChR agonists or antagonists that more specifically target α4β2 nAChRs. So far, based on the high resolution crystal structures of the acetylcholine-binding protein, a homolog of the extracellular domain of the nAChR found initially in the snail Lymnaea stagnalis (LsAChBP) (15Brejc K. van Dijk W.J.

In previous studies, to investigate the pharmacological properties of the human α4β2-nAChR, intact or truncated subunits have been mainly expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Person et al. (23Person A.M. Bills K.L. Liu H. Botting S.K. Lindstrom J. Wells G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39990-40002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) used this system to express the extracellular domains of the α4 and β2 subunits with or without the M1 transmembrane domain. They observed that individually expressed or coexpressed water-soluble α4 and β2 ECDs did not bind ligands and that epibatidine binding was only observed when transmembrane domain M1 was present on at least one of the two coexpressed ECDs. However, such hydrophobic molecules may present the usual difficulties that are encountered in structural studies of membrane proteins. Ideally, large quantities of water-soluble ligand-binding domains of α4β2 AChRs (as well as of other neuronal AChR subtypes), suitable for crystallization, are needed for high resolution structural studies and subsequent rational drug design. Covalent linkage of specific AChR subunits by flexible linkers has resulted in functional receptors, as described in several studies on α4β2 (24Carbone A.L. Moroni M. Groot-Kormelink P.J. Bermudez I. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2009; 156: 970-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 25Zhou Y. Nelson M.E. Kuryatov A. Choi C. Cooper J. Lindstrom J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 9004-9015Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and other AChR subtypes, such as α3β4 (26Groot-Kormelink P.J. Broadbent S. Beato M. Sivilotti L.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 558-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and α6β2β3 (27Kuryatov A. Lindstrom J.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2011; 79: 126-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). More specifically, in the case of α4β2, Zhou et al. (25Zhou Y. Nelson M.E. Kuryatov A. Choi C. Cooper J. Lindstrom J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 9004-9015Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) expressed intact α4 and β2 subunits as concatamers, in which the two subunits were linked by an 18–36-amino acid linker peptide either as α4-linker-β2 or β2-linker-α4. The recombinant receptors had a high ligand binding affinity, and the authors inferred that the (α4)2(β2)3 AChR had a higher affinity for epibatidine and a lower Ca2+ influx than the (α4)3(β2)2 AChR. Based on this observation, Carbone et al. (24Carbone A.L. Moroni M. Groot-Kormelink P.J. Bermudez I. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2009; 156: 970-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) expressed α4β2 AChR receptors in both stoichiometries as pentameric constructs connected by a flexible linker and proved the hypothesis of Zhou et al. However, the precise native stoichiometry of the molecule is still unclear. The aim of all of these studies was to elucidate the functional and pharmacological properties of the α4β2 receptor, but, although invaluable for the determination of α4β2 AChR-specific characteristics, they did not lead to the production of large quantities of water-soluble ligand-binding domains of α4β2 AChRs suitable for crystallization and subsequent high resolution structural studies. In fact, to our knowledge, no other ECD of any AChR with a high affinity for small ligands has been constructed, with the exception of the protein ligand α-bungarotoxin, the binding of which does not involve a subunit interface and thus binds with high affinity to α1 and α7 ECDs (28Avramopoulou V. Mamalaki A. Tzartos S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38287-38293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 29Psaridi-Linardaki L. Mamalaki A. Remoundos M. Tzartos S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26980-26986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In this study, we present our efforts aimed at producing soluble α4β2 nAChR domains with a high ligand binding affinity, appropriate for high resolution structural analysis and possibly pharmacological studies. The ECDs of the two subunits were heterologously expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris in a soluble glycosylated form. Although individual or coexpressed α4- and β2-ECDs did not bind ligands, we managed to produce a recombinant protein consisting of the linked α4- and β2-ECDs with near native pharmacological properties and excellent water solubility. Because deglycosylation did not alter either the pharmacological properties or the solubility of the protein and because nonglycosylated proteins are more amenable to crystallization than glycosylated ones, we suggest that the deglycosylated form of this protein will be suitable material for crystallization trials. All of the amino acids are numbered according to their position in the mature protein sequence. cDNAs coding for the N-terminal ECDs of the human nicotinic α4 (ACHA4_HUMAN, P43681) and β2 (ACHB2_HUMAN, P17787) AChR subunits (amino acid residues 1–210 and 1–211, respectively) were enzymatically amplified by PCR from full-length α4 and β2 cDNAs, respectively, kindly provided by Dr. J. Lindstrom (Department of Neuroscience, University of Pennsylvania Medical School, Philadelphia, PA), using the primer combination α4-EcoRI-for/α4-XbaI-rev and β2-EcoRI-for/β2-XbaI-rev. The primers were designed to contain EcoRI (forward) and XbaI (reverse) restriction sites so that the purified PCR products after digestion were subcloned into the EcoRI/XbaI sites of the expression vector pPICZaA (Invitrogen). The sequences of all the oligonucleotides used in this paper are given in supplemental Table S1. The Cys-loop mutant ECDs, in which the base sequence of the native Cys-loop was segmentally replaced by the corresponding sequence of the LsAChBP (ACHP_LYMST, P58154), were generated by two-step PCR using the previously constructed cDNAs as templates. In the case of the α4-mECD, two different fragments were generated: (a) first using the primers α4-EcoRI-for and α4-rev1 and pPICZaA-α4-ECD cDNA as template, then the primers α4-EcoRI-for and rev2-HincII and the product of the first PCR as template, yielding cDNA1 and (b) first using the primers α4-for1 and α4-XbaI-rev and pPICZaA-α4-ECD cDNA as template, then the primers for2-HincII and α4-XbaI-rev and the product of the first PCR as template, yielding cDNA2. A new HincII restriction site was thus generated in each of the final cDNAs. cDNAs 1 and 2 were then digested, respectively, with EcoRI/HincII or XbaI/HincII, and the product was ligated into EcoRI/XbaI sites in the expression vector pPICZaA (Invitrogen) or a modified pPICZaA with a base sequence encoding a FLAG tag instead of a His6 tag. β2-mECD containing the same restriction sites was constructed in the same way using the primers β2-EcoRI-for, β2-rev1, rev2-HincII, β2-for1, β2-XbaI-rev, and for2-HincII. First, the expression plasmid pPICZaA was modified for the construction of the concatamers by inserting the (AGS)8- or (AGS)11-coding DNA sequence (hybridized oligonucleotides: linker-KpnI-for/linker-SacII-rev and linker33-KpnI-for/linker33-SacII-rev) at the KpnI and SacII sites. The cDNAs for the α4- and β2-mECDs were then modified by PCR to generate EcoRI/KpnI or SacII/XbaI restriction sites, leading to the generation of four different cDNAs: α4-m-EcoRI/KpnI, β2-m-SacII/XbaI, β2-m-EcoRI/KpnI, and α4-m-SacII/XbaI. Using appropriate restriction endonucleases, the purified PCR products were subcloned sequentially into the EcoRI/KpnI and SacII/XbaI sites of the modified expression vector pPICZaA-(AGS)8 and pPICZaA-(AGS)11 as described above. The primers used were: α4-EcoRI-for/α4-KpnI-rev, α4-SacII-for/α4-XbaI-rev, β2-EcoRI-for/β2-KpnI-rev, and β2-SacII-for/β2-XbaI-rev. The sequences for all constructs were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing (Lark Technologies Inc.). Linearized plasmids were transformed by electroporation into the X33 strain of P. pastoris, and positive clones were selected for small scale cultivation according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen) and in detail described elsewhere (28Avramopoulou V.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1794: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The culture supernatants were tested for expression of the recombinant ECDs by dot-blot analysis using anti-Myc 9E.10 mAb (ATCC) or anti-His6 C terminus antibodies (Invitrogen) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Dako) or using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-FLAG M2 mAb (Sigma), depending on the tag carried by the recombinant protein. The clones with the highest protein yield were used for large scale protein expression. The supernatants of cultures containing the secreted ECDs (wild-type or mutant ECDs) were concentrated using a Minitan Ultrafiltration System (Millipore) with a 10-kDa cut-off filter and dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES, 300 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, pH 8.0, and then the proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) or on an anti-FLAG M2 gel (Sigma-Aldrich) depending on the tag used. For size exclusion chromatography, the purified proteins were concentrated to 500 μl by centrifugation (3,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) in Amicon tubes (Millipore), and applied to an AKTA 90 FPLC purifier system (Amersham Biosciences), using a 24-ml Superose 12 column (Amersham Biosciences). The mobile phase was 20 mm HEPES, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions of 0.5 ml were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE followed either by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining or Western blot analysis using the anti-Myc mAb. The protein concentrations were measured using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Various amounts of purified recombinant proteins were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 25,000 dpm of 125I-epibatidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; specific activity, 2200 Ci/mmol), 20,000 dpm of [3H]epibatidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; specific activity, 56.3 Ci/mmol), or 96,150 dpm of [3H]nicotine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; specific activity, 66.9 Ci/mmol) in a final volume of 50 μl of PB-BSA buffer (10 mm phosphate buffer, 0.2% BSA, pH 7.5). The samples were then diluted in 1 ml of 20 mm Tris, 0.05% Triton X-100, pH 7.5, and immediately filtered through an anion exchanger Whatman DE81 filter and presoaked with the same buffer, and the filter was washed four times with 1 ml of the same buffer. The charged DE81 filters bind the free or ligand-bound ECDs, but not free ligands, such as 125I-epibatidine. In the case of [3H]epibatidine or [3H]nicotine, GF/B glass fiber filters (Whatman) were used and were presoaked for 6 h at 4 °C with 1.5% polyethyleneimine, pH 9.0. The cationic polyethyleneimine binds strongly to the glass filters, allowing them to bind acidic proteins and polyanions (31Bruns R.F. Lawson-Wendling K. Pugsley T.A. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar) and consequently free and ligand-bound ECDs, but not the free 3H-ligands. Bound radioactivity was measured on a γ- or β-counter. Νonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 1000-fold higher concentration of unlabeled epibatidine or nicotine and the recombinant protein. In all of the experiments, nonspecific binding never exceeded 0.4% of the total used radioactivity. To calculate the dissociation constant (Kd) for 125I-epibatidine or [3H]nicotine, saturation curve analysis was carried out, according to the model Y = Bmax*X/(Kd + X), where X is the radioligand concentration, and Y is the concentration of specifically bound radioligand. Several concentrations of 125I-epibatidine or [3H]nicotine were incubated, respectively, for 2 h at 4 °C with 0.4 or 40 μg, of ECDs in a final volume of 50 μl of PB-BSA. Bound radioligands were measured as described above. Different amounts of unlabeled ligands were added simultaneously with 125I-epibatidine (25,000 dpm) to 0.4 μg of purified recombinant protein in a final volume of 50 μl of PB-BSA and the mixture incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The specifically bound radioactivity was then measured by the Whatman DE81 filter assay described above. The inhibition constant (Ki) for each ligand was calculated using the Cheng-Prusoff equation: Ki = IC50/(1+[125I-epibatidine]/Kd) (32Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12298) Google Scholar), where IC50 is the concentration of the ligand that causes 50% inhibition of 125I-epibatidine binding, determined from the inhibition curve through nonlinear regression according to the model Y = Bottom + (Top-Bottom)/[1 + 10̂(X − LogIC50)]. (“Top” is defined as the total binding of labeled ligand in the absence of competitor. “Bottom” is defined as the nonspecific binding of labeled ligand in the presence of a saturating concentration of the competitor.) [125I-epibatidine] is the concentration of 125I-epibatidine used in the competition experiment, and Kd is the dissociation constant for 125I-epibatidine, estimated as above. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis of purified recombinant proteins was carried out using a Zetasizer NanoS Instrument (Malvern Instruments) with a helium-neon laser supplying 633-nm light and an output power of 4.0 milliwatt. The samples were placed in a quartz cuvette, and measurements were made at 25 °C for an automatically determined time. The results were analyzed using DTS v.4.1 software. The estimated size for each protein molecule is given as the mean hydrodynamic diameter (d·nm) of the particles calculated from the intensity of the scattered light, whereas the polydispersity (%) is calculated from the width (nm) of the peak of interest. Approximately 1 mg of purified β2-24-α4-mECD was subjected to deglycosylation under native conditions by the addition of 20,000 units of peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F; New England Biolabs) in 20 mm HEPES, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8 (final volume, 500 μl) and incubation at 4 °C for 24 h or by the addition of 12,500 units of Endo Hf (New England Biolabs) in 20 mm HEPES, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7, and incubation as above. All of the experiments with deglycosylated β2-24-α4-mECD were performed after removing the endoglycosidases by either gel filtration (PNGase F) or nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid metal affinity chromatography (Endo Hf). The singly expressed α4- and β2-ECDs were obtained mainly in the form of microaggregates and multimers with respective apparent molecular masses of 1130 and 480 kDa (data not shown) with a low yield (0.1 and 0.3 mg/liter, respectively).

More specifically, the α4-mECD was mainly eluted in the form of microaggregates and multimers, with respective masses of ∼1100 and 480 kDa (Fig. 1A), whereas the β2-mECD displayed a somewhat better elution profile, because the major fraction eluted as a peak with a mass of about 470 kDa (Fig. 1B). We then attempted to coexpress the two mutated ECDs in an effort to obtain ligand-binding pentameric ECD complexes as shown by others using coexpression of intact α4 and β2 subunits (23Person A.M.

On size exclusion chromatography, the elution pattern showed mainly microaggregated proteins and multimers (Fig. 1C). We used two different affinity purification methods for the coexpressed product under native conditions to investigate the formation of complexes between α4- and β2-mECDs. Western blotting of the eluate from an nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin using anti-FLAG mAb or of the eluate from an anti-FLAG resin using anti-His6 mAb (not shown) demonstrated that the coelution of the α4- and β2-mECDs on gel filtration chromatography was probably due to complex formation between these two molecules. However, we did not observe any binding of 125I-epibatidine to the coexpressed products (Fig. 2, third bar), suggesting that the complexes between the α4- and β2-mECDs were not correctly formed. Because of the insoluble character of the individually expressed wild-type ECDs, probably because of their hydrophobic Cys-loop, we did not attempt to coexpress these forms, considering it unlikely to result in a soluble assembled molecule. The next step was to undertake the expression of these two ECDs linked by a flexible polypeptidic linker (AGS)8 to facilitate the proper formation of a functional binding site. This linker has been successfully used previously for linking the intact α4β2 (25Zhou Y. Nelson M.E. Kuryatov A. Choi C. Cooper J. Lindstrom J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 9004-9015Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, linking intact AChR subunits has resulted in the generation of functional molecules, as described in several previous studies (24Carbone A.L. Moroni M. Groot-Kormelink P.J. Bermudez I. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2009; 156: 970-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 26Groot-Kormelink P.J. Broadbent S. Beato M. Sivilotti L.G. Mol.

As shown in Fig. 3A, the concatamer α4-24-β2-mECD eluted essentially in microaggregated form and was expressed with a low yield (0.1 mg/liter). However, the reverse concatamer β2-24-α4-mECD eluted in an apparently dimeric form (∼130 kDa), and the amount of the aggregated fraction was dramatically decreased (Fig. 3B) when compared with the single or coexpressed mutated ECDs. Furthermore, the expression yield of the β2-24-α4-mECD was 0.5 mg/liter. Additionally, as shown in Table 1, DLS measurements showed a polydispersity of 37.2%, still high, but nevertheless lower than the values of 42.3% for the coexpressed mECDs or 38.3% for the α4-24-β2-mECD concatamer.TABLE 1DLS analysis of the different mECDsmECDsSizePolydispersityd·nm%Coexpressed α4/β221.40 ± 0.1842.3 ± 0.35α4-24-β217.20 ± 0.1538.3 ± 0.29β2-24-α412.50 ± 0.1237.2 ± 0.36β2-24-α4, PNGase F-treated10.50 ± 0.1139.3 ± 0.50β2-24-α4, Endo Hf-treated9.40 ± 0.0834.2 ± 0.31 Open table in a new tab Fig. 2 shows that although the coexpressed α4- and β2-mECDs did not bind 125I- or [3H]epibatidine, the β2-24-α4-mECD concatamer, but not the α4-24-β2-mECD concatamer, bound this ligand very efficiently. Similarly, the β2-24-α4-mECD construct, but not the α4-24-β2-mECD construct, bound [3H]nicotine with a considerable affinity. The saturation curve obtained by nonlinear regression analysis (Fig. 4A) revealed a Kd of 0.38 nm for the binding of 125I-epibatidine to the β2-24-α4-mECD (Table 2). Fig. 4D and Table 2 show that [3H]nicotine also bound with a high affinity to the β2-24-α4-mECD (19 nm).
