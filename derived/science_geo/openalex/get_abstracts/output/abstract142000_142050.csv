https://openalex.org/W2119715237,"Electromechanical actuators based on sheets of single-walled carbon nanotubes were shown to generate higher stresses than natural muscle and higher strains than high-modulus ferroelectrics. Like natural muscles, the macroscopic actuators are assemblies of billions of individual nanoscale actuators. The actuation mechanism (quantum chemical–based expansion due to electrochemical double-layer charging) does not require ion intercalation, which limits the life and rate of faradaic conducting polymer actuators. Unlike conventional ferroelectric actuators, low operating voltages of a few volts generate large actuator strains. Predictions based on measurements suggest that actuators using optimized nanotube sheets may eventually provide substantially higher work densities per cycle than any previously known technology."

In transient transfection assays, BRCA1 was found to inhibit signaling by the ligand-activated estrogen receptor (ER-α) through the estrogen-responsive enhancer element and to block the transcriptional activation function AF-2 of ER-α. These results raise the possibility that wild-type BRCA1 suppresses estrogen-dependent transcriptional pathways related to mammary epithelial cell proliferation and that loss of this ability contributes to tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1966723276,"Ran, a small guanosine triphosphatase, is suggested to have additional functions beyond its well-characterized role in nuclear trafficking. Guanosine triphosphate–bound Ran, but not guanosine diphosphate–bound Ran, stimulated polymerization of astral microtubules from centrosomes assembled on Xenopus sperm. Moreover, a Ran allele with a mutation in the effector domain (RanL43E) induced the formation of microtubule asters and spindle assembly, in the absence of sperm nuclei, in a γTuRC (γ-tubulin ring complex)– and XMAP215 ( Xenopus microtubule associated protein)–dependent manner. Therefore, Ran could be a key signaling molecule regulating microtubule polymerization during mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W1966023886,"In an effort to identify tumor-specific antigens recognized by CD4(+) T cells, an approach was developed that allows the screening of an invariant chain-complementary DNA fusion library in a genetically engineered cell line expressing the essential components of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II processing and presentation pathway. This led to the identification of a mutated form of human CDC27, which gave rise to an HLA-DR4-restricted melanoma antigen. A mutated form of triosephosphate isomerase, isolated by a biochemical method, was also identified as an HLA-DR1-restricted antigen. Thus, this approach may be generally applicable to the identification of antigens recognized by CD4(+) T cells, which could aid the development of strategies for the treatment of patients with cancer, autoimmune diseases, or infectious diseases."

Consistently, in the RCC1-depleted egg extracts, Ran guanosine triphosphate (RanGTP), but not Ran guanosine diphosphate (RanGDP), induced self-organization of microtubule asters, and the process required the activity of dynein.

The repair of the resulting apurinic/apyrimidinic site involves the replacement of either a single nucleotide (short patch BER) or of several nucleotides (long patch BER).

A number of DNA glycosylases recognize the damaged bases and remove them through N-glycosidic bond hydrolysis. There are two types of DNA-glycosylases: the monofunctional exhibiting only the glycosylase activity and the bifunctional, which are glycosylase/β-lyases. In human cells, an example of the first category is the 3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylase, the ANPG protein. It catalyzes the excision of a broad variety of modified bases including N-methylpurines generated by alkylating agents (reviewed in Ref. 1Laval J. Jurado J. Saparbaev M. Sidorkina O. Mutat.

AP sites are processed via two alternative pathways: the short patch (1-nucleotide gap filling) (14Kubota Y. Nash R. Klungland A. Schar P. Barnes D. Lindahl T.

These two pathways involve some common proteins but also some specific ones. For example in the short patch pathway, DNA polymerase (Pol) β is involved in the resynthesis step (20Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kuhn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar), whereas PCNA and Pol δ/ε are implicated in the long patch pathway (21Stucki M. Pascucci B. Parlanti E. Fortini P. Wilson S.H. Hubscher U. Dogliotti E. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 835-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). It therefore becomes important to investigate whether the initial recognition step of the modified base by a specific DNA glycosylase targets the following repair steps to a specific BER branch. In this study, specific lesions for the two types of DNA-glycosylases, namely HX and εA for the monofunctional ANPG protein and 8-oxoG for the bifunctional OGG1 protein were selected, and their respective DNA repair pathways were analyzed. Circular duplex plasmids containing a single lesion at a known position of their genome were used as DNA substrates to distinguish the two BER branches by fine mapping of the repair synthesis patches. We report that HX and εA are repaired via the short as well as the long patch BER, wheras the 8-oxoG residues are preferentially repaired via the short patch pathway. Because Pol β is involved in the short patch repair, we show, as expected, that Pol β-null mouse cell extracts exhibited a significantly slower repair of 8-oxoG residues as compared with their wild-type couterpart. Chemicals were purchased from Sigma, and molecular biological reagents were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals or New England Biolabs. [α-32P]dATP, [α-32P]dCTP, [α-32P]dTTP, and [α-32P]dGTP (3000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. T4 DNA polymerase holoenzyme, single-stranded DNA binding protein and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. For the oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing a single uracil, HX, εA, or 8-oxoG residue, 5′-GATCCTCTAGAGUCGACCTGCA-3′ and 5′-GATCCTCTAGAGTCG(HX)CCTGCAGGCATGCA-3′ were synthesized by M-Medical (Florence, Italy), and 5′-GATCCTCTAGAGTCG(εA)CCTGCAGGCATGCA-3′ was synthesized by Genset (Paris, France) and 5′-GATCCTCTAGAGTC(8oxoG) ACCTGCAGGCATGCA-3′ was synthesized by Eurogentec (Angers, France).

Under these experimental conditions, the flow-through fraction (CFI) contained PCNA, and the bound fraction (CFII) contained all proteins essential for short patch BER. We have verified that the addition of PCNA to CFII is required to observe the long patch BER. 2B. Pascucci and E. Dogliotti, unpublished data. Closed circular DNA containing a single lesion was produced as described previously (18Frosina G. Fortini P. Rossi O. Carrozzino F. Raspaglio G. Cox L.S. Lane D.P. Abbondandolo A. Dogliotti E. J.

It was further incubated with T4 DNA polymerase holoenzyme, single-stranded DNA binding protein, dNTPs, and T4 DNA ligase. Closed circular DNA duplex molecules were purified by cesium chloride equilibrium centrifugation. The plasmid DNA containing a single uracil residue was digested with UDG to produce a single abasic site. The oligonucleotide 5′-GATCCTCTAGAGTCGACCTGCA-3′ was used to prepare the control plasmid. Repair reactions were carried out essentially as described in Ref. 18Frosina G. Fortini P. Rossi O. Carrozzino F. Raspaglio G. Cox L.S. Lane D.P. Abbondandolo A. Dogliotti E. J. Biol.

Briefly, reaction mixtures (50 μl) contained 40 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 7.9), 75 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 20 μm of each dNTP, 2 μCi of [α-32P]dATP, [α-32P]dCTP, [α-32P]dTTP, or [α-32P]dGTP as indicated, 2 mm ATP, 40 mm phosphocreatine, 2.5 μg of creatine phosphokinase (type I, Sigma), 3.4% glycerol, 18 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 20 μg of human cell extracts. After increasing periods of time at 30 °C, the plasmid DNA was recovered and digested with restriction enzymes as indicated. The digestion products were electrophoresed on a denaturing 15% polyacrylamide gel. The repair products were visualized by autoradiography and quantified by electronic autoradiography (Istant Imager, Packard). Single-stranded (+) pGEM-3Zf DNA was primed with 5′-end32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing the specific modified base, and DNA was synthesized in vitro using this primed template. As shown in Fig. 1, in all cases closed circular molecules (Form I) were obtained with an efficiency close to 100% (lanes 1, 5,8, and 11). When the duplex DNA molecules containing the lesion were digested with the specific monofunctional DNA-glycosylase, namely the UDG protein in the case of the uracil residue (lane 2) and ANPG protein in the case of HX (lane 6) and εA (lane 9) lesions, followed by Nth protein (that incises DNA at AP sites by a β-elimination mechanism), a complete conversion of Form I to Form II molecules was observed (lanes 4, 7, and 10). In the case of the plasmid containing the 8-oxoG residue (lanes 11and 12), the incubation with the Fpg protein was sufficientper se to convert supercoiled plasmids to nicked circular forms because this enzyme is also endowed with an AP-lyase activity that incises at AP sites by a β-δ elimination mechanism (25O'Connor T.R. Laval J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5222-5226Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 26Bailly V. Verly W. O'Connor T. Laval J. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The recombinant plasmid molecules were partially or fully resistant to cleavage by restriction enzymes (SalI, AccI, andHincII) whose recognition sequence include the modified base confirming that a single lesion was precisely inserted at the expected position of the plasmid genome (data not shown). These data show that these duplex DNA molecules are homogeneous closed circular molecules all containing a single modified base. To distinguish between the short and long patch BER pathways, the experimental approach involves the use of different labeled dNTPs in the reaction mixture. The incorporation of the specific radiolabeled dNTP at the nucleotide position where the lesion was originally located within the XbaIHindIII restriction fragment (24 nucleotides) marks mainly the occurrence of one-gap filling reactions, whereas the incorporation of dCMP identifies long repair patches (Fig. 2, see scheme atbottom) (27Fortini P. Pascucci B. Parlanti E. Sobol R.W. Wilson S.H. Dogliotti E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3575-3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Moreover, because PCNA is required for the long patch but not for the short patch BER (18Frosina G. Fortini P. Rossi O. Carrozzino F. Raspaglio G. Cox L.S. Lane D.P. Abbondandolo A. Dogliotti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9573-9578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), the dependence of the repair reaction on this auxiliary protein is an additional marker to distinguish between the two pathways. The deamination of adenine residues in DNA generates HX, whereas lipid peroxidation generates exocyclic adducts and among them εA. Both HX and εA are repaired, in human cells, by the same gene product, the ANPG protein. As shown in Fig. 2, HeLa cell extracts were proficient in the repair of these modified bases via both pathways: replacement of one nucleotide (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 1–3) and resynthesis of longer patches (Fig. 2, A andB, lanes 4–6). Besides the radiolabeled 24-mer, which is a marker of fully repaired DNA, the other radioactively labeled DNA present on the gel autoradiography is a 5′ end-labeled 60-mer internal standard added in all reaction mixtures. This internal standard is used to correct the repair incorporation values (as measured by electronic autoradiography; Fig. 2, right panels) for DNA recovery. A comparison of the nature and the relative contribution of the two BER pathways when using plasmids containing either HX or εA with the repair of preformed AP site showed that all three lesions were repaired by the same pathways with a comparable efficiency (data not shown), suggesting that the AP site processing could be the rate-limiting step in the repair initiated by the ANPG protein. In mammalian cells 8-oxoG is excised from oxidatively damaged DNA by the enzyme OGG1, which excises 8-oxoG residue when paired with cytosine and then nicks DNA next to the AP site (28Bjoras M. Luna L. Johnsen B. Hoff E. Haug T. Rognes T. Seeberg E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6314-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows that crude HeLa cell extracts were able to repair this oxidized guanine in vitrobut mainly via the short patch BER (lanes 1–3). DNA repair patches longer than 1–2 nucleotides were undetectable on the gel autoradiography after up to 2 h of repair time (lanes 4–6). The absence of significant incorporation of dCMP into the repair fragment indicates that 8-oxoG is a poor substrate for long patch BER, at least extending beyond two nucleotides. Moreover, it also strongly suggests that nucleotide excision repair (NER) is barely or not involved in the repair of this lesion under our experimental conditions. This fact is confirmed by the lack of repair synthesis in the XbaI-HincII digestion fragment (lane 14), which includes 7 nucleotides 5′-flanking the lesion. The comparison of the extent of repair of the 8-oxoG lesion (lanes 1–6) with that of an AP site constructed in the same circular plasmid (lanes 7–12) showed that the repair activity toward an AP site was significantly higher than the specific repair of 8-oxoG residues (Fig. 3B). This result suggests that in the repair of oxidative DNA damage, the efficiency of the initial step(s), up to the production of 3′ OH primers for repair synthesis, determines the overall repair activity. PCNA is not only a protein required for DNA replication but also plays a key role in long patch BER and NER (reviewed in Ref. 29Jonsson Z.O. Hubscher U. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 1-9Crossref Scopus (218) Google Scholar). A purified HeLa cell extract fraction, CFII, containing all the components required for BER except PCNA (data not shown) was used to verify whether the repair of 8-oxoG was affected by the presence of PCNA. The CFII fraction (Fig. 4, lanes 4–6) was able to perform the short patch BER of the oxidized base. The addition of PCNA did not modify the extent of DNA repair in the case of short incubation times (lanes 7 and 8), whereas an increase of the full repair product was observed after 2 h of repair (lane 9). This increase is likely to reflect filling in of gaps longer than 1 nucleotide due to strand displacement reactions stimulated by PCNA. Because the repair reaction is largely independent from the presence of PCNA, this is an additional argument suggesting that neither NER nor long patch BER play a significant role in the repair of this lesion. A fine mapping of the repair patch was performed using different radiolabeled dNTPs in the repair reaction. Fig. 5 shows that the large majority of the nucleotide replacements in the reactions are confined to 1 nucleotide (lanes 1–3), approximately one-third of the repair events involve 2 nucleotides (lanes 4–6), and very rarely exceed this size including 3–7 nucleotides downstream to the lesion (lane 7). As expected, no repair synthesis was detected in the undamaged control plasmid (lane 8). Pol β is the major DNA polymerase implicated in the single-nucleotide gap filling synthesis in BER (27Fortini P. Pascucci B. Parlanti E. Sobol R.W. Wilson S.H. Dogliotti E.

Horton J.K. Kuhn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar) were tested for their ability to repair 8-oxoG residues. As shown in Fig. 6, we observed a striking difference in the amount of repair when wild-type cell extracts (lanes 1–4) were compared with Pol β-defective extracts (lane 5–8). In the absence of Pol β, almost no repair was detected after 1 h of repair time (lane 6), whereas the repair process using wild-type cells extracts had by that time reached a plateau (Fig. 6B). Moreover, when purified rat Pol β (10 ng) was added to the Pol β-null extract (Fig. 7, lanes 7 and 8), the repair activity was restored to the level measured with wild-type extracts (lanes 1 and 2). Taken all together these results strongly suggest that Pol β is the polymerase of election for filling in the gap created by the excision of 8-oxoG. Pol β-defective extracts were eventually able to repair the gap after 3 h of incubation (Fig. 6A, lane 8), suggesting a possible back-up system that is Pol β-independent.Figure 7Effect of additional Pol β on 8-oxoG repair by wild-type and Pol β-deleted mouse cell extracts.

As shown in Fig. 8, mouse extracts were unable to perform detectable repair synthesis of three or more nucleotides at this lesion (lanes 1–3) extending to other species the results reported above for human cells. This type of long patch repair synthesis was only detected with Pol β-defective extracts (lanes 4–6), although the extent of activity was at the threshold of detection (lane 6). In the BER pathway, the initial step is mediated by specific DNA-glycosylases that excise the modified base and thus generate an AP site. There are two classes of DNA glycosylases. An example of the first one is the ANPG protein, the human 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase, a homolog of the E. coli Alk A protein, whose only catalytic function is the cleavage of the C1′-N-glycosydic bond, liberating the modified base and generating an AP site in DNA. This AP site is believed to be further processed by the HAP1/APEX protein, an AP endonuclease that generates on the 5′ side a nick having a 3′-hydroxyl group (reviewed in Ref. 13Rothwell D.G. Hickson I.D. Hickson I.D. Base Excision Repair of DNA Damage. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1997: 67-80Google Scholar). An example of the second class of DNA glycosylase is the OGG1 protein, the homolog of the E. coli Fpg protein, that excises oxidized purines. Besides its DNA glycosylase activity, this protein is endowed with a AP lyase activity that nicks DNA at AP site by a β-elimination mechanism (28Bjoras M. Luna L. Johnsen B. Hoff E. Haug T. Rognes T. Seeberg E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6314-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 32Rosenquist T.A. Zharkov D.O. Grollman A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7429-7434Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). It generates on the 3′ side a nick having a 5′-phosphate. Therefore the products generated by these two classes of glycosylases are different. In mammalian cells, two pathways are involved in AP site repair, the short patch (1-nucleotide gap filling) and the long patch (2–6 nucleotide resynthesis) BER (reviewed in Ref. 33Wilson S.H. Mutat. Res. 1998; 407: 203-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that structural different modified bases, being recognized by DNA glycosylases having different intrinsic properties, will drive the repair process to either the short or the long patch pathway. In this study we showed that, indeed, HX and εA, excized by the monofunctional ANPG protein, are repaired via both the short and long patch BER, whereas 8-oxoG residues, excized by the bifunctional OGG1 protein, are repaired mainly by the short patch pathway. In the case of HX and εA, under our experimental conditions, the relative efficiency of the two BER branches was similar to what previously reported for the repair of preformed AP site, suggesting that the initial step, i.e. the cleavage by the DNA N-glycosylase, is not rate-limiting. In the case of 8-oxoG, the repair kinetics was much slower than that observed for the repair of preformed abasic site, suggesting that in this case the initial step(s),i.e. the cleavage by the glycosylase/AP lyase and/or the 3′ terminus-removing activity, could drive the efficiency of the process. In E. coli 8-oxoG residues are repaired by both BER and NER (34Czeczot H. Tudek B. Lambert B. Laval J. Boiteux S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3419-3424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data show that in mammalian cells most of 8-oxoG lesions are repaired by the short patch BER in a PCNA-independent mechanism. However, our observations do not preclude a small contribution of NER to repair of oxidative DNA damage (35Reardon J.T. Bessho T. Chuan Kung H. Bolton P.H. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9463-9468Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), which might go undetected in our repair assay. To attain the sensitivity required for detection of the repair patches we used appropriately purified circular duplex substrates containing modified nucleotides having stable glycosidic bonds located at specific positions of the plasmid genome. The lesions that are introduced by exogenous damaging DNA compounds generate substrates that have serious drawbacks; the specificity is not absolute, and the lesions are randomly distributed in the molecule. The use of different types of damaged DNA substrates (single lesion versus randomly damaged plasmids) might explain some discrepancies between our findings and those by Jaiswal et al. (36Jaiswal M. Lipinski L.J. Bohr V.A. Mazur S.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 76: 2184-2191Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar) on the repair pathways at 8-oxoG lesions. Based on our results we propose that the type of DNA glycosylase that initiates the BER process determines which branch of BER is selected to restore the original DNA template. Our findings suggest a model where the formation of a 5′ abasic terminus by the sequential action of a monofunctional glycosylase, like ANPG, and of a 5′-AP endonuclease, like HAP1/APE, and its slow processing by a dRPase activity will determine the long patch repair events that occur in competition with the predominant one-gap filling reactions. The status of the 5′ terminus would then have a functional role as already suggested by the finding that the dRP lyase activity of Pol β is rate-determining in a reconstituted BER system in vitro using AP endonuclease, Pol β, and DNA ligase I (16Srivastava D.K. Vande Berg B.J. Prasad R. Molina J.T. Beard W.A. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21203-21209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). In agreement with this model, the formation of a 3′ blocked terminus by the glycosylase/AP-lyase activity of OGG1 is preferentially followed by single nucleotide replacement reactions. In this case the determinant of the repair synthesis step could be the production of 3′ OH primers (likely by the 3′ phosphoesterase activity of HAP1) because the 5′ terminus produced by the AP-lyase is ready for the ligation step. While this manuscript was under revision, two studies were published on the BER of oxidative DNA damage. Klungland et al. (37Klungland A. Hoss M. Gunz D. Constantinou A. Clarkson S.G. Doetsch P.W. Bolton P.H. Wood R.D. Lindahl T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), by reconstituting in vitro the BER of oxidized pyrimidines that are a substrate for the hNth protein, a bifunctional DNA glycosylase (reviewed in Ref. 1Laval J. Jurado J. Saparbaev M. Sidorkina O. Mutat. Res. 1998; 402: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), showed that this type of BER is strictly a 1-nucleotide replacement pathway. A model similar to that inferred from our data is proposed implying that the presence of a genuine 5′ nucleotide residue minimizes strand displacement events. The second paper by Dianov et al. (38Dianov G. Bischoff C. Piotrowski J. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33811-33816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) reported that mammalian cell extracts repair 8-oxoG lesions preferentially via single nucleotide replacement reactions (75% of the repair events). In this study, in agreement with the findings reported above, the contribution of NER to the repair of this lesion was not significant. The limited efficiency of repair of 8-oxoG, also observed by Dianovet al. (38Dianov G. Bischoff C. Piotrowski J. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33811-33816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), leaves open the question of whether our experimental conditions are optimal for detecting this repair process. It is not possible to rule out that cofactors that might stimulate, for example, the affinity of the DNA glycosylase for the target lesion are lost or not functional in our assay. Moreover, several reports suggest that the repair of oxidative lesions might be inducible. The major mammalian AP endonuclease, HAP1/APEX, whose 3′ phosphoesterase activity removes 3′ blocking groups generated in DNA by glycosylase/AP lyase activity, has been shown to be activated specifically by reactive oxygen species (39Ramana C.V. Boldogh I. Izumi T. Mitra S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5061-5066Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). This activation is paralleled by an increased cell resistance to the cytotoxicity of reactive oxygen species generating agents. These findings are compatible with the hypothesis that HAP1, via its phosphoesterase activity, is the rate-limiting step in BER of oxidative lesions. In previous studies (21Stucki M. Pascucci B. Parlanti E. Fortini P. Wilson S.H. Hubscher U. Dogliotti E. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 835-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 23Frosina G. Fortini P. Rossi O. Abbondandolo A. Dogliotti E. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) we have shown that Pol β-defective cell extracts are able to compensate for the lack of Pol β by using Pol δ and/or ε for repair synthesis following AP site incision. Also in the case of 8-oxoG repair back-up systems seem to be able to substitute for Pol β because Pol β -null cells are eventually able to repair these lesions although at a much slower rate than wild-type cells. The understanding of the biological relevance of these back-up repair systems in vivo waits further studies on the genotoxic effects in Pol β-null cells of various BER-inducing agents including reactive oxygen species generators. We are grateful to L. Gargano for technical assistance."

Molecular, cultivation-independent methods have played a key role in this insight. To what extent do humans remain ignorant of microbial diversity within the human body and the settings in which microorganisms cause human disease? In addition to implicating microbial agents in nontraditional infectious diseases, the use of methods such as broad-range polymerase chain reaction, representational difference analysis, expression library screening, and host gene expression profiling may force a reassessment of the concepts of microbial disease causation."

The influence of knots on the properties of polymers has become of great interest, in part because of their effect on mechanical properties. Knot theory applied to the topology of macromolecules indicates that the simple trefoil or 'overhand' knot is likely to be present in any long polymer strand. Fragments of DNA have been observed to contain such knots in experiments and computer simulations. Here we use ab initio computational methods to investigate the effect of a trefoil knot on the breaking strength of a polymer strand. We find that the knot weakens the strand significantly, and that, like a knotted rope, it breaks under tension at the entrance to the knot."

This activation of the Bcl-2 promoter by Brn-3a is strongly inhibited by the p53 anti-oncogene protein. This inhibitory effect of p53 on Brn-3a-mediated transactivation is observed with nonoverlapping gene fragments containing either the Bcl-2 p1 or p2 promoters but is not observed with other Brn-3a-activated promoters such as in the gene encoding α-internexin or with an isolated Brn-3a binding site from the Bcl-2 promoter linked to a heterologous promoter. In contrast, p53 mutants, which are incapable of binding to DNA, do not affect Brn-3a-mediated activation of the Bcl-2 p1 and p2 promoters. Moreover, Brn-3a and p53 have been shown to bind to adjacent sites in the p2 promoter and to directly interact with one another, bothin vitro and in vivo, with this interaction being mediated by the POU domain of Brn-3a and the DNA binding domain of p53. The significance of these effects is discussed in terms of the antagonistic effects of Bcl-2 and p53 on the rate of apoptosis and the overexpression of Brn-3a in specific tumor cell types. The Brn-3a POU family transcription factor has been shown to strongly activate expression of the Bcl-2proto-oncogene and thereby protect neuronal cells from programmed cell death (apoptosis).

The significance of these effects is discussed in terms of the antagonistic effects of Bcl-2 and p53 on the rate of apoptosis and the overexpression of Brn-3a in specific tumor cell types. The rate of apoptosis (programmed cell death) is controlled by the balance between proteins that activate processes resulting in such death and other proteins that act to inhibit these processes. Thus, for example, the Bcl-2 proto-oncogene was originally identified on the basis of its activation by chromosomal translocation in non-Hodgkin B cell lymphomas (1Tsujimoto Y. Cossman J. Jaffe E. Croce C. Science. 1985; 228: 1440-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar) and was subsequently shown to protect a wide variety of different cell types from programmed cell death or apoptosis (for review see Ref. 2Reed J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2390) Google Scholar). Conversely, the p53 anti-oncogene protein, as well as inhibiting cellular proliferation, can also stimulate programmed cell death (for review see Ref. 3Agarwal M.L. Taylor W.R. Chernov M.V. Chernova O.B. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). It is clear therefore that Bcl-2 and p53 represent proteins with opposite effects on the rate of apoptosis. Moreover, it appears that Bcl-2 can specifically inhibit p53-dependent apoptosis. Thus, although overexpression of p53 can induce apoptosis in different cell types, this is prevented by overexpression of Bcl-2 (4Chiou S.-K. Rao L. White E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2556-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 5Marcellus R.C. Teodoro J.G. Charbonneau R. Shore G.C. Branton P.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1643-1650PubMed Google Scholar). In this regard, it is of interest that high levels of p53 are associated with low levels of Bcl-2 and vice versa, both during normal rat development (6Ibrahim A.P. Gallimore P.H. Grand R.J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 306-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and in different types of tumors (7Harn H.J. Ho L.I. Liu G.C. Lin F.G. Lin J.J. Chang J.Y. Lee W.H. Histopathology. 1996; 28: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 8Hoehner J.C. Gestblom C. Olsen L. Pahlman S. Br. J.

These findings suggest therefore that as well as being functionally antagonistic to one another, p53 and Bcl-2 may also be interlinked in terms of the processes regulating their expression. This possibility is supported by the finding that artificial overexpression of p53 in a murine leukemia cell line results in reduced Bcl-2 expression (10Miyashita T. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Wang J.G. Lin H.K. Lieberman D.A. Hoffman B. Reed J.C. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1799-1805PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, Bcl-2 levels are elevated in several tissues of knockout mice lacking functional p53 (10Miyashita T. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Wang J.G. Lin H.K. Lieberman D.A. Hoffman B. Reed J.C. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1799-1805PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wang T.T.Y. Hursting S.D. Perkins S.N. Phang J.M. Cancer Lett. 1997; 116: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Evidently, these results raised the possibility that the p53 transcription factor may have an inhibitory effect on Bcl-2 gene transcription. In agreement with this it has been shown that p53 can inhibit the Bcl-2gene promoter acting via a negative regulatory element in the 5′-untranslated region of the Bcl-2 gene (12Miyashita T. Harigai M. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3131-3135PubMed Google Scholar). Although this effect is evidently of interest, it is a relatively small one, with p53 producing a reduction in basal promoter activity between 1.5- and 2-fold via this region (12Miyashita T. Harigai M. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3131-3135PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, it remains unclear whether p53 has a significant effect on Bcl-2 gene transcription in particular situations. We have recently characterized the effect of the Brn-3a POU family transcription factor on the expression of the Bcl-2 gene. Thus, the activity of the Bcl-2 promoter is increased approximately 30-fold by co-transfection with Brn-3a (13Smith M.D. Ensor E.A. Coffin R.S. Boxer L.M. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16715-16722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Similarly, neuronal cell lines stably transfected with Brn-3a show approximately 15-fold overexpression of Bcl-2 protein derived from the endogenousBcl-2 gene packaged within its normal chromatin structure. Moreover, such overexpression of Brn-3a and the corresponding enhancement of Bcl-2 expression can protect the primary neuronal cells from apoptotic stimuli such as withdrawal of neurotrophic factors (13Smith M.D. Ensor E.A. Coffin R.S. Boxer L.M. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16715-16722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In view of the significant effect of Brn-3a on Bcl-2 gene expression in neuronal cells, we have therefore investigated the effect of p53 on activation of the Bcl-2 promoter by Brn-3a.

In all cases, the value obtained in transfections of the reporter plasmid with an expression vector lacking any insert was set at 100%, and all other values were compared with it. Assays of luciferase activity were carried out using a commercially available kit (Promega) and a Turner luminometer, whereas assays of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity were carried out according to the method of Gorman (22Gorman C.M. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1985: 143-190Google Scholar). The protein-protein interaction assay was performed according to the method described by Baniahmadet al., (23Baniahmad C. Nawaz Z. Baniahmad A. Gleeson M.A.G. Tsi M. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 34-43PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, Brn-3a or Brn-3b·GST fusion proteins linked to glutathione-Sepharose beads were prepared and stored in NENT buffer (100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris (pH 8), 0.5 Nonidet P-40, 0.5% milk powder). Prior to use, approximately 1–2 μg of the fusion proteins were incubated in 20% milk powder in NENT buffer for 15 min at room temperature. The beads were washed in 1 ml of NENT buffer and then in 1 ml of transcription wash buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 60 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 6 mmMgCl2, 8.2% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA). Following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis and densitometry, the volumes of in vitro translated proteins were adjusted so that relatively equal amounts of each protein were used. The in vitro translated p53 proteins or equivalent amounts of the luciferase control proteins were then incubated with the beads in 100 μl of transcription buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were washed (five times with 1 ml of NENT buffer), and the proteins were solubilized in SDS-loading buffer, heated to 100 °C for 5 min, and resolved on an SDS-12% polyacrylamide gel. Following electrophoresis, the gel was dried and exposed to radiographic film or a PhosphorImager screen. The amounts of protein retained following the interaction studies were assessed by comparing the intensity of the bands resulting after the protocol with that resulting when equivalent amounts of input protein were run on a similar gel. Immunoprecipitation was carried out to assess the interaction between Brn-3 proteins and p53 in vivo. Protein extracts were from rat tissues such as brain, ovary, and kidney (negative control). Tissues were homogenized in extraction buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) 170 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, and 10 μg of the protease inhibitors leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin per milliliter plus 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The tissue homogenate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min to pellet debris. The supernatant was precleared by incubatiing it with 25 μl of protein A-protein G-agarose slurry for 30 to 60 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation the supernatant was incubated overnight at 4 °C with one of the following: 10 μl of the anti-p53 antibody, 10 μl of antibody to the Bad protein (which does not interact with the Brn-3 proteins), or no antibody. The immunocomplexes were then collected by incubation with 30 μl of the protein A/protein G/agarose slurry for 30 min. The agarose beads were washed five times with buffer containing 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris (pH 8), and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and then boiled in 1× SDS-sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 62 mmTris-HCl (pH 6.8), 1% β-mercaptoethanol) and loaded onto an SDS 12%- polyacrylamide gel. A Western blot was produced, and this was probed with the antibodies to the Brn-3 proteins (1:1000 dilution). The electrophoretic mobility shift assay was carried out as described by Budhram-Mahadeoet al. (24Budhram-Mahadeo V. Parker M. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1029-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 μl of the in vitrotranslated p53 protein or luciferase (control) protein was added as indicated to 2 μl of 10× electrophoretic mobility shift assay buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 60 mm KCl, 4% Ficoll, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA) containing 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) to prevent nonspecific interactions, along with specific or nonspecific competitor oligonucleotides, and kept at room temperature for 5 min. One nanogram of 5′-end-labeled oligonucleotide probe (labeled with T4 kinase and purified on a Sephadex G-25 column) was then added, and this combination was mixed briefly, spun in a microcentrifuge for 5 s, and then incubated on ice for 45 min to 1 h. The DNA-protein complexes were resolved from free DNA by gel electrophoresis on a 7% polyacrylamide gel run in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA for 2–2.5 h at 4 °C. The oligonucleotide containing a consensus p53 binding site had the sequence 5′-CGAGAGACATGCCCAGGCATGCC-3′. The oligonucleotide containing the putative p53 binding motifs from the Bcl-2 promoter had the sequence 5′-TTACAAAAAGGAAACTTGACAGAGGATCATGCTGTACTTAAAAAAGAGCT-3′. Homologies to the consensus p53 binding site PuPuPuCA(TA)TGPyPyPy (25El-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar) are underlined. We have previously demonstrated that Brn-3a is able to strongly activate the full-length Bcl-2 promoter (13Smith M.D. Ensor E.A. Coffin R.S. Boxer L.M. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16715-16722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the effect of co-transfecting a p53 expression vector on the activation of the Bcl-2 promoter by Brn-3a. As illustrated in Fig. 1, Brn-3a was able to strongly transactivate the full-length Bcl-2 promoter in accordance with our previous results (13Smith M.D. Ensor E.A. Coffin R.S. Boxer L.M. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16715-16722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, this transactivation was completely abolished by inclusion of a p53 expression vector in the co-transfections. Indeed, the inclusion of p53 in the transfections containing Brn-3a resulted in a reduction in promoter activity below that observed in the absence of Brn-3a. This effect was not observed with the internal control plasmid in which the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter drives β-galactosidase expression and was therefore not due to a nonspecific effect of p53 on all promoter activity in the transfected cells. Hence, p53 can specifically abolish activation of the Bcl-2 promoter by Brn-3a as well as dramatically reduce promoter activity in ND7 cells, which are derived from sensory neurons and express endogenous Brn-3a (17Budhram-Mahadeo V.S.

To determine the specificity of this effect of p53 on activation of the Bcl-2 promoter, we examined the effect of p53 on activation of other promoters that we have previously shown to be responsive to Brn-3a. In particular, we have shown that a test promoter containing the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter, with an added octamer motif that binds Brn-3a, is responsive to activation by Brn-3a (14Morris P.J.

We therefore tested the effect of p53 on the activation of this promoter by Brn-3a. In these experiments (Fig. 2) over-expression of p53 had no effect on the ability of Brn-3a to activate this test promoter. Indeed, p53 appeared to have a strong activating effect when transfected with the promoter in the absence of Brn-3a and had no effect on activation by Brn-3a. In previous experiments, we have shown that the artificial test promoter containing an octamer motif can be activated by the isolated POU domain of Brn-3a, whereas activation of the Bcl-2 promoter requires an N-terminal domain of Brn-3a in addition to the POU domain (13Smith M.D. Ensor E.A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4100-4107Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We therefore wished to test the effect of p53 on another promoter activated by Brn-3a, in which activation is also dependent upon the presence of the N terminus. We therefore tested the effect of p53 on the activation of the α-internexin promoter, in which activation requires the N terminus of Brn-3a (17Budhram-Mahadeo V.S. Morris P.J. Lakin N.D. Theil T.

However, in these experiments no effect of p53 on the ability of Brn-3a to activate the α-internexin promoter was observed (Fig. 3). Hence, the inhibitory effect of p53 on stimulation of the Bcl-2 promoter by Brn-3a was specific to this promoter and was not observed with other Brn-3a-responsive promoters even when, as in the case of the α-internexin promoter, such activation required the N-terminal activation domain of Brn-3a. In view of the specificity of this effect for the Bcl-2 promoter, we wished to characterize it further. Thus, the Bcl-2 promoter construct used in the experiments shown in Fig. 1 contains both of the two independent promoters, p1 and p2, that drive expression of theBcl-2 gene (Fig. 4). We have previously demonstrated that Brn-3a is able to transactivate both the p1 and the p2 promoter (13Smith M.D. Ensor E.A. Coffin R.S. Boxer L.M. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16715-16722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We therefore wished to investigate the effect of p53 on the activation of each of these promoters by Brn-3a. As shown in Fig. 5, p53 was able to abolish the activation of the p1 Bcl-2 promoter by Brn-3a, although in this case the activity of the promoter was not reduced below its basal level. Stronger inhibition of activation by Brn-3a, with promoter activity being reduced below the basal level, was observed for a fragment of the p2 promoter from −740 to −170 relative to the transcription start site (Fig. 6) and for a shorter fragment containing the region of the p2 promoter from −740 to −355 (data not shown), which does not contain the element (−279 to −85) that mediates the previously described weak inhibitory effect of p53 on the basal activity of the Bcl-2 promoter (12Miyashita T. Harigai M. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3131-3135PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 4).Figure 5Assay of luciferase activity when the Bcl-2 p1 promoter reporter construct was co-transfected with expression vector alone (V) or expression vectors encoding Brn-3a or p53 either alone or in combination.

Coffin R.S. Boxer L.M. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16715-16722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and that can confer a response to Brn-3a on a heterologous promoter (27Smith M.D. Dawson S.J. Boxer L.M. Latchman D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4100-4107Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether p53 was able to interfere with the activation of a heterologous thymidine kinase promoter containing this added Brn-3a binding site. In these experiments, however, no inhibition of promoter activation by Brn-3a was observed when p53 was included in the co-transfection experiments (Fig. 7). Thus, as in the case of an octamer motif linked to the heterologous promoter, p53 was unable to repress a heterologous promoter containing the isolated Brn-3a binding site from the Bcl-2 promoter in the absence of any other region of the promoter. This finding suggested that p53 may need to bind to the Bcl-2 promoter between −740 and −355 to mediate its inhibitory effect on Brn-3a-mediated transactivation and that activation of a heterologous promoter by the isolated Brn-3a binding site is therefore not inhibited by p53. To investigate this possibility further, we tested the effect of p53 mutants that are unable to bind to DNA. As illustrated in Fig. 8, p53 mutants in which one or other of the arginines at amino acids 175 or 273 have been changed to histidine and which are unable to bind to DNA (28Crook T. Marston N.J. Sara E.A. Vousden K.H. Cell. 1994; 79: 817-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 29Park D.J. Nakamura H. Chumakov A.M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1899-1906PubMed Google Scholar) were also unable to interfere with Brn-3a-mediated activation of the Bcl-2 promoter. In contrast, the ability to repress Brn-3a-mediated activation was observed with another mutation at position 175 in which a proline residue was substituted for the arginine. This mutation results in a loss of the ability to induce apoptosis in fibroblasts but does not impair the ability to transactivate target promoters and retains the ability to bind to DNA (28Crook T. Marston N.J. Sara E.A. Vousden K.H. Cell. 1994; 79: 817-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 30Rowan S. Ludwig R.L. Haupt Y. Bates S. Lu X. Oren M. Vousden K.H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 827-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Similarly, the ability of p53 to inhibit Brn-3a-mediated activation was unaffected by the deletion of a regulatory domain that is contained in the last 30 C-terminal amino acids of the p53 protein. These findings suggest, therefore, that the effect of p53 on Brn-3a-mediated activation of the Bcl-2 promoter may be dependent on the binding of p53 to the promoter. This dependence would explain why p53-mediated repression is ineffective on Brn-3a-activated promoters lacking such a p53 binding site or containing only an isolated Brn-3a binding site from the Bcl-2 promoter. We therefore examined the sequence of the p2 Bcl-2 promoter from −740 to −355 for potential p53 binding sites. Between −558 and −535, this region contains two motifs that closely resemble the PuPuPuCA(TA)TGPyPyPy consensus binding site for p53 (25El-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar). These motifs are located close to the Brn-3a binding site at −598 to −581 in the p2 promoter (Fig. 4). In DNA mobility shift assays, this sequence was able to compete for p53 binding with the consensus binding p53 binding site, although an unrelated oligonucleotide was unable to do so (Fig. 9). Hence, the region of the p2 promoter that is necessary for the inhibitory effect of p53 on Brn-3a-mediated activation can also bind p53. Although these experiments confirm the likely importance of DNA binding by p53 in its inhibitory effect, they do not indicate the manner in which the inhibitory effect of p53 is mediated following DNA binding. We therefore wished to determine whether Brn-3a and p53 can also interact directly with one another via a protein-protein interaction. To do this, we carried out pull-down assays using Brn-3a protein linked to glutathione S-transferase (GST) and in vitrotranscribed and translated p53 protein. These experiments showed, that full-length p53 was readily able to interact with Brn-3a (Fig. 10A). This interaction could also be observed when p53 was linked to GST and mixed with in vitro transcribed and translated Brn-3a protein, but it was not observed when either p53 or Brn-3a alone was mixed with GST itself (data not shown). Moreover, by using fragments of p53 in this assay we were able to demonstrate that this interaction could be observed with a p53 fragment containing the first 292 amino acids of the protein but not with a fragment containing only the N-terminal 106 amino acids, further confirming the specificity of this effect. Similarly, no interaction was observed with a fragment containing amino acids 202–393, even though such an interaction was observed with a fragment containing amino acids 44–393. Hence, the interaction with Brn-3a maps to the DNA binding domain of p53 (Fig. 10A). Similarly, interaction with p53 could be observed with a GST fusion protein containing only the POU domain of Brn-3a (Fig. 10B), indicating that this region of Brn-3a is required for the interaction. A similar interaction between Brn-3a and p53 could also be demonstrated using a yeast two-hybrid assay (data not shown). These data indicate therefore that interaction with Brn-3a and p53 mediated by the DNA binding domains of the two proteins can readily be observed in in vitro assays. To demonstrate that this interaction also occurs in vivo in intact cells, we immunoprecipitated extracts of different tissues with an antibody to p53 and then probed the resulting immunoprecipitates with an antibody to Brn-3a in a Western blotting assay. As illustrated, in Fig. 11, when extracts from rat brain were utilized in this assay, Brn-3a was readily detected in the immunoprecipitate using p53 antibody, indicating that the two factors interact. Indeed, the amount of Brn-3a detected was greater than that observed when an antibody to the estrogen receptor was used, indicating that the p53/Brn-3a interaction is comparable or stronger than that which we previously observed between Brn-3a and the estrogen receptor (24Budhram-Mahadeo V. Parker M. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1029-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This interaction between p53 and Brn-3a was a specific one because, as shown in Fig. 11, no Brn-3a was observed in the immunoprecipitate in the absence of a primary antibody or when immunoprecipitation was carried out with an antibody to the Bad protein, which shows no interaction with Brn-3a (24Budhram-Mahadeo V. Parker M. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1029-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Similarly, no Brn-3a was observed in the immunoprecipitate with anti-p53 antibody when extracts from the rat kidney, which does not express Brn-3a, were used (data not shown). Hence, the ability of p53 to inhibit activation of the Bcl-2 promoter by Brn-3a is paralleled by a direct interaction between these two proteins, which occurs both in vitro and within intact mammalian cells in vivo. In this report we have shown for the first time that the p53 anti-oncogene protein is able to strongly inhibit the activation of the Bcl-2 promoter by Brn-3a. This effect is much stronger than the previously reported weak repression of basal Bcl-2 promoter activity via a negative element located in the 5′-untranslated region of theBcl-2 gene (12Miyashita T. Harigai M. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3131-3135PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in that study, the effect of p53 on the Bcl-2 promoter was relatively weak, producing an approximately 1.5–2-fold reduction in promoter activity on transfection with wild type p53 compared with the promoter activity observed with an inactive p53 mutant (12Miyashita T. Harigai M. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3131-3135PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, in our study, p53 was able to reduce the promoter activity in the presence of Brn-3a by approximately 50-fold compared with the activity observed in the presence of Brn-3a alone (see for example Fig. 1). Moreover, this effect is specific to the Bcl-2 promoter because it was not observed with the α-internexin promoter. This is of particular importance because this promoter, like the Bcl-2 promoter, requires the N-terminal activation domain of Brn-3a for its activation (13Smith M.D. Ensor E.A. Coffin R.S. Boxer L.M. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16715-16722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 17Budhram-Mahadeo V.S. Morris P.J. Lakin N.D. Theil T. Ching G.Y.

Latchman D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4100-4107Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Similarly, repression of Brn-3a-mediated activation by p53 was not observed with test promoters containing either a cloned octamer binding site for Brn-3a or a binding site for Brn-3a from the Bcl-2 promoter. This finding indicates therefore that some feature of the architecture of the Bcl-2 promoter, apart from a Brn-3a binding site, is required for p53 to be able to repress this promoter. Interestingly, mutants of p53, which are unable to bind to DNA, were not able to repress the stimulation of the Bcl-2 promoter by Brn-3a. It is therefore possible that the Bcl-2 promoter contains binding sites for p53 through which the inhibitory effect is mediated. Indeed, we have observed that p53 does bind to a region of the p2 promoter adjacent to the Brn-3a binding site. This element is present within the p2 promoter fragment in which activation by Brn-3a is inhibited by p53 but is absent from the construct containing only the Brn-3a binding site, which is not repressed by p53, indicating that it is likely to be important for the effect we observe. In contrast, the smallest p2 promoter fragment (−740 to −355) in which Brn-3a-mediated activation is repressed by p53 does not contain the negative regulatory element (−279 to −85) that has previously been shown to mediate a weak effect on p53 on the basal activity of the Bcl-2 promoter (12Miyashita T. Harigai M. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3131-3135PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of p53 on Brn-3a-mediated transactivation can certainly occur in the absence of this element, and it is therefore unlikely that the inhibitory effect of p53 on Brn-3a-mediated activation of the full promoter involves this previously defined element. Although the p53 binding site in the p2 promoter that we have identified is likely to be involved in the effects we observe, it cannot be the only element able to mediate the effect of p53 on Brn-3a-mediated activation, because this effect was also observed with the Bcl-2 p1 promoter construct, which lacks this element. It is noteworthy, however, that the full-length Bcl-2 promoter and p2 constructs that contain the p53 binding site demonstrated lower activity in the presence of Brn-3a and p53 than that observed in the absence of any added regulatory proteins. This effect was not observed for the p1 promoter, which lacks this motif. Clearly, further detailed studies of the Bcl-2 p1 and p2 promoters will be required to fully characterize the sequences involved in the p53 effect on Brn-3a-mediated activation. It is already clear however that p53 can produce a strong inhibition of the stimulatory effect of Brn-3a on the p1 and p2 Bcl-2 promoters and that, at least in the case of the p2 promoter, these factors bind to adjacent sites in the promoter. Moreover, such an inhibitory effect of p53 on Brn-3a is paralleled by a direct interaction between Brn-3a and p53, which we have demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo in mammalian cells. It is likely therefore that, following DNA binding, a protein-protein interaction occurs between Brn-3a and p53 that prevents Brn-3a from stimulating the Bcl-2 promoter. Although this interaction may directly inhibit the activity of Brn-3a, it is also possible that it prevents Brn-3a from interacting with another factor that is required for activation of the Bcl-2 promoter. Thus, we have shown that activation of the Bcl-2 promoter by Brn-3a occurs only upon transfection into neuronal cells and not in non-neuronal cell types (27Smith M.D. Dawson S.J. Boxer L.M. Latchman D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4100-4107Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have shown that the stimulatory effect of Brn-3a on the Bcl-2 promoter can be inhibited by including in the transfections the isolated N terminus of Brn-3a unlinked to any DNA binding domain that would remove from the DNA any Brn-3a-interacting factor necessary for transcriptional activation (27Smith M.D. Dawson S.J. Boxer L.M. Latchman D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4100-4107Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These experiments suggest therefore that Brn-3a may interact with a neuron-specific factor to mediate its effect upon the Bcl-2 promoter, thereby raising the possibility that interaction of Brn-3a with p53 prevents its interaction with another activating factor. Whatever the precise mechanism of the effect of p53 on Brn-3a-mediated activation of the Bcl-2 promoter, its effect is likely to be of importance in terms of the regulation of the Bcl-2 gene in specific cells types in which Brn-3a is expressed. Thus, it may, at least in part, account for the opposite expression patterns of p53 and Bcl-2 both during normal rat development (6Ibrahim A.P. Gallimore P.H. Grand R.J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 306-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and in different tumors (7Harn H.J. Ho L.I. Liu G.C. Lin F.G. Lin J.J. Chang J.Y. Lee W.H.

Wilkland H.J. Olsen L. Pahlam S. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 62: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) as well as the increased levels of Bcl-2 that are observed in p53 knockout mice (10Miyashita T. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Wang J.G. Lin H.K. Lieberman D.A. Hoffman B. Reed J.C. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1799-1805PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wang T.T.Y. Hursting S.D. Perkins S.N. Phang J.M. Cancer Lett. 1997; 116: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, in the absence of p53 Brn-3a would be able to strongly stimulate the Bcl-2 promoter, whereas in the presence of p53 this effect would not be observed. These effects are likely to be of particular importance in tumorigenesis because Brn-3a has been shown to be overexpressed in a number of different tumor cells, notably in cervical tumors (32Ndisang D. Morris P.J. Chapman C. Ho L. Singer A. Latchman D.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1687-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), aggressive neuroendocrine tumors (33Leblond-Francillard M. Picon A. Bertagna X. Keyzer Y. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 89-94PubMed Google Scholar), and neuroblastomas (34Latchman D.S. Int. J. Oncol. 1997; 10: 1133-1139PubMed Google Scholar, 35Smith M.D. Latchman D.S. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 67: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Moreover, Brn-3a has been shown to cooperate with the myconcogene in transforming primary cells with such an oncogenic effect being dependent upon the presence of the same N-terminal domain that is involved in stimulating Bcl-2 gene expression (15Theil T. McLean-Hunter S. Zornig M. Möröy T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5921-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Hence, Brn-3a may exert an oncogenic effect by stimulating the activation of Bcl-2, with such an effect being opposed by the p53 protein. This effect is of particular interest in the case of neuroblastomas because such tumors express high levels of Bcl-2 similar to those found in B cell lymphomas, but unlike lymphomas they do not exhibit any structural rearrangement of the Bcl-2 gene that could account for its overexpression. This finding suggests that specific transcription factors are likely to stimulate transcription of the unrearranged Bcl-2 gene in these cells (36Reed J.C. Meister L. Tanaka S. Cuddy M. Yum S. Geyer C. Pleasure D. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6529-6538PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, in different patients, reduced Bcl-2 expression in neuroblastoma cells correlates with enhanced apoptosis and good prognosis/spontaneous regression of the tumor (31Hoehner J.C. Hedborg F. Wilkland H.J. Olsen L. Pahlam S. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 62: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 37Oue T. Fukuzawa M. Kusafuka T. Kohmoto Y. Imura K. Nagahara S. Okada A. J. Pediatr. Surg. 1996; 31: 251-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and p53 and Bcl-2 exhibit a reciprocal expression pattern in these tumors (8Hoehner J.C. Gestblom C. Olsen L. Pahlman S. Br. J. Cancer. 1997; 75: 1185-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It is therefore of interest that studies with a number of p53 mutants have indicated that mutants that do not bind to DNA cannot induce apoptosis (for review see Refs. 38Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar and 39Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6738) Google Scholar), paralleling the need for DNA binding for p53 to inhibit the effect of Brn-3a on the Bcl-2 promoter. Similarly, such mutant studies have suggested that the ability to suppress tumor growth (28Crook T. Marston N.J. Sara E.A. Vousden K.H. Cell. 1994; 79: 817-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and induce apoptosis (30Rowan S. Ludwig R.L. Haupt Y. Bates S. Lu X. Oren M. Vousden K.H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 827-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 40Haupt Y. Rowan S. Shaulian E. Vousden K.H. Oren M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2170-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) is more closely correlated with the ability of p53 to repress some promoters rather than with its ability to activate other promoters. Hence, the ability to interfere with Brn-3a-mediated activation of the Bcl-2 promoter may represent one of the means by which transcriptional inhibition by p53 acts to promote apoptosis and inhibit tumorigenesis. In summary, our data demonstrate for the first time the ability of p53 to strongly repress the significant activation of the Bcl-2 promoter by Brn-3a. This effect is likely to play a key role in determining the level of Bcl-2 gene expression and hence of apoptosis, particularly in neuronal cells, as well as accounting for, at least in part, the previously reported reciprocal expression pattern of p53 and Bcl-2 in specific neuronal and tumor cell types. We thank M. Oren and K. Vousden for the very kind gift of p53 reagents essential to this study."

The gene affected in one of these mutants,VPS21, encodes a member of the Sec4/Ypt/Rab family of small GTPases. Rab proteins play an essential role in vesicle-mediated protein transport. Using both yeast two-hybrid assays and chemical cross-linking, we have identified another VPS gene product, Vps9p, that preferentially interacts with a mutant form of Vps21p-S21N that binds GDP but not GTP. In vitro purified Vps9p was found to stimulate GDP release from Vps21p in a dose-dependent manner. Vps9p also stimulated GTP association as a result of facilitated GDP release. However, Vps9p did not stimulate guanine nucleotide exchange of GTP-bound Vps21p or GTP hydrolysis. We tested the ability of Vps9p to stimulate the intrinsic guanine nucleotide exchange activity of Rab5, which is a mammalian sequence homologue of Vps21p, and Ypt7p, which is another yeast Rab protein involved in vacuolar protein transport. Rab5, but not Ypt7p was responsive to Vps9p, which indicates that Vps9p recognizes sequence variation among Rab proteins. We conclude that Vps9p is a novel guanine nucleotide exchange factor that is specific for Vps21p/Rab5.

Vesicle-mediated protein transport is responsible for executing many intracellular protein trafficking events (1Palade G. Science. 1975; 189: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2354) Google Scholar). This process is mediated by complex machinery that is highly conserved from yeast to cells of higher eukaryotes (2Rothman J.E. Orci L. Nature. 1992; 355: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 3Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2559-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Members of the Sec4/Ypt/Rab family of small GTP-binding proteins are an integral part of this conserved machinery and are thought to participate in the targeting and/or fusion of transport vesicles with the appropriate target membrane (4Pfeffer S.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 5Novick P. Brennwald P. Cell. 1993; 75: 597-601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Although the exact function(s) of Rab proteins is unknown, vesicle targeting events have been coupled to the cycling of Rab proteins between their GTP-bound and GDP-bound states, leading to the following model (4Pfeffer S.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 5Novick P. Brennwald P. Cell. 1993; 75: 597-601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). GTP-bound Rab proteins associate with transport vesicles derived from the donor compartment. Transport vesicles with this form of the Rab protein are competent for targeting to the acceptor organelle (6Nuoffer C. Balch W.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 949-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). At the acceptor organelle, a GTPase-activating protein or GAP may act on the Rab to stimulate the hydrolysis of Rab bound GTP to GDP (7Strom M. Vollmer P. Tan T.J. Gallwitz D. Nature. 1993; 361: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The GDP-bound Rab is then recycled back to the vesicle donor membrane in a complex with GDP-dissociation inhibitor (GDI) 1The abbreviations used are: GDI, GDP dissociation inhibitor; GDF, GDI dissociation factor; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; DTT, dithiothreitol; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; vps, vacuolar protein sorting; CPY, carboxypeptidase Y. (for review, see Ref.8Pfeffer S.R. Dirac-Svejstrup A.B. Soldati T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17057-17059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Reloading Rab proteins with GTP is thought to involve two steps. In the first step, the Rab protein is dissociated from GDI by a GDI dissociation factor (GDF) (9Dirac-Svejstrup A.B. Sumizawa T. Pfeffer S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Once separated from GDI, the Rab protein is now accessible to the activity of a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that facilitates the exchange of GDP for GTP. The Rab protein in its GTP-bound form is now capable of participating in another round of vesicle targeting and fusion. An important regulatory step within the Rab cycle is at the stage of guanine nucleotide exchange. Several GEFs have been described for members of the Sec4/Ypt/Rab family of small GTP-binding proteins. Novick and colleagues (10Walch-Solimena C. Collins R.N. Novick P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1495-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that Sec2p possesses guanine nucleotide exchange activity for Sec4p. Sec4p is involved in vesicle-mediated transport of secretory proteins from the yeast Golgi to the plasma membrane (11Goud B. Salminen A. Walworth N.C. Novick P.J. Cell. 1988; 53: 753-768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 12Novick P. Field C. Schekman R. Cell. 1980; 21: 205-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). In addition, a GEF has been purified from rat brain that shows specificity for Rabs 3A, 3C, and 3D (13Wada M. Nakanishi H. Satoh A. Hirano H. Obaishi H. Matsuura Y. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3875-3878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Interestingly, primary amino acid sequence comparisons fail to show any obvious sequence similarity among the GEFs that stimulate guanine nucleotide exchange of Sec4/Ypt/Rab GTP-binding proteins; indicating that each of these GEFs function in distinct vesicular transport pathways. Vesicle-mediated transport plays an important role in the localization of proteins to the lysosome-like vacuole in yeast. Most vacuolar proteins follow the initial stages of the secretory pathway until they reach a late Golgi compartment. There, vacuolar proteins are actively sorted away from secretory proteins, packaged into transport vesicles and delivered to the vacuole via a prevacuolar endosome (for review, see Ref. 14Horazdovsky B.F. DeWald D.B. Emr S.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Genetic studies of the vacuolar protein sorting (vps) pathway have identified a large number of mutant yeast strains that missort and secrete vacuolar proteins (15Bankaitis V.A. Johnson L.M. Emr S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9075-9079Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 16Rothman J.H. Stevens T.H.

These vpsmutants (vacuolar protein sorting defective) fall into over 40 complementation groups. One group ofvps mutants (termed class D) (19Raymond C.K. Howald-Stevenson I. Vater C.A. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1389-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar) appears to affect a single stage in the vps pathway, the transport of proteins from the Golgi to the prevacuolar endosome (20Stack J.H. Horazdovsky B. Emr S.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Many of gene products affected in the class D vps mutants have been implicated specifically in the targeting and/or fusion of Golgi-derived transport vesicles and several are members of highly conserved protein families (21Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10830-10834Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 22Cowles C.R. Emr S.D. Horazdovsky B.F. J.

Cell. 1997; 8: 1089-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). One of these, Vps21p, is a small GTP-binding protein of the Sec4/Ypt/Rab family. VPS21 was originally identified by complementation of the vacuolar protein missorting phenotype associated withvps21 mutant cells (25Horazdovsky B.F. Busch G.R. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1297-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and by its sequence similarity with mammalian Rab5 (29Singer-Kruger B. Stenmark H. Dusterhoft A. Philippsen P. Yoo J.S. Gallwitz D. Zerial M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). A detailed mutational analysis has demonstrated that GTP-binding and membrane association are required for Vps21p function (25Horazdovsky B.F. Busch G.R. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1297-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In addition, cells that lack Vps21p not only missort vacuolar hydrolases, but also accumulate 40–50-nm vesicles (25Horazdovsky B.F. Busch G.R. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1297-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 29Singer-Kruger B. Stenmark H. Dusterhoft A. Philippsen P. Yoo J.S. Gallwitz D. Zerial M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), indicating a role for Vps21p in vesicle targeting and or fusion events. To better understand the role of the Vps21 GTP-binding protein in vesicle targeting, we undertook a study to identify modulators of Vps21p function among the gene products affected in the class Dvps mutants. Using in vitro and in vivo techniques, a physical interaction was uncovered between Vps21p and Vps9p. This interaction is potentiated when a mutant form of Vps21p is used that possesses a higher affinity for GDP than GTP. In addition, we show that Vps9p is a GEF that stimulates the intrinsic guanine nucleotide exchange rate of Vps21p. The guanine nucleotide exchange activity of Vps9p is specific for Vps21p and its mammalian sequence homologue, Rab5.

Yeast strains were grown in 2% peptone, 1% yeast extract, 2% glucose (YPD) or in synthetic medium (SM) supplemented with the appropriate amino acids as required (34Sherman F. Fink G.R. Lawrence L.W.

Polymerases, restriction and modifying enzymes were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Life Technologies, Inc., or New England Biolabs. [35S]Pro Mix, [γ-32P]GTP, peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, and peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG were purchased from Amersham. [3H]GDP was from NEN Life Science Products Inc. Monoclonal anti-HA antibody was obtained from Berkeley Antibody Co. Production of antiserum to Vps21p and carboxypeptidase Y has been described previously (25Horazdovsky B.F. Busch G.R. Emr S.D.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5262-5273Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). To create the Vps21p, Vps21p-S21N two-hybrid baits, and the Vps9p two-hybrid prey, the coding sequences of these genes were amplified by PCR using pGBY21–5, pBHY21–11 (25Horazdovsky B.F. Busch G.R.

These products were ligated into either pVJL11 (36Jullien-Flores V. Dorseuil O. Romero F. Letourneur F. Saragosti S. Berger R. Tavitian A. Gacon G. Camonis J.H. J. Biol.

Demetrick D. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2378-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) to create the Vps9p prey, GT9-1. Expression of these fusion proteins in the L40 strain was confirmed by immunoblotting. To create CEN and 2-μm yeast expression plasmids encoding C-terminal HA-tagged Vps9p, a SmaI site was created at the 3′ end of the VPS9 coding sequence eliminating the stop codon using PCR mutagenesis. This amplified product was digested with SmaI and HindIII and inserted into the same sites of pRS416 to create pGT9-3. ASmaI-EcoRV fragment containing the coding sequence for the HA-epitope from plasmid YEp352-HA was inserted into the SmaI site of pGT9-3 to create pGT9HA-1. TheEcoRV-HindIII fragment of pGT9HA-1 was subcloned into pRS426 (38Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to create the 2-μm plasmid, pGT9HA-2. To create Vps21p and Vps21p-S21N E. coli expression constructs, theVPS21 and VPS21-S21N coding sequences were amplified by PCR from pGBY21–2 (25Horazdovsky B.F. Busch G.R. Emr S.D.

These products were cloned into the E. coli expression vector, pKK223-3 (Pharmacia Biotech) to create the Vps21p and the Vps21p-S21N expression constructs pBHY21–30 and pBHY21–76. pQEVPS9, which contains the VPS9 gene modified with a NH2-terminal hexahistidine-coding sequence, was constructed in the same manner as pGT9-1 except pQE31 (QIAGEN, Inc.) was used. The NH2-terminal sequence of the His6-Vps9p is M-R-G-S-(H)6-T-D-P-Vps9p. A His6-Vps9p yeast expression construct, pEMBL-VPS9 was constructed by cloning the (His)6-VPS9 gene from pQEVPS9 into pEMBLye30/2 (39Banroques J. Delahodde A. Jacq C. Cell. 1986; 46: 837-844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The E. coli Ypt7p expression construct was created by amplifying the YPT7 gene from pBS-YPT7 (40Wichmann H. Hengst L. Gallwitz D. Cell. 1992; 71: 1131-1142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and cloning the PCR product into pKK223-3 resulting in pKKYPT7. Thevps21::NEO R construct was generated by first subcloning the SmaI/SpeI kan MX4 module from pFA6-kanMX4 (41Wach A. Brachar A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar) into pBluescript II (Stratagene) to create pBS-NEO. An EcoRV fragment containing the kanMX4 module from pBS-NEO was inserted into the Klenow enzyme-treatedSalI/BglII sites of pBHY21–18 to create plasmid pBHY21–78. L40 yeast cells (30Vojtek A.B.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2378-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected and streaked onto SM plates lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine. β-Galactosidase filter assays were performed as described previously (30Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). GTY1 (vps9Δ2::HIS3 vps21Δ3::NEO) were transformed with low or high copy Vps9HAp expression plasmids (pGT9HA-1 and pGT9HA-2, respectively), and/or with low or high copy Vps21p expression plasmids (pGBY21-5 and pBHY21-28, respectively), or a low copy Vps21p-S21N expression plasmid (pBHY21-11). Strains were grown in appropriate SM to an OD600 of 0.8 and spheroplasts were generated, lysed, and treated with the cross-linking agent dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) as described previously (25Horazdovsky B.F. Busch G.R. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1297-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Vps21p and its associated proteins were isolated by immunoprecipitation as described previously (42Horazdovsky B.F. Davies B.A. McLaughlin S.A. Yoon S.-H. Seaman M.N.J. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1529-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were resolved in duplicate by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The presence of Vps9HAp and Vps21p was determined by Western analyses (43Dunn S. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 157: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) using HA monoclonal antibodies or Vps21p antiserum and the ECL chemiluminescent detection system (Amersham, Inc.). Wild-type Vps21p and Vps21p-S21N were purified from E. coli CW2642 carrying pBH21-30 or pBH21-76, respectively. Recombinant proteins were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were harvested and washed twice with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl and 100 mm NaCl. The cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and lysed using a Bead-Beater (BioSpec Products). The lysate was cleared by sequential centrifugation and the supernatant was subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionation. Proteins that precipitated at 40–60% saturation were collected. The desalted proteins were loaded onto a DEAE-Sephacel column pre-equilibrated with buffer A (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgSO4). Proteins that eluted with buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl were precipitated by adding ammonium sulfate to 80%. Dialyzed samples (Buffer A) were loaded onto a Q2 anion exchange column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with buffer A. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0 to 150 mm NaCl in buffer A. Ypt7p was purified fromE. coli CW2642 carrying pKKYPT7. Induction and purification was carried out similarly to the Vps21p procedure with minor modifications. Proteins were eluted from a DEAE-Sephacel column with buffer A containing 200 mm NaCl. The eluate was concentrated, dialyzed, and loaded onto a Q2 column. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–300 mm NaCl in buffer A. M15 E. coli cells carrying pREP4 and pQEVPS9 were grown and induced as described for the Vps21p purification. Cells were harvested, washed, lysed, and (His)6-Vps9p was purified from the crude cell extract using Ni-NTA agarose as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen). (His)6-Vps9p was eluted from the Ni-NTA agarose, concentrated, dialyzed against buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol), and loaded onto a Q2 column. Proteins were eluted with a 0 to 300 mm linear NaCl gradient in buffer B. Wild-type or Vps21p-S21N was incubated in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm DTT, 3 mm EDTA, 50 μm [3H]GDP (2.6 × 104 cpm/μl), or [γ-32P]GTP (6.5 × 104 cpm/μl) for 30 min at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped by adding 1 ml of ice-cold buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgSO4) and subsequently filtered through nitrocellulose membranes (0.45-μm pore). The membrane filters were washed twice with 5 ml of ice-cold buffer C and dried. The amount of radioactivity associated with the filters was determined using a liquid scintillation counter. Displacement was monitored by incubating preloaded [3H]GDP or [γ-32P]GTP-Vps21p in 250 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 15 μm [3H]GDP (1.5 × 104 cpm/μl), or [γ-32P]GTP (1.3 × 104 cpm/μl) for 30 min at 30 °C. One hundred μl of the preloaded Vps21p was mixed with an equal volume of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm MgSO4, 4 mm GDP with or without Vps9p and incubated at 30 °C. At each time point, 25 μl of the mixture was removed and diluted in 1 ml of ice-cold buffer C. Protein-bound [3H]GDP or [γ-32P]GTP was determined as in the binding assay described above. The assay was carried out in the same manner for Ypt7p and His-Rab5. Nucleotide exchange activity was monitored by incubating Vps21p in the presence or absence of Vps9p in 200 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm MgSO4, 4 mm GTP, and [γ-32P]GTP (100 μCi/ml). Vps21p-associated [γ-32P]GTP was determined as described above. Yeast cells were grown, labeled with [35S]methionine and cysteine and subjected to immunoprecipitation as described (25Horazdovsky B.F. Busch G.R. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1297-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The activity of small GTP-binding proteins of the Ras family is highly regulated. This regulation is carried out by a growing number of factors that modulate or stabilize the guanine nucleotide associated with the appropriate GTPase. In this study, we undertook a search for factors that associate with Vps21p in its GDP-bound form and in doing so hoped to uncover the factor(s) responsible for exchanging GDP for GTP. An extensive characterization of the nucleotide binding capabilities of mutant Ras proteins (44Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3242Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar) have identified a number of amino acid alterations that result in proteins that show great preferences for binding GDP or GTP. One of these, Ras N17, has been shown to bind GDP with a 20–40-fold higher affinity than GTP (44Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3242Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). The equivalent mutant in Vps21p (S21N) has been constructed and was shown to elicit defects in the vacuolar protein sorting pathway, indicating the importance of GTP binding for Vps21p function in vivo (25Horazdovsky B.F. Busch G.R. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1297-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). To characterize the guanine nucleotide binding preferences of recombinant wild-type Vps21p and the Vps21p-S21N mutant form of the protein, these proteins were purified from E. coli as described under “Experimental Procedures” and their abilities to bind GDP and GTP were examined. The estimated purity of these proteins was 75 and 80% for the wild-type and Vps21p-S21N, respectively (Fig. 1A), and no other GTP-binding proteins were detected in these fractions by [32P]GTP blot analysis. 2H. Hama and B. F. Horazdovsky, unpublished observations. Purified wild-type and S21N-Vps21p were incubated with [3H]GDP or [32P]GTP in the presence of EDTA. Endogenous nucleotides bound to Vps21p rapidly exchanged with radiolabeled nucleotides under these conditions, reaching maximum binding within 30 min.2As shown in Fig. 1B, Vps21p-S21N bound substantially more GDP (26 pmol) than GTP (<2 pmol). Whereas, wild-type Vps21p bound slightly more GTP (32 pmol) than GDP (24 pmol). These results demonstrate that Vps21p-S21N, like the Ras N17 protein, preferentially binds GDP. vps21 mutants fall into the class D vps morphology group. This group shares a unique subset of phenotypes including, vacuolar protein sorting defects, enlarged vacuolar structures, a temperature-sensitive growth phenotype, as well as defects in mother to daughter vacuole segregation and vacuole acidification. Previous studies have shown that several of the gene products affected in these mutants likely function at the same stage in the vacuolar protein sorting pathway (20Stack J.H. Horazdovsky B. Emr S.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 45Horazdovsky B.F. Cowles C.R. Mustol P. Holmes M. Emr S.D. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2195-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The yeast two-hybrid system was used to uncover potential interactions between Vps21p and gene products affected in other class D vps mutants. LexA gene fusions were constructed that contained wild-type or mutant S21NVPS21 coding sequences. A second set of gene fusions was constructed between the activation domain of Gal4p (Gal4AD) and other class D VPS gene products. These constructs were used to transform a yeast strain (L40) that contained the HIS3 andlacZ reporter gene constructs under control theLexA promoter. As shown in Fig. 2, L40 yeast that expressed both the LexA-Vps21p-S21N fusion and the Gal4AD-Vps9p fusion were prototrophic for histidine. On the contrary, L40 yeast that expressed both the LexA-Vps21p wild-type fusion and the Gal4AD-Vps9p fusion, or the LexA-Vps21p-S21N or Gal4AD-Vps9p fusions alone were not prototrophic for histidine (Fig. 2A). All strains tested were able to grow on synthetic media that contained histidine (Fig. 2B). A second reporter system was utilized to score an interaction between the LexA-Vps21p-S21N fusion and the Gal4AD-Vps9p fusion. The same five strains tested in Fig. 2, A and B, were patched onto an agar plate containing synthetic media (+ histidine). The yeast cells were transferred to nitrocellulose filters, lysed, and the presence of β-galactosidase was determined by an activity assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). Only cells coexpressing the LexA-Vps21p-S21N fusion and the Gal4AD-Vps9p fusion had observable β-galactosidase activity (patch 1, Fig. 2C). Neither the LexA-Vps21p (wild-type) fusion together with the Gal4AD-Vps9p fusion nor the LexA-Vps21p or Gal4AD-Vps9p fusions alone expressed the β-galactosidase reporter (patches 2–5, Fig. 2C). These results were completely consistent with those generated using theHIS3 reporter gene, indicating that the Vps9p may have a preferential binding affinity for a GDP-bound form of Vps21p. Cross-linking studies were used to confirm the Vps21p-Vps9p two-hybrid results and to examine if the two-hybrid interaction accurately represented an in vivo phenomenon. Spheroplasts generated from cells (GTY1; vps21Δ3, vps9Δ2) expressing various combinations of Vps9HAp, Vps21p, and Vps21p-S21N from low or high copy number plasmids, were lysed and the lysates were treated with the homobifunctional cross-linking agent, dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate), or left untreated. The lysates were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with Vps21p antiserum and the immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The resolved immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western analysis, using Vps21p antiserum to detec"

The genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains more than 70 open reading frames (ORFs) encoding for proteins that, as judged from the deduced primary sequence, can be predicted to be modified by the attachment of a GPI anchor (2Hamada K.

A minority of GPI proteins retain the GPI anchor in an intact form and stay at the plasma membrane (PM). For the biosynthesis of GPI anchors, phosphatidylinositol (PI) is modified by the stepwise addition of sugars and ethanolamine phosphate (EtN-P), thus forming a complete precursor lipid (CP) which subsequently is transferred en bloc by a transamidase onto newly synthesized proteins in the ER (7Takeda J.

The identification of genes involved in the biosynthesis of the CP and its subsequent attachment to proteins has been possible through the complementation of mammalian and yeast gpi− mutants, i.e. mutants being deficient in GPI anchoring of membrane proteins (7Takeda J.

In our laboratory, a series of recessive gpi− mutants (gpi4 to gpi10) has been obtained by screening for yeast mutants that are unable to display the GPI-anchored α-agglutinin (Sag1p) at the outer surface of the cell wall, although the synthesis and secretion of soluble proteins is normal (21Benghezal M.

Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Here we report on the characterization of gpi7. Four independent gpi7 mutants accumulated M4, an abnormal GPI intermediate that is less hydrophilic than CP2, the precursor accumulating when the transfer of GPIs to proteins is interrupted (18Hamburger D.

Our preliminary characterization of M4 had shown that deacylation by NH3 followed by HF treatment, used to hydrolyze selectively the phosphodiester bonds (Fig. 1), yielded the same Man4-GlcN-inositol fragment as CP2, and we speculated thatgpi7 mutants may be unable to add the EtN-P onto Man3 (Fig. 1) (21Benghezal M. Lipke P.N. Conzelmann A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1333-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Here we show that this speculation was wrong, that CP2 differs from M4 with regard to a previously unrecognized side chain attached to Man2 (Fig. 1), and that GPI7 is required for the attachment of this side chain.

Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2515) Google Scholar) to generate pBF41 (Fig. 3C) and pBF43, respectively. One step disruption of GPI7 was done as described (28Wach A. Brachat A. Pöhlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2235) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 1.5-kb long KanMX4 module was PCR-amplified by using pFA6a-KanMX4 as template and the following two adapter primers: GPI7-forwards (5′-CTTCACCAAGTTAGCAAGATGAACTTGAAGCAGTTCACGTGCCtcgatgaattcgagctc-3′) with 17 nucleotides (nt) of homology to the pFA6a-KanMX4 multiple cloning site (in lowercase) and 43 nt of homology toGPI7 (in uppercase) starting 18 nt upstream of the start codon (bold); GPI7-backwards (5′-ATCAAGAGCGCAAAGGAGGGCCAATTCAGGTAACCAGCCATTCAcgtacgctgcaggtcgac-3′) with 18 nt of homology to the pFA6a-KanMX4 multiple cloning site (lowercase) and 44 nt of homology to the ORF ofGPI7 in the region immediately upstream of the stop codon. This PCR DNA fragment was used to transform the diploid strain FBY118, homozygous for GPI7, and FBY40, a heterozygousgpi7-1/GPI7 strain. The correct targeting of the PCR-made KanMX4 module into the GPI7 locus in geneticin-resistant clones was verified by PCR with whole yeast cells using primers GPI7-plus (5′-GTTCATCTACCACGCAC-3′) starting 36 nt upstream of the ATG, GPI7-minus (5′-GACCCAAGTAATGCAGG-3′) starting 631 base pairs downstream of the ATG and the K2 primer of the KanMX4 module (5′-GTATTGATGTTGGACG-3′). Plasmid pBF41 (Fig. 3C) was digested withBstYI and EcoRV to generate a 633-base pair fragment of GPI7. This fragment was inserted into the multiple cloning site of the bacterial expression vector pQE-30 (Qiagen) digested with BamHI/SmaI thus generating the plasmid pBF402. This plasmid was used to transform the E. coli strain M15[pREP4]. Expression of the recombinant protein was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen) under denaturing conditions according to the manufacturer's instructions. A polyclonal antiserum was raised against this Gpi7p fragment by repeated intramuscular injections of 100 μg of recombinant protein into a rabbit. Ten mg of the recombinant protein were coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and antiserum was affinity purified as described (29Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 541-552Google Scholar). The nature of the association of Gpi7p with the membrane was determined following a previously described protocol (30Feldheim D. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 935-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) except that the EDTA concentration in buffer G was increased from 2 to 20 mm. Gpi7p protease sensitivity was examined by proteinase K digestion of microsomes essentially as described (31Baxter B.K. James P. Evans T. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6444-6456Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 A 600 of washed W303 cells were resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm sucrose, 3 mm magnesium acetate, 20 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and were lysed by agitation with glass beads at 4 °C. The homogenate was centrifuged for 5 min at 600 × g to remove unbroken cells, and the supernatant was centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 × g. The membrane pellet was resuspended in 240 μl of the same lysis buffer and split into 6 aliquots of equal size. Aliquots of microsomes were incubated for 20 min on ice with or without 0.5% Triton X-100 and proteinase K. Digestions were stopped by addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (final concentration 4 mm, added from a 200 mm stock in ethanol) and kept on ice for an additional 10 min before being boiled in sample buffer (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). The subcellular localization of Gpi7p was determined essentially as described (33Gaynor E.C. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 789-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Briefly, 500 A 600 units of mid-log phase W303-1B cells were broken by agitation with glass beads in 200 mm sorbitol, 25 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaN3/NaF, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, pepstatin, and antipain, each at 30 μg/ml). After removal of the unbroken cells the homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 8,000 × g at 4 °C to generate pellet P8 and supernatant S8. S8 was divided in two and either precipitated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid to 10% or centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to generate pellet P100. For zymolyase treatment the cells were washed and resuspended at 50 A 600 units/ml in zymolyase buffer (1.2 m sorbitol, 50 mmK2HPO4 pH 7.5, 40 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm EDTA, 10 mmNaN3, 10 mm NaF) containing zymolyase 20T. After a 40-min incubation at 30 °C, cells were placed on a cushion of 1.5 m sorbitol, 50 mmK2HPO4, pH 7.5, 20 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaN3, 10 mm NaF and were centrifuged. For Western blotting, all the samples were denatured during 5 min at 95 °C in reducing sample buffer and run on a 6, 7.5, or 10% SDS-PAGE for detection of antigens, respectively (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). Western blotting was carried out with anti-Wbp1p, anti-alkaline phosphatase, anti-Gas1p, or anti-Kex2p antisera or with affinity purified anti-Gpi7p or anti-Och1p antibodies, always using the chemiluminescence ECL kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK. Previously described procedures were used to label cells with [2-3H]Man (23Sipos G. Puoti A. Conzelmann A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2789-2796Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), [4,5-3H]DHS, or [2-3H]Ins (24Reggiori F. Canivenc-Gansel E. Conzelmann A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3506-3518Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and to label microsomes with UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (22Canivenc-Gansel E. Imhof I. Reggiori F. Burda P. Conzelmann A. Benachour A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Delipidated protein extracts for SDS-PAGE and lipid extracts were made as described (24Reggiori F. Canivenc-Gansel E. Conzelmann A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3506-3518Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Lipid extracts were analyzed by ascending TLC using 0.2-mm thick silica gel 60 plates with the solvent 1 (chloroform/methanol, 0.25% KCl in water, 55:45:10, v/v) or solvent 2 (chloroform/methanol/water, 10:10:3, v/v). Radioactivity was detected and quantitated by one- and two-dimensional radioscanning (LB 2842; Berthold AG, Regensdorf, Switzerland). TLC plates were sprayed with EN3HANCE and exposed to film (X-Omat; Eastman Kodak Co.) at −80 °C. Lipid extracts were deacylated with NaOH (34Puoti A. Desponds C. Conzelmann A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 515-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and treated with JBAM (35Ralton J.E. Milne K.G. Güther M.L.S. Field R.A. Ferguson M.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24183-24189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described. For GPI-PLD treatment lipid extracts were dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 20% 1-propanol. Incubations were for 12 h at 37 °C. All treated lipid extracts were desalted by partitioning between n-butyl alcohol and an aqueous solution of 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and back extraction of the butanol phase with water before TLC (23Sipos G. Puoti A. Conzelmann A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2789-2796Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Lipids were treated with methanolic NH3 to remove the acyl group on Ins (36Roberts W.L. Myher J.J. Kuksis A. Low M.G. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18766-18775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cleaved using nitrous acid (37Güther M.L. Masterson W.J. Ferguson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18694-18701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described. Lipids were purified by preparative TLC on 0.2-mm thick Silica Gel 60 plates (Merck, Germany) in solvent 2. Radioactive spots were localized by radioscanning, scraped, and eluted with solvent 2. A second run on TLC was done to obtain radiochemically pure M0, M4, and CP2. Soluble head groups were obtained from lipids through GPI-PLD treatment done as above, followed by limiting methanolic NH3deacylation (36Roberts W.L. Myher J.J. Kuksis A. Low M.G. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18766-18775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Non-hydrolyzed GPIs were removed by butanol extraction (23Sipos G. Puoti A. Conzelmann A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2789-2796Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The water-soluble head groups were treated with JBAM (0.5 units) or ASAM (5 microunits) as described (38Puoti A. Conzelmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22673-22680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HF dephosphorylation was done as described (39Puoti A. Conzelmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7215-7224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The generated fragments were analyzed by paper chromatography in methylethyl ketone/pyridine/H2O (20:12:11) as described (39Puoti A. Conzelmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7215-7224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Before paper chromatography the products were N-acetylated and desalted over mixed-bed ion exchange resin AG-501-X8 (Bio-Rad) unless indicated otherwise (34Puoti A. Desponds C. Conzelmann A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 515-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Acetolysis was done as described (40Schneider P. Ferguson M.A. McConville M.J. Mehlert A. Homans S.W. Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16955-16964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radiolabeled Manx-GlcNAc-[3H]Ins (x = 1, 2, 3, 4) chromatography standards (Figs. 5 and6, standards 1–4) were generated through fragmentation of [3H]Man-labeled head groups of CP2, isolated frompmi40 by acetolysis then HF, HF then ASAM, JBAM then HF, and HF treatments, respectively. The GlcNAc-[3H]Ins standard (Figs. 5 and 6, standard 0) was generated by HF treatment of the [3H]Ins-labeled head group of M0, obtained fromsec53 cells. All standards were N-acetylated. Dionex HPLC analysis of non-dephosphorylated head groups was done exactly as described (23Sipos G. Puoti A. Conzelmann A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2789-2796Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Anchor peptides were prepared from labeled proteins as described (23Sipos G. Puoti A. Conzelmann A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2789-2796Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).Figure 6M4 of Δgpi7 contains an HF-sensitive substituent on Man1 but lacks an HF-sensitive substituent on Man2. CP2 and M4 head groups were obtained from [3H]Man labeled pmi40 and [3H]Ins labeled Δgpi7, respectively. A and B, head groups of M4 were subjected to acetolysis and then either treated with JBAM (B) or left untreated (A). Finally all products were dephosphorylated with HF,N-acetylated, and analyzed by paper chromatography.C and D, head groups were treated for 12 h with HF, desalted, treated with JBAM, treated with HF for 60 h,N-acetylated, and finally analyzed by paper chromatography. Standards 0–4 are Manx-GlcNAc-Ins (x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4). Free [3H]Man ran out of the paper shown in C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For limiting HF treatment, aliquots of radiolabeled head groups derived from CP2 and M4 and prepared as above were dephosphorylated with 50 μl of 48% aqueous HF at 0 °C as described (38Puoti A. Conzelmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22673-22680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for 0–28 h. After neutralization with saturated LiOH, samples were desalted by gel filtration through an 8-ml Sephadex G-10 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column. Samples were then dried in the Speed-Vac and treated with JBAM prior to complete HF dephosphorylation (60 h, 0 °C). Samples were neutralized again with LiOH and N-acetylated. Aliquots were dried and then directly applied to Whatman paper No. 1M and analyzed by descending chromatography as described above. As reported before (19Benghezal M. Benachour A. Rusconi S. Aebi M. Conzelmann A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6575-6583Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and shown in Fig. 2, wild type (wt) cells do not contain polar GPIs (lane 1), gpi8-1 accumulates CP2 as the most polar GPI lipid (lane 8), and gpi7-1 and the gpi7-1/gpi8-1 double mutant accumulate M4 (lanes 4 and 6), thus demonstrating that gpi7-1 is epistatic to gpi8-1 and suggesting that, during GPI biosynthesis, Gpi7p may act before Gpi8p. Although the originalgpi7 mutants and the unrelated gpi8-1 mutant were not significantly temperature-sensitive (ts) for growth, the growth of the gpi7-1/gpi8-1 double mutant was strongly temperature-dependent. Transfection of a genomic library into this double mutant allowed the isolation of clones containing complementing plasmids (19Benghezal M. Benachour A. Rusconi S. Aebi M. Conzelmann A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6575-6583Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). These clones were labeled withmyo-[3H]inositol ([3H]Ins) at 37 °C, and the lipids were extracted and analyzed by TLC. Upon transfection some gpi7-1/gpi8-1 indeed had regained the ability to make CP2 (Fig. 2, lanes 6 and 7) and showed the same lipid profile as gpi8-1 (Fig. 2, lane 8). All these clones harbored plasmids containing YJL062w as the only complete ORF. Transfection of a multicopy vector containing YJL062w under its own promoter (pBF41, Fig. 3C) into gpi7-1almost completely cured the accumulation of M4 (Fig. 2, lane 5). As expected, the accumulation of CP2 by gpi8-1 was not abolished by the overexpression of YJL062w (Fig. 2, lanes 8 and 9). YJL062w predicts an 830-amino acid membrane protein with an N-terminal signal sequence for insertion into the ER, 5 potential N-glycosylation sites, and about 9–11 putative transmembrane domains (Fig. 3, A and B). YJL062w was deleted and replaced by the selectable marker KanMX4. On rich medium the deletants grew about as rapidly as wt cells at all temperatures. Thus, YJL062w is not an essential gene. We were unable to sporulate ΔYJL062/ΔYJL062 diploids indicating that YJL062 is required for sporulation. However, ΔYJL062/YJL062 heterozygotes sporulated readily and ΔYJL062 spores germinated normally. In accordance with previous results on gpi7 mutants (21Benghezal M. Lipke P.N. Conzelmann A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1333-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), growth of ΔYJL062 (= Δgpi7, see below) on plates at 37 °C was severely inhibited by 0.5 mg/ml Calcofluor White. ΔYJL062 accumulated M4 at even higher levels than gpi7-1,and this accumulation was almost completely suppressed by the transfection of pBF41 (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 3). Residual accumulation of M4 may be due to some cells that lost the complementing plasmid. Transfection of YJL062w under its own promoter on a single copy vector (plasmid pBF43) was sufficient to suppress the accumulation of M4 in a homozygous ΔYJL062/ΔYJL062 diploid (Fig. 2,lanes 11 and 12). As can be seen in Fig. 2,gpi7-1, ΔYJL062, ΔYJL062/ΔYJL062, andgpi8-1 mutants also show minor amounts of the GlcNα1,6(acyl→)Ins-P-DAG GPI intermediate M0, the accumulation of which is believed to reflect a build up of GPI intermediates throughout the biosynthetic pathway (Fig. 2, lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, and11). (It should be noted that some intermediates of intermediate size are obscured on TLC by PI and inositol phosphoceramide (41Sipos G. Reggiori F. Vionnet C. Conzelmann A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3494-3505Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).) As expected, expression of YJL062w abolishes the accumulation of M0 in gpi7-1 and ΔYJL062 (Fig. 2,lanes 3, 5, and 12) but not ingpi7-1/gpi8-1 nor gpi8-1 (lanes 7 and9), since in the latter the GPI biosynthesis remains blocked. To evaluate if the mutation in gpi7-1 is genetically linked to YJL062w, YJL062w was disrupted in a heterozygousgpi7-1/GPI7 diploid. Correct replacement of one YJL062w locus was verified by PCR in two independent geneticin-resistant transformants. The verified deletants were sporulated, and a total of 26"

Although progress has been made in transformation of Tetrahymena with heterologous DNA, methods that permit reliable expression of foreign genes have been lacking. Using a mutant strain of T. thermophila carrying a negatively selectable allele of a β-tubulin gene, we have been able to direct foreign genes to this locus by homologous recombination. Transformed cell lines producing foreign proteins were readily identified and, in at least one case, targeting of proteins to the plasma membrane was accomplished."

To investigate the mechanism of p53-mediated apoptosis and to determine whether cleavage of MDM2 has a potential role in regulating p53, we examined caspase activation and cleavage of MDM2 in a cell line undergoing p53-mediated growth arrest and delayed apoptosis. We found that in H1299 cells expressing a temperature-sensitive human p53, a distinct caspase activity specific for the MDM2 cleavage site DVPD is induced by p53 prior to the onset of apoptosis and loss of viability. This is accompanied by the cleavage of MDM2 but not the apoptotic substrate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. The cleaved MDM2 loses the ability to promote p53 degradation and may potentially function in a dominant-negative fashion to stabilize p53. These results suggest that p53 activation may induce a positive feedback effect by cleavage of MDM2 through a unique caspase.

Despite the identification of several p53-inducible genes that can regulate apoptosis, such as Bax (25Miyashita T. Reed J.C.

Furthermore, it is unclear why different tumor cells or different cell lines of the same tumor type often exhibit either a growth arrest or apoptosis response to p53, which may be clinically important. Recent studies using cell fusion revealed that the apoptotic response phenotype is dominant over growth arrest (23Polyak K. Waldman T. He T.C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1945-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), suggesting that expression of a specific factor may confer an apoptotic response to p53.Apoptosis typically involves the activation of proteolytic cascades of caspases and cleavage of vital cellular proteins (27Cryns V. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). Fas/CD95- and tumor necrosis factor-α-induced apoptosis involve activation of caspase 8 through receptor-mediated oligomerization (28Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5114) Google Scholar).

The ability of p53 to induce KILLER/DR5 expression and to promote Fas/CD95 export to the cell surface (31Bennet M. Macdonald K. Chan S.W. Luzio J.P. Simari R. Weissberg P. Science. 1998; 282: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar) provides a possible apoptotic pathway. Whether this is a general mechanism of p53-mediated apoptosis is still not clear.During p53-induced apoptosis, the MDM2 oncoprotein is also cleaved by a caspase after the aspartic acid residue 361 (30Chen L.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15049-15052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Proteolytic cleavage of MDM2 has been proposed to play a role in eliminating its p53-inhibitory effect and possibly other cell survival functions of MDM2. However, due to the rapid and non-synchronous nature of p53-induced apoptosis, whether MDM2 cleavage is an early event that can contribute to p53 regulation has not been determined. Furthermore, the caspase cleavage fragment of MDM2 can still bind to p53 and inhibit its transcription function when overexpressed (30Chen L. Marechal V. Moreau J. Levine A.J. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22966-22973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Thus the functional significance of the cleavage is still unclear.We recently observed that certain tumor cell lines express high levels of a 60-kDa isoform of MDM2 protein (p60) similar to the caspase cleavage fragment of MDM2 (33Pochampally R. Fodera B. Chen L. Shao W. Levine E.A. Chen J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2629-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The expression of p60 can be inhibited by culturing cells in caspase inhibitor Z 1The abbreviations used are: Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; FMK, fluoromethyl ketone; CMV, cytomegalovirus; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; CHO, aldehyde; CHAPS, 3[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; AMC, aminomethylcoumarin; pRb, retinoblastoma protein. 1The abbreviations used are: Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; FMK, fluoromethyl ketone; CMV, cytomegalovirus; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; CHO, aldehyde; CHAPS, 3[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; AMC, aminomethylcoumarin; pRb, retinoblastoma protein.-VAD-FMK, can be produced from a transfected full-length MDM2 cDNA, and is blocked by point mutation of residue 361 (33Pochampally R. Fodera B. Chen L. Shao W. Levine E.A. Chen J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2629-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Cells can produce high levels of p60 in normal culture conditions, with no detectable apoptosis and cleavage of another apoptosis substrate PARP. These results suggest that caspase-mediated processing of MDM2 can occur in the absence of apoptosis; MDM2 is unique compared with other known apoptotic substrates in being targeted by a caspase in non-apoptotic cells. The variable levels of p60 in different cell lines suggest that this caspase may be regulated by unknown factors and may play a role in the regulation of MDM2 and p53.In this report, we describe the characterization of MDM2 cleavage using a cell line that undergoes p53-mediated growth arrest followed by delayed, partial apoptosis. This system enabled us to examine p53-induced events before the onset of apoptosis. We found that p53-induced growth arrest results in the activation of a unique caspase that is specific to MDM2, resulting in the production of p60 after p53 activation. Activation of the MDM2-specific caspase occurs before the activation of apoptotic caspases. p60 is deficient in promoting p53 degradation and can stabilize p53 by a dominant-negative mechanism.DISCUSSIONThe data presented here suggest that p53 can regulate a proteolytic activity specific for the caspase cleavage site of MDM2, before the onset of apoptosis and activation of other apoptotic caspases. The p53-induced protease activity is less efficient against peptide substrates for caspases 1, 3, and 8, suggesting the presence of a distinct MDM2-specific protease. The ability of this protease to cleave after the aspartic acid residue in the caspase cleavage site of MDM2 (DVPD361), the partial sensitivity to caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, and resistance to conventional serine and cysteine protease inhibitors suggest that it is a caspase.By using the MDM2 cleavage site substrate Ac-DVPD-AMC, we also detected an activity that is present in JAR cells, which constitutively produce cleaved MDM2 (p60) (33Pochampally R. Fodera B. Chen L. Shao W. Levine E.A. Chen J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2629-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this activity is nearly absent from SJSA cells, which lack significant p60 (33Pochampally R. Fodera B. Chen L. Shao W. Levine E.A. Chen J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2629-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In contrast, use of other fluorogenic peptide substrates revealed similar levels of cleavage activities in both cell lines. This further supports the presence of a protease that preferentially targets MDM2. The variability of the MDM2-specific protease activity suggests that it may be a regulatory rather than an effector protease in apoptosis. Thus, JAR cells with a significant level of MDM2 cleavage proliferate normally without committing to apoptosis (33Pochampally R. Fodera B. Chen L. Shao W. Levine E.A. Chen J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2629-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).Cleavage after DVPD361 results in the separation of the highly conserved MDM2 C-terminal Ring finger domain from the p53 binding domain. It has been shown that cysteine 464 is important for the ubiquitin ligase activity of MDM2 in vitro (46Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar). p60 does not promote p53 degradation; furthermore, it can function in a dominant-negative fashion to protect p53 from degradation by full-length MDM2. These results suggest that the 362–491 region of MDM2 is an important functional domain for promoting p53 degradation. The C-terminal cleavage fragment also contains the RNA binding activity of MDM2 (30Chen L. Marechal V. Moreau J. Levine A.J. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22966-22973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 47Elenbaas B. Matthias D. Roth J. Shenk T. Levine A.J. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 439-451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which may also be associated with the ability of MDM2 to promote p53 degradation.The ability of p53 to activate an MDM2-specific caspase suggests a signaling pathway for p53-mediated apoptosis. A threshold level of p53 may induce cleavage of MDM2 before commitment to cell death, resulting in a positive feedback effect on p53 level and further activation of the protease. In addition to cleavage of MDM2, the protease may be responsible for subsequently activating the DEVD-reactive caspase, forming signal transduction and amplification cascades that lead to commitment to apoptosis. This model is consistent with the dosage-dependent apoptotic effect of p53 (48Chen X. Ko L.J. Jayaraman L. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2438-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Certain tumor cell lines undergo growth arrest after p53 activation; it will be interesting to determine whether these cells fail to activate the MDM2-cleaving caspase.During apoptosis induced by survival factor withdrawal in the mouse myeloid cell line M1, p53 activity is required for caspase cleavage of pRb (49Gottlieb E. Oren M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The pRb-cleaving caspase can also be activated during the preparation of cytosol (49Gottlieb E. Oren M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, pRb is not cleaved in H1299-Val-138 cells producing p60, or by cytosol prepared from 32 °C H1299-Val-138 cells does not cleave in vitro translated pRb, 2R. Pochampally, B. Fodera, L. Chen, W. Lu, and J. Chen, unpublished observations. suggesting important differences between the caspases involved. The activation of MDM2 and pRb-cleaving caspases may be related events in a p53-regulated pathway; the pRb-cleaving caspase may be activated in a step more proximal to the commitment to apoptosis.In addition to caspase 3, MDM2 is also efficiently cleaved by recombinant caspase 8, suggesting that signaling pathways involving caspase 8 may be able to regulate p53 stability by modification of MDM2. Two cell death-promoting factors that act by activation of caspase 8, i.e. tumor necrosis factor-α and FasL, are known to induce p53 accumulation (50Jeoung D. Tang B. Sonenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18367-18373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 51Donato N.J. Perez M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5067-5072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It is possible that caspase 8 cleavage of MDM2 contributes to the stabilization of p53 by these factors. Proteolytic modification of MDM2 may provide a mechanism for other signaling pathways to interact with the p53 pathway.Activation of DEVD-specific caspases in the absence of apoptosis have been observed in mitogen-activated lymphocytes undergoing active proliferation, before the appearance of apoptosis (52Wilhelm S. Wagner H. Hacker G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 891-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Our results provide further evidence for the existence of a novel caspase active in proliferating or growth-arrested cells, prior to commitment to cell death.In summary, this study revealed the presence of a unique p53-regulated caspase that mediates the pre-apoptotic cleavage and inactivation of MDM2. This caspase activity may function in a positive feedback mechanism of p53 and may also have a role in the apoptotic signaling by p53. The protease is constitutively active in certain tumor cell lines, suggesting that it may also have a function in non-apoptotic conditions. Identification of the MDM2-specific caspase may shed light on the regulation of MDM2 and the apoptotic mechanism of p53. The p53 tumor suppressor can be activated by DNA damage (1Nelson W.G. Kastan M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar), deregulated oncogenes (2Lowe S.W. Ruley H.E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar), and hypoxia (3Graeber T.G. Peterson J.F. Tsai M. Monica K. Fornace Jr., A.J. Giaccia A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6264-6277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of p53 results in growth arrest or apoptosis by induction of downstream target genes (4Sabbatini P. Lin J. Levine A.J. White E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2184Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 5Attardi L.D. Lowe S.W. Brugarolas J. Jacks T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3693-3701Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and possibly transcription-independent mechanisms (6Caelles C. Helmberg A. Karin M. Nature. 1994; 370: 220-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar, 7Haupt Y. Rowan S. Shaulian E. Vousden K.H. Oren M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2170-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). The activity of p53 is regulated by the MDM2 oncoprotein, which binds to p53 and inhibits the transcription activation function (8Momand J. Zambetti G.P. Olson D.C. George D. Levine A.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1237-1245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2776) Google Scholar). MDM2 binding also promotes p53 degradation through the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway (9Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3659) Google Scholar, 10Kubbutat M.H.G. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2814) Google Scholar). MDM2 expression is induced by p53 (11Wu X. Bayle J.H. Olson D. Levine A.J.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar), thus forming a negative feedback loop that maintains p53 at low levels in the absence of stress. Loss of MDM2 results in embryonic lethality due to activated p53 (13Montes de Oca Luna R. Wagner D.S. Lozano G. Nature. 1995; 378: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar, 14Jones S.N. Roe A.E. Donehower L.A. Bradley A. Nature. 1995; 378: 206-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar), and overexpression of MDM2 in tumors results in suppression of p53 transcription function and apoptosis (15Chen L. Agrawal S. Zhou W. Zhang R. Chen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence suggests that regulation of the interaction between p53 and MDM2 by phosphorylation (16Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C.

Activation of p53 can lead to growth arrest or apoptosis, depending on cell types (21Martinez J. Georgoff I. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 22Chen J. Wu X. Lin J. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2445-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 23Polyak K. Waldman T. He T.C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1945-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). The cell cycle-arrest activity of p53 is largely mediated by induction of the p21WAF1 gene (24El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7892) Google Scholar). Despite the identification of several p53-inducible genes that can regulate apoptosis, such as Bax (25Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and KILLER/DR5 (26Lazebnik Y.A. Takahashi A. Moir R.D. Goldman R.D. Poirier G.G. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9042-9046Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), the apoptotic mechanism of p53 is not completely understood. Furthermore, it is unclear why different tumor cells or different cell lines of the same tumor type often exhibit either a growth arrest or apoptosis response to p53, which may be clinically important. Recent studies using cell fusion revealed that the apoptotic response phenotype is dominant over growth arrest (23Polyak K. Waldman T. He T.C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1945-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), suggesting that expression of a specific factor may confer an apoptotic response to p53. Apoptosis typically involves the activation of proteolytic cascades of caspases and cleavage of vital cellular proteins (27Cryns V. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). Fas/CD95- and tumor necrosis factor-α-induced apoptosis involve activation of caspase 8 through receptor-mediated oligomerization (28Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5114) Google Scholar). Caspase 8 can directly activate effector caspase 3 or induce mitochondria cytochromec release and activation of the Apaf1-caspase 9 complex (29Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3061) Google Scholar), which then activates effector caspases. Because p53-induced apoptosis also involves activation of effector caspases (23Polyak K. Waldman T. He T.C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B.

Proteolytic modification of MDM2 may provide a mechanism for other signaling pathways to interact with the p53 pathway.Activation of DEVD-specific caspases in the absence of apoptosis have been observed in mitogen-activated lymphocytes undergoing active proliferation, before the appearance of apoptosis (52Wilhelm S. Wagner H. Hacker G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 891-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Our results provide further evidence for the existence of a novel caspase active in proliferating or growth-arrested cells, prior to commitment to cell death.In summary, this study revealed the presence of a unique p53-regulated caspase that mediates the pre-apoptotic cleavage and inactivation of MDM2. This caspase activity may function in a positive feedback mechanism of p53 and may also have a role in the apoptotic signaling by p53. The protease is constitutively active in certain tumor cell lines, suggesting that it may also have a function in non-apoptotic conditions. Identification of the MDM2-specific caspase may shed light on the regulation of MDM2 and the apoptotic mechanism of p53. The data presented here suggest that p53 can regulate a proteolytic activity specific for the caspase cleavage site of MDM2, before the onset of apoptosis and activation of other apoptotic caspases. The p53-induced protease activity is less efficient against peptide substrates for caspases 1, 3, and 8, suggesting the presence of a distinct MDM2-specific protease. The ability of this protease to cleave after the aspartic acid residue in the caspase cleavage site of MDM2 (DVPD361), the partial sensitivity to caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, and resistance to conventional serine and cysteine protease inhibitors suggest that it is a caspase. By using the MDM2 cleavage site substrate Ac-DVPD-AMC, we also detected an activity that is present in JAR cells, which constitutively produce cleaved MDM2 (p60) (33Pochampally R. Fodera B. Chen L. Shao W. Levine E.A. Chen J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2629-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this activity is nearly absent from SJSA cells, which lack significant p60 (33Pochampally R. Fodera B. Chen L. Shao W. Levine E.A. Chen J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2629-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In contrast, use of other fluorogenic peptide substrates revealed similar levels of cleavage activities in both cell lines. This further supports the presence of a protease that preferentially targets MDM2. The variability of the MDM2-specific protease activity suggests that it may be a regulatory rather than an effector protease in apoptosis. Thus, JAR cells with a significant level of MDM2 cleavage proliferate normally without committing to apoptosis (33Pochampally R. Fodera B. Chen L. Shao W. Levine E.A. Chen J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2629-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Cleavage after DVPD361 results in the separation of the highly conserved MDM2 C-terminal Ring finger domain from the p53 binding domain. It has been shown that cysteine 464 is important for the ubiquitin ligase activity of MDM2 in vitro (46Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar). p60 does not promote p53 degradation; furthermore, it can function in a dominant-negative fashion to protect p53 from degradation by full-length MDM2. These results suggest that the 362–491 region of MDM2 is an important functional domain for promoting p53 degradation. The C-terminal cleavage fragment also contains the RNA binding activity of MDM2 (30Chen L. Marechal V. Moreau J. Levine A.J. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22966-22973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 47Elenbaas B. Matthias D. Roth J. Shenk T. Levine A.J. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 439-451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which may also be associated with the ability of MDM2 to promote p53 degradation. The ability of p53 to activate an MDM2-specific caspase suggests a signaling pathway for p53-mediated apoptosis. A threshold level of p53 may induce cleavage of MDM2 before commitment to cell death, resulting in a positive feedback effect on p53 level and further activation of the protease. In addition to cleavage of MDM2, the protease may be responsible for subsequently activating the DEVD-reactive caspase, forming signal transduction and amplification cascades that lead to commitment to apoptosis. This model is consistent with the dosage-dependent apoptotic effect of p53 (48Chen X. Ko L.J. Jayaraman L. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2438-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Certain tumor cell lines undergo growth arrest after p53 activation; it will be interesting to determine whether these cells fail to activate the MDM2-cleaving caspase. During apoptosis induced by survival factor withdrawal in the mouse myeloid cell line M1, p53 activity is required for caspase cleavage of pRb (49Gottlieb E. Oren M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The pRb-cleaving caspase can also be activated during the preparation of cytosol (49Gottlieb E. Oren M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, pRb is not cleaved in H1299-Val-138 cells producing p60, or by cytosol prepared from 32 °C H1299-Val-138 cells does not cleave in vitro translated pRb, 2R. Pochampally, B. Fodera, L. Chen, W. Lu, and J. Chen, unpublished observations. suggesting important differences between the caspases involved. The activation of MDM2 and pRb-cleaving caspases may be related events in a p53-regulated pathway; the pRb-cleaving caspase may be activated in a step more proximal to the commitment to apoptosis. In addition to caspase 3, MDM2 is also efficiently cleaved by recombinant caspase 8, suggesting that signaling pathways involving caspase 8 may be able to regulate p53 stability by modification of MDM2. Two cell death-promoting factors that act by activation of caspase 8, i.e. tumor necrosis factor-α and FasL, are known to induce p53 accumulation (50Jeoung D. Tang B. Sonenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18367-18373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 51Donato N.J. Perez M. J. Biol.

All four mammalian IRS proteins contain pleckstrin homology (PH) and phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains at their N termini. However, the molecules diverge in their C-terminal sequences. IRS3 is considerably shorter than IRS1, IRS2, and IRS4, and is predicted to interact with a distinct group of downstream signaling molecules.

The phosphorylation domain of IRS3 is only about half the size of, and shares little if any homology with, IRS1, IRS2, and IRS4. Nevertheless, it has similar tyrosine motifs that can be phosphorylated by the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase in response to insulin stimulation, and subsequently bind to SH2 domains of signaling molecules such as p85, SHP2, and Grb2 (8Lavan B.E.

Cell. 1993; 72: 223-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 28Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar) to investigate the interaction of IRS3 with the insulin receptor, the insulin receptor-related receptor, and the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor and also to downstream SH2 domain-containing signaling proteins. The minimal PTB domain of IRS3 binds relatively weakly to the IR cytoplasmic domain, but the binding was markedly enhanced by the presence of either the PH domain or the phosphorylation domain of IRS3. This interaction is dependent upon the intact NPX(p)Y motif within the juxtamembrane domain of the IR. Deletion of either the PH domain or the PTB domain abolished the in vivo tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS3 by the IR in COS-7 cells. In addition, by fusing the IR kinase domain to the phosphorylation domain of IRS3, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to study the interaction of IRS3 with downstream SH2 domain-containing signaling proteins such as p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, SHP2, Grb2, Nck, and Shc. In this modified yeast two-hybrid system, IRS3 interacts strongly with the SH2 domains of p85, moderately with Grb2, Nck, and the SH2 domains of Shc and SHP2, but only weakly with the SH2 domains of PLCγ1. These interactions required intact kinase activity of the insulin receptor. Moreover, the high affinity binding of IRS3 with p85 required at least two intact YXXM motifs in IRS3 and two tandem SH2 domains in p85. Furthermore, using an immunoprecipitation approach, we showed that insulin stimulated the association of IRS3 with p85, Nck, SHP2, Shc but not with PLCγ1 or Grb2 in COS-7 cells.DISCUSSIONThe yeast two-hybrid system provides a powerful technique to study protein-protein interactions. This system has been applied previously to characterize structure-function relationships of both IRS1 and IRS2, specifically, their interactions with IR and IGF1R (22O'Neill T.J. Craparo A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 16414-16420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We have used a similar approach to define the domains of IRS3 that interact with the insulin receptor, the IGF-1 receptor, and the insulin receptor-related receptor. In addition, we have modified the yeast two-hybrid approach to allow us to study interactions with downstream signaling molecules that interact via their SH2 domains with phosphotyrosine residues in IRS3. The majority of the predictions based upon observations obtained with the yeast two-hybrid system were confirmed by carrying out appropriate studies in mammalian cells.Interactions of IRS3 with Receptor Tyrosine KinasesUsing the yeast two-hybrid system, we demonstrated that the PTB domain of IRS3 (like the PTB domains of IRS1 and IRS2) is essential for binding to the NPX(p)Y motif within the juxtamembrane domain of the insulin receptor in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. However, the isolated minimal PTB domain binds weakly to the IR, and this binding is markedly enhanced by the presence of either the PH domain or the phosphorylation domain. On the other hand, neither the isolated PH domain nor the isolated phosphorylation domain could interact directly with the IR cytoplasmic domain. Since the sequence downstream of the minimal PTB domain in IRS3 has no detectable homology with IRS1, IRS2, or IRS4, we suggest that the PTB domain of IRS3 is the only domain that binds directly to IR. Rather, the effects of both the PH and phosphorylation domains to promote the interaction of PTB domain with the IR may be explained by favorable effects upon either the folding of the fusion protein or the stability of the molecule.As predicted by the yeast two-hybrid system, deletion of the PTB domain prevented insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IRS3 in COS-7 cells (Fig. 3). Furthermore, deletion of the PH domain also inhibited phosphorylation of IRS3. Similar results were reported previously in studies in which the PH domain of IRS1 was deleted or replaced with PH domains derived from proteins other than IRS family members (18Myers Jr., M.G. Grammer T.C. Brooks J. Glasheen E.M. Wang L.M. Sun X.J. Blenis J. Pierce J.H. White M.F.

Thus, both the PH domain and the PTB domain or IRS3 are required for normal phosphorylation of IRS3 by the insulin receptor in mammalian cells.Multiple factors may contribute to determining which IRS molecules are phosphorylated by specific receptor tyrosine kinases. Thus, we compared the strength of the interactions between IRS3 and various members of the insulin receptor family of tyrosine kinases. The interaction of IRS3 was approximately twice as strong with the IR or IGF1R as with IRR. In addition, we compared the strength of the interaction of the IR with IRS1, IRS2, and IRS3. In the yeast two-hybrid system, the interaction of IR with IRS2 or IRS3 was approximately twice as strong as with IRS1. These data are consistent with observations with endogenous IRS proteins in rat adipocytes. Rat adipocyte IRS3 binds more strongly than IRS1 to immobilized peptides containing phosphorylated NPX(p)Y motifs (15Smith-Hall J. Pons S. Patti M.E. Burks D.J. Yenush L. Sun X.J. Kahn C.R. White M.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8304-8310Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Furthermore, IRS3 was phosphorylated more rapidly than IRS1 in rat adipocytes (15Smith-Hall J. Pons S.

It is likely that this discrepancy is accounted for by differences in the level of expression of the two substrates. However, it is possible that other factors (e.g. subcellular localization) might also contribute.Interaction of IRS3 with Downstream Effector MoleculesIt is necessary to modify the yeast two-hybrid system to analyze an interaction between proteins if the interaction requires one of the proteins to undergo post-translational modification (in this case, phosphorylation). For example, in the yeast three-hybrid system (34Keegan K. Cooper J.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1537-1544PubMed Google Scholar,41Osborne M.A. Dalton S. Kochan J.P.

Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1537-1544PubMed Google Scholar). To our knowledge, the yeast three-hybrid system has not been applied to study the interaction of IRS proteins with downstream signaling proteins containing SH2 domains. In the present study, we utilized a modified yeast two-hybrid system. Rather than express a separate tyrosine kinase to phosphorylate the substrate, we fused the phosphorylation domain of IRS3 directly to the IR kinase domain. This chimera was fused to the C terminus of the transcription activation domain LexA to yield a chimeric LexA-IRk-IRS3ctfusion. Both the LexAop-LacZ gene in the p8op-LacZ plasmid vector and the LexAop-LEU2 gene in the yeast EGY48 chromosome allow multiple LexA fusion proteins to bind to the LexA operators simultaneously. This binding results in activation of the IR kinase, possibly by phosphorylation in an intramolecular manner (22O'Neill T.J. Craparo A. Gustafson T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6433-6442Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The activated IR kinase subsequently phosphorylates these tyrosine motifs in IRS3 allowing their binding to the SH2 domain of B42 fusion proteins. Eventually, the transcription of both theLexAop-LEU2 and LexAop-LacZ genes is activated, allowing the yeast cells to grow in leucine-deficient plates and express β-galactosidase activity, respectively.Using this modified yeast two-hybrid system, we demonstrated that tyrosine phosphorylated IRS3 binds to the SH2 domains of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, SHP2, Nck, and Grb2, but not PLC-γ1. This is consistent with other data obtained in mammalian cells obtained in this and other studies (12Lavan B.E. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol.

By substituting Phe for Tyr residues within these YXXM motifs, we demonstrated that at least two intact tandem YXXM motifs in IRS3 were required for high affinity binding to the tandem SH2 domains of p85, and that the individual SH2 domains of p85 alone were not sufficient to bind strongly to wild type IRS3. This is in agreement with the conclusion from other groups that at least two tyrosine phosphorylation sites are necessary to confer high affinity binding of tandem SH2 domains from several signaling molecules such as p85, SHP2, ZAP-70, Syk, and PLCγ1 (38Eck M.J.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9376-9381Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that Tyr361 and Tyr390 in IRS3 confer higher binding affinity for SH2 domains of p85 than Tyr341 and Tyr350, as mutation of either Tyr361 or Tyr390 has a greater adverse impact than mutation of Tyr341 and Tyr350 upon the interaction of IRS3 with the SH2 domains of p85. It is noteworthy that Tyr341 is contained in the sequence YITM (lacking a Met residue at the +1 position). In contrast, Tyr350, Tyr361, and Tyr390 are contained in YMXM motifs that conform to the optimal motif (Y(M/V)XM) to bind the SH2 domain of p85. In addition, Ottinger et al. demonstrated that the spacing between two YXXM motifs is not critical for high affinity binding of tandem SH2 domains in p85. For example, in comparing bisphosphoryl peptides containing two pYXXM motifs, the length of the sequence separating the two pTyr residues did not affect binding to the tandem SH2 domains in p85. Accordingly, we speculate that in the mammalian cells p85 could bind to any pair of YXXM motifs in IRS3 with high affinity, although the relative contribution of each YXXM motifs remains unknown. Given that a large portion of phosphorylated IRS3 binds to p85 in mammalian cells (12Lavan B.E. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol.

Subsequently, these phosphorylated YXXM motifs serve as high affinity sites for the simultaneous binding of tandem p85 SH2 domains.It has been demonstrated that Grb2 can associate with IRS3 in rat adipose cells (14Zhang-Sun G.

Posner B.I. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2649-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). 2The 60-kDa protein in rat hepatoma HTC-IR cells was recently identified as IRS3 by immunological approaches by Dr. G. E. Lienhard's group (personal communication). It has been suggested that Grb2 may bind to a putative binding motif (i.e. Y321VNP) in rat IRS3 (8Lavan B.E. Lane W.S. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11439-11443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Unlike rat IRS3, mouse IRS3 does not possess an obvious motif for binding to Grb2 (9Sciacchitano S. Taylor S.I. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4931-4940Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The corresponding sequence in mouse IRS3 is Y319FKP, which does not conform to the consensus sequence for Grb2 binding. Consistent with the absence of an obvious binding site, insulin did not enhance the interaction of recombinant mIRS3 with Grb2 in COS-7 cells. However, we did detect a weak interaction between Grb2 and IRS3 in cells incubated in the absence of insulin. Because of the presence of proline-rich sequences in IRS3, it seems likely that the insulin-independent interaction may involve the SH3 domain of Grb2. However, it is also possible that insulin-independent tyrosine kinases may have phosphorylated IRS3 at low stoichiometry, and this could explain the low level interaction of IRS3 and Grb2 observed in COS-7 cells in the absence of insulin.SHP2 is a phosphotyrosine phosphatase containing two tandem SH2 domains. Its SH2 domains bind preferentially to phosphotyrosines in (p)Y-hydrophobic-X-hydrophobic motifs, such as Y-(I/V)-X-(V/I/L/P) (35Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G.

The present study demonstrates that plasminogen activator inhibitor type 3 (PAI-3) reversibly inhibits scu-PA in solution, maintaining the system ""off."" Because the scu-PA/PAI-3 interaction is reversible, cellular expression of u-PAR allows partitioning of scu-PA from PAI-3 to u-PAR with resultant expression of full enzymatic activity. PAI-3 that was originally complexed to scu-PA remains in solution, retaining its functional activity. Importantly, the scu-PA on cell surface u-PAR is protected from PAI-3 inhibition, remaining an effective activator in a PAI-rich environment. Plasmin formed as a result of scu-PA activity then cleaves scu-PA to the mature protease, two-chain u-PA (tcu-PA), which is efficiently and irreversibly inhibited by PAI-3 via the standard serpin mechanism, even on u-PAR. This data generates a new hypothesis which, in contrast to the previous paradigm, holds that receptor bound scu-PA is the initiating enzyme and that tcu-PA is generated not to augment enzymatic activity but rather to allow for inhibition and therefore appropriate regulation of the process."

These studies show that protection from inhibition by the transported cation is a general characteristic of the inhibitor-dependent inactivation of these ATPases. Even though the mechanism of inactivation is controversial, the cation specificity and concentration dependence providing protection have frequently been interpreted as evidence for the modification of residues within the cation binding site. A microsequence has now been obtained for several reactive residues in or near transmembrane spanning domains within M5, M7, and M9 of the native H,K-ATPase (45Rabon E.C. Hoggatt M. Smillie K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32137-32146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and Na,K-ATPase (44Goldshleger R. Tal D.M. Moorman J. Stein W.D. Karlish S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Mutational studies of the modified residue and analysis of the expressed Na,K-ATPase have provided evidence to confirm biochemical studies that Glu-779 (NIPE), a DEAC-reactive site, is important for cation-dependent activity (46Arguello J.M.

Res. 1993; 39: 497-507PubMed Google Scholar), is important for Na,K-ATPase activity. Glu-857 (LVNE), a residue at the fourth putative cytosolic-seventh transmembrane spanning region interface (C4–M7) of the gastric H,K-ATPase has been identified as a K+-protected, [14C]DCCD-reactive site (45Rabon E.C. Hoggatt M. Smillie K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32137-32146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). To clarify whether DCCD-dependent inhibition is the result of its modification of an essential residue within the cation binding site of the H,K-ATPase or whether inhibition may result from a secondary effect, such as cross-linkage or cation-dependent protection of a DCCD-reactive site at an alternative locus, a series of site mutants were prepared at this position varying the size, charge, and hydrophobicity of the side chain residue. The site mutants were transiently expressed in HEK293 T cells, and the expressed H,K-ATPase was analyzed to determine the effect of the modifications on the steady-state kinetic constants describing K+-stimulated activation or SCH 28080-dependent inhibition of the ATPase. The results of this investigation demonstrate that Glu-857 is not essential for K+-dependent ATPase activity but do suggest that the C4–M7 domain is an important region involved in the conformational sensitivity of the molecule. Plasmids containing the α-subunit (GenBank accession number X64694) and β-subunit (GenBank accession number M35544) of the rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) gastric H,K-ATPase in the vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) were a kind gift of Dr. George Sachs (Wadsworth Veterans Affairs Medical Center, UCLA). Bidirectional sequence analysis of the 5′ and 3′ regions verified the integrity of the ORF in the end regions of each construct. The β-subunit plasmid, pcDNA3-β, is a 6778-bp construct with its ORF flanked by original 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (UTR) of 27 and 405 base pairs, respectively. The 5′ UTR of the β-subunit is linked to the multiple cloning site of the pcDNA3 vector through a 16-bp sequence (AAT GGG GTA CCG AAT T), and the 3′-UTR is linked by an 11-bp sequence (TTC CTC GAA AT). The α-subunit, pcDNA3-α, is an 8784-bp construct with its ORF flanked by original 5′- and 3′-UTR of 12 and 203 base pairs, respectively. The 5′-end UTR of the α-subunit is linked to the multiple cloning site of the pcDNA3 vector with a 21-bp linker sequence (GGT ACC CAA TTC CTG CAG CCC), and the 3′-UTR is linked with a 24-bp linker sequence (GAT CCA CTA GTT CTA GGG GGA TCC). All site mutations were verified by DNA sequencing performed by the W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University. Sequence analysis was carried out on an Applied Biosystems 373A Stretch DNA Sequencer. The sequencing reactions utilized fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleotides andTaq FS DNA polymerase in a thermal cycling protocol. The submitted samples, containing 750 ng of circularized plasmid DNA and 0.4 μm oligonucleotide sequence primer, yielded approximately 600-bp sequences with >99% accuracy. The sequence primers were constructed either as sense primers complementary to a 25-bp sequence preceding the M5 transmembrane region or as antisense primers complementary to a 21-bp sequence immediately preceding the M8 transmembrane region. Site-directed mutations were introduced into pcDNA3-α via the Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using the manufacture's instructions with modifications. 125 ng of pcDNA3-α was extended in a thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer 2400) for 20 cycles (45 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, 21 min at 68 °C) using 125 ng of both the mutant sense and antisense primers indicated in Table I. Following elongation, the parental strand was digested for a minimum of 1 h at 37 °C with 10 units of DpnI. Competent XL-1 Blue bacterial cells were heat shock-transformed with 1.3 μl of theDpnI-treated extension reaction, plated on LB Amp medium (0.1 mg of ampicillin/ml), and grown overnight at 37 °C. Single colonies devoid of satellites were selected and expanded by growth at 37 °C for 12–24 h in 250 ml of LB Amp medium. The plasmid was isolated using the Wizard Midi-prep kit (Promega). An aliquot of the plasmid DNA was repurified on Qiagen Spin Mini-prep columns and submitted for sequence analysis.Table IMutant primers for site mutants of Glu-857E857Q 5′CGC TTG GTC AAC CAA CCC CTG GCT GCC3′E857A 5′C TTG GTC AAC GCT CCC CTG GCT GCC TA3′E857L 5′GC TTG GTC AAC CTT CCC CTG GCT GCC TA3′E857K 5′C TTG GTC AAC AAA CCC CTG GCT GCC TA3′E857R 5′C TTG GTC AAC CGT CCC CTG GCT GCC TAC TCC T3′Each mutation utilized a primer pair consisting of the sense primers shown below and their identical antisense complements.

HEK293 T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 2.0 mm glutamine, and 0.1 mg/ml penicillin and streptomycin at 37 °C in 95% CO2, 5% O2atmosphere. At confluency, the cells were released by trypsin treatment, uniformly dispersed, and cultured overnight in 100-mm tissue culture dishes. At approximately 60–80% confluency, the cells were washed with serum-free Opti-MEM I supplemented with 0.9 mmCaCl2 and co-transfected with 9 μg of pcDNA3-α and 18 μg of pcDNA3-β. The co-transfection procedure utilized 1.3 μl of LipofectAMINE™/μg of DNA. Following overnight incubation, 20 ml of the standard culture medium was added to the serum-free culture medium, and the cells were grown for an additional 48 h. The transiently co-transfected cells were harvested for membrane preparation at 72 h post-transfection. The transiently transfected cells were washed once with PBS supplemented with 5 mm EDTA and were harvested from the plate following a brief incubation in the same medium. The cells were collected by 5 min of centrifugation at 2000 rpm and resuspended in ice-cold homogenization buffer containing 10 mm Pipes, Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 units/ml bovine lung aprotinin. Membranes were prepared from the cells by Dounce homogenization utilizing a 7-ml vessel and tight fitting pestle. Following a 200-stroke homogenization cycle, the membranes were diluted to a final concentration of 165 mm sucrose with 0.5m sucrose, homogenized a final 10 strokes, and layered on a sucrose column containing 10 mm Pipes, Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 44% sucrose. Membrane fractions were resolved by 1 h of centrifugation in a Beckman SW-28 rotor centrifuged at 22,000 rpm. The membrane fraction obtained from the 44% sucrose interface was diluted 1:2 (v/v) with homogenization buffer and collected in a Beckman Ti-50.2 rotor centrifuged at 34,000 rpm for 20 min. The pellet obtained by this procedure was resuspended in 10 mm Pipes, Tris, pH 7.4, and frozen at −80 °C until assay. Total membrane-bound protein was quantified using the Bio-Rad assay kit with γ-globulin as standard. The quantitative Western analysis was performed on the AMBIS image acquisition and analysis system utilizing an XC-75/75CE CCD video camera module and AMBIS core (ver. 4)/ONE-Dscan software. 35–55-μg aliquots of total membrane protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE run under reducing conditions according to the method of Laemmli (50Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and transferred to nitrocellulose for Western analysis. The gel was resolved by a two-step electrophoresis procedure utilizing 25 mA (constant current) for 20 min and 200 V (constant voltage) for 1 h. The SDS-PAGE-resolved protein was transferred to nitrocellulose for 3 h at 150 mA (constant current). For Western analysis the nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in 1% Carnation instant non-fat dry milk and probed with anti-β mAb 2B-6 (1:10,000) or anti-α mAb 12.18 (1:5,000). The probed membranes were incubated with secondary anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody and developed according to the Amersham protocol. The expressed protein was visualized by a 15-s exposure to ECL Hyperfilm. ATPase activity was measured in membrane preparations of nontransfected (control) and transiently co-transfected HEK293 T cells. Typically, 55 μg of membrane-bound protein was assayed by the method of Yoda and Hokin (51Yoda A. Hokin L.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 40: 880-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) using 1 ml of ATPase reaction buffer containing 2 mm ATP, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm ouabain, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 μg of oligomycin ± 10 mm KCl. The assay was started by the addition of ATP, incubated at 37 °C for 45 min and stopped with the addition of 1 ml of 80% ammonium molybdate, 20% perchloric acid. The expressed H,K-ATPase was differentiated from an indigenous, nonspecific phosphatase by a characteristic SCH 28080-sensitive, KCl-stimulated activity. The reported values for the K 0.5 (KCl) and K i (SCH 28080) were calculated from the global fit of n = 3 measurements from each of three separate transient co-transfection experiments. The steady-state kinetic constants were calculated from the nonlinear best fit to:K 0.5 = V max × [K+]/K 0.5 + [K+] andY = 1/(1 + [SCH 28080]/K i) + nsb (nonspecific). HEK293 T cells were a kind gift of Dr. Jamboor K. Vishwanatha. Anti-β mAb 2B-6 was a kind gift from Dr. M. Maeda, and anti-α mAb 12.18 was a kind gift from Dr. A. Smolka. The sense and antisense mutant and sequencing primers were purchased from Midland Certified Reagents. LipofectAMINE™ was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. The H,K-ATPase of mammalian species is organized as an α/β heterodimer. The porcine α-subunit resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed with H,K-ATPase α-subunit antibody, mAb 12.18, is shown in Fig. 1, upper panel, lane 4. The α-subunit appears as a single band at M r94,000. The β-subunit probed with H,K-ATPase β antibody, mAb 2B-6, is shown in lane 4 of the lower panel of Fig. 1. Because of its extensive glycosylation the β-subunit exhibits a mobility ranging from M r 70,000 to 80,000. Membrane preparations from HK293 T cells transiently transfected with the H,K-ATPase cDNA are shown in the remaining lanes of Fig. 1. As shown in lanes 1 and 2, either the β- or α-subunit is expressed in the HK293 T cells. The cells transiently transfected with the α-subunit express a subunit of comparable mobility to the native H,K-ATPase. There is no evidence of smaller protein fragments suggestive of premature termination of protein synthesis or of enhanced proteolysis of the mature subunit. In contrast to the native H,K-ATPase β-subunit, the expressed H,K-ATPase β-subunit is resolved into four bands ranging fromM r 54,000 to 77,000. This heterogeneity is most likely because of the differential glycosylation of theM r 34,000 core protein of the β-subunit. As expected, because of the individual subunit expression, cells co-transfected with both α- and β-cDNA also co-express both subunits. The co-expression of the α- and β-subunits does not change the profile of β-subunit maturation products from that observed with the expression of the β-subunit alone. The membrane preparation from untransfected cells is shown in lane 5. Neither gastric H,K-ATPase α- or β-subunits are expressed at detectable levels in the untransfected cells. A quantitative measurement of the α- and β-subunits co-expressed in three separate membrane preparations of co-transfected HK293 T cells is shown in Table II. The expressed α-subunit ranged from 3.8 to 7.0 μg with a mean of 5.2 ± 1.6 μg/mg of total membrane protein, whereas the β-subunit ranged from 3.7 to 8 μg with a mean of 5.5 ± 2.3 μg of expressed protein/mg of total membrane protein. The ratio of β- to α-subunit expressed in each membrane preparation ranged from 0.5 to 1.2 (w/w), although the molar ratio of the total β-subunit population was always expressed in excess of the α-subunit.Table IICo-expression of α- and β-subunits in transiently transfected HK293 T cellsPreparationSubunitμg subunit/mg proteinRatio β:α (w/w)TT2α4.81.7β8.0TT3α3.81.2β4.6TT4α7.00.5β3.7α5.2 ± 1.6Summaryβ5.5 ± 2.3HK293 T cells were co-transfected with plasmid DNA constructs containing both α and β H,K-ATPase subunits in three separate experiments. Cell membranes were prepared 72 h post-transfection and probed for subunit expression using monoclonal antibodies to each subunit. Open table in a new tab HK293 T cells were co-transfected with plasmid DNA constructs containing both α and β H,K-ATPase subunits in three separate experiments. Cell membranes were prepared 72 h post-transfection and probed for subunit expression using monoclonal antibodies to each subunit. To investigate the subunit requirement for H,K-ATPase function, the α-subunit was transiently expressed in the presence or absence of the H,K-ATPase β-subunit. The H,K-ATPase activity associated with α-subunit expression with or without the β-subunit is summarized in Fig. 2. As indicated in the first bar of each experimental cluster, all membrane preparations of the HK293 T cells possess a nonspecific nucleotidase activity in the presence of 0.1 mm ouabain and 1 μg of oligomycin (per 55 μg of protein). This normalized activity, reported as 1, ranged from 0.8 to 1.7 μmol/mg/h in four preparations. This basal nucleotidase activity was stimulated approximately 10% by 10 mm KCl and inhibited by 55 μm SCH 28080. This activity profile was not changed with the transient transfection and expression of the α- or β-subunit alone. In contrast, the co-transfection and expression of both subunits significantly increased the K+-stimulated ATPase. The mean normalized K+-stimulated activity reported in Fig. 2 is approximately 50% above that of the untransfected controls. This normalized activity represents an enhanced K+-stimulated ATPase ranging from 0.6 to 1.1 μmol/mg/h in each membrane preparation. As shown, this K+-stimulated component is inhibited by 55 μmSCH 28080. The concentration dependence of the K+-stimulated activation and the SCH 28080-dependent inhibition were measured to provide a comparison of the steady-state kinetic properties of the native gastric H,K-ATPase to that expressed in the membranes of HEK293 T cells. The data from four separate co-transfected cell populations were combined in Fig. 3. The concentration dependence of the K+-stimulated activity is shown in panel A, where the activity is saturable with aK 0.5 of 0.6 ± 0.1 mm KCl.Panel B shows the concentration dependence of the SCH 28080-inhibited component, where the K i is 0.96 ± 0.3 μm. These steady-states kinetic constants resemble those of the native gastric H,K-ATPase reported in Table III.Table IIIKinetic constants for site mutants of Glu-857MutantK i (SCH 28080)K 0.5 (KCl)ΔK+ activityWild type1.0 ± 0.30.6 ± .100.8 ± 0.3Arg6.5 ± 1.40.2 ± .050.8 ± 0.3Lys5.9 ± 1.50.2 ± .031.1 ± 0.5Leu2.4 ± 0.60.4 ± .041.0 ± 0.4Gln1.7 ± 0.30.6 ± .061.2 ± 0.7Ala1.0 ± 0.21.0 ± .131.3 ± 0.5Native H,K-ATPase0.7 ± 0.10.5 ± .25Each constant was obtained from a data set composed of three separate transfected cell membrane preparations with n = 3 replicates of each preparation.
