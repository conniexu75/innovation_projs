https://openalex.org/W2611926684,"Introduction Falls are the leading cause of injury in almost all age-strata in the U.S. However, fall-related injuries (FI) and their circumstances are under-studied at the population level, particularly among young and middle-aged adults. This study examined the circumstances of FI among community-dwelling U.S. adults, by age and gender. Methods Narrative texts of FI from the National Health Interview Survey (1997–2010) were coded using a customized taxonomy to assess place, activity, initiating event, hazards, contributing factors, fall height, and work-relatedness of FI. Weighted proportions and incidence rates of FI were calculated across six age-gender groups (18–44, 45–64, 65+ years; women, men). Results The proportion of FI occurring indoors increased with age in both genders (22%, 30%, and 48% among men, and 40%, 49% and 62% among women for 18–44, 45–64, 65+ age-groups, respectively). In each age group the proportion of indoor FI was higher among women as compared to men. Among women, using the stairs was the second leading activity (after walking) at the time of FI (19%, 14% and 10% for women in 18–44, 45–64, 65+ age groups, respectively). FI associated with tripping increased with age among both genders, and women were more likely to trip than men in every age group. Of all age-gender groups, the rate of FI while using ladders was the highest among middle-aged men (3.3 per 1000 person-year, 95% CI 2.0, 4.5). Large objects, stairs and steps, and surface contamination were the three most common hazards noted for 15%, 14% and 13% of fall-related injuries, respectively. Conclusions The rate and the circumstances of FI differ by age and gender. Understanding these differences and obtaining information about circumstances could be vital for developing effective interventions to prevent falls and FI."

Before they invade roots to complete their life cycle, soil microbes can attach to their cuticle or surface coat and antagonize the nematode directly or by induction of host plant defenses. We investigated whether the nematode-associated microbiome in soil differs between infective stages of Meloidogyne incognita and Pratylenchus penetrans, and whether it is affected by variation in the composition of microbial communities among soils. Nematodes were incubated in suspensions of five organically and two integrated horticultural production soils, recovered by sieving and analyzed for attached bacteria and fungi after washing off loosely adhering microbes. Significant effects of the soil type and nematode species on nematode-associated fungi and bacteria were revealed as analyzed by community profiling using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Attached microbes represented a small specific subset of the soil microbiome. Two organic soils had very similar bacterial and fungal community profiles, but one of them was strongly suppressive towards root-knot nematodes. They were selected for deep amplicon sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes and fungal ITS. Significant differences among the microbiomes associated with the two species in both soils suggested specific surface epitopes. Among the 28 detected bacterial classes, Betaproteobacteria, Bacilli and Actinobacteria were the most abundant. The most frequently detected fungal genera were Malassezia, Aspergillus and Cladosporium. Attached microbiomes did not statistically differ between these two soils. However, Malassezia globosa and four fungal species of the family Plectosphaerellaceae, and the bacterium Neorhizobium galegae were strongly enriched on M. incognita in the suppressive soil. In conclusion, the highly specific attachment of microbes to infective stages of phytonematodes in soil suggested an ecological role of this association and might be involved in soil suppressiveness towards them."
https://openalex.org/W2611822280,"Seed inoculation with plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) is an ideal tool to supply the soil with a high density of beneficial microorganisms. However, maintaining viable microorganisms is a major problem during seed treatment and storage. In this work, an evaluation was made of the effect of bacterial immobilization in nanofibers on the stability (viability and maintenance of beneficial properties) of two potential PGPR, Pantoea agglomerans ISIB55 and Burkholderia caribensis ISIB40. Moreover, the impact of soybean seed coating with nanofiber-immobilized rhizobacteria on bacterial survival during seed storage and on germination and plant growth parameters was determined. Bacterial nanoimmobilization and subsequent seed coating with nanofiber-immobilized rhizobacteria were carried out by electrospinning. The results demonstrate that this technique successfully immobilized P. agglomerans ISIB55 and B. caribensis ISIB40 because it did not affect the viability or beneficial properties of either rhizobacteria. Seed coating with nanofiber-immobilized rhizobacteria improved P. agglomerans ISIB55 and B. caribensis ISIB40 survival on seeds stored for 30 days and contributed to the successful colonization of both bacteria on the plant root. Moreover, seed coating with P. agglomerans ISIB55 increased germination, length and dry weight of the root. Furthermore, seed coating with B. caribensis ISIB40 increased leaf number and dry weight of the shoot. Therefore, the technique applied in the present work to coat seeds with nanofiber-immobilized PGPR could be considered a promising eco-friendly approach to improve soybean production using a microbial inoculant."
https://openalex.org/W2611726537,"Background and objectives Intimate partner violence (IPV) around the time of pregnancy is a serious public health concern and is known to have an adverse effect on perinatal mental health. In order to craft appropriate and effective interventions, it is important to understand how the association between IPV and postpartum depression (PPD) may differ as a function of the type and timing of IPV victimization. Here we evaluate the influence of physical, sexual and psychological IPV before, during and after pregnancy on PPD. Methods Cross-sectional survey data was collected between October 2015 and January 2016 in the Chandpur District of Bangladesh from 426 new mothers, aged 15–49 years, who were in the first six months postpartum. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate the association between IPV and PPD, adjusted for socio-demographic, reproductive and psychosocial confounding factors. Results Approximately 35.2% of women experienced PPD within the first six months following childbirth. Controlling for confounders, the odds of PPD was significantly greater among women who reported exposure to physical (AOR: 1.79, 95% CI [1.25, 3.43]), sexual (AOR: 2.25, 95% CI [1.14, 4.45]) or psychological (AOR: 6.92, 95% CI [1.71, 28.04]) IPV during pregnancy as opposed to those who did not. However, both before and after pregnancy, only physical IPV evidences a direct effect on PPD. Results highlight the mental health consequences of IPV for women of Bangladesh, as well as the influence of timing and type of IPV on PPD outcomes. Conclusions and implications The findings confirm that exposure to IPV significantly increases the odds of PPD. The association is particularly strong for physical IPV during all periods and psychological IPV during pregnancy. Results reinforce the need to conduct routine screening during pregnancy to identify women with a history of IPV who may at risk for PPD and to offer them necessary support."
https://openalex.org/W2610533974,"Background & aims Abdominal symptoms (AS) are a hallmark of the multiorgan-disease cystic fibrosis (CF). However, the abdominal involvement in CF is insufficiently understood and, compared to the pulmonary manifestation, still receives little scientific attention. Aims were to assess and quantify AS and to relate them to laboratory parameters, clinical findings, and medical history. Methods A total of 131 patients with CF of all ages were assessed with a new CF-specific questionnaire (JenAbdomen-CF score 1.0) on abdominal pain and non-pain symptoms, disorders of appetite, eating, and bowel movements as well as symptom-related quality of life. Results were metrically dimensioned and related to abdominal manifestations, history of surgery, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus colonization, genotype, liver enzymes, antibiotic therapy, lung function, and nutritional status. Results AS during the preceding 3 months were reported by all of our patients. Most common were lack of appetite (130/131) and loss of taste (119/131) followed by abdominal pain (104/131), flatulence (102/131), and distention (83/131). Significantly increased AS were found in patients with history of rectal prolapse (p = 0.013), distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (p = 0.013), laparotomy (p = 0.022), meconium ileus (p = 0.037), pancreas insufficiency (p = 0.042), or small bowel resection (p = 0.048) as well as in patients who have been intermittently colonized with P. aeruginosa (p = 0.006) compared to patients without history of these events. In contrast, no statistically significant associations were found to CF-associated liver disease, chronic pathogen colonization, lung function, CF-related diabetes, and nutritional status. Conclusion As the complex abdominal involvement in CF is still not fully understood, the assessment of the common AS is of major interest. In this regard, symptom questionnaires like the herein presented are meaningful and practical tools facilitating a wider understanding of the abdominal symptoms in CF. Furthermore, they render to evaluate possible abdominal effects of novel modulators of the underlying cystic fibrosis transmembrane (conductance) regulator (CFTR) defect."
https://openalex.org/W2610733923,"Following heavy precipitation, we observed an intense algal bloom in the St. Lawrence Estuary (SLE) that coincided with an unusually high mortality of several species of marine fish, birds and mammals, including species designated at risk. The algal species was identified as Alexandrium tamarense and was determined to contain a potent mixture of paralytic shellfish toxins (PST). Significant levels of PST were found in the liver and/or gastrointestinal contents of several carcasses tested as well as in live planktivorous fish, molluscs and plankton samples collected during the bloom. This provided strong evidence for the trophic transfer of PST resulting in mortalities of multiple wildlife species. This conclusion was strengthened by the sequence of mortalities, which followed the drift of the bloom along the coast of the St. Lawrence Estuary. No other cause of mortality was identified in the majority of animals examined at necropsy. Reports of marine fauna presenting signs of neurological dysfunction were also supportive of exposure to these neurotoxins. The event reported here represents the first well-documented case of multispecies mass mortality of marine fish, birds and mammals linked to a PST-producing algal bloom."
https://openalex.org/W2610948095,"Despite growing interest in developing ecological assessment of difficulties in patients with Alzheimer's disease new methods assessing the cognitive difficulties related to functional activities are missing. To complete current evaluation, the use of Serious Games can be a promising approach as it offers the possibility to recreate a virtual environment with daily living activities and a precise and complete cognitive evaluation. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the usability and the screening potential of a new ecological tool for assessment of cognitive functions in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Eighteen patients with Alzheimer's disease and twenty healthy controls participated to the study. They were asked to complete six daily living virtual tasks assessing several cognitive functions: three navigation tasks, one shopping task, one cooking task and one table preparation task following a one-day scenario. Usability of the game was evaluated through a questionnaire and through the analysis of the computer interactions for the two groups. Furthermore, the performances in terms of time to achieve the task and percentage of completion on the several tasks were recorded. Results indicate that both groups subjectively found the game user friendly and they were objectively able to play the game without computer interactions difficulties. Comparison of the performances between the two groups indicated a significant difference in terms of percentage of achievement of the several tasks and in terms of time they needed to achieve the several tasks. This study suggests that this new Serious Game based assessment tool is a user-friendly and ecological method to evaluate the cognitive abilities related to the difficulties patients can encounter in daily living activities and can be used as a screening tool as it allowed to distinguish Alzheimer's patient's performance from healthy controls."
https://openalex.org/W2611081487,"Protein aggregation is a long-standing problem for preservation of proteins in both laboratory settings and for commercial biotechnology products. It is well established that heating (cooling) can accelerate (slow) aggregation by populating (depopulating) unfolded or partially unfolded monomer states that are key intermediates in aggregation processes. However, there is a long-standing question of whether the same mechanism(s) that lead to aggregation under high-temperature stress are relevant for low-temperature stress such as in refrigerated or supercooled liquids. This report shows the first direct comparison of ""hot"" and ""cold"" aggregation kinetics and folding/unfolding thermodynamics, using bovine hemoglobin as a model system. The results suggest that the same mechanism for non-native aggregation holds from ""hot"" to ""cold"" temperatures, with an aggregation temperature-of-maximum-stability slightly below 0°C. This highlights that sub-zero temperatures can induce cold-mediated aggregation, even in the absence of freezing stresses. From a practical perspective, the results suggests the possibility that cold-stress may be a useful alternative to heat-stress for extrapolating predictions of protein shelf life at refrigerated conditions, as well as providing a foundation for more mechanistic studies of cold-stress conditions in future work. A comparison between isochoric and isobaric methods is also briefly discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2610632209,"Early childhood inorganic arsenic (i-As) exposure is of particular concern since it may adversely impact on lifetime health outcomes. Infants' urinary arsenic (As) metabolites were analysed in 79 infants by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometric detection (IC-ICP-MS) to evaluate i-As exposure pre- and post-weaning. Levels of i-As in rice-based weaning and infants' foods were also determined to relate to urinary As levels. Higher As levels, especially of monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), were found in urine from formula fed infants compared to those breastfed. Urine from infants post-weaning consuming rice-products resulted in higher urinary MMA and DMA compared to the paired pre-weaning urine samples. The European Union (EU) has regulated i-As in rice since 1st January 2016. Comparing infants' rice-based foods before and after this date, little change was found. Nearly ¾ of the rice-based products specifically marketed for infants and young children contained i-As over the 0.1 mg/kg EU limit. Efforts should be made to provide low i-As rice and rice-based products consumed by infants and young children that do not exceed the maximum i-As level to protect this vulnerable subpopulation."
https://openalex.org/W2521335480,"This empirical study sheds light on the spatial correlation of traffic links under different traffic regimes. We mimic the behavior of real traffic by pinpointing the spatial correlation between 140 freeway traffic links in a major sub-network of the Minneapolis-St. Paul freeway system with a grid-like network topology. This topology enables us to juxtapose the positive and negative correlation between links, which has been overlooked in short-term traffic forecasting models. To accurately and reliably measure the correlation between traffic links, we develop an algorithm that eliminates temporal trends in three dimensions: (1) hourly dimension, (2) weekly dimension, and (3) system dimension for each link. The spatial correlation of traffic links exhibits a stronger negative correlation in rush hours, when congestion affects route choice. Although this correlation occurs mostly in parallel links, it is also observed upstream, where travelers receive information and are able to switch to substitute paths. Irrespective of the time-of-day and day-of-week, a strong positive correlation is witnessed between upstream and downstream links. This correlation is stronger in uncongested regimes, as traffic flow passes through consecutive links more quickly and there is no congestion effect to shift or stall traffic. The extracted spatial correlation structure can augment the accuracy of short-term traffic forecasting models."
https://openalex.org/W2610401426,"To determine associations between features of osteoarthritis (OA) on MRI and knee pain severity and knee pain progression.Baseline, 3.3- and 7.5-year assessments were performed for 122 subjects with baseline knee pain (age 40-79), sample-weighted for population (with knee pain) representativeness. MRIs were scored for: osteophytes (0:absent to 3:large); cartilage (0:normal to 4:full thickness defect; 0/1 collapsed); subchondral sclerosis (0:none to 3:>50% of site), subchondral cyst (0:absent to 3:severe), bone marrow lesions (0:none to 3:≥50% of site); and meniscus (0:normal to 3:maceration/resection), in 6-8 regions each. Per feature, scores were averaged across regions. Effusion/synovitis (0:absent to 3:severe) was analyzed as ≥2 vs. <2. Linear models predicted WOMAC knee pain severity (0-100), and binary models predicted 10+ (minimum perceptible clinical improvement [MPCI]) and 20+ (minimum clinically important difference [MCID]) increases. Models were adjusted for age, sex, BMI (and follow-up time for longitudinal models).Pain severity was associated with osteophytes (7.17 per unit average; 95% CI = 3.19, 11.15) and subchondral sclerosis (11.03; 0.68, 21.39). MPCI-based pain increase was associated with osteophytes (odds ratio per unit average 3.20; 1.36, 7.55), subchondral sclerosis (5.69; 1.06, 30.44), meniscal damage (1.68; 1.08, 2.61) and effusion/synovitis ≥2 (2.25; 1.07, 4.71). MCID-based pain increase was associated with osteophytes (3.79; 1.41, 10.20) and cartilage defects (2.42; 1.24, 4.74).Of the features investigated, only osteophytes were consistently associated with pain cross-sectionally and longitudinally in all models. This suggests an important role of bone in early knee osteoarthritis."
https://openalex.org/W2611802513,"We recently demonstrated that short-term estradiol (E2) treatment improved insulin-mediated suppression of lipolysis in postmenopausal women, but to a greater extent in those who were late compared to early postmenopausal. In this follow-up study we tested whether subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) expression of estrogen receptors (ER) α and β differs between early and late postmenopausal women. We further tested whether the balance of ERα to ERβ in SAT determined the effect of E2 on SAT insulin sensitivity. The present study included 35 women who were ≤6 years past menopause (EPM; n = 16) or ≥10 years past menopause (LPM; n = 19). Fasted SAT samples were taken following 1-week transdermal E2 treatment or placebo (PL) in a random cross-over design. Samples were analyzed for nuclear/cytosolic protein content and mRNA expression using Western blot and qPCR, respectively. While ESR1 increased slightly (~1.4-fold) following E2 treatment in both groups, ERα and ERβ protein expression did not differ between groups at baseline or in response to E2. However, the balance of ERα/ERβ protein in the SAT nuclear fraction increased 10% in EPM compared to a 25% decrease in LPM women (group x treatment interaction, p<0.05). A greater proportion of ERα/ERβ protein in the nuclear fraction of SAT at baseline (placebo day) was associated with greater reduction in SAT insulin resistance (i.e., better suppression of lipolysis, EC50) in response to E2 (r = -0.431, p<0.05). In conclusion, there do not appear to be differences in the proportion of adipose tissue ERα/ERβ protein in late, compared to early, postmenopausal women. However, the balance of ERα/ERβ may be important for E2-mediated improvement in adipose tissue insulin sensitivity. Trial Registration: Clinical Trials#: NCT01605071"
https://openalex.org/W2610885554,"This paper models the prevalence of antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi in domestic dogs in the United States using climate, geographic, and societal factors. We then use this model to forecast the prevalence of antibodies to B. burgdorferi in dogs for 2016. The data available for this study consists of 11,937,925 B. burgdorferi serologic test results collected at the county level within the 48 contiguous United States from 2011-2015. Using the serologic data, a baseline B. burgdorferi antibody prevalence map was constructed through the use of spatial smoothing techniques after temporal aggregation; i.e., head-banging and Kriging. In addition, several covariates purported to be associated with B. burgdorferi prevalence were collected on the same spatio-temporal granularity, and include forestation, elevation, water coverage, temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, population density, and median household income. A Bayesian spatio-temporal conditional autoregressive (CAR) model was used to analyze these data, for the purposes of identifying significant risk factors and for constructing disease forecasts. The fidelity of the forecasting technique was assessed using historical data, and a Lyme disease forecast for dogs in 2016 was constructed. The correlation between the county level model and baseline B. burgdorferi antibody prevalence estimates from 2011 to 2015 is 0.894, illustrating that the Bayesian spatio-temporal CAR model provides a good fit to these data. The fidelity of the forecasting technique was assessed in the usual fashion; i.e., the 2011-2014 data was used to forecast the 2015 county level prevalence, with comparisons between observed and predicted being made. The weighted (to acknowledge sample size) correlation between 2015 county level observed prevalence and 2015 forecasted prevalence is 0.978. A forecast for the prevalence of B. burgdorferi antibodies in domestic dogs in 2016 is also provided. The forecast presented from this model can be used to alert veterinarians in areas likely to see above average B. burgdorferi antibody prevalence in dogs in the upcoming year. In addition, because dogs and humans can be exposed to ticks in similar habitats, these data may ultimately prove useful in predicting areas where human Lyme disease risk may emerge."
https://openalex.org/W2611244541,"Most patients with early stage triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Activation of the immune system is associated with tumor response and may help identify TNBC with favorable outcome.Gene expression data were obtained from the GEO Dataset GDS2250/GSE3744. Affymetrix CEL files were downloaded and analyzed with Affymetrix Transcriptome Analysis Console 3.0. Functional genomics was implemented with David Bioinformatics Resources 6.8. Data contained at Oncomine were used to identify genes upregulated in basal-like cancer compared to normal breast tissue. Data contained at cBioportal were used to assess for molecular alterations. The KMPlotter online tool, METABRIC and GSE25066 datasets were used to associate gene signatures with clinical outcome.1564 upregulated genes were identified as differentially expressed between normal and basal-like tumors. Of these, 16 genes associated with immune function were linked with clinical outcome. HLA-C, HLA-F, HLA-G and TIGIT were associated with both improved relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). The combination of HLA-F/TIGIT and HLA-C/HLA-F/TIGIT showed the most favorable outcome (HR for RFS 0.44, p<0.001; HR for OS 0.22, p<0.001; and HR for RFS 0.46, p<0.001; HR for OS 0.15, p<0.001; respectively). The association of HLA-C/HLA-F with outcome was confirmed using the METABRIC and GSE25066 datasets. No copy number alterations of these genes were identified.We describe a gene signature associated with immune function and favorable outcome in basal-like breast cancer. Incorporation of this signature in prospective studies may help to stratify risk of early stage TNBC."
https://openalex.org/W2611938649,"In the present study, a novel breeding strategy of atmospheric and room temperature plasma (ARTP) mutagenesis was used to improve the uridine production of engineered Bacillus subtilis TD12np. A high-throughput screening method was established using both resistant plates and 96-well microplates to select the ideal mutants with diverse phenotypes. Mutant F126 accumulated 5.7 and 30.3 g/L uridine after 30 h in shake-flask and 48 h in fed-batch fermentation, respectively, which represented a 4.4- and 8.7-fold increase over the parent strain. Sequence analysis of the pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthetic operon in the representative mutants showed that proline 1016 and glutamate 949 in the large subunit of B. subtilis carbamoyl phosphate synthetase were of importance for the allosteric regulation caused by uridine 5'-monophosphate. The proposed mutation method with efficient high-throughput screening assay was proved to be an appropriate strategy to obtain uridine-overproducing strain."
https://openalex.org/W2610374281,"Right heart failure is the major cause of death among patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Understanding the biology of the right ventricle (RV) should help developing new therapeutic strategies. Rats subjected to the injection of Sugen5416 (an inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor) plus the ovalbumin immunization had increased pulmonary arterial pressure and severe vascular remodeling. RVs of these rats were hypertrophied and had severe cardiac fibrosis. No apoptosis was, however, detected. Metabolomics analysis revealed that oxidized glutathione, xanthine and uric acid had increased in PAH RVs, suggesting the production of reactive oxygen species by xanthine oxidase. PAH RVs were also found to have a 30-fold lower level of α-tocopherol nicotinate, consistent with oxidative stress decreasing antioxidants and also demonstrating for the first time that the nicotinate ester of vitamin E is endogenously expressed. Oxidative/nitrosative protein modifications including S-glutathionylation, S-nitrosylation and nitrotyrosine formation, but not protein carbonylation, were found to be increased in RVs of rats with PAH. Mass spectrometry identified that S-nitrosylated proteins include heat shock protein 90 and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase. These results demonstrate that RV failure is associated with the promotion of specific oxidative and nitrosative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2611193131,"Diffuse axonal injury is a hallmark pathological consequence of non-penetrative traumatic brain injury (TBI) and yet the axonal responses to stretch injury are not fully understood at the cellular level. Here, we investigated the effects of mild (5%), very mild (0.5%) and repetitive very mild (2×0.5%) axonal stretch injury on primary cortical neurons using a recently developed compartmentalized in vitro model. We found that very mild and mild levels of stretch injury resulted in the formation of smaller growth cones at the tips of axons and a significantly higher number of collapsed structures compared to those present in uninjured cultures, when measured at both 24 h and 72 h post injury. Immunocytochemistry studies revealed that at 72 h following mild injury the axonal growth cones had a significantly higher colocalization of βIII tubulin and F-actin and higher percentage of collapsed morphology than those present following a very mild injury. Interestingly, cultures that received a second very mild stretch injury, 24 h after the first insult, had a further increased proportion of growth cone collapse and increased βIII tubulin and F-actin colocalization, compared with a single very mild injury at 72 h PI. In addition, our results demonstrated that microtubule stabilization of axons using brain penetrant Epothilone D (EpoD) (100 nM) resulted in a significant reduction in the number of fragmented axons following mild injury. Collectively, these results suggest that mild and very mild stretch injury to a very localized region of the cortical axon is able to trigger a degenerative response characterized by growth cone collapse and significant abnormal cytoskeletal rearrangement. Furthermore, repetitive very mild stretch injury significantly exacerbated this response. Results suggest that axonal degeneration following stretch injury involves destabilization of the microtubule cytoskeleton and hence treatment with EpoD reduced fragmentation. Together, these results contribute a better understanding of the pathogenesis of mild and repetitive TBI and highlight the therapeutic effect of microtubule targeted drugs on distal part of neurons using a compartmentalized culturing model."
https://openalex.org/W2611922706,"Background Illness-related absenteeism is a major threat to work productivity. Our objective was to assess the relationship between physical activity and unplanned illness-related absenteeism from work. Methods We implemented physical activity program for sedentary non-clinician employees of a tertiary medical center. Financial rewards were available for reaching accelerometer-measured ambulatory physical activity goals over a 24-week period. We categorized participants into three groups based on mean levels of physical activity: low (0–74 min/week), medium (75–149 min/week) and meeting CDC guidelines (≥150 min/week). We built a multivariable Poisson regression model to evaluate the relationship between physical activity and rates of unplanned illness-related absenteeism. Results The sample consisted of 292 employees who participated in the program. Their mean age was 38 years (SD 11), 83% were female, and 38% were obese. Over the 24 intervention weeks, participants engaged in a mean of 90 min/week (SD 74) of physical activity and missed a mean of 14 hours of work (SD 38) due to illness. Unplanned absenteeism due to illness was associated with physical activity. As compared to the group meeting CDC guidelines, in multivariable analyses those in the medium physical activity group had a 2.4 (95% CI 1.3–4.5) fold higher rate of illness-related absenteeism and those in the lowest physical activity group had a 3.5 (95% CI 1.7–7.2) fold higher rate of illness-related absenteeism. Discussion Less physical activity was associated with more illness-related absenteeism. Workforce-based interventions to increase physical activity may thus be a promising vehicle to reduce unplanned illness-related absenteeism."
https://openalex.org/W2610743221,"Background Reactive oxygen species modulator-1 (Romo1) is a novel protein that has been reported to be crucial for cancer cell proliferation and invasion. However, its clinical implications in colorectal cancer patients are not well-known. For the first time, we investigated the association between Romo1 and the clinical outcomes of colorectal cancer patients. Study We examined Romo1 expression in resected tumor tissues immunohistochemically and assessed it with histological scores. We conducted survival analyses for patients who had curative resection (n = 190) in accordance with clinical parameters including level of Romo1 expression, and we examined the association between Romo1 expression and cell invasion using Matrigel invasion assay in colorectal cancer cells. Results We observed significantly longer mean disease-free survival in the low Romo1 group compared with the high Romo1 group (161 vs 127.6 months, p = 0.035), and the median overall survival of the low Romo1 group was significantly longer than that of the high Romo1 group (196.9 vs 171.3 months, p = 0.036). Cell invasiveness decreased in the Romo1 knockdown colorectal cancer cells in contrast to the controlled cells. Romo1 overexpression in tumor tissue was associated with a high lymph node ratio between the metastatic and examined lymph nodes (p = 0.025). Conclusions Romo1 overexpression in tumor tissue was significantly associated with survival in curatively resected colorectal cancer patients, suggesting Romo1 expression as a potential adverse prognostic marker. Increased Romo1 expression was found to be associated with high lymph node ratio. Cancer invasiveness appeared to be a key reason for the poor survival related to highly expressed Romo1."
https://openalex.org/W2611718962,"In promiscuous species, male reproductive success depends on their ability to mate with fertile females and on the fertilizing ability of their sperm. In such species, theory predicts that, owing to a trade-off between pre- and post-copulatory reproductive traits, males with lesser access to females should increase resource investment into those sperm traits that enhance fertilization success-usually referred to as ejaculate quality. This prediction has been validated in several taxa, yet studies on the physiological mechanisms modulating ejaculate quality are lacking. Sperm cells are highly vulnerable to oxidative stress, which impairs male fertility. Therefore, males that better protect their sperm from oxidative stress are expected to achieve higher ejaculate quality. Based on theoretical expectations, and since social dominance is a major determinant of mating opportunity, we predicted that subordinate males should invest more into the antioxidant protection of their sperm in order to achieve higher ejaculate quality. We maintained 60 male and 60 female wild-caught house sparrows Passer domesticus in outdoor aviaries, where we experimentally manipulated male social status to test our predictions. We measured cellular oxidative stress and enzymatic antioxidant activity in blood and sperm both before and after manipulating social ranks. Before manipulating the social status, we found that ejaculate viability correlated with oxidative stress level in sperm, with dominant males producing more oxidized and less viable ejaculates. Further, males at the lower end of the hierarchy produced ejaculates of similar quality to those of dominant males, suggesting that restricted access to resources might limit male reproductive strategies. After experimentally manipulating the social status, males matched their ejaculate quality to their new rank, while increases in antioxidant investment into ejaculates paralleled increases in ejaculate viability. Oxidative stress has been proposed as a general constraint to the evolution of life histories.

Previous implementations of dbOTU presented challenges for users. Here we introduce and evaluate a new implementation of dbOTU that is faster and more user-friendly. We show that this new implementation has theoretical and practical improvements over previous implementations of dbOTU, making the algorithm more accessible to microbial ecology and biomedical researchers."
https://openalex.org/W2611737950,"The Ovine spine is an accepted model to investigate the biomechanical behaviour of the human lumbar one. Indeed, the use of animal models for in vitro studies is necessary to investigate the mechanical behaviour of biological tissue, but needs to be reduced for ethical and social reasons. The aim of this study was to create a finite element model of the lumbar intervertebral disc of the sheep that may help to refine the understanding of parallel in vitro experiments and that can be used to predict when mechanical failure occurs. Anisotropic hyperelastic material properties were assigned to the annulus fibrosus and factorial optimization analyses were performed to find out the optimal parameters of the ground substance and of the collagen fibers. For the ground substance of the annulus fibrosus the investigation was based on experimental data taken from the literature, while for the collagen fibers tensile tests on annulus specimens were conducted. Flexibility analysis in flexion-extension, lateral bending and axial rotation were conducted. Different material properties for the anterior, lateral and posterior regions of the annulus were found. The posterior part resulted the stiffest region in compression whereas the anterior one the stiffest region in tension. Since the flexibility outcomes were in a good agreement with the literature data, we considered this model suitable to be used in conjunction with in vitro and in vivo tests to investigate the mechanical behaviour of the ovine lumbar disc."
https://openalex.org/W2611057333,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the evolution of ground reaction force during alpine skiing turns. Specifically, this study investigated how turn phases and slope steepness affected the whole foot normal GRF pattern while performing giant slalom turns in a race-like setting. Moreover, the outside foot was divided into different plantar regions to see whether those parameters affected the plantar pressure distribution. Eleven skiers performed one giant slalom course at race intensity. Runs were recorded synchronously using a video camera in the frontal plane and pressure insoles under both feet's plantar surface. Turns were divided according to kinematic criteria into four consecutive phases: initiation, steering1, steering2 and completion; both steering phases being separated by the gate passage. Component of the averaged Ground Reaction Force normal to the ski's surface([Formula: see text], /BW), and Pressure Time Integral relative to the entire foot surface (relPTI, %) parameters were calculated for each turn phases based on plantar pressure data. Results indicated that [Formula: see text] under the total foot surface differed significantly depending on the slope (higher in steep sections vs. flat sections), and the turn phase (higher during steering2 vs. three other phases), although such modifications were observable only on the outside foot. Moreover, [Formula: see text] under the outside foot was significantly greater than under the inside foot.RelPTI under different foot regions of the outside foot revealed a global shift from forefoot loading during initiation phase, toward heel loading during steering2 phase, but this was dependent on the slope studied. These results suggest a differentiated role played by each foot in alpine skiing turns: the outside foot has an active role in the turning process, while the inside foot may only play a role in stability."
https://openalex.org/W2611785589,"Magnetic hyperthermia ablation has attracted wide attention in tumor therapy for its minimal invasion. Although the chemo-hyperthermal synergism has been proven to be effective in subcutaneously xenografted tumors of nude mice in our previous experiment, the occurrence of residual tumors due to incomplete ablation is more common in relatively larger and deeper-seated tumors in anti-tumor therapy. Thus, a larger tumor and larger animal model are needed for further study of the therapeutic efficacy. In this study, we tested the efficiency of this newly developed technique using a rabbit tumor model. Furthermore, we chose cisplatin (DDP), which has been confirmed with high efficiency in enhancing hyperthermia therapy as the chemotherapeutic drug for the synergistic magnetic hyperthermal ablation therapy of tumors. In vitro studies demonstrated that developed DDP-loaded magnetic implants (DDP/PLGA-Fe3O4) have great heating efficacy and the drug release can be significantly boosted by an external alternating magnetic field (AMF). In vivo studies showed that the phase-transitional DDP/PLGA-Fe3O4 materials that are ultrasound (US) and computerized tomography (CT) visible can be well confined in the tumor tissues after injection. When exposed to AMF, efficient hyperthermia was induced, which led to the cancer cells’ coagulative necrosis and accelerating release of the drug to kill residual tumors. Furthermore, an activated anti-tumor immune system can promote apoptosis of tumor cells. In conclusion, the DDP/PLGA-Fe3O4 implants can be used efficiently for the combined chemotherapy and magnetic-hyperthermia ablation of rabbit tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2611020239,"Sanitation of environmental surfaces with chlorine based-disinfectants is a principal measure to control outbreaks of norovirus or Clostridium difficile. The microbicidal activity of chlorine-based disinfectants depends on the free available chlorine (FAC), but their oxidative potential is rapidly eliminated by organic matter. In this study, the microbicidal activities of weakly acidified chlorous acid water (WACAW) and sodium hypochlorite solution (NaClO) against feline calcivirus (FCV) and C. difficile spores were compared in protein-rich conditions. WACAW inactivated FCV and C. difficile spores better than NaClO under all experimental conditions used in this study. WACAW above 100 ppm FAC decreased FCV >4 log10 within 30 sec in the presence of 0.5% each of bovine serum albumin (BSA), polypeptone or meat extract. Even in the presence of 5% BSA, WACAW at 600 ppm FAC reduced FCV >4 log10 within 30 sec. Polypeptone inhibited the virucidal activity of WACAW against FCV more so than BSA or meat extract. WACAW at 200 ppm FAC decreased C. difficile spores >3 log10 within 1 min in the presence of 0.5% polypeptone. The microbicidal activity of NaClO was extensively diminished in the presence of organic matter. WACAW recovered its FAC to the initial level after partial neutralization by sodium thiosulfate, while no restoration of the FAC was observed in NaClO. These results indicate that WACAW is relatively stable under organic matter-rich conditions and therefore may be useful for treating environmental surfaces contaminated by human excretions."
https://openalex.org/W2611657032,"Objectives To compare the efficacy and safety of poractant alfa and bovine lipid extract surfactant in preterm infants. Study design Randomized, partially-blinded, multicenter trial. Infants <32 weeks needing surfactant before 48 hours were randomly assigned to receive poractant alfa or bovine lipid extract surfactant. The primary outcome was being alive and extubated at 48 hours post-randomization. Secondary outcomes included need for re-dosing, duration of respiratory support and oxygen, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, mortality and complications during administration. Results Three centers recruited 87 infants (mean 26.7 weeks and 906 grams) at a mean age of 5.9 hours, between March 2013 and December 2015. 21/42 (50%) were alive and extubated at 48 hours in the poractant alfa group vs 26/45 (57.8%) in the bovine lipid extract surfactant group; adjusted OR 0.76 (95% CI 0.30–1.93) (p = 0.56). No differences were observed in the need to re-dose. Duration of oxygen support (41.5 vs 62 days; adjusted OR 1.69 95% CI 1.02–2.80; p = 0.04) was reduced in infants who received poractant alfa. We observed a trend in bronchopulmonary dysplasia among survivors (51.5% vs 72.1%; adjusted OR 0.35 95%CI 0.12–1.04; p = 0.06) favoring poractant alfa. Twelve infants died before discharge, 9 in the poractant alfa group and 3 in the bovine lung extract group. Severe airway obstruction following administration was observed in 0 (poractant alfa) and 5 (bovine lipid extract surfactant) infants (adjusted OR 0.09 95%CI <0.01–1.27; p = 0.07). Conclusion No statistically significant difference was observed in the proportion of infants alive and extubated within 48h between the two study groups. Poractant alfa may be more beneficial and associated with fewer complications than bovine lipid extract surfactant. However, we observed a trend towards higher mortality in the poractant alfa group. Larger studies are needed to determine whether observed possible benefits translate in shorter hospital admissions, or other long term benefits and determine whether there is a difference in mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2611228738,"In order to grow and spread tumors need to interact with adjacent tissues. We therefore hypothesized that small but aggressive prostate cancers influence the rest of the prostate and regional lymph nodes differently than tumors that are more indolent. Poorly metastatic (Dunning AT1) or highly metastatic (Dunning MLL) rat prostate tumor cells were injected into the ventral prostate lobe of immunocompetent rats. After 10 days—when the tumors occupied about 30% of the prostate lobe and lymph node metastases were undetectable—the global gene expression in tumors, benign parts of the prostate, and regional iliac lymph nodes were examined to define tumor-induced changes related to preparation for future metastasis. The tumors induced profound effects on the gene expression profiles in the benign parts of the prostate and these were strikingly different in the two tumor models. Gene ontology enrichment analysis suggested that tumors with high metastatic capacity were more successful than less metastatic tumors in inducing tumor-promoting changes and suppressing anti-tumor immune responses in the entire prostate. Some of these differences such as altered angiogenesis, nerve density, accumulation of T-cells and macrophages were verified by immunohistochemistry. Gene expression alterations in the regional lymph nodes suggested decreased quantity and activation of immune cells in MLL-lymph nodes that were also verified by immunostaining. In summary, even when small highly metastatic prostate tumors can affect the entire tumor-bearing organ and pre-metastatic lymph nodes differently than less metastatic tumors. When the kinetics of these extratumoral influences (by us named TINT = tumor instructed normal tissue) are more precisely defined they could potentially be used as markers of disease aggressiveness and become therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2611498382,"Recently, dibenzylurea-based potent soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitors were identified in Pentadiplandra brazzeana, a plant in the order Brassicales. In an effort to generalize the concept, we hypothesized that plants that produce benzyl glucosinolates and corresponding isothiocyanates also produce these dibenzylurea derivatives. Our overall aim here was to examine the occurrence of urea derivatives in Brassicales, hoping to find biologically active urea derivatives from plants. First, plants in the order Brassicales were analyzed for the presence of 1, 3-dibenzylurea (compound 1), showing that three additional plants in the order Brassicales produce the urea derivatives. Based on the hypothesis, three dibenzylurea derivatives with sEH inhibitory activity were isolated from maca (Lepidium meyenii) roots. Topical application of one of the identified compounds (compound 3, human sEH IC50 = 222 nM) effectively reduced pain in rat inflammatory pain model, and this compound was bioavailable after oral administration in mice. The biosynthetic pathway of these urea derivatives was investigated using papaya (Carica papaya) seed as a model system. Finally, a small collection of plants from the Brassicales order was grown, collected, extracted and screened for sEH inhibitory activity. Results show that several plants of the Brassicales order could be potential sources of urea-based sEH inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2611792739,"In Uzbekistan, despite stable and relatively high tuberculosis treatment success rates, relatively high rates of recurrent tuberculosis have recently been reported. Recurrent tuberculosis is when a patient who was treated for pulmonary tuberculosis and cured, later develops the disease again. This requires closer analysis to identify possible causes and recommend interventions to improve the situation. Using countrywide data, this study aimed to analyse trends in recurrent tuberculosis cases and describe their associations with socio-demographic and clinical factors.Countrywide retrospective cohort study comparing recurrent tuberculosis patients with all new tuberculosis patients registered within the NTP between January 2006 and December 2010 using routinely collected data. Determinants studied were baseline characteristics and treatment outcomes.Of 107,380 registered patients during the period January 2006 and December 2010, 9358 (8.7%) were recurrent cases. Between 2006 and 2008, the number of recurrent cases per annum increased from 1530 to 2081, then fell slightly thereafter from 2081 to 1888 cases. The proportion of all notified cases during this period increased from 6.5% to 9.9%. Factors associated with recurrent tuberculosis included age (35-55 years old), having smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis, residing in certain areas of Uzbekistan, having particular co-morbidities (including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and HIV), and being unemployed, a pensioner or disabled. Recurrent tuberculosis patients also had a higher likelihood of having an unfavourable treatment outcome.Despite signs of declining national tuberculosis notifications between 2006 and 2010, the relative proportion of recurrent cases appears to have increased. These findings, together with the identification of possible risk factors associated with recurrent tuberculosis, highlight various areas where Uzbekistan needs to focus its tuberculosis control efforts, particularly in light of the country's rapidly emerging multi drug resistant tuberculosis epidemic."
https://openalex.org/W2611771898,"Stroke is a cerebrovascular pathology for which the only approved treatment is fibrinolysis. Several studies have focused on the development of new drugs but none has led to effective therapies to date, due, among others, to the difficulty to evaluate clinical deficits in experimental animal models. The present study aims to explore the applicability of known behavioral tests not commonly used in ischemia for the neurological assessment of mice after experimental stroke in different brain areas. A total of 225 CD1 male mice were randomly assigned to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion by ligature (pMCAO) or permanent anterior cerebral artery occlusion by photothrombosis (pACAO) models. Modified neuroseverity score, footprint test, forced swim test and elevated plus maze were performed. Under these experimental conditions, modified neuroseverity score showed neurological impairment early after experimental stroke in both models. By contrast, the footprint test and the elevated plus maze detected short-term neurological deterioration in the pMCAO model but not in the pACAO model. Furthermore, the forced swim test identified depression-like behavior in mice after ischemia only when the left hemisphere was affected. In conclusion, we propose the repositioning of known neurobehavioral tests, but not commonly used in the stroke field, for the fast detection of neurological impairments early after ischemia, and even specific to discriminate the territory affected by arterial occlusion as well as the hemisphere where brain damage occurs. All these findings may prove useful to improve the experimental design of neuroprotective drugs in order to bridge the gap between experimental studies and clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2611835927,"Genetically modified, insect-resistant Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) cotton is cultivated extensively in Pakistan. Past studies, however, have raised concerns about the prevalence of Bt cotton varieties possessing weak or nonperforming insect-resistance traits conferred by the cry gene. We examine this issue using data drawn from a representative sample of cotton-growing households that were surveyed in six agroclimatic zones spanning 28 districts in Pakistan in 2013, as well as measurements of Cry protein levels in cotton tissue samples collected from the sampled households’ main fields. The resultant dataset combines information from 593 sampled households with corresponding plant tissue diagnostics from 70 days after sowing, as well as information from 589 sampled households with corresponding diagnostics from 120 days after sowing. Our analysis indicates that 11 percent of farmers believed they were cultivating Bt cotton when, in fact, the Cry toxin was not present in the tested tissue at 70 days after sowing (i.e., a Type I error). The analysis further indicates that 5 percent of farmers believed they were cultivating non-Bt cotton when, in fact, the Cry toxin was present in the tested tissue (i.e., a Type II error). In addition, 17 percent of all sampled farmers were uncertain whether or not they were cultivating Bt cotton. Overall, 33 percent of farmers either did not know or were mistaken in their beliefs about the presence of the cry gene in the cotton they cultivated. Results also indicate that toxic protein levels in the plant tissue samples occurred below threshold levels for lethality in a significant percentage of cases, although these measurements may also be affected by factors related to tissue sample collection, handling, storage, and testing procedures. Nonetheless, results strongly suggest wide variability both in farmers’ beliefs and in gene expression. Such variability has implications for policy and regulation in Pakistan’s transgenic cotton seed market."
https://openalex.org/W2611905977,"Despite a decrease in incidence, smoking remains the most serious public health problem worldwide. Identification of the factors contributing to changes in willingness to quit smoking may aid the development of strategies that encourage smoking cessation. Pooled cross-sectional data from 11,924 smokers from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey II-V were analyzed. The stages of change in smoking cessation were categorized as pre-contemplation, contemplation, and preparation. Baseline characteristics, socioeconomic factors, quality of life, psychological status, and smoking-related factors were compared between groups. The smokers were grouped as follows: 32.4% pre-contemplation, 54.4% contemplation, and 13.1% preparation. The proportion of smokers in the pre-contemplation group decreased (from 37.4% to 28.4%) from 2001 to 2012, while the proportion in the preparation group increased (from 6.4% to 18.1%). Compared with the preparation group, after adjusting for confounding factors, the pre-contemplation group was older [≥65 years-old; odds ratio (OR) = 1.40], more often single (OR = 1.38), less educated (elementary school or lower; OR = 1.93), less physically active in terms of walking (OR = 1.38) or performing strengthening exercises (OR = 1.61), smoked more heavily (≥20 cigarettes per day; OR = 4.75), and had a lower prevalence of chronic disease (OR = 0.76). Moreover, smokers who had never received education on smoking cessation were less willing to quit than those who had (OR = 0.44). In Korean smokers, the stages of change for smoking cessation were associated with age, education, marital status, chronic diseases, physical activity, and participation in smoking cessation programs."
https://openalex.org/W2611390912,"The detection of cool temperatures is thought to be mediated by primary afferent neurons that express the cool temperature sensing protein Transient Receptor Potential Cation Channel, Subfamily M, Member 8 (TRPM8). Using mice, this study tested the hypothesis that sex differences in sensitivity to cool temperatures were mediated by differences in neurons that express TRPM8. Ion currents from TRPM8 expressing trigeminal ganglion (TRG) neurons in females demonstrated larger hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated currents (Ih) than male neurons at both 30° and 18°C. Additionally, female neurons’ voltage gated potassium currents (Ik) were suppressed by cooling, whereas male Ik was not significantly affected. At the holding potential tested (-60mV) TRPM8 currents were not visibly activated in either sex by cooling. Modeling the effect of Ih and Ik on membrane potentials demonstrated that at 30° the membrane potential in both sexes is unstable. At 18°, female TRPM8 TRG neurons develop a large oscillating pattern in their membrane potential, whereas male neurons become highly stable. These findings suggest that the differences in Ih and Ik in the TRPM8 TRG neurons of male and female mice likely leads to greater sensitivity of female mice to the cool temperature. This hypothesis was confirmed in an operant reward/conflict assay. Female mice contacted an 18°C surface for approximately half the time that males contacted the cool surface. At 33° and 10°C male and female mice contacted the stimulus for similar amounts of time. These data suggest that sex differences in the functioning of Ih and Ik in TRPM8 expressing primary afferent neurons leads to differences in cool temperature sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2610716857,"Evolution of metastatic melanoma (MM) under B-RAF inhibitors (BRAFi) is unpredictable, but anticipation is crucial for therapeutic decision. Kinetics changes in metastatic growth are driven by molecular and immune events, and thus we hypothesized that they convey relevant information for decision making.We used a retrospective cohort of 37 MM patients treated by BRAFi only with at least 2 close CT-scans available before BRAFi, as a model to study kinetics of metastatic growth before, under and after BRAFi. All metastases (mets) were individually measured at each CT-scan. From these measurements, different measures of growth kinetics of each met and total tumor volume were computed at different time points. A historical cohort permitted to build a reference model for the expected spontaneous disease kinetics without BRAFi. All variables were included in Cox and multistate regression models for survival, to select best candidates for predicting overall survival.Before starting BRAFi, fast kinetics and moreover a wide range of kinetics (fast and slow growing mets in a same patient) were pejorative markers. At the first assessment after BRAFi introduction, high heterogeneity of kinetics predicted short survival, and added independent information over RECIST progression in multivariate analysis. Metastatic growth rates after BRAFi discontinuation was usually not faster than before BRAFi introduction, but they were often more heterogeneous than before.Monitoring kinetics of different mets before and under BRAFi by repeated CT-scan provides information for predictive mathematical modelling. Disease kinetics deserves more interest."
https://openalex.org/W2610494743,"The transient receptor potential vallinoid type 4 (TRPV4) is a calcium entry channel known to modulate vascular function by mediating endothelium-dependent vasodilation. The present study investigated if isolated cerebral arterial myocytes of the Fawn Hooded hypertensive (FHH) rat, known to display exaggerated KCa channel current activity and impaired myogenic tone, express TRPV4 channels at the transcript and protein level and exhibit TRPV4-like single-channel cationic current activity. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blot, and immunostaining analysis detected the expression of mRNA transcript and translated protein of TRPV4 channel in FHH rat cerebral arterial myocytes. Patch clamp recording of single-channel current activity identified the presence of a single-channel cationic current with unitary conductance of ~85 pS and ~96 pS at hyperpolarizing and depolarizing potentials, respectively, that was inhibited by the TRPV4 channel antagonist RN 1734 or HC 067074 and activated by the potent TRPV4 channel agonist GSK1016790A. Application of negative pressure via the interior of the patch pipette increased the NPo of the TRPV4-like single-channel cationic current recorded in cell-attached patches at a patch potential of 60 mV that was inhibited by prior application of the TRPV4 channel antagonist RN 1734 or HC 067047. Treatment with the TRPV4 channel agonist GSK1016790A caused concentration-dependent increase in the NPo of KCa single-channel current recorded in cell-attached patches of cerebral arterial myocytes at a patch potential of 40 mV, which was not influenced by pretreatment with the voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine or the T-type Ca2+ channel blocker Ni2+. These findings demonstrate that FHH rat cerebral arterial myocytes express mRNA transcript and translated protein for TRPV4 channel and display TRPV4-like single-channel cationic current activity that was stretch-sensitive and activation of which increased the open state probability of KCa single-channel current in these arterial myocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2610899545,"Background The Relationship Scale Questionnaire (RSQ) is a widely-used measure of adult attachment, but whether the results obtained by the RSQ fit the attachment construct has only been examined to a limited extent. Objective The objectives of this study were to investigate the psychometric properties of the Danish translation of the RSQ and to test whether the results are consistent with the hypothesized model of attachment. Methods The study included two samples: 602 general practitioners and 611 cancer patients. The two samples were analyzed separately. Data quality was assessed by mean, median and missing values for each item, floor and ceiling effects, average inter-item correlations and Cronbach’s α for each subscale. Test-retest was assessed by intra-class correlations among 76 general practitioners. A confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to establish evidence of the four proposed subscales. Due to an inadequate fit of the model, data was randomly split into two equally sized subsamples and an exploratory factor analysis was conducted for all 30 items in the first subsample comprised of 286 cancer patients and 285 general practitioners. The EFA yielded a three-factor structure which was validated through a confirmatory factor analyses in a second subsample comprised of 278 cancer patients and 289 general practitioners. Results The data quality of the RSQ was generally good, except low internal consistency and low to moderate test-retest reliability. The four subscales of the RSQ were not confirmed by the confirmatory factor analysis. An exploratory factor analysis suggested a three-factor solution for both general practitioners and patients, which accounted for 61.1% of the variance among general practitioners and 62.5% among patients. The new three-factor solution was verified in a confirmatory factor analyses. Conclusion The proposed four-factor model of the RSQ could not be confirmed in this study. Similar challenges have been found by other studies validating the RSQ. An alternative three-factor structure was found for the RSQ."
https://openalex.org/W2611216794,"The scented gland, a musk-secreting organ of male muskrats, shows clear seasonal changes. When entering the secreting season in March, scented glands gradually increase in size and active secretion starts. In September, scented glands become gradually smaller and secretion decreases. By November, scented glands are gradually replaced by adipose tissue. In this study, six healthy adult male muskrats were analysed: three from the secreting season (March) and three from the non-secreting season (November). Using RNA-Seq analysis, gene expression profiles of scented glands from both seasons were determined. Using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database, we found that genes involved in calcium and TGF-beta signalling pathways were significantly more expressed in the non-secreting than in the secreting season. These changes in gene expression correlated with alterations in scented gland size. Both calcium and TGF-beta signalling pathways are important regulators of cell apoptosis, which may thus be involved in muskrat scented gland degeneration."

Heterogeneous clinical picture have led to the classification of patients based on the levels of antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GADA) that correlate with clinical phenotypes closer to T1D or T2D when GADA titers are high or low, respectively. To date, LADA etiology remains elusive despite numerous studies investigating on genetic predisposition and environmental risk factors. To our knowledge, this is the first study aimed at evaluation of a putative role played by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) as an infective agent in LADA pathogenesis. MAP is known to cause chronic enteritis in ruminants and has been associated with autoimmune disorders in humans. We analyzed seroreactivity of 223 Sardinian LADA subjects and 182 healthy volunteers against MAP-derived peptides and their human homologs of proinsulin and zinc transporter 8 protein. A significantly elevated positivity for MAP/proinsulin was detected among patients, with the highest prevalence in the 32-41-year-old T1D-like LADA subgroup, supporting our hypothesis of a possible MAP contribution in the development of autoimmunity."

All patients underwent at least nine VF measurements with the Humphrey Field Analyzer, CST measurements, axial length (AL), central corneal thickness (CCT) and intraocular pressure (IOP) with Goldmann applanation tonometry (GAT). Mean total deviation (mTD) progression rates of the eight VFs, excluding the first VF, were calculated and the association between progression rate and the other listed measurements was analyzed using linear regression, and the optimal to describe mTD progression rate was selected based on the second order bias corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) index.VF progression was described best in a model that included CST parameters as well as other ocular measurements. The optimal linear model to describe mTD progression rate was given by the equation: -8.9-0.068 x mean GAT + 0.68 x A1 time + 0.31 x A2 time -0.39 x A2 length- 1.26 x highest deformation amplitude.CST measurements are useful when assessing VF progression in glaucoma patients. In particular, careful consideration should be given to patients where: (i) an eye is observed to be applanated fast in the first and second applanations, (ii) the applanated area is wide in the second applanation and (iii) the indentation is deep at the maximum deformation, since these eyes appear to be at greater risk of VF progression."

In the seroconversion experiment, subgenotype D1 (sgtD1) deletion (1763-1770) had significantly lower fitness comparing with both sgtD1 wild type and sgtD1mut G1896A, while, in the case of occupation of ecological niche experiment, the results showed the same relative fitness between all of the genotype combinations, except F1b-F4. In this case sgtF1b clearly overgrow sgtF4, which is in accordance with the observation that F1b is the most prevalent in the new infections in Argentina.

The mean duration of recent infection (MDRI) and false recent rate (FRR) are critical parameters for HIV incidence assays, as they impact HIV incidence estimates and provide a measure of assay performance. The HIV-1 Multiplex assay is an in-house developed, magnetic bead-based assay that measures virus-specific antibody levels and avidity to multiple analytes. To ensure quality control and to facilitate transfer of the assay to external laboratories or testing facilities, the in-house assay has been adapted and produced in kit form. Here, we describe the performance characteristics of the multiplex kit and demonstrate the stability of the kit components over a one-year period. Two statistical methods were employed to estimate the MDRI of the individual analytes and five different algorithms, combining multiple analyte values. The MDRI estimates for the individual analytes and five algorithms were all between 200 and 300 days post-seroconversion, with no notable difference between the two statistical approaches. All five algorithms exhibited a 0% FRR with specimens from long-term, subtype B HIV-1-infected individuals. The assay parameters described in this study provide the necessary tools to implement the HIV-1 multiplex assay and improves the utility of the assay for field use."

Patients followed-up at 1, 3, 6, 12 months after surgery and each year thereafter.Four hundreds and two patients completed the entire follow-up, 40 patients (45 knees) were lost to follow-up. The average follow-up time was 73.0 ± 1.9 months. The mean length of the incisions was 5.0 ± 0.2 cm. The average FTA decreased from 183.6° ± 5.1° preoperatively to 174.3° ± 4.2° postoperatively, and the mean rectified varus deformity angle was 9.3° ± 1.2°. The KSS clinical score improved from 42.4 ± 2.9 to 92.9 ± 3.8, and the function score improved from 53.5 ± 3.8 to 93.5 ± 4.0. The WOMAC score improved from 47.5 ± 3.1 preoperatively to 12.3 ± 1.5 at the last evaluation. The VAS dropped from 7.8 ± 1.9 preoperatively to 1.6 ± 0.2 postoperatively. All clinical evaluations (KSS, WOMAC, VAS) were significantly different (p < 0.05) from pre and post-operative evaluations. The survival rate was 99.1% at 73 months, and the revision rate was 0.9%.The midterm clinical outcomes of MIA-UKR are satisfactory in a Chinese patient population, which is a good surgical option for patients with medial arthropathy of the knee. However, longer-term follow-up studies should be performed in these patients."

The main independent variable was past 30 day illicit opioid use (yes vs. no). Secondary analyses evaluated none (0 days), intermittent (1 to 7 days), and persistent (8 to 30 days) opioid use. Outcomes were determined with flow cytometry. Analyses were conducted using linear regression models.Among 186 participants, 38% reported any illicit opioid use (18% intermittent and 20% persistent). Any illicit opioid use was not significantly associated with T cell characteristics. Intermittent opioid use appeared to be associated with decreased memory CD8+ T cells proportion (CD45RO+CD45RA- CD8+ T cells: adjusted mean difference [AMD] [95% CI] = -6.15 [-11.50, -0.79], p = 0.02) and borderline significant increased senescent T cells (%CD57+ of total CD28-CD8+ T cells (AMD [95% CI] = 7.70 [-0.06, 15.46], p = 0.05).Among ART-naïve HIV-infected Russians, any illicit opioid use was not significantly associated with T cell abnormalities although intermittent illicit opioid use may be associated with CD8 T cell abnormalities. Longitudinal studies are warranted to confirm these findings given increased risk of infections and comorbidities seen among HIV-infected individuals with illicit opioid use."
https://openalex.org/W2611011895,"Wetland habitats across the world are experiencing rapid modification and loss due to accelerating habitat conversion. Impacts to wetland habitats are particularly acute in California where up to 90% of wetland habitats have been modified or lost. Vernal pool ecosystems have therefore undergone a dramatic loss in habitat and along with them an entire endemic fauna is under threat of extinction. Recent efforts to conserve vernal pool habitat and associated species have involved restoration and creation of vernal pools as well as translocations of threatened species. The vernal pool fairy shrimp, Branchinecta lynchi, is one of several endemic and federally listed species being targeted for translocations. To guide reintroduction and conservation, detailed information on range-wide population structure and diversity is needed. We collected genetic data from two mitochondrial genes throughout the known extant range of B. lynchi to elucidate population structure and diversity of the species. We found support for phylogeographic structure throughout the range of B. lynch associated with isolated watersheds and vernal pool regions previously identified in the recovery plan for the species. The underlying mechanisms responsible for this broad pattern of genetic structure have yet to be identified. However, the evidence of only a few haplotypes being shared across the species range and patterns of isolation by distance within vernal pool regions suggests dispersal limitation may play a role. These results stress that conservation programs, at a minimum, should consider using individuals from regional populations as sources for reintroductions to maintain historical patterns of genetic differentiation. Additionally, because genetic structure is associated with vernal pool regions which are based on local hydrology and geology, translocations should proceed considering the distance between donor and recipient sites."
https://openalex.org/W2611612752,"Purpose Plasminogen activator activity (PAA) in tears of pregnant women was investigated at various gestation times to assess the availability of plasminogen activator for aiding potential corneal wound healing processes during pregnancy. Methods PAA was measured by a spectrophotometric method. The analysis used 91 tear samples from pregnant and non-pregnant women, supplemented with 10 additional tear PAA measurements from non-pregnant women obtained in a previous study. Results Tear levels of PAA in pregnant women formed a bimodal distribution. Either the tear PAA level was zero or non-zero during pregnancy. When non-zero, the tear PAA level was dissociated from gestation time and not different than non-pregnant and post-pregnant levels. The frequency of occurrence of zero level tear PAA increased with gestation: 16%, 17% and 46% had zero tear PAA in samples taken from women in the first, second and third trimester, respectively. Conclusions Overall, of the tear samples taken from women during pregnancy, a total of 26% were at zero tear PAA. The remaining tear samples had non-zero tear PAA values throughout gestation equivalent to non-pregnant tear PAA values, suggesting local control of the source of PAA in tears. Given the importance of the plasminogen activator system in tears to wound healing in the cornea, and the high occurrence of zero tear PAA in our sample of pregnant women, elective corneal surgery would be contraindicated. If corneal surgery is nevertheless necessary, the tear PAA level would be worth checking and patients with low level should be closely observed during the postoperative period."
https://openalex.org/W4231950089,"In insect brains, the mushroom bodies (MBs, a higher center) comprise intrinsic neurons, termed Kenyon cells (KCs). We previously showed that the honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) MBs comprise four types of KCs, in addition to the previously known three types of KCs: class I large-type KCs (lKCs), class I small-type KCs (sKCs) and class II KCs, novel class I ‘middle-type’ KCs (mKCs), which are characterized by the preferential expression of a gene, termed mKast. Although mKast was originally discovered during the search for genes whose expression is enriched in the optic lobes (OLs) in the worker brain, subsequent analysis revealed that the gene is expressed in an mKC-preferential manner in the MBs. To gain more insights into the function of mKast in the honeybee brain, we here performed expression analysis of mKast and immunohistochemistry of the mKast protein. Prominent mKast expression was first detected in the brain after the P7 pupal stage. In addition, mKast was expressed almost selectively in the brain, suggesting its late pupal and adult specific functions in the brain. Immunohistochemistry revealed that mKast-like immunoreactivity is detected in several regions in the worker brain: inside and around the MB calyces, at the outer edges of the OL lobula, at the outer surface of and posterior to the antennal lobes (ALs), along the dorsal midline of the anterior brain and at the outer surface of the subesophageal ganglions (SOG). mKast-like immunoreactivities in the MBs, OLs, ALs and SOG were due to the corresponding neurons, while mKast-like immunoreactivities beneath/between the MB calyces were assumed to most likely correspond to the lateral/medial neurosecretory cells."
https://openalex.org/W2610659788,"Since chaos systems generally have the intrinsic properties of sensitivity to initial conditions, topological mixing and density of periodic orbits, they may tactfully use the chaotic ergodic orbits to achieve the global optimum or their better approximation to given cost functions with high probability. During the past decade, they have increasingly received much attention from academic community and industry society throughout the world. To improve the performance of particle swarm optimization (PSO), we herein propose a chaotic proportional integral derivative (PID) controlling PSO algorithm by the hybridization of chaotic logistic dynamics and hierarchical inertia weight. The hierarchical inertia weight coefficients are determined in accordance with the present fitness values of the local best positions so as to adaptively expand the particles' search space. Moreover, the chaotic logistic map is not only used in the substitution of the two random parameters affecting the convergence behavior, but also used in the chaotic local search for the global best position so as to easily avoid the particles' premature behaviors via the whole search space. Thereafter, the convergent analysis of chaotic PID controlling PSO is under deep investigation. Empirical simulation results demonstrate that compared with other several chaotic PSO algorithms like chaotic PSO with the logistic map, chaotic PSO with the tent map and chaotic catfish PSO with the logistic map, chaotic PID controlling PSO exhibits much better search efficiency and quality when solving the optimization problems. Additionally, the parameter estimation of a nonlinear dynamic system also further clarifies its superiority to chaotic catfish PSO, genetic algorithm (GA) and PSO."
