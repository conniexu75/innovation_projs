As the small volume of each well permits detection of extremely low levels of fluorescence, protein abundance is determined by counting the number of fluorescent wells as a percentage of the number of wells containing beads. The ability to detect single protein molecules1,2 in blood could accelerate the discovery and use of more sensitive diagnostic biomarkers. To detect low-abundance proteins in blood, we captured them on microscopic beads decorated with specific antibodies and then labeled the immunocomplexes (one or zero labeled target protein molecules per bead) with an enzymatic reporter capable of generating a fluorescent product. After isolating the beads in 50-fl reaction chambers designed to hold only a single bead, we used fluorescence imaging to detect single protein molecules. Our single-molecule enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (digital ELISA) approach detected as few as ∼10–20 enzyme-labeled complexes in 100 μl of sample (∼10−19 M) and routinely allowed detection of clinically relevant proteins in serum at concentrations (<10−15 M) much lower than conventional ELISA3,4,5. Digital ELISA detected prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in sera from patients who had undergone radical prostatectomy at concentrations as low as 14 fg/ml (0.4 fM)."

https://openalex.org/W2066321034,"Sebastien Gagneux and colleagues report the genome sequences of 21 phylogeographically diverse Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex strains. Analysis of the global genetic diversity of these strains showed that most of the known human T cell epitopes were highly conserved. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an obligate human pathogen capable of persisting in individual hosts for decades. We sequenced the genomes of 21 strains representative of the global diversity and six major lineages of the M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC) at 40- to 90-fold coverage using Illumina next-generation DNA sequencing. We constructed a genome-wide phylogeny based on these genome sequences. Comparative analyses of the sequences showed, as expected, that essential genes in MTBC were more evolutionarily conserved than nonessential genes. Notably, however, most of the 491 experimentally confirmed human T cell epitopes showed little sequence variation and had a lower ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous changes than seen in essential and nonessential genes. We confirmed these findings in an additional data set consisting of 16 antigens in 99 MTBC strains. These findings are consistent with strong purifying selection acting on these epitopes, implying that MTBC might benefit from recognition by human T cells."

This suggests that DNA methylation may be a mechanism for preserving long-lasting memories. A behavioral memory's lifetime represents multiple molecular lifetimes, suggesting the necessity for a self-perpetuating signal. One candidate is DNA methylation, a transcriptional repression mechanism that maintains cellular memory throughout development. We found that persistent, gene-specific cortical hypermethylation was induced in rats by a single, hippocampus-dependent associative learning experience and pharmacologic inhibition of methylation 1 month after learning disrupted remote memory. We propose that the adult brain utilizes DNA methylation to preserve long-lasting memories."

https://openalex.org/W2027203412,"Various kinds of fatty acids are distributed in membrane phospholipids in mammalian cells and tissues. The degree of fatty acid unsaturation in membrane phospholipids affects many membrane-associated functions and can be influenced by diet and by altered activities of lipid-metabolizing enzymes such as fatty acid desaturases. However, little is known about how mammalian cells respond to changes in phospholipid fatty acid composition. In this study we showed that stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) knockdown increased the amount of saturated fatty acids and decreased that of monounsaturated fatty acids in phospholipids without affecting the amount or the composition of free fatty acid and induced unfolded protein response (UPR), evidenced by increased expression of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) mRNAs and splicing of Xbox-binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA. SCD1 knockdown-induced UPR was rescued by various unsaturated fatty acids and was enhanced by saturated fatty acid. Lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (LPCAT3), which incorporates preferentially polyunsaturated fatty acids into phosphatidylcholine, was up-regulated in SCD1 knockdown cells. Knockdown of LPCAT3 synergistically enhanced UPR with SCD1 knockdown. Finally we showed that palmitic acid-induced UPR was significantly enhanced by LPCAT3 knockdown as well as SCD1 knockdown. These results suggest that a decrease in membrane phospholipid unsaturation induces UPR."
https://openalex.org/W2059206109,"The three-dimensional structures of proteins often show a modular architecture comprised of discrete structural regions or domains. Cooperative communication between these regions is important for catalysis, regulation and efficient folding; lack of coupling has been implicated in the formation of fibrils and other misfolding pathologies. How different structural regions of a protein communicate and contribute to a protein's overall energetics and folding, however, is still poorly understood. Here we use a single-molecule optical tweezers approach to induce the selective unfolding of particular regions of T4 lysozyme and monitor the effect on other regions not directly acted on by force. We investigate how the topological organization of a protein (the order of structural elements along the sequence) affects the coupling and folding cooperativity between its domains. To probe the status of the regions not directly subjected to force, we determine the free energy changes during mechanical unfolding using Crooks' fluctuation theorem. We pull on topological variants (circular permutants) and find that the topological organization of the polypeptide chain critically determines the folding cooperativity between domains and thus what parts of the folding/unfolding landscape are explored. We speculate that proteins may have evolved to select certain topologies that increase coupling between regions to avoid areas of the landscape that lead to kinetic trapping and misfolding."

Using mathematical modeling and experimental approaches, we unravel how HRG and EGF generate distinct, all-or-none responses of the phosphorylated transcription factor c-Fos. In the cytosol, EGF induces transient and HRG induces sustained ERK activation. In the nucleus, however, ERK activity and c-fos mRNA expression are transient for both ligands. Knockdown of dual-specificity phosphatases extends HRG-stimulated nuclear ERK activation, but not c-fos mRNA expression, implying the existence of a HRG-induced repressor of c-fos transcription. Further experiments confirmed that this repressor is mainly induced by HRG, but not EGF, and requires new protein synthesis. We show how a spatially distributed, signaling-transcription cascade robustly discriminates between transient and sustained ERK activities at the c-Fos system level.

ErbB ligands EGF and HRG induce transient versus sustained cytoplasmic ERK activity Nuclear ERK activity and c-fos mRNA expression are transient for both ligands HRG induces increased expression of c-fos, ERK phosphatases, and a c-fos repressor Signaling-transcription cascades robustly discriminate different ERK dynamics The ErbB receptors initiate a multilayered signal transduction network that converts external cues into specific gene expression responses in different cells and tissues. Its deregulation drives the development and progression of several types of cancer (Citri and Yarden, 2006Citri A. Yarden Y. EGF-ERBB signalling: towards the systems level.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar). Ligand binding causes the homo- and heterodimerization of ErbB receptors, followed by allosteric activation of their intrinsic tyrosine kinases (Zhang et al., 2006Zhang X. Gureasko J. Shen K. Cole P.A. Kuriyan J. An allosteric mechanism for activation of the kinase domain of epidermal growth factor receptor.Cell. 2006; 125: 1137-1149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). This induces a complex cascade of phosphorylation and activation events that convey signals to the nucleus. The subsequent changes in gene expression eventually lead to pivotal cell-fate decisions, such as proliferation or differentiation. A major challenge for cell signaling studies is to understand how different cues and receptors give rise to unique gene expression responses despite the promiscuous activation of shared pathways, such as the extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK) cascade. Initial insight into this specificity dilemma came from observations that PC-12 cells proliferated after a transient ERK activation by epidermal growth factor (EGF) but differentiated after a sustained ERK activation by nerve growth factor (NGF), showing that the duration of ERK signaling is critical for cell-fate decisions (Marshall, 1995Marshall C.J. Specificity of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling: transient versus sustained extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation.Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4147) Google Scholar). Subsequent theoretical and experimental work revealed that different ERK activation dynamics can arise from differential feedback wiring of the cytosolic ERK cascade (Kholodenko, 2007Kholodenko B.N. Untangling the signalling wires.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 247-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, Santos et al., 2007Santos S.D. Verveer P.J. Bastiaens P.I. Growth factor-induced MAPK network topology shapes Erk response determining PC-12 cell fate.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 324-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, the duration of ERK activation is sensed by a network of immediate early genes, including the transcription factor c-Fos (Murphy et al., 2004Murphy L.O. MacKeigan J.P. Blenis J. A network of immediate early gene products propagates subtle differences in mitogen-activated protein kinase signal amplitude and duration.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, Murphy et al., 2002Murphy L.O. Smith S. Chen R.H. Fingar D.C. Blenis J. Molecular interpretation of ERK signal duration by immediate early gene products.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 556-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). MCF-7 cells show similar signaling input-output relationships: sustained ERK activity induces cellular differentiation and a significant c-Fos response, while transient ERK activity induces proliferation and a negligible c-Fos response (Nagashima et al., 2007Nagashima T. Shimodaira H. Ide K. Nakakuki T. Tani Y. Takahashi K. Yumoto N. Hatakeyama M. Quantitative transcriptional control of ErbB receptor signaling undergoes graded to biphasic response for cell differentiation.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4045-4056Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These examples suggest that differential ERK activation kinetics can be converted into all-or-none responses at the transcription factor level. This conversion could explain how common core pathways can program distinct cell-fate decisions. The sustained induction of c-Fos depends on activation of ERK and its downstream target, p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK), which stimulate c-fos transcription and cooperate to stabilize the c-Fos protein product through multiple phosphorylations (Chen et al., 1992Chen R.H. Sarnecki C. Blenis J. Nuclear localization and regulation of erk- and rsk-encoded protein kinases.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 915-927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Chen et al., 1993Chen R.H. Abate C. Blenis J. Phosphorylation of the c-Fos transrepression domain by mitogen-activated protein kinase and 90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1993; 90: 10952-10956Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, Murphy et al., 2002Murphy L.O. Smith S. Chen R.H. Fingar D.C. Blenis J. Molecular interpretation of ERK signal duration by immediate early gene products.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 556-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation also enhances c-Fos transcriptional activity (Pellegrino and Stork, 2006Pellegrino M.J. Stork P.J. Sustained activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase by nerve growth factor regulates c-fos protein stabilization and transactivation in PC12 cells.J. Neurochem. 2006; 99: 1480-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar); therefore, phosphorylated c-Fos (pc-Fos) may be viewed as the functional output of this system. A network structure, in which an initial input signal (active ERK) induces an intermediate signal (c-fos messenger RNA [mRNA]) and both the initial and intermediate signals are needed to generate the final output (pc-Fos protein), is termed a coherent feedforward loop (CFL) (Mangan et al., 2003Mangan S. Zaslaver A. Alon U. The coherent feedforward loop serves as a sign-sensitive delay element in transcription networks.J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). This CFL creates a “sign-sensitive delay” that senses the duration of ERK activation: a drop in the initial input (− sign) results in immediate loss of output, whereas an increase (+ sign) leads to a delayed increase in output. Additionally, negative feedback regulation arises from ERK-induced expression of the dual specificity phosphatases (collectively known as DUSPs or MAPK phosphatases [MKPs]), which deactivate ERK (Brondello et al., 1997Brondello J.M. Brunet A. Pouysségur J. McKenzie F.R. The dual specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 and -2 are induced by the p42/p44MAPK cascade.J. Biol.

Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K.

DUSP protein expression develops on the same time scale as c-Fos expression and is also controlled by ERK activity (Brondello et al., 1999Brondello J.M. Pouysségur J. McKenzie F.R. Reduced MAP kinase phosphatase-1 degradation after p42/p44MAPK-dependent phosphorylation.Science. 1999; 286: 2514-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Thus, although the ERK to pc-Fos CFL could provide a core sensing mechanism for transient versus sustained ERK activity (Murphy et al., 2002Murphy L.O. Smith S. Chen R.H. Fingar D.C. Blenis J. Molecular interpretation of ERK signal duration by immediate early gene products.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 556-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar), the resulting emergent properties of this network, which includes negative transcriptional regulation are not understood. Here, we demonstrate how the spatiotemporal coordination of combined signaling and transcriptional responses allows cells to convert analog ERK signaling into robust, digital pc-Fos responses. Although EGF and HRG induce transient versus sustained cytoplasmic ERK activities, downstream c-fos mRNA expression is transient for both ligands. Modeling suggests that this identical c-fos expression duration is explained by a larger dusp expression response and resulting transient nuclear ERK activity for HRG. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated dusp knockdown sustains HRG-induced nuclear ERK activity but has little effect on HRG-activated c-fos mRNA expression, implying the existence of an additional negative regulator of c-fos transcription. Double-pulse experiments with different ligands demonstrate that this repressor is induced by HRG, but not by EGF. HRG stimulation in the presence of cycloheximide sustains c-fos mRNA expression, showing that activation of the repressor requires de novo protein synthesis. For HRG, sustained cytoplasmic ppERK and, to a lesser extent, the transient nuclear ppERK stabilize the c-Fos protein and drive the high pc-Fos response, whereas for EGF, transient cytoplasmic ERK activity causes a negligible pc-Fos response. Systems-level model analysis reveals how the spatially distributed regulation cascades make the all-or-none pc-Fos responses robust to noise in ERK activity and to system perturbations. Predictions based on our model built for MCF-7 cells can also explain the measured EGF- and NGF-induced pc-Fos responses in the classic PC-12 cell system. Thus, the proposed control mechanisms of discrimination between transient and sustained cytoplasmic ERK activities hold true for different types of cells and ligands. Overall, our experimental and computational results demonstrate that a CFL signaling cascade interlinked with transcriptional negative feedback loops is the principal c-Fos regulation module wherein differential, spatially distributed ERK dynamics contribute to binary cell-fate decisions. Previous studies showed that activated ERK controls c-fos mRNA expression (Buchwalter et al., 2004Buchwalter G. Gross C. Wasylyk B. Ets ternary complex transcription factors.Gene. 2004; 324: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, Chai and Tarnawski, 2002Chai J. Tarnawski A.S. Serum response factor: discovery, biochemistry, biological roles and implications for tissue injury healing.J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2002; 53: 147-157PubMed Google Scholar). Since EGF and HRG induced transient and sustained ERK activation, respectively (Figure 1A ), we expected c-fos mRNA expression to be transient for EGF and sustained for HRG. Surprisingly, c-fos mRNA expression profiles were transient for both ligands, although the magnitude of the c-fos mRNA response was larger for HRG than for EGF (Figure 1B). This difference in the mRNA response was amplified at the level of c-Fos expression (Figure 1C) and converted into an all- (HRG) or-none (EGF) pc-Fos response (Figure 1D). Since ppERK is required for c-Fos stabilization, the observed all-or-none pc-Fos responses can be attributed to the continued ppERK presence after HRG stimulation and the absence of ppERK after 30 min EGF stimulation (Murphy et al., 2002Murphy L.O. Smith S. Chen R.H. Fingar D.C. Blenis J. Molecular interpretation of ERK signal duration by immediate early gene products.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 556-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Yet, this interpretation cannot account for the transient time course of c-fos mRNA. It is also inconsistent with our observations that HRG-induced c-fos mRNA expression begins to decline after 30 min, while ppERK is sustained up to 60 min. These results suggest that the c-Fos expression dynamics cannot be explained solely by the ERK activation profiles and that more complex mechanisms must be invoked. Although some aspects of c-Fos regulation are understood, the data shown in Figure 1 raise several questions. Why are the c-fos mRNA expression profiles transient for both EGF and HRG? What mechanisms are responsible for the all-or-none pc-Fos responses? Is the discrimination mechanism robust to noise and perturbations? To answer such questions, we have developed a mechanistic, computational model that describes the dynamic control of c-Fos expression and phosphorylation (shown schematically in Figure 1E). The model allows us to deeply explore the emergent properties of the signaling network that governs these transitions to make predictions that are used as testable hypotheses in our experiments. When the predictions agree with the data, this substantiates key regulatory mechanisms. On the other hand, points of the model-experiment mismatch call for a new understanding of regulatory mechanisms and model refinement, as indeed happened in this study. Figure 1E shows our initial model (black lines), which is based on pre-existing knowledge. This initial model was used until new experimental data revealed its limitations. The further model refinement (orange lines) incorporates new hypotheses that improve the agreement between the model and experimental data (Figure S1 available online). Here, we briefly describe the initial model; a complete derivation is presented in the Extended Experimental Procedures. Understanding of the complexity of signaling can be facilitated by a modular approach to modeling (Kholodenko et al., 2002Kholodenko B.N. Kiyatkin A. Bruggeman F.J. Sontag E. Westerhoff H.V. Hoek J.B. Untangling the wires: a strategy to trace functional interactions in signaling and gene networks.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 12841-12846Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). This approach allows us to focus only on the ERK-induced c-Fos dynamics, considering signaling between ErbB receptors and ERK as a separate module (Birtwistle et al., 2007Birtwistle M.R. Hatakeyama M. Yumoto N. Ogunnaike B.A. Hoek J.B. Kholodenko B.N. Ligand-dependent responses of the ErbB signaling network: experimental and modeling analyses.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2007; 3: 144Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). As the model input, we take cytoplasmic dually phosphorylated MEK (ppMEK), which activates ERK, and this input is estimated directly from data (Figure 1F). Active ERK is dephosphorylated by constitutive (such as PP2A and PTP-SL) and induced (DUSP) phosphatases in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Active ERK phosphorylates and activates RSK (Chen et al., 1992Chen R.H. Sarnecki C. Blenis J. Nuclear localization and regulation of erk- and rsk-encoded protein kinases.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 915-927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and active ERK and RSK cooperate to stimulate c-fos transcription (Figure 1E). Upon nuclear translocation, active ERK phosphorylates and activates the transcription factor Elk1 (Gille et al., 1995Gille H. Kortenjann M. Thomae O. Moomaw C. Slaughter C. Cobb M.H. Shaw P.E. ERK phosphorylation potentiates Elk-1-mediated ternary complex formation and transactivation.EMBO J. 1995; 14: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar), which binds to the serum response factor and subsequently to the c-fos promoter (Buchwalter et al., 2004Buchwalter G. Gross C. Wasylyk B. Ets ternary complex transcription factors.Gene. 2004; 324: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). RSK phosphorylates and activates CREB (Xing et al., 1996Xing J. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Coupling of the RAS-MAPK pathway to gene activation by RSK2, a growth factor-regulated CREB kinase.Science. 1996; 273: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar), which also binds to the c-fos promoter (Wang and Prywes, 2000Wang Y. Prywes R.

When phospho-Elk1 and phospho-CREB are both bound to the c-fos promoter, transcription occurs (Bruning et al., 2000Bruning J.C. Gillette J.A. Zhao Y. Bjorbaeck C. Kotzka J. Knebel B. Avci H. Hanstein B. Lingohr P. Moller D.E. et al.Ribosomal subunit kinase-2 is required for growth factor-stimulated transcription of the c-Fos gene.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

USA. 1998; 95: 12202-12207Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation and stabilization of nascent c-Fos proteins depend on active ERK and RSK and on an ERK docking site on c-Fos termed the DEF domain (Murphy et al., 2002Murphy L.O. Smith S. Chen R.H. Fingar D.C. Blenis J. Molecular interpretation of ERK signal duration by immediate early gene products.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 556-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). The nuclear inducible dusps are immediate early genes that are upregulated within ∼15–30 min of stimulation with EGF in a variety of cell lines (Charles et al., 1992Charles C.H. Abler A.S. Lau L.F. cDNA sequence of a growth factor-inducible immediate early gene and characterization of its encoded protein.Oncogene. 1992; 7: 187-190PubMed Google Scholar, Keyse and Emslie, 1992Keyse S.M. Emslie E.A. Oxidative stress and heat shock induce a human gene encoding a protein-tyrosine phosphatase.Nature. 1992; 359: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). ERK activation leads to upregulation of dusp mRNA levels (Brondello et al., 1997Brondello J.M. Brunet A. Pouysségur J. McKenzie F.R. The dual specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 and -2 are induced by the p42/p44MAPK cascade.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1368-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), and, similar to c-Fos, active ERK phosphorylates and stabilizes the dusp protein product (Brondello et al., 1999Brondello J.M. Pouysségur J. McKenzie F.R. Reduced MAP kinase phosphatase-1 degradation after p42/p44MAPK-dependent phosphorylation.Science. 1999; 286: 2514-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). DUSP translocates to the nucleus and dephosphorylates nuclear ppERK (Brondello et al., 1995Brondello J.M. McKenzie F.R. Sun H. Tonks N.K. Pouysségur J. Constitutive MAP kinase phosphatase (MKP-1) expression blocks G1 specific gene transcription and S-phase entry in fibroblasts.Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1895-1904PubMed Google Scholar). Before a model can be used to generate hypotheses, it must be “trained” with experimental data. This process is called parameter estimation (see details in the Experimental Procedures and Extended Experimental Procedures). To train the model, we used data on multiple nodes of the c-Fos expression network (Figures 1F–1M). The solid lines in Figures 1F–1M denote simulations done with the initial model that match closely with the data (shown as points). Although the model can reproduce the data in Figure 1, goodness of fit to a training set alone is insufficient for validating the model. It is necessary to test the model predictions against independent experimental data, as is described below. The model permitted us to analyze on a systems level how transient (EGF) and sustained (HRG) ERK signals are robustly discriminated into all-or-none pc-Fos responses, despite the same duration of c-fos mRNA responses. To generate testable hypotheses, we employed sensitivity analysis, which examines how perturbations to the processes in the model affect the c-fos mRNA expression duration and cumulative (time-integrated) pc-Fos protein response. We quantified the duration as the time it takes for c-fos mRNA to decline below 10% of its maximum and the cumulative response as the integral of the pc-Fos concentration over the observation time of 90 min. The sensitivities, or control coefficients, were approximated as the percent change in the quantity of interest caused by a 1% change in a reaction rate (Kholodenko et al., 1997bKholodenko B.N. Hoek J.B. Westerhoff H.V. Brown G.C. Quantification of information transfer via cellular signal transduction pathways.FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Negative control coefficients indicate that the quantity will decrease with a reaction rate increase, while positive coefficients indicate that the quantity will increase. Large coefficients, whether positive or negative, indicate potentially significant control mechanisms. The control coefficients for c-fos mRNA duration and integrated pc-Fos response are presented in Figures 2A and 2B (see also Figure S2). For both EGF and HRG, the dynamic expression of c-fos mRNA is strongly controlled by c-fos transcriptional processes (including mRNA transport and degradation). EGF and HRG differ in dusp mRNA production/degradation, ERK (de)activation and transport, and the RSK-CREB pathway contributions. The control distribution over the cumulative pc-Fos response (Figure 2B) also shows that dusp expression contributes to the ligand-specific regulation of pc-Fos. While sensitivity analysis suggests an appreciable regulatory role of dusp, this analysis considers only small perturbations, and the predictions may not hold for large perturbations. Therefore, we evaluated how large decreases in dusp mRNA levels would affect c-fos responses. The results support the conclusions of the sensitivity analysis. Simulated dusp downregulation increased the amplitude and duration of c-fos mRNA responses for HRG, but only the amplitude for EGF (Figures 2C and 2D).Figure S2Empirical Model for MEK Activation that Is Needed for Sensitivity Analysis, Related to Figure 2Show full captionFor the calculated sensitivity coefficients to obey summation laws, a time-invariant model input is needed, but the input for the initial model (Figure 1) varies with time. We therefore use the pictured empirical input model, which has a constant input, to perform the sensitivity analysis.(A) Empirical model schematic. For EGF stimulation, enzyme A1 is activated by EGF (steps 1 and 2), and the activity of RsT is mediated by EGF and A1∗ (steps 5 and 7). For HRG stimulation, enzymes A2 and A3 are activated by HRG (steps 3, 4, 9 and 10), and the activities of RsT and pKin are mediated by HRG, A2∗ and A3∗ (steps 6, 8, 11 and 12). A series of reactions comprised of steps 1—8 generates fast signaling to MEK while that of steps 9—12 generates slow signaling.

For EGF stimulation, enzyme A1 is activated by EGF (steps 1 and 2), and the activity of RsT is mediated by EGF and A1∗ (steps 5 and 7). For HRG stimulation, enzymes A2 and A3 are activated by HRG (steps 3, 4, 9 and 10), and the activities of RsT and pKin are mediated by HRG, A2∗ and A3∗ (steps 6, 8, 11 and 12). A series of reactions comprised of steps 1—8 generates fast signaling to MEK while that of steps 9—12 generates slow signaling. MEK activity is regulated by fast RsT and slow pKin (steps 13—15). (B) Simulated MEK activation dynamics. Quantified ppMEK data is identical to those shown in Figure 1 and Figure S1. Our model predicts that although HRG induces sustained cytoplasmic ERK activity (Figure 1G), HRG-induced dusp expression results in transient nuclear ERK activation, which persists slightly longer for HRG than for EGF (Figure 3A ). To test this prediction, we quantified the spatially-resolved dynamics of ppERK by immunofluorescence staining (Figures 3B–3D and Figure S3A). The data confirmed that both the HRG and EGF-induced nuclear ppERK profiles are transient. During the time interval between 15 min (after both ligands have evoked similar peak responses) and 60 min (when responses return to basal levels), the time-averaged nuclear ppERK concentration is about 1.5-fold larger for HRG than for EGF (represented by the shaded areas in Figures 3B and 3C). The difference between the EGF and HRG responses during this time window is highly significant (a one-tailed, two-sample t test gives p = 0.0084). Notably, this difference is similar to the difference between the peak magnitudes of the downstream HRG- and EGF-induced c-fos and dusp mRNA expressions (Figures 1J and 1K). Thus, the time-averaged nuclear ppERK activity is a biochemical indicator of downstream immediate early mRNA responses. (A) Model predictions for nuclear ppERK time courses. Ligand concentrations are 10 nM (EGF, blue; HRG, red). (B and C) Quantified nuclear ppERK dynamics based on cell images obtained from Duolink technology (EGF, blue; HRG, red; representative images are shown in Figure S3A). Each data point is the average response based on ∼180 individual cells in three independent experiments, and error bars correspond to standard error based on the three replicates. Solid lines denote in silico simulations, and dashed lines denote simulation standard deviation. For normalization, raw quantified data are divided by the 5 min time point of each respective ligand dose. Shading corresponds to the nuclear ppERK profile between 15 and 60 min. (D) Spatially resolved ERK activation dynamics observed by immunofluorescence. Total ERK (green) is shown on the right, and ppERK (red) is shown on the left. (E, F, K, and L) Measured versus predicted effects of dusp downregulation on c-fos mRNA expression induced by 10 nM EGF (E and K) or HRG (F and L). Solid and dashed lines correspond to model simulations and their standard deviation, respectively. The dusp downregulation was modeled as an increase in the dusp mRNA degradation rate. Simulations in (E) and (F) correspond to the initial model (Figure 1E, black lines only), and simulations in (K) and (L) correspond to the refined model (Figure 1E, black and orange lines). (G and H) c-fos mRNA expression in response to two 1 nM pulses of EGF (G) or HRG (H). Arrows denote the second stimulation time. (I and J) Effects of cycloheximide on c-fos mRNA expression induced by 10 nM EGF (I) or 10 nM HRG (J). For (E)–(L), error bars denote the standard error from three independent experiments. Note that (I) and (J) have different y axis scales. In (E), (F), and (I)–(L), data values are relative to their respective 30 min HRG control point. Solid and dashed lines correspond to model simulations and their standard deviation, respectively. Simulations done with the refined model are indicated. See also Figure S3. The model predicts that dusp downregulation increases both the duration and magnitude of c-fos mRNA expression for HRG, while increasing only the response magnitude for EGF (Figures 2C and 2D). To test this experimentally, we downregulated the major nuclear inducible dusps by small interfering RNA (siRNA). In MCF-7 cells, dusps 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, and 10 are induced, but expression levels of dusps 8 and 10 for HRG are relatively small compared to those of dusps 1,"

Fundamental questions remain unanswered about astrocyte calcium signaling, as current methods can not resolve calcium in small volume compartments, such as near the cell membrane and in distal cell processes. We modified the genetically encoded calcium sensor GCaMP2 with a membrane-tethering domain, Lck, increasing the level of Lck-GCaMP2 near the plasma membrane tenfold as compared with conventional GCaMP2. Using Lck-GCaMP2 in rat hippocampal astrocyte-neuron cocultures, we measured near-membrane calcium signals that were evoked pharmacologically or by single action potential-mediated neurotransmitter release. Moreover, we identified highly localized and frequent spontaneous calcium signals in astrocyte somata and processes that conventional GCaMP2 failed to detect. Lck-GCaMP2 acts as a genetically targeted calcium sensor for monitoring calcium signals in previously inaccessible parts of astrocytes, including fine processes."

https://openalex.org/W2043258353,"The transcription factor ATF5 is associated with malignancy in glioblastomas. In this report, the authors devise a unique shRNA screen to identify and characterize the upstream regulators and downstream effectors of ATF5 in brain tumors. ATF5 upregulation is mediated by a concomitant increase in FRS2, PAK1 and CREB3L2 and promotes survival by elevating Mcl1 expression. This pathway represents a novel therapeutic target validated by the antitumor efficiency of the Raf kinase inhibitor sorafenib. Activating transcription factor-5 (ATF5) is highly expressed in malignant glioma and has a key role in promoting cell survival. Here we perform a genome-wide RNAi screen to identify transcriptional regulators of ATF5. Our results reveal an essential survival pathway in malignant glioma, whereby activation of a RAS–mitogen-activated protein kinase or phosphoinositide-3-kinase signaling cascade leads to induction of the transcription factor cAMP response element–binding protein-3–like-2 (CREB3L2), which directly activates ATF5 expression. ATF5, in turn, promotes survival by stimulating transcription of myeloid cell leukemia sequence-1 (MCL1), an antiapoptotic B cell leukemia-2 family member. Analysis of human malignant glioma samples indicates that ATF5 expression inversely correlates with disease prognosis. The RAF kinase inhibitor sorafenib suppresses ATF5 expression in glioma stem cells and inhibits malignant glioma growth in cell culture and mouse models. Our results demonstrate that ATF5 is essential in malignant glioma genesis and reveal that the ATF5-mediated survival pathway described here provides potential therapeutic targets for treatment of malignant glioma."

The allograft response was followed for two weeks in a mouse model in which pancreatic islet transplants were placed beneath the renal capsule. This approach may help to develop treatment options that improve transplantation outcomes. Here we present methods to longitudinally track islet allograft–infiltrating T cells in live mice by endoscopic confocal microscopy and to analyze circulating T cells by in vivo flow cytometry. We developed a new reporter mouse whose T cell subsets express distinct, 'color-coded' proteins enabling in vivo detection and identification of effector T cells (Teff cells) and discrimination between natural and induced regulatory T cells (nTreg and iTreg cells). Using these tools, we observed marked differences in the T cell response in recipients receiving tolerance-inducing therapy (CD154-specific monoclonal antibody plus rapamycin) compared to untreated controls. These results establish real-time cell tracking as a powerful means to probe the dynamic cellular interplay mediating immunologic rejection or transplant tolerance."

The relative importance of respiratory chain defects, ROS production, and apoptosis in the pathogenesis of CoQ10 deficiency is unknown. We determined previously that severe CoQ10 deficiency in cultured skin fibroblasts harboring COQ2 and PDSS2 mutations produces divergent alterations of bioenergetics and oxidative stress. Here, to better understand the pathogenesis of CoQ10 deficiency, we have characterized the effects of varying severities of CoQ10 deficiency on ROS production and mitochondrial bioenergetics in cells harboring genetic defects of CoQ10 biosynthesis. Levels of CoQ10 seem to correlate with ROS production;10-15% and >60% residual CoQ10 are not associated with significant ROS production, whereas 30-50% residual CoQ10 is accompanied by increased ROS production and cell death. Our results confirm that varying degrees of CoQ10 deficiency cause variable defects of ATP synthesis and oxidative stress. These findings may lead to more rational therapeutic strategies for CoQ10 deficiency.— Quinzii, C. M., Lopez, L. C., Gilkerson, R. W., Dorado, B., Coku, J., Naini, A.

https://openalex.org/W2024160713,"A nitrated guanine nucleotide, 8-nitroguanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-nitro-cGMP), is formed via nitric oxide (NO) and causes protein S-guanylation. However, intracellular 8-nitro-cGMP levels and mechanisms of formation of 8-nitro-cGMP and S-guanylation are yet to be identified. In this study, we precisely quantified NO-dependent formation of 8-nitro-cGMP in C6 glioma cells via liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Treatment of cells with S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine led to a rapid, transient increase in cGMP, after which 8-nitro-cGMP increased linearly up to a peak value comparable with that of cGMP at 24 h and declined thereafter. Markedly high levels (>40 microm) of 8-nitro-cGMP were also evident in C6 cells that had been stimulated to express inducible NO synthase with excessive NO production. The amount of 8-nitro-cGMP generated was comparable with or much higher than that of cGMP, whose production profile slightly preceded 8-nitro-cGMP formation in the activated inducible NO synthase-expressing cells. These unexpectedly large amounts of 8-nitro-cGMP suggest that GTP (a substrate of cGMP biosynthesis), rather than cGMP per se, may undergo guanine nitration. Also, 8-nitro-cGMP caused S-guanylation of KEAP1 in cells, which led to Nrf2 activation and subsequent induction of antioxidant enzymes, including heme oxygenase-1; thus, 8-nitro-cGMP protected cells against cytotoxic effects of hydrogen peroxide. Proteomic analysis for endogenously modified KEAP1 with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight-tandem mass spectrometry revealed that 8-nitro-cGMP S-guanylated the Cys(434) of KEAP1. The present report is therefore the first substantial corroboration of the biological significance of cellular 8-nitro-cGMP formation and potential roles of 8-nitro-cGMP in the Nrf2-dependent antioxidant response."
https://openalex.org/W1990202372,"Renal cytochrome P450 (CYP)-derived epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) regulate sodium transport and blood pressure. Although endothelial CYP-derived EETs are potent vasodilators, their contribution to the regulation of blood pressure remains unclear. Consequently, we developed transgenic mice with endothelial expression of the human CYP2J2 and CYP2C8 epoxygenases to increase endothelial EET biosynthesis. Compared to wild-type littermate controls, an attenuated afferent arteriole constrictor response to endothelin-1 and enhanced dilator response to acetylcholine was observed in CYP2J2 and CYP2C8 transgenic mice. CYP2J2 and CYP2C8 transgenic mice demonstrated modestly, but not significantly, lower mean arterial pressure under basal conditions compared to wild-type controls. However, mean arterial pressure was significantly lower in both CYP2J2 and CYP2C8 transgenic mice during coadministration of N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester and indomethacin. In a separate experiment, a high-salt diet and subcutaneous angiotensin II was administered over 4 wk. The angiotensin/high-salt-induced increase in systolic blood pressure, proteinuria, and glomerular injury was significantly attenuated in CYP2J2 and CYP2C8 transgenic mice compared to wild-type controls. Collectively, these data demonstrate that increased endothelial CYP epoxygenase expression attenuates afferent arteriolar constrictor reactivity and hypertension-induced increases in blood pressure and renal injury in mice. We conclude that endothelial CYP epoxygenase function contributes to the regulation of blood pressure."

We used NMR spectroscopy to establish the molecular structure of these Hyp-AGs, which share common features: (i) a galactan main chain composed of two 1→3 β-linked trigalactosyl blocks linked by a β-1→6 bond; (ii) bifurcated side chains with Ara, Rha, GlcUA, and a Gal 6-linked to Gal-1 and Gal-2 of the main-chain trigalactosyl repeats; (iii) a common side chain structure composed of up to six residues, the largest consisting of an α-l-Araf-(1→5)-α-l-Araf-(1→3)-α-l-Araf-(1→3- unit and an α-l-Rhap-(1→4)-β-d-GlcUAp-(1→6)-unit, both linked to Gal.

Ala-Hyp-polysaccharide-1 consisted of a 5-residue 1,3-β-d-Gal backbone interrupted by a single β-1,6 linkage connecting Gal-3 and Gal-4 (numbered from the reducing end). Galactose residues 1 and 2 had small-bifurcated side-chain substituents at C-6. The side chains possessed a single β-d-Gal di-substituted at C-3 with α-l-arabinose di- or trisaccharides and at C-6 with β-d-glucuronic acid or α-l-rhamnosylglucuronic acid (12Tan L. Leykam J.F.

We proposed that ∼15-residue repetitive blocks of decorated β-(1–3) trigalactosyl subunits connected by β-1,6 linkages create the larger arabinogalactan polysaccharides of AGPs, consistent with the small blocks separated by periodate-sensitive residues suggested earlier (16Churms S.C.

Plant Physiol. 1983; 34: 47-70Crossref Google Scholar). As type II arabinogalactans are often considered intractably complex, and because Ala-Hyp-polysaccharide-1 was only a single example of a Hyp-AG subunit, we determined the structure of three additional Hyp-AGs derived from two different AGP motifs, repetitive Ala-Hyp and Ser-Hyp. Two of the Hyp-AGs designated interferon-polysaccharide-1 (interferon Hyp-polysaccharide 1) and interferon-polysaccharide-2 were isolated from a fusion glycoprotein of human interferon α2b fused to a (Ser-Hyp)20 AGP glycomodule (18Xu J. Tan L. Goodrum K.J. Kieliszewski M.J. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2007; 97: 997-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The third Hyp-AG, designated Ala-Hyp polysaccharide-2, was isolated from (Ala-Hyp)51-GFP similar to Ala-Hyp-polysaccharide-1 described earlier (15Tan L. Qiu F. Lamport D.T. Kieliszewski M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13156-13165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Here we identified the fundamental similarities between these Hyp-arabinogalactans and determined if the non-glycosylated domains (interferon α2 versus GFP) or AGP motifs (Ser-Hyp versus Ala-Hyp repeats) influenced the glycan structure. Significantly, the six-residue galactan backbone of these new Hyp-AGs consisted of two β-1,3-linked galactosyl trisaccharides connected by a β-1,6 linkage. Such “decorated” ∼15-residue trisaccharide subunits likely constitute the fundamental building blocks of type II arabinogalactan polysaccharides; hence, they are far less complex than commonly supposed (4Seifert G.J.

NMR experiments were carried out either at 55 °C on a Bruker DMX-800 equipped with a cryoprobe or at 25 °C on a Bruker DMX-600 spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance probe and three-axis gradient coils. The parallel data sets include one-dimensional 1H, two-dimensional 1H-homonuclear correlation spectroscopy (COSY), total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) (mixing time 60 and 90 ms), rotating frame NOE spectroscopy (ROESY) (200 ms), and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) (mixing time 150, 300 and 500 ms), and two-dimensional 13C,1H heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) and heteronuclear multiple bond coherence (HMBC) NMR spectra. In addition, several more interferon Hyp-polysaccharide-1 experiments were recorded in an effort to resolve assignment ambiguities such as magnitude COSY with one-, two-, and three-step relay transfer and two-dimensional 13C,1H heteronuclear HSQC-TOCSY and HSQC-NOESY together with diffusion-ordered spectroscopy for measuring the diffusion constant. Water suppression was achieved by either presaturation or WATERGATE techniques. Data were processed with NMRPipe (21Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol.

Interferon Hyp-polysaccharide-1 was constructed in an arbitrary extended conformation using the LEaP module of Amber 10 (23Case D.A. Darden T.A. Cheatham T.E. Simmerling C.L. Wang J. Duke R.E. Luo R.

Hornak V. Cui G. Mathews D.H. Seetin M.G. Sagui C. Babin V. Kollman P.A. AMBER 10. University of California, San Francisco.2008Google Scholar). The starting model was subjected to a restrained simulated annealing conformational search protocol to obtain an ensemble of structures consistent with the NMR data. All assigned NOESY cross-peaks were classified as strong (1.8–2.7 Å), medium (1.8–3.7 Å), weak (1.8–5.0 Å), and very weak (1.8–6.0 Å) interproton distance restraints according to their intensities. Beyond these bounds, a quadratic penalty potential was applied with a force constant of 20 kcal mol−1 Å−2. A total of 49 distance restraints were used for interferon Hyp-polysaccharide-1 of which 34 were assigned non-ambiguously to protons in sequential residues. Cross-peaks that correspond to non-sequential assignments gave rise to ambiguous restraints where either more than one proton pair contributes to the NOESY volume or unambiguous assignment was not possible. Ambiguous peaks were interpreted as an < r−6 >−1/6 averaged value of the contributing interproton distances. For a restrained molecular dynamics conformational search, initial models were energy-minimized without restraints and subjected to 200 simulated annealing cycles. A cycle started from the structure obtained in the previous cycle and included 10-ps heating from 300 to 1000 K followed by an equilibration of 10 ps at 1000 K without any restraints applied. The force constants for all restraints were then scaled gradually from 0 to the final values during 20 ps at 1000 K followed by cooling the system to 300 K over 30 ps. Atomic interactions within the system were calculated using the Glycam06 parameter set for sugars (24Kirschner K.N. Yongye A.B. Tschampel S.M. González-Outeiriño J. Daniels C.R. Foley B.L. Woods R.J. J. Comput. Chem. 2008; 29: 622-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar) and Generalized Born solvation (igb = 2) with monovalent salt concentration corresponding to 0.1 m. The last structures in each cycle were energy-minimized using the same parameters and restraints as described above. Ten best models for an average structure were selected based on NMR restraint violations and the potential energy of the molecule to undergo further refinement in explicit water and counterion environment. Each of these model structures was placed in a truncated octahedral box of about 5000 TIP3P water molecules and two K+ counterions to neutralize the total charge. In one case we used Ca2+ to neutralize the charge of the uronic acids. Parameters related to water and counterions were taken from the standard Amber libraries. The system was energy-minimized and then heated to 300 K at constant volume during 50 ps, whereas the solute was kept under positional restraints with a force constant of 25 kcal mol−1 Å−2. The positional restraints were gradually removed over 300 ps at constant pressure (1 atm) and temperature (300 K), and a production phase was initiated for 2 ns with the full set of restraints applied. The final structures were energy-minimized and used for subsequent analysis. The hydrodynamic radius was calculated for the model structures using HYDROPRO Version 7c2 (25García De La Torre J.

The Structures of Interferon Hyp-polysaccharide-1, interferon Hyp-polysaccharide-2, and Ala-Hyp-polysaccharide-2 were determined based on earlier composition analyses and on the chemical shifts (15Tan L.

Shpak E. Gu T. Moo-Young M. Kieliszewski M.J. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2005; 90: 578-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Two subfractions were chosen for structural analyses; one contained the major Hyp-AG species, designated Interferon Hyp-polysaccharide-1, with 22 glycosyl residues estimated by the Hyp to monosaccharide molar ratios, and a second fraction contained a smaller, less abundant Hyp-arabinogalactan of 20 glycosyl residues, designated interferon Hyp-polysaccharide-2. The integrated areas in the anomeric region in a one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum (Fig. 1) corroborated the molar ratios Hyp Gal10 Ara8 GlcU2 Rha2 of interferon Hyp-polysaccharide-1 (26Xu J. Shpak E. Gu T. Moo-Young M. Kieliszewski M.J. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2005; 90: 578-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), confirming interferon Hyp-polysaccharide-1 as a 22-residue arabinogalactan attached to Hyp. The anomeric configurations were confirmed by the corresponding anomeric carbon signals in the HSQC spectrum (Fig. 2, supplemental Table I). Interferon Hyp-polysaccharide-1 contained a total of eight α-l-Araf residues; 6 of the 8 α-Araf residues were either terminal, 1,5-linked, or 1,3-linked (∼5.25 ppm), and 2 gave signals that were consistent with being both terminal and 1→ 5-linked to l-Araf residues (5.087 ppm). Interferon Hyp-polysaccharide-1 also contained 2 α-l-Rhap residues (4.797 ppm), 2 β-d-GlcUAp residues (∼4.5 ppm), and a total of 10 β-d-Galp residues; 1 was O-linked to Hyp (4.57 ppm), 5 were consistent with a galactan backbone (∼ 4.70 ppm) (15Tan L.

The chemical shift at 4.786 ppm identified 4-H of Hyp.FIGURE 2HSQC spectrum of Hyp-AG Interferon Hyp-polysaccharide-1 at 55 °C. Cross-peaks A and B were assigned to H-1/C-1 of α-l-Ara, C to H-1/C-1 of α-l-Rha, D to the H-1/C-1 of β-d-Gal residues of the galactan backbone, and E to H-1/C-1 of β-d-Gal linked to Hyp. Cross-peak F was assigned to H-1/C-1 of β-d-GlcUA residues, G to H-1/C-1 of side-chain β-d-Gal, H to H-4/C-4 of Hyp, I to H-2/C-2 of Hyp, and J to H-5/C-5 of Hyp.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Signals arising from the Hyp residue were also identified in the TOCSY (supplemental Fig. 1) and HSQC spectra (Fig. 2). The chemical shifts are shown in supplemental Table I. The H-4 and C-4 resonances characteristic of non-glycosylated Hyp shifted downfield from 4.62 and 70.6 to 4.786 and 78.02 ppm, respectively, judging from the HSQC spectrum. This indicated that the hydroxyl group of Hyp was galactosylated (15Tan L. Qiu F. Lamport D.T. Kieliszewski M.J. J. Biol.

The HMBC spectrum (Fig. 3) confirmed this in cross-peak G, which arose from C-4 of Hyp (78.02 ppm) and H-1 of a β-d-Galp residue (4.57) ppm, designated G1 in Fig. 4 and supplemental Table I.FIGURE 4Interferon Hyp-polysaccharide-1 and its canonical side chain.a, the primary structure of the 22-residue Hyp-arabinogalactan Interferon Hyp-polysaccharide-1 is shown.

Four of the five backbone Gal residues were 3-linked to each other and to G1, as deduced from cross-peaks E in the HMBC spectrum (Fig. 3), which correlated backbone Gal H-1 signals with backbone Gal 3-C signals. A fifth backbone Gal participated in a 1→ 6 linkage to another backbone Gal residue deduced from cross-peak F in the HMBC spectrum. Thus, based on our earlier work (15Tan L. Qiu F. Lamport D.T. Kieliszewski M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13156-13165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and the NMR spectra presented here, the interferon Hyp-polysaccharide-1 galactan backbone had the structure β-d-Galp-(1→3)-β-d-Galp-(1→3)-β-d-Galp-(1→6)-β-d-Galp-(1→3)-β-d-Galp-(1→3)-β-d-Galp-(1→4)-O-Hyp. The final 4 of the 10 Gal residues of interferon Hyp-polysaccharide-1 occurred in side chains (designated Ga, Gb, Gc, Gd in supplemental Table I and FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5) linked 1→6 to the backbone Gal residues. This was deduced from one-dimensional 1H and two-dimensional 13C,1H HMBC spectra. Resonances at 4.40–4.54 ppm in the one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum were consistent with four Gal side chains attached to the galactan backbone (15Tan L. Qiu F. Lamport D.T. Kieliszewski M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13156-13165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and cross-peaks I and J in the HMBC spectrum indicated that the four side-chain Gal residues were 1→6 linked to backbone Gal residues. The two α-l-Rha residues, designated R1 and R2, were terminal, deduced by a comparison of their assigned chemical shifts (supplemental Table I) obtained from TOCSY (supplemental Fig. 1) and HSQC spectra (Fig. 2) with those of earlier characterized Ala-Hyp-polysaccharide-1 (15Tan L. Qiu F. Lamport D.T. Kieliszewski M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13156-13165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Rhamnose residues R1 and R2 were linked to O-4 of β-d-GlcUAp (UA1 and UA2 of supplemental Table I), deduced from cross-peak D in the HMBC spectrum (Fig. 3). Cross-peak H in the HMBC spectrum indicated side-chain Gal residues were substituted at O-6 with glucuronic acid residues UA1 and UA2. The same chemical shifts arising from α-l-Rhap, β-d-GlcUAp, and side-chain β-d-Galp residues were identified earlier on side-chain Gal residues in Ala-Hyp-polysaccharide-1 (15Tan L. Qiu F. Lamport D.T. Kieliszewski M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13156-13165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This indicated the side chains were attached to backbone Gal residues nearest Hyp; therefore, we assigned the two Rha-(1→4)-GlcUA subunits to side-chain Gal residues closest to Hyp, Ga, and Gb (supplemental Table I and FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5) to give two side chains: α-l-Rhap-(1→4)-β-d-GlcUAp-(1→6)-β-d-Ga and -Gb. The Ara residues occurred in small side chains that were 3-linked to the side-chain Gal residues. The HMBC spectrum cross-peak A identified Ara 5-linked to another Ara (Fig. 3). It arose from H-1 of α-l-Araf residues (5.087 ppm, A1 and A4 in Fig. 4a) and 5-C of other Ara residues (67.1 ppm, A2 and A5 in Fig. 4a) This was consistent with the one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum that indicated there were two Ara-(1→5)-Ara linkages in interferon Hyp-polysaccharide-1. HMBC signals arising from the ring carbon atoms of A1 and A4 (C-2, C-3, and C-4) showed that they were terminal residues (15Tan L. Qiu F. Lamport D.T. Kieliszewski M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13156-13165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar); hence, two diarabinosyl structures occurred having the structure α-l-Araf-(1→5)-α-l-Araf-(1→). The HSQC C-1/H-1 signals at 109.2 ppm and ∼5.25 ppm arose from six Ara residues (A2, A3, A5, A6, A7, A8 in supplemental Table I, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5) and indicated two other types of linkages in the arabinose side chains. Cross-peak B in the HMBC spectrum indicated linkage of α-l-Araf to O-3 of another α-l-Araf residue (3-C signal at 83.88 ppm) as in the structure α-l-Araf-(1→3)-α-l-Araf (i.e. A2 to A3 and A5 to A6), whereas cross-peak C indicated α-l-Araf-(1→3)-β-d-Gal linkages (side-chain Gal residues Ga-d in supplemental Table I). The side-chain Gal H-3 chemical shifts (∼3.73 ppm) (15Tan L. Qiu F. Lamport D.T. Kieliszewski M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13156-13165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) present in the TOCSY spectrum (supplemental Fig. 1) indicated each of the four side-chain Gal residues was O-3 substituted. As four Ara residues were attached to Gal, and the other four occurred in two α-l-Araf-(1→5)-α-l-Araf-(1→ units, we concluded that two of the arabinosyl side chains had the structure α-l-Araf-(1→5)-α-l-Araf-(1→3)-α-l-Araf-(1→3)-Galsc, and two had the structure α-l-Araf-(1→3)-Galsc. A comparison of the interferon Hyp-polysaccharide-1 HSQC and HMBC spectra with those of Ala-Hyp-polysaccharide-1 (15Tan L. Qiu F. Lamport D.T. Kieliszewski M.J. J. Biol.

Furthermore, the signals from Ga and Gb in Interferon Hyp-polysaccharide-1 were identical"
https://openalex.org/W1979939707,"Biological sulfate reduction is a process with high environmental significance due to its major contribution to the carbon and sulfur cycles in anaerobic environments. However, the respiratory chain of sulfate-reducing bacteria is still poorly understood. Here we describe a new respiratory complex that was isolated as a major protein present in the membranes of Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough. The complex, which was named Qrc, is the first representative of a new family of redox complexes. It has three subunits related to the complex iron-sulfur molybdoenzyme family and a multiheme cytochrome c and binds six hemes c, one [3Fe-4S](+1/0) cluster, and several interacting [4Fe-4S](2+/1+) clusters but no molybdenum. Qrc is related to the alternative complex III, and we show that it has the reverse catalytic activity, acting as a Type I cytochrome c(3):menaquinone oxidoreductase. The qrc genes are found in the genomes of deltaproteobacterial sulfate reducers, which have periplasmic hydrogenases and formate dehydrogenases that lack a membrane subunit for reduction of the quinone pool. In these organisms, Qrc acts as a menaquinone reductase with electrons from periplasmic hydrogen or formate oxidation. Binding of a menaquinone analogue affects the EPR spectrum of the [3Fe-4S](+1/0) cluster, indicating the presence of a quinone-binding site close to the periplasmic subunits. Qrc is the first respiratory complex from sulfate reducers to have its physiological function clearly elucidated."

Here, the authors find that these cells are indeed generated in diencephalic ventricular zone and that they then migrate tangentially into telencephalon to colonize certain nuclei of the amygdala. Neurons usually migrate and differentiate in one particular encephalic vesicle. We identified a murine population of diencephalic neurons that colonized the telencephalic amygdaloid complex, migrating along a tangential route that crosses a boundary between developing brain vesicles. The diencephalic transcription factor OTP was necessary for this migratory behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2082727114,"We report the identification of McpS as the specific chemoreceptor for 6 tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates and butyrate in Pseudomonas putida. The analysis of the bacterial mutant deficient in mcpS and complementation assays demonstrate that McpS is the only chemoreceptor of TCA cycle intermediates in the strain under study. TCA cycle intermediates are abundantly present in root exudates, and taxis toward these compounds is proposed to facilitate the access to carbon sources. McpS has an unusually large ligand-binding domain (LBD) that is un-annotated in InterPro and is predicted to contain 6 helices. The ligand profile of McpS was determined by isothermal titration calorimetry of purified recombinant LBD (McpS-LBD). McpS recognizes TCA cycle intermediates but does not bind very close structural homologues and derivatives like maleate, aspartate, or tricarballylate. This implies that functional similarity of ligands, such as being part of the same pathway, and not structural similarity is the primary element, which has driven the evolution of receptor specificity. The magnitude of chemotactic responses toward these 7 chemoattractants, as determined by qualitative and quantitative chemotaxis assays, differed largely. Ligands that cause a strong chemotactic response (malate, succinate, and fumarate) were found by differential scanning calorimetry to increase significantly the midpoint of protein unfolding (T(m)) and unfolding enthalpy (DeltaH) of McpS-LBD. Equilibrium sedimentation studies show that malate, the chemoattractant that causes the strongest chemotactic response, stabilizes the dimeric state of McpS-LBD. In this respect clear parallels exist to the Tar receptor and other eukaryotic receptors, which are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2025286047,"Cytosolic 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (FDH, ALDH1L1) is an abundant enzyme of folate metabolism. It converts 10-formyltetrahydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and CO(2) in an NADP(+)-dependent reaction. We have identified a gene at chromosome locus 12q24.11 of the human genome, the product of which has 74% sequence similarity with cytosolic FDH. This protein has an extra N-terminal sequence of 22 amino acid residues, predicted to be a mitochondrial translocation signal. Transfection of COS-7 or A549 cell lines with a construct in which green fluorescent protein was introduced between the leader sequence and the rest of the putative mitochondrial FDH (mtFDH) has demonstrated mitochondrial localization of the fusion protein, suggesting that the identified gene encodes a mitochondrial enzyme. Purified pig liver mtFDH displayed dehydrogenase/hydrolase activities similar to cytosolic FDH. Real-time PCR performed on an array of human tissues has shown that although cytosolic FDH mRNA is highest in liver, kidney, and pancreas, mtFDH mRNA is most highly expressed in pancreas, heart, and brain. In contrast to the cytosolic enzyme, which is not detectable in cancer cells, the presence of mtFDH was demonstrated in several human cancer cell lines by conventional and real-time PCR and by Western blot. Analysis of genomes of different species indicates that the mitochondrial enzyme is a later evolutionary product when compared with the cytosolic enzyme. We propose that this novel mitochondrial enzyme is a likely source of CO(2) production from 10-formyltetrahydrofolate in mitochondria and plays an essential role in the distribution of one-carbon groups between the cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments of the cell."

To clarify mechanisms by which cAMP regulates insulin secretion, we performed parallel evanescent wave fluorescence imaging of [cAMP]pm, [Ca2+]pm, and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) in the plasma membrane. This lipid is formed by autocrine insulin receptor activation and was used to monitor insulin release kinetics from single MIN6 β-cells. Elevation of the glucose concentration from 3 to 11 mm induced, after a 2.7-min delay, coordinated oscillations of [Ca2+]pm, [cAMP]pm, and PIP3. Inhibitors of protein kinase A (PKA) markedly diminished the PIP3 response when applied before glucose stimulation, but did not affect already manifested PIP3 oscillations. The reduced PIP3 response could be attributed to accelerated depolarization causing early rise of [Ca2+]pm that preceded the elevation of [cAMP]pm. However, the amplitude of the PIP3 response after PKA inhibition was restored by a specific agonist to the cAMP-dependent guanine nucleotide exchange factor Epac. Suppression of cAMP formation with adenylyl cyclase inhibitors reduced already established PIP3 oscillations in glucose-stimulated cells, and this effect was almost completely counteracted by the Epac agonist. In cells treated with small interfering RNA targeting Epac2, the amplitudes of the glucose-induced PIP3 oscillations were reduced, and the Epac agonist was without effect. The data indicate that temporal coordination of the triggering [Ca2+]pm and amplifying [cAMP]pm signals is important for glucose-induced pulsatile insulin release.

https://openalex.org/W2034052014,"gp130 is the shared signal-transducing receptor subunit for the large and important family of interleukin 6-like cytokines. Previous x-ray structures of ligand-receptor complexes of this family lack the three membrane-proximal domains that are essential for signal transduction. Here we report the crystal structure of the entire extracellular portion of human gp130 (domains 1–6, D1–D6) at 3.6 Å resolution, in an unliganded form, as well as a higher resolution structure of the membrane-proximal fibronectin type III domains (D4–D6) at 1.9 Å. This represents the first atomic resolution structure of the complete ectodomain of any ""tall"" cytokine receptor. These structures show that other than a reorientation of the D1 domain, there is little structural change in gp130 upon ligand binding. They also reveal that the interface between the D4 and D5 domains forms an acute bend in the gp130 structure. Key residues at this interface are highly conserved across the entire tall receptor family, suggesting that this acute bend may be a common feature of these receptors. Importantly, this geometry positions the C termini of the membrane-proximal fibronectin type III domains of the tall cytokine receptors in close proximity within the transmembrane complex, favorable for receptor-associated Janus kinases to trans-phosphorylate and activate each other."
https://openalex.org/W2077855194,"Hydrolytic editing activities are present in aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases possessing reduced amino acid discrimination in the synthetic reactions. Post-transfer hydrolysis of misacylated tRNA in class I editing enzymes occurs in a spatially separate domain inserted into the catalytic Rossmann fold, but the location and mechanisms of pre-transfer hydrolysis of misactivated amino acids have been uncertain. Here, we use novel kinetic approaches to distinguish among three models for pre-transfer editing by Escherichia coli isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS). We demonstrate that tRNA-dependent hydrolysis of noncognate valyl-adenylate by IleRS is largely insensitive to mutations in the editing domain of the enzyme and that noncatalytic hydrolysis after release is too slow to account for the observed rate of clearing. Measurements of the microscopic rate constants for amino acid transfer to tRNA in IleRS and the related valyl-tRNA synthetase (ValRS) further suggest that pre-transfer editing in IleRS is an enzyme-catalyzed activity residing in the synthetic active site. In this model, the balance between pre-transfer and post-transfer editing pathways is controlled by kinetic partitioning of the noncognate aminoacyl-adenylate. Rate constants for hydrolysis and transfer of a noncognate intermediate are roughly equal in IleRS, whereas in ValRS transfer to tRNA is 200-fold faster than hydrolysis. In consequence, editing by ValRS occurs nearly exclusively by post-transfer hydrolysis in the editing domain, whereas in IleRS both pre- and post-transfer editing are important. In both enzymes, the rates of amino acid transfer to tRNA are similar for cognate and noncognate aminoacyl-adenylates, providing a significant contrast with editing DNA polymerases."
https://openalex.org/W1982018332,"Human immune cells have to penetrate an endothelial barrier during their beneficial pursuit of infection and their destructive infiltration of tissues in autoimmune diseases. This transmigration requires Rap1 GTPase to activate integrin affinity. We define a new model system for this process by demonstrating, with live imaging and genetics, that during embryonic development Drosophila melanogaster immune cells penetrate an epithelial, Drosophila E-cadherin (DE-cadherin)-based tissue barrier. A mutant in RhoL, a GTPase homologue that is specifically expressed in haemocytes, blocks this invasive step but not other aspects of guided migration. RhoL mediates integrin adhesion caused by Drosophila Rap1 overexpression and moves Rap1 away from a concentration in the cytoplasm to the leading edge during invasive migration. These findings indicate that a programmed migratory step during Drosophila development bears striking molecular similarities to vertebrate immune cell transmigration during inflammation, and identify RhoL as a new regulator of invasion, adhesion and Rap1 localization. Our work establishes the utility of Drosophila for identifying novel components of immune cell transmigration and for understanding the in vivo interplay of immune cells with the barriers they penetrate."
https://openalex.org/W2021714443,"Intein splicing occurs in four steps, but the mechanisms controlling these steps — and thus preventing aberrant splicing — are unknown. Kinetic and NMR analysis of several complex constructs now identifies the rate limiting step as well as the conformational trigger that catalyzes this transformation. Protein splicing is a post-translational modification in which an intein domain excises itself out of a host protein. Here, we investigate how the steps in the splicing process are coordinated so as to maximize the production of the final splice products and minimize the generation of undesired cleavage products. Our approach has been to prepare a branched intermediate (and analogs thereof) of the Mycobacterium xenopi DNA gyrase A (Mxe GyrA) intein using protein semisynthesis. Kinetic analysis of these molecules indicates that the high fidelity of this protein-splicing reaction results from the penultimate step in the process (intein-succinimide formation) being rate-limiting. NMR experiments indicate that formation of the branched intermediate affects the local structure around the amide bond that is cleaved during succinimide formation. We propose that this structural change reflects a reorganization of the catalytic apparatus to accelerate succinimide formation at the C-terminal splice junction."
https://openalex.org/W2050643794,"The processing and regulated secretion of IL-1beta are critical points of control of the biological activity of this important pro-inflammatory cytokine. IL-1beta is produced by both monocytes and macrophages, but the rate and mechanism of release differ according to the differentiation status and the origin of these cells. We aimed to study the control of processing and release in human blood monocytes and human monocyte-derived macrophages. Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced IL-1beta production and release were investigated for dependence upon caspase-1, P2X7 receptor activation, and loss of membrane asymmetry associated with microvesicle shedding. TLR agonists induced P2X7 receptor-dependent IL-1beta release in both monocytes and macrophages; however, only monocytes also showed P2X7 receptor-independent release of mature IL-1beta. Furthermore, in monocytes ATP-mediated PS exposure could be activated independently of IL-1beta production. Release of IL-1beta from monocytes showed selectivity for specific TLR agonists and was accelerated by P2X7 receptor activation. Human monocytes released more IL-1beta/cell than macrophages. These data have important implications for inflammatory diseases that involve monocyte activation and IL-1 release."
https://openalex.org/W2039827956,"G2/M checkpoint activation after DNA damage results in G2/M cell cycle arrest that allows time for DNA repair before the entry of cells into mitosis. Activation of G2/M checkpoint involves a series of signaling events, which include activation of ataxia telangiectecia-mutated and Rad3-related (ATR) and Chk1 kinases and inhibition of Cdc2/Cyclin B activity. Studies presented in this report show that serine (Ser)/threonine (Thr) protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) has an important role in G2/M checkpoint activation in response to γ-irradiation (IR) exposure. Using PP2A inhibitors, as well as siRNA targeting various forms of Ser/Thr protein phosphatases, results presented in this report show that specific PP2A inhibition abrogates IR-induced activation of ATR and Chk1 kinases, as well as phosphorylation of Cdc2-Tyr15, and attenuates IR-induced G2/M arrest. These results suggest an important regulation of PP2A on IR-induced G2/M checkpoint signaling response."
https://openalex.org/W2056987006,"Molecular dynamics simulations and implicit ligand sampling methods have identified trajectories and sites of high affinity for O(2) in the protein framework of the flavoprotein D-amino-acid oxidase (DAAO). A specific dynamic channel for the diffusion of O(2) leads from solvent to the flavin Si-side (amino acid substrate and product bind on the Re-side). Based on this, amino acids that flank the putative O(2) high affinity sites have been exchanged with bulky residues to introduce steric constraints. In G52V DAAO, the valine side chain occupies the site that in wild-type DAAO has the highest O(2) affinity. In this variant, the reactivity of the reduced enzyme with O(2) is decreased >or=100-fold and the turnover number approximately 1000-fold thus verifying the concept. In addition, the simulations have identified a chain of three water molecules that might serve in relaying a H(+) from the product imino acid =NH(2)(+) group bound on the flavin Re-side to the developing peroxide on the Si-side. This function would be comparable with that of a similarly located histidine in the flavoprotein glucose oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W2149927556,"The 3C-like proteinase (3CL(pro)) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus plays a vital role in virus maturation and is proposed to be a key target for drug design against SARS. Various in vitro studies revealed that only the dimer of the matured 3CL(pro) is active. However, as the internally encoded 3CL(pro) gets matured from the replicase polyprotein by autolytic cleavage at both the N-terminal and the C-terminal flanking sites, it is unclear whether the polyprotein also needs to dimerize first for its autocleavage reaction. We constructed a large protein containing the cyan fluorescent protein (C), the N-terminal flanking substrate peptide of SARS 3CL(pro) (XX), SARS 3CL(pro) (3CLP), and the yellow fluorescent protein (Y) to study the autoprocessing of 3CL(pro) using fluorescence resonance energy transfer. In contrast to the matured 3CL(pro), the polyprotein, as well as the one-step digested product, 3CLP-Y-His, were shown to be monomeric in gel filtration and analytic ultracentrifuge analysis. However, dimers can still be induced and detected when incubating these large proteins with a substrate analog compound in both chemical cross-linking experiments and analytic ultracentrifuge analysis. We also measured enzyme activity under different enzyme concentrations and found a clear tendency of substrate-induced dimer formation. Based on these discoveries, we conclude that substrate-induced dimerization is essential for the activity of SARS-3CL(pro) in the polyprotein, and a modified model for the 3CL(pro) maturation process was proposed. As many viral proteases undergo a similar maturation process, this model might be generally applicable."
https://openalex.org/W2132103968,"The biosynthesis of most membrane proteins is directly coupled to membrane insertion, and therefore, molecular chaperones are not required.

Upon arrival in the stroma, LHCPs form a soluble transit complex with the chloroplast signal recognition particle (cpSRP) consisting of an SRP54 homolog and the unique cpSRP43 composed of three chromodomains and four ankyrin repeats.

IntroductionMany proteins fold spontaneously in vitro in agreement with Anfinsen's pioneering studies that showed that the information for protein folding resides in the primary structure (55Anfinsen C.B. Science. 1973; 181: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (5079) Google Scholar). However, in vivo folding of soluble proteins often requires molecular chaperones to efficiently reach the native functional state (1Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 574-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). The folding of proteins can start during their synthesis assisted by ribosome-associated chaperones that act on the nascent polypeptide chain (2Kramer G. Boehringer D. Ban N. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Most membrane proteins utilize the ribosome-bound signal recognition particle (SRP) 2The abbreviations used are: SRPsignal recognition particlecpSRPsignal recognition particleLHClight-harvesting complexLHCPlight-harvesting chlorophyll a,b-binding proteinCBBCoomassie Brilliant Blue RTMtransmembrane helixCDchromodomainGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseGdmClguanidinium chlorideDTTdithiothreitolTFtrigger factorRbcRubiscoRubiscoribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase. for co-translational targeting to the plasma membrane in prokaryotes and the endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotes, which allows coupling membrane protein biosynthesis directly to membrane insertion (3Grudnik P. Bange G. Sinning I. Biol. Chem. 2009; 390: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 4Cross B.C. Sinning I. Luirink J. High S. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Microbiol. 2005; 59: 329-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In this way, aggregation and misfolding of membrane proteins in the cytoplasm are prevented. Nuclear encoded membrane proteins destined for organelles, e.g. mitochondria or chloroplasts, however, are excluded from the “classical” co-translational targeting and insertion mechanisms. Recently an endoplasmic reticulum- and Golgi-mediated protein targeting pathway to the chloroplast for soluble, glycosylated proteins was described (6Villarejo A. Burén S. Larsson S. Déjardin A. Monné M. Rudhe C. Karlsson J. Jansson S. Lerouge P. Rolland N. von Heijne G. Grebe M. Bako L. Samuelsson G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1224-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 7Nanjo Y.

Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 385-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, it is not known at present whether this pathway is also used to target chloroplast membrane proteins.Prominent examples of post-translationally targeted membrane proteins are the light-harvesting chlorophyll a,b-binding proteins (LHCPs) that serve as antenna proteins in photosynthesis and represent one of the most abundant membrane proteins on earth. After synthesis in the cytoplasm, they are imported across the two chloroplast envelope membranes utilizing the TOC/TIC import machinery (9Soll J. Schleiff E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 10Kessler F. Schnell D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2009; 21: 494-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Upon arrival in the stroma, LHCPs are sequestered into a soluble, so-called transit complex with the chloroplast signal recognition particle (cpSRP), consisting of cpSRP54 and a novel protein component, cpSRP43 (11Schuenemann D. Gupta S. Persello-Cartieaux F. Klimyuk V.I. Jones J.D. Nussaume L. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 10312-10316Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). LHCPs contain three transmembrane helices (TM1–3) to which carotenoids and chlorophylls are attached upon thylakoid insertion to form the light-harvesting complexes (LHCs) that are active mainly as trimers (12Schmid V.H. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 3619-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 13Barros T. Kühlbrandt W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1787: 753-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of LHCP folding in vitro have been analyzed extensively (14Paulsen H. Rümler U. Rüdiger W. Planta. 1990; 181: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 15Booth P.J. Paulsen H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5103-5108Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 16Hobe S. Prytulla S. Kühlbrandt W. Paulsen H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3423-3429Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and unfolded LHCP was shown to be sufficient for chloroplast import but not for thylakoid insertion (17Yuan J. Henry R. Cline K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 8552-8556Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic TMs present a particular challenge as they are prone for aggregation and have to be kept in a conformation competent for subsequent membrane insertion and folding into a functional structure. This calls for a molecular chaperone that prevents LHCPs from aggregation in the stroma and allows membrane insertion. In early studies, a stromal factor was shown to be absolutely required for targeting and membrane insertion (17Yuan J. Henry R. Cline K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 8552-8556Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), but the factor remained unknown. Although in mitochondria insertion of the nuclear encoded multispanning membrane protein Oxa1 into the inner envelope was shown to require Hsp70 (18Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2217-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), neither Hsp70 nor Hsp60 supported thylakoid insertion of LHCP in chloroplasts (17Yuan J. Henry R. Cline K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 8552-8556Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 19Yalovsky S. Paulsen H. Michaeli D. Chitnis P.R. Nechushtai R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 5616-5619Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the meantime, cpSRP43 was identified as a novel component of cpSRP (11Schuenemann D. Gupta S. Persello-Cartieaux F. Klimyuk V.I. Jones J.D. Nussaume L. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 10312-10316Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). It consists of protein-protein interaction domains, three chromodomains, and four ankyrin repeats (20Klimyuk V.I. Persello-Cartieaux F. Havaux M. Contard-David P. Schuenemann D. Meiherhoff K.

Science. 2008; 321: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and interacts with a conserved region in LHCPs, the L18 region (L18) between TM2 and TM3 (22Tu C.J. Peterson E.C. Henry R. Hoffman N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13187-13190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). L18 is an internal targeting signal that allows LHCPs to interact with cpSRP43 in a highly specific manner, unlike the canonical interaction of signal sequences with SRP, which is not sequence-specific (3Grudnik P. Bange G. Sinning I. Biol. Chem. 2009; 390: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 4Cross B.C. Sinning I. Luirink J. High S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that a DPLG motif in L18 is strictly required for the interaction and wraps around a tyrosine hook in the ankyrin repeats of cpSRP43 (21Stengel K.F. Holdermann I. Cain P. Robinson C. Wild K. Sinning I. Science. 2008; 321: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The tyrosine seems to mimic the lutein headgroup of the carotenoid and to allow cofactor attachment upon LHCP membrane insertion (21Stengel K.F. Holdermann I. Cain P. Robinson C. Wild K. Sinning I. Science. 2008; 321: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The stoichiometry of the transit complex is not known, but in in vitro thylakoid insertion assays, both cpSRP43 and cpSRP54 are required for LHCP insertion, whereas in vivo, cpSRP43 alone seems sufficient when cpSRP54 and the SRP receptor cpFtsY are both knocked out (23Tzvetkova-Chevolleau T. Hutin C. Noël L.D. Goforth R. Carde J.P. Caffarri S. Sinning I. Groves M. Teulon J.M. Hoffman N.E. Henry R. Havaux M. Nussaume L.

This points to a central role for cpSRP43, with the C-terminal chromodomains (CD2–3) interacting with cpSRP54 (24Goforth R.L. Peterson E.C. Yuan J. Moore M.J. Kight A.D. Lohse M.B. Sakon J.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2217-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).Here we show that cpSRP43 is a novel molecular chaperone required for LHCP membrane insertion. cpSRP43 alone is able to form a soluble complex with LHCP and thereby is sufficient to prevent aggregation. The chaperone function resides in the ankyrin repeats of cpSRP43 and strictly requires the conserved DPLG motif in LHCPs. The role of cpSRP43 cannot be taken over by other stromal chaperones.DISCUSSIONPrevious experiments implicated that both cpSRP43 and cpSRP54 are required for the formation of a soluble transit complex with LHCP. Complex formation could not be observed when one of the subunits of cpSRP was missing (24Goforth R.L. Peterson E.C. Yuan J. Moore M.J. Kight A.D. Lohse M.B. Sakon J. Henry R.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2005; 280: 8912-8917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition, in cpSPR43 knock-out plants, the level of LHCP in the thylakoids was significantly reduced (20Klimyuk V.I. Persello-Cartieaux F. Havaux M. Contard-David P. Schuenemann D. Meiherhoff K. Gouet P. Jones J.D. Hoffman N.E. Nussaume L. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 87-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It is, however, unclear how the remaining LHCP is targeted and inserted in the absence of cpSRP43. We now show that cpSRP43 alone is sufficient to form a soluble complex with LHCP and to prevent aggregation. This supports a recent idea that cpSRP43 alone fulfills all requirements for targeting of LHCP to the thylakoid membrane (23Tzvetkova-Chevolleau T. Hutin C. Noël L.D. Goforth R. Carde J.P. Caffarri S. Sinning I. Groves M. Teulon J.M. Hoffman N.E. Henry R. Havaux M. Nussaume L. Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 1635-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The ankyrin repeats alone are sufficient for the chaperone function of cpSRP43, whereas the chromodomains CD2 and CD3 allow a direct interaction with the C-terminal domain of Alb3 at the thylakoid membrane (23Tzvetkova-Chevolleau T. Hutin C. Noël L.D. Goforth R. Carde J.P. Caffarri S. Sinning I. Groves M. Teulon J.M. Hoffman N.E. Henry R. Havaux M. Nussaume L. Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 1635-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).The thylakoids in chloroplasts host the complete photosynthetic machinery and comprise an additional compartment separate from the inner envelope. Therefore, lateral release of thylakoid membrane proteins upon import, as shown in mitochondria for members of the solute carrier family or single spanning membrane proteins of the inner membrane (37Rehling P. Model K. Brandner K. Kovermann P. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Kühlbrandt W. Wagner R. Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Science. 2003; 299: 1747-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 38Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. IUBMB Life. 2003; 55: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), is not possible, and targeting systems from the inner envelope to the thylakoids are required. In contrast to mitochondria, all classical bacterial targeting systems are present in chloroplasts (4Cross B.C. Sinning I. Luirink J. High S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). For most nuclear encoded membrane proteins destined for the thylakoids, neither the targeting pathway nor the components have been identified. Many of them are believed to insert spontaneously, but their transit through the aqueous environment of the stroma is still enigmatic. LHCPs are a remarkable exception as all components required for targeting and insertion have been reported. They are the only integral membrane proteins for which a specific chaperone has been identified so far.The specific recognition of LHCPs by cpSRP43 relies on the presence of the DPLG motif (21Stengel K.F. Holdermann I. Cain P. Robinson C. Wild K. Sinning I. Science. 2008; 321: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It is conserved in all LHCPs (21Stengel K.F. Holdermann I. Cain P. Robinson C. Wild K. Sinning I. Science. 2008; 321: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and also in fucoxanthin chlorophyll a/c-binding proteins of diatoms (39Lang M. Kroth P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7985-7991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) that are also targeted by cpSRP. In LHCPs, the DPLG motif is part of a conserved interaction site for carotenoids (40Standfuss J. Terwisscha van Scheltinga A.C. Lamborghini M. Kühlbrandt W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 919-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), which are crucial for folding (41Plumley G.F. Schmidt G.W. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 689-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The LHCP-L201K mutation, exemplarily shown for the major LHCP from Pisum sativum (Lhcb1), is sufficient to abolish the LHCP-cpSRP43 interaction (21Stengel K.F. Holdermann I. Cain P. Robinson C. Wild K. Sinning I. Science. 2008; 321: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and thereby prohibits the chaperone function of cpSRP43. We noted previously that a conserved tyrosine in cpSRP43 (Tyr-204) in the crystal structure of the cpSRP43-L18 complex superimposes with the carotenoid headgroup in LHC (21Stengel K.F. Holdermann I. Cain P. Robinson C. Wild K. Sinning I. Science. 2008; 321: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and concluded that the interactions in the transit complex might be a prerequisite for subsequent cofactor attachment upon membrane insertion. The current study suggests that the DPLG motif already plays a crucial role at an earlier stage as it ensures the formation of a soluble complex of LHCP with cpSPR43. We have shown that the hydrophobic TMs of LHCP contribute significantly to the interaction. The structure of cpSRP43 revealed two strikingly different surfaces. Although one is highly negatively charged, the other one exposes two hydrophobic groves. Although one of them binds L18 (21Stengel K.F. Holdermann I. Cain P. Robinson C. Wild K. Sinning I. Science. 2008; 321: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), it is not clear at present how the three hydrophobic transmembrane helices are accommodated. Recognition of hydrophobic regions in substrate proteins is the common principle of molecular chaperones (1Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 574-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). However, in the absence of a functional DPLG motif in LHCPs, the hydrophobic regions are not sufficient for complex formation. In addition, TM3 seems not to interact with cpSRP43, which agrees with previous experiments (27Groves M.R. Mant A. Kuhn A. Koch J. Dübel S. Robinson C. Sinning I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27778-27786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 42High S. Henry R. Mould R.M. Valent Q. Meacock S. Cline K. Gray J.C. Luirink J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11622-11628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), which suggested that TM3 interacts preferentially with cpSRP54. However, cpSRP54 did not show chaperone activity for LHCP and did not enhance the efficiency to form a soluble complex together with cpSRP43 in our experiments. Thus cpSRP54 seems to play a regulatory role in the transit complex and also allows the use of the downstream components of the cpSRP system for post-translational targeting of LHCPs. The highly symmetric SRP54-FtsY GTPase complex of the cytosolic SRP system (43Egea P.F. Shan S.O. Napetschnig J. Savage D.F. Walter P. Stroud R.M. Nature. 2004; 427: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 44Focia P.J. Shepotinovskaya I.V. Seidler J.A. Freymann D.M. Science. 2004; 303: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) is conserved in chloroplasts (3Grudnik P. Bange G. Sinning I. Biol. Chem. 2009; 390: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 45Jaru-Ampornpan P. Chandrasekar S. Shan S.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2636-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). cpSRP54 might thereby enable the coordinated release of LHCP from the transit complex at the thylakoid membrane. We could imagine that cpSRP43 as part of cpSRP binds to unfolded LHCPs as they emerge through the TIC translocation pore to assure that these proteins do not aggregate in the stroma.Interestingly, cpSRP43 is also able to dissolve aggregated LHCP. All chaperones known so far that can dissolve aggregates require ATP hydrolysis. They first remove polypeptides from the aggregates, which results in the release of unfolded polypeptides that can subsequently fold into their native structure alone or with the assistance of other chaperones (46Doyle S.M. Wickner S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2009; 34: 40-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). While ClpB actively dissolves aggregates, cpSRP43 might rather shift the equilibrium between aggregated and soluble LHCP by complex formation. The physiological relevance of the disaggregation function of cpSRP43 is not clear at present because aggregated LHCP similar to inclusion bodies found in the cytoplasm of E. coli have not been reported in the stroma. However, the ability to dissolve aggregates might be advantageous if LHCP import exceeds the capacity of cpSPR43 to form the transit complex.Chaperones are mostly considered as proteins that assist other proteins in folding, have a broad substrate specificity, and consume ATP. However, more and more examples have been reported that describe specific chaperones that act in the assembly/disassembly of macromolecular complexes and that do not have an ATPase activity. The term molecular chaperone was in fact invented to describe the function of proteins that assist the assembly of folded subunits into oligomeric structures, with nucleosome assembly as the first example (47Ellis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 395-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 48Laskey R.A. Honda B.M. Mills A.D. Finch J.T. Nature. 1978; 275: 416-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Other examples include the pili assembly of Gram-negative bacteria via the chaperone-usher pathway (49Vetsch M. Puorger C. Spirig T. Grauschopf U. Weber-Ban E.U. Glockshuber R. Nature. 2004; 431: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 50Nishiyama M. Ishikawa T. Rechsteiner H. Glockshuber R. Science. 2008; 320: 376-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), the delivery of flagellar building blocks to a type III secretion system in flagella biogenesis (51Chevance F.F. Hughes K.T. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 455-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), and the stromal form I Rubisco (Rbc), which is the most abundant soluble protein on earth (52Gutteridge S. Gatenby A.A. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Rbc is an oligomer built up from eight large and eight small subunits. To assemble into a functional enzyme, the large subunit requires a specific chaperone, RbcX2. Like cpSRP43, RbcX2 is a highly specific chaperone that recognizes a defined motif in RbcL (53Liu C. Young A.L. Starling-Windhof A. Bracher A. Saschenbrecker S. Rao B.V. Rao K.V. Berninghausen O. Mielke T. Hartl F.U. Beckmann R. Hayer-Hartl M. Nature. 2010; 463: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Taken together, specific chaperones might be used either when oligomeric assembly is tightly coupled to subunit folding or when the assembly of multisubunit complexes from individual components must take place in a highly orchestrated manner. In this respect, LHCPs present a unique problem as they are integral membrane proteins, and the assembly of functional LHC requires the attachment of cofactors and the formation of trimers upon membrane insertion. cpSRP43 prevents aggregation in the stroma and allows delivery to the membrane insertase at the target membrane. The modular architecture of cpSRP43 is designed for its dual function as targeting factor and as a highly specific chaperone for LHCPs. Whether cpSRP43 can act as a chaperone for other chloroplast proteins remains to be seen. IntroductionMany proteins fold spontaneously in vitro in agreement with Anfinsen's pioneering studies that showed that the information for protein folding resides in the primary structure (55Anfinsen C.B. Science. 1973; 181: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (5079) Google Scholar). However, in vivo folding of soluble proteins often requires molecular chaperones to efficiently reach the native functional state (1Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 574-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). The folding of proteins can start during their synthesis assisted by ribosome-associated chaperones that act on the nascent polypeptide chain (2Kramer G. Boehringer D. Ban N. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Most membrane proteins utilize the ribosome-bound signal recognition particle (SRP) 2The abbreviations used are: SRPsignal recognition particlecpSRPsignal recognition particleLHClight-harvesting complexLHCPlight-harvesting chlorophyll a,b-binding proteinCBBCoomassie Brilliant Blue RTMtransmembrane helixCDchromodomainGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseGdmClguanidinium chlorideDTTdithiothreitolTFtrigger factorRbcRubiscoRubiscoribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase. for co-translational targeting to the plasma membrane in prokaryotes and the endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotes, which allows coupling membrane protein biosynthesis directly to membrane insertion (3Grudnik P. Bange G. Sinning I. Biol. Chem. 2009; 390: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 4Cross B.C. Sinning I. Luirink J. High S. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Microbiol. 2005; 59: 329-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In this way, aggregation and misfolding of membrane proteins in the cytoplasm are prevented. Nuclear encoded membrane proteins destined for organelles, e.g. mitochondria or chloroplasts, however, are excluded from the “classical” co-translational targeting and insertion mechanisms. Recently an endoplasmic reticulum- and Golgi-mediated protein targeting pathway to the chloroplast for soluble, glycosylated proteins was described (6Villarejo A. Burén S. Larsson S. Déjardin A. Monné M. Rudhe C. Karlsson J. Jansson S. Lerouge P. Rolland N. von Heijne G. Grebe M. Bako L. Samuelsson G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1224-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 7Nanjo Y. Oka H. Ikarashi N. Kaneko K. Kitajima A. Mitsui T. Muñoz F.J. Rodríguez-López M. Baroja-Fernández E. Pozueta-Romero J.

Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 385-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, it is not known at present whether this pathway is also used to target chloroplast membrane proteins.Prominent examples of post-translationally targeted membrane proteins are the light-harvesting chlorophyll a,b-binding proteins (LHCPs) that serve as antenna proteins in photosynthesis and represent one of the most abundant membrane proteins on earth. After synthesis in the cytoplasm, they are imported across the two chloroplast envelope membranes utilizing the TOC/TIC import machinery (9Soll J. Schleiff E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 10Kessler F. Schnell D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2009; 21: 494-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Upon arrival in the stroma, LHCPs are sequestered into a soluble, so-called transit complex with the chloroplast signal recognition particle (cpSRP), consisting of cpSRP54 and a novel protein component, cpSRP43 (11Schuenemann D. Gupta S. Persello-Cartieaux F. Klimyuk V.I. Jones J.D. Nussaume L. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 10312-10316Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). LHCPs contain three transmembrane helices (TM1–3) to which carotenoids and chlorophylls are attached upon thylakoid insertion to form the light-harvesting complexes (LHCs) that are active mainly as trimers (12Schmid V.H. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 3619-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 13Barros T. Kühlbrandt W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1787: 753-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of LHCP folding in vitro have been analyzed extensively (14Paulsen H. Rümler U. Rüdiger W. Planta. 1990; 181: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 15Booth P.J. Paulsen H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5103-5108Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 16Hobe S. Prytulla S. Kühlbrandt W. Paulsen H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3423-3429Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and unfolded LHCP was shown to be sufficient for chloroplast import but not for thylakoid insertion (17Yuan J. Henry R. Cline K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 8552-8556Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic TMs present a particular challenge as they are prone for aggregation and have to be kept in a conformation competent for subsequent membrane insertion and folding into a functional structure. This calls for a molecular chaperone that prevents LHCPs from aggregation in the stroma and allows membrane insertion. In early studies, a stromal factor was shown to be absolutely required for targeting and membrane insertion (17Yuan J. Henry R. Cline K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 8552-8556Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), but the factor remained unknown. Although in mitochondria insertion of the nuclear encoded multispanning membrane protein Oxa1 into the inner envelope was shown to require Hsp70 (18Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2217-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), neither Hsp70 nor Hsp60 supported thylakoid insertion of LHCP in chloroplasts (17Yuan J. Henry R. Cline K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 8552-8556Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 19Yalovsky S. Paulsen H. Michaeli D. Chitnis P.R. Nechushtai R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 5616-5619Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the meantime, cpSRP43 was identified as a novel component of cpSRP (11Schuenemann D. Gupta S. Persello-Cartieaux F. Klimyuk V.I. Jones J.D. Nussaume L. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 10312-10316Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). It consists of protein-protein interaction domains, three chromodomains, and four ankyrin repeats (20Klimyuk V.I. Persello-Cartieaux F. Havaux M. Contard-David P. Schuenemann D. Meiherhoff K. Gouet P. Jones J.D. Hoffman N.E. Nussaume L. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 87-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 21Stengel K.F. Holdermann I. Cain P. Robinson C. Wild K. Sinning I. Science. 2008; 321: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and interacts with a conserved region in LHCPs, the L18 region (L18) between TM2 and TM3 (22Tu C.J. Peterson E.C. Henry R. Hoffman N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13187-13190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). L18 is an internal targeting signal that allows LHCPs to interact with cpSRP43 in a highly specific manner, unlike the canonical interaction of signal sequences with SRP, which is not sequence-specific (3Grudnik P. Bange G. Sinning I. Biol. Chem. 2009; 390: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 4Cross B.C. Sinning I. Luirink J. High S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that a DPLG motif in L18 is strictly required for the interaction and wraps around a tyrosine hook in the ankyrin repeats of cpSRP43 (21Stengel K.F. Holdermann I. Cain P. Robinson C. Wild K. Sinning I. Science. 2008; 321: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The tyrosine seems to mimic the lutein headgroup of the carotenoid and to allow cofactor attachment upon LHCP membrane insertion (21Stengel K.F. Holdermann I. Cain P. Robinson C. Wild K. Sinning I. Science. 2008; 321: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The stoichiometry of the transit complex is not known, but in in vitro thylakoid insertion assays, both cpSRP43 and cpSRP54 are required for LHCP insertion, whereas in vivo, cpSRP43 alone seems sufficient when cpSRP54 and the SRP receptor cpFtsY are both knocked out (23Tzvetkova-Chevolleau T. Hutin C. Noël L.D. Goforth R. Carde J.P. Caffarri S. Sinning I. Groves M. Teulon J.M. Hoffman N.E. Henry R. Havaux M. Nussaume L. Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 1635-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This points to a central role for cpSRP43, with the C-terminal chromodomains (CD2–3) interacting with cpSRP54 (24Goforth R.L. Peterson E.C. Yuan J. Moore M.J. Kight A.D. Lohse M.B. Sakon J.

Chem. 2010; 285: 5954-5962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), whereas the ankyrin repeats bind the DPLG motif of LHCPs (18Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2217-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).Here we show that cpSRP43 is a novel molecular chaperone required for LHCP membrane insertion. cpSRP43 alone is able to form a soluble complex with LHCP and thereby is sufficient to prevent aggregation. The chaperone function resides in the ankyrin repeats of cpSRP43 and strictly requires the conserved DPLG motif in LHCPs. The role of cpSRP43 cannot be taken over by other stromal chaperones."

It has been previously described that two TOR kinases control cell growth in the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African trypanosomiasis. Here we studied an unusual TOR-like protein named TbTOR-like 1 containing a PDZ domain and found exclusively in kinetoplastids. TbTOR-like 1 localizes to unique cytosolic granules. After hyperosmotic stress, the localization of the protein shifts to the cell periphery, different from other organelle markers. Ablation of TbTOR-like 1 causes a progressive inhibition of cell proliferation, producing parasites accumulating in the S/G2 phase of the cell cycle. TbTOR-like 1 knocked down cells have an increased area occupied by acidic vacuoles, known as acidocalcisomes, and are enriched in polyphosphate and pyrophosphate. These results suggest that TbTOR-like 1 might be involved in the control of acidocalcisome and polyphosphate metabolism in T. brucei.

African trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness, is a disease caused by the parasitic protist Trypanosoma brucei that affects a half-million people in sub-Saharan Africa. Transmitted by the tsetse fly vector (Glossina spp.), trypanosomiasis represents an important public health problem and has a strong impact in the economic development of that region. T. brucei has a complex life cycle involving different morphological and functional stages. These parasites alternate between insect and mammalian hosts. The adaptation to these diverse environments requires rapid changes in gene expression to fulfill metabolic or morphological changes (1Gull K. Int. J. Parasitol. 2001; 31: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This parasite also has the ability to survive a wide range of environmental conditions as it progresses through its life cycle, including extreme fluctuations in external osmolarity (2Vieira L.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 221-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).

Studies on mammalian cells and yeast signaling pathways have shown that nutrient starvation inhibits TOR activities, which results in G1 cell cycle arrest, and triggers a stress response program leading to a blockade of translation initiation. Similar stress responses can be observed in cells treated with rapamycin, an immunosuppressant drug, which binds to FKBP12, a prolyl-isomerase, forming a complex with the TOR kinase (reviewed in Refs. 3Wullschleger S.

Two distinct aspects of cell growth are regulated by two functionally different TOR kinases in T. brucei, termed TbTOR1 and TbTOR2. TbTOR1 and TbTOR2 function in two distinct TOR-containing multiprotein complexes (TORC) conserved along eukaryote evolution, named TORC1 and TORC2. TbTOR1, located in the nucleus, controls the synthesis and accumulation of cell mass through TORC1 signaling, whereas TbTOR2, associated with the mitochondrion or endoplasmic reticulum, controls actin cytoskeleton organization and endocytosis through TORC2 (5Barquilla A. Crespo J.L. Navarro M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 14579-14584Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Only this latter is sensitive to rapamycin, contrary to what is observed for mammalian cells and yeast, in which TORC1, but not TORC2 is sensitive to rapamycin (6Loewith R. Jacinto E. Wullschleger S. Lorberg A. Crespo J.L. Bonenfant D. Oppliger W. Jenoe P. Hall M.N. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 457-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, two other sequences encode putative kinases with high domain similarity to TOR kinases in T. brucei: TbTOR-like 1 and TbTOR-like 2; one of them, TbTOR-like 1, is not found in TbRaptor- or TbAVO3-containing complexes (5Barquilla A. Crespo J.L. Navarro M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 14579-14584Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The presence of additional TOR kinases would suggest that in T. brucei, these enzymes could have acquired additional roles to those carried out for TORC1 or TORC2, possibly related to their adaptation to different hosts and environments. In this work we investigated the role of TOR-like 1 protein in T. brucei. Among Eukarya TOR kinases, TbTOR-like 1 possesses a unique PDZ domain, which is thought to be involved in protein-protein interactions, mediating binding of a class of submembranous proteins to membrane receptors and ion channels (7Kornau H.C. Seeburg P.H. Kennedy M.B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). We show that RNAi knockdown produces cells with enlarged acidocalcisomes rich in pyrophosphate (PPi) and polyphosphate (poly P), which is a polymer of a few to hundreds of phosphate units bound by phosphoanhydride bonds (8Kornberg A. Rao N.N. Ault-Riché D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 89-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). Acidocalcisomes are organelles known to accumulate poly P in T. brucei as well as most protists (9Docampo R. de Souza W. Miranda K. Rohloff P. Moreno S.N. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Poly P is known to regulate the activity of mammalian TOR (10Wang L. Fraley C.D. Faridi J. Kornberg A. Roth R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 11249-11254Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and is important for cellular adaptation to different stresses (11Ruiz F.A. Rodrigues C.O. Docampo R. J. Biol.

We provide evidence that TbTOR-like 1 is implicated in the osmotic responses through control of poly P levels and acidocalcisome size. The procyclic forms (PCF) of T. brucei strains 427 and 29-13 (18Wirtz E. Clayton C. Science. 1995; 268: 1179-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) were maintained at 27–28 °C in SDM-79 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For the 29-13 strain 50 μg/ml hygromycin and 15 μg/ml G418 were added to the culture medium to preserve the integrated copies of T7 RNA polymerase and the tetracycline repressor, respectively. The bloodstream forms (BSF) of T. brucei 90-13 (19Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar) were cultured at 37 °C at 5% CO2 in HMI-9 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10% Serum Plus (SAFC BiosciencesTM) in the presence of hygromycin (5 μg/ml) and G418 (2.5 μg/ml). Cell densities were determined using a Neubauer chamber, and growth curves were performed using duplicate cultures, diluted to 1 × 106 cells/ml (PCF) or to 1 × 105 cells/ml (BSF) to begin the experiment. For RNAi, a 457-nucleotide fragment of TbTOR-like 1 (nucleotides 430–886) of the sequence deposited in the GenBankTM as XM_839137 was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-CGGATCCCTTCTTGGGAAGCATTTTGG and 5′-AAGCTTTATACCCTCCAGTCACG. This sequence encodes a portion of the TbTOR like 1 gene, coding fragment 1. For TbTOR2 RNAi, a 436-nucleotide fragment (nucleotides 85–520) from the sequence deposited in the GenBankTM as XM_839099, we used the primers 5′-GGGATCCGCTGAGGTTGTTAAGCAGGC and 5′-AAGCTTACATGTCGAGAATTCGC. Both pairs of primers incorporated BamHI and HindIII sites (underlined nucleotides, respectively) sites at opposite ends of the DNA fragments. Fragments were cloned into pCR 2.1 TOPO (Invitrogen) and subcloned into the BamHI and HindIII sites of the p2T2-177 vector (20Wickstead B. Ersfeld K. Gull K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 125: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The plasmids were linearized with NotI and introduced into PCF 29-13 and BSF 90-13 by electroporation. Log phase PCF (2.5 × 107) or BSF (1 × 107) were washed with Cytomix buffer (21Clayton C.E. Estévez A.M. Hartmann C. Alibu V.P. Field M. Horn D. Methods Mol. Biol. 2005; 309: 39-60PubMed Google Scholar) and electroporated with two pulses in the presence of 10 μg of purified plasmids in a 4-mm cuvette at 1.5-kV voltage and 25-microfarad capacitance. After a 24-h recovery in medium, the cells were selected with the addition of 2.5 μg/ml phleomycin. After selection, the induction of double-stranded RNA was obtained by adding 1 μg of fresh tetracycline/ml of culture every time the cells were diluted. Antibodies against Tb TOR-like 1 (fragment 2) were generated by immunizing mice with a recombinant protein expressed in pET 14b containing a 513-bp fragment that was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-CTCGAGTCTGGTGGCGACGAGGCTG and 5′-AAGCTTAACTTCCCCCCCTTGTCGGAG. The recombinant protein was obtained in inclusion bodies and purified by chromatography on nickel chelating resin in the presence of 6 m urea followed by preparative SDS-PAGE. Fragment 3 antibodies were obtained as described (5Barquilla A. Crespo J.L. Navarro M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 14579-14584Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). PCF and BSF were harvested by centrifugation (1,500 × g for 10 min), washed twice in PBS, and resuspended in PBS with 1% SDS and proteinase inhibitors (2 mm benzamidine, 1 μg of leupeptin/ml, 4 μg of aprotinin/ml, 10 μg of pepstatin A/ml, 1 μg of antipain/ml, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm NaF) and broken with three cycles of freezing and thawing. The samples were quantified using the BCA protein kit (Pierce), mixed with 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and boiled for 5 min. The cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) using a Bio-Rad transblot apparatus (Bio-Rad) in 500 mm Tris, 1 m glycine, 0.1% SDS buffer, pH 8, containing 10% methanol. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% nonfat milk in PBS-T (PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. The antibodies were also diluted in PBS-T containing 5% nonfat milk. The membranes were incubated with anti-TbTOR-like 1 fragments 2 and 3 at a dilution of 1:300 overnight at 4 °C or with anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody (Sigma) at a dilution of 1:15,000. After three washes of 10 min with PBS-T, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) diluted at 1:15,000 and 1:10,000, respectively, for 1 h. After three washes of 10 min each with PBS-T, bound antibodies were detected using a chemiluminescence kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was purified from 2 × 108 cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Samples of RNA (20 μg) were separated on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel (22Abuin G. Freitas-Junior L.H.G. Colli W. Alves M.J. Schenkman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13041-13047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and the gel was stained with ethidium bromide. The RNA was transferred onto a Hybond NX nylon membrane (GE Healthcare) by capillary transfer and fixed by UV irradiation. The membranes were prehybridized and hybridized as described in Ref. 23Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7266) Google Scholar with probes labeled using the Rediprime II random prime labeling system (GE Healthcare) in the presence of 50 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol; New England Nuclear). The tubulin probe used was a fragment of the gene cloned in the pZJM vector (24Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The membranes were exposed on a phosphorimaging screen for 24 h, and labeling was detected using a Typhoon 9200 image scanner (GE Healthcare). For immunofluorescence, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 10 min, washed with PBS two times, fixed with 2% p-formaldehyde in ice-cold PBS for 20 min, and settled onto poly-l-lysine-coated slides for 15 min. The fixed cells were then washed three times with PBS and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 3 min, washed again with PBS three times, and blocked with PBS with 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were incubated with mouse anti-TbTOR-like 1 F2 (1:600 dilution), rabbit anti-HSP70 or anti-BiP (both of them gifts from James D.

After three washes with PBS, the cells were incubated with Alexa-Fluor 546 or 488 conjugated either to goat anti-mouse IgG or Alexa-Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen) at a dilution of 1:1,000 for 40 min. The cells were washed and counterstained with 1 μm 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylidole (DAPI) before mounting with Vectashield anti-fading medium (Vector Laboratories). The cells were visualized with an Olympus IX-71 inverted fluorescence microscope. Serial images (0.2 μm) were acquired with a Photometrix CoolSnapHQ charge-coupled device camera driven by DeltaVision software (Applied Precision). Alternatively, serial images (0.2-μm Z-increment) were collected using a 100× objective 1.40 NA using the Cell∧M software (Olympus Europe) in a motorized Olympus IBX81 microscope. The images were processed by blind deconvolution using Autoquant X 2.1. For observation of acridine orange accumulation, the cells were prepared as described in Ref. 28Lemercier G. Dutoya S. Luo S.

After incubation with 6 μm of acridine orange in a buffer containing 116 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 5.5 mm glucose, 50 mm K-HEPES, pH 7.2 (buffer A), for 10 min at 28 °C, the cells were centrifuged at 2,000 × g, resuspended in PBS, adhered to coverslips pretreated with 0.1% poly-l-lysine, and observed on an Olympus IX-71 inverted fluorescence microscope. Cell samples for flow cytometry analysis were prepared as described previously (30Hammarton T.C. Clark J. Douglas F. Boshart M. Mottram J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22877-22886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The cells were analyzed with a FACSCalibur using CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson). For image analysis, the cells were fixed, adhered, and permeabilized as described above, stained with 10 μg/ml of DAPI for 10 min, and visualized with a fluorescence microscope. For osmotic stress under constant ionic strength, the following buffers described previously (31Kocic I. Hirano Y. Hiraoka M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2001; 51: 59-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) were used: isotonic (64 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.53 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, 5 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.4, and 150 mm mannitol; 282 mOsm/liter), hypotonic (the same as isotonic but with reduced mannitol concentration to 50 mm; 177 mOsm/liter), and hypertonic (the same as isotonic but with increased mannitol concentration to 500 mm; 650 mOsm/liter). Samples of 2 × 107 cells were collected, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended in 10 ml of isosmotic buffer. To the resuspended cells 500 μl of the desired buffer (isosmotic, hyposmotic or hyperosmotic) were added, and the samples were fixed with an equal volume of 8% paraformaldehyde in PBS after the indicated periods of time. The cells were collected by centrifugation, washed once with PBS, and adhered to coverslips pretreated with 0.1% poly-l-lysine for 1 h and processed for immunofluorescence as described above. For thin section images, trypanosomes were collected and fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 4% freshly prepared paraformaldehyde, and 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.3, on ice for 1 h and processed as described (32Miranda K. Docampo R. Grillo O. de Souza W. Protist. 2004; 155: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The images were obtained in a Zeiss EM 902 microscope. For imaging whole cells, PCF were washed twice with filtered buffer A and directly applied to Formvar-coated grids as described previously (33Fang J. Rohloff P. Miranda K. Docampo R. Biochem. J. 2007; 407: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The images were observed in an energy-filtering Zeiss EM 902 microscope. The number of acidocalcisomes was obtained as in Ref. 33Fang J. Rohloff P. Miranda K. Docampo R. Biochem. J. 2007; 407: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar. PPi and poly P were extracted from 2.5 × 107 PCF and 1 × 108 BSF collected by centrifugation and washed three times with buffer A (described above). For short chain poly P and PPi extraction, the cell pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of buffer A and 200 μl of ice-cold 0.5 m perchloric acid and left on ice for 30 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 min, and the supernatant was neutralized by the addition of 0.72 m KOH, 0.6 m KHCO3. Precipitated KClO4 was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 min, and the supernatant was used for measuring the phosphorus and PPi released. Long chain poly P was extracted as described in Ref. 33Fang J. Rohloff P. Miranda K. Docampo R. Biochem. J. 2007; 407: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar. Enzymatic assays of poly P and PPi were performed in triplicate. The assays for short chain poly P were incubated at 35 °C for 30 min in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm ammonium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate containing the sample, and >50 units of yeast exopolyphosphatase (34Ruiz F.A. Luo S. Moreno S.N. Docampo R. Microsc. Microanal. 2004; 10: 563-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Background phosphate contamination of each sample was measured in triplicate wells not containing the exopolyphosphatase, and positive control reactions were included on each plate containing a final concentration of 20 μm sodium triphosphate. The reactions were stopped by the addition of freshly mixed, malachite green reagent (3 parts 0.045% malachite green and 1 part 4.2% ammonium molybdate, 4 m HCl), and absorbance at 660 nm was immediately read on a M2e microplate spectrophotomer (Molecular Devices). Release of phosphate from PPi was performed for 10 min at 35 °C in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 unit of yeast pyrophosphatase (Sigma). Background phosphate controls (no pyrophosphatase) and positive control (20–25 μm potassium pyrophosphate) wells were included in triplicate. Phosphate was measured with malachite green as described above. On all occasions, standard curves of potassium phosphate were included on each plate. Both phosphate content released from poly P and pyrophosphate were normalized to reaction yield as determined by positive controls. Calculations of concentrations of short and long chain poly P and PPi were based in the number of cells used in the extraction (amount of Pi or PPi/106 cells). The T. brucei genome data base contains sequences for four open reading frames encoding for proteins with sequences similar to mammalian TOR: TbTOR1, TbTOR2, TbTOR-like 1, and TbTOR-like 2. TbTOR1 and TbTOR2 proteins were previously described by Barquilla et al. (5Barquilla A. Crespo J.L. Navarro M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 14579-14584Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The TbTOR-like 1 gene is located in chromosome 4 and has 7788 base pairs in length encoding for a 291.11-kDa protein with an isoelectric point of 5.92. The predicted protein contains the conserved sequence domains found in TbTOR1/2, ScTbTOR1/2, and mTOR: HEAT repeats (repeats of an amino acid sequence motif that was first identified in Huntingtin, in elongation factor 3, in the regulatory subunit of Protein Phosphatase 2A, and in the TOR, which function in transport processes) (35Andrade M.A. Bork P. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 115-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), the FAT domain (found in FRAP, ATM, and TRRAP proteins involved in protein-protein interactions) (36Bosotti R. Isacchi A. Sonnhammer E.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 225-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), the FKBP12-rapamycin binding domain (37Choi J. Chen J. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. Science. 1996; 273: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar), the kinase domain (catalytic domain with homology to phosphatidylinositol kinases), and the FATC domain (found at the extreme carboxyl terminus, always in combination with the FAT domain (36Bosotti R. Isacchi A. Sonnhammer E.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 225-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The main difference between the TbTOR-like 1 domain structure and the canonical structure of the TOR kinases is the presence of a PDZ domain (38Ponting C.P. Phillips C. Davies K.E. Blake D.J. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) between the HEAT repeats and the FAT domain. PDZ domains are usually present in proteins that interact marginally with membranes. Thus, we investigated the subcellular localization of TbTOR-like 1. In immunoblots anti-F2 and -F3 antibodies reacted with a band of 291 kDa, the expected size for TbTOR-like 1 (Fig. 1B). Immunofluorescence using anti-F2 antibodies revealed a granular pattern, which is distributed through the cytosol in PCF and BSF (Fig. 1C). To initially confirm the cellular localization of TbTOR-like 1, RNAi experiments were made in procyclic forms using a vector that generates double strand RNA from a single construct containing the gene segment corresponding to F1. Northern blot analysis shows that RNAi specifically ablated the expression of TbTOR-like 1 (Fig. 2A). Similarly, the levels of protein recognized by immunoblots using anti-F2 or F3 antisera against TbTOR-like 1 decreased. Fig. 2B shows the results for anti-F2, but identical decreases were observed when using anti-F3 antibodies. Knockdown of TbTOR-like 1 is already observed 24 h after RNAi induction with tetracycline, without an immediate effect in cell growth for PCF (Fig. 3A) or BSF (Fig. 3B). Importantly, the immunofluorescence analysis showed a convincing decrease in labeling in both PCF and BSF (Fig. 3C), confirming the cellular localization of TbTOR-like 1.FIGURE 3TbTOR-like 1 ablation by RNAi causes a progressive cell growth inhibition in PCF and BSF of T. brucei. A and B, growth curve of tetracycline induced (+Tet) or noninduced (−Tet) PCF (A) and BSF (B). At days 4 and 3 the cells were diluted again to the initial dilution (1 × 106/ml and 3 × 105/ml for PCF and BSF, respectively). The values are the means ± S.D. of triplicate experiments. The differences were statistically significant for PCF at days 6, 7, and 8 (p = 0.011, 0.003, and 0.025, respectively) and for BSF at days 3 and 4 (p = 0.023 and 0.038, respectively).

Scale bars, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We found that TbTOR-like 1 is in the cytosol and is not associated with major organelles. Its labeling pattern shows some colocalization with anti-HSP70 (a cytosolic marker) but differs significantly with respect of anti-aldolase (a glycosomal marker), anti-Dhh1 (a P-body marker), anti-TbVP1 (an acidocalcisome marker), anti-dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (a mitochondrial marker), and anti-BiP (an endoplasmic reticulum marker) localization (supplemental Fig. S1). Cell fractionation studies revealed that, different from TbTOR2, which is associated with the parasite mitochondria or with the endoplasmic reticulum (5Barquilla A. Crespo J.L. Navarro M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 14579-14584Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), TbTOR-like 1 is found in the soluble fraction and not associated with membranous cell compartments (supplemental Fig. S2). It can be noted from Fig. 3 (A and B) that RNAi of TbTOR-like 1 progressively decreased cellular proliferation, whereas protein expression disappears rapidly in PCF and BSF. The effect of proliferation is more pronounced several days following knockdown. In addition, TbTOR-like 1-depleted PCF (but not BSF) appear larger than the noninduced controls (Fig. 3C, DIC). Morphometric analysis of a large number of cells confirmed this observation. The projected area taken from two-dimensional images revealed that RNAi-induced cells were larger than the noninduced controls (Fig. 4). The increased size of cells lacking TbTOR-like 1 could be due to a delayed progression in the cell cycle, which would also explain the decrease in the proliferation rate. Therefore, the cellular DNA content/cell was quantified by flow cytometry after propidium iodide staining, 4 days after RNAi induction with tetracycline. As shown in Fig. 5A, the number of PCF in the G1 phase of the cell cycle was reduced concomitantly with an increase of cells in the S phase. No effect of tetracycli"

Nevertheless, the direct interaction between cPAcP and ErbB-2 has not been shown nor the specific dephosphorylation site of ErbB-2 by cPAcP. In this report, our data show that the phosphorylation level of ErbB-2 primarily at Tyr1221/2 correlates with the growth rate of both LNCaP and MDA PCa2b human PCa cells. Further, cPAcP reciprocally co-immunoprecipitated with ErbB-2 in a non-permissive growth condition. Expression of wild type cPAcP, but not inactive mutant, by cDNA in cPAcP-null LNCaP C-81 cells results in decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB-2 including Tyr1221/2. Concurrently, Tyr317 phosphorylation of p52Shc, proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression, and cell growth are decreased in these cells. Conversely, decreased cPAcP expression by short hairpin RNA in LNCaP C-33 cells was associated with elevated phosphorylation of ErbB-2 initially at Tyr1221/2. Its downstream p52Shc, ERK1/2, Akt, Src, STAT-3, and STAT-5 were activated, and cell proliferation, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and cyclin D1 expression were increased. Stable subclones of C-33 cells by small interfering PAcP had elevated Tyr1221/2 phosphorylation of ErbB-2 and exhibited androgen-independent growth and increased tumorigenicity in xenograft female animals. In summary, our data together indicate that in prostate epithelia, cPAcP interacts with and dephosphorylates ErbB-2 primarily at Tyr1221/2 and hence blocks downstream signaling, leading to reduced cell growth.

Clinical studies show that AR plays a critical role in most HR PCa progression. For example, hypersensitivity of AR pathway may circumvent ablation therapy by reducing the threshold of androgens required for cell proliferation (3Isaacs J.T. Isaacs W.B. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 26-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Elevated AR protein can convert the action of some AR antagonists to agonists (4Chen C.D. Welsbie D.S. Tran C. Baek S.H. Chen R.

However, elevated expression and mutation of AR together only account for a subpopulation of HR PCa. Thus, other mechanisms such as cross-talk with other signaling pathways could also be involved in the development of HR phenotype (6Culig Z. Hobisch A. Cronauer M.V. Radmayr C. Trapman J. Hittmair A.

Further, ErbB-2 can activate Akt in the absence of androgen, and subsequently, Akt phosphorylates AR at Ser213 and Ser791 sites. Abrogation of Akt signaling abolishes the androgen-independent survival and growth of these cells (12Wen Y. Hu M.C. Makino K. Spohn B. Bartholomeusz G. Yan D.H. Hung M.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6841-6845PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, in prostate carcinomas, the ErbB-2 gene is not amplified, and ErbB-2 protein is elevated only in a subset of advanced HR PCa (12Wen Y. Hu M.C. Makino K. Spohn B. Bartholomeusz G.

Several lines of evidence suggest that cellular prostatic acid phosphatase (cPAcP), a prostate epithelial differentiation antigen, is involved in regulating the growth of prostate epithelia. The expression and the activity of cPAcP in prostate carcinoma cells is lower than that in normal and benign hypertrophic prostate tissue despite that secreted PAcP may be elevated in circulation (17Foti A.G.

It is noted that cPAcP and secreted PAcP exhibit different biochemical properties including different isoelectric points and sensitivities to endoglycosidases (20Veeramani S. Yuan T.C. Chen S.J.

The overall tyrosyl phosphorylation level, the tyrosyl kinase specific activity, and the cell growth rate are inversely correlated with cPAcP activity in PCa cell lines under various growth conditions (26Lin M.F.

Intratumor injection of PAcP cDNA expression vector suppresses xenograft tumor progression and decreased ErbB-2 tyrosyl phosphorylation (33Igawa T. Lin F.F. Rao P. Lin M.F. Prostate. 2003; 55: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Supportively, in PAcP knock-out mice, the prostate develops carcinomas spontaneously and increased tyrosine phosphorylation (34Zylka M.J. Sowa N.A. Taylor-Blake B. Twomey M.A. Herrala A. Voikar V. Vihko P. Neuron. 2008; 60: 111-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In addition, ERK1/2 are activated by phosphorylation in prostate carcinomas and PCa cells in which cPAcP is decreased, suggesting that decreased cPAcP resulted in activating ErbB-2 and ERK1/2 signaling (11Lee M.S. Igawa T. Yuan T.C. Zhang X.Q. Lin F.F. Lin M.F. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 32Zhang X.Q. Lee M.S. Zelivianski S. Lin M.F. J. Biol.

Therefore, cPAcP plays a regulatory role of controlling the activation of ErbB-2, and in cPAcP-null PCa cells, activated ErbB-2-induced signaling can be involved in ligand-independent AR activation, leading to HR progression of these cells. Due to the importance of cPAcP and ErbB-2 involvement in regulating HR PCa progression, it is imperative to clarify the direct interaction of cPAcP and ErbB-2 because until now, only correlative results have been reported. Further, the identification of a ErbB-2 dephosphorylation site by cPAcP can help delineate the biological outcome of PAcP and ErbB-2 interaction and the mechanism involved in the development of HR PCa. Restoring cPAcP expression thus may represent an alternative therapeutic approach in treating PCa patients.

Human PCa cell lines LNCaP and MDA PCa2b were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). LNCaP cells were routinely maintained in the regular medium, i.e. phenol red-positive RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% FBS, 2 mm glutamine, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. The LNCaP cell model was described originally by Lin et al. (30Lin M.F. Meng T.C. Rao P.S. Chang C. Schonthal A.H. Lin F.F. J. Biol.

Prostate. 2002; 50: 222-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The C-33 cells are androgen-sensitive, whereas C-81 cells behave androgen independently. MDA PCa2b cells were maintained in BRFF-HPC1 medium supplemented with 20% FBS, 2 mm glutamine, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (37Chen S.J. Karan D. Johansson S.L. Lin F.F. Zeckser J. Singh A.P. Batra S.K.

LNCaP C-81 cells were transfected with PAcP expression vector containing WT PAcP cDNA with LipofectamineTM and PlusTM reagents in OptiMEM medium and followed the accompanying protocol. Two stable subclones designated as LNCaP-28 and -40 were described previously (30Lin M.F. Meng T.C. Rao P.S. Chang C. Schonthal A.H. Lin F.F. J. Biol.

The pSUPER system-based siRNA approach and the protocol from OligoEngine (Seattle, WA) were utilized. Briefly, four different oligonucleotides were synthesized: siPAcP-78, 5′-GCCTTAGCCTTGGCTTCTT-3′; siPAcP-126, 5′-GTGTACTAGCCAAGGAGTT-3′; siPAcP-183, 5′-GTCCCATTGACACCTTTCC-3′; and siPAcP-236, 5′-GGATTTGGCCAACTCACCC-3′. A pair of 64-nucleotide oligonucleotides containing 19 nucleotides targeting to PAcP mRNA sequence was inserted into the mammalian expression vector pSUPER at the BglII/HindIII restriction sites. Because siPAcP-126 consistently showed the high efficiency of PAcP knockdown, stable subclones were established in LNCaP C-33 cells by transfecting with siPAcP-126 pSUPER plasmid. Positive clones were selected by G418 (600 μg/ml) and screened for cPAcP expression by Western blotting. Three subclones C-3, C-11, and C-17, were selected for further analyses. For the control, pSUPER vector containing scramble oligonucleotide was transfected into C-33 cells, and clone V-3 was established. The transfection was performed as described above. Subconfluent cells were harvested, and the immunoblotting was performed as described in previous reports (11Lee M.S. Igawa T. Yuan T.C. Zhang X.Q. Lin F.F. Lin M.F.

For immunoprecipitation, cells were harvested and lysed in ice-cold cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, plus phosphatase and protease inhibitors). An aliquot of 250 μg of lysate protein was incubated with primary Ab at 4 °C overnight, and then protein A-agarose beads were added (20 μl of 50% bead slurry) for 3 h at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were spun at 700 × g for 1 min, washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer, and suspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Cells were seeded at densities as indicated in each set of experiments and cultured in the corresponding regular culture medium. The maintenance and determination of cell growth were conducted as described (30Lin M.F. Meng T.C. Rao P.S. Chang C. Schonthal A.H. Lin F.F. J. Biol.

To determine androgen-independent growth, cells were maintained in a steroid-reduced medium for 4 days before cell number analysis (30Lin M.F. Meng T.C. Rao P.S. Chang C. Schonthal A.H. Lin F.F. J.

To subfractionate cellular proteins, subconfluent or confluent LNCaP C-33 cells were fed with a steroid-reduced medium for 2 days. Cell membrane, cytoplasmic, and nuclear proteins were fractionated following the protocol of the subcellular protein fractionation kit (Thermal Scientific). LNCaP C-33 cells were also subfractionated by ultracentrifugation. Briefly, confluent cells were lysed in a hypotonic Buffer A (20 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and protease inhibitors), homogenized, and followed by centrifugation at 2000 × g. The obtained soluble fraction was spun at 160,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatant was collected as the cytosol fraction. The pellets were suspended in Buffer B (i.e. Buffer A plus 0.15 m NaCl) and spun at 100,000 × g for 45 min. The supernatant was designated as the membrane-associated fraction. The pellet was then solubilized in Buffer C (i.e. Buffer B plus 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and centrifuged at 40,000 × g. The supernatant was designated as the membrane-bound fraction. The AcP activity was performed as described previously with para-nitrophenyl phosphate as the substrate in a citrate buffer, pH 5.5 (22Lin M.F. Clinton G.M. Biochem.

To compare the tumorigenicity of PAcP knockdown stable sublines, 1 × 106 cells at the exponential growth phase were suspended in 0.1 ml of medium, mixed with 0.1 ml of Matrigel (BD Biosciences), and injected subcutaneously in the hind flank of female nude mice (Charles River Laboratories) (19Lin M.F.

Animal maintenance and tumor measurement were done according to National Institutes of Health guidelines and the specific guidelines at our medical center. The protocol was approved by the University of Nebraska Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Experimental results were expressed as the mean ± S.E. Paired two-tailed Student's t tests were used for comparison between each groups. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To investigate the correlation of cPAcP expression with ErbB-2 tyrosyl phosphorylation, we examined the phosphorylation status of specific Tyr residues of ErbB-2 with commercially available Abs in both LNCaP and MDA PCa2b cells. As shown in Fig. 1A (upper panel), in regular culture medium, the expression of cPAcP decreased in LNCaP C-81 cells; concurrently, the overall Tyr(P) level of ErbB-2 elevated, correlating with increased cell growth rate by about 2-fold (Fig. 1A, lower panel). Notably, phosphorylation of Tyr1221/2 and Tyr1248, but not Tyr877 or Tyr1112, was elevated in C-81 cells, higher than that in C-33 cells. In parallel, in MDA PCa2b p89 cells, cPAcP decreased, cell growth increased by about 2-fold, and Tyr1221/2 phosphorylation was greatly elevated (Fig. 1B). The phosphorylation of Tyr1112 and Tyr1248 was only slightly elevated with no significant change at Tyr877 (Fig. 1B). The data collectively imply Tyr1221/2 and possibly also Tyr1248 as potential dephosphorylation sites by cPAcP in PCa cells, resulting in growth regulation. To determine the interaction of cPAcP and ErbB-2, we performed co-IP of cPAcP with ErbB-2 in a non-permissive growth condition. As shown in Fig. 2A, ErbB-2 co-immunoprecipitated with cPAcP by anti-PAcP Abs. The 50-kDa form of PAcP is the mature glycosylated subunit, and the 42-kDa protein is an intermediate form of processing product (20Veeramani S. Yuan T.C. Chen S.J. Lin F.F. Petersen J.E. Shaheduzzaman S. Srivastava S. MacDonald R.G. Lin M.F. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2005; 12: 805-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Both forms of PAcP proteins are recognized by anti-PAcP Ab (20Veeramani S. Yuan T.C. Chen S.J. Lin F.F. Petersen J.E. Shaheduzzaman S. Srivastava S. MacDonald R.G. Lin M.F. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2005; 12: 805-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This co-IP was further validated by reciprocal co-IP (Fig. 2B). Significantly, only the mature 50-kDa cPAcP was seen to co-immunoprecipitate with ErbB-2 by anti-ErbB-2 Ab, even after prolonged exposure (Fig. 2B). The data together indicate that cPAcP and ErbB-2 are in the same functional complex. To clarify the co-subcellular localization of cPAcP and ErbB-2, we subfractionated membrane, cytosol, and nuclear fractions of LNCaP C-33 cells from both subconfluent and confluent cells under a non-permissive growth condition. Immunoblotting revealed that ErbB-2 was in all three fractions, and the distribution was independent of cell density (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, in subconfluent cells, the majority of cPAcP protein was localized in the membrane fraction, whereas in confluent cells, cPAcP was greatly enriched in the cytosolic fraction by about 3-fold (Fig. 2C). Unexpectedly, we observed a subgroup of cPAcP in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 2C). Further, the membrane fraction of p52Shc that mediates receptor tyrosine phosphorylation signaling was reduced by about 40% in confluent cells (Fig. 2C). EGFR, PYK2, and HNF3α served as markers for membrane, cytosol, and nucleus, respectively (Fig. 2C). We examined the interaction of cPAcP with ErbB-2 in the membrane and the cytosolic fractions of confluent LNCaP C-33 cells under non-permissive growth condition. Reciprocal co-IP showed that cPAcP interacts with ErbB-2 preferentially in cytosol than in membrane fraction (Fig. 2, D and E). Additionally, we quantified AcP activity in each fraction of confluent cells after ultracentrifugation. As shown in supplemental Table 1, both AcP and PAcP activities were detected in cytosol and membrane-bound fractions with ∼40% PAcP activity in cytosol, similar to that in Fig. 2C. Thus, the data clearly showed the presence of cytosolic cPAcP in LNCaP C-33 cells, which is enriched in confluent cells under a non-permissive growth condition and interacts with ErbB-2 protein in the same functional complex. We explored the interaction of cPAcP with ErbB-2 by transiently transfected LNCaP C-81 cells with PAcP cDNA encoding WT PAcP protein. Control cells were transfected with the vector alone or the expression vector encoding mutant PAcP (H12A) that lacks PTP activity (32Zhang X.Q. Lee M.S. Zelivianski S. Lin M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2544-2550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Preliminary data (supplemental Fig. 1) showed that when compared with C-33 cells (lane 1), the overall tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB-2 and Tyr877, Tyr1221/2, and Tyr1248 phosphorylation levels were highly elevated in control C-81 cells transfected with vector alone (lane 2) or in the expression of inactive H12A PAcP (lanes 3 and 4). In cells expressing WT cPAcP, phosphorylation levels of Tyr1221/2 and Tyr1248 decreased in a dose-dependent manner and had the same low level as that in C-33 cells (supplemental Fig. 1, lane 1 versus lane 6). The effect of cPAcP expression on the tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB-2 was seen at 48 and 72 h after transfection (Fig. 3A). The overall tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB-2 an"

https://openalex.org/W2079369487,"PFKFB3 is the gene that codes for the inducible isoform of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (iPFK2), a key regulatory enzyme of glycolysis. As one of the targets of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), PFKFB3/iPFK2 is up-regulated by thiazolidinediones. In the present study, using PFKFB3/iPFK2-disrupted mice, the role of PFKFB3/iPFK2 in the anti-diabetic effect of PPARγ activation was determined. In wild-type littermate mice, PPARγ activation (i.e. treatment with rosiglitazone) restored euglycemia and reversed high fat diet-induced insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. In contrast, PPARγ activation did not reduce high fat diet-induced hyperglycemia and failed to reverse insulin resistance and glucose intolerance in PFKFB3+/− mice. The lack of anti-diabetic effect in PFKFB3+/− mice was associated with the inability of PPARγ activation to suppress adipose tissue lipolysis and proinflammatory cytokine production, stimulate visceral fat accumulation, enhance adipose tissue insulin signaling, and appropriately regulate adipokine expression. Similarly, in cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes, knockdown of PFKFB3/iPFK2 lessened the effect of PPARγ activation on stimulating lipid accumulation. Furthermore, PPARγ activation did not suppress inflammatory signaling in PFKFB3/iPFK2-knockdown adipocytes as it did in control adipocytes. Upon inhibition of excessive fatty acid oxidation in PFKFB3/iPFK2-knockdown adipocytes, PPARγ activation was able to significantly reverse inflammatory signaling and proinflammatory cytokine expression and restore insulin signaling. Together, these data demonstrate that PFKFB3/iPFK2 is critically involved in the anti-diabetic effect of PPARγ activation. PFKFB3 is the gene that codes for the inducible isoform of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (iPFK2), a key regulatory enzyme of glycolysis. As one of the targets of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), PFKFB3/iPFK2 is up-regulated by thiazolidinediones. In the present study, using PFKFB3/iPFK2-disrupted mice, the role of PFKFB3/iPFK2 in the anti-diabetic effect of PPARγ activation was determined. In wild-type littermate mice, PPARγ activation (i.e. treatment with rosiglitazone) restored euglycemia and reversed high fat diet-induced insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. In contrast, PPARγ activation did not reduce high fat diet-induced hyperglycemia and failed to reverse insulin resistance and glucose intolerance in PFKFB3+/− mice. The lack of anti-diabetic effect in PFKFB3+/− mice was associated with the inability of PPARγ activation to suppress adipose tissue lipolysis and proinflammatory cytokine production, stimulate visceral fat accumulation, enhance adipose tissue insulin signaling, and appropriately regulate adipokine expression. Similarly, in cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes, knockdown of PFKFB3/iPFK2 lessened the effect of PPARγ activation on stimulating lipid accumulation. Furthermore, PPARγ activation did not suppress inflammatory signaling in PFKFB3/iPFK2-knockdown adipocytes as it did in control adipocytes. Upon inhibition of excessive fatty acid oxidation in PFKFB3/iPFK2-knockdown adipocytes, PPARγ activation was able to significantly reverse inflammatory signaling and proinflammatory cytokine expression and restore insulin signaling. Together, these data demonstrate that PFKFB3/iPFK2 is critically involved in the anti-diabetic effect of PPARγ activation.

Because TZDs are effective in liver- or muscle-specific PPARγ-deficient mice (9Matsusue K. Haluzik M. Lambert G. Yim S.H. Gavrilova O. Ward J.M. Brewer Jr., B. Reitman M.L. Gonzalez F.J. J. Clin.

Further investigations have suggested two adipose tissue-based mechanisms to largely explain the anti-diabetic effect of PPARγ activation (6Evans R.M. Barish G.D. Wang Y.X. Nat.

In the first mechanism, PPARγ activation by TZDs appropriately alters the expression of adipocyte genes that are involved in lipogenesis and triglyceride synthesis to increase the capacity of fat storage in adipose tissue (16Guan H.P.

This leads to reduction of the circulating levels of free fatty acids (FFA) and thereby reversal of FFA-induced insulin resistance. In the second mechanism, PPARγ activation by TZDs suppresses the adipose tissue inflammatory response (20Wellen K.E. Uysal K.T. Wiesbrock S. Yang Q. Chen H. Hotamisligil G.S.

Barish G.D. Wang Y.X. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). However, the molecular link between the two mechanisms remains to be elucidated. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ inducible 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase fructose-2,6-bisphosphate thiazolidinedione glycerol kinase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase reactive oxygen species c-Jun N-terminal kinase nuclear factor κB tumor necrosis factor α interleukin-6 free fatty acid(s) high fat diet phosphate-buffered saline kinase-dead control reverse transcription. Upon activation of PPARγ, a number of PPARγ target genes are altered to promote fat storage in adipose tissue (16Guan H.P. Li Y. Jensen M.V. Newgard C.B. Steppan C.M. Lazar M.A. Nat.

For example, TZDs stimulate the expression of glycerol kinase (GyK), which increases triglyceride synthesis in adipocytes by providing glycerol 3-phosphate as a key substrate (16Guan H.P. Li Y. Jensen M.V. Newgard C.B. Steppan C.M. Lazar M.A. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1122-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Similarly, PPARγ activation stimulates the expression of the cytosolic isoform of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) in adipocytes (24Tontonoz P. Hu E. Devine J. Beale E.G. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 351-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Devine J.H. Eubank D.W. Clouthier D.E. Tontonoz P. Spiegelman B.M. Hammer R.E. Beale E.G. J. Biol.

This increases glyceroneogenesis and provides another way to synthesize glycerol 3-phosphate and consequently triglycerides in adipocytes/adipose tissue (27Duplus E. Benelli C. Reis A.F. Fouque F. Velho G. Forest C. Biochimie. 2003; 85: 1257-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 28Forest C. Tordjman J. Glorian M. Duplus E. Chauvet G. Quette J. Beale E.G. Antoine B. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 1125-1129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At this point, although the stimulatory effect of PPARγ activation on GyK and PEPCK expression is increasingly documented, the involvement of GyK and/or PEPCK in the anti-diabetic effect of PPARγ activation requires further exploration (29Tan G.D. Debard C. Tiraby C. Humphreys S.M. Frayn K.N. Langin D. Vidal H. Karpe F. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 811-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 30Franckhauser S. Muñoz S. Elias I. Ferre T. Bosch F. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there are no published data to address whether or not GyK and/or PEPCK are involved in the anti-inflammatory effect of PPARγ activation. In response to TZDs, the expression of several proinflammatory genes is decreased in the adipose tissue in both rodents and human patients with type 2 diabetes (18Kolak M. Yki-Järvinen H. Kannisto K. Tiikkainen M. Hamsten A. Eriksson P. Fisher R.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 92: 720-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 31Xu H. Barnes G.T. Yang Q. Tan G. Yang D. Chou C.J. Sole J.

Further, PPARγ activation in both adipose tissue macrophages and adipocytes contributes to the suppression of the adipose tissue inflammatory response (21Stienstra R. Duval C. Keshtkar S. van der Laak J. Kersten S. Müller M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 22620-22627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 32Permana P.A. Zhang W. Wabitsch M.

To date, mediators that are involved in the effect of PPARγ activation on adipocyte inflammatory response are largely unknown. PFKFB3/iPFK2 is a target gene of PPARγ (33Nielsen R. Pedersen T.A. Hagenbeek D. Moulos P. Siersbaek R. Megens E. Denissov S. Børgesen M. Francoijs K.J. Mandrup S. Stunnenberg H.G. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 2953-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) and is stimulated by TZDs (34Atsumi T. Nishio T. Niwa H. Takeuchi J. Bando H. Shimizu C. Yoshioka N. Bucala R. Koike T. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 3349-3357Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The expression of PFKFB3/iPFK2 is at high levels in adipose tissue and at very low levels in the liver and skeletal muscle (34Atsumi T. Nishio T. Niwa H. Takeuchi J. Bando H. Shimizu C. Yoshioka N. Bucala R. Koike T. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 3349-3357Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 35Chesney J. Telang S. Yalcin A. Clem A. Wallis N. Bucala R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 331: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated a pivotal role for PFKFB3/iPFK2 in regulating adipose tissue function and systemic insulin sensitivity (36Huo Y. Guo X. Li H. Wang H. Zhang W. Wang Y. Zhou H. Gao Z. Telang S. Chesney J. Chen Y.E. Ye J. Chapkin R.S. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 3713-3721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, PFKFB3/iPFK2 protects against fatty acid oxidation-associated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, thereby reducing inflammatory signaling through JNK1 and NF-κB pathways to suppress adipocyte inflammatory response (36Huo Y. Guo X. Li H. Wang H. Zhang W. Wang Y. Zhou H. Gao Z. Telang S. Chesney J. Chen Y.E. Ye J. Chapkin R.S. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 3713-3721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, the extent to which PFKFB3/iPFK2 participates in the in vivo effects of PPARγ activation is not known. Using PFKFB3/iPFK2-disrupted mice, the present study demonstrates that PFKFB3/iPFK2 is involved in the anti-diabetic effect of PPARγ activation, probably by increasing the ability of adipose tissue to store fat and by suppressing adipose tissue inflammatory response. In addition, the mechanisms underlying the involvement of PFKFB3/iPFK2 in the effects of PPARγ activation are explored in cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Because homozygous disruption of PFKFB3/iPFK2 is embryonic lethal (35Chesney J. Telang S. Yalcin A. Clem A. Wallis N. Bucala R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 331: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), PFKFB3+/− mice, provided by Drs. Telang and Chesney (University of Louisville), were generated as described previously (35Chesney J. Telang S. Yalcin A. Clem A. Wallis N. Bucala R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 331: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and used for the present study. Considering that rosiglitazone lowers the levels of plasma glucose and improves systemic insulin sensitivity only in diabetic mice, male PFKFB3+/− and wild-type littermates (C57BL/6J background) were fed a high fat diet (HFD) prior to treatment with rosiglitazone. It has been recently shown that feeding an HFD to PFKFB3+/− mice exacerbates systemic insulin resistance and adipose tissue inflammatory response (36Huo Y. Guo X. Li H. Wang H. Zhang W. Wang Y.

Briefly, all mice were maintained as previously described (36Huo Y. Guo X. Li H. Wang H. Zhang W. Wang Y. Zhou H. Gao Z. Telang S. Chesney J. Chen Y.E. Ye J. Chapkin R.S. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 3713-3721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). At the age of 5–6 weeks, mice were fed an HFD (60% fat calories, 20% protein calories, and 20 carbohydrate calories) (Research Diets, Inc., New Brunswick, NJ) for 12 weeks. During the last 4 weeks of the feeding regimen, HFD-fed mice were treated with rosiglitazone (10 mg/kg/day in PBS; Avandia tablets) or vehicle (PBS) via oral gavages. As the control, the age-matched male mice were fed a low fat diet (10% fat calories, 20% protein calories, and 70% carbohydrate calories) and received no treatment. The composition of both HFD and low fat diet has been described previously (36Huo Y. Guo X. Li H. Wang H. Zhang W. Wang Y. Zhou H. Gao Z. Telang S. Chesney J. Chen Y.E. Ye J. Chapkin R.S. Wu C. J.

Body weight and food intake of the mice were recorded every 4 days during the 12-week feeding period. At the end of the feeding/treatment regimen, mice were fasted for 4 h before sacrifice for collection of blood and tissue samples as described previously (36Huo Y. Guo X. Li H. Wang H. Zhang W.

Some tissue samples were either fixed and embedded for histological analyses or frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at −80 °C for further analyses. Some mice were fasted similarly and used for glucose and insulin tolerance tests. For a separate study to analyze the role of PPARγ in regulating PFKFB3 expression, PPARγ2−/− mice and their wild-type littermates were generated as described before (40Zhang J. Fu M. Cui T. Xiong C. Xu K. Zhong W. Xiao Y. Floyd D. Liang J. Li E. Song Q. Chen Y.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 10703-10708Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and used for adipose tissue sample collection and embryonic fibroblast isolation (see below). All study protocols were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Texas A&M University and the University of Michigan. The levels of plasma metabolites, such as glucose, triglycerides, and FFA, were measured using metabolic assay kits (Sigma and BioVision (Mountain View, CA)). The levels of plasma hormones (i.e. insulin and leptin) were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (Crystal Chem Inc., Downers Grove, IL). The levels of adipose tissue fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (F26P2) were determined using the 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase activation method as described previously (39Wu C. Khan S.A. Peng L.J. Li H. Carmella S.G. Lange A.J. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 291: E536-E543Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The assays were conducted as previously described (39Wu C. Khan S.A.

After fasting for 4 h, mice received a peritoneal injection of d-glucose (2 g/kg) or insulin (0.5 unit/kg) (Humulin®, Lilly). The assays were conducted as described previously (36Huo Y. Guo X. Li H. Wang H. Zhang W. Wang Y. Zhou H. Gao Z. Telang S. Chesney J. Chen Y.E. Ye J. Chapkin R.S. Wu C. J. Biol.

Briefly, freshly isolated adipose tissue samples were washed several times with PBS and incubated in a final volume of 1 ml of high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin in the presence or absence of 10 μm isoproterenol at 37 °C for 3 h. Aliquots of the medium were sampled hourly to quantify glycerol content using metabolic kits (BioVision, Mountain View, CA). The rate of lipolysis was estimated as the efflux of glycerol. The paraffin-embedded adipose tissue blocks were cut into sections of 5-μm thickness and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. 3T3-L1 cells were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and differentiated in induction medium for 6–8 days as described previously (36Huo Y. Guo X. Li H. Wang H. Zhang W. Wang Y. Zhou H. Gao Z. Telang S. Chesney J. Chen Y.E. Ye J. Chapkin R.S. Wu C. J. Biol.

To clarify the role of PPARγ activation in stimulating PFKFB3 expression, differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were treated with a PPARα agonist, Wy14643 (10 μm) or GW7647 (0.1 μm); a dual agonist of PPARα and PPARδ, GW0742 (0.2 μm); a PPARδ agonist, GW501516 (0.2 μm); a PPARγ agonist, GW7845 (0.2 μm) or rosiglitazone (1 μm); or vehicle (0.1% DMSO) for 24 h and harvested for further analyses. In addition, mouse embryonic fibroblast cells were isolated from PPARγ2+/+ mice and PPARγ2−/− mice and treated with retrovirus containing the cDNA of PPARγ1, PPARγ2, or control as described previously (40Zhang J. Fu M. Cui T. Xiong C. Xu K. Zhong W. Xiao Y. Floyd D. Liang J. Li E. Song Q. Chen Y.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 10703-10708Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The treated mouse embryonic fibroblast cells were then harvested to determine changes in the mRNA levels of PFKFB3. Using a PFKFB3 promoter-luciferase construct, the effect of PPARγ2 overexpression on activating PFKFB3 promoter was determined by the luciferase assay as described by Cao et al. (43Cao H. Gerhold K.

To explore the direct role of PFKFB3/iPFK2 in modulating the effect of PPARγ activation, stable PFKFB3/iPFK2-knockdown (iPFK2-KD) 3T3-L1 cells and control (iPFK2-Ctrl) 3T3-L1 cells were used.

During the last 48 h of differentiation, both iPFK2-KD and iPFK2-Ctrl adipocytes were treated with rosiglitazone (1 μm) or vehicle (0.1% DMSO) and used to quantify the expression of PPARγ target genes as well as for further analyses using the methods described below. To quantify adipocyte lipid content, the cells were stained with Oil Red O. The lipid-associated dye was extracted with isopropyl alcohol for 15 min. The OD of the extraction solution was measured using a spectrophotometer at 510 nm (40Zhang J. Fu M. Cui T. Xiong C. Xu K. Zhong W. Xiao Y. Floyd D. Liang J. Li E. Song Q. Chen Y.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 10703-10708Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). To determine the rate of glucose incorporation into lipid, each well (6-well plate) of the cells was incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1 μCi of [U-14C]glucose for 24 h as described previously (44Stansbie D. Brownsey R.W. Crettaz M. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1976; 160: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). After sequential extraction with 30% KOH, 95% ethanol, 9 m H2SO4, and petroleum ether, the amount of 14C-labeled lipids was quantified using a Beckman liquid scintillation counter. To analyze inflammatory signaling, the cells were incubated with palmitate (250 μm) or vehicle (0.5% bovine serum albumin) for 24 h. Cell lysates were then prepared and used for Western blots to measure the levels and phosphorylation states of JNK and NF-κB p65. To determine adipocyte expression of proinflammatory cytokines and adipokines, the total RNA of the cells was prepared and used for real-time RT-PCR. To determine changes in insulin signaling, the cells were treated with or without insulin (100 nm) for 30 min prior to harvest. Cell lysates were prepared and used to measure the levels and phosphorylation of Akt using Western blots. PFKFB3/iPFK2-knockdown-associated increase in fatty acid oxidation triggers adipocyte inflammatory response (36Huo Y. Guo X. Li H. Wang H. Zhang W. Wang Y. Zhou H. Gao Z. Telang S. Chesney J.

To verify this concept, the differentiated stable iPFK2-KD and iPFK2-Ctrl adipocytes were treated with rosiglitazone (1 μm) or vehicle (0.1% DMSO) for 48 h. In the last 24 h, 100 μm etomoxir (an inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1), with or without palmitate (250 μm), was added to rosiglitazone-treated cells. Thereafter, the cells were used to measure the production of ROS using the nitro blue tetrazolium assay as described previously (45Subauste A.R. Burant C.F. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol.

The total RNA was isolated from frozen tissue samples and cultured cells. RNA isolation and real-time RT-PCR were conducted as described previously (36Huo Y. Guo X. Li H. Wang H. Zhang W. Wang Y.

The mRNA levels were analyzed for PFKFB3, GyK, PEPCK, PPARγ, resistin, adiponectin, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in adipose tissue samples and/or cell samples. Lysates were prepared from frozen tissue samples and cultured cells. Western blots were conducted as described previously (38Wu C. Kang J.E. Peng L.J. Li H. Khan S.A. Hillard C.J. Okar D.A.

Numeric data are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical significance was assessed by unpaired, two-tailed analysis of variance or Student's t test. Differences were considered significant at the two-tailed p < 0.05. After a feeding of an HFD, wild-type littermates exhibited insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, and hyperglycemia. In these wild-type mice, treatment with rosiglitazone for 4 weeks normalized the levels of plasma glucose (169.67 ± 6.05 versus 242.59 ± 6.23 mg/dl, p < 0.01; Fig. 1A) and corrected glucose intolerance and insulin resistance (Fig. 1, B and C) compared with vehicle. Additionally, treatment with rosiglitazone lowered the circulating levels of insulin (Fig. 1D) as well as FFA and triglycerides (Table 1), indicating the reversal of hyperinsulinemia and hyperlipidemia. These data confirmed the anti-diabetic effect of PPARγ activation. Consistent with our previous study (36Huo Y. Guo X. Li H. Wang H. Zhang W. Wang Y. Zhou H. Gao Z. Telang S. Chesney J. Chen Y.E.

We performed comparative studies between wild type (WT) A1 domain and the R1450E variant that dissociates the tri-domain complex by destabilizing the A1 domain. Using urea denaturation and differential scanning calorimetry, we demonstrated the destabilization of the A1 domain structure concomitantly results in a reduced interaction among the three A domains. This dissociation results in spontaneous binding of R1450E to GPIbα without ristocetin with an apparent KD of 85 ± 34 nm, comparable with that of WT (36 ± 12 nm) with ristocetin. The mutant blocked 100% ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination, whereas WT failed to inhibit. The mutant enhanced shear-induced platelet aggregation at 500 and 5000 s−1 shear rates, reaching 42 and 66%, respectively. Shear-induced platelet aggregation did not exceed 18% in the presence of WT. A1A2A3 variants were added before perfusion over a fibrin(ogen)-coated surface. At 1500 s−1, platelets from blood containing WT adhered <10% of the surface area, whereas the mutant induced platelets to rapidly bind, covering 100% of the fibrin(ogen) surface area. Comparable results were obtained with multimeric VWF when ristocetin (0.5 mg/ml) was added to blood before perfusion. EDTA or antibodies against GPIbα and αIIbβ3 blocked the effect of the mutant and ristocetin on platelet activation/adhesion. Therefore, the termination of A domain association within VWF in solution results in binding to GPIba and platelet activation under high shear stress.

Platelet adhesion at sites of vascular injury contributes to the arrest of bleeding as well as to the pathologic occlusion of diseased vessels under elevated shear stress.

The interaction between VWF and GPIbα occurs when the binding site for GPIbα in the A1 domain of VWF has been exposed by the influence of high fluid forces or when the multimeric protein has been immobilized (14.Shankaran H. Alexandridis P. Neelamegham S. Blood. 2003; 101: 2637-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This activation can also be induced by naturally occurring gain-of-function mutations in the A1 domain that causes Type 2B von Willebrand disease, which increases the binding affinity for platelet GPIbα (15.Federici A.B. Mannucci P.M. Castaman G. Baronciani L. Bucciarelli P. Canciani M.T. Pecci A. Lenting P.J. De Groot P.G. Blood. 2009; 113: 526-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). VWF activation can also be induced artificially with the modulator, ristocetin (16.Azuma H. Sugimoto M. Ruggeri Z.M. Ware J. Thromb. Haemost. 1993; 69: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Previously, we described that isolated A2 domain binds to A1 domain and blocks the interaction with platelet GPIbα (17.Martin C. Morales L.D. Cruz M.A. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2007; 5: 1363-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Based on this observation, we proposed that an interdomain interaction between A1 and A2 domains may be a regulatory mechanism for the activation of VWF in solution. We have identified the gain-of-function mutation R1450E for which GPIbα binding activity has been characterized with a low binding activity for purified A2 domain (8.Morales L.D. Martin C. Cruz M.A. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2006; 4: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 18.Yago T. Lou J. Wu T. Yang J. Miner J.J. Coburn L. López J.A. Cruz M.A. Dong J.F. McIntire L.V. McEver R.P. Zhu C. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 3195-3207PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we have used recombinant A1A2A3 tri-domains to demonstrate that the R1450E mutation alters both the stability of A1 and its interdomain interaction with both the A2 and A3 domains, and like Type 2B VWF, it induces spontaneous binding to GPIbα. Moreover, this spontaneous binding of the monomeric A1A2A3 mutant potentiated platelet activation in a shear stress-dependent manner. The results described here show that the destabilization of A1 by the R1450E mutation alters domain association within the A1A2A3 tri-domain and enhances the binding to GPIbα, demonstrating a novel coupling between A1 domain stability and tri-domain association. In addition, the A1A2A3 segment used in this study appears to be the smallest size of VWF that contains this regulatory mechanism for the activation of VWF in solution. Antibodies 6D1, 7E3, and 10E5 were gifts from Dr. Barry Coller (The Rockefeller University, New York, NY). Monoclonal antibody 5D2 was obtained from Dr. Michael C.

Human fibrinogen was from Calbiochem. The recombinant A domain proteins (WT-A1, R1450E-A1 mutant, -A2, and -A3) were obtained as previously described (8.Morales L.D. Martin C. Cruz M.A. J. Thromb.

Haemost. 2007; 5: 1363-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The recombinant A1A2A3 (WT and R1450E mutant) proteins were expressed in mammalian (HEK293) cells and purified from the conditioned medium as we previously described (18.Yago T. Lou J. Wu T. Yang J. Miner J.J. Coburn L. López J.A. Cruz M.A. Dong J.F. McIntire L.V. McEver R.P. Zhu C. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 3195-3207PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Wu T. Lin J. Cruz M.A. Dong J.F. Zhu C. Blood. 2010; 115: 370-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The purity and the monomeric state of the recombinant proteins were verified by SDS-gel electrophoresis and gel filtration chromatography. The gel filtration analysis was conducted using an Amersham Biosciences Bioscience ÄKTA prime chromatography system equipped with two Superose 6TM 10/300 GL columns in tandem (GE Healthcare) at a constant flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The samples were diluted in 25 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (TBS). The analyses of the interaction between the A1 variants and A2 protein were performed as we described elsewhere (17.Martin C. Morales L.D. Cruz M.A. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2007; 5: 1363-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, the microtiter wells were coated with A2 or A1 protein (5 μg/ml) in 65 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, and blocked with 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA). The A1 or A2 protein bound to immobilized A2 or A1 protein, respectively, was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with antibody 5D2 for A1 domain or anti-human A2 antibody for A2 domain. Previously, we characterized the A1-R1450E mutant and demonstrated that this mutation does not affect the binding capacity for conformation-specific monoclonal antibody 5D2 (8.Morales L.D. Martin C. Cruz M.A. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2006; 4: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 18.Yago T. Lou J. Wu T. Yang J. Miner J.J. Coburn L. López J.A. Cruz M.A. Dong J.F. McIntire L.V. McEver R.P. Zhu C. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 3195-3207PubMed Google Scholar). For competition assays, microtiter wells containing immobilized A2 protein (5 μg/ml) were incubated with increasing concentrations of the WT or R1450E mutant mixed with a fixed concentration of biotinylated WT-A1 protein (0.25 μm). Bound biotinylated WT-A1 was detected using neutravidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Pierce). Monoclonal antibody VP-1 was diluted to 5 μg/ml with 50 mm carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, and used to coat the wells of a microtiter plate. Coating was carried out overnight at 4 °C. The wells were washed with TBS-Tween and blocked with 3% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20 for 60 min at 37 °C. Increasing concentrations of each WT or mutant A1A2A3 were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. After incubation, wells were then washed with TBS-Tween, and the bound A1A2A3 was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using polyclonal anti-VWF-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Dako). The wells were again washed, and the substrate (o-phenylenediamine, Sigma) was added. Substrate conversion reactions were stopped with 0.025 ml of 2 n H2SO4, and the plates were read at 490 nm. Net specific binding was determined by subtracting optical density values from wells coated only with BSA from the total binding values obtained. This assay was similarly performed as we described elsewhere (17.Martin C. Morales L.D. Cruz M.A. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2007; 5: 1363-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, microtiter wells were coated with 75 μl of a suspension of fixed platelets. After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, the wells were washed 1 time and then incubated with 1% paraformaldehyde. After 15 min of incubation, the wells were washed with TBS, and the wells were blocked by the addition of 3% (w/v) BSA for 1 h at 37 °C. To examine the binding of A1A2A3 proteins to GPIbα, increasing concentrations of each of the protein were mixed with ristocetin (0.5 mg/ml) or TBS and incubated in the platelet-coated wells for 1 h at 37 °C. A polyclonal anti-VWF-horseradish peroxidase conjugated (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) was used for detection of the A1A2A3 proteins. Net specific binding was determined by subtracting optical density values from wells coated only with BSA from the total binding values obtained in the wells coated with the corresponding protein. The software KaleidaGraph 4.0 was used for curve-fitting and to determine the approximate half-maximal binding values using the equation y = Bmax × x/(Kd + x). These values were reported as the mean ± S.E. Platelet agglutination was carried out in siliconized glass cuvettes at 37 °C with constant stirring at 1200 rpm in an eight-channel aggregometer (Bio/Data Corp. Horsham, PA). A suspension of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) containing different concentrations of each WT or mutant A1A3A3 protein was prepared. After 5 min of incubation at 37 °C, agglutination was initiated by the addition of ristocetin (Helena Laboratories, Beaumont, TX) to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. PRP was mixed with either WT or mutant A1A2A3 protein (250 nm) or buffer and incubated for 2 min at room temperature. Then the mixture was loaded onto a cone-and-plate viscometer (RS1, HAAKE Instrument Inc., Paramus, NJ) and exposed to shear stress of 500 or 5000 s−1 for 1 min. In some experiments the antibody 7E3 (20 μg/ml) was added to PRP. Shear-induced platelet aggregation was determined as the percentage reduction of single platelets as compared with the unsheared controls from the same donors as described elsewhere (21.Zhang J.N. Bergeron A.L. Yu Q. Sun C. McBride L. Bray P.F. Dong J.F. Thromb. Haemost. 2003; 90: 672-678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μl of sample was fixed in 0.5% glutaraldehyde, and the platelet count was determined by a Coulter Epics XL-MCL flow cytometer (Beckman-Coulter). The plates coated with fibrinogen or A1A2A3 proteins were prepared as we previously described. Human fibrinogen was diluted to 100 μg/ml in 65 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, and added to 35-mm culture dishes and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline, the plates were blocked with 3% BSA in phosphate-buffered saline. To obtain the blood, approval was obtained from the Baylor College of Medicine institutional review board for these studies. Informed consent was provided according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Perfusion assays were carried out as we described elsewhere (17.Martin C. Morales L.D. Cruz M.A. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2007; 5: 1363-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 22.Cruz M.A. Chen J. Whitelock J.L. Morales L.D. López J.A. Blood. 2005; 105: 1986-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). One ml of citrated whole blood containing WT, mutant, or buffer (TBS) was perfused over the analyte-surface-coated plate followed by TBS or phosphate-buffered saline. Tethered platelets were observed with phase contrast objectives and recorded by videomicroscopy. In some assays the number of platelets tethered to the surface was determined by overlaying a 36-square grid on 6 frames and counting and averaging the number of platelets in 12 randomly selected squares. In others the surface area covered by deposited platelets was determined by a computer-assisted program. In some experiments whole blood mixed with the mutant protein or buffer was incubated with 10 units/ml apyrase (grade III, Sigma), 5 mm EDTA, 10 μm prostacyclin (prostaglandin I2), and 20 μg/ml concentrations of antibodies 10E5 or 6D1 for 5 min before perfusion. In another experiments ristocetin (0.5 mg/ml) was added to whole blood right before to initiate perfusion. Some experiments were performed in triplicate or quadruplicate using different blood donors. Protein biotinylation was performed as directed by the manufacturer, and concentration was determined by the BCA method (Pierce). Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE gel was used to assess the purity of the VWF-A domain proteins. Urea denaturation of the WT and R1450E A1 single domain was monitored by circular dichroism spectroscopy as previously described (23.Auton M. Cruz M.A. Moake J. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 986-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 24.Auton M. Sedlák E. Marek J. Wu T. Zhu C. Cruz M.A. Biophys. J. 2009; 97: 618-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were performed on a VP-DSC instrument (MicroCal, GE Healthcare) with a 1°/min scan rate at 2 atmospheres using 0.5 mg/ml WT, R1450E A1, and A3 single domains and 0.2 mg/ml WT and R1450E A1A2A3 tri-domains in Tris-buffered saline at pH 7.4. Thermal transitions were calorimetrically irreversible, as no thermal transition was observed in subsequent temperature scans. All DSC traces were corrected for an irreversible scan that was used as the base line. Analysis of the excess heat capacity DSC transitions for the single domains was accomplished on the basis of a simple two-state irreversible model, N → F, as described by us previously considering only two significantly populated macroscopic states, the initial native state (N) and the final irreversible state (F) (24.Auton M. Sedlák E. Marek J. Wu T. Zhu C. Cruz M.A. Biophys. J. 2009; 97: 618-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The A1A2A3 tri-domain DSC transitions were analyzed according to the model by Lyubarev and Kurganov (26.Lyubarev A.E. Kurganov B.I. Biochemistry. 1998; 63: 434-440PubMed Google Scholar) involving two consecutive irreversible steps of reaction N → I → F, where N, I, and F are the native, intermediate, and irreversible state, as described by Sedlák et al. (25.Sedlák E. Zoldák G. Wittung-Stafshede P. Biophys. J. 2008; 94: 1384-1391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The A1 domain R1450E mutation has a significant decreased binding to immobilized A2 domain in comparison to WT A1 (Fig. 1A). This negative effect of the mutation was tested by the capacity of the R1450E mutant to block the interaction between WT and immobilized A2 domain. In this experiment both biotinylated-WT and non-biotinylated WT A1 domain or R1450E mutant were mixed. Fig. 1B shows that the mutant required >10.0 μm to block 50% binding of biotinylated WT, whereas non-biotinylated WT effectively blocked with <0.1 μm. These results confirm that mutation R1450E affects the contact site for A2 domain in A1 domain. This mutation was also expressed in the context of the A1A2A3 tri-domain protein and purified to homogeneity as we previously described. Both WT and mutant tri-domains proteins migrated under reduced conditions slower than their respective non-reduced forms, confirming the reduction of the disulfide bonds located in each A1 and A3 domains. According to non-reducing gel electrophoresis and gel filtration column chromatography, these proteins had an apparent molecular mass corresponding to 95 kDa (Fig. 2). Each protein eluted as a single homogeneous peak with an elution position consistent with the molecular weights determined by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions. Neither of the proteins formed dimers or any higher order aggregates.FIGURE 2SDS-PAGE and gel filtration analyses of recombinant A1A2A3 proteins. Inset, a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE (10%) verified the purity of the recombinant WT (1) and mutant (2) proteins under non-reducing conditions (MW, molecular mass). Both purified A1A2A3 proteins were subjected to gel filtration to analyze their native conformation. Using gel filtration column with a TBS mobile phase, the proteins were detected by their absorbance at 280 nm. The graph represents the elution profile for both A1A2A3 proteins (∼92 kDa), and the arrows above represent the elution volume for β-amylase (200 kDa) and human serum albumin (68 kDa). mAu, milliabsorbance units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To assess the effect of R1450E on the structural stability of the A1 single domain and A1 in the context of the A1A2A3 tri-domain, we performed both urea denaturation and differential scanning calorimetry (Fig. 3). In panel A, the thermal DSC transitions of WT and R1450E A1 single domains have a single irreversible transition temperature of 55.5 and 47 °C, respectively, demonstrating that the mutation destabilizes the A1 domain. The A3 domain has a much higher stability than A1, with a 67.5 °C irreversible transition temperature. We also did DSC on the A2 domain; however, it did not yield a thermal transition due to its high degree of disorder in the absence of neighboring domains. In panel B, the destabilizing effect of the mutation was also confirmed by isothermal urea denaturation at 25 °C in which the midpoint of urea transition decreased from ∼3 to 2 m urea for R1450E relative to WT A1. Panels C and D show the thermal DSC transitions of the WT and R1450E tri-domains, which are composed of two sequential irreversible transitions. The first transition is predominantly the A1 domain but could also have some contributions from A2 if it is more structured within the tri-domain. The second transition is due primarily to the A3 domain. This interpretation of the sequential unfolding of A1 followed by A3 is corroborated by both the DSC transitions of the single domains in panel A as well as the urea denaturation results we previously reported for both single A domains and the WT A1A2A3 tri-domain (23.Auton M. Cruz M.A. Moake J. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 986-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In WT A1A2A3, the first transition occurs at 58 °C followed by the second transition, which occurs at 60 °C. Relative to the single A1 and A3 domains, this corresponds to a net stabilization of A1 by 2.5 °C and a net destabilization of A3 by 7.5 °C as a result of the association of the domains within the tri-domain complex. For R1450E A1A2A3, the first transition occurs at 56.5 °C followed by the second transition that occurs at 63 °C. Relative to the single A1 and A3 domains, this corresponds to a net stabilization of R1450E A1 by 9.5 °C and a net destabilization of A3 by only 4.5 °C; however, relative to the WT tri-domain, the mutation destabilizes the A1 domain by 1.5 °C, and the A3 domain is stabilized by 3 °C. Another feature of these DSC transitions is that the R1450E mutation both separates and broadens the transitions, indicating that not only is the A1 domain destabilized, but this also results in a concomitant loss of interaction between A1 and its neighboring A2 and A3 domains within the tri-domain complex. This conclusion is also supported by the activation energy, a parameter derived from the curve-fitting of the excess heat capacity profiles that co-determine the energetic barrier of the irreversible transition. Comparing the activation energies in panel E, both the WT and R1450E single A1 domains and the first transition of the R1450E tri-domain have an average of 88.3 ± 5.5 kcal/mol, whereas the activation energy of the WT tri-domain is 120 kcal/mol. This indicates that the A1 domain in the R1450E tri-domain is essentially dissociated from the other domains because its activation energy is equivalent to that of the single A1 domain. However, in the WT tri-domain, the activation energy of the A1 domain is significantly greater than for the single A1 domain, indicating that an association between A1 and the neighboring A2 and A3 domains stabilizes the tri-domain complex. The A3 domain activation energies in panel F further support the idea that the stability of the tri-domain complex is predominantly influenced by the high stability of the A3 domain. As a single domain, the activation energy of A3 is a highly stable 130 kcal/mol that decreases to 46 kcal/mol in the WT tri-domain complex. In contrast, the activation energy of A3 in the R1450E tri-domain is only reduced to 74 kcal/mol. These results indicate that the A3 domain imparts stability to the A1 and A2 domains to enable stable contact interactions between domains, and when the A1 domain is destabilized, the stability of the A3 domain is partially restored due to perturbed domain interactions that are coupled to the stability of A1. We analyzed the effect of the R1450E mutation on the binding of A1A2A3 to ligands of A1 and A2 domains such as GPIbα and monoclonal antibody VP-1, respectively. We assessed the binding of WT (open squares) or mutant protein (open diamonds) to GPIbα without the modulator ristocetin (Fig. 4A). Although WT had poor binding activity, the mutant R1450E protein bound spontaneously to immobilized fixed platelets in a concentration-dependent and saturable manner with half-maximal binding observed at 85 ± 34 nm. This apparent dissociation constant was comparable with that obtained for WT protein (apparent KD ∼ 36 ± 12 nm) in the presence of ristocetin (Fig. 4A, closed squares). The binding of the mutant A1A2A3 protein to VP-1 was also markedly higher than that of WT as shown in Fig. 4B, indicating that the epitope recognized by the anti-A2 domain antibody (VP-1) in the mutant A1A2A3 protein is more accessible than in WT. These results indicate that the cryptic recognition sites for each GPIbα and VP-1 are exposed as a consequence of structural instability caused by the mutation R1450E in the A1 domain and the resulting perturbed domain interactions within the tri-domain. The ability of the mutant A1A2A3 in binding instantly to platelet GPIbα suggested that it should compete with multimeric VWF for binding to GPIbα. To test this speculation, we used ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination to analyze the capacity of the mutant tri-domain in blocking platelet agglutination (9.Cruz M.A. Diacovo T.G. Emsley J. Liddington R. Handin R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19098-19105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). As demonstrated in the binding assay, R1450E blocked 100% ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination at a concentration of 250 nm, whereas in sharp contrast, WT failed to impair ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination even at concentration of 1.0 μm (Fig. 5A). The strong inhibitory capacity of the R1450E tri-domain in ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination led us to test whether it could also function as an inhibitor in shear-induced platelet aggregation. The same PRP used in ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination was incubated with WT or mutant tri-domain (250 nm) for 1–2 min and sheared for 60 s at low (500 s−1) or high (5000 s−1) shear rates. Interestingly, R1450E significantly increased platelet aggregation (48% at low shear and 66% at high shear) in comparison with WT (9% at low and 18% at high shear rates) (Fig. 5B). The platelet-platelet interaction required the involvement of integrin αIIbβ3, as blocking the receptor with antibody 7E3 (20 μg/ml) completely prevented platelet aggregation. These results obtained in shear-induced platelet aggregation suggested that the interaction of the mutant tri-domain with GPIbα was sufficient to activate αIIbβ3 to bind soluble fibrinogen. We further examined the effect of the mutant on platelet adhesion to fibrinogen under hydrodynamic conditions, reasoning that platelets activated by the mutant will adhere more efficiently to immobilized fibrinogen.

IntroductionThe localization of integral membrane proteins to the appropriate intracellular compartment(s) is important for their functioning. Secretory proteins are transported to the apoplast through the default secretion pathway, in which the proteins move from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 4The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumSytsynaptotagminPMplasma membraneTGNtrans-Golgi networkEEearly endosomeSAsignal anchorBFAbrefeldin AGFPgreen fluorescent proteinEmGFPemerald GFPCFPcyan fluorescent proteinMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidSNAREsoluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptorsSMPplant synaptotagmin-like, mitochondria proteinPAQplasma-membrane-type aquaporin. to the Golgi and trans-Golgi network (TGN), and then finally to the plasma membrane (PM). However, the default pathway and sorting mechanism of integral membrane proteins are still unclear.Synaptotagmin (Syt) family proteins are calcium sensors that regulate exocytosis in mammalian cells (1.Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7629-7632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). In the presynaptic membrane of neuron cells, Syt I is known to regulate the calcium-dependent exocytosis of synaptic vesicles containing neurotransmitter by detecting calcium influx via voltage-dependent calcium channels after activation of neuron cells (2.Bai J. Chapman E.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 143-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Some isoforms of Syt are also related to the other calcium-dependent secretions, such as insulin release in pancreatic cell and maintenance of bone mass in bone cells (3.Gustavsson N. Lao Y. Maximov A. Chuang J.C. Kostromina E. Repa J.J. Li C. Radda G.K. Südhof T.C. Han W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 3992-3997Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 4.Zhao H. Ito Y. Chappel J. Andrews N.W. Teitelbaum S.L. Ross F.P. Dev. Cell. 2008; 14: 914-925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Syt homologs occur throughout the plant kingdom (5.Craxton M. BMC Genomics. 2004; 5: 43Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The Arabidopsis genome has five genes encoding Syt homologs (SYT1, -2, -4, and -5; full-length SYT3 cDNA has a stop codon at a functional region). Recently, we demonstrated that Arabidopsis SYT1 is involved in calcium-dependent freezing tolerance, which is related to the membrane-resealing system (6.Yamazaki T. Kawamura Y. Minami A. Uemura M. Plant Cell. 2008; 20: 3389-3404Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The membrane-resealing system was initially identified in animal cells as an emergency response system against disruption of the PM, and a mammalian Syt homolog, Syt VII, functions in membrane resealing as a sensor to detect the calcium influx from outside of the cells through the ruptured site of the PM (7.Bi G.Q. Alderton J.M. Steinhardt R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1747-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 8.Reddy A. Caler E.V. Andrews N.W.

In addition, Arabidopsis SYT1 is required for the maintenance of PM integrity and viability of root cells when exposed to severe salt stress, suggesting the involvement of the membrane-resealing system in such harsh conditions (11.Schapire A.L. Voigt B. Jasik J. Rosado A. Lopez-Cobollo R. Menzel D. Salinas J. Mancuso S. Valpuesta V. Baluska F. Botella M.A. Plant Cell. 2008; 20: 3374-3388Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar).The Syt family has one conserved transmembrane (TM) domain in the N terminus and two conserved calcium-binding domains (C2A and C2B) in the C terminus, and C2A and C2B of mammalian Syt I are actually bound to three and two calcium ions, respectively (1.Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7629-7632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 2.Bai J. Chapman E.R. Trends Biochem.

Cell. 2003; 112: 519-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar). Note that the membrane proteins with a single TM domain are classified according to protein structure and topogenesis: type I membrane proteins possess an N-terminal cleavable signal sequence and a subsequent stop-transfer sequence and are anchored with the Nexo/Ccyt topology; type II membrane proteins (also called SA-II proteins) possess an uncleaved type II signal-anchor (SA-II) sequence and are anchored with the Ncyt/Cexo topology; type I signal-anchor (SA-I) proteins (also called type III membrane proteins) possess an uncleaved SA-I sequence and are anchored with the Nexo/Ccyt topology; tail-anchored (TA) membrane proteins are anchored by a C-terminal TM domain with the Ncyt/Cexo topology (13.Goder V. Spiess M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 504: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 14.High S. Flint N. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Based on their structure and topology, the Syt family proteins are classified as SA-I proteins (15.Kida Y. Sakaguchi M. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Mihara K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 719-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).The structure of plant Syts differs from that of conventional mammalian Syts in several ways. The predicted TM domain of plant Syts consists of 23 or 22 amino acid residues, which is almost the same number of amino acid residues reported for mammalian Syts. However, plant Syts lack an N-terminal extension in the extracellular region, but have an SMP (plant synaptotagmin-like, mitochondria proteins) domain just beside the C-terminal side of the TM domain (5.Craxton M. BMC Genomics. 2004; 5: 43Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 16.Jiménez J.L. Davletov B. Proteins. 2007; 68: 770-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The SMP domain has also been identified in yeast Tcb and mammalian E-Syt families (mentioned later), although the function of the SMP domain in these proteins is unknown (5.Craxton M. BMC Genomics. 2004; 5: 43Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 16.Jiménez J.L. Davletov B. Proteins. 2007; 68: 770-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Our previous examination indicated that the topology of SYT1 is the same as that of mammalian Syt, i.e. the Nexo/Ccyt topology (6.Yamazaki T. Kawamura Y. Minami A. Uemura M. Plant Cell. 2008; 20: 3389-3404Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In addition, like mammalian Syts, the C2A domain of SYT1 has the conserved calcium-binding motif and exhibits the calcium-dependent interaction with lipid membranes; however, the C2B domain of SYT1 exhibits a calcium-independent interaction with the lipid membrane (11.Schapire A.L. Voigt B. Jasik J. Rosado A. Lopez-Cobollo R. Menzel D. Salinas J. Mancuso S. Valpuesta V. Baluska F. Botella M.A. Plant Cell. 2008; 20: 3374-3388Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar).Mammalian genomes contain thirteen Syt homologs, some of which are known to contain mRNA splicing variants. Mammalian Syt II, which is the most similar protein to Syt I, contains the SA-I sequence that integrates the translated proteins in the ER membrane and orientates C2A and C2B to the cytosol and the N-terminal extension to the extracellular space. It was established that the mammalian Syts examined in several cell types (for instance, neuron cells, endocrine β-cells, sperm cells, and mammalian cultured cells) are located in endomembrane systems (i.e. secretory vesicles, Golgi/TGN, lysosomes, acrosomes, etc.), but not in the PM (17.Berton F.

Interestingly, a novel mammalian Syt-related protein family, E-Syt (E-Syt1/KIAA0747/FAM62A, E-Syt2/FAM62B, and E-Syt3/FAM62C), contains five C2 domains (E-Syt1) or three C2 domains (E-Syt2 or E-Syt3) in the C terminus (5.Craxton M. BMC Genomics. 2004; 5: 43Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 30.Min S.W. Chang W.P. Südhof T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

DNA Res. 1998; 5: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). E-Syt1 is localized to some endomembrane systems, but E-Syt2 and E-Syt3 are localized to the PM, indicating that the C2 domain is also involved in subcellular localization (30.Min S.W. Chang W.P. Südhof T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 3823-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In addition, three yeast Syt homologs (Tcb1, Tcb2, and Tcb3) contain five or six C2 domains in their C termini, and Tcb2 seems to be localized to the PM (16.Jiménez J.L. Davletov B. Proteins. 2007; 68: 770-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 32.Creutz C.E. Snyder S.L. Schulz T.A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1208-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). An Arabidopsis synaptotagmin, SYT1, is also localized to the PM (6.Yamazaki T. Kawamura Y. Minami A. Uemura M. Plant Cell. 2008; 20: 3389-3404Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar).In this study, we analyzed the mechanism by which plant SYT1 is delivered to the PM. Whereas mammalian Syts localize to endomembranes, including synaptic vesicles, the TGN, and endosomes and lysosomes, but not to the PM, Arabidopsis SYT1 localizes to the PM. We were thus interested in establishing whether there is a specific mechanism that facilitates the differential localization of mammalian and plant Syts. We found that SYT1 may be synthesized on rough ER and then delivered to the PM through the Golgi. Moreover, the tandem C2A-C2B domains were found to be necessary for the delivery of SYT1 to the PM. A motif in the C2B domain was found to be required for localization to the PM, which may have been modified during the course of evolution to permit a novel function of plant Syts. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the localization mechanism of a plant SA-I protein.DISCUSSIONSyt proteins are classified as SA-I proteins and occur throughout eukaryotes. In animal cells, Syt functions as a calcium sensor to promote the membrane fusion in calcium-dependent events, such as membrane resealing (8.Reddy A. Caler E.V. Andrews N.W. Cell. 2001; 106: 157-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). In plant cells, we have recently demonstrated that the Arabidopsis Syt homolog, SYT1, is involved in calcium-dependent membrane resealing, which remarkably enhances freezing tolerance (6.Yamazaki T. Kawamura Y. Minami A. Uemura M. Plant Cell. 2008; 20: 3389-3404Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In addition, the C2A domain of SYT1 exhibits calcium-dependent binding to phospholipid membrane (11.Schapire A.L. Voigt B. Jasik J. Rosado A. Lopez-Cobollo R. Menzel D. Salinas J. Mancuso S. Valpuesta V. Baluska F. Botella M.A. Plant Cell. 2008; 20: 3374-3388Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Therefore, plant SYT1 may, like mammalian Syt proteins, act as a calcium sensor during membrane-membrane fusion events that are stimulated by calcium ions. However, the localization of plant SYT1 to the PM is different from that of mammalian Syts, because mammalian Syts have ubiquitously been found in endomembranes. Our current study suggests that the evolutionary modification of the C2B domain may be necessary for the delivery of SYT1 to the PM via the exocytotic pathway.Synthesis and Delivery of SYT1 to the Plasma MembraneOur biochemical analyses of SYT1-EmGFP driven by the SYT1 native promoter showed that GFP tagging at the C terminus of SYT1 has no effect on its localization and orientation (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2). In addition, the biochemical localization of SYT1 to the PM in seedlings agreed with the localization based on GFP fluorescence in leaf epidermal and mesophyll cells (supplemental Fig. S1). In roots, the localization pattern of SYT1-EmGFP differed at the various developmental stages (Fig. 3). This is thought to result from the expression level of the SYT1 gene in root tissue, because the fluorescence pattern of EmGFP driven by the SYT1 promoter in roots corresponded to that of SYT1-EmGFP (supplemental Fig. S2).Furthermore, we observed the subcellular localization pattern of SYT1-EmGFP in different types of root cells expressing different levels of its transcription. In division and elongation zones, SYT1-EmGFP was localized not only to the PM, but also to the rough ER (Fig. 3, A and D). SYT1 may not be retained in the ER, because a chimeric GFP containing an ER retention signal, HEDL, is localized only to rough ER and cortical ER, but not to the PM (53.Ridge R.W. Uozumi Y. Plazinski J. Hurley U.A. Williamson R.E. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 1253-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In some dividing cells, SYT1-EmGFP was localized to the cell plate (Fig. 3A). The plant cell plate is generated not only by delivery of newly synthesized materials from the ER via the Golgi, but also by endocytic recycling, which provides materials from the PM (54.Dhonukshe P. Baluska F. Schlicht M. Hlavacka A. Šamaj J. Friml J. Gadella Jr., T.W. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 137-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Recent work based on short term labeling of the PM with FM4–64 shows that vesicles derived from the PM via the endocytotic pathway are localized to the EE and TGN but not to the Golgi (48.Bolte S. Talbot C. Boutte Y. Catrice O. Read N.D. Satiat-Jeunemaitre B. J. Microsc. 2004; 214: 159-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). In our current study, vesicles containing SYT1-EmGFP did not colocalize completely with vesicles stained with FM4–64 (Fig. 3, A and B), suggesting that SYT1 is localized to the Golgi after synthesis on the ER, and less SYT1 is cycled from the PM back to the cytoplasm through the endocytotic pathway than typical materials incorporated in the PM. This is also supported by the incomplete localization of SYT1-EmGFP to BFA compartments (Fig. 3D), because the BFA compartment is speculated to be composed of TGN and EE membranes, but Golgi vesicles do not fuse to the BFA compartment (48.Bolte S. Talbot C. Boutte Y. Catrice O. Read N.D. Satiat-Jeunemaitre B. J. Microsc. 2004; 214: 159-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 50.Robinson D.G. Langhans M. Saint-Jore-Dupas C. Hawes C. Trends Plant Sci. 2008; 13: 405-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In addition, colocalization analysis of SYT1-EmGFP driven by the CaMV35S promoter and CFP-labeled Golgi marker showed that SYT1-EmGFP is also partially localized to Golgi vesicles (Fig. 5A). These results suggest that, after SYT1 is synthesized on the rough ER membrane, SYT1 is delivered to the PM by the exocytotic pathway via Golgi, and then tends to be retained in the PM. However, it is unclear whether SYT1 moves directly to the PM or via the TGN.Interestingly, SYT1-EmGFP was not uniformly localized to the PM and appeared to be located along some microfibers (Fig. 3C). We recently showed that SYT1 accumulates in a fraction of detergent-resistant plasma membrane regions, which are related to microdomains in the membrane, together with actins (55.Minami A. Fujiwara M. Furuto A. Fukao Y. Yamashita T. Kamo M. Kawamura Y. Uemura M. Plant Cell Physiol. 2009; 50: 341-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These results led us to speculate that, after the transport of SYT1 to the PM, SYT1 is redistributed in the PM via a specific mechanism. The localization of RHD2 NADPH oxidase, which is similar to that of SYT1, is affected by treatment with the microfilament-disrupting drug cytochalasin D, but not by the microtubule-disrupting drugs oryzalin or taxol (56.Takeda S. Gapper C. Kaya H. Bell E. Kuchitsu K. Dolan L. Science. 2008; 319: 1241-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Although both microfilaments and microtubules are localized in the root hair tip, microtubules are aligned with the short axis of cortical cells, whereas microfilaments are not (57.Baluska F. Salaj J. Mathur J. Braun M. Jasper F. Samaj J. Chua N.H. Barlow P.W. Volkmann D. Dev. Biol. 2000; 227: 618-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). It is possible that several factors facilitate the interaction between SYT1 and microfilaments.Localization of SYT1 to the PM Is Determined by Tandem C2A-C2B DomainsPlant Syts contain four domains (namely TM, transmembrane; SMP, synaptotagmin-like mitochondria membrane protein; and C2A and C2B, calcium-binding domains) (refer to Fig. 4A, row 1). The TM domain combined with a partial SMP domain was insufficient for anchoring of SYT1 to the membrane, but the TM domain combined with a complete SMP domain may be sufficient for localization to ER (Fig. 4B, rows 5 and 6; Fig. 5B, row 2), suggesting that the SMP domain is required for the integration of Syt into the rough ER membrane. This result also suggests that tandem C2A-C2B domains recruit SYT1 and then helps to transport it to the PM through the exocytotic pathway, because full-length SYT1 is localized to the PM. On the other hand, only tandem C2A-C2B domains are hard to be localized to the PM without SMP domain (Fig. 4B, row 2; Fig. 5A, row 2). In addition, less localization of tandem TM-SMP-C2A domains or of the C2B domain to the PM (Fig. 4B, rows 4 and 7) indicated that SMP-C2A domains or a single C2B domain may not be sufficient to localize SYT1 to the PM. Recently, transient expression analysis using a tobacco protoplast system showed that TM-SMP-C2A of SYT1 is localized to the ER (58.Lewis J.D. Lazarowitz S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 2491-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). We also confirmed that the TM-SMP-C2A of SYT1 was partially localized to ER (supplemental Fig. S5). This result suggests that tandem C2 domains require the SMP domain to interact with the PM.We clearly showed that, like mammalian Syts, SYT1 had the Nexo/Ccyt topology (Fig. 2), demonstrating that SYT1 is a SA-I protein. Based on animal and fungal models, the localization mechanism of plant integral membrane proteins has been described in terms of a membrane trafficking pathway. In tobacco cells, modification of the TM domain of human lysosome-associated protein LAMP1 or pea vacuolar sorting receptor VSR/BP80, which are type I membrane proteins with the Nexo/Ccyt topology, shows that the length of TM domain determines the localization of the proteins, with a short TM domain (17 amino acid residues) resulting in the membrane proteins being transported to the ER, and a long TM domain (22 or 23 amino acid residues) resulting in them being transported to the PM (59.Brandizzi F. Frangne N. Marc-Martin S. Hawes C. Neuhaus J.M. Paris N. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1077-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In mammalian Syts, the TM length also affects the localization of tail-anchored proteins that possess a single TM domain at the C terminus with an Ncyt/Cexo topology, such as cytochrome b5 or syntaxin (60.Pedrazzini E. Villa A. Borgese N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 4207-4212Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 61.Watson R.T. Pessin J.E. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 281: C215-C223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the localization of syntaxin, a component of membrane-membrane fusion, to the PM is determined by the long length of its TM domain (≥23 amino acid residues). A prediction program for the presence of TM domain, SOSUI (bp.nuap.nagoya-u.ac.jp/sosui), calculated that the length of the putative TM domain of SYT1 is 23 amino acid residues long, and that the corresponding regions in the other Arabidopsis SYT1 homologous proteins are of the same length. In the case of SYT1, however, the long TM domain does not determine localization to the PM, because truncated SYT1 without tandem C2A-C2B domains cannot localize to the PM (Fig. 4B, lane 6).Evolutionary Modulation of Plant Synaptotagmin LocalizationThe phylogenetic tree in Fig. 6 showed that plant Syt genes, which contain two calcium-binding domains in their C termini, were clearly separated into three clades (the SYT1/2, SYT3, and SYT4/5). Each clade contained Syt genes of monocotyledonous and eudicotyledonous plants, suggesting that the three clades diverged before the speciation of monocots and eudicots in the early stages of the angiosperm evolutionary process (Fig. 6A). In addition, the conservation of exon-intron structures among AtSyt1, AtSyt2, AtSyt4, and AtSyt5 implies that the angiosperm Syt genes share a common ancestral gene of SYT1/2, SYT3, and SYT4/5 (Fig. 6B). The most significant difference between the SYT1/2 and SYT3 clades and the SYT4/5 clade is the lack of the calcium-binding motifs in Loop 1 and Loop 3 of the C2B domain (supplemental Fig. S4). It is unclear whether genes in the SYT1/2 and SYT3 clades lost their calcium-binding motifs after duplication of the genes of SYT1/2/3 and SYT4/5 clades. However, a common ancestor of the Syt genes may have retained the calcium-binding motifs both in the C2A domain and in the C2B domain, because the calcium-binding motifs were conserved in both C2 domains in mammalian Syts.The loss of the calcium-binding motifs in the C2B domain during evolution may result in alterations in the localization of plant Syts in the SYT1/2/3 clades. In fact, SYT1 is localized mainly to the PM and partially to endomembranes, such as Golgi, but SYT5 is localized only to endomembranes (Fig. 7C). Moreover, the SYT1 mutant, which contains the calcium-binding motif in Loop 1 (but not in Loop 3) of the C2B domain by referring SYT5 sequences, was localized mainly to endomembranes. Loop 1 of the C2A domain of mammalian Syt1 bound to calcium was shown to penetrate the lipid bilayer, and NMR data show that Loop 2 and Loop 3 of the C2A domain also bind to phospholipids with calcium (62.Chae Y.K. Abildgaard F. Chapman E.R. Markley J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25659-25663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 63.Chapman E.R. Davis A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13995-14001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Because the C2B domain of SYT1 interacts with liposomes in a calcium-independent manner in vitro (11.Schapire A.L. Voigt B. Jasik J. Rosado A. Lopez-Cobollo R. Menzel D. Salinas J. Mancuso S. Valpuesta V. Baluska F. Botella M.A. Plant Cell. 2008; 20: 3374-3388Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), the lack of calcium-binding motifs may permit the calcium-independent interaction between SYT1 and the membrane. In addition, the evolutionarily modified amino acid residues of the C2 domains in SYT1, except for arginine and lysine, seem to be more bulky and hydrophobic than those of the SYT4/5 clade (Fig. 7B), raising the possibility that the calcium-independent penetration of Loop 1 into the lipid bilayer occurs and imparts some degree of specificity for the binding to the PM. On the other hand, as described above, the C2B domain alone may not contribute to the localization of SYT1 to the PM, for which tandem C2A-C2B domains are needed.Reconstructed fragments of the C2A or C2B domain in mammalian Syt I demonstrate that the C2B domain, but not the C2A domain, triggers the membrane-membrane fusion mediated by the SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptor) complex in a calcium-dependent manner (64.Gaffaney J.D. Dunning F.M. Wang Z. Hui E. Chapman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 31763-31775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition, the C2B domain interacts in a calcium-independent manner with a complex of SNAP-25/syntaxin known to target SNARE proteins to the PM of neuron cells, and the calcium-independent interaction is imparted by a polybasic region of the C2B domain (65.Rickman C. Archer D.A. Meunier F.A. Craxton M. Fukuda M. Burgoyne R.D. Davletov B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12574-12579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This calcium-independent interaction of the C2B domain with lipid membrane accelerates the calcium-triggered SNARE-mediated fusion (66.Loewen C.A. Lee S.M. Shin Y.K. Reist N.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 5211-5226Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Because the polybasic region is conserved in the C2B domain of plant Syts (see supplemental Fig. S4), plant Syts may interact in a calcium-independent manner with the SNAP-25-syntaxin complex. Therefore, to further understand the evolutionary effect of the absence of calcium-binding motifs in the C2B domain on plant Syts of SYT1/2/3 clades, it is necessary to investigate the interaction between plant SNARE proteins and Arabidopsis SYT1, and to assess their contribution to the localization of SYT1.Default Pathway and Sorting Mechanism of Plant SytsMechanisms or rules that determine the sorting of plant integral membrane proteins to the appropriate compartments after synthesis on rough ER have been proposed, such as the “length rule” described above. However, the length rule is not sufficient to interpret the sorting mechanism of the type I membrane proteins, because signals in the cytoplasmic tail also affect the export from the ER via the Golgi to the prevacuole compartment (67.daSilva L.L. Foresti O. Denecke J. Plant Cell."
https://openalex.org/W2022672750,"Cystatin M/E (CST6) is a nonredundant, epithelium-specific protease inhibitor with a presumed role in epidermal differentiation and tumor suppression. We have previously reported that cystatin M/E deficiency in Cst6(-/-) mice causes neonatal lethality because of excessive transepidermal water loss. Biochemical evidence suggests that cystatin M/E controls the activity of legumain, cathepsin L, cathepsin V, and transglutaminase-3. Using a genetic approach we sought to define the role of cystatin M/E in epithelial biology by identification of its target proteases and their downstream functions. Ablation of cathepsin L in a Cst6(-/-) background (Cst6(-/-)Ctsl(-/-) double-knockout mice) restored viability and resulted in normalization of stratum corneum morphology. Ablation of legumain or transglutaminase-3 in Cst6(-/-) mice, however, did not rescue the lethal phenotype. Intriguingly, both Cst6(-/-)Ctsl(-/-) and Cst6(-/-)Ctsl(+/-) mice were viable, but the absence of cystatin M/E caused scarring alopecia in adult animals. In the cornea of Cst6(-/-)Ctsl(+/-) mice, we observed keratitis, hyperplasia, and transition to a cornified epithelium. Evidence is provided that activation of cathepsin D and transglutaminase-1 are downstream events, dependent of cathepsin L activity. We conclude that a tightly regulated balance between cathepsin L and cystatin M/E is essential for tissue integrity in epidermis, hair follicles, and corneal epithelium."
https://openalex.org/W2052196365,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase (SAGA) protein complex is a coactivator for transcription by RNA polymerase II and has various activities, including acetylation and deubuiqitination of histones and recruitment of TATA-binding protein to promoters. The Spt7p subunit is subject to proteolytic cleavage at its C terminus resulting in removal of the Spt8p-binding domain and generation of the SAGA-related SALSA/SAGA-like (SLIK) protein complex. Here, we report identification of the protease responsible for this cleavage. Screening of a protease knock-out collection revealed PEP4 to be required for cleavage of Spt7p within SAGA in vitro. Endogenous formation of truncated Spt7p was abolished in cells lacking PEP4. Purified Pep4p but not catalytic dead mutant Pep4p or unrelated Prc1p protease specifically cleaved Spt7p within SAGA into SLIK-related Spt7p. Interestingly, SAGA lacking Spt8p was more sensitive to Pep4p-mediated truncation of Spt7p, suggesting that Spt8p counteracted its own release from SAGA. Strains mimicking constitutive SLIK formation showed increased resistance to rapamycin treatment, suggesting a role for SLIK in regulating cellular responses to nutrient stress."
https://openalex.org/W2075350584,"Akt is perhaps the most frequently activated oncoprotein in human cancers. Overriding cell cycle checkpoint in combination with the inhibition of apoptosis are two principal requirements for predisposition to cancer. Here we show that the activation of Akt is sufficient to promote these two principal processes, by inhibiting Chk1 activation with concomitant inhibition of apoptosis. These activities of Akt cannot be recapitulated by the knockdown of Chk1 alone or by overexpression of Bcl2. Rather the combination of Chk1 knockdown and Bcl2 overexpression is required to recapitulate Akt activities. Akt was shown to directly phosphorylate Chk1. However, we found that Chk1 mutants in the Akt phosphorylation sites behave like wild-type Chk1 in mediating G2 arrest, suggesting that the phosphorylation of Chk1 by Akt is either dispensable for Chk1 activity or insufficient by itself to exert an effect on Chk1 activity. Here we report a new mechanism by which Akt affects G2 cell cycle arrest. We show that Akt inhibits BRCA1 function that induces G2 cell cycle arrest. Akt prevents the translocation of BRCA1 to DNA damage foci and, thereby, inhibiting the activation of Chk1 following DNA damage."

NGF binds a specific receptor on the membrane and triggers the ERK1/2 cascade, which stimulates the transcription of neural genes. We report that NGF significantly affects mitochondrial metabolism by reducing mitochondrial-produced reactive oxygen species and stabilizing the electrochemical gradient. This is accomplished by stimulation of mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally via Ki-Ras and ERK1/2. Activation of MnSOD is essential for completion of neuronal differentiation because 1) expression of MnSOD induces the transcription of a neuronal specific promoter and neurite outgrowth, 2) silencing of endogenous MnSOD by small interfering RNA significantly reduces transcription induced by NGF, and 3) a Ki-Ras mutant in the polylysine stretch at the COOH terminus, unable to stimulate MnSOD, fails to induce complete differentiation. Overexpression of MnSOD restores differentiation in cells expressing this mutant. ERK1/2 is also downstream of MnSOD, as a SOD mimetic drug stimulates ERK1/2 with the same kinetics of NGF and silencing of MnSOD reduces NGF-induced late ERK1/2.

To dissect the molecular link(s) between ROS and neural differentiation, we tested the effects of NGF on mitochondrial metabolism by assaying directly the production of mitochondrial ROS and the mitochondrial electrochemical gradient. We also analyzed mitochondrial proteins stimulated by NGF during differentiation. We find that NGF reduces the production of mitochondrial ROS and improves the proton mitochondrial gradient. This is accomplished by stimulation of MnSOD. H2O2, generated by MnSOD, sustains long term ERK1/2 signaling triggered by NGF. NGF stimulates the formation of a complex involving cell membrane, microtubular cytoskeleton, and mitochondria. These data unravel a novel function of NGF and support the notion that the species and the location of ROS determine the shape of the kinase cascade and the ultimate phenotype of the cell.

All plasmid constructs were sequenced to confirm the predicted amino acid sequence. Transient transfections were performed with Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the protocol indicated by the supplier. 48 or 72 h after transfection the cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy or by immunoblot. The amount of DNA of each plasmid vector for a 60-mm dish was: GFP, 5 μg; NGF1A-CAT, 5 μg; RSVLacZ, 3 μg; MnSOD wild type, 4 μg; MnSOD S82A, 4 μg. β-Galactosidase activity was used to normalize the transfection efficiency. For immunofluorescence analysis the cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips 16 h before transfection. The ECFP Ki-Ras4B expression constructs were introduced into PC12 cells and induced for 3 days with NGF 100 ng/ml. Transfection of siRNAs was carried out by microporation (MicroPorator MP-100, DigitalBio). The experimental conditions were optimized for PC12 cells: voltage 1200, width 30, 1 pulse. siRNAs were obtained from Dharmacon (ON-TARGETplus) (LaFayette, CO). We independently transfected four siRNAs and tested MnSOD knockdown by immunoblot. As controls were used “non-targeting” (NT) scrambled siRNAs. In all experiments two siRNAs were used at a final concentration of 100 nm. The specific sequences were 5′-GCGCUGGAGCCGCACAUUA-3′ and 5′-GAGCAAGGUCGCUUACAGA-3′. 68 h after the transfection the cells were serum-deprived for 4 h and induced with EGF or NGF for 15 min and 3 h, respectively. Neurite outgrowth assay was carried out by scoring the number of neurites in cells expressing wild type CMV-GFP. A neurite was identified as a process whose length was 1.5 times the cell body. 200 cells were counted for each plate, and the percentage of cells with neurites was calculated as described (6Damon D.H. D'Amore P.A. Wagner J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1333-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). CAT Activity was assayed as described (15Cassano S. Di Lieto A. Cerillo R. Avvedimento E.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32574-32579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Enzymatic assays were performed with extracts containing equivalent units of β-galactosidase (0.1–0.2 unit/sample) (1 unit is the absorbance at 420 nm of the cell lysate incubated with 1 mg/ml 2 nitrophenyl-d-galactopyranoside transferase at 37 °C 1 h). Experiments showing variations in β-galactosidase activity more than 2-fold were eliminated. Mitochondria were stained with Mitotracker Red CM-H2XRos at 19 nm final concentration (Molecular Probes) for 20 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, cells were washed with medium and incubated at 37 °C for further 20 min. Cell fixation and immunofluorescence staining were performed as previously described (16Marchisio P.C. Cremona O. Savoia P. Pellegrini G. Ortonne J.P. Verrando P. Burgeson R.E. Cancedda R. De Luca M. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 205: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Nuclei were stained with 10 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 (Molecular Probes, CA) in PBS. Coverslips were mounted with Gel/Mount (Biomeda Corp., Foster City, CA). Mouse Anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody (from Sigma) was diluted to 10 μg/ml. Oregon Green 514-conjugated secondary goat anti-mouse antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen). Fluorescence filter sets were: 49 Carl Zeiss (Gottingen, Germany) for excitation and detection of Hoechst 33258, XF114–2 Omega Optical Inc. (Brattleboro,VT) for excitation and detection of ECFP, and XF104–2 (Omega Optical, Inc.) for excitation and detection of Oregon Green 514 and XF102–2 (Omega Optical, Inc.) for excitation and detection of Mitotracker Red. For fluorescence analysis, an Axiovert 200-M-Carl Zeiss microscope equipped with an ApoTome slider was used. Image processing was performed using an AxioCam HRCCD camera and the AxioVision 4.1 software (Carl Zeiss, Gottingen, Germany). The superoxide indicator MitoSOX Red (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) was used at a final concentration of 5 μm, incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, and washed 2 times with PBS. After fixation, the cells were permeabilized with Triton X-100 0.2% in PBS for 3 min, washed in 1× PBS, and treated with DRAQ5 (Biostatus Ltd, Leicester, UK) for 15 min to selectively stain the nuclei. After the final wash, the coverslips were mounted on a microscope slide and examined with a Zeiss 510 Meta confocal laser-scanning microscope. For fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, the cells were induced as described above. Mitochondrial membrane potential was assessed by flow cytometry using tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE, Molecular Probes, Invitrogen), a cell-permeant, cationic, red-orange fluorescent dye selectively sequestered by mitochondria. The cells were serum-deprived for 4 h, induced for 30 min and 3 h with NGF at 100 ng/ml, washed with RPMI, and incubated with 50 nm TMRE for 20 min in the dark at 37 °C. At the end of incubation, the cells were washed and re-suspended in the flow analysis buffer (1× PBS), and kept on ice until the analysis. Lysates were prepared by dissolving the cell pellet in cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors) for 15 min. The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min; the supernatant was collected and analyzed by Western blot with specific antibodies. Crude mitochondrial fraction was prepared as described (17Chen Q. Lin R.Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15247-15257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 18Ginsberg M.D. Feliciello A. Jones J.K. Avvedimento E.V. Gottesman M.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 885-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The cell lysate (1 mg) was subjected to immunoprecipitation at 4 °C overnight with the indicated antibodies; 20 μl of protein A/G-plus agarose were added, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C on a rocker platform for 1 h. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C; the pellet was washed 4 times with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and, after the final wash was re-suspended in 40 μl of 1× electrophoresis sample buffer, heated to 95 °C for 5 min, and resolved on a SDS 12% polyacrylamide gel. Chemiluminescent signals were quantified by densitometry. Total RNA was extracted from serum-starved cells induced with NGF using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the supplier's instructions. 1 μg of total RNA was used to synthesize the first strand cDNA with TaqDNA polymerase (Roche Diagnostics) according to the protocol provided by the supplier. 2 μl of cDNA and 10 pmol of MnSOD and actin primers were added in a final volume of 50 μl of PCR mixture (final concentrations, 1× PCR buffer, 0.2 mm deoxy-NTP, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 1.25 units of Taq DNA polymerase). The reaction was carried out in the Gene Amp PCR System 9600. The experimental conditions were selected for each set of primers in the linear range of the reaction in terms of number of cycles and cDNA concentration. Furthermore, each set of reactions included the negative control without reverse transcriptase and a reference marker (rat β actin or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase). Actin primers were: actin forward (5′-GATCATTGCTCCTCCTGAGC-3′) and actin reverse (5′-AAAGCCATGCCAATCTCATC-3′). Rat MnSOD primers were MnSOD forward (5′-GGCCAAGGGAGATGTTACAA-3′) and MnSOD reverse (5′-ACACATCAATCCCCAGCAGT-3′) (Invitrogen). At the end of the reaction 20 μl of the PCR products were loaded on 1.5% agarose gels, and the bands corresponding to the amplified products were detected and quantified by densitometry. Cells from two 100-mm dishes were collected, washed 3 times with PBS, re-suspended in 200 μl of PBS, disrupted by sonication (2 × 10-s pulses), and centrifuged at 12,500 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were incubated 60 °C for 30 min before the assay to eliminate CuZn-SOD activity. MnSOD activity was determined by the cytochrome c xanthine/xanthine oxidase method using 50 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm KCN to inhibit CuZn-SOD activity (19McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All data are presented as the means ± S.E. of three experiments in triplicate. Statistical significance was determined using the matched pairs test. Student's t test was performed for each pair of data separately. Significance with a p < 0.05 is reported. The regulation of ROS levels during differentiation of PC12 cells has been matter of intensive investigation. There are reports indicating that ROS levels increase (3Suzukawa K. Miura K. Mitsushita J. Resau J. Hirose K. Crystal R. Kamata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13175-13178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 4Ibi M. Katsuyama M. Fan C. Iwata K. Nishinaka T. Yokoyama T. Yabe-Nishimura C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2006; 40: 1785-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) or are substantially reduced after NGF exposure (5Sampath D. Jackson G.R. Werrbach-Perez K. Perez-Polo J.R. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 2476-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To clarify this issue, we measured the mitochondrial ROS levels, the mitochondrial membrane potential, and the activity of MnSOD, a key enzyme buffering mitochondrial superoxide, in PC12 cells exposed to NGF. Mitochondrial ROS levels were determined by measuring the fluorescence of mitosox, the red mitochondrial superoxide indicator. Fig. 1A, upper panel, shows that NGF at 180 min significantly reduces mitochondrial ROS. Lower mitochondrial ROS levels indicate that dissipation of the mitochondrial electrochemical gradient is reduced and the respiration is more efficient in the presence of NGF. To test this notion, we measured the electrochemical mitochondrial gradient by assaying the fluorescence of TMRE, a potentiometric dye, sequestered by mitochondria. Fig. 1A, lower panel, shows that NGF at 180 min significantly stimulates TMRE fluorescence. This indicates that the electrochemical gradient is steeper and the respiration more efficient in the presence of NGF. Because MnSOD is the main mitochondrial enzyme scavenging superoxide, we directly measured the activity of the enzyme in NGF-induced cells. Fig. 1B shows that NGF stimulates MnSOD activity and Ki-Ras amplifies MnSOD stimulation by NGF. Under the same conditions, EGF, Ha-Ras wild type, or Ha-Ras Val-12 do not influence the activity of the enzyme (data not shown). Conversely, constitutively active Ki-Ras stimulates MnSOD in the absence of NGF (Fig. 1B). If MnSOD is an important target of NGF and Ki-Ras-induced differentiation, Ki-Ras should be more efficient in the induction of differentiation of PC12 cell compared with the Ha-Ras isoform, which fails to stimulate MnSOD (Fig. 1B). To this end we tested the specific biological activity of Ha- and Ki-Ras by measuring the neural specific transcription (NGF1A) in cells expressing similar levels of Ki- and Ha-Ras V12 proteins. Fig. 2A shows that Ki-Ras is more efficient that Ha-Ras in stimulating transcription of NGF1A. Ki-Ras is also more efficient than Ha-Ras in stimulating morphological differentiation, measured by neurite outgrowth (Fig. 2B). The higher specific activity of Ki-Ras in the induction of PC12 differentiation may be linked with the selective ability of Ki-Ras to stimulate mitochondrial SOD (Fig. 1). To this end we analyzed the mechanism of NGF and Ki-Ras induction of MnSOD. We stimulated PC12 cells with NGF and determined MnSOD protein and mRNA levels. Fig. 3A shows that the levels of MnSOD mRNA are stimulated by 3 h of NGF treatment. However, MnSOD protein levels display 2 peaks at 30 and 180 min after NGF stimulation (Fig. 3B). The early NGF effect on MnSOD levels appears to be post-transcriptional, whereas the late induction (3 h) is mediated by an increase of mRNA levels (Fig. 3A). To investigate the early induction of the enzyme and to find a link between NGF-induced ERK1/2 and MnSOD, we pretreated the cells with U0126, the specific MEK inhibitor. Fig. 3B shows that NGF induction of SOD at 30 min is inhibited by U0126. To analyze a possible post-translational modification of the enzyme, we measured the phosphorylation of MnSOD by challenging MnSOD immunoprecipitates with anti-phosphoserine antibodies (P-Ser). Fig. 4A shows that 1) MnSOD contains phosphorylated serine(s) after 5 and 30 min of NGF stimulation, and 2) treatment of the cells with the MEK inhibitor (U0126) reduces significantly the serine-phosphorylated band (Fig. 4A).FIGURE 4Post-transcriptional regulation of mitochondrial SOD by NGF. A, NGF induces phosphorylation of MnSOD. Extracts (1 mg) derived from PC12 cells and induced for 5 and 30 min by NGF or pretreated with the MEK inhibitor U0126 (10 μm) were immunoprecipitated with the anti-MnSOD mouse monoclonal antibody. The immunoprecipitate (IP), fractionated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, was challenged with anti-phosphoserine (P-Ser) rabbit polyclonal antibodies or anti-MnSOD rabbit polyclonal antibodies (see “Experimental Procedures”). The histogram shows the densitometric analysis of MnSOD serine-phosphorylated band relative to control protein in untreated cells.

B, shown is the effect of inhibition of protein synthesis on NGF-induced MnSOD. 50 μg of extracts, derived from PC12 cells, were challenged for 5 and 30 min with NGF in the presence or absence of cycloheximide (CHX, 10 μg/ml). The cells were starved from serum for 4 h, and the cycloheximide was added 30 min before NGF treatment. The immunoblot of total cell protein was carried out with antibodies specific to human c-Fos (goat) and MnSOD. A representative experiment is shown in the inset. *, p < 0.01 relative to untreated cells. **, p < 0.01 relative to cells stimulated with NGF for 30 min without cycloheximide. C, mitochondrial SOD activity of wild type or the serine/alanine 82 mutant is shown. Cells (HEK293, PC12, and HeLa) were transiently transfected with control vector, wild type, or alanine (S82A) MnSOD mutant expression vectors. Cell extracts were prepared and assayed for MnSOD activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results were comparable in the three cell lines indicated. The inset shows the levels of MnSOD in HEK293 transfected with the wild type or S82A MnSOD proteins. The histogram shows the enzymatic activity of wild type (WT) and MnSOD mutant HEK293-expressing cells normalized to the transfection efficiency. *, p < 0.01 relative to control cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To dissect the mechanism of NGF induction of MnSOD, we stimulated the cells for 5 and 30 min with NGF in the presence or absence of the translation inhibitor cycloheximide. Note that in this time frame (30 min) the levels of MnSOD mRNA do not change after NGF stimulation. Inhibition of translation does not prevent MnSOD induction by NGF at 5 min, whereas it inhibits MnSOD accumulation at 30 min. NGF also induces c-Fos at 30 min. Induction of c-Fos and MnSOD at 30 min by NGF requires active translation, as cycloheximide inhibits the accumulation of both proteins in cells exposed 30 min to NGF (Fig. 4B). These data suggest that NGF at 5 min alters the stability of the MnSOD protein, whereas at 30 min NGF stimulates the translation of the specific mRNA. To identify the site in the protein phosphorylated by ERK1/2, we mutagenized a serine residue located in position 82 of the rat MnSOD sequence. This serine, adjacent to a proline (Ser-Pro), is a potential ERK1/2 substrate and is present only once in the rodent sequences. The MnSOD protein, mutated in this serine and overexpressed in HEK293 or PC12 cells, does not increase the activity after NGF stimulation (Fig. 4C). Extensive biochemical analysis of the protein indicates that this mutation abolishes phosphorylation of the enzyme in vitro by purified ERK2 (supplemental Fig. 1S) and does not affect the homotetrameric assembly and the activity of the endogenous enzyme (20Castellano I.

https://openalex.org/W2018930442,"A truncated isoform of C/EBPbeta, C/EBPbeta-LIP, is required for liver proliferation. This isoform is expressed at high levels in proliferating liver and in liver tumors. However, high levels of C/EBPbeta-LIP are also observed in non-proliferating livers during acute phase response (APR). In this paper we present mechanisms by which liver regulates activities of C/EBPbeta-LIP. We found that calmodulin (CaM) inhibits the ability of C/EBPbeta-LIP to promote liver proliferation during APR through direct interactions. This activity of CaM is under negative control of Ca(2+), which is reduced in nuclei of livers with APR, whereas it is increased in nuclei of proliferating livers. A mutant CaM, which does not interact with C/EBPbeta-LIP, also fails to inhibit the growth promotion activity of C/EBPbeta-LIP. Down-regulation of CaM in livers of LPS-treated mice causes liver proliferation via activation of C/EBPbeta-LIP. Overexpression of C/EBPbeta-LIP above levels of CaM also initiates liver proliferation in LPS-treated mice. In addition, CaM regulates transcriptional activity of another isoform of C/EBPbeta, C/EBPbeta-LAP, and might control liver biology through the regulation of both isoforms of C/EBPbeta. In searching for molecular mechanisms by which C/EBPbeta-LIP promotes cell proliferation, we found that C/EBPbeta-LIP releases E2F.Rb-dependent repression of cell cycle genes by a disruption of E2F1.Rb complexes and by a direct interaction with E2F-dependent promoters. CaM inhibits these growth promotion activities of C/EBPbeta-LIP and, therefore, supports liver quiescence. Thus, our findings discover a new pathway of the regulation of liver proliferation that involves calcium-CaM signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2102426499,"Besides modulating pain, stress, physiological functions, motivation, and reward, the opioid system has been implicated in developmental and adult mammalian neurogenesis and gliogenesis. In adult male songbirds including zebra finches, neurons generated from the ventricular zone (VZ) of the lateral ventricles are incorporated throughout the telencephalon, including the song control nuclei, HVC, and area X. Although the endogenous opioid met-enkephalin is present in neurons adjacent to the VZ and is upregulated in song control regions during singing, it is not known whether the opioid system can modulate adult neurogenesis/gliogenesis in zebra finches. We used quantitative RT-PCR and in situ hybridization to demonstrate that µ- and δ-opioid receptors are expressed by the VZ of adult male zebra finches. Treating cultured VZ cells from male birds with the opioid antagonist naloxone led to an increase in cell proliferation measured by 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine incorporation, whereas administering met-enkephalin had the opposite effect, compared with saline-treated cultures. Systemically administering naloxone (2.5 mg/kg body wt) to adult male zebra finches for 4 d also led to a significant increase in cell proliferation in the ventral VZ of these birds, compared with saline-treated controls. Our results show that cell proliferation is augmented by naloxone in the VZ adjacent to the anterior commissure, suggesting that the endogenous opioids modulate adult neurogenesis/gliogenesis by inhibiting cell proliferation in songbirds.—Khurshid, N., Hameed, L.

https://openalex.org/W2062895124,"It has been known for more than three decades that outward Kir currents (I(K1)) increase with increasing extracellular K(+) concentration ([K(+)](o)). Although this increase in I(K1) can have significant impacts under pathophysiological cardiac conditions, where [K(+)](o) can be as high as 18 mm and thus predispose the heart to re-entrant ventricular arrhythmias, the underlying mechanism has remained unclear. Here, we show that the steep [K(+)](o) dependence of Kir2.1-mediated outward I(K1) was due to [K(+)](o)-dependent inhibition of outward I(K1) by extracellular Na(+) and Ca(2+). This could be accounted for by Na(+)/Ca(2+) inhibition of I(K1) through screening of local negative surface charges. Consistent with this, extracellular Na(+) and Ca(2+) reduced the outward single-channel current and did not increase open-state noise or decrease the mean open time. In addition, neutralizing negative surface charges with a carboxylate esterifying agent inhibited outward I(K1) in a similar [K(+)](o)-dependent manner as Na(+)/Ca(2+). Site-directed mutagenesis studies identified Asp(114) and Glu(153) as the source of surface charges. Reducing K(+) activation and surface electrostatic effects in an R148Y mutant mimicked the action of extracellular Na(+) and Ca(2+), suggesting that in addition to exerting a surface electrostatic effect, Na(+) and Ca(2+) might inhibit outward I(K1) by inhibiting K(+) activation. This study identified interactions of K(+) with Na(+) and Ca(2+) that are important for the [K(+)](o) dependence of Kir2.1-mediated outward I(K1)."
