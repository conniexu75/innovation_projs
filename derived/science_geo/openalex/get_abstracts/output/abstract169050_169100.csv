https://openalex.org/W1564224574,"H2AX, a member of the histone H2A family, is rapidly phosphorylated in response to ionizing radiation. This phosphorylation, at an evolutionary conserved C-terminal phosphatidylinositol 3-OH-kinase-related kinase (PI3KK) motif, is thought to be critical for recognition and repair of DNA double strand breaks. Here we report that inhibition of DNA replication by hydroxyurea or ultraviolet irradiation also induces phosphorylation and foci formation of H2AX. These phospho-H2AX foci colocalize with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), BRCA1, and 53BP1 at the arrested replication fork in S phase cells. This response is ATR-dependent but does not require ATM or Hus1. Our findings suggest that, in addition to its role in the recognition and repair of double strand breaks, H2AX also participates in the surveillance of DNA replication."

https://openalex.org/W2056220715,The Slit protein guides neuronal and leukocyte migration through the transmembrane receptor Roundabout (Robo). We report here that the intracellular domain of Robo interacts with a novel family of Rho GTPase activating proteins (GAPs). Two of the Slit-Robo GAPs (srGAPs) are expressed in regions responsive to Slit. Slit increased srGAP1-Robo1 interaction and inactivated Cdc42. A dominant negative srGAP1 blocked Slit inactivation of Cdc42 and Slit repulsion of migratory cells from the anterior subventricular zone (SVZa) of the forebrain. A constitutively active Cdc42 blocked the repulsive effect of Slit. These results have demonstrated important roles for GAPs and Cdc42 in neuronal migration. We propose a signal transduction pathway from the extracellular guidance cue to intracellular actin polymerization.
https://openalex.org/W2085917809,"The C/EBPalpha transcription factor is required for differentiation of adipocytes and neutrophil granulocytes, and controls cellular proliferation in vivo. To address the molecular mechanisms of C/EBPalpha action, we have identified C/EBPalpha mutants defective in repression of E2F-dependent transcription and found them to be impaired in their ability to suppress cellular proliferation, and to induce adipocyte differentiation in vitro. Using targeted mutagenesis of the mouse germline, we show that E2F repression-deficient C/EBPalpha alleles failed to support adipocyte and granulocyte differentiation in vivo. These results indicate that E2F repression by C/EBPalpha is critical for its ability to induce terminal differentiation, and thus provide genetic evidence that direct cell cycle control by a mammalian lineage-instructive transcription factor couples cellular growth arrest and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2016135054,"The GroEL/GroES chaperonin system mediates the folding of a range of newly synthesized polypeptides in the bacterial cytosol. Using a rapid biotin-streptavidin-based inhibition of chaperonin function, we show that the cage formed by GroEL and its cofactor GroES can have a dual role in promoting folding. First, enclosure of nonnative protein in the GroEL:GroES complex is essential for folding to proceed unimpaired by aggregation. Second, folding inside the cage can be significantly faster than folding in free solution, independently of ATP-driven cycles of GroES binding and release. This suggests that confinement of unfolded protein in the narrow hydrophilic space of the chaperonin cage smoothes the energy landscape for the folding of some proteins, increasing the flux of folding intermediates toward the native state."
https://openalex.org/W1990247684,"Under starvation conditions, the majority of intracellular degradation occurs at the lysosome or vacuole by the autophagy pathway. The cytoplasmic substrates destined for degradation are packaged inside unique double-membrane transport vesicles called autophagosomes and are targeted to the lysosome/vacuole for subsequent breakdown and recycling. Genetic analyses of yeast autophagy mutants,<i>apg</i> and <i>aut</i>, have begun to identify the molecular machinery as well as indicate a substantial overlap with the biosynthetic cytoplasm to vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway. Transport vesicle formation is a key regulatory step of both pathways. In this study, we characterize the putative compartment from which both autophagosomes and the analogous Cvt vesicles may originate. Microscopy analyses identified a perivacuolar membrane as the resident compartment for both the Apg1-Cvt9 signaling complex, which mediates the switching between autophagic and Cvt transport, and the autophagy/Cvt-specific phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex. Furthermore, the perivacuolar compartment designates the initial site of membrane binding by the Apg/Cvt vesicle component Aut7, the Cvt cargo receptor Cvt19, and the Apg conjugation machinery, which functions in the <i>de novo</i>formation of vesicles. Biochemical isolation of the vesicle component Aut7 and density gradient analyses recapitulate the microscopy findings although also supporting the paradigm that components required for vesicle formation and packaging concentrate at subdomains within the donor membrane compartment."

In the absence of any added factors, osteoclasts exhibited the survival rate of less than 25% after a 24-h incubation. Among the tested factors, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) was found to increase the survival rate to ∼80%. The TNF-α-enhanced survival of osteoclasts appeared to be associated with reduction in apoptosis and suppression of caspase activation. The antiapoptotic signaling pathways involved in the TNF-α-induced osteoclast survival were investigated. TNF-α treatment increased the phosphorylation of Akt in osteoclasts, which was suppressed by a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 and an Src family kinase-selective inhibitor PP1. These inhibitors also attenuated the TNF-α stimulation of osteoclast survival. In addition an increase in the phosphorylation of ERK was observed upon TNF-α stimulation. PD98059, a specific inhibitor of the ERK-activating kinase MEK-1, abolished the TNF-α-induced ERK phosphorylation and osteoclast survival, and in these responses the involvement of Grb2 and ceramide was observed. These results suggest that TNF-α promotes the survival of osteoclasts by engaging the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase Akt and MEK/ERK signaling pathways.

These cells are continuously formed from the monocyte/macrophage lineage of hematopoietic cells to replace dying cells. The formation and activation of osteoclasts are regulated by numerous cytokines, hormones, and growth factors. Recently, a tumor necrosis factor (TNF)1 family molecule, receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL; also called TRANCE, ODF, and OPGL), was found to play essential roles for osteoclast differentiation and activation (1Suda T.

Subsequently, many osteotrophic factors were shown to induce the expression of RANKL on supporting osteoblastic/stromal cells explaining the necessity of cell-to-cell contact between the supporting cells and osteoclast progenitor cells for differentiation of the latter (1Suda T.

Binding of RANKL to its receptor RANK, a TNF receptor (TNFR) family protein present on osteoclast lineage and dendritic cells, induces a strong activation of NF-κB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase through the membrane-proximal adaptor molecules TNFR-associated factors (TRAFs) (3Hsu H.

The crucial roles of RANK and RANKL were clearly shown in knock-out mice that displayed osteopetrosis that results from the lack of osteoclast formation (11Dougall W.C. Glaccum M. Charrier K.

Once terminally differentiated, osteoclasts have a short life span and undergo apoptotic cell death. Survival of osteoclasts appears to be dependent on osteotrophic factors presented by osteoblast/stromal cells, and in the absence of the supporting cells, osteoclasts readily undergo apoptosis (13Fuller K. Owens J.M. Jagger C.J. Wilson A. Moss R. Chambers T.J. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1733-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Some studies have also reported that the survival of osteoclasts is regulated by certain cytokines and hormones. Estrogen and transforming growth factor-β were shown to inhibit osteoclast survival (14Kameda T. Mano H. Yuasa T. Mori Y. Miyazawa K. Shiokawa M. Nakamaru Y. Hiroi E. Hiura K. Kameda A. Yang N.N.

However, current understanding of the molecular mechanism by which these survival factors prevent osteoclast death is limited. Several signaling pathways are known to be involved in the regulation of cell death. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K) produces D3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides that recruit Akt, through binding to the pleckstrin homology domain, to the plasma membrane where an Akt-activating kinase phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1) is also translocated. The binding of D3-phosphorylated inositides to the pleckstrin homology domain is believed to cause conformational changes that allow access of PDK-1, which results in the phosphorylation of Akt on Thr-308 (21Toker A. Newton A.C. Cell. 2000; 103: 185-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The PI 3-K/Akt pathway has been demonstrated to transduce antiapoptotic signals from various stimuli including growth factors, cytokines, matrix-cell interaction, and neuronal cell differentiation (22Chan T.O. Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 965-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK is activated by phosphorylation on Thr and Tyr by a dual specificity kinase MEK, which can be activated by Raf-1. Raf-1 activation can be achieved by the GTP-bound activated form of Ras. The Ras/ERK pathway has also been shown to be an important component for survival of neuronal and hematopoietic cells (23Bonni A. Brunet A. West A.E. Datta S.R. Takasu M.A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1358-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1656) Google Scholar, 24Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E.

Oncogene. 1997; 15: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, the roles played by Akt and MAPK/ERK for osteoclast survival have not been studied in detail. In the course of searching for new factors that regulate osteoclast survival, we found that TNF-α promotes the survival of differentiated mature osteoclasts. We show that the TNF-α stimulation of osteoclast survival is mediated by the Akt and ERK pathways. 1α,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3, prostaglandin E2, C6-ceramide, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), and LY294002 were purchased from Sigma. PD98059 was from Calbiochem. Recombinant human sRANKL was obtained from PeproTech EC (London, UK). TNF-α and interleukin 1-α (IL-1α) were from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Neutralizing antibodies against TNF receptor type I and type II and an isotype-matching hamster IgG were purchased from BD PharMingen (San Diego, CA). A functional peptide (DRQIKIWFQNRRMKWKKTTKPLAP) for interfering Grb2 binding to TNFRI and a mutated peptide (DRQIKIWFQNRRMKWKKTTKKLAP) were synthesized by AnyGen (Gwangju, Korea). Osteoclasts were obtained by the co-culture of mouse bone marrow cells and primary osteoblasts as described (26Suda T. Jimi E. Nakamura I. Takahashi N. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 282: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Briefly, primary osteoblasts were obtained by growing calvarial cells from ICR newborn mice for 3 days in α-minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS; Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Bone marrow cells were obtained by flushing tibiae from 6- to 8-week-old ICR mice. 1 × 107 bone marrow cells and 1 × 106osteoblasts were seeded on a 90-mm dish coated with collagen gel and cultured for 6 days in the presence of 10−8m1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and 10−6m prostaglandin E2. The complete culture medium was changed every 3 days. After 6 days of culture, cells were harvested by treating with 0.2% collagenase (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C for 10 min, replated on a plain 6- or 48-well culture plate, and cultured for another day. The plate was then treated with 0.1% collagenase at 37 °C for 30 min and intensely pipetted to remove osteoblasts. The remaining cells were more than 95% pure osteoclasts when determined by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) cytochemistry as described below. Purified osteoclasts prepared as above were incubated in the presence or absence of TNF-α or other cytokines for 24 h. After washing twice with medium, cells remaining attached were stained for TRAP enzyme with the Leukocyte Acid Phosphatase Assay Kit (Sigma) as per the manufacturer's instructions. TRAP-positive cells with five or more nuclei were counted. Cells at the beginning (t = 0) of cytokine addition were analyzed in the same way, and the survival rate was calculated as the percentage of TRAP-positive multinuclear cells remaining after 24-h treatments. Purified osteoclasts were incubated with or without TNF-α for 9 h. After rinsing once in phosphate-buffered saline, cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde for 5 min at 20 °C and then incubated with 1 μg/ml DAPI in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min. Cells showing fragmented chromatin morphology were considered apoptotic. The purified mature osteoclasts were seeded in 6-well plates and treated with or without TNF-α for 9 h. After brief rinsing in phosphate-buffered saline, cells from three wells of a 6-well plate were lysed in 150 μl of the Cell Lysis Buffer included in the Caspase-9 Colorimetric Assay Kit (R & D Systems). The cell lysates were concentrated with Centricons (molecular weight cut-off 3000; Millipore, Bedford, MA) to achieve protein concentrations of 2–4 mg/ml. The enzymatic reaction for caspase-9 activity was carried out with the p-nitroanilide-conjugated LEHD peptide (LEHD-pNA) substrate as described by the manufacturer. The caspase-3 activity was measured similarly using the DEVD-pNA substrate contained in the Caspase-3 Colorimetric Assay Kit (R & D Systems). Western blotting analyses were performed as described (27Kim H.-H. Tharayil M. Rudd C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 296-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Protein concentrations of cell lysates were determined by using the DC Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad), and 10–20 μg of cellular proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was probed with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-phospho-Akt (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) or anti-phospho-ERK (New England Biolabs). The same membrane was stripped and reprobed with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-Akt (New England Biolabs) or anti-ERK2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Cells were incubated in a hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF) for 10 min on ice and then scraped into a microcentrifuge tube. Nonidet P-40 was added to 0.1%, and the cells were further incubated for 15 min with occasional agitation. After microcentrifugation at 4000 rpm for 15 min, the pellet was lysed in 15 μl of a high salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm DTT) for 20 min on ice. 75 μl of storage buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm DTT) was added, agitated for 10 s by vortexing, and then microcentrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min. Protein concentrations of the supernatants were measured with the DC Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad). The NF-κB binding site oligomer (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was random-labeled with [α-32P]ATP and Klenow enzyme. 10 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated with ∼20,000 cpm of probe in 20 μl of the reaction buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 2 mm DTT, and 1 μg of poly(dI·dC) for 30 min at 20 °C. The DNA-bound NF-κB proteins were separated on 4–5% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. Every quantitative experiment was performed in triplicate, and data were analyzed by Students't test. All experiments were repeated 2–4 times, and results from a representative experiment are shown. To find a new factor involved in osteoclast survival, we incubated mature osteoclasts in the presence of various cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors and assessed the survival rate. The purified mature osteoclasts that were obtained by removing the supporting osteoblasts from co-cultures of mouse bone marrow cells and primary osteoblasts (see “Experimental Procedures”) showed ∼80% death rate in the absence of any added factors within 24 h (Fig. 1,A and B). Addition of human hepatocyte growth factor (80 ng/ml), mouse stem cell factor (20 ng/ml), human keratinocyte growth factor (50 ng/ml), human epidermal growth factor (0.8 ng/ml), human nerve growth factor (3 ng/ml), mIL-6 (0.12 ng/ml) plus hIL-6R (30 ng/ml), mIL-3 (0.2 ng/ml), mIL-11 (0.3 ng/ml), mIL-17 (6 ng/ml), mouse macrophage-derived chemokine (40 ng/ml), mouse stromal cell-derived factor 1 alpha (18 ng/ml), human bone macrophagenic protein 5 (2 μg/ml), or human pleiotrophin (16 μg/ml) did not increase osteoclast survival at concentrations more than 2-fold of ED50 (data not shown). Mouse vascular endothelial growth factor (8 ng/ml) showed a very weak stimulation of the survival (data not shown). In contrast, RANKL and IL-1α significantly increased the number of surviving osteoclasts as reported previously (16Jimi E. Shuto T. Koga T. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 808-811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Jimi E. Akiyama S. Tsurukai T. Okahashi N. Kobayashi K. Udagawa N. Nishihara T. Takahashi N. Suda T. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 434-442PubMed Google Scholar). TNF-α was also found to stimulate osteoclast survival (Fig.1A). In fact, TNF-α could elicit a stronger effect than RANKL or IL-1α (Fig. 1B). The TNF-α-induced osteoclast survival was attenuated by neutralizing antibodies to either TNF receptor type I or type II (Fig. 1C). Mature osteoclasts die by apoptosis (13Fuller K. Owens J.M. Jagger C.J. Wilson A. Moss R. Chambers T.J. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1733-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). As TNF-α increased the survival of purified osteoclasts, we next investigated the effect of TNF-α on apoptosis of these cells. When DAPI staining was performed, apoptotic osteoclasts with condensed chromatin and fragmented nuclei were evident in the absence of a survival factor (Fig.2A). TNF-α greatly reduced the percentage of cells with apoptotic nuclei from 53.4 ± 1.7 to 26.6 ± 2.2% (Fig. 2B). Caspases play an important role in apoptosis. Apoptotic stimuli release cytochrome cfrom mitochondria that together with Apaf-1 activate caspase-9. Active caspase-9 cleaves procaspase-3 into active subunits that cleave a number of substrates to execute cell death (28Wolf B.B. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20049-20052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). When the activity of caspase-9 was measured in purified osteoclasts, an increase (2.35 ± 0.57-fold) was observed in cells incubated in the control medium by 9 h (Fig. 2C). This increase in caspase-9 activity was attenuated to 1.35 ± 0.12-fold by TNF-α (Fig. 2C). An increase (2.02 ± 0.16-fold) in caspase-3 activity was also detected in osteoclasts incubated for 9 h in the absence of TNF-α (Fig. 2D). In the presence of TNF-α, the stimulation of caspase-3 activity was reduced to 1.45 ± 0.05-fold (Fig. 2D). The PI 3-K/Akt signaling pathway has been demonstrated to have an antiapoptotic role in various cell types. To determine whether this pathway is involved in the TNF-α-mediated osteoclast survival, LY294002, known to specifically inhibit PI 3-K, was used. As shown in Fig. 3A, the PI 3-K inhibitor greatly attenuated the effect of TNF-α on survival of mature osteoclasts. We next examined the extent of Akt phosphorylation, which reflects the activation of this PI 3-K downstream target. The treatment of TNF-α increased the phosphorylation of Akt by 15 min, which was reduced to the basal level by 60 min (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, treatment with LY294002 blocked the increase in Akt phosphorylation by TNF-α (Fig. 3C). The neutralizing TNF receptor antibodies that prevented the TNF-α-dependent survival of osteoclasts also inhibited the TNF-α-induction of Akt phosphorylation (data not shown). The Src protein tyrosine kinase or an Src family member was suggested to mediate Akt activation in osteoclasts in response to RANKL (19Wong B.R. Besser D. Kim N. Arron J.R. Vologodskaia M. Hanafusa H. Choi Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1041-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). To examine whether an Src family kinase mediates the Akt activation and osteoclast survival by TNF-α, purified osteoclasts were stimulated with TNF-α in the presence of low concentrations of PP1, an inhibitor for Src family kinases. PP1 significantly suppressed the effect of TNF-α on osteoclast survival at 1.0 μm (Fig.4A). At a higher concentration (10 μm), PP1 showed a more dramatic decrease in the survival (data not shown). However, 24 h of treatment at this concentration appeared to have cytotoxic effects on osteoclasts. The treatment with PP1 also attenuated the activation of Akt by TNF-α in osteoclasts (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that an Src family kinase links the PI 3-K/Akt pathway to the TNF receptors for osteoclast survival. The Ras/ERK signaling pathway has been demonstrated to have antiapoptotic function in certain cell types (23Bonni A. Brunet A. West A.E. Datta S.R. Takasu M.A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1358-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1656) Google Scholar, 25Kinoshita T. Shirouzu M. Kamiya A. Hashimoto K. Yokoyama S. Miyajima A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Whether this pathway plays a role in the TNF-α-mediated osteoclast survival was investigated by using PD98059, which inhibits the ERK upstream kinase MEK1. The use of this inhibitor abolished the effect of TNF-α on survival of purified osteoclasts (Fig.5A). The involvement of ERK was further supported by the observation that TNF-α caused an increase in phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 (Fig. 5B) that was inhibited by treatment with PD98059 (Fig. 5C). TNF-α has been shown to activate c-Raf-1 in a manner requiring both Grb2 and ceramide-activated protein kinase in the embryonic kidney cell line 293 (29Hildt E. Oess S. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1707-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition, the PLAP sequences of TNFRI were mapped as the binding site for Grb2 that links SOS/Ras/Raf1 pathway to the TNF receptor (29Hildt E. Oess S. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1707-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Activated Raf-1 can stimulate MEK-1, which in turn activates ERKs (30Kyriakis J.M. App H. Zhang X.F. Banerjee P. Brautigan D.L. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1992; 358: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether Grb2 and ceramide play roles for the ERK pathway-mediated survival of osteoclasts in response to TNF-α. Purified osteoclasts were incubated with TNF-α in the presence of a cell-permeable peptide (FP) that consisted of membrane-localizing sequences of the third helix of the antennapedia homeodomain protein and the PLAP motif of TNFRI (29Hildt E. Oess S. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1707-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A mutated peptide (MP) containing a lysine substitution for the first proline residue of the PXXP motif was used as a control. FP significantly reduced the TNF-α-induced survival (Fig.6A) and ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 6B). Treatment with cell-permeable C6-ceramide synergistically enhanced the osteoclast survival (Fig. 6C) and ERK phosphorylation (Fig.6D) stimulated by TNF-α. These results suggest that Grb2 binding and ceramide generation are involved in the TNF-α signaling to ERK for survival of osteoclasts. The PI 3-K/Akt pathway has been shown to activate NF-κB in several cell types (31Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar, 32Reddy S.A. Huang J.H. Liao W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29167-29173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), and NF-κB activation can suppress apoptosis (33van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar, 34Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar). Therefore, the antiapoptotic effect of PI 3-K/Akt pathway may involve NF-κB activation. We tested whether the antiapoptotic function of the PI 3-K/Akt pathway in the TNF-α-induced osteoclast survival would involve NF-κB activation. Mature osteoclasts were treated with the PI 3-K inhibitor, LY294002, which blocked TNF-α enhancement of osteoclast survival, and effects on NF-κB activation were assessed by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. TNF-α stimulated the DNA binding activity of NF-κB in mature osteoclasts at 15–60 min (Fig.7A). Treatment of the cells with LY294002 (20 μm) did not affect TNF-α-stimulated NF-κB activation (Fig. 7B, lane 3). Also blocking the ERK pathway with PD98059 (40 μm) did not have any effect on the NF-κB stimulation by TNF-α (Fig.7B, lane 5). Differentiated osteoclasts readily undergo apoptosis in the absence of supporting stromal/osteoblastic cells or ectopic survival factors. A few molecules have been reported to support osteoclast survival. M-CSF was the first one shown to promote the survival of isolated rat osteoclasts by inhibiting apoptosis (13Fuller K. Owens J.M. Jagger C.J. Wilson A. Moss R. Chambers T.J. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1733-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In addition to M-CSF, IL-1 was also found to stimulate mouse osteoclasts in vitro (16Jimi E. Shuto T. Koga T. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 808-811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The recently cloned membrane protein RANKL, which plays an essential role in osteoclast differentiation, has also been demonstrated to increase survival of mouse osteoclasts generated from bone marrow cells either by co-culturing with calvarial osteoblasts (18Jimi E. Akiyama S. Tsurukai T. Okahashi N. Kobayashi K. Udagawa N. Nishihara T. Takahashi N. Suda T. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 434-442PubMed Google Scholar) or by incubating with soluble RANKL plus M-CSF (20Lacey D.L. Tan H.L. Lu J. Kaufman S. Van G. Qiu W. Rattan A. Scully S. Fletcher F. Juan T. Kelley M. Burgess T.L. Boyle W.J. Polverino A.J. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 435-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found rather unexpectedly that TNF-α decreases apoptosis and increases survival of mature mouse osteoclasts (Figs. 1and 2). The TNF-α-stimulated survival of osteoclasts was found to be dependent on the PI 3-K/Akt signaling pathway and Src family kinases (Figs. 3 and 4). The Src family kinase and Akt dependence of TNF-α-stimulated survival is reminiscent of the RANKL-induced osteoclast survival (19Wong B.R. Besser D. Kim N. Arron J.R. Vologodskaia M. Hanafusa H. Choi Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1041-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). RANKL was shown to activate Akt through TRAF6, which appears capable of binding to and activating c-Src (19Wong B.R. Besser D. Kim N. Arron J.R. Vologodskaia M. Hanafusa H. Choi Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1041-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Activated c-Src can then recruit PI 3-K, which generates D3-phosphoinositides for Akt activation. An analogous mechanism may operate in the TNF-α-induced Akt activation in osteoclasts. TNF-α has been shown to activate PI 3-K and Akt in established cell lines and to stimulate c-Src kinase activity in murine bone marrow macrophages (35Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. McHugh K.P. Livolsi A. Peyron J.F. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29417-29423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which the triggering of TNF receptors is linked to c-Src and PI 3-K activation remains elusive, and the involvement of TRAF6 in the TNFR signaling has not been demonstrated to date. One speculation about the mechanism of PI 3-K activation assumes formation of a heterocomplex between TRAF2, which has been shown to be recruited to TNF receptors (36Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1994; 78: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar), and TRAF6. The C-terminal TRAF domain of TRAF family proteins has been demonstrated to be capable of forming homo- and hetero-oligomers (37Arch R.H. Gedrich R.W. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2821-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the PXXP motif in the cytoplasmic domain of TNFRI that has been shown to be the binding site for the SH3 domain of Grb2 (29Hildt E. Oess S. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1707-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) may also interact with the SH3 domain of c-Src. As TNF receptors form a trimer upon ligand binding, the receptor complexes have the potential to contain both Grb2 and Src family proteins at the same time. In various cell types, evidence that TNF-α activates both PI 3-K/Akt and NF-κB, which both have antiapoptotic function, and that the PI 3-K/Akt pathway can activate NF-κB has been reported. Therefore, whether NF-κB is downstream of PI 3-K/Akt in antiapoptotic signal transduction pathways for TNF-α-stimulated osteoclast survival was an intriguing question. Our results suggest that NF-κB is unlikely to mediate the antiapoptotic function of PI 3-K/Akt in the TNF-α-stimulated osteoclast survival (Fig. 7). Similarly, the antiapototic effect of PI 3-K/Akt activated by TNF-α was shown to be independent of NF-κB activation in primary endothelial cell cultures (38Madge L.A. Pober J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15458-15465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). However, we could not exclude the possibility that the PI 3-K/Akt pathway might activate NF-κB through a mechanism independent of nuclear translocation and DNA binding, which could not be tested by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Madrid et al. (39Madrid L.V. Wang C.Y. Guttridge D.C. Schottelius A.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mayo M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1626-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar) reported that overexpression of the activated form of Akt stimulated NF-κB transactivation potential without nuclear translocation of NF-κB in 293T cells. The ultimate way to test NF-κB activation would involve assessment of an NF-κB-responsive promoter activity by using a reporter system, but we were unsuccessful in transfecting a reporter plasmid into mature osteoclasts. The uncoupling of NF-κB activity from osteoclast survival is also supported by a study of Miyazaki et al. (40Miyazaki T. Katagiri H. Kanegae Y. Takayanagi H. Sawada Y. Yamamoto A. Pando M.P. Asano T. Verma I.M. Oda H. Nakamura K. Tanaka S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). In this study, the manipulation of NF-κB activity with constitutively active or dominant-negative IKK using an adenoviral system did not affect the survival of purified mouse osteoclasts (40Miyazaki T. Katagiri H. Kanegae Y. Takayanagi H. Sawada Y. Yamamoto A. Pando M.P. Asano T. Verma I.M. Oda H. Nakamura K. Tanaka S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The antiapoptotic property of ERK has been described in neurons deprived of neuronal growth factors (24Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5019) Google Scholar) and in IL-3-dependent hematopoietic cells after IL-3 withdrawal (25Kinoshita T. Shirouzu M. Kamiya A. Hashimoto K. Yokoyama S. Miyajima A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). A study using an adenoviral system to overexpress dominant-negative and constitutively active forms of Ras and MEK-1 implicated the ERK signaling pathway in osteoclast survival (40Miyazaki T. Katagiri H. Kanegae Y. Takayanagi H. Sawada Y. Yamamoto A. Pando M.P. Asano T. Verma I.M. Oda H. Nakamura K. Tanaka S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). However, whether this pathway mediates the survival induced by an osteoclast survival factor has not been addressed. The present study clearly demonstrates that the ERK pathway operates in the TNF-α-stimulated survival of osteoclasts (Fig. 5). The transduction mechanism for TNF-α signaling to ERK activation appears to involve Grb2 and ceramide (Fig. 6) that have been shown to mediate the TNF-α activation of c-Raf-1 (29Hildt E. Oess S. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1707-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). TNF-α has long been known to stimulate bone resorption (41Bertolini D.R. Nedwin G.E. Bringman T.S. Smith D.D. Mundy G.R. Nature. 1986; 319: 516-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). This cytokine has been implicated in bone loss associated with osteoporosis, orthopedic implant, and periodontitis (42Pacifici R. Brown C. Puscheck E. Friedrich E. Slatopolsky E. Maggio D. McCracken R. Avioli L.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5134-5138Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 43Merkel K.D. Erdmann J.M. McHugh K.P. Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L.

Immunol. 1998; 160: 403-409PubMed Google Scholar). The stimulatory effect of TNF-α on bone resorption could be achieved in part by increasing the formation of multinuclear osteoclasts (45Pfeilschifter J. Chenu C. Bird A. Mundy G.R. Roodman G.D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1989; 4: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The TNF-α induction of osteoclastogenesis has been ascribed to an indirect effect via osteoblasts, perhaps through induction of other osteoclastogenic cytokines (46Thomson B.M. Mundy G.R. Chambers T.J. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 775-779PubMed Google Scholar). However, recent studies (47Kobayashi K. Takahashi N. Jimi E. Udagawa N. Takami M. Kotake S. Nakagawa N. Kinosaki M. Yamaguchi K.

TNF-α also showed a potent synergy with RANKL in osteoclastogenesis and activation of NF-κB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (49Lam J. Takeshita S. Barker J.E. Kanagawa O. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. J.

In this study, we identified another effect of TNF-α on osteoclasts, the stimulation of the survival of differentiated osteoclasts. The combined effects of TNF-α on formation and survival of osteoclasts might be responsible for bone loss in inflammatory bone diseases. We thank Drs. T. Suda, N. Takahashi, and N.

https://openalex.org/W2068837044,"Mechanisms that regulate axon branch stability are largely unknown. Genome-wide analyses of Rho GTPase activating protein (RhoGAP) function in Drosophila using RNA interference identified p190 RhoGAP as essential for axon stability in mushroom body neurons, the olfactory learning and memory center. p190 inactivation leads to axon branch retraction, a phenotype mimicked by activation of GTPase RhoA and its effector kinase Drok and modulated by the level and phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain. Thus, there exists a retraction pathway from RhoA to myosin in maturing neurons, which is normally repressed by p190. Local regulation of p190 could control the structural plasticity of neurons. Indeed, genetic evidence supports negative regulation of p190 by integrin and Src, both implicated in neural plasticity."

Immun. 1999; 67: 6139-6144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a new tridisulfide peptide termed rhesus θ-defensin 1 (RTD-1)1 (25Tang Y.Q. Yuan J. Osapay G. Osapay K. Tran D. Miller C.J. Ouellette A.J. Selsted M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). RTD-1 is a macrocyclic 18-amino acid antimicrobial peptide formed by the ligation of two 9-residue sequences derived from similar 76-amino acid, α-defensin-related precursors, termed RTD1a and RTD1b (25Tang Y.Q. Yuan J. Osapay G. Osapay K. Tran D. Miller C.J. Ouellette A.J. Selsted M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). RTD-1 shares some structural similarities with the pig neutrophil protegrins and the horseshoe crab tachyplesins (25Tang Y.Q. Yuan J. Osapay G. Osapay K. Tran D. Miller C.J. Ouellette A.J.

Symp. 1994; 186: 160-175PubMed Google Scholar). The cyclic structure of RTD-1 is an important determinant for microbicidal potency and resistance to the inhibitory effect of physiologic sodium chloride. The antimicrobial potency of synthetic acyclic RTD-1 was 3-fold lower than that of the native peptide under low salt conditions, and the acyclic peptide was completely inhibited by physiologic NaCl (25Tang Y.Q. Yuan J. Osapay G. Osapay K. Tran D. Miller C.J. Ouellette A.J. Selsted M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Those studies suggested that the cyclic conformation of RTD-1 confers salt-insensitive microbicidal activity that may be critical for antimicrobial function in the extracellular milieu. The isolation of RTD-1 revealed the existence of a novel post-translational pathway for the production of head-to-tail cyclized peptides in primates. Based on the heterodimeric splicing model that produces RTD-1 from RTD1a- and RTD1b-derived nonapeptides (25Tang Y.Q. Yuan J. Osapay G. Osapay K. Tran D. Miller C.J. Ouellette A.J. Selsted M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that two additional θ-defensins, termed RTD-2 and RTD-3, would be produced by the homodimeric splicing of RTD1b and RTD1a, respectively. Here we report the isolation of RTD-2 and RTD-3 from circulating leukocytes, as well as the synthesis and antimicrobial and bacterial binding properties of the three rhesus θ-defensins. Peptide synthesis was performed essentially as described for RTD-1 (25Tang Y.Q. Yuan J. Osapay G. Osapay K. Tran D. Miller C.J. Ouellette A.J. Selsted M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Peptide sequences corresponding to open-chain versions of RTD-2 and -3 (see Fig. 1) were assembled at 0.2 mmol scale on Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)-Arg(2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydro-benzofuran-5-sulfonyl) polyethylene glycol-polystyrene resin using a Milligen 9050 automated synthesizer. Arg, Cys, and Thr side chains were protected with 2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydro-benzofuran-5-sulfonyl, triphenylmethyl, and tert-butyl groups, respectively. All amino acids except cysteine were coupled withO-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,13,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate/N,N-diisopropylethylamine activation. Cysteine residues were coupled as the pre-formed pentafluorophenyl ester derivative. RTD-2 was assembled with double coupling at every cycle. RTD-3 was assembled with double coupling of Thr and Ile residues. Following chain assembly of RTD-2, the peptide resin was cleaved and deprotected by incubation in 20 ml of reagent R (trifluoroacetic acid:thioanisole:1,2-ethanedithiol; 92:5:3; v/v/v (Ref. 28van Abel R. Tang Y. Rao V. Dobbs C. Tran D. Barany G. Selsted M. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1995; 45: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar)) for 4 h at 22 °C with agitation. Cleavage and deprotection of RTD-3 were performed similarly but using reagent K (trifluoroacetic acid:phenol:water:thioanisole:1,2-ethanedithiol; 82.5:5:5:5:2.5; v/w/v/v/v (Ref. 28van Abel R. Tang Y. Rao V. Dobbs C. Tran D. Barany G. Selsted M. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1995; 45: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar)). Crude synthetic products were obtained by filtration and extraction with 30% acetic acid/dichloromethane as described for the synthesis of RTD-1 (25Tang Y.Q. Yuan J. Osapay G. Osapay K. Tran D. Miller C.J. Ouellette A.J. Selsted M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Linear synthetic RTD-2 and -3 were purified by preparative C18 RP-HPLC on a 25 × 100-mm DeltaPak C18cartridge (Waters, MA) developed with a 0.25%/min gradient of water-acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Aliquots from eluant fractions were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF MS), and those containing reduced/linear peptides were pooled and concentrated 10-fold by centrifugal evaporation. The peptide solutions were diluted to 100–200 μg/ml in 17.4 mm ammonium acetate, pH 8.0, and stirred vigorously in an open container for 18 h at 22 °C. Peptide folding and oxidation were monitored by C18 RP-HPLC and MALDI-TOF MS. The acyclic versions of RTD-2 and -3 were then purified by preparative C18 RP-HPLC as described above. Purity was confirmed by analytical C18RP-HPLC and acid-urea PAGE on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels (29Selsted M.E. Setlow J.K. Genetic Engineering: Principles and Methods. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1993: 131-147Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For MALDI-TOF MS, peptide solutions were mixed with an equal volume of 10 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50/50 water-acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and analyzed on a Voyager DE-RP mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems) (25Tang Y.Q. Yuan J. Osapay G. Osapay K. Tran D. Miller C.J. Ouellette A.J. Selsted M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Acyclic RTD-2 (10 mg) and RTD-3 (5 mg) were lyophilized, first from 25 mm hydrochloric acid (three times), then from distilled water (twice). Peptide cyclization was carried out by dissolving the lyophilized peptides at 200–300 μg/ml in 0.1% diisopropylethylamine/dimethyl sulfoxide (v/v) containing 60 molar eq of 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide and 20 eq of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole. The solutions were sealed under nitrogen and stirred for 18 h at 22 °C. The extent of peptide cyclization was determined by C18 RP-HPLC and MALDI-TOF MS. Cyclic peptides were purified to homogeneity by C18 RP-HPLC with water-acetonitrile gradients (0.25%/min) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and characterized by analytical C18RP-HPLC, AU-PAGE, MALDI-TOF MS, and amino acid analysis (25Tang Y.Q.

Rabbit anti-RTD-3 antibody was produced as described previously for the preparation of anti-RTD-1 antibody (25Tang Y.Q. Yuan J. Osapay G. Osapay K. Tran D. Miller C.J. Ouellette A.J. Selsted M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Briefly, acyclic RTD-3 (3.5 mg) was conjugated to ovalbumin (3.5 mg) with 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 7 ml of 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and stirred for 18 h at 22 °C. The reaction was quenched with 300 mm glycine, and the peptide/ovalbumin conjugate was dialyzed exhaustively against water. Two New Zealand White rabbits were repeatedly immunized using standard procedures until the anti-RTD-3 antiserum titer was 1:10,000, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. IgG-enriched preparations were obtained by chromatography on a DEAE Econo-Pac column according to the manufacturer's protocol (Bio-Rad). Five percent acetic acid (HOAc) extracts of 1 × 107 leukocytes were resolved on a 12.5% acid-urea polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted to a 0.22-μm nitrocellulose membrane with an LKB Novablot apparatus (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) using the semidry transfer method (30Wang M.-S.C. Pang J.S. Selsted M.E. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 253: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Replica blots were blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk in TTBS (100 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.9% sodium chloride and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at 22 °C with agitation and incubated with a 1:150 dilution (in TTBS) of rabbit anti-RTD-1 (25Tang Y.Q. Yuan J. Osapay G. Osapay K. Tran D. Miller C.J. Ouellette A.J. Selsted M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar), anti-RTD-3, or normal rabbit IgG for 1 h. Blots were washed with TTBS (five 10-min washes), and developed with the ABC-Elite kit (Vector Laboratories) as follows: 30-min incubation in biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG diluted 1:2,800 in TTBS, 5-min washes (three times), and 30-min incubation in a 1:10 dilution of the avidin-horseradish peroxidase reagent. Immunopositive bands were visualized with Supersignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) on Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Peripheral blood leukocytes (>90% PMN) were obtained from four rhesus monkeys. Approximately 1–1.8 × 108 leukocytes/animal were extracted with 5% HOAc as described previously (24Tang Y.Q. Yuan J. Miller C.J. Selsted M.E. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 6139-6144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Tang Y.Q. Yuan J. Osapay G. Osapay K. Tran D. Miller C.J. Ouellette A.J. Selsted M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Pooled acid extracts of 1–10 × 107 cell eq were fractionated on a 4.6 × 250-mm Vydac C18 column using water-acetonitrile gradients (0–30% acetonitrile in 70 min) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid or 0.1% phosphoric acid (H3PO4). Eluant fractions were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS for peptides with molecular masses of RTD-1–3. Three θ-defensins were purified to homogeneity by successive rounds of RP-HPLC using the same solvent gradient but alternating between 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 0.1% H3PO4 as the ion pairing reagent. Purified RTD-1–3 were characterized by MALDI-TOF MS, amino acid analysis, and AU-PAGE. Cysteine content was determined by comparing the masses of the native peptides with those obtained following reduction of disulfides with 1,4-dithiothreitol and alkylation with iodoacetamide (31Navale V. Kaushal P. Hunt S. Burducea I. Gentz R. Khan F. Vertes A. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 267: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The amino acid compositions of RTD-1–3 were determined on 6n HCl hydrolysates (2 h, 150 °C) as 6-aminoquinolyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbamate derivatives (32Cohen S.A. Michaud D.P. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 211: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). The absence of free N termini in natural RTD-2 and -3 was determined by Edman sequence analysis on 20–50 pmol of each peptide. Natural peptides were compared with synthetic versions by RP-HPLC, AU-PAGE, amino acid analysis, and MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy. The antimicrobial activities of synthetic RTD-1–3 against bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus 502a and Escherichia coli ML35) and fungi (Candida albicans 16820 and Cryptococcus neoformans 271A) were determined in an agar diffusion assay as described previously (33Osapay K. Tran D. Ladokhin A. White S. Henschen A. Selsted M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12017-12022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10-μl wells were bored in a 9-cm2 plate of agarose, buffered with 10 mmPIPES, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm glucose, and seeded with 1 × 106 mid-log phase cells. Five-μl aliquots of each peptide, dissolved in 0.01% HOAc at 10–300 μg/ml, were added to each well. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, the seeded agar was overlaid with molten agarose containing 6% trypticase soy broth (for bacteria) or Sabouraud dextrose broth (for fungi). Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 18–24 h, and antimicrobial activity was determined by measuring the diameter of clearing around each well. The microbicidal activities of each peptide were determined by incubating 2 × 106 colony-forming units/ml with peptides (0.5–12 μg/ml) in 50 μl of low salt diluent, 10 mm PIPES buffer containing 5 mm glucose, pH 7.4, or the same diluent supplemented with 25–150 mm NaCl. After 2 h of incubation at 37 °C, the cell suspensions were diluted 1:50 with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and exponentially spread with an Autoplate 400 (Spiral Biotech) onto trypticase soy agar (bacteria) or Sabouraud dextrose agar (fungi). After incubation at 37 °C for 18–48 h, colonies were counted and cell survival was expressed as colony-forming units/ml. Binding of RTD-1–3 to E. coli ML35 was evaluated by incubating 2 × 106 log-phase bacteria with increasing peptide concentrations (0.5–8 μg/ml final) in 1 ml of 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm glucose for 2 h at 37 °C. The incubation mixtures were centrifuged at 20,000–25,000 × g for 10 min at 22 °C, and supernatant samples were analyzed for RTD content by RP-HPLC. Binding of each RTD to E. coli was determined by subtraction of the quantity of supernatant peptide from total added to each tube, and comparing this to control incubations lacking bacteria. RTD-2 and RTD-3 are cyclic analogs of RTD-1 predicted to be produced by homodimeric splicing of nonapeptides from RTD1b and RTD1a, respectively (Fig. 1). Linear RTD-2 and -3 were synthesized and purified by preparative RP-HPLC. Disulfide bond formation proceeded efficiently in room air, giving >90% yield of monomeric, tridisulfide peptide as determined by quantitative RP-HPLC and MALDI-TOF MS. The yields of the subsequent peptide cyclization steps were 92% for RTD-2 and 64% for RTD-3. The cyclic peptides were purified by C18 RP-HPLC and characterized by AU-PAGE, amino acid analysis, and MALDI-TOF MS. RTD-2 (9.2 mg) and RTD-3 (3.2 mg) preparations were more than 99% pure, and were indistinguishable from the natural peptides (see below). Synthetic RTD-1, -2, and -3 had unique RF values on acid-urea PAGE because of their differing arginine contents (Fig.2). Acid extracts of rhesus macaque leukocytes contained a band that co-migrated with synthetic RTD-1 on AU-PAGE and Western blots. RTD-1 and two additional immunopositive bands that co-migrated with RTD-2 and RTD-3 synthetic standards were detected in leukocyte extracts with anti-RTD-1 and anti-RTD-3 antibodies (Fig. 2). These data strongly suggested the presence of RTD-2 and RTD-3 in leukocyte extracts. RTD-1–3 were isolated from leukocyte extracts by RP-HPLC (Fig.3). Peptides with masses of RTD-1, -2, and -3 were detected in three peaks following the initial chromatographic step (Fig. 3A), and the RP-HPLC elution times precisely matched those of the respective synthetic peptides. Each θ-defensin was purified to homogeneity (Fig. 3B), and their identities were confirmed as described below. Automated Edman degradation of 20–50 pmol of purified RTD-2 and RTD-3 yielded no amino acid signal, consistent with the θ-defensin cyclic structure. The molecular masses of natural RTD-2 and RTD-3, determined by MALDI-TOF MS, matched the calculated values of the predicted sequences (Fig. 1). The cysteine content of purified RTD-1–3 was determined by comparing the molecular masses of native peptides with those that had been reduced and alkylated. Carboxamidomethylated RTD-1, -2, and -3 had molecular masses of 2430.5 atomic mass units (2430.7 = theoretical), 2436.9 atomic mass units (2437.7 = theoretical), and 2424.5 atomic mass units (2423.6 = theoretical), respectively, consistent with the complete alkylation of 6 cysteine residues in each θ-defensin (Table I).Table IAmino acid compositions of rhesus θ-defensinsRTD-1RTD-2RTD-3Amino acid Arg4.84 (5)5.63 (6)3.78 (4) Cys6.00 (6)6.00 (6)6.00 (6) Gly2.03 (2)2.20 (2)2.19 (2) Ile0.96 (1)0 (0)2.19 (2) Leu1.01 (1)2.00 (2)0 (0) Phe1.05 (1)0 (0)2.00 (2) Thr1.00 (1)0 (0)1.94 (2) Val0.98 (1)1.92 (2)0 (0)Molecular mass Cyclized, oxidizedCalculated2082.71-aCalculated based on cyclic structures shown in Fig. 1 (B and C).2089.71-aCalculated based on cyclic structures shown in Fig. 1 (B and C).2075.61-aCalculated based on cyclic structures shown in Fig. 1 (B and C).Experimental2083.01-bDetermined by MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy.2087.91-bDetermined by MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy.2076.01-bDetermined by MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy.

Open table in a new tab The compositions of natural RTD-2 and -3, determined by amino acid analysis of peptide hydrolysates (Table I), were consistent with those of the corresponding structures shown in Fig. 1 (B andC), and that of purified RTD-1, which was as reported previously (25Tang Y.Q. Yuan J. Osapay G. Osapay K. Tran D. Miller C.J. Ouellette A.J. Selsted M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). In a previous study, synthetic RTD-1 was biochemically and functionally equivalent to the natural peptide (25Tang Y.Q. Yuan J. Osapay G. Osapay K. Tran D. Miller C.J. Ouellette A.J. Selsted M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Synthetic RTD-2 and -3 were also indistinguishable from the natural isolates by amino acid analysis, MALDI-TOF MS, AU-PAGE, and analytical RP-HPLC (Fig. 4). The amount of each θ-defensin isolated from acid extracts of rhesus leukocytes was determined by quantitative amino acid analysis. The cellular abundance of θ-defensins in extracts of 5.8 × 108 cell eq was 107 μg (51.4 nmol) of RTD-1, 3.8 μg (1.8 nmol) of RTD-2, and 8.8 μg (4.2 nmol) of RTD-3, giving relative cellular abundances of 29:1:2 (RTD-1:RTD-2:RTD-3). These data indicate that 10-fold more heterodimeric RTD-1 is present in cells than the homodimeric homologs. An agar diffusion assay was utilized to assess the combined microbicidal and microbistatic activities of RTD-1–3 against Staphylococcus aureus 502a,Escherichia coli ML35, and yeast forms of Candida albicans 16820 and Cryptococcus neoformans 271A. The antimicrobial activities of the three θ-defensins were equivalent against S. aureus, C. albicans, and C. neoformans. RTD-2 was 2–3-fold less active than RTD-1 and RTD-3 against E. coli (Fig. 5). The microbicidal potencies of RTD-1, -2, and -3 were determined in liquid-phase assays (see “Experimental Procedures”). The bactericidal and fungicidal activities of the three peptides were similar. However, approximately twice as much peptide was required to kill fungal suspensions as was needed to kill the same number of bacterial cells (Fig. 6). RTD-2-mediated killing of E. coli showed a steep dose dependence similar to that of RTD-1 and -3, but approximately twice as much RTD-2 was required to achieve the microbicidal activities of RTD-1 and -3. However, at concentrations of 2 μg/ml or higher, all three θ-defensins reduced the viability of E. coli ML35 by at least 99.9%.Figure 6Microbicidal activities of RTD-1–3.Each organism was incubated with increasing concentrations of RTD-1 (●), RTD-2 (▪), or RTD-3 (▿) in 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm glucose for 2 h at 37 °C. The limit of detection (1 colony/plate) was equal to 1 × 103colony-forming units/ml in the incubation mixture.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Unlike most α- and β-defensins, the microbicidal activity of RTD-1 is relatively unaffected by physiologic NaCl (25Tang Y.Q. Yuan J. Osapay G. Osapay K. Tran D. Miller C.J. Ouellette A.J. Selsted M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). The microbicidal activities of 10 μg/ml of RTD-2 and RTD-3 were determined usingS. aureus 502a and E. coli ML35 as test organisms in the presence of 0–150 mm NaCl. As with RTD-1, the potent microbicidal activity of RTD-2 and RTD-3 was unaffected by NaCl at all salt concentrations tested (data not shown). The activities of θ-defensins were also compared with those of other potent antibacterial peptides. Microbicidal assays were performed in parallel with indolicidin (a linear, tryptophan-rich, bovine cathelicidin; Refs.34Del Sal G. Storici P. Schneider C. Romeo D. Zanetti M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar and 35Selsted M.E. Novotny M.J. Morris W.L. Tang Y.Q. Smith W. Cullor J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4292-4295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and mouse enteric α-defensins (cryptdins) 3 and 4. On a molar basis, RTD-1–3 were each 2–4 times as potent as indolicidin against S. aureus 502a, and each θ-defensin was equipotent to the cryptdins against S. aureus (data not shown). A (29:1:2) mixture of synthetic RTD-1, -2, and -3 was prepared and used in microbicidal assays against the four test organisms. The peptide mixture exhibited microbicidal potencies that were identical to that of RTD-1 (data not shown), indicating that synergistic microbicidal interactions do not occur under these assay conditions. Experiments were performed to determine whether the difference activities of RTD-1–3 against E. coli ML35 are the result of differential binding of the peptides to the bacterium. As shown in Fig. 7, the binding of the three θ-defensins to E. coli cells was essentially identical. For all three θ-defensins, maximal peptide binding by 2 × 106 bacteria was ∼2 μg. The corresponding peptide concentrations (0–2 μg/ml) are associated with dose-dependent killing of bacterial and fungal targets (Fig. 6). However, despite the equal binding by RTD-1–3 to E. coli cells, the colicidal activity of RTD-2 is substantially lower than that of RTD-1 and -3 (Fig. 6). Thus, other peptide-cell interactions influence the relative microbicidal potencies of the three θ-defensins. Macrocyclic peptides composed entirely of l-amino acids are relatively rare biomolecules, nearly all known examples of which have been isolated from plants. More than 30 macrocyclic peptides, collectively termed cyclotides, have been identified in plants of the Rubiaceae and Violaceae families (36Craik D. Daly N. Bond T. Waine C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1327-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). The mature active peptides typically contain 30 amino acids including 6 cysteines connected in a 1–4, 2–5, 3–6 motif. The structures of two cyclotides (circulin A and cycloviolacin O1), determined by NMR, contain several β-strands constrained by a cysteine knot (36Craik D. Daly N. Bond T. Waine C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1327-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 37Daly N. Koltay A. Gustafson K. Boyd M. Casas-Finet J. Craik D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 333-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Peptide folding kinetics of acyclic permutants indicated that the intact cysteine knot is critical for native conformation. Biosynthesis of plant cyclotides involves the post-translational ligation and splicing of the polypeptide precursors (38Jennings C. West J. Waine C. Craik D. Anderson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

RTD-1 was the first macrocyclic antimicrobial peptide discovered in animals, disclosing the capacity of animal cells to produce this circular motif (25Tang Y.Q. Yuan J. Osapay G. Osapay K. Tran D. Miller C.J. Ouellette A.J. Selsted M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). The fact that RTD-1 is produced by the heterodimeric ligation of two nonidentical nonapeptides encoded by distinct genes suggested that homodimers might be formed similarly. The isolation of RTD-2 and RTD-3 confirmed this hypothesis. Moreover, the biosynthesis of three unique θ-defensins suggests that the cellular machinery responsible for peptide cyclization may be involved in post-translational modification of other gene products (25Tang Y.Q. Yuan J. Osapay G. Osapay K. Tran D. Miller C.J. Ouellette A.J. Selsted M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). The cyclic structures of RTD-1–3 endow the peptides with resistance to exoproteinases, and this may be advantageous in a protease-rich inflammatory milieu. Furthermore, peptide cyclization confers other properties to RTD-1 (25Tang Y.Q. Yuan J. Osapay G. Osapay K. Tran D. Miller C.J. Ouellette A.J. Selsted M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar) that are absent in an acyclic analog, because acyclic RTD-1 is substantially less active than the native peptide against S. aureus and E. coli (25Tang Y.Q. Yuan J. Osapay G. Osapay K. Tran D. Miller C.J. Ouellette A.J. Selsted M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). RTD-1–3, but not the respective acyclic analogs, maintain their staphylocidal and colicidal activities in the presence of physiologic sodium chloride (Ref. 25Tang Y.Q. Yuan J. Osapay G. Osapay K. Tran D. Miller C.J. Ouellette A.J. Selsted M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar and data not shown). The relative yields of RTD-1, -2, and -3 obtained from leukocyte extracts indicated that RTD-1 is 10-fold more abundant than RTD-2 and -3 combined. This suggests a strong preference for production of RTD-1 by heterodimeric splicing of the RTD-1 precursors, RTD1a and RTD1b. We speculate that distinct elements in the two precursors may direct the assembly of heterodimeric intermediates prior to peptide splicing (25Tang Y.Q. Yuan J. Osapay G. Osapay K. Tran D. Miller C.J. Ouellette A.J. Selsted M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Despite differences in cationicity, RTD-1 (+5), RTD-2 (+6), and RTD-3 (+4) possess similar antimicrobial potencies against four organisms tested in this study, and were nearly identical against S. aureus, C. albicans, and C. neoformans. The most cationic peptide, RTD-2, was slightly less active against E. coli than RTD-1 and RTD-3. This was somewhat surprising because increased cationicity typically correlates with greater antimicrobial activities and increased spectrum of activity (42Matsuzaki K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar, 43Hwang P. Vogel H. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 235-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). However, the activity of RTD-2 against E. coli was nearly equivalent to those of RTD-1 and RTD-3 when longer incubation times (4 or 6 h) were used in the agar diffusion assay (data not shown). This suggests that the kinetics of peptide-bacteria interactions differs among the three θ-defensins under these assay conditions. The binding of peptide to E. coli ML35 was equivalent for all three θ-defensins (Fig. 7), indicating that difference in bactericidal activities of RTD-1–3 (Figs. 5 and 6) is the result of subsequent interactions of peptides with bacterial cells. We speculate that the increased electrostatic interaction of the more cationic RTD-2 with components of the E. coli cell envelope adversely affects the antibacterial activity. An alternative explanation is that quaternary interactions occur once the peptide is bound to the target cell, and that those interactions are less favored in the case of the highly cationic RTD-2. The studies presented here demonstrate that RTD-1–3 are broad spectrum microbicides that kill bacterial and fungal targets in a salt-insensitive manner. Under the conditions of the in vitro assay system, synergistic antimicrobial activity was not apparent. However, it is possible that the activities of θ-defensins, individually or in combination, may be substantially altered by the microenvironment in which they function in vivo."

We have now further investigated the mechanism by which Myc mediates transcriptional activation of the cad gene. Using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we found high levels of RNA polymerase II bound to the cad promoter in quiescent NIH 3T3 cells and in differentiated U937 cells, even though the promoter is inactive. However, chromatin immunoprecipitation with an antibody that recognizes the hyperphosphorylated form of the RNA polymerase II carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) revealed that phosphorylation of the CTD does correlate with c-Myc binding and cad transcription. We have also found that the c-Myc transactivation domain interacts with cdk9 and cyclin T1, components of the CTD kinase P-TEFb. Furthermore, activator bypass experiments have shown that direct recruitment of cyclin T1 to the cad promoter can substitute for c-Myc to activate the promoter.

Deregulated expression of c-Myc occurs in many cancers, including lymphomas, breast, colon, and liver cancer. c-Myc is overexpressed in neoplasia by a number of different mechanisms, including gene amplification, translocation, retroviral insertion, and activation of pathways upstream of c-Myc expression (for review, see Ref. 1Henriksson M. Luscher B. Adv. Cancer Res. 1996; 68: 109-182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A number of studies have established the importance of c-Myc in neoplastic transformation. For example, it has long been known that co-transfection of c-Myc and Ras in rat embryo fibroblasts causes transformation in these cells (2Stone J. deLange T. Ramsay G. Jakobovits F. Bishop J.M. Varmus H. Lee W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1697-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Additionally, targeted overexpression of c-Myc to various tissues of transgenic mice can cause increased tumor incidence (3Sinn E. Muller W. Pattengale P. Tepler I. Wallace R. Leder P.

Oncogene. 1989; 4: 715-724PubMed Google Scholar). c-Myc is a member of the helix-loop-helix leucine zipper family of transcription factors. Helix-loop-helix leucine zipper proteins bind to a DNA motif called an E box, which consists of the core consensus sequence CACGTG (7Blackwell T.K. Kretzner L. Blackwood E.M. Eisenman R.N. Weintraub H. Science. 1990; 250: 1149-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Efficient binding of c-Myc to an E box can only occur when c-Myc forms heterodimers with the protein Max, another helix-loop-helix leucine zipper protein (8Blackwood E.M. Eisenman R.N. Science. 1991; 251: 1211-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar). When Myc/Max heterodimers bind to DNA, c-Myc can activate transcription through a transcriptional activation domain (TAD)1 in the amino-terminal region of the protein (9Kato G.J. Barrett J. Villa-Garcia M. Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5914-5920Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). c-Myc function is antagonized by the Mad proteins, which can also dimerize with Max and bind to E boxes (10Ayer D.E. Kretzner L. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1993; 72: 211-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Mad proteins repress transcription through their ability to recruit the mSin3 corepressor complex (11Ayer D.E. Lawrence Q.A. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1995; 80: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Although c-Myc is highly expressed in proliferating cells, Mad proteins are found mainly in quiescent and differentiated cells. Thus, the relative abundance of c-Myc and Mad proteins in a cell is thought to dictate gene expression. Recent advances in microarray technology has allowed genome-wide studies of mRNA transcripts responsive to transcription factors, and a number of such experiments have been done to examine which genes are responsive to c-Myc (12Coller H.A.

Additionally, genes involved in general responses such as glycolysis and protein synthesis appear to be influenced by c-Myc (19Osthus R.C. Shim H. Kim S. Li Q. Reddy R. Mukherjee M. Xu Y. Wonsey D.

A. 2000; 97: 11198-11202Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, mRNA studies do not conclusively establish the identity of a c-Myc target promoter. It is likely that many mRNAs that respond to c-Myc are indirectly affected by Myc-mediated changes in signaling pathways. To establish a promoter as a c-Myc target, it is necessary to show that binding of c-Myc causes changes in promoter activity. However, a difficulty in studying c-Myc target genes is that overexpression of c-Myc in cells results in only modest increases in promoter activity, typically around 2–5-fold. This may be due to several factors, including the presence of highly abundant proteins, such as USF, which also bind to target gene E boxes and may interfere with c-Myc binding, or a requirement for a coactivator which is at limiting concentrations in the cell. We have previously shown that the cad promoter meets all the criteria of a true c-Myc target. The cad gene encodes the trifunctional enzyme carbamoyl-phosphate synthase/aspartate transcarbamoylase/dihydroorotase, which is required for the first three rate-limiting steps of pyrimidine biosynthesis. Expression ofcad is high in proliferating cells and low in quiescent and differentiated cells, which closely correlates with c-Myc expression. The cad promoter contains a conserved E box downstream of the transcription start site which we have shown to be essential for growth regulation (21Miltenberger R.J. Sukow K. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2527-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Importantly, we have used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies to show that c-Myc binds to thecad promoter during peak levels of transcription and is not bound when cad is not expressed (22Boyd K.E. Wells J. Gutman J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13887-13892Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Finally,cad is one of the few proposed c-Myc target genes whose expression is decreased in c-Myc null cells (23Bush A. Mateyka M. Dugan K. Obaya A. Adachi S. Sedivy J. Cole M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3797-3802Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Transcription of protein-coding genes by RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) is believed to involve three main events (24Lee T.I. Young R.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 77-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). First, chromatin modification and remodeling of the promoter occurs to facilitate transcription factor binding. Then, general transcription factors bind to the promoter to recruit RNAP II to the promoter to form the preinitiation complex. Finally, RNAP II clears the promoter and begins elongation of mRNA. Stimulation of elongation appears to require phosphorylation of the RNAP II large subunit carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD), which contains multiple tandem repeats of the amino acid sequence YSPTSPS. A number of kinases have the ability to phosphorylate the RNAP II CTD, including the cyclin-cdk complexes cyclin H-cdk7, cyclin C-cdk8, and cyclin T-cdk9. Cyclin H and cdk7 are part of the general transcription factor TFIIH, which has been shown to be important in stimulating elongation (25Dvir A. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9006-9010Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Cyclin C and cdk8 are part of the mediator complex, and while their role in transcriptional elongation has not been fully elucidated, they have been shown to co-purify with RNAP II (26Cho H. Orphanides G., X., S. Yang X.J. Ogryzko V. Lees E. Nakatani Y. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5355-5363Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Cdk9 and the cyclin T proteins, which consist of cyclin T1 and cyclins T2a and T2b, are part of a complex known as P-TEFb (for positive transcriptionelongation factor b), which has been shown to be important for HIV transcriptional elongation through its association with Tat (27Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2629-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Current models for c-Myc function suggest that transcriptional control of c-Myc target genes may occur through chromatin modification. c-Myc has recently been shown to interact with the protein TRRAP, which associates with the SAGA complex that contains Gcn5, a protein that has histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity (28McMahon S.B. Wood M.A. Cole M.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In contrast, Mad proteins interact with histone deacetylases through association with the mSin3 corepressor complex (29Sommer A. Hilfenhaus S. Menkel A. Kremmer E. Seiser C. Loidl P. Luscher B. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 357-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These observations have led to a model in which c-Myc target genes are repressed by Mad due to deacetylation of histones. Replacement of Mad/Max by Myc/Max is then proposed to result in recruitment of HAT activity and acetylation of histones, subsequently allowing RNAP II to bind and initiate transcription. In support of this model, recent studies have shown that at some c-Myc target promoters, such as nucleolin, changes in histone acetylation do correlate with binding of c-Myc (30Frank S.R. Schroeder M. Fernandez P. Taubert S. Amati B. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2069-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Also, a detailed analysis of the cyclin D2 promoter using chromatin immunoprecipitation indicates that c-Myc and TRRAP bind to thecyclin D2 promoter when the gene is transcribed whereas Mad and histone deacetylases 1 bind to the promoter when the gene is turned off (31Bouchard C. Dittrich O. Kiermaier A. Dohmann K. Menkel A. Eilers M. Luscher B. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2042-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Finally, a study of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (tert) promoter has also shown that histone acetylation correlates with transcription and c-Myc binding (32Xu D. Popov N. Hou M. Wang Q. Bjorkholm M. Gruber A. Menkel A.R. Henriksson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3826-3831Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Although Myc clearly regulates the expression of some, and perhaps most, target promoters by recruiting TRRAP and causing an increase in acetylated histones, we have not seen large changes in the levels of histone acetylation at the cad promoter (33Eberhardy S.E. D'Cunha C.A. Farnham P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33798-33805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In fact, expression studies using c-Myc constructs containing or lacking the TRRAP-binding domain indicate that c-Myc-mediated activation of thecad promoter does not require recruitment of TRRAP and the associated histone acetyltransferases. 2M. A. Nikiforov, S. Chandriani, J. Park, I. Kotenko, D. Matheos, A. Johnsson, S. B. McMahon, and M. D. Cole, submitted for publication. 2M. A. Nikiforov, S. Chandriani, J. Park, I. Kotenko, D. Matheos, A. Johnsson, S. B. McMahon, and M. D. Cole, submitted for publication. These findings, in combination with our previous studies showing that thecad promoter contains high levels of acetylated histones at all times, have led us to investigate other possible mechanisms through which c-Myc may activate transcription. Using the ChIP assay, we have now examined RNAP II binding at the cad gene. We have found that RNAP II is bound to the cad promoter at all times but levels of the hyperphosphorylated form of RNAP II change in correlation with c-Myc binding. We also demonstrate an interaction between the c-Myc TAD and P-TEFb, and activator bypass experiments show that cyclin T1 can substitute for c-Myc to activate the cad promoter. These results suggest that c-Myc functions to stimulate cad transcription by recruitment of the P-TEFb complex. NIH 3T3 cell cultures were maintained and synchronized as previously described (35Boyd K.E. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2529-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar).

Before the first wash, 20% of the supernatant from the no antibody IP for each condition was saved as total input chromatin and was processed with the eluted IPs beginning with the cross-linking reversal step. After the final ethanol precipitation, each IP sample was resuspended in 30 μl of PCR-grade TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). Total input chromatin samples were resuspended in 30 μl of TE and further diluted 1/100 (total dilution 1/500). PCR reactions contained 2 μl of IP sample or 2 μl of diluted total input (0.2% total input chromatin), 1.2 mmMgCl2, 50 ng of each primer, 200 μm each dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP, 4 μl of 5 m betaine (Sigma), 1 × Thermophilic buffer (Promega), and 1.25 units ofTaq DNA polymerase (Promega) in 20 μl total volume. After 34–36 cycles of amplification, 8 μl of the PCR products was electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel, and DNA was stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under UV light. Alternatively, reactions were performed by incorporating ∼2 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP into the reactions and amplifying for 25 cycles. These products were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel and visualized with a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Signals were quantitated using ImageQuant for Macintosh v2.1 (Molecular Dynamics). Fold changes in factor binding were calculated by first dividing the IP signal intensity by the 0.2% input signal intensity (to control for varying levels of chromatin in each sample) for both the G1/S (or log) sample and the G0 (or differentiated) sample. Then, the G1/S ratio was divided by the G0 ratio. The sequences of primers used for PCR analysis can be found at our website (mcardle.oncology.wisc.edu/farnham). HeLa cell nuclear extract was prepared from frozen cells as described previously (42Means A.L. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and was dialyzed against affinity chromatography buffer (ACB) (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 20% glycerol) containing 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.1 m NaCl. GST fusion proteins were prepared and immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Bioscience, Inc.), incubated with HeLa nuclear extract and columns were washed and proteins eluted as described previously (43Fry C.J.

Eluates were analyzed by Western blot analysis with anti-cdk7 sc-529 (Santa Cruz), anti-cyclin H sc-855 (Santa Cruz), anti-cdk8 sc-1521 (Santa Cruz), anti-cyclin C sc-1061 (Santa Cruz), anti-cdk9 sc-7331 (Santa Cruz), and anti-cyclin T1 sc-8128 (Santa Cruz) antibodies. Each binding experiment was repeated at least three times. We had previously shown that there are high levels of acetylated histones on the cad promoter in both quiescent and differentiated cells (33Eberhardy S.E. D'Cunha C.A. Farnham P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33798-33805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) suggesting that the chromatin encompassing the cad promoter is in an open configuration prior to c-Myc binding. If so, components of the transcription machinery may have access to the cad promoter regardless of promoter activity. We therefore wished to examine the levels of RNAP II on the cad promoter in states of both high and low transcriptional activity. To do this we used both NIH 3T3 and U937 cells, so that we could monitor protein binding to cad under conditions where transcription can be regulated (Fig.1). NIH 3T3 cells can be synchronized by serum withdrawal into quiescence, resulting in low levels ofcad transcription, Addition of serum causes re-entry into the cell cycle, and cad transcription is maximal at S phase (Fig. 1 B). U937 cells are a lymphoma-derived cell line that can be induced to differentiate after incubation with all-trans- retinoic acid. In growing U937 cells,cad expression is high, while differentiated cells show almost no cad mRNA (Fig. 1 B). To monitor RNAP II binding to the cad promoter, we used an antibody that recognizes the amino terminus of the large subunit of RNAP II. As a positive control, we also examined binding of c-Myc to the cad promoter. Immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by PCR using both ethidium bromide staining of 34 cycle PCR and [α-32P]dCTP incorporation of 25 cycle PCR. Both methods showed similar changes in protein binding (Figs.2 and 3), so we have used ethidium bromide staining of 34 cycle PCR for the remainder of this study. As expected, we saw differences in the amount of c-Myc on the promoter which correlated with transcriptional activity. However, we found that levels of RNAP II did not correlate with transcriptional activity. Although c-Myc binding on thecad promoter increased 9.2-fold in NIH 3T3 cells from quiescence to S phase, RNAP II binding was unchanged (Fig.2 A). We also examined RNAP II binding on intron 1 of thenucleolin gene, which contains five E boxes which regulatenucleolin expression, and shows large changes in histone acetylation correlating with c-Myc binding (30Frank S.R. Schroeder M. Fernandez P. Taubert S. Amati B. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2069-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). In contrast to thecad promoter which showed no difference in RNAP II binding, this region of the nucleolin gene shows a 5.2-fold change in RNAP II binding. Using the second model system, we saw a 20-fold difference in c-Myc binding on the cad promoter between growing and differentiated U937 cells, but RNAP II binding was unchanged in these cells (Fig. 2 B). We also examined another cell cycle-regulated promoter, b-myb, for RNAP II binding in U937 cells. In contrast to the cad promoter, we saw an 8.8-fold difference in RNAP II binding to the b-myb promoter between growing and differentiated cells (Fig. 2 B). The results obtained by monitoring the nucleolin gene and the b-myb promoter indicate that our assay is capable of detecting changes in RNAP II binding. Therefore, we conclude that RNAP II is bound to the cad promoter in quiescent NIH3T3 cells and differentiated U937 cells when cad transcription is low.Figure 3Increased RNA polymerase II is seen at the 3′ end of the cad gene when transcription is activated. A, NIH 3T3 cells synchronized at G0 and S phase were cross-linked and chromatin was immunoprecipitated with a RNAP II antibody. Immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by PCR amplification with primers specific for the 3′ end of the cad gene. On the left is a PCR reaction done for 34 cycles and stained with ethidium bromide and on theright is the same PCR done for 25 cycles with [α-32P]dCTP incorporation. PCR signals were quantitated as detailed under “Materials and Methods”. B, asynchronously growing U937 cells and U937 cells differentiated for 5 days with 1 μm all-trans- retinoic acid were cross-linked and chromatin was immunoprecipitated with a RNAP II antibody. Immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by PCR as inA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although we see high levels of RNAP II on the cad promoter at all times, one would expect to see changes in the amount of RNAP II on the coding regions of the cad gene correlating with changes in transcription. To test this hypothesis, DNA isolated from ChIP experiments was PCR amplified with primers to the 3′ end of thecad gene. We found that RNAP II binding changes about 3–5-fold on the 3′ end of cad in NIH 3T3 cells between G0 and S phase or as growing U937 cells are differentiated (Fig. 3, A and B). We have repeated the ChIP assay several times and have obtained similar results. These results suggest that c-Myc may indeed activate transcription of cad by stimulating the transition between the initiation complex and the elongation complex, thus resulting in an increase in full-length transcripts. Our results clearly indicate that RNAP II is bound to thecad promoter in the absence of c-Myc. These results raise the question as to how RNAP II is recruited to the cad promoter. The cad promoter does not have a TATA box so recruitment of RNAP II by TFIID might not be the mechanism by which RNAP II is brought to the promoter. We have previously shown that USF is boun"

We have examined yeast mitochondrial aconitase, an 82 kDa monomeric Fe(4)S(4) cluster-containing enzyme, observed to aggregate in chaperonin-deficient mitochondria. We observed that aconitase folding both in vivo and in vitro requires both GroEL and GroES, and proceeds via multiple rounds of binding and release. Unlike the folding of smaller substrates, however, this mechanism does not involve cis encapsulation but, rather, requires GroES binding to the trans ring to release nonnative substrate, which likely folds in solution. Following the phase of ATP/GroES-dependent refolding, GroEL stably bound apoaconitase, releasing active holoenzyme upon Fe(4)S(4) cofactor formation, independent of ATP and GroES."

Northern blot analysis confirmed thatFIT1, FIT2, and FIT3 mRNA transcript levels were increased 60–230-fold in response to iron deprivation in an Aft1p-dependent manner. Fit1p was localized exclusively to the cell wall by indirect immunofluorescence. Deletion of the FIT genes, individually or in combination, resulted in diminished uptake of iron bound to the siderophores ferrioxamine B and ferrichrome, without diminishing the uptake of ferric iron salts, or the siderophores triacetylfusarinine C and enterobactin. FIT-deletion strains exhibited increased expression of Aft1p target genes as measured by a FET3-lacZreporter gene or by Arn1p Western blotting, indicating that cells respond to the absence of FIT genes by up-regulating systems of iron uptake. Aft1p activation in FIT-deleted strains occurred when either ferrichrome or ferric salts were used as sources of iron during growth, suggesting that the FITgenes enhance uptake of iron from both sources. Enzymatic digestion of the cell wall resulted in the release of significant amounts of iron from cells, and the relative quantity of iron released was reduced inFIT-deletion strains.

Iron is abundant in the environment, but it is largely present as insoluble oxyhydroxides. Consequently, the bioavailability of iron is exceedingly low. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae responds to iron deprivation by increasing the expression levels of genes involved in iron uptake.

Iron salts and low affinity iron chelates (such as ferric citrate) are substrates for the reductive system of uptake and siderophore-iron complexes are substrates for both systems. Siderophores are low molecular weight compounds that can solubilize oxyhydroxides of iron by specifically binding ferric iron with very high affinity. These compounds are synthesized and secreted in the iron-free form by microorganisms, and then the ferric forms are taken up by specific transport systems.S. cerevisiae does not synthesize siderophores, but can take up iron bound to different types of siderophores secreted by other species (21Neilands J.B.

Marcel Dekker, New York1994: 39-98Google Scholar). For iron-containing compounds to gain access to plasma membrane-based uptake systems, the compounds must first penetrate the cell wall and cross the periplasmic space. The yeast cell wall is composed of β-glucans, mannoproteins, and chitin (23Cabib E. Drgon T. Drgonova J. Ford R.A. Kollar R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 24Goldman R.C. Branstrom A. Curr. Pharm. Des. 1999; 5: 473-501PubMed Google Scholar, 25Orlean P. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R.

It functions in morphogenesis (growth in yeast forms versus filamentous forms), adherence (to solid supports), flocculation (adherence to other yeast), and mating. In the absence of the cell wall, spheroplasts rapidly burst as a result of osmotic pressure. The cell wall is a highly dynamic structure and undergoes remodeling during growth, bud emergence, and conjugation. Passage of higher molecular weight molecules is restricted by the cell wall. The porosity of the cell wall changes during different phases of growth, with the highest porosity occurring in exponentially growing cells. The composition of the cell wall mannoproteins changes when cells are grown under anaerobic conditions, reduced temperatures, or in unshaken cultures. One class of cell wall mannoprotein is covalently attached to β-1,6-glucan through a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)1 anchor. Analysis of the open reading frames in the S. cerevisiae genome has identified numerous putative cell wall proteins, the functions of which remain unknown (26Hamada K. Fukuchi S. Arisawa M. Baba M. Kitada K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 27Hamada K. Terashima H. Arisawa M. Yabuki N. Kitada K. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3886-3889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have used cDNA microarrays representing the open reading frames of the S. cerevisiae genome to identify genes that are transcriptionally activated during iron deprivation and are targets of Aft1p (20Yun C.W.

Here we report that three proteins that are transcriptionally regulated by Aft1p are components of the yeast cell wall and function to facilitate the uptake of iron. These genes, designated FIT1, FIT2, and FIT3 (forfacilitator of iron transport), are also transcriptionally activated in a strain deleted forYFH1, the yeast frataxin homologue (28Foury F. Talibi D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7762-7768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Strains deleted forYFH1 exhibit mitochondrial iron accumulation and activation of other Aft1p targets. The FIT genes have been suggested to play a role in the uptake or utilization of siderophore-iron. We report that deletion of the FIT genes resulted in defects in siderophore-iron uptake, despite increased levels of expression of systems of iron uptake. Growth of FIT-deletion strains in media containing either iron salts or iron-siderophore complexes resulted in activation of Aft1p, and the amount of iron associated with the cell wall and periplasmic space was reduced inFIT-deletion strains. Strains were constructed in YPH499 (MATa ura3–52 lys2–801(amber) ade2–101(ochre) trp1–63 his3–200 leu2–1) (Yeast Genetic Stock Center, Berkeley, CA). PCR-mediated gene disruption was used to generate deletions of the FIT genes (29Schneider B.L. Steiner B. Seufert W. Futcher A.B. Yeast. 1996; 12: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thefit1Δfit2Δfit3Δ strain was constructed by serial deletion of the FIT genes in the following manner.FIT3 was directly deleted in YPH499 by amplifying theHISG-URA3-HISG cassette from the plasmid pMPY-ZAP using the following primers: 5′-CTAAAATGAAATTCTCTTCCGCTTTGGTTCTATCTGCTGTTGCCGCTACCTCACTATAGGGCGAATTGG-3′ and 5′-GATTATTCACATATCATTTACAATAACATGACGGCAGCAAGGGCAGCACCCTAAAGGGAACAAAAGCTGG-3′. The resulting PCR product was used to transform YPH499, and transformants were screened by PCR. Clones containing the correctly targeted deletion cassette were plated on 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA)-containing plates and 5-FOA-resistant clones selected. For deletion of FIT2, the fit3Δ strain was transformed with a PCR product amplified from genomic DNA isolated from the strain RG1679 (MATa ura3 met-15 his3–1 leu2–1 yor382cD::KANR) (Research Genetics) using the following primers 5′-CGAATCTAACTGGGTGCAG-3′ and 5′-CTGCTACATTGAAGTCACTGAG-3′. Geneticin-resistant clones were selected on YPD plates containing 80 mg/liter G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and the transformants screened by PCR to isolate thefit2Δfit3Δ strain. For FIT1, the following primers were used to amplify the HISG-URA3-HISG cassette: 5′-ATTGTCTTCCGCTTTTGTATTATCTGCTATCACCGTTGCCGCTTTAGGCGAGGGAACAAA-3′ and 5′-AGACCCGTACCAGCGGCGATAGAATCAGCCGCACCCGTGTAATTCACGATTTCTATAGGG-3′.FIT1 was first deleted by transforming BY4741 (MATa ura3 met-15 his3–1 leu2–1) (Research Genetics) with the HISG-URA3-HISG cassette, and the resulting transformants were screened by PCR. Genomic DNA from the resulting fit1Δ strain was used to amplify the locus containing the deletion cassette using the following primers: 5′-GCGCTGTCGCACATTTGGC-3′ and 5′-GGTTGATTCTGCGCATCTG-3′. Thefit2Δfit3Δ strain was transformed with the resulting PCR product, deletions were confirmed by PCR, and 5-FOA-resistant clones were selected. Strains containing deletions of individual and pairs ofFIT genes were generated by mating thefit1Δfit2Δfit3Δ strain with YPH500 (MATα ura3–52 lys2–801(amber) ade2–101(ochre) trp1–63 his3–200 leu2–1), sporulating the diploid, and analyzing random spore clones by PCR. The HA-FIT1 strain, which expresses a triple copy of the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope inserted into the 25th amino acid position of FIT1, just distal to the signal peptide, was constructed by PCR epitope tagging as described using the plasmid pMPY-3xHA (30Schneider B.L.

Integration of the HA epitope was confirmed by PCR and by Western blotting.

Probes for each of the FIT genes were prepared from PCR products corresponding to the open reading frames. Primers designed to amplify each open reading frame were obtained from Research Genetics. The 700 nucleotides located upstream of the FIT open reading frames were searched for AFT1 consensus binding sites using the oligo-analysis program of the Regulatory Sequence Analysis Tools web site (www.ucmb.ulb.ac.be/bioinformatics/rsa-tools).

Supplements were included in the uptake assay buffer and uptake allowed to proceed for 20 min prior to washing. To monitor the expression ofAFT1-dependent genes, cells transformed with a 2-μm FET3-lacZ reporter plasmid (kind gift of D. Winge) were grown to mid-log phase in defined iron media containing 30 μm ferrous ammonium sulfate. β-Galactosidase assays were performed as described (35Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C.A. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 123-127Google Scholar). To measure the release of iron from cell walls, washed cells were incubated for 1 h with 1 μm55Fe-ferrichrome in 0.5 mglucose and 50 mm sodium citrate buffer at pH 6.6. Iron-loaded cells were washed twice with 50 mm sodium citrate buffer and once with spheroplasting buffer (1.2 msorbitol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Cells were incubated with different concentrations of Zymolyase-100T (Sigma) in spheroplasting buffer for 10 min at 30 °C. The supernatants and cell pellets were collected after low speed centrifugation in a microcentrifuge (3000 rpm, 4 min), and 55Fe was measured by scintillation counting. cDNA microarrays representing the open reading frames of S. cerevisiae were used to identify genes that were transcriptionally activated by growth in iron-poor media and genes that were transcriptionally activated in a strain bearing a constitutively active allele of AFT1, AFT1–1up. Strains bearing the AFT1–1up allele exhibit elevated levels of expression of Aft1p-regulated genes, even under conditions where Aft1p-regulated genes are normally not expressed or expressed at very low levels (1Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Three homologous genes that demonstrated elevated mRNA levels in microarrays from iron-poor cultures and theAFT1–1up strain were selected for further analysis (Fig. 1A). These genes, YDR534C (FIT1), YOR382W(FIT2), and YOR383C (FIT3), exhibited very high levels of induction in microarrays and frequently were the most highly induced genes in the array. Each of these genes contained multiple Aft1p consensus binding sites in the DNA sequences upstream from the open reading frames (Fig. 1B). Previously identified Aft1p target genes have exhibited a single consensus binding site in the upstream sequences; the presence of multiple sites in theFIT genes could contribute to the extremely high mRNA levels observed in the arrays and in Northern blots (Fig.1C). Northern blot analysis of FIT1,FIT2, and FIT3 was performed, and eachFIT gene exhibited a similar pattern of expression. In a wild-type genetic background, FIT1, FIT2, andFIT3 mRNA transcripts were induced 60-, 140-, and 230-fold, respectively, by growth in iron-poor media (20 μm iron) as compared with iron-rich media (500 μm iron). The role of Aft1p in the iron-dependent regulation of the FIT genes was examined in strains expressing wild type Aft1p, deleted for Aft1p, or expressing Aft1–1upp. Strains were grown in iron-replete synthetic media in which Aft1p-dependent gene expression is normally low. Expression of wild-type Aft1p was associated with very low levels of FIT transcripts, and deletion of Aft1p was associated with virtually undetectable levels of FITtranscripts. In contrast, Aft1–1upp expression was associated with very high levels of FIT transcripts, suggesting that FIT1, FIT2, and FIT3are directly regulated by Aft1p. The FIT genes are located in the subtelomeric regions of chromosomes IV and XV, andFIT2 and FIT3 are part of an unusual cluster of Aft1p-regulated genes (Fig.2A). FIT2 andFIT3 occupy adjacent sites and are encoded on opposite strands of the chromosome. They are flanked on either side byFRE3 and FRE5, two members of the FREfamily of surface metalloreductases, a group of genes that are also regulated by Aft1p and involved in the reductive uptake of iron. The deduced amino acid sequence of FIT1, FIT2, andFIT3 (Fig. 2, B, C, and D, respectively) suggested that the proteins were components of the yeast cell wall. Each contains a putative signal sequence at the amino terminus, which targets the proteins for secretion, and a GPI signal for attachment of a GPI anchor. GPI-anchored proteins in the plasma membrane are incorporated into the cell wall by cleavage of the GPI moiety and attachment to β-1,6-glucan (24Goldman R.C. Branstrom A. Curr. Pharm. Des. 1999; 5: 473-501PubMed Google Scholar, 25Orlean P. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Cell Cycle and Cell Biology. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 229-362Google Scholar). The C-terminal sequences of FIT1, FIT2, and FIT3, when fused to a reporter protein, have been demonstrated to direct the reporter protein to the yeast cell wall (26Hamada K. Fukuchi S. Arisawa M. Baba M. Kitada K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 27Hamada K. Terashima H. Arisawa M. Yabuki N. Kitada K. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3886-3889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a version of Fit2p containing the HA epitope distal to the signal sequence was detected in extracts of the cell wall. These sequences, coupled with experimental data, strongly suggest that each of theFIT genes is a component of the yeast cell wall. The cell wall mannoproteins of S. cerevisiae are similar in that they tend to be serine- and threonine-rich, be heavily glycosylated, and contain repeated sequences (36Kapteyn J.C. Van Den Ende H. Klis F.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The predicted sequences of the mature FIT proteins contain 41–50% serine and threonine residues. FIT1 and FIT3 are 61% identical at the amino acid level and share a unique 60-amino acid sequence that is present, as a whole or in part, in four copies inFIT1 and two copies in FIT3. FIT2contains two copies of the central portion of this sequence. Additionally, FIT1 and FIT3 contain a shorter, 6-amino acid sequence, SA(A/V)ETS, that is present in an array of 11 tandem repeats in FIT1 and 5 overlapping repeats inFIT3. To confirm that the Fit proteins were cell wall mannoproteins, we constructed a strain in which the chromosomal copy of FIT1 contained a triple copy of the HA epitope, cloned in-frame, just distal to the signal peptide. Using this strain, we performed indirect immunofluorescence on cells grown in media containing low amounts of iron to induce the expression of HA-Fit1p (Fig. 3). The fluorescence signal from cells that were fixed, but not subjected to enzymatic digestion of the cell wall or permeabilization, is shown in Fig.3A. HA-Fit1p is clearly located in the periphery of the cell, including the nascent septum in the neck of a budding cell. In contrast, when the cell wall of HA-Fit1p cells was enzymatically removed prior to fluorescent antibody labeling, the fluorescence signal was very low and not detected on the periphery of the spheroplast (Fig.3C). Minimal fluorescence signal was detected in cells that express an HA-tagged version of Fet3p, a protein located in the plasma membrane, when the cell wall was intact (Fig. 3E). However, spheroplasted cells expressing Fet3p-HA exhibited a clear plasma membrane pattern of localization (Fig. 3G). These data indicated that Fit1p was an integral component of the cell wall, that the majority of the cell-associated Fit1p was incorporated into the cell wall, and that very little Fit1p was present in the plasma membrane. The Aft1p-regulated genes that have been functionally characterized have a role in either the reductive or nonreductive uptake of iron. Deletion of theFIT genes has been reported to result in subtle defects in growth on media containing the siderophore desferrioxamine B (28Foury F. Talibi D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7762-7768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). We quantitatively examined the role of the FIT genes in the reductive and nonreductive uptake of iron by measuring ferrous iron uptake and ferrioxamine B (FOB)-iron uptake in congenic strains bearing deletions of the FIT genes. Cells were grown to mid-log phase in rich medium containing either 100 μm BPS and 1 μm CuSO4 or 1 mm BPS before measurement of iron uptake. BPS is a strong chelator of ferrous iron, but also a weak chelator of copper. Cells grown in 1 mm BPS exhibit induced expression of iron uptake systems, but low levels of ferrous iron uptake because of inactivation of the copper-dependent Fet3p. Inclusion of BPS in the siderophore-iron assay inhibits reductive uptake of iron by chelation of reduced iron and by inactivation of Fet3p without affecting Arnp-dependent siderophore-iron uptake. Using these modified growth and assay conditions, we found that deletion of theFIT genes, individually and in combination, did not result in significant defects in high affinity ferrous iron uptake (Fig.4A). However, deletion of theFIT genes, individually and in pairs, resulted in an approximately 2-fold reduction in Arnp-dependent FOB-iron uptake (Fig. 4B). Surprisingly, deletion of all threeFIT genes did not result in a defect in FOB-iron uptake. These results were consistently observed and repeated in numerous experiments. FOB is a siderophore of the hydroxamate class and shares structural features with other hydroxamate siderophores, such as ferrichrome (FC) and triacetylfusarinine C (TAFC) (37Leong S.A. Winkelmann G. Sigel A. Sigel H. Iron Transport and Storage in Microorganisms, Plants, and Animals. 35. Marcel Dekker, New York1998: 147-186Google Scholar). Enterobactin (ENT) is a siderophore of the catecholate class and differs from the hydroxamates both in the coordination site for iron and in that the ferric form carries a −3 charge, whereas the hydroxamates have a neutral charge (38Albrect-Gary A. Crumbliss A.L. Sigel A. Sigel H. Iron Transport and Storage in Microorganisms, Plants, and Animals. 35. Marcel Dekker, New York1998: 239-328Google Scholar). We questioned whether deletion of the FIT genes would impact upon the uptake of iron from other siderophore sources. Uptake of FC-iron, ENT-iron, and TAFC-iron was measured and the results are presented in Fig. 5. Deletion of theFIT genes resulted in diminished uptake of FC in a pattern similar to that of FOB (Fig. 5A), although, as was the case with FOB, deletion of all three FIT genes resulted in FC-iron uptake activity that was similar to that of the FIT+parent strain. In contrast, deletion of the FIT genes had no effect on uptake of ENT-iron or TAFC-iron (Fig. 5, B andC). Because yeast homeostatically regulate the expression of iron uptake systems through the transcription factor Aft1p, theFIT-deletion mutants would be expected to respond to reduced levels of iron uptake by increasing the expression of proteins involved in iron uptake. The preceding experiments were conducted on cells that were grown in media primarily containing ferric iron as simple salts or in complexes with organic acids, but not bound to siderophore. We questioned whether FIT-deletion mutants, when grown in media primarily containing siderophore-iron, would adjust the expression of siderophore-iron uptake systems to compensate for the loss of Fit protein activity. When FIT+ and FIT-deletion mutant strains were grown in synthetic media containing FC, there was very little difference between the strains when the uptake of FC-iron was measured (Fig. 6A). These results suggested that the Fit proteins were not critical structural components of the iron uptake systems, but that they might have an indirect impact on the efficiency of iron uptake. We hypothesized that, if the Fit proteins functioned to improve the efficiency of iron uptake, then loss of the Fit proteins would result in less efficient iron uptake and a compensatory increase in the expression of systems of iron uptake. We employed two methods to test this hypothesis. First, wild type and FIT-deletion strains were transformed with a reporter plasmid bearing the β-galactosidase coding sequences under the control of theFET3 promoter. This promoter is strongly induced by iron deprivation and is a target for Aft1p (2Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). To directly compare siderophore iron uptake levels with the expression of Aft1p target genes, these cells were grown in defined iron media containing low concentrations of iron and FC-iron uptake and β-galactosidase activities were measured. FC-iron uptake was lower in theFIT-deletion strains, including thefit1Δfit2Δfit3Δ strain, than in the congenic parent strain (Fig. 6B). When β-galactosidase activity was measured in these cells, the activity was induced 2–3-fold in all of the FIT-mutant strains, including thefit1Δfit2Δfit3Δ strain (Fig.7A). These data suggested that, although transcription of an Aft1p-target gene (FET3) was increased in the FIT-deletion strains, these strains did not exhibit a comparable increase in the reductive uptake of ferric iron and they exhibited diminished nonreductive uptake of siderophore iron. In our second method to evaluate the effects of FIT gene deletion on the expression of systems of iron uptake, wild type andFIT-deletion strains were transformed with pARN1-HA, a plasmid containing an HA-tagged allele of Arn1p under the control of its own promoter (19Yun C.W. Tiedeman J.S. Moore R.E. Philpott C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16354-16359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Arn1p is a siderophore-iron transporter with specificity for FC, the expression of which is strongly regulated by iron through Aft1p. Western blot analysis of Arn1p expression levels revealed that deletion of the FIT genes resulted in increased expression of Arn1p, and that this increase in expression occurred when cells were grown in media containing either simple salts of iron or FC-iron (Fig. 7B). These data suggested that deletion of the FIT genes resulted in alterations of the intracellular pools of iron, which led to activation of Aft1p and increased expression of systems of iron uptake. Given that the Fit proteins are located in the cell wall, Fitp-dependent alterations in intracellular pools of iron are likely due to alterations in uptake of iron at the cell surface. The Fit proteins did not appear to have a role in controlling flocculation or the porosity of the cell wall (data not shown). Previous work has suggested that low-affinity binding sites for ferric iron exist on the exterior surface of yeast (39Lesuisse E. Raguzzi F. Crichton R.R. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1987; 133: 3229-3236PubMed Google Scholar). We tested whether the Fit proteins contributed to the retention of iron in the cell wall and periplasmic space by allowing cells to take up labeled iron as ferric-FC, then measuring the retention of the labeled iron within the cells and the release of the labeled iron when the cell wall was partially digested with Zymolyase-100T. Zymolyase is a mixture of β-1,3-glucanase and protease activities that can effect the release of mannoproteins from the cell wall (40Scott J.H. Schekman R. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 142: 414-423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of iron-loaded, wild type cells with Zymolyase resulted in a dose-dependent release of ∼40% of the cell-associated labeled iron into the supernatant fraction (Fig.8, A and B). However, FIT-deletion mutant strains released significantly lower amounts of iron after Zymolyase treatment than did the wild type strain and no differences were observed between the fit1Δ, the fit2Δfit3Δ, and the fit1Δfit2Δfit3Δstrains. These data indicate that a relatively large proportion of the cell-associated iron is retained in the cell wall and periplasmic space in S. cerevisiae, and that deletion of the FITgenes results in a decrease in the amount of iron that is retained in the cell wall and periplasmic space. Retention of iron outside the plasma membrane does not occur if cells are incubated with iron at 0 °C, suggesting that cellular metabolic processes are involved in the accumulation of iron. As part of the coordinated response to iron deprivation, S. cerevisiae expresses a set of proteins that function in the uptake of iron from a variety of extracellular sources. Here we demonstrate that three proteins that are components of the yeast cell wall are part of this response and that they facilitate the uptake of iron, possibly by increasing the amount of iron associated with the cell wall and periplasmic space. Previous work in characterizing the metal uptake systems of yeast has focused on critical elements of the systems: genes or gene families that when deleted, result in the near complete loss of transport activity. The Fit proteins do not appear to be critical components of the iron uptake machinery; yeast cells can compensate for the absence of these proteins by increasing levels of expression of the other components in the systems of iron uptake. We have directly demonstrated that loss of the Fit proteins results in defects in the Arn-dependent system of siderophore-iron uptake and defects in retention of siderophore-iron in the cell wall. Indirect evidence suggests that the Fit proteins have an effect on the uptake on non-siderophore sources of iron, as well. A strain bearing deletions ofFIT1, FIT2, and FIT3 had no measurable defect in iron uptake when the cells were grown in iron-chelated, rich media, yet this same strain exhibited a marked defect in FC-iron uptake after growth in iron-chelated synthetic media. This phenotypic difference may be explained by a greater compensatory increase in the expression of iron uptake systems when the cells were grown in rich media. The Fit proteins may act to enhance the efficiency of the cell's systems of iron uptake by acting as a bridge across the cell wall for iron. The capacity to express genes that modulate the activity of uptake systems in a more subtle fashion can be important. One example of this subtle modulation is the HFE protein present in mammalian systems of iron uptake (41Andrews N.C. Curr. Opin. Pediatr. 2000; 12: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 42Bacon B.R. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 718-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Defects in the HFE gene are responsible for the human disease hereditary hemochromatosis. Patients with hereditary hemochromatosis exhibit a subtle increase in the absorption of dietary iron that leads to the slow accumulation of iron in vital organs. Symptoms of the disease are typically not manifest until the fourth or fifth decade of life, but patients frequently develop heart failure, liver failure, and liver cancer. Hence, subtle modulations in iron uptake can have a significant impact on the survival of an organism. The FIT genes were transcriptionally activated by Aft1p, they contain multiple Aft1p consensus binding sites, and they exhibit a greater range of activation than other Aft1p target genes. Conversely, transcript levels of the FIT genes are virtually undetectable in an AFT1-deletion strain. The FITgenes could also be targets for the recently described Aft2p (43Blaiseau P.L. Lesuisse E. Camadro J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34221-34226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Aft2p is 39% identical to Aft1p and was recently shown to activate the transcription of the Aft1p target, FET3. Deletions of the individual FIT genes and of combinations of FIT genes led to similar defects in the uptake of siderophore-iron and the retention of iron at the surface of the cells. These genes appear to be epistatic, and their protein products may interact within the cell wall to form an active complex or system for iron retention. We found that a surprisingly large amount of iron was associated with the cell wall and periplasmic space. Previous investigators have found that significant amounts of copper are deposited in the cell wall in a sulfide-dependent manner that also depends on active cellular metabolism (44Lin C.M. Crawford B.F. Kosman D.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 1605-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In addition to facilitating the uptake of iron, the Fit proteins may also contribute to the storage of iron in the cell wall. FIT gene expression during periods of moderate iron deprivation could enable cells to store iron to be used in periods of extreme iron deprivation. Hamada and co-workers (26Hamada K. Fukuchi S. Arisawa M. Baba M. Kitada K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) identified 53 open reading frames in the yeast genome that potentially encoded GPI-anchored proteins of the plasma membrane and cell wall. More than half of these open reading frames had unknown function. Analysis of the GPI attachment signals indicated that the signals varied greatly in the efficiency with which they directed incorporation of a reporter protein into the cell wall (27Hamada K. Terashima H. Arisawa M. Yabuki N. Kitada K. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3886-3889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In their studies, the Fit1p sequences directed incorporation much more efficiently than those of Fit2p or Fit3p. Therefore, some Fit2p and Fit3p might also be present on the plasma membrane and in the periplasmic space. The cell wall is engaged in growth, morphogenesis, adhesion, flocculation, and mating. Here, we add to this list the acquisition and storage of essential nutrients. More than half of the predicted cell wall mannoproteins have unknown function, and as these proteins are functionally characterized the list of cellular processes to which the cell wall contributes will undoubtedly grow.

CUL-4A can physically associate with the damagedDNA-binding protein (DDB), which is composed of two subunits, p125 and p48. DDB binds specifically to UV-damaged DNA and is believed to play a role in DNA repair. We report here that CUL-4A stimulates degradation of p48 through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, resulting in an overall decrease in UV-damaged DNA binding activity. The R273H mutant of p48 identified from a xeroderma pigmentosium (group E) patient is not subjected to CUL-4A-mediated proteolysis, consistent with its inability to bind CUL-4A. p125 is also an unstable protein, and its ubiquitination is stimulated by CUL-4A. However, the abundance of p125 is not dramatically altered byCul-4A overexpression. UV irradiation inhibits p125 degradation, which is temporally coupled to the UV-induced translocation of p125 from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. CUL-4A is localized primarily in the cytoplasm.

For simplicity, the two DDB subunits are referred to as p125 and p48 from hereon. p125 is an abundant protein that is in excess of p48 (16Shiyanov P. Nag A. Raychaudhuri P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 21293-21300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the p48 subunit is the limiting factor for UV-DDB activity and functions to activate p125 binding to damaged DNA (19Tang J.Y.

Biol. 1998; 18: 4391-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). UV irradiation induces p48 transcription in a p53-dependent manner, resulting in the subsequent accumulation of p48 protein (18Hwang B.J. Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mutations in the p48 subunit of DDB were identified in patients suffering from the autosomal recessive disease, xeroderma pigmentosium (complementation group E) (XP-E), which is characterized by defective nucleotide excision repair and predisposition to skin cancer (30Chu G.

One such p48 mutant, 2RO (R273H), fails to associate with p125 and CUL-4A and is incapable of mediating nuclear accumulation of p125 (16Shiyanov P. Nag A. Raychaudhuri P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35309-35312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 29Shiyanov P. Hayes S.A. Donepudi M. Nichols A.F. Linn S. Slagle B.L. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4935-4943Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Mutations of the p125 subunit have not been identified in XP-E patients, however, a 50% decrease in the steady-state levels of p125 has been reported in several DDB− XP-E cells (34Rapic Otrin V. Kuraoka I. Nardo T. McLenigan M. Eker A.P. Stefanini M. Levine A.S. Wood R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3182-3190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest a requirement for the precise control of the amount of p125 and p48 inside the cell.Here we report that CUL-4A stimulates the ubiquitination and degradation of the p48 subunit of DDB, resulting in an overall decrease of UV-DDB activity. The 2RO mutant of p48, which is defective in binding to p125 and CUL-4A, is resistant to degradation induced byCul-4A overexpression. Ectopic expression ofCul-4A also resulted in accelerated p125 ubiquitination. These studies identify DDB as the first target of the CUL-4A ubiquitination machinery and suggest a possible link between the abnormal Cul-4A expression in tumor cells and the inhibition of DDB-dependent repair of UV-damaged DNA.DISCUSSIONLittle is known about the proteolytic targets and the cellular processes controlled by the CUL-4A ubiquitination machinery. Recent biochemical studies indicate the association of CUL-4A with the DDB complex, however, the physiological role of this interaction is unknown. The results shown in this study provide compelling evidence that both subunits of the heterodimeric DDB complex are targets of CUL-4A-mediated ubiquitination. First, CUL-4A stimulated the accumulation of higher molecular weight species that were immunoreactive with both DDB subunits (p125 or p48) and HA-tagged ubiquitin (Fig. 3 B and Fig. 5). Second, the CUL-4A(Δ) mutant defective for binding Rbx1 3L. Douglas, unpublished result. was also impaired in ubiquitinating p125 and p48 (Fig. 5, data not shown). This indicates that the association between Rbx1 and the conserved CH domain of CUL-4A is essential for CUL-4A-mediated ubiquitination, similar to what has been demonstrated for the Rbx1/CUL-1 machinery (37Wu K. Fuchs S.Y. Chen A. Tan P. Gomez C. Ronai Z. Pan Z.Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1382-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Third, ectopic expression of Cul-1 did not stimulate the ubiquitination and/or degradation of p125 or p48, suggesting that DDB proteins are specific targets of CUL-4A (Fig. 5, data not shown). Finally, the R273H (2RO) mutant of p48, which is defective for binding CUL-4A, is not subjected to CUL-4A-mediated degradation (Fig. 3 E). These findings demonstrate that the CUL-4A ubiquitination machinery specifically targets the damaged DNA-binding proteins p125 and p48 for ubiquitination.The CUL-4A-mediated degradation of DDB correlates with the cellular distribution of CUL-4A and the DDB subunits. Our immunofluorescence results indicate that CUL-4A is localized predominantly in the cytoplasm, and a small fraction (∼2–3%) of CUL-4A could be detected in the nucleus (Fig. 2). The presence of leucine-rich sequences within CUL-4A, which is similar to the human immunodeficiency virus rev-like nuclear export sequence (38Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar), may account for its predominant cytoplasmic localization through nuclear export. 4L. Douglas and P. Zhou, unpublished result. Because nuclear translocation of p125 upon UV irradiation correlates with a reduction of its turn over rate (Fig. 4), it is likely that the ubiquitin-protein ligase activity of CUL-4A is limiting in the nuclear compartment. This result is consistent with the observation that p48, which resides exclusively in the nucleus (28Liu W. Nichols A.F. Graham J.A. Dualan R. Abbas A. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21429-21434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 29Shiyanov P. Hayes S.A. Donepudi M. Nichols A.F. Linn S. Slagle B.L. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4935-4943Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), was rapidly degraded whenCul-4A was overexpressed (Fig. 3). In accordance with p48 destabilization, we observed an overall reduction in damaged DNA binding activity by DDB (Fig. 6). Therefore, CUL-4A-induced degradation of p48 plays a critical role in restricting the UV-DDB activity.p125 is a relatively abundant protein and is present in excess over p48 in unirradiated HeLa cells (16Shiyanov P. Nag A. Raychaudhuri P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35309-35312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 21Keeney S. Chang G.J. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21293-21300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our studies indicate that p125 is metabolically unstable, suggesting a requirement for the precise control of p125 levels inside the cell. Interestingly, a previous study (34Rapic Otrin V. Kuraoka I. Nardo T. McLenigan M. Eker A.P. Stefanini M. Levine A.S. Wood R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3182-3190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that in at least three DDB− XP-E cells, p125 levels were at least 50% lower than that in the DDB+ cells. We have shown that CUL-4A induced a robust p125 ubiquitination, but a significant decrease in the overall levels of cellular p125 has not been observed under these experimental conditions (Fig. 1 C, data not shown). One possibility is that CUL-4A may not be rate-limiting for degradation of p125, therefore, the overexpression of Cul-4A could not further reduce the steady-state levels of p125. Alternatively, p125 has been shown to participate in transcriptional regulation as well as other cellular functions (39Hayes S. Shiyanov P. Chen X. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 240-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 40Krishnamoorthy R.R. Lee T.H. Butel J.S. Das H.K.

Greengard P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and there might be only a fraction of cellular p125 that participates in DNA damage recognition and repair and is subjected to CUL-4A-mediated proteolysis. Because p125 is known to be a highly abundant protein inside the cell (∼105 molecules/cell) (21Keeney S. Chang G.J. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21293-21300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is likely that the endogenous p125 competes with the transfected p125-HA for the CUL-4A machinery. Alternatively, because proteolysis is not the only destination or immediate fate of an ubiquitinated protein (reviewed in Ref. 1Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2887) Google Scholar), it is also possible that ubiquitination of p125 might have additional roles besides degradation. Non-proteolytic functions have been demonstrated for mono-ubiquitination or polyubiquitin chains linked through the Lys-63 residue of ubiquitin (44Spence J. Sadis S. Haas A.L. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 645-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 46Spence J. Gali R.R.

Intriguingly, the Ub(K63R) mutation leads to UV sensitivity and defective DNA repair in yeast (44Spence J. Sadis S. Haas A.L. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 645-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). We have consistently observed the CUL-4A-stimulated formation of mono- and di-ubiquitin-modified p125 (Fig. 5, B and C). Future studies should address whether there is a degradation-independent function of CUL-4A-stimulated p125 ubiquitination, which specifies its distinct biological activities.Microinjection of purified DDB into DDB− XP-E cells restored the in vivo DNA repair synthesis to normal levels, establishing the function of DDB in DNA repair (17Keeney S. Eker A.P. Brody T. Vermeulen W. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. Linn S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4053-4056Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, in vitro reconstitution studies indicated that DDB is not required for nucleotide excision repair of either naked or nucleosomal DNA (48Aboussekhra A. Biggerstaff M. Shivji M.K. Vilpo J.A.

Biol. 2000; 20: 9173-9181Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Kazantsev et al. (49Kazantsev A. Mu D. Nichols A.F. Zhao X. Linn S. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5014-5018Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) observed an inhibitory rather than stimulatory effect of DDB on the excision repair of 6-4 photoproduct-containing DNA substrate in the in vitro nucleotide excision repair reactions. Thus, it has been suggested that DDB is involved in the initial DNA damage recognition step (28Liu W. Nichols A.F. Graham J.A. Dualan R. Abbas A. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21429-21434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and must subsequently be removed prior to the initiation of the nucleotide excision repair reactions. We propose that CUL-4A-stimulated ubiquitination and degradation of p48 may serve to restrict the steady-state levels of DDB inside the cell, therefore, ensuring the rapid dynamics of DDB at different stages of DNA damage recognition and repair.The observation that abnormally high levels of CUL-4A are found in many human tumors suggests a potential role of CUL-4A in tumorigenesis. p48 has been shown to be the rate-limiting factor for UV-DDB activity and functions to suppress UV-induced mutations from genomic DNA and the non-transcribed DNA strand of expressed genes (19Tang J.Y. Hwang B.J. Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Chu G. Mol Cell. 2000; 5: 737-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). “Loss of function” mutations in the p48 subunit of DDB, such as R273H, are responsible for the loss of UV-DDB activity and are associated with an increased risk for skin cancer. Our studies indicated that high level expression of CUL-4A down-regulates the steady-state levels of wild type p48 and, therefore, leads to the inhibition of UV-DDB activity. This will result in the accumulation of damage-induced lesions on DNA, a similar outcome as that resultant from the p48(R273H) mutation, and thus contribute to tumor development. Ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis plays an important role in controlling cell cycle, signal transduction, apoptosis, and a variety of other cellular processes. Through the action of a multienzyme system consisting of the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, and the E31 ubiquitin-protein ligase, multiple ubiquitin moieties are delivered to the target protein to form a polyubiquitin chain through the isopeptide linkage between the ε-amino group of the lysine 48 residue of one ubiquitin and the carboxyl terminus of the adjacent ubiquitin. In turn, polyubiquitination serves as the signal for recognition and degradation by the 26 S proteasome (recently reviewed in Refs. 1Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2887) Google Scholar and 2Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar).

These lipids are mainly chain-shortened for excretion as the carboxylic acids or transported to mitochondria for further metabolism. Several of these carboxylic acids are slowly oxidized and may therefore sequester coenzyme A (CoASH). To prevent CoASH sequestration and to facilitate excretion of chain-shortened carboxylic acids, acyl-CoA thioesterases, which catalyze the hydrolysis of acyl-CoAs to the free acid and CoASH, may play important roles. Here we have cloned and characterized a peroxisomal acyl-CoA thioesterase from mouse, named PTE-2 (peroxisomal acyl-CoA thioesterase 2). PTE-2 is ubiquitously expressed and induced at mRNA level by treatment with the peroxisome proliferator WY-14,643 and fasting. Induction seen by these treatments was dependent on the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α. Recombinant PTE-2 showed a broad chain length specificity with acyl-CoAs from short- and medium-, to long-chain acyl-CoAs, and other substrates including trihydroxycoprostanoyl-CoA, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA, and branched chain acyl-CoAs, all of which are present in peroxisomes. Highest activities were found with the CoA esters of primary bile acids choloyl-CoA and chenodeoxycholoyl-CoA as substrates. PTE-2 activity is inhibited by free CoASH, suggesting that intraperoxisomal free CoASH levels regulate the activity of this enzyme. The acyl-CoA specificity of recombinant PTE-2 closely resembles that of purified mouse liver peroxisomes, suggesting that PTE-2 is the major acyl-CoA thioesterase in peroxisomes. Addition of recombinant PTE-2 to incubations containing isolated mouse liver peroxisomes strongly inhibited bile acid-CoA:amino acidN-acyltransferase activity, suggesting that this thioesterase can interfere with CoASH-dependent pathways. We propose that PTE-2 functions as a key regulator of peroxisomal lipid metabolism. Peroxisomes function in β-oxidation of very long and long-chain fatty acids, dicarboxylic fatty acids, bile acid intermediates, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, thromboxanes, pristanic acid, and xenobiotic carboxylic acids. These lipids are mainly chain-shortened for excretion as the carboxylic acids or transported to mitochondria for further metabolism. Several of these carboxylic acids are slowly oxidized and may therefore sequester coenzyme A (CoASH). To prevent CoASH sequestration and to facilitate excretion of chain-shortened carboxylic acids, acyl-CoA thioesterases, which catalyze the hydrolysis of acyl-CoAs to the free acid and CoASH, may play important roles. Here we have cloned and characterized a peroxisomal acyl-CoA thioesterase from mouse, named PTE-2 (peroxisomal acyl-CoA thioesterase 2). PTE-2 is ubiquitously expressed and induced at mRNA level by treatment with the peroxisome proliferator WY-14,643 and fasting. Induction seen by these treatments was dependent on the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α. Recombinant PTE-2 showed a broad chain length specificity with acyl-CoAs from short- and medium-, to long-chain acyl-CoAs, and other substrates including trihydroxycoprostanoyl-CoA, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA, and branched chain acyl-CoAs, all of which are present in peroxisomes.

They play an indispensable role in the metabolism of a variety of lipids including very long-chain fatty acids, dicarboxylic fatty acids, bile acids, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, thromboxanes, pristanic acid, and xenobiotic fatty acids (for review, see Refs. 1Van Veldhoven P.P. Mannaerts G.P. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 466: 261-272Google Scholar and2Reddy J.K. Hashimoto T. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2001; 21: 193-230Google Scholar). The peroxisomal β-oxidation system contains two sets of enzymes, one of which is involved in the oxidation of branched chain fatty acids and intermediates in the hepatic bile acid biosynthetic pathway and consists of one or two branched-chain acyl-CoA oxidase(s), ad-specific bifunctional protein and the sterol carrier-like protein x (SCPx). The second pathway is involved in the oxidation of very long straight-chain fatty acids, CoA esters of prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and thromboxanes (prostanoids) and dicarboxylic acids. This system is composed of a straight-chain acyl-CoA oxidase, anl-specific bifunctional protein and straight-chain 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase. However, these two pathways are not mutually exclusive (1Van Veldhoven P.P. Mannaerts G.P. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 466: 261-272Google Scholar). All enzymes in this latter pathway are induced by peroxisome proliferators, whereas the enzymes in the former β-oxidation pathway are not. Peroxisome proliferators are a group of structurally diverse compounds including hypolipidemic drugs, which induce peroxisome proliferation, hepatomegaly, and cause hepatocarcinogenesis in rodent liver. These peroxisome proliferators, together with free fatty acids, act as ligands for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα)1 (3Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Google Scholar, 4Kliewer S.A. Sundseth S.S. Jones S.A. Brown P.J. Wisely G.B. Koble C.S. Devchand P. Wahli W. Willson T.M. Lenhard J.M. Lehmann J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4318-4323Google Scholar). The PPARα is a nuclear receptor that plays a central role in fatty acid metabolism and induces the expression of many enzymes involved in peroxisomal and mitochondrial β-oxidation and ω-oxidation of fatty acids. Targeted disruption of the PPARα gene in mouse has established a key role for this receptor as a mediator of lipid metabolism (5Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L.

Alexson S.E.H. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 814-823Google Scholar, 8Kroetz D.L. Yook P. Costet P. Bianchi P. Pineau Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31581-31589Google Scholar, 9Kersten S. Seydoux J.

A. 1999; 96: 7473-7478Google Scholar). Prior to transport into peroxisomes and β-oxidation, all substrates must be activated to their CoA ester, which occurs at different cellular locations. Long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases are present in different subcellular membranes (11Lewin T.M. Kim J.H. Granger D.A. Vance J.E. Coleman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24674-24679Google Scholar, 12Gargiulo C.E. Stuhlsatz-Krouper S.M. Schaffer J.E. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 881-892Google Scholar) and long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase in the peroxisomal membrane activates very long and long-chain fatty acids and possibly branched-chain fatty acids to their CoA esters. Dicarboxylic fatty acids, prostanoids, and di- and trihydroxycoprostanic acid are activated to their CoA esters in the endoplasmic reticulum. These CoA esters are then transported into peroxisomes, possibly via ABC transporters. Peroxisomal β-oxidation of very long and long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs results in chain-shortening of these esters, and the chain-shortened products can be transported as carnitine esters to mitochondria for further degradation. However, peroxisomes appear to have important roles in β-oxidation of a number of xenobiotic carboxylic acids which may only be partially metabolized in peroxisomes (13Yamada J. Itoh S. Horie S. Watanabe T. Suga T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1986; 35: 4363-4368Google Scholar, 14Yamada J. Ogawa S. Horie S. Watanabe T. Suga T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 921: 292-301Google Scholar). The β-oxidation of other CoA esters, such as prostanoids results in chain-shortening in peroxisomes, which are subsequently excreted in urine as the free carboxylic acid (for review, see Ref. 15Diczfalusy U. Prog. Lipid Res. 1994; 33: 403-428Google Scholar). Similarly the β-oxidation of dicarboxylic acids results in a chain-shortening in peroxisomes with the dicarboxylic acid being excreted in urine as the free acid or as glycine conjugates. Several of these carboxylic acids are only slowly β-oxidized, implying that intraperoxisomal CoASH may be sequestered to such an extent that it becomes limiting. To maintain appropriate CoASH levels and to facilitate excretion of chain-shortened carboxylic acids, acyl-CoA thioesterases are likely to play important roles (for review, see Ref.16Hunt M.C. Alexson S.E.H. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; (in press)Google Scholar). The hydrolysis of CoA esters to the free acids requires the presence of an acyl-CoA thioesterase, an enzyme that functions to hydrolyze CoA esters to the free acid and CoASH. To date, however, the specific thioesterase(s) active on CoA esters of prostanoids or dicarboxylic acids have not been identified. Another important reaction that occurs in liver peroxisomes is the formation of bile acids. The primary bile acids, cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid, are formed by a number of enzymatic modifications of the cholesterol backbone by P-450 enzymes. The di- or trihydroxycoprostanoyl-CoA (DHCA-CoA or THCA-CoA) formed undergoes a final β-oxidative cleavage of the side chain in peroxisomes with the release of propionyl-CoA, to form chenodeoxycholoyl-CoA and choloyl-CoA, respectively (17Pedersen J.I. Gustafsson J. FEBS Lett. 1980; 121: 345-348Google Scholar, 18Kase F. Björkhem I. Pedersen J.I. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 24: 1560-1567Google Scholar). The peroxisomal bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase (BAAT) then catalyzes the conjugation of the CoA-activated bile acid to taurine or glycine prior to secretion from liver into bile. Recently, a multiorganellar bile acid-CoA thioesterase activity, which hydrolyzes the bile acid-CoA esters to free bile acids and CoASH, has been characterized in human liver peroxisomes (19Solaas K. Ulvestad A. Söreide O. Kase B.F. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1154-1162Google Scholar, 20Solaas K. Sletta R.J. Søreide O. Kase B.F. Scand. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 60: 91-102Google Scholar). This bile acid-CoA thioesterase activity described may compete with the BAAT enzyme for the bile acid-CoA substrate, thereby influencing intracellular levels of free and conjugated bile acids. The existence of selective acyl-CoA thioesterases or a “broad range” acyl-CoA thioesterase could provide important control points in the oxidation of many peroxisomal substrates and to regulate intracellular levels of CoA esters and CoASH. This may be especially important during times of high β-oxidation and fatty acid overload, to generate free CoASH necessary for fatty acid β-oxidation to proceed. Acyl-CoA thioesterase activity has indeed been shown to be present in peroxisomes (21Osmundsen H. Neat C.E. Borrebaek B. Int. J. Biochem. 1980; 12: 625-630Google Scholar, 22Berge R.K. Flatmark T. Osmundsen H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 637-644Google Scholar, 23Alexson S.E.H. Osmundsen H. Berge R.K. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 41-46Google Scholar, 24Wilcke M. Alexson S.E.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 803-811Google Scholar), and isolated rat brown adipose tissue peroxisomes contain acyl-CoA thioesterase(s) active on short- and medium-chain acyl-CoAs, which are inhibited by CoASH (23Alexson S.E.H. Osmundsen H. Berge R.K. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 41-46Google Scholar). Rat liver peroxisomes showed broad acyl-CoA thioesterase activity on C2–C22 acyl-CoAs, and one enzyme was partially purified, which was shown to be most active on myristoyl-CoA (24Wilcke M. Alexson S.E.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 803-811Google Scholar). To date, several peroxisomal acyl-CoA thioesterases have been cloned from yeast, mouse, and human. PTE-Ia and -Ib have been cloned from mouse, which belong to a novel family of Type I acyl-CoA thioesterases, with related enzymes also in cytosol and mitochondria (25Hunt M.C. Nousiainen S.E.B. Huttunen M.K. Orii K. Svensson L.T. Alexson S.E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34317-34326Google Scholar). Acyl-CoA thioesterases have been identified in yeast and human peroxisomes, named PTE1 (26Jones J.M. Nau K. Geraghty M.T. Erdmann R. Gould S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9216-9223Google Scholar). The human homologue of PTE1 was previously identified as hACTEIII/hTE, a protein that interacted with and activated the HIV-1 Nef protein (27Watanabe H. Shiratori T. Shoji H. Miyatake S. Okazaki Y. Ikuta K. Sato T. Saito T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 234-239Google Scholar, 28Liu L.X. Margottin F. Le Gall S. Schwartz O. Selig L. Benarous R. Benichou S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13779-13785Google Scholar). In the present study we have cloned the mouse homologue of PTE1/hACTEIII/hTE, which we have named mouse peroxisomal acyl-CoA thioesterase 2 (PTE-2). We have characterized this enzyme in detail, to examine its putative function in peroxisomal β-oxidation. Characterization of PTE-2 suggests that it is a major thioesterase with an array of functions in peroxisomal lipid metabolism. [24-14C]Chenodeoxycholoyl-CoA and [24-14C]choloyl-CoA (specific activity 48.6 Ci/mol), trihydroxy-cholestanoyl-CoA, 2-methylstearoyl-CoA, and prostaglandin F2α-CoA were synthesized by the mixed anhydride procedure (29Shah P.P. Staple E. Steroids. 1968; 12: 571-575Google Scholar) and the former two CoA esters purified by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). [24-14C]Chenodeoxycholic acid and [24-14C]cholic acid were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Optiprep and Maxidens were from Nycomed Pharma AS, Oslo, Norway. Taurine, chenodeoxycholic acid, cholic acid, all other acyl-CoAs, and coenzyme A were from Sigma. Prostaglandin F2α was from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Diurnal variation was investigated in adult male C57 BL/6 mice (B & K, Sollentuna, Sweden). The mice were maintained on a normal chow diet and sacrificed at the time points indicated. The dark periods were between 18.00 and 06.00 h. All other treatments were carried out on 10- to 12-week-old male wild-type or PPARα-null mice on a pure Sv/129 genetic background (derived from the original colony of mixed background mice) (5Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Google Scholar). These animals were housed in a temperature- and light-controlled environment. In fasting experiments, mice were maintained on a normal chow diet (R36 Lactamin, Vadstena, Sweden) prior to the start of the experiment and then transferred to new cages and fasted for 24 h. Alternatively mice were treated with 0.1% WY-14,643 (Calbiochem-Novabiochem International) in the diet for 1 week. All mice had access to waterad libitum. Animals were sacrificed by CO2asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation and weighed immediately. Tissues were then excised, weighed, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. For subcellular fractionation experiments, livers from untreated wild-type mice were homogenized directly after sacrifice. Total RNA was isolated from mouse tissue samples using QuickPrep® Total RNA Extraction Kit (Amersham Biosciences Inc., Uppsala, Sweden), and Northern blot analysis was carried out as described previously (7Hunt M.C. Lindquist P.J.G. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Diczfalusy U. Alexson S.E.H. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 814-823Google Scholar). Blots were probed with the full-length cDNA for mouse PTE-2 or a probe for β-actin and were exposed to x-ray film at −70 °C. Using human hACTEIII/hTE/hPTE1cDNA sequence (26Jones J.M. Nau K. Geraghty M.T. Erdmann R. Gould S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9216-9223Google Scholar, 27Watanabe H. Shiratori T. Shoji H. Miyatake S. Okazaki Y. Ikuta K. Sato T. Saito T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1997; 272: 13779-13785Google Scholar) as search templates, a PAC clone containing ∼86 kb of human genomic sequence was found to contain the gene encoding PTE-2. This human genomic sequence (GenBankTM accession number AL008726) was downloaded from NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The gene structure was compiled using Lasergene Software Package and 5′ splice donor sites and 3′ splice acceptor sites conformed to the general consensus sequences. The sequence for hACTEIII/hTE/hPTE1 (26Jones J.M. Nau K. Geraghty M.T. Erdmann R. Gould S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9216-9223Google Scholar, 27Watanabe H. Shiratori T. Shoji H. Miyatake S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 13779-13785Google Scholar) was used to search the mouse expressed sequence tag data base and several hits were obtained. The full-length cDNA sequence was compiled from overlapping expressed sequence tag sequences. The mPTE-2 cDNA was amplified using the following primers: 5′-CATATGTCAGCGCCAGAGGGTCTG-3′ and 5′-CATATGCTATAGCTTACTCTCTGACACCAG-3′. Both primers were constructed with the addition of an NdeI site, indicated in bold. The full-length cDNA was amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR using a template of clofibrate-treated mouse liver total RNA. PCR was performed in a PerkinElmer 2600 using the Gene-Amp XL PCR kit (PE Biosystems). Thermal cycling was performed at 98 °C for 10 min followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 64 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 4 min. The resultant PCR product was cloned into the pCR-Script Amp (SK+) vector (Stratagene) and was subsequently sequenced. The full-length cDNA for PTE-2 was excised from pCR-Script using NdeI restriction enzyme and cloned into theNdeI site in pET16b vector (Novagen Inc.). Sequence analysis was carried out to confirm the correct orientation. This plasmid was then used to transform BL21 (DES3)pLysS cells (Novagen Inc.). For expression of PTE-2, bacteria were cultured in 1 liter of Luria-Bertani medium at 37 °C, with addition of ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml) until an A600 nmof about 0.6 was reached. Induction of protein expression was performed by addition of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and growth was continued overnight at room temperature. The bacteria were centrifuged at 8,000 × gmax for 10 min at 4 °C and the pellets were washed with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0. The pellets were then frozen at −20 °C. Pellets were thawed and resuspended in 20 mm phosphate, 0.5 m sodium chloride, and 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, and sonicated 5 × 5 s, at 5-s intervals. The sonicated bacteria were then centrifuged at 36,000 × gmax for 1 h, and the supernatant was used for purification of PTE-2 on a HiTrapTM column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Following equilibration of the column, the supernatant was applied, and the column was washed stepwise with 50, 100, 200, and 300 mm imidazole in 20 mm phosphate, 0.5m sodium chloride, to remove contaminating proteins. The PTE-2 protein was eluted using 500 mm imidazole, 20 mm phosphate, 0.5 m sodium chloride and was subsequently used for acyl-CoA thioesterase activity measurements. The purity of PTE-2 was examined by SDS-PAGE analysis and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Oligonucleotides were designed based on the sequence of the full-length cDNA for mouse PTE-2 for cloning as a fusion protein with green fluorescent protein (GFP), to examine targeting of the protein to peroxisomes. The full-length cDNA was amplified by One Step RNA PCR kit (avian myeloblastosis virus) (Takara Biomedicals) using the primers 5′-ATGTCAGCGCCAGAGGGTC-3′ and 5′-CGAGCCAGGCATCTTTCAC-3′ and was cloned into the pcDNA3.1/NT-GFP vector (Invitrogen) in-frame with the GFP at the N-terminal end. Sequence analysis was performed using Big Dye Terminator (ABI Prism, PE Biosystems) and was sequenced by Cybergene (Novum, Sweden). Human skin fibroblasts from a control subject and a Zellweger patient were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium (Sigma), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and 100 units of penicillin/100 μg of streptomycin in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. The Zellweger patient was a first-born, full-term female with muscular hypotonia, convulsions, and dysmorphic characteristics of Zellweger syndrome. The clinical diagnosis was verified by the accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids with a highly elevated C26/C22 ratio in cultured fibroblasts. Both control and Zellweger cells were grown overnight in 60-mm dishes on glass coverslips and were transfected with 8 μg of mPTE-2/GFP plasmid using the calcium phosphate method. Transfected cells were grown for 48 h, washed twice with PBS, and fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min on ice. Cells were permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS and rewashed in PBS. Following blocking in 2% BSA in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h, cells were incubated with rabbit green fluorescent protein antibody (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) for 1 h and washed four times with PBS, 2% BSA, and 0.1% Tween 20. Cells were then incubated with CY3-conjugated affinity pure donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h. Cells were washed once with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and nuclei were stained with Hoescht 33342 in PBS-T for 10 min. Cells were again washed twice in PBS-T and were mounted on glass slides using PPD (100 mg ofp-phenylenediamine, 90% glycerol, and 10% PBS) and examined in Leica DM IRBE fluroescence microscope, using Hamamatsu C4742–95 camera and C4742–95 Twain Interface software. Acyl-CoA thioesterase activity was measured spectrophotometrically at 412 nm with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB). The medium contained 200 mm potassium chloride, 10 mm Hepes, and 0.05 mm DTNB, pH 7.4. An E412 = 13,600 m−1 cm−1 was used to calculate the activity. Since PTE-2 thioesterase activity was inhibited at substrate concentrations higher than 5–10 μm with acyl-CoAs longer than C10, BSA was added to a molar ratio of BSA/acyl-CoA of 1:4.5. The effect of CoASH, DTNB, and p-chloromercuribenzoic acid on enzyme activity was measured at 232 nm in phosphate buffered saline. The enzyme kinetics were calculated using Sigma Plot enzyme kinetics program. Livers from wild-type and PPARα-null mice were homogenized as described previously (30Prydz K. Kase B.F. Björkhem I. Pedersen J.I. J. Lipid Res. 1986; 27: 622-628Google Scholar), and bile acid-CoA thioesterase activity was measured as described in Ref. 19Solaas K. Ulvestad A. Söreide O. Kase B.F. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1154-1162Google Scholar. Livers from untreated wild-type mice were fractionated as described (19Solaas K. Ulvestad A. Söreide O. Kase B.F. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1154-1162Google Scholar). The peroxisome-enriched fraction was further fractionated using a 15–45% Optiprep gradient to obtain highly purified peroxisomes. Protein concentrations were determined according to Bradford (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). The possible interference of PTE-2 on peroxisomal BAAT activity was tested by addition of recombinant PTE-2 to incubations for BAAT activity. The reaction mixture contained the following: 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 25 μm [24-14C]chenodeoxycholoyl-CoA, 20 mm taurine, 60 μg BSA, 2.27 μg of mouse liver peroxisomal protein, and 0.6 μg of purified recombinant PTE-2 in a total volume of 150 μl. Control samples were as above, but with inclusion of an equal volume HiTrapTM elution buffer (500 mm imidazole, 0.5 m sodium chloride, and 20 mm phosphate, pH 7.4) instead of PTE-2 protein. Following a 10-min preincubation at 37 °C, the reaction was started by addition of [24-14C]chenodeoxycholoyl-CoA and allowed to proceed for 1 h. The reaction was terminated by addition of 45 μl of 1m KOH. After 30-min hydrolysis at 70 °C, the mixture was acidified using HCl and applied to a Sep-Pak C18-cartridge. The radioactive compounds were eluted with 2-propanol and methanol and analyzed by HPLC using a Beckman ODS 5 μ (4.6 mm × 25 cm) column with 20% 30 mm trifluoroacetic acid (adjusted to pH 2.9 with triethylamine) in methanol as mobile phase. The eluents were fractionated and assayed for 14C radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. The cDNA isolated for PTE-2 encodes a protein of 320 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of 35,886 Da. Alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence for PTE-2 to the homologues in human (26Jones J.M. Nau K. Geraghty M.T. Erdmann R. Gould S.J. J. Biol.

The mouse and human sequences show 85% sequence identity, the mouse and E. coli enzymes show 40% identity at amino acid level, while the yeast and mouse enzymes show 26% sequence identity. The amino acids elucidated to be involved in the active site catalytic triad (33Li J. Derewenda U. Dauter Z. Smith S. Derewenda Z.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 555-559Google Scholar), Asp-233 (D), Ser-255 (S), and Gln-305 (Q) are conserved between species, except for substitution of a threonine for serine in the E. colienzyme. However this substitution should not alter the catalytic site capacity in view of the fact that both amino acids are polar. Using bioinformatic techniques, we also identified the gene for human PTE-2. The gene was identified on human chromosome 20q12-q13 and comprised 6 exons, spaced by 5 introns, covering ∼15.5-kb genomic DNA (Fig. 2). The 5′ splice donor sites and 3′ splice acceptor sites conformed to recognized exon/intron consensus sequences. Sequence analysis of the 5′-flanking region of the human PTE-2 identified a putative direct repeat 1 element of GGGTCAaAGGTCA, at −438 upstream of the ATG start methionine. The mouse PTE-2 contains a well characterized consensus peroxisomal Type 1 targeting signal of -SKL (serine, lysine, leucine) at its C-terminal end, which has been shown to target proteins to peroxisomes (34Gould S.J. Keller G.A. Hosken N. Wilkinson J. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1657-1664Google Scholar). Previously, human PTE-2 has been shown to be localized in peroxisomes (26Jones J.M. Nau K. Geraghty M.T. Erdmann R. Gould S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9216-9223Google Scholar, 35Cohen G.B. Rangan V.S. Chen B.K. Smith S. Baltimore D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23097-23105Google Scholar), and to test whether mouse PTE-2 is peroxisomal, we cloned PTE-2 in-frame with GFP, which leaves the C-terminal -SKL sequence accessible. We transfected this vector into both control fibroblasts and fibroblasts from a Zellweger patient, which are unable to import peroxisomal matrix proteins. Using immunofluorescence microscopy for GFP detection, mPTE-2 showed a punctate pattern of expression in control fibroblasts, indicative of a peroxisomal localization (Fig.3A). This localization was confirmed with a Tritc-labeled fluorescent secondary antibody to GFP (Fig. 3B). However, in Zellweger fibroblasts, transfection of mPTE-2 resulted in a diffuse GFP expression (Fig. 3D). The transfection of the Zellweger cells was confirmed using a Tritc-labeled fluorescent secondary antibody to GFP, which identified the transfected cells (Fig. 3E). Phase contrast microscopy is also shown in both cases (Fig. 3, C and F) as a control, indicating other untransfected cells. The strong staining present in the nucleus is Hoescht staining.

https://openalex.org/W2149678096,"Dimerization of some G protein-coupled receptors has recently been demonstrated, but how widespread this phenomenon might be and its functional implications are not yet clear. We have utilized biophysical and biochemical techniques to evaluate whether the type A cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor can form oligomeric complexes in the plasma membrane and the impact of ligand binding and signaling on such complexes. We investigated the possibility of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) between receptor constructs that included carboxyl-terminal tags of Renilla luciferase or yellow fluorescent protein. Indeed, co-expression of these constructs in COS cells resulted in the constitutive presence of a significant BRET signal above that in a series of controls, with this signal reduced by co-expression of competing non-tagged CCK receptors. The presence of an oligomeric complex of CCK receptor molecules was confirmed in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Occupation of CCK receptors with agonist ligands (CCK or gastrin-4) resulted in the rapid reduction in BRET signal in contrast to the enhancement of such a signal reported after agonist occupation of the β2-adrenergic receptor. These effects on CCK receptor oligomerization were concentration-dependent, correlating with the potencies of the agonists. A smaller effect was observed for a partial agonist, and no effect was observed for antagonist occupation of this receptor. Agonist-induced reduction in BRET signal was also observed for pairs of CCK receptors with a donor-acceptor pair situated in other positions within the receptor. Manipulation of the phosphorylation state of CCK receptor using protein kinase C activation with phorbol ester or inhibition with staurosporine had no effect on the basal level or agonist effect on CCK receptor oligomerization. This provides the first evidence for CCK receptor oligomerization in living cells, with insights that the active conformation of this receptor dissociates these complexes in a phosphorylation-independent manner.

These have generally been assumed to initiate their signaling cascades upon agonist stimulation by interaction of a monomeric receptor molecule with a heterotrimeric G protein as a ternary complex (1De Lean A.

However, increasing evidence suggests that at least some of these heptahelical membrane proteins can form dimers or oligomers in the plasma membrane under certain circumstances (3Maggio R. Vogel Z.

The majority of such reports involve the biochemical or immunological demonstration of complexes migrating on a gel in a position too large to represent single receptors, often with demonstration of multiple epitope-tagged forms of the receptor in the complex. Such studies have been criticized for the possibility that the observed aggregation could represent an artifact of the solubilization or of handling concentrated preparations of very hydrophobic molecules. This led to the recent application of the biophysical technique of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)1 between G protein-coupled receptors expressed in living cells (8Angers S.

In this approach, molecular approximation could be established by the transfer of energy from one tagged receptor molecule to another. Indeed, this has now confirmed the presence of oligomeric complexes of a series of distinct G protein-coupled receptors (8Angers S. Salahpour A. Joly E. Hilairet S. Chelsky D. Dennis M. Bouvier M.

Of interest, the published BRET studies have also demonstrated that such complexes have been stabilized or quantitatively increased in response to treatment with agonists. This is in contrast with the earlier large series of co-immunoprecipitation and Western blotting studies in which agonist treatment has been shown to variably increase, decrease, or have no effect on the oligomeric complexes (6Hebert T.E.

This emphasizes the need to extend the application of the more physiologic and biologically informative BRET studies to a broader group of receptors in this large and diverse superfamily. The cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor is a class I G protein-coupled receptor that binds and responds to a peptide hormone having a relatively small and focused pharmacophoric domain (14Ondetti M.A. Rubin B. Engel S.L. Pluscec J. Sheehan J.T. Am. J. Dig. Dis. 1970; 15: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). It mediates numerous actions that affect nutrient homeostasis, including the physiologic regulation of gall bladder contraction, pancreatic exocrine secretion, gastric emptying, bowel motility, and even the induction of post-cibal satiety (15Mutt V. Glass G.B.J. Gastrointestinal Hormones. Raven Press, New York1980: 169-205Google Scholar). In recent work from our laboratory using a novel probe with dual photolabile residues that simultaneously establishes covalent cross-links with both poles of the CCK receptor (16Hadac E.M. Ji Z.S. Pinon D.I. Henne R.M. Lybrand T.P. Miller L.J. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 2105-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that an active complex consists of a single CCK molecule interacting with a single receptor molecule. This work ruled out crossed-domain dimerization as a theme for normal function of this receptor. However, it did not rule out such a molecular mechanism for “rescue” of a dysfunctional receptor variant or the possibility of association of independently functional receptor molecules through external faces of intact helical bundles. BRET should be an ideal approach to investigating the latter possibility. Using the BRET approach, it was indeed possible to demonstrate the association of CCK receptor molecules in the plasma membrane of living cells. This was a constitutive phenomenon, occurring in the absence of ligand exposure or occupation. It was further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of differentially epitope-tagged receptor constructs. Of particular note, such complexes were apparently dissociated by agonist binding, with the BRET signal reduced in a concentration-dependent manner. The potency and affinity of agonists correlated with their ability to have this effect, with a partial agonist having less effect and an antagonist having no effect. Similar concentration-dependent reduction in the BRET signal was observed for pairs of CCK receptor constructs in which donor and acceptor were positioned quite differently from these studies, including pairs of receptor constructs with donor and acceptor on opposite sides of the plasma membrane and in distinct regions of the carboxyl-terminal tail. Manipulation of the phosphorylation status of the CCK receptor, however, had no effect on the oligomerization. The only currently recognized correlate with the dissociation of such complexes is the active conformation of this receptor, raising the possibility that CCK receptor oligomers play a regulatory rather than a signaling function. The rat type A CCK receptor and human secretin receptor cDNA constructs in pcDNA3 were prepared as we have described (17Hadac E.M. Ghanekar D.V. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Dougherty R.W. Miller L.J. Pancreas. 1996; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18Dong M. Asmann Y.W. Zang M.W. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26032-26039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). CCK receptor constructs having an epitope tag (influenza hemagglutinin (HA) or FLAG) at its amino terminus were prepared using the QuikChangeTMSite-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). CCK and secretin receptor constructs having Renilla luciferase (Rlu) or yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fused at the carboxyl-terminal ends of the respective receptors were also prepared. For this, the same mutagenesis method was used to insert an Xho I site just before the receptor stop codon. The Rlu and YFP constructs were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using templates representing pRL-CMV-Rlu (Promega) or pEYFP-N1 (Invitrogen), respectively. The oligonucleotide primers were designed as follows; for the Rlu construct, sense primer, 5′-GCTACTCGAG ATGACTTCGAAAGTTTATGA TCC-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-CGATTCTAGA TTATTGTTCATTTTTGAGAA CTCG-3′; for the YFP construct, sense primer, 5′-GCTACTCGAG ATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGA GC-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-GCATTCTAGA TTACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCC-3′. The amplified products were ligated in-frame intoXho I/Xba I sites of the receptor-bearing constructs. Additional CCK receptor constructs were prepared involving the insertion of the Rlu or YFP moieties at the amino terminus or within the carboxyl-terminal tail domain closer to the lipid bilayer (YFP-CCKR, CCKR-(1–408)-Rlu, and CCKR-(1–408)-YFP, respectively). All sequences were verified by direct DNA sequencing. A fusion construct encoding for both Rluc and YFP in series as a soluble protein with a nine-amino acid spacer was prepared withAge I/Xba I by incorporation of YFP from pEYFP-N1 in place of the green fluorescent protein component of the control fusion construct, pBRET+, purchased from Packard Bioscience. The β2-adrenergic receptor-Rlu and β2-adrenergic receptor-YFP constructs, used as additional controls in the current report, were generously provided by Dr. Michel Bouvier (8Angers S. Salahpour A. Joly E. Hilairet S. Chelsky D. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3684-3689PubMed Google Scholar). COS-1 cells, previously established to not express any CCK receptors (19Ulrich C.D. Ferber I. Holicky E. Hadac E.M. Buell G. Miller L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), were plated in 100-mm tissue culture plates at 0.75 × 106cells/plate in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% fetal clone II (Hyclone) 20 h before transfection. Transfection was performed after the DEAE-dextran method with 3 μg of each cDNA construct used per plate (19Ulrich C.D. Ferber I. Holicky E. Hadac E.M. Buell G. Miller L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The level of CCK receptor expression was monitored by radioligand binding assay and Western blot analysis. Non-receptor-bearing controls utilized empty vector or vector-containing cytosolic forms of Rlu, YFP, or the Rlu-YFP fusion construct in analogous transfections. CCK receptor binding studies were performed in enriched plasma membranes prepared from receptor-bearing COS cells as we have described (13Zeng F.Y. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19487-19497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 20Ding X.Q. Dolu V. Hadac E.M. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Lybrand T.P. Miller L.J. J. Biol.

Membranes containing ∼10 μg of protein were incubated with a constant amount of the CCK-like radioligand, 125I-labeledd-Tyr-Gly-[(norleucine 28 and 31)CCK-26–33] (1–5 pm), in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled CCK (ranging from 0 to 0.1 μm). Incubations were performed for 60 min at 25 °C in Krebs-Ringer-HEPES medium containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 104 mm NaCl, 5 mmKCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2 mmCaCl2, 1 mm KH2PO4, 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Bound and free radioligand were separated using a Skatron cell harvester (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) using receptor-binding filtermats. Bound radioligand was quantified in a γ spectrometer, with nonspecific binding determined in the presence of 0.1 μmcompeting unlabeled CCK, representing less than 15% of total binding. Data were analyzed using the nonlinear least squares curve-fitting program of Munson and Rodbard, LIGAND (21Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7759) Google Scholar), incorporating the established K d for the binding of this radioligand, 0.2 nm (13Zeng F.Y. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19487-19497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Saturable binding data were graphed using Prism software (GraphPad software, San Diego, CA). Intracellular calcium responses to CCK were determined in receptor-bearing COS cells using a well characterized assay. Cells were lifted with non-enzymatic cell dissociation solution (C-5914, Sigma) and loaded with 5 μm Fura-2AM in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium at 37 °C for 20 min followed by washing with Krebs-Ringer-HEPES medium. In each assay, approximately a half-million cells were stimulated with varied concentrations of CCK at 37 °C, with fluorescence quantified in a PerkinElmer LS50B spectrofluorometer (Norway, CT). Excitation was performed at 340 and 380 nm, and emissions were determined at 520 nm, with calcium concentration calculated from the ratios (22Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The peaks in intracellular calcium concentration were utilized to determine the concentration dependence of the biological responses. Bioluminescence and fluorescence measurements were performed with approximately one million transfected COS cells in a 1-ml cuvette using a SPEX Fluorolog spectrofluorometer (SPEX Industries, Edison, NJ). For the bioluminescence assay, the cell-permeant substrate ofRenilla luciferase, coelenterazine (Packard Bioscience), was added to the cell suspension to yield a final concentration of 5 μm. The bioluminescence emission was immediately monitored in the spectrum between 400 and 600 nm. To assay YFP fluorescence, cells were excited at 480 nm, and emission was scanned from 500 to 580 nm. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the COS cells were detached using the non-enzymatic cell dissociation solution and washed with Krebs-Ringer-HEPES medium. Cells were then resuspended in the same medium and treated with the appropriate concentrations of hormones at 37 °C for 5 min or for the noted period of time. Subsequently, cells expressing Rlu-YFP fusion protein or cells expressing both tagged CCK receptor constructs were transferred into the cuvette, coelenterazine was added, and data reflecting light emitted between 400 and 600 nm was acquired. Consistent with previous work (8Angers S. Salahpour A. Joly E. Hilairet S. Chelsky D. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3684-3689PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kroeger K.M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 12736-12743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), the BRET ratio was defined as [(emission at 510–590) − (emission at 440–500) × Cf]/(emission at 440–500), where Cf corresponds to (emission at 510–590)/(emission at 440–500) for the CCKR-Rlu construct expressed alone in analogous experiments. Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed as previously reported (23Cheng Z.J. Zhao J. Sun Y. Hu W. Wu Y.L. Cen B. Wu G.X. Pei G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2479-2485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In brief, receptor-bearing COS cells were incubated with 5 μm disuccinimidyl suberate or buffer control at 4 °C for 60 min. They were then lysed in 0.8 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer containing 0.5% digitonin, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors on ice for 60 min. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were withdrawn and incubated with anti-HA antibody (clone 12CA5, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and protein A-Sepharose (Bio-Rad) on ice for 4 h. After washing with immunoprecipitation buffer, the immune complexes retained on beads were eluted using 30 μl of 1 mm HA peptide in immunoprecipitation buffer. The proteins in the eluate were separated by electrophoresis on a 4–12% gradient NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen) and electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (23Cheng Z.J. Zhao J. Sun Y. Hu W. Wu Y.L. Cen B. Wu G.X. Pei G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2479-2485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The presence of FLAG-CCK receptor on the Western blot was detected using peroxidase-conjugated anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) as described (23Cheng Z.J. Zhao J. Sun Y. Hu W. Wu Y.L. Cen B. Wu G.X. Pei G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2479-2485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). For an additional control, the anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) was utilized in both the immunoprecipitation and Western blot stages of the experiment. Data were analyzed using Student'st test for comparison of independent samples. Two distinct tagged CCK receptor constructs were prepared, representing wild type receptor fused in-frame with Rlu or YFP at the carboxyl terminus of the receptor. Both cDNA constructs had their sequences verified by direct sequence analysis. Both receptors were effectively synthesized in COS cells, where they trafficked normally to the cell surface, as demonstrated by fluorescent ligand microscopy, and where they bound a membrane-impermeant CCK analogue. CCK bound specifically and saturably with high affinity (Fig.1, top). Values forK i represented 0.5 ± 0.06 nm for the Rlu-tagged receptor, 0.4 ± 0.04 nm for the YFP-tagged receptor, and 0.1 ± 0.01 nm for wild type CCK receptor. Although the affinities for each of the tagged CCK receptor constructs were statistically different from that of wild type receptor (p < 0.05), these affinities were quantitatively very similar. Receptor densities after transfection with similar amounts of each receptor cDNA construct were 1.3 ± 0.2 pmol/mg of membrane protein for the wild type CCK receptor, 0.5 ± 0.1 pmol/mg of membrane protein for the CCKR-Rlu construct, and 0.6 ± 0.2 pmol/mg of membrane protein for the CCKR-YFP construct. The CCK receptor is normally coupled with Gq and elicits a phospholipase C and intracellular calcium response (24Heim H.K. Elhoft A. Wittstock H. Sewing K.F. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1995; 46: 489-501PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, CCK elicited normal intracellular calcium responses at both tagged receptor constructs (Fig. 1, bottom). EC50 values for CCK-stimulated intracellular calcium responses represented 0.8 ± 0.09 nm for the Rlu-tagged receptor, 0.5 ± 0.03 nm for the YFP-tagged receptor, and 0.3 ± 0.03 nm for the wild type CCK receptor. No significant differences were observed for the maximal intracellular calcium responses between either of the tagged CCK receptor constructs and wild type CCK receptor (p > 0.05). Thus, both tagged CCK receptors were fully functional in the cell system studied. A number of controls was performed to ensure that the bioluminescent and fluorescent properties of the receptor constructs were appropriate and that BRET could be detected under ideal conditions using the SPEX Fluorolog spectrofluorometer. The top panel of Fig.2 shows the emission spectra measured for controls expressed as cytosolic proteins, representing Rlu, YFP, and the fusion Rlu-YFP construct. The Rlu curve represents the bioluminescence after exposure to the cell-permeant substrate, coelenterazine. This had a peak in the 475–480 nm range. The YFP curve represents the emission observed after excitation at 480 nm. Emission was significant between 500 and 580 nm. When the soluble fusion construct was exposed to coelenterazine, the Rlu component emitted light of the expected wavelength and that, in turn, was able to excite the YFP component to emit light with the expected spectral properties. The middle panel of Fig. 2 shows analogous data for COS cells expressing each of the tagged CCK receptor constructs individually or simultaneously. The spectral properties of each were analogous to those of the soluble tags, and a small, but consistent BRET signal was observed for the co-expression system. In thebottom panel of Fig. 2, the BRET ratio was quantified for key conditions. No BRET was observed for the cells expressing only the Rlu-tagged CCK receptor. Co-expression of the two tagged receptors yielded a BRET ratio that was ∼15% that observed for the soluble fusion construct. Based on theoretical considerations related to the bioluminescence and fluorescence properties of the Rlu/YFP pair, a BRET signal would be expected only when these tags are within 50–80 Å of each other, with the strength of the signal related to their spatial approximation and the geometry of the interaction. The small BRET signal for the co-expressed CCK receptors relative to that of the fusion protein may reflect a number of issues. The most obvious contribution comes from the presumed random interaction of the Rlu-tagged receptor molecules and the YFP-tagged receptor molecules, with some homodimers of each, as well as the heterodimer that produces a BRET signal. Further reduction in BRET signal may reflect a subset of non-dimerized (or oligomerized) receptors, distance between the tagged receptor molecules greater than that in the fusion control pair, or geometry less optimal than that in the control pair. Data from another series of control experiments are shown in Fig.3. The first five bars represent the negative controls of expression of only a single tagged CCK receptor with the opposite tag present as a cytosolic protein or attached to a structurally distinct G protein-coupled receptor, the secretin receptor. The first bar shows that absence of YFP in the system was incompatible with any BRET signal. Each of the next four bars shows that similar minimal BRET signals (BRET ratio ∼0.01) were observed for Rlu/YFP pairs when only one was attached to a CCK receptor. The last three bars represent data from experiments in which both tagged CCK receptors were co-expressed in the absence of competitor (BRET ratio ∼0.07) or in the presence of possible competing untagged CCK or secretin receptors. This was true even given the higher level of secretin receptor expression (3.2 pmol/mg of membrane protein) than CCK receptor expression (1.3 pmol/mg of membrane protein). Only the untagged CCK receptors were shown to reduce the BRET signal. As an additional control, no significant BRET signal was observed between the structurally dissimilar tagged CCK receptors and β2-adrenergic receptors (data not shown). As confirmation that the BRET signal from the pair of tagged CCK receptors represented a true physical association, co-immunoprecipitation was attempted. For this, different tagged receptors to which high quality and specific antibodies were available were utilized. These represented wild type receptors fused with HA or FLAG peptide tags. In this series of experiments, as shown in Fig.4, lanes 1–6, the anti-HA antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation and the anti-FLAG antibodies were used for detection in the Western blot. Included are representative blots from COS cells expressing the receptor constructs individually or together as well as a control in which the two receptor constructs were expressed in separate cells and the cells were mixed before solubilization and immunoprecipitation. Only the co-expression of the tagged CCK receptors on the same cells yielded a signal. This signal was markedly enhanced by the application of bifunctional chemical cross-linking of the cells with disuccinimidyl suberate before solubilization. This supports the absence of covalent bonding to establish the receptor complex as well as the sensitivity of this complex to disruption by sodium dodecyl sulfate. The positive signal on the blot was in the region expected for a dimer of CCK receptor molecules that individually run at ∼90 kDa, although the broad nature of the band makes this indeterminate. Co-expression of FLAG-tagged CCK receptor with HA-tagged secretin receptor also failed to produce a signal in this assay. Fig. 4, lanes 7–8, provides controls in which the same antibody was used in immunoprecipitation and Western blot, with the specificity of this antibody demonstrated. Additional control experiments were performed to be certain that the apparent receptor dimers were not an artifact of the particular solubilization conditions utilized (data not shown). These included the comparison of three different solubilization buffers (radioimmune precipitation buffer (25Jordan B.A. Devi L.A.

Agonist occupation of the β2-adrenergic receptor has been reported to increase the state of dimerization (or oligomerization) of that receptor using the same BRET techniques reported in the current work (8Angers S.

Indeed, as shown in the top panel of Fig.5, we were able to reproduce that observation using the same β2-adrenergic receptor constructs and receptor agonist (1 μm isoproterenol) as were utilized in that work, with the BRET ratio in the same order of magnitude pre"

Among the most common is the core 1 disaccharide structure consisting of Galβ1→3GalNAcα1→Ser/Thr, which is also the precursor for many extended O-glycan structures. The key enzyme for biosynthesis of core 1 O-glycan from the precursor GalNAc-α-Ser/Thr is UDP-Gal:GalNAc-α-Ser/Thr β3-galactosyltransferase (core1 β3-Gal-T). Core 1 β3-Gal-T activity, which requires Mn2+, was solubilized from rat liver membranes and purified 71,034-fold to apparent homogeneity (>90% purity) in 5.7% yield by ion exchange chromatography on SP-Sepharose, affinity chromatography on immobilized asialo-bovine submaxillary mucin, and gel filtration chromatography on Superose 12. The purified enzyme is free of contaminating glycosyltransferases. Two peaks of core 1 β3-Gal-T activity were identified in the final step on Superose 12. One peak of activity contained protein bands on non-reducing SDS-PAGE of ∼84- and ∼86-kDa disulfide-linked dimers, whereas the second peak of activity contained monomers of ∼43 kDa. Reducing SDS-PAGE of these proteins gave ∼42- and ∼43-kDa monomers. Both the 84/86-kDa dimers and the 42/43-kDa monomers have the same novel N-terminal sequence. The purified enzyme, which is remarkably stable, has an apparent Km for UDP-Gal of 630 μm and an apparent Vmax of 206 μmol/mg/h protein using GalNAcα1-O-phenyl as the acceptor. The reaction product was generated using asialo-bovine submaxillary mucin as an acceptor; treatment withO-glycosidase generated the expected disaccharide Galβ1→3GalNAc. These studies demonstrate that activity of the core 1 β1,3-Gal-T from rat liver is contained within a single, novel, disulfide-bonded, dimeric enzyme.

The addition of O-glycans to proteins is a common post-translational modification on many secreted and membrane-bound glycoproteins (1Berger E.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1455: 255-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 2Van den Steen P. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Opdenakker G. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

Montreuil J.F. Vliegenthart G. Schachter H. Glycoproteins. 29. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1995: 201-261Google Scholar). The mucin-type O-glycans, which contain a core GalNAc in α-glycosidic linkage to Ser or Thr, are synthesized in the Golgi apparatus by the sequential action of glycosyltransferases that transfer individual sugars from nucleotide sugar donors (5Brockhausen I. Kuhns W. Glycoproteins and Human Disease. Chapman Hall, New York1997: 13-31Crossref Google Scholar, 6Brockhausen I. Schachter H. Gabius H.-J. Gabius S. Glycosciences. Chapman and Hall, Weinheim, Germany1997: 79-113Google Scholar). Whereas all mucin-type O-glycans contain the common GalNAcα1-Ser/Thr linkage, at least eight differentO-glycan core structures have been described that differ in the types of sugars and their linkage. Two of the most common mucin-type O-glycans are based on the core 1 and core 2 structures. Core 1 has the disaccharide structure Galβ1→3GalNAcα1→R and core 2 has the trisaccharide structure Galβ1→3(GlcNAcβ1→6)GalNAcα1→R. In addition to serving as an precursor to the core 2 structure, the core 1 can also be modified by sialylation and fucosylation to generate a wide range of other structures (3Brockhausen I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 67-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the unmodified core 1 disaccharide is recognized as a cancer-associated antigen (T- or Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen) (1Berger E.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1455: 255-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In addition, the core 1 O-glycan may be directly extended by addition of GlcNAc to form an extended core 1 structure (7Brockhausen I. Williams D. Matta K.L. Orr J. Schachter H. Can. J. Biochem.

The core 1 disaccharide is synthesized by the action of an enzyme activity designated the core 1 UDP-Gal:GalNAc-α-R β1,3-galactosyltransferase (core 1 β3-Gal-T, EC 2.4.1.122), where R is Ser/Thr through direct transfer to the acceptor α-linked GalNAc. Thus, the core 1 β3-Gal-T may be considered to play a pivotal and decisive role in mucin and glycoprotein biosynthesis. However, although the core 1 β3-Gal-T activity is present in most mammalian tissue, the enzyme has not been purified to homogeneity, and the possible diversity of different enzymes with this activity is unknown (10Brockhausen I.

The core 1O-glycan structure is required for the action of the core 1 β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (core 2 GlcNAc-transferase), which allows synthesis of core 2-basedO-glycans of the sequence Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→6 (Galβ1→3)GalNAcα1→Ser/Thr (6Brockhausen I.

The inability to express the core 1 β3-Gal-T results in expression of truncated O-glycans, such as the unsubstituted GalNAcα1→Ser/Thr (Tn antigen) or the sialylated derivative NeuAcα2→6GalNAcα1→Ser/Thr (sialyl Tn antigen). Expression of the Tn and sialyl-Tn antigens has been associated with tumor progression (17Brockhausen I. Schutzbach J. Kuhns W.

As a step toward the cloning of the gene(s) encoding the core 1 β3-Gal-T, in this paper we describe the ∼71,000-fold purification of core 1 β3-Gal-T from rat liver to apparent homogeneity and the characterization of the purified protein. N-terminal sequencing demonstrates that a single polypeptide was purified that exists as an active monomer and as a disulfide-bonded dimer. This is the first isolation of a core 1 β3-Gal-T. GalNAcα1-O-phenyl, Galβ1,3GalNAc-α-phenyl UDP-Gal, DTT, ATP, UDP, PMSF, benzamidine, leupeptin, pepstatin A, Triton X-100, bovine submaxillary mucin (type I-S), and the disaccharides Galβ1–3GalNAc, Galβ1–4GlcNAc, Galβ1–6GalNAc, Galβ1–6Gal, and Galβ1–3GlcNAc were obtained from Sigma. MES, MOPS, Tris, methanol, 1-butanol, and scintiverse-BD were obtained from Fisher. UDP-[6-3H]Gal (40–60 Ci/mmol) was obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. The BCA protein assay kit and the UltraLinkTM Bio-support Medium were obtained from Pierce. Peptide N-glycosidase F (N-glycanase) andO-glycosidase were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Sep-Pak C18 cartridges was obtained from Waters Associates. Precast SDS-PAGE gels were obtained from Invitrogen/NOVEX. Mixed bed resin AG 501-X8 was obtained from Bio-Rad. The synthetic glycopeptide 4-GP-1 with the sequence Glu-Tyr-Glu-Tyr-Leu-Asp-Tyr-Asp-Phe-Leu-Pro-Glu-(GalNAcα1-O-Thr)-Glu-Pro-Pro-Glu-Met and having the GalNAc-substituted Thr, as indicated, was synthesized as described in Leppänen et al.

Triose (GlcNAcβ1,3Galβ1,4Glc) was prepared by treatment of the tetrasaccharide LNneoT (Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,3Galβ1,4Glc) with jack bean β-galactosidase and subsequent purification of the trisaccharide (triose) from the released galactose by gel filtration on a column (3 × 200 cm) of Bio-Gel P-2 equilibrated in water. The assay for core 1 β3-Gal-T contained 100 mmMES, pH 6.8, 0.2% Triton X-100, 20 mm MnCl2, 1 mm GalNAcα1-O-phenyl, 0.4 mmUDP-[3H]Gal (100,000–150,000 dpm/nmol), 2 mmATP, and 5–25 μl of enzyme in a total volume of 50 μl. Mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 30–60 min and stopped by adding 950 μl of cold H2O. The mixtures were loaded onto 500-mg Sep-Pak C18 cartridges, previously activated with 2 ml of ethanol and equilibrated with 10 ml of water. Following application of the diluted reaction mixture, the columns were washed with 15 ml of water, eluted with 2 ml of 1-butanol, and radioactivity determined by liquid scintillation counting in 10 ml of Scintiverse-BD. A unit of activity is defined as that amount of enzyme transferring 1 nmol of Gal from UDP-Gal to the acceptor GalNAcα1-O-phenyl per h at 37 °C. When the synthetic glycopeptide 4-GP-1 was used as an acceptor, the assays were conducted as above substituting the 4-GP-1 for GalNAcα1-O-phenyl, except that methanol, rather than 1-butanol, was used for elution of product glycopeptides from the Sep-Pak C18 cartridges. Core 2 β6-Gn-T activities were measured in a total volume of 50 μl containing 0.1 m MES (pH 6.5), 0.125% Triton X-100, 10 mm ATP, 0.125 m GlcNAc, 2 mm Galβ1,3GalNAc-α-phenyl, 1 mmUDP-[3H]GlcNAc (10 cpm/pmol), and 20 μl of enzyme sample. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 h, and the product was estimated by Sep-Pak C18 column, as described above for the core 1 β3-Gal-T assay. Core 3 β3-Gn-T activities were measured in a total volume of 50 μl containing 0.1 m MES (pH 6.5), 15 mmMnCl2, 0.2% Triton X-100, 10 mm ATP, 4 mm GalNAc-α-phenyl, 1 mmUDP-[3H]GlcNAc (10 cpm/pmol), and 20 μl of enzyme samples. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 h, and the product was estimated by Sep-Pak C18 column, as described above for the core 1 β3-Gal-T assay. β4-Gal-T activities were measured in a total volume of 50 μl containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 15 mmMnCl2, 0.2% Triton X-100, 10 mm ATP, 5 mm GlcNAcβ1,3Galβ1,4Glc (triose), 0.4 mmUDP-[3H]Gal (20 cpm/pmol), and 20 μl of enzyme samples. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 h, and the product was estimated following chromatography on QAE-Sephadex A-25 (1 ml) column and measurement of the unbound radioactivity. α1,3-Fuc-T activities were measured in a total volume of 50 μl containing 0.1 m MES (pH 6.5), 15 mmMnCl2, 0.2% Triton X-100, 10 mm ATP, 10 mm Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,3Galβ1,4Glc (LNnT), 0.4 mm GDP-[3H]fucose (20 cpm/pmol), and 20 μl of enzyme samples. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 h, and the product was estimated following chromatography on QAE-Sephadex A-25 (1 ml) column and measurement of the unbound radioactivity. α2,6-ST activities were measured in a total volume of 100 μl containing 0.1 m MES (pH 6.5), 5 mm EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, 10 mm ATP, 150 μg of asialo-BSM, 1 mm CMP-[3H]NeuAc (10 cpm/pmol), and 20 μl of enzyme samples. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 h. The reaction mixture was diluted with 400 μl of H2O and 500 μl of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. The mixtures were kept on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 10 min. The pellets were washed with 1 ml of cold 0.01% HCl in acetone 3 times and dried on a speed-vac concentrator. The dried residues were dissolved in 0.5 ml of 0.2 n KOH and mixed with 5 ml of ScintiVerse-BD and counted. Bovine submaxillary mucin (BSM) (100 mg) was dissolved in 20 ml of 0.1 m MOPS and 0.6 m sodium citrate (pH 7.5), and coupled to 0.6 g of UltraLinkTM beads overnight at 4 °C, followed by blocking with 3 methanolamine (1 h, 20 °C). Following washing with 1 mNaCl and equilibration with water, the coupled BSM (∼3 mg/ml) was desialylated by incubation with an equal volume of 2 n HCl at 100 °C for 90 s. The beads were then chilled in ice, neutralized with NaOH, and equilibrated with buffer 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 20 mmMnCl2. Rat liver (500 g) was freshly obtained and washed with cold 150 mm NaCl in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and homogenized with 2,000 ml of 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 0.25 m sucrose containing 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mmPMSF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine, and 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A in a Waring commercial blender. In all steps of the purification, protein was determined by absorbance at 280 nm or by the BCA assay (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was decanted and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The pellets were suspended in 5 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) and 0.25 m sucrose containing 2% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine, and 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A and sonicated for 10 s four times in an ice bath. These sonicated membranes were solubilized on ice for 1 h and then centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 60 min. The supernatant was collected (∼1,000 ml) and the pH was adjusted to 6.5 using 1 m MES. The extracted membrane preparation was applied to a column of SP-Sepharose FF (6 × 20 cm; Amersham Biosciences), previously equilibrated with 25 mm MES (pH 6.5), 0.1% Triton, 5 mmMnCl2, containing 1 mm PMSF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine, and 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A. By using the same buffer, the column was washed, and the core 1 β3-Gal-T was eluted in one step by application of 1 mNaCl in equilibrating buffer. The eluate from the SP-Sepharose column was dialyzed and concentrated down to 50 ml using an Omicon concentrator. The concentrated sample was loaded onto a column of asialo-BSM-UltralinkTM (1.2 × 5 cm) equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 0.01% Triton X-100, 20 mm MnCl2, 150 mm NaCl, containing 1 mm PMSF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine, and 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A. After washing the column in the same buffer, the core 1 β3-Gal-T was eluted with 1 m NaCl in the buffer lacking Mn2+. Fractions (1 ml) were collected, and activity of core 1 β3-Gal-T was assayed. Fractions containing the core 1 β3-Gal-T activity were pooled. The core 1 β3-Gal-T from Asialo-BSM UltraLinkTM was concentrated down to 200 μl, using Centriprep 30 and Centricon 30 (Omicon), and loaded on Superose 12 (1.0 × 35 cm; Amersham Biosciences), which was pre-equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 0.005% Triton X-100, and 150 mm NaCl. Core 1 β3-Gal-T was eluted with the same buffer, and fractions (0.25 ml) were collected and assayed for activity. Two peaks of activity were recovered from the Superose 12 step, and those fractions containing peak levels of activity were pooled. This pooled material represented the purified core 1 β3-Gal-T. SDS-PAGE was performed in Tris glycine buffer on precast acrylamide gradient gels (NOVEX) as described by the manufacturer. Proteins were visualized by silver staining (27Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3733) Google Scholar). Gels were scanned on a UMAX Astra 2100U Scanner. Stained protein bands were identified and quantified by scanning using the NIH Image program (rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/). To effect desialylation, bovine submaxillary mucin (BSM) (5 mg) was dissolved in 0.80 ml of 1 n HCl and incubated at 100 °C for 90 s and then cooled in ice. The reaction mixture was neutralized with NaOH and desalted on a G-25 Sephadex, PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with water. The void volume was collected and concentrated to 1 ml in a Centriprep-30 and designated asialo-BSM. This acceptor was used directly for the core 1 β3-Gal-T reaction. The reaction mixture in 100 μl total volume contained asialo-BSM (160 μg), UDP-[3H]Gal (0.4 mm) (100,000 dpm total), Triton X-100 (0.2%), ATP (2 mm), MnCl2 (20 mm), and purified core 1 β3-Gal-T (20 units of activity). The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h and then applied to a column of Sephadex G-25 (0.5 × 6 cm; Superfine; Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with water. Fractions (∼100 μl) were collected and pooled, and the first radioactive peak was concentrated to 50 μl. The product using asialo-BSM as an acceptor was treated withO-glycosidase in a total reaction volume of 100 μl by adding 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and O-glycosidase (∼12.5 milliunits) and a drop of toluene. This reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. The whole sample was then applied to a column of Sephadex G-25 (Superfine) and eluted with H2O. Fractions (100 μl) were collected, and the radioactive peak was pooled and passed through 1-ml mixed bed resin (Bio-Rad), and the column was washed with 5 ml of H2O. The product was collected and dried in vacuo. The dried core 1 β3-Gal-T product was dissolved in 25 μl of H2O and mixed with 15 μl containing 2.5 μl of 1 mg/ml authentic Galβ1–3GalNAc standard. The mixed sample was analyzed on a Dionex HPAEC (Dionex Corp.) equipped with a PA-1 column (4 × 250 mm) and pulsed amperometric detector. Fractions (0.33 ml) were collected, and the elution of the radioactive product was monitored by liquid scintillation counting. The elution positions of the unlabeled standards Galβ1–3GalNAc, Galβ1–4GlcNAc, Galβ1–6GalNAc, Galβ1–6Gal, and Galβ1–3GlcNAc was directly determined for each individual glycan using pulsed amperometric detection. Purified core 1 β3-Gal-T (∼10 μg) was analyzed on a 4–12% SDS-PAGE (NOVEX) under non-reducing conditions and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). After staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, the top two bands of 84 and 86 kDa (Fig. 3), respectively, were excised and the N-terminal sequence determined by Edman degradation (Applied Biosystems, Inc. protein sequencer). Similarly, the protein band at 42/43 kDa in non-reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3) was excised and the N-terminal sequence determined by Edman degradation. To obtain internal peptide sequence, purified enzyme (∼5 μg) was resolved by SDS-PAGE (4–12%) under non-reducing conditions, and the top two bands of 84/86 kDa were excised from the gel. These proteins were digested in situ with trypsin, and tryptic peptides were isolated by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The size of one purified peptide was determined by matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) and confirmed by direct sequencing by Edman degradation at the Yale University Protein Sequencing Facility. Rat liver was chosen as a tissue source for the purification of core 1 β3-Gal-T, because our preliminary experiments demonstrated that rat liver homogenates contain relatively high core 1 β3-Gal-T activity compared with other organs. Core 1 β3-Gal-T was assayed by monitoring the transfer of [3H]Gal from UDP-[3H]Gal to the synthetic acceptor GalNAcα1-O-phenyl. The product was isolated by Sep-Pac chromatography by exploiting the hydrophobicity of the acceptor and product. Core 1 β3-Gal-T activity in the solubilized rat liver membrane fraction was linear with respect to added protein from 50 to 400 μg (Fig. 1A). Activity was also linear with respect to time between 20 and 90 min (Fig.1B). The core 1 β3-Gal-T activity demonstrated an absolute requirement for divalent cation, with optimal activity being observed with 10 mm Mn2+ (Fig. 1C). To investigate whether rat liver core 1 β3-Gal-T was membrane-associated, the post-nuclear supernatant fraction of rat liver homogenates was centrifuged at 106,000 × g for 60 min. Greater than 97% of the enzyme activity was pelleted under these conditions (data not shown). Detergent (2% Triton X-100), but not 1m NaCl, caused the quantitative release of core 1 β3-Gal-T activity from the membrane into the 106,000 ×g supernatant, indicating the enzyme is membrane-associated. The protocol developed for purification of the core 1 β3-Gal-T from rat liver resulted in a 71,034-fold purification, as summarized in Table I and as discussed below.Table IRat liver core 1 β3-galactosyltransferase purificationStepProtein1-aProtein was determined by the BCA protein assay method (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol.Core 1 β3 Gal-T activity1-bA unit of activity is defined as that amount of enzyme transferring 1 nmol of Gal from UDP-Gal to the acceptor GalNAcα1-O-phenyl per h at 37 °C.VolumeConcentrationTotalYieldPurificationmlmg/mlmgunits/mlunits/mgtotal units%-fold1.

Open table in a new tab Results are shown for the preparation of enzyme from 500 g of freshly prepared rat liver. Details of the purification are provided in the Experimental Procedures and Results sections. Rat livers were homogenized, and the homogenate was centrifuged to obtain a post-nuclear supernatant. The membranes in the post-nuclear supernatant were collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min, and the supernatant was decanted and discarded. This membrane preparation was solubilized in buffer containing 2.0% Triton X-100. Enzyme assays demonstrated that this solubilized membrane preparation contained core 1 β3-Gal-T activity at 9.8 nmol/h/mg protein, and <10% of the activity remained in the unsolubilized material. The solubilized membrane proteins from step 2 were chromatographed on a column of the anion exchanger SP-Sepharose. Elution of bound proteins was carried out in a single step by application of 1 m NaCl in buffer (data not shown). With this step the core 1 β3-Gal-T was purified ∼3–4-fold with 31.3% recovery. Although the degree of purification and recovery was not high, this procedure was necessary to separate contaminating proteins, including some glycosidases, from the core 1 β3-Gal-T activity. Bovine submaxillary mucin contains a variety of short core 1 type O-glycans including sialyl Tn (28Tsuji T. Osawa T. Carbohydr. Res. 1986; 151: 391-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Desialylation exposes the Tn antigen, thus making asialo-BSM an excellent acceptor substrate for the core 1 β3-Gal-T. During the course of trying different affinity approaches, we discovered that core 1 β3-Gal-T bound tightly to a column of asialo-BSM-UltralinkTM in the presence of Mn2+. The enzyme was eluted as a broad peak from this column with using buffer containing 1 m NaCl and lacking Mn2+(Fig. 2A). This affinity step was the most important step for purification, resulting in an increase of specific activity to 162,333 from 33.8 nmol/hr/mg with a 4,802-fold purification. The core 1 β3-Gal-T from the asialo-BSM affinity column was then further purified by gel filtration chromatography on Superose 12 (Fig. 2B). Core 1 β3-Gal-T was recovered in a broad peak with ∼65% recovery from this column. This 5-step protocol resulted in a 71,034-fold purification of the core 1 β3-Gal-T from rat liver homogenates, with a 5.7% yield and a total of 41 μg of total protein at ∼15 μg/ml (Table I). The core 1 β3-Gal-T activity from Superose 12 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions, and the protein was detected by silver staining (Fig. 2C). The activity of the core 1 β3-Gal-T from the Superose 12 column was associated with three major protein bands of ∼84 and 86 kDa (fractions 32–40) and ∼43 kDa (e.g. fraction 50), which were also apparent in the starting material (Fig. 2C). In multiple analyses we found that activity of core 1 β3-Gal-T consistently correlated with elution of these major protein peaks from Superose 12 (Fig. 2, Band C). The fractions 32–40 and 49–51 from the Superose 12 column were pooled, and these represent the purified rat liver core 1 β3-Gal-T. The analysis of the purity of this pooled material by SDS-PAGE is below. These data suggested that the core 1 β3-Gal-T occurs as an ∼43-kDa monomer and an 84/86-kDa dimer. To define whether the 84/86 kDa was a disulfide-bonded dimer of the ∼43-kDa monomers, the purified core 1 β3-Gal-T was analyzed in reducing versus non-reducing SDS-PAGE. The results in Fig. 3(top) show that in non-reducing SDS-PAGE the major material is a doublet of 84/86 kDa with minor bands at 42/43 kDa. A scan of the material in the non-reduced purified core 1 β3-Gal-T is shown in Fig.3 (bottom) and reveals that >90% of detectable protein is contained within the doublet of"

Clostridium thermocellum xylanase 11A is a modular enzyme that contains a CBM from family 6 (CBM6), for which no structural data are available. We have determined the crystal structure of this module to a resolution of 2.1 Å. The protein is a β-sandwich that contains two potential ligand-binding clefts designated cleft A and B. The CBM interacts primarily with xylan, and NMR spectroscopy coupled with site-directed mutagenesis identified cleft A, containing Trp-92, Tyr-34, and Asn-120, as the ligand-binding site. The overall fold of CBM6 is similar to proteins in CBM families 4 and 22, although surprisingly the ligand-binding site in CBM4 and CBM22 is equivalent to cleft B in CBM6. These structural data define a superfamily of CBMs, comprising CBM4, CBM6, and CBM22, and demonstrate that, although CBMs have evolved from a relatively small number of ancestors, the structural elements involved in ligand recognition have been assembled at different locations on the ancestral scaffold.

Warren R.A.J. Gilkes N.R. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1995; 37: 1-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). These carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs)1 maximize catalytic activity by mediating prolonged and intimate contact between the substrate and the enzyme (2Bolam D.N. Ciruela A. McQueen-Mason S.

The ligand specificity of CBMs generally reflects the target substrate of the catalytic module of the enzyme. Thus, cellulose, xylan, mannan, and β-1,3-glucan-binding CBMs are located in cellulases (3Xu G.-Y. Ong E. Gilkes N.R. Kilburn D.G. Muhandiram D.R. Harris-Brandts M. Carver J.P. Kay L.E. Harvey T.S.

J. 2001; 356: 791-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), respectively, although it should be emphasized that numerous enzymes that do not cleave cellulose contain CBMs that recognize the crystalline form of this polysaccharide (8Ferreira L.M.A. Durrant A.J.

Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). CBMs have been classified into more than 28 families based on primary structure similarity (afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/∼pedro/CAZY/cbm.html; see Ref.10Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Svensson B. Henrissat B. Recent Advances in Carbohydrate Engineering. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1999: 3-12Google Scholar). Ligand specificity can vary both between and within families, demonstrating considerable diversity in polysaccharide recognition in these protein modules. For example, the CBM2 family contains proteins that bind to xylan and crystalline cellulose (2Bolam D.N. Ciruela A. McQueen-Mason S. Simpson P.J. Williamson M.P. Rixon J.E. Boraston A.B.

The three-dimensional structure (see afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/∼pedro/CAZY/cbm.html) of all CBMs characterized to date consist primarily of β-strands. Those that bind to crystalline cellulose have a flat ligand-binding surface (3Xu G.-Y. Ong E. Gilkes N.R. Kilburn D.G. Muhandiram D.R. Harris-Brandts M. Carver J.P. Kay L.E. Harvey T.S.

Bolam D.N. Turkenburg J.P. Gilbert H.J. Ferreira L.M.A. Davies G.J. Fontes C.M.G.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5013-5021Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 14Johnson P.E. Joshi M.D. Tomme P.

Chem. 2001; 276 (in press)Google Scholar). Ligand binding in CBMs is dominated by hydrophobic interactions between the sugar rings and aromatic residues on the surface of the protein-binding site (see Ref.1Tomme P. Warren R.A.J. Gilkes N.R. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1995; 37: 1-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar for review), and a recent study has shown that the orientation of these aromatic amino acids can play an important role in ligand specificity (16Simpson P.J. Xie H.F. Bolam D.N. White P. Gilbert H.J. Williamson M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41137-41142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Members of CBM family 6 are found in a variety of enzymes that include α-agarases, α-1,6-mannanases, xylanases, acetylxylan esterases, cellodextrinases, β-1,3-glucanases, and cellulases (afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/∼pedro/CAZY/db.html). Currently there is no three-dimensional structural data for any CBM6 module, and there is no information on which amino acids play a key role in ligand binding. To investigate the structural basis for the capacity of family 6 CBMs to bind to polysaccharides, we have used a combination of x-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and biochemical studies to define the ligand-binding site in CBM6 from Clostridium thermocellum xylanase 11A (Xyn11A, formerly XynU). This modular xylanase consists of an N-terminal catalytic module that belongs to glycoside hydrolase family 11, an internal dockerin module (17Shoham Y. Lamed R. Bayer E.A. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 275-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), and a C-terminal CBM6 that binds primarily to insoluble xylan but can also interact with insoluble cellulose (18Fernandes A.C. Fontes C.M.G.A. Gilbert H.J. Hazlewood G.P. Fernandes T.H. Ferreira L.M.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Here we report the crystal structure of the first representative of CBM family 6, Xyn11A CBM6. This has facilitated the definition of a novel CBM superfamily that encompasses CBM6, CBM4, and CBM22. Surprisingly, the location of the ligand-binding site in CBM6 is clearly different than that of CBM4 and CBM22. The CBM6 from Xyn11A was produced and purified as described earlier (18Fernandes A.C. Fontes C.M.G.A. Gilbert H.J. Hazlewood G.P. Fernandes T.H. Ferreira L.M.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Mutants of the protein were generated by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To investigate the ligand-binding site of the protein, the mutants Y34A and N120A were generated. To assist in solving the crystal structure of the protein, four methionine mutants (Y40M, R72M, W92M, and Y112M) were produced, as the native CBM6 does not contain any methionine residues. The seleno-methionine-substituted proteins were expressed as described previously (13Charnock S.J. Bolam D.N. Turkenburg J.P. Gilbert H.J. Ferreira L.M.A. Davies G.J. Fontes C.M.G.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5013-5021Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and purified as for the native protein except that 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol was included in the lysis and wash buffers, and 10 mm dithiothreitol was added to the dialysis buffer. To produce 15N-labeled protein, Escherichia coli BL21 (Novagen) containing pXU (encodes native CBM6) was cultured at 30 °C in 6× 400 ml (in 2-liter conical flasks) of growth media comprising 2 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mmCaCl2, 0.2% glucose, and M9 salts containing15N ammonium sulfate (Martek Biosciences Corp.), until theA 600 reached 0.6, at which point expression of the recombinant protein was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were harvested after a further 8 h growth and the labeled CBM6 purified as for native protein. The 15N-13C-labeled CBM was produced in exactly the same way except that [13C]glucose (Martek Biosciences Corp.) was used instead of unlabeled glucose in the liquid media. ITC measurements were made at 25 °C for a range of oligosaccharides and polysaccharides, as described previously (15Szabó L. Jamal S. Xie H. Charnock S.J. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 (in press)Google Scholar). The concentration of protein used was such that the c value (K a × molar protein concentration × number of binding sites on protein) was >3 for all ligands except xylobiose and cellohexaose. The capacity of CBM6 and its derivatives to bind to a range of soluble plant structural polysaccharides was evaluated by AGE. The method was carried out as described by Charnock et al. (13Charnock S.J. Bolam D.N. Turkenburg J.P. Gilbert H.J. Ferreira L.M.A. Davies G.J. Fontes C.M.G.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5013-5021Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) except that gels were subjected to electrophoresis for 3 h. AGE was also carried out in the presence of a range of oat spelt xylan concentrations (0.1 to 0.005 mg ml−1), and affinity constants for the interaction of native and mutant forms of CBM6 with ligand were determined using equations derived from Takeo (19Takeo K. Electrophoresis. 1984; 5: 187-195Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Crystals of CBM6 were grown by vapor phase diffusion using the hanging drop method. Equal amounts of protein (12 mg/ml in 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0) and reservoir solution, containing 30% polyethylene glycol 4000, 100 mmsodium citrate buffer, pH 5.5 and 100 mm(NH4)2SO4, were mixed. Needle-like crystals grew from microseeds after several weeks at 4 °C. The seleno-methionine-substituted protein crystals for two of the four mutants, namely R72M and Y112M, grew under the same conditions, except that the reservoir additionally contained a 10 mmtris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride solution. A 10% glycerol solution was added to the mother liquor in both cases, prior to freezing the crystals. A rayon fiber loop was used to transfer the crystals into a liquid nitrogen cold stream. Preliminary x-ray diffraction analysis revealed that they belong to space group P6122 or P6522 with unit cell dimensionsa and b = 60.12 and c = 157.43 Å and with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The crystals of the R72M seleno-methionine containing CBM6 mutant were larger in size and diffracted to higher resolution and were therefore chosen for the MAD experiment. A three-wavelength MAD experiment was conducted on beamline ID14-4 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) at Grenoble, France, using an ADSC Quantum-4 CCD detector. A single crystal of seleno-methionine containing CBM6 was flash-frozen in the laboratory and then preserved in liquid nitrogen. The crystal was transported to the ESRF, where it was remounted on the single axis goniometer. The wavelengths for the MAD experiment were chosen by scanning through the absorption edge of the R72M seleno-methionine containing CBM6 crystal. Data were collected at three wavelengths to maximize the anomalous signal as follows: at minimum f ′, maximumf "", and a reference wavelength at an energy above the absorption edge (Table I). After indexing an initial diffraction image using the program package HKL2000 (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38702) Google Scholar), the program STRATEGY (21Ravelli R.B.G. Sweet R.M. Skinner J.M. Duisenberg A.J.M. Kroon J. J. Appl.

A total of 60 images with 1° oscillation was collected at each of the three wavelengths.

Open table in a new tab Because only one selenium was present in the protein, the Patterson maps were deconvoluted by hand, and the site was confirmed by the SOLVE (23Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar) automated Patterson search. The Selenium position was refined, and the phase calculations were performed using the program SHARP (24De La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar) in both space groups and in the resolution range between 32 and 3.0 Å. Subsequently, a cycle of phase improvement was applied using the program DM (25Cowtan K.D. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 49: 148-157Crossref Google Scholar). The correct enantiomorph (P6522) was determined by the quality of the resulting electron density maps. The electron density map at 3.0 Å, calculated after DM in space group P6522, displayed extensive well defined regions revealing continuous stretches of main chain density, with unambiguous density for carbonyl oxygen atoms and side chains. A model comprising 120 amino acids was built from the initial map with the graphics program TURBO-FRODO (26Roussel A. Cambillau C. TURBO-FRODO, Geometry Partners Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1991Google Scholar). This model was refined using the CNS program (27Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S.

Data to 2.0-Å resolution were collected on a native CBM6 crystal on beamline ID14-2 (λ = 0.933 Å) at the ESRF Grenoble, France (Table I). Data were processed and reduced as described above. The refinement of the 3.0-Å model was continued using these data at 2.1-Å resolution. Water molecules and alternative conformers were added, and TLS refinement, using the TLS option in REFMAC (28Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar), was performed as deemed appropriate from the behavior of the cross-validation (R free) subset of reflections (5%). The final electron density map in the region of Tyr-34 and Trp-92 is shown in Fig. 1. Homonuclear NMR experiments were performed on a 2.0 mm unlabeled protein sample at 307 K, unless otherwise indicated, in 90% H2O and 10% (v/v) D2O containing 20 mm deuterated sodium acetate buffer at pH 5.0. All NMR spectra were recorded on a 500-MHz DRX Bruker spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm triple resonance HCN probe with self-shielded triple axis gradients. DQF-COSY, Clean TOCSY, and NOESY spectra were acquired in a phase-sensitive mode using States-TPPI. Heteronuclear NMR experiments were performed at 307 K on 0.5 mm uniformly 15N-labeled protein in 20 mm deuterated sodium acetate buffer at pH 5.0 containing 10% (v/v) D2O, and on 0.3 mm uniformly13C-15N-labeled protein under the same conditions. Two-dimensional HSQC, two-dimensional HSQC-NOESY, and two-dimensional HSQC-TOCSY as well as three-dimensional NOESY-HSQC, three-dimensional TOCSY-HSQC, and three-dimensional HSQC-NOESY-HSQC were acquired using the Fast HSQC scheme described by Mori et al.

Spectral analysis was performed using the XEASY software, following the standard strategy described by Wüthrich (35Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley Interscience, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar) combined with heteronuclear strategy. To identify the residues of CBM6 involved in binding xylohexaose, five 1H-15N HSQC spectra were acquired. A first HSQC spectrum was recorded on CBM6 alone at 0.5 mm. Four further1H-15N HSQC spectra were then recorded with 0.2, 0.6, 0.9, and 1.2 mm xylohexaose, respectively. To evaluate the binding specificity of CBM6 in more detail, the protein was subjected to affinity gel electrophoresis. The data (not shown) revealed that the protein binds to oat spelt, birchwood, rye, and wheat xylans, which vary in their degree of substitution, interacts weakly with barley β-glucan and soluble forms of cellulose (hydroxyethylcellulose and methylcellulose), but does not associate with sugar beet arabinan, potato, and pectic β-1,4-galactan, lime and apple pectin, rhamnogalacturonan, locust bean and carob galactomannan, or carboxymethyl β-1,3-glucan. ITC was used to quantify the affinity of CBM6 for xylan, xylooligosaccharides, and cellohexaose. The full data are presented in Table II. The results show that the protein binds to xylooligosaccharides with a dp of 2 or more, with the affinity increasing up to xylopentaose. The association constant of the CBM for xylopentaose is ∼50 and 100 times higher than for xylobiose and cellohexaose, respectively. The affinity of the protein for highly substituted arabinoxylans (wheat and rye) or poorly substituted xylans (oat spelt and birchwood xylan) is broadly similar. These data suggest that the protein has five sugar-binding sites and can accommodate highly decorated xylans. The stoichiometry of binding for all oligosaccharides was 1:1, indicating that there is only one ligand-binding site per protein molecule. This is consistent with the other CBMs, such as CBM4 (4Tomme P. Creagh A.L. Kilburn D.G. Haynes C.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13885-13894Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), CBM9 (36Boraston A.B. Creagh A.L. Alam M.M. Kormos J.M. Tomme P. Haynes C.A. Warren R.A.J. Kilburn D.G.

Open table in a new tab The ΔH and T ΔS values were negative for all ligands tested, demonstrating that the binding of CBM6 to soluble carbohydrates is enthalpically driven.

The crystals of CBM6 belong to the space group P6522 with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The phases determined by the MAD method (figure of merit 0.41) with subsequent phase improvement using DM gave a map with a mean figure of merit of 0.67. The final model of CBM6 consists of residues 4–129 (with 4 residues displaying two alternate conformers), 2 ions, and 140 water molecules. The coordinates have been deposited at the Protein Data Bank (code 1gmm). The overall mean temperature factor value for the CBM6 molecule is 18.57 Å2; however, TLS refinement of selected groups of residues showed that the particular loop region including residues 22–33 displayed highly anisotropic librational motion. Refinement statistics are given in Table I. The structure of CBM6 forms a classic lectin-like β-jelly roll (Fig.2), predominantly consisting of five antiparallel β-strands on one face and four antiparallel β-strands on the other face. This fold displays most similarity to theBacillus thuringiensis insecticidal toxin (Protein Data Bank code 1ciy) and a tyrosine kinase receptor domain (Protein Data Bank code 1nuk) but also to CBM22 (Protein Data Bank code 1dyo), CBM4 (Protein Data Bank code 1ulo), and a Griffonia simplicifolia lectin (Protein Data Bank code 1led). The respective root mean square deviations are 2.1 Å (115 matched Cα atoms), 2.7 Å (117 matched Cα atoms), 3.5 Å (117 matched Cα atoms), 3.2 Å (108 matched Cα atoms), and 3.4 Å (105 matched Cα atoms) when calculated using DALI (39Holm L. Sander C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3600-3609PubMed Google Scholar). CBM6 displays a small shallow cleft, lined by two aromatic residues Trp-92 and Tyr-34 (Fig. 2, cleft A). However, when the fold is compared with CBM22 and CBM4, a second putative ligand-binding site becomes apparent on the concave face of the jelly roll (Fig. 2,cleft B). This latter cleft strongly resembles those observed in CBM22 (13Charnock S.J. Bolam D.N. Turkenburg J.P. Gilbert H.J. Ferreira L.M.A. Davies G.J. Fontes C.M.G.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5013-5021Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and CBM4 (14Johnson P.E. Joshi M.D. Tomme P. Kilburn D.G. McIntosh L.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14381-14394Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and two aromatic residues are equally located close to the surface, namely Tyr-40 and Tyr-112, the aromatic nature of which are relatively conserved in CBM family 6 (Tyr-40 is replaced by a tryptophan in a number of family members; Fig.3). Surprisingly, a proline residue of a neighboring loop (residues 73–79) covers up this groove, making the surface aromatic residues inaccessible for xylooligosaccharides. Two ion sites were identified in the CBM6 crystal structure. The first site displays a typical hepta-coordination geometry to accommodate a calcium ion and links the side chains of Glu-8 and Glu-10 (bidentate coordination) of the N-terminal region to the side chain of Asp-122 of the C-terminal stretch. Two main chain carbonyl groups of Ser-30 and Glu-8 complete the coordination sphere, and three water molecules are in close contact (Fig. 1 b). This ion can be considered as a structural calcium ion. It is located at an equivalent position as the structural calcium ion found in CBM22 (13Charnock S.J. Bolam D.N. Turkenburg J.P. Gilbert H.J. Ferreira L.M.A. Davies G.J. Fontes C.M.G.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5013-5021Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), bridging the N- and C-terminal regions, although neither the residues that interact with the ion nor the number of different ligation types are identical. Structural calcium ions often play a key role in protein stability (40Spurway T.D. Morland C. Cooper A. Sumner I. Hazlewood G.P. O'Donnell A.G. Pickersgill R.W. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17523-17530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and recent data have shown that removal of the divalent ion from CBM6 greatly increased the susceptibility of the protein to proteolytic degradation. 2C.

We hypothesized that Scp2 deficiency may alter biliary lipid secretion and hepatic cholesterol metabolism. Male gallstone-susceptible C57BL/6 and C57BL/6Scp2 (−/−) knockout mice were fed a standard chow or lithogenic diet. Hepatic biles were collected to determine biliary lipid secretion rates, bile flow, and bile salt pool size. Plasma lipoprotein distribution was investigated, and gene expression of cytosolic lipid-binding proteins, lipoprotein receptors, hepatic regulatory enzymes, and intestinal cholesterol absorption was measured. Compared with chow-fed wild-type animals, C57BL/6Scp2 (−/−) mice had higher bile flow and lower bile salt secretion rates, decreased hepatic apolipoprotein expression, increased hepatic cholesterol synthesis, and up-regulation of liver fatty acid-binding protein. In addition, the bile salt pool size was reduced and intestinal cholesterol absorption was unaltered in C57BL/6Scp2 (−/−) mice. When C57BL/6Scp2 (−/−) mice were challenged with a lithogenic diet, a smaller increase of hepatic free cholesterol failed to suppress cholesterol synthesis and biliary cholesterol secretion increased to a much smaller extent than phospholipid and bile salt secretion. Scp2 deficiency did not prevent gallstone formation and may be compensated in part by hepatic up-regulation of liver fatty acid-binding protein.

Indeed, several lines of evidence support this notion: (i) Scp2 antisense treatment of rats reduced and delayed biliary cholesterol secretion (6Puglielli L. Rigotti A. Greco A.V. Santos M.J. Nervi F.

Chem. 1995; 270: 18723-18726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar); (ii) diosgenin-induced hypersecretion of cholesterol into bile in rats was associated with increased hepatic Scp2 expression (6Puglielli L.

Lammert F. Wang D.Q.H. Paigen B. Carey M.C. Cohen D.E. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These findings, together with elevated hepatic SCP2 levels in human gallstone carriers (14Ito T. Kawata S. Imai Y. Kakimoto H. Trzaskos J.M. Matsuzawa Y.

Unless otherwise indicated, materials were obtained from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany) or Biometra (Göttingen, Germany). Male C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories Inc. (Wilmington, MA). Mice with targeted disruption of the Scp2 gene (C57BL/6Scp2 (−/−)) by homologous recombination were kindly provided by Dr. Udo Seedorf (Institute for Arteriosclerosis Research, University of Münster, Münster, Germany) and bred to generate our own mouse colony. The animals were maintained under constant light-dark cycles (light from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.) with free access to water and a standard chow diet (∼3% fat, <0.02% cholesterol; Altromin 1340, Altromin GmbH, Lage, Germany). Genotype analysis using DNA isolated from mouse tail tips (15Seedorf U. Raabe M. Ellinghaus P. Kannenberg F. Fobker M. Engel T. Denis S. Wouters F. Wirtz K.W.A. Wanders R.J.A. Maeda N. Assmann G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1189-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) was performed with all knockout mice of our colony. Twelve-week-old mice were put on a lithogenic diet (TD 90221, Teklad Research Diets, Madison, WI) consisting of 15% cocoa fat, 1.25% cholesterol, and 0.5% sodium cholate or on standard chow diet for 3 months. Despite significant amounts of cholic acid present in the lithogenic diet, none of the animals developed diarrhea. Liver histology and measurements of bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and γ-glutamyl transferase excluded hemolysis and significant liver disease under our experimental conditions. After 3 months on the diet, overnight fasted mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital (35 mg/kg body weight). The abdominal cavity was then opened by a midline incision to expose the gallbladder and biliary tract for visual inspection. To minimize the influence of circadian variations on our measurements, surgery was done between 9:00 and 10.00 a.m. If present, gallstones were visible to the unaided eye through the gallbladder wall. We next performed a cholecystectomy, followed by cannulation of the common bile duct with a PE-10 polyethylene catheter (Clay Adams, Parsippany, NJ). Hepatic biles were collected by gravity for 1 h, during which the body temperatures of the mice were kept constant with a heating lamp. Thereafter, livers were harvested, weighed, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until use for mRNA and protein determinations. Throughout the experimental period, all animals received human care according to the criteria for the care and use of laboratory animals. Protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Euthanasia was consistent with recommendations of the American Veterinary Medical Association. Hepatic biles were stored at −20 °C until use for lipid analyses. Phospholipids were measured with a standard enzymatic method (13Fuchs M. Lammert F. Wang D.Q.H. Paigen B. Carey M.C. Cohen D.E. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Biliary cholesterol and bile salts were analyzed employing gas chromatography mass spectrometry as described in detail elsewhere (15Seedorf U. Raabe M. Ellinghaus P. Kannenberg F. Fobker M. Engel T. Denis S. Wouters F. Wirtz K.W.A. Wanders R.J.A. Maeda N. Assmann G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1189-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Bile flow rates were determined gravimetrically assuming a density of 1 g/ml and used to calculate biliary lipid secretion rates. To determine hepatic cholesterol contents, lipids were extracted from liver tissue (17Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biol. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42389) Google Scholar) and dissolved in isopropanol, and aliquots were used for colorimetric determination of total and free cholesterol. Prior to harvesting, livers were briefly flushed with saline to minimize the contribution from plasma cholesterol in determinations of hepatic cholesterol contents. For determinations of plasma lipoproteins following fasting for 12–16 h, blood was collected from the retro-orbital venous plexus into tubes containing 1 μl of 1 mm EDTA. Pooled plasma (400 μl total from up to 6 animals) was subjected to fast performance liquid chromatography using two Superose 6 columns (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany) connected in series. Proteins were eluted using a buffer containing 154 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% NaN3 at 0,5 ml/min (18Jiao S. Cole T.G. Kitchens R.T. Pfleger B. Schonfeld G. Metabolism. 1990; 39: 155-160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and fractions of 0.5 ml were collected. Total cholesterol concentrations of each fraction and of plasma were determined employing a commercial colorimetric assay. Relative quantitation of transcript abundance employed reverse transcription-polymerase reaction. Because of its invariant expression across treatment conditions, 18 S ribosomal RNA was used as internal standard (19Suzuki T. Higgins P.J. Crawford D.R. BioTechniques. 2000; 29: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 20Thellin O. Zorzi W. Lakaye B. de Borman B. Coumans B. Hennen G. Grisar T. Igout A. Heinen E. J. Biotechnol. 1999; 8: 291-295Crossref Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). Total mouse liver RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc., Munich, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and reverse transcription was performed with the SuperScript II preamplification system (Life Technologies, Inc.). An aliquot of the reaction was subjected to PCR amplification using gene specific primers together with a “competimer”/primer mix specific for 18 S ribosomal RNA (QuantumRNA 18 S Internal Standards, Ambion, Austin, TX). Gene-specific cDNAs were amplified with the following primer pairs (the size of the resulting amplicon is given in parentheses):Hmgcr (882 bp): 5′-ATC ATC TTG GAG AGA TAA AAC TGC CA-3′ (sense), 5′-GGG ACG GTG ACA CTT ACC ATC TGT ATG ATG-3′ (antisense);Acat2 (423 bp): 5′-CAT CTC GCC GAA GGC GTT GAG-3′ (sense), 5′-CGC TGC GTG CTG GTC TTT GAG-3′ (antisense); Ldlr (210 bp): 5′-CTC CTC ATT CCC TCT GCC AGC CAT-3′ (sense), 5′-GAA GTC GAC ACT GTA CTG ACC ACC-3′ (antisense); Srb1 (590 bp): 5′-AGT GGG GGT GGG AGA GAA AC-3′ (sense), 5′-CAA GCC TGT GAG CCT GAA GC-3′ (antisense); Npc1 (457 bp): 5′-GCA TCT TCT GTT GCA GCA GC-3′ (sense), 5′-GGT TCT CAT TCC TTG CGC CA-3′ (antisense). Competimers are primers that can not be extended. The ratio of 18 S competimers to primers was adjusted such that the amount of 18 S rRNA product was within the same range as that of the mRNAs of interest. Amplified samples were subjected to densitometry following agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide staining. Initial validation of the RT-PCR protocol demonstrated similar results when compared with Northern blot analysis (21Fuchs M. Ivandic B. Müller O. Schalla C. Scheibner J. Bartsch P. Stange E.F. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 1451-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). cDNA encoding a fragment (394 bp) of mouse Fabpl (22Wolfrum C. Ellinghaus P. Fobker M. Seedorf U. Assmann G. Börchers T. Spencer F. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 708-714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was synthesized by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions employing total mouse liver RNA and the following primer set: 5′-AAA TTC TCT TGC TGA CTC-3′ (sense); 5′-AAC TTC TCC GGC AAG TAC-3′ (antisense). Employing a TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, The Netherlands), the resulting PCR product of 394 bp was subcloned into pCRII and sequenced. Identity was confirmed by data base comparison using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). Mouse liver RNA (15 μg) was denatured with formaldehyde and formamide, electrophoresed on 1% (w/v) agarose gels, and transferred onto GeneScreenPlus membranes (PerkinElmer Biosciences). A radiolabeled probe of gel-purified Fabpl cDNAs was obtained employing a random primer labeling kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). The filters were hybridized overnight with the 32P-labeled probe at 42 °C. Following washing, filters were exposed to X-Omat LS films (Kodak, Stuttgart, Germany) at −80 °C with intensifying screens. Densitometry with a GS-700 imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad, München, Germany) using Molecular Analyst 1.5 software was employed to quantitate steady state mRNA levels. To normalize for equivalent loading of RNA, the filter was stripped and rehybridized with a Gapdh probe (CLONTECH, Heidelberg, Germany). Liver homogenate and cytosol were prepared (13Fuchs M. Lammert F. Wang D.Q.H. Paigen B. Carey M.C. Cohen D.E. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and protein concentrations were assayed using bovine serum albumin as standard (13Fuchs M. Lammert F. Wang D.Q.H. Paigen B. Carey M.C. Cohen D.E. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Equal quantities of mouse liver homogenate or cytosol (50–100 μg) were subjected to reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (13Fuchs M. Lammert F. Wang D.Q.H. Paigen B. Carey M.C. Cohen D.E. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membranes. Antigen detection was carried out using a 1:5000 dilution of a polyclonal antibody against mouse Srb1. Anti-human APOA1 and APOE antibodies were employed as 1:4000 and 1:1000 dilutions, respectively. The concentration of the antibody against l-Fabp was 2.5 μg/ml. Following incubation with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (DAKO Chemicals), detection of immunoreactive proteins was accomplished with enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and quantified by scanning densitometry. Separate groups of chow-fed C57BL/6 (n = 3) and C57BL/6Scp2 (−/−) (n = 4) mice were used to measure the bile salt pool size and composition. After an overnight fast, mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital (35 mg/kg body weight). The abdominal cavity was opened by a midline incision to remove gallbladder, liver, and intestine. Organs and their contents were minced in 100 ml of 75% ethanol with 10 μl [24-14C]taurocholic acid added as internal standard. Bile salts were extracted by heating at 50 °C for 4 h (23Yu C. Wang F. Kan M. Jin C. Jones R.B. Weinstein M. Deng C.-X. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15482-15489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Following filtration, the volume was adjusted to a final volume of 100 ml of which an aliquot of 20 ml was taken to dryness (24Schwarz M. Russell D.W. Dietschy J.M. Turley S.D. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1833-1843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bile salt composition of the dried extract was analyzed employing gas chromatography mass spectrometry as described in detail elsewhere (15Seedorf U. Raabe M. Ellinghaus P. Kannenberg F. Fobker M. Engel T. Denis S. Wouters F. Wirtz K.W.A. Wanders R.J.A. Maeda N. Assmann G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1189-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Together with the recovery of the radiolabeled internal standard, the bile salt pool size was calculated. A dual-isotope ratio method was employed for the measurement of intestinal cholesterol absorption (24Schwarz M. Russell D.W. Dietschy J.M. Turley S.D. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1833-1843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, six mice of each group were housed individually in wire cages and adjusted to this environment for 3 days. After an overnight fast, mice were anesthetized with diethylether just enough to numb the animal for a few seconds to prevent the mouse from biting the polyethylene tubing (PE 86; Clay Adams) used for gavage. Anesthetized animals were given an intragastric bolus of MCT oil containing a mixture of 1 μCi of [4-14C]cholesterol and 2 μCi of [5,6-3H]sitostanol. The total volume of the mixture was adjusted to the body weight of each animal (100 μl/25 g body weight). Following gavage, the mice were placed individually in clean cages to collect the feces for a period of 72 h. Aliquots of dried feces and the dosing mixture were extracted with chloroform-methanol (2:1 v/v), and the [14C]/[3H] ratio of each was determined for calculation of the percent cholesterol absorption. Food intake and weight of dried feces did not differ significantly among the groups studied. Data were analyzed by unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t test. Results are expressed as the arithmetic mean ± 1 S.D., and p values < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Cholesterol gallstones were present in gallbladders of all mice fed the lithogenic diet. Common bile duct stones with extrahepatic dilatation of the bile duct occurred in one C57BL/6 mouse, which was not used for further analysis. In contrast, gallstones did not form in animals that received the standard chow diet. This indicates that targeting Scp2 expression does not allow prevention of cholesterol gallstone formation in gallstone-susceptible C57BL/6 mice fed a lithogenic diet. The mean initial body weight of C57BL/6Scp2 (−/−) mice (36 ± 3g) was significantly (p < 0.05) higher compared with wild-type animals (26 ± 1g) (15Seedorf U. Raabe M. Ellinghaus P. Kannenberg F. Fobker M. Engel T. Denis S. Wouters F. Wirtz K.W.A. Wanders R.J.A. Maeda N. Assmann G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1189-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). When challenged with the lithogenic diet, body weights of C57BL/6 mice and Scp2-deficient mice increased to 30 ± 2g (p > 0.05) or remained constant, respectively. The mean initial liver weight (g/100 g body weight) in C57BL/6 and C57BL/6Scp2 (−/−) mice was 4.2 ± 0.4 and 4.2 ± 0.3, respectively. In response to the lithogenic diet, the mean liver weights of both groups increased (p < 0.001) to a similar extent to 8.3 ± 2.0 and 7.0 ± 1.1, respectively. The mean hepatic free cholesterol concentration (mg/g liver) of chow-fed C57BL/6Scp2 (−/−) mice was 2.09 ± 0.33 and significantly (p < 0.005) lower than in C57BL/6 mice (2.98 ± 0.09), reflected by a reduced total hepatic cholesterol concentration (2.73 ± 0.32 versus 3.96 ± 0.38; p < 0.05) (Fig.1). Hepatic total cholesterol contents increased 7–9-fold in response to the lithogenic diet in C57BL/6Scp2 (−/−) and C57BL/6 mice, respectively. This was attributable to a significant increase of the cholesteryl ester concentration, which was more pronounced in C57BL/6 mice (37.4 ± 6.6 versus 18.4 ± 8.7;p < 0.05). To measure biliary lipid secretion rates, hepatic bile was collected during the first hour of an acute bile fistula before and after feeding a lithogenic diet. As shown in Table I, biliary cholesterol and phospholipid secretion rates (nmol/min/100 g body wt) in chow-fed C57BL/6 mice were 2.6 ± 0.6 and 42 ± 17, respectively. Similar secretion rates were obtained for C57BL/6Scp2 (−/−) mice (cholesterol: 5.3 ± 2.3; phospholipids: 30 ± 8). Compared with chow-fed C57BL/6Scp2 (−/−) animals, C57BL/6 mice had 2.7-fold higher (p < 0.01) total bile salt secretion rates and an ∼2-fold lower (5.8 ± 0.8 versus 8.5 ± 1.6 μl/min/100 g body wt; p < 0.05) bile flow. Under control conditions, the cholesterol/phospholipid ratio of hepatic bile that reflects the lipid composition of canalicular vesicles was 3-fold lower in C57BL/6 mice. Additionally, the cholesterol/bile acid and phospholipid/bile acid coupling rate that mirrors the linkage of cholesterol and phospholipid to bile acid secretion was substantially lower in C57BL/6 mice. When C57BL/6 animals were fed the lithogenic diet, cholesterol and phospholipid secretion rates increased significantly to 56 ± 11 (p < 0.001) and 238 ± 62 (p < 0.01), respectively. We measured a comparable and significant (p < 0.001) increase of biliary phospholipid secretion, which amounted to 152 ± 45 in C57BL/6Scp2 (−/−) mice, but biliary cholesterol output was elevated only 3-fold (p < 0.001). As shown for biliary cholesterol and phospholipids, the lithogenic diet increased bile salt secretion significantly (p < 0.001) in both groups. Whereas bile flow remained almost constant in C57BL/6Scp2 (−/−), a significant (p < 0.01) increase to 15.0 ± 2.7 was noticed for C57BL/6 animals. In response to the lithogenic diet, the cholesterol/phospholipid ratio of hepatic bile increased 4-fold in C57BL/6 mice but did not increase in gene ablated mice. The cholesterol/bile acid ratio was identical among the two groups after feeding the lithogenic diet, whereas the phospholipid/bile acid coupling rate declined to a similar degree in both groups. These data indicate that impaired biliary cholesterol but not phospholipid and bile salt secretion in response to the lithogenic diet may reflect alterations at the level of the canalicular plasma membrane.Table IEffect of the lithogenic diet on biliary lipid secretion rates and bile flowStrainDietBiliary lipid secretion ratesBile flowCholesterolPhospholipidsBile saltsnmol/min/100 g body weightμl/min/100 g body weightC57BL/6Chow2.6 ± 0.642 ± 17258 ± 1105.8 ± 0.8Lithogenic56 ± 11ap < 0.001, compared to chow-fed mice.238 ± 62bp < 0.01, compared to chow-fed mice.2957 ± 708ap < 0.001, compared to chow-fed mice.15.0 ± 2.7bp < 0.01, compared to chow-fed mice.C57BL/6Scp2(−/−)Chow5.3 ± 2.330 ± 883 ± 40cp < 0.01, compared to chow-fed C57BL/6 mice.8.5 ± 1.6dp < 0.05, compared to chow-fed C57BL/6 mice.Lithogenic16.3 ± 2.4ap < 0.001, compared to chow-fed mice.152 ± 45ap < 0.001, compared to chow-fed mice.745 ± 298ap < 0.001, compared to chow-fed mice.9.9 ± 2.4C57BL/6 and C57BL/6Scp2(−/−) mice (n = 6–9) were fed a low cholesterol standard chow or a lithogenic diet for 12 weeks.

Data are expressed as mean ± 1 S.D. Lipoprotein profiles of pooled plasma (Fig. 2) obtained from animals fed the control diet demonstrated that most cholesterol was carried in the HDL fraction. However, C57BL/6 mice exhibited lower HDL cholesterol (37 mg/dl) levels than C57BL/6Scp2 (−/−) animals (60 mg/dl). In response to the lithogenic diet, total plasma cholesterol levels in C57BL/6 and C57BL/6Scp2 (−/−) mice increased to 129 and 110 mg/dl, respectively. Under these conditions, VLDL/LDL cholesterol levels increased substantially in C57BL/6 and C57BL/6Scp2 (−/−) mice, but this was less pronounced in C57BL/6Scp2 (−/−) mice. HDL cholesterol levels decreased upon feeding the lithogenic diet to 12 and 34 mg/dl in C57BL/6 and C57BL/6Scp2 (−/−)animals, respectively. This finding indicates that SCP-2 expression may regulate lipoprotein cholesterol metabolism. Modifications in the plasma lipoprotein chol"

Their biosynthesis proceeds by stepwise addition of galactose units to sucrose, which are provided by the unusual donor galactinol (O-α-d-galactopyranosyl-(1→1)-l-myo-inositol). Chain elongation may also proceed by transfer of galactose units between raffinose oligosaccharides. We here report on the purification, characterization, and heterologous expression of a multifunctional stachyose synthase (EC 2.4.1.67) from developing pea (Pisum sativum L.) seeds. The protein, a member of family 36 of glycoside hydrolases, catalyzes the synthesis of stachyose, the tetrasaccharide of the raffinose series, by galactosyl transfer from galactinol to raffinose. It also mediates the synthesis of the pentasaccharide verbascose by galactosyl transfer from galactinol to stachyose as well as by self-transfer of the terminal galactose residue from one stachyose molecule to another. These activities show optima at pH 7.0. The enzyme also catalyzes hydrolysis of the terminal galactose residue of its substrates, but is unable to initiate the synthesis of raffinose oligosaccharides by galactosyl transfer from galactinol to sucrose. A minimum reaction mechanism which accounts for the broad substrate specificity and the steady-state kinetic properties of the protein is presented.

They are synthesized in leaves, roots, and tubers of a range of plant species. In seeds of higher plants, they are of almost ubiquitous occurrence (1Horbowicz M. Obendorf R.L. Seed Sci. Res. 1994; 4: 385-405Crossref Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In some crop species, raffinose oligosaccharides comprise up to 16% of seed dry matter (1Horbowicz M. Obendorf R.L. Seed Sci. Res. 1994; 4: 385-405Crossref Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 2Muzquiz M. Burbano C. Pedrosa M.M. Folkman W. Gulewicz K. Ind. Crops Prod. 1999; 9: 183-188Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Aside from a role as storage and transport carbohydrates (3Sprenger N. Keller F. Plant J. 2000; 21: 249-258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), other functions of these oligosaccharides remain elusive. In the specialized, desiccation-tolerant seeds of higher plants, raffinose and its higher homologues may play a role as protective agents during maturation drying (4Hoekstra F.A. Golovina E.A. Buitink J. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 431-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). Furthermore, correlative and experimental data suggest they may act as cryoprotectants in frost-hardy plants (5Travert S. Valerio L. Fourasté I. Boudet A.M. Teuliéres C. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 6Gilmour S.J. Sebolt A.M. Salazar M.P. Everard J.D. Thomashow M.F. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1854-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). While they have long been regarded as non-digestible factors promoting flatulence in human nutrition, more recent data suggest a beneficial effect of raffinose oligosaccharides on the gut microflora (7Tortuero F. Fernandez E. Ruperez P. Moreno M. Nutr. Res. 1997; 17: 41-49Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Their physical characteristics make them also suitable for non-food applications, such as organ preservation (8Fischer S. Hopkinson D. Liu M.Y. MacLean A.A. Edwards V. Cutz E. Keshavjee S. Ann. Thorac. Surg. 2001; 71: 1140-1145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The first step in the biosynthesis of raffinose oligosaccharides is the reversible transfer of the galactosyl residue of the unusual donor galactinol, an α-galactoside of myo-inositol (O-α-d-galactopyranosyl-(1→1)-l-myo-inositol), to sucrose. The resulting trisaccharide raffinose serves as an acceptor for another galactosyl residue from galactinol, yielding the tetrasaccharide stachyose (for review, see Ref. 9Peterbauer T. Richter A. Seed Sci. Res. 2001; 11: 185-197Google Scholar). These reactions are catalyzed by raffinose synthase (EC. 2.4.1.82) and stachyose synthase (EC 2.4.1.67), respectively. myo-Inositol is recycled to galactinol by a specific galactosyltransferase utilizing UDP-galactose as donor (3Sprenger N. Keller F. Plant J. 2000; 21: 249-258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Very little information is available on the biochemistry of verbascose and ajugose, next higher homologues of the raffinose series. It is generally accepted that their biosynthesis involves galactinol as donor, but it is not clear whether there are specific transferases for each step (10Kandler O. Hopf H. Encycl. Plant Physiol. (New Ser.). 1982; 13A: 348-383Google Scholar). Verbascose synthase activity from seeds of Vicia faba co-purified with stachyose synthase activity during ammonium sulfate and calcium phosphate gel fractionation (11Tanner W. Lehle L. Kandler O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 29: 166-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), while stachyose synthase purified to homogeneity from adzuki bean seeds was devoid of verbascose synthase activity (12Peterbauer T. Richter A. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). More recently, an alternative mode of chain elongation has been proposed, which does not involve galactinol (13Bachmann M. Matile P. Keller F. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 1335-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In leaves ofAjuga reptans, an enzyme activity has been identified which catalyzed transfer of the terminal galactose residue from one raffinose oligosaccharide molecule to another, resulting in the formation of molecules of the next higher and lower degree of polymerization. The enzyme was tentatively termed galactan:galactan galactosyltransferase (GGT).1 Like verbascose synthase, GGT has not yet been purified or cloned. Activity was detected exclusively in vacuoles isolated from mesophyll protoplasts ofA. reptans (14Bachmann M. Keller F.

Consistent with its subcellular localization, GGT activity exhibited an acidic pH optimum (13Bachmann M. Matile P. Keller F. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 1335-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), while the galactinol-dependent transferases display optima at neutral pH values. We have previously detected a galactinol-dependent verbascose synthase activity as well as a GGT activity in crude enzyme extracts from pea seeds (16Peterbauer T. Lahuta L.B. Blöchl A. Mucha J. Jones D.A. Hedley C.L. Gòrecki R.J. Richter A. Plant Physiol. 2001; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to GGT activity from A. reptans, highest activity was observed at pH 7.0. These findings urged a more detailed study on the biosynthesis of verbascose in plant seeds. During attempts to purify the two transferases from pea seeds, we noticed that the activities co-purified with stachyose synthase. We here demonstrate that all activities are catalyzed by a single protein in pea seeds. A minimal reaction mechanism which accounts for the broad substrate specificity and steady-state kinetic properties of the enzyme is presented. Seeds of pea (Pisum sativum L.) cv. Wunder von Kelvedon were obtained from a local supplier (Austrosaat, Vienna, Austria). Raffinose and myo-inositol were from Sigma. Stachyose was from Merck and was further purified by chromatography on charcoal-Celite (17Whistler R.L. Durso D.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1950; 72: 677-679Crossref Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Verbascose was purchased from Megazyme. Galactinol (O-α-d-galactopyranosyl-(1→1)-l-myo-inositol),d-ononitol (1d-4-O-methyl-myo-inositol), and galactosyl ononitol (O-α-d-galactopyranosyl-(1→3)-4-O-methyl-d-myo-inositol) were available from previous studies (18Peterbauer T. Puschenreiter M. Richter A. Plant Cell Physiol. 1998; 39: 334-341Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 19Richter A. Peterbauer T. Brereton I. J. Nat. Prod. 1997; 60: 749-751Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). d-Pinitol (1d-3-O-methyl-chiro-inositol) was obtained from Aldrich and sequoyitol (5-O-methyl-myo-inositol) was from Roth. Galactopinitol A (O-α-d-galactopyranosyl-(1→2)-4-O-methyl-d-chiro-inositol) was a gift of Dr. F. Keller (University of Zuerich, Switzerland). All purification steps were carried out at 4 °C unless otherwise indicated. Maturing seeds were harvested 25 to 30 days after flowering, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and ground to a fine powder. The powder (280 g) was suspended in 1.5 ml of extraction buffer per gram of seeds and homogenized with a Polytron tissue homogenizer. The extraction buffer consisted of 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, 20 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% polyvinyl polypyrrolidone. The homogenate was squeezed through a fine-mesh nylon cloth and centrifuged at 26,000 × gfor 30 min. The supernatant was cleared by treatment with protamine sulfate (20Lehle L. Tanner W. Kandler O. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1970; 351: 1494-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and fractionated with solid ammonium sulfate. Proteins precipitating between 35 and 55% saturation were collected by centrifugation at 26,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was dissolved in 20 mm bis-Tris propane-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and dialyzed overnight against this buffer. The dialyzed extract was applied to an anion-exchange column (2.5 × 18 cm) of Macro-Prep High Q support (Bio-Rad) thermostated at 12 °C. Bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 250 mm NaCl in 20 mmbis-Tris propane-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. Active fractions were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration (Centricon-plus 20, Millipore). Ammonium sulfate was added to a final concentration of 1.5 m and the sample was applied to a hydrophobic interaction chromatography column (2.5 × 5 cm) of Macro-Prep Methyl support (Bio-Rad). The column was thermostated at 12 °C. Bound protein was eluted by applying a linear gradient of 1.5 to 0 m ammonium sulfate in 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. Active fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration and subjected to preparative PAGE using a Prep Cell (Model 491, Bio-Rad) as previously described (12Peterbauer T. Richter A. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Active fractions were pooled, desalted, and concentrated by repeated ultrafiltration in 20 mm Na-phosphate, pH 6.8. The sample was applied to a column (0.8 × 2.4 cm) of ceramic hydroxyapatite (Macro-Prep CHT I, Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 10 mmNa-phosphate, pH 6.8. The column was maintained at 10 °C and bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient to 200 mmNa-phosphate, pH 6.8. In standard reaction mixtures (20 μl), enzyme samples were incubated at 30 °C for 0.5 to 3 h in 20 mm Na-phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, containing either galactinol in combination with raffinose, galactinol in combination with stachyose, or stachyose alone (10 mm each). Enzyme dilutions and incubation times were chosen to allow transformation of not more than 10% of the substrates. Where specified, other galactosyl donors and acceptors were used. Reactions were stopped by incubation at 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were analyzed by HPAEC-PAD using a Dionex DX 500 chromatography system equipped with a Carbopac PA10 column (2 × 250 mm) and a PA10 guard column. The column was maintained at 25 °C and was eluted at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min with the following NaOH gradient: 0–8 min, 50 mm; 8–24 min, 50–250 mm; 24–25 min, 250–50 mm; 25–30 min, 50 mm. For analysis of reaction products involving methylated inositols as galactosyl acceptors, reaction products were converted to trimethylsilyl derivatives and analyzed by capillary gas chromatography as previously described (18Peterbauer T. Puschenreiter M. Richter A. Plant Cell Physiol. 1998; 39: 334-341Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford dye binding procedure, using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on 7.5% acrylamide gels under reducing conditions. Gels were either stained with silver nitrate or blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The blots were probed with polyclonal rabbit antibodies to adzuki bean stachyose synthase as previously described (21Peterbauer T. Mucha J. Mayer U. Popp M. Glössl J. Richter A. Plant J. 1999; 20: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) with modifications. The membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C in TBS containing 5% non-fat milk, washed with TBS containing 0.5% Tween 20, and incubated for 1 h in blocking solution containing 0.5% Tween 20 and primary antibodies at a dilution of 1:5,000. Bound primary antibodies were visualized with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Bio-Rad) and a chromogenic reaction using nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as substrates. For amino-terminal protein sequencing, the purified protein was electrophoresed as above, blotted, and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The sample was sequenced by automated Edman degradation at the Institute of Medicinal Biochemistry, University of Vienna, using an Applied Biosystems Model 476A sequencer. Total RNA was isolated from maturing seeds (about 25 days after flowering) with the RNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen). Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized using Omniscript reverse transcriptase (Qiagen) in combination with an oligo(dT) primer. The cDNA was subjected to PCR with HotStarTaq DNA polymerase (Qiagen) in combination with degenerate primers. The sense primer (5′-GARMGIAARTTYAARGTIAARGG-3′) was designed at 8 amino acids (ERKFKVKG) of the amino-terminal sequence of the purified protein. The antisense primer (5′-CCAICCISCICCYTGRCARTTRAA-3′), corresponding to the amino acid sequence FNCQG(A/G)GW, was based on a highly conserved box of the gene encoding for adzuki bean stachyose synthase and related sequences (21Peterbauer T. Mucha J. Mayer U. Popp M. Glössl J. Richter A. Plant J. 1999; 20: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The resulting PCR product was cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced using an ABI Prism BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Mix and an ABI Prism 310 sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The full-length cDNA sequence was established by RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends using the Invitrogen GeneRacerTM system. Briefly, total RNA was first treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase to remove the 5′-phosphate groups of truncated mRNAs. Subsequently, 5′-phosphate groups of capped, full-length mRNAs were exposed by treatment with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase. A synthetic RNA oligonucleotide was ligated to the exposed phosphate groups, followed by first-strand synthesis with an oligo(dT) anchor primer. For amplification of the 5′-end, a primer at the RNA oligonucleotide was used with a gene-specific antisense primer (5′-TCAGGAACATCATGGAACAAAGGAA-3′). For amplification of the 3′-end, a gene-specific sense primer (5′-TGGGAAGAGTTGGGGATGATTTTTG-3′) was used in combination with a primer homologous to the oligo(dT) primer, followed by PCR with a nested gene-specific primer (5′-GGGAAGTTTTTGGTTGCAAGGTGTG-3′). PCR products were cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector and sequenced. The coding region of the putative stachyose synthase cDNA was amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega) and the primer pair 5′-GCCGTCTAGACCATGGCTCCTCCC-3′ and 5′-GCCAGATCTATGCAAGTAACACAAACACA-3′. Restriction sites forXbaI and BglII (underlined) were introduced with the primers for cloning of the PCR product into theXbaI-BglII site of the baculovirus expression vector pVL1393. The identity of the insert was verified by sequencing. The construct was co-transfected with BaculoGold viral DNA (PharMingen) into Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 insect cells as previously described (22Leiter H. Mucha J. Staudacher E. Grimm R. Glössl J. Altmann F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21830-21839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). After incubation for 5 days at 27 °C, the supernatant from the infected cells was collected and added to Sf21 cells for viral amplification. Infected cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing a set of protease inhibitors (Complete protease inhibitor mixture, Roche Molecular Diagnostics), and disrupted by sonication. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation and desalted by repeated ultrafiltration in 20 mm Na-phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol. Pea stachyose synthase was purified 619-fold from developing seeds by several chromatographic steps combined with preparative electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions (Table I). After the last purification step on ceramic hydroxyapatite, 195 μg of protein were recovered from 280 g of seeds with a yield of 1.5% of the initial stachyose synthase activity. SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified protein revealed an apparent molecular mass of ∼95 kDa (Fig.1A). The protein was electroblotted and subjected to Edman degradation that yielded a single sequence of 25 amino acid residues, LIKTESIFDLSERKFKVKGFPLFHD. Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B) revealed cross-reactivity of the protein with polyclonal antibodies directed against stachyose synthase from adzuki bean seeds (21Peterbauer T. Mucha J. Mayer U. Popp M. Glössl J. Richter A. Plant J. 1999; 20: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). All protein fractions obtained during the purification procedure were tested for their ability to catalyze the synthesis of verbascose in the presence of galactinol as donor or with stachyose as the sole substrate. Reaction products were separated and quantified by HPAEC-PAD. The ratio of stachyose synthase activity to the latter two activities remained almost constant throughout the purification procedure (Table I), suggesting that all reactions were catalyzed by a single protein.Table ISummary of the purification of pea stachyose synthasePurification stepTotal proteinTotal activity1-aStachyose synthase activity assayed in the presence of galactinol and raffinose.Specific activity1-aStachyose synthase activity assayed in the presence of galactinol and raffinose.Activity ratioStachylaseaSynthase Verbascose synthaseVerbascose synthasebAssayed in the presence of galactinol and stachyose.

Open table in a new tab A PCR-based approach employing degenerate primers was used to isolate a cDNA fragment of ∼1.9 kilobase pairs. Based on the sequence of this fragment, primers were designed to isolate the missing cDNA ends by ligation-mediated amplification. The assembled, contiguous cDNA sequence contains an open reading frame of 853 codons which encodes a protein of 95.9 kDa, in good agreement with the molecular mass of the purified protein. The amino-terminal sequence of the purified protein was located at positions 12 to 36 of the deduced amino acid sequence (Fig. 2). A sequence similarity search using the BLAST algorithm (23Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59933) Google Scholar) revealed highest homology (75% identity and 83% similarity at the amino acid sequence level) to stachyose synthase from adzuki bean (21Peterbauer T. Mucha J. Mayer U. Popp M. Glössl J. Richter A. Plant J. 1999; 20: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Pea stachyose synthase also shows similarity with plant raffinose synthases (between 46 and 56%) and a family of plant seed imbibition proteins (SIP) of unknown function (between 28 and 30%). According to the classification system of Henrissat (24Henrissat B. Coutinho P.M. Davies G.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 47: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), all of these protein belong to glycosyl hydrolase family 36 of the glycosidase superfamily GH-D (for data base entries, see afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/∼pedro/CAZY/db.html). The positions of BLOCKS (25Henikoff J.G. Greene E.A. Pietrokovski S. Henikoff S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 228-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) glycoside hydrolase clan GH-D motifs (IPB000111) and a partial amino acid sequence alignment of pea stachyose synthase with members of the glycoside hydrolase family 36 are shown in Fig. 2. Motif IPB000111B is similar to the PROSITE (26Hofmann K. Bucher P. Falquet L. Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar) α-galactosidase pattern PS00512. Motif IPB000111C is missing in stachyose synthases, raffinose synthases, and seed imbibition proteins. Instead, pea and adzuki bean stachyose synthase share a novel motif of about 80 amino acids (positions 304 to 383 of pea stachyose synthase). This block does not show significant homology to known sequences and, therefore, appears to be diagnostic for stachyose synthases. To confirm the substrate specificity of the purified enzyme, the open reading frame of the cDNA was amplified by PCR, cloned into a baculovirus expression vector, and expressed in insect cells under control of the polyhedrin promoter. Soluble proteins extracted from insect cells were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B). In infected insect cells, a cross-reactive protein was detected at about 95 kDa, which did not occur in uninfected control cells. Crude, desalted extracts were assayed for enzymatic activity with various combinations of donor and acceptor substrates (Table II). Transferase activity was only observed with those substrates which were also utilized by the protein purified from pea seeds. No transferase activities was detected in uninfected control cells grown under identical conditions (data not shown). Collectively, these results demonstrate that the cloned cDNA encodes a functional stachyose synthase with a substrate specificity comparable to its natural, purified counterpart.Table IISubstrate specificity of pea stachyose synthaseGalactosyl donorAcceptorRelative activityPurified seed proteinRecombinant protein%GalactinolRaffinose100.0100.0GalactinolStachyose12.113.7GalactinolSucroseND2-aND, not detected.NDGalactinold-Pinitol (1d-3-O-methyl-chiro-inositol)11.214.7GalactinolSequoyitol (5-O-methyl-myo-inositol)156.6154.5Galactinold-Ononitol (1d-4-O-methyl-myo-inositol)144.6142.2GalactinolH2O2-bHydrolytic activity estimated by the amount of galactose formed.17.7NA2-cNA, not analyzed.Galactosyl ononitolRaffinose65.854.2Galactosyl ononitolStachyose9.9NAStachyoseStachyose4.44.2StachyoseH2O5.9NARaffinoseRaffinoseNDNDRaffinoseH2O0.2NARates of galactosyl transfer reactions and hydrolysis of substrates were determined in reaction mixtures containing substrates at a concentration of 10 mm.2-a ND, not detected.2-b Hydrolytic activity estimated by the amount of galactose formed.2-c NA, not analyzed. Open table in a new tab Rates of galactosyl transfer reactions and hydrolysis of substrates were determined in reaction mixtures containing substrates at a concentration of 10 mm. A range of galactosyl acceptors were utilized by pea stachyose synthase when assayed in the presence of galactinol (Table II). Besides raffinose and stachyose, methylated inositol derivatives (d-ononitol,d-pinitol, and sequoyitol) were utilized, yielding galactosyl ononitol, galactopinitol A, and a galactosyl sequoyitol, respectively. The resulting galactosyl derivatives in turn could be utilized as donors for galactosyl transfer to raffinose and to stachyose, as shown for galactosyl ononitol in Table II. No transfer from galactinol to sucrose was observed, indicating that the protein is not able to initiate the biosynthesis of raffinose oligosaccharides. Likewise, no formation of stachyose was detected in the presence of raffinose as the sole substrate. When the enzyme was incubated with galactinol and verbascose, low amounts of a product were detected by HPAEC-PAD. Judged from its retention time, it appeared to be ajugose, the hexasaccharide of the raffinose series. No standard was available to confirm the identity of this reaction product. In addition to galactosyl transfer reactions, the purified protein was able to hydrolyze the terminal galactose residue of its substrates, although hydrolytic activities were generally low compared with the rate of the transfer reaction from galactinol to raffinose (Table II). Due to contaminating endogenous α-galactosidase activity in lysates of insect cells, no attempts were made to determine the values for hydrolytic activities of the crude recombinant protein. When assayed in Na-phosphate/citrate buffers, pH 4.0–8.5, the transfer reactions from galactinol to raffinose and to stachyose had an optimum at pH 7.0 (data not shown). Likewise, the rate of self-transfer from stachyose to stachyose was highest at pH 7.0, as previously shown for a crude enzyme preparation from pea seeds (16Peterbauer T. Lahuta L.B. Blöchl A. Mucha J. Jones D.A. Hedley C.L. Gòrecki R.J. Richter A. Plant Physiol. 2001; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The steady-state kinetics of stachyose synthesis were analyzed in the presence of nonsaturating concentrations of galactinol and raffinose (Fig. 3). A double reciprocal plot of the data yielded a set of parallel lines, suggesting that a double-displacement (ping-pong) catalytic mechanism was operative. In this mechanism, a putative glycosyl-enzyme intermediate is formed and the first product (myo-inositol) is released before the acceptor forms a complex with the enzyme. The initial velocity of the transfer reaction may thus be described by the initial rate equation for a double displacement mechanism, v=V[Gol][Raf]KGol[Raf]+KRaf[Gol]+[Gol][Raf]Equation 1 where [Gol] and [Raf] are the concentrations of galactinol and raffinose, respectively, V is the maximum value ofv, and KGol andKRaf are Michaelis constants for galactinol and raffinose, respectively. Fitting the data from Fig. 3 to Equation 1gave values of 13.9 ± 0.9 and 21.1 ± 1.3 mm forKGol and KRaf, respectively. A value of 33.7 ± 1.1 nkat/mg of protein was obtained for V. Further support for a double-displacement mechanism came from product inhibition studies withmyo-inositol. A double-reciprocal plot of the initial velocity versus the concentration of raffinose at several fixed concentrations of myo-inositol and a fixed subsaturating concentration of galactinol gave lines intersecting at the y axis, indicative of competitive inhibition with respect to raffinose (Fig.4A). An apparent competitive inhibition constant of 2.3 ± 0.2 mm was obtained formyo-inositol as described elsewhere (27Cleland W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 67: 173-187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mixed inhibition was observed with galactinol as the variable substrate assayed at a fixed subsaturating concentration of raffinose (Fig. 4B), with apparent competitive and uncompetitive inhibition constants of 4.1 ± 0.6 and 9.2 ± 0.7 mm, respectively. This product inhibition pattern excludes reaction mechanisms involving ternary complexes (i.e. ordered and rapid equilibrium random mechanisms) (28Cleland W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 67: 104-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A double-reciprocal plot of the initial velocity of the transfer reaction from stachyose to stachyose versus the concentration of stachyose revealed a nonlinear pattern, while almost linear lines were obtained when galactinol was additionally present at fixed concentrations (Fig.5A). Likewise, release of galactose (Fig. 5B) and raffinose (not shown) displayed complex, nonhyperbolic dependence on the concentration of the s"

To elucidate the function of the potato 13-lipoxygenase H1 (LOX H1), we have generated transgenic potato plants with reduced expression of the LOX H1 gene as a consequence of co-suppression-mediated gene silencing. Three independent LOXH1-silenced transgenic lines were obtained, having less than 1% of the LOX H1 protein present in wild-type plants. This depletion of LOX H1 has no effect on the basal or wound-induced levels of jasmonates derived from 13-hydroperoxylinolenic acid. However, LOX H1 depletion results in a marked reduction in the production of volatile aliphatic C6 aldehydes. These compounds are involved in plant defense responses, acting as either signaling molecules for wound-induced gene expression or as antimicrobial substances. LOX H1 protein was localized to the chloroplast and the protein, expressed in Escherichia coli, showed activity toward unesterified linoleic and linolenic acids and plastidic phosphatidylglycerol. The results demonstrate that LOX H1 is a specific isoform involved in the generation of volatile defense and signaling compounds through the HPL branch of the octadecanoid pathway.

C18 unsaturated fatty acids, linoleic acid (18:2Δ9,12) and linolenic acid (18:3Δ9,12,15), are major LOX substrates in plants. The lipoxygenase pathway of fatty acid metabolism (1Vick B.A. Moore T.S. Lipid Metabolism in Plants. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993: 167-191Google Scholar) is initiated by the addition of molecular oxygen at the C9 or C13 position of the acyl chain yielding the corresponding 9- and 13-hydroperoxides (2Rosahl S. Z. Naturfosch. 1996; C51: 123-138Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Both 9- and 13-hydroperoxides can subsequently be cleaved to short-chain oxoacids and aldehydes by the action of hydroperoxide lyases (HPL) or, alternatively, the 13-hydroperoxide is converted, after enzymatic cyclization, reduction, and β-oxidation, to JA (3León J. Sánchez-Serrano J.J. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1999; 37: 373-380Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Plant LOXs are ubiquitous and encoded by multigene families (4Siedow J.N. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 42: 145-188Crossref Scopus (706) Google Scholar). The presence in a given tissue of several LOX isoforms with different substrate preferences, kinetic parameters, stereospecificity in substrate oxygenation, pH dependence, and subcellular localization makes difficult the assignment of specific functions to each LOX isoform. Moreover, LOX expression in plants is regulated throughout development and in response to stress (5Bell E. Mullet J.E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 230: 456-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 6Bell E. Mullet J.E. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 1133-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Different LOX isoforms may have different physiological roles; they may, on the one hand, be responsible for the production of signals involved in the regulation of plant growth and the activation of stress-induced defense responses, whereas, on the other, the products of LOX activity may exert a direct deterring function toward pests and/or pathogens. It has been proposed that some aldehydes, in particular hexanal and hexenals produced by the action of HPL on LOX-derived fatty acid hydroperoxides, may be involved in the interaction between plants and pathogens or parasites (7Croft K.P.C.

Three LOX gene families have been characterized in potato;LOX1 is mainly expressed in tubers and roots, whereasLOX2 and LOX3 are expressed in leaves and are wound- and JA-inducible (18Geerts A. Feltkamp D. Rosahl S. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 19Royo J. Vancanneyt G. Pérez A.G. Sanz C. Störmann K. Rosahl S. Sánchez-Serrano J.J. J. Biol.

LOX2 and LOX3 families are represented each by a single cDNA, LOX H1 and LOX H3, respectively, encoding proteins with 13-LOX activity (19Royo J. Vancanneyt G. Pérez A.G. Sanz C. Störmann K.

LOX genes with a high degree of sequence similarity to potato LOX H1 andH3 have been identified in tomato (20Heitz T. Bergey D.R. Ryan C.A. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 1085-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The expression of the LOX H3 homologue (TomLoxD) was induced in the leaves of tomato plants by wounding and methyl jasmonate, following time courses similar to its potato counterpart. The expression of the tomato LOX H1 homologue (TomLoxC) was shown to be constitutive in fruits but, in contrast to potato, it was not detected in either wounded or nondamaged leaves. Both antisense and co-suppression-mediated depletion of LOXgenes have proved useful tools to elucidate the function of specific LOX isoforms and their corresponding products in defense signaling. InArabidopsis, co-suppression-mediated depletion of a specific LOX isoform led to a reduction in the wound-induced accumulation of JA (21Bell E. Creelman R.A. Mullet J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8675-8679Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). On the other hand, antisense-mediated depletion of LOXgene expression has successfully been used to establish the involvement of a LOX isoform in the incompatibility trait of a tobacco variety resistant to the fungus Phytophthora parasitica (22Rancé I. Fournier J. Esquerré-Tugayé M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Here we report a transgenic approach to elucidate the functional role of LOX H1 in growth and development of potato plants, and to assess its potential role in the response to mechanical damage. We have generated transgenic lines expressing the complete LOX H1 cDNA under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter. Three transgenic lines that have undergone silencing of the transgene expression and co-suppression of the endogenous LOX H1 gene, have been characterized in terms of plant development and wound-induced changes in gene expression patterns. Potato plants (Solanum tuberosum cv. Desireé) were grown in soil either in the greenhouse or in growth chambers at 22 °C under a 16-h light/8-h darkness photoperiod. Plants were transformed as described (24Keil M. Sánchez-Serrano J.J. Willmitzer L. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1323-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) by cocultivation with Agrobacterium tumefaciensharboring, in the BIN19 vector (25Bevan M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 8711-8721Crossref PubMed Scopus (1813) Google Scholar), the complete LOX H1 cDNA (19Royo J. Vancanneyt G. Pérez A.G. Sanz C. Störmann K. Rosahl S. Sánchez-Serrano J.J.

Plant transformants were selected for resistance to 50 mg/liter kanamycin (Sigma) and, after rooting, transferred to soil and grown as described above. Selected transformed lines were propagated vegetatively by either tuber sowing or explant cuttings. When indicated, potato leaves were wounded as described previously (19Royo J. Vancanneyt G. Pérez A.G. Sanz C. Störmann K. Rosahl S. Sánchez-Serrano J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21012-21019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and plant material harvested at the indicated times after wounding. Total RNA isolation and Northern blot techniques were performed as described previously (19Royo J. Vancanneyt G. Pérez A.G. Sanz C. Störmann K. Rosahl S. Sánchez-Serrano J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21012-21019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Quantitation of PIN2 and LOX H3 RNAs was done by densitometry of autoradiograms derived of four independent experiments, using the Molecular Analyst program (Bio-Rad). Protein was extracted in 0.1m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2, containing 20% (v/v) glycerol, and electrophoretically separated in 10% PAGE gels under denaturing conditions (26Dammann C. Rojo E. Sánchez-Serrano J.J. Plant J. 1997; 11: 773-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Separated proteins were then transferred to ECL-nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), and subsequently hybridized with rabbit antibodies raised against LOX H1 protein or a specific peptide of LOX H3 as described previously (23Royo J. León J. Vancanneyt G. Albar J.P. Rosahl S. Ortego F. Castañera P. Sánchez-Serrano J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1146-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), or against proteinase inhibitor 2 (kindly donated by Prof. Clarence A. Ryan, Washington State University, Pullman, WA). A peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit antibody was used to detect immunoreactive proteins by the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Twenty grams of potato leaves were harvested and directly homogenized in a blender in 200 ml of ice-cold extraction buffer (0.35 m sorbitol, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The homogenate was filtered through two layers of Miracloth (Calbiochem) and centrifuged (1000 × g) for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was gently resuspended with a paint brush in 5 ml of ice-cold suspension buffer (0.3 m sorbitol, 20 mm Tricine-KOH, pH 7.6, 5 mm Mg2Cl, 2.5 mm EDTA), and poured onto a Percoll (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) gradient, prepared on the previous day as follows; 30 ml of 50% Percoll in suspension buffer were centrifuged 30 min at 43,000 × g at 4 °C and kept overnight at 4 °C in the centrifuge tubes. Separation of a layer with intact chloroplasts was achieved after 10 min of centrifugation at 13,200 × g at 4 °C in a HB-6 rotor (Sorvall). The chloroplast layer was carefully withdrawn with a glass pipette, and the chloroplasts washed in 20 ml of ice-cold suspension buffer. After 10 min of centrifugation at 2000 ×g at 4 °C, the chloroplasts in the pellet were lysed in 1 ml of TE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mmEDTA), and protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Wounded and nonwounded leaflets of potato leaves, from wild-type and LOXH1-co-suppressed transgenic plants, were fixed by vacuum infiltration of square pieces (5 mm/side) with a 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde solution in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2, and then thoroughly washed three times with water. After fixation, leaf samples were progressively dehydrated by incubating for 1 h at room temperature in 30, 50, 70, 85, and 100% (v/v) ethanol. Dehydrated tissue was treated twice with xylene for 1 h each and then embedded in molten warm paraffin overnight at 42 °C. Paraffin blocks, containing tissue samples, were formed by decreasing temperature and subsequently used to cut strips of 8-μm sections with a microtome (Leica). Sections were laid on 2% triethoxysilyl-propylamino-treated glass microscope slides for further processing. Before immunolocalization procedure, tissue sections were deparaffinized by immersion twice in xylene and then thoroughly washed with TBS. Sections were blocked by incubation in TBS containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 for 3 h at room temperature. After washing three times with TBS containing 0.1% (v/v) bovine serum albumin and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (washing buffer), sections were incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of antibody against LOX H1 in washing buffer for 1.5 h. After three new rounds of washing as described above, tissue sections were incubated in a high humidity closed plastic chamber with 0.1 ml of a 1:40 dilution of a 5-μm gold particle-coupled anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma) in washing buffer for 1 h. Gold-labeled proteins were then treated with a silver enhancing kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) as described by the manufacturers. Labeled proteins were observed and photographed by using a Nikon microscope equipped with an IGS filter that allows detection of epipolarized fluorescence. Twenty-four discs were cut with a 5-mm cork borer from different leaves of potato plants, and immediately stored in liquid N2. Endogenous volatiles were quantified in quadruplicate by placing 24 leaf discs in an 11-ml vial containing 2.1 ml of saturated CaCl2 solution. The vial was then transferred into an automatic headspace sampler (Hewlett-Packard 19395A), where a 20-min equilibrium time at 80 °C was set to allow endogenous volatiles to enter the gas phase. The volatiles were determined by gas liquid chromatography in a gas chromatograph (Hewlett-Packard 5890-II) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a glass column (2 mm × 1 m) containing 5% Carbowax 20 M on 60/80 Carbopack B as the stationary phase. Column temperature was held isothermally at 120 °C, injector at 150 °C, and detector at 250 °C. Carrier gas (N2) flow rate was 35 ml/min. Quantitation was performed by conversion of peak areas into nanomoles produced by the 24 leaf discs in 30 min by means of calibration curves obtained for the different compounds. Jasmonate contents in nonwounded and damaged leaves were determined by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described (23Royo J. León J. Vancanneyt G. Albar J.P. Rosahl S. Ortego F. Castañera P. Sánchez-Serrano J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1146-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). LOX H1 synthesis in BL21E. coli cells and assays for LOX activity were essentially performed as described (19Royo J. Vancanneyt G. Pérez A.G. Sanz C. Störmann K. Rosahl S. Sánchez-Serrano J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21012-21019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) with the exception that 20% glycerol and 0.01 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were included in the buffer. LOX activity was determined spectrophotometrically by monitoring the increase in A234 resulting from conjugated diene formation from exogenously supplied lipid substrates containing polyunsaturated fatty acids provided as unesterified compounds or esterified to complex lipids extracted from potato leaf as described below. Typical assays contained 2–10 μl of bacterial lysate supernatant, fatty acid, or complex lipid substrate (10–50 nmol, in ethanol, 0.01% final concentration) in 100 mmsodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, at 25 °C. Extractions were performed using chilled solvents and glassware at 4 °C. Lipids were extracted from 2 g of fresh leaf material in chloroform/methanol/0.15 m acetic acid (10/20/7.7, v/v) in a pestle and mortar and then an additional 10 ml of chloroform and 10 ml of water were added to achieve phase separation. The lower chloroform phase containing the complex lipids was removed and reduced to dryness under nitrogen. The residue was resuspended in a small volume of chloroform and the complex lipids separated by TLC in a chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (170/30/20/7, v/v). For quantitation, the complex lipids were transmethylated in situ in the silica gel using 2.5% sulfuric acid in methanol and the resulting methyl esters extracted into hexane and analyzed by GC using heptadecanoic acid as internal standard (27Griffiths G. Leverentz M. Silkowski H. Gill N. Sanchez-Serrano J.J. J. Exp. Bot. 2000; 51: 1363-1370Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the preparation of lipid substrates for studies on LOX H1, after TLC, the lipids were eluted from the silica gel using the following solvents: acetone (100%) for DGDG, chloroform/acetone (50/50, v/v) for MGDG, chloroform/methanol (80/20, v/v) for PE, and chloroform/methanol (50/50, v/v) for PG and PC (28Christie W.W. Lipid Analysis.2nd Ed. Pergamon Press, Oxford1982Google Scholar). For larger scale production of PG, complex lipids were extracted from 10 g of tissue and fractionated using DEAE column chromatography (28Christie W.W. Lipid Analysis.2nd Ed. Pergamon Press, Oxford1982Google Scholar). The authenticity of PG was verified by TLC purification and GC analysis confirming the presence of its characteristic fatty acid, 16:1 (trans-3). The lipids were dried under nitrogen and resuspended in ethanol and stored under an atmosphere of nitrogen at −20 °C until required. Previously we have cloned and characterized a systemically induced 13-lipoxygenase (LOX H1) from potato leaves that is transcriptionally up-regulated in both wounded and nondamaged tissues (19Royo J. Vancanneyt G. Pérez A.G. Sanz C. Störmann K. Rosahl S. Sánchez-Serrano J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21012-21019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). To ascertain the functional role of LOX H1, overexpression of theLOX H1 gene in transgenic potato plants was undertaken using a full cDNA under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter. Forty-eight independent transgenic lines were generated, and their basal level of LOX H1 transcript was compared with that of wild-type plants. Three of these lines (lines 9, 31, and 33) had much reduced LOX H1 transcript levels in nonwounded leaves (Fig. 1A), which was suggestive of silencing or co-suppression of both transgene and endogenous gene expression. We tested whether silencing of LOXH1 gene in co-suppressed plants also affected its wound-induced expression. Local and systemic induction of LOX H1expression upon wounding was detected in wild-type plants but was almost completely suppressed in the three transgenic lines analyzed (Fig. 1B). We also tested whether LOX H1 silencing affects the expression of LOX H3, another wound-inducible 13-lipoxygenase from potato leaves (19Royo J. Vancanneyt G. Pérez A.G. Sanz C. Störmann K. Rosahl S. Sánchez-Serrano J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21012-21019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 23Royo J. León J. Vancanneyt G. Albar J.P. Rosahl S. Ortego F. Castañera P. Sánchez-Serrano J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1146-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Fig.2A shows that LOXH3 expression is induced upon wounding in the LOXH1-co-suppressed lines. Although in these plants LOX H3 transcript levels were lower than in the wild-type ones, the level of induction ofLOX H3 gene expression in wild-type and co-suppressed plants was similar because of its lower basal transcription in the latter (Fig. 2B). However, the wound-induced accumulation of proteinase inhibitor 2 (PIN2) transcript was reduced in allLOX H1-co-suppressed lines (Fig. 2A). A more detailed analysis of line 31, the one showing the lowest LOX H1 levels (see below), revealed that wound-induced PIN2 transcript accumulation is similar up to 6 h but significantly lower at long times after wounding (24 and 48 h; Fig. 2B). These data indicate that LOX H1 is involved in signaling the wound-dependentPIN2 activation. The severely reduced accumulation of LOX H1 transcript in the co-suppressed plants prompted us to evaluate to what extent gene silencing had also led to a reduced accumulation of the corresponding protein product. Fig. 3A shows that, despite the increase in LOX H1 transcript accumulation observed upon mechanical damage, LOX H1 protein levels were not up-regulated in wounded leaves and remained nearly constant within the time frame analyzed, probably reflecting a balance between increase in transcription rate and protein turnover. Alternatively, translation of LOX H1 transcripts accumulating upon wounding may be delayed or inefficient within the time frame analyzed. Transgenic lines 9, 31, and 33, which did not accumulate LOX H1 transcript upon wounding (Figs.1B and 2), had undetectable levels of protein whereas strong expression was seen in extracts from wild type plants (Fig.3A). Only after long exposure times were residual levels of a cross-reacting protein detected in extracts from wounded leaves of co-suppressed plants. Quantitation of these residual levels indicated that line 33 had some 50 times less LOX H1 protein than wild-type plants by 24 h after wounding (Fig. 3B). Silencing of LOX H1 gene expression was more efficient in lines 9 and 31. The levels of LOX H1 protein in the wounded leaves of these lines were at least 100 times lower than in wild-type plants (Fig. 3B). In agreement with the levels determined for their corresponding transcripts, the reduced levels of LOX H1 protein in co-suppressed plants did not affect the levels of LOX H3 protein and resulted in a slight reduction of PIN2 protein levels (Fig. 3A). LOX H1 gene silencing in leaves of the co-suppressed transgenic line 31 appears to be subject to developmental regulation, as indicated by the analysis of LOX H1 protein contents in the foliage, from actively growing apical leaves to adult fully expanded ones. In contrast to wild-type plants in which, as shown in Fig. 4, LOX H1 is constitutively present at similar levels in leaves at different developmental stages,LOX H1 gene expression appears to be silenced in fully expanded leaves (Fig. 4, lanes 3–7, #31 leaf) but only partially suppressed in actively growing, developing leaves (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 3,#31 leaf) of line 31. LOX H1 gene is also expressed in flowers from potato plants (19Royo J. Vancanneyt G. Pérez A.G. Sanz C. Störmann K. Rosahl S. Sánchez-Serrano J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21012-21019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and the levels of protein do not change significantly at different stages of flower development (Fig. 4). We observed that gene silencing also occurred in the flowers of co-suppressed plants and was maintained throughout flower development (only shown for line 31). The pattern and levels of LOX H1 expression suggested that it may have a function in plant development. Indeed, lines 9 and 31 have shorter internodes than wild-type plants, and smaller leaves, and branched and bushy plant shoots in which the axillary buds sprouted often (data not shown). As this altered phenotype is present in two independent co-suppressed lines, it likely relates to LOX H1 depletion and not to the result of somatic variations arising during the transformation procedure. However, line 33 did not exhibit any of these differences, perhaps because of its higher content in LOX H1 relative to lines 9 and 31. No alteration was observed in the root system of LOX H1-co-suppressed plants (data not shown). We also analyzed the production of tubers in wild-type and co-suppressed plants. Plants either grown from tubers or from explants were able to tuberize, and the total yield and number of tubers per plant in wild-type and co-suppressed plants were not significantly different (data not shown). Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of LOX H1 protein prompted the suggestion that LOX H1 gene product should be localized inside chloroplasts (19Royo J. Vancanneyt G. Pérez A.G. Sanz C. Störmann K. Rosahl S. Sánchez-Serrano J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21012-21019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). We have now addressed the localization of LOX H1 by immunohistological techniques. The results shown in Fig.5 indicate that, indeed, LOX H1 protein specifically accumulates in chloroplasts both in nonwounded and in damaged potato leaves (Fig. 5, C–F) and also that no LOX H1 protein was detected in leaves of the co-suppressed line 31 (Fig. 5,G and H). The specific detection of LOX H1 protein was confirmed using the pre-immune serum that gave no signal in the immunolocalization procedure (Fig. 5, A andB). No LOX H1 protein outside the chloroplasts was detected in palisade parenchyma cells nor was it detected in epidermal cells (shown in the 100-fold magnification of Fig. 5, I andJ). Consistent with the data obtained in Western-type experiments (Fig. 3), no major wound-induced changes in LOX H1 protein amount were observed (compare panels Dand F in Fig. 5). Chloroplastic localization of LOX H1 was confirmed by isolating intact chloroplasts from potato leaves and Western blot techniques (Fig.6). As expected, chloroplasts isolated from the LOX H1-co-suppresed line 31 had a much reduced content of LOX H1 protein. It is generally assumed that the substrates for LOX are unesterified polyunsaturated fatty acids released from complex lipids by the action of lipases and recently a role for phospholipase A2 acting on PC, analogous to mammals, has been proposed in plants (29Conconi A. Miquel M. Browse J.A. Ryan C.A. Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 797-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 30Narváez-Vásquez J. Florin-Christensen J. Ryan C.A. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2249-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). However, LOX activity toward complex lipids has also been reported (4Siedow J.N. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 42: 145-188Crossref Scopus (706) Google Scholar). In potato leaves the major complex lipids present are the galactolipids, MGDG (58.6 ± 1.5%) and DGDG (24.8 ± 1.4%), with the three main phospholipids being PC (7.6 ± 1.1%), PE (4.4 ± 0.6%), and PG (4.4 ± 0.9%). PC and PE are predominantly found in the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas PG is the only phospholipid exclusively synthesized and located within the chloroplast (31Ohlrogge J Browse J. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). All complex lipids contained significant levels of 18:3, the fatty acid precursor of JA although 16:3, the precursor of dinor-JA (32Weber H. Vick B.A. Farmer E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10473-10478Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) was a major acyl constituent in only MGDG and PG (TableI). These major complex lipids were purified from potato leaves in s"

The latter observation has led to the suggestion that MH, heat stroke, and exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis might have a common denominator (2Denborough M.

Approximately 50% of MH families have mutations in the RYR1 gene, and mutations have been reported in other loci (for recent reviews, see Refs. 11Jurkat-Rott K. McCarthy T. Lehmann-Horn F.

The ryanodine receptors are large tetrameric oligomers that function as intracellular calcium release channels. Three different isoforms have been identified at the molecular level: type 1 (RYR1), which is preferentially expressed in skeletal muscle; type 2, which is in the heart and cerebellum; and type 3, which is in the central nervous system as well as in a variety of other tissues (13Takeshima H.

Activation causes the channel to open and thus to a transient calcium flow from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, leading to an increase in the calcium concentration of the myoplasm. In B-lymphocytes Ca2+ signaling has been implicated in various physiological responses such as cell proliferation, gene expression, and antibody secretion (22Yamada H. June C.H. Finkelman F. Brunswick M. Ring M.S. Lees A. Mond J.J. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1613-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In a recent report, Seiet al. (23Sei Y. Gallagher K.L. Basile A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5995-6002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) have presented evidence supporting the existence of RYR1 in B-lymphocytes. Thus, in this cell type, changes in the [Ca2+]i may be under the control of both the inositol trisphosphate receptor and the RYR1. B-lymphocytes are capable of responding to and producing several cytokines among which IL-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (24Roitt I. Brostoff J. Male D. Mosby S. Immunology. 4th Ed. Times Mirror International Publisher, Hong Kong1996: 169-171Google Scholar), although what controls cytokine release is not fully understood. IL-1 is a mediator of the host inflammatory response in innate immunity and stimulates other cell types such as macrophages and endothelial cells to synthesize and secrete other cytokines. When released in large quantities, IL-1 causes fever, i.e. it is an endogenous pyrogen and can induce the synthesis of acute phase plasma proteins and initiate metabolic wasting (25Gelfand J.A. Dinarello C.A. Braunwald E. Fauci A.S. Kasper D.L. Hauser S.L. Longo D.L. Jameson J.L. Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine. 15th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 90-94Google Scholar). Because of the different clinical symptoms during an MH episode, we were interested in establishing whether there is a link between IL-1 release and malignant hyperthermia. The results of the present study raise the possibility that some of the symptoms seen during an MH episode may be the result of IL-1 production. fura-2/AM, 1,2-bis (2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester) (BAPTA/AM), thapsigargin, and peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG were from Sigma; cDNA synthesis system kit, DNA isolation kit from mammalian blood,Taq polymerase, and BM chemiluminescence kit were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. RNA isolation kit was from Biotecx Laboratories (Houston, TX). DNA-modifying enzymes were from New England Biolabs. Human IL-1β and IL-6 ELISA kits were from CLB (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Cyclosporin A was from Novartis (Basel, Switzerland). Nitrocellulose and Ficoll-Hypaque were from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. Caffeine was from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany); 4-chloro-m-cresol was from Fluka Chemicals (Buchs, Switzerland). Tissue culture media and reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. All other chemicals were reagent or of the highest available grade. after informed consent whole blood was collected in EDTA-treated tubes from 4 healthy volunteers and from 4 patients who had undergone a diagnostic skeletal muscle biopsy to determine malignant hyperthermia susceptibility and were known to carry the MH-associated V2168M mutation. Mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation. For infection with Epstein-Barr virus, mononuclear cells were exposed to supernatants of the B95.8 cell line in the presence of cyclosporin A and IL-6, according to standard procedures. Cells were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 100 units of penicillin and streptomycin. The presence of the MH-linked V2168M RYR1 gene mutation in selected patients from four unrelated families was determined by DNA PCR amplification, followed by restriction enzyme digestion. Genomic DNA was isolated using a DNA isolation kit for mammalian blood. Total RNA was isolated using an RNA isolation kit; poly(A+) RNA was converted into cDNA using a cDNA synthesis system kit following the instructions provided by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, catalog no. 1117831). Approximately 100 ng of DNA were used for each PCR amplification using a GeneAmp2400 thermocycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The following primers were used to amplify genomic DNA and cDNA: forward, 5′-GGG CCC AAG AGG ACT TCG TGC; reverse, 5′-GCC CCC GAG GAC GTT GAC CAT. Amplification conditions were: 5 min, 95 °C followed by 35 cycles for genomic DNA or 40 cycles for cDNA: 30-s annealing at 60 °C, 45-s extension at 72 °C, 30-s denaturation at 92 °C, and extension for 4 min at 72 °C. The presence of the mutation was detected by restriction enzyme digestion using Msl I. Total microsomes were isolated from rabbit brain, heart, and EBV-transformed B-lymphocytes as described previously (20Zorzato F. Scutari E. Tegazzin V. Clementi E. Treves S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1192-1201PubMed Google Scholar) and stored in liquid nitrogen. Terminal cisternae were isolated from the white muscle of New Zealand White rabbits as described by Saitoet al. (26Saito A. Seiler S. Chu A. Fleischer S. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated on a 6% SDS-PAGE transferred onto nitrocellulose and probed with a monoclonal antibody specific for type 1 RYR (27Benacquista B.L. Sharma M.R. Samso M. Zorzato F. Treves S. Wagenknecht T. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1349-1358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG was used to detect the primary antibody followed by chemiluminescence. changes in the intracellular calcium concentration of the EBV-transformed B-lymphocyte cell lines were monitored with the fluorescent calcium indicator fura-2/AM (final concentration, 5 μm) as described (20Zorzato F. Scutari E. Tegazzin V. Clementi E. Treves S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1192-1201PubMed Google Scholar, 28Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol.

Fluorescent changes (ratio 340/380 nm) were measured in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences spectrofluorometer equipped with a magnetic stirrer and thermostated at 37 °C. All measurements were made in Ca2+-free Krebs-Ringer containing 0.5 mm EGTA. Peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes were placed in the wells of a microtiter plate in Krebs-Ringer solution and incubated 37 °C for 60 min under the specified conditions. For experiments in which the [Ca2+]i was to be buffered, cells were pre-incubated with 50 μm of the calcium chelator BAPTA/AM for 30 min in Ca2+-free Krebs-Ringer. Cells were then washed with Ca2+-free Krebs-Ringer medium and treated as indicated. After 60 min, cells were centrifuged and the amount of IL-1β (or IL-6) released into the supernatant was determined by using the CLB PeliKine Compact indirect ELISA kit following the manufacturer’s instructions. All tests were performed in triplicate. For the two group comparisons, Student’st test was used; three or more groups were compared by one-way ANOVA. Dose-response measurements were compared by repeated measurement ANOVA. Where ANOVA revealed a significant difference, the Fisher protect least significant difference post hoc test was performed. The overall statistical significance level was set to 5%. StatView™ from SAS Institute Inc. was used for statistical analysis. The EBV-transformed B-cell lines were assessed for the presence of type 1 RYR using a monoclonal antibody we previously developed and characterized (27Benacquista B.L. Sharma M.R. Samso M. Zorzato F. Treves S. Wagenknecht T. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1349-1358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows that an immunopositive high molecular weight band is present in the microsomal fraction obtained from the EBV-immortalized B-lymphocytes (lane 4). The antibody failed to react with type 2 RYR, which is present in heart microsomes (lane 2), or with any high molecular weight protein present in the microsomal fraction of rabbit brain (lane 3). The antibody reacted strongly with the RYR present in rabbit skeletal muscle terminal cisternae, a fraction that is highly enriched in this protein (lane 1). Having determined that the B-cell lines do indeed express RYR 1, we performed RT-PCR analysis to confirm the presence of the mutated cDNA in cells derived from patients carrying the V2168M RYR1 mutation. Fig. 2 shows a polyacrylamide gel of the PCR-amplified genomic DNA (panel A) and cDNA (panel B) from EBV-immortalized B-lymphocytes. The primers used span exons 39–40, and the presence of the mutation V2168M creates a restriction site for the enzymeMsl I. Amplification of genomic DNA and cDNA yields fragments of ∼1400 bp (panel A,lanes 1 and 3) and 338 bp (panel B, lanes 1 and 3), respectively. Digestion of the PCR-amplified genomic DNA with Msl I gives rise to a band of ∼192 bp (panel A, lanes 2 and 4). An extra band of ∼196 bp (*) is present after digestion of the amplified genomic DNA from EBV-immortalized cells from a patient carrying the V2168M mutation (panel A,lane 4). Digestion of the PCR-amplified cDNA fragment with Msl I yielded no additional bands when RT-PCR was performed on cDNA obtained from EBV-immortalized cells from a healthy volunteer (panel B, lane 2). On the other hand, digestion of the PCR amplified cDNA obtained from EBV-immortalized cells from a patient carrying the V2168M, with Msl I, yielded two bands of ∼146 and 192 bp (panel B, lane 4). We next tested the sensitivity of EBV-immortalized B-cell lines from healthy controls and from the 4 MHS subjects carrying the V2168M RYR1 gene mutation, to the RYR-activator 4-chloro-m-cresol. This compound has been shown to activate type 1 and 2 RYR in isolated muscle vesicles but has no effect on type 3 RYR (20Zorzato F. Scutari E. Tegazzin V. Clementi E. Treves S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1192-1201PubMed Google Scholar, 29Herrmann-Frank A. Richter M. Sarkozi S. Mohr U. Lehmann-Horn F. Biochim. Biophys.

Fig.3 A shows that the addition of 300 μm 4-chloro-m-cresol causes an increase in the [Ca2+]i of the B-cells. This effect is abolished by pre-treatment with thapsigargin an inhibitor of SERCA type CaATPase, indicating that the intracellular stores that are endowed with the RYR also contain this ATPase (Fig. 3 B). We also tested the specificity of 4-chloro-m-cresol by adding it to HL60 cells, a human myelomonocytoid cell line. In this case treatment with 4-chloro-m-cresol failed to elicit release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (Fig. 3 C), confirming the specificity of this agonist and the lack of functional RYR1 calcium release channels in this myelomonocytoid cell line. Malignant hyperthermia has been shown to affect the functional characteristics of the skeletal muscle calcium release channel; in particular, most mutations in the RYR1 gene cause a shift in the dose-response curve to RYR agonists, to a lower agonist concentration. Therefore, we examined the dose-response curve of 4-chloro-m-cresol-induced calcium release from intracellular stores of EBV-immortalized lymphocytes from the 4 MHS individuals carrying the V2168M mutation in the RYR channel. We first calculated the size of the thapsigargin-sensitive calcium pools; the mean (± S.D.) change in fluorescence was 0.87 (± 0.19, n = 11) fluorescence units, for controls and 0.74 (± 0.13, n = 20) fluorescence units for cells carrying the V2168M mutation. Fig. 4shows a representative trace of the peak [Ca2+]i induced by 400 nm thapsigargin. Considering the small day-to-day variations in the experimental conditions and potential differences linked to the use of different cell lines however, we normalized our results by calculating the mean increase in [Ca2+]i induced by different 4-chloro-m-cresol concentrations, as a percentage of the total amount of calcium released by 400 nm thapsigargin. We next performed a dose-response curve to 4-chloro-m-cresol by averaging the mean amount of calcium released from each of the cell lines established from the 4 patients harboring the V2168M mutation and from the 4 healthy volunteers. Our results show that the capacity of 4-chloro-m-cresol to induce Ca2+ release was significantly different in the EBV-immortalized B-cells from control and MHS individuals (Fig. 5; repeated measurement ANOVA, p = 0.018) and the EC50for 4-chloro-m-cresol was shifted from 750 μmin cells from control individuals to 450 μm in cells from MHS individuals.Figure 5EBV-immortalized lymphocytes from MHS individuals carrying the V2168M RYR1 gene mutation are more sensitive to 4-chloro-m-cresol than EBV lymphocytes from control individuals. The increases in [Ca2+]i induced by the indicated concentrations of 4-chloro-m-cresol were calculated as a percentage of the maximal amount which could be released by thapsigargin. Results are expressed as mean (±SD of n = 4–12). The EC50 of 4-chloro-m-cresol-induced increase in [Ca2+]i for EBV-cells from controls was 750 μm whereas that from MHS individuals with the V2168M mutation was 450 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next carried out two sets of experiments: first, we examined whether stimulation of RYR by caffeine and 4-chloro-m-cresol caused the release of IL-1β and IL-6 from the EBV-immortalized B-cell lines. Under our experimental conditions, the amount of cytokines released by these cells was barely detectable. Thus, we examined the effect of RYR agonists on IL-1β and IL-6 release from peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes. We also examined whether the effect of the RYR agonist could be blocked (i) by dantrolene, an inhibitor of the type 1 RYR (32Paul-Pletzer K. Palnitkar S.S. Jimenez L.S. Morimoto H. Parness J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar,33Zhao F. Li P. Chen S.R. Louis C.F. Fruen B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13810-13816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) and (ii) by chelating intracellular calcium ions with BAPTA. We only investigated “early” cytokine release (after 60 min) as the symptoms of an MH crisis almost always occur within the first hour after contact with trigger agents. Experiments were first performed on whole peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes from control individuals. Fig. 6 shows that under our experimental conditions both caffeine (panel A) and 4-chloro-m-cresol (panel B) caused a dose-dependent increase in interleukin production in cells from control individuals; the amount of IL-1β released was ∼5-fold higher than that of IL-6 released. This increase appears to be calcium-dependent because depletion of intracellular calcium stores with BAPTA inhibited the release of IL-1β induced by 10 mm caffeine and 400 μm4-chloro-m-cresol (Fig. 7,crossed boxes). Furthermore, 20 μmdantrolene abolished the stimulation of IL-1β release by 10 mm caffeine and 400 μm4-chloro-m-cresol, supporting the involvement of the RYR Ca2+ channel in this process (Fig. 7, hatched boxes).Figure 7IL-1β release from peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes is calcium-dependent. Cells from 4 normal controls were incubated at 37 °C with 10 mm caffeine or 400 μm 4-chloro-m-cresol (empty boxes), with 10 mm caffeine or 400 μm4-chloro-m-cresol after treatment with 50 μmBAPTA in Ca2+-free medium (crossed boxes) or with 20 μm dantrolene plus 10 mm caffeine or 400 μm 4-chloro-m-cresol (hatched boxes). After 60 min cells were centrifuged and the amount of IL-1β released into the supernatant was determined by ELISA. Results are plotted as % increase (± S.E.) in IL-1β released. Mean spontaneous release by mononuclear leukocytes incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. with carrier alone was 20 pg/106cells and was considered 100%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Finally, we compared the amount of IL-1β released after addition of the two RYR agonists by peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes from 4 healthy donors and 4 individuals carrying the RYR1 MH-linked mutation. Fig. 8 shows the percentage increase in IL-1β released, induced by treating leukocytes with the indicated concentrations of caffeine (panel A) and 4-chloro-m-cresol (panel B) for 60 min at 37 °C. There was considerable between-subject variability in the amount of IL-1β released into the medium. We thus normalized the values by calculating the amount of IL-1β released after incubating the leukocytes from each individual, for 60 min at 37 °C with carrier alone; this value was considered 100%, and the increase in interleukin released by caffeine and 4-chloro-m-cresol was calculated. Repeated measurements ANOVA revealed significant differences in the amount of IL-1β released after addition of caffeine and 4-chloro-m-cresol, between individuals carrying the V2168M mutation and the control group (p = 0.0034 and p = 0.0026, respectively). The clinical signs of an impending MH crisis are highly variable and include muscle rigidity, metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, tachycardia, and an increase in body temperature (1Gronert G. Antonigni J. Pessah I. Miller R.D. Anesthesia. 5th Ed. Churchill Livingstone, New York2000: 1033-1052Google Scholar, 2Denborough M. Lancet. 1998; 352: 1131-1136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Investigations into the molecular mechanism of MH have led to the hypothesis that this is a disorder of skeletal muscle excitation-contraction coupling and that the clinical signs are a result of the hypermetabolic state caused by alterations in the mechanism regulating the myoplasmic calcium concentration. The aim of the present report was to establish whether MH-associated mutations in the RYR1 gene could also be associated with an increase in body temperature via an alteration of thermoregulatory mechanisms. Body temperature is controlled by the thermoregulatory centers localized in the anterior hypothalamus. Increases in body temperature may be caused either (i) by a “peripheral” mechanism, involving an increase of thermogenesis by skeletal muscle contraction (shivering) and/or a decrease of thermodissipation, or (ii) by a central mechanism mediated by endogenous pyrogens. Phagocytic cells produce and release the major endogenous pyrogens IL-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interferon-α, although endothelial cells, fibroblasts, myoblasts, and B-lymphocytes are also capable of producing, among others, IL-α and IL-β. We first carried out a set of experiments to confirm the results of Seiet al. (23Sei Y. Gallagher K.L. Basile A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5995-6002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and unequivocally demonstrate the expression of type 1 RYR in EBV-immortalized B-cell lines. RT-PCR analysis revealed the presence of the mRNA encoding skeletal muscle type 1 RYR in B-lymphocytes. The presence of mRNA strongly suggests but does not necessarily prove the existence of the protein product. This issue was confirmed by immunoblotting, which revealed a protein band referable to the RYR in the microsomal fraction of B-lymphocytes. The expression of type 1 RYR in B-cells was also confirmed by genotype analysis of patients carrying the V2168M mutated RYR1 allele in their B-lymphocytes. The EBV-immortalized B-lymphocytes thus offer an interesting tool to investigate the functional effects of “natural” mutations in the RYR1 gene. To trigger calcium release from the intracellular store of EBV-immortalized B-cells, we used 4-chloro-m-cresol, a RYR type 1-specific agonist, which has been used to characterize MH-linked mutation (34Treves S.

Our results show that EBV-immortalized lymphocytes from normal donors are sensitive to 4-chloro-m-cresol, and that the presence of the V2168M mutation in the RYR1 gene decreases the EC50 of 4-chloro-m-chresol-induced calcium release ∼2-fold (750 μm versus 450 μm for control and MHS-EBV cells, respectively). We would like to point out that the EC50 of 4-chloro-m-cresol-induced calcium release in EBV-transformed lymphocyte is similar to that described previously in other experimental models (34Treves S.

The most interesting result of the present report concerns the involvement of the RYR on IL-1β release from the peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes of MHS and control individuals. Caffeine and 4-chloro-m-cresol are considered specific activators of RYR1, although the latter compound has been shown to be specifically active on RYR type 1 and 2 (20Zorzato F. Scutari E. Tegazzin V. Clementi E. Treves S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1192-1201PubMed Google Scholar, 29Herrmann-Frank A. Richter M. Sarkozi S. Mohr U. Lehmann-Horn F. Biochim. Biophys.

We believe that caffeine and 4-chloro-m-cresol are eliciting IL-1β release by stimulating the RYR of circulating B-lymphocytes. However, because cells of the immune system work in an integrated network and communicate with each other via cytokine production, both in vivo and under our experimental conditions, we cannot exclude the possibility that activated B-lymphocytes may in turn activate other cell types (monocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, etc.) to also release IL-1β. We also assayed whether RYR agonists affect the release of other cytokines such as interferon-γ or tumor necrosis factor-α, but the amounts of these cytokines present in the supernatant of stimulated peripheral blood leukocytes was barely detectable (results not shown). As to the EBV-immortalized cell lines, the amounts of IL-1β released was barely detectable, a result consistent with the fact that synthesis and production of cytokines by B-lymphocytes may be restricted to specific stages of differentiation (38Laskov R. Lancz G. Ruddle N.H. McGrath K.M. Specter S. Klein T. Djeu J.Y. Friedman H. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 3424-3430PubMed Google Scholar). We found that maximal stimulating concentrations of 4-chloro-m-cresol and caffeine caused the release of approximately 100 pg of IL-1β/106 cells. The amount of IL-1 produced by circulating B-lymphocytes in a normal individual could therefore be approximately 350 ng (0.7 × 109cells × 5 liters of blood). Because IL-β is the most pyrogenic cytokine, inducing temperatures of 39 °C in response to doses as small as 1–10 ng/kg body weight (25Gelfand J.A. Dinarello C.A. Braunwald E. Fauci A.S. Kasper D.L. Hauser S.L. Longo D.L. Jameson J.L. Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine. 15th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 90-94Google Scholar), the theoretical quantity of IL-1 produced is well within the limit necessary to increase body temperature via a central mechanism. MH reactions can be triggered by inhalative anesthetics, exercise, and stress, and several laboratories have reported that anesthetic agents, as well as sustained exercise activity, increase the plasma level of pro-inflammatory cytokines (39Pedersen B.K. Immunol. Cell Biol. 2000; 78: 532-535Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Steensberg A. van Hall G. Osada T. Sacchetti M. Saltin B. Klarlund Pedersen B. J.

Because human myoblasts have been shown to behave as immunologically active cells during inflammation, producing, among others, cytokines of the monocyte-macrophage cell lineage (43De Rossi M. Bernasconi P. Baggi F. de Waal Malefyt R. Mantegazza R. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 1329-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), it may be that in skeletal muscle cells cytokine secretion is influenced by elevations in the [Ca2+]i. The RYR1 calcium channel plays a central role in controlling the myoplasmic [Ca2+]; thus, our results imply that the muscle cells from MHS individuals may also produce more IL-1, an additional factor that may contribute to the increase in body temperature. Dantrolene, an inhibitor of the RYR1, is a life-saving compound used by clinicians to revert MH reactions and neuroleptic malignant syndrome (21Zucchi R. Ronca-Testoni S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 1-51PubMed Google Scholar, 44Xu L. Tripathy A. Pasek D.A. Meissner G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 853: 130-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 45Adnet P. Lestavel P. Krivosic-Horber R. Br. J. Anaesth. 2000; 85: 129-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). This pharmacological agent has also been shown to decrease plasma and tissue concentrations of inflammatory cytokines in septic animals and improve their survival (46Fischer D.R. Sun X. Williams A.B.

Thus, by blocking the RYR, dantrolene may also block cytokine production by muscle cells and lymphocytes and, in this way, help re-establish physiological body temperature. B-lymphocytes from malignant hyperthermia-susceptible patients have an increased sensitivity to skeletal muscle by ryanodine receptor activators.Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 277Issue 16PreviewPage 48080, Fig. 6 legend and 48081, line 3: Cells were from an MHS individual and not from a control as indicated.

In higher plants, there is evidence for two isoforms of this enzyme that fulfill different roles. Here, we describe the isolation of a second ferrochelatase cDNA from cucumber (CsFeC2) that was less similar to a previously isolated isoform (CsFeC1) than it was to some ferrochelatases from other higher plants. Inin vitro import experiments, the two cucumber isoforms showed characteristics similar to their respective ferrochelatase counterparts of Arabidopsis thaliana. The C-terminal region of CsFeC2 but not CsFeC1 contained a conserved motif found in light-harvesting chlorophyll proteins, and CsFeC2 belonged to a phylogenetic group of plant ferrochelatases containing this conserved motif. We demonstrate that CsFeC2 was localized predominantly in thylakoid membranes as an intrinsic protein, and forming complexes probably with the C-terminal conserved motif, but a minor portion was also detected in envelope membranes. CsFeC2 mRNA was detected in all tissues and was light-responsive in cotyledons, whereasCsFeC1 mRNA was detected in nonphotosynthetic tissues and was not light-responsive. Interestingly, tissue-, light-, and cycloheximide-dependent expressions of the two isoforms of ferrochelatase were similar to those of two glutamyl-tRNA reductase isoforms involved in the early step of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis, suggesting the existence of distinctly controlled tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathways in photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic tissues.

Ferrochelatase (protoheme ferrolyase; EC 4.99.1.1) is the terminal enzyme of the biosynthetic pathway of heme; it catalyzes the chelation of ferrous ion into the protoporphyrin IX ring to form protoheme. In yeast and mammalian mitochondria, ferrochelatase is associated with inner mitochondrial membranes as the mature form of a higher molecular weight precursor (1Camadro J.M. Labbe P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11675-11682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ferrochelatases have been purified from bacteria, yeast, and mammals, and many cDNAs have been isolated (2Miyamoto K. Nakahigashi K. Nishimura K. Inokuchi H. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 3Labbe-Bois R. J. Biol.

In each case, only one type of ferrochelatase has been isolated. In higher plants, however, heme is synthesized not only in mitochondria but also in chloroplasts (6Porra R.J. Lascelles J. Biochem. J. 1968; 108: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 7Little H.N. Jones O.T.G. Biochem. J. 1976; 156: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) for photosynthetic cytochromes and to provide a precursor for phytochromobilin, the phytochrome chromophore (8Elich T.D. McDonagh A.F. Palma L.A. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 183-189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because both heme and chlorophyll are synthesized in chloroplasts, the intraplastidal localization of the enzymes of tetrapyrrole synthesis is important to regulate the amounts of both products. Jacobs and Jacobs (9Jacobs J.M. Jacobs N.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 244: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) reported that protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase, which catalyzes the last common step in the chlorophyll and heme biosynthetic pathways, is also found in both chloroplasts and mitochondria, and in chloroplasts, protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase activity was associated with both the envelope and the thylakoid membranes (10Matringe M. Camadro J.-M. Block M.A. Joyard J. Scalla R. Labbe P. Douce R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4646-4651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, ferrochelatase activity was detected in thylakoid membranes but not in envelope membranes (11Matringe M. Camadro J.M. Joyard J. Douce R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15010-15015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because Mg-chelatase was associated with the chloroplast envelope, it was suggested that spatial separation of the chelatases to different membrane systems and their relative affinities for their common substrate might have a significant role in the regulation of tetrapyrrole biosynthetic flux within the plastid. Until recently, most investigations of ferrochelatase in plants have been performed with regard to detection of its activities in tissues, organelles, and their subfractions (6Porra R.J. Lascelles J. Biochem. J. 1968; 108: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 7Little H.N. Jones O.T.G. Biochem. J. 1976; 156: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 11Matringe M.

Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 769-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), Arabidopsis(15Smith A.G. Santana M.A. Wallace-Cook A.D.M. Roper J.M. Labbe-Bois R. J. Biol.

Two ferrochelatase cDNAs were isolated fromArabidopsis; both were expressed in leaves, stems, and flowers, and their expression was light-inducible. AtFC-I 1The abbreviations used are:AtFC-IArabidopsis ferrochelatase-IAtFC-IIArabidopsisferrochelatase-IICsFeC1cucumber ferrochelatase-1CsFeC2cucumber ferrochelatase-2ELIPearly light-inducible proteinGSTglutathione S-transferaseHLIPhigh light-inducible proteinLHClight-harvesting complexLHCPlight-harvesting chlorophyll-binding protein was also expressed in roots (16Chow K.S. Singh P.D. Walker A.R. Smith A.G. Plant J. 1998; 15: 531-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). By import assay, AtFC-II was shown to encode a precursor targeted to the chloroplasts, whereas the product of AtFC-I was shown to be targeted to both chloroplasts and mitochondria (17Roper J.M. Smith A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In addition, the association of both ferrochelatase proteins with thylakoid and envelope membranes was observed in chloroplasts, suggesting that the control of the branchpoint is not by spatial separation of the two chelatases (17Roper J.M. Smith A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, further analysis of localization was prevented due to the lack of specific antibodies against plant ferrochelatases. Moreover, Nakayama et al.(18Nakayama M. Masuda T. Bando T. Yamagata H. Ohta H. Takamiya K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1998; 39: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) showed that one subunit of Mg-chelatase (ChlH) was reversibly dissociated from the envelope to the stroma at low Mg2+concentrations and that the change in localization of ChlH may be physiologically important to regulate the amount of chlorophyll. Therefore, it is important to determine accurately the localization of the ferrochelatase protein for a better understanding of the strict coordination of heme and chlorophyll synthesis in chloroplasts. Arabidopsis ferrochelatase-I Arabidopsisferrochelatase-II cucumber ferrochelatase-1 cucumber ferrochelatase-2 early light-inducible protein glutathione S-transferase high light-inducible protein light-harvesting complex light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding protein We previously succeeded in the functional expression of cucumber ferrochelatase (HemH; CsFeC1 as designated in this report) cloned by Miyamoto et al. (14Miyamoto K. Tanaka R. Teramoto H. Masuda T. Tsuji H. Inokuchi H. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 769-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and in producing antibodies against the enzyme protein. We showed that this ferrochelatase was localized to nonphotosynthetic tissues (19Suzuki T. Masuda T. Inokuchi H. Shimada H. Ohta H. Takamiya K. Plant Cell Physiol. 2000; 41: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, in cucumber, ferrochelatase activity was detected in the chloroplasts of photosynthetic tissues, indicating the existence of another ferrochelatase(s) for heme biosynthesis in photosynthetic tissues under different control. In this study, we describe the isolation of a plastidic ferrochelatase cDNA from cucumber and its intraplastidic location, membrane binding, formation of complexes, and mRNA accumulation. Analyses of location and mRNA accumulation of the two cucumber ferrochelatases suggest that there are two different biosynthetic pathways for tetrapyrroles in photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic tissues, respectively. Etiolated cucumber seedlings (Cucumis sativus L. cv Aonagajibai) were grown on moist gauze at 26 °C in a growth chamber in darkness for 4 days and then subjected to various illumination routines and cycloheximide treatment. A cDNA library of RNA from cucumber cotyledons, grown in darkness for 4 days followed by illumination for 24 h, was made using the ZAP-cDNA Synthesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR was carried out using several sets of degenerate oligonucleotide primers designed from the region conserved among ferrochelatases of plants with the cDNA library as the template. PCR amplification was carried out for 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 50 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. The amplified fragments were cloned into the pT7Blue vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) and sequenced using a Thermo Sequenase Sequencing Kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The putative DNA fragment of a novel type of ferrochelatase was labeled with 32P, and ∼300,000 plaques of the cotyledon cDNA library were screened with this probe. Hybridization was carried out at 65 °C for 16 h, and the membranes were washed once with 2× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15m sodium chloride plus 15 mm sodium citrate)/0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 30 min and twice with 0.2× SSC/0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 10 min. The membranes were analyzed with a Bio-image Analyzer BAS 2000 (Fujix, Tokyo, Japan). Positive plaques were isolated after three rounds of screening, and the insert cDNAs were cloned into pBluescript SK(−) phagemids by in vivoexcision according to the manufacturer's instruction manual for the ZAP-cDNA Synthesis kit (Stratagene). The cDNA encoding the full-length precursor protein of CsFeC1 (14Miyamoto K. Tanaka R. Teramoto H. Masuda T. Tsuji H. Inokuchi H. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 769-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) was excised from the vector by digestion with EcoRI and subcloned into the EcoRI site of pBluescript KS so that the cDNA was under the control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter. Transcripts produced from this clonein vitro were used to generate radiolabeled precursor protein by translation in vitro in a reticulocyte system in the presence of [35S]methionine and then used for import experiments into isolated pea chloroplasts and mitochondria as described previously (20Chow K.-S. Singh D.P. Roper J.M. Smith A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27565-27571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding the full-length precursor for CsFeC2 was similarly used to generate radiolabeled precursor by incubation with both [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine, followed by import into isolated pea chloroplasts and mitochondria as described previously. 2Cleary, S. M., Tan, F.-C., Nakrieko, K.-A., Thompson, S. J., Mullineaux, P. M., Creissen, G. P., von Stedingk, E., Glaser, E., Smith, A. G., and Robinson, C. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, in press. Fractionation of chloroplasts was as described previously (17Roper J.M. Smith A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The region of CsFeC2 cDNA (from Glu-106 to Gln-522), which is conserved among ferrochelatases in a few species, was amplified using the PCR primers 5′-GGGGATCCGAAGACAAGGTTGGAGTGTTGTTGCTGAAC-3′ and 5′-CCGAATTCTCACTGATGAAATAAGGGGAAAATTCCCCACTG-3′. The CsFeC2 cDNA was subjected to 20 cycles of PCR amplification (1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C) using Takara Ex Taq (Takara Shuzo, Otsu, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The amplified product was ligated into pT7Blue (Novagen) and digested with EcoRI and XhoI. The obtained fragment was ligated into expression vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) predigested withEcoRI and XhoI. This plasmid was transformed intoEscherichia coli XL1-Blue MRF'. E. coli transformants in which GST-CsFeC2 was induced by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside were harvested and resuspended in extraction buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.7, 20% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The cells were disrupted by sonication twice for 10 min each time. To this lysate, 10% Triton X-100 was added to 0.5% to solubilize the fusion protein, and the lysate was incubated for 30 min. The lysate was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) was added to the supernatant. The resin was precipitated by centrifugation at 500 × g for 30 s at 4 °C and washed several times with extraction buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100. The GST-CsFeC2 fusion protein was extracted by boiling for 5 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 18% sucrose, 10% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, and 4% SDS) and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The GST-CsFeC2 fusion protein was eluted by homogenizing the sliced gel with extraction buffer. The extracted protein was digested with thrombin and separated by SDS-PAGE after boiling. CsFeC2 was extracted from the gel slice by homogenization in the presence of 0.1% SDS. The purified CsFeC2 was used to determine its N-terminal amino acid sequence and for immunization. A rabbit was immunized with ∼300 μg of purified CsFeC2 with complete or incomplete adjuvant (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan). The obtained antiserum was purified by the method of epitope selection (21Olmsted J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11955-11957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and used for Western blotting analyses. Proteins of the various extracts were separated on SDS-PAGE gels and then electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). The membranes were incubated with the CsFeC2 antibodies and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (anti-rabbit IgG (H+L); Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The bands of cucumber ferrochelatase were detected using ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Cucumber chloroplasts and mitochondria were isolated from the cotyledons of seedlings illuminated for 40 h. Chloroplasts and their fractions (thylakoid, envelope, and stroma) were prepared by the method described by Douce and Joyard (22Douce R. Joyard J. Edelman M. Hallick R.B. Chua N.H. Methods in Chloroplast Molecular Biology. Elsevier Biomedical Press, Amsterdam1982: 239Google Scholar). Intact chloroplasts were recovered at the interface of 40/80% Percoll at 6,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Subfractions of chloroplast were purified by discontinuous sucrose density gradients from lysed purified chloroplasts. The stroma was recovered in the upper layer at 72,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, the thylakoids were in the pellet under the 0.93m sucrose layer, and the envelope was between 0.6 and 0.93m sucrose layer. The fractions of thylakoid and envelope membranes were washed several times. Mitochondria were isolated essentially as described by Nishimuraet al. (23Nishimura M. Douce R. Akazawa T. Plant Physiol. 1982; 69: 916-920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with slight modifications. The homogenate of cucumber cotyledons was centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in a solution of 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 0.3 m mannitol, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. A discontinuous Percoll gradient was prepared by layering 1.5 ml of 60% and 2 ml each of 45%, 28% and 5% Percoll solutions. Then 1 ml of the suspension was layered on top of this gradient and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C (RPS40T swing rotor; Hitachi). The mitochondrial fraction was recovered at the interface of the 45% and 28% layers and washed under the same conditions as described for the discontinuous Percoll gradient. To check the mitochondrial viability, the activity of fumarase was assayed as follows. The mitochondrial fraction and 0.05m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.3) containing 0.05m malate were incubated at 25 °C, and the amount of the reaction product, fumarate, was determined by measuring the absorbance at 250 nm. Chlorophyll-protein complexes were separated as described by Andersson et al. (24Andersson B. Anderson J.M Ryrie I.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 123: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), with slight modifications. Thylakoids equivalent to 50 μg of chlorophyll were solubilized at 4 °C in 100 μl of 0.3 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 13% glycerol, and SDS (0.4%, 1%, or 2%). Aliquots of 20 μl of this solution (containing 10 μg of chlorophyll) were subjected to electrophoresis in an 8–11% polyacrylamide gradient gel containing 0.1% SDS. The upper reservoir buffer (pH 8.64) was 41 mmTris borate/0.1% SDS, and the lower reservoir buffer was 0.43m Tris-HCl (pH 9.35). Aliquots of 20 μg of total cucumber RNA were used for Northern blotting. A conserved region (nucleotides 398–1648) of CsFeC2 cDNA was used as a probe, followed by a fragment of Arabidopsis 25 S rRNA cDNA used as a control for the amount of RNA in each track. The cotyledons excised from 4-day-old etiolated seedlings were incubated in darkness on filter paper moistened with 3.5 ml of cycloheximide (100 μm) in Petri dishes. Primers for degenerate PCR were constructed from the amino acid sequences highly conserved among ferrochelatases of plants. PCR amplification using a cDNA library of cucumber cotyledons as a template produced a fragment that showed similarity with ferrochelatases but was not identical to the previously isolated CsFeC1 (14Miyamoto K. Tanaka R. Teramoto H. Masuda T. Tsuji H. Inokuchi H. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 769-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 19Suzuki T. Masuda T. Inokuchi H. Shimada H. Ohta H. Takamiya K. Plant Cell Physiol. 2000; 41: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Using this fragment as a probe, a phage clone containing the putative full-length cDNA was obtained (accession number AB037113). The clone was 2,032 bp in length and included a putative open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 522 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of this cDNA was compared with those of CsFeC1 and other ferrochelatases. The sequence showed significant similarity with the sequences of other ferrochelatases (Fig. 1 A), confirming that it encoded ferrochelatase. This isoform is henceforth referred to as CsFeC2. CsFeC2, like CsFeC1, has an N-terminal extension, which is likely to be a chloroplast transit peptide (see below). CsFeC2 is more similar to AtFC-II (76.2%) than CsFeC1 (58.7%). Phylogenetic analysis of ferrochelatases in photosynthetic organisms showed that CsFeC2, AtFC-II, and ferrochelatases from potato and rice comprised a phylogenetic group different from that of CsFeC1 (Fig. 1 B). Moreover, although a cyanobacterial ferrochelatase showed the same level of similarity to CsFeC1 and CsFeC2, the C-terminal region was highly similar to CsFeC2, AtFC-II, and rice and potato ferrochelatases, causing it to group with these ferrochelatases (Fig. 1 B). Thus, cyanobacterial ferrochelatase may be an ancestor of this type of ferrochelatase. The C-terminal region of CsFeC2 showed similarity to the consensus sequence of light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding proteins (LHCPs), the so-called “generic LHC motifs” (25Jansson S. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 236-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). All other ferrochelatases in this group, except that from potato, have this motif. Inspection of the potato sequence reveals that it has half of the LHC motif, and if the coding frame is shifted by changing the A triplet of 1416–1418 in the nucleotide sequence into an A doublet, the complete motif is restored. Therefore, it is likely that the potato ferrochelatase sequence contains an error, and all members of this group of ferrochelatases contain the complete LHC motif. In contrast, the motif is absent from AtFC-I, CsFeC1, and barley ferrochelatase (14Miyamoto K. Tanaka R. Teramoto H. Masuda T. Tsuji H. Inokuchi H. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 769-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 C, the LHC motif is also conserved in small Cab-like proteins of cyanobacteria (ssl and ssr series), early light-inducible proteins of soybean and Arabidopsis, and high-light inducible proteins (HLIPs) of Synechococcus PCC 7942 (7942 HLIP). All LHCPs contain three membrane-spanning helices, and helices I and III share this generic LHC motif. These helices form the core of the complex and are kept together by ion bridges between the helices (25Jansson S. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 236-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Early-light inducible proteins also contain two LHC motifs, whereas HLIPs have only one. These proteins are thought to form homodimers in the thylakoid membrane with two LHC motifs as a core (25Jansson S. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 236-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar,26Heddad M. Adamska I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3741-3746Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Indeed, in CsFeC2, it is likely that this region was also associated with membrane binding and complex formation (see below). Both CsFeC1 (14Miyamoto K. Tanaka R. Teramoto H. Masuda T. Tsuji H. Inokuchi H. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 769-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and CsFeC2 have N-terminal extensions of about 90 and 100 residues, respectively, and these are likely to be targeting peptides. To verify this, we performed in vitrotransport experiments. The 35S-labeled precursors of CsFeC1 and CsFeC2 of 57 and 58 kDa, respectively, (Fig.2 A, TP) were incubated with isolated pea chloroplasts, followed by treatment with thermolysin (pC). It is clear that both precursors were imported into chloroplasts because of the cleavage of the precursors into the same size as that predicted for the mature protein and the disappearance of bands in the presence of Triton X-100 (data not shown). Fractionation of the chloroplasts demonstrated that both mature ferrochelatases were found mainly in the thylakoids. CsFeC1 is clearly also present in the envelope fraction at about 10% of the level in the thylakoids (data not shown). CsFeC2 is also detectable in the envelopes, but at a level much less than that of CsFeC1. The targeting to and distribution within chloroplasts of the two CsFeCs were thus essentially identical to those of the two ferrochelatases fromArabidopsis (17Roper J.M. Smith A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Then we investigated the import of the two radiolabeled CsFeC precursor proteins with isolated pea mitochondria. Again, the two cucumber ferrochelatases behaved in a manner similar to their homologues fromArabidopsis. CsFeC2 is not imported (data not shown), whereas CsFeC1 is imported into mitochondria and processed to a protein essentially identical to that imported by chloroplasts (Fig.2 B). This import is abolished by the addition of valinomycin (data not shown), which collapses the membrane potential (27Schleyer M. Schmidt B. Neupert W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 125: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). It has recently been demonstrated that the mitochondrial import systemin vitro is not robust because it will readily import a number of precursors that are found exclusively in the chloroplastin vivo.2 Therefore, it is not possible to extrapolate the location of a protein in vivo from the results of a mitochondrial import experiment. Nevertheless, it was a useful test to discriminate between the two classes of ferrochelatase. This result lends further support to the classification of higher plant ferrochelatases into two separate classes, as does the observation that the barley ferrochelatase (14Miyamoto K. Tanaka R. Teramoto H. Masuda T. Tsuji H. Inokuchi H. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 769-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), which does not have the LHC motif, is imported into mitochondria in a similar fashion as AtFC-I and CsFeC1. 3D. P. Singh and A. G. Smith, unpublished data. The putative mature region of CsFeC2 was fused with GST and overexpressed in E. coli. The recombinant protein obtained was used for antibody preparation. Unlike CsFeC1 (19Suzuki T. Masuda T. Inokuchi H. Shimada H. Ohta H. Takamiya K. Plant Cell Physiol. 2000; 41: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), the recombinant GST-CsFeC2 did not show any ferrochelatase activity even after modification of induction and isolation procedures. In addition, once the recombinant GST-CsFeC2 protein was bound to glutathione-Sepharose resin for affinity purification, it was not eluted from the resin by 5 mm reduced glutathione or thrombin protease treatment. The fusion protein was therefore recovered from the resin under denaturing conditions, and the GST region was then removed by thrombin treatment. Determination of the N-terminal amino acids of the purified protein confirmed that the obtained recombinant protein was CsFeC2 (data not shown). The molecular mass of the expressed protein calculated from the amino acid sequence was 47.2 kDa and that estimated by SDS-PAGE was 43 kDa. A rabbit was immunized with the purified CsFeC2, and the antibodies were purified by the epitope selection method. The obtained antibodies could detect 1 ng of CsFeC2 or 50 ng of CsFeC1 (data not shown) and were used for Western blotting analyses. To further investigate the subcellular location of CsFeC2, mitochondria and subfractions of chloroplasts were isolated from cucumber cotyledons. The purity of the subcellular fractions from cucumber was checked by Western blotting analysis or enzyme assay for marker proteins (anti-LHCP antibody for thylakoid, anti-large subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase antibody for stroma, and fumarase activity for mitochondria). Western blotting analysis of subcellular fractions showed that the anti-CsFeC2 antibody reacted only with the protein in chloroplasts (Fig. 3 A). The detected band was similar in size to recombinant CsFeC2, indicating that the artificial cleavage site of recombinant CsFeC2 was very close to the native cleavage site. When chloroplasts were separated into subfractions, the antibody reacted with a thylakoid membrane protein, but not with stromal proteins (Fig. 3 A). A band was also detected in the envelope fraction. Because the envelope membrane fraction was somewhat contaminated with thylakoid membranes by our purification procedure, we estimated the extent of the contamination of thylakoid membrane in the envelope membrane using anti-LHCP antibodies (Fig. 3 B). From the band intensity of the LHCP protein in the envelope, 10 μg of the envelope fraction was contaminated with ∼0.6 μg of thylakoid membranes. Because the band of CsFeC2 was detected in 10 μg of the envelope fraction but not below 5 μg of thylakoid membranes, the detected band in the envelope membrane was not due to the contaminating thylakoid membranes. Consistent with the results of the in vitro transport experiment, no band of CsFeC2 was detected in the mitochondrial fraction. Thus, it is concluded that CsFeC2 functions for heme biosynthesis in chloroplasts, but not in mitochondria. We then examined the association of CsFeC2 with thylakoid membranes. CsFeC2 protein in the thylakoid membrane was not eluted by salt or alkaline treatment, indicating that CsFeC2 was not associated with thylakoid membranes by electrostatic forces (data not shown). The hydropathy profile of CsFeC2 indicated that the obvious hydrophobic region was only recognized in the C-terminal region containing the LHC motif (data not shown). Therefore, like LHCPs, members of the CsFeC2 protein family are probably bound to the thylakoid membrane through this C-terminal LHC motif. To investigate the formation of a CsFeC2 complex, we treated isolated thylakoid membranes with different concentrations of SDS (0.4–2%), and chlorophyll-protein complexes were separated in a slab gel containing 0.1% SDS. The untreated thylakoid membranes could not be separated in the gel. However, after treatment with 0.4–2% SDS, chlorophyll-binding proteins migrated with chlorophyll (data not shown). Western blotting analysis with anti-CsFeC2 antibody indicated that CsFeC2 did not comigrate with major chlorophyll-binding proteins, but formation of two complexes, complex I and complex II, was observed at low SDS concentrations (Fig.4 A). To confirm that these complexes originated from CsFeC2, they were eluted from the gel slices, treated by boiling in SDS sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Western blotting analysis revealed that both complexes contained CsFeC2 (Fig. 4 B). These complexes were dissociated into monomers by increasing the SDS concentration (Fig. 4 A). Boiling the sample in 2% SDS completely dissociated the complexes to monomers. The standard molecular mass was estimated using a LMW marker kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) treated at 4 °C in buffer containing 0.4% SDS. The molecular masses of the complexes were estimated to be about 110–120 kDa (complex I) and about 90–95 kDa (complex II), although the mobility of partially denatured proteins shows some differences from that of completely denatured proteins. Because the molecular mass of the CsFeC2 monomer was estimated to be about 50 kDa in this partially denaturating system (the molecular mass of CsFeC2 estimated in Fig. 4 was about 43 kDa), it is possible that these complexes were CsFeC2 homodimers with slightly different conformations that caused the slight differences in mobility. Alternatively, these complexes might contain component(s) other than CsFeC2, for instance, some pigment molecules (see “Discussion”). We investigated the differences in expression between the two ferrochelatase genes (CsFeC1 and CsFeC2). As reported previously (19Suzuki T. Masuda T. Inokuchi H. Shimada H. Ohta H. Takamiya K. Plant Cell Physiol. 2000; 41: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), CsFeC1 mRNA was accumulated in nonphotosynthetic tissues such as the roots and hypocotyls (Fig.5). On the other hand,CsFeC2 mRNA was detected in all tissues of seedlings. Moreover, CsFeC2 mRNA was markedly induced by illumination in cotyledons, in contrast to the light-insensitive expression of CsFeC1. We also investigated the expression in mature leaves and flowers (Fig. 5). The CsFeC1 gene was expressed in flowers but not in leaves, whereas the CsFeC2gene was expressed in both of these tissues. These light- and tissue-dependent expression profiles ofCsFeC genes were reminiscent of the similar regulation of two distinctly controlled hemA genes (hemA1and hemA2) encoding glutamyl-tRNA reductase in cucumber (28Tanaka R. Yoshida K. Nakayashiki T. Masuda T. Tsuji H. Inokuchi H. Tanaka A. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 1223-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Glutamyl-tRNA reductase catalyzes the initial step of 5-aminolevulinic acid biosynthesis and is considered to be the rate-limiting step of total tetrapyrrole biosynthesis. It was reported that hemA1 mRNA was light-inducible and primarily detected in cotyledons and hypocotyls, whereas hemA2mRNA was poorly light-responsive and was detected in roots and hypocotyls but hardly detected in cotyledons (28Tanaka R. Yoshida K. Nakayashiki T. Masuda T. Tsuji H. Inokuchi H. Tanaka A. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 1223-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The similarity of the expression patterns between the hemA and ferrochelatase genes suggested that there are two pathways for tetrapyrrole biosynthesis in higher plants, i.e. one pathway for heme biosynthesis in nonphotosynthetic tissues and the other for Chl and heme biosynthesis in the photosynthetic organelles, the chloroplasts. Interestingly, when cucumber cotyledons were treated with cycloheximide, a cytoplasmic translational inhibitor, CsFeC1and hemA2 mRNAs were markedly induced (Fig.6), whereas those of CsFeC2and hemA1, which are transcribed in photosynthetic tissues, were not affected. This suggested that the expression and/or accumulation of CsFeC1 and hemA2 gene products are controlled by the same regulatory mechanism. We isolated a CsFeC2 cDNA from the cDNA library of cucumber cotyledons and demonstrated immunologically that CsFeC2 is a membrane-spanning protein located mainly in the thylakoid membrane. The CsFeC2 protein is presumed to have evolved from cyanobacterial ferrochelatase, which possesses the C-terminal generic LHC motif. Jansson (25Jansson S. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 236-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) suggested that the ancient ferrochelatase captured a membrane-spanning helix from a HLIP to fulfill functions for membrane anchoring or photoprotection of porphyrins. In fact, CsFeC2 is likely to be anchored to the thylakoid membrane with the generic LHC motif. Moreover, it is also likely that CsFeC2 protein forms a homodimer (complex II) in the thylakoid membrane, probably via the generic LHC motif. In fact, HLIPs and stress-enhanced proteins containing only one LHC motif have been predicted to form homodimers (25Jansson S. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 236-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 29Dolganov N.A.M. Bhaya D. Grossman A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 636-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Because HLIPs are thought to bind chlorophylls, it is possible that CsFeC2 also binds pigments with its LHC motif. Funk and Vermaas (30Funk C. Vermaas W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9397-9404Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) discussed the possibility that the LHC domain ofSynechocystis ferrochelatase binds chlorophyll. We found that complex I of CsFeC2 has a slightly (10–20 kDa) higher molecular mass than complex II that probably corresponds to a homodimer of CsFeC2. It is attractive to hypothesize that some pigment molecules bind to complex II, resulting in the higher molecular mass of complex I. Matringe et al. (11Matringe M. Camadro J.M. Joyard J. Douce R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15010-15015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that in pea chloroplast, ferrochelatase activity was associated with the thylakoid membrane only, and no activity was detected in the envelope membrane. However, the anti-CsFeC2 antibody cross-reacted with protein in the envelope membrane. The envelope localization of both Arabidopsisferrochelatases was also reported after import in vitro into pea chloroplasts (17Roper J.M. Smith A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These results suggest that there is no clear spatial separation of the chelatases within chloroplasts (17Roper J.M. Smith A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), in contrast to the previous proposal to explain the control of flux between the chlorophyll and heme branches of the pathway (11Matringe M. Camadro J.M. Joyard J. Douce R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15010-15015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the flux of protoporphyrin IX to chlorophyll synthesis in the envelope may be much larger than that to heme synthesis because the amount of ferrochelatase in the envelope was very small, and the affinity of Mg-chelatase for protoporphyrin IX was reported to be much higher than that of ferrochelatase (31Guo R. Luo M. Weinstein J.D. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 605-615Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). One possible function of this envelope ferrochelatase is the biosynthesis of heme to be distributed to the chloroplast or cytoplasm. Although the organelle from which heme is supplied to cytosolic heme proteins has not been clarified, heme efflux was observed from isolated chloroplasts (32Thomas J. Weinstein J.D. Plant Physiol. 1990; 94: 1414-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that the envelope-localized ferrochelatase may act as a scavenger, mopping up any excess protoporphyrin IX in the envelope before this highly reactive compound causes photo-oxidative damage. The CsFeC2 gene expression profile was quite different from that of the CsFeC1 gene. Compared with CsFeC1,CsFeC2 mRNA was markedly induced by light in cotyledons, suggesting that the expression was induced simultaneously with chloroplast development. Because the induction is consistent with the appearance of cytochrome f (33Heij H.T. Jochemsen A.-G. Willemsen P.T.J. Groot G.S.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 138: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and probably of cytochromeb 6, the heme prosthetic group of these proteins may be supplied by CsFeC2. The similar expression profiles of respective isoforms of ferrochelatases and glutamyl-tRNA reductases (hemA) in cucumber suggest that there are two separate pathways of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis with two isozymes in each step. The pathway in photosynthetic tissues seems to be localized to the chloroplast, and the steps toward protoporphyrin IX may be shared by Chl and heme synthesis. On the other hand, the pathway in nonphotosynthetic tissues was not affected by light and may supply heme for hemoproteins or for biosynthesis of the phytochrome chromophore. The expression of the genes for CsFeC1 and hemA2, localized in nonphotosynthetic tissues, were both induced in photosynthetic tissues by cycloheximide treatment. The cycloheximide induction may be caused by a putative factor(s) required for repression of CsFeC1 andhemA2 expression specifically in photosynthetic tissues. In summary, we have demonstrated the existence of two ferrochelatases in cucumber that are controlled distinctly, and we have shown that the ferrochelatase expressed in photosynthetic tissue was located in chloroplasts. Regulation of distinct pathways of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis in photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic tissues should be further analyzed."

Here we report that the conjugation of Nedd8 to ROC1-CUL1, a subcomplex of the SCF-ROC1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, selectively stimulates Cdc34-catalyzed lysine 48-linked multiubiquitin chain assembly. We have further demonstrated that separate regions within the human Cdc34 C-terminal tail are responsible for multiubiquitin chain assembly and for physical interactions with the Nedd8-conjugated ROC1-CUL1 to assemble extensive ubiquitin polymers. Structural comparisons between Nedd8 and ubiquitin reveal that six charged residues (Lys4, Glu12, Glu14, Arg25, Glu28, and Glu31) are uniquely present on the surface of Nedd8. Replacement of each of the six residues with the corresponding amino acid in ubiquitin decreases the ability of Nedd8 to activate the ubiquitin ligase activity of ROC1-CUL1. Moreover, maintenance of the proper charges at amino acid positions 14 and 25 are necessary for retaining wild type levels of activity, whereas introduction of the opposite charges at these positions abolishes the Nedd8 activation function. These results suggest that Nedd8 charged surface residues mediate the activation of ROC1-CUL1 to specifically support Cdc34-catalyzed ubiquitin polymerization.

These results suggest that Nedd8 charged surface residues mediate the activation of ROC1-CUL1 to specifically support Cdc34-catalyzed ubiquitin polymerization. Nedd8 (or its orthologue Rub1) is a small ubiquitin (Ub)-like molecule that modifies all members of the Cullin/Cdc53 protein family (1Hochstrasser M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 901-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 2Hori T. Osaka F. Chiba T. Miyamoto C. Okabayashi K. Shimbara N. Kato S. Tanaka K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6829-6834Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), resulting in the formation of an isopeptide bond linkage between the ε-amino group of a conserved Cullin lysine residue and the C-terminal carboxyl group of Nedd8 glycine 76. The conjugation is an ATP-dependent reaction that requires a Nedd8-specific E1 activating enzyme, composed of the APP-BP1 and Uba3 heterodimer, and Ubc12 as the E2 conjugating enzyme (3Gong L. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12036-12042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In addition, the Cullin-interacting RING finger protein, ROC1/Rbx1/Hrt1, is required for the reaction as disruption of the RING domain abolishes the modification (4Kamura T. Conrad M.N. Yan Q. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2928-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Two well characterized members of the Cullin family, CUL1 and CUL2, serve as subunits of the two multisubunit E3 Ub ligase complexes, SCF-ROC1 (5Tan P. Fuchs S.Y. Chen A. Wu K. Gomez C. Ronai Z.

It has now been well established that the ROC1-CUL1 subassembly acts as a core ubiquitin ligase, capable of supporting Ub polymerization (5Tan P. Fuchs S.Y. Chen A. Wu K. Gomez C. Ronai Z. Pan Z.-Q.

Chem. 2000; 275: 15432-15439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In addition, results from transient transfection experiments have shown that ROC1 and its homologue ROC2 interact with all members of the Cullin protein family and that the resulting ROC-Cullin complex is active in supporting Ub polymerization (6Ohta T. Michel J.J. Schottelius A.J. Xiong Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 535-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Thus, while the biological roles of Cullin members including CUL3, CUL4A, CUL4B, and CUL5 remain elusive, it is highly likely that all of the ROC-Cullin based complexes are involved in cellular Ub-dependent proteolysis pathways. It is, therefore, conceivable that Nedd8, through its conjugation to Cullins, functions to regulate the stability of cellular proteins. Accumulating genetic evidence has demonstrated a critical role for Nedd8 in the regulation of cell proliferation and development. InSaccharomyces cerevisiae, the Rub1 pathway is essential for cell growth when the function of the SCF is compromised by mutations incdc34, cdc4, cdc53, orskp1 (12Lammer D. Mathias N. Laplaza J.M. Jiang W. Liu Y. Callis J. Goebl M. Estelle M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 914-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In fission yeast, the Nedd8-modifying pathway is essential for cell viability (13Osaka F. Saeki M. Katayama S. Aida N. Toh-e A. Kominami K. Toda T. Suzuki T. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Kato S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3475-3484Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). A dramatic cell cycle effect was also observed in the ts41 hamster cell line, where the Nedd8 pathway is defective (14Handeli S. Weintraub H. Cell. 1992; 71: 599-611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This cell harbors a temperature-sensitive allele of SMC1, a homologue of human APP-BP1. At a nonpermissive temperature, the ts41 cell undergoes multiple rounds of DNA replication without intervening mitoses. Furthermore, in Arabidopsis thaliana, recessive mutations in the AXR1 gene (a homologue of APP-BP1) resulted in a decreased response to auxin, a hormone that regulates diverse developmental processes by promoting changes in cell division and elongation (15Pozo J.C. Timpte C. Tan S. Callis J. Estelle M. Science. 1998; 280: 1760-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). More recently, Deshaies and co-workers (16Lyapina S. Cope G. Shevchenko A. Serino G. Tsuge T. Zhou C. Wolf D.A. Wei N. Shevchenko A. Deshaies R.J. Science. 2001; 292: 1382-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar) and Deng and co-workers (17Schwechheimer C. Serino G. Callis J.

Science. 2001; 292: 1379-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) have provided compelling genetic evidence that the COP9/signalosome promotes the cleavage of Nedd8 from CUL1, suggesting a complex mechanism required for the removal of Nedd8 from its substrate Cullin proteins. Read et al. (18Read M.A. Brownell J.E. Gladysheva T.B. Hottelet M. Parent L.A. Coggins M.B. Pierce J.W. Podust V.N. Luo R.S. Chau V. Palombella V.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2326-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) have initially reported that Nedd8 modification activates the SCFβ-TRCP-dependent ubiquitination of IκBα. They further demonstrated that Nedd8 does not affect theKm for SCFβ-TRCP binding to IκBα, nor does it significantly alter the ability of CUL1 to form complexes with ROC1, Skp1, and β-TRCP. In addition, Podust et al. (19Podust V.N. Brownell J.E. Gladysheva T.B. Luo R.S. Wang C. Coggins M.B. Pierce J.W. Lightcap E.S. Chau V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Commun. 2000; 270: 1093-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) have shown that the Nedd8 conjugation pathway is essential for proteolytic targeting of p27 by ubiquitination. Recently, we have provided biochemical evidence that the conjugation of Nedd8 to CUL1 at Lys720 activates the Ub ligase activity of the ROC1-CUL1 complex (21Wu K. Chen A. Pan Z.-Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32317-32324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), suggesting that Nedd8 is a novel regulator of the efficiency of polyubiquitin chain synthesis and, hence, promotes the rapid turnover of SCF-ROC1 substrates. It remains to be determined, however, how Nedd8 activates the Ub ligase activity of the ROC1-CUL1 complex. In this report, we show that the conjugation of Nedd8 to the ROC1-CUL1 complex selectively stimulates Cdc34-catalyzed, but not Ubc4/5-catalyzed, Lys48-linked multiubiquitin chain assembly. Furthermore, we present evidence that Nedd8 charged surface residues mediate the activation of ROC1-CUL1 in supporting ubiquitin polymerization. To generate a plasmid for the expression of human Cdc34 in Escherichia coli, the full-length cDNA sequence (obtained from M. Pagano) was subcloned into the pET-3a vector (Novagen). Both the HA and six-histidine tag sequences were inserted at the N terminus of Cdc34. To construct various C-terminal Cdc34 truncations, stop codons were generated at the desired locations in the pET-His-HA-Cdc34 plasmid using the QuickChangeTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Primers used for PCR were as follows: Cdc34 (aa 1–208), GGGCTCAGACCTCTTCTACGACTAATACTACGAGGACGGCGAGGTGG (5′) and CCACCTCGCCGTCCTCGTAGTATTAGTCGTAGAAGAGGTCTGAGCCC (3′); Cdc34 (aa 1–194), GGCCGAGTACTGCGTGAAGACCTAGGCGCCGGCGCCCGACGAGGGC (5′) and GCCCTCGTCGGGCGCCGGCGCCTAGGTCTTCACGCAGTACTCGGCC (3′); and Cdc34 (aa 1–169), GACATCATCCGGAAGCAGGTCTAGGGGACCAAGGTGGACGCCG (5′) and CGGCGTCCACCTTGGTCCCCTAGACCTGCTTCCGGATGATGTC (3′). To construct Nedd8 point mutants, the QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit was again employed as per the manufacturer's instructions, using pET-Nedd8 (a kind gift from C. Pickart) as a template with the following primer sets: K4F, GAAGGAGATATACATATGCTAATATTTGTGAAGACGCTGACCGGAAAGGAGATTG (5′) and CAATCTCCTTTCCGGTCAGCGTCTTCACAAATATTAGCATATGTATATCTCCTTC (3′); E12T, GTGAAGACGCTGACCGGAAAGACAATTGAGATTGACATTGAACCTAC (5′) and GTAGGTTCAATGTCAATCTCAATTGTCTTTCCGGTCAGCGTCTTCAC (3′); E14T, GACGCTGACCGGAAAGGAGATTACAATTGACATTGAACCTACAGAC (5′) and GTCTGTAGGTTCAATGTCAATTGTAATCTCCTTTCCGGTCAGCGTC (3′); E14D, GACGCTGACCGGAAAGGAGATTGATATCGACATTGAACCTACAGAC (5′) and GTCTGTAGGTTCAATGTCGATATCAATCTCCTTTCCGGTCAGCGTC (3′); E14R, GACGCTGACCGGAAAGGAGATTAGGATCGACATTGAACCTACAGAC (5′) and GTCTGTAGGTTCAATGTCGATCCTAATCTCCTTTCCGGTCAGCGTC (3′); R25N, CCTACAGACAAGGTGGAGAACATCAAGGAGCGTGTGGAGGAG (5′) and CTCCTCCACACGCTCCTTGATGTTCTCCACCTTGTCTGTAGG (3′); R25K, CCTACAGACAAGGTGGAGAAAATCAAGGAGCGTGTGGAGGAG (5′) and CTCCTCCACACGCTCCTTGATTTTCTCCACCTTGTCTGTAGG (3′); R25E, CCTACAGACAAGGTGGAGGAAATCAAGGAGCGTGTGGAGGAG (5′) and CTCCTCCACACGCTCCTTGATTTCCTCCACCTTGTCTGTAGG (3′); E28A, CAAGGTGGAGCGAATCAAGGCACGTGTGGAGGAGAAAGAGG (5′) and CCTCTTTCTCCTCCACACGTGCCTTGATTCGCTCCACCTTG (3′); and E31Q, GAGCGAATCAAGGAGCGTGTGCAGGAGAAAGAGGGAATC (5′) and GATTCCCTCTTTCTCCTGCACACGCTCCTTGATTCGCTC (3′). The presence of the desired mutation in each construct was verified by DNA sequencing. pET-3a plasmids expressing the wild type and mutant Cdc34 proteins were transformed into the pJY2 (Affiniti)-containing BL21 (DE3) cells and grown in LB (0.5 liter) with 0.4% glucose in the presence of ampicillin and chloramphenicol at 37 °C. Cultures were then cooled to room temperature when the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.5. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at a final concentration of 0.8 mm was added to induce the culture overnight (12–14 h) at 25 °C. Cells were pelleted at 5,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in 125 culture volume of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mNaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.4 μg/ml antipain, and 0.2 μg/ml leupeptin). The resuspension was then sonicated (four repetitive 20-s treatments) and centrifuged at 17,000 rpm in an SS-34 rotor for 30 min at 4 °C. For the preparation of Cdc34, Cdc34 (aa 1–208), and Cdc34 (aa 1–194), soluble extracts (10 ml) were mixed with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (3 ml; Qiagen) for ∼2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then packed into a column and washed consecutively with buffer A (30 ml) and 9 ml of buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, and 0.5 mNaCl) plus 5 mm imidazole. Bound protein was eluted with a 40-ml linear gradient of 5–250 mm imidazole in buffer B. Fractions containing peak levels of Cdc34, as judged by SDS-PAGE/Coomassie staining analysis, were pooled and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in buffer C (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm DTT) plus 50 mm NaCl. The resulting material was then loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column (3 ml; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). After washing the column with 30 ml of buffer C plus 50 mm NaCl, bound Cdc34 or Cdc34 (aa 1–208) was eluted by a 40-ml linear gradient of 50–500 mm NaCl in buffer C, and the peak fractions were pooled. Cdc34 (aa 1–194) was recovered in the flow-through. All three Cdc34 derivatives were concentrated using centrifugal filters and further purified by FPLC using a Sephadex-75 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences). A single peak of protein corresponding to Cdc34, Cdc34 (aa 1–208), or Cdc34 (aa 1–194) monomer was pooled and used in the studies described in this report. The majority of Cdc34 (aa 1–169) was found in the insoluble inclusion body. Prior to solubilization, the pellet was washed once with buffer A (25 ml) and twice with buffer D (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20% sucrose, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.4 μg/ml antipain, and 0.2 μg/ml leupeptin). The washed pellet was then resuspended in 20 ml of buffer E (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole) plus 8 m urea, and the resulting mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The solubilized material (10 ml) was mixed with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (3 ml) for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by washing the beads with progressively decreasing concentrations of urea in buffer E. The bound protein was then eluted by imidazole and further purified using Q Sepharose and Sephadex-75 gel filtration chromatography as described above. A single peak of Cdc34 (aa 1–169) monomer was pooled and used in the studies described in this report. The various Nedd8 mutant proteins were prepared identically as the wild type protein using the procedure as previously described (21Wu K. Chen A. Pan Z.-Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32317-32324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The proteins were concentrated to ∼0.3 mg/ml. APP-BP1/UBA3 was affinity-purified as described previously (21Wu K. Chen A. Pan Z.-Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32317-32324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). For preparation of Ubc12, GST-fused Ubc12 was expressed and isolated on glutathione beads as previously described (21Wu K. Chen A. Pan Z.-Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32317-32324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). To cleave GST, the fusion protein that was immobilized to glutathione beads was incubated with biotinylated thrombin (45 units/ml of beads) for 2 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatant containing both Ubc12 and thrombin was mixed with streptavidin beads (Amersham Biosciences; 5 μl of beads/unit of thrombin), and the resulting suspension was rocked for 1 h at 4 °C to allow the absorption of the biotinylated thrombin to the beads. Ubc12, free of GST and thrombin, was obtained by centrifugation. Human Ub E1 was prepared as described (5Tan P. Fuchs S.Y. Chen A. Wu K. Gomez C. Ronai Z. Pan Z.-Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 527-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The expression and purification of Ubc5c were carried out as described by Ohta et al. (6Ohta T. Michel J.J. Schottelius A.J. Xiong Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 535-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). To conjugate Nedd8 or its mutant form to ROC1-CUL1,E. coli extracts containing GST-ROC1-CUL1 (aa 324–776) (21Wu K. Chen A. Pan Z.-Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32317-32324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) were mixed with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. Bacterial proteins were removed by washing the beads three times with 0.5 ml of buffer F (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mmEDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.4 μg/ml antipain, and 0.2 μg/ml leupeptin) and twice with buffer C plus 50 mm NaCl. Glutathione beads containing ∼1 μg of GST-ROC1-CUL1 (aa 324–776) were used in the assay. For Nedd8 conjugation, the immobilized GST-ROC1-CUL1 (aa 324–776) was incubated with 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mmATP, 0.6 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, APP-BP1/UBA3 (25 ng), Nedd8 (0.6 μg), and Ubc12 (1 μg) at 37 °C for 60 min. Excess Nedd8 modification agents were removed by washing the beads three times with 0.5 ml of buffer F and twice with buffer C plus 50 mm NaCl. The GST-ROC1-CUL1 (aa 324–776) complex, conjugated with the wild type or mutant Nedd8 protein, was then incubated in a reaction mixture (30 μl) that contained 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NaF, 10 nm okadaic acid, 2 mm ATP, 0.6 mmDTT, 5 μg of 32P-Ub, E1 (0.6 pmol), and the indicated E2 Ub-conjugating enzyme. The incubation was at 37 °C for 30 min or, as otherwise specified, on a thermomixer (Eppendorf). The bound protein was released by boiling the beads with 20 μl of Laemmli loading buffer in the presence of 12 mm DTT for 3 min. This treatment was sufficient to abolish the majority of the DTT-sensitive Ub-linked thiol-esters, resulting in an identical pattern of Ub ligation products as observed when the DTT concentration was increased to 0.1 m (data not shown). Thus, the 32P-Ub conjugates, visualized by autoradiography following 10% SDS-PAGE, were predominantly those linked via isopeptide bonds. The reaction mixture (20 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm DTT, 2 mm ATP, 3 μg of 32P-Ub, E1 (0.6 pmol), and 0.5 μg of the wild type or C-terminally truncated Cdc34 protein. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and terminated by the addition of Laemmli loading buffer. The final concentration of SDS was adjusted to 0.5%. The reaction products were then separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. We have recently demonstrated that Nedd8 modification activates the ability of ROC1-CUL1 to support Ub polymerization in the presence of Cdc34 (21Wu K. Chen A. Pan Z.-Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32317-32324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that both Ubc4 and -5 are also capable of mediating ROC1-dependent polyubiquitin chain assembly (6Ohta T. Michel J.J. Schottelius A.J. Xiong Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 535-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). To determine whether Nedd8 activation was E2-specific, we compared Cdc34 and Ubc5c in their ability to catalyze Ub polymerization in the presence of the Nedd8-conjugated ROC1-CUL1 complex. For this purpose, the unmodified GST-ROC1-CUL1 (aa 324–776) complex, expressed and assembled in E. coli, was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B. To conjugate Nedd8 to the CUL1 (aa 324–776) fragment, the immobilized GST-ROC1-CUL1 (aa 324–776) complex was incubated with a solution containing purified Nedd8, (APP-BP1)/Uba3, and Ubc12. To test the effect of Nedd8 modification on the Ub polymerization reaction, the unmodified (Fig.1, A and B,lanes 2–5) or Nedd8-conjugated (Fig. 1,A and B, lanes 6–9) complex was incubated for the indicated times with purified E1,32P-labeled Ub, and either Cdc34 (Fig. 1A) or Ubc5c (Fig. 1B). In all cases, the Ub ligase activity of GST-ROC1-CUL1 (aa 324–776) was quantified following autoradiographic/PhosphorImager analysis by measuring the levels of accumulated high molecular weight 32P-Ub conjugates derived from the monomeric Ub. The high molecular weight mass Ub conjugates formed were complex and likely included free Ub chains (5Tan P. Fuchs S.Y. Chen A. Wu K. Gomez C. Ronai Z. Pan Z.-Q. Mol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 32317-32324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), Nedd8 modification activated the Cdc34-catalyzed assembly of 32P-Ub chains by 19-fold within 9 min of incubation (Fig. 1A). Surprisingly, Ubc5c-catalyzed Ub polymerization was not significantly affected by Nedd8 modification at all of the time points tested (Fig.1B). Furthermore, Nedd8 activation was not observed with Ubc5c that was present in subsaturating levels (Fig. 1C). This excludes the possibility that the apparent absence of activation by Nedd8 with Ubc5c was due to the use of saturating levels of the E2 protein. Similarly, no Nedd8 activation was detected when Ubc4, which shares a high degree of sequence homology with Ubc5, was used as the E2 in the reaction (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the conjugation of Nedd8 to CUL1 selectively activates Cdc34-catalyzed, but not Ubc4/5c-catalyzed, polyubiquitin chain formation. We next explored the difference between Cdc34 and Ubc5c in the utilization of Ub lysine receptor residue(s) for the assembly of polyubiquitin chains. Consistent with our previous observation (5Tan P. Fuchs S.Y. Chen A. Wu K. Gomez C. Ronai Z. Pan Z.-Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 527-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), when UbK48R was used in place of the wild type Ub, Cdc34-catalyzed polyubiquitin chain formation was almost completely inhibited (Fig. 2A), confirming that Cdc34 assembles Lys48-linked Ub chains. In contrast, when Ubc5c was used as the E2, polyubiquitin chains were still assembled efficiently (Fig. 2B, lanes 2–5). Conjugation of Nedd8 to CUL1 had no significant effect on the Ubc5c-catalyzed synthesis of non-Lys48-linked (most likely Lys29-linked; Refs. 22Mastrandrea L.D. You J. Niles E.G. Pickart C.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 19871-19878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) Ub chains (lanes 6–9). Taken together, these results show that Nedd8 specifically activates the Cdc34 catalyzed synthesis of Lys48-linked multi-Ub chains. The above studies suggest a specific cooperation between Nedd8 and Cdc34 that promotes the Ub polymerization reaction. Previous studies have demonstrated that the C terminus ofS. cerevisiae Cdc34 is required for cell cycle control (24Silver E.T. Gwozd T.J. Ptak C. Goebl M. Ellison M.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3091-3098Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar,25Kolman C.J. Toth J. Gonda D.K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3081-3090Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and that residues 171–209 constitute a minimal motif both necessary and sufficient for binding to the SCF components (26Mathias N. Steussy C.N. Goebl M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4040-4045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These findings prompted us to examine the role of the C-terminal tail of human Cdc34 in mediating the Nedd8 stimulated and ROC1-CUL1-dependent Ub polymerization by deletion analysis. Based on sequence alignment to its S. cerevisiaecounterpart, the human Cdc34 contains a C-terminal tail spanning residues 171–236. Both the wild type and the three C-terminally truncated Cdc34 proteins (Cdc34 residues 1–169, 1–194, and 1–208) were expressed in bacteria and purified to homogeneity as judged by Coomassie staining analysis (Fig.3A). Purified Cdc34 protein possesses a number of biochemical activities. These include the ability of Cdc34 to conjugate Ub in the presence of E1, to catalyze autoubiquitination (27Banerjee A. Gregori L. Xu Y. Chau V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5668-5675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to directly interact with ROC1-CUL1 for assembling Lys48-linked multi-Ub chains (11Chen A. Wu K. Fuchs S.Y. Tan P. Gomez C. Pan Z.-Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15432-15439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and to cooperate with Nedd8 for the activated synthesis of Ub polymers (Ref. 21Wu K. Chen A. Pan Z.-Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32317-32324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar; Fig. 1). In keeping with the notion that the Ubc domain (spanning amino acid residues 1–170 in human Cdc34; Ref. 28Scheffner M. Smith S. Jentsch S. Peters J.-M. Harris J.R. Finley D. Ubiquitin and the Biology of the Cell. Plenum, New York1998: 65-98Crossref Google Scholar) is responsible for Ub conjugation activity, all three truncated Cdc34 proteins retained their ability to conjugate Ub in the presence of E1 (Fig. 3B). The observed DTT-insensitive Cdc34-Ub conjugates are monoubiquitinated species (see below). Banerjee et al. (27Banerjee A. Gregori L. Xu Y. Chau V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5668-5675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have previously shown that the purifiedS. cerevisiae Cdc34 protein catalyzes its own ubiquitination to assemble a multi-Ub chain on a lysine residue within its C terminus. As shown, human Cdc34 alone produced an array of Ub conjugates (Fig.3C, lane 4). While the predominant reaction product was the monoubiquitinated Cdc34 that migrated as a doublet of ∼47 kDa, other Ub conjugates included the E2 protein linked with chains composed of up to five Ub moieties. Cdc34 (aa 1–208) was more active than the wild type protein in catalyzing autoubiquitination, producing Ub conjugates with molecular masses up to 200 kDa (lane 6). Cdc34 (aa 1–194) catalyzed autoubiquitination with an efficiency comparable with that observed with the wild type protein (compare lanes 4 and 8). Interestingly, while Cdc34 (aa 1–169) was still capable of mono- and diubiquitination, it did not form multi-Ub chains (lane 10), suggesting a processivity deficiency in polymerizing Ub. Taken together, these results implicate a role for Cdc34 residues 170–194 in promoting the formation of polyubiquitin chains. In the presence of ROC1-CUL1, but in the absence of Nedd8 modification, Cdc34 (aa 1–208) supported multi-Ub chain assembly, albeit with ∼100-fold lower efficiency compared with the wild type (Fig.3D, compare lanes 4 and 5and lanes 10 and 11). Under these conditions, both the wild type and Cdc34 (aa 1–208) assembled Ub chains with molecular mass greater than 200 kDa, demonstrating a role for ROC1-CUL1 in promoting the assembly of extensive polyubiquitin chains. Cdc34 (aa 1–194) was only barely stimulated by ROC1-CUL1 (compare lanes 15 and 17). Furthermore, in contrast to both the wild type and Cdc34 (aa 1–208), Ub polymers formed by Cdc34 (aa 1–194) and ROC1-CUL1 were predominantly those of limited lengths that migrated in the range of 70–100 kDa. Finally, the addition of ROC1-CUL1 could not activate Cdc34 (aa 1–169) to assemble multi-Ub chains (Fig. 3D,lanes 20–23). These results demonstrate that the extreme C terminus of human Cdc34 (residues 209–236) is required for its maximal activity in catalyzing ROC1-CUL1-dependent synthesis of Ub polymers. Furthermore, assembly of extensive polyubiquitin chains by ROC1-CUL1 requires"

Med. 2000; 192: 421-431Google Scholar). LTA4 hydrolase (EC 3.3.2.6) is a bifunctional zinc metalloenzyme, which integrates a sophisticated epoxide hydrolase activity, specific for the fatty acid derivative LTA4 with an anion-dependent aminopeptidase activity in a common active center; for a review see Ref.11. The enzyme belongs to the M1 family of zinc metallopeptidases (12Barret A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Barret A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, London1998: 994-996Google Scholar), which include enzymes such as aminopeptidase A (EC 3.4.11.7, APA), aminopeptidase B (EC 3.4.11.6, APB) and aminopeptidase N (EC 3.4.11.2, APN) (see Fig. 1). A common structural feature in this group of enzymes is the zinc binding motif HEXXH(X18)E (13Vallee B.L. Auld D.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5647-5659Google Scholar), and in LTA4H the zinc is coordinated by His-295, His-299, and Glu-318 (14Medina J.F. Wetterholm A. Rådmark O. Shapiro R. Haeggström J.Z. Vallee B.L. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7620-7624Google Scholar). Both enzyme activities of LTA4H require the catalytic zinc. The aminopeptidase activity accepts a variety of substrates and certain arginyl di- and tripeptides as well as p-nitroanilide derivatives of Ala and Arg are hydrolyzed with high efficiencies (15Orning L. Gierse J.K. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11269-11273Google Scholar). Although it has never been proven, it is generally assumed that the aminopeptidase activity is involved in the processing of peptides related to inflammation and host-defense. Furthermore, this enzyme activity can be selectively abolished by mutation of either of the conserved Glu-296 or Tyr-383, presumably acting as a general base and proton donor, respectively (16Wetterholm A. Medina J.F. Rådmark O. Shapiro R. Haeggström J.Z. Vallee B.L. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9141-9145Google Scholar, 17Blomster M. Wetterholm A. Mueller M.J. Haeggström J.Z. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 528-534Google Scholar). The members of the M1 family of metallopeptidases also share a conserved motif,GXMEN (Fig. 1), that is located N-terminally to the zinc site, and for APA and APN recent data have suggested that it participates in the exopeptidase function of these enzymes (18Vazeux G. Iturrioz X. Corvol P. Llorenz-Cortez C. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 407-413Google Scholar, 19Luciani N. Marie-Claire C. Ruffet E. Beaumont A. Roques B.P. Fournié-Zaluski M.-C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 686-692Google Scholar). The epoxide hydrolase reaction, i.e. the conversion of LTA4 into LTB4, is unique in that the stereospecific introduction of a hydroxyl group occurs at a site distant from the epoxide moiety, and it has been suggested that it proceeds via a delocalized carbocation intermediate. Unlike the aminopeptidase activity, the epoxide hydrolase activity of LTA4H is restrained by suicide inactivation, which involves binding of LTA4 to Tyr-378 (20Mueller M.J. Wetterholm A. Blomster M. Jörnvall H. Samuelsson B. Haeggström J.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8383-8387Google Scholar, 21Mueller M.J. Blomster M. Oppermann U.C.T. Jornvall H. Samuelsson B. Haeggström J.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5931-5935Google Scholar). However, besides the zinc binding ligands, no single amino acid residue critical for the epoxide hydrolase activity has yet been identified. Recently, we determined the x-ray crystal structure of LTA4H at 1.95 Å resolution in complex with bestatin (22Thunnissen M.G.M. Nordlund P. Haeggström J.Z. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 131-135Google Scholar). In the structure, Glu-271, which is located within the GXMEN motif, and Gln-136 are positioned at the active site near the catalytic residue Glu-296, as well as the catalytic zinc and its three amino acid ligands (Fig. 2). Furthermore, Glu-271 and Gln-136 make interactions with bestatin suggesting that they might be involved in the aminopeptidase activity of LTA4H. In the present report, we show that Glu-271, but not Gln-136, is a catalytic residue that is shared between the epoxide hydrolase and aminopeptidase activities of LTA4H. Yet, Glu-271 carries out a separate chemistry in each of the two reaction mechanisms. We propose mechanistic models in which Glu-271 both participates in the initial activation of the epoxide moiety of the substrate LTA4 and contributes to the binding of the N-terminal amine and the exopeptidase nature of the peptide-cleaving activity. Moreover, it is likely that the conclusions regarding the aminopeptidase activity are valid for all members of the M1 family of metallopeptidases and that the GXMEN sequence qualifies as a consensus motif for an N-terminal recognition site. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by PCR on the recombinant plasmid pT3MB4 for expression of His6-tagged LTA4H in Escherichia coli. Briefly, it involves two consecutive steps of PCR comprising four different primers, according to the megaprimer method (23Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407Google Scholar). The first reaction includes a modified primer (A) carrying the mutation and a second primer (B) comprising a restriction site within the LTA4H cDNA. Together, primers A and B amplify a DNA fragment denominated megaprimer. In the next PCR, the megaprimer is used together with a fourth primer (C) containing another restriction site to amplify a final fragment carrying the mutation and two different restriction sites at its ends. Polymerase chain reactions were carried out in a total volume of 50 μl, using 1× Pfu polymerase buffer, 125–150 ng each of primers A and B, 1 unit Pfu polymerase, 10 nmol each of dNTPs and 100 ng of template. In the second reaction, 15–20 μl of the first PCR mix was used to supply with the megaprimer, which was used together with a primer C (125–150 ng). The amplification program included an initial round of denaturation at 94 °C (60 s), annealing at 55–66 °C (60 s), and elongation at 72 °C (90 s) followed by 30 cycles of denaturation (45 s), annealing (30 s), and elongation (60 s) on a PE GeneAmp PCR System 2400. For generation of [Q136L], [Q136N] and [Q136A]LTA4H, aSalI and BglII site were used whereas aBglII and a BfrI site were used for [G268A], [G269A], [M270L], [E271Q], [E271D], [E271A] and [N272A]LTA4H. DNA fragments were cleaved withSalI/BglII or BglII/BfrI and purified by agarose gel electrophoresis (1.5%) followed by extraction (QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit). Mutated fragments were ligated into pT3MB4 (T4 DNA Ligase Protocol), opened with the respective pair of restriction enzymes. Competent E. colicells (JM101) were transformed with mutated recombinant plasmid and grown in LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Stock cultures were kept at −70 °C in a 1:1 mixture of culture medium and 40% (v/v) glycerol/0.75% (w/v) NaCl, respectively. Recombinant plasmids were purified using Wizard Minipreps Plus, and the entire mutated inserts were all sequenced using Dyenamic ET terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) to confirm that no nucleotide alterations had occurred in addition to the desired mutation. Mutated enzymes were expressed as N-terminal His6-tagged fusion proteins in E. coli (JM101) cells grown at 37 °C in M9 medium (50 mm Na2HPO4, 22 mmKH2PO4, 20 mm NH4Cl, 8.5 mm NaCl), pH 7.4, containing 0.4% glucose (w/v), 0.2% (w/v) casamino acids, 2 mm MgSO4 and 0.1 mm CaCl2. At A620≈ 0.2, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 500 μm. Cells were harvested atA620 ≈ 1.8, pelleted at 1000 ×g and resuspended in 30 ml of homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing soybean trypsin inhibitor) supplemented with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm). Nucleic acids were removed by streptomycin sulfate precipitation. After centrifugation (10,000 × g for 15 min), the supernatant was filtered (0.22 μm) and applied to a nickel-NTA (nitrilotriacetic acid) resin. The column was washed with 1 bed volume of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, and 0.5 m NaCl, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with each solution supplemented with 10 mm imidazole. The final wash consisted of 0.8 bed volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm imidazole. The His-tagged protein was eluted with 0.6 bed volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm imidazole. If required, a final step of anion-exchange chromatography on a Mono Q HR5/5 column was used. The resin was equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and eluted with a linear gradient of KCl (0–0.5 m) in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0. The purity of the final preparation was assessed by SDS-PAGE on an Amersham Biosciences, Inc. Phast system using 10–15% gradient gels, subsequently stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method using a MCC/340 96-well multiscan spectrophotometer and bovine serum albumin as standard (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). The aminopeptidase activity was determined in a spectrophotometric assay at 405 nm, using a MCC/340 multiscan spectrophotometer, essentially as described (25Wetterholm A. Haeggström J.Z. Samuelsson B. Yuan W. Munoz B. Wong C.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 275: 31-37Google Scholar). Briefly, the enzyme (1–20 μg) was incubated at room temperature in 96-well microtiter plates with alanine-p-nitroanilide (Ala-p-NA) as substrate in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm KCl. Additional aminopeptidase assays were performed similarly with Leu-p-NA and Lys-p-NA as substrates. The absorbance at 405 nm was measured at 10-min intervals. Different concentrations of substrate (0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 mm) were used for kinetic determinations. Spontaneous hydrolysis of the substrate was corrected for by subtracting the absorbance of blank incubations without enzyme. The epoxide hydrolase activity was determined from incubations of enzyme (1–20 μg) in 100 μl of 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, with LTA4 (2.5–125 μm) for 30 s on ice. Reactions were quenched with 200 μl of MeOH, followed by the addition of 0.4 nmol of prostaglandin B1(PGB1) or PGB2 as internal standard. Samples were acidified with 5 μl of acetic acid (10%), and metabolites were extracted on solid phase Chromabond C18 columns. Enzymatic metabolites of LTA4 were identified and quantified by reverse-phase HPLC. Metabolites of LTA4 were separated by isocratic reverse-phase HPLC on a Waters Nova-Pak C18 column eluted with a mixture of methanol/acetonitrile/water/acetic acid (30:30:40:0.01 by volume) at a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min. The UV detector was set at 270 nm, and metabolites were quantified using Chromatography Station for Windows version 1.7 computer software. Calculations were based on peak area measurements and the known extinction coefficients for the internal standards PGB1 and PGB2 (30 000m−1 × cm−1) as well as LTB4 (50 000 m−1 × cm−1). Plate-like crystals of [E271Q]LTA4H were obtained by liquid-liquid diffusion in capillaries, as described (22Thunnissen M.G.M. Nordlund P. Haeggström J.Z. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 131-135Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μl of precipitation solution (28% (v/v) PEG8000, 0.1 mm sodium acetate, 0.1 mm imidazole buffer, pH 6.8, and 5 mm YbCl3) was injected into the bottom of a melting point capillary, and an equal volume of LTA4H (5 mg/ml) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, was layered on top. For data collection, crystals were soaked in 15% PEG8000, 50 mmimidazole buffer, pH 6.8, 50 mm sodium-acetate, 2.5 mm YbCl3, and 25% glycerol and analyzed at the Beamline I711 of the synchrotron station Max-Lab in Lund, Sweden. A complete set of data was collected from a single crystal. The crystals belonged to space-group P212121with cell dimensions a = 77.962, b = 86.873, c = 98.787, α = β = γ = 90° at 100 K. Statistics on data collection and quality are given in Table I. Processing, scaling, and merging of data were carried out using the program package Denzo/Scalepack (26Otwinowski Z. Data Collection and Processing. Proceedings of the CCP 4 Study Weekend. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1993: 56-62Google Scholar). The structure of [E271Q]LTA4H was solved with molecular replacement using the program AMoRe (27Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Google Scholar), and the structure of wild type LTA4H as a search model (22Thunnissen M.G.M. Nordlund P. Haeggström J.Z. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 131-135Google Scholar). All subsequent refinement was done using the CNS package (28Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar) and manual model building as well as interpretation of electron density maps with the programs QUANTA (Molecular Simulations, Inc) and XtalView (29McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Google Scholar). During the refinement 582 water molecules, one Zn2+ion, one acetate molecule, and one Yb3+ ion were identified. After a final round of refinement, including all data between 25–2.1 Å and all 610 amino acids, the R-factor was 18.2% and the Rfree factor was 23.3%. Most of the model of [E271Q]LTA4H is in good density except for the His6 tag and the first four N-terminal residues. The model exhibits a highly restrained but acceptable stereochemistry with 99.6% of the residues lying in the most favored or additionally allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. Root mean square deviations for bond lengths and angles are 0.01 Å and 1.6°, respectively.Table IData collection and refinement statisticsData collection statistics Diffraction limit (Å)2.05 Wavelength (Å)0.9831 Completeness (%)99.6 Mean I/ς (I)10.3 Multiplicity of observation4.5 Rmerge1-aRmerge = ΣhΣi‖I1 (h) −I(h)‖/ΣhΣ1I1(h), where I1 (h) is the ith measurement of reflection h and I(h) is the weighted mean of all measurements of h.(%)8Refinement statistics R-factor1-bR-factor = Σh‖Fobs(h) −Fcalc(h)‖/ΣhFobs(h), where Fobs and Fcalc are the observed and calculated factor amplitudes, respectively.(%)18.2 Rfree1-cRfree is theR-factor calculated for the test set of reflections, which are omitted during the refinement process.(%)23.3 r.m.s.d. in bond distance (Å)0.01 r.m.s.d. in bond angle (°)1.61-a Rmerge = ΣhΣi‖I1 (h) −I(h)‖/ΣhΣ1I1(h), where I1 (h) is the ith measurement of reflection h and I(h) is the weighted mean of all measurements of h.1-b R-factor = Σh‖Fobs(h) −Fcalc(h)‖/ΣhFobs(h), where Fobs and Fcalc are the observed and calculated factor amplitudes, respectively.1-c Rfree is theR-factor calculated for the test set of reflections, which are omitted during the refinement process. Open table in a new tab To model the binding of Ala-p-NA, the program AutoDock 3.0 (30Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Google Scholar) was used. The substrate, assumed to be protonated with a positively charged amino group, was initially modeled manually into the active site of LTA4H using the program XtalView. The binding conformation was then optimized using the local search algorithm of AutoDock 3.0. Prior to the docking, addition of polar hydrogens and assignment of atomic charges to the model of LTA4H was done using the program QUANTA, which was also used to construct the atomic coordinates of Ala-p-NA. The program MOPAC (31Stewart J.J.P. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1990; 4: 1-45Google Scholar) was used to assign atomic partial charges to the ligand and to further optimize its coordinates prior to the docking calculation. In all other aspects of the docking process, programs included in the AutoDock 3.0 program package were used. To detail their function we exchanged Glu-271 for a Gln, Asp, or Ala residue, whereas Gln-136 was replaced with an Asn, Leu, and Ala by site-directed mutagenesis. In addition, the remaining residues in the GXMEN signature,viz. Gly-268, Gly-269, Met-270, and Asn-272 were mutated into Ala, Ala, Leu, and Ala, respectively. The resulting 10 mutants were all expressed as His6-tagged fusion proteins inE. coli to allow rapid and convenient purification on nickel-NTA resins. The level of expression was similar for wild type enzyme and all mutants, with a final yield of about 2–5 mg of purified protein per liter of cell culture. Exchange of Glu-271 for a Gln, Asp, or Ala residue resulted in a complete loss of the epoxide hydrolase activity (Table II), even when the amounts of enzyme were increased 40 times (100 μg) in the incubation mixture. In contrast, mutants at the other positions within the GXMEN motif,i.e. [G268A], [G269A], [M270L], and [N272A]LTA4H, displayed variable, albeit significant, epoxide hydrolase activities. Thus, values of Vmax andkcat ranged between 19–135% relative to the wild type enzyme, whereas the corresponding values forKm ranged between 21–202%. As a result, the specificity constant kcat/Kmvaried between 67 and 117%.Table IIMutagenetic replacements, effects on the epoxide hydrolase, and aminopeptidase activitiesMutantEpoxide hydrolase activityAminopeptidase activitykcatKmkcat/KmkcatKmkcat/KmQ136A34 ± 267 ± 1651103 ± 10108 ± 2495Q136L57 ± 5179 ± 59322-aThe mutant Q136L was catalytically active but did not obey saturation kinetics, using Ala-p-NA as substrate.

For the aminopeptidase activity, the corresponding values of kcat andKm for the wild type enzyme were 1.16–1.81 s−1 and 2.3–3.8 mm, respectively. The aminopeptidase activity of [E271Q], [E271D], and [E271A]LTA4H against Ala-p-NA was essentially abolished (Table II) and similar results were obtained with Lys-p-NA and Leu-p-NA (data not shown). In contrast, the aminopeptidase activity of [G268A], [G269A], [M270L], and [N272A]LTA4H were moderately, if at all, affected with values ofVmax (kcat) andKm ranging between 18–218% and 66–221%, respectively, relative to the wild type enzyme. The corresponding specificity constants were between 8 and 301% that of the wild type enzyme. Exchange of Gln-136 for a Leu, Asn, or Ala residue did not significantly affect the epoxide hydrolase activity of LTA4H (Table II). Values of Vmax(kcat) and Km for [Q136L], [Q136N], and [Q136A]LTA4H reached 20–57% and 18–179% of the wild type control, respectively. On the other hand, the mutations led to highly variable effects on both the turnover, and the Michaelis constant for the peptidase substrate Ala-p-NA (Table II). Thus, [Q136L]LTA4H did not obey saturation kinetics and displayed a linear increase in reaction velocity in the substrate interval 0.125–8.0 mm Ala-p-NA. In contrast, [Q136N]LTA4H lacked almost completely the ability to hydrolyze Ala-p-NA, whereas the peptidase activity of [Q136A]LTA4H did not differ from that of wild type enzyme, with values ofVmax (kcat) andKm mounting to 103 and 108%, respectively. This large variation in the effects of mutation of Gln-136 makes it difficult to draw any conclusions regarding its functional role. However, since the mutant in which the side chain was extensively truncated retained all of its peptide-cleaving ability, the most likely interpretation is that Gln-136 does not play any significant role in this catalytic reaction. The mutant and wild type enzymes crystallize non-isomorphously and also bind a different number of Yb3+ ions. Thus, the wild type enzyme crystallizes in space-group P21212 with three Yb3+ligands per asymmetric unit, whereas the mutant enzyme crystallizes in space-group P212121 with only one Yb3+ ligand per asymmetric unit. In the wild type structure, the Zn2+ ion is coordinated to His-295, His-299, one carboxylic oxygen of Glu-318, and the hydroxyl and carbonyl oxygens of bestatin in a pentavalent coordination sphere, forming a square-based pyramid (Fig. 2). In the structure of [E271Q]LTA4H, the Zn2+ is bound to its three canonical amino acid ligands and one carboxylic oxygen of an acetate molecule. These four ligands form an almost ideal tetrahedral coordination geometry. The acetate molecule is also hydrogen-bonded to Tyr-383 and Gln-271. Exchange of Glu-271 for a Gln does not cause any significant conformational change of the active site (Fig.3). Superpositioning of the mutant and wild type models gives an overall r.m.s. deviation for 610 α-carbons of 0.45 Å. Inspection of the superimposed models shows that the differences are evenly spread over the molecules. The only exceptions are two surface loops, which exhibit higher r.m.s. deviations; these differences in α-carbon positioning are probably due to crystal packing differences. Of note, residues lining the active site, including the deeper part of the hydrophobic pocket, show a positional shift in relation to the wild type structure, which is comparable with the rest of the molecule. Thus, the major outline of the active site is well conserved in the mutant structure. However, when comparing the structures of the wild type and mutated enzyme in detail, a small rearrangement of spatially neighboring residues can be observed, which may be explained by the mutation and/or the absence of inhibitor in the crystal of [E271Q]LTA4H. Directly affected residues, besides Glu-271, are Glu-296 and Gln-136. The changes are subtle and mainly affect the hydrogen-bonding network. The orientation of the amide side-chain of Gln-271 cannot be judged from electron density, and it was instead determined based on changes in hydrogen-bonding network. Glu-271 in the wild type structure is hydrogen-bonded to its own backbone amide and to the free amine of the bound inhibitor bestatin. In [E271Q]LTA4H, the orientation of the amide side group does not allow direct interaction with its backbone amide. Instead, new direct hydrogen bonds are observed to the acetate bound in the active site and to a water molecule now occupying the position held by the free amine of bestatin in the wild type structure. The absence of inhibitor and the hydrogen bonding to the amide group of Gln-271 pull Glu-296 toward the backbone amide of Gln-271. Furthermore, in the mutant structure, Gln-136 is flipped about 90 degrees, which creates a hydrogen bond to Glu-271 and to a new water molecule replacing the free amine of bestatin. Another water molecule, at a position corresponding to the phenyl ring of bestatin, also makes a hydrogen bond to Gln-136. Thus, both the mutation and the absence of inhibitor could explain the positional change of Gln-136. Similarly, the torsional flip observed for Met-270 and the positional shift of Gln-134 are most likely effects caused by the absence of inhibitor. Ala-p-NA is a good aminopeptidase substrate for LTA4H. The binding conformation with the lowest energy of a docked Ala-p-NA at the active site of LTA4H agreed very well with biochemical data and is presented in Fig.4. Thus, the free amine of Ala-p-NA donates one hydrogen bond to each of the carboxyl groups of Glu-271 an"
https://openalex.org/W2011235705,"Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) exerts a variety of actions as a second messenger or as an agonist that binds to one or more members of the Edg family of G protein-coupled receptors. By using human embryonic kidney 293 cells, we show that S1P activates nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in a receptor-dependent fashion. Edg-3 and Edg-5, which are coupled to Gi, Gq, and G13, affect activation of NF-κB, whereas Edg-1, which is coupled to Gi alone, does not. We find that the activation of NF-κB requires protein kinase C and Ca2+, probably downstream of Gq, but that the activation of Rho alone by S1P, whether through Gq or G13, does not translate into the activation of NF-κB. Gβγ has little effect of its own but potentiates the activation of NF-κB achieved through other G proteins. We conclude that the activation of NF-κB by S1P is a receptor-mediated process that relies primarily on the activation of a phospholipase C by Gq and secondarily on effector regulation through other G proteins. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) exerts a variety of actions as a second messenger or as an agonist that binds to one or more members of the Edg family of G protein-coupled receptors. By using human embryonic kidney 293 cells, we show that S1P activates nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in a receptor-dependent fashion. Edg-3 and Edg-5, which are coupled to Gi, Gq, and G13, affect activation of NF-κB, whereas Edg-1, which is coupled to Gi alone, does not. We find that the activation of NF-κB requires protein kinase C and Ca2+, probably downstream of Gq, but that the activation of Rho alone by S1P, whether through Gq or G13, does not translate into the activation of NF-κB. Gβγ has little effect of its own but potentiates the activation of NF-κB achieved through other G proteins. We conclude that the activation of NF-κB by S1P is a receptor-mediated process that relies primarily on the activation of a phospholipase C by Gq and secondarily on effector regulation through other G proteins. nuclear factor-κB 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetra(acetoxymethyl) ester C. botulinum C3 exoenzyme GTP-binding regulatory protein G protein-coupled receptor lysophosphatidic acid protein kinase C phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate sphingosine 1-phosphate serum-response factor human embryonic kidney Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate The transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)1 responds to a large number of environmental cues and is especially relevant to inflammation and apoptotic/anti-apoptotic signaling. Often viewed as a target for proinflammatory cytokines, NF-κB is also activated by agonists that work through a subset of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), including those for thrombin (1Mari B.

Bradykinin, for example, induces an NF-κB-dependent expression of the interleukin-1 gene in both fibroblasts and epithelial cells (3Pan Z.K. Zuraw B.L. Lung C.-C. Prossnitz E.R. Browning D.D. Ye R.D.

One possibility is that NF-κB is activated as a result of Ras, Raf, and/or pp90rsk activation (10Finco T.S. Baldwin A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17676-17679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Li S. Sedivy J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1997; 278: 1812-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). The activation of Ras, and consequently of Raf and pp90rsk, is a property of Gβγ released typically from the heterotrimeric G protein Gi (13Luttrell L.M. van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Koch W.J.

Treatment of fibroblasts with a pertussis toxin, which inhibits activation of Gi, indeed suppresses activation of NF-κB by bradykinin and LPA (3Pan Z.K. Zuraw B.L. Lung C.-C. Prossnitz E.R.

Mutationally active forms of all three monomeric G proteins result in activation of NF-κB (15Perona R. Montaner S. Saniger L. Sanchez-Perez I. Bravo R. Lacal J.C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), and the Clostridium botulinum C3 transferase exoenzyme and Rho19N inhibit activation of NF-κB by bradykinin in A549 epithelial cells (7Pan Z.K. Ye R.D. Christiansen S.C. Jagels M.A. Bokoch G.M. Zuraw B.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3038-3045PubMed Google Scholar); sensitivity to C3 implies a role for Rho specifically. A third possibility is that NF-κB is activated through other signaling pathways that, although sometimes interfacing with Ras and Rho family activation cascades, also signal separately. Pathways involving protein kinase C (PKC) and intracellular Ca2+ represent good candidates (16Shatrov V.A. Lehmann V. Chouaib S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Edg-2 was the first of the Edg family to be identified as a receptor in the context of LPA/S1P signaling, mediating activation of the serum-response element by LPA (21Hecht J.H. Weiner J.A. Post S.R.

Edg-1 (endothelial differentiation gene 1) was the founding member of the Edg family, however, having been classified for a number of years as an orphan receptor (25Hla T. Maciag T. J. Biol.

Direct evaluation of heterotrimeric G protein activation in Sf9 and HEK293 cell expression systems argues that the coupling of Edg-1 to Giis in fact exclusive—Edg-1 does not mediate activation of Gs, Gq, G12, or G13(37Windh R.T.

Edg-6 and Edg-8 appear to couple to Gi as well (31Van Brocklyn J.R. Gräler M.H.B.G. Hobson J.P. Lipp M. Spiegel S. Blood. 2000; 95: 2624-2629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,32Im D.-S. Heise C.E.

Edg-3 and Edg-5, like Edg-1, utilize Gi to activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (39An S. Zheng Y. Bleu T. J. Biol.

As expected, Edg-3 and Edg-5 couple to a greater variety of G proteins than does Edg-1, i.e. to Gi, Gq, G12, and G13 (37Windh R.T. Lee M.-J. Hla T. An S. Barr A.J. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27351-27358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Although many of the actions of S1P can be attributed to its signaling through one or more Edg receptors, S1P has also received considerable attention as an intracellular messenger (41Spiegel S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Indeed, several lines of experimentation suggest that S1P acts in this capacity in the reinitiation of DNA synthesis and suppression of apoptosis (35Van Brocklyn J.R. Lee M.-J. Menzeleev R. Olivera A. Edsall L. Cuvillier O. Thomas D.M. Coopman P.J.P. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hla T. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar).We have demonstrated that LPA activates NF-κB in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (14Shahrestanifar M. Fan X. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3828-3833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and others (16Shatrov V.A. Lehmann V. Chouaib S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Whether the activation in any instance was exerted through receptors or not was not addressed, nor in the case of S1P were mechanisms of activation approached beyond those attending Ca2+ mobilization. Given the differences among Edg receptors in coupling to G proteins, the paucity of information regarding the linkage of GPCRs in general to NF-κB, and the possibility that Rho as a downstream target for at least the G12/13 family of G proteins is relevant to the activation of NF-κB by S1P, we wished to pursue the issue of mechanism further. Our studies focused on Edg-1, Edg-3, and Edg-5. We report that Edg-3 and Edg-5, but not Edg-1, promote the activation of NF-κB in HEK293 cells. Although G13 may be relevant, the activation of Rho does not necessarily translate into the activation of NF-κB. We find instead that PKC and Ca2+, which lie downstream of Gq, are critical elements. We contend that the activation of NF-κB by S1P is a receptor-mediated process that involves primarily the activation of phospholipase C probably by Gq and secondarily effector regulation through other G proteins.RESULTSThe capacity of S1P to activate NF-κB was investigated in HEK293 cells, which have been used extensively in studies pertaining to Edg receptor signaling (26Lee M.-J.

Edg receptors (Edg-1, Edg-3, and Edg-5 (H218/AGR16)) were FLAG-tagged at the N terminus and introduced into the cells by transfection. The activation of NF-κB was evaluated using a luciferase gene linked to an enhancer comprising multiple NF-κB-binding sites and a TATA box. Although differences in receptor expression were noted (Fig.1A), they had little impact on functionality (see below). S1P, when added to cells in which no receptor had been introduced, had no effect on reporter gene activity (B). The introduction of Edg-1 did not confer to S1P the capacity to activate the reporter gene, nor did Edg-1 have an effect of its own. In contrast, Edg-3 and Edg-5 both promoted activation of the reporter gene, without and with S1P, with a greater degree of activation achieved with S1P. The S1P-independent activation was consistent with receptor constitutive activity, which we reported elsewhere (37Windh R.T. Lee M.-J. Hla T. An S. Barr A.J. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27351-27358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) for the activation of G proteins. The activation noted for Edg-3 with S1P was about 40% that obtained with a constitutively active mutant of Rho (RhoV14, not shown). The activation was completely suppressed by co-expression of IκBα-S32/36A, a form of IκBα resistant to phosphorylation, and was not observed for the reporter construct lacking NF-κB-binding sites. Activation by S1P through Edg-3 and Edg-5 was dose-dependent, with an EC50 of about 0.1 μm (Fig. 1, Cand D). Downward adjustment in levels of Edg-1 did not unmask a latent capacity to activate NF-κB. Moreover, stable expression of Edg-1 did not reveal a capacity of this sort, although activation by S1P through Edg-5 expressed in a similar fashion was easily discerned. Edg-3 and Edg-5, but not Edg-1, effected activation of NF-κB not only in HEK293 cells but in HeLa, Rh7777, and COS-7 cells also.Edg-1, Edg-3, and Edg-5 each couple to members of the Gifamily of heterotrimeric G proteins (37Windh R.T. Lee M.-J. Hla T. An S. Barr A.J. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27351-27358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Edg-3 and Edg-5 additionally couple to those of the Gq and G12/13 families. The greater range of coupling of Edg-3 and Edg-5 suggests the relevance of Gq, G13 (G12 is not detected by us in HEK293 cells), or both G proteins to the activation of NF-κB. To ascertain the possible relevance of Gq, we evaluated the requirements of NF-κB activation for PKC and Ca2+, which are downstream of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, Ro31-8220, an inhibitor of most forms of PKC, and BAPTA/AM, which upon hydrolysis sequesters intracellular Ca2+, completely suppressed S1P-stimulated reporter gene activity. Ro31-8220 and BAPTA/AM did not alter receptor levels. In addition to Ro31-8220, the PKC inhibitors calphostin C, rottlerin (a PKCδ inhibitor), and bisindolylmaleimide suppressed activity by 60–95% (Table I). These data suggested a requirement for events subsequent to phosphoinositide hydrolysis in the activation of NF-κB. That the activation of PKC was a sufficient stimulus was demonstrated in experiments with PMA (Fig. 2C), which achieved a degree of activation comparable to that obtained with Edg-3 plus S1P and was likewise sensitive to Ro31-8220 and BAPTA/AM. We also found that the activation of NF-κB by PMA, as well as that by S1P through Edg-3 and Edg-5 (Table I), was partly sensitive to genistein and tyrphostin A25.Figure 2Involvement of PKC and calcium in the activation of NF-κB. NF-κB reporter gene activity was evaluated as described in Fig. 1 for HEK293 cells expressing Edg-3 or Edg-5 or treated with PMA. A andB, cells were treated 24 h following transfection with 0.1% Me2SO (vehicle) or 1 μm Ro31-8220 (A) or 16 μm BAPTA-AM (B) for 1 h followed by 1 μm S1P, or no agonist, for an additional 8 h.

Wilson B.A. Toksoz D. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15445-15452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), is a widely used index of Rho activity. The use of a reporter gene assay, in particular, permits comparison to the NF-κB data, which were similarly acquired through use of a reporter gene. We found to our initial surprise that activation of the SRF reporter gene by S1P did not require the introduction of Edg receptors at all, i.e. S1P induced a significant activation of the gene in cells in which no Edg receptor had been introduced (Fig. 3A,Vector). Therefore, although the introduction of Edg-3 or Edg-5 was required for activation of NF-κB, it was not required for activation of SRF. The result for SRF, together with agonist-promoted [35S]GTPγS-binding (37Windh R.T. Lee M.-J. Hla T. An S. Barr A.J. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27351-27358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), is consistent with a receptor for S1P expressed normally by HEK293 cells but which is silent in assays of cell morphology (26Lee M.-J.

Hand A.R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar), and NF-κB activation (here). Importantly, because NF-κB is not activated without introduction of Edg-3 or Edg-5, the result also implies that the activation of Rho inferred from the SRF data does not necessarily translate into activation of NF-κB. Introduction of Edg-1 had no effect on SRF reporter gene activation beyond that observed for cells in which no receptor was introduced. Edg-3 and Edg-5, on the other hand, promoted a 4–6-fold activation of the gene in the absence of S1P, which was doubled again with S1P. That the signal achieved with Edg-3 and Edg-5 in the presence of S1P was not equal to or greater than the sum of S1P-independent activity plus the activity achieved in nontransfected cells with S1P may be attributable to a ceiling for SRF activation.Figure 3Activation of SRF and Rho.A, Edg receptors were introduced into HEK293 cells by transfection together with an SRF firefly luciferase reporter gene and, for normalization, a Renilla luciferase gene under constitutive control. At 24 h, the cells were treated for an additional 8 h with 1 μm S1P (+) or vehicle (−) and then processed for measurement of luciferase activities in lysates. Data are expressed as firefly luciferase activities (± S.E.) relative to the activity observed in the absence of receptor and S1P (n = 3).B, cells in which no receptor had been introduced, or in which Edg-1 or Edg-5 had been introduced by transfection, were incubated for 3 min with (+) or without (−) 1 μm S1P and then lysed. The Rho-binding domain of rhotekin fused to GST and pre-coupled to glutathione beads was added to the lysates, and subsequently pelleted Rho (Rho-GTP) was evaluated in Western blots with rabbit antibodies recognizing RhoA, -B, and -C subtypes or a monoclonal antibody specific for RhoA. Total RhoA, -B, and -C in cell lysate, evaluated by Western blotting, are also shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The assay of SRF, although important in the sense of being procedurally equivalent to that of NF-κB, provides only an indirect indication of Rho activity. We therefore evaluated the activation of Rho directly, using the Rho-binding domain of the effector rhotekin (Fig.3B). As implied by the SRF activation data, S1P activated Rho without any receptor having been introduced. Results obtained with antibodies to RhoA, -B, and -C in aggregate or to RhoA alone were equivalent. The contributions of overexpressed Edg-1, Edg-3 (not shown), and Edg-5 to activation were variable and at best modest. In separate experiments, the activation of Rho by S1P was found to be maximal by 1 min and was sustained up to 20 min; no difference in the kinetics of activation or deactivation were observed with Edg-5 present. We therefore conclude that Rho is activated in response to S1P but that the activation as measured directly here or indirectly through SRF does not achieve the activation of NF-κB. Whether Rho might be required in conjunction with other events (as opposed to being sufficient) could not be tested. Although the C. botulinumC3 transferase exoenzyme inhibited the activation of NF-κB promoted by Edg-3 and Edg-5, it also caused a variable inhibition of Edg receptor expression, precluding interpretations regarding Rho in this context. C3 inhibited by about 60% the activation of NF-κB by PMA, nevertheless implying the relevance of Rho to at least some extent.We additionally investigated the capacity of GTPase-deficient (constitutively active) G protein α subunits to activate NF-κB and SRF. GαqQL achieved a marked activation of the NF-κB reporter gene (Fig. 4A). The activation by Gα12QL and Gα13QL, although significant, was far less pronounced, and subunit expression levels were not evaluated (endogenous subunits and lack of consensus antibodies prevented comparison of subunit expression levels). The pattern of activation of the SRF reporter gene by GαqQL, Gα12QL, and Gα13QL (B), however, was virtually the converse of that observed for NF-κB,i.e. activation of the gene was significantly greater for Gα12QL and Gα13QL than for GαqQL. Thus again a strong correlation does not exist between the activation of NF-κB and SRF. GαiQL in both instances was without effect. Gβγ resulted in a doubling of NF-κB reporter gene activity (not shown) and potentiated to so"

Pestiviruses are plus-stranded RNA viruses whose genome comprises one long open reading frame (3Francki R.I.B. Faquet D.L. Knudson D.L. Brown F. Arch. Virol.

The structural proteins include a nucleocapsid protein C and three envelope glycoproteins Erns, E1 and E2 (6Thiel H.J. Stark R. Weiland E. Rumenapf T. Meyers G. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4705-4712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). classical swine fever virus N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl fluorescein isothiocyanate horseradish peroxidase The envelope glycoprotein Erns is a disulfide-linked homodimer of ∼90 kDa, and approximately half of the molecular weight is contributed by carbohydrates (7Konig M.

Virol. 1993; 67: 3288-3294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is found on the surface of pestivirus-infected cells and is secreted in the medium (8Rumenapf T. Unger G. Strauss J.H. Thiel H.J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3288-3294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Erns was able to bind many cell types (9Hulst M.M. Moormann R.J. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 2779-2787Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and binding of Erns is probably mediated by glycosaminoglycans (10Hulst M.M. van Gennip H.G. Moormann R.J. J.

Two stretches of Erns show sequence homology with ribonuclease Rh, a new class of microbial ribonuclease ofRhizopus niveus, member of the T2/S RNase superfamily (12Horiuchi H. Yanai K. Takagi M.

In line with this homology, Erns indeed contains RNase activity (13Schneider R. Unger G. Stark R. Schneider-Scherzer E. Thiel H.J.

Erns shows immunosuppressive activity since it induced apoptosis in ConA-stimulated T-cells of several species (15Bruschke C.J. Moormann R.J. van Oirschot J.T. van Rijn P.A. Vaccine. 1997; 15: 1940-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, the function for its RNase activity remains elusive. Because an extracellular, secreted protein with RNase activity most likely has an intracellular target, it was anticipated that the molecule had some kind of way to enter the cell. This study describes a modular architecture of the Ernsprotein and shows that the C-terminal domain was able to translocate across eukaryotic cell membranes. It was verified that also the full-length Erns was translocated into cells and the C-terminal Erns domain could be used as a general transport peptide to bring large enzymes into the cell. The basic Erns peptide seems to have a similar ability to translocate proteins as do recently developed carrier peptides like HIV-1 Tat-(48–60) and Antennapedia-(43–58) (16Schwarze S.R. Hruska K.A.

Peptides were synthesized according to standard procedures on an Applied Biosystems 430A synthesizer or on a Hamilton Microlab 2200 (Reno, NV) using Fmoc/HBTU (2“-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate) chemistry. (22Fields C.G. Lloyd D.H. Macdonald R.L. Otteson K.M. Noble R.L. Pept. Res. 1991; 4: 95-101PubMed Google Scholar) After removal of the last Fmoc group, peptides were biotinylated using 0.45 m biotin, which was activated for 15 min in 0.45 mHBTU/1-hydroxybenzotriazole inN,N-dimethylformamide. After 1 h the reaction was stopped by washing five times withN-methyl-2-pyrrolidone and three times with EtOH. The purity of the peptides was >90% as determined by analytical liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Erns of CSFV strain C (amino acids 268–494 of the CSFV polyprotein) was expressed by a recombinant baculovirus in sf21 cells as described previously (10Hulst M.M. van Gennip H.G. Moormann R.J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9553-9561Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 14Hulst M.M. Himes G. Newbigin E. Moormann R.J. Virology. 1994; 200: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Translocation of the peptide across the plasma membrane was studied by incubation of live cells in suspension or subconfluent monolayers on coverslips with biotinylated peptide (200–0.4 μg/ml culture medium) for 1, 10, 30, 45, or 120 min. After the time period, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde or cold methanol and labeled with streptavidin-FITC as described above. Fixed cells were inspected with fluorescence microscopy. Internalization was established with confocal microscopy. Comparison of translocation activity of different peptides was done by visual inspection of fluorescence intensity of titrated peptides that were stained by streptavidin-FITC. The following cell lines were used: A72, canine fibroblast tumor cells; MDCK, canine kidney epithelial cells; CCO, sheat-fish ovary cells; EK-1, Eel kidney cells; CHS-E, salmon embryonal cells; BUEC, bovine umbilical endothelial cells; BFDL, bovine fetal diploı̈d lung cells (fibroblast); PUEC, porcine umbilical endothelial cells; HT 29, colorectal adenocarcinoma, colon epithelial cells; CaCo-2, colorectal adenocarcinoma, colon epithelial cells; HeLa, adenocarcinoma, cervix; Vero, normal monkey kidney epithelial cells; SK6, swine kidney cells; NPTh, newborn pig thyroid cells; ECTC, embryonal calf thyroid cells; MDBK, normal bovine kidney epithelial cells; EBTr, epithelial bovine trachea cells; bovine sperm cells; Sp20, mouse myeloma B-cells. Enzymatic activity of translocated streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (DAKO) was assessed by staining with 0.02% 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole for 5 min, and translocated streptavidin-β-galactosidase (Sigma) was assessed by staining with 0.1% 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) for 20 min. Stained cells as described above were analyzed using a confocal laser scanning microscope with an Argon laser using an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission of 515 nm using a blue high sensitive block. Hemolytic activity of various peptide concentrations were determined by incubation with human, guinea pig, or sheep erythrocyte suspensions (final erythrocyte concentration, 1% v/v) for 1 h at 37 °C. After cooling and centrifugation, the optical density of the supernatants were measured at 540 nm. Peptide concentrations causing 50% hemolysis (EC50) were derived from the dose-response curves. Erythrocytes were suspended in a buffer (10 mm Hepes/150 mm (NaCl + KCl)/1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) containing 97 mm (−9 mV) or 4 mm (−70 mV) K+. The resting potential of −9 mV approximates the resting potential of human erythrocytes (23Matsuzaki K. Sugishita K. Fujii N. Miyajima K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3423-3429Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The transmembrane potential was generated by addition of valinomycin (6.7 μm for 1% hematocrit). HeLa or EBTr cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics in a humidified atmosphere supplied with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Exponentially growing cells were treated with trypsin and transferred to wells of a 96-well microtiter plate. Resulting in ∼300 cells for each 30 μl of growth medium containing various concentrations of peptide. After incubation for 75 min (the plates were incubated upside down to avoid anchorage) the cells were transferred and plated in wells of tissue culture plates that contained 100 μl of growth medium. Cell growth was checked after 3–6 days. Nucleoli-specific staining was performed as described (24Franklin A.L. Filion W.G. Stain Technol. 1981; 56: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In short, cells were incubated for 30 min with biotinylated peptide as described above. After washing, the cells were fixed with methanol at −20 °C, washed with sodium acetate buffer (0.01 m, pH 4.9). Cells were washed and incubated with 40 μl of streptavidin-Texas Red (10 μg/ml) at 37 °C, incubated with Acridine Orange (1 μg/ml; room temperature, pH 4.9), washed, and incubated with 0.01% methyl green (pH 4.9). Cells were inspected with fluorescence microscopy at 490, 595/615, and 503/515 nm. A structural model of Erns was built by homology modeling based on an approximate sequence alignment of pestivirus Erns with ribonuclease Rh (RNase Rh). 2J. P. M. Langedijk, P. van Veelen, W. M. Schaaper, R. H. Meloen, M. M. Hulst, manuscript in preparation. The alignment, which is shown schematically in Fig. 1, showed that the 37 C-terminal residues of Erns do not align with RNase Rh and seem to form a separate region. The C-terminal region has no potential glycosylation sites, has a high number of positive charges and a high score for amphipathic helicity. A helical wheel representation of residues 194–220 shows an amphipathic helix with a hydrophobic face and a positively charged face (Fig.2). The only three residues that do not correspond with the amphipathicity are Ile-210, Arg-214, and Arg-218. Such a positively charged domain in an RNase molecule is not unique for Erns but has also been observed in type II ribotoxins, another class of RNases. This class of RNases are extracellular cytotoxins that are able to translocate across phospholipid bilayers (25Gasset M. Mancheno J.M. Lacadena J. Turnay J. Olmo N. Lizarbe M.A. Martinez del Pozo A. Onaderra M. Gavilanes J.G. Curr. Top. Pept. Protein. Res. 1994; 1: 99-104Google Scholar) and hydrolyze the large ribosomal RNA (26Schindler D.G. Davies J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1977; 4: 1097-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Although ribotoxins are known to enter cells, it is not known which region of the protein is responsible for translocation. The type II ribotoxins like α-sarcin and restrictocin contain a large inserted L3 loop (residue 53–91) compared with other RNases of the T1 superfamily (27Yang X. Moffat K. Structure. 1996; 4: 837-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 28Mancheno J.M. Gasset M. Lacadena J. Martinez del Pozo A. Onaderra M. Gavilanes J.G. J. Theor. Biol. 1995; 172: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This loop has structural similarity (but no sequence similarity) to loops found in lectin sugar-binding domains and may be responsible for the ribotoxins ability to bind the cell surface (27Yang X. Moffat K. Structure. 1996; 4: 837-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of Erns has approximately the same length and contains similar sequence motifs as the ribotoxin II L3 loop (Fig.3). Although the sequence similarity between the ribotoxin L3 loop and the C terminus of Erns is low (Fig. 3), it is higher than the sequence similarity between L3 and the structurally similar lectin binding domains (27Yang X. Moffat K. Structure. 1996; 4: 837-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Although the ribotoxin L3 loop is also positively charged, it has no apparent amphipathic character. Another interesting homology of the Erns C-terminal region is with the membrane-interacting peptide magainin. The center of the Erns peptide has sequence homology with the N-terminal half of magainin (Fig. 3). This homology is even higher compared with the homology of magainin with other pore-forming peptides that have been described (29Matsuzaki K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar).Figure 2Helical wheel representation of residues 194–220 of CSFV Erns.

After washing with phosphate-buffered saline the cells were fixed with cold methanol, and Erns was detected by incubation with a mix of monoclonal antibodies 140.1 and C5 (1/200) directed against Erns and a second incubation with rabbit anti mouse-FITC (1/70) (F0261, DAKO). Erns could be detected outside as well as inside the cell by confocal microscopy. Accumulation could be observed around the nucleus (Fig. 4). Because the C-terminal region was identified as a separate domain that shows homology with a pore-forming peptide and a peptide that probably interacts with cell surfaces, peptides were synthesized corresponding to the C-terminal domain and tested for translocation activity. Cell suspensions (mouse myeloma and bovine sperm) and subconfluent monolayers of 17 different cell types (see “Experimental Procedures”) were incubated for 1 h with biotinylated Erns peptide and fixed with cold methanol. Inspection with fluorescent microscopy and confocal microscopy showed that the peptide had penetrated inside all tested cell types. No obvious differences in cellular distribution or intensity were observed between cell types. Next, EBTr cells were incubated with biotinylated Erns peptide and fixed after different time intervals. The peptide entered the cell within 1 min and optimal fluorescence was established after 30 min (Fig. 5). After longer incubation times (3 h) the image was less clear. It is not known whether this is due to cellular changes or proteolysis of the peptide. The translocated peptide was distributed around the nucleus in membranous parts in the cytosol and, in contrast to the native protein, clear accumulation in the nucleoli was observed. The peptide has a similar intracellular localization as a known transport peptide like the Antennapedia-(43–58) peptide. Translocation was also observed at 4 °C and could not be competed by a 10-times excess of unbiotinylated Ernspeptide (data not shown). Therefore, the mechanism is energy-independent and not receptor mediated. The part of the Erns C-terminal region responsible for translocation was mapped precisely by testing the translocation activity of a panel of truncations of the Erns peptide and some peptides with N-terminal additions and deletions and C-terminal deletions (TableI). Deletion of the seven-most C-terminal residues and the three N-terminal residues increased the translocation activity of the peptide (Table I). The most active biotinylated peptide (residues 194–220) still showed fluorescence above background at 250 nm with streptavidin-FITC. Because the Ernspeptide showed some resemblance with the ribotoxin L3 loop and some sequence homology with magainin, these peptides were also tested for translocation activity (Fig. 6). At 54–2 μm the biotinylated Erns peptide and the biotinylated L3 peptide show clear translocation activity, and the biotinylated magainin-1 peptide does not. The part of the restrictocin L3 loop responsible for translocation was mapped by testing the translocation activity of a panel of truncations of L3 loop peptides (Table II). A short 13-residue peptide N-terminal to the cysteine displayed the highest translocation activity. Next, it was tested whether the peptide could be used as a general transporter for cargoes other then Erns. This was tested by coupling labeled avidin and streptavidin to the biotinylated peptide. After mixing equimolar amounts of streptavidin-FITC (60 kDa, nonglycosylated, neutral) or avidin-Texas Red (66 kDa, glycosylated, pI = 10.5) with the most active Erns peptide (residues 194–220) (3 μm) it was possible to transport streptavidin-FITC and avidin-Texas Red inside the cell and the nucleus (Fig.7). Transport seems highly efficient because internalization of the peptide-streptavidin-FITC complex was still visible at a peptide concentration 20 times lower than the uncomplexed peptide (0.05 μm compared with 1 μm). Also in the case of streptavidin transport, the amount of accumulation was the same at 37 °C and 4 °C, which suggest that also the transport of larger cargoes is independent of endocytosis. The biotinylated restrictocin L3 peptide (residues 60–89) was not able to translocate 1 μm avidin-Texas Red or streptavidin-FITC (data not shown). Next, it was checked whether also large active enzymes could be translocated into the cell and tested for their enzymatic activity. This was tested by coupling streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and streptavidin-β-galactosidase to the biotinylated peptide. A preformed complex of Erns peptide with streptavidin-HRP (104 kDa) and a preformed complex of Erns peptide with β-galactosidase (524 kDa) was incubated with EBTr cells for 30 min. After washing, fixing with cold methanol, and incubation with the respective substrates (“Experimental Procedures”), the translocated active enzymes could be detected in the cytosol and the nucleoli (Fig.8). Effective, non-toxic transport peptides should preferably have high translocation activity and low hemolytic activity and/or toxic activity. To check whether the membrane destabilizing activity had a general toxic effect on cells, hemolytic activity, tryphan blue exclusion, and influence on cell growth was tested. EBTr cells were tested for tryphan blue leakage after peptide incubation for 30 min. Only at high concentrations of peptide (>35 μm) some tryphan blue could be determined inside the cell, especially in areas in the nucleus. Hemolysis of erythrocytes can also be indicative for lytic effect of the peptides on eukaryotic cell membranes. Hemolysis of erythrocytes from several species was tested with the panel of Erns peptides (Table I). The different peptides show a broad range of hemolytic activities on guinea pig erythrocytes. The peptide with the highest translocation activity (residues 194–220) has a low hemolytic activity. No significant hemolysis was observed with sheep and human erythrocytes. The effect of the Ernspeptide on cell growth of HeLa cells and EBTr cells was determined in a clonogenicity assay as shown in TableIII. These data correspond to the other toxicity assays and indicate that the translocation activity is much higher than the cytotoxic activity.Table IIITransporter peptides: Peptide concentration that inhibits cell growthCell typeErnspeptide (191–227)Erns peptide (194–220)μmμmHeLa5040EBTr5060 Open table in a new tab Because the translocation seemed energy-independent, it was tested whether the membrane potential could be the driving force for translocation. Because membrane activity measured with a hemolysis test correlated to some extent with translocation activity, the influence of membrane potential on hemolysis of human red blood cells was tested. Hemolysis is a straightforward test to study membrane activity, and the membrane potential of erythrocytes can be easily manipulated by changing the sodium concentration in the medium. Hemolysis at membrane potentials of −9 mV and −70 mV shows that hemolysis was much higher at higher membrane potential (Fig. 9). The pestiviral surface protein Erns is unique because it is the only known viral surface protein with RNase activity (13Schneider R. Unger G. Stark R. Schneider-Scherzer E. Thiel H.J. Science. 1993; 261: 1169-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar,14Hulst M.M. Himes G. Newbigin E. Moormann R.J. Virology. 1994; 200: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Although the biological function of the protein is not understood, it may be possible that, just as ribotoxins, the target for the protein is intracellular or intranuclear RNA. Therefore, we anticipated that the molecule had some kind of way to enter the cell. However, except for some specialized proteins like toxins, internalization of macromolecules can only be achieved through the classical endocytosis pathway. In this study, it was shown that the entire recombinant Erns dimer was indeed able to translocate into cells. Sequence analysis indicated that the first 190 residues of Erns show homology to RNases of the T2/S superfamily and that the C-terminal 37 residues probably fold as a separate domain.2 This C-terminal domain is non-glycosylated, highly positively charged, and amphipathic and shows a slight homology with the pore-forming, antibacterial peptide magainin, and with a large loop in type II ribotoxins, which was expected to bind cell surfaces (27Yang X. Moffat K. Structure. 1996; 4: 837-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Therefore, the C-terminal domain of Erns was most likely responsible for the translocation activity. It was demonstrated that indeed, a peptide of 37 residues corresponding to the C-terminal domain of Erns translocates very efficiently over the plasma membrane of all tested cell types of a wide variety of species. The peptide is targeted to the nucleoli and to cytoplasmic membranes and localizes in the same areas as other known transport peptides like the HIV-1 Tat and Antennapedia peptide (data not shown). The translocation is very fast (<1 min); it is energy-independent and receptor-independent. The independence of binding to a saturable receptor agrees with the lack of cell specificity and suggests that the peptide interacts directly with fosfolipids as has been described for another transport peptide (30Bellet-Amalric E. Blaudez D. Desbat B. Graner F. Gauthier F. Renault A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1467: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Because the hemolytic activity correlated to some extent with translocation activity, the influence was tested for membrane potential on hemolysis of human red blood cells. Fig. 9 shows that the membrane activity was dependent on the membrane potential. Since the translocation is energy-independent, the membrane potential may therefore be the driving force for translocation. Because the elucidation of the translocating Erns peptide was inspired by the homology with magainin and the ribotoxin L3 loop, it was also tested whether a peptide corresponding to the L3 loop had translocating activity. Although previously another, more hydrophobic region of α-sarcin was shown to interact with membranes (31Mancheno J.M. Gasset M. Albar J.P. Lacadena J. Martinez del Pozo A. Onaderra M. Gavilanes J.G. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 2387-2395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), in this study it was shown that a more N-terminally located peptide corresponding to the restrictocin L3 loop had translocation activity (Fig. 6). Perhaps both regions contribute to membrane translocation in the native protein. To elucidate the exact region of the peptides responsible for translocation, panels of Erns peptides and restrictocin peptides with different lengths were synthesized. The most active translocating Erns peptide was 10 residues shorter (residue 194–220) then the full-length C-terminal peptide of Erns-(191–227), and it was less toxic (Table I). The most active translocating restrictocin L3 peptide was 13 residues long, which corresponds to the N-terminal half of the L3 loop before the cystine bridge, which divides the loop into two parts in the native protein. Just like other known transporter peptides, the mapping showed that basic residues were important for translocation activity. The homology between the most active restrictocin L3 and the Erns peptide is only two small sequence motifs (GR and GK), which is much lower compared with the homology between Ernspeptide and magainin, which has no translocation activity (Fig. 6). Magainin forms a perfect amphipathic helix, thus amphipathicity is not important for transport peptides. In contrast to the Ernspeptide, the L3 loop peptide has no amphipathicity when represented as a helix. Furthermore, the L3 loop contains a helix-breaking proline. It has been suggested that there may be several different translocation mechanisms for the different peptides and that they not necessarily have to form a helix (32Derossi D. Calvet S. Trembleau A. Brunissen A. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18188-18193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). Recently, several transport peptides have been discovered that all have a very different origin, and no obvious sequence homology can be observed (16Schwarze S.R. Hruska K.A. Dowdy S.F. Trends Cell. Biol. 2000; 10: 290-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 18Lindgren M. Hallbrink M. Prochiantz A. Langel U. Trends Pharmacol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 16010-16017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2071) Google Scholar). The only resemblance is the high amount of positive charges. The mapping experiments also proved that the peptide did not only translocate itself and a biotin molecule, but also peptide cargoes could be transported. Next, it was shown that the peptide could be used as a general transporter for proteins different from Erns. Streptavidin and avidin, which have different physical characteristics, could be transported into cells when complexed to the Ernspeptide. The labeled proteins were targeted to the same intracellular regions as the peptide, concentrated in vesicle-like structures around the nucleus, and spread through the cytoplasm. In contrast to recombinant Erns, nucleoli targeting was observed, although it was less pronounced than the peptide (Fig. 7). Even the enzymes HRP and β-galactopyranoside conjugated to streptavidin could be efficiently transported into cells when complexed with the Erns peptide. Internalized enzymes retained their activity, and clear substrate conversion was observed in the nucleoli. Especially, the streptavidin-β-galactopyranoside conjugate that has a molecular mass as high as 524 kDa and a pI as low as 4.6 illustrates the remarkable efficacy of the transport peptide. In contrast, the restrictocin L3 peptide was not able to translocate the selected protein cargoes. Perhaps the difference in transport ability of the two peptides is based on the pI, which is lower for the L3 peptide (pI = 10.7) compared with the Erns peptide (pI = 12.7). Accordingly, the transport ability of the peptides may increase by increasing the pI of the peptides. Another difference between both peptides is that L3 is an internal peptide and the Erns peptide is originally a terminal peptide and for that reason may be more efficient in the described experiments in which it was terminally attached. The demonstration of a translocation domain within Ernsadds a novel facet to this so far poorly understood pestiviral glycoprotein and may encourage studies on how a secreted RNase is involved in the survival strategy of an RNA virus. The function of Erns and the function of its RNase activity remain elusive but the translocation suggests that it may control protein synthesis and transcription in infected cells as well as non-infected cells. The Erns peptide and the ribotoxin L3 peptide may be used as a delivery tool to transport a diverse set of potential therapeutics inside the cell.

https://openalex.org/W1545620758,"The effect of oxidative stress on human red blood cell AMP-deaminase activity was studied by incubating either fresh erythrocytes or hemolysates with H2O2 (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 mm) or NaNO2 (1, 5, 10, 20, and 50 mm), for 15 min at 37 °C. AMP-deaminase tremendously increased by increasing H2O2 or NaNO2 at up to 4 and 20 mm, respectively (maximal effect for both oxidants was 9.5 and 6.5 times higher enzymatic activity than control erythrocytes or hemolysates, respectively). The incubation of hemolysates with iodoacetate (5–100 mm), N-ethylmaleimide (0.1–10 mm), or p-hydroxymercuribenzoate (0.1–5 mm) mimicked the effect of oxidative stress on AMP-deaminase, indicating that sulfhydryl group modification is involved in the enzyme activation. In comparison with control hemolysates, changes of the kinetic properties of AMP-deaminase (decrease of AMP concentration necessary for half-maximal activation, increase ofV max, modification of the curve shape ofV o versus [S], Hill plots, and coefficients) were recorded with 4 mmH2O2- and 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide-treated hemolysates. Data obtained using 90% purified enzyme, incubated with Fenton reagents (Fe2++ H2O2) or –SH-modifying compounds, demonstrated that (i) reactive oxygen species are directly responsible for AMP-deaminase activation; (ii) this phenomenon occurs through sulfhydryl group modification; and (iii) the activation does not involve the loss of the tetrameric protein structure.

Res. 1998; 28: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Due to their very high ferrous iron concentration, human erythrocytes might be exposed to risks of increased oxidative stress, mainly through the formation of ferrylhemoglobin (6Giulivi C. Davies K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19453-19460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and, in part, through the Fenton reaction of hydrogen peroxide with Fe2+ of hemoglobin, which generates the powerful oxidant hydroxyl radical (7Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 246: 501-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1807) Google Scholar). Although provided with efficient enzymatic systems for H2O2 removal (catalase, glutathione peroxidase), several ROS-mediated erythrocyte damages have been reported to occur in different in vitro experimental conditions, including challenge with hydrogen peroxide (8Snyder L.M.

Ageing Dev. 1996; 86: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, data available in the literature give very little information on alteration of erythrocyte energy metabolism (in terms either of metabolites or of enzymatic activities) following oxidative stress, except for results reporting only modest effects of iron-ascorbate (as a ROS-generating system) on hexokinase (12Stocchi V. Biagiarelli B. Fiorani M. Palma F. Piccoli G. Cucchiarini L. Dacha M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), thus suggesting that enzymes involved in red blood cell energy production are scarcely affected by oxidative stress.Very recently, we have shown, on the contrary, that oxidative stress, induced by increasing the addition of H2O2 concentrations to intact red blood cells, provoked a progressive ATP depletion, which was unexpectedly paralleled by a marked IMP (but neither AMP nor ADP) increase. Such a phenomenon was very probably linked to AMP-deaminase 2The following enzymes were used or were mentioned in the text: AMP-deaminase (EC 3.5.4.4); aspartate carbamoyltransferase (EC 2.1.3.2); catalase (EC 1.11.1.6); creatine phosphokinase (EC 2.7.3.2); glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC1.1.1.49); glutathione peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.9); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.12); hexokinase (EC2.7.1.1); phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11); and pyruvate kinase (EC2.7.1.40). 2The following enzymes were used or were mentioned in the text: AMP-deaminase (EC 3.5.4.4); aspartate carbamoyltransferase (EC 2.1.3.2); catalase (EC 1.11.1.6); creatine phosphokinase (EC 2.7.3.2); glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC1.1.1.49); glutathione peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.9); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.12); hexokinase (EC2.7.1.1); phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11); and pyruvate kinase (EC2.7.1.40). activation (13Tavazzi B.

This enzyme plays a critical role in energy metabolism, catalyzing the deamination of AMP into IMP in the purine nucleotide cycle, and it is present in mammals in three different isoforms. AMP-deaminase 1 is the predominant form in skeletal muscle; AMP-deaminase 2 is present in smooth muscle, nonmuscle tissue, embryonic muscle, and undifferentiated myoblasts; and AMP-deaminase 3 is found in erythrocytes. The erythrocyte isoform is a homotetramer whose monomers are composed by 767 amino acids; each protein subunit contains nine cysteine residues. AMP-deaminase 3 is regulated by several positive (Ca2+) and negative (2,3-biphosphoglycerate, Pi) effectors, and it is physiologically maintained in a state with low catalytic activity, mainly because of erythrocyte low Ca2+ and high 2,3-biphosphoglycerate.On the basis of these observations, we were prompted to study in detail the effect of increasing oxidative stress on AMP-deaminase activity of intact erythrocytes, of hemolysates, and of the purified AMP-deaminase from human red blood cells. Results, corroborated by data of experiments effected on quinine-treated erythrocytes and hemolysates and obtained from patients suffering from glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH) deficiency, demonstrate that AMP-deaminase is activated by oxidative stress through the modification of its accessible –SH groups and biphosphoglycerate is responsible for a profound and probably irreversible derangement of erythrocyte energy metabolism.DISCUSSIONThe relative metabolic simplicity of red blood cells is one of their peculiarity, but, of course, it also represents one of the main limitations for their survival. In this light, any change of enzymatic activities, particularly of those involved in the maintenance of the correct energy state, might present such a drastic problem that it would even result in erythrocyte death. Among the various possible causes affecting erythrocyte energy metabolism, oxidative stress might certainly represent a negative factor whose relevance, unlike that of other tissues (5Tavazzi B.

Med. 1999; 26: 1405-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) has not been fully evaluated. Previous investigation, using iron ascorbate as a ROS-generating system, apparently showed a poor capacity of oxidative stress to alter enzymes and metabolites of human red blood cell energy metabolism (12Stocchi V. Biagiarelli B. Fiorani M. Palma F. Piccoli G. Cucchiarini L. Dacha M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). On the contrary, we very recently demonstrated that incubation of fresh human erythrocytes with increasing hydrogen peroxide concentrations (i.e. with a free radical-generating system producing ferrylhemoglobin and possibly OH⋅), provoked a progressive ATP depletion, which was paralleled by a dramatic IMP and a modest AMP or ADP increase. Furthermore, such a metabolic modification was attributed to AMP-deaminase activation (13Tavazzi B. Di Pierro D. Amorini A.M. Fazzina G. Tuttobene M. Giardina B. Lazzarino G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 684-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This enzyme plays a critical role in energy metabolism, catalyzing the deamination of AMP into IMP in the purine nucleotide cycle, particularly in erythrocytes because they lack the salvage pathway of purine nucleotides. Therefore, IMP production represents for red blood cells a remarkable waste of energy.The experiments reported in the present study, in which we evaluated in detail (on intact erythrocytes, on hemolysates, and on the 90% purified AMP-deaminase) the activity of the type 3 erythrocytic isoenzyme under different experimental conditions, showed that the extent of AMP-deaminase activation depended on the severity of oxidative stress up to a certain limit, beyond which an inhibitory effect was observed. We found that in intact erythrocytes and hemolysates (Fig. 1), as well as in the 90% purified enzyme (Fig. 5,A and B), even a modest ROS production, unable to produce GSH depletion higher than 50% (Table II), caused a significant increase of AMP-deaminase activity, thus indicating a high reactivity of specific amino acid residues of the protein toward oxidative stress. Furthermore, the –SH-modifying reagents iodoacetate, NEM, and PMB (Figs. 2 and 5, C and D) mimicked the same enzymatic activation obtainable with the ROS-generating systems tested, supporting the hypothesis that oxidative stress-mediated AMP-deaminase activation occurs via irreversible modification of cysteine(s) crucial for controlling enzymatic activity. In experiments with hemolysates, this indication was reinforced by the lack of synergism between ROS and reagents for –SH (Table I) and, furthermore, by changes of the kinetic properties of AMP-deaminase of hemolysates treated with either 4 mm H2O2 or 1 mm NEM (Fig. 3). With respect to controls, the enzyme of stimulated hemolysates doubled its affinity for AMP and increased about 3.5-fold the reaction velocity. As evidenced by the Hill plots showing the absence of the lower asymptote in the curves of both H2O2- and NEM-treated hemolysates (Fig. 4), oxidative stress or challenge with –SH-blocking reagents were accompanied by the AMP-deaminase T → R transition, therefore producing a conformational state of the enzyme with high affinity for the substrate (AMP). In addition, treated hemolysates underwent modest change of AMP-deaminase n values (1.76 and 1.80 for 4 mm H2O2- or 1 mmNEM-treated hemolysates, respectively) in comparison with that of control hemolysates (n = 2.24). This strongly suggests that AMP-deaminase of the oxidatively stressed and –SH-treated hemolysates is cooperative in the AMP binding and, consequently, that the enzyme has the tetrameric or dimeric structure. The result of the native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 6) provided clear evidence that treatment of the 90% purified AMP-deaminase with 5 μm Fe2+ plus 100 μmH2O2 or 0.5 μm NEM (both treatments producing a remarkable increase of the enzymatic activity) did not induce enzyme dissociation. Therefore, this demonstrates that activated AMP-deaminase of oxidatively stressed and –SH-treated erythrocytes, hemolysates, and 90% purified enzyme is in its native tetrameric structure.On the basis of the results obtained by titrating free –SH groups of the 90% purified AMP-deaminase (Table V), it can be affirmed that the mechanism of oxidative stress-induced enzymatic activation involves, among the 10 freely accessible –SH groups, the modification of 2–4 cysteine residues/AMP-deaminase tetramer. The minimal and maximal numbers of modified –SH groups determine the corresponding minimal and maximal extent of AMP-deaminase activation. Such an –SH group modification, mimicked by the –SH-blocking compound NEM, should induce conformational changes of the tetrameric protein structure leading to AMP-deaminase stabilization in the R state with high affinity for AMP and consequent enzyme activation. We can also presume that the bell-shaped dose-response curve of the enzyme activity, as a function of increasing oxidants or –SH-modifying reagents, might occur either because of the reaction with a specific cysteine residue not easily accessible by reagents and directly involved in the AMP-deaminase catalytic mechanism or because of the possible nonspecific modification of amino acids other than cysteines (lysines, tyrosines, or methionines). In both cases, this occurrence was encountered at definitely high concentrations of both stimuli. It is worth emphasizing that the H2O2 and NaNO2 AMP-deaminase activation was not reverted by reducing reagents, such as GSH or β-mercaptoethanol (data not shown), thereby indicating an irreversible oxidative cysteine modification, as it occurs in the reaction of ROS with –SH groups (20Buettner G.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar).The evident demonstration of ROS-activated AMP-deaminase, obtained by the experiments conducted with the 90% purified enzyme challenged with a ROS-generating system based on the Fenton reaction, allowed us to hypothesize that hydroxyl radicals are directly responsible for AMP-deaminase activation. Under these experimental conditions, the purified enzyme represented one of the main macromolecular targets present in the incubation mixture, and no possible interference by eventual low molecular weight modulators might have occurred. Since OH⋅ are produced in part during the reaction of hydrogen peroxide with the ferrous iron of hemoglobin (7Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 246: 501-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1807) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that hydroxyl radicals are involved in the AMP-deaminase modification of intact erythrocytes and hemolysates.The importance of the results reported in the present study lies in the key role played by AMP-deaminase in determining the correct energy state of human erythrocytes. Previous studies showed that red blood cells underwent to ATP depletion, through AMP-deaminase activation, after exposure to various Ca2+ concentrations (21Almaraz L. Garcia-Sancho J. Lew V.L. J. Physiol. 1988; 407: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 22Almaraz L. Garcia-Sancho J. FEBS Lett. 1989; 244: 417-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 23Engstrom I. Waldenstrom A. Ronquist G. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1996; 56: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained upon exposure of erythrocytes to alkalinization and deoxyadenosine addition (24van der Berghe G. Bontemps F. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1990; 49: S117-S122PubMed Google Scholar) as well as after incubation with different nucleoside analogues (25Bontemps F. van der Berghe G. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4983-4989PubMed Google Scholar). It was supposed that change of AMP-deaminase activity is involved in the erythrocyte aging process (26Paglia D.E. Valentine W.N. Nakatani M. Brockway R.A. Blood. 1986; 67: 988-992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although this original hypothesis was subsequently contradicted by other studies (27Paglia D.E. Valentine W.N. Nakatani M. Brockway R.A. Blood. 1989; 74: 2161-2165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Dale G.L. Norenberg S.L. Blood. 1989; 74: 2157-2160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results of the present study certainly demonstrate that ROS can now be added to the list of the most potent activators of erythrocyte AMP-deaminase. From the data reported in the literature, this phenomenon should be peculiar to the red blood cell isoform. In fact, there is a significant AMP-deaminase inhibition of yeast cells subjected to oxidative stress (29Murakami K. Onoda Y. Kimura J. Yoshino M. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1997; 42: 1063-1069PubMed Google Scholar), and, furthermore, it has been demonstrated that a similar inhibitory pattern exists in the rabbit cardiac isoenzyme (30Janero D.R. Yarwood C. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In this last study, AMP-deaminase inactivation was correlated to an altered thiol status of the enzyme, quickly occurring (5–10 min) upon submission to oxidative stress, that should be responsible for irreversible modifications of AMP-deaminase conformation altering its catalytic activity (30Janero D.R. Yarwood C. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Our data showed that the reaction of ROS with the erythrocyte isoenzyme was similarly fast, but the final result of oxidative stress was the striking enzyme activation rather than the enzyme inhibition. Such a totally opposite effect might be attributable to the amino acid sequence differences of the various isoforms that should give rise to different conformational structures and thus to different sensitivities toward ROS effects; in addition, it is evident from our experiments performed with iodoacetate, NEM, and PMB, in which modification of –SH groups mimicked the activity of 4 mmH2O2, that the change of erythrocyte AMP-deaminase thiol state does stimulate (instead of inhibiting) the enzymatic activity. At present, the only AMP-deaminase capable of being markedly activated by ROS, therefore, seems to be the erythrocyte isoform.Our results obtained by challenging erythrocytes and hemolysates from G-6-PDH-deficient patients with the anti-malarial drug quinine hydrochloride (Fig. 7) showed the same patterns of AMP-deaminase activation as those occurring to erythrocytes and hemolysates obtained from blood of healthy subjects and then subjected to oxidative stress. From the physiopathological point of view, this finding implies that, through ROS-induced activation of AMP-deaminase, oxidative stress might represent one of the main negative events leading to profound impairment of the erythrocyte energy state in physiological (aging) and, moreover, pathological conditions. In fact, all of the situations in which erythrocytes may be subjected to oxidative stress by different causes, such as those induced by redox cycling xenobiotics (anthracycline drugs, paraquat, etc.), by hemolytic crisis (G-6-PDH deficiency), by hemoglobinopathies (hemoglobin S), by increase of Met-hemoglobin and free radicals (smokers), and by hemodialysis (nephropathies), should be reconsidered in light of the negative contributions for energy metabolism that occur when AMP-deaminase is activated (13Tavazzi B. Di Pierro D. Amorini A.M. Fazzina G. Tuttobene M. Giardina B. Lazzarino G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 684-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar).In conclusion, although further studies will be necessary for elucidating the mechanism of ROS-mediated activation of human erythrocyte AMP-deaminase, as well as the specific amino acid residues implicated and the structural changes driving this activation, we demonstrated, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, that direct interaction of ROS with an enzyme of energy metabolism is able to activate rather than inhibit the catalytic activity of the enzyme itself. At present, only examples of enzymatic inactivation by oxidative stress can be found in the literature, such as those occurring to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (31Ciolino H.P. Levine R.L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 1277-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 32Miura T. Muraoka S. Ogiso T. Chem. Biol.

Haematol. 1989; 43: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), etc., although the increase of the biological activity of a protein molecule, such as the conversion of the inactive form of glycosylation-inhibiting factor into its bioactive derivatives, has been reported to occur upon –SH modification (35Nakano T. Watarai H. Liu Y.C. Oyama Y. Mikayama T. Ishizaka K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Since AMP-deaminase regulation is crucial for the maintenance of the correct red blood cell energy state, we believe that our results represent a new and important improvement either of the knowledge of ROS-damaging activity toward biologically fundamental molecules or of the understanding of erythrocyte energy metabolism functioning in physiopathological conditions of increased oxidative stress. Reactive oxygen species (ROS)1 are dangerous molecules generated physiologically and pathologically from various intracellular and extracellular sources (1Braughler J.M. Hall E.D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1989; 6: 289-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Several ROS-induced irreversible modifications of biologically fundamental macromolecules have been described, including oxidation of protein –SH groups (2De Flora S. Izzotti A. Randerath K.

Res. 1998; 28: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Due to their very high ferrous iron concentration, human erythrocytes might be exposed to risks of increased oxidative stress, mainly through the formation of ferrylhemoglobin (6Giulivi C. Davies K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19453-19460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and, in part, through the Fenton reaction of hydrogen peroxide with Fe2+ of hemoglobin, which generates the powerful oxidant hydroxyl radical (7Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 246: 501-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1807) Google Scholar). Although provided with efficient enzymatic systems for H2O2 removal (catalase, glutathione peroxidase), several ROS-mediated erythrocyte damages have been reported to occur in different in vitro experimental conditions, including challenge with hydrogen peroxide (8Snyder L.M.

Chem. 1987; 262: 8220-8226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), incubation with redox-cycling drugs (10Thabrew M.I. Samarawickrema N. Chandrasena L.G. Jayasekera S. Ann. Clin. Biochem. 1999; 36: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and during the aging process (11Miyazawa T. Suzuki T. Fujimoto K. Kinoshita M. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1996; 86: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, data available in the literature give very little information on alteration of erythrocyte energy metabolism (in terms either of metabolites or of enzymatic activities) following oxidative stress, except for results reporting only modest effects of iron-ascorbate (as a ROS-generating system) on hexokinase (12Stocchi V. Biagiarelli B. Fiorani M. Palma F. Piccoli G. Cucchiarini L. Dacha M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), thus suggesting that enzymes involved in red blood cell energy production are scarcely affected by oxidative stress. Very recently, we have shown, on the contrary, that oxidative stress, induced by increasing the addition of H2O2 concentrations to intact red blood cells, provoked a progressive ATP depletion, which was unexpectedly paralleled by a marked IMP (but neither AMP nor ADP) increase. Such a phenomenon was very probably linked to AMP-deaminase 2The following enzymes were used or were mentioned in the text: AMP-deaminase (EC 3.5.4.4); aspartate carbamoyltransferase (EC 2.1.3.2); catalase (EC 1.11.1.6); creatine phosphokinase (EC 2.7.3.2); glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC1.1.1.49); glutathione peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.9); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.12); hexokinase (EC2.7.1.1); phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11); and pyruvate kinase (EC2.7.1.40). 2The following enzymes were used or were mentioned in the text: AMP-deaminase (EC 3.5.4.4); aspartate carbamoyltransferase (EC 2.1.3.2); catalase (EC 1.11.1.6); creatine phosphokinase (EC 2.7.3.2); glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC1.1.1.49); glutathione peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.9); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.12); hexokinase (EC2.7.1.1); phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11); and pyruvate kinase (EC2.7.1.40). activation (13Tavazzi B.

We investigated whether the interruption of the AR coregulator function could lead to down-regulation of AR activity. Using in vitro mutagenesis and a yeast two-hybrid screening assay, we have isolated a mutant ARA54 (mt-ARA54) carrying a point mutation at amino acid 472 changing a glutamic acid to lysine, which acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor of AR transactivation. In transient transfection assays of prostate cancer cell lines, the mt-ARA54 suppressed endogenous mutated AR-mediated and exogenous wild-type AR-mediated transactivation in LNCaP and PC-3 cells, respectively. In DU145 cells, the mt-ARA54 suppressed exogenous ARA54 but not other coregulators, such as ARA55-enhanced or SRC-1-enhanced AR transactivation. In the LNCaP cells stably transfected with the plasmids encoding the mt-ARA54 under the doxycycline inducible system, the overexpression of the mt-ARA54 inhibited cell growth and endogenous expression of prostate-specific antigen. Mammalian two-hybrid assays further demonstrated that the mt-ARA54 can disrupt the interaction between wild-type ARA54 molecules, suggesting that ARA54 dimerization or oligomerization may play an essential role in the enhancement of AR transactivation.

In 2001, it is estimated that there will be 198,100 new cases of prostate cancer and 31,500 deaths from this disease in the United States. (30Greenlee R.T. Hill-Harmon M.B. Murray T. Thun M. CA-Cancer J. Clin. 2001; 51: 15-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (3332) Google Scholar). The most significant palliative treatment of prostate cancer is hormonal therapy involving androgen ablation by surgical or medical castration and/or the administration of antiandrogens. Nonetheless, no curative treatment exists for patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Indeed, most of the patients with advanced prostate cancer eventually develop androgen-independent disease. Additionally, some patients with androgen-dependent disease develop a withdrawal syndrome that is associated with an agonist effect of antiandrogens, resulting in antiandrogen treatment promoting prostate cancer progression (31Kelly W.K. Slovin S. Scher H.I. Urol. Clin. North Am. 1997; 24: 421-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have suggested that AR coactivators promote the agonist activity of antiandrogens through the interaction with AR (5Miyamoto H. Yeh S. Wilding G. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7379-7384Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 29Yeh S. Kang H.-Y. Miyamoto H. Nishimura K. Chang H.-C. Ting H.-J. Rahman M. Lin H.-K. Fujimoto N., Hu, Y.-C. Mizokami A.

The interruption of this AR-coregulator interaction may therefore provide a target for the development of novel treatment strategies for advanced prostate cancer. In our previous study (26Kang H.-Y. Yeh S. Fujimoto N. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8570-8576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), the C-terminal region (amino acids 361–474) of ARA54 (C′-ARA54), which was originally isolated from a human prostate cDNA library, interacted with AR. We found that full-length ARA54 (fl-ARA54) but not C′-ARA54 enhanced AR transactivation (26Kang H.-Y. Yeh S. Fujimoto N. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8570-8576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 29Yeh S. Kang H.-Y. Miyamoto H. Nishimura K. Chang H.-C. Ting H.-J. Rahman M. Lin H.-K. Fujimoto N., Hu, Y.-C. Mizokami A. Huang K.-E. Chang C. Endocrine. 1999; 11: 195-202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This study was undertaken to search for a potential strategy that can suppress AR transactivation induced by fl-ARA54 in prostate cancer cells. We hypothesized that mutant ARA54, which has lost the ability to bind to AR, might be able to act as a dominant-negative inhibitor of AR transcription. Using a chemical mutagenesis method to create a mutated C′-ARA54 library for two-hybrid screening in yeast, we isolated a mutant ARA54 (mt-ARA54), a C-terminal fragment of ARA54 with a point mutation that functions in a dominant-negative manner. This dominant-negative clone disrupts the ability of wild-type ARA54 to interact with itself, suggesting that ARA54 dimerization or oligomerization may play an important role in the enhancement of AR transactivation. The hydroxylamine-mediated mutagenesis screening technique used in this study can be used to isolate additional dominant-negative coregulators that are able to inhibit a broad spectrum of receptor-coregulator interactions. Such dominant-negative coregulators may ultimately be used in gene therapy as part of a therapeutic option in the treatment of prostate cancer. 5α-Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), progesterone, and dexamethasone were obtained from Sigma, and HF was from Schering. pAS2-AR containing the C terminus of the ligand binding domain from wild-type AR fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain (DBD) was constructed as described previously (25Fujimoto N.

An ARA54-mutated library was generated by incubating 100 μg of pACT2-C′-ARA54 with 1 mhydroxylamine (Sigma) at 70° C for 1 h followed by DNA extraction. Plasmids with pAS2-AR and the mutated ARA54 library were sequentially transformed into the yeast strain Y190 harboring reporter genes (i.e. lacZ andHis-3) according to the CLONTECHYeast Protocols Handbook. The transformed yeast cells were plated with 100 nm DHT on synthetic dropout plates lacking tryptophan and leucine. Colonies were filter-assayed for β-galactosidase activity, and white colonies that indicated no interaction between the AR bait and mutant ARA54 were selected. The mutant ARA54 plasmid DNAs were isolated from the yeast cells that have spontaneously lost the cycloheximide-bearing plasmid (pAS2-AR) by plating the selected white colonies on synthetic dropout (-leucine) in the presence of 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma). The mutant ARA54 clones were then subcloned into the pSG5 mammalian expression vector (Stratagene). The human prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP, PC-3, and DU145, were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum. Transfections using the calcium phosphate precipitation method and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) and luciferase (Luc) assays were performed as described previously (5Miyamoto H. Yeh S. Wilding G. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7379-7384Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 29Yeh S. Kang H.-Y. Miyamoto H. Nishimura K. Chang H.-C. Ting H.-J. Rahman M.

The medium was changed to phenol-red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum 1 h before transfection. In each experiment, the total amount of transfected DNA/dish was maintained as a constant by the addition of empty expression vector (pSG5 or pVP16, as appropriate). The medium was changed again 24 h after transfection, and the cells were treated with 1 nmDHT or 1 μm HF for 24 h. The cells were then harvested, and whole cell extracts were used for CAT or Luc assay. The CAT activity was quantitated with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The Luc assay was determined using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) and luminometer. The pBIG2i vector contains all of the elements required for tetracycline-responsive gene expression and a selective marker conferring resistance to hygromycin B for the generation of stable cell lines (35Strathdee C.A. McLeod M.R. Hall J.R. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 229: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We first constructed pBIG2i-C′-ARA54, pBIG2i-mt-ARA54, and pBIG2i-fl-ARA54 and then transfected each plasmid into LNCaP or PC-3 cells using SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen). After transfection, cells were cultured in the presence of 100 μg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen) to select for stably transfected cells that had incorporated the pBIG2i-based construct. After growth for an additional two weeks, individual clones were picked. We then confirmed the stable expression of the mutant (C-terminal fragment) or wild-type (full-length) ARA54 induced by doxycycline using Northern blot analysis. Northern blotting was performed using total RNAs from the stable LNCaP or PC-3 cells and C-terminal fragment of ARA54 as a DNA probe as described previously (25Fujimoto N. Yeh S. Kang H.-Y. Inui S.

Western blotting analysis was performed in the stable LNCaP cells using NH27 polyclonal antibody for the AR and monoclonal prostate-specific antigen (PSA) antibody (DAKO) as described previously (5Miyamoto H. Yeh S. Wilding G. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7379-7384Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). An antibody for β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as the internal control. DU145 cells were transiently cotransfected with a GAL4-hybrid expression plasmid, a VP16-hybrid expression plasmid, the reporter plasmid pG5-CAT, and the pCMV-β-galactosidase internal control plasmid. Transfections and CAT assays were performed as described above. To screen for dominant-negative forms of ARA54, we used an in vitromutagenesis strategy combined with the yeast two-hybrid system. ARA54 was initially isolated from a human prostate cDNA library as a C-terminal fragment that interacted with AR (26Kang H.-Y. Yeh S. Fujimoto N. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8570-8576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). This C-terminal region of ARA54 (amino acids 361–474) was cloned into pACT2 and mutagenized with 1 m hydroxylamine to create the mutant ARA54 library for yeast two-hybrid screening. This library was screened against pAS2-AR for the selection of clones that did not interact with AR. We selected 11 colonies that showed no interaction between pAS2-AR and the pACT2-ARA54 mutant from ∼50,000 yeast colonies. We confirmed the interactions with AR by subcloning each clone into pACT2 and yeast two-hybrid assay with sequential transformation with pAS2-AR and pACT2 mutant clone. These 11 pACT2 constructs were then subcloned into pSG5 to assess their effect on AR-mediated transactivation in the prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP (AR-positive and ARA54-positive), PC-3 (AR-negative and ARA54-positive), and DU145 (AR-negative and ARA54-negative) (26Kang H.-Y. Yeh S. Fujimoto N. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8570-8576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) using a reporter gene assay. We have previously shown that the transcriptional activity of a mutant AR or wild-type AR could be induced in LNCaP or PC-3 cells in response to both androgen, DHT, and the antiandrogen, HF, and that fl-ARA54 can enhance the AR transactivation in DU145 cells (26Kang H.-Y.

Fig.1 shows that C′-ARA54 suppresses DHT-mediated or HF-mediated AR transcriptional activity. One mutant ARA54 clone was found to have a stronger dominant-negative effect both for endogenous fl-ARA54 in LNCaP and PC-3 cells and for exogenous fl-ARA54 in DU145 cells. However, both mutants, C′-ARA54 and mt-ARA54, showed an only marginal effect on AR transactivation in the absence of fl-ARA54 in DU145 cells (Fig. 1, E andF). The suppression of AR transactivation by either C′-ARA54 or mt-ARA54 was not the result of down-regulation of AR protein expression. LNCaP cells transfected with C′-ARA54 or mt-ARA54 showed little change in endogenous AR expression compared with non-transfected cells (data not shown). These results suggest that a mutant ARA54 dominant-negatively suppresses endogenous AR-mediated and exogenous AR-mediated transactivation. Sequencing analysis revealed that mt-ARA54 contained a single point mutation (a guanine to adenine transition) at the first position of codon 472, resulting in a glutamic acid to lysine substitution. Our previous studies demonstrated ARA54 had a marginal transcriptional effect on the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) but could enhance the transcriptional activity of the progesterone receptor (PR) by up to 4-fold (26Kang H.-Y. Yeh S. Fujimoto N. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8570-8576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of mt-ARA54 on PR and GR transactivation in the presence of endogenous or exogenous fl-ARA54. Both C′-ARA54 and mt-ARA54 had only a marginal effect on PR-mediated transactivation in the presence of progesterone in the PC-3 cell line. Similarly, GR transactivation was only marginally repressed by either C′-ARA54 or mt-ARA54 (Fig.2 A). When fl-ARA54 was cotransfected with PR or GR into DU145 cells, fl-ARA54 induced PR transcription by 2.9-fold and GR transcriptional activity by 1.6-fold (Fig. 2 B). In DU145 cells, mt-ARA54 suppressed fl-ARA54-induced PR transactivation by 43% but only marginally suppressed GR transactivation. C′-ARA54 showed little effect on PR or GR transcription. To determine whether C′-ARA54 and mt-ARA54 inhibited only wild-type ARA54-mediated transactivation, we examined their effect in DU145 cells in the presence of other AR coregulators. C′-ARA54 or mt-ARA54 was cotransfected with AR and ARA55, ARA70, retinoblastoma (Rb), or SRC-1 into DU145 cells. As shown in Fig.3 A and consistent with our previous reports (23Yeh S Chang C. Proc.

Fujimoto N., Hu, Y.-C. Mizokami A. Huang K.-E. Chang C. Endocrine. 1999; 11: 195-202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these coactivators alone enhanced AR transcriptional activity by an additional 2.9–6.0-fold in the presence of DHT. C′-ARA54 and mt-ARA54 showed only marginal or slight suppressive effects on ARA55-, ARA70-, Rb-, or SRC-1-enhanced AR transactivation. Similar results were also obtained when mt-AR877, codon 877 mutation threonine to serine derived from a prostate cancer (33Taplin M.-E. Bubley G.J. Shuster T.D. Frantz M.E. Spooner A.E. Ogata G.K. Keer H.N. Balk S.P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 1393-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar), was substituted for wild-type AR (Fig. 3 B). These results suggest that the suppressive effect of mt-ARA54 or C′-ARA54 is relatively specific for fl-ARA54-enhanced AR transactivation. To develop a system that allows us to investigate the effect of the dominant-negative ARA54 mutant on cell proliferation, we have established prostate cancer cell lines stably transfected with the plasmids encoding the mutant ARA54 (C′-ARA54 or mt-ARA54) or fl-ARA54 under the doxycycline (doxy)-inducible promoter. We first confirmed the stable expression of the ARA54 induced by doxy using Northern blotting (data not shown). The LNCaP or PC-3 cell-expressed endogenous ARA54 (wild-type) bands appeared at 3 kb, and strong shorter bands (2 kb) suggestive of C-terminal fragment transcript (C′-ARA54 or mt-ARA54) were detected only in the presence of doxy. Similarly, a stronger 3-kb band was detected in the LNCaP cells stably transfected with fl-ARA54 when treated with doxy compared with no doxy treatment or transfection with vector (pBIG2i) alone. Next, we tested the effect of the dominant-negative mutants of ARA54 on cell proliferation of the stable LNCaP cells, which had endogenous AR and wild-type ARA54. As shown in Fig.4 A, the expression of the mt-ARA54 (+ doxy) resulted in a significant decrease in cell growth. As a control, we also tested the effects of fl-ARA54 in LNCaP and mt-ARA54 in AR-negative PC-3 cells. The results show that fl-ARA54 or mt-ARA54 without AR does not suppress prostate cancer cell growth. The Luc assay also demonstrated that using transient transfection of a reporter gene into these stable cell lines, the expression of the mt-ARA54 (+ doxy) significantly decreased AR transcriptional activity in the presence of DHT (Fig. 4 B). These results confirm and strengthen our transient transfection data as described earlier.Figure 4The effects of the mutant ARA54 in the LNCaP cells stably transfected with pBIG2i-C′-ARA54 or pBIG2i-mt-ARA54 under tetracycline-inducible system. A, the effects of C′-ARA54 and mt-ARA54 on cell proliferation. LNCaP cells stably transfected with pBIG2i (vector alone), pBIG2i-C′-ARA54, pBIG2i-mt-ARA54, or pBIG2i-fl-ARA54, and PC-3 cells stably transfected with pBIG2i (vector alone) or pBIG2i-fl-ARA54 were cultured in the presence or absence of 2 μg/ml doxy with 1 nm DHT. Total cell number was counted by hemocytometer. Values represent the mean ± S.D. of at least three determinations. B, the effects of C′-ARA54 and mt-ARA54 on AR transcriptional activity. LNCaP cells stably transfected with pBIG2i (vector alone), pBIG2i-C′-ARA54, pBIG2i-mt-ARA54, or pBIG2i-fl-ARA54 were transiently transfected with MMTV-Luc. After transfection, cells were cultured in the presence or absence of 2 μg/ml doxy and 1 nm DHT as indicated. The Luc activity is presented relative to that in the absence of doxy and in the presence of DHT in each panel (black bars,set as 100%). Values represent the mean ± S.D. of at least three determinations. C, the effects of C′-ARA54 and mt-ARA54 on PSA expression. Cell extracts from LNCaP cells stably transfected with pBIG2i (vector alone), pBIG2i-C′-ARA54, or pBIG2i-dn-mt-ARA54 cultured for 48 h with 1 nm DHT in the presence or absence of 2 μg/ml doxy as indicated were analyzed on Western blots using an antibody to the PSA. The 33-kDa protein was detected as indicated and quantitated by Collage image analysis software (Fotodyne). The normalized expression level in the first lane (vector alone without doxy treatment) was set as 100%. Values represent the mean ± S.D. of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The PSA is an AR target gene and presently the most useful marker to monitor the progression of prostate cancer. Therefore, it is of interest to determine whether the overexpression of the mutant ARAs as dominant-negative inhibitors of AR transcription suppresses PSA expression in prostate cancer cells. The Western blotting assay showed that endogenous PSA expression in the LNCaP cells was decreased to 60 and 87% when the mt-ARA54 and C′-ARA54 were expressed in the cells (+ doxy), respectively (Fig. 4 C). There were no differences in AR protein levels in the LNCaP cells cultured with or without doxy (data not shown). These results suggest that a dominant-negative mutant ARA54 can inhibit AR-mediated prostate cancer progression. To investigate the potential mechanism through which mt-ARA54 suppresses ARA54-enhanced AR transactivation, we used a mammalian two-hybrid assay. DU145 cells were cotransfected with a GAL4 DBD and a VP16 activation domain fusion protein. Protein-protein interaction was assessed by measuring the activity of the pG5-CAT reporter gene. First, we tested the influence of mt-ARA54 on the interaction between AR and fl-ARA54. As shown in Fig.5 A, AR interacted with fl-ARA54 in an androgen-dependent manner (lanes 1–4) as reported previously (26Kang H.-Y. Yeh S. Fujimoto N. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8570-8576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The addition of C′-ARA54 or mt-ARA54 resulted in very little change in AR-ARA54 interaction (lanes 5 and 6). Also, AR still interacted with C′-ARA54 but not with mt-ARA54 (lanes 7 and 8), consistent with our yeast two-hybrid screening results. We next tested whether ARA54 forms oligomers possibly in the dimeric form and the possible influence of mt-ARA54. As shown in Fig. 5 B, GAL4-fl-ARA54 interacted with VP16-fl-ARA54 in the presence or absence of androgen (lanes 1–4), suggesting fl-ARA54 can form homodimers in an androgen-independent manner. When cotransfected with C′-ARA54 or mt-ARA54, CAT activities returned to the basal levels (lanes 5 and 6). Interestingly, fl-ARA54 can still interact with C′-ARA54 or mt-ARA54 (lanes 7 and8). These results suggest that C′-ARA54 and mt-ARA54 may function in a dominant-negative manner through blocking the homodimerization of fl-ARA54. In this study, we have identified a dominant-negative mutant of an AR coactivator, ARA54, using in vitro mutagenesis and a yeast two-hybrid screening assay. We generated a mutated C-terminal ARA54 library using hydroxylamine-mediated mutagenesis to induce random transition mutations (38Narusaka Y. Narusaka M. Satoh K. Kobayashi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23270-23275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The mutant ARA54, mt-ARA54, carrying a glutamic acid to lysine substitution at codon 472 has lost its binding ability to AR and significantly suppressed the ability of endogenous or exogenous fl-ARA54 to enhance AR transcription in prostate cancer cells. The inhibitory effect was more obvious for exogenously expressed fl-ARA54 in DU145 cells than for endogenously expressed ARA54 in PC-3 and LNCaP cells. This result may be attributed to the presence of other AR coactivators, such as ARA70 and ARA55, which are slightly influenced by the mt-ARA54 in PC-3 and LNCaP cells. Importantly, although C′-ARA54 has been shown to have a weak dominant-negative effect, the mutant derived from this C-terminal fragment had a stronger suppressive effect on AR transactivation as well as on AR-mediated prostate cancer proliferation. ARA54 has the ability to form homodimers as determined by using a mammalian two-hybrid assay. Because C′-ARA54 or mt-ARA54 did not influence fl-ARA54-AR interaction but did influence the interaction between fl-ARA54 and fl-ARA54, the molecular mechanism of these dominant-negative mutants appears to involve the formation of inactive dimers with fl-ARA54. In Fig. 6, we present a working model for the repression of AR transcriptional activity by C′-ARA54 or mt-ARA54. AR transactivation is induced by androgen and further enhanced through the interaction of AR with ARA54. For it to enhance AR transactivation, ARA54 may need to form homodimers. When fl-ARA54 dimerizes with C-ARA54 or with mt-ARA54, the capacity of ARA54 to enhance transcription is reduced, resulting in a decrease in the observed AR-mediated transactivation. It has been proposed that nuclear receptors may interact with a complex of coregulators involving coregulator-coregulator interactions in addition to coregulator-receptor interactions (39Kamei Y., Xu, L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.-C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

Nature. 1996; 383: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Dimerization between fl-ARA54 and mt-ARA54 may not be productive because of a reduced ability to interact with CBP or the basal transcriptional machinery. Both normal prostate development and prostate cancer growth are largely dependent on the presence of androgens. Consequently, androgen ablation and/or blockage of androgen action through AR produces a brief response in most prostate cancer patients. However, in some cases prostate tumors are induced to proliferate by antiandrogens exerting an agonistic effect (5Miyamoto H. Yeh S. Wilding G. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7379-7384Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 31Kelly W.K. Slovin S. Scher H.I. Urol. Clin. North Am. 1997; 24: 421-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and androgen dependence is eventually lost during treatment (41Goktas S. Crawford D. Semin. Oncol. 1999; 26: 162-173PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that because of changing the activity, i.e. altering ligand specificity by AR variations and abnormalities, the activation of AR pathway probably remains important in most prostate cancer cells from patients with clinically defined androgen-independent disease (42Jenster G. Semin. Oncol. 1999; 26: 407-421PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to current endocrine therapy, new approaches leading to the inhibition of AR-mediated prostate cancer growth are needed. Currently, severalin vivo gene therapies involving the insertion of suicide genes, the replacement of mutated tumor suppressor genes, and antisense strategies are being evaluated in prostate cancer model systems as potential treatments (43Hrouda D. Perry M. Dalgleish A.G. Semin. Oncol. 1999; 26: 455-471PubMed Google Scholar). We here propose that the suppression of AR coactivator function may result in AR inactivation. Indeed, a recent report showed the physiological necessity of an AR coactivator. A loss of the function resulted in a complete androgen-insensitivity syndrome patient in whom the AR gene was completely normal (44Adachi M. Takayanagi R. Tomura A. Imasaki K. Kato S. Goto K. Yanase T. Ikuyama S. Nawata H. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 343: 856-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Because mt-ARA54 suppresses androgen-mediated and antiandrogen-mediated AR transactivation and PSA expression in prostate cancer cells, these results may lead to the development of new types of gene therapy strategies using mutant ARA54 or other suppressive mutant coactivators. For this strategy to be feasible, we first should clarify the expression levels of ARA54, the ratios of AR and ARA54 expression, and the mutations of ARA54 in prostate cancer tissues. Because the effect of mt-ARA54 was specific for ARA54-induced AR activity and that ARA54 is not the only coactivator to enhance AR activity, it may be necessary to identify dominant-negative mutants of other AR coactivators to obtain maximal AR suppression. Furthermore, antitumor activities of the dominant-negatives in vivo need to be evaluated. In conclusion, it is suggested that ARA54 enhances AR transactivation by interacting with AR and dimerizing with itself. We found that a mutant form of the C-terminal fragment of ARA54 suppressed AR transactivation in a dominant-negative manner in prostate cancer cells by blocking the homodimerization of fl-ARA54. Its overexpression also inhibited AR-mediated prostate cancer proliferation. The mt-ARA54 thus represents a feasible new approach to inhibiting AR-/ARA54-mediated bioactivities. The use of dominant-negative coregulators such as mt-ARA54 may ultimately contribute to the control of AR-mediated prostate tumor progression. We thank Drs. S. P. Balk, W. Kaelin, Jr., and C. A.

Previous studies have implicated lipid rafts in the transport of exogenous thyroglobulin (Tg), the predominant secretory protein of thyroid epithelial cells, to the apical surface in MDCK cells. We have examined the secretion of recombinant Tg and gp80/clusterin, a major endogenous secretory protein not detected in Triton X-100 insoluble rafts, for the investigation of the involvement of MAL in the constitutive apical secretory pathway of MDCK cells. We show that MAL depletion impairs apical secretion of Tg and causes its accumulation in the Golgi. Cholesterol sequestration, which blocks apical secretion of Tg, did not alter the levels of MAL in rafts but created a block proximal to Tg entrance into rafts. Apical secretion of gp80/clusterin was also inhibited by elimination of endogenous MAL. Our results suggest a role for MAL in the transport of both endogenously and exogenously expressed apical secretory proteins in MDCK cells.

We have examined the secretion of recombinant Tg and gp80/clusterin, a major endogenous secretory protein not detected in Triton X-100 insoluble rafts, for the investigation of the involvement of MAL in the constitutive apical secretory pathway of MDCK cells. We show that MAL depletion impairs apical secretion of Tg and causes its accumulation in the Golgi. Cholesterol sequestration, which blocks apical secretion of Tg, did not alter the levels of MAL in rafts but created a block proximal to Tg entrance into rafts. Apical secretion of gp80/clusterin was also inhibited by elimination of endogenous MAL. Our results suggest a role for MAL in the transport of both endogenously and exogenously expressed apical secretory proteins in MDCK cells. hemagglutinin methyl-β-cyclodextrin glycosylphosphatidylinositol Fischer rat thyroid cells human monoclonal antibody Madin-Darby canine kidney thyroglobulin human MAL 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid Segregation of newly synthesized proteins into distinct vesicular carriers destined for the apical or basolateral subdomains is fundamental for the establishment and maintenance of polarity in epithelial cells. Basolateral targeting of transmembrane proteins is mediated by sorting signals in their cytoplasmic tail that might or might not be related to dileucine- or tyrosine-based sorting signals (1Matter K.

In contrast, apical sorting of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA)1 and proteins attached to the membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor appears to be mediated in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells by a different mechanism (3Simons K. Wandinger-Ness A. Cell. 1990; 62: 207-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) involving integration into specialized glycolipid and cholesterol-enriched membrane microdomains or rafts that subsequently originate vesicular carriers destined for the apical surface (4Skibbens J.E.

Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2609) Google Scholar), are essential for the incorporation of these proteins into rafts and their subsequent apical delivery. For some transmembrane proteins and also for GPI-anchored proteins, the presence of N- or O-glycans in the ectodomain appears to mediate apical sorting (9Gut A. Kappeler F. Hyka N. Balda M.S.

Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). However, glycation does not constitute a universal apical sorting signal, as unglycosylated transmembrane proteins are also delivered to the apical surface (11Alonso M.A. Fan L. Alarcón B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30748-30752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and even normally glycosylated membrane proteins are able to reach the apical surface in the absence of glycosylation (12Lisanti M.P.

Gonzalez A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13114-13119Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). MAL is a nonglycosylated integral membrane protein of 17 kDa containing multiple hydrophobic segments (15Alonso M.A. Weissman S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1997-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Endogenous MAL is localized at steady state, predominantly in the apical zone of polarized epithelial cells (16Martı́n-Belmonte F. Kremer L. Albar J.P. Marazuela M. Alonso M.A. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2077-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and resides in lipid rafts in epithelial MDCK and Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) cells (16Martı́n-Belmonte F. Kremer L. Albar J.P. Marazuela M. Alonso M.A. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2077-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 17Zacchetti D. Peranen J. Murata M. Fiedler K. Simons K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In MDCK cells in which endogenous MAL was depleted, a role has been demonstrated for MAL as an element of the apical sorting apparatus necessary for transport of apical membrane proteins (18Puertollano R. Martı́n-Belmonte F. Millán J. de Marco M.C. Albar J.P. Kremer L. Alonso M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 19Cheong K.H. Zacchetti D. Schneeberger E.E.

Cell. 2000; 11: 2033-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This emphasizes that MAL is the first integral membrane component of the machinery for apical transport of membrane proteins to be identified. Secretory proteins are cotranslationally delivered to the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, and hence, in contrast to transmembrane proteins, they remain exclusively luminal throughout the entire exocytic pathway. The lack of domains that could provide targeting signals directly via incorporation into rafts or recognition by cytosolic machinery in secretory proteins indicates that luminal sorting features are responsible for their polarized transport.N-glycans were shown to act as an apical sorting signal for a number of secretory proteins (21Scheiffele P. Simons K. Nature. 1995; 378: 96-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), leading to the suggestion that specialized lectins were involved as sorting machinery (22Fiedler K. Simons K. Cell. 1995; 81: 309-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). However, as there are examples of apical sorting of secretory proteins in the absence of glycation (23Marzolo M.P. Bull P. González A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1834-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 24Larsen J.E. Avvkumov G.V. Hammond G.L. Vogel L.K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), it is clear that this mechanism cannot be applied to all secretory proteins. It is more likely that specialized machinery recognizes conformational features in the secretory proteins that control segregation into distinct vesicular carriers destined for the apical or basolateral surface (25Rodriguez-Boulan E. Gonzalez A. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 291-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Specialized epithelial cells may export newly synthesized secretory proteins either using a constitutive pathway similar to that present in other epithelia or through a regulated pathway involving storage in secretory granules (26Arvan P. Castle D. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 593-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Thyroglobulin (Tg), the thyroid hormone precursor product, is apically secreted by thyroid epithelial cells. Although Tg appears to use the regulated pathway in these cells, Tg is also predominantly released from the apical surface when expressed in polarized MDCK cells, which lack such a pathway (27Martı́n-Belmonte F. Alonso M.A. Zhang X. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41074-41081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This indicates that luminal sorting features present in Tg can be decoded also in MDCK cells. Although Tg lacks a direct means of membrane attachment, a small percentage of intracellular Tg molecules was found to be associated with the Triton X-100-insoluble raft fraction in MDCK cells, suggesting that one or more membrane components bind Tg to the rafts during biosynthetic transport (27Martı́n-Belmonte F. Alonso M.A. Zhang X. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41074-41081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Delivery of Tg to the apical surface was dependent on normal cholesterol levels supporting a role for the rafts in Tg transport (27Martı́n-Belmonte F. Alonso M.A. Zhang X. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41074-41081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In contrast to Tg, clusterin/gp80, the major apically secreted endogenous protein of MDCK cells, is exclusively detected in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction during biosynthetic transport in MDCK cells (28Graichen R. Lösch A. Appel D. Koch-Brandt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15854-15857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Despite that fact, normal apical sorting of gp80 requires intact cholesterol levels (6Keller P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1357-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). In this study we show that MAL depletion impaired apical secretion of Tg and caused its retention in the Golgi. Apical secretion of gp80 was also impaired, indicating a role for MAL in apical transport of both endogenously and exogenously expressed apical secretory proteins in MDCK cells. The DNA construct expressing rat Tg has been described previously (29Muresan Z. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26095-26102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to Tg were obtained from Dr. P. R. Larsen (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA). The mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) 9E10 against the c-Myc epitope EQKLISEED was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The rat mAb 2E5 specific to dog MAL has been described previously (18Puertollano R. Martı́n-Belmonte F. Millán J. de Marco M.C. Albar J.P. Kremer L. Alonso M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The anti-calnexin mAb was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-IgG antibodies were supplied by Pierce. Fluorescein- and Texas Red-conjugated antibodies were from Southern Biotech (Birmingham, AL). Antibodies to the 58-K Golgi marker, Triton X-100, methyl-β-cyclodextrin (CD), and cycloheximide were purchased from Sigma. The MDCK II cells stably expressing recombinant Tg have been described previously (27Martı́n-Belmonte F. Alonso M.A. Zhang X. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41074-41081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cells were grown on Petri dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Depletion of cellular cholesterol was carried out by treating the cells with 10 mm CD for 30 min 4 h before analysis (30Yancey P.G. Rodrigueza W.V. Kilsdonk E.P. Stoudt G.W. Johnson W.J. Philips M.C.

The construct expressing a human (h) MAL protein lacking the four amino acids contiguous with the initial methionine residue and bearing the 9E10 c-Myc epitope at the NH2 terminus (hMAL-ΔN); the control (AM) and antisense (AS) phosphorothioate oligonucleotides have been described previously (20Martı́n-Belmonte F. Puertollano R. Millán J. Alonso M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2033-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides (20 μm) were introduced into MDCK cells using the electroporation protocol of Puertollano et al. (18Puertollano R. Martı́n-Belmonte F. Millán J. de Marco M.C. Albar J.P. Kremer L. Alonso M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Transfection of the MDCK cells stably expressing Tg with plasmid DNA containing hMAL-ΔN coding sequences was carried out by electroporation with the Electro Cell Manipulator 600 equipment (BTX, San Diego, CA). Stable transfectants expressing hMAL-ΔN were selected by treatment with 0.75 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) for at least 4 weeks following transfection. Drug-resistant cells were selected and screened by immunofluorescence analysis, and the resulting positive clones were maintained in drug-free medium. After several passages in this medium, >95% of cells within the selected positive clones retained expression of the ectopic protein. Lipid rafts were isolated by standard procedures (5Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2609) Google Scholar). Cells grown to confluency in 100-mm dishes were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed for 20 min in 1 ml of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C. The lysate was scraped from the dishes with a cell lifter, the dishes were rinsed with 1 ml of the same buffer at 4 °C, and the lysate was homogenized by passing the sample through a 22-gauge needle. The extract was finally brought to 40% sucrose in a final volume of 4 ml and sequentially overlaid with 6 ml of 30% sucrose and 2 ml of 5% sucrose. Gradients were centrifuged for 18 h at 39,000 rpm at 4 °C in a Beckman SW41 rotor. The opalescent band at the 5–30% sucrose interface, containing rafts, was collected as the Triton X-100 insoluble fraction, whereas the 40% sucrose layer containing the load was harvested as the Triton X-100 soluble fraction. MDCK cells were seeded at confluent levels on 24-mm polyester tissue culture inserts of 0.4-μm pore size (Transwell, Costar Inc., Cambridge, MA). The integrity of the cell monolayer was monitored by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance using the Millicell ERS apparatus (Millipore, Bedford, MA). For metabolic labeling of cells in filters, cells were starved in media lacking methionine and cysteine. After 30 min, 250 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) were added to the basolateral compartment, and filters were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. To analyze polarized secretion of Tg, the culture medium was withdrawn 8 h later from the apical and basolateral compartments and subjected to immunoprecipitation analysis with anti-Tg antibodies. Polarized secretion of gp80 was determined by autoradiography of equivalent aliquots from the apical and basolateral culture media after SDS-PAGE. For immunoblot analysis, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE in 15% acrylamide gels under reducing conditions and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). After blocking with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline, blots were incubated with the indicated primary antibody. After several washings, blots were incubated for 1 h with goat anti-mouse or anti-rat IgG antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase, washed extensively, and developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting kit (ECL, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). For immunoprecipitation of MAL, antibodies were pre-bound overnight at 4 °C to protein G-Sepharose in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100. Cell extracts were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with a control antibody bound to protein G-Sepharose, and the supernatant was immunoprecipitated by incubation for 4 h at 4 °C with the appropriate antibodies bound to protein G-Sepharose. After collection, the immunoprecipitates were washed six times with 1 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15m NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100 and analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. To detect 35S labeling, dried gels were finally exposed to Fujifilm imaging plates (Fuji Photo Film Co., Tokyo, Japan). For analysis of endoglycosidase H resistance, immunoprecipitates were incubated overnight at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 0.05 units/ml endoglycosidase H (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) before analysis by SDS-PAGE. Quantitative analyses were done using the ImageJ program (Research Services Branch, National Institutes of Health). MDCK cells grown on coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, rinsed, and treated with 10 mm glycine for 5 min to quench the aldehyde groups. The cells were then permeabilized or not with 0.2% Triton X-100, rinsed, and incubated with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min. Cells were then incubated for 1 h with the indicated primary antibodies, rinsed several times, and incubated for 1 h with specific fluorescent secondary antibodies. Images were obtained using a conventional fluorescence microscope (Zeiss). Controls to assess the specificity of the labeling included incubations with control primary antibodies or omission of the primary antibodies. We described previously that apical secretion of Tg requires intact lipid rafts (27Martı́n-Belmonte F. Alonso M.A. Zhang X. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41074-41081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As MAL has been demonstrated to be a component of the machinery for the raft-dependent apical transport of membrane proteins in MDCK cells (18Puertollano R. Martı́n-Belmonte F. Millán J. de Marco M.C. Albar J.P. Kremer L. Alonso M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 19Cheong K.H. Zacchetti D. Schneeberger E.E. Simons K. Proc.

Cell. 2000; 11: 2033-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), we thought that MAL might also mediate the apical transport of secretory proteins. To address this point, we first compared the intracellular distribution of Tg and MAL in MDCK cells (Fig. 1). Although much of the intracellular Tg distributed in the endoplasmic reticulum as revealed by colocalization with calnexin, an endogenous membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum, a small fraction of Tg colocalized with MAL in the Golgi region. This distribution of Tg is consistent with our previous biochemical analysis showing that there are two pools of intracellular Tg in MDCK cells, one major pool that is sensitive to endoglycosidase H digestion and is excluded from lipid rafts and a minor pool that is both endoglycosidase H-resistant and associated with lipid rafts (27Martı́n-Belmonte F. Alonso M.A. Zhang X. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41074-41081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To approach directly the possible role of MAL in Tg transport, we used specific antisense oligonucleotides to deplete the levels of endogenous MAL as described previously (18Puertollano R. Martı́n-Belmonte F. Millán J. de Marco M.C. Albar J.P. Kremer L. Alonso M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 20Martı́n-Belmonte F. Puertollano R. Millán J. Alonso M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2033-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). MDCK cells stably expressing Tg were transfected with either control AM or antisense oligonucleotides. 48 h later, cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine and incubated at 37 °C in the absence of radioactive precursors. After 8 h, medium was recovered from both the apical and basolateral compartments, and the cell monolayer was lysed. After immunoprecipitation with anti-Tg antibodies, Tg was visualized by autoradiography of the immunoprecipitates. The extent of MAL depletion obtained was quantified by densitometric scanning of immunoblots of the cell lysates probed with anti-MAL mAb 2E5. A representative experiment in which MAL levels dropped to ∼6% of those in control cells is shown in Fig.2A. Whereas, under the conditions of chase used, ∼95% of the labeled Tg was recovered from the apical compartment in cell transfected with the control oligonucleotide, depletion of MAL reduced the levels of apical secretion of Tg to one-third and caused a concomitant increase in cell-associated Tg. To confirm that the observed effects were due to MAL depletion, we used MDCK/hMAL-ΔN cells, which express a modified MAL protein in which levels are insensitive to treatment with antisense oligonucleotides (20Martı́n-Belmonte F. Puertollano R. Millán J. Alonso M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2033-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows that the exogenous expression of hMAL-ΔN allowed normal apical secretion of Tg and prevented its accumulation within the cell, despite the drop in the endogenous MAL content. A quantitative analysis of the amount of Tg in the apical and the basolateral compartments and that present in the cell lysate is shown in Fig. 2B. It is of particular note that in MAL-depleted cells the total Tg recovered was less than that in control cells, probably because of progressive degradation of the retained protein. The compilation of the different experiments presented in Fig. 2C shows a clear correlation between MAL depletion and progressive reduction of Tg secretion into the apical medium. To gain further insight into the effect of MAL depletion on Tg transport, we compared the intracellular distribution of Tg in cells with normal and depleted levels of MAL (Fig.3). As newly synthesized Tg requires ∼8 h to be fully secreted (27Martı́n-Belmonte F. Alonso M.A. Zhang X. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41074-41081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), intracellular Tg can be detected at steady state by immunofluorescence analysis in control MDCK cells. To trace the Tg that accumulates in the cells specifically because of MAL depletion and to distinguish it from newly synthesized Tg, we treated the cells with cycloheximide for 8 h to inhibit protein synthesis and to allow the pre-existing Tg to be secreted. Fig. 3 shows that this treatment indeed allowed the secretion of most of the pre-existing Tg, as revealed by the reduced Tg staining found in the control cell cultures treated with cycloheximide (Fig. 3, middle panels) compared with the cells incubated in the absence of the protein synthesis inhibitor (top panels). Consistent with the biochemical results presented in Fig. 2, depletion of MAL with antisense (AS) oligonucleotides produced a detectable intracellular accumulation of Tg (Fig. 3, bottom panels). It is of particular note that the retained Tg colocalized significantly with the 58-K Golgi marker in MAL-depleted cells, suggesting that elimination of MAL produces partial accumulation of Tg in the Golgi. To confirm this observation by biochemical means, we compared the resistance to endoglycosidase H digestion of the secreted and the intracellular Tg from cells with normal or depleted levels of MAL (Fig. 4). Secreted Tg was endoglycosidase H-resistant, corresponding to the mature protein, regardless of the levels of MAL. However, whereas intracellular Tg was nearly 100% endoglycosidase H-sensitive in control cells, in cells with depleted levels of MAL ∼50% of the protein acquired endoglycosidase H resistance, consistent with the observed partial accumulation of the protein in the Golgi (Fig. 3).Figure 4Biochemical analysis of intracellular Tg inMDCK cells with reduced levels of MAL. MDCK cells expressing exogenous Tg were transfected with control (AM) or antisense (AS) oligonucleotide and were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. Cells were labeled metabolically for 30 min and incubated in the absence of the radioactive precursors. After 8 h, the culture supernatant (Sup) containing the radiolabeled secreted Tg was harvested, and the cells were lysed (Lys). After immunoprecipitation with anti-Tg antibodies, the immunoprecipitates from the cell lysate were resuspended in denaturing buffer, divided and placed in two different tubes, and incubated in the presence (+) or absence (−) of endoglycosidase H (endo H). Theasterisk indicates the position of a unspecific protein band occasionally detected in the immunoprecipitates. Note that whereas secreted Tg was endoglycosidase H-resistant (R) regardless of he levels of MAL, intracellular Tg was completely sensitive (S) in cells treated with the control oligonucleotide (AM) or partially resistant to endoglycosidase H digestion in cells with the levels of MAL depleted by treatment with the antisense oligonucleotide (AS).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We had previously described that cholesterol sequestration with CD inhibits secretion of Tg in MDCK cells (27Martı́n-Belmonte F. Alonso M.A. Zhang X. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41074-41081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To establish a connection between the effect of cholesterol sequestration and that of MAL depletion, we analyzed the effect of CD on the presence of Tg and MAL in lipid rafts. Fig. 5 shows that the reduction of apical secretion of Tg caused by treatment with CD was not due to reduced partitioning of MAL into lipid rafts but rather to a diminished incorporation of newly synthesized Tg in those specialized microdomains. This might be interpreted as meaning that CD treatment blocks access of newly synthesized Tg to the rafts containing MAL. To analyze the effect of MAL depletion on the secretion of gp80, the major endogenous secretory protein of MDCK cells, cells were labeled metabolically with [35S]methionine/cysteine and incubated at 37 °C in the absence of radioactive precursors. After 8 h, medium was recovered from both the apical and basolateral compartments, equivalent aliquots from the apical and basolateral samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and gp80 was visualized by autoradiography. A representative experiment in which MAL levels dropped to ∼7% of those in control cells is shown in Fig.6A. Under the conditions used, most of the secreted gp80 was recovered from the apical compartment in cells transfected with the control oligonucleotide, consistent with the reported apical targeting of gp80 in normal MDCK cells. Consistent with the pattern of Tg secretion presented in Fig. 2, apical secretion of gp80 was greatly reduced in MAL-depleted cells. The exogenous expression of hMAL-ΔN allowed normal apical secretion of gp80 despite the drop in the endogenous MAL content. A quantitative analysis of the amount of gp80 secreted into the apical and basolateral compartments is shown in Fig. 6B. Segregation of secretory proteins into distinct containers destined for either the apical or basolateral surface should be mediated through recognition of sorting determinants by membrane receptors specific for either the apical or basolateral pathways in the lumen of the exocytic compartments. The receptor-secretory protein complex is assumed to gain access to the appropriate vesicular carrier using the same type of sorting signal as that employed by membrane cargo. Secretory granules of pancreatic acinar cells contain rafts, and apical secretion of zymogens by the regulated secretory pathway requires normal levels of cholesterol (31Schmidt K. Schrader M. Kern H.-F. Kleene R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14315-14323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Carboxypeptidase E is a raft-associated protein that has been proposed to function as a sorting receptor for some prohormones in the regulated secretory pathway (32Dhanvantari S. Loh Y.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29887-29893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Definitive identification of secretory protein receptors in the constitutive secretory pathway remains elusive, although overexpression experiments of two different apical secretory proteins indicate that apical sorting of this type of protein is a saturable and signal-mediated process probably involving competition for sorting receptors (33Marmorstein A.D.

Our previous study of MDCK and FRT cells indicates that the secretory Tg protein becomes integrated into lipid rafts during biosynthetic transport as would be expected if its putative receptor uses the same raft-mediated mechanism of apical transport as the cargo HA molecule (27Martı́n-Belmonte F.

The MAL protein is the first integral membrane member to be identified of the sorting machinery necessary for apical transport of HA in MDCK cells (18Puertollano R. Martı́n-Belmonte F.

In this study, we have used Tg as a model of raft-associated secretory protein to analyze the role of MAL in the transport of this type of protein in MDCK cells, which lack the regulated secretory pathway. We have observed that apical secretion of Tg is impaired in MDCK cells with reduced levels of MAL. At least a fraction of newly synthesized Tg accumulates in the Golgi under those conditions, as revealed by immunofluorescence analysis and acquisition of resistance to endoglycosidase H digestion, suggesting that egress of Tg from the Golgi is affected by MAL depletion. The observed accumulation of Tg in the Golgi is consistent with the proposed role of MAL in formation of the transport vesicles destined for the apical surface (34Puertollano R. Li S. Lisanti M.P. Alonso M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18311-18315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 35Puertollano R. Martı́nez-Menárguez J.A. Batista A. Ballesta J. Alonso M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1869-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cholesterol sequestration with CD inhibits secretion of Tg in MDCK cells, implicating lipid rafts in Tg transport (27Martı́n-Belmonte F. Alonso M.A. Zhang X. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41074-41081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The same treatment did not affect the residence of MAL in rafts, probably because of its strong association with those specialized membranes as revealed by its resistance to solubilization even at a high concentration of detergent (36Millán J. Puertollano R. Fan L. Alonso M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In contrast, incorporation of newly synthesized Tg into rafts was greatly diminished by CD treatment, suggesting a weak association of the protein with the rafts. This, in turn, suggests diminished recruitment of protein or lipid components that serve as Tg receptors (37Tooze S.A. Martens G.J. Huttner W.B. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 116-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). FRT cells were thought to be defective in raft-mediated apical transport as, unlike the case in MDCK cells, the majority of GPI-anchored proteins do not become integrated into rafts during transport and are targeted to the basolateral membrane (38Zurzolo C Lisanti M.P. Caras I.W. Nitsch L. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1031-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 39Zurzolo C. van't Hof W. van Meer G. Rodriguez-Boulan E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 42-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The fact that gp80 is apically secreted in FRT cells and the observation that gp80 is not detected in the raft fraction during biosynthetic transport to the apical surface in MDCK cells led to the suggestion that apical sorting of gp80 takes place by a raft-independent transport pathway (28Graichen R. Lösch A. Appel D. Koch-Brandt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15854-15857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that FRT cells assemble functional rafts for apical transport of HA and certain GPI-anchored proteins (20Martı́n-Belmonte F. Puertollano R. Millán J. Alonso M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2033-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 40Lipardi C. Nitsch L. Zurzolo C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Moreover, similar to HA targeting, cholesterol depletion inhibits apical secretion of gp80 in MDCK cells (6Keller P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1357-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Thus, although gp80 is not detected in the Triton X-100-insoluble raft fraction (28Graichen R. Lösch A. Appel D. Koch-Brandt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15854-15857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), this protein appears to require intact rafts for transport. We have found that, in addition to raft-associated Tg, efficient delivery of gp80 to the apical medium is also dependent on MAL levels consistent with the reported intracellular retention of gp80 in MDCK cells in which MAL levels were reduced (19Cheong K.H. Zacchetti D. Schneeberger E.E. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6241-6248Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The putative sorting receptors for Tg and gp80 appear to behave as membrane components associated with and not associated with Triton X-100 insoluble lipid rafts, respectively. It has been reported previously that apical transport of membrane proteins associated (HA and GPI-anchored proteins) or not associated (gp114, p75 neurotrophin receptor, and dipeptidylpeptidase IV) with lipid rafts, as well as the bulk of membrane proteins, are all sensitive to reduction of MAL levels (18Puertollano R. Martı́n-Belmonte F. Millán J. de Marco M.C. Albar J.P. Kremer L. Alonso M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 19Cheong K.H. Zacchetti D. Schneeberger E.E. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6241-6248Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 20Martı́n-Belmonte F. Puertollano R. Millán J. Alonso M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2033-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The fact that MAL depletion affects apical transport of raft- and non-raft-associated proteins might be explained by two alternative models (Fig. 7). The first model (Fig. 7A) proposes that only one pathway exists for most apical proteins with raft- and non-raft-associated proteins together in the same vesicle and directly involving MAL. Our current model postulates that the sorting sequences present in the carboxyl terminus of MAL might direct the formation of the transport vesicles by polymerization of vesicular coats (35Puertollano R. Martı́nez-Menárguez J.A. Batista A. Ballesta J. Alonso M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1869-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This action could produce a transient and weak stabilization in rafts of proteins such as gp80 that are not normally found in the raft fractions at steady state. This transient stabilization is not detectable by the standard insolubility assay using extraction with Triton X-100 (28Graichen R. Lösch A. Appel D. Koch-Brandt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15854-15857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), although it might be detected using the zwitterionic detergent CHAPS (6Keller P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1357-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The second model (Fig. 7B) proposes the existence of two different apical pathways, one with vesicles containing exclusively Triton X-100-insoluble raft-associated proteins and directly involving MAL and a second type of vesicle with proteins excluded from these rafts but either directly or indirectly requiring a functional MAL-mediated pathway. Whichever model is correct, the evidence in the present study shows that, regardless of their solubility in Triton X-100, MAL is required in MDCK cells for apical transport of endogenous and exogenous secretory proteins.

Luminal contents were separated into density subfractions in two continuous self-generating gradients of different density profiles. In enterocytes from rabbits fed a low fat diet, newly synthesized and immunodetectable apoB48 was only in the subfraction of density similar to high density lipoprotein (dense particles); the luminal triacylglycerol (TAG) content was low and only in the subfraction of density similar to that of chylomicrons/very low density lipoproteins (light particles). After feeding fat, newly synthesized, and immunodetectable apoB48 was in both dense (phospholipid-rich) and light (TAG-rich) particles. Luminal TAG mass and synthesis increased after fat feeding and was only in light particles. Pulse-chase experiments showed that the luminal-radiolabeled apoB48 lost from the dense particles was recovered in the light particles and the secreted chylomicrons. All of the light particle lipids (mass and newly synthesized) co-immunoprecipitated with apoB48. However, in the dense particles, there was a preferential co-precipitation of the preexisting rather than newly synthesized phospholipid. Assembly of apoB48-containing TAG-enriched lipoproteins is therefore a two-step process. The first step produces dense apoB48 phospholipid-rich particles, which accumulate in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum lumen. In the second step, these dense particles rapidly acquire the bulk of the TAG and additional phospholipid in a single and rapid step.

Triacylglycerols (TAG)1 are resynthesized and assembled into chylomicrons, which are released into the lamina propria and move via the lymph into the blood. The ability of enterocytes to assemble and secrete chylomicrons is modulated by a variety of factors including the amount and composition of the dietary fats (reviewed in Refs. 1Tso P. Johnson L.R.

Chylomicrons consist of droplets of TAG with some cholesterol ester, stabilized by a shell of phospholipids, cholesterol, and protein (1Tso P. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract.

The major protein of chylomicrons is apolipoprotein-B48 (apoB48), a truncated form of apoB100 produced through post-transcriptional editing of the mRNA of apoB100, the characteristic protein of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), which transport endogenous lipid from the liver (4Glickman R.M. Rogers M. Glickman J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 83: 5296-5300Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 5Davidson N.O. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract.

The intracellular events in the assembly of VLDL and chylomicrons revealed by electron microscopic studies are basically similar (7Strauss F.W. J. Lipid Res. 1966; 7: 307-3232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Jones A.L. Ocker R.K. J. Lipid Res. 1971; 12: 580-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Christensen N.J. Rubin C.E. Cheung M.E. Albers J.J. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 24: 1229-1242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ApoB is synthesized by bound ribosomes in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), the lipid components are synthesized in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER), and assembly of the lipoprotein particle occurs within the lumen of the ER/Golgi compartment. There is evidence for a two-step assembly of VLDL in which small, dense apoB-containing particles are formed initially in the lumen of the RER and fuse with TAG-rich particles, which form separately in the SER lumen (10Alexander C.A. Hamilton R.L. Havel R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 69 (, 263): 241Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 11Hamilton R.L. Erikson S.K. Havel R.L. Wood X.F.P. Davignon J. Sniderman A. Atherosclerosis.

Nutr. 1999; 129: S463-S466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Generally these observations on liver have been extrapolated to the enterocyte, and it has been assumed that chylomicron assembly follows a similar pattern (reviewed in Refs.2Hussain M. Kancha R.K. Zhou Z. Luchoomun J. Zu H. Bakillah A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1300: 151-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar and 3Hussain M. Atherosclerosis. 2000; 148: 1-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). However, chylomicrons are considerably larger and contain more TAG than VLDL. Enterocytes require a far larger capacity for chylomicron assembly (to accommodate the variations in the amount of dietary fat) than the liver needs for VLDL assembly. Rat hepatocytes, which synthesize apoB48 as well as apoB100, do not secrete chylomicrons, while apobec-1 knockout mice do secrete apoB100 in chylomicrons (13Hirano K.-I. Young S.G. Farese Jr., R.V.

Thus, assembly of chylomicrons is not determined by the form of apoB produced but is a characteristic property of enterocytes. Consistent with this, there is at least one protein that is specifically essential for chylomicron and not VLDL formation and is absent/defective in chylomicron retention disease (15Roy C.C. Levy E. Green P.R.H. Sniderman A. Letarte L. Buts J-P. Orquin J. Brocju P. Weber A.M. Morin C. et al.Gastroenterology. 1987; 92: 390-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although there have been many studies of VLDL assembly in liver, isolated hepatocytes, and cultured cell lines, there have been few studies of chylomicron assembly. This is in part because there is no good cultured cell model that secretes chylomicrons containing only apoB48. Important data have been obtained using CaCO2 cells (reviewed in Refs. 2Hussain M. Kancha R.K. Zhou Z. Luchoomun J. Zu H. Bakillah A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1300: 151-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar and 3Hussain M. Atherosclerosis. 2000; 148: 1-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar); however, these cells secrete relatively dense lipoproteins that contain apoB100 in addition to apoB48. As we are interested in the effects of diet on fat absorption, under physiological conditions, we have recently developed a method for the preparation of viable isolated rabbit enterocytes, which synthesize apoB48 and lipid (but not apoB100) and assemble and secrete chylomicrons (16Cartwright I.J. Higgins J.A. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1357-1365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Cartwright I.J. Higgins J.A J.

Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1729-1739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). We have also developed methods for the separation of the components of the secretory compartment of enterocytes (RER/SER/Golgi) in a single self-generating gradient that have allowed us to dissect the intracellular events in chylomicron assembly (18Cartwright I.J. Plonne D. Higgins J.A. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1729-1739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). We have shown that in enterocytes, although apoB48 is synthesized by bound ribosomes, it is not detectable in either the membrane or lumen of the RER; membrane-associated and luminal apoB48 and TAG are both concentrated in the SER (16Cartwright I.J. Higgins J.A. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1357-1365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is in contrast to the hepatocyte, in which luminal-dense apoB100-containing particles and TAG-rich particles form in the RER and SER, respectively. Our observations raise questions concerning the sequence of events in chylomicron assembly vis à vis VLDL assembly. Does this take place in one or more steps? To answer this question, we have now investigated the nature of the chylomicron precursors in the lumen of the secretory compartment. Our results are consistent with a two-step assembly of chylomicrons, which exhibits differences from VLDL assembly that may be important in the regulation of fat absorption.

Dwarf lop rabbits (∼6 months old, 2.56 ± 0.12 kg) were bred in the University of Sheffield Field Laboratories. Rabbits were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle and allowed free access to water and low fat chow (2.5% fat (w/w) equivalent to 7% of the dietary energy intake) (chow-fed). In some experiments, the diets were supplemented with sunflower oil to increase the TAG content to 7.5% (w/v), equivalent to 21% of the calorie intake for 3 or 6 days, as described previously (fat-fed) (17Cartwright I.J. Higgins J.A J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1858-1866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit plasma lipoproteins were separated by a modification of the method we developed for separation of human lipoproteins (19Higgins J.A. Graham J.M. Davies I.G. Drew A.F. Atherosclerosis. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2000: 37-50Google Scholar). Blood was collected by cardiac puncture, and disodium EDTA (anticoagulant) was added (final concentration 2.7 mm). Red cells were pelleted by centrifugation (1000 × g for 20 min), and 4 volumes of plasma were mixed with 1 volume of Liposep (final concentration 12% iodixanol). 1.4 ml of the mixture was layered beneath 1.4 ml of 9% iodixanol solution (0.75 parts Liposep mixed with 4.25 parts Hepes-buffered saline, pH 7.8) in an Optiseal tube for the Beckman TLN100 near vertical Ultracentrifuge rotor. The tube was topped up with ∼0.12 ml of 10 mmHepes-buffered saline (pH 7.8), sealed, and centrifuged in the Beckman Optima MaxE bench top Ultracentrifuge at 100,000 rpm (350,000 ×g av) for 2 h and 30 min at 16 °C. The gradient formed was collected in 10 fractions from the bottom using a Beckman gradient unloader. Cholesterol and TAG content of the fractions was determined using kits from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and Alpha Laboratories, respectively (19Higgins J.A. Graham J.M. Davies I.G. Drew A.F. Atherosclerosis. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2000: 37-50Google Scholar). The lipoprotein in each fraction was identified by agarose gel electrophoresis using Sebia hydragels (Lipo+Lp(a)) (19Higgins J.A. Graham J.M. Davies I.G. Drew A.F. Atherosclerosis. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2000: 37-50Google Scholar). Plasma lipoproteins were also separated in a gradient with a different profile designed to move the HDL toward the middle of the centrifuge tube. In this case, the protocol was exactly the same as above except that 1 part Liposep was added to 4 parts plasma (15% iodixanol); this was layered beneath 15% iodixanol, and the tubes were centrifuged for 90 min. Villous enterocytes were isolated from the small intestine of rabbits and incubated for 30 min with lipid and bile salt micelles containing [14C]oleate (4 μCi) or [35S]methionine (1 mCi) to radiolabel newly synthesized TAG and phospholipid and apoB48, respectively (16Cartwright I.J.

Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1729-1739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The enterocytes were pelleted by centrifugation and homogenized, and total microsomes were prepared and separated into RER, SER, and Golgi fractions in self-generating gradients of iodixanol (18Cartwright I.J. Plonne D. Higgins J.A. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1729-1739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). In some experiments, enterocytes were incubated with labeled micelles for 30 min, isolated by centrifugation, and reincubated with unlabeled micelles for a range of times. The cells were reisolated by centrifugation. The media were transferred to centrifuge tubes for the Beckman MLA rotor, 0.5 ml of HEPES-buffered saline was carefully pipetted on top of the media, and the tubes were centrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 1 h. After centrifugation, the interface between the HEPES-buffered saline layer and the media was distinct, and the top 0.5 ml, which was milky, was carefully removed, the apoB48-containing lipoproteins were immunoprecipitated, and the apoB48 and lipids were determined (18Cartwright I.J. Plonne D. Higgins J.A. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1729-1739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). In preliminary experiments, it was demonstrated that the infranatant did not contain detectable radiolabeled or immunologically detectable apoB48. Microsomal membrane and luminal content fractions were prepared by treatment with sodium carbonate (18Cartwright I.J. Plonne D. Higgins J.A. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1729-1739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). To remove the sodium carbonate and change the buffer, the luminal contents were concentrated to 0.2 ml by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 2 h in Vivaspin ultrafiltration devices followed by resuspension to 4 ml with TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) and reconcentrated as above. The final concentrates were resuspended to 1.12 ml with TBS and mixed with 0.28 ml of Liposep (final concentration, 12% iodixanol), and the chylomicron precursors were separated in self-generated gradients exactly as described above for plasma lipoproteins. ApoB48 was immunoprecipitated from luminal content subfractions using an anti-rabbit monoclonal antibody (MAC31), which recognizes the N terminus of apoB100 (20Wilkinson J. Higgins J.A. Groot P.H.E. Gherardi E. Bowyer D.E. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 34: 815-825Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Samples were concentrated to 0.2 ml in Vivaspin centrifugal concentrators and mixed with 0.05 ml of MAC 31 for 4 h at 4 °C, followed by the addition of 0.2 ml of anti-rat IgG agarose, and then mixed for 16 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated apoB48-containing particles attached to the agarose beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 1700 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed by resuspension in TBS and recentrifugation. Controls were carried out using the same protocol without primary antibody or with an anti-actin monoclonal antibody (gift of Dr Lynda Partridge in this department). No immunoprecipitation of apoB48 or lipids occurred in the absence of MAC31. Lipids were extracted from luminal content subfractions, separated by high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC), and stained, and the mass of TAG, phosphatidylcholine (PC), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) was determined by laser densitometry (16Cartwright I.J.

Self-generating gradients of iodixanol have been used for the separation of human plasma lipoproteins (19Higgins J.A. Graham J.M. Davies I.G. Drew A.F. Atherosclerosis. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2000: 37-50Google Scholar) and therefore potentially provide a simple procedure for the determination of the density distribution of luminal lipoprotein precursors in the secretory compartment of enterocytes. In initial experiments, rabbit plasma was used to establish the protocol. After centrifugation in two-step iodixanol gradients, rabbit plasma VLDL floated to the top of the gradient (Fig. 1, fraction 1), LDL peaked in the upper half of the gradient (Fig. 1, fractions 3–5), and HDL peaked in the lower half of the gradient (Fig. 1,fractions 7–10). Because of their low density (<1.000 g/ml), chylomicrons move to the top of the gradient with the VLDL; however, chylomicrons were not detectable in the rabbit plasma. The densities of the fractions in which the lipoproteins were collected were 1.032–1.21, 1.015–1.032, and 1.002–1.009 g/ml for HDL, LDL, and VLDL, respectively. It must be emphasized that this is the density of the iodixanol fractions and that the lipoproteins have slightly different densities in salt gradients because the salt removes water from the particles (19Higgins J.A. Graham J.M. Davies I.G. Drew A.F. Atherosclerosis. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2000: 37-50Google Scholar). We have previously shown that in enterocytes from rabbits fed low fat chow, most of the intracellular TAG is associated with the SER membrane, and apoB48 is both membrane-bound and in the luminal contents (18Cartwright I.J. Plonne D. Higgins J.A. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1729-1739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). After feeding fat, the membrane-bound TAG remains relatively unchanged, but there is a large increase in the ER luminal TAG; however, there was little change in the apoB48 (18Cartwright I.J. Plonne D. Higgins J.A. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1729-1739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). To determine the nature of the chylomicron precursors under these different dietary conditions, we analyzed the ER luminal contents from rabbit enterocytes fed a low fat chow diet and a high fat diet for 3 or 6 days. Rabbit enterocytes were incubated with micelles containing [35S]methionine (to radiolabel newly synthesized apoB48) and [14C]oleate (to radiolabel newly synthesized lipid). The microsomal luminal contents were prepared and separated in the gradient developed for the separation of plasma lipoproteins. In luminal gradient fractions from chow-fed rabbit enterocytes, immunodetectable apoB48 and newly synthesized radiolabeled apoB48 were located only in the bottom fractions 8–10, which have a density of 1.067–1.21 g/ml, similar to that of plasma HDL (Fig.2). In fractions from fat-fed rabbit enterocytes, both newly synthesized radiolabeled and immunodetectable apoB48 were found in the bottom fractions 7–10 and also in the top fraction 1, which has the density, <1.0086 and corresponds to chylomicrons/VLDL (Fig. 2). Although there was an increased synthesis of apoB48 after feeding fat, there was no apparent increase in the apoB48 detected by immunoblotting carried out under identical conditions (Fig. 2 B). The luminal TAG content was low in gradient fractions from enterocytes of chow-fed rabbits and only detectable in the top fraction 1 of the gradient (Fig. 3 A). After feeding sunflower oil, there was an increase in both the newly synthesized TAG and the mass of TAG in this light gradient fraction (Fig. 3 A). The increase was related to the length of time the high fat diet was fed from 0 to 3 and from 3 to 6 days. Almost 100% of the TAG mass and the radiolabeled TAG in the luminal light fractions 1–2 was co-immunoprecipitated with apoB48 (Fig.3 B), indicating that under all dietary conditions investigated, luminal TAG is only in apoB48-containing particles of the density of VLDL/chylomicrons. Phosphatidylcholine (∼80% of the phospholipid mass) and phosphatidylethanolamine were the only detected phospholipids in the luminal contents, and they showed similar density distributions in the gradient fractions (Figs. 4 and 5). Newly synthesized phospholipids were at a low concentration in the fractions from chow-fed rabbit enterocytes, and the amount of phospholipid in each fraction was only significant in the densest gradient fraction 10, which also contained the highest concentration of apoB48 (Figs.4 A and 5 A). After fat feeding, the mass of phospholipid increased in the denser fractions 7–10, coincident with the immunodetectable apoB48. Newly synthesized phospholipids showed a different distribution from phospholipid mass after feeding fat with a greater incorporation of radiolabel into fraction 1.Figure 5Density distribution of PE in luminal gradient fractions. The experiment was conducted as in the legend for Fig. 3. A, the density distributions of radiolabeled PE, respectively, are plotted for the three dietary states ±SD (n = 3). B, fractions 1–3, 4–7, and 8–10 from microsomes from chow-fed and fat-fed for 6 days were pooled, and the apoB48 was immunoprecipitated. The percentage of radiolabeled PE mass co-immunoprecipitating with apoB (%co-ppt) is plotted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As the amounts of material in gradient fractions are small, especially in the samples from chow-fed rabbit enterocytes, gradient fractions were pooled into light (fractions 1–3), intermediate (fractions 4–7), and dense (fractions 8–10) to investigate the association between luminal phospholipids and apoB48. In the fat-fed enterocytes, all of the mass of the phospholipids and the newly synthesized phospholipids were co-immunoprecipitated with apoB48 in the luminal light and intermediate fractions (Figs. 4 B and5 B). This was also the case in fractions from chow-fed enterocytes, although the amounts of phospholipid were very small, and accurate measurement was not possible. In contrast, although a large fraction of the mass of the phospholipids (70–80%) in the dense fractions co-immunoprecipitated with apoB48, only ∼30% of the newly synthesized radiolabeled phospholipids were co-precipitated (Figs.4 B and 5 B). The specific activity of phospholipids that co-immunoprecipitated with apoB from the dense fractions was ∼8-fold lower than that of phospholipids in the supernatant. Therefore, preformed phospholipids are preferentially incorporated into the dense apoB48-containing particle, whereas newly synthesized phospholipids are incorporated into the light particles. The lipid composition of luminal gradient fractions was not altered by feeding fat. The light fraction contained 68.6 ± 0.3%, 23.7 ± 0.5%, and 7.8 ± 1.1% (n = 3) TAG, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylethanolamine, respectively. The dense fraction contained 13.3 ± 1.1%, 67.3 ± 0.4%, and 19.0 ± 0.2% TAG, PC, and PE, respectively. The TAG content of the light particles compared with the phospholipid content is ∼20% less than that usually reported for chylomicrons. However, to measure the very small amounts of lipids in the luminal content fractions, it was necessary to use a very sensitive technique, HPTLC to separate the lipids followed by staining with cupric acetate, which reacts with double bonds in the acyl moieties, followed by quantification by laser densitometry (21Cartwright I.J. Higgins J.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 977-984Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 22Cartwright I.J. Higgins J.A. Wilkinson J. Bellevia S. Kendrick J.S. Graham J.M. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 531-545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Triolein was used as the standard TAG. As the hepatic TAG contains a mixture of fatty acids of different degrees of saturation, this would stain to a smaller extent per molecule than triolein, thus underestimating the amount of TAG. In iodixanol solutions, proteins have a density of ∼1.26 g/ml (26Ford T. Rickwood D. Rickwood D. Iodinated Density Gradient Media: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, London1985: 23-42Google Scholar) and would be expected to form a pellet in the 9–12% gradients used to separate luminal contents. However, using this gradient, we cannot exclude the possibility that some apoB48 in the dense fractions is free or denatured protein. Therefore, in order to check that the apoB48-containing dense fractions behave as lipoprotein particles, the luminal contents from chow-fed enterocytes were also separated in 15% iodixanol gradients in addition to 9–12% gradients. Under these conditions, plasma HDL move to the middle of the tube, peaking in fractions 5–7, which have densities of 1.055–1.069 g/ml, while LDL move to the top of the tube in fractions of densities 1.024–1.039 g/ml (Fig. 6). VLDL are lost because they are considerably lighter than the density of the top fraction, which they move through, and adhere to the shoulders of the Optiseal tubes. In these gradients, the apoB48-containing fractions, which are at the bottom of the 9–12% gradient, moved to the middle fractions of densities 1.039–1.061 g/ml, overlapping the densities of HDL in the same gradients (Fig. 7). The small amount of TAG in the dense particles, both the mass and the radiolabele"

We have investigated the targeting and topological determinants present within the oleosin polypeptide sequence using ER-derived canine pancreatic microsomes. Our data indicate that oleosins are integrated into membranes by a cotranslational, translocon-mediated pathway. This is supported by the identification of two independent functional signal sequences in the H domain, and by demonstrating the involvement of the SRP receptor in membrane targeting. Oleosin topology was manipulated by the addition of an N-terminal cleavable signal sequence, resulting in translocation of the N terminus to the microsomal lumen. Surprisingly, the C terminus failed to translocate. Inhibition of C-terminal translocation was not dependent on either the sequence of hydrophobic segments in the H domain, the central proline knot motif or charges flanking the H domain. Therefore, the topological constraint results from the length and/or the hydrophobicity of the H domain, implying a general case that long hydrophobic spans are unable to translocate their C terminus to the ER lumen.

Lodish H.F. Science. 1985; 230: 400-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 2Johnson A.E. van Waes M.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 799-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). A set of general rules has been established that are useful for prediction of unknown topologies. These rules also further our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of membrane insertion. In the simplest case, individual membrane spans can be orientated by sequential insertion, resulting in adoption of the opposite orientation to the previous span (3Hegde R.S. Lingappa V.R. Cell. 1997; 91: 575-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The presence of charged residues in flanking regions is a critical influence on the orientation of individual membrane spans; positively charged residues show a strong preference for retention in the cytosol, while negatively charged residues have a weak affinity for translocation to the ER lumen (4Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5786-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 5von Heijne G.

Variants of a yeast protein, Ste2p, a G protein-coupled pheromone receptor, strictly followed the “positive inside” rule for the first transmembrane span (8Harley C.A. Tipper D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24625-24633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The N terminus is translocated only if the charge difference is reversed by removal of all the N-terminal positive charges or addition of C-terminal negative charges. ER membrane does not support a transmembrane potential, suggesting that this preference may be due to charged residues interacting with phospholipids (9van Klompenburg W. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. de Kruijff B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4261-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In the case of signal-anchors, translocation of the N terminus can be blocked by the adoption of a fully folded conformation (10Denzer A.J. Nabholz C.E. Spiess M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6311-6317Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Prediction of topology can also be aided by analyzing the membrane span itself. Transmembrane spans up to 25 leucine residues increasingly favored a topology with the N terminus in the lumen as the polyleucine chain was lengthened (11Wahlberg J.M. Spiess M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The interaction between multiple topology determinants is difficult to predict (12Nilsson I. Witt S. Kiefer H. Mingarro I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6207-6213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and can result in a situation that omits otherwise natural membrane spans from the membrane (13Gafvelin G. Sakaguchi M. Andersson H. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6119-6127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Further insights into topology determination can be gained by studying unusual topologies. Oleosin proteins in plants adopt a unique membrane conformation in which a large membrane-integrated hydrophobic (H) domain is flanked by hydrophilic domains facing the cytosol (14Abell B.M. Holbrook L.A. Abenes M. Murphy D.J. Hills M.J. Moloney M.M. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1481-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) (depicted in Fig. 1 A). The H domain is unique in the size of its uninterrupted hydrophobicity (72 residues; see Fig. 1 B) and is predicted to reside completely within the phospholipid bilayer. Oleosins eventually accumulate on oil bodies within the cytosol of plant seed cells (15Huang A.H.C. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 16Napier J.A. Stobart A.K. Shewry P.R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 945-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and are anchored to oil bodies by their H domain (17Murphy D.J. Keen J.N. O'Sullivan J.N. Au D.M. Edwards E.W. Jackson P.J. Cummins I. Gibbons T. Shaw C.H. Ryan A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1088: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It is likely that membrane topology and the hydrophobicity of the H domain favors transition into a region of oil in the ER membrane from which oil body formation can occur (18Wanner G. Formanek H. Theimer R.R. Planta. 1981; 151: 109-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 19Lacey D. Hills M.J. Planta. 1996; 199: 545-551Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 20Lacey D.J. Beaudoin F. Dempsey C.E. Shewry P.R. Napier J.A. Plant J. 1999; 17: 397-405Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Oleosins are also used as carriers for recombinant protein production in seeds (21Parmenter D.L. Boothe J.G. van Rooijen G.J.H. Yeung E.C. Moloney M.M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 1167-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar,22van Rooijen G.J.H. Moloney M.M. Biotechnology. 1995; 13: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Thus, the topology of this protein has a significant impact on the potential uses of oleosin-based production systems. The H domain was originally predicted to be an antiparallel β-strand with a turn mediated by the central “proline knot” motif (PKM) (23Huang A.H.C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Molec. Biol. 1992; 43: 177-200Crossref Scopus (606) Google Scholar). However, recent experiments studying oleosins by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in the native oil body environment have indicated a predominance of α-helical structure (24Lacey D.L. Wellner N. Beaudoin F. Napier J.A. Shewry P.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 469-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The proline knot motif is required for oil body targeting, but not for ER membrane integration, suggesting that it is required for the ER-to-oil body transition (14Abell B.M. Holbrook L.A. Abenes M. Murphy D.J. Hills M.J. Moloney M.M. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1481-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The N-terminal (N) and C-terminal (C) domains possess significant amphipathic structure, which is expected to facilitate association with phospholipid surfaces (25Li M. Smith L.J. Clark D.C. Wilson R. Murphy D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8245-8253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Murphy D.J. Prog. Lipid Res. 1993; 32: 247-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Current evidence suggests that oleosin targets to the ER by an SRP-mediated pathway; oleosin mRNA is found in ER-bound polyribosomes (27Qu R. Wang S. Lin Y. Vance V.B. Huang A.H.C. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and exogenous SRP inhibits oleosin translationin vitro (28Thoyts P.J.E. Millichip M.I. Stobart A.K. Griffiths W.T. Shewry P.R. Napier J.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Oleosin expression in yeast mutants also indicates a requirement for SRP and Sec61 (29Beaudoin F. Wilkinson B.M. Stirling C. Napier J.A. Plant J. 2000; 23: 159-170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of the N or C domains indicated that the H domain was the only critical component for both ER and oil body targeting (14Abell B.M. Holbrook L.A. Abenes M. Murphy D.J. Hills M.J. Moloney M.M. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1481-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 30van Rooijen G.J.H. Moloney M.M. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 1353-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In this study, our primary goal was to understand how the unique ER topology is determined for the exceptionally large oleosin H domain. To achieve this, oleosin targeting and topology determinants were identified by a combination of mutagenesis, dissection of elements, and domain manipulation. The resulting topologies were characterized by protease-protection analysis in microsomal membranes. All constructs were assembled in pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene), with the exception of SRα, which was present in plasmid pSPSR19N, a generous gift from Dr. David Andrews (McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada). WTOLEO is the native coding region of an Arabidopsis oleosin cDNA cloned into pBluescript KS+ (14Abell B.M. Holbrook L.A. Abenes M. Murphy D.J. Hills M.J. Moloney M.M. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1481-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and was used as the basis for all other oleosin derivatives. All constructs produced by PCR or mutagenesis were verified by DNA sequencing. HOLEO was generated by PCR using primers OSS3a (5′-ATCATCACTAGTATGAAGTCTAGGCAGATTGCTAA-3′;SpeI site underlined) and CTA1 (5′-CCCCCTGCAGTTAGTAAATCCAAGAGAAAACGG-3′; PstI site underlined). NPCOLEO was provided by Dr. Steve Szarka (University of Calgary), amplified by PCR to encode oleosin residues 1–45, 73–88, 117–173 (Fig. 1), and inserted into pBluescript KS+ under control of the T3 promoter. S1OLEO and S2OLEO were created using primer OSS1 (5′-CCGGACGAGGATCTGACTACTCCGGATCCGGGCAGATTGCTGGAGCTGCAACTGCTGTCACAGCTGG-3′;BamHI site underlined) and OSS2 (5′-CCAAGTCTAGGCAGATTGCTAAATCTTCAACTAGTTCCACAGCTGGTGGTTCCCTCC-3′;SpeI site underlined), respectively, by the Kunkel method of site-directed mutagenesis (31Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar). β-glucuronidase was used in pGNOS (22van Rooijen G.J.H. Moloney M.M. Biotechnology. 1995; 13: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). OSS3 was generated from WTOLEO by PCR using primers OSS3a and OSS3b (5′-CTGCTCCATGGATGTTGCAACAGTCAAAGCTA-3′;NcoI site underlined) and then cloned at the 5′ end of GUS by fusion of the common NcoI sites to yield OSS3G. OSS4G was created similarly using primers OSS4a (5′-ATCATCACTAGTATGCCTCTGCTCGTTATCTTCAG-3′; SpeI site underlined) and OSS4b (5′-CTGCTCCATGGAGTAAATCCAAGAGAAAACGG-3′; NcoI site underlined). OSS6G used primers OSS3c (5′-ATCATCACTAGTATGGGATCTGGGCAGATTGCTGG-3′; SpeI site underlined) and OSS3b on template S1OLEO. OSS7G used primers OSS3a and OSS3b on template S2OLEO. B82WTOLEO was constructed by addition of a PCR fragment from bbe1 (berberine bridge enzyme) template (32Facchini P.J. Penzes C. Johnson A.G. Bull D. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 1669-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) using primers BSP5′ (5′-CCCCCCGGATCCTTGACGTACTTCTCCAACAA-3′; BamHI site underlined) and BSP3′ (5′-CCCCCCGGATCCCATTACAATAAACGACGGTT-3′; BamHI site underlined). The BamHI-BamHI fragment was cloned into the BamHI site immediately 5′ to the initiation codon of WTOLEO. The B82 fragment was present at the same position in all the other constructs containing the berberine bridge enzyme signal peptide. WTOLEO:C− is truncated after the H domain, and PVOLEO is mutated to substitute all three prolines in the proline knot motif with leucines (14Abell B.M. Holbrook L.A. Abenes M. Murphy D.J. Hills M.J. Moloney M.M. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1481-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). T1OLEO was generated by PCR using primers TOP1a (5′-TTCGCTCGAGTTCGTCGTAAATCCAAGAGAAAACGG-3′;XhoI site underlined) and TOP1b (5′-TTTCCTCGAGGGAGAGGAACCACAGGGATCAGACAAGTT-3′;XhoI site underlined). T2OLEO was created by deletion of H(C) from T1OLEO by inverse PCR with primers TOP2a (5′-ACTTGCTAGCCGGGACAAGGATTGGGC-3′; NheI site underlined) and TOP2b (5′-CCTTCATATGACGAACTCGAGGGAGAGGA-3′;NdeI site underlined) and then addition of a PCR fragment containing H(N), using primers TOP2c (5′-GAATGCTAGCGCTGCAACTGCTGTCACAGC-3′; NheI site underlined) and TOP2d (5′-CCGGCATATGTTGCAACAGTCAAAGCT-3′; NdeI site underlined). T3OLEO was generated from T1OLEO template lacking theSpeI site (cut with SpeI, endfilled with Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase, and then religated) to facilitate subsequent cloning steps.

Translation was performed using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega), labeling with 3H-leucine in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomes (Promega) as described previously by Abell et al. (14Abell B.M. Holbrook L.A. Abenes M. Murphy D.J. Hills M.J. Moloney M.M. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1481-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Microsomes were recovered by dilution of the translation mix to 100 μl with 10% sucrose and centrifuged at 213,000 × g in an ultracentrifuge (TL100, Beckman, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) using a TLA100.2 rotor for 20 min at 4 °C. Proteinase K treatments were performed by addition of the enzyme (50 μg ml−1) directly to translation reactions on ice for 30 min. For Triton X-100 controls, TX100 was added to 1% (w/v) prior to proteinase K addition. Proteinase K was inactivated by addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a concentration of 5 mm. Pelleted microsomes were resuspended in 20 μl of 100 mmNa2CO3 and incubated on ice for 15 min. Membrane-associated polypeptides were separated by repelleting as before but with no additional buffer. 3H-labeled polypeptides were solubilized in loading buffer and boiled for 3 min then separated by SDS-PAGE on a 16% acrylamide gel, according to Schagger et al. (33Schagger H. von Jagow G. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Google Scholar). Gels were fixed and visualized by fluorography using Amplify (Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Molecular masses were determined by comparison to prestained markers (Bio-Rad), which in turn were calibrated from a plot generated by Sigma 2.5–17-kDa and Pharmacia 14–94-kDa markers. In stage 1, translation was performed for 45 min, substituting microsomes, RNA, or both with an equivalent volume of water. The total volume of 17.5 μl allowed for further additions to complete a 20-μl reaction. The translation reaction was then incubated with 1.25 mmcycloheximide or puromycin on ice for 15 min. The posttranslation in stage 2 was incubated for 75 min with the addition of microsomes, RNA, or both to yield a final volume of 20 μl. The SRP receptor was disrupted by incubating microsomes with 5 μg ml−1 trypsin on ice for 60 min. The protease was inactivated by addition of 100 μg ml−1 soybean trypsin inhibitor and incubated on ice for a further 15 min. The microsomes were added to a translation reaction, with either SRα RNA, or water for the control. A full complement of amino acids was used instead of the normal radiolabeling mixture. The microsomes were recovered by pelleting, then resuspended in buffer (25 mm TEA-OAc, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25m sucrose). The resultant microsomes were used at the standard concentration for subsequent test translations. Microsomes were recovered after translation by pelleting. Each 10-μl translation was resuspended in 100 μl of buffer, pH 7.5 (85 mm K-Bicine, pH 11.0, 150 mm PIPES-Cl, pH 6.5), pH 11 (100 mm K-Bicine, pH 11.0), or pH 11.4 (100 mmNa2CO3). After a 30-min incubation on ice, samples to be protease-treated were supplemented with 50 μg ml−1 proteinase K, incubated on ice for a further 5 min, and then neutralized to pH 7.5 with 18 μl of 1 m PIPES-Cl pH 6.5. All samples were immediately pelleted and resuspended in loading buffer supplemented with 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Evidence to date suggests that oleosins are integrated into ER membranes co-translationally, following a SRP- and Sec61-dependent pathway (27Qu R. Wang S. Lin Y. Vance V.B. Huang A.H.C. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 28Thoyts P.J.E. Millichip M.I. Stobart A.K. Griffiths W.T. Shewry P.R. Napier J.A. Plant Mol.

To place oleosin topology in context, we needed to define the targeting pathway of oleosin into our experimental system of canine pancreatic membrane. Since we needed to differentiate between co- and posttranslational membrane integration, we experimentally separated the translation and membrane-insertion steps. Hence, microsomes were added after halting translation with either cycloheximide (inhibits chain extension) or puromycin (releases nascent polypeptide chains from the ribosomes). The ability of the translation machinery to withstand the preincubation was verified by providing a control sample with oleosin message at the postincubation stage. Proteinase K treatment ensured detection of true membrane-integrated fragments. Fig.2 A shows that oleosin was unable to associate significantly with microsomes posttranslationally when either cycloheximide (Fig. 2 A, lane 2) or puromycin (Fig. 2 A, lane 6) were used, as compared with cotranslational microsomal addition (Fig. 2 A,lanes 1 and 5) or postincubation without the addition of inhibitors (Fig. 2 A, lanes 4 and8). The ability of cycloheximide and puromycin to inhibit translation was confirmed (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3 and7). The low level of oleosin targeting after cycloheximide treatment (Fig. 2 A, lane 2) is probably due to ribosome-dependent posttranslational translocation. These results support a cotranslational pathway and lead to a more precise characterization of the ER targeting pathway. We next investigated whether oleosin uses a classical SRP-mediated targeting pathway by a sensitive assay that uses the ablation and reconstitution of the SRP receptor. SRP receptor α subunit (SRα) associates with ER-integrated SRβ to form the SRP receptor and is exposed on the outer membrane surface (35Andrews D.W. Lauffer L. Walter P. Lingappa V.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 797-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This renders SRα susceptible to a mild trypsin treatment, which does not significantly affect any other translocon components, but results in the loss of SRP-dependent targeting. Crucially, the SRP receptor can be reconstituted by the re-addition of small quantities of SRα translated in vitro due to its own SRP-independent route of ER targeting. This method of reconstitution can result in the recovery of up to 78% of translocation activity. β-lactamase was used as a convenient positive control for SRα dependence due to its cleavable signal sequence. Protease-protected fragments were analyzed as a reliable measure of membrane integration. Fig. 2 B shows that trypsin-treated microsomes retained their ability to bind radiolabeled SRα (major protected fragments of 10 kDa and 14k Da; Fig. 2 B, lane 1), but were unable to support significant translocation of oleosin or β-lactamase (Fig.2 B, lanes 3 and 5). However, pre-translation with SRα caused a significant increase in the ability of the trypsinized membranes to translocate both oleosin and β-lactamase (Fig. 2 B, lanes 4 and6). SRα incorporated less efficiently into reconstituted microsomes (Fig. 2 B, lane 2), presumably due to the reduction in the available SRβ partner to which it binds. These results demonstrate that oleosin can be targeted to the ER membrane by the SRP-dependent pathway, and by implication suggests that it uses the Sec61 translocon for its integration. The most important feature of an ER signal sequence is the hydrophobic core, h (36Martoglio B. Dobberstein B. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 410-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). This comprises typically between 5 and 15 residues in a cleavable signal sequence and ∼20 residues in a signal-anchor. It is possible to identify several putative h regions within the H domain of oleosin due to its overall hydrophobicity. Many signal sequences are preceded by positively charged residues (n region). Therefore, the region of oleosin chosen for investigation was the H domain and the preceding charged region in the N domain. First, the ability of the oleosin H domain to integrate independently was investigated. A segment beginning with the charged region preceding the H domain and ending before the C domain (denoted HOLEO) was isolated and translated in vitro. We found that HOLEO is associated with microsomes (Fig. 3 A,lane 1) and is protected from proteinase K (Fig.3 A, lane 3), indicating efficient membrane integration. The small size reduction of the polypeptide is probably due to access of the protease to the residual short portion of N domain. Clearly, the H domain is sufficient for membrane insertion, but it was still possible that the N or C domains could also contain ER targeting information. Therefore, a construct lacking the hydrophobic region was generated. This construct NPCOLEO, consists of the central proline knot motif flanked by N and C domains. Upon translation in vitro, NPCOLEO was mostly associated with microsomes (Fig. 3 A, lane 2), yet treatment with proteinase K results in almost complete loss of detectable fragments (Fig. 3 A, lane 4). The smaller product observed before protease treatment is likely to be the product of downstream initiation, as demonstrated previously for native oleosin (14Abell B.M. Holbrook L.A. Abenes M. Murphy D.J. Hills M.J. Moloney M.M. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1481-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This protease sensitivity demonstrates that although NPCOLEO binds to microsomal membranes, probably due to its charged and amphipathic nature, it is not integrated into the membrane. To refine the identification of oleosin ER targeting signal(s), individual portions of the H domain were isolated and analyzed for their targeting ability. OSS3 includes the N-terminal portion of the H domain (H(N)) and the preceding charged region in the N domain; OSS4 includes the C-terminal portion of the H domain (H(C)) and the preceding proline knot motif. Both segments were fused to β-glucuronidase (GUS) as a non-ER-targeted reporter for use in vitro (37Jefferson R.A. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1987; 5: 387-405Crossref Scopus (3992) Google Scholar). Membrane integration was tested by pelleting and by further carbonate extraction. Fig.4 A shows that OSS3G and OSS4G are both capable of significant microsomal association, compared with the non-targeted GUS (ntGUS), which does not associate with the membrane fraction (compare supernatant and pellet fractions). Similar experiments with β-lactamase and preprolactin show that the proportion of polypeptide targeted to membranes is comparable (data not shown), confirming a high efficiency of signal sequence activity for OSS3 and OSS4. Furthermore, carbonate extraction of the membrane pellets does not significantly affect membrane association of OSS3G and OSS4G, in contrast to a complete loss of ntGUS (lanes 11–13). The targeting activity of OSS3 and OSS4 provides evidence for the presence of at least two independent signal sequences present within the H domain. To pinpoint signal sequence information, OSS3G was modified by 1) substitution of charged residues to create OSS6G and 2) polarization of the N-terminal hydrophobic region to create OSS7G (S1 and S2 mutations respectively; see Fig. 1 B). When OSS6G and OSS7G are translated in vitro, they are"

Although all eukaryotic γ-GCS isoforms examined to date are rapidly inhibited by buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), most reports indicate that bacterial γ-GCS is resistant to BSO. We have confirmed the latter finding with Escherichia coliγ-GCS under standard assay conditions, showing both decreased initial binding affinity for BSO and a reduced rate of BSO-mediated inactivation compared with mammalian isoforms. We also find that substitution of Mn2+ for Mg2+ in assay mixtures increases both the initial binding affinity of BSO and the rate at which BSO causes mechanism-based inactivation. Similarly, the specificity of E. coli γ-GCS for its amino acid substrates is broadened in the presence of Mn2+, and the rate of reaction for some very poor substrates is improved. These results suggest that divalent metal ions have a role in amino acid binding to E. coli γ-GCS. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies carried out with Mn2+ show that E. coli γ-GCS binds two divalent metal ions;Kd values for Mn2+ are 1.1 μm and 82 μm, respectively. Binding ofl-glutamate or l-BSO to the two Mn2+/γ-GCS species produces additional upfield and downfield X-band EPR hyperfine lines at 45 G intervals, a result indicating that the two Mn2+ are spin-coupled and thus apparently separated by 5 Å or less in the active site. Additional EPR studies in which Cu2+ replaced Mg2+ or Mn2+ suggest that Cu2+ is bound by one N and three O ligands in the γ-GCS active site.

Glutathione is more narrowly distributed among bacteria (4Newton G.L. Fahey R.C. Viña J. Glutathione: Metabolism and Physiological Functions.

In all cases examined, γ-GCS is rate-limiting and is feedback-inhibited by GSH. In protozoa and mammals, potent inhibitors of γ-GCS such as buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) have been used to block GSH synthesis and promote GSH depletion (21Griffith O.W. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J.

Hayward M.L. Griffith O.W. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), to inhibit E. coli γ-GCS. In confirmation of most (18Romero M.J.M. Canada A.T. Toxicol. Appl.

A. 1988; 85: 2464-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), literature reports, we find that BSO is a relatively poor inhibitor of bacterial γ-GCS, particularly in the presence of physiological levels of l-glutamate. We have therefore investigated the interactions of E. coli γ-GCS with l-S-BSO and with its amino acid substrates and various substrate analogs in an effort to elucidate binding interactions that might be exploited in designing novel, more potent inhibitors. We find that substrate specificity depends on the divalent metal ion present (i.e. Mg2+ or Mn2+), a result suggesting that metal ions have a role in the binding of amino acid substrates and inhibitors in addition to their expected role in ATP binding. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies carried out with Mn2+ show that E. coli γ-GCS contains two active site divalent metal ions. Binding of l-glutamate or l-S-BSO induces additional 45 G coupling within the EPR spectra indicative of Mn2+-Mn2+ coupling through spin exchange. These results are discussed in terms of the mechanism of action of E. coli γ-GCS.DISCUSSIONγ-Glutamylcysteine synthetase has been identified in a wide range of organisms including bacteria, protozoa, fungi, plants, insects, and mammals. Cloning studies show a moderate to high degree of amino acid sequence homology among the mammalian, insect, yeast, and protozoal γ-GCS isoforms, but little homology between those enzymes and the γ-GCS of either plants or bacteria (1Griffith O.W. Mulcahy R.T. Adv. Enzymol. Rel. Areas Mol. Biol. 1999; 73: 209-267PubMed Google Scholar). Notwithstanding these differences and additional marked differences in quaternary structure, all γ-GCS, including those of plants and bacteria, are presumed to catalyze a two-step ligase reaction mechanistically similar to that established for rat γ-GCS (Equations 3 and 4). Supporting that view, most γ-GCS isoforms are reported to be strongly inhibited by BSO, a mechanism-based inhibitor that initially binds as an analog of the tetrahedral intermediate formed whenl-γ-glutamylphosphate and l-α-aminobutyrate react in the second step of the normal γ-GCS reaction (1Griffith O.W. Mulcahy R.T. Adv. Enzymol. Rel. Areas Mol. Biol. 1999; 73: 209-267PubMed Google Scholar, 26Campbell E.B. Hayward M.L. Griffith O.W. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 38Griffith O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13704-13712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Once bound, l-S-BSO is phosphorylated on its sulfoximine N in a reaction that mimics phosphorylation of the γ-carboxylate of l-glutamate in the first step of the normal γ-GCS reaction. Studies with rat γ-GCS show that phosphorylated l-S-BSO is tightly bound to the active site, causing essentially irreversible inhibition (26Campbell E.B. Hayward M.L. Griffith O.W. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 38Griffith O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13704-13712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mechanism-based inhibition by l-S-BSO thus mimics key aspects of both the first and second steps of the γ-GCS reaction, and irreversible inhibition by BSO is therefore good evidence for mechanistic similarity between any γ-GCS isoform inhibited by BSO and the well characterized rat γ-GCS.L­glutamate+MgATP→L­γ­glutamylphosphate+MgADPEquation 3 L=γ­glutamylphosphate+L­α­aminobutyrate→Equation 4 L­γ­glutamyl­L­α­aminobutyrate+PiIt was in this context that we were interested in the possible discrepancy between a report that BSO inhibits E. coliγ-GCS comparably to rat γ-GCS (27Huang C.S. Moore W.R. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2464-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and other reports showing that exposure of intact E. coli to BSO does not cause inhibition of GSH synthesis or GSH depletion (18Romero M.J.M. Canada A.T. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1991; 111: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, we find that l-S-BSO can fully inhibit E. coli γ-GCS, but, at all concentrations tested, the rate of inactivation is much slower than is seen with human (this work) or rat (38Griffith O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13704-13712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) γ-GCS. Weaker initial binding and a slower rate of sulfoximine phosphorylation both contribute to the slower rate of inactivation. Thus, l-S-BSO binds to E. coliγ-GCS with a Kd value of 66 μmwhereas human γ-GCS is inhibited so rapidly by 5 μm and higher concentrations of l-S-BSO that meaningfulKd values could not be determined. In earlier studies with rat γ-GCS, it was estimated that the active diastereomer of BSO had an apparent Kd of 25 μm in the presence of 5 mm l-glutamate, a ligand which competes with the sulfoximine for initial binding (38Griffith O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13704-13712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Those studies suggest that in the absence of l-glutamate the actual Kd for l-S-BSO would be <8 μm, but rapid kinetic studies are necessary to make an accurate determination.Once bound to E. coli γ-GCS,l-S-BSO reacts relatively slowly with ATP to form the tightly bound phosphorylated derivative. We findkinact = 0.30 min−1(t½ ∼2.3 min) for E. coli γ-GCS, a value which is <8% of the kinact determined earlier for rat γ-GCS in the presence of l-glutamate (kinact = 3.9 min−1;t½ ∼11 s) (38Griffith O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13704-13712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whether weak binding and slow phosphorylation of l-S-BSO account for its inability to deplete E. coli of GSH requires additional studies. In preliminary experiments, we have confirmed an earlier report that BSO is taken up by E. coli(27Huang C.S. Moore W.R. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2464-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), 3M.A. Hayward and O.W. Griffith, unpublished data. but the intracellular concentration of l-S-BSO relative tol-glutamate and the rate at which E. coliconsume or release GSH have not yet been determined.ATP-dependent ligases such as γ-GCS require a divalent metal ion, typically Mg2+, to help bind and orientate the triphosphate portion of the nucleotide in the active site. Such ions may also help to orientate and deprotonate the substrate nucleophile to which phosphoryl transfer will occur (39Walsh C. Enzymatic Reaction Mechanisms. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1979: 88-89Google Scholar, 45Reed G.H Markham G.D. Berliner L.T. Reuben J. Biological Magnetic Resonance. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1984: 73-142Crossref Google Scholar). Although it was earlier reported that E. coli γ-GCS is not active with Mn2+, Co2+, Ca2+, or Zn2+ (29Watanabe K. Murata K. Kimura A. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1986; 50: 1925-1930Google Scholar), we find that highly purified enzyme has substantial activity with Mn2+, Co2+, Cd2+, and Fe2+. Interestingly,Km values for l-glutamate and glutamate analogs are markedly reduced in the presence of Mn2+, suggesting that the divalent metal plays a role inl-glutamate binding. This finding is consistent with the general observation that Mn2+ improves ligand binding over that seen with Mg2+ (47Irving H. Williams R.J.P. J. Chem. Soc. 1953; : 3192-3210Crossref Scopus (1750) Google Scholar). Reaction velocities for most glutamate analogs are reduced in the presence of Mn2+, but the decrease in Vmax is less for the analogs than for l-glutamate itself. α-Methyl-l-glutamate, which shows very poor activity with Mg2+, actually has a higher Vmaxwith Mn2+ than Mg2+.Substitution of Mn2+ for Mg2+ also decreases the Km for l-cysteine and most of its analogs, suggesting that metal ions might also have a role inl-cysteine binding. We do note, however, that the decrease in the Km for l-cysteine itself is small relative to the changes seen for l-glutamate and its analogs. For analogs having >5% the activity ofl-cysteine, Vmax values were uniformly higher with Mg2+ than Mn2+, but for very poorly reactive substrates, Vmax values were higher with Mn2+. The latter observation is of interest because we find that kinact forl-S-BSO is higher in the presence of Mn2+. It was earlier proposed that the S-butyl moiety of l-S-BSO occupies thel-cysteine binding site of γ-GCS (38Griffith O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13704-13712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and our results are thus consistent with the view that l-S-BSO reacts as a poor γ-GCS substrate that is phosphorylated relatively slowly.E. coli glutamine synthetase has no overall amino acid sequence homology with either E. coli or mammalian γ-GCS, but it catalyzes a mechanistically similar reaction in whichl-glutamate is first phosphorylated by ATP and the resulting γ-glutamylphosphate is then attacked by ammonia to form glutamine (in addition to ADP and Pi) (48Meister A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).2 The enzyme is irreversibly inhibited by thel-S-diastereomer of methionine sulfoximine (49Manning J.M. Moore S. Rowe W.B. Meister A. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 2681-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), which is the same diastereomer of methionine sulfoximine that potently inhibits rat γ-GCS (50Richman P.G. Orlowski M. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6684-6690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Correspondingly, rat (26Campbell E.B. Hayward M.L. Griffith O.W. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), human (this work), and E. coli γ-GCS (this work) are all inhibited byl-S-BSO, suggesting that the relative orientation of substrates is similar in the active sites of glutamine synthetase and mammalian and E. coli γ-GCS.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 675-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 58Gill H.S. Pfluegl G.M.U. Rotstein S.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 122-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), have established that each glutamine synthetase active site binds two divalent metal ions. Consistent with the similarity of chemical mechanism and active site geometry between glutamine synthetase and γ-GCS, our EPR results with Mn2+ indicate that E. coli γ-GCS also binds two divalent metal ions per active site. The γ-GCS Kd values for Mn2+, 1.1 μm and 82 μm, are similar to the Mn2+Kd values of 1.9 μm and 200 μm reported for glutamine synthetase (59Hunt J.B. Ginsburg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 590-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, titration of glutamine synthetase with Mn2+ causes a decrease in EPR signal amplitude from one Mn2+ to two Mn2+ bound (54Gibbs E.J. Ransom S.C. Cuppett S. Villafranca J.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) that is very similar to that seen with γ-GCS in the presence ofl-glutamate or l-S-BSO (Fig.5). 4It should be noted that glutamine synthetase was titrated at 1 °C and Mn2+ binding was determined from the peak to peak height of the low field line of the 6-line Q-band EPR spectrum; no resolution of the 45 G coupling was observed (54Gibbs E.J. Ransom S.C. Cuppett S. Villafranca J.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In contrast, our titration of γ-GCS was followed by X-band EPR at 77 K. This approach allowed us to observe the 45 G spin exchange coupling in addition to the decrease in signal amplitude of the low field line of the characteristic 6-line Mn2+ spectrum on going from one to two Mn2+ equivalents bound. However, collection of data at 77 K also raised the possibility that ice crystals that were formed in freezing the samples excluded and therefore concentrated the solutes (see Ref. 60Ross R.T. J. Chem. Phys. 1965; 42: 3919-3924Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar for discussion). Such problems were minimized or avoided by working at high protein concentrations (e.g. ∼35 mg/ml in our studies) or by inclusion of solvents that interfere with solvent-solute segregation (e.g. 25% glycerol in our studies). More specifically, the decrease in peak to peak signal amplitude observed with γ-GCS is attributed to conversion of the strong signal with a 90 G coupling to a weaker signal with a 45 G coupling (Figure 5). In the case of glutamine synthetase, the decrease in signal amplitude of the line with 90 G coupling was interpreted using Leigh theory, which is based on relaxation effects wherein one paramagnet relaxes much faster than the paramagnet under observation. This is not the situation with γ-GCS and may not have been the situation with glutamine synthetase. Note that application of Leigh theory in glutamine synthetase predicted a Mn2+-Mn2+ distance of ∼10 Å (52Balakrishan M.S. Villafranca J.J. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3531-3538Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 53Villafranca J.J. Ransom S.C. Gibbs E.J. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1985; 26: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 54Gibbs E.J. Ransom S.C. Cuppett S. Villafranca J.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) whereas the crystal structure shows a distance of 4.5 Å (57Liaw S-H. Eisenberg D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 675-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Interpretation of our γ-GCS results is thus based in part on previous findings with glutamine synthetase.In E. coli glutamine synthetase the more tightly bound Mn2+, n1, is located near the γ-carboxylate of substrate l-glutamate; one of the substrate's carboxylate O atoms and O atoms from three enzymatic glutamate residues serve as ligands. The second Mn2+, n2, is located adjacent to the γ-phosphate of ATP. Its ligands include a γ-phosphoryl O and the β-γ bridging O of ATP, the N of an enzymatic histidine residue, and O atoms from two enzymatic glutamate residues. Although our current results do not allow us to unambiguously assign the first or second bound metal ions to the site nearer substrate glutamate or ATP in γ-GCS, our working hypothesis is that a similar arrangement exists in the E. coli γ-GCS active site. In support of that view, our studies with the mono Cu2+-γ-GCS complex show that in the absence of substrates or inhibitor Cu2+ has one N ligand, presumably an enzymatic histidine residue. The Cu2+ ion acquires a second N ligand in the presence of l-S-BSO (Fig. 6), and we suggest that the additional ligand may be the sulfoximine N of boundl-S-BSO2. We do note that Scatchard analyses show l-glutamate andl-S-BSO affect the Kd values of n2 more than n1 (Fig. 3), a finding that might argue for a different assignment of n1 and n2. However, l-glutamate binding reportedly increases the Kd of both n1 and n2 in glutamine synthetase by 20-fold (59Hunt J.B. Ginsburg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 590-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a major effect on n2 thus does not rule out the interpretation thatl-glutamate and l-S-BSO bind nearer n1 in γ-GCS. Binding of ATP apparently increases the rhombicity of both the n1 and n2 sites since addition of ATP was found to suppress the low amplitude EPR signal of the mono Mn2+-γ-GCS complex (not shown) and the stronger signal of the di-Mn2+-γ-GCS complex (Fig. 4).Crystallographic studies establish that the metal ions of E. coli glutamine synthetase are separated by 4.5 Å and that substrate binding does not significantly perturb that distance (57Liaw S-H. Eisenberg D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 675-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Observation of a 45 G coupling for hyperfine lines in the di-Mn2+-γ-GCS complex EPR spectra in the presence ofl-glutamate or l-S-BSO (Fig. 4) and titration data showing suppression of the EPR signal between 1 and 2 Mn2+ bound (Fig. 5) indicate that the Mn2+ ions bound to E. coli γ-GCS form a binuclear Mn2+-Mn2+ site in the presence of those ligands (45Reed G.H Markham G.D. Berliner L.T. Reuben J. Biological Magnetic Resonance. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1984: 73-142Crossref Google Scholar). 5There is also a 6-line signal tentatively attributed to mononuclear Mn2+ bound to non-specific sites on the enzyme, possibly due to freezing of the sample. That signal is superimposed on the signal attributed to the binuclear Mn2+-Mn2+ site throughout the titration with Mn2+ and dominates the EPR spectra at Mn2+/γ-GCS protomer ratios >2 (not shown). Furthermore, observation of the 45 G coupling suggests that the Mn2+ions are separated by 5 Å or less (45Reed G.H Markham G.D. Berliner L.T. Reuben J. Biological Magnetic Resonance. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1984: 73-142Crossref Google Scholar). Although in the studies reported here 45 G hyperfine lines were not observed in the absence of amino acid ligands, preliminary studies at low temperature suggest a Mn2+-Mn2+ interaction may also occur in the absence of additional ligands. 6B. S. Kelly, W. E. Antholine, and O.W. Griffith, unpublished data. Further studies are necessary to accurately determine the Mn2+-Mn2+distance and to fully identify the enzymatic and substrate ligands of each metal ion. Glutathione (GSH, γ-glutamylcysteinylglycine) is present in the cells of virtually all eukaryotes ranging from protozoa to plants and mammals, and its physiological role as an enzyme cofactor, antioxidant, and sacrificial nucleophile able to detoxify reactive electrophiles is well established in those systems (1Griffith O.W.

Glutathione is more narrowly distributed among bacteria (4Newton G.L. Fahey R.C. Viña J. Glutathione: Metabolism and Physiological Functions. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 69-77Google Scholar), and its function in bacteria is less well defined.

In initial reports, it was proposed that certain channels from the ClC family of chloride channels may provide compensatory or alternative pathways for epithelial chloride secretion in tissues from cystic fibrosis patients. In the present work, we provide the first evidence that ClC-4 protein is functionally expressed on the surface of the intestinal epithelium and hence, is appropriately localized to act as a therapeutic target in this CF-affected tissue. We show using confocal and electron microscopy that ClC-4 co-localizes with CFTR in the brush border membrane of the epithelium lining intestinal crypts in mouse and human tissues. In Caco-2 cells, a cell line thought to model human enterocytes, ClC-4 protein is expressed on the cell surface and also partially co-localizes with EEA1 and transferrin, marker molecules of early and recycling endosomes, respectively. Hence, like CFTR, ClC-4 may cycle between the plasma membrane and endosomal compartment. Furthermore, we show that ClC-4 functions as a chloride channel on the surface of these epithelial cells as antisense ClC-4 cDNA expression reduced the amplitude of endogenous chloride currents by 50%. These studies provide the first evidence that ClC-4 is endogenously expressed and may be functional in the brush border membrane of enterocytes and hence should be considered as a candidate channel to provide an alternative pathway for chloride secretion in the gastrointestinal tract of CF patients.

Welsh M.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S23-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Normally, the protein product of the CF gene, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) resides on the apical surface of these epithelia. However, the most common disease causing mutation in CFTR (i.e. CFTRΔF508) promotes misfolding, leading to its mislocalization and degradation in intracellular compartments (2Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E. Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). Alternatively, other mutations lead to alterations in CFTR function as a phosphorylation and nucleotide-regulated anion channel (3Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 1251-1254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar). The anion channel function of CFTR is thought to provide the primary driving force for fluid transport and clearance of mucus and bacteria and lack of this function is the major cause for mucus obstruction in CF-affected organs. As proposed initially by Clarkeet al. (4Clarke L.L. Grubb B.R. Yankaskas J.R. Cotton C.U. McKenzie A. Boucher R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), non-CFTR chloride channels could compensate for lack of CFTR in certain tissues if they were appropriately localized on the apical, brush border membrane of the epithelium and could be opened under physiological conditions. In fact, we recently reported that increased basal chloride secretion correlates with amelioration of disease severity in intestinal tissues of a subpopulation ofCftr-deficient mice (5Gyomorey K. Rozmahel R. Bear C.E. Pediatr. Res. 2000; 48: 731-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Therefore, there is a compelling rationale for studying the expression of other chloride channels that may mediate chloride secretion across the gastrointestinal epithelium as these proteins may provide a strategic therapeutic target for treatment of cystic fibrosis. There are nine mammalian members of the superfamily of voltage-gated ClC channels (6Jentsch T.J. Friedrich T. Schriever A. Yamada H. Pflugers Arch. 1999; 437: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). ClC-1, ClC-2, ClCKa, and ClCKb are closely related, ClC-3, ClC-4, and ClC-5 form another arm of the family and finally, ClC-6 and ClC-7 comprise a distinct branch. Some of these family members exhibit quite a restricted tissue expression and hence are unlikely to contribute to chloride transport across the epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract, i.e. ClC-1 is only expressed in muscle tissue and ClCKa and ClCKb are expressed exclusively in the kidney (7Waldegger S. Jentsch T.J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 1331-1339PubMed Google Scholar, 8Uchida S. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2000; 279: F802-808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kieferle S. Fong P. Bens M.

On the other hand, ClC-2, ClC-3, ClC-4, ClC-5, ClC-6, and ClC-7 are relatively widely distributed. However, most of these family members, with the exception of ClC-2 and possibly ClC-3, are thought to be primarily expressed on intracellular membranes (6Jentsch T.J. Friedrich T. Schriever A. Yamada H. Pflugers Arch. 1999; 437: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 10Vandewalle A. Cluzeaud F. Peng K.C. Bens M. Luchow A. Gunther W. Jentsch T.J. Am. J. Physiol.

We have recently reported that ClC-2 is endogenously expressed at a unique location in intestinal epithelia, in proximity to the tight junctions at the apical boundary between interacting differentiated enterocytes (12Gyomorey K. Yeger H. Ackerley C. Garami E. Bear C.E. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 279: C1787-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Mohammad-Panah R. Gyomorey K. Rommens J. Choudhury M. Li C. Wang Y. Bear C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8306-8313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we showed using an antisense strategy that endogenous ClC-2 channels in intestinal epithelial cells can mediate chloride flux. Hence, we proposed that ClC-2 contributes to chloride secretion across certain epithelia. These findings were substantiated in a recent report describing Clc-2 knockout mice, in which the chloride current across the retinal pigment epithelium was decreased in the Clc-2 knockout animals (14Bosl M.R. Stein V. Hubner C. Zdebik A.A. Jordt S.E. Mukhopadhyay A.K. Davidoff M.S. Holstein A.F. Jentsch T.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1289-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). However, as the authors suggest, the impact of disrupting ClC-2 in intestinal tissue may only be apparent in Cftr-null animals. At present, the localization and physiological role of ClC-3 remains controversial as some studies suggest that ClC-3 functions in intracellular vesicles (6Jentsch T.J. Friedrich T. Schriever A.

Mutations in ClCN5 are associated with Dent's disease in humans, a kidney disease characterized by proteinuria and hypercalcuria (6Jentsch T.J. Friedrich T. Schriever A. Yamada H.

Recently, examination of the native expression of ClC-5 in differentiated epithelial tissues revealed that this channel resides predominantly in intracellular membranes. In fact Clc-5 knockout mice predominantly show a defect in endocytosis of protein from lumen of the renal proximal tubule (11Wang S.S. Devuyst O. Courtoy P.J. Wang X.T. Wang H. Wang Y. Thakker R.V. Guggino S. Guggino W.B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2937-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Similarily, Vandewalleet al. (10Vandewalle A. Cluzeaud F. Peng K.C. Bens M. Luchow A. Gunther W. Jentsch T.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 280: C373-381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that ClC-5 protein localizes in intracellular compartments, i.e. endosomes and Golgi in the rat intestinal mucosa. Hence, in light of these immunohistochemical studies of native tissue, it seems unlikely that ClC-5 will contribute significantly to chloride currents across the apical membrane of the intestinal epithelium. ClC-4 message is known to be expressed in brain, skeletal muscle, heart, kidney (21Jentsch T.J. Gunther W. Pusch M. Schwappach B. J.

Bear C. Pflugers Arch. 2001; 443: S103-S106Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), however, the subcellular distribution and function of ClC-4 protein in these tissues has yet to be determined. In our present work, we provide the first evidence that ClC-4 is endogenously expressed in the apical plasma membrane of murine and human enterocytes. Furthermore, we show using an antisense strategy, that endogenous ClC-4 protein mediates chloride currents across the plasma membrane of Caco-2 cells, cells that model human enterocytes. From the prospective of our current knowledge about the ClC family of chloride channels, these findings were unexpected. It was predicted that the subcellular distribution of ClC-4 would be similar to that of the related channel proteins, ClC-5 and ClC-3, and reside primarily in the membranes of intracellular organelles. To our knowledge, ClC-4 is the first chloride channel protein shown to co-localize with CFTR on the brush border membrane of intestinal crypt epithelial cells endogenously where it could mediate chloride currents into the gut lumen. Hence, these data strongly support a role for ClC-4 in intestinal chloride secretion and suggest that it may be capable of functionally complementing CFTR in vivo. Caco-2 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). They were grown in Earl's α-minimum essential medium (Wisent Inc., Montreal, Canada) containing 10% fetal calf serum, with 2 mm glutamine, 100 units of penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. For patch clamp studies, cells were used 1–2 days after plating onto 35-mm coverslips (Fisher). For analysis of ClC-4 localization in fully differentiated epithelia, Caco-2 cells were seeded on semipermeable filters (Corning Costar) and grown for 4 days past confluency, conditions previously reported to induced a differentiated monolayer (25Sood R. Bear C. Auerbach W. Reyes E. Jensen T. Kartner N. Riordan J.R. Buchwald M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2487-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Caco-2 cell cultures at 40% confluency (undifferentiated cells) were transfected with antisense ClC-4 cDNA or vector control using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) and the recommended transfection protocol was followed as previously described (13Mohammad-Panah R. Gyomorey K. Rommens J. Choudhury M. Li C. Wang Y. Bear C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8306-8313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Tissues were obtained from adult male rats (Wistar) fed a standard diet. Fragments (0.5 cm long) of ileum were removed, rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept at −80 °C until used. Portions of a small human bowel biopsy deemed normal by a pathologist were used for electron microscopic studies. Expression of ClC-4 protein in mouse tissues and Caco-2 cells was determined by immunoblotting as described in our previous papers (12Gyomorey K. Yeger H. Ackerley C. Garami E. Bear C.E. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 279: C1787-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Mohammad-Panah R. Gyomorey K. Rommens J. Choudhury M. Li C. Wang Y. Bear C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8306-8313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In brief, tissues from mouse were homogenized and then centrifuged at 2,000 × g to pellet the nuclei. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 ×g to yield a membrane pellet. Caco-2 cells were homogenized and centrifuged at 80,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to isolate a crude membrane preparation. 50 μg of each preparation was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (8% gel) using anti-ClC-4 antibody at a concentration of 11.8 μg/ml. This polyclonal antibody was generated against a GST fusion peptide containing amino acids (1–52) of mouse ClC-4 (ClC-4 cDNA obtained from E. Rugarli, Milano, Italy). The antiserum was pre-adsorbed to a GST-coupled matrix to remove anti-GST antibodies. For the competition studies, the anti-ClC-4 antibody was preincubated with a 4.8-fold excess of the antigenic fusion peptide containing peptide from ClC-4, or a GST fusion protein containing residues 1–52 of hClC-5 overnight at 4 °C before incubation (hClC-5 cDNA kindly provided by T. Jentsch, Hamburg, Germany). Immunoreactive protein was detected using the ECL system (Amersham Bioscience, Inc.). Total RNA was isolated from Caco-2 cell monolayers by dissolution in guanidinium isothiocyanate and centrifugation through a CsCl cushion (26MacDonald R.J. Swift G.H. Przybyla A.E. Chirgwin J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Total RNA (5 μg) was analyzed on agarose gels (1%) containing 0.6m formaldehyde and transferred to Hybond-N membranes (Amersham Bioscience Inc.). Blots were cross-linked with UV radiation and hybridized with mouse-specific ClC-4 cDNA fragments radiolabeled by random priming (27Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16651) Google Scholar). Final conditions of washing included 0.2 × SSC (sodium chloride/sodium citrate) with 0.1% SDS at 60 °C. The blots were exposed to X-Omat film (Kodak) for 24–72 h at 0.1% SDS at 70 °C with on intensifying screen. Expression of ClC-4 was analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR, using the primers with following sequences: human ClC-4, sense (5′-TCCTCGATGAGCCGTTCCCTGATGT-3′) and antisense (5′-AGGATGTACATTAAGTAATTCAGA-3′), producing a PCR product of 402 bp. The sequence identity of the PCR products was confirmed by BLAST sequence data base search. The antisense murine ClC-4 was generated by cloning the ClC-4 open reading frame withBamHI (5′) and EcoRI (3′) into the eukaryotic vector pCDNA 3.1(−) (Promega, Madison, WI) such that the reversed restriction sites on this vector would reverse the orientation of the open reading frame to create the antisense plasmid. The murine ClC-4 sequence shares 87% sequence identity with the human sequence. Caco-2 cells were washed with PBS (phosphate-buffered saline), fixed with paraformaldehyde AM (4% in PBS), and permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS. Blocking was done by using 5% normal goat serum in PBS for 1 h prior to primary antibody incubation. Primary antibodies were dissolved in blocking solution as follows. Mouse anti-endosomal early antigen 1 (1:200, Transduction Laboratories), mouse anti-giantin (1/1000, kind gift of H. P. Hauri, Basel, Switzerland), rabbit anti-ClC-3 (1/10, Alomone Labs Ltd., Jerusalem, Israel), rabbit anti-ClC-5 (1:150, kind gift of T. Jentsch, Hamburg, Germany), and rabbit anti-ClC-4 antibody (1/200). The cells were then incubated for 2.5 h at room temperature in primary antibody and then rinsed in PBS and incubated with Cy3-conjugated or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:1000, Molecular Probes) and washed again before mounting. For double labeling experiments, two primary antibodies developed in different species were applied together, followed by the simultaneous detection using Cy3 and fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled secondary antibodies. In some experiments we loaded Caco-2 cells for 1 h at 37 °C with 50 μg/ml transferrin conjugated to iron and tetramethylrhodamine (transferrin-Fe2+-Rhd, Molecular Probes) diluted in Earl's α-minimum essential medium without serum. Following fixation, cells we labeled with the ClC-4 antibody. For immunofluorescence labeling of rat tissues, cryosections (5 μm thick) of intestine were fixed in ice-cold methanol for 10 min prior to blocking. Samples were then processed for fluorescence as above. Slides were viewed with a ×63 objective on a Carl Zeiss LSM 510 equipped with an Axiovert 100 confocal microscopy. Portions of small bowel from a normal human biopsy, ileum from mice, and Caco-2 cells grown on semi-permeable filters were collected and prepared for freeze substitution and Lowicryl HM20 embedding (28Haagsman H.P. Elfring R.H. van Buel B.L. Voorhout W.F. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The sections were incubated with the ClC-4 antibody diluted 1:100 in PBS, 0.5% bovine serum albumin. Sections were then labeled as previously described (12Gyomorey K. Yeger H. Ackerley C. Garami E. Bear C.E. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 279: C1787-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Controls included the omission of either the primary or secondary antibody or a peptide competition. In double labeling experiments, sections of human small bowel were first labeled with the ClC-4 antibody and then with a monoclonal antibody against the R-domain of CFTR (1/100, R&D, Minneapolis, MN). Following ClC-4 labeling the sections were incubated for an hour in the CFTR antibody diluted 1:10 with PBS/bovine serum albumin. The sections were then labeled with goat anti-mouse IgG 5 nm complex, washed thoroughly with distilled water, and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate prior to examination in a JEOL JEM 1230 transmission electron microscope (JEOL USA Inc., Peabody, MA). Images were acquired with an AMT CCD digital camera (AMT Corp., Danvers, MA). Caco-2 cells were microinjected with plasmids at day 1 after plating on glass coverslips for patch clamp experiments as described (13Mohammad-Panah R. Gyomorey K. Rommens J. Choudhury M. Li C. Wang Y. Bear C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8306-8313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Plasmids were diluted to a final concentration of 300 μg/ml for antisense ClC-4 and antisense ClC-2. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextran (0.5%, Sigma) was also added to the injection medium to identify successfully microinjected cells. Caco-2 cell membrane currents were measured using conventional whole cell patch clamp technique as described (13Mohammad-Panah R. Gyomorey K. Rommens J. Choudhury M. Li C. Wang Y. Bear C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8306-8313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Data were collected and analyzed with an Axopatch-200A amplifier and pCLAMP software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). The bath solution contained (in mm): 140N-methyl-d-glutamine chloride, 2 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 5 HEPES, while the pipette solution contained (in mm) 140N-methyl-d-glutamine chloride, 2 MgCl2, 2 EGTA, and 5 HEPES. Both pipette and bath solutions were adjusted to pH 7.4. The tip resistance was 3–5 MΩ when filled with the pipette solution. Patch clamp measurements are presented as the mean ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed using the Student's t test. Probabilities (p) of 0.05 or less were considered statistically significant. To assess ClC-4 protein expression, we raised a polyclonal antibody against a GST fusion protein containing residues 1–52 of the amino terminus of mouse ClC-4. As expected, given the abundant ClC-4 message expression in the rodent brain (22Adler D.A. Rugarli E.I. Lingenfelter P.A. Tsuchiya K. Poslinski D. Liggitt H.D. Chapman V.M. Elliott R.W. Ballabio A. Disteche C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9244-9248Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), our antibody recognized a broad, prominent signal in immunoblots of mouse brain lysate (Fig.1i, A). The predominant band corresponds to a protein of ∼90 kDa in molecular mass, close to the ClC-4 mass predicted from the primary sequence of 83 kDa. This signal is specific for ClC-4 as it is competed by the fusion peptide of the amino terminus of ClC-4 (residues 1–52) but not a fusion protein containing the amino terminus (residues 1–52) of the closely related channel protein, ClC-5 (Fig. 1i, B). Using this polyclonal antibody, we detected a prominent 97-kDa band in immunoblots of mouse ileum suggesting that ClC-4 protein is also endogenously expressed in intestinal tissue (Fig. 1ii). ClC-4 mRNA and protein could also be detected in the human intestinal epithelial cell line, Caco-2. ClC-4 mRNA in Caco-2 cells was detected as a 4.7-kb transcript by Northern analysis, using a mouse ClC-4 specific probe (Fig. 1iii, A). A smaller, as yet unidentified, transcript of less than 1.9 kb was also detected in Caco-2 cells. ClC-4 mRNA expression in Caco-2 cells was confirmed using RT-PCR analysis with sequence specific primers to human ClC-4 (Fig. 1iii, B). ClC-4 protein expression in Caco-2 cells was detected by immunoblotting using the polyclonal antibody described above. As in the immunoblots of mouse intestine, ClC-4 protein was detected as a predominant 97-kDa protein in Caco-2 cells, confirming that ClC-4 is also expressed in human intestinal epithelial cells (Fig. 1iii, C). The distribution of ClC-5 protein in rat intestinal tissue has been previously described by Vandewalle et al. (10Vandewalle A. Cluzeaud F. Peng K.C. Bens M. Luchow A. Gunther W. Jentsch T.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 280: C373-381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using a ClC-5-specific polyclonal antibody originally characterized by Gunther et al. (29Gunther W. Luchow A. Cluzeaud F. Vandewalle A. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8075-8080Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). We also observed that ClC-5 specific staining was primarily perinuclear in cross-sections of intestinal crypts, showing a Golgi-like pattern of distribution (Fig. 2i,A). ClC-5 specific signal also appeared to be localized close to the luminal membrane of the intestinal crypt. It was previously reported that this juxtaluminal membrane distribution of ClC-5 may be localized in early endosomes (10Vandewalle A. Cluzeaud F. Peng K.C. Bens M. Luchow A. Gunther W. Jentsch T.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 280: C373-381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we processed cryosections of rat ileum for double immunofluorescence labeling using the polyclonal ClC-5 antibody and a monoclonal antibody against EEA1, one of the most specific early endosomal markers (30Wilson J.M. de Hoop M. Zorzi N. Toh B.H. Dotti C.G. Parton R.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2657-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2i, A, middle, green). The immunolabeled ClC-5 protein appeared to co-localize with immunolabeled EEA1 protein in a distinct ring around the apical membrane (Fig. 2i, A, right, yellow). These results provide a benchmark for our comparative studies of ClC-4 distribution in this tissue. Overall, the pattern observed for ClC-4-specific staining of the intestinal mucosa is different from that observed for ClC-5. Cross-sections of intestinal crypts were most intensely labeled around the luminal membrane of the gland suggesting the presence of ClC-4 in the apical membrane and/or subapical membrane compartment (Fig.2i, B, left, red). The apical or luminal membrane of the crypt can be readily discerned by differential interference contrast microscopy (Fig. 2i, B, middle and right). To determine if ClC-4 protein is located in early endosomes, we performed a double labeling experiment, wherein, intestinal sections were labeled with both our ClC-4 antibody and the EEA1 monoclonal antibody described above (Fig. 2i, C, middle, green). These images show that the two patterns partially overlap (Fig. 2i, C, right, yellow), suggesting that ClC-4 protein, like ClC-5 is (at least transiently) localized in early endosomes. Furthermore, double labeling of intestinal crypts with ClC-4 antibody (red) and a Golgi marker (giantin, green) clearly shows the lack of overlap and the definite apical polarization of ClC-4 (Fig. 2i, D). Our immunofluorescence studies on rat intestinal tissue suggest that ClC-4 is localized in proximity to the apical membrane of intestinal epithelial cells. The confocal images do not have the resolution necessary to determine whether ClC-4 protein is inserted in the apical plasma membrane. Therefore, we examined ultra-thin sections of freeze-substituted mouse and human intestinal tissues labeled with ClC-4 antibody (described above) by electron microscopy. Fig.2ii, A, shows that in mouse tissue, immunogold-labeled ClC-4 is localized primarily along the brush border membrane and the apical cytoplasm of an absorptive cell from the crypt of the ileum. In adjacent goblet cells, ClC-4 labeling was found predominantly in clusters in the apical cytoplasm (Fig. 2ii, B). Double labeling of a section of human small bowel with gold-labeled ClC-4 antibody (large grains, arrows) and CFTR antibody (small gold grains) shows that both of these proteins co-localize primarily on the brush border membrane of human enterocytes (Fig. 2ii, C). ClC-4 labeling intensity was also detected in the apical cytoplasm and membrane of goblet cells in human tissue (Fig. 2ii, D). The ClC-4 labeling pattern in mouse enterocytes (Fig.2iii, A) and goblet cells (Fig. 2iii, B) as well as in human enterocytes (Figs. 2iii, C) and goblet cells (Fig. 2iii, D) was effectively competed with the ClC-4 fusion protein against which the ClC-4 antibody was raised, supporting its specificity. Clearly, as ClC-4 was found in the apical membrane of the absorptive cells in close proximity to CFTR, it was next necessary to determine whether ClC-4 is functional as a chloride channel in the plasma membrane of enterocytes. We suggest that the Caco-2 cell line is an effective model for analysis of ClC-4 function in intestinal epithelia, as ClC-4 localization in confluent Caco-2 monolayers is identical to that observed in the native epithelia."

We expressed green fluorescent protein-tagged RhoA in the differentiated tracheal smooth muscle cells and visualized the translocation of RhoA in a living cell with three-dimensional digital imaging analysis. The stimulation of the cells by carbachol initiated the translocation of green fluorescent protein-tagged wild type RhoA to the plasma membrane within a minute. The change in MLC20 phosphorylation level after carbachol stimulation was monitored by using phospho-Ser-19-specific antibody recognizing the phosphorylated MLC20 in single cells. Cells expressing the dominant negative form (T19N) of RhoA significantly suppressed sustained MLC20 phosphorylation during the prolonged phase (>300 s), whereas the maximum phosphorylation level (reached at 10 s after stimulation) of these cells was not significantly different from the control cells. The kinetics of RhoA translocation was consistent with that of sustained myosin phosphorylation, suggesting the involvement of a RhoA pathway. Carbachol stimulation increased myosin phosphorylation within a minute both at the cortical and the central region. On the other hand, during prolonged phase, myosin phosphorylation was sustained at the cortical region of the cells but not at the central fibers. A myosin light chain kinase-specific inhibitor, ML-9, diminished myosin phosphorylation at the central region of the cells after the stimulation but not at the cortical area. On the other hand, Y-27632, a Rho kinase-specific inhibitor, diminished myosin phosphorylation at the cortical region but not the central region.

However, it has been realized that the smooth muscle contractile response is modulated by factors other than Ca2+. One such factor is the small G-protein Rho (1Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1998; 164: 437-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 2Somlyo A.P. Wu X. Walker L.A. Somlyo A.V. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 134: 201-234PubMed Google Scholar). Takai and co-workers (3Hirata K. Kikuchi A. Sasaki T. Kurada S. Kaibuchi K. Matsuura Y. Seki H. Saida K. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8719-8722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) originally reported that GTPγS enhanced contraction of saponin-permeabilized smooth muscle at submaximal Ca2+ concentrations, but this effect diminished in the presence of exoenzyme C3, a Rho-specific inhibitor. Subsequently it was reported that Rho can decrease myosin phosphatase activity, which anticipates the increase in the level of myosin phosphorylation (4Noda M. Yasuda-Fukazawa C. Moriishi K. Kato T. Okuda T. Kurokawa K. Takuwa Y. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The target proteins of Rho have been identified recently by several laboratories. Among these Rho targets, the Rho kinases and the myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase (5Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2433) Google Scholar) have been suggested to play an important role in the regulation of smooth muscle contraction. It was found in an in vitro system that Rho kinase can phosphorylate myosin phosphatase (specifically the myosin-binding subunit), which had the effect of decreasing myosin phosphatase activity (5Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2433) Google Scholar). It was also suggested that Rho kinase can directly phosphorylate MLC20 at serine 19 in vitro, thus activating actomyosin ATPase activity (6Amano M. Ito M. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Chihara K. Nakano T.

The question addressed in the present study is how external stimuli initiated at the plasma membrane can activate the Rho-dependent pathway to increase the phosphorylation of myosin in the contractile domain of the cells. In epithelial cells it was demonstrated by immunocytochemistry (8Leung T. Manser E. Tan L. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29051-29054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar) and by electron microscopy (9Robertson D. Paterson H.F. Adamson P. Hall A. Monaghan P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1995; 43: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) that the active form of RhoA in transfected cells localizes at the plasma membrane or in submembranous cortical actin networks. Consistent with these findings, a translocation of RhoA to the particulate fraction during agonist stimulation was reported using cell fractionation methods in smooth muscle (10Gong M.C. Fujihara H. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10704-10709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and fibroblasts (11Fleming I.N. Elliott C.M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33067-33073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Although these previous results suggest the recruitment of Rho to the plasma membrane by external stimuli, it remains obscure whether or not the translocation of Rho is kinetically coupled with changes in myosin phosphorylation and thus contraction. This issue is directly relevant to the question of how the Ca2+ pathway and Rho pathway differentially contribute to changes in myosin phosphorylation, because the change in cytosolic Ca2+ in smooth muscle cells is achieved within a few seconds after agonist stimulation. If the activation of the Rho pathway takes place at the plasma membrane, how the signal produced at the surface membrane can be transmitted to the contractile domain remains unknown. The study of living single cells, as an experimental model, is critical to answer these questions. In the present study, we employed smooth muscle cultured cells that retain agonist-induced signaling systems linking external stimuli to changes in myosin phosphorylation. To visualize RhoA in living cells, we expressed GFP-tagged RhoA. We succeeded in visualizing the translocation of RhoA in a living smooth muscle cell under agonist stimulation at a single cell level with a three-dimensional time course digital imaging analysis. To clarify the role of the Rho pathway in smooth muscle contraction, the effects of Rho modulators on changes in myosin phosphorylation during agonist stimulation were monitored at a single cell level. The results clearly indicated that the Rho pathway and the MLCK pathway change myosin phosphorylation at different regions of the smooth muscle cells with different kinetics after agonist stimulation. Collagenase (purified from Clostridium histolyticum) and elastase were purchased from Worthington. Protease was purchased from Sigma. Culture media, except Ham's F-12 media (Sigma), and other cell culture supplements were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The mammalian expression vector pEGFP-C1 was purchased from CLONTECH Laboratories (Palo Alto, CA). [γ-32P]GTP was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Anti-GFP polyclonal antibody was purchased from MBL International (Watertown, MA). Anti-RhoA polyclonal antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-RhoGDI monoclonal antibody was from BD Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA). Anti-MLC20 IgM monoclonal antibody was from Sigma. We raised the monoclonal antibody, which specifically recognizes phospho-Ser-19 of the regulatory light chain of myosin (12Komatsu S. Yano T. Shibata M. Tuft R.A. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34512-34520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and the polyclonal antibody against the C-terminal peptide (CGGRRVIENADGGEEEIDGRDGDFN) of smooth muscle myosin heavy chain from chicken gizzard. The latter antibody recognized a single band of about 200 kDa in the whole lysate of porcine tracheal smooth muscle cells with Western blot (Fig. 7A). All secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA), except for the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for Western blotting (Bio-Rad). COS-7 cells (American Type Culture Collection) and NRK52E cells (gift of Dr. Y.-L. Wang, University of Massachusetts Medical School) were cultured with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 media, respectively, containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Porcine tracheae were obtained from adult pigs, and smooth muscle cell primary culture was performed with a modification of the method as described previously (13Halayko A.J. Salari H. Ma X. Stephens N.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: L1040-L1051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, myocytes were enzymatically dispersed for 40 min at 37 °C in Hanks' balanced salt solution, containing 600 units/ml collagenase, 10 units/ml elastase, and 2 units/ml protease. Isolated cells were seeded in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (1:1) medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (growth media). Cells from passage 1 or 2 were used in all the present studies. To induce a differentiated phenotype, cells were cultured in differentiation medium consisting of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (1:1) medium with insulin/transferrin/selenium supplement (final concentrations: 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, and 5 ng/ml selenium), 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. The expression vector pEXV/Myc-tagged RhoAVal14 was the kind gift of Dr. Alan Hall (University College of London). We replaced the valine at position 14 with glycine to get a wild type RhoA. Myc-tagged RhoA cDNA was cloned into the EcoRI site of the pEGFP-C1 mammalian expression vector (CLONTECH). The resulting frameshift was fixed by cutting with HindIII at the poly-linker region of the vector and filling in with a Klenow fragment. The constitutively active mutant (Q63L) was generated by replacing glutamine for leucine in a position corresponding to glutamine 61 of Ras (14Der C.J. Finkel T. Cooper G.M. Cell. 1986; 44: 167-176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 15Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2472-2478Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Threonine 19 was mutated to asparagine, thus generating a dominant negative mutant (T19N) (16Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was done as described previously (17Yano K. Araki Y. Hales S.J. Tanaka M. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12054-12061Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). NRK-52E and COS-7 cells (about 106cells/ml) were mixed with 10 μg of vector DNA and electroporated at 200 kV and 950 microfarads, using the GenePulser II (Bio-Rad). Porcine tracheal smooth muscle cells, cultured with growth media, were mixed with 10 μg of vector DNA, and electroporation was performed using the GenePulser II/RF Module System (Bio-Rad) (parameters: total voltage, 180 V; 100% modulation, burst duration 3 ms; rf, 40 kHz; 10 bursts, burst interval 1 s). The expressed GFP-tagged proteins were detected by Western blot analysis. COS-7 cells, transfected with pEGFP-C1/RhoA(wild type), pEGFP-C1/RhoA(Q63L), pEGFP-C1/RhoA(T19N), or pEGFP-C1 vector (control), were treated with ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid, followed by sonication. The trichloroacetic acid precipitates were dissolved in 5% SDS, 0.5 m NaHCO3 buffer. These samples were then subjected to 7.5–20% gradient SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membrane was incubated with anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (MBL International, Watertown, MA), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody. The immunoreactive bands were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). The GTPase activity of the GFP-tagged RhoA was determined as follows. COS-7 cells transfected with GFP-tagged RhoA were harvested and lysed with buffer A, consisting of 0.1 mg/ml tyrosine inhibitor type II (Sigma), 120 μg/ml Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 120 μg/mlN-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 1.25 mm EGTA, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. GFP-tagged RhoA was immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody using Affi-Prep® protein A support (Bio-Rad), as described below. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to a GTPase assay as described previously (18Kikuchi A. Yamashita T. Kawata M. Yamamoto K. Ikeda K. Tanimoto T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2897-2904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subcellular fractionation was performed as described previously (11Fleming I.N. Elliott C.M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33067-33073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Briefly, porcine tracheal smooth muscle cells under the conditions shown in each figure were prepared for the cell fractionation. After washing with cold PBS, the cells were scraped in 1 ml/dish of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 500 μm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mmdithiothreitol). The cells were lysed by 10 passes through a 26-gauge needle on ice. Trypan blue staining of lysate indicated more than 95% disruption of the plasma membrane. The lysate was centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 45 min to pellet the remainder of the particulate fraction. Each fraction was washed twice with the lysis buffer to remove cytosolic proteins. Each fraction was dissolved in the same volume of sampling buffer for SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting. Samples were prepared in the same way as described above in subcellular fractionation. The samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were preincubated with Affi-Prep® Protein A support (Bio-Rad) for 1 h on ice to prevent nonspecific binding of proteins in the immunoprecipitated complex. The precleared homogenates were incubated with anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (MBL International), conjugated to Affi-Prep® Protein A support overnight at 4 °C, and rotated. The beads were centrifuged and the supernatants collected and saved. The precipitates were washed five times in ice-cold washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, and 0.1 m KCl). The supernatants and the precipitates were subjected to the further analysis. Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 10 min, followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. After blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin/PBS at room temperature for 1 h, the preparations were incubated with primary antibody at 37 °C for 1 h. After washing with PBS for 3 times, they were incubated with fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies at 37 °C for 1 h. After washing out excess antibodies, the samples were mounted in 3% 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (Sigma), 90% glycerol in PBS. For the imaging experiments with living cells, we used DIM-1 system as described below to minimize the expected photo damage to the living cells. Images of labeled living cells were acquired with a Nikon Diaphot 200 microscope equipped with a 100-watt Hg arc lamp for epifluorescence microscopy. Cells were viewed with 60 (NA 1.4) or 100× Nikon (NA 1.3) Planapo objectives with a 2.5 or 5× camera eyepiece, and images were projected onto the face of a Photometrics thermoelectrically cooled CCD camera. Digitized optical sections of labeled cells were generally obtained at 0.25-μmz axis intervals spanning the cell volume. This through-focus image series was transferred to Silicon Graphics workstations (Mountain View, CA) for analysis. 190 nm diameter fluorescent beads on separate slides were imaged under identical optical conditions to record fluorescent beads through-focus images, thus providing an empirical measure of the microscope point spread function. For restorations, three-dimensional images were dark current-subtracted, flat field-corrected, background-subtracted, and normalized to constant integrated optical density to correct for non-uniformity in illumination intensity and camera sensitivity across the field of view. Prepared images were then processed with an iterative deconvolution algorithm with non-negativity constraints, by using the empirically determined point spread function for the microscope to at least partially reverse the blurring introduced by the optics, thus increasing the quantitative reliability of the data (19Carrington W.A. Fogarty K.E. Fay F.S. Foster K. Grinstein S. Non-invasive Techniques in Cell Biology. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1990: 53-72Google Scholar). The fixed cells (Figs. 7 and 8) were viewed using the Leica DM IRBE inverted microscope equipped with TCS SP2 confocal system, a 65-milliwatt argon laser, two HeNe lasers (1.2 and 10 milliwatts), and the interference contrast accessories (Leica Microsystems Inc., Heidelberg, Germany). TIFF images were acquired and analyzed with LCS software and Adobe® Photoshop® 5.5 software (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA). To quantify phosphorylated MLC20 levels during agonist stimulation (see Fig. 7), the cultured differentiated smooth muscle cells were stimulated by carbachol (20 μm) for an indicated time, and the reaction was stopped by washing once with ice-cold PBS with 1 mmCaCl2, followed by addition of 4% formaldehyde for fixation. Cells were permeabilized and double-stained with anti-phospho-MLC20 monoclonal IgG antibody (12Komatsu S. Yano T. Shibata M. Tuft R.A. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34512-34520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), detected by indocarbocyanine (Cy3)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody, and anti-myosin heavy chain polyclonal antibody, detected by indodicarbocyanine (Cy5)-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody. Three-dimensional digital image series of transfected cells were captured with Leica TCS SP2 spectral confocal microscope as described above. The step size between the each confocal plane section was 0.5 μm. The plasma membrane of the cells was outlined manually on each plane section. The total fluorescence of both Cy3 (corresponds to phosphorylated MLC20) and Cy5 (myosin heavy chain) in each cell was calculated as the sum of the fluorescence within the outline on each plane section. The relative level of myosin phosphorylation in each smooth muscle cell was determined as the ratio of the total fluorescence between Cy3 and Cy5. Five to ten transfected cells at each indicated time were analyzed and their values determined. Similar analysis was performed in three separate experiments. The extent of MLC20 phosphorylation of smooth muscle cells during agonist stimulation was determined by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting using anti-phospho-MLC20 antibody. The cultured differentiated smooth muscle cells were stimulated by carbachol (20 μm), and the reaction was terminated by washing once with ice-cold PBS with 1 mm CaCl2, followed by soaking in 1 ml of ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid. The samples were subjected to Western blots using either anti-phospho-MLC20 IgG or anti-MLC20 IgM monoclonal antibody. To monitor [Ca2+] in the cytoplasm, tracheal smooth muscle cells were loaded with 1.7 μm fura-2 AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 40 min, and fluorescence was measured using a custom-built multiwavelength microfluorimeter as described previously (20Drummond R.M. Tuft R.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 516: 139-147Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The time required for [Ca2+] to resume the resting level after carbachol stimulation was measured on each tracheal smooth muscle cell. RhoA cDNA was linked to the 3′-end of GFP cDNA to produce C-terminal fusion protein. It is known that the C-terminal end of Rho is subjected to post-translational modification that is critical for Rho activity (21Narumiya S. Morii N. Cell. Signal. 1993; 5: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar); therefore, GFP (enhanced GFP) was tagged at the N-terminal end of RhoA to avoid any possible functional disruption to RhoA (Fig.1). To confirm the expression of GFP-tagged RhoA in cells, COS-7 cells were transfected with the GFP-RhoA expression vectors described in Fig. 1. After the transfection was confirmed with fluorescence microscopy, the cells were harvested, and the lysates were applied to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 2, the expressed GFP-tagged RhoA was detected as a single band showing a molecular mass of 48 kDa, the expected molecular mass of a chimeric protein composed of GFP (27 kDa) and RhoA (21 kDa). To investigate the effects of RhoA activation on myosin phosphorylation in smooth muscle cells, two mutant RhoAs tagged with GFP were also produced as follows: Q63L, expected to decrease the GTP hydrolysis rate (22Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2684) Google Scholar); and T19N, expected to bind to guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and inactivate endogenous Rho family homologues (16Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar), thus producing active and dominant negative RhoA, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2, these mutants also showed the expected molecular mass of the chimeric proteins. No degradation products were observed with SDS-PAGE analysis indicating that all the GFP fluorescence signals in the cells reflect the localization of the intact GFP-RhoA molecules.Figure 2Western blotting analysis of expressed GFP-tagged RhoA. The whole lysate of COS-7 cells, transfected with either pEGFP-C1/RhoA (wild type) (lane 1), pEGFP-C1/RhoA(Q63L mutant) (lane 2), pEGFP-C1/RhoA(T19N mutant) (lane 3), or pEGFP-C1 vector (lane 4), was subjected to immunoblotting as described under “Experimental Procedures” using anti-GFP polyclonal antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm that the GFP tagging does not disturb RhoA activity, the function of GFP-tagged RhoA was examined by two means. First, the GTPase activity of GFP tagged RhoA was tested. GFP-RhoA was expressed in COS-7 cells, and the expressed protein was extracted and isolated by immunoprecipitation using anti-GFP antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The specific activity was calculated to be 1.01 nmol of Pi/min/mg, which is comparable with the GTPase activity of naturally isolated RhoA (23Anderson P.S. Lacal J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3620-3628Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar,24Hoshijima M. Kondo J. Kikuchi A. Yamamoto K. Takai Y. Mol. Brain Res. 1990; 7: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), indicating the expressed GFP-tagged RhoA is a functional G-protein. The GTPase activities of the GFP-tagged RhoA mutants were 0.18 nmol of Pi/min/mg (for Q63L) and 10.7 nmol of Pi/min/mg (for T19N). The activities of T19N and Q63L GFP-RhoAs were an order of magnitude higher and lower, respectively, than that of wild type GFP-RhoA. The inhibition of the GTPase activity by Q63L mutation is consistent with the previous report (22Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2684) Google Scholar) of non-GFP-tagged RhoA and other small GTP-binding proteins. The high GTPase activity of T19N, which has not been accurately studied, could imply a shorter life of the GTP bound form, thus the inactivated form dominates. This is consistent with the previous finding (16Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar) that showed a decrease in the affinity of untagged T19N mutant for GTP but not for GDP. This mutant is also expected to show dominant negative activity, because it strongly binds to GEF, thus competing with wild type Rho for GEF binding (16Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). The results are thus consistent with earlier reports of non-GFP-tagged small G-proteins and indicate that GFP-RhoA(T19N) and GFP-RhoA(Q63L) biochemically function as the dominant negative and constitutively active forms of RhoA, respectively. It has been known that activation of the Rho pathway induces stress fiber formation in cultured cells (25Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5216) Google Scholar, 26Mackay D.J. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20685-20688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). GFP-tagged RhoA and its constitutively active form, GFP-tagged RhoA(Q63L), both induced actin stress fiber formation in NRK52E cells, whereas the GFP-tagged dominant negative form of RhoA(T19N) did not induce but rather decreased stress fibers (not shown). The results demonstrate that GFP-tagged RhoA and its derivatives properly function in vivo with regard to stress fiber induction. It has been shown that the GDP-bound form of wild type RhoA binds to RhoGDI that stabilizes its GDP-bound form, and this property constitutes an important part of RhoA function. Furthermore, the intracellular localization of RhoA is likely to be influenced by the binding to RhoGDI that is present in cytosol. Therefore, we examined the binding of GFP-tagged RhoA and its variants to RhoGDI. GFP-RhoA variants were expressed in COS-7 cells, and the binding of GFP-RhoAs with the endogenous RhoGDI was determined by co-immunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig. 3, RhoGDI co-immunoprecipitated with wild type GFP-RhoA indicating that GFP-tagged RhoA retains RhoGDI binding activity. On the other hand, the binding of GFP-RhoA(Q63L) to RhoGDI was significantly lower than that of the wild type. This is consistent with the notion that Q63L mutation stabilizes the GTP form and that RhoGDI binds preferentially the GDP form of RhoA (27Sasaki T. Kato M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23959-23963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GFP-RhoA(T19N), while the GDP form is stabilized, failed to bind to RhoGDI in vivo. A similar result was reported recently with non-GFP-tagged RhoA(T19N), and it was concluded that the failure of RhoA(T19N) to bind RhoGDI is due to its binding to GEFs that results in the inhibition of endogenous RhoA because of the elimination of GEFs (28Strass"
https://openalex.org/W2063865555,"A novel approach based on DNA-cleaving deoxyribozymes (DNAzymes) was developed to control expression of β1 and β3 integrins in endothelial cells. To engineer a specific cleavage site in mRNA, the flanking domains of DNAzymes were derived from oligodeoxynucleotides complementary to sequences corresponding to 1053–1070 and 1243–1267 in β1 and β3 mRNA, respectively. Phosphorothioate analogues of these antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, designated β1-1053 and β3-1243, significantly inhibited expression of β1 and β3 integrin subunits in endothelial and K562 cells at the level of mRNA and protein synthesis. They also specifically decreased the cell surface expression of corresponding subunits in endothelial cells and K562 cells, as measured by flow cytometry. In functional tests, β1-1053 and β3-1243 markedly reduced adhesion of cells to fibronectin and vitronectin, respectively. We designed DNAzymes to β1 and β3 mRNAs containing a 15-deoxynucleotide catalytic domain that was flanked by two substrate recognition segments of 8 and 10 deoxynucleotides for β1 and β3 DNAzymes, respectively. Both DNAzymes in the presence of Mg2+specifically cleaved their substrates, synthetic β1 and β3 mRNA fragments. Although DNAzymes were partially modified with phosphorothioate and with 2′-O-methyl groups at both the 5′ and 3′ ends indicated similar kinetic parameters, they were significantly more potent than the unmodified DNAzymes because of their much higher resistance to nuclease degradation. Similar to the antisense oligonucleotides, DNAzymes abolished microvascular endothelial cell capillary tube formation in fibrin and Matrigel. In conclusion, DNAzymes to β1 and β3 mRNAs with 2′-O-methyl modifications are potentially useful as gene-inactivating agents and may ultimately provide a therapeutic means to inhibit angiogenesisin vivo.

Angiogenesis is a multistep sequence of cellular reactions beginning with degradation of extracellular matrix and then proliferation and migration of endothelial cells followed by lumen formation and maturation (1Risau W. Nature. 1997; 386: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (4792) Google Scholar). The formation of new blood vessels is critical to the development of normal tissues as well as the growth of solid tumors and to a large extent depends on specific molecular interactions between vascular cells and extracellular matrix (2Hanahan D. Folkman J. Cell. 1996; 86: 353-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6013) Google Scholar, 3Bouck N. Stellmach V. Hsu S.C. Adv. Cancer Res. 1996; 69: 135-174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aberrant angiogenesis is also a key process for progress of many disorders including atherosclerosis (4O'Brien E.R. Garvin M.R. Dev R. Stewart D.K. Hinohara T. Simpson J.B. Schwartz S.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 883-894PubMed Google Scholar), diabetic retinopathy (5Hammes H.P. Brownlee M. Jonczyk A. Sutter A. Preissner K.T. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) and restenosis (6Panda D. Kundu G.C. Lee B.I. Peri A. Fohl D. Chackalaparamil I. Mukherjee B.B., Li, X.D. Mukherjee D.C. Seides S. Rosenberg J. Stark K. Mukherjee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9308-9313Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Currently, two groups of integrin receptors are known to regulate adhesive interactions during angiogenesis. Integrins in the β1 subfamily, particularly α5β1 and α2β1, which are substantially expressed in human angiogenic blood vessels, promote endothelial cell morphogenesis, migration, and tube formation (7Eliceiri B.P. Cheresh D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1227-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 8Bayless K.J. Salazar R. Davis G.E. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 1673-1683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The second group is composed of vitronectin receptors αVβ3 and αVβ5, which are poorly expressed in quiescent vasculature (9Cheresh D.A. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 395-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 10Brooks P.C. Clark R.A.F. Cheresh D.A. Science. 1994; 264: 569-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (2715) Google Scholar) but can be substantially expressed by neoplastic vasculature and cells (11Bello L. Zhang J. Nikas D.C. Strasser J.F.

Dirix L.Y. Ranieri G. Miceli R. Cheresh D.A. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 2625-2634PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of αVβ3 and αVβ5 can be differentially up-regulated by angiogenic inducers such as vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor (13Eliceiri B.P. Cheresh D.A. Cancer J. Sci Am. 2000; Suppl. 3: S245-S249Google Scholar). Vascular endothelial growth factor can also activate both β1 receptors, and thus it enhances cell adhesion and migration (14Byzova T.V. Goldman C.K. Pampori N. Thoma K.A. Bett A. Shattil S.J. Plow E.F. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 851-860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, integrin-mediated adhesion leads to intracellular signaling events that regulate cell survival, proliferation and migration (7Eliceiri B.P. Cheresh D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1227-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar).Given the importance of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions in the pathogenesis of many human diseases, integrin receptors become very attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. Both peptide antagonists and the anti αVβ3 monoclonal antibody LM609 (15Brooks P.C. Stomblad S. Klemke R. Visscher D. Sarkar F.H. Cheresh D.A. J. Clin.

A. 1997; 94: 4262-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar) as conceptually similar to conventional hammerhead ribozymes able to specifically cleave RNA molecules with any sequence. These DNAzymes consist of a 15-deoxyribonucleotide catalytic domain flanked by two substrate recognition domains of seven to nine deoxyribonucleotides each, which bind the RNA substrate through complementary base-pairing. DNAzymes were found to be potentially useful as gene-inactivating agents in the treatment of diseases such as chronic myelogenous leukemia (20Warashina M. Kuwabara T. Nakamatsu Y. Taira K. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 237-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In contrast to conventional antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, they were highly specific and cleaved only aberrant BCR-ABL (fusion gene for p210BCR-ABL, a marker of chronic myelogenous leukemia) mRNA. In this report, we present data showing that DNAzymes to β1 and β3 mRNA reduce expression of targeted integrin subunits and block proliferation, migration, and network formation in a fibrin and Matrigel matrix.DISCUSSIONThe adhesive interactions of cells with the extracellular matrix play an important role in the organization of cells in differentiated organs as well as in the motility, immune recognition, and aggregation of cells. These functions are mediated by a group of cell surface receptors known as integrins (36Klemke R.L. Yebra M. Bayna E.M. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 37Lawson M.A. Maxfield F.R. Nature. 1995; 377: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 38Yebra M. Filardo E.J.

Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3250) Google Scholar). The migration of vascular cells is also critical to the process of blood vessel remodeling. For instance, the migration of a subpopulation of endothelial cells is an important step in the multifactorial process of angiogenesis. Because integrin receptors are involved directly in the early stages of angiogenesis, they constitute a very attractive therapeutic target that could be either directly blocked or inhibited at the protein synthesis level. Different strategies aimed at rapid inactivation of integrin receptors have been developed, including neutralization of the target proteins by monoclonal antibodies and low molecular weight peptide analogues. Based on successful preclinical data, several anti-angiogenic agents directly reacting with integrins, used alone or in combination with conventional therapies, are now in clinical trials (40Carmeliet P. Jain R.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (7341) Google Scholar). However, there are several studies suggesting that certain integrin-specific ligands provoke trans-dominant inhibition that could lead to unexpected effects on cell migration, gene expression, and cell viability (41Diaz-Gonzalez F. Forsyth J. Steiner B. Ginsberg M.H. Mol. Biol. 1966; 7: 1939-1951Google Scholar, 42Blystone S.D Graham L.I. Lindberg E.P. Brown E.J. J.

Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar).Alternatively, a reduction in the expression of these proteins has been reversibly accomplished by modifying their synthesis in the target cells. Synthesis of integrin receptors was successfully reduced by synthetic antisense oligonucleotides and endogenous antisense mRNA expressed upon transfection of endothelial cell lines. However, the regions of cDNA that yield effective antisense probes cannot be predicted with certainty because of the high homology among integrin subunits, particularly those belonging to the α and β subunits. On the other hand, the utility of such antisense probes is quite often questioned because of their low specificity (46Vaerman J.L. Moureau P. Deldime F. Lewalle P. Lammineur C. Morschhauser F. Martiat P. Blood. 1997; 90: 331-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, DNAzymes were found to be very specific and cleaved mRNA precisely at the targeted sequence (20Warashina M. Kuwabara T. Nakamatsu Y. Taira K. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 237-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Although DNAzymes are similar to conventional hammerhead ribozymes, their complexes with RNA are less stable than the corresponding RNA-RNA duplexes. Hence, mismatches in binding arms that might be generated during interaction with a nontarget mRNA, such as the mRNA of homologous integrin subunits, would interfere with cleavage activity to a greater extent than in the case of a ribozyme.The catalytic domain used in this study was selected previously by combinatorial strategy (19Santoro S.W. Joyce G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4262-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar) as a part of “10-23”deoxyribozyme. This catalytic core was ranked among the most effective nucleic enzymes of its kind, even when compared with natural self-cleaving ribozymes (47Breaker R.R. Science. 2000; 290: 2095-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The design of the DNAzymes and the choice of target sites for the specific cleavage of β1 and β3 mRNA were based on analysis of the accessibility of different mRNA sequences to antisense oligodeoxynucleotides. We found two such regions that corresponded to residues 1053–1070 and 1243–1267 of β1 and β3 mRNA, respectively. As demonstrated under “Results,” phosphorothioate analogues of oligodeoxynucleotides complementary to these sequences because of antisense effects specifically reduced expression of the relevant integrin subunit, measured at mRNA levels, protein synthesis, and on the surface of the cells. Thus, both β1(1053–1070) and β3(1243–1267) mRNA sequences appeared to be easily accessible to antisense probes and were used to design flanking regions of DNAzymes. Antisense oligonucleotides and DNAzymes to β1 and β3 integrin subunits were highly effective inhibitors of endothelial cell adhesion and capillary tube formation.In conclusion, the data presented here further support the roles of β1 and β3 integrin receptors in endothelial cell migration and in the early stages of angiogenesis. In addition to synthetic antisense oligonucleotides and virally mediated infection of endothelial cells to express endogenously the antisense RNA, DNAzymes can be very useful inhibitors of angiogenesis, particularly when the specific blocking of the targeted integrin is concerned. Angiogenesis is a multistep sequence of cellular reactions beginning with degradation of extracellular matrix and then proliferation and migration of endothelial cells followed by lumen formation and maturation (1Risau W. Nature. 1997; 386: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (4792) Google Scholar). The formation of new blood vessels is critical to the development of normal tissues as well as the growth of solid tumors and to a large extent depends on specific molecular interactions between vascular cells and extracellular matrix (2Hanahan D. Folkman J. Cell. 1996; 86: 353-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6013) Google Scholar, 3Bouck N. Stellmach V. Hsu S.C. Adv. Cancer Res. 1996; 69: 135-174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aberrant angiogenesis is also a key process for progress of many disorders including atherosclerosis (4O'Brien E.R. Garvin M.R. Dev R. Stewart D.K. Hinohara T. Simpson J.B. Schwartz S.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 883-894PubMed Google Scholar), diabetic retinopathy (5Hammes H.P. Brownlee M. Jonczyk A. Sutter A. Preissner K.T. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) and restenosis (6Panda D. Kundu G.C. Lee B.I. Peri A. Fohl D. Chackalaparamil I. Mukherjee B.B., Li, X.D. Mukherjee D.C. Seides S. Rosenberg J. Stark K. Mukherjee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9308-9313Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Currently, two groups of integrin receptors are known to regulate adhesive interactions during angiogenesis. Integrins in the β1 subfamily, particularly α5β1 and α2β1, which are substantially expressed in human angiogenic blood vessels, promote endothelial cell morphogenesis, migration, and tube formation (7Eliceiri B.P. Cheresh D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1227-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 8Bayless K.J. Salazar R. Davis G.E. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 1673-1683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The second group is composed of vitronectin receptors αVβ3 and αVβ5, which are poorly expressed in quiescent vasculature (9Cheresh D.A. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 395-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 10Brooks P.C. Clark R.A.F. Cheresh D.A. Science. 1994; 264: 569-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (2715) Google Scholar) but can be substantially expressed by neoplastic vasculature and cells (11Bello L. Zhang J. Nikas D.C. Strasser J.F.

Dirix L.Y. Ranieri G. Miceli R. Cheresh D.A. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 2625-2634PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of αVβ3 and αVβ5 can be differentially up-regulated by angiogenic inducers such as vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor (13Eliceiri B.P. Cheresh D.A. Cancer J. Sci Am. 2000; Suppl. 3: S245-S249Google Scholar). Vascular endothelial growth factor can also activate both β1 receptors, and thus it enhances cell adhesion and migration (14Byzova T.V. Goldman C.K. Pampori N. Thoma K.A. Bett A. Shattil S.J. Plow E.F. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 851-860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, integrin-mediated adhesion leads to intracellular signaling events that regulate cell survival, proliferation and migration (7Eliceiri B.P. Cheresh D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1227-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Given the importance of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions in the pathogenesis of many human diseases, integrin receptors become very attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. Both peptide antagonists and the anti αVβ3 monoclonal antibody LM609 (15Brooks P.C. Stomblad S. Klemke R. Visscher D. Sarkar F.H. Cheresh D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1815-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar) are potent angiogenesis blockers in animals and humans (16Koivisto L. Heino J. Hakkinen L. Larjava H. Biochem.

In conclusion, the data presented here further support the roles of β1 and β3 integrin receptors in endothelial cell migration and in the early stages of angiogenesis. In addition to synthetic antisense oligonucleotides and virally mediated infection of endothelial cells to express endogenously the antisense RNA, DNAzymes can be very useful inhibitors of angiogenesis, particularly when the specific blocking of the targeted integrin is concerned. We thank Dr. M. Maszewska for excellent help in maintaining the endothelial cell cultures."
https://openalex.org/W2016800268,"p68 and p72 are two highly related DEAD box proteins with similar biochemical activities in the nucleus of vertebrate cells; it is unknown whether they have redundant or differential in vivo functions. We report on a third member of this subfamily that is alternatively expressed from p72 mRNA. A detailed analysis of HeLa p72 mRNA was performed. It has an overall length of more than 5 kb and contains a 0.75-kb 5′-untranslated region and a 3′-untranslated region of 2.5 kb. Its open reading frame extends to nucleotide −243 upstream of the first in-frame AUG (A in the AUG triplet is +1) which serves as the p72 translation initiator codon. We provide evidence that alternative translation at a non-AUG within the extra coding region of this mRNA yields an 82-kDa protein (p82). Immunological studies substantiate that p82 is a naturally existing p72 variant and that both proteins are expressed at similar concentrations. p82 purified from HeLa cells is an ATP-dependent RNA helicase with biochemical properties almost identical to those of p72. p68 and p72 are two highly related DEAD box proteins with similar biochemical activities in the nucleus of vertebrate cells; it is unknown whether they have redundant or differential in vivo functions.

EXS (Basel). 2000; 89: 11-28Google Scholar). Generation of protein variants by alternative pre-mRNA splicing or alternative initiation of mRNA translation enlarges the coding capacity and may explain the relatively low number of genes actually found in the human genome. According to recent estimations, on average one gene encodes three proteins (2Galas D.J. Science. 2001; 291: 1257-1260Google Scholar). Although the 5′-untranslated leader sequences (UTRs)1 of most vertebrate mRNAs are less than 100 nucleotides (nt) long (3Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Google Scholar), those of tightly controlled genes usually are longer and are GC-rich. Such structure-prone 5′-UTRs can modulate translation by the presence of upstream (up) open reading frames (ORFs) in addition to the main ORF, by formation of secondary structures, and/or by RNA-protein interactions (4Gray N.K. Wickens M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 399-458Google Scholar). Indeed, they appear particularly characteristic of mRNAs encoding growth factors, receptor proteins, transcription factors, signal transduction components, proto-oncogenes, tumor suppressor proteins, and even proteins that mostly are constitutively expressed at a low level (“housekeeping” proteins). DEAD/DEXH box proteins belonging to superfamily II of RNA helicases play a universal role in RNA metabolism of pro- and eukaryotes. Not surprisingly, they are involved in gene expression control, for instance during germ cell and embryonic development or in cell proliferation and differentiation (5Lüking A. Stahl U. Schmidt U. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 259-296Google Scholar). This in turn requires tight control of at least some DEAD/DEXH box proteins like CsdA ofEscherichia coli, which is regulated by an 11-nt “cold box” sequence in its 5′-UTR (6Fang L. Hou Y. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 90-95Google Scholar), or the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Dbp2, the gene of which contains an unusually large intron that is part of a post-transcriptional autoregulatory feedback loop (7Barta I. Iggo R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3800-3808Google Scholar). A similarly complex transcription regulation has been shown for nuclear p68 (8Rössler O.G. Hloch P. Schütz N. Weitzenegger T. Stahl H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 932-939Google Scholar), a mammalian homologue of Dbp2. In addition, the 5′-UTR of p68 mRNA is long (170 nt) and GC-rich (57.6% as compared with a genome-wide average of 41%; see Ref. 9International Human Genome Sequencing ConsortiumNature. 2001; 409: 860-921Google Scholar). This suggests a regulatory mechanism of p68 expression on mRNA level and thus an important cellular function of the protein. In fact, p68 is differentially expressed during embryogenesis, and its expression is induced by serum (10Stevenson R.J. Hamilton S.J. MacCallum D.E. Hall P.A. Fuller-Pace F.V. J. Pathol. 1998; 184: 351-359Google Scholar, 11Seufert D.W. Kos R. Erickson C.A. Swalla B.J. J. Exp. Zool. 2000; 28: 193-204Google Scholar). p72, another human DEAD box protein (12Lamm G.M. Nicol S.M. Fuller-Pace F.V. Lamond A.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3739-3747Google Scholar), is highly homologous to p68. It is, like p68, transcribed in a tissue-specific manner and seems to be involved in neuronal differentiation (13Ip F.C.F. Chung S.S.K. Fu W.-Y. Ip N.C. Neuroreport. 2000; 11: 457-462Google Scholar). p68 and p72 share 78.6% homology (identical amino acids plus conservative substitutions). The two proteins (plus possibly not yet identified ones) apparently form a subfamily of DEAD box proteins. p68 and p72 are ATP-dependent RNA helicases with similar biochemical properties, and both proteins show RNA annealing activity (14Rössler O.G. Straka A. Stahl H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2088-2096Google Scholar).In vitro, p68 and p72 are capable of catalyzing RNA secondary structure rearrangements in an ATP-dependent manner via the formation of RNA branch migration structures (14Rössler O.G. Straka A. Stahl H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2088-2096Google Scholar). Both proteins may therefore participate in structural reorganization of ribonucleoprotein assemblies in vivo. In fact, p68 has been found in spliceosomes (15Neubauer G. King A. Rappsilber J. Calvio C. Watson M. Ajuh P. Sleeman J. Lamond A.I. Mann M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 46-50Google Scholar) and in a protein-RNA complex of 5-methylcytosine-DNA glycosylase (16Jost J.-P. Schwarz S. Hess D. Angliker H. Fuller-Pace F.V. Stahl H. Thiry S. Siegmann M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3245-3252Google Scholar). A recently reported (17Akileswaran L. Taraska J.W. Sayer J.A. Gettemy J.M. Coghlan V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17448-17454Google Scholar) interaction with protein kinase A anchoring protein AKAP95 supports a role of p68 in hormonally responsive transcription complexes, and indeed, p68 and p72 act as transcriptional co-activators of estrogen receptor α in cooperation with an RNA co-activator (18Endoh H. Maruyama K. Masuhiro Y. Kobayashi Y. Goto M. Tai H. Yanagisawa J. Metzger D. Hashimoto S. Kato S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5363-5372Google Scholar, 19Watanabe M. Yanagisawa J. Kitagawa H. Takeyama K. Ogawa S. Arao Y. Suzawa M. Kobayashi Y. Yano T. Yoshikawa H. Masuhiro Y. Kato S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1341-1352Google Scholar). Recently, several transcription factors and other regulatory proteins have attracted great interest due to the existence of alternatively transcribed/translated species, and functional importance is attributed to this feature. Intriguingly, two different p72-specific RNAs (5.3 and 9.3 kb) occur in vertebrate cells that are much longer than the p72 coding sequence (cds; 1953 nt, GenBankTM accession number NM_006386; see Ref. 12Lamm G.M. Nicol S.M. Fuller-Pace F.V. Lamond A.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3739-3747Google Scholar). It is unknown as yet which of those RNAs represents the p72 mRNA. In this work, p72 mRNA including its 5′- and 3′-UTRs has been analyzed in detail. We report that in vitro and in vivo translation of the complete ORF of the p72 mRNA leads to an alternative polypeptide, p82, in addition to p72. The specific biochemical activities of p82 isolated from HeLa cells are characterized and compared with those of p72 and p68. Restriction endonucleases were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals or MBI Fermentas, and plasmids pGEM7Zf(−) and pGEM3 were from Promega. pMOS, chromatography media, and columns were supplied by Amersham Biosciences. All other reagents were of the highest purity grade commercially available. cDNA library screening, PCR, cloning procedures, plasmid preparations, and electrophoreses were carried out according to standard protocols (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA sequencing was done by SEQLAB GmbH, Goettingen, Germany. Oligonucleotides used are listed in Table I. For HeLa λ cDNA library screening, a p72-specific digoxigenin-labeled cDNA probe (dig-p72), which corresponds to positions +93 to +631 of p72 cDNA, was synthesized by PCR of human p72 cDNA using oligonucleotide primers dig5 and dig3. A p72 gene exon 13-specific antisense RNA probe (complementary to nt 1467–1986 of the p72 cDNA) was synthesized for Northern blotting by AvaII digest of clone 2423 (see below), followed by transcription with T7 RNA polymerase to yield the respective antisense RNA. A p72 gene intron 11-specific probe was prepared by RT-PCR of HeLa poly(A)+ RNA with primers 5_i11 and 3_i11, followed by XhoI/BamHI recloning into pGEM7Zf(−) and transcription with SP6 RNA polymerase.Table IOligonucleotides employedPurposeLabelSequence; originProbe synthesisdig55′-TGGTAATCCTGGGGAGCG-3′; p72 cds, nt 93–110dig35′-CTTCAATCTAGAACATTTGCC-3′; p72 cds, nt 631–5655_i115′-GGGGCTCGAGCAATTCCCAGCAGTAGAGAGAA-3′; hc22_ nt 100182 to 100161, contains XhoI site3_i115′-GGGGGGATCCGTCAATGATGAGTCAGTGTGTA-3′; hc22_ nt 99306–99327, contains BamHI siteRT-PCRs of p72 5′-UTR5a5′-TCCAAATCCTCCACGGTCAC-3′; p72 cds, nt 57 to 375b5′-CTGACGTAAAGTGCTTCCAAG-3′; hc22*, nt 117619 to 1175985c5′-GGGTATTCTTGGAAGCACTTT-3′; hc22*, nt 117592–1176125d5′-AGGACTCTGAAACTTGATAACAAT-3′; hc22*, nt 117930 to 1179075e5′-AAGGGACACGGCTCTTCCATC-3′; hc22*, nt 118112 to 118092RT-PCRs of p72 3′-UTR3a5′-GGGGCAGCTGCTTATGGCACCAGT-3′; p72 cds, nt 1684–17073b5′-GTTGGGGGAAGAAATTAATCTCT-3′; hc22*, nt 96827–968493c5′-AGAGATTAATTTCTTCCCCCAAC-3′; hc22*, nt 96849 to 968273d5′-ATCCCTCTCTCCCTAAAGAATT-3′; hc22*, nt 95581–956023e5′-TACTCGAGGTTTTGTTTTCCTTT-3′; hc22*, nt 95628 to 956063f5′-GGAATTTACTGTTATTTTATGATTA-3′; hc22*, nt 95094–951183g5′-TTCCAAACCTCAAAAACTATT-3′; hc22*, nt 95097 to 950773h5′-TTTATTTATACCTACAAAAAGAAAACA-3′; hc22*, nt 94638–946643i5′-GTTTTAAGACGTCTACGTTGAA-3′; hc22*, nt 94565–945853k5′-CTAATGGTACTTAGGCGAGT-3′; hc22*, nt 94363–94382RT-PCRs checking p72 RNAi15′-TTTTGTGCAGTCGCTGGGAAGG-3′; hc22*, nt 117490 to 117469 for the presence of intronsi25′-ATGCGCGGAGGAGGCTTTGGG-3′; p72 cds, nt 1–21i35′-CATATGGTGTCAGCCTTGCTACT-3′; p72 cds, nt 205 to 183i45′-GCCTTCCATCATGCTAACTT-3′; p72 cds, nt 277–296i55′-ATGAACAATTGCAGGCAGGAGATA-3′; p72 cds, nt 436–459i65′-TCATATTAACCACCAGCC-3′; p72 cds, nt 456–473i75′-CTCTCTGGTAGGAGCCAGAA-3′; p72 cds, nt 509–528i85′-TATTTCTTCCATTAGTTGGATCA-3′; p72 cds, nt 980–1002i95′-GACAAAGAGACGCTGTGAT-3′; p72 cds, nt 1041–1059i105′-TATGTGTATCCATGGAGACAAGAGTCA-3′; p72 cds, nt 1098–1124i115′-GATGGGTGCCTTTCCAG-3′; p72 cds, nt 1176–1160i125′-CACAAACTTGACATCTTCCAC-3′; p72 cds, nt 1233 to 1213i135′-GTCAAGTTTGTGATCAACTATGACT-3′; p72 cds, nt 1222–1246i145′-TCATTTACGTGAAGGAGGAGGA-3′; p72 cds, nt 1953–1932Construction of clone 1953Bam N725′-GAGAGAGGATCCATGCGCGGAGGAGGCTTTGGG-3′; p72 cds, nt 1–21, contains BamHI siteHin C725′-GAGAGAAAGCTTAAGTCTGCTGGAGTCACTACCACT-3′; p72 cDNA, nt 1984–1963, contains HindIII siteC104 epitope tagging of thei11See above; contains NcoI site p72 cds10C4 725′-GAGACTCGAGAAGCTTTCAGGGCTTTGCACCAACATACTTTTGAGCGTGGTTTGA- TTTACGTGA-3′; contains XhoI siteChecking for an individual p82 cDNA (wobbles arePKF5′-CGCGGATCCCCIAA(AG)TT(CT)GA(AG)AA(AG)AA-3′ deduced from α-p68-(45–59)-binding site indicated in parentheses)KNF5′-GGGGGGATCC(AG)TTT(AGC)(AG)(AG)AA(AG)(AG)AITTITA-3′; deduced from α-p68- (45–59)-binding siteEAD5′-CCGGAATTCCATIC(GT)(AG)TC(AGCT)GC(CT)TC deduced from MaD1-binding site1-ahc22, human chromosome 22.

For preparation of p82-specific antibodies (α-p82N), a peptide (NH2-TVASATGDSASERES-COOH) corresponding to p82-specific N-terminal amino acids (cf. Fig. 6) was chemically synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 433A Peptide Synthesizer, coupled to hemocyanin, and used as an antigen for multiple immunizations of rabbits. Antibodies α-p72C were raised against a p72 deletion mutant (consisting of amino acids 437–650) expressed in E. coli (21Rössler O.G. Ph.D. thesis. University of the Saarland, Saarbrücken, Germany2000Google Scholar). Antibodies α-p68-(45–59) (22Hloch P. Ph.D. thesis. University of Konstanz, Germany1995Google Scholar) were raised against an N-terminal peptide of p68 (amino acids 45–59) and also recognized p72, which contains two conservative substitutions in this sequence. Affinity purification of polyclonal antibodies was carried out on N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) to which the respective antigen had been coupled. C10 is a p68-specific monoclonal antibody directed against the C-terminal amino acids 600–614 (23Reim, P. (1993) Diploma Thesis, University of Konstanz, GermanyGoogle Scholar). DEAD box-specific monoclonal antibody MaD1 (24Iggo R. Picksley S. Southgate J. McPheat J. Lane D.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5413-5417Google Scholar) is directed against the amino acid sequence NH2-LVLDEADRMLDMGFEPQ-COOH. Monoclonal antibody 10C4 was raised against a peptide (NH2-VGAKP-COOH) of Tms1 protein of Schizosaccharomyces pombe(25Schneider E. Fuchs A. Nastainczyk W. Montenarh M. Wagner P. Hybridoma. 1995; 14: 329-333Google Scholar). DNA and protein sequence homology searches were done using the BLAST and FASTA service of the NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and the ExPASY Molecular Biology server (www.expasy.ch/). Gene sequence analysis was carried out using the Baylor College of Medicine Search Launcher (searchlauncher.bcm.tmc.edu/) and splice site prediction by Neural Network (www.fruit fly.org/se). RNA secondary structure predictions were performed with mfold version 3.1 (26Mathews D.H. Sabina J. Zuker M. Turner D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 911-940Google Scholar) that gives credible results for RNAs up to 1 kb (27Chen Y. Carlini D.B. Baines J.F. Parsch J. Braverman J.M. Tanda S. Stephan W. Genes Genet. Syst. 1999; 74: 271-286Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from 3.6 × 107 HeLa cells using the Oligotex Direct mRNA kit (Qiagen) according to supplier's recommendations except that RNA was eluted with 200 μl of preheated (85 °C) elution buffer. Northern blotting of HeLa poly(A)+ RNA was carried out using dig-labeled probes (Digoxigenin System, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) corresponding to p72 gene exon 13-specific antisense RNA and to p72 gene intron 11-specific antisense RNA, respectively, and detected with CSPD (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For HeLa cDNA synthesis, 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA and 10 pmol of Marathon cDNA synthesis primer (CLONTECH) were heated at 70 °C for 2 min and immediately chilled on ice. Then, first and second strand DNA synthesis was performed exactly as described by the Marathon cDNA amplification protocol (CLONTECH). RT-PCRs with DNase-treated HeLa poly(A)+ RNA as the template were performed according to a two-step protocol using M-MLV reverse transcriptase, RNase H minus (Promega), 1 μg of RNA, 1 μg of the respective 3′-oligonucleotide primer (Table I) at 42 °C for 1 h. Taq (Amersham Biosciences) or Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega) were used in the subsequent PCR. In respective negative controls, the poly(A)+ RNA was directly used in PCRs and reconfirmed the absence of traces of genomic DNA. Sequences of the RT-PCR products were analyzed by DNA sequencing. A p72 cDNA (position −297 to position +2125) was obtained by HeLa λ cDNA library screening with the dig-p72 probe, cloned into pMOS, and subsequently recloned into pGEM7Zf(−) via EcoRI to yield clone 2423. The p72 cds was PCR-amplified with BamHI- andHindIII-tagged primers BamN72 and HinC72 (Table I) and cloned into pGEM7Zf(−) to yield clone 1953. Insert sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. Plasmids were linearized by XhoI digest and transcribed in vitro with SP6 RNA polymerase using the Riboprobe run-off system (Promega) to yield clone 2423 RNA and clone 1953 RNA, respectively. Concentrations of transcripts were determined photometrically, and their quality was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis. In vitro translation in a reticulocyte lysate was performed using [35S]methionine according to the Flexi Rabbit protocol (Promega). Stop codons (TGA) were removed from the cDNA of clones 2423 and 1953, respectively, and an oligonucleotide coding for the 10C4 epitope (5′-GCTCAAAAGTATGTTGGTGCAAAGCCC-3′) was introduced by PCR cloning at the 3′ ends of their coding sequences with primers i11 (containing anNcoI site) and 10C472 (containing an XhoI site; Table I). The cDNAs obtained were then recloned into pCMV, a vector suitable for transient expression in COS cells, yielding pCMVp82 and pCMVp72, respectively. DNA constructs were verified by nucleotide sequencing. Particular attention was paid to avoid any vector-based ATG in front of the p72 5′-ORF. COS cell transfection was done by the DEAE-dextran method using 10 μg of pCMVp82 and pCMVp72, respectively. Standard SDS-PAGE gels were prepared and run according to Ref. 28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar. For autoradiography, gels containing 35S-labeled protein samples were incubated in enhancer solution (2 m salicylic acid, pH 8) for 30 min, dried, and exposed at −70 °C for 5–16 h. Western blotting was carried out according to Ref. 20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar using alkaline phosphatase and nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate for detection. 3.6 × 109 HeLa cells were harvested by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min, resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm MES, pH 6.2, 10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, supplemented with Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to manufacturer's recommendations), and recentrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min. Nuclei were extracted at pH 10.5 as described previously (29Hirling H. Scheffner M. Restle T. Stahl H. Nature. 1989; 339: 562-564Google Scholar) and mixed with protein A-Sepharose-coupled antibodies. After washing with NET buffer (50 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40), bound proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE loading buffer and directly analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. HeLa cells grown to 80% confluency were incubated in phosphate-free medium supplemented with 250–500 μCi of [33P]orthophosphate for 16 h. A nuclear extract of the cells was prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation with the indicated antibodies as described. Immunoprecipitation of p53 was carried out as a positive control with antibody PAb421 (30Harlow E. Crawford L.V. Pim D.C. Williamson N.M. J. Virol. 1981; 39: 861-869Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. A nuclear extract was subjected to hydroxyapatite chromatography and ammonium sulfate precipitations according to Ref. 29Hirling H. Scheffner M. Restle T. Stahl H. Nature. 1989; 339: 562-564Google Scholar. Briefly, the buffered (pH 8.3) nuclear extract was applied to a hydroxyapatite column (10 × 30 mm) and washed with 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Proteins were eluted from the column by a salt gradient (starting from 50 to 350 mmpotassium phosphate). p82-containing fractions were subjected to a fractionated ammonium sulfate precipitation (15 and 33% saturation, respectively). Proteins precipitated at 15–33% saturation were washed in 25 mm Tris·Cl, pH 8.5, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 7.5% glycerol, 300 mmNaCl, diluted 2-fold and applied to a DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column, followed by a HiTrap Heparin HP column. p82 was eluted by a salt gradient (270 mm to 1 m NaCl), diluted to 100 mm NaCl (final concentration), and applied onto an ssDNA cellulose column, from which it was eluted by a salt gradient (150–700 mm NaCl). p82 fractions were pooled and dialyzed in 25 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100. Sucrose gradient (5–15%) centrifugation was performed with 2 μg of p82 in a Beckman SW55 rotor at 270,000 × g, 0 °C for 24 h. Aldolase (160-kDa tetramer) and bovine serum albumin (68 kDa) were carried along as external 7.4 S and 4.2 S sedimentation markers, respectively. ATP hydrolysis was assayed according to Ref.31Grifo J.A. Abramson R.D. Satler C.A. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8648-8654Google Scholar. Standard 50-μl assays contained varying amounts of p82 in 35 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 4 μg of poly(C) or poly(A)+ RNA, 0.1 mm ATP, and 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. To check for RNA dependence of the p82 ATPase activity, poly(C) or poly(A)+ RNA was omitted from the respective samples. Incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 45 min, stopped by addition of 200 mg/ml activated charcoal (which binds remaining ATP), and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min. Amounts of released 32Pi in the supernatants were determined by scintillation counting. Binding of p82 to RNA that had been32P-labeled by in vitro transcription ofHaeIII-digested pGEM-CAT was assayed by nitrocellulose filter retention of the respective protein-RNA complex as described previously (14Rössler O.G. Straka A. Stahl H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2088-2096Google Scholar). The 17-bp partial dsRNA substrate, the 3′-substrate (25-bp ds region), and the 5′-substrate (28-bp ds region) were constructed exactly as described (32Scheffner M. Knippers R. Stahl H. Cell. 1989; 57: 955-963Google Scholar). One strand of the 44-bp substrate was produced by run-off transcription ofNheI-linearized plasmid pGEM3 by T7 RNA polymerase. The other strand was transcribed by SP6 RNA polymerase fromEcoRI-linearized pGEM-MO1/2 (32Scheffner M. Knippers R. Stahl H. Cell. 1989; 57: 955-963Google Scholar). Hybridization of both transcripts yielded the 44-bp substrate. RNA helicase activity assays of p82 were performed exactly as described (14Rössler O.G. Straka A. Stahl H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2088-2096Google Scholar). The mRNA of p72 was analyzed by RT-PCR and by Northern blotting (Fig.1 and TableI). When a p72 cDNA was used as a probe in these experiments, a prominent p72-specific RNA species of 5.3 kb was detected. This RNA contains the entire p72 cds region without introns and hence seems to represent functional p72 mRNA. In addition, after overexposure of the Northern blot, much less abundant smaller and one larger (9.3 kb) RNA species became visible. The smaller RNAs varied in size from experiment to experiment, while the 9.3-kb species was also detected with a p72 intron 11-specific probe (Fig.1A, lane 2), and according to our RT-PCR analysis includes intron 9 (0.25 kb) and intron 11 (4 kb) or intron 11 only in addition to the p72 cds. The occurrence of partially unspliced p72 RNA in the poly(A)+ RNA fraction may hint at a post-transcriptional autoregulatory mechanism of p72 similar to that of the highly related DEAD box protein p68 (21Rössler O.G. Ph.D. thesis. University of the Saarland, Saarbrücken, Germany2000Google Scholar) and its yeast homologue Dbp2 (7Barta I. Iggo R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3800-3808Google Scholar). Expression of a p72 mRNA containing introns 9 or 11 would lead to polypeptides of 363 and 407 amino acids, respectively, which were not detected in HeLa cells (see below). Two p72 RNA species of about 5 and 9 kb had also been found previously in Northern blot analyses of human tissues (12Lamm G.M. Nicol S.M. Fuller-Pace F.V. Lamond A.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3739-3747Google Scholar) and vertebrate cell lines (13Ip F.C.F. Chung S.S.K. Fu W.-Y. Ip N.C. Neuroreport. 2000; 11: 457-462Google Scholar) in variable amounts and ratios. The size of the 5.3-kb p72 mRNA indicates the existence of long untranslated region(s). To rationalize the molecular weight of p72 mRNA, we analyzed the genomic sequence of p72 (encoded by human chromosome 22; GenBankTM accession number NT_011520.4) with respect to potential promoters and polyadenylation signals. In good agreement with the Northern blotting experiments, these studies predicted a p72 mRNA of 5213 nt (Fig. 1C), provided that no splicing occurs in the UTR(s). However, the use of a potential alternative promoter positioned about 3 kb further upstream could as well result in a similarly sized mRNA, but only if the 5′-UTR was processed by splicing. To distinguish between these two possibilities, the 3′- and 5′-UTRs of p72 mRNA were analyzed by scanning RT-PCR (followed by DNA sequencing) with oligonucleotide primers (Table I) derived from the genomic sequences adjacent to the p72 cds (Fig. 1,B and C). The p72 3′-UTR found by this approach consists of 2.5 kb and represents the uninterrupted gene sequence downstream of the p72 cds. Its 3′ end does not match with the poly(A) addition sites predicted in positions +4441 or +4449 (the A of the p72 AUG initiator codon is designated as +1, with positive and negative integers proceeding 3′ and 5′, respectively) just behind the polyadenylation signal consensus sequence in position 4428, rather it appears to be located at least 50 nt further downstream; an alternative polyadenylation signal (AGTAAA) is found in position +4663 (Fig. 1,B and C). The p72 5′-UTR (upstream of the first in-frame AUG, the p72 translation initiation site identified previously (12Lamm G.M. Nicol S.M. Fuller-Pace F.V. Lamond A.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3739-3747Google Scholar)) verified by RT-PCR and DNA sequencing is 0.75 kb long and GC-rich (60.2%) and also corresponds to the respective continuous gene sequence. The transcription initiation site is predicted in position −772, i.e. 25 nt upstream of the 5′ end verified by RT-PCR, and just behind a weak TATA box (TATAGGA, position −798; cf. Fig. 6). Interestingly, the p72 ORF extends up to nt −243 upstream of the p72 translation initiator AUG. Inspection of the genomic sequence revealed no AUG triplet which could be used as a translation start codon in this additional part of the ORF. Furthermore, a careful analysis of the sequencing data (not shown) obtained from RT-PCR products also excluded an RNA editing event in this part of the RNA which might create an upstream AUG start codon in a relevant portion of the p72 mRNA population. Few eukaryotic mRNAs are known in which a non-AUG codon serves as translation initiation site in addition to an AUG triplet located further downstream (33Kozak M. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 563-574Google Scholar). To analyze whether the p72 5′-ORF possesses a similar capability, in vitro translation experiments were performed in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate with RNA obtained by in vitro transcription of clone 2423. This clone contains the p72 sequence from position −297 to +2125, i.e.the complete p72 ORF plus parts of its 5′- and 3′-UTRs, isolated from a HeLa λ cDNA expression library. An in vitro transcript of clone 1953 (containing the p72 cds, nt +1 to +1953) served as a control. Both transcripts were of similar quality as checked by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2A). Clone 1953 RNA was efficiently translated into a 72-kDa product, whereas clone 2423 RNA gave rise to a, albeit weaker, single polypeptide band of 82 kDa (p82; Fig. 2B). This result implied that translation had started upstream of the p72 translation initiator AUG at the beginning of the ORF at a non-AUG start codon, leading to an N-terminal extension of the p72 polypeptide of 80–90 amino acids. The low translational efficiency apparently results from the usage of a non-AUG start codon, whereas the p72 AUG start codon was not at all used for translation initiation of clone 2423 RNA in the reticulocyte lysate. This result and the absence of higher molecular weight products in the clone 1953 translation sample renders p82 generation by post-translational modification in the reticulocyte lysate unlikely. Also, translation efficiency and quality of both p72 RNAs was independent of the presence or absence of a 5′-cap structure (data not shown). Rabbit reticulocytes are highly specialized cells containing an ill-balanced translation system (34Kozak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5073-5080Google Scholar). Therefore, expression of the p72 cDNAs from clones 2423 and 1953 was analyzed b"

In contrast to alphabeta T cells, gammadelta T lymphocytes recognize small, non-protein, phosphate-bearing antigens (phosphoantigens) in a major histocompatibility complex-independent manner. Four different phosphoantigens termed TUBag1 to TUBag4 with a common 3-formyl-1-butyl-pyrophosphate moiety and isopentenyl-pyrophosphate have been isolated and identified from mycobacteria. However, natural occurring gammadelta T cell ligands from other bacterial species were not characterized so far. Here, we describe the structural identification of the two compounds responsible for the gammadelta T cell-stimulating capacity of Escherichia coli as similar to the mycobacterial phosphoantigens 3-formyl-1-butyl-pyrophosphate and its M(r) 275 homologue TUBag2. In addition, E. coli phosphoantigens exert bioactivities on gammadelta T cells with similar potencies to the mycobacterial phosphoantigens at 5-15 nm concentration. Furthermore, our results clearly prove that the deoxyxylulose 5-phophate pathway (also referred to as Rohmer metabolic route of isoprenoid biosynthesis) is essential for the biosynthesis of the phosphoantigens in E. coli. Because this pathway is absent from human cells, it proves an ideal target for focusing efficiently the antimicrobial selectivity of human gammadelta T lymphocytes."

The resulting fusion gene product, EWS/NOR1, has been believed to lead to malignant transformation by functioning as a transcriptional activator, but an alternative mechanism may also be involved.

To verify the potential function of EWS/NOR1 in mammalian cells, we next showed that overexpression of EWS/NOR1 caused increased usage of the distal 5′-splice site of pre-mRNA splicing and that EWS/NOR1 interacted with the human splicing protein U1C; neither EWS nor NOR1 had the same activity or interaction as EWS/NOR1.

NOR1belongs to the steroid receptor superfamily and transactivates target genes through the NGFI-B response element (AAAGGTCA) (9Ohkura N. Hosono T. Maruyama K. Tsukada T. Yamaguchi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1444: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The EWS fusion proteins are believed to lead to malignant transformation by functioning as transcription factors (10Ohno T. Rao V.N. Reddy E.S.

Oncogene. 1996; 12: 159-167PubMed Google Scholar) since the EWS fusion proteins share a common structural pattern in which the N-terminal domain of EWS, lacking the RNA-binding domain, is linked to the DNA-binding domain derived from one of a number of transcription factors. Thus, the RNA-binding domain of EWS is replaced by the DNA-binding domain. In addition, the EWS fusion proteins such as EWS/NOR1 (12Labelle Y. Bussieres J. Courjal F. Goldring M.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3303-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and EWS/FLI1 (13May W.A. Lessnick S.L. Braun B.S. Klemsz M. Lewis B.C. Lunsford L.B. Hromas R. Denny C.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7393-7398Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) have been shown to possess strong transcriptional activity. The systematic presence of the DNA-binding domain strongly suggests that these fusion proteins exert their oncogenic potential, at least in part, by deregulating the expression of specific target genes. However, some observations suggest that the transactivation activity of the EWS fusion proteins may not be sufficient to account for their transforming activity. 1) Modified EWS/FLI1 devoid of DNA-binding activity still retains transforming activity (14Jaishankar S. Zhang J. Roussel M.F. Baker S.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5592-5597Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). 2) The region of EWS that contributes to transactivation by EWS/FLI1 does not coincide with the domain that confers the most efficient transforming activity (15Lessnick S.L. Braun B.S. Denny C.T. May W.A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 423-431PubMed Google Scholar). 3) EWS/NOR1 binds to the same DNA response element as NOR1 (12Labelle Y. Bussieres J. Courjal F. Goldring M.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3303-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar); however, the target genes for NOR1 do not appear to be directly associated with oncogenesis, and overexpression of NOR1 in transgenic mice leads to massive apoptosis in thymocytes, not tumorigenesis (16Cheng L.E.-C. Chan F.K.-M. Cado D. Winoto A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1865-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). These observations give rise to the question of whether the fusion genes exhibit an oncogenic potential through a transcription-independent manner. To answer this question, we explored an alternative function of the EWS/NOR1 fusion protein. Using a newly developed functional complementation screening, we surveyed a potential function of the EWS/NOR1 protein in yeast and then verified the function in mammals. Here, we show that the EWS/NOR1 fusion protein gains a novel activity that affects pre-mRNA splicing. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain W303 (MATa,MATα, and MATa/α, ura3 ade2 leu2 trp1 his3) was used in this study. Yeast culture media including complex, synthetic complete, minimal sporulation, and dropout media were prepared as described previously (17Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). The yeast cells were transformed by the lithium acetate method. For induction by the inducible GAL1 promoter, the cells were grown in medium containing 2% galactose and 1% raffinose as the carbon source. Genetic manipulations were performed as described by Rose et al. (17Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). Tetrad analysis was performed using the Singer MSM manual. The human NOR1cDNA was cloned previously (18Ohkura N. Ito M. Tsukada T. Sasaki K. Yamaguchi K. Miki K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1308: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and EWS andU1C cDNAs were isolated from the human placenta cDNA library. The EWS/NOR1 fusion cDNA was generated by PCR-based techniques using the EWS andNOR1 cDNAs. The resulting fusion cDNA was identical to that found in the extraskeletal chondrosarcoma with the t(9;22) chromosomal translocation (5Clark J. Benjamin H. Gill S. Sidhar S. Goodwin G. Crew J. Gusterson B.A. Shipley J. Cooper C.S. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 229-235PubMed Google Scholar, 8Labelle Y. Zucman J. Stenman G. Kindblom L.-G. Knight J. Turc-Carel C. Dockhorn-Dworniczak B. Mandahl N. Desmaze C. Peter M. Aurias A. Delattre O. Thomas G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 2219-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The pYES2 vector (Invitrogen) was modified by introduction of the ADE2 gene at the uniqueNheI site. The resulting vector was named pYES2ADE2 (2μ ori, URA3, ADE2). To express EWS, NOR1, or EWS/NOR1 in yeast, each cDNA was inserted downstream of the GAL1 promoter in the pYES2ADE2 plasmid. FLAG-tagged expression vector pCMV-Tag2 or Myc-tagged expression vector pCMV-Tag3 (Stratagene) was used to express tagged proteins in the cultured mammalian cell line. The pEGFP-N1 vector (CLONTECH) was used to detect the EWS/NOR1 protein as a GFP1 fusion protein in mammalian cells. Wild-type yeast haploids containing the pYES2ADE2-EWS/NOR1 plasmid were mutated randomly using a chemical mutagen, ethyl methanesulfonate. After growing on synthetic complete galactose plates (complete amino acid supplements) at 30 °C, the mutants were replica-plated onto synthetic complete glucose plates and incubated at 30 °C for 3 days. The white colonies (ADE2 phenotype) on galactose plates as well as the replica-plated colonies that grew poorly on the glucose plates were selected. Isolated colonies were further tested for the plasmid requirement, viz. lethality by 5-fluoroorotic acid (a drug preventing growth of cells expressing the URA3marker) and growth on synthetic complete −Ura, −Ade, and galactose medium. Isolated clones were crossed with a wild-type haploid, and then the diploids showing a recessive phenotype (loss of galactose-dependent growth, Ade−, and Ura−) were selected. In the following stage, using meiotic mapping (tetrad analysis), mutants whose dependence was caused by a single mutation were selected. Next, the EWS/NOR1expression vector was replaced with the empty vector in diploids, and then the plasmid dependence was examined by tetrad analysis. Finally, to reduce extra mutations, mutants were crossed with a wild-type haploid and then sporulated, and tetrads were dissected. This procedure was repeated at least three times. The SNU23 gene was disrupted by a one-step replacement method. The ADE2 gene together withSNU23 flanking sequences (snu23Δ::ADE2) was generated by PCR-based techniques and transformed into a wild-type diploid strain, W303. The disruption in Ade+ transformants was confirmed by PCR and Southern blot analysis. When sporulated and dissected, this diploid snu23 strain produced only two viable spores/tetrad. The yeast mutants containing the EWS, NOR1, orEWS/NOR1 expression plasmid were grown on galactose medium at permissive temperature (23 °C) and then incubated at 27 °C for 6 h. Yeast protein extracts were prepared by the standard method using glass beads. For Western analyses, protein extracts from yeast cells were electrophoresed on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon, Millipore Corp.). Since the transactivating domain of NOR1 contains 14 consecutive amino acids of His, the NOR1 and EWS/NOR1 proteins were detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-His6 monoclonal antibody (CLONTECH). EWS was detected by anti-EWS antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-goat IgG. Protein bands were visualized using the ECL Plus Western blot analysis system (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). HEK293, COS-7, and MCF-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Transient transfections were performed with the calcium phosphate transfection kit (Edge BioSystems) or Polyfect transfection reagents (QIAGEN Inc.) according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. For visualization of GFP-tagged EWS/NOR1 protein in COS-7 cells, cells were plated onto chamber slides and transfected with the indicated GFP fusion vector. The following day, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed for 10 min in methanol at −20 °C. For subcellular fractionation, COS-7 cells that had been grown for 24 h after the transfection were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then harvested in hypotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 5 mmKCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, and one CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)/25 ml of buffer). The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was recovered as a cytoplasmic fraction. The nuclei were resuspended in nuclear extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture) and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with agitation. After centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 15 min, the supernatant was used as a nuclear fraction. FLAG-tagged EWS/NOR1 protein was detected by the anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma). For in vivo splicing analysis of E1A pre-mRNA, COS-7 cells were transfected with 7 μg of pCS3-MT-E1A and 20 μg of pCMV-Tag2 construct using Polyfect. After incubation for 30 h, the cells from one dish were lysed with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture) for Western blotting with the anti-FLAG M2 antibody. Cells from the other dish were lysed for total RNA isolation with an RNeasy column kit (QIAGEN Inc.) and then treated with DNase I. Total RNAs were reverse-transcribed with an oligo(dT) primer, and then PCR amplification of variousE1A isoforms was carried out with 5′-GAGCTTGGGCGACCTCA-3′ (RR67) as the forward primer and 5′-TCTAGACACAGGTGATGTCG-3′ (E1A2) as the reverse primer. PCR was carried out for 40 cycles of 45 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 62 °C, and 1.5 min at 72 °C, followed by a final extension for 5 min at 72 °C. COS-7 cells were seeded on 12-well plates and transfected with pCMV-AD, pCMV-BD, the reporter plasmid pFR-Luc (Stratagene), and the Renilla luciferase expression plasmid pRL-TK (Promega). After incubation for 24 h, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 150 μl of lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase assays were performed with 10 μl of cell lysis supernatant using dual-luciferase reporter reagent (Promega). Luciferase activity was normalized toRenilla luciferase activity. For expression of FLAG- or Myc-tagged proteins, 10 μg of pCMV-Tag2-FLAG expression construct and 20 μg of pCMV-Tag3-Myc expression construct were introduced into HEK293 cells in 100-mm dishes at 4 × 106 cells/dish by the calcium phosphate procedure. After incubation for 30 h, the cells were lysed with 1.2 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and CompleteTMprotease inhibitor mixture) and sonicated briefly. Anti-Myc antibody-agarose affinity gel (CLONTECH) was incubated with the lysates for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. After washing four times with phosphate-buffered saline, 100 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to the agarose beads. The samples were heated at 100 °C for 5 min; 20 μl of the sample was separated by SDS-PAGE; and the proteins were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal or anti-Myc antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). As the first step in evaluating the function of the EWS/NOR1 fusion protein in humans, we tried to identify functional counterparts of EWS/NOR1 in budding yeast (S. cerevisiae). Yeast functional complementation studies have been widely used to identify human cDNA that complements a specific yeast mutation. We also exploited functional complementation techniques, but inversely; we tried to isolate yeast mutants that are functionally complemented by the human EWS/NOR1fusion gene. First, we introduced the EWS/NOR1expression plasmid (pYES2ADE2-EWS/NOR1) (Fig.1a) into wild-type haploids and thereafter mutated the yeast genome randomly by treatment with a chemical mutagen. To identify EWS/NOR1-dependent mutants, we developed a multistage selection process for screening colonies to assess the EWS/NOR1 dependence for cell growth (Fig. 1b). Since the expression plasmid contains GAL1promoter-controlled EWS/NOR1 and the markers ofURA3 and ADE2, EWS/NOR1 dependence renders cells dependent on galactose for growth, 5-fluoroorotic acid-sensitive, and white in color, respectively. From ∼40,000 clones (200 colonies/plate × 200 plates) of the independent yeast mutants, we obtained four mutants showing plasmid- and galactose-dependent cell growth as recessive phenotypes. We further selected the mutants whose dependence was caused by a single mutation. As shown in Fig. 1c, one mutant showed a clear 2(+):2(−) segregation of the EWS/NOR1-dependent phenotype (white color, galactose-dependent growth, Ura+, and Ade+) upon tetrad analysis when crossed with the wild-type strain. This indicates that the requirement for EWS/NOR1 resulted from a single mutation or closely linked mutations. Next, we replaced the EWS/NOR1expression plasmid with the empty plasmid in the mutant diploid and tested the dependence by tetrad analysis. Two spores/tetrad from the mutant diploid containing the empty vector did not grow on synthetic complete galactose plates (data not shown), indicating that theEWS/NOR1 expression plasmid-dependent growth is not due to the dependence for plasmid sequences or galactose. Finally, we obtained only one mutant that showed recessive and temperature-sensitive phenotypes of EWS/NOR1 dependence with a 2(+):2(−) segregation upon tetrad analysis. To determine the mutated gene in the isolated mutant showing EWS/NOR1-dependent cell growth, we introduced a yeast genomic library (YEP13 vector containing wild-type yeast genomic fragments) into the mutant. From 400,000 transformants, we obtained three transformants that grew on glucose plates. Since theEWS/NOR1 expression was suppressed on glucose plates, these transformants were estimated to contain the wild-type gene corresponding to the mutated gene. Recovered plasmids from the three clones had an overlapping region, which corresponded to chromosome IV (bp 283531–293684). 2Saccharomyces Genome Data Base, genome-www.stanford.edu/ Saccharomyces/. To determine the minimal region for the recovery, we created deletion constructs and tested their rescue activity. As shown in Fig.2, the minimal region was located between bp 283531 and 286087 (construct C); and upon further deletion (bp 283531–285055; construct D), the activity was lost. Within the region between constructs C andD, one open reading frame (SNU23) existed. To test the rescue activity further, the SNU23 gene was isolated by PCR, transferred to the single copy plasmid YCp, and then tested for its activity. As expected, SNU23 in YCp (construct E) showed positive activity, indicating that the mutation is complemented by the SNU23 gene. To determine the mutation itself, we performed a PCR-based direct sequencing analysis of the SNU23 gene of the mutant yeast clone. Within chromosome IV (bp 284357–285484), which contains the promoter and coding and terminator regions of the SNU23gene, only one nucleotide mutation was found in the coding region. G at nucleotide 245 of the open reading frame was replaced with A, resulting in one amino acid replacement of Cys (TGC) with Tyr (TAC) at codon 82 (hereafter called C82Y) (Fig.3a). The replaced amino acid was located on the first Cys residue constituting the core of a zinc finger motif of Snu23p (Fig. 3b). Snu23p is classified as a small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) required for pre-mRNA splicing and has an RNA-binding activity and a C2–H2-type zinc finger motif in the middle (19Gottschalk A. Neubauer G. Banroques J. Mann M. Luhrmann R. Fabrizio P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4535-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Although Snu23p showed little amino acid homology to the EWS/NOR1 fusion protein (Fig. 3c), it showed functional similarity to EWS and structural similarity to NOR1 (Fig. 3b); NOR1 has a C2–C2-type zinc finger motif in the middle, and EWS is also classified as an RNA-binding protein. Final confirmation of the mutation was carried out in diploids (MATa/α) that consisted of the mutant haploid (MATa, snu23(C82Y)) and a snu23-null haploid (MATα,snu23Δ:: ADE2). These diploids also showed EWS/NOR1 dependence for cell growth (data not shown), indicating that no mutation other than snu23(C82Y) is involved in the dependence. Altogether, these results indicate that the human EWS/NOR1 fusion protein can complement the defect of yeast snRNP function associated with the snu23(C82Y) mutation. Although EWS/NOR1 was capable of complementing the defect associated with snu23(C82Y), we noted that the growth of the mutant was not as robust as that of the wild-type strain. Therefore, we next tested the ability of EWS/NOR1 to rescue the snu23-null yeast strain (snu23Δ::ADE2). Thesnu23-null diploids (snu23Δ::ADE2/SNU23)showed inviability of two spores/tetrad, indicating that this is a recessive lethal mutation (data not shown). As shown in Fig.4, two spores/tetrad from thesnu23(C82Y) mutant (lanes 7–12) grew slowly under the EWS/NOR1-expressed condition, but this was not the case for the snu23-null strain (snu23Δ::ADE2) (lanes 13–19). As a control, four spores/tetrad from the wild-type strain grew normally (lanes 1–6). These results indicate that EWS/NOR1 partly substitutes for the function of Snu23p, which probably depends on a zinc finger motif. We next examined the functional complementation activity of the human EWS, NOR1, or EWS/NOR1 protein in the isolated mutant (Fig. 5a). Since thesnu23(C82Y) mutation showed a temperature-sensitive phenotype, plasmid shuffling was performed at permissive temperature (23 °C). Under the conditions of gene expression (galactose medium), the mutant containing the EWS/NOR1 expression plasmid grew at nonpermissive temperature (33 °C), but full-lengthEWS or NOR1 did not rescue the lethality of the mutation. Under the suppressed condition (glucose medium), no mutants containing the EWS, NOR1, orEWS/NOR1 expression plasmid survived. Wild-type yeast cells carrying each expression plasmid grew on both galactose and glucose media at 33 °C (data not shown). The expression of each protein was confirmed by Western blotting using anti-His6or anti-EWS antibody (Fig. 5b). These results indicate that neither EWS nor NOR1 has the functional complementation activity detected in the EWS/NOR1 fusion protein. A yeast functional complementation study indicated that EWS/NOR1 had an ability to complement the defect in the function of Snu23p, one of the snRNPs. Unfortunately, a human counterpart of SNU23 was not identified in the human genetic sequence data bases, but EWS/NOR1 may also behave as an snRNP in mammalian cells. A number of RNA- and DNA-binding proteins (20Misawa K. Nosaka T. Morita S. Kaneko A. Nakahata T. Asano S. Kitamura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3062-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), including snRNPs and non-snRNP splicing factors (21Carmo-Fonseca M. Pepperkok R. Sproat B.S. Ansorge W. Swanson M.S. Lamond A.I. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1863-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), have been shown to localize to the nucleus with a granular distribution or to intranuclear foci. In contrast, EWS is detectable in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm by Western blotting (13May W.A. Lessnick S.L. Braun B.S. Klemsz M. Lewis B.C. Lunsford L.B. Hromas R. Denny C.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7393-7398Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) and shows a homogeneous nuclear distribution by immunohistochemistry (22Rossow K.L. Janknecht R. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2690-2695PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we first examined the intracellular distribution of the EWS/NOR1 protein in mammalian cells using a GFP fusion protein. When expressed in COS-7 cells, GFP-EWS/NOR1 localized within the nucleus and was excluded from nucleoli (Fig.6a). In the majority of cells, GFP-EWS/NOR1 had a granular nucleoplasmic distribution. Moreover, in a fraction of cells (5–30%), GFP-EWS/NOR1 localized in discrete intranuclear foci. Similar foci and granular distributions were seen when GFP-EWS/NOR1 was expressed in HEK293 and in the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 (data not shown), indicating that the observed distribution of GFP-EWS/NOR1 is not unique to COS-7 cells. To further confirm the intracellular distribution of EWS/NOR1, COS-7 cells were transfected with the FLAG-taggedEWS/NOR1 expression plasmid and then sequentially extracted as cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. Using Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibody, EWS/NOR1 was detected in the nuclear fraction only (Fig. 6b). These observations indicate that the intracellular distribution of the EWS/NOR1 protein shows characteristics similar to that of the DNA- or RNA-binding proteins, including snRNPs. To determine whether EWS/NOR1 directly affects pre-mRNA splicing, we next examined the effects of EWS/NOR1 on pre-mRNA splicing of the adenoviral E1A gene in COS-7 cells. Alternative splicing of E1A pre-mRNA generates three major isoforms (13 S, 12 S, and 9 S) and two minor isoforms (11 S and 10 S) (23Wang J. Manley J.L. RNA. 1995; 1: 335-346PubMed Google Scholar). In this established assay, the proteins of interest are coexpressed with an E1A minigene (pCS3-MT-E1A) (24Hallier M. Lerga A. Barnache S. Tavitian A. Moreau-Gachelin F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4838-4842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar); and thereafter, alternatively spliced isoforms of E1A are detected by reverse transcription-PCR using the primers shown in Fig.7a. In COS-7 cells transfected with pCS3-MT-E1A and empty vector, we detected 13 S and 12 S isoforms as major RNA species (Fig. 7b, lane 3), indicating that isoforms generated by proximal splice site selection are detected mainly in COS-7 cells transfected with the E1Aminigene. In contrast, overexpression of EWS/NOR1caused increased usage of the distal 5′-splice site, resulting in greatly increased levels of the 9 S isoform and decreased levels of the relative proportion of the 13 S and 12 S isoforms (lane 6). Both EWS and NOR1 had some effect on the E1A splicing profile; however, this effect was much smaller than that of EWS/NOR1 (lanes 4 and 5). The expression of EWS, NOR1, or EWS/NOR1 was confirmed by Western blotting with the anti-FLAG M2 antibody (lower panel), and all PCRs were repeated with different cycle numbers and varying amounts of input cDNA to verify the results. The identity of the amplified products obtained by reverse transcription-PCR analysis was confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis and Southern blotting with a 32P-labeled E1Aprobe (data not shown). These results indicate that EWS/NOR1 affects 5′-splice site selection of the E1A minigene and that neither EWS nor NOR1 has this activity. In vivo splicing assay indicates that EWS/NOR1 may affect 5′-splice site selection of pre-mRNA splicing. The key protein for 5′-splice site recognition has been shown to be the U1 snRNP particle (25Eperon I.C. Makarova O.V. Mayeda A. Munroe S.H. Caceres J.F. Hayward D.G. Krainer A.R. Mol. Cell.

Hinterberger M. Mimori T. Gottlieb E. Steitz J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5907-5914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the N terminus of EWS has been shown to interact with the splicing protein U1C in vitro (28Knoop L.L. Baker S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24865-24871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), we next examined whether EWS/NOR1 interacts with U1C in mammalian cells. To examine the intercellular association between EWS/NOR1 and U1C, we used the mammalian two-hybrid system, which allows detection of protein-protein interactions by activation of reporter gene expression in mammalian cells. We fused full-length EWS, NOR1, or EWS/NOR1 to the transcriptional activation domain of NF-κB and fused U1C to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4. We transfected these plasmids along with a GAL4-responsive l"

To evaluate the roles of nucleotide inhibition versusstimulation, we compared KIR6.1-based KNDPchannels with KIR6.2-based KATP channels and all possible KIR6.1/6.2 hybrids.

KIR6.1 is, however, more efficiently stimulated by SUR than KIR6.2, thus providing a mechanism for differential nucleotide regulation, in addition to the known differential interactions of Mg-nucleotides with SUR isoforms.

Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 667-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), expressed in a variety of different cell types, are unique complexes in which channel gating is controlled by ATP-binding cassette (ABC)1 proteins, SURs. The KIR6.0 subunits are thought to form KcsA-like pores (2Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5649) Google Scholar) surrounded by a quartet of SURs, which interact with nucleotides, inhibitory sulfonylureas, and selective KATP channel openers to modulate channel activity (see Ref. 3Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 717-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar for a discussion of the functional topology of SURs). These channels are abundant and metabolically driven changes in the [Mg-ATP] ↔ [MgADP] equilibrium can regulate their low PO activity stabilizing the resting potential of high input impedance cells, e.g.neurons, smooth muscle, and endocrine cells, and shortening the action potentials of cardiac and skeletal myocytes with lower membrane resistance. The primary signaling mechanism that attunes the PO to the cellular metabolic status remains controversial. Observations that KATP channels burst spontaneously in inside-out patches and show reversible inhibition by submillimolar ATP (4Noma A. Nature. 1983; 305: 147-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1956) Google Scholar, 5Trube G. Hescheler J. Pflugers Arch. 1984; 401: 178-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 6Cook D.L. Hales C.N. Nature. 1984; 311: 271-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar) suggested that opening these KIRs in vivo, in the face of millimolar nucleotide, would necessitate a significant decrease in their sensitivity to ATP. The reduction in the ATP sensitivity of isolated KATP channels upon treatment with numerous substances has been interpreted as evidence for the plasticity of ATP-inhibitory gating in vivo. Following the report (7Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar) that ATP weakly inhibits KIR6.2-based channels in the absence of SUR (IC50(ATP) = ∼0.2 mmversus∼5–20 μm with SURs; Refs. 8Babenko A.P.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), KIR-based plasticity of ATP inhibition has been considered a possible cause of the variable activity observed for KATPchannel isoforms in situ. An alternative idea is that SURs, obligatory regulatory subunits of KATP channels and members of the ABC superfamily (10Aguilar-Bryan L. Nichols C.G. Wechsler S.W. Clement IV, J.P. Boyd III, A.E. Gonzalez G. Herrera-Sosa H. Nguy K. Bryan J. Nelson D.A. Science. 1995; 268: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar, 11Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement IV, J.P. Namba N. Inazawa J. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Seino S. Bryan J. Science. 1995; 270: 1166-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar), act as nucleotide sensors and, in vivo, SURs would exert a Mg-ADP/ATP-dependent stimulatory action sufficient to overcome the saturated inhibitory effect of nucleotides at noncanonical nucleotide binding site(s) on the KIR (1Babenko A.P. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 667-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is consistent with only a small fraction, ∼1%, of the maximal NPO for KATP channel population participating in the regulation of insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells (12Cook D.L. Satin L.S. Ashford M.L. Hales C.N. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) or shortening of action potentials of metabolically inhibited ventricular cardiomyocytes (13Babenko A.P. Samoilov V.O. Kazantseva S.T. Basic Appl. Myology. 1991; 2: 316-323Google Scholar, 14Faivre J.F. Findlay I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1029: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The hypothesis is consistent with the marginal effect of a decreased submembrane concentration of ATP on KATP channel activity in situ, e.g.the enhancement of KATP currents observed when adenylyl cyclases are maximally stimulated, thus reducing ATP without producing stimulatory MgADP, in cardiomyocytes dialyzed with submillimolar ATP, but not in the perforated patch or conventional whole-cell configuration with millimolar [ATP]i (15Babenko A. Vassort G. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 589-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The physiologic significance of the Mg-nucleotide-dependent stimulation of KIR6.2 has been established by the identification of SUR1 mutations that compromise the stimulatory, but not the inhibitory action of Mg-nucleotides on pancreatic β-cell KATP channels (16Nichols C.G. Shyng S.L. Nestorowicz A. Glaser B. Clement IV, J.P. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Permutt M.A. Bryan J. Science. 1996; 272: 1785-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), thus eliminating their short burst activity in situ and causing persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (17Dunne M.J. Kane C. Shepherd R.M. Sanchez J.A. James R.F. Johnson P.R. Aynsley-Green A. Lu S. Clement IV, J.P. Lindley K.J. Seino S. Aguilar-Bryan L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 703-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The lower unitary conductance (g) KIR6.1-based “KNDP” channels are reported to require Mg-nucleotide diphosphates for activity and show poor sensitivity to ATP (18Beech D.J. Zhang H. Nakao K. Bolton T.B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 110: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), suggesting their nucleotide-sensing mechanism might be distinct from that of KIR6.2-based channels (19Ammala C. Moorhouse A. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 494: 709-714Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 20Yamada M. Isomoto S. Matsumoto S. Kondo C. Shindo T. Horio Y. Kurachi Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 499: 715-720Crossref Scopus (334) Google Scholar). This fostered the idea that the basal activity of KNDP channels in intact cells was a result of their poor interaction with inhibitory ATP and that heteromultimerization of KIR6.0 tetramers might generate novel ATP-inhibitory machinery. However, mutations that produce the largest increase in IC50(ATP) without affecting the spontaneous PO of KIR6.2-based channels (21Drain P. Li L. Wang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 31563-31566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition, spontaneously active hybrid channels containing KIR6.1 and at least one KIR6.2 show KATP channel-like inhibition by ATP (24Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G.C. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31563-31566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), indicating both KIRs sense inhibitory nucleotides via a common mechanism, but respond differentially to the Mg-nucleotide-dependent stimulatory action of SUR. These results are consistent with dual, separable, stimulatory, and inhibitory effects of Mg-nucleotides on both channels (see also Ref.25Satoh E. Yamada M. Kondo C. Repunte V.P. Horio Y. Iijima T. Kurachi Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 511: 663-674Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). An unambiguous analysis of ATP inhibition of KIR6.1-based channels requires measurable activity in the absence of stimulatory Mg-nucleotides and openers, ideally on a pore that has not been mutated. Here we describe first, the use of complimentary approaches to obtain spontaneously bursting KIR6.1-based channels, without pore mutations, and determine their steady-state, Mg-independent sensitivity to inhibitory ATP. Analyses of KNDP transients induced by rapid wash-out of Mg-ATP were used to verify that nucleotide-inhibitory and stimulatory gating are separable in KIR6.1/SUR1 channels. Second, SUR-containing channels, the same channels in cell-attached and inside-out configurations, were used to compare the efficiency of the Mg-ATP(ADP)-dependent stimulation of KIR6.1 versus KIR6.2-based channelsin situ. Third, KIR6.1/6.2 concatemers were used to establish the basic properties of all possible hybrid KATP channels. Finally, we examined single-channel patches of native cells to determine whether hybrid KIR6.0-based channels are physiologically relevant. The generation of cDNA constructs and their expression in COSm6 cells have been described (23Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Human cardiac myocytes were isolated from specimens of myocardium taken from six patients, aged 6–44 years, during cardiac surgery involving atrial appendage, as described previously for isolation of human ventricular cells (26Babenko A.P. Samoilov V.O. Kazantseva S.T. Shevchenko Y.L. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 148-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), except a 2-fold lower concentration of Pronase E was used. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were isolated and cultured as described previously (27Korichneva I. Puceat M. Cassoly R. Vassort G. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 556-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Patch-clamp recordings were done as described previously (23Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 24Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G.C. Bryan J. J. Biol.

Res. 1998; 83: 1132-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The pipette solution contained (in mm): KCl, 145; MgCl2, 1; CaCl2, 1; HEPES, 10; pH 7.4 (KOH). The bath, “intracellular” solution contained (in mm): KCl, 140; MgCl2, 1; EGTA, 5; HEPES, 5; KOH, 10; pH 7.2 (KOH). The [Mg2+]iwas kept at a quasi-cytosolic level of ∼0.7 mm by adding MgCl2. The Mg2+-free internal solution contained (in mm): KCl, 140; EDTA, 5; HEPES, 5; KOH, 10; pH 7.2 (KOH). The holding potential was −40 mV unless otherwise noted. In all figures, the vertical arrow indicates isolation of an inside-out patch, and the horizontal dotted line gives the level where all KIR6.0-containing channels are closed. 2′-(or 3′)-O-(Trinitrophenyl)-ATP (TNP-ATP), ATP-[γ]4-azidoanilide (ATP-γAA) were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR) and ALT, Inc. (Lexington, KY), respectively. Other nucleotides, diazoxide, and glibenclamide were from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc. Solutions were exchanged within 2 ms, and the patch currents were recorded at 2–10 kHz (digitized at 20–100 kHz) to determine the unitary conductance, g, single-channel kinetics, and nucleotide dose responses. The mean PO was estimated from all-points single-channel current amplitude histograms and/or calculated from macrocurrents by fitting the equation: PO = 1 − ς2*I−1*i−1, where ς2, I, and i are the KATP current variance, their mean, and the single-channel current amplitude, respectively. Estimation of the intraburst, but not interburst, kinetics from multiple-channel current traces showing a single level openings is valid and allowed comparative analysis of the τO and τCf for KATPversus KNDP in the presence of ∼0.1versus 1 mm Mg-ATP. The differences in averaged values (expressed/plotted as mean ± S.D.) with p< 0.05 were considered significant. COSm6 cells expressing KIR6.1/SUR1 or KIR6.2/SUR1 channels were perifused with the oxidative phosphorylation uncoupler, carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoro-methoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP, 0.5 μm) in substrate-free, K+-rich bath solution to zero the resting potential, as described previously (28Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 1132-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This method induces a less steep rise in the activity of KATPchannels compared with using millimolar azide, cyanide plus rotenone or 2-deoxyglucose, thus allowing measurements of the mean NPOunder conditions of quasi-steady-state [Mg-ADP]/[ATP]. KIR6.1/SUR1, unlike KIR6.2/SUR1 channels, displayed substantial steady-state activity in cell-attached, but not excised patches, in nucleotide-free solution (Fig. 1). KIR6.1-containing channels could be maximally activated by 10 mm MgUDP and displayed substantial activity in the presence of a quasi-cytosolic concentration of MgATP (1 mm). This activity was strongly increased by addition of 0.2 mm Mg-ADP, conditions that simulate severe metabolic inhibition. Similar observations have been interpreted as poor sensitivity to inhibitory ATP (19Ammala C. Moorhouse A. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 494: 709-714Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 20Yamada M. Isomoto S. Matsumoto S. Kondo C. Shindo T. Horio Y. Kurachi Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 499: 715-720Crossref Scopus (334) Google Scholar). However, physiologic concentrations of Mg-ATP reduced the KNDP currents activated by Mg-UDP (Fig. 1, bottom trace), which exerted only a weak inhibitory action on KIR6.2/SUR1 channels (29Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, upper trace). Rapid wash-out of millimolar MgATP from inside-out patches with “fast” diffusion access induced KIR6.1/SUR1 current transients (24Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G.C. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31563-31566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) not resolved in patches with “slow” access (Fig. 1, middle versus bottom trace). The fast deactivation of KNDP channels was not the result of a KIR6.1-specific “ultrarapid run-down” (19Ammala C. Moorhouse A. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 494: 709-714Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar), as completely deactivated KIR6.1/SUR1 channels are reopened by MgUDP (24Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G.C. Bryan J. J. Biol.

J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1987; 391: 611-629Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The rapid decay of the transient reflects a requirement for stimulatory Mg-nucleotide(s) to overcome the greater stability of the long-lived closed state(s) of KNDP versusKATP channels, both of which spontaneously inactivate in inside-out patches with a time constant of ∼102 s. The transients could be accounted for by a difference in the off-rate constants for inhibitory versus stimulatory Mg-nucleotides. The unbinding of inhibitory nucleotide from the KIR was rapid and the rise of the transient, like the instantaneous KIR6.2 currents induced by wash-out of ATP, appeared to be “diffusion-limited,” whereas release of stimulatory nucleotide(s) from SUR1 was slower. In support of this explanation, the fastest rates of rise were seen in transients whose peak currents, upon removal of saturating Mg-ATP (10 mm), approached the maximal currents seen in 10 mm MgUDP (in eight different patches). The additional observations that the steady-state NPO values before removal of 1 mm MgATP were <10% of the peak transient NPO values (see, for example, Fig. 1,middle trace) and that removal of submillimolar (0.1 or 0.3 mm) Mg-ATP from two fast patches induced approximately a 10-fold transient increase in the NPO, further argue that, rather than KNDP channels being poorly sensitive to ATP, their IC50 for inhibition by Mg-ATP is below 10−4m. Analyses of the single-channel transients (Fig.2) confirmed that KNDPchannels were sensitive to submillimolar ATP and demonstrated that their nucleotide- and (Vm-EK)-sensitive gating kinetics were separable, as shown previously for KATPchannels (23Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In 0.3 mm MgATP, the PO of a single KIR6.1/SUR1 channel was very low and rapid wash-out of nucleotide induced a burst of openings (Fig. 2A). The integral current constructed from a number of sweeps resembled a macrocurrent transient. The results imply that the off-rate constants for release of the inhibitory nucleotides were greater than those for stimulatory Mg-nucleotides; thus, the unbinding of ATP from the inhibitory sites was faster. The stimulatory nucleotide(s) and Mg2+ that remain bound to SUR in the absence of inhibitory ATP promoted the gating transitions that initiate bursts. The eventual nucleotide release from SURs prevented re-entry into a burst, leaving the channel in a nonconducting conformation. We determined, for the first time, the “intrinsic” mean open (τO) and intraburst closed (τCf) times of KIR6.1-based channels in nucleotide-free solution from these single-channel recordings during a transient (Fig.2C). The Vm-dependent intraburst dwell times were negligibly affected by varying mixtures and concentrations of nucleotides, which specified markedly different PO values by modulating theVm-independent interburst kinetics (Fig.2B). These results show that inhibition of native KIR6.1-based channels, in the presence of a physiologic concentration of Mg2+, occurred via nucleotide binding to a site with a submillimolar KD, which controls gating transitions that are independent of the K+ driving force. Similar conclusions have been presented for KIR6.2-based channels (23Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), thus arguing the ligand-gating mechanism of these KIRs is the same even though the intrinsic stability of their closed tetramers is different. To demonstrate unambiguously the KATP-like ATP inhibition of KNDP channels in the absence of Mg2+, we developed two complementary approaches to induce spontaneous bursting of KIR6.1-based channels. The first approach utilized our finding that short deletions from the N termini of KIR6.2 tetramers does not affect their functional properties and will decrease the occupancy of the interburst closed state of KIR6.2/SUR1 channels in the absence of nucleotides (23Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Deletion of the 2nd through the 5th residues of KIR6.1 produced low activity, PO∼ 10−2, ΔNKIR6.1/SUR1 channels after wash-out of nucleotides. ΔN8KIR6.1/SUR1 channels exhibited greater spontaneous activity (Fig.3A) and displayed current transients upon rapid isolation of an inside-out patch or upon MgATP wash-out. The NPO values, of the same channels, determined in the “on-cell” configuration and after excision in 1 mm MgATP, or 0.1 mm ATP without Mg2+, were comparable. Together the results, demonstrate that truncation of KIR6.1, like KIR6.2 (29Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), does not compromise the response to Mg-nucleotide-dependent stimulation by SUR1. Stimulation was more efficient for ΔNKIR6.1- versusΔNKIR6.2-containing channels, saturating at ≥10 mm (as seen for intact KNDP in Fig. 1,bottom trace). The observation that 1 mm MgATP decreased steady-state currents following the increase induced by 10 mm MgATP indicates that the inhibitory action of MgATP is saturated at physiological concentrations, whereas its stimulatory action is not. After wash-out of Mg2+, the spontaneous activity of ΔN8KIR6.1/SUR1 channels was markedly reduced by 0.1 mm ATP, consistent with an apparent KDfor inhibitory ATP of <10−4m. Progressively larger deletions, ΔN13, ΔN21, and ΔN33, increased the PO(max) with an apparent saturation of the effect by ΔN33. Although spontaneously active, the ΔNKIR6.1/SUR1 channel PO(max) values are low in comparison with ΔNKIR6.2/SUR1 channels. Determination of the inhibitory ATP dose-response curves for a series of ΔNKIR6.1versus ΔNKIR6.2-containing channels in the absence of Mg2+ demonstrates that the “longer” channels exhibit lower IC50(ATP) values and that comparable length ΔNKIR6.1- and ΔNKIR6.2-containing channels have indistinguishable IC50(ATP) values despite as much as a 50-fold difference in occupation of their interburst closed states. The results are presented as logarithmic plots of the POvalues from individual patches versus [ATP] fit with pseudo-Hill curves (Fig. 3B). The IC50(ATP) for ΔN5KIR6.1/SUR1 is ∼10−5m; using this approach, an extrapolated value for full-length KIR6.1/SUR1 channels is ∼5–10 μm. A second approach to obtain measurable spontaneous activity from KIR6.14/SUR14 channels comes from our recent observation that concatenated KIR6.2-2-2-2/SUR14 channels exhibit an increased PO(max) (24Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G.C. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31563-31566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). From a survey of a large number of patches, we obtained inside-out membrane fragments that contained >102 concatenated KIR6.1-1-1-1/SUR14 channels and had negligible background currents. These patches were used to characterize the low PO(max) activity of concatemeric channels in Mg-free internal solution (Fig. 4A) and demonstrate they are reversibly inhibited by ATP with an IC50(ATP) value of ∼10−5m, consistent with the IC50(ATP) values estimated above and indistinguishable from those of similarly concatenated, although more active, KIR6.24/SUR14 channels (24Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G.C. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31563-31566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The availability of spontaneously active KIRs allowed a direct, unambiguous comparison of the inhibition of KNDPversus KATP channels by different nucleotide triphosphates. Inhibition of native KATP channels gave a rank order of effectiveness of ATP ∼ ATPγS > GTP (30Findlay I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1987; 391: 611-629Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar,31Findlay I. Pflugers Arch. 1988; 412: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), suggesting the importance of the adenine ring. We observed that 8-azido-ATP, with its bulky substitution on the adenine ring, was ∼10-fold less effective than ATP as an inhibitor of KIR6.2/SUR1 channels, although it has a similar affinity for SUR (32Babenko A.P. Bryan J. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: A114Google Scholar, 33Matsuo M. Kioka N. Amachi T. Ueda K. J. Biol.

ATP-γAA is poorly recognized by SUR, but inhibits homomeric KIR6.2 channels as effectively as ATP (35Tanabe K. Tucker S.J. Ashcroft F.M. Proks P. Kioka N. Amachi T. Ueda K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We compared the dose-response curves of these ATP analogs, and TNP-ATP, from spontaneously active KIR6.1-1-1-1/SUR14and KIR6.2-2-2-2/SUR14 channels (Fig.4B). The 8-azido-group on the adenine ring reduced the inhibitory effectiveness of ATP on both channel types, whereas neither the bulkier azidoanilide group on the γ-phosphate nor the TNP group on the ribose ring significantly affected the IC50 values. In addition, single concentration tests on the same patch suggest a similar rank order of effectiveness, ATP > GTP > UTP, for KIR6.1-1-1-1/SUR14 and KIR6.2-2-2-2/SUR14 channels (three independent experiments each; Fig. 4C). The results show that the gating machinery of KIR6.1 and KIR6.2 is controlled by similar noncanonical, adenine-selective, inhibitory nucleotide-binding sites. The KIR6.2-like ATP-sensitivity of KIR6.1 channels can be reconciled with their higher activity in situ (compare currents before patch excision in Fig. 1, top versus middle traces) if KIR6.1 is more responsive to the Mg-nucleotide-dependent stimulatory action of SUR. The activity of KNDP channels in intact cells was comparable with that observed in inside-out patches in a quasi-cytosolic concentration of Mg-ATP, or in a 10-fold lower concentration of ATP without Mg2+ (Fig. 1, middle trace, and Fig. 3A), revealing a substantial stimulation of KIR6.1/SUR1 channels by Mg-ATP. The nucleotide stimulatory action saturates at a much higher concentration of ATP than inhibition, and was more efficient for ΔNKIR6.1- versusΔNKIR6.2 channels as shown in Fig. 3 (this comparison is valid, as N-terminal truncation did not alter the stimulatory action of nucleotides). Moreover, 0.2 mm MgADP added to 1 mm MgATP stimulated KIR6.1/SUR1 channels >7-fold, whereas the same concentration of MgADP, applied to KATP channels whose PO was preset to a value close to that of KNDP channels by varying the concentration of MgATP, stimulated KIR6.2/SUR1 channels <3 times (5versus 5 patches; see an example in Fig. 1). The τO and τCf values of KNDPversus KATP channels were comparable irrespective of a 10-fold difference in the concentration of Mg-ATP (1.69 ± 0.27 versus 2.16 ± 0.38 ms, and τCf 0.21 ± 0.03 versus 0.25 ± 0.03 ms, filtered at 5 kHz, respectively; 3 versus 3 patches). Further evidence for more efficient stimulation of KIR6.1-based channels by adenine nucleotides in nondisrupted cells, where the concentrations of ATP and ADP (and thus their ratio) are expected to be comparable, was obtained by measuring the activity of KNDP versus KATPchannels in on-cell patches upon poisoning with the metabolic inhibitor, FCCP (see “Experimental Procedures”). The normalized increases in NPO, for similar duration of FCCP perifusion, were larger for KIR6.1-based channels (Fig.5A). The KATP opener, diazoxide, strongly stimulated KNDP currents even in the presence of 10 mmMg-ATP (the highest accurately testable concentration) where KATP currents were practically immeasurable. In patches with a high density of KATP channels, which is required to obtain accurately measurable currents at a physiologic concentration of MgATP, diazoxide (300 μm) induced a greater than 3-fold increase in the activity of KIR6.1/SUR1 versusKIR6.2/SUR1 channels in 3 mm MgATP (Fig.5B). This test, using subsaturating concentrations of either stimulatory ligand, provides an additional line of evidence that S"

We analyzed effects of the Cys-67 → Ser mutation on cell surface expression, peptide specificity, and T-cell recognition of HLA-B*2705. Surface expression was assessed with antibodies recognizing either native or unfolded HLA proteins. Whereas native B*2705 molecules predominated over unfolded ones, this ratio was reversed in the mutant, suggesting lower stability. Comparison of B*2705- and Cys-67 → Ser-bound peptides revealed that the mutant failed to bind ∼15% of the B*2705 ligands, while binding as many novel ones. Two peptides with Gln-2 found in both B*2705 and Cys-67 → Ser are the first demonstration of natural B*2705 ligands lacking Arg-2. Other effects of the mutation on peptide specificity were: 1) average molecular mass of natural ligands higher than for B*2705, 2) bias against small residues at peptide position (P) 1, and 3) increased P2 permissiveness. The results suggest that the Cys-67 → Ser mutation weakens B pocket interactions, leading to decreased stability of the mutant-peptide complexes. This may be partially compensated by interactions involving bulky P1 residues. The effect of the mutation on allorecognition was consistent with that on peptide specificity. Our results may aid understanding of the pathogenetic role of HLA-B27 in spondyloarthropathy."

For the recurrent initiation of Okazaki fragment synthesis in most prokaryotes, the requisite RNA primers are provided by DNA primase activity at specific DNA sequences on the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)1template generated by DNA helicase activity during leading strand DNA synthesis (2Frick D.N.

The N-terminal primase fragment synthesizes oligoribonucleotides as efficiently as the full-length protein does in the absence of dTTP. However, the primase activity of the full-length gene 4 protein is stimulated by dTTP, a consequence of the helicase domain to which it is tethered (17Frick D.N. Baradaran K. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7957-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Because the primase domain binds weakly to ssDNA, it can be tethered to DNA via the hexameric helicase domain, resulting in a stimulation of primer synthesis (19Frick D.N. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35889-35898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition, on large DNA molecules the translocation activity of the helicase serves to transport the primase domain to primase recognition sites (20Kusakabe T. Baradaran K. Lee J. Richardson C.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1542-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Finally, at least a portion of the helicase domain is required for interaction of the protein with T7 DNA polymerase for extension of the tetraribonucleotide primer by T7 DNA polymerase (17Frick D.N.

Although a three-dimensional structure is not yet available for the T7 DNA primase domain of gene 4 protein, crystal structures of portions of other prokaryotic DNA primases in the same family have been obtained (22Pan H.

A comparison of the amino acid sequence of gene 4 protein with DNA primases from bacteria and bacteriophages has revealed considerable homology within the primase family (25Ilyina T.V. Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 34: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The sequence alignment suggests there are six conserved motifs, indicated as motifs I through VI in Fig. 1 (see below). The most striking homology is found in motif I, which contains the Cys4 zinc motif. The crystal structure of the zinc motif of the primase of Bacillus stearothermophilus has shown that it is a member of the zinc ribbon subfamily of zinc binding motifs such as that found in the yeast RNA polymerase II subunit 9 (22Pan H. Wigley D.B. Struct. Fold Des. 2000; 8: 231-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Gene 4 protein contains 1 g atom of zinc per mole of gene 4 protein (26Mendelman L.V.

In vitromutagenesis of residues in this region as well as studies with chimeric T7 primases have demonstrated a role of the zinc motif in recognition of the trinucleotide sequence 5′-GTC-3′ (27Kusakabe T.

Interestingly, a truncated species of gene 4 protein lacking the zinc motif is found in phage-infected cells in approximately equal molar amounts with the full-length gene 4 protein (29Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 477-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). The two co-linear proteins are translated from separate in-frame translational start sites (29Dunn J.J.

The smaller 56-kDa protein lacks the N-terminal 63-amino acid residues found in the full-length protein. The 56-kDa protein is unable to catalyze template-directed oligoribonucleotide synthesis but has full helicase activity (31Bernstein J.A. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The 56-kDa gene 4 protein can catalyze the synthesis of random diribonucleotides at a very low rate (31Bernstein J.A. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This observation also places the catalytic site for phosphodiester bond synthesis in the interior region of the primase domain. In addition to the zinc motif that is conserved among prokaryotic primases, several other conserved sequence motifs are clustered in the central region of the primase domain (motifs II through VI). No role has been assigned to motif II but several residues within the remaining motifs appear to be critical for NTP binding and phosphodiester bond formation. Overlapping motif III is a charged, basic region found in several large subunits of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic RNA polymerases (35Versalovic J. Lupski J.R. Gene. 1993; 136: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Motifs IV, V, and VI have been implicated in the coordination of the NTP substrates and divalent metal cations necessary for catalysis (36Strack B. Lessl M. Calendar R. Lanka E. J. Biol.

The x-ray crystal structure of the RNA polymerase domain of the Escherichia coli primase, containing motifs II through VI, shows that the residues that are strictly conserved in all bacterial DnaG proteins cluster around the central crevice of the protein (23Keck J.L.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3761-3767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is one of the residues that can be cross-linked to NTP analogs (41Mustaev A.A. Godson G.N. J. Biol.

Leipe D.D. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4205-4213Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). To date, only the effect of alterations in the zinc motif of gene 4 protein on primase activity has been examined. As discussed above, elimination of the zinc motif, for instance, as in the 56-kDa gene 4 protein, abolishes DNA-dependent primase activity but not the ability to synthesize random diribonucleotides (31Bernstein J.A. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Less drastic changes, such as the substitution of any of the four cysteines of the zinc motif with serines, are lethal. One of the altered primases has been shown to lack primase activity (26Mendelman L.V. Beauchamp B.B. Richardson C.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3909-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Mutations in the loop structure of the zinc motif and the adjacent region affect the recognition of the trinucleotide recognition sequence (27Kusakabe T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol.

In the present study we have identified two essential lysines near motif III in the basic region of the RNA polymerase subdomain of gene 4 protein. The purified altered primases are defective in phosphodiester bond synthesis but not in their ability to identify primase recognition sites and to transfer a functional primer to T7 DNA polymerase. Oligonucleotides were obtained from the Biopolymer Laboratory at Harvard Medical School. Restriction endonucleases, alkaline phosphatase, Deep Vent polymerase, and M13mp18 ssDNA were purchased from New England BioLabs. T7 polynucleotide kinase, T4 DNA ligase, radiolabeled nucleotides, and high molecular weight protein size markers were purchased from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. Agarose and β,γ-methylene dTTP were from United States Biochemical Corp. Polyethyleneimine cellulose thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates were from J. T. Baker. E. coli strain DH5α was from Invitrogen and HMS 174(DE3) was from Novagen. T7 DNA polymerase (T7 gene 5 protein-E. colithioredoxin complex) was kindly provided by Donald Johnson (Harvard Medical School). pET24gp4–63 was constructed by David Frick (Harvard Medical School) by inserting a gene 4-coding DNA fragment into pET 24a (Novagen) between HindIII andNdeI sites. In this gene 4-coding plasmid, the internal start codon at position 64 was replaced with the codon for glycine to avoid co-production of the 56-kDa gene 4 protein (43Mendelman L.V. Notarnicola S.M. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10638-10642Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The gene 4 protein-M64G contains all the catalytic properties of gene 4 protein encoded by wild-type T7 phage (44Mendelman L.V. Notarnicola S.M. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27208-27213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is referred as the 63-kDa wild-type gene 4 protein throughout this study. Mutations were introduced into this plasmid by overlap extension PCR in two steps (45Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2227-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The first round of PCR was performed with a pair of primers consisting of a mutagenic primer carrying a single mutation and an outside primer. Resulting PCR products were purified on a 1% agarose gel and were used as templates for the second round of PCR with a pair of outside primers. Products from the second PCR were digested with both ApaI and BstBI, and ligated with pET24gp4–63 previously cut with the same restriction enzymes. Mutated plasmids were transformed into E. coli DH5α, and the gene 4-coding regions were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Recombinant gene 4 proteins were purified following procedures described previously with the indicated modifications (47Notarnicola S.M. Richardson C.C. J. Biol.

E. coli strain HMS 174(DE3), which contains the gene 4 protein-expressing plasmid, was grown to an A600 of 1 in LB medium. Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. The cells were cultured for three additional hours, and were then harvested by centrifugation. Harvested cells were resuspended in buffer L (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and were subjected to three cycles of freezing and thawing in the presence of 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme. The lysed cells were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min, and polyethylene glycol (Fluka, PEG4000) was added to a final concentration of 10%. The PEG pellet was collected by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 20 min, resuspended in buffer P (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 10% glycerol), and loaded onto a phosphocellulose column (Whatman). Protein was eluted with a KCl gradient from 0.02 to 1 m, and fractions containing gene 4 protein were combined. Fractions containing gene 4 protein were identified by gel analysis of an aliquot of each fraction. After the addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 10 mm, the pooled fractions were loaded onto an ATP-agarose affinity column (Sigma Chemical Co.) and eluted with buffer AE (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 20 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 0.5 m KCl). In some cases, altered gene 4 proteins were purified using DEAE-Sephacel chromatography (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Pooled protein from the phosphocellulose column was dialyzed against buffer D (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 10% glycerol) and loaded onto a DEAE-Sephacel column. The protein was eluted with a NaCl gradient from 0.2 to 0.7m, and the fractions containing gene 4 protein (0.45 to 0.55 m NaCl fractions) were combined. Finally, the purified protein was dialyzed against storage buffer (20 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm DTT, 0.1 mmEDTA, 50% glycerol) and stored at −20 °C until use. The de novo synthesis of oligoribonucleotides catalyzed by the gene 4 primase was determined by measuring the incorporation of radioactively labeled CTP into oligoribonucleotides using a synthetic DNA template containing a primase recognition site (15Mendelman L.V.

The reaction (10 μl) included the indicated amount of template (5′-GGGTCAA-3′), 0.1 mm each of ATP and CTP, and 0.1 μCi of [α-32P]CTP, 80 nm (monomeric concentration) gene 4 protein, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm DTT, and 50 mmpotassium glutamate. After incubation at 37 °C for 20 min, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 3 μl of sequencing dye (98% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.1% xylene cyanol FF, and 0.1% bromphenol blue) and loaded onto a 25% denaturing polyacrylamide sequencing gel containing 3 m urea. Radioactive oligoribonucleotide products were analyzed using a Fuji BAS 1000 Bioimaging analyzer. Gene 4 primase can catalyze the synthesis of random diribonucleotide at a slow rate in the absence of a DNA template (28Kusakabe T. Hine A.V. Hyberts S.G. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The reaction mixture (10 μl) contained 0.1 mm of the indicated NTP, 0.1 μCi of [α-32P]CTP, 160 nm gene 4 protein, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MnCl2, 10 mm DTT, and 50 mm potassium glutamate. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the reaction was continued in the presence of 2 units of alkaline phosphatase for 20 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 3 μl of sequencing dye, and the products were separated on a 25% denaturing polyacrylamide sequencing gel containing 3 murea. Gene 4 protein can catalyze the extension of the 5′-rAC-3′ or 5′-rACC-3′ at primase recognition sites on a template in the presence of the appropriate NTPs (16Kusakabe T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12446-12453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was as described above for the primase oligoribonucleotide synthesis assay except that the indicated concentration of 5′-rAC-3′ or 5′-rACC-3′ replaced ATP. The reaction was carried out and analyzed as described in the assay for primase oligoribonucleotide synthesis. The ability of gene 4 protein to prime DNA synthesis catalyzed by T7 DNA polymerase on M13 ssDNA was measured as previously described (10Nakai H. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9818-9830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kusakabe T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol.

The reaction (10 μl) contained 9.8 nm M13 ssDNA (molecular concentration of DNA), 0.3 mm of all four dNTPs, 0.1 μCi of [α-32P]dGTP, 80 nm gene 4 protein, 20 nm T7 DNA polymerase, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, and 50 mm potassium glutamate. The RNA primer was either synthesized de novo from 0.1 mm each of ATP and CTP, or extended from 0.1 mm each of diribonucleotide rAC and CTP, or supplied by the addition of 0.01 mmof the tetraribonucleotide rACCC. After incubation for 10 min at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 20 mm. Half of the reaction was spotted onto a DE-81 membrane (Whatman). The amount of radioactively synthesized DNA was determined by measuring the radioactive products retained on the membrane after washing the membrane three times with 10 ml of 0.3 m ammonium formate (pH 8.0). Gene 4 protein catalyzes the ssDNA-dependent hydrolysis of dTTP, a reaction coupled to its translocation on ssDNA (8Matson S.W. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14009-14016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction (10 μl) contained the indicated concentration of dTTP, 0.1 μCi of [α-32P]dTTP, 1.1 nm M13 ssDNA, 80 nm gene 4 protein, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, and 50 mm potassium glutamate. After incubation at 37 °C for 20 min, the reactions were terminated by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 25 mm. The reaction mixture was spotted onto a polyethyleneimine cellulose TLC plate. The TLC plate was developed with a solution containing 1 m formic acid and 0.8 m LiCl. The TLC plate was analyzed using a Fuji BAS 1000 Bioimaging analyzer. DNA binding affinity of gene 4 protein was measured by nitrocellulose (NC) filter binding. The reaction (10 μl) containing 1 nm 5′-end-radiolabeled DNA (5′-A10CTGGG-3′), 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, and 50 mm potassium glutamate was incubated with various amounts of gene 4 protein in the presence of 1 mm non-hydrolyzable β,γ-methylene dTTP for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction mixture was loaded onto two layers of filters: an NC membrane (0.45 μm, Bio-Rad) laid atop a Zeta-Probe membrane (Bio-Rad) fixed on a Dot microfiltration apparatus (Bio-Rad). The protein-DNA complex bound to the NC membrane, and the free DNA on the Zeta-Probe membrane were measured using a Fuji BAS 1000 Bioimaging analyzer. Dissociation constants for binding of gene 4 proteins to DNA were calculated using the following equation, [Protein]initial−[protein­DNA complex]=Kd([protein­DNA complex]/[free DNA])Equation 1 where [Protein] is the hexamer concentration of gene 4 protein. A direct assay of helicase activity measures the release of a radioactively labeled oligonucleotide partially annealed to a complementary ssDNA (9Matson S.W. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14017-14024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A helicase substrate was prepared by annealing a 5′-end-radiolabeled 37-mer oligonucleotide (5′-TCACG ACGTT GTAAA ACGAC GGCCA GTTTT TTTTT TT-3′) to a 52-mer oligonucleotide (5′-CGACC TGCAG GCATG CAAGC TTGGC TTACA CCGTC GTTTT ACAAC GTCGT GA-3′) in 0.1 m NaCl. The reaction (10 μl) contained 200 nm DNA substrate, 1 mm dTTP, varying amounts of gene 4 protein, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, and 50 mm potassium glutamate. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 25 mm. The reaction mixture was loaded onto a 10% non-denaturing gel. Oligonucleotide separated from the partial duplex substrate by the helicase was measured using a Fuji BAS 1000 Bioimaging analyzer. The ability of gene 4 protein to form hexamers was determined by analyzing the oligomerized protein by electrophoresis on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The reaction (20 μl) contained 0.8 μm gene 4 protein, 0.7 mm β,γ-methylene dTTP, 2.5 μm 45-mer oligonucleotide (5′-AGAGC GTCAC TCTTG TGACT ACCAG TGGTC GCAAA GTTCT TATCT-3′), 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10"
https://openalex.org/W2088309103,"Recently we demonstrated that ginsenosides, the active ingredients of Panax ginseng, enhanced Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) current in the Xenopus oocyte through a signal transduction mechanism involving the activation of pertussis toxin-insensitive G protein and phospholipase C (PLC). However, it has not yet been determined precisely which G protein subunit(s) and which PLC isoform(s) participate in the ginsenoside signaling. To provide answers to these questions, we investigated the changes in ginsenoside effect on the Cl(-) current after intraoocyte injections of the cRNAs coding various G protein subunits, a regulator of G protein signaling (RGS2), and G beta gamma-binding proteins. In addition, we examined which of mammalian PLC beta 1-3 antibodies injected into the oocyte inhibited the action of ginsenosides on the Cl(-) current. Injection of G alpha(q) or G alpha(11) cRNA increased the basal Cl(-) current recorded 48 h after, and it further prevented ginsenosides from enhancing the Cl(-) current, whereas G alpha(i2) and G alpha(oA) cRNA injection had no significant effect. The changes following G alpha(q) cRNA injection were prevented when G beta(1)gamma(2) and G alpha(q) subunits were co-expressed by simultaneous injection of the cRNAs coding these subunits. Injection of cRNA coding G alpha(q)Q209L, a constitutively active mutant that does not bind to G beta gamma, produced effects similar to those of G alpha(q) cRNA injection. The effects of G alpha(q)Q209L cRNA injection, however, were not prevented by co-injection of G beta(1)gamma(2) cRNA. Injection of the cRNA coding RGS2, which interacts most selectively with G alpha(q/11) among various identified RGS isoforms and stimulates the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP in active GTP-bound G alpha subunit, resulted in a severe attenuation of ginsenoside effect on the Cl(-) current. Finally, antibodies against PLC beta 3, but not -beta 1 and -beta 2, markedly attenuated the ginsenoside effect examined at 3-h postinjection. These results suggest that G alpha(q/11) coupled to mammalian PLC beta 3-like enzyme mediates ginsenoside effect on Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) current in the Xenopus oocyte."
https://openalex.org/W2095432189,"Abstract Mutations in the gene encoding 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase (RDH5; EC 1.1.1.105) are associated with fundus albipunctatus, an autosomal recessive eye disease characterized by stationary night blindness and accumulation of white spots in the retina. In addition, some mutated alleles are associated with development of cone dystrophy, especially in elderly patients. The numbers of identified RDH5 mutations linked to fundus albipunctatus have increased considerably during recent years. In this work, we have characterized the biochemical and cell biological properties of 11 mutants of RDH5 to understand the molecular pathology of the disease. All RDH5 mutants showed decreased protein stability and subcellular mislocalization and, in most cases, loss of enzymatic activity in vitro and in vivo. Surprisingly, mutant A294P displays significant enzymatic activity. Cross-linking studies and molecular modeling showed that RDH5 is dimeric, and co-expression analyses of wild-type and mutated alleles showed that the mutated enzymes, in a trans-dominant-negative manner, influenced thein vivo enzymatic properties of functional variants of the enzyme, particularly the A294P mutant. Thus, under certain conditions, nonfunctional alleles act in a dominant-negative way on functional but relatively unstable mutated alleles. However, in heterozygous individuals carrying one wild-type allele, the disease is recessive, probably due to the stability of the wild-type enzyme."

Gγ13 contains a C-terminal asparagine-proline-tryptophan (NPW) tripeptide, a hallmark of RGS protein Gγ-like (GGL) domains which dimerize exclusively with Gβ5 subunits. In this study, we investigated the functional range of Gγ13 assembly with Gβ subunits using multiple assays of Gβ association and Gβγ effector modulation. Gγ13 was observed to associate with all five Gβ subunits (Gβ1–5) upon co-translation in vitro, as well as function with all five Gβ subunits in the modulation of Kir3.1/3.4 (GIRK1/4) potassium and N-type (α1B) calcium channels.

The WD-repeat β-propeller protein Gβ and the α-helical isoprenylated polypeptide Gγ form an obligate heterodimer that binds tightly to GDP-bound Gα, enhancing Gα coupling to receptor and inhibiting its release of GDP. Guanine nucleotide exchange activity of agonist-occupied G protein-coupled receptors facilitates dissociation of Gα·GTP and Gβγ subunits and allows both moieties to modulate a variety of downstream effectors; for the free Gβγ dimer, these effectors include the second messenger generators adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C-β (PLCβ)1 as well as ion channels such as G protein-coupled inward-rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels and N-type calcium channels (3Clapham D.E.

The particular isoprenyl lipid group attached to the Gγ C terminus, however, may modulate Gα-, receptor-, and/or effector-coupling efficiencies of Gβγ dimers (11Matsuda T. Hashimoto Y. Ueda H.

A divergent member of the Gγ subunit family, Gγ13, was recently cloned from mouse neuroepithelial taste receptor cells (17Huang L. Shanker Y.G. Dubauskaite J. Zheng J.Z. Yan W. Rosenzweig S. Spielman A.I. Max M. Margolskee R.F. Nat.

Sano H. Ohta M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Gγ13 is unique in possessing an asparagine-proline-tryptophan (NPW) tripeptide prior to the C-terminal isoprenylation signal sequence; this conserved tripeptide ends in phenylalanine (i.e. NPF) in all other mammalian Gγ polypeptides. The NPW motif is also found within the Gγ-like (GGL) domains of the R7 subfamily of mammalian RGS proteins (RGS6, -7, -9, and -11; Fig. 1B). We and others recently have shown that GGL domains specify a uniquely selective association with Gβ5 isoforms (reviewed in Ref. 19Sondek J. Siderovski D.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 1329-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Moreover, molecular modeling and mutagenesis of GGL domains and Gγ subunits (20Snow B.E. Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Lee S.F. Wall M.A. Chung S. Mangion J. Arya S. Gilman A.G. Siderovski D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13307-13312Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 21Snow B.E. Betts L.

Betts L. Mangion J. Sondek J. Siderovski D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6489-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the assembly of Gγ13 with Gβ isotypes and the functional range of these dimers in both Gα association and downstream effector activation. In particular, we address whether the Trp-274 hypothesis of exclusive Gβ5association holds true for this divergent Gγ subunit. The entire open reading frame of mouse Gγ13 was amplified by PCR (sense primer 5′-GGGATCCGACGCCATGGAGGAGTGGGATG-3′, antisense primer 5′-GTCTAGAGTGTGGGTCAGGCTCATAGG-3′) from a MarathonTM mouse brain cDNA library (CLONTECH), digested with EcoRI andXbaI, and subcloned in-frame with an N-terminal tandem hemagglutinin (HA)-epitope tag into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) as previously described (20Snow B.E.

G protein β-subunit constructs with an N-terminal Myc-epitope tag, as well as wild-type and F61W mutant Gγ2 expression constructs have previously been described (21Snow B.E. Betts L. Mangion J.

MarathonTM cDNA pools from human heart, brain, spleen, retina, and lymph node poly(A)+mRNA (CLONTECH) were amplified by PCR using primer sets specific for human Gγ13 (sense primer 5′-TTGTCATTGTCCCTCCGCTGTCAC-3′, antisense primer 5′-GCTCACAGGATGGTGCATTTG-3′) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; sense primer 5′-GACCACAGTCCATGCCATCACT-3′, antisense primer 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTAG-3′) mRNAs. The 273-bp human brainGγ13 PCR product, encoding the entire open reading frame, was cloned into the vector pCR2.1 using the TOPO-TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). An EcoRI fragment of this construct was labeled with [α-32P]dATP (Amersham Bioscience Inc.) by random priming (StripEZ, Ambion), and hybridized under stringent conditions with a human brain multiple tissue Northern (MTNTM) blot (CLONTECH) using the NorthernMax system (Ambion). A mouse tissue MTNTM blot was similarly hybridized with a 32P-labeled 301-bpEcoRI/XbaI fragment of mouseGγ13 cDNA. To control for RNA loading and quality, both MTNTM blots were also hybridized with a commercially available GAPDH cDNA probe (Ambion). In vitro transcription and translation reactions were performed using the TNTTMreticulocyte lysate system (Promega). T7 promoter-based metabolic35S labeling of HA-tagged Gγ13 or Gγ2(F61W) co-expressed with one of five Myc-tagged Gβ subunit expression vectors (Gβ1–5) was performed as previously described (20Snow B.E.

Briefly, Gγ proteins were immunoprecipitated (IP) using anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) in Buffer D (50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 0.05% C12E10). Immunoprecipitated complexes were washed three times with 0.4 ml of Buffer D. Co-precipitating [35S]methionine-labeled Gβ and Gγ subunits were identified by SDS-PAGE on Novex 14% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) followed by direct autoradiography. Detailed experimental procedures were provided previously (20Snow B.E. Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Lee S.F. Wall M.A. Chung S. Mangion J. Arya S. Gilman A.G. Siderovski D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Transient co-transfections of HEK293T cell monolayers with Myc-tagged Gβ and HA-tagged Gγ expression constructs were performed using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection by scraping into 1 ml of RIPA-150 buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 20 mmEDTA, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, CompleteTM Mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Lysates were prepared by passing cell suspension 10 times through a 23-gauge needle followed by centrifuging at 16,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble material. Supernatants were adjusted to 1 mg/ml total protein (concentrations measured using Bio-Rad DC protein assay reagent) and precleared for 45 min with 20 μl of 50% (v/v) protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz). Following removal of beads by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 min, the supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes containing anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and incubated with constant rotation for 1 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were centrifuged, and the supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes containing 40 μl of 50% (v/v) protein A/G beads. The complexes were rotated at 4 °C for 1 h, and then centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 1 min to collect the beads. The protein A/G beads were washed twice in RIPA-500 buffer (21Snow B.E. Betts L. Mangion J. Sondek J. Siderovski D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6489-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), followed by three washes in RIPA-150 buffer. Immunocomplexes were eluted from the beads by adding 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Proteins were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) for detection of Gβ subunits with anti-Myc mouse monoclonal antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (9E10-HRP; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Bioscience, Inc.). Gγ subunits were detected using anti-HA rat monoclonal antibody 3F10-horseradish peroxidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Transient transfection and electrophysiological recordings of the stable G1,4 cell line, a HEK293 derivative line expressing GIRK1 and GIRK4 potassium channel subunits, were performed as recently described (24Lei Q. Jones M.B. Talley E.M. Schrier A.D. McIntire W.E. Garrison J.C. Bayliss D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9771-9776Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Briefly, Gβ and Gγ expression plasmids were co-transfected at a concentration of 6 μg each per 35-mm culture dish, along with 1 μg per dish pGreenLantern (Invitrogen), a plasmid encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP). Electrophysiological recordings were acquired and analyzed using an Axopatch 200A patch clamp amplifier and the pCLAMP program suite (Axon Instruments). Inwardly rectifying whole cell currents were evoked from cells held at −50 mV while applying a voltage ramp command at 0.1 Hz (Δ −90 mV; 0.1 V/s). Slope conductance was obtained from a linear fit to current voltage data over the range of −100 to −120 mV. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA, withpost-hoc Bonferroni test. All GIRK channel data are presented as mean ± S.E., with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Voltage-dependent inhibition of calcium channels by Gβγ subunit expression was studied in C2D7 cells, a HEK293-derivative line expressing human α1B(N-type) Ca2+ channels (α1B, α2δ, and β1–3 subunits) (25Simen A.A. Miller R.J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3689-3698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were transiently transfected with 5 μg of Gβ and 5 μg of Gγ DNA, along with 1 μg of commercially available GFP vector (Invitrogen), as previously described (26Zhou J.Y. Siderovski D.P. Miller R.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7143-7148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell culture, cell identification, and whole cell patch clamp of Ba2+ current (n = 6∼11) were performed as previously described (26Zhou J.Y. Siderovski D.P. Miller R.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7143-7148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pre-pulse facilitation ratios, indicative of Gβγ-mediated, voltage-dependent inhibition, were calculated from these currents and analyzed as described by Simen and Miller (25Simen A.A. Miller R.J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3689-3698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Multiple comparisons of calcium current results were performed using one-way ANOVA, followed by a nonparametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. COS-7 cells were maintained at 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Approximately 24 h prior to transfection, cells were replated into 12-well plates at a density of 7.5 × 105 cells per well. Subconfluent cells were transfected using Fugene transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with 300 ng of PLCβ2 vector, 200 ng each of appropriate Gβ and/or Gγ subunit expression vectors, and sufficient pcDNA3.1 vector to achieve 700 ng/well total DNA. After incubating 24 h with DNA and transfection reagent, the medium was removed and replaced with 400 μl of inositol-free and serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 μCi of myo-[3H]inositol (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc.). To initiate the accumulation of radiolabeled inositol phosphates, LiCl (10 mm final concentration) was added to the labeling medium and cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Medium was then aspirated and cells were lysed by adding ice-cold 50 mm formic acid and incubated on ice for 20 min. After neutralization with 250 μl of 150 mm NH4OH, lysates were loaded onto Dowex ion exchange columns, and washed with 10 ml of water and 10 ml of 50 mm formic acid. Inositol phosphates were eluted with 5 ml of 1.2 m ammonium formate, 100 mm formic acid. Gβγ subunit-mediated inhibition of Gαq-stimulated [3H]inositol phosphate accumulation was measured as described above, except that COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with 20 ng of Gαq vector in addition to 300 ng of PLCβ1 vector, 200 ng each of the indicated Gβ and/or Gγ subunit expression vectors, and pcDNA3.1 vector DNA to a total of 720 ng/well. In a continuing search for Gγ-like (GGL) polypeptide sequences (20Snow B.E. Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Lee S.F. Wall M.A. Chung S. Mangion J. Arya S. Gilman A.G. Siderovski D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13307-13312Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), we employed the Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool (SMART; Ref. 27Schultz J. Copley R.R. Doerks T. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar) to identify uncharacterized GGL sequences among anonymous open reading frames derived from eukaryotic genome sequencing projects. We recently reported the identification of two open reading frames from genes of the Drosophila melanogaster genome (CG15844 and CG18511) that possess GGL domains (19Sondek J. Siderovski D.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 1329-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The latter predicted polypeptide data base record (CG18511, also known in the Celera data base as CP42246; Ref. 28Adams M.D. et al.Science. 2000; 287: 2185-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (4851) Google Scholar) is, in fact, an erroneous C-terminal sequence extension of a known Gγ subunit, the Drosophila visual Gγ subunit Gγe (29Schulz S. Huber A. Schwab K. Paulsen R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37605-37610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). More recently, we identified a GGL domain within a predicted 89-amino acid polypeptide computed from genomic DNA sequence of a 2-Mb span of human chromosome 16p13.3 (GenBankTM accession number AL031033; protein product C321D2.5); this predicted open reading frame data base record is also an erroneous sequence extension of a recently isolated human Gγ subunit, Gγ13 (17Huang L. Shanker Y.G. Dubauskaite J. Zheng J.Z. Yan W. Rosenzweig S. Spielman A.I. Max M. Margolskee R.F. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 1055-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Alignment of the correct polypeptide sequences of human Gγ13 and Drosophila Gγe, along with corresponding orthologs from mouse (mGγ13; Ref. 18Inoue S. Sano H. Ohta M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and C. elegans (cGγ2; Ref. 29Schulz S. Huber A. Schwab K. Paulsen R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37605-37610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), revealed 100% conservation of a unique asparagine-proline-tryptophan (NPW) tripeptide sequence at the C terminus prior to the CAAX box (Fig.1A). While the presence of an NPW motif was found to be unique among conventional, isoprenylated Gγ subunits (e.g. comparing hGγ13 to all other human Gγ subunits; Fig. 1B), this NPW motif is a hallmark of the internal GGL domains of R7 subfamily (or “C-subfamily”) RGS proteins (20Snow B.E. Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Lee S.F. Wall M.A. Chung S. Mangion J. Arya S. Gilman A.G. Siderovski D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1999; 96: 6489-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Pairwise comparisons of all human Gγ and GGL domain sequences (Fig. 1C) confirmed the divergent nature of the NPW motif-containing Gγ subunit. The human and mouse Gγ13 open reading frames were cloned using RT-PCR. cDNA pools from human and mouse whole brain and retinal tissues gave detectable RT-PCR products, whereas neitherGγ13 product was detected in lymph node, spleen, or heart cDNA samples (Fig.2A and data not shown). The RT-PCR products from brain cDNA were cloned, sequence verified, and used as probes in Northern blot analyses ofGγ13 expression. Analysis of a mouse multiple tissue Northern blot revealed the expression of a ∼0.5-kb murineGγ13 transcript that was restricted to brain (Fig. 2B). The human Gγ13 mRNA was observed in whole brain as a single ∼1.3-kb transcript (Fig.2C) and, among several brain regions tested, was specifically expressed in the thalamus. These results are comparable to the brain-specific expression observed in complementary human multiple tissue and mouse brain subregion Northern blots by Huang and colleagues (17Huang L. Shanker Y.G. Dubauskaite J. Zheng J.Z. Yan W. Rosenzweig S. Spielman A.I. Max M. Margolskee R.F. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 1055-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In addition, serial analysis of gene expression maps and EST profiles of the human and mouse Gγ13 sequences (UniGene clusters Hs.247888 and Mm.45263; Ref. 30Schuler G.D. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) also indicate a primarily brain-specific expression pattern. In total, these findings suggest that Gγ13 expression is limited primarily to sensory epithelia and neural tissues. We previously hypothesized that the NPW motif of GGL domains plays a critical role in the exclusive Gβ5association by R7 subfamily RGS proteins (21Snow B.E. Betts L. Mangion J. Sondek J. Siderovski D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6489-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the NPW motif-containing Gγ13 subunit for its Gβ association specificity. T7 promoter-based expression vectors for HA epitope-tagged Gγ13 (or Gγ2(F61W) as a positive control; Ref. 21Snow B.E. Betts L. Mangion J. Sondek J. Siderovski D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6489-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), along with one of five Myc-tagged Gβ subunit expression vectors (Gβ1–5), were co-transcribed and translated in reticulocyte lysates as previously described (20Snow B.E. Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Lee S.F. Wall M.A. Chung S. Mangion J. Arya S. Gilman A.G. Siderovski D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Methods Enzymol. 2001; 344: 702-723Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Gγ proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-HA monoclonal antibody and the immunocomplexes were washed with low detergent conditions (0.05% C12E10) prior to detection of associated, [35S]methioninelabeled Gβ subunits by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. As previously reported (21Snow B.E. Betts L. Mangion J. Sondek J. Siderovski D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6489-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), substituting tryptophan for phenylalanine in the NPF motif of Gγ2 (i.e. the “F61W” point mutation) facilitates Gγ2 dimerization with all five Gβ subunits (including Gβ5) in low-detergent conditions (Fig.3A, left panel). Similarly, co-translated Gγ13 bound to all five Gβ subunits in these low-detergent conditions (Fig. 3A,right panel). To test Gβ/Gγ13 dimer assembly in a cellular context, expression vectors for HA-tagged Gγ13, Gγ2, or RGS11 proteins were transiently transfected into HEK293T cells, along with one of five Myc-tagged Gβ subunit expression vectors (Gβ1–5). Lysates of transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody and immunoblotted with anti-Myc antibody to detect bound Gβ subunits. As shown in Fig.3B (right panel), only Gβ1/Gγ13, Gβ3/Gγ13, and Gβ4/Gγ13 dimers were detected in cellular lysates by co-immunoprecipitation. The apparent lack of detectable Gγ13 association with Gβ2 and Gβ5 in this experiment was not the result of deficient Gβ subunit expression levels (i.e. Fig. 3B,Lysate Blot:anti-Myc), nor the result of a functional deficiency in expressed Gβ2 and Gβ5proteins, since the positive controls Gγ2 and RGS11 bound avidly to Gβ2 and Gβ5 subunits, respectively (Fig. 3B, left panel). These findings suggest that under the high-detergent conditions used for this cellular co-immunoprecipitation assay (i.e. RIPA buffer with 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% SDS), Gγ13 remains stably associated with Gβ1, Gβ3, and Gβ4, and is not, or is very weakly, associated with Gβ2 and Gβ5. The capacity of Gγ13, in combination with each of the Gβ subunits, to modulate GIRK currents was examined using whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology. G1,4 cells, stably expressing Kir3.1/3.4 (GIRK1/4) channels (24Lei Q. Jones M.B. Talley E.M. Schrier A.D. McIntire W.E. Garrison J.C. Bayliss D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9771-9776Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), were transiently transfected with GFP and empty vector (control) or GFP and Gβ/Gγ vector pairs. GIRK channel conductance in cells co-transfected with Gγ13 and one of the first four Gβ subunits (Gβ1–4) was markedly enhanced (Fig.4). The current activation elicited by Gβγ dimers consisting of Gβ1–4 in combination with Gγ13 was not significantly different from that observed with cognate Gβγ dimers formed with Gγ2(e.g. β1γ13versusβ1γ2; Fig. 4A). In contrast, G1,4 cells co-transfected with Gγ13 and Gβ5subunits displayed significantly diminished GIRK currents relative to vector-transfected cells (Fig. 4B, and inset ofC); this observation is consistent with our previous report that Gβ5 containing dimers β5γ2 and β5γ11inhibit, rather than activate, GIRK1,4 and GIRK1,2 channels (24Lei Q. Jones M.B. Talley E.M. Schrier A.D. McIntire W.E. Garrison J.C. Bayliss D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9771-9776Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Collectively, these findings suggest that Gγ13 associates nonselectively with all Gβ subunits to modulate GIRK channel currents. The HEK293-derived cell line C2D7 stably expresses human α1B (N-type) Ca2+ channels and serves as a useful model for the study of G-protein subunit effects on Ca2+ channel acti"
https://openalex.org/W2144361157,"Pax6 is a transcription factor involved in brain patterning and neurogenesis. Expression ofPax6 is specifically observed in the developing cerebral cortex, where Lewis x epitope that is thought to play important roles in cell interactions is colocalized. Here we examined whetherPax6 regulates localization of Lewis x usingPax6 mutant rat embryos. The Lewis x epitope disappeared in the Pax6 mutant cortex, and activity of α1,3-fucosyltransferase, which catalyzed the last step of Lewis x biosynthesis, drastically decreased in the mutant cortex as compared with the wild type. Furthermore, expression of a fucosyltransferase gene, FucT-IX, specifically decreased in the mutant, while no change was seen for expression of another fucosyltransferase gene,FucT-IV. These results strongly suggest thatPax6 controls Lewis x expression in the embryonic brain by regulating FucT-IX gene expression. Pax6 is a transcription factor involved in brain patterning and neurogenesis. Expression ofPax6 is specifically observed in the developing cerebral cortex, where Lewis x epitope that is thought to play important roles in cell interactions is colocalized. Here we examined whetherPax6 regulates localization of Lewis x usingPax6 mutant rat embryos. The Lewis x epitope disappeared in the Pax6 mutant cortex, and activity of α1,3-fucosyltransferase, which catalyzed the last step of Lewis x biosynthesis, drastically decreased in the mutant cortex as compared with the wild type. Furthermore, expression of a fucosyltransferase gene, FucT-IX, specifically decreased in the mutant, while no change was seen for expression of another fucosyltransferase gene,FucT-IV. These results strongly suggest thatPax6 controls Lewis x expression in the embryonic brain by regulating FucT-IX gene expression. embryonic day α1,3-fucosyltransferase high performance thin-layer chromatography glycan labeled with 2-aminopyridine ceramide ventricular zone chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan receptor-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase-ζ/β β1,4-galactosyltransferase leukocyte adhesion deficiency type II The development of the central nervous system requires the specification of distinct regions, which presumably results from spatiotemporally restricted expression of various regulatory genes, including Pax6. Pax6 is expressed in several discrete domains of the developing central nervous system (Refs. 1Walther C. Gruss P.

It has been proposed that Ca2+-dependent selective adhesion of the cortical cells segregating from the striatal cells contributes to the formation and maintenance of boundaries between these telencephalic regions (19Götz M.

It has been reported that the cortex of the rat telencephalon at embryonic days 12 to 15 (E12–15)1 distinctively expresses Lewis x epitope (19Götz M. Wizenmann A. Reinhardt S. Lumsden A. Price J.

The Lewis x epitope, which is also known as CD15 and SSEA-1 (stage-specific embryonic antigen-1), has been identified as a glycan epitope with a Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAcβ1- structure (23Kobata A.

The epitope appears in the mouse embryo at the morula stage and decreases rapidly after compaction (28Solter D. Knowles B.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this study, we examined the relationship between Pax6 and the expression of Lewis x epitope in the developing nervous system. Our preliminary observations led us to hypothesize that Pax6regulates the expression of Lewis x epitope by controlling α3FucT activity. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the expression of Lewis x epitope and α3FucT activity in the rat E13.5 telencephalon of the wild type and the Pax6 mutant. By investigating the expression of FucT-IV and FucT-IX in E13.5 telencephalon, we demonstrated that the expression ofFucT-IX was decreased in the Pax6 mutant. Based on these results, we proposed that one of the mechanisms that control the expression of Lewis x epitope is through regulating the gene expression of FucT-IX by Pax6. Rat Small eye (rSey2) strain was used as Pax6 mutant (50Osumi N. Hirota A. Ohuchi H. Nakafuku M. Iimura T. Kuratani S. Fujiwara M. Noji S. Eto K.

The day when the vaginal plug was found was designated as embryonic day 0 (E0). Homozygous embryos could easily be distinguished from those of the wild type from their external features; the former lacked the eye and nose primordia. For histological analyses, immunostaining and in situ hybridization were performed on frozen sections of Pax6 mutant and wild type rat embryos according to the methods described previously (50Osumi N.

Proteins were extracted from the telencephalon dissected from three embryos at E13.5. The specimens were homogenized by sonication for 15 s in 2 volumes of ice-cold homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, plus protease inhibitor mixture Complete, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 3 min. To the resulting supernatant, 5 μg of anti-Lewis x antibody (clone 73-30; Seikagaku), 2.5 μg of rat anti-mouse IgM (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and 5 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences Inc.) were added, and the solution was rotated overnight at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times with homogenization buffer. Bound protein was released from beads by incubation in homogenization buffer containing 0.5% SDS and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol for 30 min. To a 10-μl aliquot of the immunoprecipitate was added 10 μl of chondroitinase ABC protease free (0.1 unit; Seikagaku), endo-β-galactosidase (10 milliunits; Seikagaku), glycopeptidase A (0.5 milliunits; Seikagaku), or homogenization buffer. After incubating overnight at 37 °C, the samples were diluted 1:1 with 2 × reducing sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-Lewis x antibody (clone TÜ9; Quartett) as described previously (54Osanai T. Chai W. Tajima Y. Shimoda Y. Sanai Y. Yuen C.T. FEBS Lett. 2001; 488: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Cross-linked phosphorylase b (Sigma) was used as the molecular weight standard. Lipids were extracted from the telencephalon dissected from six embryos at E13.5. The specimens were homogenized by sonication for 15 s in distilled water. Neutral glycolipids were isolated from the homogenate and subjected to high performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC), followed by immunostaining with anti-Lewis x antibody (clone 73-30; Seikagaku), as described previously (54Osanai T.

The resulting pellet was resuspended with 0.5m sucrose containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and used as enzyme source after homogenization by sonication. Glycans labeled with 2-aminopyridine (PA-glycans) were prepared as described previously (51Shimoda Y. Tajima Y. Nagase T. Harii K. Osumi N. Sanai Y. J. Biol.

Rat FucT-IVcDNA fragment was obtained by PCR in the presence of 5% dimethyl sulfoxide using rat genomic DNA (CLONTECH) as a template. Based on the previously reported sequence of ratFucT-IV gene (56Sajdel-Sulkowska E.M. Smith F.I. Wiederschain G. McCluer R.H. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), oligonucleotides used to amplify the cDNA were as follows: 5′-GCCCGCCCCCTCTATG-3′ and 5′-AATAGCCTCATCGCTGGAACC-3′. The PCR product was subcloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) and the subcloned fragments were sequenced. The sequence of the PCR product revealed some discrepancies (7 bases in nucleotide and the resultant 4 amino acid changes) with the previously reported sequence (GenBankTM accession number U58860). Although the reason for the discrepancies is not clear, we used this sequence as the rat FucT-IV gene in this study. The FucT-IV fragment thus obtained was cloned into pBluescript II SK− (Stratagene). A partial cDNA of rat FucT-IX was obtained by PCR using rat whole brain cDNA as a template. Based on the sequences of mouse and human FucT-IX genes (44Kaneko M. Kudo T. Iwasaki H. Ikehara Y. Nishihara S. Nakagawa S. Sasaki K. Shiina T. Inoko H. Saitou N. Narimatsu H.

The PCR product was subcloned into the pBluescript SK−, and the subcloned fragments were sequenced. To obtain both the 5′- and 3′-sequence of rat FucT-IX, rapid amplification of cDNA ends was employed using rat cerebellum Marathon Ready cDNA (CLONTECH). The products of PCR using Advantage cDNA Polymerase Mix (CLONTECH) were subcloned into pGEM-T Easy vector and sequenced. While this manuscript was in preparation, the sequence was also reported by others (57Baboval T. Henion T. Kinnally E. Smith F.I. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 62: 206-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Based on the obtained sequences, the DNA fragment encoding the full-length open reading frame ofFucT-IX was amplified by PCR using rat genomic DNA (CLONTECH) as a template. Oligonucleotides used to amplify the cDNA were as follows: 5′-CCCAAGCTTCTCTACCGTGAAAAATTATG-3′ containingHindIII site (underlined) and 5′-GCTCTAGAGTGACGATGATGGACATTTTAA-3′ containingXbaI site (underlined). After restriction digestion, the PCR product was subcloned into pBluescript II SK−. RatFucT-IV and FucT-IX fragments were subcloned into pCDM8 vector. COS-7 cells (1 × 106 cells) were transfected with one of the expression plasmids using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 3 days, the cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, homogenized in 100 μl of 0.3% Triton X-100, and used as the enzyme source for the α1,3-fucosyltransferase assay. Real-time detection-PCR was performed using a set of PCR primers and a probe complementary to the sequence located in nonconserved regions between FucT-IV and FucT-IX. Oligonucleotides used were as follows: FucT-IV, 5′-GTTTGAGAACTCACAGCACGT-3′, 5′-CCACGTTTCGGTCGAG-3′; the TaqMan probe, 5′-ACATCACTGAGAAGCTGTGGCG-3′; FucT-IX, 5′-GGGCAGACCTTTGACCTTACAT-3′, 5′-ACGGCGATAAGTTAGAGTCAGGT-3′; and the TaqMan probe, 5′-TGCCAAGCCATGTTCAACATCC-3′. Each TaqMan probe was attached with the reporter dye FAM to the 5′ end and the quencher dye TAMRA to the 3′ end. Standard RNAs were synthesized usingFucT-IV or FucT-IX cloned into pBluescript II as a template and T7 RNA polymerase and MEGAscript in vitrotranscription kits (Ambion). Synthetic RNA was treated with DNase I and purified using an RNeasy column (Qiagen). The possibility of contamination of the DNA template in the purified RNA was eliminated by PCR without reverse transcription. Synthetic RNA copy numbers were calculated from the quantity and molecular weight of RNA according to conventional methods. Real-time detection-PCR was performed using a GeneAmp Ez rTth RNA PCR kit and an ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detector (PE Biosystems) as described previously (58Takeuchi T. Katsume A. Tanaka T. Abe A.

Whole-mount in situ staining of the dissected brain revealed Pax6 mRNA expression in the E13.5 rat dorsal telencephalon (Fig.1F), as was observed in mouse embryos (1Walther C. Gruss P. Development (Camb.). 1991; 113: 1435-1449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Stoykova A. Gruss P. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1395-1412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Stoykova A. Fritsch R. Walther C. Gruss P. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 3453-3465PubMed Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry using anti-Pax6 antibody showed intense staining in the ventricular zone (VZ) of the telencephalic cortex and dorsal thalamus of the wild type (Fig. 1C). We examined the expression of Lewis x epitope in the telencephalon of both wild type and Pax6 mutant embryos. The VZ of the telencephalic cortex was stained with anti-Lewis x antibody in wild type E13.5 embryo (Fig. 1A), as was reported in the E12–15 rat forebrain (19Götz M. Wizenmann A. Reinhardt S. Lumsden A. Price J. Neuron. 1996; 3: 551-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 21Yamamoto M. Boyer A.M. Schwarting G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The expression of Lewis x epitope was not detected in the dorsal thalamus where Pax6 staining was positive, but was detected in the lateral and medial ganglionic eminences where Pax6 staining was negative (Fig. 1, A and C). Thus the expression patterns of Pax6 and Lewis x epitope partially overlapped in the wild type telencephalon. In the homozygous embryo, however, little staining with anti-Lewis x antibody was observed in the telencephalic cortex (Fig. 1D). In contrast with Lewis x, no differences in the expression of HNK-1 epitope in the outer layer of the cortex and the broad area of the basal ganglia (51Shimoda Y. Tajima Y. Nagase T. Harii K. Osumi N. Sanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17115-17122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) were observed between the wild type and homozygous embryos (Fig. 1, B and E). These results suggest that the expression of Lewis x epitope in the telencephalic cortex is regulated by Pax6. Lewis x epitope has a Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAcβ1- structure at the terminus of the glycan and is present on some glycoconjugates (glycoproteins, glycolipids, proteoglycans). The following two mechanisms may account for our immunohistochemical results of Lewis x (Fig. 1, A and D): 1) the carrier glycoconjugate itself disappears in the homozygote or 2) the glycan on the existing carrier in the homozygote differs from the Lewis x-positive one in the wild type. To determine the molecular basis of the regulation of Lewis x expression by Pax6, we searched for Lewis x glycan-bearing materials that exist in the wild type tissue but not in the homozygous brain. Proteinaceous materials from E13.5 telencephalon were immunoprecipitated with anti-Lewis x antibody (clone 73-30) and subjected to immunoblotting analysis using anti-Lewis x antibody (clone TÜ9). A positive band was observed at the position corresponding to ∼500 kDa in the immunoprecipitate from the wild type but not from the homozygote (Fig. 2A). The mobility of the positive band was increased to the position corresponding to ∼400 kDa upon treatment with chondroitinase ABC, which catalyzes the removal of chondroitin sulfate side chains from proteoglycans (Fig. 2B, lane 2). The positive band disappeared after treatment with endo-β-galactosidase which hydrolyzes β-galactoside linkage in poly-N-acetyllactosamine (Fig. 2B, lane 3) or peptideglycanase A, which acts on N-linked glycan (Fig. 2B, lane 4). These results indicate that the Lewis x-positive protein is a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) and that the Lewis x epitope is present on a poly-N-acetyllactosamine structure on theN-linked glycan on the CSPG. While these features are common to phosphacan/receptor-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase-ζ/β (RPTP-ζ/β) (22Allendoerfer K.L. Magnani J.L. Patterson P.H. Mol. Cell.

Tajima and Y. Sanai, unpublished results., 3N. Osumi, unpublished results.The CSPG has yet to be identified. Neutral glycolipids extracted from the E13.5 telencephalon were subjected to HPTLC and stained with anti-Lewis x antibody (clone 73-30). Lewis x-positive bands were observed in material obtained from both the homozygote and the wild type (Fig. 2C). The simplest form of Lewis x-glycolipid was not detected. It is likely that Lewis x-glycolipids in the E13.5 telencephalon have a more complex structure, with the major one probably being Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glcβ1–1′Cer as described for rat E15 cerebral cortex by Chou et al.(34Chou D.K.

Rab proteins are recognized as substrates only when they are complexed to Rab Escort Protein (REP). The classical model of prenylation complex assembly assumes initial formation of the Rab·REP binary complex, which subsequently binds to RabGGTase loaded with the isoprenoid donor geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGpp). We demonstrate here that REP-1 can also associate with RabGGTase in the absence of Rab protein and that this interaction is dramatically strengthened by the presence of phosphoisoprenoids such as GGpp. The GGpp-dependent interaction between RabGGTase and REP-1 was observed using affinity precipitations and gel filtration and was quantitated on the basis of fluorescence assays. In the presence of GGpp, REP-1 binds to RabGGTase with a Kdvalue of ∼10 nm, while in its absence the affinity between the two proteins is in the micromolar range. We further demonstrate that binding of Rab7 to the RabGGTase·GGpp·REP-1 complex occurs without prior dissociation of REP-1. Analysis of binding and prenylation rate constants indicate that the RabGGTase·GGpp·REP-1 complex can function as a kinetically competent intermediate of the prenylation reaction. We conclude that, depending on the prevailing concentrations, binding of REP-1 to RabGGTase in the presence of GGpp may serve as an alternative pathway for the assembly of the prenylation machinery in vivo. Implications of these findings for the role of REP-1 in the prenylation reaction are discussed.

Rab escort protein dithioerythritol high pressure liquid chromatography Rab proteins are members of the Ras superfamily of small GTP-binding proteins, which are directly implicated in the regulation of vesicular traffic (1Stenmark H. Olkkonen V.M. Genome Biol. 2001; 2: 1-7Crossref Google Scholar). They are rendered functionally active by post-translational lipidation, which is conferred by Rab geranylgeranyltransferase (RabGGTase or GGTase-II). This enzyme attaches two hydrophobic geranylgeranyl moieties onto the C-terminal cysteine residues of Rab proteins, thereby enabling them to associate reversibly with membranes. Mammalian RabGGTase is a heterodimer composed of tightly associated α and β subunits and belongs to the family of protein prenyltransferases together with geranylgeranyltransferase I and farnesyltransferase (2Casey P.J. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5289-5292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of RabGGTase revealed that the phosphoisoprenoid binding site is located in a buried cavity on the β subunit (3Zhang H. Seabra C.M. Deisenhofer J. Structure. 2000; 8: 241-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The α subunit consists of a helical domain, followed by an immunoglobulin (Ig)-like fold and an additional leucine rich repeat. In contrast to other known prenyltransferases, RabGGTase binds its protein substrate sufficiently tightly only if it is complexed to an accessory factor, termed Rab Escort Protein (REP)1 (2Casey P.J. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5289-5292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 4Andres D.A. Seabra M.C. Brown M.S. Armstrong S.A. Smeland T.E. Cremers F.P. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1993; 73: 1091-1099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In the absence of REP the affinity of Rab proteins toward RabGGTase was estimated to be in the micromolar range (5Iakovenko A. Rostkova E. Merzlyak E. Hillebrand A.M. Thoma N.H. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It has been shown that RabGGTase can bind a variety of Rab proteins with comparable affinities (6Alexandrov K. Simon I. Iakovenko A. Holz B. Goody R.S. Scheidig A.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 460-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 7Anant J.S. Desnoyers L. Machius M. Demeler B. Hansen J.C. Westover K.D. Deisenhofer J. Seabra M.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12559-12568Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Moreover, it was suggested that RabGGTase binds the REP·Rab complex primarily through the interaction with REP, and both the leucine rich repeat and Ig domains of RabGGTase were implicated in the recognition process (3Zhang H. Seabra C.M. Deisenhofer J. Structure. 2000; 8: 241-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 7Anant J.S. Desnoyers L. Machius M. Demeler B. Hansen J.C. Westover K.D.

Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 89-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). According to the current model, a newly synthesized Rab protein forms a stable complex with REP. The resulting binary complex is then recognized by RabGGTase, which covalently attaches a geranylgeranyl moiety to the C-terminal cysteines of the Rab protein (9Farnsworth C.C. Seabra M.C. Ericsson L.H. Gelb M.H. Glomset J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11963-11967Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Upon prenylation, Rab remains bound to REP and accompanies it to the corresponding membrane (10Alexandrov K. Horiuchi H. Steele-Mortimer O. Seabra M.C. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5262-5273Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 11Wilson A.L. Sheridan K.M. Erdman R.A. Maltese W.A. Bochem. J. 1996; 318: 1007-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The Rab protein is inserted into the membrane, presumably through the interaction with a putative membrane receptor/REP-GDP dissociation inhibitor displacing factor (10Alexandrov K. Horiuchi H. Steele-Mortimer O. Seabra M.C. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5262-5273Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar,12Dirac-Svejstrup A.B. Soldati T. Shapiro A.D. Pfeffer S.R. J. Biol.

Subsequently, REP is released into the cytosol and can enter a new prenylation cycle. We demonstrate here that RabGGTase is able to bind directly to REP-1 in the presence of phosphoisoprenoids. The affinity for formation of this complex is in the low nanomolar range, while micromolar affinities are observed in the absence of GGpp. Furthermore, we show that the RabGGTase·GGpp·REP-1 complex constitutes a kinetically competent intermediate in the prenylation reaction. Expression of rat RabGGTase and REP-1 in SF21 cells and subsequent purification was performed as described (14Armstrong S.A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Seabra M.C.

In vitro prenylation and purification of doubly prenylated dansylated Rab7·REP-1 complex was performed as described (16Thoma N.H. Iakovenko A. Kalinin A. Waldmann H. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Loading of Rab7 with mantGDP was performed as described (17Simon I. Zerial M. Goody R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20470-20478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Protein complex formation was performed in 500 μl of 40 mm Hepes, pH7.2, 150 mm NaCL, 5 mm DTE, 3 mmMgCL2, 90 μm GGpp. The sample was mixed, centrifuged in a bench top centrifuge for 5 min, loaded onto a Superdex 200 10/20 gel filtration column driven by a Waters 490E HPLC system, and equilibrated with 40 mm Hepes, pH7.2, 150 mm NaCL, 5 mm DTE, 3 mmMgCL2, 2.3 μm GGpp. The column was calibrated using a gel filtration calibration kit (Bio-Rad). Flow rate was 0.7 ml/min. Peaks were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Fluorescence titrations were performed with an Aminco SLM 8100 spectrophotometer (Aminco, Silver Spring, MD). All reactions were followed at 25 °C in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 40 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaH2PO4, 2 mmMgCl2 and 2 mm DTE in 1 ml volume, unless otherwise indicated. The fluorescence of mant-farnesyl pyrophosphate (mFpp) was excited via FRET at 290 nm, and emission was measured at 335 nm. Titrations were fitted to the explicit solution of the quadratic equation describing theE + S <> ES binding equilibrium, whereKd is defined as Kd = [E]*[S]/[EL]. [E0] and [L0] refer to the total enzyme and ligand concentration (free and bound) in the cuvette. Under these conditions the fluorescence is described by F=Fmin+(Fmax−Fmin)/·(([E0]+[L0]+Kd)/2−([E0]+[L0]+Kd)2/4−[E0]*[L0])1/2/[L0]Equation 1 where F represents the measured fluorescence intensity, and Fmin andFmax refer to the minimal and maximal fluorescence intensity observed, respectively. A least-squares fit of the data to Equation 1 using the software package Grafit 4.0 (Erithacus software) was used to extract the Kd value. Stopped flow experiments were performed in a High-Tech Scientific SF61 apparatus (Salisbury, England). The tryptophan fluorescence was excited at 290 and detected through a 333-nm cutoff filter. Data collection and primary analysis of rate constants were performed with the package from High Tech Scientific, and secondary analyses were performed with the programs Grafit 3.0 (Erithacus software) and Scientist 2.0 (MicroMath Scientific Software). Traces showed a contribution from photo-bleaching and were fitted as single exponential function with a slope (A*exp(−k*t)+m*t), where A is the observed amplitude, k the observed rate constant for the reaction, and m the essentially linear slope of the beginning of the bleaching curve. RabGGTase was coupled to UltraLinkTM (Pierce) beads via a reactive cysteine linkage according to the instructions of the manufacture. Approximately 2 mg of protein was coupled per ml of drained beads. Ni-NTA-agarose beads (Qiagen) were pre-equilibrated with incubation buffer containing 40 mmHepes, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.005% Triton X-100, and 2 mmβ-mercaptoethanol and saturated with REP-1. For precipitation experiments, ∼30 μl of drained beads were mixed with 20 pmol of REP-1 and RabGGTase. The total reaction volume was brought to 500 μl with incubation buffer, and GGpp was added to 2 μm where appropriate. After 10 min of incubation, beads were pelleted by centrifugation in a bench top centrifuge at 3000 × gfor 3 min and washed five times with the reaction buffer supplemented with GGpp where required. Bound material was eluted by boiling beads in 50 μl of loading buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie blue staining. Identical conditions were used for precipitation of REP-1 with RabGGTase immobilized on Sepharose beads. Development of the HPLC assay for analysis of the kinetics of the prenylation reaction will be described in detail elsewhere 2Thomä, N. H., Niculae, A., Goody, R. S., and Alexandrov, K. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276,48631–48636. but is outlined briefly here. The reactions were performed in glass tubes using the following reaction buffer: 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTE, 3 mmMgCl2, and 0.3% Nonidet P-40. For kinetic measurements, 4 μm Rab7 and 4 μm REP-1·RabGGTase complex were pre-incubated separately in the presence of 40 μmGGpp for 5 min at 25 °C. The reaction was initiated by manual mixing of Rab7 and REP-1·RabGGTase. After defined time periods, 50 μl of the reaction mixture was withdrawn, quenched by addition of 100 μl of 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid,20% glycerol mix, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. For analysis, 75 μl of quenched reaction mix was subjected to reverse phase chromatography. Samples were analyzed using a C4, 150 × 4.6-mm, 15 μm LUNA column (Phenomenx) driven by a Waters 600 s HPLC. The column was equilibrated with 95% buffer A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water) and 5% buffer B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. After injection and a 2-min wash step, proteins were eluted with a gradient from 5–70% of buffer B in 15 min. A Waters 2487 diode-array absorbance detector was used to simultaneously monitor absorbance at 210 nm and 280 nm. The primary HPLC data analysis was performed by integrating peak areas using the Waters Millennium software package. Data was analyzed by numerical integration to the explicit reaction scheme described in Thomä and Alexandrov.2 We have previously established that RabGGTase binds the Rab7·REP-1 complex with a Kd close to 100 nm (15Alexandrov K. Simon I. Yurchenko V. Iakovenko A. Rostkova E. Scheidig A.J. Goody R.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It was assumed that the presence of Rab is required for the tight interaction between RabGGTase and REP-1. Careful analysis of solid phase precipitation assays revealed, however, that trace amounts of RabGGTase co-precipitate with REP-1 in the absence of Rab7 protein (Fig. 1 in Ref. 15Alexandrov K. Simon I. Yurchenko V. Iakovenko A. Rostkova E. Scheidig A.J. Goody R.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This could in principle indicate that RabGGTase is able to bind REP-1 directly, albeit with low affinity. Moreover, based on similar affinities for REP observed for different Rab proteins, it had been suggested that the interaction between RabGGTase and Rab·REP is dominated by REP rather than Rab (7Anant J.S. Desnoyers L. Machius M. Demeler B. Hansen J.C. Westover K.D. Deisenhofer J. Seabra M.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12559-12568Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Finally, we demonstrated earlier that GGpp dramatically increases the affinity of RabGGTase for the Rab·REP complex (16Thoma N.H. Iakovenko A. Kalinin A. Waldmann H. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These observations prompted us to re-examine the issue of direct association of REP with RabGGTase and to address the role of phosphoisoprenoids in this interaction. To detect the interaction of RabGGTase and REP-1, we performed solid state precipitation assays. To this end, RabGGTase was immobilized on Sepharose beads and REP-1 was immobilized on Ni-NTA-agarose as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The beads were incubated with solutions of REP-1 and RabGGTase, respectively, in the presence or absence of 2 μm GGpp. The beads were subsequently extensively washed and pelleted by centrifugation. The washing step included 2 μm GGpp where previous incubations had been carried out in the presence of phosphoisoprenoid. The bead associated proteins were eluted and resolved on a 15% SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie stain. As can be seen in Fig. 1, REP-1 co-precipitated with RabGGTase in the presence of GGpp. Co-precipitation appeared to be nearly stoichiometric, suggesting tight interaction of RabGGTase and REP-1 in the presence of GGpp. However, in the absence of lipid substrate, REP-1 did not co-precipitate with bead-linked RabGGTase (Fig. 1). In the reverse experiment, only trace amounts of RabGGTase were found to co-precipitate with bead-bound REP-1 in the absence of GGpp while robust co-precipitation was observed in its presence (Fig.1). These observations suggest that the presence of GGpp strongly increases the affinity of an otherwise weak binary complex. To determine the stoichiometry of the binary complex we employed analytical gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column. When REP-1 was mixed with an excess of RabGGTase and GGpp, two peaks of about 210 kDa and 100 kDa were recovered (Fig.2A). As revealed by SDS-PAGE, the 210-kDa peak contained REP-1 and RabGGTase in a 1:1 ratio as judged from the intensity of the Coomassie stained bands (Fig. 2B). Judging from the composition and the retention time this peak contains the ternary RabGGTase·GGpp·REP-1complex. The smaller peak contained predominantly subunits of RabGGTase with a minor contamination of REP-1. In this case both proteins elute at their monomeric positions. Since samples of REP-1 are known to be contaminated with unspecific phophatase activity, we speculated that it might lead to degradation of GGpp and dissociation of the complex (15Alexandrov K.

Waldmann H. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12043-12052Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Indeed, when the same experiment was repeated using a non-hydrolyzable phosphoisoprenoing analog instead of GGpp, no REP-1 contamination was observed in the 90-kDa peak. 3A. Rak and K. Alexandrov, submitted for publication. The interaction of RabGGTase and REP-1 was monitored and quantitated by fluorescence titrations in the presence of a fluorescent analog of GGpp (mFpp) (18Thoma N.H. Iakovenko A. Owen D. Scheidig A.S. Waldmann H. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12043-12052Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 19Owen D.J. Alexandrov K. Rostkova E. Scheidig A.J. Goody R.S. Waldmann H. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1999; 38: 509-512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). First, we titrated 200 nm of the RabGGTase·mFpp complex with increasing concentrations of REP-1. Under the experimental conditions used, essentially all of the isoprenoid is complexed with the enzyme due to the high affinity of this interaction (∼30 nm) (18Thoma N.H. Iakovenko A. Owen D. Scheidig A.S. Waldmann H. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12043-12052Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). There was a saturable increase in direct fluorescence intensity following the addition of REP-1 (Fig. 3). Analysis of the stoichiometry indicated that one mole of REP-1 bound to one mole of the RabGGTase·mFpp complex (Fig. 3). A least-squares fit of the data to a quadratic equation led to a Kdvalue of 10 ± 2 nm. The kinetics of REP-1 binding to the RabGGTase·GGpp complex were studied by rapid mixing methodology utilizing changes in the tryptophan fluorescence upon REP-1 binding to the RabGGTase·GGpp complex. In a typical experiment, 100 nm RabGGTase was mixed with different concentrations of REP-1 in the presence of 2 μm GGpp. Fluorescence decreased on mixing RabGGTase and REP-1 in the presence of GGpp (Fig. 4) but not in its absence (data not shown). A similar decrease was observed in the presence of farnesyl pyrophosphate but not of geranyl pyrophosphate (data not shown). The secondary plot of the observed rate constants (kobs) against the concentration of REP-1 is shown in Fig. 4B. A linear fit of the data yielded a second order rate constant of 0.08 nm−1s−1 (Fig. 4B). The dissociation rate constant (koff), inferred form of the intercept of the linear fit with the ordinate, was not well defined (Fig.4B). When the reaction mixture was supplemented with Fpp instead of GGpp, the inferred koff was distinctly larger, indicating weaker binding (Fig. 4C). To measure the dissociation rate of the RabGGTase·GGpp·REP-1 directly, 100 nm RabGGTase and 100 nm REP-1 were mixed with a large molar excess (700 nm) of double prenylated dansyl-labeled Rab7·REP-1 complex (dansRab7GG·REP-1) in the presence of 1 μmGGpp (16Thoma N.H. Iakovenko A. Kalinin A. Waldmann H. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The prenylated dansRab7·REP-1 complex can only associate with the transferase once the latter dissociates from the RabGGTase·GGpp·REP-1 complex. At high concentrations of thedansRab7GG·REP-1 complex, the observed rate reflects the dissociation rate of RabGGTase from REP-1·GGpp complex. The obtained transient is shown in Fig. 4D. Fitting the data to a single exponential function resulted inkobs = 0.5 s−1. A further increase in the concentration of the dansRab7GG·REP-1 complex did not influence the observed rate constants so that this value represents the genuine koff of RabGGTase from the RabGGTase·GGpp·REP-1 complex. On the basis of dissociation and association rate constants, the affinity of REP-1 to the RabGGTase·GGpp complex was calculated as Kd = 0.5 s−1/0.08 nm−1 s−1 = 6.25 nm, which is in a good agreement with the equilibrium measurements. It remains unclear up to this point whether the RabGGTase·GGpp·REP-1 ternary complex is a catalytically competent intermediate en route to double prenylation. We therefore set out to determine the binding and prenylation rate constants of different prenylation reaction intermediates including the RabGGTase·GGpp·REP-1 complex. If binding of REP-1 to the RabGGTase·GGpp complex is the first step in the prenylation machinery assembly, then association of Rab7 with ternary complex must occur in the next step. We measured the association rate constant of Rab7 to the ternary complex. To study binding independently of catalysis, we chose a mutant Rab7(C205SC207S), in which all prenylatable cysteine residues are replaced by serine (Rab7SS). This mutant was previously shown to interact with REP-1 and RabGGTase with kinetics similar to those of wild type protein (15Alexandrov K. Simon I. Yurchenko V. Iakovenko A. Rostkova E. Scheidig A.J. Goody R.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 16Thoma N.H. Iakovenko A. Kalinin A. Waldmann H. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For determination of the association kinetics, 100 nm of Rab7SS loaded with mantGDP was rapidly mixed with increasing concentrations of the RabGGTase·REP-1 complex in the presence of 2 μm GGpp. Under the chosen conditions, the RabGGTase·GGpp·REP-1 complex can be viewed as a single entity, since the chosen concentrations of components are far above theKd for their interaction. The observed single exponential rate constants were plotted against the concentration of the RabGGTase·GGpp·REP-1 complex. Fitting the data resulted in an association rate constant (kon) of 0.0012 nm−1 s−1 for Rab7 binding to the RabGGTase·GGpp·REP-1 complex (Fig.5A). Next, we measured the dissociation rate constant of Rab7 from the RabGGTase·GGpp·REP-1·Rab7 complex. 250 nmmantGDP·Rab7SS, 250 nm REP-1 and 2 μmRabGGTase were mixed rapidly with 2 μm Rab7SS in the presence of 2 μm GGpp. The observed decrease in fluorescence is due to dissociation of the labeled mGDP·Rab7SS from the complex, followed by association of the excess unlabeled Rab7SS. We determined the dissociation rate constant to be 0.0337 s−1. Based on the ratio of association and dissociation rate constants, the affinity of Rab7 to the RabGGTase·REP-1·GGpp complex could be calculated as Kd = 0.037 s−1/0.0012 nm−1 s−1= 28 nm. To determine which of the two possible routes is taken in the assembly of the prenylation machinery, it is necessary to identify the rate-determining steps. The currently available kinetic and equilibrium constants of the prenylation reaction are summarized in Scheme FS1. At high concentrations of RabGGTase, REP-1, Rab7, and GGpp, the second prenylation event, converting singly to doubly prenylated Rab7 is mostly rate-determining (6Alexandrov K. Simon I. Iakovenko A. Holz B. Goody R.S. Scheidig A.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 460-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 15Alexandrov K. Simon I. Yurchenko V. Iakovenko A. Rostkova E. Scheidig A.J. Goody R.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 16Thoma N.H. Iakovenko A. Kalinin A. Waldmann H. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).2 At low concentrations of components, when the dissociation rates govern the kinetics, binding of Rab7 to REP-1 and the second prenylation step would become rate-limiting (SchemeFS1). To assess the feasibility of RabGGTase·GGpp·REP-1 as a reaction intermediate, we determined the rate of prenylation upon exposure of Rab7 to this complex. We used an in vitroprenylation based on changes in the retention time of Rab7 on the reversed phase matrix upon prenylation.2 The main advantage of this assay is that it allows parallel monitoring of the rates of single and double prenylation. Rab7 was mixed with a preformed RabGGTase·GGpp·REP-1 complex in the presence of excess GGpp. Aliquots of the reaction mixture were removed at defined time points and analyzed. The observed transients for the decay of Rab7 and the production of double prenylated Rab7 (Rab7_GG) are shown in Fig. 6. Formation of singly prenylated Rab7 proceeded with k1 = 0.20 ± 0.04 s−1, while the rate constant for conversion of singly into double prenylated Rab7 was k2 = 0.029 ± 0.007 s−1. These are close to the rate constants determined for mixing the Rab7·REP-1 complex with RabGGTase·GGpp complex (k1 = 0.16 s−1 and 0.039 s−1).2 Under the conditions used (4 μM RabGGTase·GGpp·REP-1 complex mixed with 4 μm Rab7), we can use the second order rate constant for the association reaction determined as described above to calculate half-life for the association reaction. This is calculated to be ∼0.2 s−1, whereas the half-life for the dissociation of the RabGGTase·GGpp·REP-1 complex into RabGGTase·GGpp and REP-1 is 1.3 s. Thus association to the ternary complex will occur under these conditions. If this were not an active complex in the sense of prenylation ability, it would then have to redissociate at 0.037 s−1 before further dissociation to give free REP-1, which could associate in the “correct” form with Rab7. The kinetic data on prenylation mediated by the RabGGTase·GGpp·REP-1 complex rule out this pathway, since it would lead to much slower prenylation than using the standard mixing regime (generation of the Rab7·REP-1 complex followed by binding of RabGGTase·GGpp). Therefore, we conclude that the RabGGTase·GGpp·REP-1 complex represents a functionally relevant interaction between two proteins, and thus generation of the ternary protein complex can occur directly from this binary complex by binding of Rab7. Scheme FS1 summarizes the rate constants determined for prenylation proceeding via formation of the GGTase·REP-1·GGpp complex. The traditional view of the Rab escort protein is that of a molecular chaperone that binds to the newly synthesized Rab protein and presents it first to the RabGGTase and, following prenylation, accompanies it to the membrane. In this work we have investigated the existence of alternative pathways of the prenylation complex assembly. Solid phase precipitation assays provided initial evidence that RabGGTase and REP-1 can interact in the presence of GGpp with high affinity. Nearly stoichiometric co-precipitation of REP-1 and the RabGGTase was observed, while essentially no binding could be detected when GGpp was omitted. Fluorescence titrations indicated that REP-1 bound RabGGTase with a 1:1 stoichiometry and an affinity of ∼10 nm. Due to the absence of appropriate signals, we could only approximate the binding of RabGGTase to REP in the absence of GGpp as being in the low micromolar range. Significantly, higher affinities can be ruled out based on surface-plasmon resonance experiments 4K. Alexandrov, unpublished data. and the observed stoichiometry in the solid phase precipitation. The finding of a tight RabGGTase·GGpp·REP complex contradicts the traditional model of prenylation complex assembly (2Casey P.J. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5289-5292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 15Alexandrov K. Simon I. Yurchenko V. Iakovenko A. Rostkova E. Scheidig A.J. Goody R.S. Eur. J.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and raises a number of interesting questions. First of all, the role of phosphoisoprenoid in the formation of such complex is quite intriguing, and three models can be considered in this regard. The first possibility is that REP interacts with the active site of RabGGTase via phosphoisoprenoid. However, the observation that the rate of mFpp dissociation from the RabGGTase·mFpp·REP-1 complex is not significantly different from koff of RabGGTase·mFpp complex speaks against this model.4 The second possibility is that a new phosphoisoprenoid binding site is formed at the interface between RabGGTase and REP with GGpp, thus “gluing” the molecules together. Due to the presence of a canonical lipid binding site on RabGGTase this, however, would result in a 2:1 stoichiometry of phosphoisoprenoid to protein complex. So far, we have found no experimental confirmation of this prediction.4Finally, it is conceivable that binding of phosphoisoprenoid induces a conformational change in RabGGTase that leads to complex formation with REP. More experiments will be needed to provide evidence for any of these hypothesis. It is surprising that such a tight complex has evaded identification for so many years. This is probably attributable to the rapid dissociation rates of the complex. For instance, the RabGGTase·GGpp·REP complex cannot be isolated by gel filtration unless the column is equilibrated in the presence of GGpp (15Alexandrov K. Simon I. Yurchenko V. Iakovenko A. Rostkova E. Scheidig A.J. Goody R.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). If this is not done, phosphoisoprenoid dissociating from the complex is retained by the column much longer than the rapidly migrating proteins.4 Finally, we have addressed the question of the kinetic competence of the RabGGTase·GGpp·REP complex. The strategy chosen was to determine the major rate constants governing the binding of the intermediates that lead to assembly of the quaternary prenylation complex. Rate constants are summarized in Scheme FS1. Examination of the association and dissociation rate constants indicate the presence of three time regimes. First, binding of GGpp to the transferase is fast having the highest association and dissociation rate constants. Second, binding of REP-1 to RabGGTase·GGpp is intermediate with dissociation and association being slower than those for GGpp. Finally, binding of Rab7 to the ternary RabGGTase GGpp·REP-1 complex is slow. The measured association rate is 10 times slower than for direct Rab7·REP-1 interaction (6Alexandrov K. Simon I. Iakovenko A. Holz B. Goody R.S. Scheidig A.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 460-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It is, however, remarkable that both association and dissociation rate constants for all complexes decrease so that the observed affinity at all three steps are comparable and generally lie in the low nanomolar range. Together with the prenylation rate constant, it ensues that the rate-determining step for assembly of the prenylation machinery is dependent on the concentration of all components. At high concentrations of RabGGTase, REP-1, Rab7, and GGpp all binding events are sufficiently fast so that the second prenylation step becomes rate-determining. At low concentrations, however, the kinetics are dominated by the dissociation rate constants of the individual steps. The dissociation rate constant of Rab7 from the RabGGTase·GGpp·REP-1 complex is sufficiently slow that the complex cannot equilibrate before transfer occurs. Additional rate determining steps at low concentration are the prenyl transfer and, also assuming a low concentration of GGpp, product release (16Thoma N.H. Iakovenko A. Kalinin A. Waldmann H. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It follows from this kinetic scheme that under conditions where the concentration of RabGGTase, REP-1 and GGpp are slightly elevated compared with that of Rab the pathway proceeding via the RabGGTase·GGpp·REP-1 intermediate is indeed populated. The RabGGTase·REP-1·GGpp complex can thus constitute a kinetically competent intermediate in the assembly of the prenylation machinery, and the affinities for this interaction are sufficiently tight to be of relevance in vivo. The choice between canonical and alternative pathways will depend on the concentration of individual components and may therefore be dependant on the metabolic state of the cell. Currently very little is known about the concentration and localization of phosphoisoprenoids in living cells, and further research will be needed to clarify this point. What could be the physiological relevance of such a RabGGTase·GGpp·REP-1 complex? One possibility is that the role of REP-1 as a chaperone and transport protein might not be as static as previously believed. Rather than waiting for a Rab protein to be synthesized and then transport it to the membrane, REP-1 could already be in complex with RabGGTase·GGpp. Once Rab is bound, prenylation could quickly be initiated. It should be noted that the rate of double prenylation is surprisingly slow, with a characteristic half-time of more than 30 s. It is conceivable that the entire quaternary complex, composed of RabGGTase·GGpp·REP·Rab, travels toward the membrane while prenylation is occurring. By this mechanism, the two most time-consuming steps in the cycle, namely the prenylation of Rab7 and the transport of the Rab·REP complex to the membrane, could be combined. This is consistent with previous findings that the presence of RabGGTase did not inhibit membrane association of the prenylated Rab5·REP-1 complex (10Alexandrov K. Horiuchi H. Steele-Mortimer O. Seabra M.C. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5262-5273Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Further in vivo studies focused on localization of the individual components are required to clarify this issue. Thanks are due to Catherine Katzka for critically reading the manuscript.

The association of helper T-cell epitopes with the mobile loop in Hsp10s from mycobacteria and bacteriophage T4 suggests that the mobile loop facilitates proteolytic processing and presentation of adjacent sequences. Sites of initial proteolytic cleavage were mapped in divergent Hsp10s after treatment with a variety of proteases including cathepsin S. Each protease preferentially cleaved the Hsp10s in the mobile loop. Flexibility in the 22-residue mobile loop most probably allows it to conform to protease active sites. Three variants of the bacteriophage T4 Hsp10 were constructed with deletions in the mobile loop to test the hypothesis that shorter loops would be less sensitive to proteolysis. The two largest deletions effectively inhibited proteolysis by several proteases. Circular dichroism spectra and chemical cross-linking of the deletion variants indicate that the secondary and quaternary structures of the variants are native-like, and all three variants were more thermostable than the wild-type Hsp10.

Cryptic epitopes can be shielded from presentation by various mechanisms that ultimately interfere with binding of peptides to the class II MHC1 protein (7Moudgil K.D. Deng H. Nanda N.K. Grewal I.S. Ametani A. Sercarz E.E. J. Autoimmun. 1996; 9: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) or transport of the complex to the cell surface (8Castellino F. Zappacosta F. Coligan J.E. Germain R.N. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4048-4057PubMed Google Scholar). Antigen processing contributes directly to these mechanisms by removing or failing to remove antigen sequences that influence presentation of the epitope. Studies testing the role of proteases in knock-out mice have been complicated by the requirement for proteolytic maturation of the class II MHC protein. Nevertheless, antigen presentation is altered when cathepsin S or cathepsin L deficiency is combined with invariant chain deficiency (9Nakagawa T.Y. Rudensky A.Y. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 172: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Thus, the pathway of proteolytic degradation can influence antigen presentation. Early studies suggested that antigen primary sequence affected antigen processing at the level of recognition and binding by a protease (1Janssen R. Wauben M. van der Zee R. de Gast M. Tommassen J. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1187-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar,10Van Noort J.M. Boon J. Van der Drift A.C.M. Wagenaar J.P.A. Boots A.M.H. Boog C.J.P. Eur. J.

The creation of a dibasic cleavage site for a prohormone processing enzyme enhanced the presentation of a flanking epitope in hen egg lysozyme (11Schneider S.C. Ohmen J. Fosdick L. Gladstone B. Guo J. Ametani A. Sercarz E.E. Deng H. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 20-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and disruption of a cleavage site for asparaginyl endopeptidase interfered with presentation of the tetanus toxoid antigen (12Antoniou A.N. Blackwood S.L. Mazzeo D. Watts C. Immunity. 2000; 12: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, other reports have suggested that three-dimensional structure modulates antigen processing. Stabilization by intramolecular cross-links inhibited presentation of an epitope of hen egg lysozyme (13So T. Ito H. Koga T. Watanabe S. Ueda T. Imoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32136-32140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). An acid-induced structural change enhanced presentation of an epitope of influenza hemagglutinin (3Chianese-Bullock K.A. Russell H.I. Moller C. Gerhard W. Monaco J.J. Eisenlohr L.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1599-1607PubMed Google Scholar). Unfolding prior to processing disrupted presentation of an immunodominant epitope of mouse immunoglobulin (2Ma C. Whiteley P.E. Cameron P.M.

The distribution of local disorder in the antigen could modulate antigen processing. It is well established that proteases tend to cleave between domains in multi-domain proteins and at other locally disordered sites. Even in a single-domain protein, proteolytically sensitive sites tend to occur in segments characterized by high crystallographic B-factors (14Novotny J. Bruccoleri R.E. FEBS Lett. 1987; 211: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The conformation of the polypeptide around the incipient cleavage site must be easily distorted to accommodate binding to the protease (15Hubbard S.J. Campbell S.F. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 507-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 16Hubbard S.J. Eisenmenger F. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, no ATP-dependent protein unfolding activity (other than acidification) has been described for the lysosome. The pH of the antigen-processing compartment probably depends on the cell type and degree of activation (17Drakesmith H. ONeil D. Schneider S.C. Binks M. Medd P. Sercarz E. Beverley P. Chain B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14903-14908Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, most proteins retain native-like three-dimensional structure in acidic environments as low as pH 2 in many cases (18Dill K.A. Shortle D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 795-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Analyses of published structural data and epitope maps for several model antigens have suggested that local structural disorder increases immunogenicity in the adjacent sequences (19Landry S.J. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 527-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Landry S.J. J. Theor. Biol. 2000; 203: 189-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Here, we have tested this hypothesis by analyzing the structure and immunology of bacteriophage T4 Hsp10 (T4Hsp10). As in all Hsp10s, T4Hsp10 has a flexibly disordered Hsp60-binding mobile loop (21Landry S.J. Taher A. Georgopoulos C. van der Vies S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11622-11627Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) that we suspected would favor presentation of flanking sequences to helper T-cells. T4Hsp10 is homologous to bacterial and mammalian Hsp10s by comparison of the respective three-dimensional structures, although it exhibits less than 20% sequence identity with any of these Hsp10s (22Hunt J.F. van der Vies S.M. Henry L. Deisenhofer J. Cell. 1997; 90: 361-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The mobile loops of Escherichia coli Hsp10 (GroES) and T4Hsp10 contain preferred sites for cleavage by trypsin and protease K, respectively (20Landry S.J. J. Theor.

Chem. 2002; 277: 161-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we confirm the presence of an immunodominant epitope adjacent to the mobile loop in T4Hsp10. Here, we examined the potential for three-dimensional structure to influence processing and presentation by analyzing the proteolytic sensitivity of the mobile loop in Hsp10s. We find that treatment of diverse Hsp10s with a variety of proteases consistently yields products of initial cleavage in the mobile loop, suggesting that antigen processing by lysosomal proteases would initiate with cleavage in the mobile loop. Variants of T4Hsp10 containing deletions in the mobile loop were constructed in order to probe the changes in protease sensitivity and immune responses. Our results suggest that loop deletion can reduce proteolytic sensitivity without gross disruption of antigen three-dimensional structure. In a companion paper (27Dai G. Carmicle S. Steede N.K.

McGrath, Axys Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) in a total volume of 65 μl containing 50 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.5, 192 mm KCl, 1 μm dithiothreitol, and 0.8 μg/ml protease proceeded for 30 min at room temperature and then were terminated by the addition of E-64 (Sigma) to 10 μm. Reactions with protease K containing 50 μm target protein, 40 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 192 mm KCl, 1 μmdithiothreitol, and 25 μg/ml protease proceeded for 15 min on ice and then were terminated by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to 20 μm. Reactions with papain containing 10 mm MES-KOH (pH 5.7), 4 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 20 μg/ml protease proceeded for 60 min at room temperature and then were terminated by the addition of E-64 to 5 μm. An aliquot of each reaction was mixed with SDS-containing sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE using the Tris/Tricine buffer system (29Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar), and stained with Coomassie Blue. Quantification of the remaining intact protein was by integration of the band in the image of the stained gel captured by an AlphaImager 2200 (Alpha Innotech). For mapping cleavage sites in E. coli and human Hsp10s, 0.5 μl of the reaction was analyzed using a Thermofinnigan Lasermat matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer (Tulane Coordinated Instrumentation Facility) and α-cyano-3-hydroxycinnamic acid as the matrix. Mass determinations were calibrated with substance P ((M + H)+, 1349 Da), which was co-deposited on the target prior to analysis. Fragment mass predictions were generated with PeptideMass 2Found on the Internet at www.expasy.ch. using Swiss-Prot sequence entries CH10ECOLI or CH10HUMAN. Far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded on an OLIS spectropolarimeter using a cell with path length 1 mm. Samples contained 25 μm protein (subunits) in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, at 25 °C. The wavelength was scanned in triplicate between 300 and 188.2 nm using 110 points, and the spectra were averaged. A similarly recorded background spectrum was subtracted from the sample spectrum to obtain the protein spectrum. Melting curves monitored by CD were obtained by recording the CD at 205 and 206 nm at 2° intervals over the range of 22 to 84 °C and then averaging the values at the two wavelengths for each temperature (reported as θ205.5). The data for each protein were fit by nonlinear regression (GraphPad Prism) to the equation y={(yf+mf·[T])+(yu+mu·[T])·exp[(ΔHm/RT)·((T−Tm)/Tm)]}/(1+exp[(ΔHm/RT)Equation 1 ·((T−Tm)/Tm)])where y represents the observed CD signal,yf and yu are the intercepts, and mf and muthe slopes of the pre- and posttransition base lines, T is the temperature, Tm is the midpoint of the thermal unfolding curve, and ΔHm is the enthalpy change for unfolding at Tm (30Pace C.N. Hebert E.J. Shaw K.L. Schell D. Both V. Krajcikova D. Sevcik J. Wilson K.S. Dauter Z. Hartley R.W. Grimsley G.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 271-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Thermal unfolding was found not to be reversible, and thus ΔHm cannot be taken as the enthalpy for equilibrium unfolding of the protein. Nevertheless,Tm gives an indication of protein stability against thermal denaturation. Reactions were initiated by addition of 25% glutaraldehyde to achieve a final concentration of 2% (w/v) in 100 μl of 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, and 100 μm T4Hsp10, T4Hsp10dLIG, T4Hsp10d8, or T4Hsp10d8C. After 2, 10, or 20 min at room temperature, reactions were quenched by the addition of sodium borohydride to a final concentration of 400 mm. After 20 min, proteins were precipitated at room temperature with 10% trichloroacetic acid in the presence of 100 mm NaCl, collected by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g, combined with NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen), run on a NuPAGE bis-Tris 4–20% polyacrylamide gel with NuPAGE MES buffer (Invitrogen), and stained with Coomassie Blue. The proteolytic sensitivity of diverse Hsp10 proteins was probed with several serine and cysteine proteases including cathepsin S. Cysteine proteases constitute the bulk of the lysosomal proteases, and cathepsin S has been implicated in antigen processing (9Nakagawa T.Y. Rudensky A.Y. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 172: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). A strong preference for cleavage in the mobile loop should dominate the cleavage site selectivity regardless of Hsp10 sequence or protease specificity. Such a highly preferred site most likely would be the site of first cleavage by the mixture of proteases in the lysosome. For each combination of Hsp10 and protease, experimental conditions were optimized for the accumulation of products resulting from an initial endoproteolytic cleavage, as judged by the resolution of one or more large fragments in SDS-PAGE. For each protease and Hsp10, one or more abundant fragments were observed at ∼3000 and 7000 Da by mass spectrometry (TableI). Cleavage sites (Fig.1) were identified by the presence of both N- and C-terminal fragments corresponding to the masses predicted from the Hsp10 sequence (±21 Da). There were several examples of alternative cleavage sites in human Hsp10 for a single protease. A secondary site was evident as a less abundant pair of large and small fragments. It was clear that each fragment was derived from cleavage of the full-length protein for the following two reasons. First, the difference in mass between large fragments was equal to the difference in mass between small fragments; and second, the difference was equal to the mass of residues between the alternative sites, e.g.Gly28–Met31 in the cathepsin S digestion of human Hsp10. Initial cleavage sites in T4Hsp10 could not be determined from the mass spectrometry data. Although fragments clustered near 3000 and 7000, the sum of the masses for predominant fragments was less than the total mass of T4Hsp10. Presumably, the initial cleavage products were rapidly converted to smaller fragments.Table IProducts of Hsp10 limited proteolysis assigned by mass spectrometryHsp10ProteaseN-terminal fragmentC-terminal fragmentObservedPredictedDifferenceSequenceObservedPredictedDifferenceSequenceDaDaE. coliCathepsin S31583159−1Met1–Thr2872257241−16Glu29–Ala97Papain306030591Met1–Leu27734573423Thr28 –Ala97HumanCathepsin S30483050−2Ala1–Lys2777547764−10Gly28–Asp10134063408−2Ala1–Met3174027406−4Leu32–Asp101Papain3062305012Ala1–Lys277785776421Gly28 –Asp1012934292212Ala1–Thr267908789216Lys27 –Asp101341934109Ala1–Met317429741118Leu32 –Asp101Proteinase K30483050−2Ala1–Lys27776577641Gly28 –Asp10134053408−3Ala1–Met31741074064Leu32 –Asp10137443747−3Ala1–Glu347085706718Lys35–Asp101 Open table in a new tab Deletion variants of T4Hsp10 were constructed to test the relationship of mobile loop size and flexibility to proteolytic sensitivity (Fig. 2). We reasoned that a shorter loop would have less flexibility to adopt the conformation necessary for binding to a protease. The 3-residue deletion in T4Hsp10dLIG was designed to shorten the loop and stabilize a nascent hairpin turn in the center of the loop (21Landry S.J. Taher A. Georgopoulos C. van der Vies S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11622-11627Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) by removing a glycine and by placing an isoleucine opposite threonine 31 on the other β-strand (31Richardson A. vanderVies S.M. Keppel F. Taher A. Landry S.J. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 52-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The 8-residue deletion in T4Hsp10d8 symmetrically removed from T4Hsp10dLIG four residues in each strand of the nascent hairpin. The 8-residue deletion in T4Hsp10d8C removed from T4Hsp10dLIG a segment that forms an α helix in the T4Hsp10 crystal lattice but that is essentially disordered in solution (21Landry S.J. Taher A. Georgopoulos C. van der Vies S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11622-11627Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The deletions affect sequences only within the mobile loop and thus were not expected to disturb the ordered part of the native structure. The biophysical properties of the deletion variants were similar to those of wild-type T4Hsp10. Each variant accumulated in the soluble phase of E. coli cells at high levels and was purified using the protocol developed for T4Hsp10. T4Hsp10 and the three variants eluted from Q-Sepharose at the same position in the gradient, but the variants eluted from hydroxyapatite at elevated sodium phosphate concentrations. Whereas T4Hsp10 eluted at 65 mm, T4Hsp10dLIG eluted at 70 mm, T4Hsp10d8 at 120 mm, and T4Hsp10d8C at 150 mm. The far-UV CD spectra of T4Hsp10 and the deletion variants were similar, as expected for retention of the native, mostly β-sheet secondary structure (Fig.3A). However, in the spectrum of T4Hsp10d8C, the intensity of the band at 198 nm was more positive, which is consistent with a larger fraction of β-sheet (32Brahms S. Brahms J. Spach G. Brack A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3208-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The thermal stability of T4Hsp10 and the deletion variants was evaluated by monitoring the CD at 205.5 nm over the temperature range of 22 to 84 °C. Thermal denaturation of all four proteins was evident as a cooperative transition in the CD intensity (Fig. 3B). Spectra recorded after the transition exhibited strong minima near 200 nm (data not shown), which is expected if a substantial portion of the denatured proteins behaves as a random coil (32Brahms S. Brahms J. Spach G. Brack A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3208-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The deletion variants melted at temperatures ranging from 3 to 7 °C higher than T4Hsp10. The quaternary structures of T4Hsp10 and the deletion variants were analyzed by chemical cross-linking. Treatment of T4Hsp10 with glutaraldehyde generated a ladder of six polypeptides with slower electrophoretic mobility in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4). Because T4Hsp10 is known to form a heptamer (22Hunt J.F. van der Vies S.M. Henry L. Deisenhofer J. Cell. 1997; 90: 361-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we assigned the six bands to dimer through heptamer. The bands were less intense with increasing molecular weights up to hexamer and heptamer, which were more intense than pentamer. A longer incubation with the cross-linker increased the intensity of the hexamer and heptamer at the expense of lower molecular weight bands, but no discrete bands above heptamer were formed. Thus, we concluded that the cross-linking reaction with T4Hsp10 is essentially complete upon formation of the heptamer. Each deletion variant formed a ladder of cross-linked polypeptides that was similar to that formed by T4Hsp10. As for T4Hsp10, a longer incubation with the cross-linker increased the amount of heptamer but not higher order multimers. The cross-linked samples of T4Hsp10d8 also produced a diffuse band near and above the molecular weight of heptamer. This material probably is the result of multiple intersubunit and/or intrasubunit cross-links (33Benaroudj N. Fang B. Triniolles F. Ghelis C. Ladjimi M.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 34Farr C.D. Slepenkov S.V. Witt S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9744-9748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), which are somehow more likely in the modified mobile loop. Nevertheless, among the discrete cross-linked species after the 10-min incubation, the heptamer was the most abundant. The heptamer species of T4Hsp10d8C was poorly represented among the cross-linked species. This variant may have been resistant to cross-linking because the mobile loop was less flexible. At longer incubation times, more of the T4Hsp10d8C accumulated in the tetramer and pentamer forms, suggesting that an oligomer of that size or larger predominated. Because the cross-linked species discontinued above the level of heptamer, we concluded that T4Hsp10d8C also existed predominantly as the heptamer. Differences between T4Hsp10 and the deletion variants in proteolytic sensitivity were largely independent of the choice of protease (Fig. 5). Sensitivity of T4Hsp10dLIG was similar to that of T4Hsp10 except for slight decreases in sensitivity to trypsin (30%) and protease V8 (20%). T4Hsp10d8 was much less sensitive than T4Hsp10 to trypsin (6-fold) and cathepsin S (6-fold) but only slightly less sensitive to protease K (10%) and protease V8 (20%). T4Hsp10d8C was much less sensitive than T4Hsp10 to all four proteases (protease K, 4-fold; trypsin, 5-fold; protease V8, 36-fold; and cathepsin S, 14-fold). Earlier work comparing helper T-cell epitope maps to structural data indicated that helper T-cell epitopes were frequently associated with adjacent unstable loops. We hypothesized that unstable loops promote presentation of adjacent sequences by virtue of their sensitivity to endoproteolytic processing in antigen presenting cells. For the present work, Hsp10 was selected for an examination of the relationship of structure and proteolytic sensitivity because helper T-cell epitopes have been found adjacent to the mobile loop (24Kim J. Sette A. Rodda S. Southwood S. Sieling P.A. Mehra V. Ohmen J.D. Oliveros J. Appella E. Higashimoto Y. Rea T.H. Bloom B.R. Modlin R.L. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 335-343PubMed Google Scholar, 25Hussain R.

Chem. 2002; 277: 161-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and the mobile loop provides a natural target for initial endoproteolytic cleavage during antigen processing. Results from mapping the sites of initial cleavage in E. coli and human Hsp10s demonstrate the exceptional proteolytic sensitivity of the mobile loop. When combined with the earlier studies on E. coli and bacteriophage T4 Hsp10s, we find that four proteases cleave three divergent Hsp10s within a 12-residue segment of the 22-residue mobile loop. The shared preference of the proteases for this segment cannot be attributed to a coincidence of required primary sequences. The proteases exhibit little sequence specificity (35Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, San Diego1998Google Scholar). Trypsin requires a positively charged residue (Lys/Arg) in P1, but the 13 Lys/Arg in E. coli Hsp10 and the 15 Lys/Arg in human Hsp10 are evenly distributed in the sequences. The other proteases are less specific. Proteinase K prefers aromatic and hydrophobic residues in P1. Papain prefers bulky hydrophobic residues in P2 and slightly prefers Lys/Arg in P1. Cathepsin S prefers branched hydrophobic residues in P2. Local structural disorder in the mobile loop probably is the most important factor determining the initial cleavage site. Local disorder is typical of protein segments that are easily distorted into a conformation suitable for binding to the protease active site (15Hubbard S.J. Campbell S.F. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 507-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Preferential cleavage in the mobile loop can be explained by the loop being larger and more flexible than other potentially protease-sensitive sites in the Hsp10s (Fig.6). The roof β-hairpin of E. coli Hsp10 was predicted to be metastable on the basis of its high B-factors and minimal tertiary structural contacts (36Hunt J.F. Weaver A.J. Landry S.J. Gierasch L.M. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1996; 379: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Likewise, the roof β-hairpin of human Hsp10 has enough segmental disorder to give resolvable NMR resonances, and the roof β-hairpin was not observed in the crystal structure (37Landry S.J. Steede N.K. Maskos K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10975-10986Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although highly flexible, the roof β-hairpin may be too small to accommodate the deformation required for binding to a protease. A segment of only seven residues inE. coli Hsp10 has B-factors that exceed the average value, and only four residues of human Hsp10 were observed by NMR. Hubbard and Thornton propose that 12 residues are necessary for efficient cleavage by trypsin (16Hubbard S.J. Eisenmenger F. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The peripheral loop of T4Hsp10 has 12 residues with above average B-factors, but resonances for the peripheral loop were not observed in our previous NMR study, indicating that it is not as flexible as the mobile loop. Thus, the peripheral loop is eight residues shorter than the mobile loop and much less flexible, which explains the preferential cleavage in the mobile loop. The structure of an Hsp10 in the antigen-processing compartment should be similar to the structures previously described by x-ray crystallography and NMR. Antigen processing is believed to occur in acidic conditions in or near the lysosome. Much of the structural information about E. coli and human Hsp10s was gathered in acidic conditions, and the structure is essentially unchanged over a wide range of pH. Crystals of E. coli Hsp10 were grown at pH 5.5 (36Hunt J.F. Weaver A.J. Landry S.J. Gierasch L.M. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1996; 379: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), and NMR studies on mobile loop conformation and dynamics were carried out at pH levels ranging from 4.0 to 7.0 (23Landry S.J. Zeilstra-Ryalls J. Fayet O. Georgopoulos C. Gierasch L.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 38Landry S.J. Steede N.K. Garaudy A.M. Maskos K. Viitanen P.V. Altman R.B. Dunker A.K. Hunter L. Klein T.E. Lauderdale K. Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing '99. World Scientific, Singapore1999: 520-531Google Scholar). Likewise, crystals of human Hsp10 were grown at pH 3.5, 3J. F. Hunt, B. J. Scott, L. Henry, J. Guidry, S. J. Landry, and J. Deisenhofer, unpublished results. and NMR studies were performed from pH 3.5 to 6.8 (37Landry S.J. Steede N.K. Maskos K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10975-10986Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In all cases, the extent and behavior of the flexible segments were essentially identical. Thus, a highly protease-sensitive region created by local disorder in the Hsp10 structure should be the target of initial endoproteolytic cleavagein vitro and in vivo. Three mobile loop deletion variants of T4Hsp10 were constructed to test the hypothesis that reductions in loop size and flexibility inhibit proteolytic cleavage. Low-resolution structural analysis suggests that the consequences of the deletions were restricted to the mobile loop. The behavior of the variants during purification was similar to that of T4Hsp10. The circular dichroism spectra of the variants suggest that their secondary structure content is similar to that of T4Hsp10. T4Hsp10d8C had a slightly larger β-sheet content, but this could be confined to the mobile loop. Thermal denaturation curves for the variants exhibited highly cooperative transitions, indicating that the proteins have well organized, probably native-like structure. The transition midpoints for all three variants were at elevated temperatures relative to T4Hsp10, as predicted for stabilized structure in the mobile loop. Finally, the results from chemical cross-linking suggest that the variants assume the native heptameric quaternary structure. The mobile loop deletions reduced proteolytic sensitivity according to expected changes in loop structure and flexibility. The deletions were designed to shrink the loop and simultaneously stabilize a nascent β-hairpin conformation. The added conformational restraints should increase the energetic cost of substrate binding to the protease. The three-residue deletion was designed to stabilize the nascent hairpin without substantially shortening the loop. Hubbard et al.(16Hubbard S.J. Eisenmenger F. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) found that trypsin requires the deformation of at least 10 residues of the substrate around the cleavage site, and the deformation is much easier in a loop of 12 residues or more. Because the mobile loop of T4Hsp10 spans the 22-residue sequence from Gln24 to Val45, removal of three residues should not severely affect the ability of the loop to be deformed. In T4Hsp10dLIG, sensitivity to protease K and cathepsin S is unaffected, and sensitivity to trypsin and protease V8 is only slightly reduced. In contrast, removal of 11 residues from the loop shrinks it to a borderline size for the deformation required by trypsin. Accordingly, T4Hsp10d8 and T4Hsp10d8C become much more resistant to trypsin and cathepsin S by comparison to T4Hsp10 and T4Hsp10dLIG. The structure of the remaining loop segment also may influence proteolytic sensitivity. The deletion in T4Hsp10d8 leaves a segment of nascent helix intact, whereas the deletion in T4Hsp10d8C completely removes the helix. The tendency for the loop in T4Hsp10d8 (as well as T4Hsp10 and T4Hsp10dLIG) to explore alternative structures may make it more probable that the loop will adopt a conformation acceptable to the protease. In contrast, exclusive formation of β-sheet in the loop of T4Hsp10d8C would strongly disfavor proteolysis. Thus, differences in loop structure could account for the greater sensitivity of T4Hsp10d8 than T4Hsp10d8C to cleavage by proteinase K and protease V8. The results presented here establish the broad sensitivity to proteolysis of Hsp10 mobile loops, and they support the theory that local disorder promotes presentation to helper T cells of the adjacent sequence by providing sites for proteolytic cleavage. Mobile loop deletions reduce proteolytic sensitivity to varying degrees, and the structural changes appear to be localized to the mobile loop. Thus, loop deletion provides a simple strategy for modifying epitope immunodominance. We are grateful to P. Wittung-Stafshede and J. Guidry for access to the CD spectropolarimeter and assistance with glutaraldehyde cross-linking and to the New Orleans Protein Folding Intergroup for critical discussion."

Heart FABP (HFABP) and adipocyte FABP (AFABP) are homologous proteins sharing >60% amino acid sequence identity (8Banaszak L. Winter N. Xu Z. Bernlohr D.A. Cowan S. Jones T.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 89-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both proteins bind one FA in the binding pocket (1Xu Z. Bernlohr D.A. Banaszak L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7874-7884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Zanotti G. Scapin G. Spadon P. Veerkamp J.H. Sacchettini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18541-18550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although x-ray crystallographic studies show that the FA adopts an entirely different conformation in their respective binding sites (9Woolf T.B.

Cell Biochem. 1993; 123: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). AFABP has generally lower binding affinities for FA than HFABP (11Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23918-23930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it appears that HFABP shows greater affinity for saturated versus unsaturated fatty acids, whereas AFABP does not show such a preference (9Woolf T.B. Tychko M. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 694-707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A- and HFABP also exhibit unique patterns of tissue distribution. AFABP is found in adipose tissue and monocytes/macrophages (12Zezulak K.M. Green H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 419-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 13Pelton P.D. Zhou L. Demarest K.T. Burris T.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), whereas HFABP has a wider distribution, being found in muscle and numerous other tissues (14Heuckeroth R.O. Birkenmeier E.H.

Furthermore, HFABP has been suggested to be associated with FA β-oxidation in heart and skeletal muscle (16Veerkamp J.H. van Moerkerk H.T. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1993; 123: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 17Fournier N.C. Zuker M. Williams R.E. Smith I.C.

Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 783-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1807) Google Scholar). Thus, these two proteins are hypothesized to have distinct physiological functions. A- and HFABP were found in cardiac muscle cell in Antarctic Teleost fish and in different cell types of bovine mammary gland, suggesting further that the two proteins have specialized functions in the metabolism of fatty acids (20Vayda M.E. Londraville R.L. Cashon R.E. Costello L. Sidell B.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 21Specht B. Bartetzko N. Hohoff C. Kuhl H. Franke R. Borchers T.

The potential role of FABPs in FA trafficking has been investigatedin vitro using fluorescent anthroyloxy-labeled fatty acid (AOFA) and a resonance energy transfer assay (22Kim H.K. Storch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 77-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Wootan M.G. Storch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10517-10523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hsu K.T.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8622-8627Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). AOFA transfer from both A- and HFABP to membranes appears to occur through a collisional process. The rates of FA transfer were increased by the incorporation of anionic phospholipids, decreased by chemical neutralization of lysines of FABP, and decreased by site-directed mutagenesis of specific lysines (23Wootan M.G. Storch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10517-10523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Herr F.M. Matarese V. Bernlohr D.A. Storch J.

Thus, electrostatic interactions between surface lysine residues and negatively charged membrane lipids were suggested to be involved in the collisional FA transfer process (26Herr F.M. Matarese V. Bernlohr D.A. Storch J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11840-11845Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 27Herr F.M. Aronson J. Storch J.

Recently, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, equilibrium binding studies, and competitive binding assays have also demonstrated direct interactions of AFABP with anionic phospholipid membranes (29Gericke A. Smith E.R. Moore D.J. Mendelsohn R. Storch J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8311-8317Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 30Smith E.R. Storch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35325-35330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Despite their sharing the same transfer mechanism, however, AFABP and HFABP have several distinct transfer properties. For example, AFABP consistently has approximately 10-fold faster AOFA transfer rates (23Wootan M.G. Storch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10517-10523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and AFABP also displays greater sensitivity to the negative charge of acceptor membranes, relative to HFABP. These two proteins also have a different response to ionic strength: An increase in ionic strength increases the rate of AOFA transfer from HFABP to vesicles, whereas no change in rate from AFABP is observed (31Storch J. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1993; 123: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Lysine (K) to isoleucine (I) mutagenesis of specific lysines in the portal region have shown distinct effects for each protein on FA transfer (27Herr F.M. Aronson J. Storch J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1296-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 28Liou H.-L. Storch J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6475-6485Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A unique lysine (Lys-32) found on the αII-helix of AFABP but not present in HFABP was shown to be an important determinant of the rate of FA transfer. Furthermore, a K59I mutation on the β C-D turn of each protein resulted in opposite effects: A decrease in rates from AFABP to neutral phospholipid vesicles whereas a 2-fold increase was found in AOFA transfer from HFABP to membranes. In addition, neutralization of lysines 10, 97, and 113, located in the non-portal β-A, G, and I strands of AFABP, respectively, suggested that these residues may play a role in FA transfer; however, the corresponding lysine mutations on HFABP were found to have virtually no effect. Based on these unique properties, we hypothesized that the divergence in primary amino acid sequence and/or certain structural elements may underlie the functional differences between these two closely related proteins. The aim of this study was to examine and compare the structural components or regions that are responsible for the differences in FA transfer properties between A- and HFABP. We generated two pairs of chimeric proteins. In one pair, the complete α-helical region, including the β-A strand, αI-helix, and αII-helix (residues 1–36) of the proteins were switched. In the other pair, the β-A strand plus the first α-helix (amino acids 1–25) were switched between A- and HFABP. Due to the somewhat different sensitivity to membrane-negative charge of the αI-helix lysines of A- and HFABP (27Herr F.M. Aronson J. Storch J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1296-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar,28Liou H.-L. Storch J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6475-6485Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and the different amino acid sequence of the αI-helices in the A- and HFABP, we also constructed point mutant E23S-AFABP. This particular mutation makes the hydrophilic side of the amphipathic αI-helix of AFABP resemble that of HFABP. The results demonstrate that the entire helix-turn-helix motif is important in determining the absolute rate of FA transfer from protein to membranes. The αII-helix, in particular, may be the major structural element involved in the rate of FABP interactions with acceptor membranes. Furthermore, the αI-helices of the two proteins were shown to have different sensitivities to membrane-negative charge, which may help these proteins function uniquely in FA transfer.

Primers carrying mutations were from Midland Certified Reagents (Midland, TX). Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside was from Fisher (Fairlawn, NJ). The fluorescent fatty acid 2-(9-anthroyloxy) palmitate (2-AP) and ADIFAB were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Egg PC (EPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-(12-[(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]dodecanoyl]-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine, brain phosphatidylserine (PS), and bovine heart cardiolipin (CL) were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). All other reagents were of the highest reagent grade available. Vectors pET-AFABP and pET-HFABP for the respective wild type A- and HFABP expressions were provided by Dr. Alan Kleinfeld (Medical Biology Institute, La Jolla, CA). Site-directed and chimeric mutant cDNAs were constructed. The numbering of amino acid residues was with the first methionine as Met-1. Oligonucleotide primers bearing mismatches, indicated by underlining, are listed in TableI. The resultant mutants with various structural elements are listed in TableII. The incorporation of the mutation was confirmed by sequence analysis (32Sanger F. Coulson A.R. Barrell B.G. Smith A.J.H. Roe B.A. Mol. Biol. 1980; 143: 161-178Crossref Scopus (2190) Google Scholar). The AFABP point mutant having a glutamic acid 23 to serine mutation (E23S-AFABP) was generated using specific and outermost primers by overlapping PCR (33Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 16: 7351-7367Crossref Scopus (2080) Google Scholar). A uniqueBalI site exists in the cDNA of AFABP at residue 37 next to the end of αII-helix (residue 36). A BalI site introduced to HFABP by overlapping PCR resulted in a threonine to alanine mutation (T37A-HFABP) to match the alanine 37 on AFABP. The mutated T37A-cDNA was subcloned into the pET-11d vector and digested by XbaI and BamHI. The digested fragment was further ligated into the pBS vector for chimeric DNA construction. Two vectors, pBS-AFABP and pBS-T37A-HFABP, were digested byBalI and BamHI to obtain four resultant fragments. By ligating different pieces, the α-helical region chimeric mutants αA/βH-FABP and αH/βA-FABP were constructed to contain residues 1–37 of AFABP plus 38–133 of HFABP, and 1–36 of HFABP plus 37–132 of AFABP, respectively. To examine the effect of each helix on the transfer of FA to acceptor membranes, we generated a second pair of chimeric constructs. In this pair, the first 25 amino acids were exchanged between A- and HFABP. The helix-turn-helix region consists of helix I, from residues 17 to 24, followed by a short tripeptide, followed by the second helix (αII) from amino acid residues 28 to 36. Thus, the first 25 amino acids from the N-terminal end essentially include the β-A strand and αI-helix. Chimeric αI-A/βH-FABP containing residues 1–25 of AFABP and 26–133 of HFABP was generated via overlapping PCR using a natural overlap region from amino acid residues 25 to 31 of A- and HFABP.Table IOligonucleotide primers for mutagenesisMutationPrimersUnderlinedSequence 5′ → 3′Outermost (AFABP)HL06XbaIGGCGGCCGCTCTAGAAATAATTHL09BamHICCGGGGGATCCTAATTTCCATCOutermost (HFABP)HL19BamHITGGCAGAGGATCCGTCAGTGHL22NcoITCATTGCACCATGGCGGACGαI-A/βH-FABPHL17AntisenseCTGGTGGCAAAGCCCACTCCHL18SenseGGAGTGGGCTTTGCCACCAGE23S-AFABPHL20AntisenseCCACTCCCACTGATTTCATGTAAHL21SenseTTACATGAAATCAGTGGGAGTGGT37A-HFABPHL23AntisenseGTCGGCTTGGCCATGCTAGCHL24SenseGCTAGCATGGCCAAGCCGACXhoI siteFH17AntisenseGGATCCCCCGGGCTCGAGGAATTCGATADraIII siteFH16SenseTGAAAGCACTCGGTGTGGGCTTTOligonucleotide primers carrying mutations or specific restriction sites were synthesized and further purified by anion-exchange high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) by Midland Certified Reagents (Midland, TX).

Another αI-helix chimeric, αI-H/βA-FABP, was constructed earlier by a different approach. Without changing the amino acid sequence, aDraIII restriction site was introduced into the AFABP cDNA at residue 25. An XhoI site was also introduced after the cDNA stop codon for subsequent subcloning. TheDraIII and XhoI-digested fragment consisting of residues 26–132 of AFABP was ligated to the predigested pBS-HFABP fragment containing residues 1–25 of HFABP. Having confirmed the mutations by sequence analysis, chimeric αI-H/βA-FABP cDNA was subcloned into the pET-11d expression vector using XbaI andBamHI sites. The template structures upon which the models of the chimeric proteins were built were human FABP (PDB file 1HMS) (34Yang A.C.M. Scapin G. Kromminga A. Patel S.B. Veerkamp J.H. Sacchettini J.C. Structure. 1994; 2: 523-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and mouse adipocyte FABP (1LID) (1Xu Z. Bernlohr D.A. Banaszak L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7874-7884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both files were in the holoprotein form, each containing one molecule of oleic acid in the binding pocket. The oleate was removed to obtain the apoprotein form prior to modeling. Because the biochemical work was done with rat heart FABP, those amino acids in the human protein that differ from the rat sequence were replaced by the appropriate rat residues, and the conformational energy of the resulting molecule was minimized to obtain a new protein model in PDB format. This was done because there is no three-dimensional structure for rat protein, and the human FABP was the closest high resolution starting point. All molecular modeling was done with the package Insight II (Molecular Simulations, Inc.) on Silicon Graphics workstations. Initial construction of the four chimeric proteins entailed appending the appropriate parts of the muscle and adipocyte structures to one another. This, of course, produces some close steric contacts and other conformational properties not characteristic of native globular proteins such as packing defects in the molecular interiors. These were removed by minimization of the conformational energy using the default parameters of Insight II. Titratable groups carried the charges, which the amino acids containing them would have at pH 7 as a reasonable approximation to the electrostatic environment of the native proteins. Solvent was not included. Several thousand iterations were required to achieve convergence for each protein. To enable the comparisons of the models with the native forms, the adipocyte protein, file 1LID, and the original human muscle file, 1HMS, were also subjected to full energy minimization after the oleate molecules had been removed. The minimized structures of the adipocyte and muscle proteins and those of the four chimeras were written out in PDB format for further processing. To evaluate whether the models show structural characteristics of normal globular proteins, two properties were calculated, the solvent-accessible surface areas and the packing volumes (35Richards F.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1977; 6: 151-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2307) Google Scholar). The solvent-accessible surface areas were calculated by the method of Lee and Richards (36Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (5288) Google Scholar) using the program ACCESS (35Richards F.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1977; 6: 151-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2307) Google Scholar), and each atom was classified as aliphatic, aromatic, polar-uncharged, or polar-charged. The detailed classification of the atom has been described by Kajanderet al. (37Kajander T. Kahn P.C. Passila S.H. Cohen D.C. Lehtiö L. Adolfsen W. Warwicker J. Schell U. Goldman A. Structure. 2000; 8: 1203-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The volumes occupied by the protein atoms were computed by the Voronoi algorithm as implemented by Richards (35Richards F.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys.

Wild type A- and HFABP and mutant proteins were purified as previously detailed (27Herr F.M. Aronson J. Storch J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1296-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 30Smith E.R. Storch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35325-35330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and protein concentrations were estimated as described (11Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23918-23930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Herr F.M. Aronson J. Storch J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1296-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Several methods were used to examine the integrity of mutant FABP structure and binding properties, to ensure that alterations introduced did not change the overall protein conformation and/or its fatty acid binding properties. Circular dichroism spectra were measured to verify that there were no overall folding modifications in mutant FABP structures as previously described (28Liou H.-L. Storch J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6475-6485Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To check the hydrophobic properties of the internal ligand binding pocket, fluorescence quantum yields (Qf) of the fluorescent fatty acid analog 2-AP bound to wild type or mutant FABP were determined with an SLM 8000C fluorescence spectrophotometer as previously described (28Liou H.-L. Storch J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6475-6485Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Binding of oleate to wild type A- and HFABP and mutant FABPs was analyzed using the fluorescent probe ADIFAB to obtain the FA binding affinity and stoichiometry (11Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23918-23930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Small unilamellar vesicles (SUV) were prepared by sonication and ultra-centrifugation, according to the method of Huang and Thompson (39Huang C. Thompson T.E. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 32: 485-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The standard vesicles were prepared to contain 90 mol % of EPC and 10 mol % of NBDPC. Two anionic vesicles were also used; 25 mol % of phosphatidylserine (PS) or cardiolipin (CL) was incorporated into the neutral SUVs in place of an equimolar amount of EPC. The phospholipid concentrations were determined as previously described (30Smith E.R. Storch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35325-35330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The rate of 2-AP transfer from wild type and mutant FABPs to acceptor vesicles was determined using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay as detailed previously (28Liou H.-L. Storch J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6475-6485Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). AOFA transfer was monitored at 25 °C. The conditions were developed prior to each experiment such that no photobleaching of FA was observed. Final concentrations in a typical transfer assay were 10 μm FABP, 1 μm 2-AP, and 100–500 μm acceptor phospholipid vesicles. AOFA transfer from protein to membranes was monitored and analyzed as a time-dependent decrease in fluorescence, as described (28Liou H.-L. Storch J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6475-6485Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The rates of AOFA transfer are represented as means ± S.E. from at least three or more separate sets of experiments. Two-tailed paired t tests were used to analyze the differences among rates of FA transfer from mutant proteins versus their respective wild type FABPs, to various concentrations and compositions of acceptor phospholipid membranes. Results were considered significant at p < 0.05. The solvent-accessible surface areas and volumes are shown in Fig.1. It is seen that the differenc"

In the presence of phosphate as a permeant anion, Ca2+ was released from respiring mitochondria only after massive cation loading at the onset of anaerobiosis. Ca2+ release was not affected by cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition. Aeration of the mitochondrial suspension inhibited the efflux of Ca2+ and induced its re-uptake. With acetate as the permeant anion, a spontaneous net Ca2+ efflux set in after uptake of ∼150 nmol of Ca2+/mg of protein. The rate of this efflux was proportional to the Ca2+ load and insensitive to aeration, protonophorous uncouplers, and Na+ions. Ca2+ efflux was inhibited by La3+, Mn2+, Mg2+, tetraphenylphosphonium, inorganic phosphate, and nigericin and stimulated by hypotonicity, spermine, and valinomycin in the presence of 4 mm KCl. Atractyloside and t-butyl hydroperoxide were without effect. Ca2+efflux was associated with contraction, but not with mitochondrial swelling. We conclude that the permeability transition pore is not involved in Ca2+ efflux in preloaded E. magnusii mitochondria. The efflux occurs via an Na+-independent pathway, in many ways similar to the one in mammalian mitochondria.

The rate of this efflux was proportional to the Ca2+ load and insensitive to aeration, protonophorous uncouplers, and Na+ions. Ca2+ efflux was inhibited by La3+, Mn2+, Mg2+, tetraphenylphosphonium, inorganic phosphate, and nigericin and stimulated by hypotonicity, spermine, and valinomycin in the presence of 4 mm KCl. Atractyloside and t-butyl hydroperoxide were without effect. Ca2+efflux was associated with contraction, but not with mitochondrial swelling. We conclude that the permeability transition pore is not involved in Ca2+ efflux in preloaded E. magnusii mitochondria. The efflux occurs via an Na+-independent pathway, in many ways similar to the one in mammalian mitochondria. inner mitochondrial membrane transmembrane potential carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone cyclosporin A mitochondrial permeability transition tetraphenylphosphonium Calcium plays an important role as an intracellular messenger in signal transduction (1Clapham D.E.

Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is important in relaying a signal for stimulation of respiration and oxidative phosphorylation (3McCormack J.G. Denton R.M. Biochem. Soc.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 5267-5273Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Mitochondria are receiving increasing attention also due to their central role in the mechanism of cell death (6Bernardi P. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Petronilli V. Di Lisa F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 687-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Animal mitochondria take up Ca2+ by a uniport mechanism and release it by a number of different mechanisms, including Na+ antiport, a sodium-independent pathway, and via opening of a cyclosporin A-sensitive pore (for review, see Ref.7Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). Yeast mitochondria generally lack a Ca2+ uptake pathway of any significant physiological relevance (8Balcavage W.X. Lloyd J.L. Mattoon J.R. Ohnishi T. Scarpa A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 305: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 9Tanida I. Hasegawa A. Iida H. Ohya Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol.

Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38245-38253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, we have found that tightly coupled mitochondria from the yeast Endomyces magnusii are able to take up Ca2+ by a uniport mechanism, although the apparent Km is rather high, 150–180 μm (11Zvyagilskaya R.A.

Biochemistry (Moscow). 1987; 52: 676-682Google Scholar). Ca2+ uptake at low concentrations can, however, as in animal mitochondria, be substantially increased by micromolar concentrations of polyamines (13Votyakova T.V. Bazhenova E.N. Zvjagilskaya R.A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 261: 139-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 14Votyakova T.V. Bazhenova E.N. Zvjagilskaya R.A. J. Bioenerg.

Also ADP, Ca2+ itself, and a high intramitochondrial NADH/NAD+ ratio stimulate mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake (15Deryabina Y.I. Bazhenova E.N. Zvyagilskaya R.A. Biochemistry (Moscow). 1996; 61: 1704-1713Google Scholar, 16Bazhenova E.N. Saris N.-E.L. Zvyagilskaya R.A. Biochim. Biophys.

In the presence of all these physiological modulators, the initial rate of Ca2+ uptake is quite high (up to 2 μmol/min/mg of protein), and the mitochondrial Ca2+-buffering capacity is remarkably high. Ca2+ uptake by E. magnusii mitochondria is thus potentially important in Ca2+ homeostasis and signal transduction (15Deryabina Y.I. Bazhenova E.N. Zvyagilskaya R.A. Biochemistry (Moscow). 1996; 61: 1704-1713Google Scholar, 16Bazhenova E.N. Saris N.-E.L. Zvyagilskaya R.A. Biochim. Biophys.

The Ca2+ efflux pathways are also of interest in this context. In this study, we have characterized the mitochondrial Ca2+ efflux mechanism, which shares many of its characteristics with the sodium-independent Ca2+ efflux mechanism of mitochondria from non-excitable mammalian cells (19Rottenberg H. Marbach M. FEBS Lett. 1990; 274: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The yeast E. magnusii strain VKM Y261 was grown in glycerol-containing semisynthetic medium as described previously (20Zvyagilskaya R.A. Selenshchikova V.A. Uralskaya L.A. Kotelnikova A.V. Biochemistry (Moscow). 1981; 46: 3-10Google Scholar). Cells were harvested at the late exponential growth phase (10–13 g (wet weight)/liter). Mitochondria were isolated by the method developed in our laboratory (17Bazhenova E.N. Deryabina Y.I. Eriksson O. Zvyagilskaya R.A. Saris N.-E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4372-4377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The oxygen consumption in mitochondrial suspensions was monitored polarographically with a Clark-type electrode in medium containing 0.6 m mannitol, 1 mm Tris phosphate (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm pyruvate, 5 mm malate, and mitochondria corresponding to 0.5 mg/ml protein. The mitochondrial preparations were well coupled, showing respiratory control ratios of ∼4 under these conditions. ADP/oxygen ratios were close to the theoretical maximum. Respiratory control and ADP/oxygen ratios were calculated as described by Chance and Williams (21Chance B. Williams G.R. Nature. 1955; 175: 1120-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were fully active for at least 4 h after preparation. Ca2+ uptake was assayed by the murexide method employing dual wavelength photometry at 507–540 nm with a Hitachi 557 spectrophotometer. Unless otherwise specified in the figure legends, the incubation medium contained 0.6 m mannitol, 2 mm Tris phosphate or 20 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.4), 20 mm Tris pyruvate, 5 mm malate, 50 μm murexide, and mitochondria corresponding to 0.5 mg/ml protein. The inner mitochondrial membrane transmembrane potential (ΔΨ)1 was measured at the wavelength pair 523/555 nm with 7 μm safranin (22Åkerman K.E.O. Wikström M.K.F. FEBS Lett. 1976; 68: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial swelling was monitored by recording changes in absorbance at 540 nm. Protein was assayed by the method of Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216357) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Mannitol, sorbitol, EDTA, EGTA, bovine serum albumin, ADP, spermine, valinomycin, nigericin, atractyloside, CCCP, Tris, pyruvate, malate, murexide, and CaCl2 were purchased from Sigma. Coomassie G-250, NADH, and safranin were from Serva. A23187 was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Dithiothreitol was from Reanal. Cyclosporin A (CsA) was a kind gift of Novartis. In the presence of Pi, yeast mitochondria were able to take up almost all of the Ca2+ added in successive aliquots (up to 600 nmol of Ca2+/mg of protein) and to retain it until the oxygen was exhausted after 5–10 min of incubation (Fig. 1, trace a). Anaerobiosis induced a rapid collapse of ΔΨ (Fig. 1,trace c), the driving force of Ca2+uptake by the calcium uniporter. The rate of Ca2+ uptake was much faster than that of efflux induced by anaerobiosis (Fig. 1), which is in accordance with the ability of the mitochondria to reduce the [Ca2+] to very low levels at steady state. On the other hand, upon collapse of ΔΨ, efflux could be by reversal of the uptake mechanism, the calcium uniporter. Intensive aeration of the incubation medium fully reestablished ΔΨ, prevented spontaneous Ca2+ release, and elicited re-uptake of the Ca2+ released (Fig. 1, trace a). Aeration before each Ca2+ addition also prevented Ca2+ release (Fig. 1, trace b) and a drop in ΔΨ (trace d), thus increasing the Ca2+-buffering capacity of the yeast mitochondria. The efflux rate was not affected by the addition of CsA (Fig. 1,trace a). Since no Ca2+ efflux was observed in respiring yeast mitochondria in the presence of Pi, acetate was used instead as a permeant anion. The Ca2+ efflux pathways in animal mitochondria are not influenced by acetate and thus can be studied in the presence of this anion, the calcium salt of which is soluble (24Rizzuto R. Bernardi P. Favoron M. Azzone G.F. Biochem. J. 1987; 246: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In yeast mitochondria, Ca2+ efflux ensued after uptake of ∼75 μm Ca2+ (Fig.2, trace a). Ca2+ release was not due to a decline in ΔΨ (Fig. 2,trace b), and it was insensitive to micromolar concentrations of CsA (data not shown). The efflux was thus spontaneous and not due to anaerobiosis or induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). The rate of Ca2+ efflux was proportional to the Ca2+ load (Fig.3 A). It was inhibited half-maximally by Pi at 0.3 mm (Fig.3 B).Figure 3Effect of Ca2+ load (A) and of Pi (B) on the rate of Ca2+ efflux in yeast mitochondria. The medium was the same as that described in the legend to Fig. 2, but without murexide. In A and B, 100 and 500 μm Ca2+ were added, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In acetate medium, Ca2+ uptake would cause mitochondrial swelling due to accumulation of calcium acetate in the matrix, whereas efflux would result in contraction. Fig.4 shows the effect of various agents on the contraction due to spontaneous Ca2+ efflux in mitochondria respiring on pyruvate + malate. In mitochondria to which 100 μm Ca2+ had been added, the addition ofN-ethylmaleimide only slightly slowed contraction, whereast-butyl hydroperoxide, oxalacetate, atractyloside, and the uncoupling agent CCCP in the presence of EGTA were without any effect (Fig. 4). In animal mitochondria, efflux of Ca2+ can be studied by inhibiting the uniporter with ruthenium red (25Moore C.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 42: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 26Igbavboa U. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1405-1412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, theE. magnusii mitochondrial calcium uniporter is not inhibited by ruthenium red (12Leikin Y.N. Votyakova T.V. Bazhenova E.N. Zvyagilskaya R.A. Kotelnikova A.V. Biochemistry (Moscow). 1987; 52: 676-682Google Scholar) and may even be stimulated by it (16Bazhenova E.N. Saris N.-E.L. Zvyagilskaya R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1371: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the acetate medium, there was a spontaneous net efflux of accumulated Ca2+ (Fig. 2), but this did not exclude a simultaneous uptake. We therefore examined whether La3+, a competitive inhibitor of mitochondrial Ca2+ transport (27Reed K.C. Bygrave F.L. Biochem. J. 1974; 140: 143-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), could be used as an inhibitor of the uniporter. However, although Ca2+ uptake was sensitive to low concentrations of La3+ (Fig. 5 A,trace b), efflux was also slightly inhibited, more so at higher concentrations (trace a). Half-maximal inhibition of Ca2+ uptake was attained at ∼25 μm La3+. The effects of La3+ were thus different for uptake and efflux of Ca2+. The rate of sodium-independent Ca2+ efflux in animal mitochondria can be modulated by a number of cations (7Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar, 28Gunter T.E. Gunter K.K. Sheu S.-S. Gavin C.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C313-C339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), including Mg2+(29Rottenberg H. Marbach M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1016: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), Mn2+ (30Allshire A. Bernardi P. Saris N.-E.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 807: 202-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 31Gavin C.E. Gunter K.K. Gunter T.E. Neurotoxicology (Little Rock). 1999; 20: 445-453PubMed Google Scholar), Ba2+ (32Lukács G.L. Fonyó A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 809: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), Sr2+ (33Saris N.-E.L. Bernardi P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 725: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), polyamines (19Rottenberg H. Marbach M. FEBS Lett. 1990; 274: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 30Allshire A. Bernardi P. Saris N.-E.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 807: 202-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP+) (28Gunter T.E. Gunter K.K. Sheu S.-S. Gavin C.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C313-C339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as by ionophores (19Rottenberg H. Marbach M. FEBS Lett. 1990; 274: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and hypo-osmolarity (34Novgorodov S.A. Yaguzhinsky L.A. FEBS Lett. 1985; 183: 47-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of several of these agents on Ca2+ efflux in E. magnusii mitochondria. Ca2+ efflux was inhibited by Mn2+ (Fig.5 B, trace a) and by Mg2+(Fig. 5 C, trace a). These cations also affected the rate of Ca2+ uptake and efflux with a different concentration dependence (Fig. 5, B and C). Thus, 200 μm Mn2+ inhibited Ca2+ efflux by 80% (Fig. 5 B, trace a), whereas Ca2+ uptake was inhibited by only 50% (trace b). Mg2+ at 1.5 mm almost totally blocked Ca2+ efflux (Fig.5 C, trace a) and inhibited Ca2+ uptake by only 50% (trace b). In the case of Mg2+ (Fig. 5 C), the concentration dependence of inhibition of Ca2+ uptake and efflux was even more strikingly different. TPP+ is a potent and apparently specific inhibitor of the sodium-independent Ca2+ efflux pathway in animal mitochondria (28Gunter T.E. Gunter K.K. Sheu S.-S. Gavin C.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C313-C339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also found that in yeast mitochondria, TPP+ strongly inhibited Ca2+efflux (Fig. 5 D), with a maximal inhibitory effect at 10 μm and a half-maximal effect at 1.8 μm(calculated in Dixon plots), which is close to theKi value obtained for liver mitochondria (28Gunter T.E. Gunter K.K. Sheu S.-S. Gavin C.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C313-C339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Uptake of Ca2+ was inhibited only slightly (10%) by 10 μm TPP+ (data not shown). Ca2+efflux in yeast mitochondria was almost totally inhibited by 1.2 mm Pi (Fig. 3 B), a concentration that was found to be optimal in sustaining Ca2+ uptake (11Zvyagilskaya R.A. Leikin Y.N. Kozhokaru N.L. Kotelnikova A.V. Dokl. Akad. NAUK SSSR. 1983; 269: 1233-1240Google Scholar). Spermine increased the rate of Ca2+ efflux when added both before (Fig. 6, trace c) and after (trace a) Ca2+, with no effect upon ΔΨ (traces a and b). The spermine-induced Ca2+ release was nonlinear and similar to that seen after the addition of the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (Fig. 2). The addition of A23187 after spermine induced further Ca2+release (Fig. 6, trace a). The rate of Ca2+ efflux in yeast mitochondria was not affected by the redox state of pyridine nucleotides and was only slightly inhibited by micromolar concentrations of ADP (data not shown). Preincubation with 4 mm NADH to greatly reduce intramitochondrial pyridine nucleotides had no effect (data not shown), whereas these substances have been shown to stimulate Ca2+uptake (17Bazhenova E.N. Deryabina Y.I. Eriksson O. Zvyagilskaya R.A. Saris N.-E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4372-4377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Swelling of mammalian mitochondria in hypotonic medium was found to stimulate the sodium-independent Ca2+ efflux pathway, presumably because of stretching of the inner mitochondrial membrane (24Rizzuto R. Bernardi P. Favoron M. Azzone G.F. Biochem. J. 1987; 246: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 34Novgorodov S.A. Yaguzhinsky L.A. FEBS Lett. 1985; 183: 47-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 35Bernardi P. Azzone G.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 134: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Likewise, in yeast mitochondria, a significantly (2.5-fold) enhanced Ca2+ efflux was observed when mitochondria were incubated in hypotonic medium (Fig.7 A, trace b). To elucidate the mechanism of the efflux pathway, we examined the effects of CCCP (a protonophorous uncoupler), nigericin (an ionophore acting via K+/H+ antiport), and valinomycin (a K+ ionophore). Ca2+ efflux was only partially inhibited (30%) by 20–200 nm CCCP (data not shown), whereas little effect (if any) was seen on the associated contraction of mitochondria (Fig. 4). Ca2+ efflux was completely inhibited by 100 nm nigericin (the medium was supplemented with 0.5 mm KCl) (Fig. 7 B, trace a). Nigericin, which equilibrates K+ and H+gradients across the inner mitochondrial membrane and is thereby able to partially transform ΔpH into ΔΨ, slightly increased ΔΨ at most. The addition of 100 nm valinomycin (the medium was supplemented with 4 mm KCl) caused dissipation of ΔΨ and increased the rate of Ca2+ efflux (Fig. 7 B,trace b). In the presence of Pi, E. magnusii mitochondria are capable of massive uptake of Ca2+ (see Fig. 1). In animal mitochondria, Pi has been reported to induce the release of accumulated Pi (36Saris N.-E.L. Soc. Sci. Fenn.; Comment. Phys.-Math. 1963; 28: 1-77Google Scholar), which is now known to be due to induction of MPT (7Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). Massive accumulation was observed in animal mitochondria in the presence of both Piand ATP due to precipitation of calcium phosphates (for review, see Ref. 37Lehninger A.L. Carafoli E. Rossi C.S. Adv. Enzymol. 1967; 29: 259-320PubMed Google Scholar) and inhibition of MPT (7Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). In the absence of adenine nucleotides, Ca2+ uptake by rat liver mitochondria is also stimulated by Pi, and the sodium-independent efflux is inhibited, which was interpreted as being due to lowering of matrix [Ca2+] by its binding to Pi (19Rottenberg H. Marbach M. FEBS Lett. 1990; 274: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In Pi-depleted liver mitochondria, the sodium-independent Ca2+ efflux rate is stimulated 15-fold over that in the presence of Pi and is potently inhibited by the addition of Pi (38Zoccarato F. Nicholls D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 127: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Stimulation of Ca2+ uptake by Pi and inhibition of efflux have also been described in microsomes and were also interpreted as being due to binding of Ca2+ by Pi (39Fulceri R. Bellomo G. Gamberucci A. Romani A. Benedetti A. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The same mechanism may account for the effect of Pi on Ca2+ efflux in E. magnusii mitochondria. The efflux of accumulated Ca2+ in acetate medium could occur by a reversal of the calcium uniporter upon lowering of ΔΨ, by specific efflux mechanisms such as the Ca2+/2Na+ antiporter (40Crompton M. Künzi M. Carafoli E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 79: 549-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and the Ca2+/n H+ antiporter (7Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar, 19Rottenberg H. Marbach M. FEBS Lett. 1990; 274: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 28Gunter T.E. Gunter K.K. Sheu S.-S. Gavin C.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C313-C339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in animal mitochondria, or by reversible opening of the MPT pore. However, the efflux rate was not influenced by uncoupling amounts of CCCP (Fig.4) or Na+ (data not shown), which excludes the uniporter and the Ca2+/2Na+ antiporter mechanisms. This is borne out by data showing that the uptake and efflux pathways differ in their sensitivities to La3+ (Fig. 5 A) and modulators such as Mn2+ (Fig. 5 B), Mg2+ (Fig. 5 C), TPP+ (Fig.5 D), and spermine (Fig. 6). Efflux was only slightly inhibited by ADP (data not shown), whereas uptake was potently stimulated (with a half-maximal effect at 3–5 μm and at a maximal effect at 25 μm) (15Deryabina Y.I. Bazhenova E.N. Zvyagilskaya R.A. Biochemistry (Moscow). 1996; 61: 1704-1713Google Scholar, 17Bazhenova E.N. Deryabina Y.I. Eriksson O. Zvyagilskaya R.A. Saris N.-E.L. J. Biol.

In addition, the efflux rate was not influenced by preincubation of the mitochondrial suspension with 4 mm NADH, which ensures a high redox state of the intramitochondrial pyridine nucleotides in yeast mitochondria (41Zvyagilskaya R.A. Zelenshchikova V.A. Burbaev D.S. Dokl. Akad. NAUK SSSR. 1982; 263: 491-493Google Scholar), although Ca2+ uptake is stimulated under these conditions (17Bazhenova E.N. Deryabina Y.I. Eriksson O. Zvyagilskaya R.A. Saris N.-E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4372-4377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In animal mitochondria, ADP inhibits and atractyloside stimulates Ca2+ release mediated by the MPT pore, presumably by affecting the conformation of the adenine nucleotide carrier (7Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). InE. magnusii mitochondria, Ca2+ efflux was only slightly affected by ADP (data not shown). The addition of atractyloside, pro-oxidants, N-ethylmaleimide, or small amounts of CCCP or oxidation of pyridine nucleotides by oxalacetate had little effect (if any) on the rate of mitochondrial contraction associated with Ca2+ efflux (Fig. 4). All these findings indicate that there is no Ca2+-stimulated opening of a MPT pore in these mitochondria. This conclusion is strongly supported by the absence of inhibition by CsA and by the massive accumulation of Ca2+ in the presence of Pi(Fig. 1) that would induce MPT in animal mitochondria (7Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). No MPT of this type has been found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondria (42Jung D.W. Bradshaw P.C. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21104-21112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Mg2+ ions are believed to stabilize the inner mitochondrial membrane by modulating ion transport and inhibiting the Ca2+-activated phospholipase A2 and MPT (43Saris N.-E.L. Mervaala E. Karppanen H.

The mechanism of the inhibitory action of Mn2+ on Ca2+ efflux has not been conclusively established. It seems likely that in E. magnusii mitochondria, Mg2+ and Mn2+ exert their action from the cytosolic side since these mitochondria have only a low-capacity transport system for Mg2+ (44Zvyagilskaya R.A. Votyakova T.V. Bazhenova E.N. Mikrobiologia. 1987; 56: 543-548PubMed Google Scholar), and the calcium uniporter supports slow transport of Sr2+, Mn2+, or Ba2+ only at high millimolar concentrations (data not shown). Furthermore, these cations exert their inhibitory action without any lag. Spermine is well known as an important modulator of the Ca2+ transport system in animal mitochondria, stimulating electrogenic Ca2+ uptake (45Saris N.-E.L. Wikström M.K.F. Seppälä A.J.

We have also reported a stimulatory effect of low physiological concentrations of spermine on Ca2+ uptake by E. magnusii mitochondria (13Votyakova T.V. Bazhenova E.N. Zvjagilskaya R.A.

The mechanism of the stimulation of the efflux rate by spermine may be an allosteric change in the conformation of the transporter or/and an effect of binding of spermine to negatively charged membrane groups, thus favoring the binding and dissociation of Ca2+ from the membrane. It is also possible that Ca2+ itself stimulates the transporter by the same allosteric effect on the transporter, which would explain the stimulation of efflux after uptake over a certain threshold. Nigericin inhibited Ca2+ efflux in the presence of 0.5 mm K+ under conditions that did not change ΔΨ, whereas valinomycin stimulated efflux in the presence of 4 mm K+ (Fig. 7 B). Under these conditions, valinomycin caused a decrease in ΔΨ and swelling (Fig.4). Since there should be no appreciable pH gradient in the presence of acetate, and a drop in ΔΨ induced by CCCP did not change the efflux rate (Fig. 4), it seems likely that the inhibition is due to reduction of the mitochondrial volume. The valinomycin-induced stimulation of efflux could then be due to swelling (Fig. 4) induced by accumulation of potassium acetate in the matrix. Taken together, these data indicate that Ca2+ efflux inE. magnusii mitochondria is primarily mediated by a sodium-independent pathway. This could be a passive Ca2+/n H+ antiporter, with ΔpH as a driving force, as in liver mitochondria. Whether indeed these transporters are related at the molecular level requires further studies. The data presented demonstrate, to our knowledge for the first time, that mitochondria from a yeast species are endowed with independent systems for influx and efflux of Ca2+. Fig.8 summarizes the modulation of Ca2+ uptake and efflux pathways in E. magnusii mitochondria and their possible physiological implications. An increase in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration would activate Ca2+ uptake by respiring mitochondria via the Ca2+ uniporter, with ΔΨ generated across the inner mitochondrial membrane as the driving force (7Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). This would establish a higher steady-state concentration of free Ca2+ required for the activation of Ca2+-sensitive matrix enzymes, particularly of Ca2+-sensitive, NAD+-dependent dehydrogenases supplying reducing equivalents to the respiratory chain (3McCormack J.G. Denton R.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In our preliminary experiments, we found that the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex inE. magnusii mitochondria was activated by submicromolar [Ca2+]. The Ca2+ that accumulated in the matrix would be buffered by binding to Pi and other substances. When Ca2+ uptake exceeds the matrix Ca2+-binding capacity, as in the absence of added Pi, an excessive rise in matrix [Ca2+] would trigger Ca2+ efflux primarily by a sodium-independent mechanism, i.e. electroneutral Ca2+/2H+ antiport, or by activation of a Ca2+-specific channel (7Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). The result would be an increase in medium [Ca2+], but the ensuing increased rate of Ca2+ uptake in the Ca2+ cycling would not be enough to lower ΔΨ (Fig. 2). In conclusion, these data demonstrate that E. magnusii mitochondria have a specific Ca2+ efflux pathway that is activated by elevated matrix free [Ca2+]. In many respects, it is similar to the sodium-independent Ca2+efflux pathway in mitochondria from non-excitable mammalian cells. Thus, in both types of mitochondria, mitochondrial Ca2+efflux is modulated by the same substances. The efflux in E. magnusii was spontaneous and not due a decline in ΔΨ or induction of MPT.

Fractionated T. brucei cell extracts with telomerase activity were used as a source of potential regulatory factors or telomerase-associated components that might interact withT. brucei telomeres. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and UV cross-linking were used to detect possible single-stranded telomeric protein·DNA complexes and to estimate the approximate size of the protein constituents. Three single-stranded telomeric protein·DNA complexes were observed. Complex C3 was highly specific for the G-strand telomeric repeat sequence and shares biochemical characteristics with G-rich, single-stranded telomeric binding proteins and with components of the telomerase holoenzyme described in yeast, ciliates, and humans. Susceptibility to RNase A or chemical nuclease (hydroxyl radical) pre-treatment showed that complex C3 was tightly associated with an RNA component. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry was used to estimate the molecular mass of the peptides obtained by in-gel Lys-C digestion of low abundance C3-associated proteins. The molecular masses of the peptides showed no homologies with other proteins from trypanosomes or with any protein in the data bases screened."
