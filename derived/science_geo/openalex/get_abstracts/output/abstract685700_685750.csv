https://openalex.org/W3216618416,"COVID-19-induced ""acute respiratory distress syndrome"" (ARDS) is associated with prolonged respiratory failure and high mortality, but the mechanistic basis of lung injury remains incompletely understood. Here, we analyze pulmonary immune responses and lung pathology in two cohorts of patients with COVID-19 ARDS using functional single-cell genomics, immunohistology, and electron microscopy. We describe an accumulation of CD163-expressing monocyte-derived macrophages that acquired a profibrotic transcriptional phenotype during COVID-19 ARDS. Gene set enrichment and computational data integration revealed a significant similarity between COVID-19-associated macrophages and profibrotic macrophage populations identified in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. COVID-19 ARDS was associated with clinical, radiographic, histopathological, and ultrastructural hallmarks of pulmonary fibrosis. Exposure of human monocytes to SARS-CoV-2, but not influenza A virus or viral RNA analogs, was sufficient to induce a similar profibrotic phenotype in vitro. In conclusion, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 triggers profibrotic macrophage responses and pronounced fibroproliferative ARDS."

https://openalex.org/W4200028773,"The cardiac isoform of myosin-binding protein C (cMyBP-C) is a key regulatory protein found in cardiac myofilaments that can control the activation state of both the actin-containing thin and myosin-containing thick filaments. However, in contrast to thin filament-based mechanisms of regulation, the mechanism of myosin-based regulation by cMyBP-C has yet to be defined in detail. To clarify its function in this process, we used microscale thermophoresis to build an extensive interaction map between cMyBP-C and isolated fragments of β-cardiac myosin. We show here that the regulatory N-terminal domains (C0C2) of cMyBP-C interact with both the myosin head (myosin S1) and tail domains (myosin S2) with micromolar affinity via phosphorylation-independent and phosphorylation-dependent interactions of domain C1 and the cardiac-specific m-motif, respectively. Moreover, we show that the interaction sites with the highest affinity between cMyBP-C and myosin S1 are localized to its central domains, which bind myosin with submicromolar affinity. We identified two separate interaction regions in the central C2C4 and C5C7 segments that compete for the same binding site on myosin S1, suggesting that cMyBP-C can crosslink the two myosin heads of a single myosin molecule and thereby stabilize it in the folded OFF state. Phosphorylation of the cardiac-specific m-motif by protein kinase A had no effect on the binding of either the N-terminal or the central segments to the myosin head domain, suggesting this might therefore represent a constitutively bound state of myosin associated with cMyBP-C. Based on our results, we propose a new model of regulation of cardiac myosin function by cMyBP-C."
https://openalex.org/W4200062817,"Extended synaptotagmins (E-Syts) mediate lipid exchange between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the plasma membrane (PM). Anchored on the ER, E-Syts bind the PM via an array of C2 domains in a Ca2+- and lipid-dependent manner, drawing the two membranes close to facilitate lipid exchange. How these C2 domains bind the PM and regulate the ER-PM distance is not well understood. Here, we applied optical tweezers to dissect PM binding by E-Syt1 and E-Syt2. We detected Ca2+- and lipid-dependent membrane-binding kinetics of both E-Syts and determined the binding energies and rates of individual C2 domains or pairs. We incorporated these parameters in a theoretical model to recapitulate salient features of E-Syt-mediated membrane contacts observed in vivo, including their equilibrium distances and probabilities. Our methods can be applied to study other proteins containing multiple membrane-binding domains linked by disordered polypeptides."
https://openalex.org/W4200387333,"Endometriosis is an estrogen dependent gynecological disease associated with altered microbial phenotypes. The association among endogenous estrogen, estrogen metabolites, and microbial dynamics on disease pathogenesis has not been fully investigated. Here, we identified estrogen metabolites as well as microbial phenotypes in non-diseased patients (n = 9) and those with pathologically confirmed endometriosis (P-EOSIS, n = 20), on day of surgery (DOS) and ~1-3 weeks post-surgical intervention (PSI). Then, we examined the effects of surgical intervention with or without hormonal therapy (OCPs) on estrogen and microbial profiles of both study groups. For estrogen metabolism analysis, liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry was used to quantify urinary estrogens. The microbiome data assessment was performed with Next generation sequencing to V4 region of 16S rRNA. Surgical intervention and hormonal therapy altered gastrointestinal (GI), urogenital (UG) microbiomes, urinary estrogen and estrogen metabolite levels in P-EOSIS. At DOS, 17β-estradiol was enhanced in P-EOSIS treated with OCPs. At PSI, 16-keto-17β-estradiol was increased in P-EOSIS not receiving OCPs while 2-hydroxyestradiol and 2-hydroxyestrone were decreased in P-EOSIS receiving OCPs. GI bacterial α-diversity was greater for controls and P-EOSIS that did not receive OCPs. P-EOSIS not utilizing OCPs exhibited a decrease in UG bacterial α-diversity and differences in dominant taxa, while P-EOSIS utilizing OCPs had an increase in UG bacterial α-diversity. P-EOSIS had a strong positive correlation between the GI/UG bacteria species and the concentrations of urinary estrogen and its metabolites. These results indicate an association between microbial dysbiosis and altered urinary estrogens in P-EOSIS, which may impact disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W4200162727,"This study aimed to validate the recently developed Occupational Depression Inventory (ODI) in South Africa. A total of 327 employees (60% female) participated in the study. Bifactor exploratory structural equation modeling analysis indicated that the ODI can be considered essentially unidimensional. The ODI displayed strong scalability (e.g., scale-level H = 0.657). No monotonicity violation was detected. The reliability of the instrument, as indexed by Cronbach's alpha, McDonald's omega-total, Guttman's λ2, and the Molenaar-Sijtsma statistic, was highly satisfactory. Measurement invariance was observed across age groups, sexes, and ethnicities, as well as between our sample and the ODI's original validation sample. As expected, the ODI showed both a degree of convergent validity and a degree of discriminant validity vis-à-vis a measure of ""cause-neutral"" depressive symptoms. Moreover, the ODI manifested substantial associations, in the anticipated directions, with measures of work engagement, job satisfaction, and life satisfaction. Overall, the ODI exhibited excellent structural and psychometric properties within the South African context. Consistent with previous research, this study suggests that occupational health specialists can confidently rely on the ODI to investigate job-related distress."
https://openalex.org/W4200039923,"This paper analyzes the dynamics of the labor market in Latin America during the COVID-19 pandemic. After a decade of a virtuous circle of growth with the creation of formal jobs, the pandemic has had an considerable impact on the region's labor market, generating an unparalleled increase in the proportion of the inactive population, considerable reductions in informality, and, in contrast, smaller fluctuations in formal jobs. In this context, the formal sector, given its lower flexibility, became a ""social safety net"" that preserved the stability of employment and wages. Based on the findings presented in this paper, it is projected that, starting in 2021, informality will grow to levels higher than those of the pre-COVID-19 era-with 7.56 million additional informal jobs-as a result of the population returning to the labor market to compensate for the declines in incomes. According to the simulations presented, postponing or forgiving income tax payments and social security contributions conditional on the generation of formal jobs could reduce the growth of informality by 50 to 75 percent. Achieving educational improvements has the potential to reduce it by 50 percent."
https://openalex.org/W4200048589,"In 2016, China implemented an environmental protection tax (EPTL2016) to promote the transformation and upgrading of heavily polluting industries through tax leverage. Using panel data of China's listed companies, this study assesses the treatment effects of the EPTL2016 on the transformation and upgrading of heavily polluting firms by incorporating the intermediary role of the financial market. The empirical findings show that the EPTL2016 significantly reduced the innovation investment and productivity of heavily polluting firms but had no significant effect on fixed-asset investment. Additionally, EPTL2016 reduced the supply of bank loans to heavily polluting firms and increased the value of growth options for private enterprises and the efficiency of the supply of long-term loans to heavily polluting firms. Although the environmental policy of EPTL2016 benefits the transformation and upgrading of heavily polluting industries in many aspects, it generally hinders the industrial upgrading because of the reduction of bank loans."
https://openalex.org/W4200090931,"Infant and young child feeding is a key area to improve child survival and promote healthy growth and development. Nepal government has developed and implemented different programs to improve infant and young child feeding practice. However, the practice remains poor and is a major cause of malnutrition in Nepal. This study aims to identify infant and young child feeding practices and its associated factors among mothers of children aged less than two years in western hilly region of Nepal. A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out among 360 mothers of under two years’ children in Syangja district. A semi structural questionnaire was used. Data was entered in EpiData and analyzed using IBM SPSS version 21. Descriptive statistics were used to report the feeding practices and other independent variables. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression model was used to establish the factors associated with infant and young child feeding practices. The prevalence of breastfeeding, timely initiation of breastfeeding, exclusive breastfeeding, timely initiation of complementary feeding, minimum dietary diversity, minimum meal frequency and minimum acceptable diet (MAD) were 95.6%, 69.2%, 47.6%, 53.3%, 61.5%, 67.3% and 49.9% respectively. Normal delivery (AOR 6.1, 95% CI 1.2–31.3) and higher maternal autonomy (AOR 5.2, 95% CI 1.8–14.6) were significantly associated with exclusive breastfeeding. Similarly, crop production and food security (AOR 3.8, 95% CI 1.9–7.7), maternal knowledge on MAD (AOR 2.5, 95% CI 1.0–6.2) and maternal autonomy (AOR 4.2, 95% CI 2.1–8.4) were significantly associated with minimum acceptable diet. Factors such as maternal education, maternal health services utilization, maternal knowledge, and maternal autonomy were associated with infant and young child feeding practices, which warrants further attention to these factors to reduce malnutrition."
https://openalex.org/W4200469426,"Fowlpox (FP) is an economically important viral disease of commercial poultry. The fowlpox virus (FPV) is primarily characterised by immunoblotting, restriction enzyme analysis in combination with PCR, and/or nucleotide sequencing of amplicons. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of FPV directly from clinical specimens prevents the risk of potential genome modifications associated with in vitro culturing of the virus. Only one study has sequenced FPV genomes directly from clinical samples using Nanopore sequencing, however, the study didn't compare the sequences against Illumina sequencing or laboratory propagated sequences. Here, the suitability of WGS for strain identification of FPV directly from cutaneous tissue was evaluated, using a combination of Illumina and Nanopore sequencing technologies. Sequencing results were compared with the sequence obtained from FPV grown in chorioallantoic membranes (CAMs) of chicken embryos. Complete genome sequence of FPV was obtained directly from affected comb tissue using a map to reference approach. FPV sequence from cutaneous tissue was highly similar to that of the virus grown in CAMs with a nucleotide identity of 99.8%. Detailed polymorphism analysis revealed the presence of a highly comparable number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the two sequences when compared to the reference genome, providing essentially the same strain identification information. Comparative genome analysis of the map to reference consensus sequences from the two genomes revealed that this field isolate had the highest nucleotide identity of 99.5% with an FPV strain from the USA (Fowlpox virus isolate, FWPV-MN00.2, MH709124) and 98.8% identity with the Australian FPV vaccine strain (FWPV-S, MW142017). Sequencing results showed that WGS directly from cutaneous tissues is not only rapid and cost-effective but also provides essentially the same strain identification information as in-vitro grown virus, thus circumventing in vitro culturing."
https://openalex.org/W4200489974,"In recent times, injudicious use of paclobutrazol (PBZ) in mango orchards deteriorates the soil quality and fertility by persistence nature and causes a serious ecosystem imbalance. In this study, a new Klebsiella pneumoniae strain M6 (MW228061) was isolated from mango rhizosphere and characterized as a potent plant growth promoter, biocontrol, and PBZ degrading agent. The strain M6 efficiently utilizes PBZ as carbon, energy and nitrogen source and degrades up to 98.28% (50 mgL -1 initial conc.) of PBZ at 15 th day of incubation in MS medium. In the soil system first order degradation kinetics and linear model suggested 4.5 days was the theoretical half-life ( t 1/2 value) of PBZ with strain M6. Box Behnken design (BBD) model of Response surface methodology (RSM) showed pH 7.0, 31°C temperature, and 2.0 ml inoculum size (8 x 10 9 CFU mL -1 ) was optimized condition for maximum PBZ degradation with strain M6. Plant growth promoting attributes such as Zn, K, PO 4 solubilization IAA, HCN and NH 3 production of strain M6 showed positive results and were assessed quantitatively. The relation between plant growth promotion and PBZ degradation was analyzed by heat map, principal component analysis (PCA) and, clustal correlation analysis (CCA). Strain M6 was also showing a significant biocontrol activity against pathogenic fungi such as Fusarium oxysporum (MTCC–284), Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (MTCC– 2190), Pythium aphanidermatum (MTCC– 1024), Tropical race 1 (TR -1), and Tropical race 4 (TR -4). Hence, results of the study suggested that strain M6 can be utilized as an effective bio-agent to restore degraded land affected by persistent use of paclobutrazol."
https://openalex.org/W3178167093,"Ectodysplasin A receptor (EDAR) is a death receptor in the Tumour Necrosis Factor Receptor (TNFR) superfamily with roles in the development of hair follicles, teeth and cutaneous glands. Here we report that human Oestrogen Receptor (ER) negative breast carcinomas which display squamous differentiation express EDAR strongly. Using a mouse model with a high Edar copy number, we show that elevated EDAR signalling results in a high incidence of mammary tumours in breeding female mice. These tumours resemble the EDAR-high human tumours in that they are characterised by a lack of oestrogen receptor expression, contain extensive squamous metaplasia, and display strong β-catenin transcriptional activity. In the mouse model, all of the tumours carry somatic deletions of the third exon of the CTNNB1 gene that encodes β-catenin. Deletion of this exon yields unconstrained β-catenin signalling activity. We also demonstrate that β-catenin activity is required for transformed cell growth, showing that increased EDAR signalling creates an environment in which β-catenin activity can readily promote tumourigenesis. Together, this work identifies a novel death receptor oncogene in breast cancer, whose mechanism of transformation is based on the interaction between the WNT and Ectodysplasin A (EDA) pathways."
https://openalex.org/W4200070878,"As part of a wider reform to scaffold quantitative and research skills throughout the biology major, we introduced course-based undergraduate research experiences (CURE) in sections of a large-enrollment introductory biology laboratory course in a mid-level, public, minority-serving institution. This initiative was undertaken as part of the in the National Science Foundation / Council for Undergraduate Research Transformations Project. Student teams performed two or three experiments, depending on semester. They designed, implemented, analyzed, revised and iterated, wrote scientific paper-style reports, and gave oral presentations. We tested the impact of CURE on student proficiency in experimental design and statistical reasoning, and student research confidence and attitudes over two semesters. We found that students in the CURE sections met the reformed learning objectives for experimental design and statistical reasoning. CURE students also showed higher levels of experimental design proficiency, research self-efficacy, and more expert-like scientific mindsets compared to students in a matched cohort with the traditional design. While students in both groups described labs as a positive experience in end-of-semester reflections, the CURE group showed a high level of engagement with the research process. Students in CURE sections identified components of the research process that were difficult, while also reporting enjoying and valuing research. This study demonstrates improved learning, confidence, and attitudes toward research in a challenging CURE laboratory course where students had significant autonomy combined with appropriate support at a diverse public university."
https://openalex.org/W4200476620,"Steerable instruments allow for precise access to deeply-seated targets while sparing sensitive tissues and avoiding anatomical structures. In this study we present a novel omnidirectional steerable instrument for prostate high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy (BT). The instrument utilizes a needle with internal compliant mechanism, which enables distal tip steering through proximal instrument bending while retaining high axial and flexural rigidity. Finite element analysis evaluated the design and the prototype was validated in experiments involving tissue simulants and ex-vivo bovine tissue. Ultrasound (US) images were used to provide visualization and shape-reconstruction of the instrument during the insertions. In the experiments lateral tip steering up to 20 mm was found. Manually controlled active needle tip steering in inhomogeneous tissue simulants and ex-vivo tissue resulted in mean targeting errors of 1.4 mm and 2 mm in 3D position, respectively. The experiments show that steering response of the instrument is history-independent. The results indicate that the endpoint accuracy of the steerable instrument is similar to that of the conventional rigid HDR BT needle while adding the ability to steer along curved paths. Due to the design of the steerable needle sufficient axial and flexural rigidity is preserved to enable puncturing and path control within various heterogeneous tissues. The developed instrument has the potential to overcome problems currently unavoidable with conventional instruments, such as pubic arch interference in HDR BT, without major changes to the clinical workflow."
https://openalex.org/W4200564453,"Quaternary Red Clay (QRC) is the most common planting soil with low soil fertility and low crop yields in Southeast China, with low soil fertility and low crop yields. Many factors can impact the fertility and utilization efficiency of QRC. Here, we conducted a long-term fertilization experiment from 1984 to 2013. Five fertilization measures were carried out, including non-fertilization group; chemical Fertilizer group; 70% chemical and 30% organic fertilizer group; 50% chemical and 50% organic fertilizer group; 30% chemical and 70% organic fertilizer group. Soil organic matter (OM), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total potassium (TK), soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC) and nitrogen (SMBN), and soil enzymes activity were measured to evaluate the changes of soil. In addition, soil microorganisms were determined by high-throughput sequencing technology, and the dominant microbes were screened. The higher the proportion of organic fertilizer was, the higher the soil OM content was. The OM content of the non-fertilization group was the lowest. Similarly, SMBC and SMBN showed a consistent trend with OM content. Illumina sequence results showed that the application of organic fertilizer reduced the relative abundance of Chloroflexi , Acidobacteria and Nitrospirae , but increased Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria . The relative abundance of Acremonium and Mortierella were also greatly increased by different fertilization strategies. However, when high proportion of organic fertilizer was applied, the abundance of Acremonium and Mortierella decreased. Long-term balanced inorganic fertilization (NPK, 60%N:20%P:20%K) can effectively improve the quality and fertility of QRC. The effect of different fertilization strategies on fungi was greater than that on bacteria. The change of soil microorganism also proved the validity of inorganic fertilizer application."

https://openalex.org/W4200323951,"Celiac disease (CD) is now viewed as a systemic disease with multifaceted clinical manifestations. Among the extra-intestinal features, neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms are still a diagnostic challenge, since they can precede or follow the diagnosis of CD. In particular, it is well known that some adults with CD may complain of cognitive symptoms, that improve when the gluten-free diet (GFD) is started, although they may re-appear after incidental gluten intake. Among the neurophysiological techniques, motor evoked potentials (MEPs) to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can non-invasively probe in vivo the excitation state of cortical areas and cortico-spinal conductivity, being also able to unveil preclinical impairment in several neurological and psychiatric disorders, as well as in some systemic diseases affecting the central nervous system (CNS), such as CD. We previously demonstrated an intracortical disinhibition and hyperfacilitation of MEP responses to TMS in newly diagnosed patients. However, no data are available on the central cholinergic functioning indexed by specific TMS measures, such as the short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI), which might represent the neurophysiological correlate of cognitive changes in CD patients, also at the preclinical level.Cognitive and depressive symptoms were screened by means of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), respectively, in 15 consecutive de novo CD patients and 15 healthy controls. All patients were on normal diet at the time of the enrolment. Brain computed tomography (CT) was performed in all patients. SAI, recorded at two interstimulus intervals (2 and 8 ms), was assessed as the percentage amplitude ratio between the conditioned and the unconditioned MEP response. Resting motor threshold, MEP amplitude and latency, and central motor conduction time were also measured.The two groups were comparable for age, sex, anthropometric features, and educational level. Brain CT ruled out intracranial calcifications and clear radiological abnormalities in all patients. Scores at MoCA and HDRS were significantly worse in patients than in controls. The comparison of TMS data between the two groups revealed no statistically significant difference for all measures, including SAI at both interstimulus intervals.Central cholinergic functioning explored by the SAI of the motor cortex resulted to be not affected in these de novo CD patients compared to age-matched healthy controls. Although the statistically significant difference in MoCA, an overt cognitive impairment was not clinically evident in CD patients. Coherently, to date, no study based on TMS or other diagnostic techniques has shown any involvement of the central acetylcholine or the cholinergic fibers within the CNS in CD. This finding might add support to the vascular inflammation hypothesis underlying the so-called ""gluten encephalopathy"", which seems to be due to an aetiology different from that of the cholinergic dysfunction. Longitudinal studies correlating clinical, TMS, and neuroimaging data, both before and after GFD, are needed."

This study aims to assess seroprevalence and risk factors for HBsAg and anti-HCV positivity in three large regions of Kazakhstan.A cross-sectional study was conducted in three regions geographically remote from each other. Participants were randomly selected using a two-stage stratified cluster sampling and were surveyed by a questionnaire based on the WHO STEP survey instrument. Blood samples were collected for HBsAg and anti-HCV testing.A total of 4,620 participants were enrolled. The seroprevalence was 5.5% (95%CI: 3.6%-8.4%) for HBsAg and 5.1% (95%CI: 3.5%-7.5%) for anti-HCV antibodies. Both were more prevalent in the western and northern regions than in the southern. A history of blood transfusion was significantly associated with anti-HCV presence, with odds ratios (ORs) of 2.10 (95%CI: 1.37-3.21) and was borderline associated with HBsAg 1.39 (95%CI: 0.92-2.10), respectively. Having a family member with viral hepatitis was also borderline associated (2.09 (95%CI: 0.97-4.50)) with anti-HCV positivity.This study found a high-intermediate level of endemicity for HBsAg and a high level of endemicity for anti-HCV antibodies in three large regions of Kazakhstan. We found that history of surgery was not associated with HbsAg neither with anti-HCV seropositivity rates. Blood transfusion was associated with anti-HCV seropositivity, however, to investigate effectiveness of the introduced comprehensive preventive measures in health care settings, there is a need to conduct further epidemiological studies."

A measure to reverse this trend is to fully implement the Uganda Clinical Guidelines on care for mothers and newborns during pregnancy, delivery and the postnatal period. This study aimed to describe women's experiences of maternal and newborn health care services and support systems, focusing on antenatal care, delivery and the postnatal period.We used triangulation of qualitative methods including participant observations, semi-structured interviews with key informants and focus group discussions with mothers. Audio-recorded data were transcribed word by word in the local language and translated into English. All collected data material were stored using two-level password protection or stored in a locked cabinet. Malterud's Systematic text condensation was used for analysis, and NVivo software was used to structure the data.Antenatal care was valued by mothers although not always accessible due to transport cost and distance. Mothers relied on professional health workers and traditional birth attendants for basic maternal services but expressed general discontentment with spousal support in maternal issues. Financial dependency, gender disparities, and lack of autonomy in decision making on maternal issues, prohibited women from receiving optimal help and support. Postnatal follow-ups were found unsatisfactory, with no scheduled follow-ups from professional health workers during the first six weeks.Further focus on gender equity, involving women's right to own decision making in maternity issues, higher recognition of male involvement in maternity care and improved postnatal follow-ups are suggestions to policy makers for improved maternal care and newborn health in Buikwe District, Uganda."
https://openalex.org/W4200128633,"Attention is considered to be a critical part of the sexual response cycle, and researchers have differentiated between the roles of initial (involuntary) and subsequent (voluntary) attention paid to sexual stimuli as part of the facilitation of sexual arousal. Prior studies using eye-tracking methodologies have shown differing initial attention patterns to erotic stimuli between men and women, as well as between individuals of different sexual orientations. No study has directly compared initial attention to sexual stimuli in asexual individuals, defined by their lack of sexual attraction, to women with Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder (SIAD), a disorder characterized by a reduced or absent interest in sex coupled with significant personal distress. The current study tested differences in the initial attention patterns of 29 asexual individuals (Mage = 26.56, SD = 4.80) and 25 heterosexual women with SIAD (Mage = 27.52, SD = 4.87), using eye-tracking. Participants were presented with sexual and neutral stimuli, and their initial eye movements and initial fixations to both image types and areas of erotic contact within sexual images were recorded. Mixed-model ANOVAs and t-tests were used to compare the two groups on the speed with which their initial fixations occurred, the duration of their initial fixations, and the proportion of initial fixations made to sexual stimuli. On two indices of initial attention, women with SIAD displayed an initial attention preference for sexual stimuli over neutral stimuli compared to asexual participants. This study adds to a growing literature on the distinction between asexuality and SIAD, indicating that differences in early attention may be a feature that differentiates the groups."
https://openalex.org/W4200224454,"Background To investigate the efficacy and safety of a second-generation bipolar transurethral electro vaporization of the prostate (B-TUVP) with the new oval-shaped electrode for large benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) with prostate volume (PV) ≥100ml. Materials and methods 100 patients who underwent second-generation B-TUVP with the oval-shaped electrode for male lower urinary tract symptom (LUTS) or urinary retention between July 2018 and July 2020 were enrolled in this study. The patients’ characteristics and treatment outcome were retrospectively compared between patients with PV &lt;100ml and ≥100ml. Results 17/41 (41.5%) cases of PV ≥100ml and 24/59 cases (40.7%) of PV &lt;100ml were catheterised due to urinary retention. The duration of post-operative catheter placement and hospital-stay of PV ≥100ml (3.1±1.3 and 5.6±2.3 days) were not different from PV &lt;100ml (2.7±1.2 and 5.0±2.4 days). In uncatheterised patients (N = 59), post-void residual urine volume (PVR) significantly decreased after surgery in both groups, however, maximum uroflow rate (Q max ) significantly increased after surgery only in PV &lt;100ml but not in PV ≥100ml. Voiding symptoms and patients’ QoL derived from International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), IPSS-QoL (IPSS Quality of Life Index) and BPH Impact Index (BII) scores, significantly improved after B-TUVP in both groups. Catheter free status after final B-TUVP among patients with preoperative urinary retention was achieved in 18/24 (75.0%) and 14/17 (82.1%) cases in patient with &lt;100ml and ≥100ml, respectively. There was no significant difference in post-operative Hb after B-TUVP, which was 97.0±5.4% of baseline for PV &lt;100ml and 96.9±6.1% for PV ≥100ml and no TUR syndrome was observed. Conclusions This is the first study investigating short-term efficacy and safety of second-generation B-TUVP with the oval-shaped electrode on large BPE. B-TUVP appears to be effective and safe for treating moderate-to-severe lower urinary tract symptoms and urinary retention in patients with large BPE."
https://openalex.org/W4200317212,"This paper proposes a multiple criteria group decision making with individual preferences (MCGDM-IP) to address the robot selection problem (RSP). Four objective criteria elicitation approaches, namely, Shannon entropy approach, CRITIC approach, distance-based approach, and ideal-point approach, are proposed to indicate individual decision makers. A preliminary group decision matrix is therefore formulated. Both preferential differences representing the preference degrees among different robots, and preferential priorities representing the favorite ranking of robots for each individual decision maker, are analyzed to propose a revised group decision matrix. A satisfaction index is developed to manifest the merits of the proposed MCGDM-IP. An illustrative example using the data drawn from previous literature is conducted to indicate the effectiveness and validity of MCGDM-IP. The results demonstrate that the MCGDM-IP could generate a more satisfactory scheme to evaluate and select industrial robots, with an improvement of group satisfactory level as 2.12%."
https://openalex.org/W4200398633,"The Sustainable Development Goal Three has prioritised reducing maternal, under-5 and neonatal mortalities as core global health policy objectives. The place, where expectant mothers choose to deliver their babies has a direct effect on maternal health outcomes. In sub-Saharan Africa, existing literature has shown that some women attend antenatal care during pregnancy but choose to deliver their babies at home. Using the Andersen and Newman Behavioural Model, this study explored the institutional and socio-cultural factors motivating women to deliver at home after attending antenatal care.A qualitative, exploratory, cross-sectional design was deployed. Data were collected from a purposive sample of 23 women, who attended antenatal care during pregnancy but delivered their babies at home, 10 health workers and 17 other community-level stakeholders. The data were collected through semi-structured interviews, which were audio-recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed.In line with the Andersen and Newman Model, the study discovered that traditional and religious belief systems about marital fidelity and the role of the gods in childbirth, myths about consequences of facility-based delivery, illiteracy, and weak women's autonomy in healthcare decision-making, predisposed women to home delivery. Home delivery was also enabled by inadequate midwives at health facilities, the unfriendly attitude of health workers, hidden charges for facility-based delivery, and long distances to healthcare facilities. The fear of caesarean section, also created the need for women who attended antenatal care to deliver at home.The study has established that socio-cultural and institutional level factors influenced women's decisions to deliver at home. We recommend a general improvement in the service delivery capacity of health facilities, and the implementation of collaborative educational and women empowerment programmes by stakeholders, to strengthen women's autonomy and reshape existing traditional and religious beliefs facilitating home delivery."

Circulating biomarkers such as plasma microRNAs (miRNAs) have proven to be surrogates for diagnosis, severity and case management of infections. The expression of four selected miRNAs (miR-146-3p, miR-147b, miR-155 and miR-223) was validated for their prognostic and diagnostic potential in a clinically defined cohort of patients with sepsis and septic shock.The expression of plasma miRNAs was quantified by quantitative PCR (qPCR) in patients with bacterial sepsis (n = 78), in patients with septic shock (n = 52) and in patients with dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF; n = 69) and in healthy controls (n = 82).The expression of studied miRNA was significantly increased in patients with bacterial sepsis and septic shock. The plasma miR-147b was able to differentiate bacterial sepsis from non-sepsis and septic shock (AUC = 0.77 and 0.8, respectively, p≤ 0.05), while the combination of plasma miR-147b and procalcitonin (PCT) predicted septic shock (AUC = 0.86, p≤ 0.05).The plasma miR-147b may be an useful biomarker independently or in combination with PCT to support clinical diagnosis of sepsis and equally prognosis of patients with septic shock."
https://openalex.org/W4200510112,"Oncogenic multidrug resistance is commonly intrinsic to renal cancer based on the physiological expression of detoxification transporters, particularly ABCB1, thus hampering chemotherapy. ABCB1 activity is directly dependent on its lipid microenvironment, localizing to cholesterol- and sphingomyelin (SM)-rich domains. As ceramides are the sole source for SMs, we hypothesized that ceramide synthase (CerS)-derived ceramides regulate ABCB1 activity. Using data from RNA-Seq databases, we found that patient kidney tumors exhibited increased CerS2 mRNA, which was inversely correlated with CerS6 mRNA in ABCB1+ clear cell carcinomas. Endogenous elevated CerS2 and lower CerS5/6 mRNA and protein resulted in disproportionately higher CerS2 to CerS5/6 activities (approximately twofold) in chemoresistant ABCB1high (A498, Caki-1) compared with chemosensitive ABCB1low (ACHN, normal human proximal convoluted tubule cell) cells. In addition, lipidomics analyses by HPLC-MS/MS showed bias toward CerS2-associated C20:0/C20:1-ceramides compared with CerS5/6-associated C14:0/C16:0-ceramides (2:1). SMs were similarly altered. We demonstrated that chemoresistance to doxorubicin in ABCB1high cells was partially reversed by inhibitors of de novo ceramide synthesis (l-cycloserine) and CerS (fumonisin B1) in cell viability assays. Downregulation of CerS2/6, but not CerS5, attenuated ABCB1 mRNA, protein, plasma membrane localization, rhodamine 123+ efflux transport activity, and doxorubicin resistance. Similar findings were observed with catalytically inactive CerS6-H212A. Furthermore, CerS6-targeting siRNA shifted ceramide and SM composition to ultra long-chain species (C22-C26). Inhibitors of endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (eeyarestatin I) and the proteasome (MG132, bortezomib) prevented ABCB1 loss induced by CerS2/6 downregulation. We conclude that a critical balance in ceramide/SM species is prerequisite to ABCB1 expression and functionalization, which could be targeted to reverse multidrug resistance in renal cancers."
https://openalex.org/W4200525780,"The United States is experiencing a drug addiction and overdose crisis, made worse by the COVID-19 pandemic. Relative to other types of health services, addiction treatment and overdose prevention services are particularly vulnerable to disaster-related disruptions for multiple reasons including fragmentation from the general medical system and stigma, which may lead decisionmakers and providers to de-prioritize these services during disasters. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. states implemented multiple policies designed to mitigate disruptions to addiction treatment and overdose prevention services, for example policies expanding access to addiction treatment delivered via telehealth and policies designed to support continuity of naloxone distribution programs. There is limited evidence on the effects of these policies on addiction treatment and overdose. This evidence is needed to inform state policy design in future disasters, as well as to inform decisions regarding whether to sustain these policies post-pandemic.The overall study uses a concurrent-embedded design. Aims 1-2 use difference-in-differences analyses of large-scale observational databases to examine how state policies designed to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on health services delivery influenced addiction treatment delivery and overdose during the pandemic. Aim 3 uses a qualitative embedded multiple case study approach, in which we characterize local implementation of the state policies of interest; most public health disaster policies are enacted at the state level but implemented at the local level by healthcare systems and local public health authorities.Triangulation of results across methods will yield robust understanding of whether and how state disaster-response policies influenced drug addiction treatment and overdose during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results will inform policy enactment and implementation in future public health disasters. Results will also inform decisions about whether to sustain COVID-19 pandemic-related changes to policies governing delivery addiction and overdose prevention services long-term."
https://openalex.org/W4200403829,"Malnutrition continues to be a primary concern for researchers and policymakers in India. There is limited scientific research on the effect of agriculture on child nutrition in the country using a large representative sample. To the best of our knowledge, no study has examined the spatial clustering of child malnutrition and its linkage with agricultural production at the district-level in the country. The present study aims to examine agricultural production's role in improving the nutritional status of Indian children through child feeding practices. The nutritional indicators of children from the National Family Health Survey-4 (2015-16) and the agricultural production data for all the 640 districts of India obtained from the District-Wise Crop Production Statistics (2015-16), published by the Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India were used for the analysis. The statistical analysis was undertaken in STATA (version 14.1). ArcMap (version 10.3), and GeoDa (version 1.8) were used for the spatial analysis. The study found a higher prevalence of malnutrition among children who had not received Minimum Meal Frequency (MMF), Minimum Dietary Diversity (MDD), and Minimum Acceptable Diet (MAD). Further, child feeding practices- MMF, MDD, and MAD- were positively associated with high yield rates of spices and cereals. The yield rate of cash crops, on the contrary, harmed child feeding practices. Production of pulses had a significant positive effect on MDD and MAD. Districts with high cereal yield rates ensured that children receive MMF and MAD. There is a significant spatial association between child feeding practices and malnutrition across Indian districts. The study suggests that adopting nutrient-sensitive agriculture may be the best approach to improving children's nutritional status."
https://openalex.org/W4200456963,"At present, the focus of the fighting against COVID-19 in China is shifting to strictly prevent the entrance of cases from abroad and disease transmission. Therefore, it is extremely urgent to better understand the clinical features of imported cases from overseas countries, which is conductive to formulate the corresponding countermeasures. This study aimed to describe the clinical features of COVID-19 cases imported from Russia through the Suifenhe port, in order to identify baseline and clinical data associated with disease progression and present corresponding countermeasures.All COVID-19 cases imported from Russia through the Suifenhe port were included in this retrospective study. According to the ""Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (seventh edition)"", imported COVID-19 cases were divided into asymptomatic infection, mild, moderate, severe, and critical groups. Baseline and clinical data, including age, gender, comorbidities, disease severity, symptoms at onset, body temperature, white blood cell (WBC) count, lymphocyte (LYMPH) count, lymphocyte percentage (LYM%), C-reactive protein (CRP), oxygenation index (OI), and the use therapeutic modalities were obtained on admission, and then compared between groups.A total of 375 COVID-19 cases imported from Russia through Suifenhe port were included, of whom the asymptomatic infection, mild, moderate, severe, and critical groups accounted for 4.0%, 13.9%, 75.5%, 5.3%, and 1.3%, respectively. The majority of the imported COVID-19 cases were men (61.9%) with a median age of 38.72 years who had no comorbidity (87.7%). Nearly one-third of them (33.1%) were asymptomatic at onset, and common initial symptoms included fever (36.5%), cough (36.0%), pharyngeal discomfort (12.3%), expectoration (8.0%), and chest tightness (5.3%). In total, 180 (48%) and 4 (1.1%) enrolled imported cases received nasal tube oxygen inhalation therapy and high-flow oxygen absorption, respectively; the remaining patients did not undergo oxygen therapy. The values of age, body temperature, WBC, LYMPH, LYM%, CRP, and OI were 38.72 ± 10.50, 35.10 ± 7.92, 5.59 ± 1.97, 1.67 ± 0.68, 31.05 ± 10.22, 8.00 ± 14.75, and 389.03 ± 74.07, respectively. Gender, age, LYMPH, LYM%, symptoms at onset, cough, fever, other rare symptoms, and oxygen therapy showed significant differences between groups (P = 0.036, < 0.001, < 0.001, < 0.001, < 0.001, < 0.001, < 0.001, = 0.045, < 0.001, respectively).Compared with domestic confirmed patients, COVID-19 patients who arrived at China from Russia through the Suifenhe port had significantly different clinical features, and the differences in gender, age, LYMPH, LYM%, symptoms at onset, cough, fever, other rare symptoms, and oxygen therapy between groups were statistically significant. Therefore, detailed and comprehensive countermeasures were developed to manage and prevent another outbreak based on these clinical features."
https://openalex.org/W4200473033,"Cardiac hypertrophy is a complex process induced by the activation of multiple signaling pathways. We previously reported that anacardic acid (AA), a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) inhibitor, attenuates phenylephrine (PE)-induced cardiac hypertrophy by downregulating histone H3 acetylation at lysine 9 (H3K9ac). Unfortunately, the related upstream signaling events remained unknown. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is an important regulator of cardiac hypertrophy. In this study, we explored the role of JNK/MAPK signaling pathway in cardiac hypertrophy induced by PE. The mice cardiomyocyte hypertrophy model was successfully established by treating cells with PE in vitro . This study showed that p-JNK directly interacts with HATs (P300 and P300/CBP-associated factor, PCAF) and alters H3K9ac. In addition, both the JNK inhibitor SP600125 and the HAT inhibitor AA attenuated p-JNK overexpression and H3K9ac hyperacetylation by inhibiting P300 and PCAF during PE-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Moreover, we demonstrated that both SP600125 and AA attenuate the overexpression of cardiac hypertrophy-related genes ( MEF2A , ANP , BNP , and β-MHC ), preventing cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and dysfunction. These results revealed a novel mechanism through which AA might protect mice from PE-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. In particular, AA inhibits the effects of JNK signaling on HATs-mediated histone acetylation, and could therefore be used to prevent and treat pathological cardiac hypertrophy."

Recent research introduces a utility theory for measuring subjective happiness in a social context. The past recent monetary conditions influence the present subjective happiness through two distinct channels: interpersonal comparison and self-adaptation. In this paper, we develop this theory to analyze behavioral patterns. Together with prospect theory’s gain-loss utility function, we exploit the theory in predicting psychological phenomena of craving. We explore the relationships between happiness and earnings. Under certain conditions, a high payoff disappoints you immediately and even leads to continuous disappointment across periods. We extend the explanations of the scenarios of New York cabdrivers’ labor-supply decisions. The effect of social comparisons may trigger workers’ behaviors of quit-working, which deepen related understandings of the literature."

However, the biosynthesis pathway of ESCs in E. arachidis has not been elucidated and the potential pathogenic mechanism of E. arachidis is poorly understood. In this study, we report a high-quality genome sequence of E. arachidis. The size of the E. arachidis genome is 33.18Mb, which is comparable to the Ascomycota genome (average 36.91 Mb), encoding 9174 predicted genes. The self-detoxification family including transporters and cytochrome P450 enzymes were analysis, candidate effectors and cell wall degrading enzymes were investigated as the pathogenicity genes by using PHI and CAZy databases. Additionally, the E. arachidis genome contains 24 secondary metabolism gene clusters, in which ESCB1 was identified as the core gene of ESC biosynthesis. Taken together, the genome sequence of E. arachidis provides a new route to explore its potential pathogenic mechanism and the biosynthesis pathway of ESCs."
https://openalex.org/W4200149862,"The Arctic is experiencing rapid changes in sea-ice seasonality and extent, with significant consequences for primary production. With the importance of accurate monitoring of spring phytoplankton dynamics in a changing Arctic, this study further examines the previously established critical relationship between spring phytoplankton bloom types and timing of the sea-ice retreat for broader temporal and spatial coverages, with a particular focus on the Pacific Arctic for 2003-2019. To this end, time-series of satellite-retrieved phytoplankton biomass were modeled using a parametric Gaussian function, as an effective approach to capture the development and decay of phytoplankton blooms. Our sensitivity analysis demonstrated accurate estimates of timing and presence/absence of peaks in phytoplankton biomass even with some missing values, suggesting the parametric Gaussian function is a powerful tool for capturing the development and decay of phytoplankton blooms. Based on the timing and presence/absence of a peak in phytoplankton biomass and following the classification developed by the previous exploratory work, spring bloom types are classified into three groups (under-ice blooms, probable under-ice blooms, and marginal ice zone blooms). Our results showed that the proportion of under-ice blooms was higher in the Chukchi Sea than in the Bering Sea. The probable under-ice blooms registered as the dominant bloom types in a wide area of the Pacific Arctic, whereas the marginal ice zone bloom was a relatively minor bloom type across the Pacific Arctic. Associated with a shift of sea-ice retreat timing toward earlier dates, we confirmed previous findings from the Chukchi Sea of recent shifts in phytoplankton bloom types from under-ice blooms to marginal ice zone blooms and demonstrated that this pattern holds for the broader Pacific Arctic sector for the time period 2003-2019. Overall, the present study provided additional evidence of the changing sea-ice retreat timing that can drive variations in phytoplankton bloom dynamics, which contributes to addressing the detection and consistent monitoring of the biophysical responses to the changing environments in the Pacific Arctic."

Three isolates of the causative virus, Fowl adenonovirus (FAdV)were characterized from chickens with IBH, but their pathogenicity has never been investigated. In this work, the pathogenicity of an isolate FAdV 11 (MOR300315 strain) was evaluated by inoculating a group of 40 SPF chickens at 3 days of age by oral route. A group of 40 chicks injected with phosphate-buffered saline solution was used as a control group. The infected chickens showed decreased weight gain from 3dpi. Necropsy displayed pallor and enlargement in liver, swelling and slight hemorrhage in kidney and spleen at 6 dpi. Histopathological changes were mainly characterized by severe and extensive hepatic necrosis associated with the presence of basophilic intra-nuclear inclusion bodies within hepatocytes. The FAdV was reisolated in chicken embryo fibroblast cell culture from liver tissue homogenate of infected chicken from 3 to 6 dpi. Viral DNA was detected by PCR in liver, kidney, spleen and cloacal swabs from 3 to 13 dpi. Antibody response against inoculated FAdV was appeared from 9 dpi. These results confirmed that the FAdV 11 strain is pathogenic in chicken. This study is the first experimental infection of FAdV 11 in chicken in Morocco, which increase our understanding of its pathogenicity in chickens and indicate that preventive measures against FAdV infection in poultry farms should be implemented in Morocco."

Loss or dysfunction of TRPMLs has been implicated in lysosomal storage disorders, infectious diseases, and metabolic diseases. TRPML2 has recently been identified as a mechanosensitive and hypotonicity-sensitive channel in endolysosomal organelles, which distinguishes it from TRPML1 and TRPML3. However, the molecular and gating mechanism of TRPML2 remains elusive. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of the full-length mouse TRPML2 in lipid nanodiscs at 3.14 Å resolution. The TRPML2 homotetramer structure at pH 7.4 in the apo state reveals an inactive conformation and some unique features of the extracytosolic/luminal domain and voltage sensor-like domain that have implications for the ion-conducting pathway. This structure enables new comparisons between the different subgroups of TRPML channels with available structures and provides structural insights into the conservation and diversity of TRPML channels. These comparisons have broad implications for understanding a variety of molecular mechanisms of TRPMLs in different pH conditions, including with and without bound agonists and antagonists."
https://openalex.org/W4200422089,"Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L . ) is an excellent cool-season turfgrass utilized widely in Northern China. However, turf quality of Kentucky bluegrass declines significantly due to drought. Ethephon seeds-soaking treatment has been proved to effectively improve the drought tolerance of Kentucky bluegrass seedlings. In order to investigate the effect of ethephon leaf-spraying method on drought tolerance of Kentucky bluegrass and understand the underlying mechanism, Kentucky bluegrass plants sprayed with and without ethephon are subjected to either drought or well watered treatments. The relative water content and malondialdehyde conent were measured. Meanwhile, samples were sequenced through Illumina. Results showed that ethephon could improve the drought tolerance of Kentucky bluegrass by elevating relative water content and decreasing malondialdehyde content under drought. Transcriptome analysis showed that 58.43% transcripts (254,331 out of 435,250) were detected as unigenes. A total of 9.69% (24,643 out of 254,331) unigenes were identified as differentially expressed genes in one or more of the pairwise comparisons. Differentially expressed genes due to drought stress with or without ethephon pre-treatment showed that ethephon application affected genes associated with plant hormone, signal transduction pathway and plant defense, protein degradation and stabilization, transportation and osmosis, antioxidant system and the glyoxalase pathway, cell wall and cuticular wax, fatty acid unsaturation and photosynthesis. This study provides a theoretical basis for revealing the mechanism for how ethephon regulates drought response and improves drought tolerance of Kentucky bluegrass."

However, the complex molecular and cellular processes that these viruses use to infect and multiply in human cells have been a source of great concern for the scientific community since the discovery of the first human infecting virus. Viral disease outbreaks, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus, have claimed millions of lives and caused significant economic damage worldwide. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of host-virus interaction and the molecular machinery involved in the pathogenesis of some common human viruses. We also performed a phylogenetic analysis of viral proteins involved in host-virus interaction to understand the changes in the sequence organization of these proteins during evolution for various strains of viruses to gain insights into the viral origin's evolutionary perspectives."

Although these laws were formulated more than half a century ago, they have been only investigated in a few languages. Here we present the first study of these laws in Catalan. We verify these laws in Catalan via the relationship among their exponents and that of the rank-frequency law. We present a new protocol for the analysis of these Zipfian laws that can be extended to other languages. We report the first evidence of two marked regimes for these laws in written language and speech, paralleling the two regimes in Zipf's rank-frequency law in large multi-author corpora discovered in early 2000s. Finally, the implications of these two regimes will be discussed."

The key problem in Chinese universities is the low efficiency of the scientific and technological (S&T) transformation, which limits the promotion of regional innovation and economic development. This article proposes the three-stage efficiency analytical framework, which regards it as a complex and interactive process. Avoiding the problem of considering the input and output of university S&T transformation as a ""black box"" and neglecting the links among different transformation stages. The super efficiency network SBM model is applied to the heterogeneous region of the Yangtze River Economic Belt. Empirical research proves that university S&T transformation has not been effectively improved and the scientific resources invested in universities have not been efficiently utilized in recent years. Generally, Despite the correlation between regional economy and transformation efficiency, the exclusive increase in resources is not enough. Regional openness and the quality of research talents are key factors for the application of technological innovation and technology marketization. Universities should not only pursue the number of research outputs but pay more attention to high-quality knowledge production to overcome difficulties in research achievements transformation."

Recent advances in novel technologies such as quantum and quantum-inspired hardware promise a substantial speedup for solving these problems compared to when using general purpose computers but often require the problem to be modeled in a special form, such as an Ising or quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) model, in order to take advantage of these devices. In this work, we focus on the important binary matrix factorization (BMF) problem which has many applications in data mining. We propose two QUBO formulations for BMF. We show how clustering constraints can easily be incorporated into these formulations. The special purpose hardware we consider is limited in the number of variables it can handle which presents a challenge when factorizing large matrices. We propose a sampling based approach to overcome this challenge, allowing us to factorize large rectangular matrices. In addition to these methods, we also propose a simple baseline algorithm which outperforms our more sophisticated methods in a few situations. We run experiments on the Fujitsu Digital Annealer, a quantum-inspired complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) annealer, on both synthetic and real data, including gene expression data.

To optimize HIV care, we sought to assess how caregiver's mobility impacts children living with HIV (CLHIV)´s continuation in HIV care and to explore the strategies used by caregivers to maintain their CLHIV on antiretroviral treatment (ART).A clinic-based cross-sectional survey conducted at the Manhiça District Hospital between December-2017 and February-2018. We enrolled CLHIV with a self-identified migrant caregiver (moved outside of Manhiça District ≤12 months prior to survey) and non-migrant caregiver, matched by the child age and sex. Survey data were linked to CLHIV clinical records from the HIV care and treatment program.Among the 975 CLHIV screened, 285 (29.2%) were excluded due to absence of an adult at the appointment. A total of 232 CLHIV-caregiver pairs were included. Of the 41 (35%) CLHIV migrating with their caregivers, 38 (92.6%) had access to ART at the destination because either the caregivers travelled with it 24 (63%) or it was sent by a family member 14 (36%). Among the 76 (65%) CLHIV who did not migrate with their caregivers, for the purpose of pharmacy visits, 39% were cared by their grandfather/grandmother, 28% by an aunt/uncle and 16% by an adult brother/sister. CLHIV of migrant caregivers had a non-statistically significant increase in the number of previous reported sickness episodes (OR = 1.38, 95%CI: 0.79-2.42; p = 0.257), ART interruptions (OR = 1.73; 95%CI: 0.82-3.63; p = 0.142) and lost-to-follow-up episodes (OR = 1.53; 95%CI: 0.80-2.94; p = 0.193).Nearly one third of the children attend their HIV care appointments unaccompanied by an adult. The caregiver mobility was not found to significantly affect child's retention on ART. Migrant caregivers adopted strategies such as the transportation of ART to the mobility destination to avoid impact of mobility on the child's HIV care. However this may have implications on ART stability and effectiveness that should be investigated in rural areas."
https://openalex.org/W4200319056,"Employment improves mental health and well-being by providing financial security, daily structure, a sense of identity and purpose, and social engagement. However, securing and sustaining employment is exceptionally challenging for vulnerable populations who experience persistent and multiple barriers, such as mental illness, homelessness, food and housing insecurity, and marginalization. Evidence-based supported employment programs, most notably individual placement and support (IPS) are becoming a more common approach for addressing the needs of these high-risk individuals. The aim of this paper is to outline the protocol for evaluating an IPS program in Vancouver's downtown and Downtown Eastside (DTES).This prospective quasi-experimental study of persons with persistent and multiple barriers to employment will use a mixed-methods approach for evaluating a novel IPS program. The evaluation will consist of survey packages and interviews that will capture outcomes related to employment and well-being, as well as the experiential process of receiving individualized and integrated supports through the IPS program. A mixed-methods approach is appropriate for this study as quantitative data will provide an objective assessment of program impacts on employment and well-being outcomes over time, while qualitative data will provide an in-depth understanding of continued barriers and experiences.The results from this evaluation will contribute evidence within a local British Columbian (BC) context that may increase access to meaningful employment for those with long-term experience of complex barriers to employment. Further, the findings will support continued improvements, and guide decision-making around practices and policy for future implementation of IPS and employment supports across BC."

Although occupational therapists champion client-centred, collaborative practice, there remains a paucity of studies detailing children's rights and experiences of decision-making in pediatric occupational therapy.This qualitative study described the decision-making experiences of children, parents and therapists in occupational therapy.Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 participants (six children, five parents and six occupational therapists), and data analysed using thematic analysis.Three themes emerged: 1) Goal-setting experiences; 2) Adults: child-rights gatekeepers or defenders? and 3) Decision-making in context. Findings suggest that decision-making is mostly adult directed, and children's voices are subsumed by adult-led services, priorities, and agendas.Children's rights need to be embedded as an aspect of best practice in providing services that are child-centred in occupational therapy practices and education."
https://openalex.org/W4200195744,"The frequent interruptions of network operation due to any incident suggest the necessity to study the rules of operational risk propagation in metro networks, especially under fully automatic operations mode. In this study, risk indicator computation models were developed by analyzing risk propagation processes within transfer stations and metro networks. Moreover, indicator variance rules for a transfer station and different structural networks were discussed and verified through simulation. After reviewing the simulation results, it was concluded that under the impacts of both sudden incident and peak passenger flow, the more the passengers coming from platform inlets, the longer the non-incidental line platform total train operation delay and the higher the crowding degree. However, train headway has little influence on non-incidental line platform risk development. With respect to incident risk propagation in a metro network, the propagation speed varies with network structure, wherein an annular-radial network is the fastest, a radial is moderately fast, and a grid-type network is the slowest. The conclusions are supposed to be supports for metro operation safety planning and network design."

We also analyzed the mutation patterns of gyrA, rrs, and embB genes for detection of resistance to OFL, KAN and EMB, respectively.The sensitivity and specificity of the MTBDRsl compared to phenotypic L-J DST were 81.8% (95% CI, 69.1-90.9) and 98.8% (95% CI, 95.6-99.8), respectively for OFL (PPV: 95.7% & NPV: 94.1%); 65.1% (95% CI, 57.5-72.2) and 86.7% (95% CI, 73.2-94.9), respectively for EMB (PPV: 94.9% & NPV: 39.4%); and 100% for KAN. The diagnostic accuracy of KAN, OFL and EMB were 100, 94.5 and 69.6%, respectively. Moreover, the sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of MtBDRsl for detection of XDR-TB was 100%. The most frequently observed mutations were at codon D94G (46.8%) of gyrA gene, A1401G (83.3%) of rrs gene, and M306V (41.5%) of the embB gene.Considering the excellent performance in this study we suggest that MTBDRsl assay can be used as an initial rapid test for detection of KAN and OFL susceptibility, as well as XDR-TB directly from smear-positive sputum specimens of MDR-TB patients in Bangladesh."
https://openalex.org/W4200555354,"To study the regulatory function of Bombyx mori (B. mori) miRNAs (bmo-miR) on the expression of fibroin light chain gene (BmFib-L), the 3'UTR of BmFib-L mRNA was used as the target for online prediction of miRNAs from miRBase using RNAhybrid Software, and miR-2845 was screened out. First, the expression profiles of miR-2845 and BmFib-L in larvae of the 5th instar were analyzed by Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Then recombinant plasmids (pcDNA3.0-pre-miR-2845 and pGL3.0-BmFib-L) were constructed to use for the expression of miR-2845 and BmFib-L 3'UTR, respectively. Cellular-level functional verification of miR-2845 on BmFib-L was carried out using multiple experimental methods (including dual luciferase reporter vectors, artificially synthesized mimics and inhibitors, and target site mutations). Finally, in vivo functional verification was performed by injecting the recombinant vector in 5th instar larvae. BmFib-L expression levels were detected using RT-qPCR in the posterior silk glands (PSG) of the injected larvae. Results showed that the expression of miR-2845 increased between the 1st and 5th day in 5th instar larvae, but began to decline on the 5th day, while the expression of the target gene BmFib-L increased sharply. This suggests that miR-2845 and BmFib-L expression levels show opposing trends, implying a negative regulatory relationship. In BmN cells, miR-2845 significantly down-regulated the expression of BmFib-L; the inhibitory effect of miR-2845 on BmFib-L was disappeared after mutation of the targeting site on 3'UTR of BmFib-L; in individuals, miR-2845 significantly down-regulated BmFib-L expression levels. Our results provide new experimental data for clarifying the molecular regulation mechanism of silk protein expression."

We recruited 30 consecutive patients who underwent corneal endothelial transplantation with Descemet’s stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) at Tohoku University Hospital between February 2014 and July 2017. During surgery, we obtained aqueous humor samples and later measured the concentrations of 27 cytokines with a Multiplex Bead Assay (Bio-Plex Pro). We counted CECs 1, 6 and 12 months after surgery, and used Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient to identify relationships between CEC depletion and the concentrations of detected cytokines. The loss of CECs 1–6 months after surgery was significantly correlated with IL-7, IP-10, MIP-1a and MIP-1b concentrations (-0.67, -0.48, -0.39, and -0.45, respectively, all P &lt;0.01). CEC loss 1–12 months after surgery was significantly correlated with IL-1b, IL-7, IP-10 and RANTES concentrations (-0.46, -0.52, -0.48, and -0.43, respectively). Multiple regression analysis showed that IL-7 concentration was significantly associated with CEC loss 1–6 months after surgery (b = -0.65, P &lt; 0.01) and IP-10 concentration was associated with CEC loss 1–12 months after surgery (β = -0.38, P &lt; 0.05). These results suggest that not only inflammatory cytokines but also IL-7, a cytokine related to lymphocytes, may be involved in the depletion of CECs after DSAEK, particularly depletion that occurs relatively early."

Binding of the N terminus of Staphylococcus aureus SC to host prothrombin triggers formation of an active SC·prothrombin∗ complex that cleaves host fibrinogen to Fbn. In addition, the C-terminal domain of the prototypical SC contains one pseudorepeat (PR) and seven repeats (R1 → R7) that bind fibrinogen/Fbn fragment D (frag D) by a mechanism that is unclear. Here, we define affinities and stoichiometries of frag D binding to C-terminal SC constructs, using fluorescence equilibrium binding, NMR titration, alanine scanning, and native PAGE. We found that constructs containing the PR and single repeats bound frag D with KD ∼50 to 130 nM and a 1:1 stoichiometry, indicating a conserved binding site bridging the PR and each repeat. NMR titration of PR–R7 with frag D revealed that residues 22 to 49, bridging PR and R7, constituted the minimal peptide (MP) for binding, corroborated by alanine scanning, and binding of labeled MP to frag D. MP alignment with the PR–R and inter-repeat junctions identified critical conserved residues. Full-length PR–(R1 → R7) bound frag D with KD ∼20 nM and a stoichiometry of 1:5, whereas constructs containing the PR and various three repeats competed with PR–(R1 → R7) for frag D binding, with a 1:3 stoichiometry.

Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is the leading cause of hospital-acquired infections targeting the skin, soft tissue, bone, and heart valves. S. aureus can cause endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and septicemia (1Lowy F.D. Staphylococcus aureus infections.N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 520-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (4524) Google Scholar).

Coagulase-positive S. aureus adheres to exposed subendothelium on heart valves damaged by turbulent blood flow, where deposition of platelets and fibrin (Fbn) creates adhesion foci for circulating bacteria (1Lowy F.D. Staphylococcus aureus infections.N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 520-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (4524) Google Scholar). Fbg also facilitates interactions between S. aureus and platelets (14Herrmann M.

Dis. 1993; 167: 312-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Our previous fluorescence equilibrium binding and native PAGE studies revealed for the first time that Fbg and Fbn bind free SC as well as its complex with host prothrombin (ProT); and that the fragment D (frag D) domain of Fbg/Fbn harbors major interaction sites for binding to the C-terminal repeat region of SC (15Panizzi P.

Abstract #27.Google Scholar). The current work identifies the binding motifs in the C-terminal SC region, essential for interaction with frag D, and defines the stoichiometry of frag D binding to free and ProT-complexed SC.SC is a bifunctional protein that uses its N terminus for conformational activation of ProT, the precursor of the central clotting protease, thrombin (T). Classical serine proteinase activation requires proteolytic cleavage of the Arg15–Ile16 peptide bond in the zymogen (chymotrypsinogen numbering), with release of a new N terminus that inserts in the Ile16-binding pocket to trigger formation of the active site (17Huber R. Bode W. Structural basis of activation and action of trypsin.Acc. Chem. Res. 1978; 11: 114-122Crossref Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 18Khan A. James M. Molecular mechanisms for the conversion of zymogens ro active proteolytic enzymes.Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 815-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). In contrast, our structure–function studies showed that formation of the active site in ProT by SC is a nonproteolytic mechanism, in which SC inserts its N terminus into the zymogen activation pocket, thereby forming a critical salt bridge required for conformational expression of the active site in ProT (19Friedrich R.

Chem. 2020; 295: 5614-5625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). In the absence of SC, Fbg binds to T at exosite I and is cleaved as a substrate. In the SC·ProT∗ (∗ denotes a fully expressed active site) and SC·T complexes, (pro)exosite I is occupied by the tight-binding N-terminal D2 domain, and a new binding site is expressed on these complexes for Fbg as a substrate (21Panizzi P. Friedrich R. Fuentes-Prior P. Richter K. Bock P.E. Bode W. Fibrinogen substrate recognition by staphylocoagulase.(pro)thrombin complexes.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1179-1187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The SC(1–325) fragment, containing the D1 and D2 domains, is sufficient for expression of this novel Fbg-binding site on the SC·ProT∗ and SC·T complexes and triggering of proteolytic Fbg cleavage to form Fbn clots.In addition to the N-terminal D1 and D2 ProT-binding domains, the prototypical full-length SC(1–660) from the S. aureus strain Newman D2 Tager 104 also contains a central region with unknown function and a C-terminal domain consisting of one 32-residue pseudorepeat (PR) and seven 27-residue tandem repeats, R1 → R7 (Fig. 1) with highly conserved inter-repeat sequences.

The present work identifies a conserved minimal peptide (MP), required for binding of PR–R constructs to frag D, by equilibrium binding, NMR titration, and alanine (Ala) scanning. The MP sequence bridges the PR and R junctions, exhibits alignment with inter-repeat junctions, and contains a set of conserved residues that are critical for frag D binding. Knowledge of this minimal binding site is useful for future development of mechanism-based antibody drugs targeting the SC C-terminal domain.We present an in-depth analysis of the potential of SC to bind multiple frag D units at its C-terminal repeat domain, independent of substrate Fbg binding to the catalytic SC·ProT∗ complex. We show that the full-length C-terminal repeat construct, PR–(R1 → R7) binds frag D with a stoichiometry of ∼5 frag D per construct; and constructs containing a leading PR and three R units in consecutive or arbitrary order bind frag D with a stoichiometry of ∼3. Shortening of the full-length repeat construct or changing the order of repeats did not alter the ability of repeats to bind frag D, reaffirming the requirement of aligned conserved residues at the repeat junctions for formation of multiple binding sites. Consistent with these observations, our data of in vivo localization of SC·ProT∗ complexes to areas rich in Fbg show involvement of a template mechanism that utilizes the SC C-terminal domain (15Panizzi P.

The high affinity of multiple binding sites for Fbg/Fbn D domains on a single SC molecule contributes to a mechanism of selective anchoring of proteolytically active SC·ProT∗ complexes on host Fbn–bacteria vegetations subjected to arterial shear stress.ResultsSequence alignment of the SC C-terminal repeatsThe C-terminal repeat alignment of SC(1–660) S. aureus Newman D2 Tager 104 was performed using an online box shade alignment program, http://embnet.vital-it.ch/software/BOX_form.html. Figure 2 shows the sequence alignment of PR, 32 amino acid residues, with R1 to R7, each 27 residues in length. PR and the repeats show a 30 to 40% conserved sequence, and there is >80% pairwise identity among the repeats. Repeats R2, R4, and R5 are identical. We identified the MP sequence as described later, and in Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8, Figure 9, Figure 10, Figure 11, the MP alignment is shown with the bridging sequences between repeats and conserved residues (red) at positions G37, Y41, A43, R44, P45, K49, and P50 (PR–R7 numbering). The residues G28 and I31 are present only in the PR and are replaced with similar size hydrophobic residues A and V in the repeats. PR–Rx constructs used in this study were created with a 10-residue SC sequence preceding the PR to preserve the integrity of a putative binding site; five residues of the SC sequence were added at the C-terminal end of constructs ending in R7 to simplify expression, and a Cys residue was introduced for labeling purposes, as detailed in the “Experimental procedures” section.Figure 2Sequence alignment of the C-terminal pseudorepeat (PR) and the repeats (R1–R7) from SC of Staphylococcus aureus Newman D2 Tager 104.

The alignment shows the conserved residues (red) at positions G37, Y41, A43, R44, P45, K49, and P50. The residues G28 and I31 are present only in the PR and are replaced with similar size hydrophobic residues A and V in other repeats. Residue numbering in the MP is consistent with the PR–R7 construct including additional N-terminal and C-terminal residues, as used in the NMR experiments. The last line in the figure is the remainder of R7. Sequences of putative interactions with frag D molecules, identified by Ko, are underlined in blue (Coa-RI sequence and individual Ala residue scanning). Our Ala-scanned sequences are underlined in green. frag D, fibrinogen fragment D; MP, minimal peptide; PR, pseudorepeat; R, repeat; SC, staphylocoagulase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Size-exclusion chromatography and light scatteringSC(1–325) containing only the N-terminal domains D1 and D2, and full-length SC(1–660) that includes the C-terminal repeats, were chromatographed separately and in mixtures with frag D. Figure 3A shows the elution profile of SC(1–325) (black), frag D (red), and their mixture (blue). Light scattering indicated that SC(1–325) (Mr = 38,000 Da) eluted with an apparent molecular mass of ∼32,500 Da. Frag D (relative molecular mass [Mr], 88,000 Da) showed a hydrodynamic property–related anomaly, eluting in the same apparent molecular mass range, in part because of interaction of frag D with the column matrix. The SC(1–325) and frag D mixture eluted at a position similar to SC(1–325) and frag D alone, suggesting that SC(1–325) does not form a high Mr complex with frag D. Figure 3B shows the elution profile of SC(1–660) (black), frag D (red), and their mixture (blue). Light scattering indicated that SC(1–660) (Mr, 74,390 Da) eluted with apparent molecular mass of ∼81,200 Da. The mixture of SC(1–660) and frag D showed a new peak eluting at ∼165,000 Da, suggesting that the C-terminal region of SC(1–660) binds frag D.Native PAGE of frag D binding to SC(1–660), [5F]PR–R1, the SC(1–660)·[5F]ProT complex, and labeled C-terminal repeat constructsFormation of multimeric SC(1–660)·frag D complexes was confirmed by native PAGE (Fig. 3C). Frag D (lane 10, Mr, 88 KDa) runs faster than SC(1–660) (lane 1, Mr, 74.4 KDa) because of combined differences in isoelectric point, hydrodynamic properties, secondary structure, and native charge density, unlike in SDS-PAGE. Minor frag D proteolysis bands were due to Fbg digestion by trypsin during frag D preparation. Upon binding of frag D to SC(1–660), the SC(1–660)·frag D complex band shifted, starting at twofold molar excess frag D, and the shift and band intensity became more pronounced at increasing frag D"
