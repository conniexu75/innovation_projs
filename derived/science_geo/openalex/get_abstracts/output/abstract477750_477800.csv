https://openalex.org/W2015345028,"Drug With a (Re)Purpose Thalidomide, once infamous for its deleterious effects on fetal development, has re-emerged as a drug of great interest because of its beneficial immunomodulatory effects. A derivative drug called lenalidomide significantly extends the survival of patients with multiple myeloma, but the molecular mechanisms underlying its efficacy remain unclear (see the Perspective by Stewart ). Building on a previous observation that thalidomide binds to cereblon, a ubiquitin ligase, Lu et al. (p. 305 , published online 28 November) and Krönke et al. (p. 301 , published online 28 November) show that in the presence of lenalidomide, cereblon selectively targets two B cell transcription factors (Ikaros family members, IKZF1 and IKZF3) for degradation. In myeloma cell lines and patient cells, down-regulation of IKZF1 and IKZF3 was necessary and sufficient for the drug's anticancer activity. Thus, lenalidomide may act, at least in part, by “grepurposing” a ubiquitin ligase."

https://openalex.org/W2170654934,"Using olfactory molecular specificity, we examined the inheritance of parental traumatic exposure, a phenomenon that has been frequently observed, but not understood. We subjected F0 mice to odor fear conditioning before conception and found that subsequently conceived F1 and F2 generations had an increased behavioral sensitivity to the F0-conditioned odor, but not to other odors. When an odor (acetophenone) that activates a known odorant receptor (Olfr151) was used to condition F0 mice, the behavioral sensitivity of the F1 and F2 generations to acetophenone was complemented by an enhanced neuroanatomical representation of the Olfr151 pathway. Bisulfite sequencing of sperm DNA from conditioned F0 males and F1 naive offspring revealed CpG hypomethylation in the Olfr151 gene. In addition, in vitro fertilization, F2 inheritance and cross-fostering revealed that these transgenerational effects are inherited via parental gametes. Our findings provide a framework for addressing how environmental information may be inherited transgenerationally at behavioral, neuroanatomical and epigenetic levels."
https://openalex.org/W2127479534,"A new protocol enables efficient differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells to lung cells, including type II alveolar epithelial cells. The ability to generate lung and airway epithelial cells from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) would have applications in regenerative medicine, modeling of lung disease, drug screening and studies of human lung development. We have established, based on developmental paradigms, a highly efficient method for directed differentiation of hPSCs into lung and airway epithelial cells. Long-term differentiation of hPSCs in vivo and in vitro yielded basal, goblet, Clara, ciliated, type I and type II alveolar epithelial cells. The type II alveolar epithelial cells were capable of surfactant protein-B uptake and stimulated surfactant release, providing evidence of specific function. Inhibiting or removing retinoic acid, Wnt and BMP—agonists to signaling pathways critical for early lung development in the mouse—recapitulated defects in corresponding genetic mouse knockouts. As this protocol generates most cell types of the respiratory system, it may be useful for deriving patient-specific therapeutic cells."

https://openalex.org/W2144577119,"The increase of cell surface sialic acid is a characteristic shared by many tumor types. A correlation between hypersialylation and immunoprotection has been observed, but few hypotheses have provided a mechanistic understanding of this immunosuppressive phenomenon. Here, we show that increasing sialylated glycans on cancer cells inhibits human natural killer (NK) cell activation through the recruitment of sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin 7 (Siglec-7). Key to these findings was the use of glycopolymers end-functionalized with phospholipids, which enable the introduction of synthetically defined glycans onto cancer cell surfaces. Remodeling the sialylation status of cancer cells affected the susceptibility to NK cell cytotoxicity via Siglec-7 engagement in a variety of tumor types. These results support a model in which hypersialylation offers a selective advantage to tumor cells under pressure from NK immunosurveillance by increasing Siglec ligands. We also exploited this finding to protect allogeneic and xenogeneic primary cells from NK-mediated killing, suggesting the potential of Siglecs as therapeutic targets in cell transplant therapy."

https://openalex.org/W2086961060,"Computing an Image Firing off a burst of laser pulses and detecting the back-reflected photons is a widely used method for constructing three-dimensional (3D) images of a scene. Kirmani et al. (p. 58 , published online 29 November) describe an active imaging method in which pulsed laser light raster scans a scene and a single-photon detector is used to detect the first photon of the back-reflected laser light. Exploiting spatial correlations of photons scattered from different parts of the scene allows computation of a 3D image. Importantly, for biological applications, the technique allows the laser power to be reduced without sacrificing image quality."
https://openalex.org/W2072066100,"It is now recognized that extensive expression heterogeneities among cells precede the emergence of lineages in the early mammalian embryo. To establish a map of pluripotent epiblast (EPI) versus primitive endoderm (PrE) lineage segregation within the inner cell mass (ICM) of the mouse blastocyst, we characterized the gene expression profiles of individual ICM cells. Clustering analysis of the transcriptomes of 66 cells demonstrated that initially they are non-distinguishable. Early in the segregation, lineage-specific marker expression exhibited no apparent correlation, and a hierarchical relationship was established only in the late blastocyst. Fgf4 exhibited a bimodal expression at the earliest stage analysed, and in its absence, the differentiation of PrE and EPI was halted, indicating that Fgf4 drives, and is required for, ICM lineage segregation. These data lead us to propose a model where stochastic cell-to-cell expression heterogeneity followed by signal reinforcement underlies ICM lineage segregation by antagonistically separating equivalent cells. To delineate the characteristics of lineage emergence in the early mammalian embryo, Hiiragi and colleagues analyse the expression profiles of single cells of the inner cell mass as they differentiate into pluripotent epiblast and primitive endoderm. They observe that cells with initially indistinguishable expression profiles, but exhibiting apparently stochastic differences, resolve into distinct lineages in the late blastocyst through the action of Fgf4."
https://openalex.org/W2057579138,"Battle of the Sexes In many species, males compete with one another to propagate their own DNA, often to the detriment of females (see the Perspective by Promislow and Kaeberlein ). Shi and Murphy (p. 536 , published online 19 December) discovered that mating in Caenorhabditis species causes mothers to shrink and die soon after they have ceased producing progeny. Males appear to hijack the longevity and stress resistance pathways normally employed by the mothers to slow reproduction and somatic aging in times of stress. Maures et al. (p. 541 , published online 29 November) explored why the presence of abundant mating-competent males causes a decrease in the life span of nematodes of the opposite sex and found that a secreted substance, possibly a pheromone, reproduced the effect of the males when transferred in the culture medium. Detection of pheromones from a female fruit fly is enough to cause changes in metabolism, reduce resistance to starvation, and shorten the life span of male flies. Gendron et al. (p. 544 , published online 29 November) report that the signals from the female appear to be recognized by sensory receptors on the legs of male flies."
https://openalex.org/W2082621592,"The crystal structure of an archaeal Rce1 protein has been determined; this protein represents a novel type of intramembrane protease, with a distinct architecture and catalytic site. The signalling functions of CAAX proteins, which include Ras and Rho small GTPases, are determined by their correct location at cellular membranes. Membrane localization is controlled by post-translational modifications of their C-terminal CAAX motifs involving cysteine prenylation, endoproteolysis and methylation of the carboxyl-prenylated cysteine residue. Here David Barford and colleagues present the crystal structure of an intramembrane CAAX protease (Ras and a-factor converting enzyme 1 or Rce1) from the archaeon Methanococcus maripaludis. The structure of this novel intramembrane protease reveals a catalytic mechanism distinct from previously described examples such as rhomboids. This work could contribute to the development of antagonists of CAAX motif processing with the potential to disrupt Ras signalling pathways. CAAX proteins have essential roles in multiple signalling pathways, controlling processes such as proliferation, differentiation and carcinogenesis1. The ∼120 mammalian CAAX proteins function at cellular membranes and include the Ras superfamily of small GTPases, nuclear lamins, the γ-subunit of heterotrimeric GTPases, and several protein kinases and phosphatases2. The proper localization of CAAX proteins to cell membranes is orchestrated by a series of post-translational modifications of the carboxy-terminal CAAX motifs3 (where C is cysteine, A is an aliphatic amino acid and X is any amino acid). These reactions involve prenylation of the cysteine residue, cleavage at the AAX tripeptide and methylation of the carboxyl-prenylated cysteine residue. The major CAAX protease activity is mediated by Rce1 (Ras and a-factor converting enzyme 1), an intramembrane protease (IMP) of the endoplasmic reticulum4,5. Information on the architecture and proteolytic mechanism of Rce1 has been lacking. Here we report the crystal structure of a Methanococcus maripaludis homologue of Rce1, whose endopeptidase specificity for farnesylated peptides mimics that of eukaryotic Rce1. Its structure, comprising eight transmembrane α-helices, and catalytic site are distinct from those of other IMPs. The catalytic residues are located ∼10 Å into the membrane and are exposed to the cytoplasm and membrane through a conical cavity that accommodates the prenylated CAAX substrate. We propose that the farnesyl lipid binds to a site at the opening of two transmembrane α-helices, which results in the scissile bond being positioned adjacent to a glutamate-activated nucleophilic water molecule. This study suggests that Rce1 is the founding member of a novel IMP family, the glutamate IMPs."
https://openalex.org/W2062987318,"Trends in streamflow timing and volume in the Pacific Northwest United States have been attributed to increased temperatures, because trends in precipitation at lower-elevation stations were negligible. We demonstrate that observed streamflow declines are probably associated with declines in mountain precipitation, revealing previously unexplored differential trends. Lower-troposphere winter (November to March) westerlies are strongly correlated with high-elevation precipitation but weakly correlated with low-elevation precipitation. Decreases in lower-tropospheric winter westerlies across the region from 1950 to 2012 are hypothesized to have reduced orographic precipitation enhancement, yielding differential trends in precipitation across elevations and contributing to the decline in annual streamflow. Climate projections show weakened lower-troposphere zonal flow across the region under enhanced greenhouse forcing, highlighting an additional stressor that is relevant for climate change impacts on hydrology."

https://openalex.org/W1965009739,"Kinase inhibitors are important cancer drugs, but they tend to display limited target specificity, and their target profiles are often challenging to rationalize in terms of molecular mechanism. Here we report that the clinical kinase inhibitor bosutinib recognizes its kinase targets by engaging a pair of conserved structured water molecules in the active site and that many other kinase inhibitors share a similar recognition mechanism. Using the nitrile group of bosutinib as an infrared probe, we show that the gatekeeper residue and one other position in the ATP-binding site control access of the drug to the structured water molecules and that the amino acids found at these positions account for the kinome-wide target spectrum of the drug. Our work highlights the importance of structured water molecules for inhibitor recognition, reveals a new role for the kinase gatekeeper and showcases an effective approach for elucidating the molecular origins of selectivity patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2031058047,"Misfolded proteins of the secretory pathway are extracted from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), polyubiquitylated by a protein complex termed the Hmg-CoA reductase degradation ligase (HRD ligase) and degraded by cytosolic 26S proteasomes. The movement of these proteins through the lipid bilayer is assumed to occur via a protein-conducting channel of unknown nature. We show that the integral membrane protein Der1 oligomerizes, which relies on its interaction with the scaffolding protein Usa1. Mutations in the transmembrane domains of Der1 block the passage of soluble proteins across the ER membrane. As determined by site-specific photocrosslinking, the ER-luminal exposed parts of Der1 are in spatial proximity to the substrate receptor Hrd3, whereas the membrane-embedded domains reside adjacent to the ubiquitin ligase Hrd1. Intriguingly, both regions also form crosslinks to client proteins. Our data imply that Der1 initiates the export of aberrant polypeptides from the ER lumen by threading such molecules into the ER membrane and routing them to Hrd1 for ubiquitylation."
https://openalex.org/W1966819064,"Snail1 (Snail) and Snail2 (Slug) are transcription factors that share a similar DNA binding structure of four and five C2H2 zinc finger motifs (ZF), respectively. Both factors bind specifically to a subset of E-box motifs (E2-box: CAGGTG/CACCTG) in target promoters like the E-cadherin promoter and are key mediators of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, there are differences in the biological actions, in binding affinities to E-cadherin promoter, and in the target genes of Snail1 and Snail2, although the molecular bases are presently unknown. In particular, the role of each Snail1 and Snail2 ZF in the binding to E-boxes and in EMT induction has not been previously explored. We have approached this question by modeling Snail1 and Snail2 protein-DNA interactions and through mutational and functional assays of different ZFs. Results show that Snail1 efficient repression and binding to human and mouse E-cadherin promoter as well as EMT-inducing ability require intact ZF1 and ZF2, while for Snail2, either ZF3 or ZF4 is essential for those functions. Furthermore, the differential distribution of E2-boxes in mouse and human E-cadherin promoters also contributes to the differential Snail factor activity. These data indicate a non-equivalent role of Snail1 and Snail2 ZFs in gene repression, contributing to the elucidation of the molecular differences between these important EMT regulators.

The mouse and human CDH1 promoters have three proximal E2-boxes with a differential distribution: the mouse promoter contains two adjacent E1- and E2-boxes in a palindromic element, called E-pal (−70 to −90) and E3-box (−30), whereas the human promoter lacks the E2-box and has an additional E4-box after the transcription start point (28Peinado H.

Snail1 and Snail2 not only directly repress epithelial gene promoters, but also activate the expression of mesenchymal genes, like vimentin, fibronectin, and N-cadherin through indirect mechanisms not yet well understood (30Stanisavljevic J.

Nevertheless, and despite the high homology in their DNA binding and SNAG domains, Snail1 and Snail2 induce common and differential gene expression patterns when overexpressed in epithelial cells (31Moreno-Bueno G.

The molecular bases for the distinct regulation and binding affinity of downstream target genes by Snail1 and Snail2 are still largely unknown. To get insights into this relevant issue, we have investigated in detail the participation of the Snail1 and Snail2 DBD domain to determine which zinc fingers are essential for their repression activity in human and mouse E-cadherin and human claudin-1 promoters. To this end, we developed a computational model that predicts the consequences of mutation in specific Snail1 and Snail2 ZFs in their interaction with the DNA. The specific Snail1 and Snail2 mutants, in which the structure of individual zinc fingers was modified by point mutation, were analyzed for repression activity, DNA binding, and EMT induction. We show that Snail1 and Snail2 ZFs are not functionally equivalent, and identify for the first time the specific ZFs required for repression, DNA binding, and EMT induction by each Snail factor. Our results thus contribute to the knowledge of the molecular bases behind the differential action of Snail1 and Snail2, opening new avenues into the regulation of EMT and other essential processes by both factors. To analyze the zinc finger-DNA sequence recognition, a three-dimensional model of Snail1 and Snail2 was developed using homology modeling. The amino acid sequence of the proteins was retrieved from the NCBI database (Gene ID: 20613 and 20583). Afterward, the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) was used to perform a search for the closest homologue with an available three-dimensional structure in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Results indicate that a six zinc finger protein (PDB code 2I13) was a suitable template for modeling with 41% sequence identity. Homology modeling of the target was carried out by the automated server CPH model v3.0 (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/CPHmodels/). Then, the model was validated using PROCHECK, to obtain the Ramachandran plot, and ERRAT. Finally, the structure was relaxed using an energy minimization protocol of 2000 steps of steepest descent and 1000 steps of Polak-Ribiere conjugate gradients with the AMBER 99sb force field. These calculations were performed with the GROMACS 4.5 package. The DNA sequence of the template protein was manually mutated to resemble the possible recognition pattern of the E2-box sequence CAGGTG and adjusted to the model. Then, a new minimization protocol, homologous to the first one, was carried out. Finally, protein-DNA interactions were described using the molecular viewer PyMOL. Mutants of each Snail1 and Snail2 ZF have been generated by point mutation from the pcDNA3-mSnail1, pcDNA3-mSnail1-HA and pcDNA3-mSnail2-HA plasmids, previously generated in our group (25Cano A.

An efficient one-step site-directed and site-saturation mutagenesis protocol.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e115Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Due to the high degree of identity between human and mouse Snail1 (96% identity) and Snail2 (100% identity) ZFs we restricted this study to the mouse proteins. The mutation consists of the substitution of the first cysteine of each ZF by alanine that avoids the formation of the zinc finger tri-dimensional structure. The specific C to A mutants correspond to Snail1: ZF1 (C156A), ZF2 (C182A), ZF3 (C210A), and ZF4 (C238A); and to Snail2: ZF1 (C131A), ZF2 (C162A), ZF3 (C188A), ZF4 (C216A), and ZF5 (C244A). Combined mutations of Snail1 were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis using pcDNA3-mSnail1 as a template. Oligonucleotide sequences for each mutation will be provided upon request. After mutagenesis and subcloning, the entire Snail2-HA and Snail1 cDNAs were sequenced to verify that only the nucleotide changes introduced by the mutagenic oligonucleotides were obtained.

https://openalex.org/W2061093963,"Sensory perception can modulate aging and physiology across taxa. We found that perception of female sexual pheromones through a specific gustatory receptor expressed in a subset of foreleg neurons in male fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, rapidly and reversibly decreases fat stores, reduces resistance to starvation, and limits life span. Neurons that express the reward-mediating neuropeptide F are also required for pheromone effects. High-throughput whole-genome RNA sequencing experiments revealed a set of molecular processes that were affected by the activity of the longevity circuit, thereby identifying new candidate cell-nonautonomous aging mechanisms. Mating reversed the effects of pheromone perception; therefore, life span may be modulated through the integrated action of sensory and reward circuits, and healthy aging may be compromised when the expectations defined by sensory perception are discordant with ensuing experience."
https://openalex.org/W2136329519,"Three-quarters of the oceanic crust formed at fast-spreading ridges is composed of plutonic rocks whose mineral assemblages, textures and compositions record the history of melt transport and crystallization between the mantle and the sea floor. Despite the importance of these rocks, sampling them in situ is extremely challenging owing to the overlying dykes and lavas. This means that models for understanding the formation of the lower crust are based largely on geophysical studies and ancient analogues (ophiolites) that did not form at typical mid-ocean ridges. Here we describe cored intervals of primitive, modally layered gabbroic rocks from the lower plutonic crust formed at a fast-spreading ridge, sampled by the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program at the Hess Deep rift. Centimetre-scale, modally layered rocks, some of which have a strong layering-parallel foliation, confirm a long-held belief that such rocks are a key constituent of the lower oceanic crust formed at fast-spreading ridges. Geochemical analysis of these primitive lower plutonic rocks--in combination with previous geochemical data for shallow-level plutonic rocks, sheeted dykes and lavas--provides the most completely constrained estimate of the bulk composition of fast-spreading oceanic crust so far. Simple crystallization models using this bulk crustal composition as the parental melt accurately predict the bulk composition of both the lavas and the plutonic rocks. However, the recovered plutonic rocks show early crystallization of orthopyroxene, which is not predicted by current models of melt extraction from the mantle and mid-ocean-ridge basalt differentiation. The simplest explanation of this observation is that compositionally diverse melts are extracted from the mantle and partly crystallize before mixing to produce the more homogeneous magmas that erupt."

Here, we report that CRL4B is associated with histone methyltransferase SUV39H1, heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) and DNA methyltransferases 3A (DNMT3A). We showed that CRL4B, through catalyzing H2AK119 monoubiquitination, facilitates H3K9 tri-methylation and DNA methylation, two key epigenetic modifications involved in DNA methylation-based gene silencing. Depletion of CUL4B resulted in loss of not only H2AK119 monoubiquitination but also H3K9 trimethylation and DNA methylation, leading to derepression of a collection of genes, including the tumor suppressor IGFBP3. We demonstrated that CUL4B promotes cell proliferation and invasion, which are consistent with a tumorigenic phenotype, at least partially by repressing IGFBP3. We found that the expression of CUL4B is markedly upregulated in samples of human cervical carcinoma and is negatively correlated with the expression of IGFBP3. Our experiments unveiled a coordinated action between histone ubiquitination/methylation and DNA methylation in transcription repression, providing a mechanism for CUL4B in tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2004273376,"Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) continues to pose a significant clinical challenge with new generation second-line hormonal therapies affording limited improvement in disease outcome. As the androgen receptor (AR) remains a critical driver in CRPC, understanding the determinants of its transcriptional activity is important for developing new AR-targeted therapies. FOXA1 is a key component of the AR transcriptional complex yet its role in prostate cancer progression and the relationship between AR and FOXA1 are not completely resolved. It is well established that FOXA1 levels are elevated in advanced prostate cancer and metastases. We mimicked these conditions by overexpressing FOXA1 in the androgen-responsive LNCaP prostate cancer cell line and observed a significant increase in AR genomic binding at novel regions that possess increased chromatin accessibility. High levels of FOXA1 resulted in increased proliferation at both sub-optimal and high 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) concentrations. Immunohistochemical staining for FOXA1 in a clinical prostate cancer cohort revealed that high FOXA1 expression is associated with shorter time to biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy (hazard ratio (HR) 5.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2–21.1, P=0.028), positive surgical margins and higher stage disease at diagnosis. The gene expression program that results from FOXA1 overexpression is enriched for PTEN, Wnt and other pathways typically represented in CRPC gene signatures. Together, these results suggest that in an androgen-depleted state, elevated levels of FOXA1 enhance AR binding at genomic regions not normally occupied by AR, which in turn facilitates prostate cancer cell growth."

https://openalex.org/W2059438942,"The authors show, in mice, that maternal tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) genotype affects postnatal phenotypes in adult offspring. Lack of either one or two copies of the Tnf gene in dams led to reduced levels of chemokines in their milk, increased levels of adult hippocampal neurogenesis and improved spatial memory in offspring. Tumor necrosis factor α (TNF) is a proinflammatory cytokine with established roles in host defense and immune system organogenesis. We studied TNF function and found a previously unidentified physiological function that extends its effect beyond the host into the developing offspring. A partial or complete maternal TNF deficit, specifically in hematopoietic cells, resulted in reduced milk levels of the chemokines IP-10, MCP-1, MCP-3, MCP-5 and MIP-1β, which in turn augmented offspring postnatal hippocampal proliferation, leading to improved adult spatial memory in mice. These effects were reproduced by the postpartum administration of a clinically used anti-TNF agent. Chemokines, fed to suckling pups of TNF-deficient mothers, restored both postnatal proliferation and spatial memory to normal levels. Our results identify a TNF-dependent 'lactrocrine' pathway that programs offspring hippocampal development and memory. The level of ambient TNF is known to be downregulated by physical activity, exercise and adaptive stress. We propose that the maternal TNF–milk chemokine pathway evolved to promote offspring adaptation to post-weaning environmental challenges and competition."
https://openalex.org/W2085363874,"The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is commonly hyperactivated in cancer. One mechanism by which this occurs is by silencing of the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), a tumor suppressor and major antagonist of the pathway, through genetic, epigenetic or posttranscriptional mechanisms. Here, we used an unbiased siRNA screen in non-small-cell lung cancer cells to identify deubiquitylases (DUBs) that have an impact on PI3K signaling by regulating the abundance of PTEN. We found that PTEN expression was induced by depleting any of three members of the Josephin family DUBs: ataxin 3 (ATXN3), ataxin 3-like (ATXN3L) and Josephin domain containing 1 (JOSD1). However, this effect is not mediated through altered PTEN protein stability. Instead, depletion of each DUB increases expression of both the PTEN transcript and its competing endogenous RNA, PTENP1. In ATXN3-depleted cells, under conditions of transcriptional inhibition, PTEN and PTENP1 mRNAs rapidly decay, suggesting that ATXN3 acts primarily by repressing their transcription. Importantly, the PTEN induction observed in response to ATXN3 siRNA is sufficient to downregulate Akt phosphorylation and hence PI3K signaling. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) have been suggested as potential mediators of PTEN transcriptional reactivation in non-small-cell lung cancer. Although PTEN exhibits a very limited response to the broad-spectrum HDACi Vorinostat (SAHA) in A549 cells, we find that combination with ATXN3 depletion enhances PTEN induction in an additive manner. Similarly, these interventions additively decrease cell viability. Thus, ATXN3 provides an autonomous, complementary therapeutic target in cancers with epigenetic downregulation of PTEN."
https://openalex.org/W2162608576,"Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is one of the most frequently mutated tumor suppressor genes in cancers. PTEN has a central role in phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) signaling and converts PIP3 to phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate at the plasma membrane. Despite its importance, the mechanism that mediates membrane localization of PTEN is poorly understood. Here, we generated a library that contains green fluorescent protein fused to randomly mutated human PTEN and expressed the library in Dictyostelium cells. Using live cell imaging, we identified mutations that enhance the association of PTEN with the plasma membrane. These mutations were located in four separate regions, including the phosphatase catalytic site, the calcium-binding region 3 (CBR3) loop, the Cα2 loop and the C-terminal tail phosphorylation site. The phosphatase catalytic site, the CBR3 loop and the Cα2 loop formed the membrane-binding regulatory interface and interacted with the inhibitory phosphorylated C-terminal tail. Furthermore, we showed that membrane recruitment of PTEN is required for PTEN function in cells. Thus, heterologous expression system in Dictyostelium cells provides mechanistic and functional insight into membrane localization of PTEN."

Very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) is a member of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family. By opposition to LDLR, VLDLR is highly expressed in adipose tissue, heart, and skeletal muscles but is virtually absent in liver. It binds apolipoprotein E-(apoE) triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, enhances LPL activity (12Yagyu H. Lutz E.P. Kako Y. Marks S. Hu Y. Choi S.Y. Bensadoun A. Goldberg I.J.

Recently, we reported that VLDLR expression is virtually undetectable in preadipocytes but increases gradually with differentiation to reach a maximum in mature adipocytes (14Tao H. Aakula S. Abumrad N.N. Hajri T. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ regulates the expression and function of very-low density lipoprotein receptor.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol.

In addition to adipocytes, VLDLR is also expressed in immune cells, including macrophages (22Chen X. Guo Z. Okoro E.U. Zhang H. Zhou L. Lin X. Rollins A.T. Yang H.

In this study, we investigated the role of VLDLR in obesity-related adipose tissue inflammation and adipocyte-macrophage interaction. Wild type (WT) and VLDLR-null (vldlr−/−) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Six-week-old sex-matched mice were fed obesogenic high fat diet (36%, w/w, adjusted calories from fat, Bio-Serv S3282) for 16 weeks. All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, performed at Vanderbilt University and Hackensack University Medical Center, AAALAC-accredited facilities, and the investigation followed the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National Institutes of Health. Nonesterified fatty acids and triacylglycerols were assayed using kits from Wako (Richmond, VA) and Thermo Scientific (Middletown, VA), respectively. Fasting insulin was measured with the ultrasensitive mouse insulin ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). The levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in culture medium were tested by ELISA procedures (RayBiotech, Norcross, GA). Macrophage attractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and leptin levels were measured by ELISA kits (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN). Procedures were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (24Hajri T. Tao H. Wattacheril J. Marks-Shulman P. Abumrad N.N. Regulation of adiponectin production by insulin: interactions with tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2011; 300: E350-E360Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For glucose tolerance test (GTT), mice were fasted overnight and injected intraperitoneally with 2 mg of glucose/g of body weight. Tail vein blood glucose was measured at the indicated time using a One-Touch basic glucometer (25Hajri T. Han X.X. Bonen A. Abumrad N.A. Defective fatty acid uptake modulates insulin responsiveness and metabolic responses to diet in CD36-null mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1381-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). For insulin tolerance test (ITT), mice were fasted for 4 h prior to intraperitoneal injection of insulin (0.75 units/kg). Blood glucose level was tested at the indicated time points. Samples of epididymal white adipose tissue were fixed by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer. Five-micrometer-thick serial sections were obtained from paraffin-embedded tissues. To assess adipose tissue morphology, sections were stained by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) as described elsewhere (26Ueda Y. Hajri T. Peng D. Marks-Shulman P.A. Tamboli R.A. Shukrallah B. Saliba J. Jabbour K. El-Rifai W. Abumrad N.A. Abumrad N.N.

Fat cell size estimation was based on ×100 magnification of histological sections images (Zeiss digital camera, New York). Images were converted into a binary format with ImageJ (version 1.47, National Institutes of Health) and compared with the original images to ensure an accurate conversion. A total of 500 cells was measured in five different fields from four mice. The data were first averaged per section and then per animal. The distribution of adipocyte size was determined by relative frequencies of adipocytes having a size within a regular interval. Other sections were used for immunostaining of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) using specific marker F4/80 according to the procedure described by Ueda et al. (26Ueda Y. Hajri T. Peng D. Marks-Shulman P.A. Tamboli R.A. Shukrallah B. Saliba J. Jabbour K. El-Rifai W. Abumrad N.A. Abumrad N.N. Reduction of 8-iso-prostaglandin F2α in the first week after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery.Obesity. 2011; 19: 1663-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, sections were incubated overnight (4 °C) with anti-mouse F4/80 primary antibody (1:100; Serotec) followed by the application of biotinylated HRP-conjugated rat anti-goat IgG secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Primary antibody was omitted from negative controls. Positive controls were also used to test the antibody specificity. Histochemical reactions were performed using the EnVision Doublestain System (Dako Cytomation) and counterstained with hematoxylin. Sections were examined with light microscopy, and digital images were used to evaluate macrophage contents (8Cinti S. Mitchell G. Barbatelli G. Murano I. Ceresi E. Faloia E. Wang S. Fortier M.

Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 2347-2355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1761) Google Scholar). The number of crown-like structures (CLS) was determined in five different ×100 magnified fields from four mice per group. Data were expressed as number of crown-like structures per low power field (CLS/LPF). For immunofluorescence staining of macrophages, sections were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-CD11c (BD Biosciences) followed by the application of appropriate secondary antibody. Stained sections were examined under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX51, Goettingen, Germany). All procedures for cultures of adipose tissue explants were carried out using a sterile technique as described earlier (27Hajri T. Hall A.M. Jensen D.R. Pietka T.A. Drover V.A. Tao H. Eckel R. Abumrad N.A. CD36-facilitated fatty acid uptake inhibits leptin production and signaling in adipose tissue.Diabetes. 2007; 56: 1872-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Epididymal fat from WT and vldlr−/− mice fed a high fat diet was minced and washed with HEPES/salts buffer. Then, ∼500-mg samples were placed in 2 ml of serum-free M199 medium with 1% BSA under 95:5 O2/CO2 with daily medium replenishment (27Hajri T. Hall A.M. Jensen D.R. Pietka T.A. Drover V.A. Tao H.

Medium was collected from explant cultures to test chemokine secretion using ELISA kits and free fatty acid release using an enzymatic kit (25Hajri T. Han X.X. Bonen A. Abumrad N.A. Defective fatty acid uptake modulates insulin responsiveness and metabolic responses to diet in CD36-null mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1381-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Isolation of adipocytes and adipose tissue stromal vascular fraction (SVF) was performed according to our previous procedure (14Tao H. Aakula S. Abumrad N.N. Hajri T.

Tissue suspensions were rinsed with PBS to remove erythrocytes and free cells. Then, tissue pieces were digested in Krebs buffer containing 1 mg/ml type I collagenase (Worthington) and 1% fatty acid-free BSA (Sigma) for 20 min at 37 °C with shaking. The suspension was filtered through a sterile 100-μm nylon mesh and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min. After centrifugation, buoyant adipocytes were isolated, washed twice with Krebs-Ringer HEPES (KRH) buffer, and collected as the adipocyte fraction. The remaining pellet representing the SVF was washed three times with Krebs buffer and further incubated with red blood cell lysis buffer to remove red blood cells. This fraction was used to test gene expression by qPCR and macrophage-specific marker expression with flow cytometry. After washing, cells of the SVF were resuspended in 300 μl of staining buffer (PBS containing 2% FBS) containing FcBlock (BD Biosciences) and stained with conjugated antibodies, all on ice for 30 min and in the dark (9Nguyen M.T.

Antibodies used for staining surface antigens were CD11c-EP, F4/80-FITC (both from E-Bioscience, San Diego), and CD206-APC (BioLegend, San Diego). For each sample, triplicates of cell preparations were double-stained with CD11c-EP and F4/80-FITC or with CD206-APC and F4/80-FITC. The samples were then processed with an LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and data were analyzed using Cytopaint Classic software (Tree Star, Inc.). FSc-A/FSc-H gates were used to identify single cells. Fluorescence intensity of samples was normalized using isotype control antibodies, and cells were incubated in the absence of conjugated antibodies. Live cells were identified with propidium iodide staining (Invitrogen). Primary adipocytes were prepared from adipose tissue digest as described above. After washing, adipocyte fractions were examined by microscopy to ensure proper isolation and cell count numbers before experiments. Glucose uptake was measured using tritiated 2-deoxyglucose as described previously (28Bastie C.C. Hajri T. Drover V.A. Grimaldi P.A. Abumrad N.A. CD36 in myocytes channels fatty acids to a lipase-accessible triglyceride pool that is related to cell lipid and insulin responsiveness.Diabetes. 2004; 53: 2209-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, freshly isolated adipocytes were incubated in Krebs-Ringer phosphate (KRP) buffer (136 mmol/liter NaCl, 4.5 mmol/liter KCl, 1.25 mmol/liter CaCl2, 1.25 mmol/liter MgCl2, 0.6 mmol/liter Na2HPO4, 0.4 mmol/liter NaH2PO4, 10 mmol/liter HEPES, and 0.1% BSA) at 37 °C for 20 min with or without insulin (100 μm). Then 10 μl of KRP containing 0.25 mmol/liter unlabeled 2-deoxyglucose and 0.1 μCi of tritiated 2-deoxyglucose (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to each preparation, and incubation was continued for another 10 min. Cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 0.1 m NaOH. Radioactivity was counted in scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and corrected using unlabeled cell blanks. Peritoneal macrophages (PM) were harvested from high fat diet-fed WT and vldlr−/− mice by lavaging the peritoneal cavity with PBS (29Saraswathi V. Hasty A.H.

Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 1406-1415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Macrophages were then plated on 12-well plates (1.5 × 106 cells per well) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. Four hours after plating, cells were washed three times with PBS to remove the nonadherent cells. Adherent cells were then incubated for an additional 48 h at 37 °C before treatment. Migration of PM was measured in a modified Boyden chamber migration assay using Transwell inserts with an 8 μm porous membrane (Corning) as described by Patsouris et al. (30Patsouris D. Neels J.G. Fan W. Li P.P. Nguyen M.T. Olefsky J.M. Glucocorticoids and thiazolidinediones interfere with adipocyte-mediated macrophage chemotaxis and recruitment.J. Biol.

To compare the chemotactic effects of adipose tissues of WT and vldlr−/− mice, conditional medium was prepared from adipose tissue explants cultured for 24 h in M199 medium as described above (27Hajri T. Hall A.M. Jensen D.R. Pietka T.A. Drover V.A. Tao H. Eckel R. Abumrad N.A. CD36-facilitated fatty acid uptake inhibits leptin production and signaling in adipose tissue.Diabetes. 2007; 56: 1872-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Cells were loaded into the migration chamber and conditional medium from WT (CMWT) or vldlr−/− (CMvldrko) adipose tissues were loaded in the lower chamber. After allowing cell migration for 16 h, cells were removed from the upper side of the membranes, and nuclei of migratory cells on the lower side of the membrane were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The nuclei were visualized by fluorescence microscopy, and the average number of migratory cells was determined from averaging four fields (30Patsouris D. Neels J.G. Fan W. Li P.P. Nguyen M.T.

Buoyant VLDL particles (d <1.006 g/ml) were isolated form pooled plasma of WT mice fed high fat diet by ultracentrifugation (31Hajri T. Khosla P. Pronczuk A. Hayes K.C. Myristic acid-rich fat raises plasma LDL by stimulating LDL production without affecting fractional clearance in gerbils fed a cholesterol-free diet.J. Nutr. 1998; 128: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). VLDL preparation was extensively dialyzed and diluted in PBS and then protein and triglyceride concentrations were measured (31Hajri T. Khosla P. Pronczuk A. Hayes K.C. Myristic acid-rich fat raises plasma LDL by stimulating LDL production without affecting fractional clearance in gerbils fed a cholesterol-free diet.J. Nutr. 1998; 128: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Fatty acid composition of VLDL lipids was determined by gas liquid chromatography (GLC) according to the one-step transesterification procedure as described elsewhere (31Hajri T. Khosla P. Pronczuk A. Hayes K.C. Myristic acid-rich fat raises plasma LDL by stimulating LDL production without affecting fractional clearance in gerbils fed a cholesterol-free diet.J. Nutr. 1998; 128: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). VLDL preparations were used within a period of 24 h. To test if VLDLR deficiency modulates the effects of VLDL on macrophages, we challenged peritoneal macrophages collected from WT and vldlr−/− mice with VLDL. Accordingly, macrophages seeded in 12-well plates were treated with 0, 50, 100, or 200 μg/ml VLDL based on triglyceride concentration. Cells were then incubated for a period of 24 h after which cells were used to examine lipid contents. Cells were fixed with 4% formalin and then stained for 30 min with LipidTOX (Invitrogen) for neutral lipids followed by DAPI for nucleus staining. Cells were then examined with fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX51) equipped with Olympus C-3030 digital Olympus camera. Additional incubations were used to collect the cells in lysis buffer for triglyceride quantification with enzymatic kits (Wako) o"

https://openalex.org/W2021484273,"Microbial degradation of plant cell walls is a central component of the carbon cycle and is of increasing importance in environmentally significant industries. Plant cell wall-degrading enzymes have a complex molecular architecture consisting of catalytic modules and, frequently, multiple non-catalytic carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs). It is currently unclear whether the specificities of the CBMs or the topology of the catalytic modules are the primary drivers for the specificity of these enzymes against plant cell walls. Here, we have evaluated the relationship between CBM specificity and their capacity to enhance the activity of GH5 and GH26 mannanases and CE2 esterases against intact plant cell walls. The data show that cellulose and mannan binding CBMs have the greatest impact on the removal of mannan from tobacco and Physcomitrella cell walls, respectively. Although the action of the GH5 mannanase was independent of the context of mannan in tobacco cell walls, a significant proportion of the polysaccharide was inaccessible to the GH26 enzyme. The recalcitrant mannan, however, was fully accessible to the GH26 mannanase appended to a cellulose binding CBM. Although CE2 esterases display similar specificities against acetylated substrates in vitro, only CjCE2C was active against acetylated mannan in Physcomitrella. Appending a mannan binding CBM27 to CjCE2C potentiated its activity against Physcomitrella walls, whereas a xylan binding CBM reduced the capacity of esterases to deacetylate xylan in tobacco walls. This work provides insight into the biological significance for the complex array of hydrolytic enzymes expressed by plant cell wall-degrading microorganisms."

As a putative tumor-suppressor protein, p21waf1/cip1 influences cell proliferation by inhibiting the activity of cyclin–cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complexes at the G1/S and G2/M cell cycle checkpoints. HDACi transcriptionally activate CDKN1A, and it has been proposed that induction of p21waf1/cip1 can determine if a cell undergoes apoptosis or cell cycle arrest following HDACi treatment. In the Eμ-myc transgenic mouse model of B-cell lymphoma, knockout of cdkn1a had no effect on disease latency, indicating that p21waf1/cip1 did not function as a tumor suppressor in this system. Although HDACi robustly induced expression of p21waf1/cip1 in wild-type Eμ-myc lymphomas, deletion of cdkn1a did not sensitize the lymphoma cells to HDACi-induced apoptosis and HDACi-induced cell cycle arrest still occurred. However, knockdown of cdkn1b in cdkn1a knockout lymphomas resulted in defective vorinostat-mediated arrest at G1/S indicating an essential role of p27Kip1 in mediating this biological response to vorinostat. These data demonstrate that induction of cdkn1a does not regulate HDACi-mediated tumor cell apoptosis and refute the notion that p21waf1/cip1 is an obligate mediator of HDACi-induced cell cycle arrest."
https://openalex.org/W2092039518,"MUC1-C oncoprotein is associated with colon, breast, ovarian, lung and pancreatic cancers. MUC1-C interacts with intracellular proteins to elicit signaling cascades that induce cell proliferation and tumor growth. Here we report that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is an inhibitor of MUC1-C-mediated cell proliferation. PPARγ does so by binding to and inducing MUC1-C proteasome-dependent degradation that was independent of PPARγ transcriptional activity. Lys134 residue was found to be critically important for PPARγ-mediated MUC1-C degradation, as it terminated MUC1-C-mediated cell proliferation. These findings demonstrate PPARγ induces MUC1-C ubiquitination and degradation that is critical to terminate MUC1-C signaling pathway-elicited cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1981202925,"Phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins (PITPs) are important mediators of phosphoinositide signaling within cells. A small-molecule inhibitor of the PITP Sec14, identified by chemical screening and structure-based design, affects transit through the trans-Golgi network and endosomal system. Sec14-like phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins (PITPs) integrate diverse territories of intracellular lipid metabolism with stimulated phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate production and are discriminating portals for interrogating phosphoinositide signaling. Yet, neither Sec14-like PITPs nor PITPs in general have been exploited as targets for chemical inhibition for such purposes. Herein, we validate what is to our knowledge the first small-molecule inhibitors (SMIs) of the yeast PITP Sec14. These SMIs are nitrophenyl(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl)methanones (NPPMs) and are effective inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. We further establish that Sec14 is the sole essential NPPM target in yeast and that NPPMs exhibit exquisite targeting specificities for Sec14 (relative to related Sec14-like PITPs), propose a mechanism for how NPPMs exert their inhibitory effects and demonstrate that NPPMs exhibit exquisite pathway selectivity in inhibiting phosphoinositide signaling in cells. These data deliver proof of concept that PITP-directed SMIs offer new and generally applicable avenues for intervening with phosphoinositide signaling pathways with selectivities superior to those afforded by contemporary lipid kinase–directed strategies."
https://openalex.org/W1978413572,"The HSP90 molecular chaperone plays a key role in the maturation, stability and activation of its clients, including many oncogenic proteins. Kinases are a substantial and important subset of clients requiring the key cochaperone CDC37. We sought an improved understanding of protein kinase chaperoning by CDC37 in cancer cells. CDC37 overexpression in human colon cancer cells increased CDK4 protein levels, which was negated upon CDC37 knockdown. Overexpressing CDC37 increased CDK4 protein half-life and enhanced binding of HSP90 to CDK4, consistent with CDC37 promoting kinase loading onto chaperone complexes. Against expectation, expression of C-terminus-truncated CDC37 (ΔC-CDC37) that lacks HSP90 binding capacity did not affect kinase client expression or activity; moreover, as with wild-type CDC37 overexpression, it augmented CDK4-HSP90 complex formation. However, although truncation blocked binding to HSP90 in cells, ΔC-CDC37 also showed diminished client protein binding and was relatively unstable. CDC37 mutants with single and double point mutations at residues M164 and L205 showed greatly reduced binding to HSP90, but retained association with client kinases. Surprisingly, these mutants phenocopied wild-type CDC37 overexpression by increasing CDK4-HSP90 association and CDK4 protein levels in cells. Furthermore, expression of the mutants was sufficient to protect kinase clients CDK4, CDK6, CRAF and ERBB2 from depletion induced by silencing endogenous CDC37, indicating that CDC37’s client stabilising function cannot be inactivated by substantially reducing its direct interaction with HSP90. However, CDC37 could not compensate for loss of HSP90 function, showing that CDC37 and HSP90 have their own distinct and non-redundant roles in maintaining kinase clients. Our data substantiate the important function of CDC37 in chaperoning protein kinases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CDC37 can stabilise kinase clients by a mechanism that is not dependent on a substantial direct interaction between CDC37 and HSP90, but nevertheless requires HSP90 activity. These results have significant implications for therapeutic targeting of CDC37."
https://openalex.org/W2039041673,"Connexins (Cx) have been identified as tumor suppressors or enhancers, a distinction that appears to be dependent on the type and stage of disease. However, the role of connexins in melanoma tumorigenesis and their status during cancer onset and progression remain controversial and unclear. Here, we show that the aggressive B16-BL6 mouse melanoma cell line expresses low basal levels of Cx26 and Cx43, rendering them gap junctional intercellular communication-deficient as elucidated by immunofluorescence, Western blotting, and dye transfer studies. Following ectopic expression of green fluorescent protein-tagged Cx26 and Cx43 in these connexin-deficient melanomas, punctate gap junction-like plaques were evident at sites of cell-cell apposition, and the incidence of dye transfer was significantly increased similar to connexin-rich keratinocytes. We found that the expression of Cx43, but not Cx26, significantly reduced cellular proliferation and anchorage-independent growth from control melanomas, whereas migration was unaffected. Additionally, melanomas expressing Cx43 displayed significantly reduced growth within the in situ-like microenvironment of keratinocytes, despite a lack of heterocellular gap junctional intercellular communication between the two cell types. Furthermore, when grown in vivo in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane, primary tumors derived from Cx43-expressing melanomas were significantly smaller than controls, whereas Cx26-expressing melanomas produced tumors similar to controls. Collectively, these results suggest that Cx43, and not Cx26, can act as a tumor suppressor during melanoma tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2009778100,"Efforts to model human pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) in animals have been moderately successful, with minimal evidence for glucagonomas or metastatic spread. The renin gene, although classically associated with expression in the kidney, is also expressed in many other extrarenal tissues including the pancreas. To induce tumorigenesis within rennin-specific tissues, floxed alleles of p53 and Rb were selectively abrogated using Cre-recombinase driven by the renin promoter. The primary neoplasm generated is a highly metastatic islet cell carcinoma of the pancreas. Lineage tracing identifies descendants of renin-expressing cells as pancreatic alpha cells despite a lack of active renin expression in the mature pancreas. Both primary and metastatic tumors express high levels of glucagon; furthermore, an increased level of glucagon is found in the serum, identifying the pancreatic cancer as a functional glucagonoma. This new model is highly penetrant and exhibits robust frequency of metastases to the lymph nodes and the liver, mimicking human disease, and provides a useful platform for better understanding pancreatic endocrine differentiation and development, as well as islet cell carcinogenesis. The use of fluorescent reporters for lineage tracing of the cells contributing to disease initiation and progression provides an unique opportunity to dissect the timeline of disease, examining mechanisms of the metastatic process, as well as recovering primary and metastatic cells for identifying cooperating mutations that are necessary for progression of disease."
https://openalex.org/W2147326210,"The gold standard for determining the tumorigenic potential of human cancer cells is a xenotransplantation into immunodeficient mice. Higher tumorigenicity of cells is associated with earlier tumor onset. Here, we used xenotransplantation to assess the tumorigenic potential of human breast cancer cells following RNA interference-mediated inhibition of over 5000 genes. We identify 16 candidate tumor suppressors, one of which is the zinc-finger transcription factor SALL1. Analyzing this particular molecule in more detail, we show that inhibition of SALL1 correlates with reduced levels of CDH1, an important contributor to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Furthermore, SALL1 expression led to an increased migration and more than twice as many cells expressing a cancer stem cell signature. Also, SALL1 expression correlates with the survival of breast cancer patients. These findings cast new light on a gene that has previously been described to be relevant during embryogenesis, but not carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2064386991,"Neurotransmitter transporters of the SLC6 family of proteins, including the human serotonin transporter (hSERT), utilize Na(+), Cl(-), and K(+) gradients to induce conformational changes necessary for substrate translocation. Dysregulation of ion movement through monoamine transporters has been shown to impact neuronal firing potentials and could play a role in pathophysiologies, such as depression and anxiety. Despite multiple crystal structures of prokaryotic and eukaryotic SLC transporters indicating the location of both (or one) conserved Na(+)-binding sites (termed Na1 and Na2), much remains uncertain in regard to the movements and contributions of these cation-binding sites in the transport process. In this study, we utilize the unique properties of a mutation of hSERT at a single, highly conserved asparagine on TM1 (Asn-101) to provide several lines of evidence demonstrating mechanistically distinct roles for Na1 and Na2. Mutations at Asn-101 alter the cation dependence of the transporter, allowing Ca(2+) (but not other cations) to functionally replace Na(+) for driving transport and promoting 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-dependent conformational changes. Furthermore, in two-electrode voltage clamp studies in Xenopus oocytes, both Ca(2+) and Na(+) illicit 5-HT-induced currents in the Asn-101 mutants and reveal that, although Ca(2+) promotes substrate-induced current, it does not appear to be the charge carrier during 5-HT transport. These findings, in addition to functional evaluation of Na1 and Na2 site mutants, reveal separate roles for Na1 and Na2 and provide insight into initiation of the translocation process as well as a mechanism whereby the reported SERT stoichiometry can be obtained despite the presence of two putative Na(+)-binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W2034070474,"Human protein arginine N-methyltransferase 2 (PRMT2, HRMT1L1) is a protein that belongs to the arginine methyltransferase family, and it has diverse roles in transcriptional regulation through different mechanisms depending on its binding partners. In this study, we provide evidences for the negative effect of PRMT2 on breast cancer cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Morever, cyclin D1, one of the key modulators of cell cycle, was found to be downregulated by PRMT2, and PRMT2 was further shown to suppress the estrogen receptor α-binding affinity to the activator protein-1 (AP-1) site in cyclin D1 promoter through indirect binding with AP-1 site, resulting in the inhibition of cyclin D1 promoter activity in MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, a positive correlation between the expression of PRMT2 and cyclin D1 was confirmed in the breast cancer tissues by using tissue microarray assay. In addition, PRMT2 was found to show a high absent percentage in breast caner cell nuclei and the nuclear loss ratio of PRMT2 was demonstrated to positively correlate with cyclin D1 expression and the increasing tumor grade of invasive ductal carcinoma. Those results offer an essential insight into the effect of PRMT2 on breast carcinogenesis, and PRMT2 nuclear loss might be an important biological marker for the diagnosis of breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2067700675,"The A2A adenosine receptor (A2AR) is a G protein-coupled receptor and a major target of caffeine. The A2AR gene encodes alternative transcripts that are initiated from at least two independent promoters. The different transcripts of the A2AR gene contain the same coding region and 3'-untranslated region and different 5'-untranslated regions that are highly conserved among species. We report here that in addition to the production of the A2AR protein, translation from an upstream, out-of-frame AUG of the rat A2AR gene produces a 134-amino acid protein (designated uORF5). An anti-uORF5 antibody recognized a protein of the predicted size of uORF5 in PC12 cells and rat brains. Up-regulation of A2AR transcripts by hypoxia led to increased levels of both the A2AR and uORF5 proteins. Moreover, stimulation of A2AR increased the level of the uORF5 protein via post-transcriptional regulation. Expression of the uORF5 protein suppressed the AP1-mediated transcription promoted by nerve growth factor and modulated the expression of several proteins that were implicated in the MAPK pathway. Taken together, our results show that the rat A2AR gene encodes two distinct proteins (A2AR and uORF5) in an A2AR-dependent manner. Our study reveals a new example of the complexity of the mammalian genome and provides novel insights into the function of A2AR."
https://openalex.org/W2116734756,"Sialic acids (Sias) are often conjugated to the termini of cellular glycans and are key mediators of cellular recognition. Sias are nine-carbon acidic sugars, and, in vertebrates, the major species are N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), differing in structure at the C5 position. Previously, we described a positive feedback loop involving regulation of Neu5Gc expression in mouse B cells. In this context, Neu5Gc negatively regulated B-cell proliferation, and Neu5Gc expression was suppressed upon activation. Similarly, resting mouse T cells expressed principally Neu5Gc, and Neu5Ac was induced upon activation. In the present work, we used various probes to examine sialoglycan expression by activated T cells in terms of the Sia species expressed and the linkages of Sias to glycans. Upon T-cell activation, sialoglycan expression shifted from Neu5Gc to Neu5Ac, and the linkage shifted from α2,6 to α2,3. These changes altered the expression levels of sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (siglec) ligands. Expression of sialoadhesin and Siglec-F ligands increased, and that of CD22 ligands decreased. Neu5Gc exerted a negative effect on T-cell activation, both in terms of the proliferative response and in the context of activation marker expression. Suppression of Neu5Gc expression in mouse T and B cells prevented the development of nonspecific CD22-mediated T cell-B cell interactions. Our results suggest that an activation-dependent shift from Neu5Gc to Neu5Ac and replacement of α2,6 by α2,3 linkages may regulate immune cell interactions at several levels."
https://openalex.org/W1966981028,"The type III secretion system is a widespread apparatus used by pathogenic bacteria to inject effectors directly into the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. A key component of this highly conserved system is the translocon, a pore formed in the host membrane that is essential for toxins to bypass this last physical barrier. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa the translocon is composed of PopB and PopD, both of which before secretion are stabilized within the bacterial cytoplasm by a common chaperone, PcrH. In this work we characterize PopB, the major translocator, in both membrane-associated and PcrH-bound forms. By combining sucrose gradient centrifugation experiments, limited proteolysis, one-dimensional NMR, and β-lactamase reporter assays on eukaryotic cells, we show that PopB is stably inserted into bilayers with its flexible N-terminal domain and C-terminal tail exposed to the outside. In addition, we also report the crystal structure of the complex between PcrH and an N-terminal region of PopB (residues 51-59), which reveals that PopB lies within the concave face of PcrH, employing mostly backbone residues for contact. PcrH is thus the first chaperone whose structure has been solved in complex with both type III secretion systems translocators, revealing that both molecules employ the same surface for binding and excluding the possibility of formation of a ternary complex. The characterization of the major type III secretion system translocon component in both membrane-bound and chaperone-bound forms is a key step for the eventual development of antibacterials that block translocon assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1997238953,"Agents targeting the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) are in clinical development, but, despite some initial success of single agents in sarcoma, response rates are low with brief durations. Thus, it is important to identify markers predictive of response, to understand mechanisms of resistance, and to explore combination therapies. In this study, we found that, although associated with PAX3-FKHR translocation, increased IGF1R level is an independent prognostic marker for worse overall survival, particularly in patients with PAX3-FKHR-positive rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). IGF1R antibody-resistant RMS cells were generated using an in vivo model. Expression analysis indicated that IGFBP2 is both the most affected gene in the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway and the most significantly downregulated gene in the resistant lines, indicating that there is a strong selection to repress IGFBP2 expression in tumor cells resistant to IGF1R antibody. IGFBP2 is inhibitory to IGF1R phosphorylation and its signaling. Similar to antibodies to IGF1/2 or IGF2, the addition of exogenous IGFBP2 potentiates the activity of IGF1R antibody against the RMS cells, and it reverses the resistance to IGF1R antibody. In contrast to IGF1R, lower expression of IGFBP2 is associated with poorer overall survival, consistent with its inhibitory activity found in this study. Finally, blocking downstream Protein kinase B (AKT) activation with Phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases (PI3K)- or mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-specific inhibitors significantly sensitized the resistant cells to the IGF1R antibody. These findings show that constitutive IGFBP2 downregulation may represent a novel mechanism for acquired resistance to IGF1R therapeutic antibody in vivo and suggest various drug combinations to enhance antibody activity and to overcome resistance."

https://openalex.org/W1978560193,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is frequently linked to epigenetic abnormalities and deregulation of gene transcription, which lead to aberrant cell proliferation and accumulation of undifferentiated precursors. ZRF1, a recently characterized epigenetic factor involved in transcriptional regulation, is highly overexpressed in human AML, but it is not known whether it plays a role in leukemia progression. Here, we demonstrate that ZRF1 depletion decreases cell proliferation, induces apoptosis and enhances cell differentiation in human AML cells. Treatment with retinoic acid (RA), a differentiating agent currently used to treat certain AMLs, leads to a functional switch of ZRF1 from a negative regulator to an activator of differentiation. At the molecular level, ZRF1 controls the RA-regulated gene network through its interaction with the RA receptor α (RARα) and its binding to RA target genes. Our genome-wide expression study reveals that ZRF1 regulates the transcription of nearly half of RA target genes. Consistent with our in vitro observations that ZRF1 regulates proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation, ZRF1 depletion strongly inhibits leukemia progression in a xenograft mouse model. Finally, ZRF1 knockdown cooperates with RA treatment in leukemia suppression in vivo. Taken together, our data reveal that ZRF1 is a key transcriptional regulator in leukemia progression and suggest that ZRF1 inhibition could be a novel strategy to be explored for AML treatment."

Protein misfolding is toxic to cells and has numerous causes including heat, errors in translation, oxidation, genetic mutation, and aging. Heavy metals and metalloids (e.g. arsenic) are ubiquitous environmental toxins that cause protein misfolding by directly binding proteins and altering their structures. The recognition and elimination of these aberrant proteins is necessary for cell survival. The ubiquitin-proteasome system is the major pathway for selective protein degradation in eukaryotic cells (1Finley D. Ulrich H.D. Sommer T. Kaiser P. The ubiquitin-proteasome system of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 2012; 192: 319-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 2Varshavsky A. The ubiquitin system, an immense realm.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2012; 81: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Substrates requiring destruction by this system are covalently modified by the small protein ubiquitin, which serves as a recognition motif for the proteasome (3Matyskiela M.E. Martin A. Design principles of a universal protein degradation machine.J. Mol. Biol. 2013; 425: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). By harboring multiple enzymatic and non-enzymatic functionalities, the proteasome is able to recognize ubiquitinated substrates, and unfold, deubiquitinate, and proteolyze them into small peptides, while largely releasing ubiquitin for reuse. Prior to destruction by the proteasome, many substrates require additional processing by the homohexameric ATPase Cdc48 (p97 in higher organisms). Cdc48 has numerous cellular functions, many of which require its central role as a force-generating machine (4Buchberger A. Roles of cdc48 in regulated protein degradation in yeast.Subcell Biochem. 2013; 66: 195-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For example, Cdc48 can extract proteins from membranes, chromatin, or larger protein assemblies. Like the proteasome, Cdc48 interacts with numerous co-factors that endow it with multiple activities including ubiquitin binding, deubiquitination, and ubiquitination (5Stolz A. Hilt W. Buchberger A.

We describe here a new component of the ubiquitin system, Ynl155w, a zinc finger protein capable of directly interacting with the proteasome and Cdc48. Ynl155w is co-regulated with other elements of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and its absence markedly compromises survival upon exposure to metalloid toxicity. A second uncharacterized zinc finger protein, Yor052c, shows similar phenotypic properties, suggesting a multicomponent stress response pathway. Ynl155w functions as a zinc-dependent ubiquitin-binding protein, suggesting the hypothesis that Ynl155w protects cells from metalloid toxicity by delivering ubiquitinated proteins to Cdc48 and the proteasome for destruction.

Ubiquitin (Santa Cruz), T7 (Novagen), GST (Santa Cruz), and Pgk1 (Invitrogen) antibodies were commercially available. We previously identified Spg5 as a novel regulator of the proteasome under conditions of nutrient starvation (7Hanna J. Waterman D. Boselli M. Finley D.

During that work, we isolated proteasomes from quiescent wild-type and spg5Δ cells using an affinity purification technique (6Leggett D.S. Hanna J. Borodovsky A. Crosas B. Schmidt M. Baker R.T.

We visualized proteolytically active species using the fluorogenic substrate suc-LLVY-AMC (Fig. 1A), and proteolytically inactive species by immunoblot (7Hanna J. Waterman D. Boselli M. Finley D.

To identify components of each proteasome subcomplex, we excised individual native gel bands and analyzed them by mass spectrometry. Within spg5Δ proteasomes, but not those of wild-type, we obtained three unique peptides (four in total) from the protein Ynl155w, now known as Cuz1 (Fig. 1B). Two of the peptides were derived from the RP2CP species (Fig. 1A), and two from the RP species (data not shown). Ynl155w is a 32-kDa protein that contains an AN1-type zinc finger domain at its N terminus.

We began by confirming the association of Ynl155w with the proteasome. We isolated proteasomes from wild-type cells growing logarithmically, and challenged them with recombinant, purified Ynl155w. We were able to detect binding of Ynl155w to proteasomes, whereas there was no binding to beads alone (Fig. 1C). Thus, Ynl155w can interact, at least in vitro, with proteasomes from growing as well as quiescent cells. The proteasome is a 2.5-MDa complex composed of 33 distinct subunits, and can be divided into two subcomplexes: the 28-subunit core particle (CP), which houses the proteolytic active sites, and the 19-subunit regulatory particle (RP), which is thought to recognize, unfold, and deubiquitinate substrates (3Matyskiela M.E. Martin A. Design principles of a universal protein degradation machine.J. Mol. Biol. 2013; 425: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The RP can be subdivided into two complexes: base and lid. Using affinity tags on CP, base, and lid subunits, we purified all four proteasome subcomplexes, and again challenged them with Ynl155w. Binding was observed with the RP but not the CP (Fig. 1D). Within the RP, Ynl155w bound to the base but not the lid. The base includes six ATPases (Rpt1–6) as well as two larger related proteins Rpn1 and Rpn2, which show ∼40% sequence identity (12Rosenzweig R. Bronner V. Zhang D. Fushman D. Glickman M.H. Rpn1 and Rpn2 coordinate ubiquitin processing factors at proteasome.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 14659-14671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To test whether Rpn1 or Rpn2 could serve as a receptor for Ynl155w, we isolated recombinant full-length GST-tagged Rpn1 and Rpn2 on resin and challenged these resins with Ynl155w. Binding was detected with GST-Rpn2, but not with GST-Rpn1 or GST alone (Fig. 1E). We were unable to exclude a secondary binding site within one of the six ATPases because of an inability to purify these proteins from bacteria. These results indicate that Ynl155w is a proteasome-associated protein, and specifically recognizes the Rpn2 subunit present within the RP and the base subcomplexes. Proteome-wide protein interaction studies suggested that Ynl155w might also interact with the homohexameric ATPase Cdc48 (13Krogan N.J. Cagney G. Yu H. Zhong G. Guo X. Ignatchenko A. Li J. Pu S. Datta N. Tikuisis A.P. Punna T. Peregrín-Alvarez J.M. Shales M. Zhang X. Davey M. Robinson M.D. Paccanaro A. Bray J.E. Sheung A. Beattie B. Richards D.P. Canadien V. Lalev A. Mena F. Wong P.

Global landscape of protein complexes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Nature. 2006; 440: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (2331) Google Scholar). This was of interest as Cdc48, among other roles, is known to function within the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. To test this possible association, we isolated Cdc48 from yeast cells using a genomically encoded, TAP-tagged Cdc48. Because Cdc48 can associate with a host of factors, we used stringent wash conditions to strip away as many interacting proteins as possible. We then challenged this resin with GST or GST-Ynl155w. We were able to detect binding to GST-Ynl155w, but not GST (Fig. 2A). Indeed, evaluation of the eluates indicated a Coomassie-stainable band for GST-Ynl155w, indicative of strong binding. To confirm that this binding was direct, we utilized purified recombinant His12- and Sumo-tagged Cdc48 that had been expressed in E. coli. Ynl155w retained the capacity to bind recombinant Cdc48 (Fig. 2B). Thus, Ynl155w is both a proteasome- and a Cdc48-interacting protein. The ability of Ynl155w to interact with both the proteasome and Cdc48 suggested three models for its function: 1) Ynl155w might bring proteasome and Cdc48 together in a stable ternary complex; 2) Ynl155w might have completely separate functions within the two complexes; and 3) Ynl155w might integrate proteasome and Cdc48 function without formation of a ternary complex, for example, by interacting with them sequentially. To begin to explore these options, we sought to determine whether a proteasome-Ynl155w-Cdc48 ternary complex could be visualized. To do this, we isolated recombinant purified Cdc48 on resin, and added Ynl155w or proteasome holoenzyme (RP2CP) or both. Again, we were able to detect significant binding of Ynl155w to Cdc48 (Fig. 2C). However, addition of proteasome and Ynl155w together did not increase recruitment of proteasome to Cdc48 (Fig. 2C). We also note that, at least under these relatively stringent conditions, there was only minimal interaction between the highly purified proteasome holoenzyme and Cdc48. We next performed the inverse of this experiment, isolating purified proteasomes on resin, and adding back Ynl155w, Cdc48, or both. Again, we were unable to detect recruitment of Cdc48 to proteasome holoenzymes (data not shown). These results disfavor model one, but do not distinguish between models two or three. Accordingly, we consider it unlikely that Ynl155w serves to recruit the proteasome and Cdc48 into a stable complex. The transcription factor Rpn4 is a master regulator of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. It induces the genes encoding all known proteasome subunits as well as several other ubiquitin system components, including Cdc48. Rpn4 recognizes a nine-base sequence in the promoters of these genes, termed the PACE motif (proteasome-associated control element) (14Mannhaupt G. Schnall R. Karpov V. Vetter I. Feldmann H. Rpn4p acts as a transcription factor by binding to PACE, a nonamer box found upstream of 26S proteasomal and other genes in yeast.FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Moreover, Rpn4 is itself a highly unstable proteasome substrate, creating a homeostatic feedback loop whereby defects in proteasome-mediated degradation result in stabilization of Rpn4, and increased synthesis of ubiquitin-proteasome components until Rpn4 levels are normalized (15Xie Y. Varshavsky A. RPN4 is a ligand, substrate, and transcriptional regulator of the 26S proteasome. A negative feedback circuit.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 3056-3061Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 16Wang X. Xu H. Ha S.W. Ju D. Xie Y. Proteasomal degradation of Rpn4 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is critical for cell viability under stressed conditions.Genetics. 2010; 184: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A canonical PACE sequence within the 5′-untranslated region of YNL155W is located between residues −191 and −183. To determine whether Rpn4 controls Ynl155w protein levels, we prepared whole cell extracts from wild-type, rpn4Δ, and ynl155Δ cells, and evaluated them by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 3A, Ynl155w levels were markedly reduced in the absence of Rpn4, indicating that, at least under normal growth conditions, Rpn4 is the major regulator of Ynl155w levels. The preceding data suggested a role for Ynl155w in protein degradation. We therefore sought in vivo phenotypes for the ynl155Δ mutant that could confirm a physiologic role for Ynl155w in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Protein misfolding and its associated toxicity, sometimes termed proteotoxicity, can be induced by a variety of stimuli, including heat, abnormal amino acids, translation errors, oxidation, and genetic mutation. We started with two well studied causes of protein misfolding, the abnormal amino acid canavanine, which causes misfolding upon incorporation into nascent proteins, and elevated temperature, which globally affects protein stability. Although it is difficult to definitively exclude a phenotype for any mutant, we were unable to identify a phenotype for the ynl155Δ mutant under these conditions (Fig. 3B). By contrast, the rpn4Δ mutant showed hypersensitivity to both treatments (Fig. 3B). Similarly, we were unable to detect a phenotype for ynl155Δ mutants when exposed to the translation inhibitor cycloheximide or the DNA damaging agents 4-nitroquinolone 1-oxide and hydroxyurea, all conditions under which the rpn4Δ mutant was highly compromised for growth (data not shown). Because Ynl155w shows sequence homology to the mammalian protein AIRAP, which was initially identified as an arsenite-inducible protein (10Stanhill A. Haynes C.M. Zhang Y. Min G. Steele M.C. Kalinina J. Martinez E. Pickart C.M. Kong X.P. Ron D. An arsenite-inducible 19S regulatory particle-associated protein adapts proteasomes to proteotoxicity.Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 875-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of sodium arsenite on the ynl155Δ mutant. Indeed, this compound proved to be profoundly inhibitory to growth of the ynl155Δ mutant (Fig. 3B). The rpn4Δ mutant showed even greater sensitivity to arsenite (Fig. 3B and data not shown). Importantly, the toxicity of arsenic, particularly in its trivalent form as in sodium arsenite, is thought to reflect the ability of arsenite to cause protein misfolding. Trivalent arsenic causes protein misfolding in vitro and in vivo, induces molecular chaperone function, increases levels of ubiquitinated proteins, and can cause protein aggregation (17Jacobson T. Navarrete C. Sharma S.K. Sideri T.C. Ibstedt S. Priya S. Grant C.M. Christen P. Goloubinoff P. Tamás M.J. Arsenite interferes with protein folding and triggers formation of protein aggregates in yeast.J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125: 5073-5083Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 18Kirkpatrick D.S. Dale K.V. Catania J.M. Gandolfi A.J. Low-level arsenite causes accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in rabbit renal cortical slices and HEK293 cells.Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2003; 186: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Arsenite is thought to effect protein misfolding by directly binding proteins, and altering their structures (19Zhang X.W. Yan X.J. Zhou Z.R. Yang F.F. Wu Z.Y. Sun H.B. Liang W.X. Song A.X. Lallemand-Breitenbach V. Jeanne M. Zhang Q.Y. Yang H.Y. Huang Q.H. Zhou G.B. Tong J.H. Zhang Y. Wu J.H. Hu H.Y. de Thé H. Chen S.J. Chen Z. Arsenic trioxide controls the fate of the PML-RARα oncoprotein by directly binding PML.Science. 2010; 328: 240-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Arsenic shares properties with heavy metals. We therefore examined cadmium chloride, nickel sulfate, and cobalt chloride. The rpn4Δ mutant showed marked sensitivity to all three compounds, but ynl155Δ did not (data not shown). Because all three metals were present as divalent cations, we wondered if the trivalence of arsenite was critical to its toxicity to the ynl155Δ mutant. To test this, we utilized the metalloid antimony in its trivalent state, and detected a growth defect in the ynl155Δ mutant (Fig. 3C). The antimony phenotype was less pronounced than with arsenic, so we repeated the assay in liquid culture form. Mock treated wild-type and ynl155Δ cells showed similar doubling times (1.5 h for both); in the presence of antimony trioxide, ynl155Δ cells showed a longer doubling time (2.1 versus 2.4 h; data not shown). Thus, Ynl155w shows remarkable specificity in protecting cells from trivalent metalloids. Yor052c is a 17-kDa uncharacterized zinc finger protein that shows sequence homology to Ynl155w, particularly within the zinc finger domain. In addition, the YOR052C promoter contains a PACE motif for Rpn4 recognition, as noted above for YNL155W. We therefore examined the same phenotypes in the yor052cΔ mutant. We observed that the yor052cΔ mutant behaved similarly to ynl155wΔ, showing the same pattern of growth inhibition with arsenic and antimony, but not with other stressors of the ubiquitin system (Fig. 3, B and C). Importantly, despite the similarity of the two proteins, the strong phenotype of each mutant alone implies a high degree of non-redundancy in their cellular functions. We next examined the consequences of overexpressing YNL155W by utilizing a YNL155W plasmid driven by the GADPH promoter. Evaluation of cell lysates confirmed a strong increase in Ynl155w protein levels (Fig. 3D). We evaluated the effect of this plasmid on the growth rates of wild-type and rpn4Δ strains. As shown in Fig. 3E, YNL155W overexpression slowed growth in the wild-type strain under normal culture conditions. The magnitude of growth inhibition was greatly increased in the rpn4Δ mutant: doubling time increased by 20% in the wild-type (1.7 versus 2.1 h), but by 136% in the rpn4Δ mutant (2.2 versus 5.2 h). This toxic effect of YNL155W overexpression indicates that tight control of Ynl155w levels is important for cellular function. Phenotypic exacerbation in the rpn4Δ background implies that proper function of Ynl155w occurs within the context of the concerted cellular stress response mediated by Rpn4. Ynl155w contains an AN1-type zinc finger domain at its N terminus. This domain, consisting of six cysteines and two histidines, has potential to coordinate two zinc ions. Although zinc finger proteins were originally described as nucleic acid-binding proteins, it is now clear that they can perform a variety of cellular functions. Of note, the zinc finger domain is currently thought to represent the second most common motif found in ubiquitin-binding proteins (20Randles L. Walters K.J. Ubiquitin and its binding domains.Front. Biosci. 2012; 17: 2140-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to test whether Ynl155w might be a novel ubiquitin-binding protein. We began by generating polyubiquitinated Sic1PY (ub-Sic1PY) in vitro. This substrate is competent for recognition, deubiquitination, and degradation by purified proteasomes (21Saeki Y. Isono E. Toh-E A. Preparation of ubiquitinated substrates by the PY motif-insertion method for monitoring 26S proteasome activity.Methods Enzymol. 2005; 399: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 8Lee B.H. Lee M.J. Park S. Oh D.C. Elsasser S. Chen P.C. Gartner C. Dimova N. Hanna J. Gygi S.P. Wilson S.M. King R.W. Finley D. Enhancement of proteasome activity by a small-molecule inhibitor of USP14.Nature. 2010; 467: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). We immobilized purified GST-Ynl155w on resin, and challenged it with ub-Sic1PY. We observed strong binding of this substrate to GST-Ynl155w; by contrast, free GST showed little or no binding (Fig. 4A). To confirm this result, we chose an unrelated substrate: free ubiquitin chains ranging in size from ub2 to ub7 and linked through lysine 48. There was little or no binding of diubiquitin or triubiquitin to GST-Ynl155w (Fig. 4B). However, tetraubiquitin and longer chains showed significant binding to GST-Ynl155w. Note that ub7, which is not an abundant component of the input material, is highly concentrated in the GST-Ynl155w-bound material (Fig. 4B). That GST-Ynl155w prefers ubiquitinated species with four or more ubiquitin molecules is interesting given that a four-ubiquitin chain has been proposed as the minimum chain length necessary for recognition by the proteasome (22Thrower JS Hoffman L Rechsteiner M Pickart CM Recognition of the polyubiquitin proteolytic signal.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar). Levels of GST and GST-Ynl155w were comparable in these experiments (Fig. 4C). Finally, we tested a third substrate consisting of a single ubiquitin fused to green fluorescent protein (ub-m-GFP) (23Guterman A. Glickman M.H. Complementary roles for Rpn11 and Ubp6 in deubiquitination and proteolysis by the proteasome.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1729-1738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). GST-Ynl155w appeared to show no specific binding to this substrate, consistent with the apparent preference of Ynl155w for polyubiquitinated substrates (data not shown). Although many zinc finger proteins coordinate zinc ions, some coordinate other metals, and some do not bind metal at all. To evaluate the importance of zinc binding for Ynl155w function, we immobilized purified GST-Ynl155w on resin, and then split the resin sample, maintaining one-half in zinc-containing buffer and briefly treating the other half with the metal chelators 1,10-phenanthroline and EDTA. Mock-treated GST-Ynl155w again bound ub-Sic1PY (Fig. 4D). By contrast, the metal-chelated GST-Ynl155w was essentially devoid of the ubiquitin binding function. To test if this effect was specific, we applied control or metal-chelated GST-Ynl155w to immobilized His12-Sumo-Cdc48. Metal-chelated GST-Ynl155w was fully competent to bind Cdc48 (Fig. 4E). Taken together, these results indicate that Ynl155w is a novel zinc-dependent ubiquitin-binding protein. All cells are exposed to environmental stresses, and the ability to respond to these insults is critical for survival. The ubiquitin-proteasome system, by virtue of its ability to destroy proteins, plays a central role in responding to stress-induced protein misfolding. In yeast, the transcription factor Rpn4 coordinates a broad stress response pathway to deal with misfolded proteins. Because Rpn4 is itself a substrate of the proteasome, conditions that compromise proteasome-mediated degradation stimulate coordinated synthesis of ubiquitin pathway components until the protein degrading capacity of the cell is restored (15Xie Y. Varshavsky A. RPN4 is a ligand, substrate, and transcriptional regulator of the 26S proteasome. A negative feedback circuit.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 3056-3061Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the RPN4 gene is itself subject to complex transcriptional regulation, suggesting that Rpn4 may respond to numerous cellular inputs (24Hahn J.S. Neef D.W. Thiele D.J.

Microbiol. 2006; 60: 240-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 25Owsianik G. Balzil L. Ghislain M. Control of 26S proteasome expression by transcription factors regulating multidrug resistance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1295-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Feedback control of proteasome function is seen in mammals as well as yeast, although the principal mediator of the response in higher organisms, Nrf1, is not related to Rpn4 by sequence (26Radhakrishnan S.K. Lee C.S. Young P. Beskow A. Chan J.Y. Deshaies R.J. Transcription factor Nrf1 mediates the proteasome recovery pathway after proteasome inhibition in mammalian cells.Mol.

Proteasomal degradation is transcriptionally controlled by TCF11 via an ERAD-dependent feedback loop.Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 147-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). We have identified a novel arm of the Rpn4-mediated stress response that protects cells from protein misfolding induced by metalloid compounds. Under these conditions, Ynl155w is essential for cell survival. Ynl155w is a zinc-dependent ubiquitin-binding protein and interacts with both the proteasome and Cdc48. Thus, Ynl155w appears to protect cells from metalloid-induced protein misfolding by delivering ubiquitinated substrates to Cdc48 and the proteasome, thereby facilitating their destruction (Fig. 4F). Sá-Moura and colleagues (28Sá-Moura B. Funakoshi M. Tomko Jr., R.J. Dohmen R.J. Wu Z. Peng J. Hochstrasser M. A conserved protein with AN1 zinc-finger and ubiquitin-like domains modulates Cdc48 (p97) function in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 33682-33696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) have also recently characterized Ynl155w, and their results are concordant with some our findings, specifically that Ynl155w interacts with the proteasome and Cdc48, and they have named the protein Cuz1 (Cdc48-associated ubiquitin-like domain/zinc finger protein-1). The various functions of Ynl155w appear to be distributed across the protein. We find that ubiquitin binding requires the N-terminal zinc finger. By contrast, Sá-Moura et al. (28Sá-Moura B. Funakoshi M. Tomko Jr., R.J. Dohmen R.J. Wu Z. Peng J. Hochstrasser M. A conserved protein with AN1 zinc-finger and ubiquitin-like domains modulates Cdc48 (p97) function in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 33682-33696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) show that a C-terminal ubiquitin-like domain is necessary for Cdc48 binding. Zinc chelation did not affect Cdc48 binding (Fig. 4E), which is consistent with this model. Precise localization of the proteasome binding site remains to be determined. Finally, recent reports suggest that Cdc48 may directly interact with the CP of the proteasome (29Barthelme D. Sauer R.T. Bipartite determinants mediate an evolutionarily conserved interaction between Cdc48 and the 20S peptidase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 3327-3332Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 30Barthelme D. Sauer R.T. Identification of the Cdc48·20S proteasome as an ancient AAA+ proteolytic machine.Science. 2012; 337: 843-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, in our experiments, CP is associated with RP, which occludes the potential binding site for Cdc48, and thus precludes evaluation of CP-Cdc48 interaction. We also report here the first phenotypic characterization of Yor052c, a zinc finger protein with sequence homology to Ynl155w. Like YNL155W, YOR052C contains a PACE motif within its promoter (data not shown) (28Sá-Moura B. Funakoshi M. Tomko Jr., R.J. Dohmen R.J. Wu Z. Peng J. Hochstrasser M. A conserved protein with AN1 zinc-finger and ubiquitin-like domains modulates Cdc48 (p97) function in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 33682-33696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), suggesting that it is also regulated by Rpn4. We find that yor052cΔ mutants show a similar phenotypic profile as ynl155wΔ mutants: both are essential for survival when cells are treated with metalloid compounds, but apparently dispensable for growth under several other conditions that cause protein misfolding. These overlapping phenotypic profiles, in conjunction with their sequence similarity, suggest a common function for the two proteins, but the strong phenotype of each mutant is consistent with significant non-redundant roles. We propose that Yor052c be named Tmc1 for trivalent metalloid sensitive, Cuz1-related protein-1. Our data add Ynl155w to a growing list of ubiquitin-binding proteins. The sheer number of ubiquitin receptors indicates a high degree of complexity in recognizing and processing ubiquitinated substrates. Ynl155w is distinguished by its ability to interact with both Cdc48 and the proteasome, its regulation by Rpn4, and its highly specific phenotypic profile. These data suggest that Ynl155w may recognize only a subset of misfolded ubiquitinated proteins. At a minimum, Ynl155w appears essential for surviving metalloid toxicity, suggesting that proteins damaged by metalloids may represent its preferred substrates. Identifying the spectrum of Ynl155w substrates, as well as the physical and chemical determinants for recognition by Ynl155w, represent important goals. It is worth noting that one of the two mammalian proteins related to Ynl155w, AIRAP-L, contains two ubiquitin-interacting motifs (11Yun C. Stanhill A. Yang Y. Zhang Y. Haynes C.M. Xu C.F. Neubert T.A. Mor A. Philips M.R. Ron D. Proteasomal adaptation to environmental stress links resistance to proteotoxicity with longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 7094-7099Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Although this has not yet been tested experimentally, these findings suggest that the ubiquitin binding function of Ynl155w may be conserved in higher organisms. Within the proteasome, Rpn1 and Rpn2 appear to serve as a scaffold for a variety of substrate processing factors (6Leggett D.S. Hanna J. Borodovsky A. Crosas B. Schmidt M. Baker R.T. Walz T.

Rpn2 binds the ubiquitin receptor Rpn13 and the ubiquitinating enzyme Hul5. Thus the interaction of Ynl155w with Rpn2 suggests that Ynl155w is well positioned to deliver substrates to the proteasome in a manner that allows for further processing prior to destruction. Ynl155w and Yor052c protect cells from the toxicity of trivalent metalloids. Although the two proteins are likely to function in other cellular contexts, their specificity for trivalent metalloids suggests that they may provide insight into the nature and function of these medically relevant compounds. Acute promyelocytic leukemia is caused by a cytogenetic translocation resulting in the fusion protein PML-RARα. Trivalent arsenic has helped transform treatment of this disease: by directly binding PML-RARα, arsenic induces its misfolding and subsequent proteasomal destruction, eliminating this oncogene (19Zhang X.W.

Antimony is used to treat cutaneous leishmaniasis, although the molecular basis for its effect is not known. The possibility exists that metalloids and heavy metals, by virtue of their ability to alter protein homeostasis, may have other clinically useful properties.

Proton binding and release occur in the middle of the membrane at Asp-61 on the second transmembrane helix (TMH) of subunit c, which folds in a hairpin-like structure with two TMHs. Previously, the aqueous accessibility of Cys substitutions in the transmembrane regions of subunit c was probed by testing the inhibitory effects of Ag+ or Cd2+ on function, which revealed extensive aqueous access in the region around Asp-61 and on the half of TMH2 extending to the cytoplasm. In the current study, we surveyed the Ag+ and Cd2+ sensitivity of Cys substitutions in the loop of the helical hairpin and used a variety of assays to categorize the mechanisms by which Ag+ or Cd2+ chelation with the Cys thiolates caused inhibition. We identified two distinct metal-sensitive regions in the cytoplasmic loop where function was inhibited by different mechanisms. Metal binding to Cys substitutions in the N-terminal half of the loop resulted in an uncoupling of F1 from F0 with release of F1 from the membrane. In contrast, substitutions in the C-terminal half of the loop retained membrane-bound F1 after metal treatment. In several of these cases, inhibition was shown to be due to blockage of passive H+ translocation through F0 as assayed with F0 reconstituted into liposomes. The results suggest that the C-terminal domain of the cytoplasmic loop may function in gating H+ translocation to the cytoplasm.

The ATP synthase complex is composed of two sectors, i.e. a water-soluble F1 sector that is bound to a membrane-embedded F0 sector. In eubacteria, F1 is composed of five subunits in an α3β3γδϵ ratio and contains three catalytic sites for ATP synthesis and/or hydrolysis centered at the α-β subunit interfaces. F0 is composed of three subunits in an a1b2c10–15 ratio in eubacteria and functions as the ion-conducting pathway (4Foster D.L. Fillingame R.H.

Here we report on the reactivity of Cys substitutions in the cytoplasmic loop and at the N- and C-terminal ends of subunit c, completing the screening of nearly all residues in the subunit. The sensitivity of function to inhibition by Ag+ and Cd2+ proved to be widespread in the loop. Inhibition in this region was surprising because metal chelation to the transmembrane Cys thiolates was thought to inhibit function by blocking proton translocation through F0, a function in which the loop was not thought to directly participate. We sought to distinguish between several possible mechanisms of inhibition by Ag+ and Cd2+. Our experiments support the well characterized role of the loop in F1 binding, which proved to be disrupted by Ag+ and Cd2+ in some substitutions, but also suggest involvement of a distinct section of the loop in gating H+ transport to the cytoplasm. In light of this and other data, we hypothesize that the aqueous half-channel from the middle of the membrane to the cytoplasm continues through a cytoplasmic domain at the subunit a-c interface formed by cytoplasmic loops from both subunits.

Aliquots of membranes (1.6 mg at 10 mg/ml) were suspended in 3.2 ml of HMK-NO3 buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, 1 mm Mg(NO3)2, 10 mm KNO3, pH 7.5) or HMK-Cl buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, 5 mm MgCl2, 300 mm KCl, pH 7.5) and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. ACMA was added to 0.3 μg/ml, and fluorescence quenching was initiated by the addition of 30 μl of 2.5 mm ATP, pH 7. Each experiment was terminated by adding nigericin to 0.5 μg/ml. The fluorescence measured after the addition of nigericin was used as the base line from which the relative quenching of the mutant membranes was calculated. Treatments with Ag+ or Cd2+ were carried out in HMK-NO3 buffer or HMK-Cl buffer, respectively. Inhibition caused by metal treatment was reversed by adding dithiothreitol (DTT) to 2 mm or β-mercaptoethanol (β-MSH) to 4 mm after initiation of quenching with ATP. Typically, 10 μg of membrane protein were diluted into 0.9 ml of TM buffer (55.5 mm Tris-SO4, 0.2 mm MgSO4, pH 7.8). The assay was initiated by the addition of 100 μl of 4 mm ATP supplemented with 0.8 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP. After incubation for 6 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 800 μl of 11.25% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and immediately placed on ice for 10 min. Liberated phosphate was extracted from aqueous solution by adding 0.3 ml of 5 m H2SO4, 0.6 ml of 6% (w/v) ammonium molybdate, and 3 ml of benzene:isobutanol (1:1) followed by Vortex mixing. After phase separation, 0.5 ml of the organic phase was removed for scintillation counting. For treatments with DCCD, HMK-NO3 buffer containing membrane protein at 0.5 mg/ml was supplemented with 50 μm DCCD from a 0.1 m ethanolic stock solution and incubated for 20 min at room temperature prior to additional treatment. For silver and cadmium treatments, membrane protein in HMK-NO3 buffer was incubated with 40 μm AgNO3 or 300 μm CdCl2 for 10 min at room temperature. To measure F1 dissociation, membranes at 0.5 mg/ml in HMK-NO3 buffer were incubated at room temperature for 5 min with or without the inclusion of 40 μm AgNO3 or 300 μm CdCl2. Half of this suspension was centrifuged at 541,000 × g for 10 min at room temperature to pellet the membrane vesicles. Membranes were exposed to metal a total of 15 min prior to the ATPase assay. A 10-μg aliquot from the uncentrifuged suspension and an equivalent volume of supernatant from the centrifuged suspension were transferred to TM buffer and assayed as above. The His-tagged F1F0 complex was purified as described previously (50Ishmukhametov R.R. Galkin M.A. Vik S.B.

Membrane vesicles from 12 g of plasmid pFV2/strain DK8-transformed cells were suspended at ∼20–25 mg/ml in 10 ml of extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl, 250 mm sucrose, 30 mm imidazole, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm K2-EDTA, 40 mm 6-aminocaproic acid, 15 mm p-aminobenzamidine, 0.2 mm DTT, 0.8% soybean phosphatidylcholine (Sigma, Type IV-S), 1% octyl glucoside, 0.5% cholate, 0.5% deoxycholate, 2.5% glycerol, pH 7.5) and incubated at 4 °C with rocking for 30 min. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 541,000 × g for 30 min. A 1.25-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (His Select, Sigma) was preequilibrated with 5 volumes of extraction buffer, and the supernatant fraction of the extract was loaded at a flow rate of 0.18 ml/min. The column was washed with 10 volumes of extraction buffer. Bound protein was eluted with 5 ml of elution buffer (extraction buffer containing 400 mm imidazole) at a flow rate of 0.27 ml/min. Ten 0.5-ml fractions were flash frozen in a dry ice and ethanol slurry and stored at −80 °C. Fractions were screened for F1F0 components by SDS-PAGE, and protein concentrations were determined using a modified Lowry method (53Fillingame R.H.

https://openalex.org/W2021743082,"The G protein-coupled protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) is irreversibly proteolytically activated by thrombin. Hence, the precise regulation of PAR1 signaling is important for proper cellular responses. In addition to desensitization, internalization and lysosomal sorting of activated PAR1 are critical for the termination of signaling. Unlike most G protein-coupled receptors, PAR1 internalization is mediated by the clathrin adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2) and epsin-1, rather than β-arrestins. However, the function of AP-2 and epsin-1 in the regulation of PAR1 signaling is not known. Here, we report that AP-2, and not epsin-1, regulates activated PAR1-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis via two different mechanisms that involve, in part, a subset of R4 subfamily of ""regulator of G protein signaling"" (RGS) proteins. A significantly greater increase in activated PAR1 signaling was observed in cells depleted of AP-2 using siRNA or in cells expressing a PAR1 (420)AKKAA(424) mutant with defective AP-2 binding. This effect was attributed to AP-2 modulation of PAR1 surface expression and efficiency of G protein coupling. We further found that ectopic expression of R4 subfamily members RGS2, RGS3, RGS4, and RGS5 reduced activated PAR1 wild-type signaling, whereas signaling by the PAR1 AKKAA mutant was minimally affected. Intriguingly, siRNA-mediated depletion analysis revealed a function for RGS5 in the regulation of signaling by the PAR1 wild type but not the AKKAA mutant. Moreover, activation of the PAR1 wild type, and not the AKKAA mutant, induced Gαq association with RGS3 via an AP-2-dependent mechanism. Thus, AP-2 regulates activated PAR1 signaling by altering receptor surface expression and through recruitment of RGS proteins."

However, gene targeting of matrilin-1 in mouse did not lead to pronounced phenotypes. Here we used the zebrafish as an alternative model to study matrilin function in vivo. Matrilin-1 displays a multiphasic expression during zebrafish development. In an early phase, with peak expression at about 15 h post-fertilization, matrilin-1 is present throughout the zebrafish embryo with exception of the notochord. Later, when the skeleton develops, matrilin-1 is expressed mainly in cartilage. Morpholino knockdown of matrilin-1 results both in overall growth defects and in disturbances in the formation of the craniofacial cartilage, most prominently loss of collagen II deposition. In fish with mild phenotypes, certain cartilage extracellular matrix components were present, but the tissue did not show features characteristic for cartilage. The cells showed endoplasmic reticulum aberrations but no activation of XBP-1, a marker for endoplasmic reticulum stress. In severe phenotypes nearly all chondrocytes died. During the early expression phase the matrilin-1 knockdown had no effects on cell morphology, but increased cell death was observed. In addition, the broad deposition of collagen II was largely abolished. Interestingly, the early phenotype could be rescued by the co-injection of mRNA coding for the von Willebrand factor C domain of collagen IIα1a, indicating that the functional loss of this domain occurs as a consequence of matrilin-1 deficiency. The results show that matrilin-1 is indispensible for zebrafish cartilage formation and plays a role in the early collagen II-dependent developmental events.

The results show that matrilin-1 is indispensible for zebrafish cartilage formation and plays a role in the early collagen II-dependent developmental events. The matrilins are a family of oligomeric adaptor proteins that are expressed in cartilage and many other types of extracellular matrix. They participate in the formation of fibrillar or filamentous structures and mediate interactions between collagen fibrils and other matrix constituents (1Klatt A.R. Becker A.K. Neacsu C.D.

This adaptor function may be modulated by physiological proteolysis that causes the loss of single subunits and thereby a decrease in binding avidity (3Ehlen H.W. Sengle G. Klatt A.R. Talke A.

Initial attempts to study matrilin function by gene inactivation in mouse were inconclusive as mice deficient for matrilin-1 (4Aszódi A. Bateman J.F. Hirsch E. Baranyi M. Hunziker E.B. Hauser N.

Later it was shown that peripheral nerve regeneration is disturbed in matrilin-2 deficient mice, pointing to a role for matrilin-2 in axonal growth (9Malin D. Sonnenberg-Riethmacher E. Guseva D.

Even mice double deficient for matrilin-1 and matrilin-3, which are both highly expressed in cartilage, did not show any overt phenotype. However, in depth analysis of the cartilage matrix of such mice revealed moderately increased collagen fibril diameters and an increased collagen volume density, which could, although less marked, be detected also in the corresponding single mutant mice (10Nicolae C.

Chem. 2007; 282: 22163-22175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Taken together the results demonstrate that matrilin-1 and matrilin-3 modulate cartilage collagen fibrillogenesis and that functional compensation between the two proteins may occur. As matrilins are well conserved in evolution (11Chakravarti R. Adams J.C. Comparative genomics of the syndecans defines an ancestral genomic context associated with matrilins in vertebrates.BMC Genomics. 2006; 7: 83Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we decided to study matrilin function in a less complex animal model, the zebrafish (Danio rerio). Matrilins are present in all vertebrates studied, including the zebrafish, where the temporal and spatial expression has been partially explored (12Ko Y.-P. Kobbe B. Paulsson M. Wagener R.

Furthermore, many interaction partners of matrilins, e.g. collagen II, collagen VI, collagen IX, or decorin, have been characterized in zebrafish (13Yan Y.L. Hatta K. Riggleman B. Postlethwait J.H.

The temporal and spatial expression of zebrafish matrilins is similar to that in mouse and matrilin-1 and -3a show a predominantly skeletal expression, whereas matrilin-4 is more widespread, with the protein also present in loose connective tissues and epithelia. Here we used a morpholino knockdown approach to analyze the consequences of deficiency for matrilin-1 in zebrafish to gain insight into matrilin function in vivo. Zebrafish embryos were obtained by crossing Cologne wild-type strain or sox10:egfp strain adult fish (19Carney T.J. Dutton K.A. Greenhill E. Delfino-Machín M. Dufourcq P. Blader P. Kelsh R.N.

Morpholino antisense oligonucleotides were designed by and obtained from Gene-Tools Inc. (Table 1). Two different morpholinos covering the ATG translation start codon and the 5′ UTR and one covering the 5′ splice donor site of exon 1 were used, resulting in inhibited translation or mRNA processing, respectively. Five-mismatch morpholinos were used as negative controls.

Injected and untreated larvae were transferred to embryo buffer containing 10 μm bortezomib (Millenium Pharmaceuticals) at 48 hpf, prior to craniofacial cartilage development (gating). The larvae were again incubated for 24 h at 28 °C, sacrificed, and subsequently analyzed by whole mount Alcian blue staining. To induce p53-mediated apoptosis for control experiments, uninjected embryos were incubated in 500 nm camptothecin (Calbiochem) for 12 h, then sacrificed and snap frozen on liquid nitrogen for protein extraction. To inhibit apoptosis, a total of 2 pmol of Z-VAD-FMK (carbobenzoxy-valyl-alanyl-aspartyl-[O-methyl]-fluoromethylketone) was co-injected with 10 ng of matrilin-1 morpholino and the resulting morphants were subsequently subjected to TUNEL assays or photography of living zebrafish as noted. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) was used to detect cell death in developing zebrafish embryos. Embryos were collected at 18 hpf, manually dechorionated, and fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C. They were then stained with the DeadEnd fluorometric TUNEL system kit (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR was used to produce partial zebrafish matrilin-1 cDNA. Primers were designed according to genomic sequences deposited in the databases (Table 1). PCR were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions using AmpliTaq polymerase (Applied Biosystems). In the case of nested and semi-nested PCRs, primer pairs designed against sequences inside PCR fragments were employed in a second PCR step. PCR fragments were cloned into pBluescript II using the Rapid Ligation Kit (Roche). TaqMan-PCR was performed in triplicates with a final volume of 20 μl containing 10 μl of 2× TaqMan® Gene Expression Master Mix, 1 μl of probe solution (Dr03092841_m1), and different amounts of cDNA (80, 40, 20, 10, 5, 2.5, and 0 ng of cDNA) and deionized water.

J. 2005; 386: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) by cycling the serum over columns coupled with the recombinant protein for 2 days. The depleted serum underwent final affinity purification using a column coupled with the antigen used for immunization and elution of the bound antibody with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5. Zebrafish larvae were anesthetized with a 1:100 dilution of a 4 mg/ml Tricaine® (Sigma) stock solution prior to photography of living zebrafish. After sacrifice but before fixation, all zebrafish embryos older than 24 hpf were bleached using 1.5% H2O2, 0.5% KOH for 20 min at room temperature. Where appropriate, embryos were manually dechorionated. Then embryos and larvae were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 to 4 h at room temperature. For whole-mount Alcian blue staining, the embryos were washed in 50% ethanol and stained with Alcian blue solution overnight (22Walker M.B. Kimmel C.B. A two-color acid-free cartilage and bone stain for zebrafish larvae.Biotech. Histochem. 2007; 82: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). The stained embryos were then bleached as described above and cleared for 2 days in 0.25% KOH, 20% glycerol at room temperature. The samples were photographed using a Nikon SMZ 1500/Nikon DS-Fi1 setup. For whole mount immunohistochemical staining, fixed embryos were incubated in methanol overnight at −20 °C. The embryos were sequentially rehydrated (5 min 100, 100, 96, 90, 70, and 50% (v/v) EtOH in PBS) and subsequently blocked with 5% (w/v) normal goat serum in PBS for 2 h. The affinity purified antibodies were applied in 5% (w/v) normal goat serum in PBS for 1 h or overnight at room temperature. The primary antibodies were visualized by consecutive application of Alexa 488, Alexa 546 (Sigma), or alkaline phosphatase (Vector Laboratories)-conjugated secondary antibodies, diluted in 5% (v/v) normal goat serum in PBS. The embryos were photographed after clearing for 2 days in 0.25% KOH, 20% glycerol at room temperature using a Nikon SMZ 1500/Nikon DS-Fi1 setup. Paraffin-embedded sections (3.5 μm) were deparaffinized by two 5-min incubations in Rotihistol (Roth). After rehydration in PBS, the sections were digested with either bovine testicular hyaluronidase (Sigma, 500 units/ml in 0.1 m NaH2PO4, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0) at 37 °C for 30 min or chondroitinase ABC (Sigma, 0.5 milliunits in 60 mm sodium acetate, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 0.02% bovine serum albumin) at 37 °C for 60 min. Subsequently, sections underwent proteinase-K digestion (Sigma, 5 milliunits in 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5) for 10 min at 37 °C with a postfixation in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. After washing, the sections were blocked with 5% (w/v) normal goat serum in TBS for 1 h and incubated with the affinity-purified antibody at room temperature for 2 h or overnight at 4 °C. The primary antibody was visualized either by consecutive application of Alexa 488/546-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma, diluted in 1% (w/v) normal goat serum in TBS) or by using the Sigma Fast Red Kit® according to manufacturer's instructions. Paraffin-embedded sections were rehydrated as described above and immersed in hematoxylin staining solution (1 g of hematoxylin, 200 mg of NaJO3, 50 g of K2Al2(SO4)4, 50 g of chloral hydrate, 1 g of acetic acid, and 1 liter of H2O) for 5 min. The sections were then briefly immersed in tap water, followed by a 10-s incubation in 1% (v/v) HCl and 70% (v/v) EtOH in H2O. After three consecutive immersions in tap water, the sections were transferred for 30 min to Alcian blue staining solution (1% (w/v) Alcian blue 8GX, 3% (v/v) glacial acetic acid in H2O). Sections were then consecutively incubated for 2 min in tap water and 1% (w/v) eosin diluted in H2O. The sections were dehydrated by sequential immersion in 70 and 96% (v/v) EtOH, isopropyl alcohol, and xylol for 5 min. Wild type and morphant 24- and 72-hpf zebrafish embryos were anesthetized with 0.04% Tricaine as described above, and transferred from embryo buffer into fixation buffer (6% glutaraldehyde and 0.5% cetylpyridinium chloride in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2). 72-Hpf embryos were transferred to freshly prepared fixation buffer and stored for an additional 24 h at room temperature. 24-Hpf embryos were stored in fixation buffer additionally containing 5% sucrose. The embryos were then rinsed twice for 15 min in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, postfixed 2 h with 1% OsO4 in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, at room temperature in the dark, rinsed again, dehydrated with acetone, and embedded in araldite CY212 (Durcupan ACM, Fluka). Ultrathin sections were cut at gray interference color (25–30 nm) with a 35°-diamond knife (Diatome) on an Ultracut E (Leica), stretched with chloroform vapor, mounted on 200-mesh copper grids (5-μm bar thickness), and contrasted 10 min with saturated (2%) uranyl acetate in 70% EtOH and 5 min with 0.2% aqueous lead citrate, pH 11.8. Microscopy was performed with a Zeiss EM109 (80 kV, 500-μm condenser 1 aperture, 200-μm condenser 2 aperture, 30-μm objective aperture) equipped with a temperature-stabilized wide angle YAC-CCD camera at the side entry port (1024 × 1024 pixel, 12-bit greyscale/pixel; [email protected]). Magnification was calibrated with a cross-grating replica (2160 lines/mm, d = 0.463 μm). Western blot analysis was performed using a Laemmli-based discontinuous buffer system (23Laemmli U.K. Cleavage of structural proteins during the assembly of the head of bacteriophage T4.Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar). Protein samples were obtained by sequential extraction as described (10Nicolae C. Ko Y.-P. Miosge N. Niehoff A. Studer D. Enggist L. Hunziker E.B. Paulsson M. Wagener R. Aszodi A.

Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and detected using polyclonal antibodies diluted in TBS. Bands were detected by chemiluminescence immunoassay using a peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Dako). Fragments of matrilin-1 cDNA (bp 475–1370, GenBank accession No. NM_001099740) were subcloned into pBluescript II SK, which contained T7 and T3 promoters and were used as probes for in situ hybridization. The plasmid DNA was linearized with SpeI (T7) or KpnI (T3), transcribed in vitro by T7 and T3 RNA polymerases (Roche Applied Science) and labeled with digoxigenin (Roche Applied Science). In situ hybridization was carried out according to Ref. 24Thisse C. Thisse B. High-resolution in situ hybridization to whole-mount zebrafish embryos.Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar. Wild type embryos were collected between 24 hpf and 5 days post-fertilization. After removal of the chorion, embryos were fixed in PBS with 4% paraformaldehyde. The hybridization was performed with 30–50 ng of antisense digoxigenin-labeled RNA probe in hybridization buffer (50% deionized formamide, 5× SSC, 0.1% Tween 20, 50 μg/ml of heparin, 500 μg/ml of RNase-free tRNA adjusted to pH 6.0 with citric acid) at 70 °C overnight. Hybridization was detected with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody (1:10,000) followed by incubation with BM-Purple (NBT/BZIP, Roche Applied Science) for 3–8 h. The embryos were finally mounted in 100% glycerol and observed on a Nikon SMZ 1500/Nikon DS-Fi1 setup. First, we extended the previous analysis of zebrafish matrilin-1 expression (12Ko Y.-P. Kobbe B. Paulsson M. Wagener R. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) matrilins. Shared and divergent characteristics with their mammalian counterparts.Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To determine the temporal expression during development, mRNA was collected at time points between 3 and 120 hpf and quantitative real-time PCR was performed. Thereby, a distinct early expression of matrilin-1 with its maximum at about 15 hpf was detected (Fig. 1A), however, 1000-fold weaker than later when the skeleton is formed. The second phase of expression starts at about 64 hpf, when the development of the craniofacial cartilage begins, and reaches a first maximum at about 88 hpf, and a second at about 112 hpf, the time the ossification of the spinal column begins (Fig. 1B). Proteins were sequentially extracted from mechanically disrupted whole zebrafish with TBS, high salt solution with 10 mm EDTA, and 4 m guanidinium HCl at 24, 48, and 72 hpf. Western blot analysis after nonreducing SDS-PAGE indicated that matrilin-1 is most strongly present at 72 hpf (Fig. 1C), but matrilin-1 protein could also be detected at 24 hpf. However, whereas at 24 hpf"
https://openalex.org/W2132659489,"Kaposi sarcoma (KS) and primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) are two pathologies associated with KS herpes virus (KSHV/HHV-8) infection. KSHV genome contains several oncogenes, among which, the viral G-protein-coupled receptor (vGPCR open reading frame 74) has emerged as a major factor in KS pathogenicity. Indeed, vGPCR is a constitutively active receptor, whose expression is sufficient to drive cell transformation in vitro and tumour development in mice. However, neither the role of vGPCR in KSHV-infected B-lymphocytes nor the molecular basis for its constitutive activation is well understood. Here, we show that vGPCR expression contributes to nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-dependent cellular survival in both PEL cells and primary B cells from HIV-negative KS patients. We further identified within vGPCR an AP2 consensus binding motif, Y326GLF, that directs its localization between the plasma membrane and clathrin-coated vesicles. The introduction of a mutation in this site (Y326A) increased NF-κB activity and proinflammatory cytokines production. This correlated with exacerbated morphological rearrangement, migration and proliferation of non-infected monocytes. Collectively, our work raises the possibility that KSHV-infected B-lymphocytes use vGPCR to impact ultimately the immune response and communication within the tumour microenvironment in KSHV-associated pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W2069897942,"In bacteria, most secreted proteins are exported through the SecYEG translocon by the SecA ATPase motor via the general secretion or ""Sec"" pathway. The identification of an additional SecA protein, particularly in Gram-positive pathogens, has raised important questions about the role of SecA2 in both protein export and establishment of virulence. We previously showed in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, the accessory SecA2 protein possesses ATPase activity that is required for bacterial survival in host macrophages, highlighting its importance in virulence. Here, we show that SecA2 binds ADP with much higher affinity than SecA1 and releases the nucleotide more slowly. Nucleotide binding also regulates movement of the precursor-binding domain in SecA2, unlike in SecA1 or conventional SecA proteins. This conformational change involving closure of the clamp in SecA2 may provide a mechanism for the cell to direct protein export through the conventional SecA1 pathway under normal growth conditions while preventing ordinary precursor proteins from interacting with the specialized SecA2 ATPase."

In this study we report new evidence that TEA had the capacity for inhibiting HeLa proliferation and inducing apoptosis by a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and flow cytometry analysis, respectively. In addition, proteomics combined with bioinformatics and other analytical methods was carried out to study differential proteins and potential networks of TEA cytotoxicity to HeLa cell. Cross-talk analysis on mRNA levels was set up among TEA, 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), and cisplatin (CDDP). 4-AP is another calcium-activated potassium channel blocker; it decreases cell viability and induces DNA fragmentation dose-dependently (18Chin L.S.

Similar to most anticancer drugs such as CDDP, TEA also has a potential capacity for inducing the apoptosis of various cancer cells besides KChs blocking. The HeLa cell line was purchased from Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China. It was cultured at 37 °C, with 5% CO2 in DMEM (high glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. A Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line (22Zhang Y. McKay S.E. Bewley B. Kaczmarek L.K. Repetitive firing triggers clustering of Kv2.1 potassium channels in aplysia neurons.J. Biol.

The toxicity of tetraethylammonium (Sigma) was evaluated in HeLa cells using an MTT reduction assay (23Mosmann T. Rapid colorimetric assay for cellular growth and survival. Application to proliferation and cytotoxicity assays.J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46264) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells were seeded on a 96-well plate for 24 h to reach the density of 104 cells/ml. Various concentrations of TEA at three treating periods were conducted in parallel. Another 20-μl MTT solution (0.25 g/ml) was added, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. Another 100 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to each well to dissolve the purple formazon crystals after the removal of the MTT solution, and the plate was gently shaken at room temperature for 20 min. The optical density was measured at 570 nm using a plate reader (FLUOstar Omega). Cells without treatment were used as a control for 100% cellular viability. Each group included triplicate assays to confirm the results. All experiments were performed using EPICS XL flow cytometry (Beckman) in triplicate as previous described (24Huang Q.-Y. Huang H.-Q. Differential expression profile of membrane proteins in zebrafish (Danio rerio) brain exposed to methyl parathion.Proteomics. 2011; 11: 3743-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The cells were stained with PI, and around 10,000 dyed cells were captured for cell phase distribution analysis as described elsewhere (25Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. A rapid and simple method for measuring thymocyte apoptosis by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry.J. Immunol.

Briefly, 106 cells were harvested and washed twice with PBS. The cells were resuspended in binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2), and annexin V- FITC and PI were added to a final concentration of 1 and 10 μg/ml, respectively, and they were incubated for 10 min in the dark at room temperature before flow cytometry analysis. For the patch clamp experiment, a standard setup including an inverted microscope and an Axon amplifier was used as described before (15Han X. Wang F. Yao W. Xing H. Weng D. Song X. Chen G. Xi L.

A two-step procedure was applied for making glass capillaries. The pipette solution was made up as follows: 142 mm NaCl 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 15 mm glucose, adjusted to pH 7.35.

Recording started while holding voltage at −80 mV, with step voltage from −40 to 60 mV. TEA was then applied for 5 min, and the current of the same cell was recorded. Data acquisition and analysis were carried out using pCLAMP 9 software (Axon Instruments). HeLa cells were harvested and homogenized in lysis buffer (8 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 65 mm DTT, 40 mm Tris, 0.5% ampholyte 3-10, and 1 mm PMSF) using an IKA® T10 basic disperser. After extraction at 4°C overnight, the homogenate was centrifuged for 1 h at 12,000 × g, the supernatants were collected, and their protein contents were measured using the Bradford assay respectively (26Bradford M.M. A rapid and sensitive method for the quantitation of microgram quantities of protein utilizing the principle of protein-dye binding.Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215653) Google Scholar). 150 μg of whole HeLa cell lysate was mixed with a rehydration solution containing 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% CHAPS (w/v), 1% DTT (w/v), and 0.5% IPG (immobilized pH gradient) buffer (Bio-Rad). The sample mixture was loaded onto pH 4–7, 17-cm ReadyStrip IPG strips (Bio-Rad). First-dimensional isoelectric focusing steps were conducted using the following protocol: active rehydration at room temperature for 12 h, voltage steps from 1 h at 100 V, 1 h at 500 V, then slowing ramping from 1,000 to 8,000 V to reach a total of 80,000 V h (PROTEAN IEF System, Bio-Rad). Equilibration steps were applied immediately after focusing with equilibration buffer (6 m urea, 50 mm Tris, 2% w/v SDS, 30% v/v glycerol, and a trace of bromphenol blue, pH 8.8), containing 1% w/v DTT for 20 min followed by incubation in the same buffer containing 2.5% w/v iodoacetamide for another 20 min. The equilibrated strip was applied directly to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE) and separated at a constant current of 25 mA/gel until the bromphenol blue reached the bottom of the gel. For each protein sample (control or TEA treatment), three experimental triplicates were subjected to two-dimensional electrophoresis and visualized using silver-staining. The stained gel was captured by using the ChemiDocTX system (Bio-Rad) and analyzed to find any statistically different proteins with ImageMaster 2D Platinum software (27Huang Q.-Y. Huang L. Huang H.-Q. Proteomic analysis of methyl parathion-responsive proteins in zebrafish (Danio rerio) brain.Comp. Biochem. Physiol. C. Toxicol. Pharmacol. 2011; 153: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Selected proteins spots were manually excised and digested with trypsin (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. The protein digest solution was extracted with ZipTip and washed with 0.1% TFA solution. An equal volume of peptide and matrix α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid saturated with 50% acetonitrile, 0.05% TFA were mixed, and 1 μl of the mixture was spotted onto a MALDI stainless steel target and evaporated at room temperature. An ABI 4800 Proteomics Analyzer MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (AB SCIEX, MA) was used for analysis, and spectra were calibrated using digested BSA. MALDI-TOF MS and TOF-TOF MS/MS were performed, and data were acquired in the positive MS reflector mode with a scan range from 800 to 4000 Da. The 10 most abundant precursors were selected for further MS/MS analysis. The MASCOT search engine was applied for interpretation of the mass spectra, allowing up to one missed cleavage, and variable modifications of carbamidomethylation and methionine oxidation, and maximal mass tolerances for precursor and fragments were set at 10 ppm and 0.05 Da, respectively. Results with % confidence interval values >95% were considered to be positive identifications. Proteins from HeLa whole cell lysate were separated on 12% gels. Briefly, after electrophoresis, the resolved proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane and then blocked in 5% w/v nonfat milk TBST for 1 h (50 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20). The PVDF membrane was then incubated with the primary antibodies anti-glutathione S-transferase ω1 (GSTOl) or anti-Rho-GDPα (Santa Cruz, CA, 1:5000 dilution) and anti-β-actin or anti-α-tubulin (Santa Cruz, 1:5000 dilution) overnight at 4 °C. Secondary antibody HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Pierce, 1:10,000 dilution) was incubated with the PVDF membrane for 1 h after washing 3 times with TBST. The membrane was again washed 3 times with TBST, and the blot was developed using ECL. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis was performed as previously described (20Ji X.-T. Huang L. Huang H.-Q. Construction of nanometer cisplatin core-ferritin (NCC-F) and proteomic analysis of gastric cancer cell apoptosis induced with cisplatin released from the NCC-F.J. Proteomics. 2012; 75: 3145-3157Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Total RNAs were extracted from the HeLa cell using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and cDNAs were synthesized using ImProm-IITM Reverse Transcription (Promega). A Rotor-GeneTM 6000 real-time rotary analyzer (Corbett Life Science) was used to amplify both target and internal control templates following the manufacturer's instructions (TaKaRa, Japan) (1 cycle at 95 °C for 5 min and 40 amplification cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s). In brief, 1 μl of reverse-transcribed product template, 5 μl of SYBR Premix Ex TaqTM II, and the gene-specific primer pairs at a final concentration of 500 nm for each primer made 10 μl of reaction system. HeLa DNA was used to construct standard curves (CT versus log copy number) for target amplicons and normalized according to the β-actin gene expression. The molecular functions and subcellular locations of these proteins were searched in the Uniprot database based on accession numbers. The pathway maps containing regulated-proteins were constructed manually based on previous search outputs. To set up a signaling network model, which would be affected by TEA treatment in the HeLa cell, Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) software (Ingenuity Systems) was used to analyze each gene object corresponding to each modulated protein. Matched genes generated global molecular networks obtained from the pathway knowledge base. Functional analysis of each network was most significant for the genes involved in this network. The genes mapped to the biological networks were ranked by scores indicating the probability that a collection of genes equal to or greater than the number in the network could be achieved by chance alone, and three was set as the cutoff value for identifying significant gene networks affected by the TEA (28Chen D.-S. Chan K.M. Changes in the protein expression profiles of the Hepa-T1 cell line when exposed to Cu2+.Aquat. Toxicol. 2009; 94: 163-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). MTT assay is a colorimetric assay, and it is based on conversion of MTT into insoluble formazan crystals (purple) by mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase, and the latter is dissolved by DMSO and measured spectrophotometrically. Because the reduction of MTT can only occur in metabolically active cells, this assay is broadly used to measure cell viability and evaluate cytotoxic effects of drugs on cell lines in vitro. To determine the level to which the TEA inhibited HeLa proliferation, HeLa cells were cultured in a 96-well plate at various TEA concentrations, and the viability rates were calculated after exposure to TEA. As summarized in Fig. 1, low concentrations of TEA ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 mm slightly decreased the viabilities of HeLa cells; in addition, with the increasing TEA concentrations from 2 to 30 mm, the viabilities decrease dramatically, especially between 36 and 48 h. When the TEA concentration was increased up to 20 mm at 36 h, the viability trend became stable. Based on these experimental data, 20 mm and 36 h were chosen as the experimental conditions for further studying the TEA cytotoxicity mechanism using proteomics tools. Using flow cytometry with PI staining, we analyzed changes of different cell growth phases after TEA exposure and further validated the drug effectiveness. Four growth phases both in the control and TEA treatment groups are clearly seen in Fig. 2. They are the apoptosis phase (Fig. 2, A–C), the G0/G1 phase (Fig. 2, A–D), the S phase (Fig. 2, A–E), and the G2/M phase (Fig. 2, A–F). The results show that TEA obviously changes cell phase distribution (Fig. 2B). The G0/G1 phase decreased from 71.3 to 43.8%, and there was a strong signal in the apoptosis phase in the TEA exposure group. Using annexin V-FITC/PI dual staining, the apoptosis rate increased from 2.1% in the control to 31.9% after exposure to 20 mm TEA for 36 h (Fig. 2C); this result is similar with that obtained from the PI staining method (Fig. 2A). The HeLa cells induced using TEA were then used to find differential proteins revealing the mechanism of cell apoptosis under conditions of 20 mm and a reactive time of 36 h. To determine the characteristics of KChs on the HeLa cell membrane, a whole-cell patch clamp was established to record outward K+ current (15Han X. Wang F. Yao W. Xing H. Weng D. Song X. Chen G. Xi L. Zhu T. Zhou J. Xu G. Wang S. Meng L. Iadecola C. Wang G. Ma D. Heat shock proteins and p53 play a critical role in K+ channel-mediated tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis.Apoptosis. 2007; 12: 1837-1846Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The results indicate that K+ current decreases up to 80.8% in the 10 mm TEA exposure group compared with the control (Fig. 3A). CHO cells were chosen to prove efficiency of TEA blocking. There is no KCh in the CHO cell, and after transfection with Kv2.1channel and steady expression of the Kv2.1 channel for 10 generations, it is named CHOKv2.1 (22Zhang Y. McKay S.E. Bewley B. Kaczmarek L.K. Repetitive firing triggers clustering of Kv2.1 potassium channels in aplysia neurons.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10632-10641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). TEA was selected to block Kv2.1, and the K+ current was measured again after blocking. The data prove that the K+ current of CHOKv2.1 is blocked by TEA up to 30% (Fig. 3B). Because there is only one Kv2.1 channel on the CHO cell membrane, the current altitude and blocking percentage are lower than that of the HeLa cell, which has much more complex KChs. Luo et al. (21Luo L.-Z. Jin H.-W. Huang H.-Q. Transferrin-cisplatin specifically deliver cisplatin to HepG2 cells in vitro and enhance cisplatin cytotoxicity.J. Proteomics. 2012; 77: 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) successfully identified 19 differential expressed proteins associated with apoptosis under CDDP treatment in HepG2 cell line; there were protein #1 14-3-3, #2 53BP, #3 AKT, #4 CASP3, #5 DNA-PK, #6 GADD45A, #7 GRB2, #8 MDC, #9 MTOR, #10 p21, #11 p27, #12 p38, #13 p53, #14 p78, #15 PCNA, #16 PLAA, #17 RAD51, #18 RFC, and #19 XRCC. RT-qPCR was used to analyze the mRNA expression levels of corresponding differential proteins of HeLa cells under TEA (20 mm), 4-AP (5 mm), and CDDP (2.0 μg/ml) exposure (Fig. 4). #1 14-3-3, #2 53BP, and #3 AKT show lower mRNA expression levels under both TEA and 4-AP inducement; whereas for #8 MDC and #11 P27, the TEA group has higher expression levels compared with the control group, and another 4-AP group has the lower ones. #15 PCNA, #16 PLAA, and #17 RAD51 show opposite expression tendencies between these two groups. These results meant that TEA could not only induce HeLa apoptosis by blocking KChs but also caused some potential apoptosis pathways by regulating transcriptional levels of cancer genes, as did CDDP. TEA and CDDP share the similar expression tendencies up to nine mRNAs; these are #2 53BP, #3 AKT, #4 CASP3, #6 GADD45A, #10 p21, #12 p38, #13 p53, #15 PCNA, and #17 RAD51. Especially for #6 GADD45A, which has a >10-fold change in both groups, its transcript level increased under stressful growth arrest conditions and functioned as tumor and autoimmune suppressors (29Salerno D.M. Tront J.S. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. Gadd45a and Gadd45b modulate innate immune functions of granulocytes and macrophages by differential regulation of p38 and JNK signaling.J. Cell Physiol. 2012; 227: 3613-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). GADD45A, a p53- and BRCA1-regulated stress-inducible gene, might induce a p53-dependent apoptosis pathway in this experiment due to significant changes of p53 expression levels under these two chemicals stresses (30Zhan Q. Gadd45a, a p53- and BRCA1-regulated stress protein, in cellular response to DNA damage.Mutat. Res. 2005; 569: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Moreover, these pathways are somewhat different than to those of 4-AP, and this can be due to blocking different subfamilies of KChs. 20 mm TEA was utilized to induce HeLa apoptosis for 36 h. The whole cell lysate extract from control and TEA treatment groups were separated using two-dimensional electrophoresis techniques. ImageMaster 2D Platinum software was used to analyze the differential proteins with the silver-staining method (Fig. 5, A and B). Quantitative image analysis using the proteomic software ImageMaster 2D Platinum Trail (V5.0) reveals 35 pro"
https://openalex.org/W2025708344,"Members of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family selectively cleave collagens in vivo. Several substrate structural features that direct MMP collagenolysis have been identified. The present study evaluated the role of charged residue clusters in the regulation of MMP collagenolysis. A series of 10 triple-helical peptide (THP) substrates were constructed in which either Lys-Gly-Asp or Gly-Asp-Lys motifs replaced Gly-Pro-Hyp (where Hyp is 4-hydroxy-L-proline) repeats. The stabilities of THPs containing the two different motifs were analyzed, and kinetic parameters for substrate hydrolysis by six MMPs were determined. A general trend for virtually all enzymes was that, as Gly-Asp-Lys motifs were moved from the extreme N and C termini to the interior next to the cleavage site sequence, kcat/Km values increased. Additionally, all Gly-Asp-Lys THPs were as good or better substrates than the parent THP in which Gly-Asp-Lys was not present. In turn, the Lys-Gly-Asp THPs were also always better substrates than the parent THP, but the magnitude of the difference was considerably less compared with the Gly-Asp-Lys series. Of the MMPs tested, MMP-2 and MMP-9 most greatly favored the presence of charged residues with preference for the Gly-Asp-Lys series. Lys-Gly-(Asp/Glu) motifs are more commonly found near potential MMP cleavage sites than Gly-(Asp/Glu)-Lys motifs. As Lys-Gly-Asp is not as favored by MMPs as Gly-Asp-Lys, the Lys-Gly-Asp motif appears advantageous over the Gly-Asp-Lys motif by preventing unwanted MMP hydrolysis. More specifically, the lack of Gly-Asp-Lys clusters may diminish potential MMP-2 and MMP-9 collagenolytic activity. The present study indicates that MMPs have interactions spanning the P23-P23' subsites of collagenous substrates."
