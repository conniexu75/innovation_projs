https://openalex.org/W2006383772,"Ferritin is a ubiquitous protein that plays a critical role in regulating intracellular iron homoeostasis by storing iron inside its multimeric shell. It also plays an important role in detoxifying potentially harmful free ferrous iron to the less soluble ferric iron by virtue of the ferroxidase activity of the H subunit. Although excess iron is stored primarily in cytoplasm, most of the metabolically active iron in cells is processed in mitochondria. Little is yet known of how these organelles regulate iron homeostasis and toxicity. Here we report an unusual intronless gene on chromosome 5q23.1 that encodes a 242-amino acid precursor of a ferritin H-like protein. This 30-kDa protein is targeted to mitochondria and processed to a 22-kDa subunit that assembles into typical ferritin shells and has ferroxidase activity. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that it accumulates in high amounts in iron-loaded mitochondria of erythroblasts of subjects with impaired heme synthesis. This new ferritin may play an important role in the regulation of mitochondrial iron homeostasis and heme synthesis."

Drugs that activate G protein-coupled receptors are classified as either agonists or partial agonists. To study the mechanism whereby these different classes of activating ligands modulate receptor function, we directly monitored ligand-induced conformational changes in the G protein-coupling domain of the β2 adrenergic receptor. Fluorescence lifetime analysis of a reporter fluorophore covalently attached to this domain revealed that, in the absence of ligands, this domain oscillates around a single detectable conformation. Binding to an antagonist does not change this conformation but does reduce the flexibility of the domain. However, when the β2 adrenergic receptor is bound to a full agonist, the G protein coupling domain exists in two distinct conformations. Moreover, the conformations induced by a full agonist can be distinguished from those induced by partial agonists. These results provide new insight into the structural consequence of antagonist binding and the basis of agonism and partial agonism.

G protein-coupled receptors β2adrenergic receptor fluorescein maleimide transmembrane (−)-isoproterenol (−)-alprenolol salbutamol dobutamine full width at half maximum G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 are remarkably versatile biological sensors. They are responsible for the majority of cellular responses to hormones and neurotransmitters, as well as for the senses of sight, smell, and taste. Our current models of the mechanism of GPCR activation by diffusible agonists have been deduced from indirect measures of receptor conformation, such as G protein or second messenger activation (1Tota M.R. Schimerlik M.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 996-1004PubMed Google Scholar, 2Selley D.E. Sim L.J. Xiao R. Liu Q. Childers S.R. Mol.

Gaivin R. Mathur M. Brown F. Graham R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 112-122PubMed Google Scholar). These indirect assays of GPCR activity provide only limited insight into the agonist-induced structural changes that define the active state of the receptor. To elucidate the mechanism of GPCR activation by diffusible agonists, we developed a means for directly monitoring the active conformation of purified, detergent-solubilized β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR) by site-specific labeling of an endogenous cysteine (Cys265) with fluorescein maleimide (FM-β2AR) (5Ghanouni P. Steenhuis J.J. Farrens D.L. Kobilka B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5997-6002Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Based on homology with rhodopsin (6Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5038) Google Scholar), Cys265 is located in the third intracellular loop (IC3) at the cytoplasmic end of the transmembrane 6 (TM6) α helix (Fig.1 A). Mutagenesis studies have shown this region of IC3 to be important for G protein coupling (7O'Dowd B.F. Hnatowich M. Regan J.W. Leader W.M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15985-15992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Liggett S.B. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Hnatowich M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4816-4821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An environmentally sensitive fluorophore covalently bound to Cys265 is therefore well positioned to detect agonist-induced conformational changes relevant to G protein activation. The effect of agonists and partial agonists on the fluorescence intensity of FM-β2AR correlates well with their biological properties (5Ghanouni P. Steenhuis J.J. Farrens D.L. Kobilka B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5997-6002Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Binding of the full agonist isoproterenol induces a conformational change that decreases the fluorescence intensity of FM bound to Cys265 by ∼15% (Fig. 1 B), whereas binding of partial agonists results in smaller changes in intensity, and binding of an antagonist has no effect (5Ghanouni P. Steenhuis J.J. Farrens D.L. Kobilka B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5997-6002Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Agonist-induced movement of FM bound to Cys265 was characterized by examining the interaction between the fluorescein at Cys265 and fluorescence quenching reagents localized to different molecular environments of the receptor. The results of these experiments are most consistent with either a clockwise rotation of TM6 and/or a tilting of the cytoplasmic end of TM6 toward TM5 (5Ghanouni P. Steenhuis J.J. Farrens D.L. Kobilka B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5997-6002Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that the conformational changes associated with β2AR activation are similar to those in rhodopsin (9Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar) and indicate a shared mechanism of GPCR activation. These results provide insight into the nature of the structural changes that occur upon agonist binding. However, several mechanistic questions remain. Using conventional spectroscopy, we observe no change in the fluorescence intensity from FM-β2AR upon antagonist binding. This could indicate that antagonists do not alter receptor structure or that the structural changes are not detectable by FM bound to Cys265. Of greater interest is the structural basis of partial agonism. Partial agonists induce a smaller change in intensity of FM-β2AR than do full agonists. Two models could explain this observation. If we assume that the receptor exists in two functional conformational states, inactive or active, then a partial agonist may simply induce a smaller fraction of receptors to undergo the transition to the active state than does the full agonist. Alternatively, partial agonists may induce a conformation distinct from that induced by full agonists. Conventional fluorescence spectroscopy, which represents an average intensity over a population of fluorescent molecules, does not allow us to distinguish between these two models. We therefore used fluorescence lifetime spectroscopy, which is capable of distinguishing substates within a population of fluorescent molecules, to look for ligand-specific conformational states. Our results indicate that partial agonists and agonists induce distinct conformations. Moreover, we observe structural effects of antagonist binding that could not be detected by conventional spectroscopy. These results help elucidate the structural mechanisms that underlie ligand efficacy. Construction, expression, and purification of human β2AR were performed as described (10Gether U. Lin S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28268-28275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Purified, detergent-solubilized, wild-type receptor was labeled with FM (Molecular Probes) as described previously (5Ghanouni P. Steenhuis J.J. Farrens D.L. Kobilka B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5997-6002Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The labeling procedure resulted in incorporation of 0.6 mol of FM per mol of receptor. Fluorescence spectroscopy experiments were performed on a SPEX Fluoromax spectrofluorometer with photon counting mode using an excitation and emission bandpass of 4.2 nm. Approximately 25 pmol of FM-labeled β2AR was diluted into 500 μl of 200 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1%n·dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, 100 mm mercaptoethanolamine. Excitation was at 490 nm, and emission was measured from 500 to 599 nm with an integration time of 0.3 s/nm for emission scan experiments. For time course experiments, excitation was at 490 nm, and emission was monitored at 517 nm. For anisotropy studies, fluorescence intensities were measured with excitation and emission polarizers in horizontal (H) and vertical (V) combinations. The G factor was calculated from the ratio of the intensities (I) ofIHV/IHH, and the anisotropy (r) was calculated from Equation 1. r=IVV−GIVHIVV+2GIVHEquation 1 For studies measuring ligand effects, no difference was observed when using polarizers in magic angle conditions. Unless otherwise indicated, all experiments were performed at 25 °C, and the sample always underwent constant stirring. The volume of the added ligands was ≤ 1% of total volume, and fluorescence intensity was corrected for this dilution in all experiments shown. All of the compounds tested had an absorbance of less than 0.01 at 490 and 517 nm in the concentrations used, excluding any inner filter effect in the fluorescence experiments. To determine fluorescence lifetimes, ∼250 pmol of FM-β2AR was diluted in 1.5 ml of 200 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1%n·dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, 100 mmmercaptoethanolamine and incubated for 10 min at 25 °C with or without ligand. Fluorescence lifetimes were measured using a frequency domain 10-GHz fluorometer equipped with a Hamamatsu 6-μm microchannel plate detector as described previously (11Laczko I.G.G. Gryczynski Z. Wiczk W. Malak H. Lakowicz J.R. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1990; 61: 2331-2337Crossref Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The instrument covered a wide frequency range (4–5000 MHz), which allowed detection of lifetimes ranging from several nanoseconds to a few picoseconds. Samples were placed in a 10-mm path length cuvette. The excitation was provided by the frequency-doubled output of a cavity-dumped pyridine-2 dye laser tuned at 370 nm synchronously pumped by a mode-locked argon ion laser. Sample emission was filtered through Corning 3–72 and 4–96 filters. For the reference signal, 4-(dimethylamino)-4′-cyanostilbene in methanol (463-ps fluorescence lifetime) was observed through the same filter combination. The governing equations for the time-resolved intensity decay data were assumed to be a sum of discrete exponentials as in Equation 2, I(t)=Io∑iαiet/τiEquation 2 where I(t) is the intensity decay,αi is the amplitude (pre-exponential factor), and τi is the fluorescence lifetime of the i-th discrete component or a sum of Gaussian distribution functions as in Equation 3, I(t)=Io∑iαi(τ)et/τiEquation 3 and Equation 4, αi(τ)=1σ2πe−121−τσ3Equation 4 where τ is the center value of the lifetime distribution, and ς is the standard deviation of the Gaussian, which is related to the full width at half maximum by 2.354 ς. In the frequency domain, the measured quantities at each frequency ω are the phase shift (φω) and demodulation factor (m ω) of the emitted light versusthe reference light. Fractional intensity, amplitude, and lifetime parameters were recovered by a non-linear least squares procedure using the software developed at the Center for Fluorescence Spectroscopy. The measured data were compared with calculated values (φ cω,m cω), and the goodness of fit was characterized by Equation 5, χR2=1υ∑ωφω−φcωδφ2+1υ∑ωmω−mcωδm2Equation 5 where υ is the number of degrees of freedom, andδφ and δm are the uncertainties in the measured phase and modulation values, respectively. The sum extends over all frequencies (ω). The β2AR was purified and labeled at Cys265 with fluorescein maleimide to generate FM-β2AR as described previously (5Ghanouni P. Steenhuis J.J. Farrens D.L. Kobilka B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5997-6002Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). We examined ligand-dependent changes in fluorescence lifetime of FM-β2AR in an effort to identify the existence of agonist-specific conformational states. Fluorescence lifetime analysis can detect discrete conformational states in a population of molecules, whereas fluorescence intensity measurements reflect the weighted average of one or more discrete states. Based on the changes in steady-state fluorescence intensity we observed, we predicted that ligand-induced conformational changes in the receptor would alter the fluorescence lifetime of the fluorophore. Fluorescence lifetime, τ, refers to the average time that a fluorophore that has absorbed a photon remains in the excited state before returning to the ground state. The lifetime of fluorescein (nanoseconds) is much faster than the predicted off-rate of the agonists we examined (μs-ms) and much shorter than the half-life of conformational states of bacteriorhodopsin (μs) (12Subramaniam S. Henderson R. Nature. 2000; 406: 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) or rhodopsin (ms) (13Farahbakhsh Z.T. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Science. 1993; 262: 1416-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 14Arnis S. Fahmy K. Hofmann K.P. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23879-23881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or of ion channels (μs-ms) (15Hoshi T. Zagotta W.N. Aldrich R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 249-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Therefore, lifetime analysis of fluorescein bound to Cys265 is well suited to capture even short-lived, agonist-induced conformational states. Data from fluorescence lifetime experiments on FM-β2AR bound to different drugs at equilibrium were analyzed in two ways. Traditionally, fluorescence decays are fit to single and multiple discrete exponential functions, and the best fit is determined by χ2 analysis (TableI). This discrete component analysis assumes that the receptor exists in one or a few rigid protein conformations and does not accurately reflect the dynamic nature of proteins. Proteins that are functionally in a single conformational state actually undergo small conformational fluctuations around a minimum energy state (16Frauenfelder H. Sligar S.G. Wolynes P.G. Science. 1991; 254: 1598-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (2613) Google Scholar), and these small structural perturbations can lead to small changes in the environment around an attached fluorophore. These perturbations are thought to reflect local unfolding reactions within the three-dimensional structure of proteins (17Freire E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11680-11682Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Such flexibility in protein structure can be modeled using fluorescence lifetime distributions (18Gratton E. Alcala R. Prendergast F.G. Jameson D.M. Fluorescent Biomolecules: Methodologies and Applications. Plenum Press, New York1989: 17-32Crossref Google Scholar), wherein the width of the distributions reflects the conformational flexibility of the protein (Fig.2). The mobility of fluorescein relative to the receptor is minimal, as determined by its high measured anisotropy (r = 0.30 ± 0.02; n = 3) and therefore would be expected to contribute little to the width of the lifetime distribution. Thus, the width of the distribution can be attributed to conformational flexibility in the receptor itself.Table IFluorescent lifetime data for FM-β2 AR in the presence and absence of drugs fit to discrete exponential functionsτ1 (ns)τ2(ns)α2χ2No drug4.22 ± 0.022.9 ± 0.4ALP4.21 ± 0.013.1 ± 0.8ISO4.30 ± 0.010.77 ± 0.050.19 ± 0.033.3 ± 1.0SAL4.35 ± 0.021.45 ± 0.160.08 ± 0.012.0 ± 0.2DOB4.36 ± 0.011.68 ± 0.30.07 ± 0.011.8 ± 0.4The observed fluorescence decay was resolved into one or more exponential components, with each component, i, being described by τi and αi , where αi represents the fractional contribution of τi to the overall decay. The best fit to single or multiple components was determined by χ2 analysis. If different agonists induce a single active state, then the fluorescence lifetime associated with that state (τR* ) should be the same for different drugs, and only the fractional contributions (αDRUG ) should differ. However, if there are agonist-specific conformational states we should observe unique, agonist-specific lifetimes (e.g. τISO , τSAL , and τDOB ).

However, if there are agonist-specific conformational states we should observe unique, agonist-specific lifetimes (e.g. τISO , τSAL , and τDOB ). Lifetime analysis of unliganded FM-β2AR reveals a single, flexible state. This is indicated by both the single, broad Gaussian distribution of lifetimes centered around 4.2 ns (Fig. 2, black trace) and the discrete component analysis, where the fluorescence decay rate of FM-β2AR in the absence of any drug is best fit by a single exponential function (Table I). Binding of the neutral antagonist ALP to FM-β2AR does not significantly change the fluorescent lifetime (Table I) but does narrow the distribution of lifetimes (Fig. 2, red trace), suggesting that ALP stabilizes the receptor and reduces conformational fluctuations. This interpretation is consistent with the results of experiments demonstrating that the β2AR is more resistant to protease digestion when bound to ALP (19Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7610-7618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, binding of the full agonist ISO promotes conformational heterogeneity. In the presence of saturating concentrations of ISO, FM-β2AR has two distinguishable fluorescence lifetimes (see Fig. 2, green trace, and TableI) representing at least two distinct conformational states. The long lifetime component is only slightly longer than the lifetime observed in the absence of drugs; however, the distribution is narrower than that observed in the presence of the antagonist ALP (Fig. 2,green and red traces). In contrast, the distribution of the short lifetime component observed in the presence of ISO is relatively broad, suggesting that there is considerable flexibility around Cys265 in this agonist-induced conformation. We next examined the effect of the partial agonists salbutamol (SAL) and dobutamine (DOB) on the fluorescence lifetime of FM-β2AR. Similar to ISO, we observed two lifetimes when the receptor was bound to saturating concentrations of SAL and DOB (see Table I and Fig. 3). The long lifetime component found in the presence of these two partial agonists is indistinguishable from that observed in the ISO-bound receptor; however, the short lifetime component found in both the SAL- and DOB-bound receptor is statistically different from that for the ISO-bound receptor. We observe a strong correlation between a reduction in fluorescence intensity of FM bound to Cys265 and drug efficacy (5Ghanouni P. Steenhuis J.J. Farrens D.L. Kobilka B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5997-6002Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), and shortening of the average fluorescence lifetime is associated with a reduction in fluorescence intensity. Therefore, the short lifetime, found only in the presence of agonists, likely represents the G protein-activating conformation of FM-β2AR. The different short lifetimes for the full agonist (ISO) and the partial agonists (SAL and DOB) indicate different molecular environments around the fluorophore and therefore represent different, agonist-specific active states. The narrowing and rightward shift of the long lifetime component following binding of both agonists and partial agonists indicate that this lifetime also reflects an agonist-bound state but most likely represents a more abundant intermediate state that would not be expected to alter greatly the intensity of FM bound to Cys265. It is possible that the number of conformations that we observe in these experiments represent only a few of the possible conformations that can be stabilized by drugs. Moreover, whereas the overlapping short lifetime distributions of SAL and DOB (see Fig. 3 B and Table I) suggest that they induce similar conformations, it is possible that a conformationally sensitive probe positioned elsewhere on the receptor could distinguish between DOB- and SAL-bound receptors states. According to the prevailing two-state model of GPCR activation, receptors exist in an equilibrium between a resting (R) state and an active (R*) state that stimulates the G protein (20Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lefkowitz R.J. Cotecchia S. Samama P. Costa T. Trends Pharmacol.

Agonists preferentially enrich the R* state, whereas inverse agonists select for the R state of the receptor. Neutral antagonists possess an equal affinity for both states and function simply as competitors. In this simple system, functional differences between drugs can be explained by their relative affinity for the single active R* state (Fig.4 A). Alternatively, differences in efficacy between drugs can be because of ligand-specific receptor states (23Kenakin T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 416-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 24Tucek S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 414-416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Strange P.G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 1081-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Based on our lifetime experiments, we propose a model with multiple, agonist-specific receptor states, wherein activation occurs through a sequence of conformational changes. Upon agonist binding, the receptor undergoes a conformational change to an intermediate state (R′) that is associated with a narrowing and rightward shift in the long lifetime distribution. The less abundant active state, represented by the short lifetime, is different for the full agonist ISO (R*) and the partial agonists DOB and SAL (Rx). The relatively slow, temperature-dependent rate of change of fluorescence intensity following agonist binding and the rapid rate of reversal by antagonist (see Ref. 5Ghanouni P. Steenhuis J.J. Farrens D.L. Kobilka B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5997-6002Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar and Fig. 1 B) suggest that transitions from the intermediate state to the active state are relatively rare high energy events. It is likely that in vivo the active conformation is further stabilized by interactions between the receptor and its cognate G protein Gs. Thus, one might expect the proportion of receptor in the active state to be greater when the receptor is coupled with Gs. Our results have implications for drug discovery and efforts to obtain high resolution crystal structures of GPCRs. The conformational flexibility observed in the ligand-free receptor (Fig.2) may make it particularly challenging to obtain crystals in the absence of a bound ligand. Of greater concern, the existence of two conformational states in the presence of saturating concentrations of full and partial agonists (Fig. 3) will impact efforts to obtain a high resolution structure of the active, agonist-bound receptor. If such an agonist-bound structure is obtained, it will likely represent the more energetically stable of the two conformations and may not be the maximally active conformation. Thus, the use of such a structure for rational drug design efforts may have significant limitations. In support of this contention, recent structural analyses of the intermediate conformational states of the proton pump bacteriorhodopsin have revealed discrepancies attributed to energetic inhibition of conformational states within the three-dimensional crystal (12Subramaniam S. Henderson R. Nature. 2000; 406: 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 26Sass H.J. Buldt G. Gessenich R. Hehn D. Neff D. Schlesinger R. Berendzen J. Ormos P. Nature. 2000; 406: 649-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Finally, our results indicate that GPCRs are relatively plastic. The number of conformations that we observed in these experiments may represent only a few of a larger spectrum of possible conformations that could be stabilized by drugs. Thus, it may be possible to identify even more potent agonists or agonists that can alter G protein coupling specificity."

Analysis of the difference of gene expression between quiescent and activated stellate cells has provided profound insights into the cell activation mechanism. For instance, subtractive hybridization revealed the expression of Zf9, a Kruppel-like transcription factor, at the initial step of the cell activation (6Ratziu V. Lalazar A. Wong L. Dang Q. Collins C. Shaulian E. Jensen S. Friedman S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9500-9505Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and that of cellular prion protein in fully activated stellate cells (7Ikeda K. Kawada N. Wang Y.Q. Kadoya H. Nakatani K. Sato M. Kaneda K. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 1695-1700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We have undertaken a proteomics approach to obtain a deeper knowledge on the molecular mechanism of hepatic stellate cell activation at the protein level (8Kristensen D.B. Kawada N. Imamura K. Miyamoto Y. Tateno C. Seki S. Kuroki T. Yoshizato K. Hepatology. 2000; 32: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Protein populations, proteomes, expressed in quiescent and activated stellate cells were separated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE)1 and subsequently analyzed using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (9Roepstorff P. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 10Yates III, J.R. J. Mass Spectrom. 1998; 33: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Such a protein level “differential display” identified 43 proteins that altered their expression levels during the activation process (8Kristensen D.B. Kawada N. Imamura K. Miyamoto Y. Tateno C. Seki S. Kuroki T. Yoshizato K. Hepatology. 2000; 32: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). These included the up-regulation of collagen α1(I), collagen α1(III), γ-actin, neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM), and smooth muscle α-actin in accordance with previous reports (11Knittel T. Aurisch S. Neubauer K. Eichhorst S. Ramadori G. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 449-462PubMed Google Scholar, 12Ramadori G. Veit T. Schwogler S. Dienes H.P. Knittel T. Rieder H. Meyer zum Buschenfelde K.H.

Pathol. 1993; 143: 538-544PubMed Google Scholar), and that of calcyclin, calgizzarin, and galectin-1, representing new findings (8Kristensen D.B. Kawada N. Imamura K. Miyamoto Y. Tateno C. Seki S. Kuroki T. Yoshizato K. Hepatology. 2000; 32: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In the present study, we report a novel protein that was discovered by proteome analysis of the activation process of rat hepatic stellate cells. The protein was found to be heavily up-regulated both inin vitro and in vivo activated stellate cells and was accordingly named STAP (stellate cellactivation-associated protein). Expression of STAP and its gene (stap) was dramatically augmented in fibrotic liver tissues induced by thioacetamide (TAA) administration, indicating an important role of STAP in the development of liver fibrosis. Pathogen-free male Wistar rats (SLC, Shizuoka, Japan) were administered with 50 mg/body of TAA (WAKO Pure Chemical Co., Osaka, Japan) intraperitoneally twice a week for 8 weeks (14Shea S.M. Manseau E.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1968; 52: 55-68PubMed Google Scholar). The protocol of experiments was approved by the Animal Research Committee of Osaka City University (Guide for Animal Experiments, Osaka City University). Hepatic constituent cells were isolated from rat livers as previously described (8Kristensen D.B. Kawada N. Imamura K. Miyamoto Y. Tateno C. Seki S. Kuroki T. Yoshizato K. Hepatology. 2000; 32: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 15Kawada N. Seki S. Inoue M. Kuroki T. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 1265-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and endothelial cells were used immediately after the isolation. Stellate cells were plated for 3 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the cultures were subsequently washed to remove dead cells and cell debris. Stellate cells isolated from normal or fibrotic livers were referred to as quiescent or in vivoactivated stellate cells, respectively, in the present study (8Kristensen D.B. Kawada N. Imamura K. Miyamoto Y. Tateno C. Seki S. Kuroki T. Yoshizato K. Hepatology. 2000; 32: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Likewise, stellate cells isolated from normal liver and cultured for 7 days were referred to as in vitro activated stellate cells (8Kristensen D.B. Kawada N. Imamura K. Miyamoto Y. Tateno C. Seki S. Kuroki T. Yoshizato K. Hepatology. 2000; 32: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional PAGE was performed as previously described (8Kristensen D.B. Kawada N. Imamura K. Miyamoto Y. Tateno C. Seki S. Kuroki T. Yoshizato K. Hepatology. 2000; 32: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 16O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol.

Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 430-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Proteins (100 μg) from liver cells were applied to Immobiline DryStrips (pH 4–7, 18 cm, Pharmacia Hoefer, Upsala, Sweden) by in-gel rehydration (18Rabilloud T. Valette C. Lawrence J.J. Electrophoresis. 1994; 15: 1552-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 19Sanchez J.C. Rouge V. Pisteur M. Ravier F. Tonella L. Moosmayer M. Wilkins M.R. Hochstrasser D.F. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 324-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). After isoelectric focusing, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 9–18% acrylamide gradient gels, visualized by silver staining, scanned, and analyzed using the Melanie II two-dimensional PAGE software package from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA). Protein spots of interest were excised from the two-dimensional gels and in-gel-digested with trypsin (8Kristensen D.B. Kawada N. Imamura K. Miyamoto Y. Tateno C. Seki S. Kuroki T. Yoshizato K. Hepatology. 2000; 32: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 17Kristensen D.B. Imamura K. Miyamoto Y. Yoshizato K. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 430-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). After extraction and purification from the tryptic digests (17Kristensen D.B. Imamura K. Miyamoto Y. Yoshizato K. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 430-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), peptides were sequenced by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry on a quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometer (8Kristensen D.B. Kawada N. Imamura K. Miyamoto Y. Tateno C. Seki S. Kuroki T. Yoshizato K. Hepatology. 2000; 32: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 17Kristensen D.B. Imamura K. Miyamoto Y. Yoshizato K. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 430-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The proteins were identified by matching the obtained amino acid sequences against the SwissProt and GenBankTM data bases. Total RNA was extracted from stellate cells and liver tissues using Isogen (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan). Messenger RNA expression in each sample was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using GeneAmp RNA PCR Core Kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The following primers were used: STAP, ATGGAGAAAGTGCCGGGCGAC (forward) and TGGCCCTGAAGAGGGCAGTGT (reverse); and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC (forward) and TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA (reverse). Degenerative PCR was performed using a primer pair, CCXGGXGAYTTYGARATHGA and GCXACXCCXACRTCYTC, designed from two amino acid sequences, PGDMEIER and ANCEDVGVA, which were derived by electrospray ionization mass spectrometric analysis of one protein spot later named STAP from two-dimensional gels of activated stellate cells. The template used was a cDNA library that was reverse-transcribed from total RNA of activated stellate cells using oligo(dT) primer, reverse transcriptase (SUPERSCRIPT II, Life Technologies, Inc.), and GeneAmp RNA PCR Core Kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The obtained 120-bp product was ligated into pGEM-T Easy vectors (Promega), and the sequence of the inserted DNA was determined using ABI PRISM 310. A rat-activated stellate cell cDNA library was inserted into Lambda Zap II vectors (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and screened using this 120-bp PCR product as a probe. Positive clones were in vivoexcised to pBluescript SK(−) following the manufacturer's protocol. A synthetic NH2-terminal polypeptide of STAP, NH2-MEKVPGDMEIERRERNEE+Cys-COOH, was used as an immunogen. This peptide fragment (0.2 mg) was immunized in rabbits first with complete Freund's adjuvant and then twice with incomplete Freund's adjuvant. After the third immunization was finished, the rabbits were sacrificed, and the serum was harvested. The antibody was affinity-purified against the synthetic peptide. The antibody produced a single band at 21 kDa in Western blot analysis of stellate cell homogenates and recognized monospecifically recombinant rat STAP the preparation of which is described below. Protein samples (10 μg of protein) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then were transferred onto Immobilon P membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). After blocking, the membranes were treated with antibodies against rat STAP, PDGF receptor-β (PDGFR-β, Santa Cruz, CA), N-CAM (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), smooth muscle α-actin (Dako), or glial fibrillary acidic protein (Dako) and then were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by using ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Fixed rat liver specimens (5-μm thickness) were incubated first with anti-smooth muscle α-actin antibodies (1:500) or anti-STAP antibodies (1:500) and then with biotinylated secondary antibodies (1:500, Dako), followed by color development using an ABC kit (Vectastain, Burlinbame, CA). For immunoelectron microscopy, 50-μm-thick sections were immunostained for STAP in a similar way as described above, postfixed in 1% osmium tetraoxide, dehydrated in ethanol, and embedded in Polybed (Polyscience, Warrington, PA). Thin sections were stained with saturated lead citrate and observed under a JEM-1200 EX electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) at 100 kV (7Ikeda K. Kawada N. Wang Y.Q. Kadoya H. Nakatani K. Sato M. Kaneda K. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 1695-1700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Digoxigenin-labeled cRNA probes were synthesized with a digoxigenin RNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Hybridization was carried out at 70 °C for 15 h in a buffer consisting of 50% deionized formamide, 5× SSC (3m NaCl and 0.3 m sodium citrate), 50 μg/mlEscherichia coli tRNA, 1% SDS, 50 μg/ml heparin, and 1 μg/ml heat-denatured, digoxigenin-labeled probes. The detection of hybridized cRNA probes was performed using 5-bromo-4-chloride-3-indolyl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described previously (20Asahina K. Utoh R. Obara M. Yoshizato K. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 89-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Some sections were subsequently subjected to immunohistochemistry using anti-desmin antibodies (Monosan, Uden, The Netherlands) and fluorescein-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories). The open reading frame of cloned rat STAP cDNA was ligated into pTrcHis2 TOPO vectors (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). His6-tagged STAP was generated in TOP10 cells cultured overnight in LB medium supplemented with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Wako Pure Chemical Co., Osaka, Japan). STAP was purified under native conditions using nickel-NTA agarose resins (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Absorption spectra of rat recombinant STAP dissolved in PBS at pH 7.4 were obtained at 25 °C using a Hitachi spectrophotometer U-2001 (Hitachi, Tokyo) in the presence or absence of Na2S2O4. A peroxidase activity of recombinant STAP was measured as follows. Purified STAP was separated by 15% native PAGE and then transferred electrically onto Immobilon-P membranes. After washing with PBS twice, the membranes were treated with either 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB)/hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) solution or ECL chemiluminescence solution (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Peroxidase-dependent reaction products were detected either directly on the membranes or on the Kodak XAR5 films. The presence of protoheme in STAP was determined by the pyridine hemochrome method (21Takaichi S. Morita S. J. Biochem. 1981; 89: 1513-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In brief, the purified STAP was converted to a pyridine hemochrome by the addition of 0.5 ml of pyridine and 0.5 ml of 0.5 N NaOH solution to 4.0 ml of the protein solution. Absorption spectra of this mixture were scanned at 25 °C using a Hitachi spectrophotometer U-2001 (Hitachi, Tokyo) in the presence or absence of Na2S2O4. Catalase activity of STAP was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the decrease of H2O2 at 240 nm in 50 mm PBS buffer in the absence or presence of STAP (22Kawamoto S. Tanaka A. Yamamura M Teranishi Y. Fukui S. Osumi M. Arch. Microbiol. 1977; 112: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Fatty acid hydroperoxide peroxidase activity was determined according to a modified version of the Kharasch's method (23Kharasch E.D. Novak R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10645-10652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conjugated diene formation was initiated in the presence or absence of recombinant STAP by adding 30 mm FeCl2 into a reaction mixture of 30 mm NaCl, 1 mm linoleic acid, 20 mmlinoleic acid hydroperoxide, and 0.16% Lubrol PX, pH 7.0. The reaction was monitored at 234 nm. We investigated the overall protein expression pattern of quiescent, in vitroactivated, and in vivo activated stellate cells to obtain a general insight into changes of the activation-associated proteins and to identify them (8Kristensen D.B. Kawada N. Imamura K. Miyamoto Y. Tateno C. Seki S. Kuroki T. Yoshizato K. Hepatology. 2000; 32: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). As depicted in Fig.1A, one protein spot with a pI value of 6 and a molecular mass of 21 kDa was found to be remarkably up-regulated in both in vivo and in vitro activated stellate cells. The protein was digested with trypsin and the peptides produced were sequenced by quadrupole-time-of-flight flight mass spectrometry. As a result two partial sequences were obtained: PGDME(I/L)ER and ANCEDVGVA. Neither was listed in SwissProt or GenBankTM, indicating that this was a novel protein. Therefore, we undertook cDNA cloning of the gene. Degenerative PCR was performed using cDNA produced from total RNA of activated stellate cells as a template. Primer pairs were designed from the two obtained amino acid sequences: CCXGGXGAYTTYGARATHGA and GCXACXCCXACRTCYTC. The PCR amplified a single band at 120 bp (data not shown). DNA sequencing revealed that the deduced amino acid sequence actually contained the two above-mentioned peptide fragments (Fig. 1B). A rat-activated stellate cell cDNA library was screened using the 120-bp DNA as a probe, which yielded a 2028-bp-long cDNA clone. The open reading frame consisted of 570 bp that encoded 190 amino acids (Fig.1C). The calculated molecular weight was 21,496. The amino acid sequence showed about 40% homology with myoglobin and indicated that this protein was a cytoplasmic protein according to the Reinhardt's criterion (24Reinhardt A. Hubbard T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2230-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). We named this novel protein STAP afterstellate cell activation-associatedprotein. Polyclonal antibodies against STAP were raised using its synthetic NH2-terminal 18 peptides. Western blot analysis with these antibodies revealed that STAP protein was time dependently induced in culture-stimulated stellate cells in a manner similar to the expression pattern of N-CAM (11Knittel T. Aurisch S. Neubauer K. Eichhorst S. Ramadori G. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 449-462PubMed Google Scholar), smooth muscle α-actin (12Ramadori G. Veit T. Schwogler S. Dienes H.P. Knittel T. Rieder H. Meyer zum Buschenfelde K.H. Virchows Arch. B. Cell Pathol. Incl. Mol. Pathol. 1990; 59: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), and PDGF receptor-β (25Pinzani M. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 997-999PubMed Google Scholar) in contrast to the constant expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (Fig.2A). The augmented STAP expression was also seen in in vivo activated stellate cells isolated from fibrotic liver induced by TAA administration for 8 weeks (Fig. 2B). RT-PCR showed that the expression of STAP mRNA was consistently augmented in the process of the stellate cell activation (Fig. 2, A and B). Two-dimensional PAGE analysis showed that neither endothelial cells, Kupffer cells, nor hepatocytes isolated from normal or TAA-induced fibrotic liver expressed detectable amounts of STAP (Fig.2C). Immunoelectron microscopy not only supported these observations (Fig. 2D, a and b), but also revealed a negligible expression in bile duct epithelial cells and a significant expression in myofibroblasts located in the portal area (Fig. 2D, c). The treatment of rats with TAA induces the liver fibrosis and finally cirrhosis (14Shea S.M. Manseau E.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1968; 52: 55-68PubMed Google Scholar). The parenchymal architecture underwent distinct changes, developing thick bundles at 8 weeks of the treatment (Fig.3A, a andd). Immunohistochemistry confirmed the previous report (4Kawada N. Histol. Histopathol. 1997; 12: 1069-1080PubMed Google Scholar,11Knittel T. Aurisch S. Neubauer K. Eichhorst S. Ramadori G. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 449-462PubMed Google Scholar, 12Ramadori G. Veit T. Schwogler S. Dienes H.P. Knittel T. Rieder H. Meyer zum Buschenfelde K.H. Virchows Arch. B. Cell Pathol. Incl. Mol. Pathol. 1990; 59: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) that the expression of smooth muscle α-actin, a marker of activated stellate cells, was augmented in fibrotic liver particularly along the fibrotic septum (compare Fig. 3A, b ande). STAP immunoreactivity was strong around the portal area and also weakly seen sporadically in the normal parenchyma (Fig.3A, c). These weakly positive cells were identified as stellate cells by their locations and morphology. The reactivity was significantly increased particularly in the fibrotic septa in the TAA-treated animals (Fig. 3A, f).In situ hybridization revealed that STAP mRNA expression was augmented in fibrotic liver exclusively along the septum but not in the albumin mRNA-expressing hepatocytes (Fig. 3A,g–j). A section of fibrotic liver tissues was used forin situ hybridization of STAP (Fig. 3A,k) and was subsequently subjected to immunohistochemistry of desmin, a stellate cell marker (Fig. 3A, l). These double staining experiments showed a specific expression of STAP in stellate cells in in vivo. Analyses using Western blot and RT-PCR confirmed that the expression of STAP protein and mRNA was augmented with increased severity of liver fibrosis (Fig.3B). His6-tagged recombinant rat STAP was purified under native conditions using a nickel-NTA agarose column. Aliquots of samples at each step of the purification were run on 15% SDS-PAGE gels as depicted in Fig.4A. The eluted protein from the column made a single band at the predicted position of molecular weights and the solution was brown-colored. Absorption spectra of rat recombinant STAP under non-reducing conditions exhibited peaks at 415 and 531 nm (Fig. 4B). When the protein was suspended in a solution containing sodium dithionite, its absorption spectra exhibited peaks at 427, 531, and 560 (Fig. 4B), indicating that STAP was a heme protein (26Eaton W.A. Hofrichter J. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 175-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Characterization of STAP by the pyridine hemochrome method (21Takaichi S. Morita S. J. Biochem. 1981; 89: 1513-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) indicated that protoheme was a component of STAP protein (data not shown). The presence of heme was further supported by the fact that the recombinant STAP showed a peroxidase activity as revealed by the development of brown color in DAB/H2O2 reaction and chemiluminescence in the ECL reaction (Fig. 4C). The actual presence of peroxidase activity was determined by a H2O2 degradation assay wherein the recombinant STAP was tested whether it has an H2O2-catabolizing activity. STAP was found to have 4.5 munits/mg of catalase activity. Furthermore, STAP was found to suppress conjugated diene formation in a dose-dependent manner when the protein was added in the fatty acid peroxidation reaction, the half-maximal inhibition occurring at ∼50 nmSTAP (Fig. 4D). These results conclusively demonstrated that STAP is a novel cytosolic protein with a peroxidase activity. The activation of hepatic stellate cells is a key step for the development of liver fibrosis (1Friedman S.L. J. Biol.

Growth factors, such as PDGF, TGF-α, and TGF-β, and reactive oxygen species as well as lipid peroxides produced by intoxicated hepatocytes are thought to trigger the stellate cell activation (1Friedman S.L.

Brenner D.A. Rippe R.A. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2000; 279: G1333-G1342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to these conventional methods recent advancements of mass spectrometry have permitted us to analyze proteins in cells and organs on a large scale (9Roepstorff P. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 10Yates III, J.R. J. Mass Spectrom. 1998; 33: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Previously our proteome analysis of the stellate cell activation identified a total of 43 proteins/polypeptides that consistently altered their expression levels when the cells were activated (8Kristensen D.B. Kawada N. Imamura K. Miyamoto Y. Tateno C. Seki S. Kuroki T. Yoshizato K. Hepatology. 2000; 32: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). These included the up-regulated proteins such as galectin-1, calcyclin, and calgizzarin, and the down-regulated proteins such as liver carboxylesterase 10 and serine protease inhibitor 3 (8Kristensen D.B. Kawada N. Imamura K. Miyamoto Y. Tateno C. Seki S. Kuroki T. Yoshizato K. Hepatology. 2000; 32: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Thus, protein level “differential display” using proteomics is evidently a powerful approach for displaying protein expression patterns in activated stellate cells. In addition to the known proteins mentioned above, the proteome analysis performed in the present study revealed an unknown protein, dubbed STAP, which was highly up-regulated during the stellate cell activation. STAP represents a novel protein because it has little homology with existing entries in the protein data bases. According to the PSORT II protein analysis STAP has no endoplasmic reticulum retention motif, membrane retention signal, peroxisomal targeting signal, RNA-binding motif, actin-binding motif, DNA-binding motif, and ribosomal protein motif. STAP is a cytoplasmic protein according to the Reinhardt's criterion for cytoplasmic/nuclear discrimination (24Reinhardt A. Hubbard T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2230-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). This is supported by the immunoelectron microscopic observations, which showed that STAP immunoreactivity is ubiquitously seen in the cytoplasm of stellate cells. A further proof hereof was the fact that STAP was only detected in cellular lysates and not in the medium wherein stellate cells had been cultured (data not shown). During the preparation of this manuscript, a protein whose amino acid sequence is almost identical to that of rat STAP has been listed in the protein data base (NCBI accession number BAB31709). The corresponding cDNA was cloned from the brain of 13-day mouse embryo. The amino acid sequence of this protein (the mouse homologue of STAP) has a 97% identity to rat STAP. We have already cloned the cDNA of human STAP, which showed a 90% identity to rat STAP. 2N. Kawada, D. B. Kristensen, K. Asahina, K. Nakatani, Y. Minamiyama, S. Seki, and K. Yoshizato, manuscript in preparation. Immunohistochemistry in the present report showed that STAP expression is restricted to stellate cells in the liver parenchyma and myofibroblast-like cells around the portal vein in the normal liver. These cells are known to be able to express smooth muscle α-actin and to store vitamin A (38Serini G. Gabbiani G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 39Nagy N.E. Holven K.B. Roos N. Senoo H. Kojima N. Norum K.R. Blomhoff R. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 645-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this context, STAP might be a suitable new marker for retinol metabolizing myofibroblasts. Our spectrophotometric analysis of recombinant rat STAP clearly demonstrated that STAP is a heme protein. In general, heme proteins act as one of the following three: (i) oxygen transporters like hemoglobin and myoglobin, (ii) electron transporters like cytochrome P450, and (iii) enzymes with peroxidase activity like horseradish peroxidase. Although we have not proved it yet, STAP might be an intracellular oxygen transporter because this protein has a 40% amino acid sequence homology with myoglobin. This speculation is reasonable because the oxygen-dependent cellular contractility is augmented in activated stellate cells that are enriched in contractile proteins such as actin and myosin (1Friedman S.L.

This hypothesis is also supported because the induction kinetics of STAP after the treatment with a fibrosis inducer were similar to those of smooth muscle α-actin as shown in the present study. From a functional point of view, the induction of STAP in activated stellate cells is understandable because stellate cells are increasingly exposed to endogenous H2O2, lipid hydroperoxides and trans-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal during chronic liver trauma (36Wang S.C.

Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Scavenging of radical-derived organic peroxides by STAP could be an adaptive reaction to normalize the cellular redox status during the cell activation. STAP as well as glutathione (43Maher J.J. Saito J.M. Neuschwander-Tetri B.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) could compensate the redox imbalance caused by a down-regulation of glutathione S-transferases in the activated stellate cells, which counteracts the toxic effects of lipid peroxidation (42Whalen R. Rockey D.C. Friedman S.L. Boyer T.D. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 927-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). From a clinical point of view, STAP could be a suitable marker for liver fibrosis and activated stellate cells in the histochemical study. However, STAP is not a secreted protein and, therefore, cannot be used as a serum marker. Our preliminary study reveled that STAP is evidently expressed in stellate cells and also in diseased liver tissues of human (data not shown). In summary, we have isolated a novel protein named STAP from hepatic stellate cells using proteomics. STAP was expressed in stellate cells and myofibroblasts in the normal liver and is dramatically up-regulated in the course of the stellate cell activation at both mRNA and protein level. This suggests a close relationship between the STAP induction and the liver fibrosis. Functional analysis using a recombinant rat STAP revealed that this protein is a new heme protein with a peroxidase activity against H2O2 and linoleic acid hydroperoxides. We thank Profs. S.

However, in the absence of IL-3, increased expression of Bcl2 can also prolong cell survival. To determine how Bcl2 may be functionally phosphorylated following IL-3 withdrawal, astress-activated Bcl2 kinase (SAK) was sought. Results indicate that anisomycin, a potent activator of the stress kinase JNK/SAPK, can induce Bcl2 phosphorylation at Ser70 and that JNK1 can be latently activated following IL-3 withdrawal to mediate Bcl2 phosphorylation. JNK1 directly phosphorylates Bcl2 in vitro, co-localizes with Bcl2, and collaborates with Bcl-2 to mediate prolonged cell survival in the absence of IL-3 or following various stress applications. Dominant-negative (DN)-JNK1 can block both anisomycin and latent IL-3 withdrawal-induced Bcl2 phosphorylation (>90%) and potently enhances cell death. Furthermore, low dose okadaic acid (OA), a potent protein phosphatase 1 and 2A inhibitor, can activate the mitogen-activated protein kinases JNK1 and ERK1/2, but not p38 kinase, to induce Bcl2 phosphorylation and prolong cell survival in factor-deprived cells. Since PD98059, a specific MEK inhibitor, can only partially inhibit OA-induced Bcl2 phosphorylation but completely blocks OA-induced Bcl2 phosphorylation in cells expressing DN-JNK1, this supports the conclusion that OA may stimulate Bcl2 phosphorylation via a mechanism involving both JNK1 and ERK1/2. Collectively, these findings indicate a novel role for JNK1 as a SAK and may explain, at least in part, how functional phosphorylation of Bc12 can occur in the absence of growth factor.

Pharmacother. 1997; 31: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).Bcl2 is the first identified survival gene involved in the control of apoptosis (2Gajewski T.F. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1996; 87: 589-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Greater than 15 Bcl2 family members, representing both anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic members, have been identified to date in mammalian cells and viruses (3Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4780) Google Scholar). Results have suggested potential mechanism(s) by which Bcl2 functions including: (a) heterodimerization with its proapoptotic partner, Bax (4Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5838) Google Scholar); (b) maintenance of mitochondrial integrity (5Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and (c) pore formation or channel function (6Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D.

Recent reports have demonstrated that the phosphorylation of Bcl2 may regulate its function (8May W.S. Tyler P.G. Ito T. Armstrong D.K. Qatsha K.A. Davidson N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26865-26870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Haldar S. Jena N. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We previously reported that the multipotential growth factor IL-31 activates both a PKC-dependent and independent (i.e. ERK1/2) survival signaling pathway that features Bcl2 phosphorylation at Ser70, and phosphorylation of Bcl2 at Ser70 may be required for full and potent anti-apoptotic function (12Ito T.

Thus, if phosphorylation is required for Bcl2s full and potent antiapoptotic function, how might Bcl2 phosphorylation occur under these conditions? To experimentally address this question, we hypothesized the existence of astress-activated Bcl2 kinase (SAK).The c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) are classic stress-activated protein kinases (15Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar). JNKs are potently and preferentially activated following various cell stress applications including UV irradiation (16Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar), heat and osmotic shock (16Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin.

Chem. 1996; 271: 30950-30955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). JNK is also activated in response to cell stress induced by certain DNA-damaging agents including 1-β-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine (22), cis-platinum, and mitomycin C (22Kharbanda S. Ren R. Pandey P. Shafman T.D. Feller S.M. Weichselbaum R.R. Kufe D.W. Nature. 1995; 376: 785-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Recently, JNK has been implicated in the regulation of apoptosis (23Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I. Barrett T. Su Bing Deng Tiliang Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2949) Google Scholar, 24Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3593) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism(s) and functional role for JNK in the regulation of apoptosis are not clear (24Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3593) Google Scholar). On the one hand, reports suggest that activation of JNK can be associated with induction of apoptosis. For example, it was found that nerve growth factor withdrawal from post-mitotic rat PC12 pheochromocytoma cells resulted in JNK activation in association with apoptosis (18Le-Niculescu H. Bonfoco E. Kasuya Y. Claret F.X. Green D.R. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 751-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 25Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5027) Google Scholar). JNK is also activated following other stress applications including irradiation, tumor necrosis factor-α, or Fas-ligand treatment (FasL; 26, 27). In addition, in both sympathetic neurons and PC12 cells, expression of a dominant-negative mutant of c-Jun, or microinjection of c-Jun neutralizing antibodies, are able to inhibit apoptosis (28Estus S. Zaks W.J. Freeman R.S. Gruda M. Bravo R. Johnson E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1717-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 29Ham J. Babij C. Whitfield J. Pfarr C.M. Lallemand D. Yaniv M. Rubin L.L. Neuron. 1995; 14: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). These data also suggest that phosphorylation of c-Jun by JNK is closely associated with apoptosis. However, these studies did not indicate a potential mechanism by which JNK activation and/or c-Jun phosphorylation might trigger apoptosis. Interestingly, it has recently been proposed that the JNK/c-Jun/FasL signaling pathway may play a role in induction of neuronal cell death in response to various stresses via up-regulation of FasL expression (18Le-Niculescu H. Bonfoco E. Kasuya Y. Claret F.X. Green D.R. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 751-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). On the other hand, evidence has been reported that JNK activation is involved in cell survival. Epidermal growth factor or phorbol ester treatment of cells induces activation of JNK in association with cell survival (23Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I. Barrett T. Su Bing Deng Tiliang Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2949) Google Scholar). Lymphocytes deficient in upstream activation of JNK by JNKK1/SEK1 are reported to be more sensitive to Fas-mediated apoptosis (30Nishina H. Fishcher K.D. Radvanyi L. Shahinian A. Hakem R. Rubies E.A. Bernstein A. Mak T.W. Woodgett J.R. Penninger J.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), suggesting that JNK activation is required for prolonged cell survival following a stress event. In support of this notion, lymphocytes from TRAF2−/− mice, which are defective in JNK activation, are highly sensitive to tumor necrosis factor-induced apoptosis (31Yeh W. Shahinian A. Speiser D. Kraunus J. Billia F. Wakeham A. Pompa J, L. Ferrick D. Hum B. Iscove N. Ohashi P. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Immunity. 1997; 7: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Even stronger evidence in favor of this hypothesis derives from the analysis of compound mutant JNK1−/−JNK2−/− embryos that exhibit increased apoptosis within the developing forebrain (32Kuan C.Y. Yang D.D. Samanta Roy D.R. Davis R.J. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Neuron. 1999; 22: 667-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar, 33Sabapathy K. Jochum W. Hochedlinger K. Chang L. Karin M. Wager E.F. Mech. Dev. 1999; 89: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been reported that integrin-mediated survival signaling can be mediated by the JNK pathway (34Almeida E.A. Iiic D. Han Q. Hauck C.R. Jin F. Kawakatsu H. Schlaepfer D.D. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 741-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Therefore, the JNKs may potentially play a dual role (i.e. both positive or negative) in regulating apoptosis. Our findings indicate that JNK1 can serve as both a SAK and an IL-3/agonist-activated Bcl2 kinase involved in Bcl2 regulation. Thus, JNK1, as an SAK, may be important for prolonged survival following stress stimuli that otherwise would lead to rapid cell death.DISCUSSIONSince phosphorylation of Bcl2 may be required for its full and potent antiapoptotic activity (12Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), a SAK was postulated to help explain why WT but not the non-phosphorylated S70A Bcl2 mutant could prolong cell survival following IL-3 withdrawal or treatment with some stress applications. Evidence reported here suggests that JNK1 is a SAK. First, stress stimuli such as IL-3 withdrawal or OA treatment were found to activate JNK1 either latently or rapidly, respectively, in close association with Bcl2 phosphorylation and prolonged cell survival as compared with cells expressing S70A Bcl2. Second, DN-JNK1 was able to block Bcl2 phosphorylation and prolong survival following these stress applications. Third, JNK1 was found to co-localize with Bcl2 in the mitochondria and could directly phosphorylate Bcl2 at Ser70 in vitro. Collectively, these findings provide strong evidence that JNK1 is a physiologic SAK. IL-3 withdrawal is a potent physiological stress that leads to apoptosis but can be delayed if WT Bcl2 is expressed. Our findings demonstrate that IL-3 withdrawal can result in the latent activation of JNK1 (up to 3-fold) in close association with Bcl2 phosphorylation at Ser70. In contrast, the other MAPKs, ERKs1/2 and p38, are not latently activated or are inactivated upon IL-3 withdrawal, indicating that MAPKs other than JNK1 are probably not involved in latent Bcl2 phosphorylation. These findings may explain, at least in part, how Bc12 can prolong cell survival during stress.Recent reports from our laboratory demonstrated that OA can induce Bcl2 phosphorylation at Ser70, suggesting a role for an OA-sensitive Bcl2 phosphatase in regulating phosphorylation (35Deng X. Ito T. Carr B. Mumby M. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34157-34163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Results reported here mechanistically extend these findings and indicate that OA-induced Bcl2 phosphorylation may occur as a result of the combined activation of the ERKs1/2 and JNK1 by a mechanism that involves the inhibition of a PP2A-like phosphatase activity since the combination of DN-JNK1 and PD98059 can completely block OA-induced Bcl2 phosphorylation. Also, whether the OA-activated death/survival pendulum sways one way or the other may depend on the concentration(s) of OA used. Results indicate that at low concentrations of OA (i.e. 10 nm), which can selectively inhibit PP2A but not PP1 (35Deng X. Ito T. Carr B. Mumby M. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34157-34163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), survival dramatically increases in cells expressing WT but not the non-phosphorylatable S70A Bcl2 following IL-3 withdrawal (Fig. 1). These findings further support and extend our previous findings that prolonged cell survival is dependent upon an intact Ser70 Bcl-2 phosphorylation site (12Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar).The findings indicate that while anisomycin treatment of cells does not prolong survival in the absence of IL-3 (Fig. 6 D), anisomycin also does not significantly increase the rate of cell death under these conditions (Fig. 6 D), even though anisomycin is reported to be toxic to cells by inhibiting protein synthesis (39Shu J. Hitomi M. Sacey D. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2421-2430PubMed Google Scholar). This may potentially be explained since anisomycin provides a potential survival signal by activating JNK1 and resulting in Bcl2 phosphorylation (Fig. 6 C). However, any survival advantage gained by inducing Bc12 phosphorylation may, under certain circumstances, be opposed by a toxic effect such as the inhibition of protein synthesis with the outcome being neutral with respect to survival.While a precise role for JNK1 in the regulation of programmed cell death is not clear (31Yeh W. Shahinian A. Speiser D. Kraunus J. Billia F. Wakeham A. Pompa J, L. Ferrick D. Hum B. Iscove N. Ohashi P. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W.

Science. 1998; 282: 191-194Crossref Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Such discrepancies in the published literature may be due, at least in part, to specific cell type differences. Our findings clearly indicate that activated JNK1 can cooperate with WT Bcl2 to prolong cell survival in factor-dependent cells following stress applications that would otherwise lead to rapid cell death. These findings are also consistent with other reports that JNK1 can phosphorylate Bcl2 (19; 20). Thus, DN-JNK1 not only can block stress-induced Bcl2 phosphorylation but can also promote a more rapid cell death following such applications (Fig. 6 D). These data strongly suggest that the functional role of JNK1 as a SAK is to prolong cell survival following stress which, under some circumstances, may represent only an agonal attempt to maintain the antiapoptotic function of Bc12.Interestingly, our findings indicate that JNK1 is not only latently activated following IL-3 withdrawal but also can be rapidly activated following the addition of the survival agonists IL-3 or Bryo. These findings support the notion that JNK1 may play a dual role in both IL-3-mediated survival and stress-activated signaling relative to cell survival (Fig. 8). The dynamics of IL-3-induced JNK1 activation and Bcl2 phosphorylation is rapid (15–30 min) and reversible (Fig. 8) (35Deng X. Ito T. Carr B. Mumby M. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34157-34163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), while that for activation of JNK1 and Bcl2 phosphorylation is latent, being observed only between 6 and 12 h following IL-3 withdrawal (Fig. 2, A and B). Any differential mechanism(s) for early versus latent activation of JNK1 are not yet clear, and further studies will be required. The rapid activation of JNK1 may result from PKC activation that occurs following IL-3 addition to cells because bryostatin-1, a potent PKC activator and survival stimulator in factor-dependent cells (8May W.S. Tyler P.G. Ito T. Armstrong D.K. Qatsha K.A. Davidson N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26865-26870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), can also rapidly activate cellular JNK1 (Fig. 8). On the other hand, latent activation of JNK1, which may account for prolonged cell survival following stress, does not appear to involve PKC or other MAPKs, including the ERKs or p38 kinase (Fig. 2). Presently, how JNK1 is latently activated remains to be determined. Interestingly, only the WT, phosphorylatable Bcl-2 but not the non-phosphorylatable S70A Bcl2 can prolong cell survival following stress, clearly indicating a requirement for an intact Ser70 site for Bcl2s potent antiapoptotic function following stress. Bryostatin-1 can stimulate JNK1 activity, suggesting that PKC may somehow act as an upstream activator of JNK1, at least in IL-3 dependent cells. Interestingly, since DN-JNK1 can only partially inhibit IL-3-induced Bcl2 phosphorylation, this provides further strong evidence that JNK1 may also play a role in agonist-induced Bcl2 phosphorylation. Since the activity of JNK1/SAPK has been reported to be inhibited by the potent PKC inhibitor, staurosporine (46Yue T.L. Wang C. Romnic A.M. Kikly K. Keller P. DeWolf W.E. Hart T.K. Thomas H.C.

Cell Cardiol. 1998; 30: 495-507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), this would help to explain why the combination of staurosporine and PD98059 can completely inhibit IL-3-induced Bcl2 phosphorylation (14Deng X.

Life Sci. 1997; 53: 737-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of Bcl2 by a microtubule-damaging agent such as paclitaxel has also been proposed to inactivate Bcl2 (19Srivastava R.K. Mi Q.S. Hardwick J.M. Longo D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3775-3780Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 20Yamamoto K. Ichijo H. Korsmeyer S. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1998; 18: 3509-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Inactivation by paclitaxel is thought to occur when Bcl2 is phosphorylated at two other residues (Thr69 and Ser87) in addition to Ser70 (i.e.multiple-site phosphorylation) (20Yamamoto K. Ichijo H. Korsmeyer S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8469-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that multiple-site phosphorylation may differ functionally from Ser70 mono-site phosphorylation to regulate Bcl2s antiapoptotic function, perhaps by inducing an additional conformational change. While further work will be required to explain the mechanism, it should be noted that paclitaxel can also act directly on mitochondria isolated from human cancer cells to mediate the release of cytochrome c and activate caspases that initiate apoptosis in a mechanism apparently independent of Bcl2 (52Andre N. Braguer D. Brasseur G. Goncalves A. Lemesle D. Guise S. Jordan M.A. Guise S. Jordan M.A. Briand C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5349-5353PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the role of multisite Bcl2 phosphorylation in paclitaxel-induced death is mechanistically unclear.Our findings indicate that JNK1-induced phosphorylation of Bcl2 may be required to facilitate prolonged survival following stress conditions that ultimately lead to cell death if not reversed. The mechanism(s) by which phosphorylation can enhance Bcl2s function is not yet clear but, at least in part, phosphorylation appears to maintain a stable association between Bcl2 and its proapoptotic partner, Bax (14Deng X. Ruvolo P. Carr B.K. May W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1578-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In addition, phosphorylation of Bcl2 has been recently reported to prevent degradation and thereby prolong the expression and presumably the antiapoptotic function of Bcl2 (49Dimmeler S. Breitschopf K. Haendeler J. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1815-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Thus, inhibition of Bcl2 degradation, either by suppressing a ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal pathway or by mimicking continuous phosphorylation of the putative phosphorylation sites in Bcl2, was able to confer cell resistance to apoptosis (49Dimmeler S. Breitschopf K. Haendeler J. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1815-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). With respect to a functional role for stress-induced Bcl2 phosphorylation by JNK1, our findings suggest a novel mechanism by which Bcl2 may protect cells from apoptosis following various stress applications. Thus, JNK1 may play an important role in regulating apoptosis through phosphorylation of Bcl2 (Fig.9). These findings would help to explain the apparent paradox between JNK activation and cell survival or death. Furthermore, these findings suggest that a novel antineoplastic strategy may be to inactivate Bcl2 by inhibiting the SAK, JNK1. Apoptosis is a highly organized, physiologic mechanism of destroying injured and abnormal cells. Apoptosis is implicated in the regulation of development, differentiation, and homeostasis (1Dixon S.C. Soriano B.J. Lush R.M. Borner M.M. Figg W.D. Ann. Pharmacother. 1997; 31: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).Bcl2 is the first identified survival gene involved in the control of apoptosis (2Gajewski T.F. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1996; 87: 589-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Greater than 15 Bcl2 family members, representing both anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic members, have been identified to date in mammalian cells and viruses (3Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4780) Google Scholar). Results have suggested potential mechanism(s) by which Bcl2 functions including: (a) heterodimerization with its proapoptotic partner, Bax (4Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J.

Here we show that loss of E-cadherin in melanoma cell lines does not involve mutations in the E-cadherin gene, promoter methylation, or alterations in expression of AP-2 transcription factors as suggested previously. In a panel of different melanoma cell lines, E-cadherin expression was negatively regulated by up-regulation of the transcription factor Snail. In comparison with primary human melanocytes, where Snail expression was not detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, significant expression was found in all eight melanoma cell lines. In parallel, Western blot and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed strong reduction of E-cadherin expression in the melanoma cells. Consistently, transient transfection of a Snail expression plasmid into human primary melanocytes led to significant down-regulation of E-cadherin, whereas transient and stable transfection of an antisense Snail construct induced reexpression of E-cadherin in Mel Ju and Mel Im melanomas. In summary, we conclude that activation of Snail expression plays an important role in down-regulation of E-cadherin and tumorigenesis of malignant melanomas.

Stevenson B. Grimaldi A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1575-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). The extracellular domain of E-cadherin is involved in a molecular zipper mediating cell-cell adhesion, whereas the cytoplasmic tail is linked to the actin cytoskeleton via catenins (2Cowin P. Proc.

E-cadherin is involved in a signaling pathway mediated by β-catenin and lymphocyte enhancer factor and T cell factor transcription factors. Deregulation of this pathway results in constant activation of β-catenin, lymphocyte enhancer factor, and T cell factor target genes, including c-myc and cyclin D1, and occurs in many kinds of malignant tumors (22Shtutman M.

Only very recently, up-regulation of the transcription factor Snail was reported to mediate significant negative regulation of E-cadherin expression in bladder, colorectal, and pancreatic carcinomas (35Batlle E.

Buettner R. Bosserhoff A.K. Melanoma Res. 1998; 8: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 38Blesch A. Bosserhoff A.K. Apfel R. Behl C. Hessdoerfer B. Schmitt A. Jachimczak P. Lottspeich F. Buettner R. Bogdahn U. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5695-5701PubMed Google Scholar). The cell lines Mel Ei, Mel Wei, Mel Ho, and Mel Juso were derived from a primary cutaneous melanoma, and Mel Im, Mel Ju, SK-Mel-28, and HTZ19d were derived from metastases of malignant melanomas. For tissue culture the cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with penicillin (400 units/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml),l-glutamine (300 μg/ml), and 10% fetal calf serum serum (Sigma) and split 1:5 every 3 days. Human primary melanocytes derived from normal skin were cultivated in melanocyte medium melanocyte growth medium-3 (Life Technologies, Inc.) under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were used in passages 6–10 and not later than 3 days after trypsinization. Cells were detached for subcultivation or assay with 0.05% trypsin and 0.04% EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).1 For transient transfections, 2 × 105 cells per well were seeded into six-well plates and transiently transfected with 0.5 μg of AP-2α or AP-2β cytomegalovirus promoter expression plasmids (39Moser M. Imhof A. Pscherer A. Bauer R. Amselgruber W. Sinowatz F. Hofstadter F. Schule R. Buettner R. Development. 1995; 121: 2779-2788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), E-cadherin expression plasmid, or sense- and antisense Snail cDNA in pcDNA3 (35Batlle E. Sancho E. Franci C. Dominguez D. Monfar M. Baulida J. Garcia D.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar) using the LipofectAMINE Plus method (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and E-cadherin expression was evaluated using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, Western blotting, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). All transfections experiments were repeated three times. A panel of Mel Im cell clones was established by stable transfection with an antisense Snail expression plasmid (35Batlle E. Sancho E. Franci C. Dominguez D. Monfar M. Baulida J. Garcia D.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar) under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter and cotransfected with the neo-selectable pcDNA3 plasmid (Invitrogen, Groningen, Holland). Transfection was also performed using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One day after transfection, cells were placed into the selection medium containing 50 μg/ml G418 (Sigma). Twenty-five days after selection, individual G418-resistant colonies were subcloned. Cells (3 × 106) were lysed in 200 μl of radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. Insoluble fragments were removed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant lysate was immediately shock frozen and stored at −80 °C. Eight micrograms of radioimmunoprecipitation assay cell lysate were loaded per lane and separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gradient gels (Invitrogen) and subsequently blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After blocking for 1 h with 3% bovine serum albumin and PBS, the membrane was incubated for 16 h with a 1:150 dilution of a mouse monoclonal E-cadherin antibody (clone M106, 0.2 μg/μl; Takara, Shiga, Japan). Then the membrane was washed three times in PBS, incubated for 1 h with a 1:300 dilution of an alkaline phosphate-coupled secondary anti-mouse IgG antibody (AP303A; Chemicon, Hofheim, Germany), and then washed again. Finally immunoreactions were visualized by nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Sigma) staining. Expression of Snail and E-cadherin mRNA was measured by RT-PCR. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using 2 μg of total cellular RNA as template, 1 μg of a random primer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 4 μl of 5× first-strand buffer (Life Technologies), 2 μl of 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μl of 10 mm dNTPs, and 1 μl of Superscript II (Life Technologies) in a volume of 20 μl. For Snail amplification, a nested PCR was performed using 2 μl of the cDNA preparation and the following program: 15 cycles of 45 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C and a final extension of 5 min at 68 °C. Two microliters of the PCR product were applied to the same reaction profile but with 25 cycles using nested primers (hsnail forward, 5′-TGC GCG AAT CGG CGA CCC; hsnail reverse, 5′-CCT AGA GAA GGC CTT CCC GCA G; hsnail forward nested, 5′-ACT ACA GCG AGC TGC AGG; and hsnail reverse nested, 5′-GTG TGG CTT CGG ATG TGC). PCR products were separated on a 1.8% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. For E-cadherin, both conventional RT-PCR and quantitative real time PCR were performed on a LightCycler (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Two microliters of cDNA template, 2 μl of 25 mm MgCl2, 0.5 μm forward and reverse primers (CLONTECH), and 2 μl of SybrGreen LightCycler mix in a total of 20 μl were applied to the following PCR program: 30 s at 95 °C (initial denaturation); 20 °C/s temperature transition rate up to 95 °C for 15 s, 10 s at 58 °C, 22 s at 72 °C, and 10 s at 82 °C acquisition mode single, repeated for 40 times (amplification). The PCR reaction was evaluated by melting curve analysis following the manufacturer's instructions and checking the PCR products on 1.8% agarose gels. Genomic DNA was isolated from melanoma cell lines as described previously (40Bosserhoff A.K. Hein R. Bogdahn U. Buettner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 490-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Exons and intron-exon boundaries of E-cadherin were amplified using the primers described by Berx et al. (10Berx G. Cleton-Jansen A.M. Nollet F. de Leeuw W.J. van de Vijver M. Cornelisse C. van Roy F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6107-6115Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). The PCR products were purified, and direct cycle sequencing reactions were performed using a PRISM dye primer cycle sequencing kit with AmpliTaq FS (Perkin-Elmer) and analyzed by capillary electrophoresis (Applied Biosystems ABI 310). This method is based on the selective conversion of unmethylated cytosine to uracil by the effect of bisulfite (41Herman J.G. Graff J.R. Myohanen S. Nelkin B.D. Baylin S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9821-9826Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA (1 μg) was denaturalized with NaOH and treated with 2.5m sodium bisulfite in the presence of 0.5 mmhidroquinone for 16 h at 50 °C. DNA was purified from the excess of salts, and 100 ng of modified DNA were used as a template in the PCR reaction. This reaction was performed under the following conditions: 67 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.8, 16.6 mmammonium sulfate, 6.7 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1.25 mm dNTPs using as primers oligonucleotides 5′-TTAGGTTAGAGGGTTAT CGCGT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TAACTAAAAATTCACCTACCG AC-3′ (antisense) for the methylated DNA and 5′-TAATTTTAGGTTAGAGGGTTATTGT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CACAACCAATCAACAACA CA -3′ (antisense) for unmethylated DNA. The nucleotides in bold correspond to the uracils generated from cytosine by effect of bisulfite; the nucleotides underlined correspond to the cytosines protected by methylation. These four oligonucleotides correspond to sequences −177/−156 (sense) and −84/−62 (antisense) (methylated) and −182/−158 (sense) and −104/−85 (antisense) (unmethylated) from the human E-cadherin promoter. The conditions of amplification used were 37 cycles composed of 20 s at 96 °C, 30 s at 53 °C (unmethylated reaction) or 57 °C (methylated reaction), and 30 s at 72 °C. The presence of amplification products (116 base pairs bp for methylated and 97 base pairs for unmethylated) was visualized in 7.5% Tris-borate EDTA-polyacrylamide gels. Cultured cells were detached with 10 mm EDTA in PBS, washed once with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS, and stained for 40 min with a 1:200 dilution (0.2 μg/ml) of anti E-cadherin antibody at 4 °C (clone M106, Takara). After final incubation with Cy2-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200; Dianova, Hamburg, Germany), cells were fixed for 5 min at room temperature with 0.5% formaldehyde and analyzed by flow cytometry using a Facsalibur (Becton Dickinson). As a negative control, unrelated mouse IgG was used instead of E-cadherin antibody. Previously, down-regulation of E-cadherin has been described as an important molecular event in tumorigenesis of melanomas. Therefore, we first aimed to verify the deregulated E-cadherin expression pattern in a panel of different melanoma cell lines and then addressed potential molecular mechanisms involved in down-regulation of the gene. Western blotting with radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysates derived from eight different melanoma cell lines and from primary human melanocytes revealed significant E-cadherin down-regulation in all melanoma cell lines. As depicted in Fig. 1 A, an ∼120-kDa E-cadherin signal was present in the skin melanocyte culture (primary human melanocytes) and in the colon carcinoma cell line LoVo, which was not detected in any of the melanoma cell lines. In parallel to the results obtained by Western blots, we observed significantly reduced mRNA expression levels by RT-PCR analyses. After 26 PCR cycles, E-cadherin amplification products were clearly detected in primary human melanocytes and LoVo cells but not in the melanoma cell lines. Consistently, PCR reactions prepared with RNA template from human skin fibroblasts failed to amplify the E-cadherin cDNA fragment (Fig. 1 B). Because down-regulation of E-cadherin protein was closely paralleled by reduction of mRNA in all eight different melanoma cell lines, we hypothesized that defective E-cadherin expression in these cell lines involved transcriptional but not translational mechanisms. To exclude the possibility that structural gene mutations lead to failures in processing mature mRNA, we sequenced the entire 16 exons and flanking intron regions of the E-cadherin gene in all eight melanoma cell lines. No mutations were detected either in the coding region or in the flanking intron-exon boundaries (data not shown). Three new intronic polymorphisms were detected, none of which affected a region critical for exon-intron processing. It has been speculated previously that loss of E-cadherin possibly involves absence of AP-2 transcription factors, hypermethylation of the promoter region, or up-regulation of the transcription factor Snail (26Graff J.R. Herman J.G. Lapidus R.G. Chopra H. Xu R. Jarrard D.F. Isaacs W.B. Pitha P.M. Davidson N.E. Baylin S.B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5195-5199PubMed Google Scholar, 28Batsche E. Muchardt C. Behrens J.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar). To analyze the effect of AP-2 on E-cadherin expression in melanoma cells, we reintroduced the AP-2 protein by transfecting AP-2 cDNA expression vectors. Results shown in Fig.2 revealed that transient transfections of both AP-2α and AP-2β expression plasmids did not significantly activate E-cadherin expression. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analyses of AP-2α-transfected (Fig. 2 B) and AP-2β-transfected (Fig. 2 C) Mel Im provided only minimally enhanced E-cadherin profiles compared with mock-transfected control cells (Fig. 2 A). Identical results were obtained from AP-2-transfected Mel Ju cells, and RT-PCR analyses consistently failed to result in amplification of an E-cadherin cDNA product (data not shown). In contrast, transient transfection of an E-cadherin expression plasmid led to significant E-cadherin immunostaining in a large portion of transfected Mel Im cells (Fig. 2 D). To determine the effect of promoter hypermethylation on E-cadherin expression, the methylation status of all melanoma cell lines was analyzed. In none of the cell lines was promoter methylation detectable (Fig. 3). Encouraged by recent studies of colon cancers revealing repression of E-cadherin expression by up-regulation of the transcription factor Snail (35Batlle E. Sancho E. Franci C. Dominguez D. Monfar M. Baulida J. Garcia D.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar, 36Cano A. Perez-Moreno M.A. Rodrigo I. Locascio A. Blanco M.J. del Barrio M.G. Portillo F. Nieto M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (2929) Google Scholar), we further analyzed Snail expression patterns and the effect of transfected Snail in melanoma cells. RT-PCR experiments demonstrated significant Snail mRNA expression in all eight different melanoma cell lines and human skin fibroblasts but not in primary human melanocytes and the colon cancer cell line LoVo (Fig.4). From these results we concluded that significant expression of Snail closely correlates with down-regulation of E-cadherin. On the basis of these data, we transfected both sense and antisense Snail expression plasmids into primary human melanocytes and Mel Im or Mel Ju melanoma cells. Transient transfection of Snail led to 2.7-fold reduced expression of E-cadherin in primary human melanocytes as measured by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (LightCycler). In contrast, transfection of a Snail antisense plasmid caused 4.3-fold E-cadherin mRNA up-regulation in Mel Im cells and 3.9-fold up-regulation in Mel Ju cells. Because results from transient transfections are limited by transfection efficiency (∼5% in primary melanocytes and up to 30% in the melanoma cell lines) and rapid degradation of plasmid DNA molecules, we also aimed to examine E-cadherin expression levels in stably antisense Snail-transfected Mel Im cell clones. Therefore, we selected a panel of six different neo-resistant Mel Im cell clones and compared E-cadherin expression in these clones with a neo-transfected control clone. Results shown in Fig.5 A clearly demonstrated significant E-cadherin up-regulation in all six antisense Snail-transfected cell clones by Western blot. Two of the cell clones with the strongest E-cadherin expression (Mia as4 and MI as5) were further analyzed for E-cadherin expression by flow cytometry (Fig.5 B) and snail mRNA expression (Fig.6). A marked increase in E-cadherin expression and a down-regulation of snail could be shown.Figure 6Snail expression in the stably antisense-transfected Mel Im cells (Mel Im as4 andMel Im as5) measured by RT-PCR and compared with snail expression in the parental Mel Im cell line. Results from β-actin RT-PCR are shown underneath.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A variety of phenotypical alterations distinguish tumor cells from normal cells, the most prominent of which include changes in cellular morphology (referred to as “dedifferentiation”), differences in adhesion, and acquisition of an invasive and metastatic phenotype. In many tissues E-cadherin was identified as a critically important cell-cell adhesion molecule, being a potential molecular target involved in these alterations. Several groups provided clear evidence that E-cadherin is frequently down-regulated in a variety of different human tumors, correlating with dedifferentiation and increased invasiveness in vitro. Disturbance of E-cadherin function by inhibitory antibodies led to induction of invasiveness and vice versa, and enhanced expression of E-cadherin in tumor cells by cDNA transfection experiments inhibited invasion (11Frixen U.H.

In malignant melanomas, loss or down-regulation of E-cadherin was first described in vitro (23Danen E.H. de Vries T.J. Morandini R. Ghanem G.G. Ruiter D.J. van Muijen G.N.

Functional consequences resulting from loss of E-cadherin expression were elicited by Herlyn and co-workers (19Herlyn M. Berking C. Li G. Satyamoorthy K.

Several studies revealed that down-regulation of E-cadherin leads to defects in control of melanocyte proliferation by keratinocytes and to acquisition of an invasive tumor cell phenotype (19Herlyn M. Berking C. Li G. Satyamoorthy K. Melanoma Res. 2000; 10: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 20Hsu M.Y. Meier F.E. Nesbit M. Hsu J.Y. Van Belle P. Elder D.E. Herlyn M. Am. J.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1535-1542PubMed Google Scholar). Results from our present study confirm that significant down-regulation of E-cadherin is a frequent event in melanoma cell lines but does not involve mutations in the E-cadherin gene. These data agree with other reports indicating that loss of E-cadherin expression because of structurally inactivating gene mutations occurs very infrequently (48Hirohashi S. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 333-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Mutational inactivation of the gene resulting in uniform loss of E-cadherin expression has been detected in a few gynecological cancers, lobular carcinomas of the breast, and gastric carcinomas (10Berx G.

Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). However, in the vast majority of tumors, loss of E-cadherin is heterogeneous (50Moll R. Mitze M. Frixen U.H. Birchmeier W. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 1731-1742PubMed Google Scholar) and can be modulated by the tumor microenvironment (51Mareel M.M. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. De Bruyne G.K. Vleminckx K. Hoogewijs A.

Furthermore, loss of expression of the transcription factor AP-2 as a potential positive regulator of E-cadherin expression was described in other tumors (28Batsche E. Muchardt C. Behrens J. Hurst H.C. Cremisi C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3647-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Because loss of AP-2 expression in melanoma was shown by several groups (30Karjalainen J.M.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4358-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), the same mechanism was speculated to be involved in loss of E-cadherin in melanoma but until now was not experimentally proven (29Bar-Eli M. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1999; 18: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In this study we could clearly show that expression of AP-2, either α or β, in melanoma cell lines by transient transfection did not lead to expression of E-cadherin. This is in contrast to c-kit (53Huang S. Jean D. Luca M. Tainsky M.A. Bar-Eli M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4358-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), in which AP-2 plays an important role in regulating gene expression. Also, melanoma cell adhesion molecule/mucin (31Jean D.

Enhanced methylation of CpG islands in the E-cadherin gene promoter has been proposed as a possible mechanism for E-cadherin inactivation in carcinomas by several reports (26Graff J.R. Herman J.G. Lapidus R.G. Chopra H. Xu R. Jarrard D.F. Isaacs W.B. Pitha P.M. Davidson N.E. Baylin S.B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5195-5199PubMed Google Scholar, 27Tamura G. Yin J. Wang S. Fleisher A.S. Zou T.

Chem. 2000; 275: 2727-2732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Our results indicate clearly that hypermethylation of the promoter region is not molecularly linked to down-regulation of E-cadherin expression in melanoma cells. Also Tamura et al. (27Tamura G. Yin J. Wang S. Fleisher A.S. Zou T. Abraham J.M. Kong D. Smolinski K.N. Wilson K.T. James S.P. Silverberg S.G. Nishizuka S. Terashima M. Motoyama T. Meltzer S.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) demonstrated that loss of E-cadherin expression in vivo was not uniformly associated with promoter hypermethylation and therefore concluded that alterations in promoter methylation patterns are unlikely the only mechanisms involved in switching off E-cadherin expression. Possibly, promoter hypermethylation may result from long-term promoter inactivation by other transcriptional mechanisms rather than representing the primary cause of gene inactivation.

We then analyzed the expression of the transcription factor Snail, which has recently been identified as a potent inhibitor of E-cadherin expression in colon, gastric, and pancreas carcinomas (35Batlle E.

Blanco M.J. del Barrio M.G. Portillo F. Nieto M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (2929) Google Scholar). Significant levels of Snail mRNA expression were detected in all melanoma cell lines that we analyzed but not in primary human melanocytes, indicating that Snail up-regulation is a very frequent event in melanoma cells. Snail expression in these cells is clearly causally involved in regulating E-cadherin expression, because we observed up-regulation of E-cadherin mRNA and protein levels both after transient and stable antisense Snail expression plasmids and, in addition, down-regulation of E-cadherin after transient Snail expression in benign skin melanocytes. Interestingly, Snail was also shown to activate vimentin expression, a cytoskeletal protein frequently up-regulated in melanoma cells compared with benign melanocytes (36Cano A. Perez-Moreno M.A. Rodrigo I. Locascio A. Blanco M.J. del Barrio M.G. Portillo F. Nieto M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (2929) Google Scholar). These data suggest that Snail may play a general role in changing gene expression patterns during malignant transformation of melanocytic tumors and call for further investigations addressing the regulation of Snail expression. In summary, our results provide further insights into the regulation of E-cadherin expression in malignant melanoma cells and reveal that Snail up-regulation plays significant roles in switching off E-cadherin expression in malignant melanoma cells.

We have previously shown that genetic inhibition of tumor COX-2 expression reverses the immunosuppression induced by non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). To assess the impact of COX-2 expression in lung cancer invasiveness, NSCLC cell lines were transduced with a retroviral vector expressing the human COX-2 cDNA in the sense (COX-2-S) and antisense (COX-2-AS) orientations. COX-2-S clones expressed significantly more COX-2 protein, produced 10-fold more prostaglandin E2, and demonstrated an enhanced invasive capacity compared with control vector-transduced or parental cells. CD44, the cell surface receptor for hyaluronate, was overexpressed in COX-2-S cells, and specific blockade of CD44 significantly decreased tumor cell invasion. In contrast, COX-2-AS clones had a very limited capacity for invasion and showed diminished expression of CD44. These findings suggest that a COX-2-mediated, CD44-dependent pathway is operative in NSCLC invasion. Because tumor COX-2 expression appears to have a multifaceted role in conferring the malignant phenotype, COX-2 may be an important target for gene or pharmacologic therapy in NSCLC.

Immunol. 2000; 164: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Our current studies focus on the role of tumor COX-2 expression in modulating NSCLC invasion. Tumor metastasis is a complex series of events in which cells migrate beyond tissue compartments and spread to distant organ sites. Cell surface CD44, the receptor for hyaluronate, has an important role in regulating tumor growth and metastasis because it mediates cellular adhesion to extracellular matrix, which is prerequisite for tumor cell migration (25Yu Q. Stamenkovic I. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 35-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 26Yu Q. Toole B.P. Stamenkovic I. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1985-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). While COX-2 expression has previously been linked to enhanced matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression and invasion (27Tsujii M. Kawano S. DuBois R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3336-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar), the role of CD44 in this COX-2-induced invasion has not been defined. Here, we report that stable overexpression of COX-2 in NSCLC results in up-regulation of CD44. Furthermore, we demonstrate a CD44-dependent increase in invasion in Matrigel matrix assays. In contrast, abrogation of tumor-COX-2 expression results in decreased PGE2 production, diminished CD44 expression and decreased invasion. This is the first report documenting the critical role of tumor COX-2 expression in the regulation of CD44-dependent invasion by human NSCLC. A 2.0-kilobase pair cDNA fragment of human COX-2 (generously provided by Dr. Harvey Herschman, UCLA) was cloned into the PmeI site of the retroviral vector pLNCX (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). In this vector, transcription of the COX-2 cDNA is controlled by the cytomegalovirus promoter, and transduced cells can be enriched under G418 selection. Sense (COX-2-S) and antisense (COX-2-AS) oriented expression vectors were prepared. A549 (human lung adenocarcinoma) and H157 (squamous cell carcinoma) cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and the National Cancer Institute, respectively. Tumor cells were transfected with COX-2-S, COX-2-AS-expressing vectors, or pLNCX (vector alone) using calcium-phosphate-mediated transfection (Promega, Madison, WI). The transfected cells were grown in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C in cell culture medium consisting of RPMI 1640 (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Biological Products, Calabasas, CA), 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.). For selection, the medium also contained 0.5 mg/ml active G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Following G418 selection, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to confirm the positive COX-2-S and COX-2-AS clones. The PCR was done using the pLNCX 5′ primer (AGCTTCGTTTAGTGAACCTCAGATCG) and pLNCX 3′ primer (ACCTACAGGTGGGGTCTTTCATTCCC). PCR positive clones were then screened by Western blot and EIA analysis for COX-2 expression and PGE2production, respectively. For each tumor cell line a high COX-2-expressing and PGE2-producing clone for COX-2-S, and a low COX-2-expressing and PGE2-producing COX-2-AS clone, were identified from a survey of 25 clones. These clones were then expanded for further studies. Control, COX-2-S, and COX-2-AS cells (A549 and H157) were stimulated with IL-1β (200 units/ml, Genzyme, Cambridge, MA) for 24 h. PGE2 concentration in each group (with or without IL-1β stimulation) were measured by EIA using a PGE2 EIA kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) as reported previously (28Huang M. Sharma S. Mao J.T. Dubinett S.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5512-5520PubMed Google Scholar). All measurements were made in triplicate and repeated in at least three separate experiments. The cells from each treatment group were lysed at 4 °C for 15 min in lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.6% Nonidet P-40). The cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant collected. Total protein was measured with a protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad), and 20 μg of cell lysate protein were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Following separation, the proteins were transferred to Hybond nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the filters probed with anti-human COX-2 antibody (Cayman Chemical). For CD44 detection, the filters were probed with anti-human CD44 antibody 4A4 (29Droll A. Dougherty S.T. Chiu R.K. Dirks J.F. McBride W.H. Cooper D.L. Dougherty G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11567-11573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The membranes were developed by the ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposed to x-ray film (Fujifilm, Fuji Medical Systems Inc., Stamford, CT). Equal loading of samples was confirmed by probing the membranes with β-actin antibody. To quantify invasion, the membrane invasion assay was carried out in Matrigel-coated invasion chambers (Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Control and COX-2 transfectants were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Tumor cells in log phase growth were detached by trypsin-EDTA (Mediatech) and resuspended in RPMI 1640 with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Serum-free A549- and H157-conditioned medium was obtained by incubation of these cells for 24 h. This tumor cell-conditioned medium was added in the lower chamber as a chemoattractant, and the resuspended cells (5 × 104) were plated in the upper chamber. Following 18-h incubation at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere, the cells in the upper chamber and on the Matrigel were mechanically removed with a cotton swab. The cells adherent to the outer surface of the membrane were fixed with methanol and stained with hematoxylin/eosin. The invading cells were examined, counted, and photographed by microscopy (Nikon Labphot-2 Microscope with an attached Spot Digital Camera, A. G. Heinz, Lake Forest, CA) at × 50 magnification. Six fields were counted per filter in each group, and the experiment was repeated five separate times. To assess the role of CD44 in mediating Matrigel invasion, the cells from COX-2-S-expressing clones were plated in the presence of 500 ng of anti-CD44 antibody (The Binding Site, Inc., San Diego, CA) or control mouse IgG (Dako Corp., Carpenteria, CA) and the cell numbers determined as described. To evaluate the role of COX-2 expression in mediating the lung cancer invasiveness, two NSCLC cell lines were stably transduced with a retroviral vector encoding COX-2 and selected for G418 resistance. The COX-2-S clones (A549-S and H157-S) exhibited enhanced constitutive COX-2 protein expression by immunoblot (Fig. 1, A andB). In contrast, COX-2 was not detectable in COX-2-AS clones (Fig. 1, A and B). The COX-2 protein expression in the sense clones was found to be significantly higher (3-fold for H157 and 10-fold for A549 cells), as measured by densitometry, than that of parental or vector-transduced cells (data not shown). Compared with parental and vector-transduced cells, COX-2-S clones (H157-S and A549-S) exhibited a 5–12-fold increase in PGE2 production. In contrast, COX-2-AS clones showed decreased constitutive PGE2 production (Fig. 2,A and B). IL-1β is one of several cytokines known to potently up-regulate COX-2 expression in a variety of cells (30Endo T. Ogushi F. Sone S. Ogura T. Taketani Y. Hayashi Y. Ueda N. Yamamoto S. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 12: 358-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Consistent with our previous findings (28Huang M. Sharma S. Mao J.T. Dubinett S.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5512-5520PubMed Google Scholar), parental and vector-transduced control cells exhibited a 5–10-fold increase in PGE2 production in response to IL-1β (Fig. 2,A and B). In contrast, a similar induction of PGE2 secretion was not observed in COX-2-AS clones in the presence of IL-1β (Fig. 2, A and B).Figure 2Increased PGE2 production in COX-2 modified NSCLC cells. NSCLC cells (106 cells/ml of parental (P), empty vector (V), COX-2-S (S), and COX-2-AS (AS) transfectants) were cultured in complete medium with and without IL-1β (280 units/ml). Following a 24-h incubation the supernatants were collected for PGE2 determination by enzyme immunoassay. A, A549 cells. Compared with parental and vector controls a 10-fold increase in constitutive PGE2 production is seen in COX-2-S cells (p < 0.01), while an inhibition of PGE2 production is seen in COX-2-AS cells (p < 0.05). B, H157 cells. Compared with parental and vector a 5-fold increase in constitutive PGE2production is seen in COX-2-S cells (p < 0.05), while an inhibition of PGE2 production is seen in COX-2-AS cells (p < 0.05). In response to IL-1β, increase in PGE2 production is seen in parental and vector control of both cell lines. The PGE2 EIA results are expressed as ng/ml/106 cells/24 h and are representative of four experiments performed in duplicate.

Kawano S. DuBois R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3336-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar, 31Ryu H.S. Chang K.H. Yang H.W. Kim M.S. Kwon H.C. Oh K.S. Gynecol. Oncol. 2000; 76: 320-325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). To examine its role in NSCLC, we tested cells overexpressing COX-2 in Matrigel matrix invasion assays. As depicted in Fig.3 A, COX-2-S cells were significantly more invasive than parental or antisense-transfected A549 and H157 cells. The invasiveness was found to be similar for both of the COX-2-S cell lines. By counting cells in random microscopic fields, we determined that the sense clones of both A549 and H157 were 3-fold more invasive than parental or vector-transfected controls (Fig.3 B). Furthermore, consistent with their undetectable COX-2 expression, COX-2-AS cells demonstrated a decreased invasiveness through Matrigel (Fig. 3, A and B). Because tumor CD44 expression is known to play an important role in tumor invasion and metastasis (26Yu Q. Toole B.P. Stamenkovic I. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1985-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 32Seiter S. Arch R. Reber S. Komitowski D. Hofmann M. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Matzku S. Zoller M. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 443-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that CD44 expression may be important for NSCLC COX-2-dependent invasion. Indeed, CD44 expression was augmented in COX-2-S clones as determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast, CD44 was not detectable in COX-2-AS cells (Fig. 4,A and B). Consistent with the expression of COX-2 and PGE2 production, CD44 expression was also found to be up-regulated in parental tumor cells in the presence of IL-1β. This suggested that related signaling events could be mediating increased COX-2 and CD44 expression in NSCLC. Because IL-1β could not induce COX-2 activity or CD44 expression in the COX-2-AS transfectants, COX-2 appears to be a proximal regulator of CD44 expression in NSCLC. Consistent with the findings of Western blot analysis, FACS analysis of the COX-2 transfected cells with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled CD44 antibody showed an increase in the expression of CD44 in COX-2-S but decreased expression in COX-2-AS cells (data not shown). To determine the importance of CD44 expression in tumor COX-2-dependent invasion, we performed antibody blocking experiments with anti-CD44 antibody. The enhanced invasiveness of the COX-2-S clones was found to be inhibited with anti-CD44 antibody, whereas control monoclonal antibody had no effect (Fig. 3,A and B). Anti-CD44 antibody did not completely decrease COX-2-S invasion to the level of COX-2-AS cells, suggesting that CD44-independent mechanisms may also be operative. Mounting evidence from several studies indicates that tumor COX-2 activity has a multifaceted role in conferring the malignant and metastatic phenotypes. The data in the current study implicates COX-2 overexpression as a proximal mediator of CD44-dependent invasion in human NSCLC. We demonstrate that augmenting COX-2 expression leads to increased invasion by NSCLC cells. Importantly, this enhanced invasion is associated with increased CD44 expression, and blocking CD44 abrogates the COX-2-mediated enhancement of NSCLC cell mobilization through Matrigel. Although multiple genetic alterations are necessary for lung cancer invasion and metastasis, COX-2 may be a central element in orchestrating this process (13Huang M. Stolina M. Sharma S. Mao J.

Recently, other studies have corroborated and expanded on our initial findings documenting the importance of COX-2 expression in lung cancer (12Hida T. Kozaki K. Muramatsu H. Masuda A. Shimizu S.

COX-2 activity can be detected throughout the progression of a premalignant lesion to the metastatic phenotype (14Hida T. Yatabe Y. Achiwa H. Muramatsu H. Kozaki K.-I. Nakamura S. Ogawa M. Mitsudomi T. Sugiura T. Takahashi T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3761-3764PubMed Google Scholar). Markedly higher COX-2 expression was observed in lung cancer lymph node metastasis compared with primary adenocarcinoma (14Hida T. Yatabe Y. Achiwa H. Muramatsu H. Kozaki K.-I. Nakamura S. Ogawa M. Mitsudomi T. Sugiura T. Takahashi T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3761-3764PubMed Google Scholar). These reports, together with studies documenting an increase in COX-2 expression in precursor lesions (15Wolff H. Saukkonen K. Anttila S. Karjalainen A. Vainio H. Ristimaki A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4997-5001PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hosomi Y. Yokose T. Hirose Y. Nakajima R. Nagai K. Nishiwaki Y. Ochiai A. Lung Cancer. 2000; 30: 73-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), suggest the involvement of COX-2 overexpression in the pathogenesis of lung cancer. Epidemiological studies that indicate a decreased incidence of lung cancer in subjects who regularly use aspirin have been interpreted as supporting this hypothesis (37Schreinemachers D.M. Everson R.B. Epidemiology. 1994; 5: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). In addition to regulating immune responses, tumor COX-2 has been implicated in inhibiting apoptosis (21Tsujii M. DuBois R. Cell. 1995; 83: 493-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar, 38Hsu A.L. Ching T.T. Wang D.S. Song X. Rangnekar V.M. Chen C.S. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1306-1311PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibition of programmed cell death in COX-2-expressing cells is found to be associated with an increase in Bcl2 expression and a decrease in the expression of both the TGF-β2 receptor and E-cadherin protein (21Tsujii M. DuBois R. Cell. 1995; 83: 493-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar). Experimental evidence suggests that ligation of the cell surface matrix adhesion receptor CD44 by anti-CD44 antibody induces cell detachment and triggers apoptosis in a variety of cells (39Tian B. Takasu T. Henke C. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 257: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, inhibiting anchorage dependence mediated by CD44 may contribute to induction of apoptosis (40Formby B. Wiley T.S. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 202: 53-61Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of COX-2 also enhances tumor invasiveness and thus may increase metastatic potential (3Williams C.S. Tsujii M. Reese J. Dey S.K. DuBois R.N. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1589-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 27Tsujii M. Kawano S. DuBois R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1856-1862PubMed Google Scholar). Adhesion to extracellular matrix, a critical initial step in the metastatic process, has been found to be CD44-dependent in several tumors (26Yu Q. Toole B.P. Stamenkovic I. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1985-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 32Seiter S. Arch R. Reber S. Komitowski D. Hofmann M. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Matzku S. Zoller M. J. Exp.

CD44 is a receptor for hyaluronate, a major glycosaminoglycan component of the extracellular matrix. In this capacity, CD44 also serves to induce co-clustering with MMP-9 and can therefore promote MMP-9 activity, tumor invasion, and angiogenesis (25Yu Q. Stamenkovic I. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 35-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar,44Yu Q. Stamenkovic I. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 163-176PubMed Google Scholar). Our findings indicate that tumor COX-2 overexpression in human NSCLC constitutes an important driving force for CD44 induction. Thus, COX-2 expression may form the basis for an important tumor-induced invasive pathway. The fact that CD44-induced MMP-2 and -9 have the capacity to activate latent TGF-β suggests an autocrine and paracrine pathway in which collagen deposition and further invasion may be enhanced (44Yu Q. Stamenkovic I. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 163-176PubMed Google Scholar, 45Taipale J. Saharinen J. Keski-Oja J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 75: 87-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activation of latent TFGβ also provides an additional pathway for tumor-induced immune suppression (44Yu Q. Stamenkovic I. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 163-176PubMed Google Scholar, 46Beck C. Schreiber H. Rowley D.A. Microsc. Res. Technol. 2001; 52: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 47Shah A.H. Lee C. Prostate. 2000; 45: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies by Sun et al. (48Sun L.K. Beck-Schimmer B. Oertli B. Wuthrich R.P. Kidney Int. 2001; 59: 190-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) demonstrate that hyaluronate fragments have the capacity to up-regulate COX-2 by a CD44-dependent pathway. Thus, hyaluronate itself may serve to further enhance tumor COX-2 and CD44 expression leading to maintenance of the COX-2-dependent invasive phenotype. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in men and women in the United States (49Ramanathan R. Belani C. Semin. Oncol. 1997; 24: 440-454PubMed Google Scholar). Despite therapeutic efforts, 5-year survival in lung cancer patients is less than 15% (50Pass, H. I., Mitchell, J. B., Johnson, D. H., Turrisi, A. T., and Minna, J. D. (eds)(2000) Lung Cancer. Etiology and Epidemiology of Lung Cancer (Schottenfeld, D., ed) pp. 367-388, Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, PhiladelphiaGoogle Scholar). Defining new molecular targets will lead to more effective therapeutic strategies. Here we document for the first time a pathway whereby COX-2 overexpression leads to CD44-dependent invasion in NSCLC. These findings suggest that therapies targeting COX-2 may diminish the propensity for invasion and metastases in NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W2166277499,"Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is a multi-functional cytokine that regulates cell growth and differentiation. Cellular responses to TGF-β are mediated through its cell surface receptor complex, which activates transcription factors Smad2 and Smad3. Here we report that UV irradiation of mink lung epithelial cells causes near complete inhibition of TFG-β-induced Smad2/3-mediated gene expression. UV irradiation inhibited TGF-β-induced phosphorylation of Smad2 and subsequent nuclear translocation and DNA binding of Smad2/3. Specific cell surface binding of TGF-β was substantially reduced after UV irradiation. This loss of TGF-β binding resulted from UV-induced down-regulation of TGF-β type II receptor (TβRII) mRNA and protein. UV irradiation significantly inhibited TβRII promoter reporter constructs, indicating that UV reduction of TβRII expression involved transcriptional repression. In contrast to its effects on TβRII, UV irradiation rapidly induced Smad7 mRNA and protein. Smad7 is known to antagonize activation of Smad2/3 and thereby block TGF-β-dependent gene expression. UV irradiation stimulated Smad7 promoter reporter constructs, indicating that increased Smad7 expression resulted, at least in part, from increased transcription. Overexpression of Smad7 protein to the level induced by UV irradiation inhibited TGF-β-induced gene expression 30%. Maintaining TβRII levels by overexpression of TβRII prevented UV inhibition of TGF-β responsiveness. Taken together, these data indicate that UV irradiation blocks cellular responsiveness to TGF-β through two mechanisms that impair TGF-β receptor function. The primary mechanism is down-regulation of TβRII, and the secondary mechanism is induction of Smad7.

TβRI and TβRII possess intrinsic serine/threonine kinase activity. TβRIII is a membrane proteoglycan that is thought to facilitate ligand binding to TβRII (8Wang X.F. Ling H.Y. Ng-Eaton E.

Recent studies demonstrate that UV irradiation of cells causes ligand-independent rapid activation and clustering of many different growth factor and cytokine cell surface receptors (24Bender K.

Despite widespread interest in mechanisms of action of UV irradiation, relatively little is known regarding the effect of UV irradiation on TGF-β receptor activation or on TGF-β/Smad signaling. We report here that in contrast to growth factor- and cytokine receptor-mediated signal transduction, UV irradiation impairs TGF-β receptor-mediated signal transduction. This impairment of TGF-β responsiveness results from down-regulation of TβRII and induction of Smad7 by UV irradiation. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal bovine serum, trypsin solution, penicillin, streptomycin,l-glutamine, and G418 (geneticin) were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. TβRI, TβRII, Smad2, Smad3, and Smad7 primary and secondary antibodies for Western analysis were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phospho-Smad2 was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Fluorescein isothiocynate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and anti-goat IgG secondary antibodies for immunofluorescence confocal laser microscopy were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Human recombinant TGF-β 1 was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN).125I-TGF-β 1, [γ-32P]ATP, and [α-32P]dCTP were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The cross-linking agent disuccinimidyl suberate was purchased from Pierce. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Mink lung epithelial cells (MLECs) and MLECs stably transfected with a plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) promoter/TGF-β/luciferase reporter gene were generously provided by Dr. Daniel Rifkin of the New York University Medical Center. MLECs were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 µg/ml), l-glutamine, and G418 (geneticin, 200 µg/ml, to stably transfected cells only) in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Before UV irradiation, sub-confluent cells were incubated overnight in serum-free media. The next morning, the media were collected, and cells were covered with a thin layer of PBS and irradiated with UV (20 mJ/cm2) using a Daavlin Spectra panel lamp (Bryan, OH) containing six FS24T12UVB-HO bulbs. A Kodacel filter was used to eliminate wavelengths below 290 nm (UVC). The irradiation intensity was monitored with an IL400A radiometer and a SED240/UVB/W photodetector (International Light, Newbury, MA). After irradiation, the PBS was aspirated, and the original media were put back into the plates. Cellular viability 24 h after UV irradiation was near 100%, based on cell morphology and number. For TGF-β 1 treatment, TGF-β 1 (1 ng/ml) was added at the indicated times post-UV for 1 h. MLECs (1 × 104) were plated on 8-well chamber slides and exposed to UV (20 mJ/cm2). TGF-β1 (1 µg/ml) was added at the indicated times post-UV for 1 h. Cells were rinsed once with PBS and fixed in 5% paraformaldehyde for 2 h at room temperature. The cells were incubated with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and then blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Cells were then incubated overnight with primary antibody (anti-Smad2 or anti-Smad3, 1:500 dilution) at 4 °C. Slides were subsequently washed with PBS five times and incubated with primary antibody for 1 h. Fluorescein isothiocynate-labeled secondary antibodies were then added for 1 h. The fluorescence-stained cells were observed and photographed with a Bio-Rad MRC 600 confocal microscope through a 60× objective. Total RNA from MLECs was extracted with a commercial kit (RNeasy Midi Kit, Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Samples of total RNA (30–50 µg) were resolved by 1.2% agarose electrophoresis, transferred to nylon membranes, and hybridized with TβRI, TβRII, and Smad7 cDNA probes labeled with [32P]dCTP by random priming. Each blot was stripped and re-hybridized with 36B4 internal control gene transcript to monitor the sample load in each lane. The intensities of each band were quantified by STORM PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and normalized to the 36B4 gene transcript. cDNA probe was generated by digestion of Smad7 cDNA expression vector (30Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.E. Heldin C.H. Ten Dijke P.

The polymerase chain reaction products were sub-cloned into the pCRII vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and verified by restriction digestion and sequencing. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (31Fisher G.J. Talwar H. Xiao J. Datta S. Reddy A. Gaub M. Rochette-Egly C. Chambon P. Voorhees J. J. Biol.

Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5314-5325Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) with slight modification. Briefly, MLECs were washed twice with PBS and suspended in fresh hypotonic buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mmNaCl, 0.3 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were then harvested on ice by scraping and homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer. Crude nuclei were pelleted at 2000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was then spun at 25,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. To obtain a crude membrane fraction, the membrane pellet was re-suspended in whole cell extraction buffer (25 mmHEPES, pH 7.7, 0.3 m NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 2 µg/ml leupeptin, and 100 µg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and stored at −80 °C. Concentrations of membrane or nuclear proteins were measured by Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad) using BSA as a standard. Nuclear or membrane proteins were resolved on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and reacted with primary antibodies. Blots were visualized and quantified with enhanced chemifluorescence (ECF) (Vistra ECF Western blotting system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the manufacturer's protocol. The intensities of each band were quantified by STORM PhosphorImager. Binding of 125I-TGF-β to MLECs was performed according to the method described (33Dumont N. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. Philip A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 111: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Sub-confluent cells were incubated overnight in complete medium. Cells were then irradiated with UV as described above, and incubation was continued for 1, 3, 5, 8, 16, or 24 h after exposure. Cells were washed once with Krebs-Ringer-Hepes/BSA binding buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 128 mmNaCl, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 5 mm KCl, 0.5% BSA) and then incubated in Krebs-Ringer-Hepes/BSA for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed with 0.1% glacial acetic acid for 5 min at room temperature, placed in Krebs-Ringer-Hepes/BSA, and then 0.2 nm125I-TGF-β 1 was added for 3–4 h at 4 °C. Nonspecific binding was determined by addition of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled TGF-β 1. Cells were harvested by scraping, and radioactivity was measured as described previously (34Wakefield L.M. Smith D.M. Masui T. Harris C.C. Sporn M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 965-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Cross-linking of 125I-TGF-β 1 to its receptors was carried out as previously described (35Wells R.G. Yankelev H. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11444-11451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, sub-confluent cells were treated with 125I-TGF-β1 as described above for the binding assay. Reactions were halted by adding glycine. 125I-TGF-β 1 was cross-linked to receptors by the addition of disuccinimidyl suberate (0.5 mg/ml). Cellular proteins were solubilized then resolved on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed with nuclear extracts from MLECs. Double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides containing the TGF-β response element in the PAI-1 promoter (5′-TCGAGAGCCAGACAAGGAGCCAGACAAGGAGCCAGACAC-3′ and its complementary strand) and the consensus Smad binding element (5′-GGATAGCGTCTAGACATAGTCTAGACTGAGT-3′ and its complementary strand) were used as probes (36Dennler S.

(Alameda, CA). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (38Quan T. Fisher G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28566-28574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, synthetic single strand oligonucleotides were incubated in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mmEDTA, and 0.3 m NaCl at 75 °C for 15 min and placed at room temperature overnight. The annealed double-stranded oligonucleotides were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies Inc.). The end-labeled probe was purified with a G50 column (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Approximately 2 × 105 cpm of end-labeled DNA probe was incubated with 5–10 µg of MLEC nuclear extract in a volume of 20 µl. For competition experiments, a 10–50-fold molar excess of unlabeled DNA probe was preincubated with nuclear extract for 30 min on ice before labeled probe was added. After 30 min of incubation on ice, the protein-DNA complexes were electrophoresed on 4% polyacrylamide gel at 200 V in 0.5 × TBE (1.0 m Tris, 0.9 m boric acid, 0.01m EDTA). The gel was transferred to Whatman No. 3MM paper, vacuum-dried, and scanned by STORM PhosphorImager. β-Galactosidase expression vector (1 µg, pCMVβ,CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) was co-transfected to provide an internal standard for transfection efficiency. Three luciferase promoter reporter constructs were utilized: 1) Smad binding element X4 (39Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar), containing four repetitions of the GTCTAGAC Smad3/4 binding motif (provided by Dr. Bert Vogelstein of the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, MD), 2) TβRII promoter (40Bae H.W.

All plasmids were introduced into cells using Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Where indicated in the text, cells were UV-irradiated as described above 24 h after transfection, and 8 h later, TGF-β1 (1 ng/ml) was added to the medium. Twenty-four h after treatment, cells were washed once with PBS, harvested in lysis buffer (Pharmingen International, San Diego, CA), and assayed for β-galactosidase activity (42Miller J.H. Expression in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 17.34-17.35Google Scholar). Aliquots containing identical β-galactosidase activity were used for each luciferase assay (43Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5294) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was measured using an enhanced luciferase assay kit (Pharmingen International) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Smad7 (30Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.E. Heldin C.H. Ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar) or TβRII (44Chen R. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22868-22874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were overexpressed by transient transfection in MLECs stably expressing the TGF-β-inducible PAI promoter luciferase reporter. TβRII-coding region was generated by polymerase chain reaction using the primers 5′-GAATTCGTCTGCCATGGGTCGGGGGC-3′ and 5′-TTCAGGAATCTTCTCCTCC-3′. The polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into pcDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen) and verified by restriction digestion and sequencing. Comparisons among treatment groups were made with the paired t test (two groups) or the repeated measures of analysis of variance (more than two groups). Multiple pairwise comparisons were made with the Tukey Studentized Range test. All p values are two-tailed and considered significant when <0.05. We initially investigated the effect of UV irradiation on TGF-β-induced gene expression using two well characterized TGF-β-regulated luciferase reporter constructs: 1) an 800-base pair fragment (−799/+71) of the human PAI-1 gene (45Abe M. Harpel J.G. Metz C.N. Nunes I. Loskutoff D.J. Rifkin D.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar) and 2) four repetitions of the GTCTAGAC Smad3/4 binding element upstream of a SV40 minimal promoter (39Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, TGF-β treatment activated these reporter constructs more than 10-fold. Pretreatment of cells with UV irradiation 8 h before the addition of TGF-β1 repressed activation of both reporter genes almost completely (Fig. 1). UV treatment alone had no significant effect either on the PAI-1 reporter gene or on the Smad binding element reporter construct (Fig. 1). Taken together, these data indicate that UV irradiation inhibits TGF-β responsiveness. Binding of TGF-β to its receptors results in phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3, which then associate with Smad4 and translocate into the nucleus. The reduced responsiveness of TGF-β-regulated reporter constructs to TGF-β after exposure of cells to UV irradiation could result from decreased Smad2/3 activation. To examine this possibility, we next examined whether UV irradiation inhibits phosphorylation of Smad2 and nuclear translocation of Smad2 and Smad3. In untreated cells, the basal level of phosphorylated Smad2 was minimally detectable by Western analysis. Treatment of cells with TGF-β 1 increased Smad2 phosphorylation ∼4.5-fold (Fig.2). Treatment of cells with UV irradiation alone did not alter the level of phosphorylated Smad2 (data not shown). However, pretreatment of cells with UV (20 mJ/cm2) before the addition of TGF-β 1 resulted in a time-dependent inhibition of Smad2 phosphorylation. Although TGF-β1-induced Smad2 phosphorylation was not sufficiently changed at 1 and 3 h post-UV, it was almost completely blocked at 8 and 16 h post-UV. In contrast, total Smad2 levels were not affected by either TGF-β or UV treatment (Fig. 2). We next examined whether UV irradiation affects TGF-β-induced nuclear translocation of phospho-Smad2 and Smad3. As shown in Fig.3, phospho-Smad2 and Smad3 were predominantly located in the cytoplasm of untreated cells or cells treated with UV alone (data not shown). Treatment of cells with TGF-β1 induced nuclear translocation of phospho-Smad2 and Smad3. Pretreatment of cells with UV 8 h before the addition of TGF-β 1 substantially blocked TGF-β-induced translocation of phospho-Smad2 and Smad3 (Fig. 3). UV inhibition of Smad2 and Smad3 activation by TGF-β would be expected to reduce Smad protein DNA binding. To investigate this possibility, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays with two well characterized Smad3/4 DNA binding probes, one containing the TGF-β response element in the PAI-1 promoter (36Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar), and a second probe, identified by random oligonucleotide screening, as a Smad3 DNA binding element (37Akiyoshi S. Inoue H. Hanai J. Kusanagi K. Nemoto N. Miyazono K. Kawabata M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35269-35277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). MLECs treated with TGF-β alone exhibited enhanced protein binding to both probes (Fig. 4). In contrast, treatment of cells with UV irradiation before the addition of TGF-β blocked protein binding to both probes in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 4). These results indicate that UV inhibits TGF-β-induced DNA binding of Smad proteins. The above data indicate that UV irradiation interferes with TGF-β activation of Smad2 and Smad3. This interference could occur as a result of physical and/or functional loss of TGF-β receptors. To investigate this possibility, we determined the effect of UV irradiation on TGF-β binding to its cell surface receptors. Fig.5 A shows specific binding of125I-TGF-β 1 to intact MLEC after UV irradiation. TGF-β binding increased 35% at 1 h post-UV and returned to its initial level by 3 h post-UV. Between 5 and 24 h post-UV, there was a progressive decrease in the level of 125I-TGF-β1 binding. At 24 h post-UV, TGF-β1 binding was reduced ∼60% relative to non-irradiated control cells (100%) (Fig. 5 A). We next determined the level of TGF-β·TGF-β receptor complexes by cross-linking 125I-TGF-β 1 to its receptors in intact MLEC. In non-irradiated and UV-irradiated cells, three major binding complexes were identified, with apparent molecular weights of 65,000, 85,000, and 200,000–250,000, shown previously to be TGF-β complexed with TβRI, TβRII, and TβRIII, respectively (46Segarini P.R. Rosen D.M. Seyedin S.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Consistent with other studies (47Zhao Y. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 150: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 48Tam B.Y. Philip A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 553-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), TβRIII receptors were most prominently labeled with 125I-TGF-β 1, whereas TβRII and TβRI yielded weaker-labeled complexes (Fig. 5 B). Cells treated with UV exhibited significant time-dependent decreases of the cross-linked complexes for all three TGF-β receptors relative to levels in non-irradiated control cells (Fig.5 B). Reduced binding of TGF-β to its receptors after UV irradiation could occur as a result of decreased expression of TGF-β receptors. To investigate this possibility, we next examined the effect of UV on TGF-β receptor mRNA and protein levels"
https://openalex.org/W2076088544,"ABCR is a member of the ABCA subclass of ATP binding cassette transporters that is responsible for Stargardt macular disease and implicated in retinal transport across photoreceptor disc membranes. It consists of a single polypeptide chain arranged in two tandem halves, each having a multi-spanning membrane domain followed by a nucleotide binding domain. To delineate between several proposed membrane topological models, we have identified the exocytoplasmic (extracellular/lumen) N-linked glycosylation sites on ABCR. Using trypsin digestion, site-directed mutagenesis, concanavalin A binding, and endoglycosidase digestion, we show that ABCR contains eight glycosylation sites. Four sites reside in a 600-amino acid exocytoplasmic domain of the N-terminal half between the first transmembrane segment H1 and the first multi-spanning membrane domain, and four sites are in a 275-amino acid domain of the C half between transmembrane segment H7 and the second multi-spanning membrane domain. This leads to a model in which each half has a transmembrane segment followed by a large exocytoplasmic domain, a multi-spanning membrane domain, and a nucleotide binding domain. Other ABCA transporters, including ABC1 linked to Tangier disease, are proposed to have a similar membrane topology based on sequence similarity to ABCR. Studies also suggest that the N and C halves of ABCR are linked through disulfide bonds.

Acta. 1999; 1461: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Like most other mammalian ABC transporters, members of this subclass consist of a single long polypeptide chain organized into two tandemly arranged halves. Each half contains a membrane-spanning domain (MSD) followed by a cytoplasmic nucleotide binding domain (NBD). The ABCA subclass is distinguished from other ABC transporter subclasses by the presence of a large domain between the first NBD (NBD-1) and the second MSD (MSD-2) that is interrupted by a hydrophobic segment, initially designated as HH1 (21Luciani M.F. Denizot F. Savary S. Mattei M.G. Chimini G. Genomics. 1994; 21: 150-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In addition, these proteins typically contain a hydrophobic stretch of amino acids close to the N terminus that is preceded by several positively charged amino acids. ABCR shows a high degree of sequence identity to three other members of this subclass (ABC1 or ABCA1, ABC2 or ABCA2, ABC-C or ABCA3) for which the complete primary structure has been determined (1Illing M.

A very large N-terminal cytoplasmic domain precedes MSD-1, and a large putative cytoplasmic regulatory region interrupted by a hairpin hydrophobic segment HH1 is located between NBD-1 and MSD-2. Illinget al. (1Illing M. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10303-10310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) suggested a different model for ABCR (Fig.1 B). A hydrophobic segment near the N terminus (H1) and the HH1 segment, referred to as H7, were envisioned to be transmembrane segments, and each MSD was suggested to consist of five membrane-spanning segments. A characteristic feature of this model is the presence of two very large exocytoplasmic (extracellular/luminal) domains in both the N- and C-terminal halves of the protein and the absence of the large cytoplasmic regulatory domain. Finally, Azarian and Travis (3Azarian S.M. Travis G.H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and, more recently, Sun et al. (27Sun H. Smallwood P.M. Nathans J. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) proposed a hybrid model for ABCR that has some features of the first two models (Fig. 1 C). More specifically, in their model, the topology of the C-terminal half is similar to the model in Fig. 1 Awith a HH1 segment that only partially inserts into the membrane, and the N-terminal half shows structural features of the model in Fig.1 B with an H1 transmembrane segment at the N terminus. A similar hybrid model has been recently proposed for ABC1 (28Fitzgerald M.L. Mendez A.J. Moore K.H. Andersson L.P. Panjeton H.A. Freeman M.W. J. Biol.

Because N-linked glycosylation is known to take place on the lumen side of the endoplasmic reticulum, it can be used to define exocytoplasmic domains of membrane proteins. In this paper, we have identified the N-linked glycosylation sites on ABCR using trypsin digestion of ABCR in native ROS membranes, site-directed mutagenesis of heterologously expressed ABCR, concanavalin A labeling, and endoglycosidase digestion. We show that ABCR has fourN-linked glycosylation sites on each half of the protein. These sites are positioned within a 600-amino acid segment between H1 and MSD-1 in the N half and a 275-amino acid segment between H7 and MSD-2 in the C half of ABCR, thereby supporting the existence of two large ECDs as depicted in the model shown in Fig.1 B. Other members of the ABCA subclass of transporters, including ABC1 and ABC2 display considerable sequence similarity to ABCR within the ECDs, and therefore are likely to exhibit a similar membrane topology and domain organization as ABCR. We also provide evidence that the C and N halves of ABCR interact through disulfide bonds. These studies provide new insight into the organization of ABCR and other ABCA transporters in the membrane and define domains that are present on the exocytoplasmic side of the membrane.

Like most other mammalian ABC transporters, members of this subclass consist of a single long polypeptide chain organized into two tandemly arranged halves. Each half contains a membrane-spanning domain (MSD) followed by a cytoplasmic nucleotide binding domain (NBD). The ABCA subclass is distinguished from other ABC transporter subclasses by the presence of a large domain between the first NBD (NBD-1) and the second MSD (MSD-2) that is interrupted by a hydrophobic segment, initially designated as HH1 (21Luciani M.F. Denizot F. Savary S. Mattei M.G. Chimini G. Genomics. 1994; 21: 150-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In addition, these proteins typically contain a hydrophobic stretch of amino acids close to the N terminus that is preceded by several positively charged amino acids. ABCR shows a high degree of sequence identity to three other members of this subclass (ABC1 or ABCA1, ABC2 or ABCA2, ABC-C or ABCA3) for which the complete primary structure has been determined (1Illing M.

https://openalex.org/W1967714726,"A major Grb2-associated binder-1 (Gab1) binding partner in epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated cells is protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) SHP2, which contains tandem SH2 domains. The SHP2 PTPase activity is required for activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) subfamily of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase by EGF. To investigate the mechanism by which Gab1 and SHP2 mediate ERK activation, we characterized the Gab1-SHP2 interaction. We found that both Tyr-627 and Tyr-659 of Gab1 were required for SHP2 binding to Gab1 and for ERK2 activation by EGF. Far Western blot analysis suggested that the tandem SH2 domains of SHP2 bind to Gab1 in a specific orientation, in which the N-SH2 domain binds to phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P))-627 and the C-SH2 domain binds to Tyr(P)-659. When assayed with peptide substrates, SHP2 PTPase was activated by a bisphosphopeptide containing both Tyr(P)-627 and Tyr(P)-659, but not by monophosphopeptides containing Tyr(P)-627 or Tyr(P)-659 or a mixture of these monophosphopeptides. These results suggest that Tyr(P)-627 and Tyr(P)-659 of Gab1 constitute a bisphosphoryl tyrosine-based activation motif (BTAM) that binds and activates SHP2. Remarkably, while a constitutively active SHP2 (SHP2DeltaN) could not rescue the defect of a SHP2-binding defective Gab1 (Gab1FF) in ERK2 activation, expression of a Gab1FF-SHP2DeltaN chimera resulted in constitutive activation of ERK2 in transfected cells. Thus, physical association of activated SHP2 with Gab1 is necessary and sufficient to mediate the ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Phosphopeptides derived from Gab1 were dephosphorylated by active SHP2 in vitro. Consistently, substrate-trapping experiments with a SHP2 catalytic inactive mutant suggested that Gab1 was a SHP2 PTPase substrate in the cells. Therefore, Gab1 not only is a SHP2 activator but also is a target of its PTPase."

It has been shown that the presence of HCO 3−/CO2 inhibits direct strand cleavage of DNA induced by ONOO− but enhances the formation of 8-nitroguanine, alkali-labile and formamidopyrimidine glycosylase-labile DNA lesions (23Yermilov V. Yoshie Y. Rubio J. Ohshima H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 24Tretyakova N.Y. Burney S. Pamir B. Wishnok J.S. Dedon P.C. Wogan G.N. Tannenbaum S.R. Mutat.

Peroxynitrite causes direct DNA strand cleavage by oxidizing deoxyribose. However, in the presence of HCO 3−/CO2 there is a shift in product distribution from direct strand cleavage to the formation of oxidative modifications of guanines (26Burney S. Niles J.C. Dedon P.C. Tannenbaum S.R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), suggesting that the carbonate radical anion could play an important role in this phenomenon (24Tretyakova N.Y. Burney S. Pamir B. Wishnok J.S. Dedon P.C. Wogan G.N. Tannenbaum S.R. Mutat. Res. 2000; 447: 287-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Although guanine is indeed the most easily oxidized base in DNA, the reactions of the carbonate radical anions with the different aromatic DNA residues have not yet been characterized. In this work, we explore the electron transfer reactions from guanine electron donor residues embedded in the self-complementary hexadecanucleotide duplex d(AACGCGAATTCGCGTT) to CO⨪3 electron acceptor. Employing transient absorbance laser flash photolysis techniques, we monitored simultaneously the kinetics of disappearance of the CO⨪3 anion radical and the appearance of guanine radicals by transient absorption spectroscopy techniques. The decay of the CO⨪3 radical anion was followed by monitoring its absorbance (λmax = ∼600 nm), whereas the concomitant formation of guanine neutral radicals, G(−H)⋅, was identified by their characteristic narrow absorption band at 315 nm. These observations constitute the first direct indication that carbonate radicals are site-selective one-electron oxidants of guanine residues in double-stranded DNA and do not react significantly with any of the other nucleic acid bases A, C, or T. The oxidation of the different guanines in the self-complementary DNA duplex results in alkali-labile guanine lesions; these are revealed by the site-selective DNA strand cleavage induced by a standard hot piperidine treatment and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis assay. 2′-Deoxyguanosine 5′-monophosphate (dGMP), 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG), and all inorganic salts (>99% purity) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and were used as received. The d(AACGCGAATTCGCGTT) oligonucleotide was synthesized by standard automated phosphoramidite chemistry techniques. The tritylated oligonucleotide was removed from the solid support and deprotected with concentrated ammonium hydroxide. The crude oligonucleotide was purified by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography and detritylated in 80% acetic acid according to standard protocols. The oligonucleotide was dissolved in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm Na2SO4. Annealing of the two strands was accomplished by heating the samples to 90 °C for 10 min and then allowing the samples to cool slowly back to room temperature overnight. The transient absorption spectra were recorded using a pulsed laser excitation source and a kinetic spectrometer system (response time, ∼7 ns) described earlier (27Shafirovich V. Dourandin A.

Briefly, this system consists of a pulsed Lambda Physik EMG 160 MSC XeCl excimer laser (308 nm; full width at half-maximum pulse width, ∼12 ns; energy, ∼70 mJ pulse−1cm2−; 0.1 Hz), and a 75 W pulsed xenon lamp to probe the transient absorption kinetics. The probe flash was passed through a McPherson monochromator and was monitored by a Hamamatsu R928 phomultiplier; its output was recorded and digitized using a Tektronix TDS 620 oscilloscope. All experiments, including data collection and analysis, were controlled by a computer. The CO⨪3 radical anions were generated by oxidation of HCO 3− with SO⨪4 radical anions (31Dogliotti L. Hayon E. J. Phys. Chem. 1967; 71: 2511-2516Crossref Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 32Huie R.E. Clifton C.L. J. Phys. Chem. 1990; 94: 8561-8567Crossref Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The SO⨪4 ions were generated by the photodissociation of persulfate anions (31Dogliotti L. Hayon E. J. Phys. Chem. 1967; 71: 2511-2516Crossref Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 33Ivanov K.L. Glebov E.M.

Although persulfate ions exhibit negligible reactivity with nucleosides and oligonucleotides, the SO⨪4 radical anions are known to react with the DNA bases. The triggered dissociation of persulfate ions into SO⨪4 radical anions in time-resolved pulse radiolysis or flash photolysis experiments has been previously employed by Steenken and co-workers (34Candeias L.P.

Chem. 1992; 40: 59-68Google Scholar), to study the kinetics of reactions of the SO⨪4 radical anions with nucleic acids. Air-equilibrated buffer solutions containing 20–100 μmoligonucleotide duplexes, 300 mm NaHCO3, and 25 mm Na2S2O8 were placed in a 0.5-ml quartz flow cell (∼80% transmittance at 200 nm) from NSG Precision Cells, Inc. The optical pathlength of this cell was 1 cm, and the cell was aligned parallel to the direction of the xenon lamp probe light beam. After one laser shot, the irradiated solution was replaced by a fresh sample solution employing a computer-controlled flow system. All laser flash photolysis experiments were performed at 20 °C. Pseudo-first order rate constants (k n ′) of the radical (R⋅) + substrate (S) reactions and the second order rate constants of the radical recombination were determined by least squares fits of the appropriate, indicated kinetic equations to the transient absorption profiles obtained in five different experiments with five different samples. The second order rate constants of the R⋅ + S reactions were calculated by a least square best fit to a linear dependence of the k n ′ versus [S] plots. Routine UV absorption spectra and UV melting profiles were measured using an HP 84453 diode array spectrophotometer with an HP 89090A Peltier temperature control unit (Hewlett Packard GMBH, Waldbronn, Germany). The oligonucleotides were labeled at their 5′ termini by using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described previously (27Shafirovich V. Dourandin A. Huang W. Luneva N.P. Geacintov N.E. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1999; 103: 10924-10933Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The 10-μl samples containing 32P 5′-end-labeled oligonucleotide strands in 2 × 2-mm square pyrex capillary tubes (Vitrocom, Inc.) were irradiated with 308-nm laser light. After the irradiation, the reaction mixture was quenched by the addition of β-mercaptoethanol and was heated for 30 min at 90 °C in 100 μl of a 1 mpiperidine solution. The samples were vacuum dried and assayed by a denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (20% acrylamide, 19:1 bis ratio, 7 m urea), as described previously (27Shafirovich V. Dourandin A. Huang W. Luneva N.P. Geacintov N.E. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1999; 103: 10924-10933Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The relative intensities of cleavage were analyzed using a Bio-Rad 250 imaging system. The duplex formed by the self-complementary 16-mer d(AACG 1CG 2AATTCG 3CG 4TT) sequence contains the 12-mer d(CG 1CG 2AATTCG 3CG 4) core. The latter is the first oligonucleotide duplex containing at least one turn of helix for which structural information was obtained by single-crystal x-ray diffraction methods (39Wing R. Drew H. Takano T. Broka C. Tanaka S. Itakura K. Dickerson R.E. Nature. 1980; 287: 755-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar, 40Drew H.R. Wing R.M. Takano T. Broka C. Tanaka S. Itakura K.

Science. 1982; 216: 581-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We added one AA and one TT doublet to the two ends of this 12-mer to diminish the known fraying (42Patel D.J. Pardi A. Itakura K. Science. 1982; 216: 581-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) of the G:C base pairs at or near the ends of the oligonucleotide. The 16-mer duplex exhibits well defined cooperative melting curves. The average melting temperature (T m = 67 ± 1 °C) and the hyperchromicity of ∼17% were calculated from plots of the absorbance (260 nm) versus temperature obtained from heating-cooling cycles (43Law S.W. Eritja R. Goodman M.F. Breslauer K.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12329-12337Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The kinetic parameters associated with the reactions of HCO 3− and S2O 82− in aqueous solutions induced by laser pulse excitation are well documented (19Neta P. Huie R.E. Ross A.B. J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data. 1988; 17: 1027-1284Crossref Scopus (2862) Google Scholar). The excitation of S2O 82− in aqueous solutions with 308-nm XeCl excimer laser pulses generates the SO⨪4 radical anions (Table I, Reaction 1) with a quantum yield of 0.55 (33Ivanov K.L. Glebov E.M. Plyusnin V.F. Ivanov Y.V. Grivin V.P. Bazhin N.M. J. Photochem. Photobiol. A. 2000; 133: 99-104Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The SO⨪4radicals exhibit transient absorption bands at 445 nm with an extinction coefficients of 1600 m−1cm−1 (44McElroy W.J. J. Phys. Chem. 1990; 94: 2435-2441Crossref Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In pure aqueous buffer solutions, the SO⨪4 radical anions decay mostly via bimolecular recombination processes (Table I, Reaction 2). In the presence of HCO 3−, the decay of SO⨪4monitored at 445 nm results in the formation of the CO⨪3radicals, identified by their characteristic absorption band with a maximum at 600 nm and molar extinction coefficient of 1970m−1 cm−1 (45Lymar S.V. Schwarz H.A. Czapski G. Radiat. Phys. Chem. 2000; 59: 387-392Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This effect is attributed to the reduction of SO⨪4 by HCO 3− with the formation of CO⨪3 (Table I, Reaction 3); the HCO⨪3 radical, the primary product of the one-electron oxidation of HCO 3−, is a very strong acid (pK a < 0) and thus deprotonates rapidly in aqueous solutions (46Czapski G. Lymar S.V. Schwarz H.A. J. Phys. Chem. A. 1999; 103: 3447-3450Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The recombination of the CO⨪3 radicals is a slow process (Table I, Reaction 4) occurring via transfer of O⨪ anions from one CO⨪3 radical to another, thus forming carbon dioxide and peroxymonocarbonate (47Lilie J. Hanrahan R.J. Henglein A. Radiat. Phys. Chem. 1978; 11: 225-227Google Scholar). The rate constants of reactions 2–4 measured during the course of this work are also summarized in Table I; these values differ only slightly from published values because of differences in ionic strength (45Lymar S.V.

Typical transient absorption spectra of a solution of d(AACGCGAATTCGCGTT) duplexes (50 μm) containing 25 mmS2O 82− and 300 mm HCO 3−, recorded at various delay times (Δt) after 308-nm laser pulse excitation, are shown in Fig. 1. The transient absorption spectrum recorded at Δt = 60 μs exhibiting a maximum at 600 nm corresponds to the well known spectrum of the CO⨪3 radical (31Dogliotti L. Hayon E. J. Phys. Chem. 1967; 71: 2511-2516Crossref Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 45Lymar S.V. Schwarz H.A. Czapski G. Radiat. Phys. Chem. 2000; 59: 387-392Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 46Czapski G. Lymar S.V. Schwarz H.A. J. Phys. Chem. A. 1999; 103: 3447-3450Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar); at this HCO 3− concentration (300 mm), the decay of the SO⨪4 anion radicals occurs rapidly (within ∼0.7 μs) and is not shown in Fig. 1. The decay of the CO⨪3 absorption band is accompanied by the rise of another, narrow transient absorption band centered at 315 nm. This spectrum, recorded at Δt = 3.9 ms, is characteristic of both the guanine radical cation, G⋅+, and the neutral guanine radical, G(−H)⋅ (34Candeias L.P. Steenken S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 1094-1099Crossref Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Thus, the carbonate radical is a site-selective one-electron oxidant of guanine residues in double-stranded DNA (Table I, Reaction 5). As shown below (DNA strand cleavage assay), the oxidation of the other three DNA bases by CO⨪3 anion radicals is significantly less efficient than that of guanine. This is consistent with the relative rate constants of one-electron oxidation of 2′-deoxynucleotide monophosphates by CO⨪3 radicals. In the case of dGMP, the rate constant is some 20–40 times greater than the rate constant determined for dAMP, dCMP, and dTMP (Table I, Reactions 6–R9). However, the rate constant of oxidation of 8-oxo-dG is greater by a factor of ∼10 (Table I, Reaction 10) than that of dGMP (36Steenken S. Jovanovic S.V. Bietti M. Bernhard K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 2373-2374Crossref Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The pK a of free guanine radical cations, G⋅+, generated by the one-electron oxidation of dG or dGMP, is 3.9 (34Candeias L.P. Steenken S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 1094-1099Crossref Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Therefore, in neutral aqueous solutions, deprotonation of G⋅+ occurs rapidly (rate constantk = ∼2 ×106 s−1). Candeias and Steenken (34Candeias L.P. Steenken S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 1094-1099Crossref Scopus (350) Google Scholar) proposed that in double-stranded DNA, with the G⋅+ radical hydrogen-bonded to its partner Watson-Crick cytosine residue (pK a = 4.45), the deprotonation rate constant of G⋅+ should be even greater than in the case of free G⋅+. The neutral G(−H)⋅ radical has indeed been detected by electron spin resonance techniques upon oxidation of double-stranded DNA in aqueous solutions at room temperature (48Hildenbrand K. Schulte-Frohlinde D. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1990; 11: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 49Schiemann O. Turro N.J. Barton J.K. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2000; 104: 7214-7220Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Hence, the guanine radicals observed on millisecond time scales (Fig. 1) are neutral radicals, G(−H)⋅, rather than G⋅+ radical cations. In the absence of DNA, the bimolecular recombination of two CO⨪3 radicals occurs, and the rate constant (k 4) of this bimolecular reaction has been reported (Table I, Reaction 4). Consequently, the decay profile of CO⨪3 radical, monitored at 600 nm (Fig. 1), can be described by mixed first and second order kinetics. −dCO3−˙/dt=k5′CO3−˙+2k4[CO3−˙]2Equation 1 The pseudo-first order rate constant k 5′ =k5 [DNA], where [DNA] is the concentration of DNA duplexes, and k 5 is the rate constant of reaction of the CO⨪3 anion radicals with the DNA duplexes. Defining the initial concentration of carbonate radical anions (att = 0) as [CO⨪3]0, the solution of Equation 1 yields the following expression for the time dependence of the CO⨪3 radical concentration. CO3−‖t=k5′CO3∓α/k5′+2k4CO3∓0expk5′t−2k4CO3−0Equation 2 The value of k 5′ was determined by fitting Equation 2 to the CO⨪3 decay profiles measured at 600 nm and at different DNA concentrations. The value of k 4was determined in the absence of the DNA duplex (Table I). As expected,k 5′ increases linearly with the concentration of the DNA duplex (Fig. 2), yielding a value of k 5 = 1.9 × 107m−1 s−1. The rate of oxidation of dGMP by CO⨪3 radicals was determined by similar experiments (data not shown), and the rate constant k 6 = 6.6 × 107m−1s−1 (Table I). The rate constant of oxidation of free dGMP (k 6) is ∼3.5 times larger thank 5, the value of the rate constant for the oxidation of G within the DNA duplex.

https://openalex.org/W2067875575,"Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signals through three high affinity cell surface receptors, TGF-β type I, type II, and type III receptors. The type III receptor, also known as betaglycan, binds to the type II receptor and is thought to act solely by “presenting” the TGF-β ligand to the type II receptor. The short cytoplasmic domain of the type III receptor is thought to have no role in TGF-β signaling because deletion of this domain has no effect on association with the type II receptor, or with the presentation role of the type III receptor. Here we demonstrate that the cytoplasmic domains of the type III and type II receptors interact specifically in a manner dependent on the kinase activity of the type II receptor and the ability of the type II receptor to autophosphorylate. This interaction results in the phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of the type III receptor by the type II receptor. The type III receptor with the cytoplasmic domain deleted is able to bind TGF-β, to bind the type II receptor, and to enhance TGF-β binding to the type II receptor but is unable to enhance TGF-β2 signaling, determining that the cytoplasmic domain is essential for some functions of the type III receptor. The type III receptor functions by selectively binding the autophosphorylated type II receptor via its cytoplasmic domain, thus promoting the preferential formation of a complex between the autophosphorylated type II receptor and the type I receptor and then dissociating from this active signaling complex. These studies, for the first time, elucidate important functional roles of the cytoplasmic domain of the type III receptor and demonstrate that these roles are essential for regulating TGF-β signaling.

These studies, for the first time, elucidate important functional roles of the cytoplasmic domain of the type III receptor and demonstrate that these roles are essential for regulating TGF-β signaling. transforming growth factor β bone morphogenetic protein glutathione S-transferase kinase-dead hemagglutinin Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)1 is a member of a family of dimeric polypeptide growth factors which, in addition to the TGF-β ligands, includes the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and the activins (1Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3975) Google Scholar). TGF-β regulates cellular proliferation and differentiation as well as the processes of embryonic development, wound healing, and angiogenesis in a tissue-specific manner. Mutations in TGF-β receptors or their intracellular signaling molecules have been described, particularly in association with the development of cancer and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Alterations in the production of TGF-β ligand have also been linked to numerous disease states, including osteoporosis, hypertension, atherosclerosis, and fibrotic disease of the kidney, liver, and lung (2Blobe G.C. Schiemann W.P. Lodish H.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 1350-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar). TGF-β regulates cellular processes by binding to three high affinity cell surface receptors, the TGF-β type I, type II, and type III receptors. Where expressed, the type III receptor, also known as betaglycan, is the most abundant TGF-β receptor and is traditionally thought to function by binding TGF-β and then transferring it to its signaling receptor, the type II receptor. This is particularly important for the TGF-β2 isoform, which cannot bind the type II receptor independently. The type I and II receptors contain serine/threonine protein kinases in their cytoplasmic domains which initiate intracellular signaling by phosphorylating members of the Smad family of transcription factors. A general mechanism for TGF-β signaling has been established. TGF-β either binds to type III receptors, which then present TGF-β to type II receptors, or to type II receptors directly. Once activated by TGF-β, type II receptors recruit, bind, and transphosphorylate type I receptors, thereby stimulating their protein kinase activity. The activated type I receptors phosphorylate Smad2 or Smad3 that then bind to Smad4. The resulting Smad heterocomplex then translocates into the nucleus where it interacts in a cell-specific manner with numerous transcription factors to regulate the transcription of many TGF-β-responsive genes. How can such a simplistic pathway regulate such a diverse array of biology? Many groups have attempted to address this issue through identification of type I and type II receptor-interacting proteins that may modulate TGF-β signaling at the receptor level as well as transcription factors, coactivators, and corepressors that interact with Smads to regulate TGF-β signaling at the transcriptional level (3Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Diversity may also be generated by the formation of discrete receptor complexes that would then utilize distinct TGF-β pathways. Indeed, some studies have suggested that the type I receptor mediates predominantly the effects of TGF-β on the extracellular matrix, whereas the type II receptor mediates the effects of TGF-β on the cell cycle/proliferation (4Chen R.H. Ebner R. Derynck R. Science. 1993; 260: 1335-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 5Sankar S. Mahooti-Brooks N. Bensen L. McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. Madri J.A. J. Clin.

In addition, Smad-independent signaling, and signaling through mitogen-activated protein kinase and other cellular signaling pathways has been reported (6Piek E. Heldin C.H. Ten Dijke P.

To explore the involvement of TGF-β receptor complexes in TGF-β signaling, we examined the complexes formed by the type III receptor and the role of the type III receptor in TGF-β signaling. The type III receptor forms complexes individually with either the type II receptor or the type I receptor, as well as complexes with the type II and type I receptors together. Current evidence suggests that the interaction of the type III receptor with the type II receptor occurs through their respective extracellular domains because deletion of the cytoplasmic domain of the type III receptor does not alter the ability of these receptors to interact (11Lopez-Casillas F. Payne H.M. Andres J.L. Massague J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Indeed, no functional role for the cytoplasmic domain of the type III receptor has been established. The studies described herein establish a role for a specific, functional, and biologically significant interaction between the cytoplasmic domains of the type II and type III receptors. The protein kinase activity of the type II receptor and autophosphorylation of the type II receptor are both shown to be essential for this interaction, which results in the phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of the type III receptor by the type II receptor. The type III receptor with its cytoplasmic domain deleted is able to bind TGF-β, the type II receptor, and enhance TGF-β binding to the type II receptor but is unable to enhance TGF-β2 signaling. The type III receptor functions by selectively binding autophosphorylated type II receptor via its cytoplasmic domain, preferentially promoting the formation of a complex between the autophosphorylated type II receptor and the type I receptor, and then dissociating from this active signaling complex. These studies elucidate important functions for the cytoplasmic domain of the type III receptor and demonstrate that these functional roles are essential for regulating TGF-β signaling. The COS-7 and L6 cell lines were obtained from ATCC. These cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transiently transfected using expression vectors for the type III receptor and type II or type I receptors using FuGene6 reagent under conditions described by the manufacturer (Roche). The L6-III and L6-III-cyto stable cell lines were selected in 0.6 mg/ml G418 and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum and 0.3 mg/ml G418. All cells were grown in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere. Radioligand binding and cross-linking of 125I-TGF-β1 to L6, L6-III, L6-III-cyto, or transfected COS-7 cells were performed by incubating subconfluent cells with KRH buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm KCl) containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 37 °C, then with 100 pm125I-TGF-β1 for 3 h at 4 °C.125I-TGF-β1 was cross-linked with 0.5-mg/ml disuccinimidyl suberate for 15 min and quenched with 20 mmglycine. Cells were then washed with KRH buffer, lysed in RIPA lysis buffer, immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and phosphorimaging analysis of dried gels. Quantitation of bands was performed using ImageQuant version 1.2 software from Molecular Dynamics. 293T cells were transfected with the type II receptor and harvested by immunoprecipitation with anti-TβR-II antibodies and protein A-Sepharose 48 h after transfection. The resulting immunocomplexes were washed and utilized to phosphorylate recombinant GST-TypeIIIcyto or GST-Endocyto in 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.3, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 1.25 mm EGTA, 50 μm sodium vanadate, 10 mm MgCl2, and 100 μmATP ([γ-32P]ATP, ∼2,000 cpm/pmol), and 5 μg of recombinant GST-TypeIIIcyto of GST-Endocyto for 30 min at 30 °C. The reactions were analyzed directly or immunoprecipitated and analyzed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and detected by phosphorimaging analysis of the dried gels. COS-7 and 293T cells were transfected with the type II receptors or the type II receptor-KD (kinase-dead), and the HA epitope-tagged type III receptor. After 48 h, the cells were washed in phosphate-free medium and labeled with 1.0 mCi/ml 32Pi for 4 h. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed with RIPA lysis buffer, immunoprecipitated with αHA antibody and protein G-Sepharose, analyzed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and detected by phosphorimaging analysis of the dried gels. Cells were plated in 24-well plates at 2 × 104 cells/ml and treated with 0–200 pm TGF-β1. After 48 h of incubation, cells were treated with 10 mCi of [3H]thymidine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 4 h. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and 5% trichloroacetic acid before harvesting cells with 0.1 nNaOH. The amount of [3H]thymidine incorporated was analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. Growth inhibition was calculated as the ratio of radioactivity with TGF-β treatment/radioactivity in the absence of TGF-β treatment. The types I, II, and III TGF-β receptors have been demonstrated to associate in various complexes through both co-immunoprecipitation studies (12Franzen P. ten Dijke P. Ichijo H. Yamashita H.

Antibodies to either the type II or type III receptor are able to co-immunoprecipitate both receptors, indicating that they form a complex in the presence of ligand. We have developed a polyclonal antibody to a small peptide (amino acids 833–847) in the cytoplasmic domain of the type III receptor (α277). In contrast to other antibodies to the type III receptor, we have observed that the α277 antibody is unable to co-immunoprecipitate the type II receptor (14Moustakas A. Lin H.Y. Henis Y.I. Plamondon J. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22215-22218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, while examining the expression of the type III receptor in endothelial cell lines, we have observed that the α277 antibody was increasingly unable to immunoprecipitate the type III receptor in cell lines with higher levels of expression of the type II receptor relative to the type III receptor (19Morello J.P. Plamondon J. Meyrick B. Hoover R. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 165: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that the cytoplasmic domains of the receptors interact with one another, with the type II receptor preventing immunoprecipitation of the type III receptor by the α277 antibody. To establish the mechanism and relevance of this phenomenon, we analyzed the ability of the α277 antibody to immunoprecipitate or co-immunoprecipitate wild type or HA epitope-tagged type II and type III receptors expressed in COS-7 cells by transient transfection. COS-7 cells were utilized because they express low levels of endogenous receptors that could confound analysis. Expression of these receptors was detected by binding and cross-linking the receptors with iodinated TGF-β1. As expected, the affinity-labeled type III receptor appears as a diffuse band from 180 to 300 kDa, and the type II receptor appears as a band at 95 kDa (Fig. 1). The α277 antibody was able to immunoprecipitate the type III receptor, however, co-expression of the type II receptor with the type III receptor abolished the ability of the α277 antibody to immunoprecipitate the type III receptor (Fig. 1 A). Identical results were obtained when nontagged versions of the receptor were utilized (data not shown). This effect was dose-dependent, as increasing the expression of the type II receptor relative to the expression of the type III receptor was able to inhibit progressively the ability of the α277 antibody to immunoprecipitate the type III receptor (Fig. 1 B). We were also unable to detect increased expression of the type II receptor because this was not co-immunoprecipitated by the α277 antibody. These findings demonstrate that the α277 antibody immunoprecipitates only the type III receptors that are not complexed with type II receptors and suggest that the effect of the type II receptor is the result of an interaction of its cytoplasmic domain with the cytoplasmic domain of the type III receptor. To determine whether this effect was specific to the α277 antibody we performed a number of control experiments. First, the ability of the type II receptor to affect immunoprecipitation of the HA-tagged type III receptors with the αHA antibody was analyzed. The αHA antibody was able to immunoprecipitate the affinity-labeled type III receptor, and co-expression of the type II receptor did not block this ability (Fig. 1 A). In addition, when increasing the expression of the type II receptor relative to the type III receptor, the αHA antibody was able to co-immunoprecipitate the type II receptor and to detect the increased expression of the type II receptor (Fig.1 B). Second, an antibody to the intracellular domain of the type II receptor (α260) was able to immunoprecipitate the type II receptor and co-immunoprecipitate the type III receptor and, as expected, did not co-immunoprecipitate the type III receptor unless the type II receptor was expressed (Fig. 1 A). Finally, the ability of an antibody to the entire cytoplasmic domain of the type III receptor was analyzed (α820). This antibody was able to immunoprecipitate the type III receptor, and expression of the type II receptor had no effect on this ability (Fig. 1 A). In addition, the type II receptor was co-immunoprecipitated by this antibody (Fig. 1 A). These studies confirm that the ability of the type II receptor to interfere with the immunoprecipitation of the type III receptor is specific to the α277 antibody, establishing this α277 antibody immunoprecipitation assay as a measure of a specific interaction between the cytoplasmic domains of the type II receptor and the type III receptor. To determine whether the ability of the cytoplasmic domain of the type II TGF-β receptor to interact with the cytoplasmic domain of the type III receptor was specific to the type II TGF-β receptor, we analyzed the effect of expression of the type I TGF-β receptor as well as the type II receptors for activin and BMP, respectively. As shown in Fig.2, the type I TGF-β receptor, the KD or constitutively active (T204D) type I receptor, the type II activin receptor, and the type II BMP receptor were unable to interact with the cytoplasmic domain of the type III receptor. These results demonstrate that the ability of the type II TGF-β receptor to interact with the cytoplasmic domain of the type III receptor is specific to the type II TGF-β receptor. The α277 antibody immunoprecipitation assay predicts that the cytoplasmic domain of the type II receptor is essential for the effect of the type II receptor. To determine whether this was the case, we utilized two deletion mutants of the type II receptor cytoplasmic domain. When the type III receptor was co-expressed with a mutant of the type II receptor which lacks all but the first 9 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain (type II-cyto9), no interaction with the cytoplasmic domain of the type III receptor was observed (Fig. 2). Type II-cyto9 may be nonfunctional because of its inability to sterically hinder access to the epitope of the α277 antibody or because it lacks kinase activity. To evaluate the first possibility, a deletion mutant of the type II receptor encoding 60 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain (type II-cyto60) was utilized. Type II-cyto60 was also unable to interact with the cytoplasmic domain of the type III receptor (Fig. 2). These studies confirm that an intact cytoplasmic domain of the type II receptor is necessary for the interaction with the cytoplasmic domain of the type III receptor and suggest that the type II receptor interacts with the type III receptor to exclude the α277 antibody by a nonsteric mechanism. We have demonstrated previously that a series of deletion mutants of the extracellular region of the type III receptor which contain the membrane proximal region retains the ability to bind TGF-β (20Pepin M.C. Beauchemin M. Plamondon J. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6997-7001Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Some of these mutants migrate as discrete bands because they lack GAG sites for proteoglycan attachment. This property allows detection and analysis of oligomers of the type III receptor, thus allowing us to determine the effect of the cytoplasmic domains of type III receptors interacting with each other using the α277 antibody immunoprecipitation assay. We initially investigated whether the type II receptor interacted with the cytoplasmic domains of these mutant type III receptors. As expected, expression of mutants 44–303, 44–382, 44–402, and 44–420, which all retain GAG attachment sites, migrate as diffuse bands with progressively lower molecular masses (Fig.3). In contrast, mutants 44–564 and 44–575 lack the GAG attachment sites and migrate as more discrete bands. In addition, we are able to detect not only the monomer but also oligomeric forms of these mutants (Fig. 3). In all cases, these mutants interacted with the type II receptor, but not with the type II-cyto60 (type II(Δcyto)) mutant (Fig. 3). These results confirm that, as expected, these regions of the extracellular domain of the type III receptor were not necessary for the interactions of the cytoplasmic domains of these receptors. In addition, we were able to detect the oligomers of the type III receptor with the α277 antibody, demonstrating that the interaction of the cytoplasmic domain of the type III receptor with itself does not interfere with access of the α277 antibody epitope, in contrast to the situation with the heterocomplex of the type II and type III receptors. The cytoplasmic domain of the type II receptor contains a serine/threonine protein kinase that functions by autophosphorylating the type II receptor and by phosphorylating and activating the type I receptor. The inability of the type II-cyto60 or the type III receptor in homodimers to block immunoprecipitation suggests that the type II receptor interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of the type III receptor in a nonsteric manner. To determine whether the kinase activity of the type II receptor mediates the ability of the type II receptor to interact with the type III receptor, we utilized a kinase-dead version of the type II receptor (type II-KD). The type II-KD was effectively expressed and bound TGF-β; however, it did not effectively interact with the cytoplasmic domain of the type III receptor (Fig. 2), even with increasing expression of the type II-KD mutant relative to the type III receptor (Fig. 1 B). In contrast with the type II receptor, the type II-KD mutant was effectively co-immunoprecipitated by the α277 antibody, indicating that the α277 antibody could detect the type III receptor complexed with the type II-KD mutant receptor (Fig.1 B). These studies demonstrate that the kinase activity of the type II receptor is essential for the ability of the type II receptor to interact with the cytoplasmic domain of the type III receptor. Two mechanisms can be proposed for why the kinase activity of the type II receptor is essential for its interaction with the cytoplasmic domain of the type III receptor. Either phosphorylation of the type III receptor by the type II receptor directly prevents the α277 antibody from binding its epitope on the type III receptor, or autophosphorylation of the type II receptor indirectly blocks the epitope of the α277 antibody either by inducing a close association between the type III and type II receptors or by recruiting an adaptor protein that binds to the autophosphorylated type II receptor and/or the phosphorylated type III receptor cytoplasmic domain. The cytoplasmic domain of the type III receptor is rich in serine and threonine residues and is phosphorylated (21Lin H.Y. Moustakas A. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1994; 40: 337-349PubMed Google Scholar, 22Matsuzaki K. Kan M. McKeehan W.L. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. Animal. 1996; 32: 345-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar); however, the kinase(s) responsible for phosphorylating the type III receptorin vivo has not been elucidated. To determine whether the type II receptor was the protein kinase responsible for phosphorylating the type III receptor, we initially investigated whether the cytoplasmic domain of the type III receptor could be a substrate for the type II receptor. For these studies, a GST fusion of the cytoplasmic domain of the type III receptor was utilized. A GST fusion of the cytoplasmic domain of the closely related receptor, endoglin, was utilized as a control substrate, and the type II-KD receptor was utilized as a control kinase source. As expected, the type II receptor was able to autophosphorylate, whereas type II-KD was not (data not shown). The type II receptor was also able to phosphorylate the GST-type III cytoplasmic domain significantly, with a 3-fold induction relative to type II-KD (data not shown). The GST-endoglin cytoplasmic domain was also phosphorylated significantly by the type II receptor relative to type II-KD (with a 2-fold induction) but not to the same extent as GST-type III cytoplasmic domain. These studies demonstrate that the type II receptor can phosphorylate the cytoplasmic domain of the type III receptor in vitro. To analyze whether this phosphorylation occurred in vivo, the type III receptor was expressed in the presence and absence of either the type II receptor or the type II-KD receptor, the cells were labeled with 32Pi, and the phosphorylation state of the type III receptor was analyzed by immunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig. 4, the phosphorylation state of the type III receptor was increased 7-fold by co-expression of the type II receptor but not by the type II-KD receptor or in the absence of an expressed type II receptor. The ability of the type II receptor to phosphorylate the type III receptor directly in vitro, together with its ability to enhance the phosphorylation of the type III receptor in vivo, demonstrates that the type III receptor is a physiological substrate for the type II receptor. To determine whether phosphorylation of the type III receptor by the type II receptor was the mechanism by which the type II receptor interacts with the type III receptor to block immunoprecipitation by the α277 antibody, we investigated whether phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of the type III receptor by the type II receptor altered the ability of the α277 antibody to immunoprecipitate the type III receptor. When the GST-type III cytoplasmic domain was phosphorylated by the type II receptor in vitro, the α277 antibody was able to immunoprecipitate and detect this phosphorylation (Fig. 4 C). In addition, when the type III receptor was expressed in the presence and absence of the type II receptor, immunoprecipitated by the αHA antibody and analyzed by Western blot with the α277 antibody, the α277 antibody was able to detect the type III receptor that had been expressed alone or with the type II receptor (data not shown). These results demonstrate that phosphorylation of the type III receptor by the type II receptor is not responsible for the inability of the α277 antibody to detect the type III receptor in the presence of the type II receptor. We then investigated whether autophosphorylation of the type II receptor was responsible for the dependence on type II kinase activity by testing autophosphorylation site mutants. The type II receptor is autophosphorylated on at least three serine residues in the cytoplasmic domain, Ser-213, Ser-409, and Ser-416, with Ser-213 being the major site (23Luo K. Lodish H.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1970-1981Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of these autophosphorylation sites (from serine to alanine) demonstrated that Ser-213 was important for maximal kinase activity, whereas Ser-409 and Ser-416 were not, and that Ser-409 was important for TGF-β signaling. As shown in Fig.5 A, when either Ser-213 or Ser-416 was mutated to alanine, there was no effect on the ability of the type II receptor to interact with the cytoplasmic domain of the type III receptor. In contrast, mutation of Ser-409 to alanine either alone, or in combination with Ser-416, completely blocked the ability of the type II receptor to interact with the cytoplasmic domain of the type III receptor. To investigate the ability of these autophosphorylation mutants of the type II receptor to phosphorylate the type III receptor and autophosphorylate in vivo, the type III receptor was expressed in the presence of either the type II receptor or the autophosphorylation site mutants of the type II receptor, the cells were labeled with 32Pi, and the phosphorylation state of the type III receptor and type II receptor was analyzed by immunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig.5 B, all of the type II recep"

Lu-ECAM-1 protein, like all other members of the CLCA family, is synthesized as an ∼125-kDa precursor protein that, upon membrane incorporation, is rapidly processed into N-terminal 90-kDa and C-terminal 35-kDa components (15Elble R.C.

The 90-kDa polypeptide is responsible for the adhesion qualities of CLCAs, promoting the Ca2+-dependent adhesion of a variety of lung metastatic cancer cells but not cancer cells that metastasize to other organ sites (12Pauli B.U.

Fuller C.M. Pauli B.U. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1261-C1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is identified as the human counterpart of Lu-ECAM-1. We show that hCLCA2 is expressed by endothelia from different lung vascular compartments and that lung colonization of established human breast cancer cell lines is dependent upon the tumor cells' ability to interact with hCLCA2. Breast cancer cell adhesion to hCLCA2 is mediated by the β4 integrin, which is prominently expressed in breast cancer cells that are able to colonize the lungs upon tail vein injection of nude mice (20Price J.E. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1996; 39: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Cell-to-cell adhesion assays, adhesion-blocking assays with antibodies generated against either of the two interacting molecules, and overexpression of β4 in a murine model tumor cell line are used to confirm involvement of the β4 integrin/hCLCA2 adhesion mechanism in lung metastasis. Together, our data confirm that the α6β4 integrin is a lung metastasis-associated gene (21Rabinovitz I. Mercurio A.M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 811-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and establish for the first time a cell-to-cell adhesion property for the β4 integrin that involves an entirely new integrin adhesion partner. Anti-Lu-ECAM-1 mAb 6D3 was produced in BALB/c mice (22Zhu D.Z. Pauli B.U. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1991; 39: 1137-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and selected for adhesion blocking of B16-F10 melanoma cells to Lu-ECAM-1-expressing bovine aortic endothelial cells (13Zhu D.Z.

Invest. 1992; 89: 1718-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) 4 and 18 were generated against the hCLCA2 peptides KANNNSKIKQESYEKANV (amino acids 94–111) and ESTGENVKPHHQLKNTVTVD (amino acids 498–517), respectively. Antibodies against the β4 integrin ectodomain included mouse mAb 3E1 (Life Technologies, Inc.), rabbit pAb H101 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and rabbit pAb 81435 directed against TA3/HA mouse mammary carcinoma cells (Dr. E. Roos, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam) (23Kemperman H. Wijnands Y. de Rijk D. Roos E. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3611-3617PubMed Google Scholar). Rat anti-human α6 integrin mAb GoH3 was from PharMingen (San Diego, CA), mouse anti-human β1 mAb 2253 from Chemicon (Temecula, CA), and mouse anti-human Myc mAb 9E10 and anti-phosphotyrosine mAb from Calbiochem. Human placental and murine EHS laminins as well as all other reagents were from Sigma. Human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, -435, -468, and -453 and MCF7 were from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). MDA-MB-435L2 was from Dr. J. E. Price (The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX) (20Price J.E. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1996; 39: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and MDA-MB-435 transfected with wild type human β4 integrin or tailless β4 integrin (β4Δcyt) were from Dr. A. M. Mercurio (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) (24Shaw L.M. Chao C. Wewer U.M. Mercurio A.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 959-963PubMed Google Scholar). Human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-L) and human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) were from Clonetics (San Diego, CA). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK293), and Kirsten Ras-transformed Balb/3T3 (K-Balb/3T3) cells were from the ATCC. HMVEC-L were grown in EGM-2-MV BulletKit medium (Clonetics), and all others were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies). Total RNA isolated from HMVEC-L, HAEC, and HUVEC was reverse-transcribed, and an 800-base pair hCLCA2 product amplified by PCR, using ttctctacaacatgacccaaaggagc and catgggaaagctgtggtgaaag as 5′ and 3′ primers, respectively, andTaq polymerase (Life Technologies) (19Gruber A.D. Schreur K.D. Ji H.L. Fuller C.M. Pauli B.U. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1261-C1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The full-length 2.9-kilobase pair open reading frame of hCLCA2 was amplified from HMVEC-L RNA, using primers corresponding to the 5′ (ttctctacaacatgacccaaaggagc) and 3′ (gacactttggatatttatttataataattttgttc) ends of the hCLCA2 open reading frame. Both primer sets were tested on cloned plasmid templates to ascertain that they would not recognize other CLCA homologs. RNA extracted from HEK293 cells and processed in parallel served as negative control. Lung expression of hCLCA2 was analyzed by staining sections of paraffin-embedded, formaldehyde (4%)-fixed tissue with rabbit anti-hCLCA2 antiserum (pAb 4) at a 1:100 dilution (13Zhu D.Z. Cheng C.F. Pauli B.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9568-9572Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 22Zhu D.Z. Pauli B.U. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1991; 39: 1137-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Preimmune serum used at the same dilution served as control. Myc-tagged hCLCA2 constructs were generated as described and transfected into 80% confluent HEK293 using the LipofectAMINE™ Plus protocol (Life Technologies) (19Gruber A.D. Schreur K.D. Ji H.L. Fuller C.M. Pauli B.U. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1261-C1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated and immunopurified hCLCA2 were from extracts of transfected HEK293 cells (48 h after transfection), using anti-Myc mAb 9E10-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG Dynabeads (or Protein G beads). Surface expression of hCLCA2 was confirmed by cell surface biotinylation (100 μg/ml BiotinN-hydroxysuccinimide) (25Cheng H.C. Abdel-Ghany M. Elble R.C. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24207-24215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Western blot analyses were done with anti-Myc mAb 9E10 (19Gruber A.D. Schreur K.D. Ji H.L. Fuller C.M. Pauli B.U. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1261-C1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The tumor cell ligand of hCLCA2 was isolated from lysates of surface-biotinylated MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells bound to a monolayer of transiently transfected Myc-hCLCA2-HEK293 cells by co-immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc mAb 9E10. In brief, MDA-MB-231 cells (5 × 104 tumor cells/cm2 of HEK293 monolayer surface) were allowed to adhere to Myc-hCLCA2-HEK293 monolayers (or control vector-transfected HEK293 monolayers) during a 20-min incubation period. After removing unbound tumor cells by washing, bound tumor cells and HEK293 cells were extracted in lysis buffer (26Giancotti F.G. Stepp M.A. Suzuki S. Engvall E. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 951-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 27Potts A.J. Croall D.E. Hemler M.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 212: 2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc mAb 9E10. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE (6% polyacrylamide), blotted to nitrocellulose, and probed with streptavidin-HRP or anti-β4 mAb 3E1 followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. Alternatively, the hCLCA2 tumor cell ligand was isolated by affinity chromatography from surface-biotinylated MDA-MB-231 cells using Myc-hCLCA2-conjugated anti-Myc mAb 9E10/goat anti-mouse IgG Dynabeads. Beads were boiled in SDS-sample buffer, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted to nitrocellulose. Blots were probed with streptavidin-HRP, anti-β4 mAb 3E1, or anti-Myc mAb 9E10. Purification of β4 was accomplished with anti-β4 mAb 3E1-conjugated Protein G beads from lysates of MDA-MB-231 cells (108 cells/preparation). To further corroborate the specificity of the β4/hCLCA2 adhesion, MDA-MB-231 cancer cells were labeled with H332PO4(0.5 mCi/ml) in phosphate-free DMEM for 4 h at 37 °C and then seeded onto BSA-, fibronectin-, hCLCA2-, laminin-, and poly-l-lysine-coated dishes and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-β4 mAb 3E1, and precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, treated with 1 m KOH for 2 h at 55 °C, and autoradiographed to visualize β4 integrin tyrosine phosphorylation (28Abdel-Ghany M. Kole H.K. Racker E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8888-8892Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). β4 (immunopurified from MDA-MB-231), β1 (α5β1), and β3 (αvβ3) (both from Chemicon) integrins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, blotted to nitrocellulose, denatured with 2.5 m guanidine, and renatured in 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (29). Blots were incubated with Myc-tagged hCLCA2 (overnight; 4 °C), and bound hCLCA2 was detected with anti-Myc mAb 9E10, followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. Controls included blots probed with antibody alone. Positions on the gel and loading quantities of the β integrins were determined in parallel Western blots. Wild-type β4 cDNA cloned into the expression vector pRC-CMV was from Dr. F. G. Giancotti. K-Balb/3T3 cells at 70% confluence were stably transfected with β4cDNA by electroporation and selected for G418 resistance. Controls were K-Balb/3T3 cells transfected with vector alone. Cells were used for (a) FACS to quantify β4 surface expression (25Cheng H.C. Abdel-Ghany M. Elble R.C. Pauli B.U. J. Biol.

Invest. 1992; 89: 1718-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). FACS analyses, adhesion assays, and lung colony assays were performed as previously described in detail by our laboratory (12Pauli B.U. Lee C.L. Lab. Invest. 1988; 58: 379-387PubMed Google Scholar, 13Zhu D.Z. Cheng C.F. Pauli B.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9568-9572Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 14Zhu D. Cheng C.F.

Chem. 1998; 273: 24207-24215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Human CLCA2 was cloned from a human lung cDNA library, and its amino acid sequence, protein processing, transmembrane topography, and channel properties are described elsewhere (19Gruber A.D. Schreur K.D. Ji H.L. Fuller C.M. Pauli B.U. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1261-C1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Northern blot hybridization and/or RT-PCR revealed epithelial expression of hCLCA2 in the mammary gland and trachea (19Gruber A.D. Schreur K.D. Ji H.L. Fuller C.M. Pauli B.U. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1261-C1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry demonstrated endothelial cell expression in the lungs (Fig.1). In the latter, hCLCA2 protein was expressed selectively in endothelia of small pulmonary arteries, arterioles, and subpleural and interlobular venules (Fig. 1,A–F), while endothelia in other tissues including brain, liver, pancreas, kidney, alimentary tract, testis, ovary, adrenal gland, thyroid, and skeletal muscle were negative (data not shown). Strong hCLCA2 expression was also observed in cultured HMVEC-L lung microvascular endothelial cells, while a weak hCLCA2 expression was recorded for endothelial cells derived from human aorta (HAEC) and umbilical vein (HUVEC) (Fig. 1G). Expression of hCLCA2 protein in HMVEC-L was confirmed by FACS, using the same polyclonal antibody that had been employed in the immunohistochemical studies (Fig. 1H). The selective expression of hCLCA2 on endothelia of lung blood vessels, which recently were implicated with location of tumor cell arrest and early intravascular micrometastasis formation by in situ epifluorescence microscopy (11Al Mehdi A.B. Tozawa K. Fisher A.B. Shientag L. Lee A. Muschel R.J. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), suggested that hCLCA2 could serve as the human counterpart of Lu-ECAM-1 and might play a major role in lung metastasis of blood-borne human cancer cells. To test this hypothesis, we selected three human breast cancer cells with different biological behaviors for adhesion to recombinant Myc-tagged hCLCA2 immunopurified from transfected HEK293 cells. The first cell line was MDA-MB-231, which efficiently colonizes the lungs of nude mice following tumor formation from cancer cells injected into mammary fat pads (orthotopic tumor xenografts) or intravenous injection; the second cell line was MDA-MB-435, which only forms lung metastases from orthotopic tumor xenografts but not after intravenous injection; and the third cell line was MCF7, which is nonmetastatic by either of the two modalities (20Price J.E. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1996; 39: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Consistent with the proposed role of hCLCA2 in lung metastasis, only MDA-MB-231 cells adhered in strong numbers to recombinant hCLCA2 (Fig.2A). Adhesion correlated with the amount of Myc-tagged hCLCA2 protein present in elution fractions from anti-Myc mAb 9E10 immunoaffinity columns and was dependent upon serum activation of tumor cells (Fig. 2B). To identify the tumor cell molecule that served as the ligand for hCLCA2, surface-biotinylated MDA-MB-231 cancer cells were allowed to bind to confluent monolayers of Myc-tagged hCLCA2- or vector-transfected HEK293 cells, yielding tumor cell adhesion values of ∼75% for Myc-hCLCA2-HEK293 monolayers and 25% for vector-transfected HEK293 monolayers. Myc-hCLCA2-HEK293 monolayers were extracted together with bound tumor cells, and extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc mAb 9E10. Precipitated proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted to nitrocellulose were then probed with streptavidin-HRP. A single band of molecular size 205 kDa was identified that by Western analysis with anti-β4 mAb 3E1 was shown to be β4 integrin (Fig. 2C). Subsequent immunoprecipitation of Myc-hCLCA2-HEK293/MDA-MB-231 cell extracts with anti-β4 pAb H101 and Western probing of the precipitate with anti-Myc mAb 9E10 identified hCLCA2, further confirming the β4integrin/hCLCA2 adhesion (Fig. 2D). Controls conducted with MDA-MB-231 cancer cells bound unspecifically to vector-transfected HEK293 monolayers did not yield any precipitate. Expansion of our initial hCLCA2/tumor cell adhesion studies to MDA-MB-435L2, MDA-MB-468, and MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cell lines supported the close correlation between surface expression of the β4 integrin, hCLCA2 adhesion, and lung colonization (Fig. 3,A–D). For example, the consistently high lung colonization potential of the MDA-MB-231 cell line correlated with high levels of β4 integrin expression and hCLCA2 adhesion, while modest lung colonization of the MDA-MB-435L2 cell line was associated with modest β4 expression and hCLCA2 adhesion (Fig. 3,A–D). All other breast cancer cell lines were unable to form lung colonies and, with the exception of the MDA-MB-468 cell line, expressed low or nondetectable levels of the β4 integrin and adhered poorly to hCLCA2 (Fig. 3, A–D). In the metastatically incompetent MDA-MB-468 cell line, an intermediate level of β4 expression correlated with a well differentiated, near normal cellular phenotype in vitro and slow adenomatous growth in vivo, implying that the MDA-MB-468 cell line represents an early stage in tumor progression.Figure 3The β4integrin expression correlates with hCLCA2 adhesion and lung colonization: FACS analyses of MDA-MB-231 (A), MDA-MB-435 (435) and MDA-MB-435L2 (435L2) (B), MDA-MB-468 (C), and MCF7 (D).Tumor cells were stained with either mouse anti-β4 mAb 3E1 (open histogram) or mouse IgG (gray filled histogram) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat-anti mouse IgG secondary antibody and then subjected to FACS analyses. The percentage of tumor cell adhesion to hCLCA2-coated dishes (3 μg/ml) and the number of lung colonies formed by each breast cancer cell line are displayed asinsets.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Since isolation of the β4 integrin-hCLCA2 complex from MDA-MB-231/Myc-hCLCA2-HEK293 extracts and hCLCA2 affinity purification of the β4 integrin from MDA-MB-231 extracts (data not shown) were unable to rule out participation of an unknown, intermediary molecule in the binding of hCLCA2 to β4integrin, the β4/hCLCA2 partnership was further examined by Far Western analysis. To accomplish this, adhesion receptor and ligand were first immunopurified from hCLCA2-transfected HEK293 cells and MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively, and their purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. After subjecting the SDS-PAGE resolved, blotted β4 integrin to cycles of denaturing and renaturing, blots were probed with Myc-tagged hCLCA2, and hCLCA2-binding to β4 was visualized by anti-Myc antibodies. hCLCA2 strongly and specifically bound to β4integrin, but not to the control β integrin subunits β1and β3 (Fig. 4A,lanes 1, 3, and 5). Control blots incubated with anti-Myc antibody alone were negative (Fig.4A, lanes 2, 4, and6). Western blotting (Fig. 4A, lanesmarked W) confirmed positions and equal loading amounts of the three β integrins. To further scrutinize the specificity of the β4/hCLCA2 adhesion, Far Western analyses were also conducted with blot-immobilized hCLCA2 (Fig. 4B,lane W) that was probed with soluble β4 integrin immunopurified from MDA-MB-231 cell extracts. Binding of the β4 integrin to hCLCA2 was confirmed by staining with anti-β4 pAb H101 (Fig. 4B,lane 1), while blots that were stained with antibody alone in the absence of β4 integrin were negative (Fig. 4B, lane 2). The specificity of the β4 integrin/hCLCA2 adhesion was confirmed by adhesion blocking experiments involving antibodies directed against either of the interacting adhesion molecules. Dramatic adhesion inhibition was seen only for anti-hCLCA2 pAb 18 and anti-β4 mAb 3E1, while all other antibodies tested had no effect on the β4/hCLCA2 adhesion (Fig.5, A and B). Neither of the two anti-hCLCA2 antibodies had any effect on the adhesion of MDA-MB-231 cells to human placenta-derived laminin used as a control substrate, while both anti-β4 antibodies 3E1 and 81435 inhibited laminin adhesion of MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 5,A and B). To exclude a possible participation of the α6β1 integrin, expressed in all human breast cancer cell lines used in this study, in the hCLCA2 adhesion, functional anti-β1 antibodies (mAb 2253) were tested and found to be ineffective in blocking the adhesion between MDA-MB-231 cells and hCLCA2 but effective in blocking the adhesion to placenta laminin (Fig. 5C). In a second series of experiments, we show that selective cleavage of the β4 integrin ectodomain with matrilysin (30von Bredow D.C. Nagle R.B. Bowden G.T. Cress A.E. Exp.

These adhesion data were supported by Western analyses showing specific cleavage of the 205-kDa β4 protein but not the β1integrin in matrilysin-treated tumor cells. Finally, we examined whether the MDA-MB-231 β4 integrin was activated selectively when tumor cells were plated onto surfaces coated with hCLCA2 (Fig. 5E). Data showed prominent tyrosine phosphorylation of β4 integrin in tumor cells bound to hCLCA2 and to placental laminin (31Mainiero F. Pepe A. Wary K.K. Spinardi L. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J.

However, the effect of apolipoprotein A-I and paraoxonase-1 (PON-1) on phosphatidylcholine oxidation products has not been identified. We subjected native HDL, trypsinized HDL, and HDL lipid suspensions to oxidation by the peroxynitrite donor, 3-morpholinosydnonimine. HDL had a basal level of phosphatidylcholine mono- and di-hydroperoxides that increased to a greater extent in HDL, compared with either trypsinized HDL or HDL lipid alone. Phosphatidylcholine core aldehydes, which were present in small amounts, increased 10-fold during oxidation of native HDL, compared with trypsinized HDL (p = 0.004), and 4-fold compared with HDL lipid suspensions (p = 0.0021). In addition, the content of lysophosphatidylcholine increased 300% during oxidation of native HDL, but only 80 and 25%, respectively, during oxidation of trypsinized HDL and HDL lipid suspensions. Phosphatidylcholine isoprostanes accumulated in comparable amounts during the oxidation of all three preparations. Incubation of apolipoprotein A-I with 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl glycerophosphocholine proteoliposomes in the presence of 3-morpholinosydnonimine or apoAI with phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxides resulted in a significant increase in phosphatidylcholine core aldehydes with no formation of lysophosphatidylcholine. We propose that apolipoprotein A-I catalyzes a one-electron oxidation of alkoxyl radicals. Purified PON-1 hydrolyzed phosphatidylcholine core aldehydes to lysophosphatidylcholine. We conclude that, upon HDL oxidation with peroxynitrite, apolipoprotein AI increases the formation of phosphatidylcholine core aldehydes that are subsequently hydrolyzed by PON1.

The oxidative susceptibility and products of the oxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL)1have been the most intensively studied area to date (2Steinbrecher U.P. Parthasarathy S. Leake D.S.

Lab Med. 1999; 37: 939-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), can also undergo oxidation. Within nature, protection of polyunsaturated fatty acids from oxidation has come in the form of water-soluble antioxidant molecules, such as vitamin C, and lipid-soluble anti-oxidant molecules, such as vitamin E. Goulinet and Chapman (9Goulinet S. Chapman M.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 786-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) have shown that there is a marked gradient of the tocopherol and carotenoid classes of lipid-soluble antioxidants among the major lipoproteins. Very low density lipoproteins, LDL, and HDL were shown to have an average of 43, 10, and 0.7 antioxidant molecules per particle, respectively. On this basis alone, one would predict that HDL would be the lipoprotein complex most susceptible to oxidation. Indeed, HDL is as susceptible or more susceptible to oxidation in vitro than is LDL (7Francis G.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1483: 217-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, HDL has been shown to protect LDL from oxidation in vitro (10Mackness M.I. Durrington P.N. Mackness B. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2000; 11: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The factors protecting against formation of lipid hydroperoxides in plasma appear to be apoA-I (11Garner B. Witting P.K. Waldeck A.R. Christison J.K. Raftery M. Stocker R. J. Biol.

Peroxynitrite, the product of nitric oxide and superoxide, is thought to be an important biologically produced oxidant (15Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (6731) Google Scholar, 16Ducrocq C. Blanchard B. Pignatelli B. Ohshima H. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1068-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). It is relevant to cardiovascular disease, as its formation is enhanced by inflammatory responses of macrophages and neutrophils, and in conditions such as ischemia reperfusion (16Ducrocq C. Blanchard B. Pignatelli B. Ohshima H. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1068-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 17Ronson R.S. Nakamura M. Vinten-Johansen J. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 44: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). During an inflammatory response, acute phase HDL is formed, which itself becomes proinflammatory, in contrast to the anti-inflammatory properties of native HDL (18van Lenten B.J. Hama S.Y. de Beer F.C. Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. La Du B.N. Fogelman A.M. Navab M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2758-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 19Khovidhunkit W.

Peroxynitrite can directly oxidize polyunsaturated fatty acids (16Ducrocq C. Blanchard B. Pignatelli B. Ohshima H. Cell Mol.

Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1068-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). As reviewed by Francis (7Francis G.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1483: 217-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), a number of oxidants have been used to modify HDL. These either primarily modify HDL lipid or HDL proteins and most often impair known functions of HDL. Oxidation of HDL by tyrosyl radical affects primarily HDL apoproteins and enhances its activity in reverse-cholesterol transport (7Francis G.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1483: 217-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, the oxidation of HDL by peroxynitrite has not been well characterized. 3-Morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1) generates both nitric oxide and superoxide simultaneously to form peroxynitrite (23Hogg N. Darley-Usmer V.M. Wilson M.T. Moncada S. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Therefore, it mimics the environment that lipoproteins may be exposed to in the vasculature (15Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (6731) Google Scholar). We have compared the oxidation products of native HDL, trypsinized HDL, and HDL lipid suspensions and phosphatidylcholine apoA-I proteoliposomes. Our results show that apoA-I increases the formation of phosphatidylcholine core aldehydes. In addition, we observed that lysophosphatidylcholine was formed in significant amounts only during oxidation of intact HDL, consistent with activation of a phospholipase A2-like activity. We conclude that PON-1 has a phospholipase A2-like activity toward phosphatidylcholine core aldehydes. SIN-1,N-bis(carboxymethylamino)-ethylglycinepentaacetic acid) (DTPA), dipentadecanoylglycerophosphocholine, 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PLPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoylglycero-3-phosphocholine (PAPC), and dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) were from Avanti Inc. (Alabaster, AL); t-butyl-hydroperoxide and trypsin (bovine pancreas) were purchased from Sigma. Polyclonal rabbit anti-human apoA-I and anti-human apoA-II antibodies were prepared in the laboratory (24Connelly P.W. Vezina C. Maguire G.F. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 263: 188-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate was purchased from Bio-Rad. 1-Palmitoyl-2-(5-oxo)valeroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 1-palmitoyl-2-(9-oxo)nonanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and the corresponding core acids were prepared in the laboratory by reductive ozonization of PLPC and PAPC, as described previously (25Ravandi A. Kuksis A. Myher J.J. Marai L. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1995; 30: 271-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Choline phospholipids were measured using the choline phospholipid enzymatic assay kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All solvents used in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry were HPLC grade. Other solvents and chemicals were of reagent grade and were provided by local suppliers. HDL was isolated from serum of subjects fasted for 12–14 h, by ultracentrifugation between densities 1.063 and 1.21 g/ml (26Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar), and exhaustively dialyzed in 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4. HDL (1 mg/ml protein) (27Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5347) Google Scholar) was oxidized by the peroxynitrite donor, SIN-1 (1 mm), for up to 20 h at 37 °C, in the presence of DTPA (100 μm), a metal ion chelator (28Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2060) Google Scholar). At each time point, an aliquot was withdrawn; the oxidation was stopped by the addition of 100 μm butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), and HDL lipid-soluble oxidation products were extracted with chloroform/methanol 2:1 (v/v) (29Shaikh N.A. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The yields of the oxidation products were expressed as μg/mg of phosphatidylcholine at time 0. SDS-PAGE was performed, in the presence of dithiothreitol, using an 11% polyacrylamide gel (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, proteins were either stained, using silver stain (Plus One, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), or transferred to polyvinylidine fluoride membranes and immunoblotted using polyclonal rabbit anti-human apoA-I or anti-human apoA-II antibodies. Lipid-soluble HDL oxidation products were extracted, as described previously, after addition of an internal standard (dipentadecanoyl glycerophosphocholine). The organic phase was evaporated under nitrogen, and lipids were redissolved in 500 μl of chloroform/methanol 2:1 (v/v). LC/ESI/MS analysis was performed using a normal phase silica column (4.6 × 250 mm, Alltech Associates, Deerfield, IL), in a Hewlett-Packard model 1050 liquid chromatograph, connected to a Hewlett-Packard model 5989A Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (MS), equipped with a nebulizer-assisted electrospray ionization (ESI) interface (HP 59987A). The column was eluted with a linear gradient of 100% A (chloroform/methanol/30% ammonium hydroxide, 80:19.5:0.5 by volume) to 100% B (chloroform/methanol/water/30% ammonium hydroxide, 60:34:5.5:0.5 by volume) for 14 min, followed by 100% B for 10 min, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min (31Ravandi A. Kuksis A. Marai L. Mhyer J.J. Steiner G. Lewis G. Kamido H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The effluent was split 1:50, resulting in 20 μl/min being admitted into the mass spectrometer. The retention time for phosphatidylcholine was determined using standard 16:0/20:4 glycerophosphocholine. The capillary exit voltage was set at 150 V, with electron multiplier at 1795 V. Positive ESI spectra were examined in the mass range 450–1100 atomic mass units. The masses given in the figures are nominal masses. The actual masses of the [M + 1]+ (positive ion mode) ions are 1 mass unit higher. The molecular species of the oxidation products were identified based on the molecular mass provided by ESI/MS, the knowledge of the fatty acid composition of the phospholipid classes, and the relative chromatographic retention time of the phosphatidylcholine standard. Trypsin was dissolved in PBS, pH 7.4, and added to HDL at an enzyme to HDL protein ratio of 1:10. The mixture was incubated overnight at 37 °C. HDL was diluted to 1 mg/ml using PBS and subjected to oxidation with SIN-1. At specific times, 1 ml of the oxidation mixture was withdrawn, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μm BHT, followed by extraction of the HDL lipids. HDL was extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and the solvent removed under N2. Buffer was added; the sample was vortexed, and the lipid suspension was sonicated (model 1200 bath sonicator, Branson Instruments) for 2 min. This preparation, referred to as HDL lipid suspension, was oxidized with SIN-1 at 37 °C for up to 6 h, under conditions similar to those used for HDL oxidation. Lipid-soluble oxidation products were extracted with chloroform/methanol 2:1 (v/v), and after addition of the internal standard, dipentadecanoyl glycerophosphocholine, specimens were prepared for LC/ESI/MS analysis. HDL was isolated from serum taken from subjects fasted for 12–14 h, by ultracentrifugation between densities 1.063 and 1.21 g/ml, and exhaustively dialyzed in PBS, pH 7.4. ApoA-I was isolated by ion-exchange HPLC using an Aquapore AX-300 column (3 cm × 4.6 mm, Pierce) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, using a gradient of 0.03 m Tris, pH 7.45, 40% isopropyl alcohol to 0.3 m Tris, pH 7.45, 50% acetonitrile, run over 15 min. 1-Palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl glycerophosphocholine hydroperoxides were prepared by incubation of PLPC with 10 mm t-butyl-hydroperoxide at 37 °C for 1 h, at which time the reaction was terminated by addition of BHT to a final concentration of 100 μm (32Hall L.M. Murphy R.C. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 258: 184-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Proteoliposomes enriched in PLPC hydroperoxides were prepared with PLPC hydroperoxides/lysophosphatidylcholine/apoA-I in the molar ratio of 57:170:1 (33Verdery III, R.B. Nichols A.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 57: 1271-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and were incubated for up to 6 h at 37 °C in the presence of 100 μm DTPA. Proteoliposomes to be used for oxidation experiments, including controls, were prepared by cholate dialysis of emulsions of apoA-I/PLPC/DMPC/cholesterol in a molar ratio 1:18:82:5 (34Sorci-Thomas M.G. Parks J.S. Kearns M.W. Pate G.N. Zhang C. Thomas M.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 673-683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ApoAI was also exposed to SIN-1 for 2 h and used at the same molar ratio as described above. Proteoliposomes were incubated with 1 mm SIN-1 for up to 6 h at 37 °C in the presence of 100 μm DTPA, at a final amount of 150 μg of phosphatidylcholine. Liposomes (without protein) were also prepared and oxidized by SIN-1. At each time point, for all experiments, an aliquot was withdrawn; the oxidation was stopped by the addition of BHT (final concentration, 100 μm), and lipid-soluble oxidation products were extracted with chloroform/methanol 2:1 (v/v). The lipid extract was dried under nitrogen and redissolved in 500 μl of chloroform/methanol for LC/ESI/MS analysis. Proteoliposomes were prepared by cholate dialysis (35Chen C.H. Albers J.J. J. Lipid Res. 1982; 23: 680-691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, apoA-I in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, was added to a dried lipid film containing equimolar quantities of 1-palmitoyl-2-(5-oxo)valeroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and the corresponding carboxylic acid, 1-palmitoyl-2-glutaroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (C5 Ald PC and C5 Acid PC) or 1-palmitoyl-2-(9-oxo)nonanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and the corresponding carboxylic acid 1-palmitoyl-2-azelaoylsn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (C9 Ald PC and C9 Acid PC), with dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine and free cholesterol in molar ratio 0.8:30:30:190:12.5. The dispersed liposomes were dialyzed overnight against 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl buffer, pH 7.4. PON-1 Q192 type was purified from outdated human plasma through (pseudo) affinity chromatography using Cibacron Blue 3GA (Sigma) and anion-exchange chromatography consisting of two consecutive DEAE-Bio-Gel A (Bio-Rad) columns as described (36Gan K.N. Smolen A. Eckerson H.W. La Du B.N. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1991; 19: 100-106PubMed Google Scholar,37Kuo C.L. La Du B.N. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1995; 23: 935-944PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE analysis of purified PON-1 showed one broad band at 45 kDa corresponding to PON-1. In order to check for other residual protein contaminants such as PAF-AH or lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase, we analyzed the PON-1 preparation by reverse phase-high pressure liquid chromatography using Supelcosil LC-8 (250 × 4.6 mm inner diameter, Supelco, Bellefonte, PA), in Hewlett-Packard model 1090 liquid chromatograph equipped with photodiode array detector (Waters 990). The UV absorbance detector was set to 280 nm. The column was eluted with a linear gradient of 10% A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/water) to 80% B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile) in 20 min, followed by 80% B for 5 min, at a flow rate 1 ml/min. Further confirmation of the purity of our PON-1 preparation was obtained by microcapillary electrospray LC/MS/MS. Briefly, the equivalent of 1 μg of PON-1 in 100 mmNH4HCO3, 1 mm CaCl2buffer, pH 8.5, was digested by trypsin overnight at 37 °C with 2 μl of immobilized trypsin Poros beads (Perspective Biosystems). The digested peptides were fractionated on a 7.5-cm (100 μm inner diameter) reverse phase C18 capillary column, attached in-line to a Finnigan LCQ-Deca ion trap mass spectrometer. The entire digested sample was loaded as described by Gatlin et al. (38Gatlin C.L. Kleemann G.R. Hays L.G. Link A.J. Yates III., J.R. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 263: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), and the peptides were eluted by ramping a linear gradient from 2 to 60% solvent B in 90 min. Solvent A consisted of 5% acetonitrile, 0.5% acetic acid, and 0.02% HFBA and solvent B consisted of 80:20 (v/v) acetonitrile/water, containing 0.5% acetic acid and 0.02% HFBA. The flow rate at the tip of the needle was set to 300 nl/min by programming the HPLC pump and use of a split line. The mass spectrometer cycled through four scans as the gradient progressed. The first was a full mass scan, followed by three tandem mass scans of the successive three most intense ions. A dynamic exclusion list was used to limit collection of tandem mass spectra for peptides that eluted over a long period. All tandem mass spectra were searched using the SEQUEST computer algorithm against the complete non-redundant protein data base (6/2000). Each high scoring peptide sequence was manually compared with the corresponding tandem mass spectrum to ensure the match was correct. Neither lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase nor PAF-AH was detected. PON-1 arylesterase was determined using 1 mm phenyl acetate as the substrate, and the product was monitored at 270 nm at 25 °C in 20 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mm CaCl2. Blanks were used to correct for the spontaneous hydrolysis of phenyl acetate. PON-1 arylesterase activity was calculated as described (39Eckerson H.W. Wyte C.M. La Du B.N. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1983; 35: 1126-1138PubMed Google Scholar). All results are expressed as mean ± S.D. Comparisons among treatments were tested for statistical significance using repeated measures analysis of variance in Prism 3.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). Bonferroni post-t tests were used for statistical comparison of individual time points. Representitive total positive ion current profiles for HDL, oxidized HDL, and oxidized HDL lipids are shown in Fig.1. LC/ESI/MS analysis of HDL (Fig.1 A) showed phosphatidylcholine as the major component with smaller amounts of sphingomyelin and lysophosphatidylcholine, which are eluted in order of increasing polarity. An examination of the total ion current averaged over the phosphatidylcholine peak from HDL showed that the major components were 16:0/18:2 (m/z 758), 16:0/20:4 (m/z 782), 18:1/18:2 (m/z 784), 18:0/18:2 (m/z 786), and 18:0/20:4 (m/z 810) glycerophosphocholines. A minor peak was seen for the ethanolamine phospholipids, which are best determined in the negative ion mode. Following a 6-h incubation with SIN-1, the phosphatidylcholine peak was greatly reduced (Fig. 1 B), whereas the peak for lysophosphatidylcholine was greatly increased. Peaks were seen with retention times corresponding to phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxides, isoprostanes, and core aldehydes. The mass spectrum, averaged over the lysophosphatidylcholine peak, indicated the presence of the 16:0 (m/z 494) and 18:0 (m/z 522) species as major components in both native and oxidized HDL. In contrast to HDL, phosphatidylcholine in the HDL lipid suspensions was much less affected by SIN-1 (Fig. 1 C), as seen from the limited accumulation of phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxides, isoprostanes, core aldehydes, and lysophosphatidylcholine. The mass spectra of the major components eluting from 16.5 to 18.0 min of a typical profile for HDL after 6 h of oxidation with SIN-1 is shown in Fig. 2. The major ions includedm/z 790 (34:2 monohydroperoxy glycerophosphocholine);m/z 846 (36:4 dihydroperoxy glycerophosphocholine);m/z 830 (36:4 E2/D2isoprostanes), m/z 858 (38:4 E2/D2isoprostanes), m/z 832, (36:4 F2 isoprostanes), and m/z 860 (38:4 F2 isoprostanes) glycerophosphocholine (Fig. 2 A). The major ions of a representative profile of HDL oxidized for 6 h and averaged over 19.0–21.5 min are shown in Fig. 2 B. The ions m/z594 (16:0/5:0), m/z 650 (16:0/9:0), and m/z 678 (18:0/9:0) represent the molecular ions of core aldehydes of glycerophosphocholines. There was also a small ion, m/z 622, representing the 18:0/5:0 core aldehyde glycerophosphocholine. The major mono- and dihydroperoxy phosphatidylcholines present following a 2-h incubation of HDL with SIN-1 are shown in Fig.3. The single positive ion mass chromatograms showed the m/z 814 (36:4) and m/z816 (36:2) monohydroperoxides and the m/z 846 (36:4),m/z 848 (36:3), and m/z 874 (38:4) dihydroperoxide glycerophosphocholines. The monohydroperoxides eluted from the normal phase column before the dihydroperoxides, regardless of the length of the fatty acyl chains. The major isoprostane derivatives of phosphatidylcholine present following a 2-h incubation of HDL with SIN-1 are shown in Fig.4. Single positive ion mass chromatograms for the ions m/z 830 and 858 correspond to the 36:4 and 38:4 E2/D2 isoprostanes, whereas the ionsm/z 832 and m/z 860 correspond to the 36:4 and 38:4 F2 isoprostanes. The ion m/z 828 corresponds to an isoprostane-like product, epoxy-isoprostanoylglycerophosphocholine. The isoprostanes eluted as broad peaks, consistent with these compounds being a mixture of regioisomers. The 18:0/F2 isoprostane glycerophosphocholines were identified as homologues possessing 28 additional mass units. The single positive ion mass chromatograms for the major core aldehydes of phosphatidylcholine that were present following a 2-h incubation of HDL with SIN-1 are shown in Fig. 5. The ions at m/z 594 and m/z 622 correspond to the 16:0/5:0 aldehyde and 18:0/5:0 aldehyde glycerophosphocholines, and ions at m/z 650 and m/z 678 correspond to the 16:0/9:0 aldehyde and 18:0/9:0 aldehyde glycerophosphocholines. The ions at m/z 636 and m/z 676 were attributed to the monohydroxy 16:0/9:1 aldehyde and the 18:1/9:0 aldehyde glycerophosphocholines, respectively. The aldehydes are eluted as sharp peaks in order of increasing polarity (decreasing chain length). The accumulation of the hydroperoxides of phosphatidylcholine (Fig.6 A) was most rapid and reached the highest level during oxidation of native HDL, compared with HDL lipid suspensions or trypsinized HDL (p < 0.0013). In contrast, the accumulation of the isoprostane derivatives (Fig.6 B) was much more similar between native and trypsinized HDL and HDL lipid suspensions, although the initial rate of accumulation was highest for the native HDL (p < 0.035). The accumulation of core aldehydes (Fig. 6 C) paralleled that of hydroperoxides and was higher for native HDL than trypsinized HDL or HDL lipid suspensions. The accumulation of the lysophosphatidylcholine (Fig. 6 D) was highest for native HDL (p < 0.0001) compared with HDL lipid suspensions or trypsinized HDL. ApoA-I proteoliposomes were incubated with SIN-1 for up to 6 h, and the formation of core aldehydes was measured. There was a significantly greater increase in PLPC hydroperoxides in the presence of apoA-I (Fig. 7, lower panel) parallel to the accumulation of core aldehydes compared with control (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 7, upper panel). The above experiments provided evidence that apoA-I promoted the formation of core aldehydes. However, to exclude the possibility that reaction between phosphatidylcholine oxidation products and SIN-1 may have confounded the observations, we studied the formation of core aldehydes in the absence of SIN-1 by using phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxides. The effect of apoA-I on the conversion of phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxides into core aldehydes is shown in Fig.8. Phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxides showed a modest decrease in the presence of apoA-I, compared with control incubations in the absence of apoA-I (Fig. 8, upper panel). There was a 2-fold higher concentration of core aldehydes in the presence of apoA-I, compared with the absence"

In the present study, we investigated whether CCR5 was palmitoylated in its carboxyl-terminal domain by generating alanine substitution mutants for the three cysteine residues present in this region, individually or in combination. We found that wild-type CCR5 was palmitoylated, but a mutant lacking all three Cys residues was not. Through the use of green fluorescent fusion proteins and immunofluorescence studies, we found that the absence of receptor palmitoylation resulted in sequestration of CCR5 in intracellular biosynthetic compartments. By using the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching technique, we showed that the non-palmitoylated mutant had impaired diffusion properties within the endoplasmic reticulum. We next studied the ability of the mutants to bind and signal in response to chemokines. Chemokines binding and activation of Gi-mediated signaling pathways, such as calcium mobilization and inhibition of adenylate cyclase, were not affected. However, the duration of the functional response, as measured by a microphysiometer, and the ability to increase [35S]guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate binding to membranes were severely affected for the non-palmitoylated mutant. The ability of RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) and aminooxypentane-RANTES to promote CCR5 endocytosis was not altered by cysteine replacements. Finally, we found that the absence of receptor palmitoylation reduced the human immunodeficiency viruses coreceptor function of CCR5, but this effect was secondary to the reduction in surface expression. In conclusion, we found that palmitoylated cysteines play an important role in the intracellular trafficking of CCR5 and are likely necessary for efficient coupling of the receptor to part of its repertoire of signaling cascades.

HIV-1 infection is initiated by the interaction of the virion envelope glycoprotein with cellular CD4 and a coreceptor that belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. CCR5-using (R5) strains predominate during the early stages of the disease and are responsible for viral transmission. The major role of CCR5 in AIDS pathogenesis has been demonstrated by the almost complete resistance to HIV-1 infection of individuals homozygous for a 32-base pair deletion (Δ32 allele) in the coding region of the receptor (7Samson M.

Repression of CCR5gene transcription has been achieved in T cells by CD28 engagement (14Carroll R.G. Riley J.L. Levine B.L. Feng Y. Kaushal S. Ritchey D.W. Bernstein W. Weislow O.S. Brown C.R.

Sequestration of mutated receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has been described for the Δ32 variant and for other CCR5 variants known to affect chemokine receptor or coreceptor functions (15Rana S.

The level of CCR5 at the cell surface is also regulated by endocytosis, and this mechanism contributes to the blocking of HIV entry by chemokines and chemokine analogs (17Alkhatib G. Locati M.

Several post-translational modifications have also been shown to influence CCR5 expression. Activation of CCR5 by chemokines induces phosphorylation of serine residues within the carboxyl-terminal domain, and this, in turn, plays an important role in receptor desensitization and internalization (20Oppermann M. Mack M. Proudfoot A.E. Olbrich H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8875-8885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Two disulfide bonds linking CCR5 extracellular domains are necessary for maintaining a structural conformation of the receptor compatible with efficient trafficking to the cell surface, ligand binding, and induction of intracellular signaling (21Blanpain C. Lee B. Vakili J. Doranz B.J. Govaerts C. Migeotte I. Sharron M. Dupriez V. Vassart G. Doms R.W. Parmentier M. J. Biol.

Sulfation of CCR5 amino-terminal tyrosines has also been shown to play an important role in gp120 binding and HIV entry (22Farzan M. Mirzabekov T. Kolchinsky P. Wyatt R. Cayabyab M. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Sodroski J. Choe H. Cell. 1999; 96: 667-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). It is well established that for some GPCRs, such as the β2-adrenergic receptor, palmitoylation of cysteine residues in their cytoplasmic tails can modulate their biological activities (23Morello J.P. Bouvier M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that this acylation provides a membrane anchor to the carboxyl-terminal domain and creates a fourth intracellular loop. Palmitate is bound to cysteine side chains through a reversible thioester bond and increases the overall hydrophobicity of the protein domain. Palmitoylation of GPCRs has been shown to affect different functions of the receptors, such as membrane targeting, signaling properties, endocytosis, and recycling. Because of the pleiotropic effects of palmitoylation that have been described on the function of various receptor families (23Morello J.P. Bouvier M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), it is not possible to predict how palmitoylation will affect a specific receptor. No information concerning palmitoylation and its role in chemokine receptors has been reported so far. Most, but not all, chemokine receptors display cysteines in their carboxyl-terminal tails, at positions compatible with palmitoylation. CCR5 has a cluster of three cysteines in this region (Fig. 1 A). In the present study, we investigated the role played by these three cysteine residues in various aspects of CCR5 function. We provide evidence that CCR5 is indeed palmitoylated on these residues. We also found that palmitoylation is necessary to allow efficient CCR5 trafficking to the cell surface and for efficient triggering of intracellular signal transduction pathways. The three cysteines located within the carboxyl-terminal domain of CCR5 (Cys-321, Cys-323, and Cys-324) were mutated into alanine, individually or in combination, by site-directed mutagenesis using the Quickchange method (Stratagene). The 3CysA mutant refers to a receptor in which all three cysteines have been mutated to alanine. Alanine substitutions were made instead of more conservative serine substitutions, in order to avoid additional phosphorylation of the receptor tail. Following sequencing of the constructs, the mutated reading frames were subcloned into the bicistronic expression vector pEFIN3 as described previously (24Samson M. LaRosa G. Libert F. Paindavoine P. Detheux M. Vassart G. Parmentier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24934-24941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) for generation of stable cell lines and in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) for the HIV-1 infection assay. All constructs were verified by sequencing before transfection. Constructs encoding fusion proteins between wtCCR5, or the 3CysA mutant, and enhanced GFP (Packard Instrument Co.) linked to the carboxyl terminus of CCR5 were generated by PCR. CCR5 was amplified with a forward primer containing aBamHI restriction site (5′-TCGAGGATCCAAGATGGATTATCAAGTGTCA-3′) and a reverse primer replacing the TGA stop codon by an XhoI restriction site (5′-TCGACTCGAGCAAGCCCACAGATATTTCC-3′). Enhanced GFP was amplified by a forward primer containing an XhoI restriction site, followed by a flexible tri-glycine linker replacing the ATG start codon (5′-TCGACTCGAGGGGGGAGGTGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAG-3′) and a reverse primer containing an XbaI restriction site after the stop codon (5′-TCGATCTAGATTACTTGTACAGCTCGTCC-3′). Enhanced GFP was then cloned in frame with the CCR5 carboxyl terminus using theXhoI restriction site and the linker sequence LEGGG between the two coding regions. After checking the constructs by sequencing, the fusion proteins coding sequences were transferred into the bicistronic vector pEFIN3, using the BamHI andXbaI restriction sites. CHO-K1 cells were cultured using Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). A plasmid encoding apoaequorin under control of the SRα promoter (25Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was transfected into CHO-K1 cells, using Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Puromycin (100 μg/ml, Calbiochem) selection of transfectants was initiated 2 days after transfection. Individual clones were isolated 3 weeks later, and the most responding clone was selected on the basis of its functional response (luminescence signal) to ionomycin A (100 nm) and ATP (10 μm). Constructs encoding wild-type CCR5 and the various cysteine mutants in the pEFIN3 bicistronic vector were further transfected using Fugene 6 in this apoaequorin-expressing cell line. Selection of transfected cells was made for 14 days with 400 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the population of mixed cell clones expressing wild-type or mutant receptors was used for binding and functional studies. Clones expressing similar amounts of wtCCR5 or 3CysA at the cell surface were selected (clones CCR5-c3 and 3CysA-c1 respectively) following establishment of clonal cell lines by limit dilution and screening by FACS analysis. Clonal CHO-K1 cell lines stably expressing the fusion proteins wtCCR5-GFP and 3CysA-GFP were also established and selected by fluorescence microscopy. Mixed cell populations expressing wtCCR5 or the various cysteine mutants, as well as the clonal lines CCR5-c3 and 3CysA-c1, were assayed for [3H]palmitic acid incorporation. Approximately 5 × 106 cells, at 70% confluence in 10-cm dishes, were washed twice with cold PBS and incubated for 18 h in serum-free Ham's F-12 medium. Cells were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) and metabolically labeled with 0.2 mCi/ml [9,10-3H]palmitic acid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 4 h at 37 °C. The incubation was stopped by washing the cells twice with cold PBS, and the cells were solubilized in 1 ml of solubilization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 tablet of Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) per 10 ml, and 1% (w/v) Cymal TM5 (Antrace, Maumee, OH)) as described (26Mirzabekov T.

Solubilized receptors were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg/ml 2D7, a mAb recognizing a conformation epitope in the second extracellular loop of CCR5, then immunoprecipitated by protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h at 4 °C, and washed three times in solubilization buffer. Samples were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, heated for 1 h at 55 °C, and separated onto 12% gels. One SDS-PAGE, performed with 20% of the immunoprecipitated samples, was transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were incubated, for CCR5 immunodetection, with MC5 (0.5 μg/ml), a monoclonal antibody recognizing a linear epitope in CCR5 amino terminus, and then with a horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse antibody, and the immunoblot was revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The SDS-PAGE performed with the remaining samples was incubated in the Amplify fluorographic reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and dried, and autofluorography was performed for 3 weeks at −70 °C with x-ray films (Fuji). Cell surface expression of the CCR5 variants was measured by flow cytometry using phycoerythrin-conjugated 2D7 (Becton Dickinson), or MC-5. FACS analysis was performed on a FACScan flow cytometer using the CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson). The mean channel fluorescence (MCF) was used to compare the levels of receptor expression at the cell surface. Results were normalized for the MCF obtained for wtCCR5 with the 2D7 antibody (100%) after subtraction of the nonspecific fluorescence obtained for untransfected cells (0%). For immunofluorescence studies, stable CHO-K1 cell lines expressing wild-type or mutant CCR5 were grown on uncoated glass coverslips for 24 h. Coverslips were rinsed with PBS, fixed for 10 min in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and washed three times for 10 min with Tris-buffered saline (TBS). For intracellular staining, the cells were permeabilized by a 5-min incubation with 0.15% Triton X-100 in TBS and washed three time in TBS. Fixed or permeabilized cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 5% normal sheep serum in TBS. Incubation with 5 μg/ml of the MC-5 mAb was performed overnight in the presence of 5% normal sheep serum. Cells were rinsed three times in TBS, incubated for 60 min in the dark with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled sheep anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:30 dilution, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), washed three times in TBS and once in water, and mounted with a drop of gelvatol solution containing 100 mg/ml 1,4-diazabicyclo(2.2.2)octane antifading agent (Sigma). Cells were observed on an MRC 1024 confocal microscope (Bio-Rad) fitted on an Axiovert 100 inverted microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with a Plan-NeofluarTM40×/1.3 oil immersion objective (Zeiss). The 488 nm excitation beam of an argon-krypton laser and a 522/32 nm band-pass emission filter were used for selective viewing of the green fluorochrome. Fields of interest (512 × 512 pixels) were selected visually. The gray scale data sets generated were transferred to an IndyTMwork station (Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA) running the ImageSpaceTM software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnydale, CA). No labeling was observed on untransfected CHO-K1 cells using MC-5 or on transfected cells using a control IgG mAb (data not shown). Figures were prepared on a PowerMacTM (Apple, Cupertino, CA) running FreehandTM (Macromedia, San Francisco, CA) and IllustratorTM (Adobe, San Francisco, CA) software. For the confocal study of wtCCR5-GFP or 3CysA-GFP in living cells, the cell clones were seeded the day before the analysis on 22-mm round glass coverslips and grown for 18 h in a CO2incubator. Cells were rinsed in DMEM/F-12 (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the coverslips were placed in a 1-ml chamber with 200 μl of culture medium. Experiments were performed at 37 °C on a temperature-controlled stage, and images were analyzed as described above for immunofluorescence studies. Diffusion of the receptor within the intracellular cell membrane compartments was measured by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) using the MRC 1024 confocal microscope (see above). A defined region was photobleached at full laser power (100%) for 10 scans, and recovery was monitored by scanning the whole cell at low laser power (3 to 10%). The first image was recorded 30–40 s after photobleaching (the time required for adjusting the optics and resetting the instrument), and subsequent images were recorded every 20 s. Quantitative measurements of fluorescence, for generating recovery plots, and D and M values, were obtained by using macros written in the NIH Image freeware. The fluorescence signal of an unbleached cell area was measured before and at each time point after photobleaching. All FRAP values were normalized according to these control values, but even after 60 scans, the correction factor never exceeded 20% of the initial value. Diffusion parameters were obtained as described (27Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Martenson C. Meyer T. Caron M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and were calculated by non-linear regression using the GraphPad PRISM software. Mixed populations of CHO-K1 cells expressing wild-type or mutant CCR5 were collected from plates with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS supplemented with 5 mm EDTA, gently pelleted for 2 min at 1000 ×g, and resuspended in binding buffer (50 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.5% BSA). Competition binding assays were performed in Minisorb tubes (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark), using 0.08 nm125I-MIP-1β (2200 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as tracer for wtCCR5 and the single cysteine mutant or 0.12 nm125I-MIP-1β for the double and triple cysteine mutants, variable concentrations of competitors, and 40,000 cells in a final volume of 0.1 ml. Total binding was measured in the absence of competitor, and nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled ligand. Samples were incubated for 90 min at 27 °C and then bound tracer was separated by filtration through GF/B filters presoaked in 1% BSA. Filters were counted in a β-scintillation counter. Binding parameters were determined with the PRISM software (Graphpad Software, San Diego, CA) using nonlinear regression applied to a one-site competition model. The functional response to chemokines was analyzed by measuring the luminescence of aequorin as described (21Blanpain C. Lee B. Vakili J. Doranz B.J. Govaerts C. Migeotte I. Sharron M. Dupriez V.

Cells were collected from plates with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS supplemented with 5 mm EDTA, pelleted for 2 min at 1000 × g, resuspended in DMEM at a density of 5 × 106 cells/ml, and incubated for 2 h in the dark in the presence of 5 μm coelenterazine H (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Cells were diluted 7.5-fold before use. Agonists in a volume of 50 μl of DMEM were added to 50 μl of the cell suspension (33,000 cells), and luminescence was measured for 30 s in a EG & G Berthold (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Functional parameters were determined with the PRISM software (Graphpad Software) using nonlinear regression applied to a sigmoidal dose-response model. CCR5-c3 and 3CysA-c1 cells were spread on Petri dishes (250,000 cells per 35-mm dish) and cultured overnight in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 400 μg/ml G418. Cells were preincubated for 30 min in Krebs-Ringer HEPES (KRH) buffer composed of 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 124 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.25 mm MgSO4, 1.45 mm CaCl2, 1.25 mmKH2PO4 and 8 mm glucose and then incubated for 15 min in the same medium supplemented with 10 μm forskolin and variable concentrations of MIP-1β. The cAMP accumulation was stopped by replacing the medium with 0.1m HCl. Cells debris were pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was dried off in a vacuum concentrator. The cAMP levels were measured by a radioimmunoassay kit (TRK 432, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the procedure specified by the manufacturer. The basal cAMP level was determined in the absence of forskolin stimulation and subtracted from forskolin-stimulated values. Functional parameters were determined with the PRISM software (Graphpad Software), using nonlinear regression. The data represent the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation, and the experiments were performed in duplicate. CCR5-c3 or 3CysA-c1 cells were plated onto the membrane of Transwell capsules (Molecular Devices), at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/well in Ham's F-12 medium. The next day, the capsules were transferred to a microphysiometer (Cytosensor, Molecular Devices), and the cells were allowed to equilibrate for ∼2 h by perfusion of 1 mm phosphate-buffered RPMI 1640 medium (pH 7.4). Cells were then exposed to MIP-1β at the final concentration of 100 nm for 2 min. Acidification rates were measured at 1-min intervals. For the measurement of RANTES-stimulated GTPγS binding to membranes of cells expressing wtCCR5 or the 3CysA mutant, membranes (10 or 20 μg) from CCR5-c3 or 3CysA-c1 cells were incubated for 15 min at room temperature in GTPγS binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mmNaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 3 μm GDP, 10 μg/ml saponin) containing different concentrations of RANTES, in 96-well microplates (Basic FlashPlates, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). [35S]GTPγS (0.1 nm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added, and microplates were shaken for 1 min and further incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The incubation was stopped by centrifugation of the microplate for 10 min, at 800 ×g and at 4 °C, and aspiration of the supernatant. Microplates were counted in a TopCount (Packard Instrument Co.) for 1 min per well. Functional parameters were determined with the PRISM software (Graphpad Software) using non-linear regression applied to a sigmoidal dose-response model. Chemokine-induced CCR5 endocytosis was quantified as described (19Blanpain C. Migeotte I. Lee B. Vakili J. Doranz B.J. Govaerts C. Vassart G. Doms R.W. Parmentier M. Blood. 1999; 94: 1899-1905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, CCR5-c3 or 3CysA-c1 cells were collected from plates with 5 mm EDTA in PBS, washed with DMEM/F-12, and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C with RANTES or AOP-RANTES at different concentrations. Cells were washed twice with 3 ml of cold PBS supplemented with 0.1% sodium azide and 0.1% BSA, and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with MC-5 (a monoclonal antibody that does not compete with RANTES binding), then stained with a phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse Ig antibody (Sigma). Cells were further washed and resuspended, and their cell fluorescence was analyzed by FACS. GFP was cloned in place of the luciferase gene in the pNL-R-E-luc plasmid (29Connor R.I. Chen B.K. Choe S. Landau N.R. Virology. 1995; 206: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar), and GFP reporter viruses were created by cotransfecting the pNL-R-E-GFP plasmid with plasmids encoding the appropriate Env protein. GFP reporter viruses were used in infection assays in a similar manner to luciferase reporter viruses (29Connor R.I. Chen B.K. Choe S. Landau N.R. Virology. 1995; 206: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). Target cells were prepared by cotransfecting 293T cells with a CD4 plasmid and a variable amount of coreceptor-encoding plasmid. Incubation was done at 37 °C. Two days post-infection, cells were stained for 30 min with the phycoerythrin-labeled 2D7 mAb, washed, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, and cell fluorescence was analyzed by FACS, using a FACScan flow cytometer and the CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). pcDNA3-transfected cells infected with the same amount of GFP reporter viruses were used as controls for background GFP expression. The MCF was used to compare the levels of receptor expression at the cell surface. HIV infection was determined by counting GFP-positive and dual-positive (GFP+2D7-PE) cells. Palmitoylation is known to occur on cysteine residues located in the carboxyl-terminal domain of GPCRs. It has been associated with the modulation of various functional properties, depending on the specific receptor (23Morello J.P. Bouvier M. Biochem.

Using the pro-B cell line BaF3 and a BaF3 cell line stably overexpressing BCR-ABL (BaF3-p210), we investigated the proliferative signals derived from BCR-ABL and IL-3. The results indicate that both IL-3 and BCR-ABL target the expression of cyclin Ds and down-regulation of p27Kip1 to mediate pRB-related pocket protein phosphorylation, E2F activation, and thus S phase progression. These findings were further confirmed in a BaF3 cell line (TonB.210) where the BCR-ABL expression is inducible by doxycyclin and by using the drug STI571 to inactivate BCR-ABL activity in BaF3-p210. To establish the functional significance of cyclin D2 and p27Kip1 expression in response to IL-3 and BCR-ABL expression, we studied the effects of ectopic expression of cyclin D2 and p27Kip1 on cell proliferation and survival. Our results demonstrate that both cyclin D2 and p27Kip1 have a role in BaF3 cell proliferation and survival, as ectopic expression of cyclin D2 is sufficient to abolish the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induced by IL-3 withdrawal or by BCR-ABL inactivation, while overexpression of p27Kip1 can cause cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in the BaF3 cells. Furthermore, our data also suggest that cyclin D2 functions upstream of p27Kip1, cyclin E, and cyclin D3, and therefore, plays an essential part in integrating the signals from IL-3 and BCR-ABL with the pRB/E2F pathway.

Koeffler H.P. Ann. Intern. Med. 1990; 113: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The resultantBCR-ABL genes encode the chimeric BCR-ABL proteins of 230, 210, and 185 kDa (p230, p210, and p185, respectively) which are constitutively active tyrosine kinase activity (2Lugo T.G. Pendergast A.M. Muller A.J. Witte O.N. Science. 1990; 247: 1079-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar), that have been linked to the pathogenesis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)1 and Philadelphia 1 (Ph1) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (3Faderl S.

The p185 BCR-ABL is predominantly found in Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (5Chan L.C. Karhi K.K. Rayter S.I. Heisterkamp N. Eridani S. Powles R. Lawler S.D. Groffen J. Foulkes J.G.

The less common p230 BCR-ABL protein is found primarily in a mild form of CML, defined as Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic neutrophilic leukemia (Ph-positive CNL) (8Haskovec C. Ponzetto C.

Hemopoietic cells rely on the presence of cytokine(s) for their continued growth and survival (10Kinoshita T. Yokota T. Arai K. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 11Williams G.T. Smith C.A. Spooncer E. Dexter T.M. Taylor D.R. Nature. 1990; 343: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-5, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) are pleiotropic cytokines which regulate various cellular functions, including proliferation, survival, and differentiation, in a variety of hemopoietic cells. Interleukin-3 (IL-3) is generated by activated T cells, monocytes/macrophages, and stromal cells, and acts as a growth and survival factor for a number of hemopoietic cells, including mast cells, eosinophils, and basophils. IL-3 mediates its effects through binding to the IL-3 receptor consisting of a IL-3 specific α-subunit and a β-chain also shared by other cytokine receptors, including those of GM-CSF and IL-5 (12Bazan J.F. Immunol. Today. 1990; 11: 350-354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 13Eder M. Geissler G. Ganser A. Stem Cells. 1997; 15: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Mutation studies have demonstrated that the cytoplasmic tail of the common β-chain is critical for transducing proliferation and survival signals (10Kinoshita T. Yokota T. Arai K. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Although the exact mechanism of action of BCR-ABL has not been established, the biological effects of BCR-ABL have been shown to overlap with IL-3. For example, chronic administration of IL-3 or overexpression of IL-3 in mice results in hyperplasia similar to that observed in the chronic phase of CML. Moreover, it has also been shown that progenitor CD34+ cells from some CML patients can survive and proliferate in vitro in the absence of exogenous growth factors (14Strife A. Lambek C. Wisniewski D. Wachter M. Gulati S.C. Clarkson B.D. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 1035-1041PubMed Google Scholar, 15Bedi A. Zehnbauer B.A. Barber J.P. Sharkis S.J. Jones R.J.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Similarly, transformation by BCR-ABL has also been demonstrated to convert IL-3-dependent cell lines to become growth factor independent (17Konopka J.B. Clark S. McLaughlin J. Nitta M. Kato Y.

It is believed that BCR-ABL and IL-3 activate similar intracellular signaling pathways to promote proliferation and survival in cytokine-dependent hematopoietic cells. Expression of BCR-ABL activates multiple signaling cascades, including the Ras, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and JAK/STAT pathways, which have also been implicated in the IL-3-dependent signaling (22Sattler M. Salgia R. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 63-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Among these, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent signaling pathway has been linked to the anti-apoptotic functions of both BCR-ABL and IL-3. Previous studies have suggested that survival signals triggered by IL-3 or BCR-ABL inactivate the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Bad through direct phosphorylation by Akt, a downstream target of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Nevertheless, the role of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/Bad pathway in mediating the anti-apoptotic functions of IL-3 and BCR-ABL is far from clear, as BCR-ABL could also rescue IL-3-dependent cells from apoptosis in the absence of Bad phosphorylation (23Neshat M.S. Raitano A.B. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Sawyers C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1179-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Mammalian cell proliferation is susceptible to regulation by extracellular signals during the early/mid G1 phase of the proliferative cell cycle. After passing the restriction point (R) at mid/late G1, cells become refractory to growth inhibitory signals or do not require growth factors to progress into S phase (24Pardee A.B. Science. 1989; 246: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the two families of G1 cyclins: D-type cyclins (cyclin D1, D2, and D3) and cyclin E (cyclin E1 and E2) (25Lauper N. Beck A.R. Cariou S. Richman L. Hofmann K. Reith W.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5159) Google Scholar), and their dependent kinases (CDKs) control the transition through R. The D and E types of cyclins have specificity for different CDK subunits. The D-type cyclins bind and activate CDK4 and CDK6 exclusively, while cyclin E forms kinase complexes predominantly with CDK2 (26Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5159) Google Scholar, 27Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar). Cyclin E/CDK2 kinase is believed to function downstream of cyclin D (28Kato J. Front Biosci. 1999; 4: D787-792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Geng Y. Whoriskey W. Park M.Y. Bronson R.T. Medema R.H. Li T. Weinberg R.A. Sicinski P. Cell. 1999; 97: 767-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The principal cellular targets of the G1 cyclin-dependent CDKs are the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) family of “pocket proteins,” consisting of pRB, p107, and p130 (30Lam E.W.-F. La Thangue N.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 31Grana X. Garriga J. Mayol X. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3365-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 32Mulligan G. Jacks T. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 223-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In their hypophosphorylated forms, these pRB-related pocket proteins associate with members of the E2F family of transcription factors, thereby negatively regulating transcription activity of E2F-regulated genes, which are important for entry into the S phase of the cell cycle (30Lam E.W.-F. La Thangue N.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 33Nevins J.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 585-593PubMed Google Scholar, 34Sardet C. LeCam L.E.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar). The activities of CDKs are negatively regulated by the WAF/CIP family of CDK inhibitors (CKIs) (p21Cip1, p27Kip1, and p57Kip2), which target a broad spectrum of CDKs, and the INK4 family of CKIs (p15INK4b, p16INK4a, p18INK4c, and p19INK4d), which specifically inhibit cyclin D-CDK4/6 interaction (26Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5159) Google Scholar, 27Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar). In summary, the pRB pathway (i.e.cyclin D, CDKs, CKIs, pRB, and E2F), whose components are important for restriction point control, links the positive and negative proliferative signals to the cell cycle machinery, and inactivation of this pathway, which occurs frequently in human cancer, may alter the growth factor dependence of a cell (26Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5159) Google Scholar, 27Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism by which the proliferative/apoptotic signals transduce from BCR-ABL and IL-3 to the pRB pathway is not defined. Here, we use the IL-3-dependent pro-B cell line BaF3 (36Palacios R. Steinmetz M. Cell. 1985; 41: 727-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) to investigate the role and regulation of the pRB pathway in mediating signals from IL-3 and BCR/ABL signals. The BaF3 cells were cultured at 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin and if necessary, 10% (v/w) WEHI-3B (37Dexter T.M. Garland J. Scott D. Scolnick E. Metcalf D. J. Exp. Med. 1980; 152: 1036-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar) conditioned medium as a source of IL-3. BaF3-p210 cells were generated by retroviral infection of BaF3 cells with retroviruses encoding the bcr-abl gene (38Daley G.Q. Van Etten R.A. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11335-11338Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) followed by selection with 1 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 2 weeks. Expression of BCR-ABL was confirmed with anti-ABL antibodies (Pharmingen). The pBabe-puro cyclin D2 was constructed by inserting full-length mouse cyclin D2 cDNA (39Matsushime H. Roussel M.F. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 701-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar) into the BamHI cloning site of the pBabe-puro expression vector. BaF3-cyclin D2 and BaF3-p210-cyclin D2 cell lines were established (39Matsushime H. Roussel M.F. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 701-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar) after transfecting BaF3 and BaF3-p210 cells by electroporation (0.25 V; 960 microfarads) with pBabe-puro cyclin D2 and selection with 0.7 mg/ml puromycin. The TonB210.1 BaF3 cell line contains tetracycline-inducible BCR-ABL p210 and was a kind gift from Dr. G. Daley (40Klucher K.M. Lopez D.V. Daley G.Q. Blood. 1998; 91: 3927-3934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TonB210.1 cells were routinely cultured with IL-3, except during IL-3 starvation, when the cells were incubated without IL-3 in the presence of 1% fetal calf serum and RPMI medium. BCR-ABL expression was induced by adding 1 μg/ml doxycyclin (Sigma). The anti-BCR-ABL drug STI571 was provided by Elisabeth Buchdunger, Novartis, and administered to BaF3 cells at a concentration of 10 μm. The expression plasmids for TAT-p27Kip1 WT, TAT-p27Kip1 KK, TAT-eGFP, and TAT-β-galactosidase were obtained from Dr. S. Dowdy, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO (41Nagahara H.

Vocero-Akbani A. Dowdy S.F. Science. 1999; 285: 1569-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). Each TAT fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and the proteins were purified as described previously (41Nagahara H. Vocero-Akbani A.M. Snyder E.L. Ho A. Latham D.G. Lissy N.A. Becker-Hapak M. Ezhevsky S.A. Dowdy S.F. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1449-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). Cell lines were transduced by adding the appropriate TAT-protein to the medium at a final concentration of 100–500 nm as stated in the text. Experiments with TAT-β-galactosidase showed that almost all BAF3 and BaF3-p210 cells in the culture were transduced. The transduced cells were detected by staining with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3pindoyl β-d-galactoside (X-gal) (Sigma) (data not shown). Cell cycle analysis was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) following staining with propidium iodide as described before (43Lam E.W.-F. Watson R.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and permeabilized in 90% ethanol, 10% phosphate-buffered saline prior to DNA staining. The permeabilized cells were incubated with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1 mg/ml RNase A (Sigma), 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 50 μg/ml trisodium citrate for 30 min prior to analysis using a Becton Dickinson FACSort analyzer. The cell cycle profile was analyzed using the Cell Quest software. Assessment of apoptotic cells was carried out by annexin V staining as recommended by the manufacturer (R & D Systems Europe Ltd., Oxon, United Kingdom). Briefly, centrifuged cells were resuspended in binding buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1.5 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, and 18 mm CaCl2) and incubated with 0.5 μg/ml fluorescein-conjugated annexin V and 20 μg/ml propidium iodide for 30 min at room temperature prior to FACS analysis. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, UK) and quantified by absorbance at 260 nm. Twenty μg of RNA, prepared as above, was resolved on 1.5% formaldehyde-agarose gels. Following electrophoresis, RNA were transferred to Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and subjected to Northern blotting as previously described (43Lam E.W.-F. Watson R.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Cyclin D2 (39Matsushime H. Roussel M.F. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J.

Western blot extracts were prepared by lysing cells with 4 times packed cell volume of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mmNaF, 5 mm sodium orthovanadate) on ice for 20 min. Protein yield was quantified by Bio-Rad Dc protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Fifty μg of lysate was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and specific proteins were recognized by the following antibodies. The antibodies against pRB (C-15), p107 (C-18), p130 (C-20), cyclin D2 (M-20), cyclin D3 (18B6–10), cyclin E (M-20), cyclin A (C-19), CDK2 (M2), CDK4 (C-22), CDK6 (C-21), CDC2 (17Konopka J.B.

The anti-phospho pRB(Ser807/811) antibody were purchased from New England Biolabs and the anti-phospho-pRB (Thr821) antibody was acquired from BIOSOURCE, International. The anti-ABL monoclonal antibody 8E9 was purchased from PharMingen. The antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Dako), or mouse absorbed goat anti-rat IgG (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc.) and visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). BCR-ABL has been shown to be able to abrogate the IL-3 requirement in the pre-B hematopoietic cell line BaF3 (45Daley G.Q. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9312-9316Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). In order to investigate the roles of BCR-ABL and IL-3 in cell proliferation and survival, the parental BaF3 cells and BaF3 cells expressing BCR-ABL (i.e. BaF3-p210) were cultured in the absence or presence of IL-3. Propidium iodide staining indicated that in the presence of IL-3 both the BaF3 and BaF3-p210 cells proliferated normally with no detectable sign of cell cycle arrest or apoptosis after 24 h. The results also showed that 24 h after deprivation of IL-3, the BaF3 cells arrested at the G1 phase of the cell cycle (Fig.1 A). Furthermore, detailed analysis of the BaF3 cells after IL-3 withdrawal revealed that following the withdrawal of IL-3, the parental BaF3 cells accumulated at the G1 phase of the cell cycle, before undergoing apoptosis (Fig. 1 B). By 24 h, over 80% of the cells were arrested in G1, and nearly all of the cells displayed detectable sign of apoptosis (<2N DNA content) after 72 h of IL-3 depletion (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, none of the BaF3-p210 cells underwent cell cycle arrest or apoptosis following the withdrawal of IL-3, thus confirming that expression of BCR-ABL could indeed protect BaF3 cells from the G1 cell cycle arrest and subsequent apoptosis induced by IL-3-depletion (Fig.1 A). To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the responses to IL-3 and BCR-ABL, we examined the expression levels of molecules along the pRB pathway in both BaF3 and BaF3-p210 in the presence and absence of IL-3 for 24 h. Western blot analysis showed that in IL-3-deprived BaF3 cells, the two pocket proteins, pRB and p107, were present in their respective faster migrating hypophosphorylated forms (Fig.2). In the presence of IL-3 and/or BCR-ABL, both pRB and p107 were present at comparatively higher levels and in their hyperphosphorylated forms, whereas the expression of p130 was down-regulated. We next studied the expression patterns of cyclins, CDKs, and CKIs, which are known to be responsible for controlling pocket protein phosphorylation (26Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5159) Google Scholar, 27Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar). The expression of cyclin D2, D3, E, and A was either undetectable or present at low levels in IL-3-deprived BaF3 cells, while these cyclins were present at significantly higher levels in the presence of IL-3 and/or BCR-ABL (Fig. 2). In contrast to the cyclins, their kinase partners, CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6 were expressed at similar levels in BaF3 and BaF3-p210 cells in the presence or absence of IL-3. We next investigated if the up-regulation of cyclin D and E expression was associated with a corresponding increase in their dependent kinase activity, which is responsible for pocket protein phosphorylation. Since pRB is the key physiological substrate for cyclin/CDKs, and specific sites are phosphorylated in vivo by distinct G1/S cyclin-CDKs (26Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5159) Google Scholar, 27Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar), we therefore used specific phospho-pRB antibodies to probe for in vivo cyclin D- and E-associated kinase activity in these cells. The Western blot result showed that up-regulation of cyclin D and E expression in response to IL-3 and/or BCR-ABL was associated with induction of cyclin D- and E-dependent kinase activity (Fig. 2). CDK activity is also regulated by inhibitor proteins and the CKI p27Kip1accumulated in IL-3-starved BaF3 cells, but was substantially down-regulated in the presence of IL-3 and by BCR-ABL expression. Interestingly, p21Cip1 was undetectable in IL-3-starved BaF3 cells, but was abundantly expressed in cells with IL-3 and/or BCR-ABL. A similar expression pattern was observed for p16INK4a (Fig. 2). Thus, it is likely that p27Kip1, but not p21Cip1 or p16INK4a, has a role in repressing CDK activity in the BaF3 cells when deprived of growth and survival signals. These results led us to hypothesize that the IL-3 or BCR-ABL-derived signals up-regulate cyclin D2 and D3 expression and down-regulates the expression level of p27Kip1, culminating in induction of cyclin-dependent kinase activity, pocket protein hyperphosphorylation, activation of E2F activity, and continued cell proliferation. To explore the mechanisms for regulating cyclin D2 and D3 and p27Kip1 expression, we performed Northern blot analysis on these BaF3 cells in the presence or absence of IL-3 (Fig. 2). Cyclin D2 mRNA was up-regulated while the p27Kip1 mRNA was down-regulated in the presence of IL-3 and/or BCR-ABL, suggesting that their regulation may be in part at the transcriptional level. In contrast, the level of cyclin D3 mRNA was largely unchanged with or without IL-3, but was down-regulated in the BAF3 cells expressing BCR-ABL. We next studied the kinetics of expression of these cell cycle proteins following IL-3 withdrawal. Down-regulation of both cyclin D2 and cyclin D3, up-regulation of p27Kip1, hypophosphorylation of pocket proteins, and down-regulation of CDK2 and CDK4/6 activity (Fig.3) all occurred between 12 and 24 h, concomitant with G1 cell cycle arrest (Fig. 1 B). Thus, down-regulation of D-type cyclins and up-regulation of p27Kip1 could have a role in mediating the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis triggered by IL-3 withdrawal. To confirm that BCR-ABL is sufficient to account for the molecular changes observed in BaF3-p210, we examined the cell cycle status and expression of cell cycle regulatory molecules in a BaF3 cell line (TonB210.1) where the expression of BCR-ABL is under the regulation of a doxycycline-inducible promoter (40Klucher K.M. Lopez D.V. Daley G.Q. Blood. 1998; 91: 3927-3934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The TonB210.1 cells were first starved of IL-3 for 24 h, before doxycycline was added to induce BCR-ABL expression. After IL-3 starvation, the majority of the TonB210.1 cells accumulated in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, but these IL-3-starved cells re-entered the cell cycle 24 h after adding doxycycline (Fig. 4 A), coincident with the induction of BCR-ABL protein (Fig. 4 B). Cyclin D2, D3, and E were detectable at low levels in IL-3-depleted TonB210.1 cells, but were induced at 24 h following doxycycline addition, while the expression levels of their dependent-kinases, CDK4, -6, and -2, remained largely unchanged (Fig. 4 B). Again, the expression of p27Kip1 was inversely correlated with that of BCR-ABL and p21Cip1. In agreement with the results from the Western blotting, the Northern blot analysis revealed that the level of p27Kip1 mRNA decreased, while the cyclin D2 mRNA level increased, in response to BCR-ABL induction. Consistent with our previous data, the level of cyclin D3 mRNA was decreased upon BCL-ABL induction (Fig. 4 B). STI571, a 2-phenylaminopyrimidine derivative, selectively inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of c-ABL and BCR-ABL (46Druker B.J. Tamura S. Buchdunger E. Ohno S. Segal G.M. Fanning S. Zimmermann J.

We used this drug to investigate whether the activity of BCR-ABL is necessary to rescue the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis caused by IL-3 deprivation. Whereas BaF3-p210 cells continued to proliferate with or without IL-3, IL-3-starved BaF3-p210 cells arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle in the presence of STI571 (Fig. 5 A). Consistent with previous findings, the Western blot results showed that STI571 down-regulated the expression of cyclin D2 and D3 and p21Cip1, but induced the expression of p27Kip1, in the absence of IL-3 (Fig.6 A).

However, the mechanisms underlying this release are not well understood.

Chem. 2000; 27: 20268-20273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the mechanism of MS ATP release remains unknown. Our interest in MS ATP release was stimulated by the discovery of Nakamura and Strittmatter (1Nakamura F. Strittmatter S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10465-10470Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) that mechanical stimulation of theXenopus oocyte evokes ATP release without causing an increase in membrane conductance. Here, we test the hypothesis that ATP release from the oocyte is mediated by the high rate (4,000–16,000/s) of membrane fusion of vesicles involved in transporting proteins from the Golgi complex to the cell surface (17Zampighi G.A. Loo D.D.F. Kreman M. Eskandari S. Wright E.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 507-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This idea seemed plausible given the identification of a specific ATP transporter that concentrates ATP in the Golgi/ER lumen 50–100-fold above that in the cytoplasm (18Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. Abeijon C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 49-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 19Puglielli L. Mandon E.C. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12665-12669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis we have examined the effects of BFA and other treatments that are known to disrupt membrane trafficking and thereby block protein secretion (20Misumi Y. Misumi Y. Miki K. Takatsuki A. Tamura G. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11398-11403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D.

Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar). A key issue for any MS process is the pathway by which mechanical forces are transmitted to that process. For example, specific membrane channel proteins in bacteria and animal cells respond directly to tension developed in the lipid bilayer (23Hamill O.P. Martinac B. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 686-740Crossref Scopus (906) Google Scholar), while other MS processes may be activated by forces transmitted via elements of the ECM and/or CSK (i.e. tethers), possibly interconnected by integrins (24Ingber D.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). In the case of the MG cation channel endogenous to theXenopus oocyte, a bilayer model is favored, because the channel retains its mechanosensitivity in CSK-deficient plasma membrane vesicles (25Zhang Y. Gao F. Popov V.L. Wen J.W. Hamill O.P. J. Physiol. 2000; 523.1: 117-129Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, because of the oocyte's large excess membrane area (i.e. >500%) in the form of membrane folds and microvilli, even large oocyte deformations (e.g. caused by inflation, aspiration, or fluid jet stimulation) fail to increase membrane conductance (26Zhang Y. Hamill O.P. J. Physiol. 2000; 523.1: 101-115Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In contrast, the mildest deformation of the oocyte will activate ATP release (1Nakamura F. Strittmatter S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10465-10470Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 27Maroto R. Hamill O.P. J. Physiol. (Proceedings). 2000; 527P: 45PGoogle Scholar). This difference may arise because MS ATP release involves a tethered mechanism, perhaps analogous to the integrin-dependent, stretch-sensitive transmitter release at the frog neuromuscular junction (28Chen B.-M. Grinnell A.D. J. Neurosci. 1996; 17: 904-916Crossref Google Scholar). To test this possibility, we have examined the effects of integrin-binding peptides, as well as specific agents that disrupt ECM and CSK elements. The preparation of oocytes from Xenopus frogs was as described previously (29Hamill O.P. McBride D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7462-7466Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). After surgical removal, the oocytes were incubated in Barth's solution, typically containing 1 mg/ml collagenase Type II (Sigma) for 5 h on a rocker platform at room temperature. In some cases, oocytes were not treated with collagenase or were treated for longer duration (i.e. ∼15 h). Defolliculated oocytes were allowed to recover in Barth's solution for ∼36 h at 17 °C. Experiments were performed on stage VI oocytes usually 2–4 days after isolation. ATP released from individual oocytes was monitored using the luciferin-luciferase bioluminescence assay in a luminometer (2010 Monolight, PharMingen). The ATP monitoring concept (30Lundin A. Rikardsson A. Thore A. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 75: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) assumes that during the measurement the luciferase activity remains constant and degrades only a tiny fraction of the total ATP present (i.e.<1% min−1). Because the ATP is consumed by the luciferase enzyme on a millisecond time scale, any change in ATP is registered immediately. In our experiments, the luminometer cuvette typically contained 140 μl of ND-96 buffer (in mm: 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2, 5 NaHepes, pH 7.8) and 10 μl of the Sigma ATP assay reagent (1 mg/ml luciferin-luciferase mix). The assay was calibrated by plotting the log of luminescence intensity (relative luminescence units) against the log of ATP concentration (moles/liter) using the Sigma ATP calibration standards. For both calibration and oocyte experiments, we measured the ATP-induced light over a 15 s sampling periods. The background light was measured and subtracted by running a blank. The ATP-induced light was converted to moles of ATP according to the calibration plot prepared each day. All treatments directly tested on ATP release were first screened for effects on assay sensitivity. The measured ATP from an oocyte should reflect the balance between the rates of ATP release and hydrolysis. However, the ecto-ATPase activity of the oocyte is associated with the follicular cells and can be inhibited by collagenase treatment (31Ziganshina A.U. Ziganshina L.E. King B.F. Burnstock G. Pflügers Arch. 1995; 429: 412-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Under these conditions any basal ATP release should result in ATP accumulation and a time-dependent increase in bioluminescence. To measure basal ATP release we gently aspirated an individual oocyte into the tip (∼2 mm diameter) of a Pasteur pipette and transferred it to the luminometer cuvette. Measurements were then made every minute for at least 15 min. To evoke MS ATP release the oocyte was stimulated in the cuvette using a Gilson micropipettor with a P200 pipette tip to repetitively “puff” 120 μl of the buffer at the oocyte. Special care was taken not to directly touch or aspirate the oocyte into the tip. For each mechanical stimulation three buffer puffs were applied over approximately a 3-s duration. The rate of MS ATP release was estimated by dividing the increment in ATP level (measured immediately after stimulation) by the duration of the mechanical stimulation. To estimate the cytoplasmic ATP concentration, the oocyte was ruptured by repetitive aspiration into the tip of the puffer pipette. The chemicals ATP, BAPTA.AM, A23187, BFA, cytochalasin D, progesterone, and nocodazole were from Sigma; gadolinium (III) chloride hexahydrate was from Aldrich; apyrase (200 units, 140 units/mg) was from Fluka; and the peptides: GRGESP RGD (Gly-Arg-Gly-Glu-Ser-Pro, inactive), GRGDSP RGD (Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro, anti-fibronectin-anti-vitronectin), GRGDdSP (Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-d-Ser-Pro, selective anti-fibronectin), and GPenGRGDSPCA RGD (Gly-Pen-Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro-Cys-Ala(cyclical), where Pen indicates penicillamine), selective anti-vitronectin) were from Life Technologies, Inc. The concentration and incubation time for the different drugs used were as follows: 5 μg/ml BFA for 2.5 h, 0.2 mm integrin-binding peptides for 1.5 h, 0.25 μm cytochalasin D for 2 h, 10 μmBAPTA.AM or 10 μm GdCl3 for 45 min. To facilitate the effect of nocodazole (see Ref. 32Verrey F. Groscurth P. Bolliger U. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 145: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), oocytes were previously exposed to cold treatment (i.e. 1 h in ND-96 on ice in the cold room) and then incubated in 20 μmnocodazole for 1 h at 17 °C. Control experiments indicated that cold treatment alone did not block either basal or MS ATP release.A23187 was added to the cuvette to give a final concentration of 10 μm. Apyrase was also directly added to the cuvette (4 units in 2 μl, from a stock 140 units/mg). Stage VI oocytes were matured in vitro by incubation in ND-96 plus 10 μm progesterone for ∼12 h. Maturation was judged by the appearance of a white spot on the animal pole (33Zhang Y. McBride D.W. Hamill O.P. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1998; 508: 763-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In zero-calcium experiments, ND-96 minus CaCl2 was prepared in plastic beakers and used in the buffer/assay mixture. Oocytes were gently washed several times in the same medium before testing. Fig. 1 A shows ATP calibration curves measured in control (ND-96), 100 μmGd3+, and hypotonic (ND-33) solutions. 100 μmGd3+ reduced assay sensitivity, whereas ND-33 increased it. Fig. 1 B illustrates an experiment simulating ATP release. In the standard buffer/assay solution the background luminescence was ∼100 relative luminescence units (i.e. same as the blank) and equivalent to 2 fmol of added ATP. Repetitive applications of 15-fmol aliquots of ATP produced a staircase increase in luminescence, and addition of apyrase abolished the response. Fig. 2 A indicates that the initial transfer of the oocyte to the cuvette (i.e. at time 0) increased the base-line equivalent to adding ∼20 fmol of ATP, which was followed by a steady increase of ∼10 amol/s (8.6 ± 0.05 × 10−18 mol/s). In comparison, addition of non-collagenase-treated oocytes did not increase the luminescence above background, while addition of oocytes treated overnight (i.e. 15 versus 5 h) with collagenase showed a relatively larger increase in basal ATP release (Table I). These results confirm a previous study (31Ziganshina A.U. Ziganshina L.E. King B.F. Burnstock G. Pflügers Arch. 1995; 429: 412-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) that indicated follicle-enclosed oocytes express significant ecto-ATPase activity, and this activity is inhibited by collagenase. We believe the initial increase in ATP level at zero time may be due in part to inadvertent mechanical stimulation of the oocyte during the transfer because it is reduced along with MS ATP release (see Fig. 3).Table IThe effects of various conditions on basal and MS ATP release from Xenopus oocytes (see “Experimental Procedures” for details)ConditionBasal release% of control(n)MS release% of control(n)Reversibility of blockControl8.6 ± 0.05100(11)43,540 ± 3,569100(12)10 μmGd3+9.3 ± 0.08108(6)40,603 ± 3,32793(6)Brefeldin A0.3 ± 0.014(12)136 ± 16<1(25)YesProgesterone maturation0.8 ± 0.019(10)291 ± 15<1(10)NoNocodazole0.6 ± 0.017(10)1,062 ± 2392(18)YesIntegrin-peptide (GRGDdSP)0.4 ± 0.015(11)503 ± 381(8)YesIntegrin-peptide (GPenGRGDSPCA)7.9 ± 0.0992(3)39,821 ± 2,75691(6)Cytochalasin D0.3 ± 0.014(12)344 ± 29<1(19)YesCollagenase overnight11.1 ± 0.06129(8)582 ± 441(8)NoNon-collagenase treated0.1 ± 0.011(7)9,058 ± 57421(6)A2318710.2 ± 0.1119(8)435,036 ± 254999(22)Results are expressed as 10−18 mol/s and as percentage of control.

Number of oocytes tested for each condition and the reversibility of the block are also shown. Fig. 2 B shows MS ATP release from individual oocytes pretreated with collagenase. The first mechanical stimulation increased the ATP level from 25.14 ± 3.1 to 250 ± 30 fmol of ATP. Because the stimulus was applied over approximately a 3-s duration (see “Experimental Procedures”), the rate of MS ATP release was estimated to be ∼70 fmol/s. Subsequent stimuli produced smaller increments in ATP release (i.e. ∼50 fmol), possibly reflecting a reduction in the MS releasable pool and/or assay sensitivity (c.f. Fig. 1 B). Note this apparent saturating response to gentle mechanical stimulation was ∼4 orders of magnitude less than the ATP released by mechanical damage of the oocyte (see below). Mechanical rupture of the oocyte increased the luminescence equivalent to 300,000 fmol of ATP, which decayed rapidly in the first minute, presumably due to ATP hydrolysis by released/activated ATPase. Addition of apyrase further reduced the ATP-generated luminescence. Several mechanisms may contribute to ATP release, and different mechanisms may underlie basal and MS release. For example, the oocyte expresses hemi-gap and Gd3+-sensitive MG channels, both of which have been implicated in ATP release from epithelial cells (12Cotrina M.L. Lin J.H-C. Alves-Rodrigues A. Liu S. Li J. Azmi-Ghadimi H. Kang J. Naus C.C.G. Nedergaard M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15735-15740Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar,15Roman R.M. Feranchak A.P. Davidson A.K. Schwiebert E.M. Fitz J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G1222-G1230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, mechanical stimuli much stronger than that required to cause ATP release, fails to activate a membrane conductance increase (1Nakamura F. Strittmatter S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10465-10470Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 26Zhang Y. Hamill O.P. J. Physiol. 2000; 523.1: 101-115Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 27Maroto R. Hamill O.P. J. Physiol. (Proceedings). 2000; 527P: 45PGoogle Scholar). Furthermore, 10 μm Gd3+, which completely blocks hemi-gap and MG channel activity (33Zhang Y. McBride D.W. Hamill O.P. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1998; 508: 763-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 34Zhang Y. Hamill O.P. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 2000; 523.1: 83-99Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar), does not affect ATP release (Table I). 100 μm Gd3+caused an apparent, partial inhibition of ATP release (data not presented), but this may be due to the higher Gd3+ reducing assay sensitivity (see Fig. 1 A). It has recently been proposed that strong hyperpolarization of the oocyte (i.e.to −200 mV) may activate an ATP-selective conductance (16Bodas E. Aleu J. Pujol G. Martin-Satue M. Marsal J. Solsona C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 27: 20268-20273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, our studies indicate similar hyperpolarizations activate a nonselective conductance that fails to saturate with prolonged hyperpolarization and recovers only slowly (i.e. >10 min) following repolarization (34Zhang Y. Hamill O.P. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 2000; 523.1: 83-99Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These properties are consistent with reversible membrane dielectric breakdown. Whatever the underlying mechanism, this voltage-activated conductance does not mediate the non-electrogenic MS ATP release measured at resting potentials (1Nakamura F. Strittmatter S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10465-10470Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Non-electrogenic ATP release could be mediated by exocytosis, a specific ATP transporter or both. To test the hypothesis that ATP release is associated with fusion of protein carrier vesicles with the plasma membrane, we examined the effects of different agents that disrupt the Golgi complex and thereby block membrane/protein trafficking. BFA reversibly blocks anterograde vesicular transport through a redistribution of the Golgi complex into the ER (22Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar) and thereby inhibits protein secretion from animal cells, including theXenopus oocyte (35Mulner-Lorillon O. Belle P. Drewing C.S. Minella O. Poulhe R. Schmalzing G. Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 36Geering K. Beggah A. Good P. Girardet S. Roy S. Schaer D. Jaunin P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We found that BFA treatment also blocks basal and MS release (Table I, Fig. 3 B), and the block is reversed 3 h after removal of BFA (data not presented). Progesterone maturation of the oocyte is associated with the disappearance of the Golgi apparatus and block of protein secretion (37Coleman A. Jones E.A. Heasman J. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We found that basal and MS ATP release is also absent in matured oocytes (Fig. 3 C, Table I). The microtubule network is critical in maintaining the integrity and function of the Golgi complex (38Thyberg J. Moskalewski S. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 263-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), and its depolymerization by nocodazole disrupts the Golgi complex and vesicle trafficking (39Terasaki M. Chen L.B. Fujiwara K. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1557-15680Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). We found that nocodazole also blocks basal and MS ATP release (Table I, Fig. 3 E), and this block was reversed within 3 h after nocodazole exposure (data not presented). The above treatments did not alter the normal oocyte resting membrane potential (∼−30 mV) nor the amount of ATP released upon oocyte rupture (i.e. ∼3 nm) (data not presented). To determine the pathway by which mechanical forces are transmitted to the ATP release process, we tested specific agents that interfere with ECM, membrane, and CSK elements. Evidence for ECM involvement was indicated by prolonged exposure of oocytes to collagenase (i.e. 15 versus 5 h), which blocked MS ATP release by 99% (Table I). In contrast, basal ATP release appeared enhanced (i.e. 129%, see Table I), probably because prolonged collagenase exposure produces a more complete inhibition of ecto-ATPase activity. To determine whether ECM-integrin interactions are important in ATP release, we tested specific RGD-containing peptides that disrupt integrin binding to ECM proteins (24Ingber D.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar, 28Chen B.-M. Grinnell A.D. J. Neurosci. 1996; 17: 904-916Crossref Google Scholar). We found that the peptide (GRGDdSP), which inhibits integrin binding to fibronectin, but not to vitronectin, significantly reduced basal and MS ATP release (Fig. 3 D, Table I). The nonspecific anti-fibronectin-anti-vitronectin peptide (GRGDSP) produced a similar effect (data not presented). However, neither the specific anti-vitronectin peptide (GPenGRGDSPCA) (Table I) nor an inactive control peptide (GRGESP) inhibited ATP release (data not presented). Because integrins mechanically link the ECM to the actin CSK (24Ingber D.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar), we tested the effect of disruption of actin microfilaments. We found that treatment of oocytes with cytochalasin D blocked both basal and MS release (Fig. 3 F, Table I). The selective block of MS ATP release by collagenase indicates that basal ATP release can proceed even when ECM elements critical for mechanosensitivity are disrupted. However, intact integrin and microfilament interactions are apparently required for basal ATP release. These interactions may be involved in transmitting background mechanical forces (i.e. arising from gravity and/or CSK tension) that modulate the release mechanism. We found that external Ca2+ was not required for basal or MS ATP release (Figs. 4, A andB). Furthermore, 10 μmA23187 did not stimulate ATP release. However, A23187 treatment consistently potentiated (∼10-fold) MS ATP release (Fig. 4 C, Table I). The A23187 potentiation was blocked when measured in zero-Ca2+ external solution (data not shown) and by preincubation of the oocyte in 10 μm BAPTA-AM (Fig.4 D). We also tested A23187 on progesterone matured oocytes, which causes massive cortical granule-membrane fusion, in addition to activating the Ca2+-sensitive Cl− conductance (e.g. see Fig. 8 in Ref. 26Zhang Y. Hamill O.P. J. Physiol. 2000; 523.1: 101-115Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, as with immature oocytes A23187 did not increase ATP release (data not presented), indicating that cortical granules do not contain ATP and Ca2+-activated Cl− channels do not mediate ATP efflux (see also Fig. 4 C). The Xenopus oocyte belongs to a growing list of animal cells that exhibit MS ATP (or UTP) release (1Nakamura F. Strittmatter S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10465-10470Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 2Schlosser S.F. Burgtahler A.D. Nathanson M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Anat. 1999; 194: 335-342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we provide new details on a novel mechanism that may explain why basal and MS ATP release is a general feature of animal cells. In summary, MS ATP release can occur without membrane damage based on its reversible block by specific agents (e.g. BFA, nocodazole, and integrin-binding peptides) and irreversible block by progesterone-induced maturation. It is also not mediated by the endogenous MG, hemi-gap, or Ca2+-activated Cl−channels. Instead, we propose that (i) ATP release is dependent upon BFA-sensitive trafficking of ATP-enriched vesicles that transport protein from the Golgi to the cell surface, (ii) the vesicle trafficking and/or membrane fusion is facilitated by mechanical forces transmitted from the ECM to the CSK possibly via membrane integrins, (iii) increase in [Ca2+]i acts cooperatively with mechanical forces to promote ATP release, and (iv) progesterone maturation of the oocyte blocks ATP release, implying that ATP release may play some role in the normal maintenance of the follicle and/or immature oocyte. The Xenopus oocyte releases ATP at a basal rate of around 0.01 fmol/s, and gentle mechanical stimuli can transiently increase this 5,000-fold to 50 fmol/s. In comparison, mechanical rupture of the oocyte results in the release of 300,000 fmol of ATP. This indicates a cytoplasmic ATP concentration of around 1 mm(i.e. for an oocyte volume ∼0.5 μl). However, this is likely an underestimate of the actual concentration given the rapid degradation of released ATP by activated ATPase activity (Fig.2 B). Furthermore, this estimate does not include ATP compartmentalized within mitochondria and the ER/Golgi cisternae. Clearly, the basal and MS-released ATP represents a tiny fraction of the total oocyte ATP. According to our primary hypothesis, both basal and MS ATP release arise from fusion/exocytosis of vesicles involved in transporting proteins from the Golgi complex to the cell surface. This hypothesis is supported by the block of ATP release by BFA, nocodazole, and progesterone-induced maturation of the oocyte. All three treatments cause disappearance of the Golgi complex and thereby block protein transport/secretion from the Xenopus oocyte (20Misumi Y. Misumi Y. Miki K. Takatsuki A. Tamura G. Ikehara Y. J.

According to Zampighi et al. (17Zampighi G.A. Loo D.D.F. Kreman M. Eskandari S. Wright E.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 507-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), the vesicles that transport proteins to the cell surface fuse with the cell membrane at a rate of at least 4,000 s−1. To account for basal ATP release, each vesicle would need to release 2.5 × 10−21 mol of ATP (i.e. 1,500 ATP molecules), consistent with a vesicular ATP concentration of ∼5 mm at the time of exocytosis (i.e. for a vesicle diameter/volume of 0.1 μm/5.2 × 10−19liters, see Ref. 17Zampighi G.A. Loo D.D.F. Kreman M. Eskandari S. Wright E.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 507-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This concentration is only ∼5 times higher than the estimated cytoplasmic concentration and is reasonable given the identification of a specific ATP transporter that can concentrate ATP in the Golgi/ER lumen 50–100 times above that in external medium (18Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. Abeijon C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 49-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 19Puglielli L. Mandon E.C. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12665-12669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Presumably, the ATP released reflects the residual ATP left in the vesicle after ATP-dependent processing of cargo proteins is complete (18Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. Abeijon C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 49-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Although we currently favor ATP release by exocytosis, our luminescence measurements cannot exclude the possibility that block of membrane trafficking does not also inhibit membrane insertion of electroneutral ATP transporters. However, even if some resident Golgi ATP transporters reach the cell membrane (i.e. despite Golgi retention mechanisms, see Ref.40Pfeffer S.R. Rothman J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 835-851Crossref Scopus (618) Google Scholar), in order for them to mediate ATP efflux they would require obligatory ADP/AMP influx (18Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. Abeijon C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 49-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 41Samartsev V.N. Mokhova E.N. Skulachev V.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In this case, conditions that reduced local external ADP/AMP (e.g. block of ecto-ATPase activity or buffer puffs directed at the surface) would be expected to reduce rather than increase ATP efflux (c.f. Table I). Furthermore, because BFA block of ATP release is >95% complete within 2.5 h, it would imply the hypothesized membrane-inserted ATP transporters have a membrane half-life of less than 1 h. In comparison, the measured half-life of membrane proteins expressed in oocytes ranges between 4 and 36 h (17Zampighi G.A. Loo D.D.F. Kreman M. Eskandari S. Wright E.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 507-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 42Fisher R.S. Grillo F.G. Sariban-Sohraby S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C138-C147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Shimkets R.A. Lifton R.P. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25537-25541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). It is possible that the ATP released from the oocyte plays no additional functional role but merely represents the unavoidable consequence/cost of requiring ATP in the Golgi/ER lumen as a substrate and energy source for processing secretory and membrane-bound proteins (18Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. Abeijon C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 49-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 44Quemeneur E. Guthapfel R. Gueguen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5485-5488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Braakman I. Helenius J. Helenius A. Nature. 1992; 356: 260-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The absence of endogenous ATP receptors on the oocyte (e.g. see Ref. 1Nakamura F. Strittmatter S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10465-10470Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) would seem to rule out any autocrine signaling role. However, it is possible that released ATP activates endogenous ATP receptors on follicular cells (e.g. see Ref.46Perez-Samartin A.L. Miledi R. Arellano R.O. J. Physiol. 2000; 525.3: 721-734Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and thereby participates in a regulatory cell-cell loop involving the electrically coupled oocyte and follicular cells (47Mayerhofer A. Smith G.D. Danilchik M. Leveine J.E. Wolf D.P. Dissen G.A. Ojeda S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10990-10995Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In this case, changes in external “mechanical tone” exerted on the oocyte by the surrounding follicular cell layer may regulate MS ATP release. It has been shown that direct oocyte inflation or oocyte aspiration can induce ATP release as monitored by purinergic receptors heterologously expressed in the oocyte (1Nakamura F. Strittmatter S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10465-10470Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). However, our preliminary results indicate that osmotic swelling of the oocyte (i.e. in ND-33) does not significantly increase ATP release. 2R. Maroto and O. P. Hamill, unpublished observations. The demonstration that the BFA-sensitive process that mediates constitutive protein secretion and membrane protein insertion is mechanosensitive has implications beyond the oocyte. For example, this process may serve as a general intrinsic mechanism for regulating animal cell growth and proliferation in response to mechanical loading. At least consistent with this idea is the demonstration that stretch-induced hypertrophy of isolated cardiac myocytes is mediated by increased release of angiotensin II (48Sadoshima J. Xu Y. Slayter H.S. Izumo S. Cell. 1993; 75: 977-984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar) and that mechanical strain-induced proliferation of fetal lung cells is associated with increased constitutive release of glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans (49Xu J. Liu M. Liu J. Caniggia I. Post M. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1605-1613PubMed Google Scholar). It is also interesting that MS ATP release from the oocyte shares some similarities with stretch-induced enhancement of transmitter release at the frog NMJ (28Chen B.-M. Grinnell A.D. J. Neurosci. 1996; 17: 904-916Crossref Google Scholar). For example, both MS processes are blocked by integrin-binding peptides, and both can occur when elevation of [Ca2+]i is prevented (Ref. 28Chen B.-M. Grinnell A.D. J. Neurosci. 1996; 17: 904-916Crossref Google Scholar and Fig.4 D). However, whereas elevation of [Ca2+]i alone can evoke synaptic transmitter release, it only serves to facilitate MS ATP release. This facilitation may be related to the demonstrated Ca2+ dependence of vesicle fusion during intra-Golgi transport (50Schwaninger R. Beckers C.J.M. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13055-13063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, our results provide possible clues to the mechanism underlying CFTR-dependent ATP release from specific cell types (see Ref. 51Schwiebert E.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1-C8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, cAMP activation of CFTR has been shown to be associated with a sustained increase in ATP release (33 fmol/s) from CFTR-transfected oocytes (13Jiang Q. Mak D. Devidas S. Schwiebert E.M. Bragin A. Zhang Y. Skach W.R. Guggino W.B. Foskett J.K. Engelhardt J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 647-657Google Scholar) but not from CFTR-expressing Calu-3 cells (4Grygorczyk R. Hanrahan J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1058-C1066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, in CFTR-transfected Xenopus oocytes (as well as in human epithelial cells) it has been demonstrated that cAMP activation of CFTR occurs mainly by increased membrane insertion of new CFTR channels (52Takahashi A. Watkins S.C. Howard M. Frizzell R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1887-C1894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 53Peters K. Qi J. Watkins S.C. Frizzell R.A. Am. J.

Physiol. 1994; 267: C272-C281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in other cell types, including Calu-3 cells, cAMP directly activates already inserted CFTR channels (55Dho S. Grinstein S. Foskett J.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1225: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 56Loffing J. Moyer B.D. McCoy D. Stanton B. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C913-C920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, BFA and nocodazole block CFTR activation in the former cell type (53Peters K. Qi J. Watkins S.C. Frizzell R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C174-C180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but not the latter (56Loffing J. Moyer B.D. McCoy D. Stanton B. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C913-C920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A plausible explanation for these cell type-specific effects is that CFTR confers cAMP sensitivity on membrane trafficking and thereby ATP release. In conclusion, our study reveals a novel mechanism of mechanotransduction that involves ATP release via BFA-sensitive vesicle trafficking between the Golgi complex and the cell surface. Since this mechanism is common to most animal cells, it would explain why constitutive ATP release is widespread in animal cells (57Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31061-31068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The idea that the process that determines constitutive protein secretion and membrane protein insertion is MS has implications for MS regulation of cell growth and development. This process may also account for why overexpression or activation of specific membrane proteins (e.g. CFTR) in some cells has been associated with increased ATP release.

https://openalex.org/W1971039813,"The mechanism by which transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) induces apoptosis of prostate epithelial cells was studied in the NRP-154 rat prostate epithelial cell line. TGF-β1 down-regulates expression of Bcl-xL and poly(ADP-ribosyl)polymerase (PARP), promotes cytochrome <i>c</i>release, up-regulates expression of latent caspase-3, and activates caspases 3 and 9. We tested the role of Bcl-xL in this cascade by stably overexpressing Bcl-xL to prevent loss by TGF-β1. Clones overexpressing Bcl-xL are resistant to TGF-β1 with respect to induction of apoptosis, cytochrome <i>c</i> release, activation of caspases 9 and 3, and cleavage of PARP; yet they remain sensitive to TGF-β1 by cell cycle arrest, induction of both fibronectin and latent caspase-3 expression, and loss of PARP expression. We show that Bcl-xL associates with Apaf-1 in NRP-154 cells; but this association does not inhibit the activation of caspases 9 and 3 by cytochrome <i>c</i>. Together, our data suggest that TGF-β1 induces apoptosis through loss of Bcl-xL, leading to cytochrome <i>c</i> release and the subsequent activation of caspases 9 and 3. Moreover, our data demonstrate that the antiapoptotic effect of Bcl-xL occurs by inhibition of mitochondrial cytochrome <i>c</i> release and not through antagonizing Apaf-1-dependent processing of caspases 9 and 3."
https://openalex.org/W1973479681,"2-5(A) synthetases are a family of interferon-induced enzymes that polymerize ATP into 2′-5′ linked oligoadenylates that activate RNase L and cause mRNA degradation. Because they all can synthesize 2-5(A), the reason for the existence of so many synthetase isozymes is unclear. Here we report that the 9-2 isozyme of 2-5(A) synthetase has an additional activity: it promotes apoptosis in mammalian cells. The proapoptotic activity of 9-2 was isozyme-specific and enzyme activity-independent. The 9-2-expressing cells exhibited many properties of cells undergoing apoptosis, such as DNA fragmentation, caspase activation, and poly ADP-ribose polymerase and lamin B cleavage. The isozyme-specific carboxyl-terminal tail of the 9-2 protein was shown, by molecular modeling, to contain a Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain, suggesting that it may be able to interact with members of the Bcl-2 family that contain BH1 and BH2 domains. Co-immunoprecipitate assays and confocal microscopy showed that 9-2 can indeed interact with the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and BclxLin vivo andin vitro. Mutations in the BH3 domain that eliminated the 9-2-Bcl-2 amd 9-2-BclxL interactions also eliminated the apoptotic activity of 9-2. Thus, we have identified an interferon-induced dual function protein of the Bcl-2 family that can synthesize 2-5(A) and promote cellular apoptosis independently. Moreover, the cellular abundance of this protein is regulated by alternative splicing; the other isozymes encoded by the same gene are not proapoptotic. 2-5(A) synthetases are a family of interferon-induced enzymes that polymerize ATP into 2′-5′ linked oligoadenylates that activate RNase L and cause mRNA degradation.

Although their antiviral effects are the most well known, IFNs affect cell growth and cell survival as well (1Vilcek J. Sen G.C. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 375-399Google Scholar, 2Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3366) Google Scholar). The cellular effects of IFNs are mediated by the IFN-induced proteins, which number in the hundreds (3Der S.D. Zhou A. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15623-15628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar). Among them are the family of enzymes called 2-5(A) synthetases (4Rebouillat D. Hovanessian A.G. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 1917-1924Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 5Kerr I.M. J. Interferon Res. 1987; 7: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Three sets of IFN-induced genes encode three size classes of these proteins. Within each size class, multiple members arise as a result of alternative splicing of the primary transcript, giving rise to proteins with unique sequences at their carboxyl termini (6Benech P. Mory Y. Revel M. Chebath J. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2249-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 7Ghosh S.K. Kusari J. Bandyopadhyay S.K. Samanta H. Kumar R. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15293-15299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the cellular abundance of individual isozymes is regulated not only by IFN-induced transcription of the genes, but also by alternative splicing. The enzymatic activity of 2-5(A) synthetases requires a co-factor, double-stranded (ds)1 RNA. In the presence of dsRNA, these enzymes polymerize ATP into 2′-5′-linked oligoadenylates, which in turn activate a latent ribonuclease, RNase L. Activated RNase L can degrade cellular and viral RNAs and inhibit protein synthesis (8Silverman R.H. Cirino N.M. Morris D.R. Hartford J.B. Gene Regulation. John Wiley & Sons, New York1997: 295-309Google Scholar). We have been studying the structure-function relationships of 2-5(A) synthetases and have identified their conserved catalytic domain, in which three Asp residues form the catalytic triad (9Sarkar S.N. Ghosh A. Wang H.W. Sung S.S. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25535-25542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated that dimerization of the medium isozyme, P69, and tetramerization of the small isozyme, 9-2, is necessary for their enzyme activity (9Sarkar S.N. Ghosh A. Wang H.W. Sung S.S. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25535-25542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 10Ghosh A. Sarkar S.N. Guo W. Bandyopadhyay S. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33220-33226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It remains an enigma, however, why so many isozymes exist. To address this issue, we have begun to examine the cell growth regulatory and antiviral properties of individual isozymes. The E16/3-9 small isozyme, when expressed by transfection, causes an inhibition of replication of specific viruses, such as encephalomyocarditis virus (11Chebath J. Benech P. Revel M. Vigneron M. Nature. 1987; 330: 587-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 12Rysiecki G. Gewert D.R. Williams B.R. J. Interferon Res. 1989; 9: 649-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Similarly, ectopic expression of the medium isozyme in permanently transfected P69 cells causes inhibition of encephalomyocarditis virus replication and cell growth (13Ghosh A. Sarkar S. Sen G. Virology. 2000; 266: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Similar attempts to establish cell lines that permanently express the small isozyme 9-2 were unsuccessful and led to the unexpected findings reported in this paper. The 9-2 protein caused cellular apoptosis by specifically binding to the anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family. A large number of pro- and anti-apoptotic cellular proteins of the Bcl-2 family regulate cellular apoptosis (14Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 395-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar, 15Kelekar A. Thompson C.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 324-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). These proteins contain one or more Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains, which are grouped into four classes: BH1, BH2, BH3, and BH4. The BH3 domain interacts with a pocket formed by the BH1 and BH2 domains, thus enabling many of these proteins to homo-and heterodimerize and function as regulators of apoptosis. Anti-apoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2 and BclxL, and proapoptotic proteins, such as Bax and Bak, contain BH1, BH2, and BH3 domains, whereas other proapoptotic proteins, such as Bad, Bid, and Bik, contain the BH3 domain only. The latter proteins are thought to neutralize the anti-apoptotic proteins by forming inactive heterodimers. Here, we report the identification of a new member of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family that contains only the BH3 domain. Human HT1080 cells were cultured as described before (13Ghosh A. Sarkar S. Sen G. Virology. 2000; 266: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Where indicated, human IFN-β was used for treating these cells. All transfections were done using Fugene 6 reagent from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. A monoclonal antibody recognizing all small isozymes of synthetases has been described before (16Ghosh A.

The 9-2-specific antipeptide antibody was raised in rabbit by Biosynthesis Inc. The 17-mer peptide used as the antigen contained residues 355–371 of the protein (7Ghosh S.K. Kusari J.

Rabbit anti-human Bcl-2 antibody was from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Mouse monoclonal anti-human Bcl-2 antibody, mouse monoclonal anti-human BclxL antibody, and rabbit anti-Flag antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit anti-human Bclx antibody was from Transduction Laboratory and mouse monoclonal anti-Flag antibody was from Sigma. Mouse monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody was from Becton Dickinson. The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, goat anti-mouse, donkey anti-goat, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody were from Life Technologies, whereas Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody was from Molecular Probes. The isozymes 9-2, 3-9, L3, and P69 have been described before (7Ghosh S.K. Kusari J. Bandyopadhyay S.K. Samanta H. Kumar R. Sen G.C. J. Biol.

The enzymatically inactive 9-2 mutant, 9-2M, has two Asp residues in the catalytic domain substituted by Ala (9Sarkar S.N. Ghosh A. Wang H.W. Sung S.S. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25535-25542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The 9-2 TM mutant does not form tetramers and is enzymatically inactive (10Ghosh A. Sarkar S.N. Guo W. Bandyopadhyay S. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33220-33226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The 9-2 DM mutant had residues 345–414 deleted (7Ghosh S.K.

The mutations were built into primers used for polymerase chain reaction cloning by the megaprimer method (10Ghosh A. Sarkar S.N. Guo W. Bandyopadhyay S. Sen G.C. J. Biol.

After 24 h, cells were trypsinized, washed with PBS twice, incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD20 antibody for 30 min at 25 °C, and washed with PBS twice before separation of the stained cells by fluorescent activated cell sorter (Becton Dickinson). TUNEL assays were performed as described (19Ben Sasson S.A. Sherman Y. Gavrieli Y. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 46: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This assay detected apoptotic cells by DNA labeling, the transfected protein by antibody staining, and cellular nuclei by DAPI staining of the nuclei. Apoptosis was quantitated by counting the number of protein-expressing cells that were TUNEL-positive. For this purpose, at least 300 protein-expressing cells were scored by examining several fields in a fluorescence microscope. At a concentration of 108 cells/ml, cells were suspended in the lysis buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin and disrupted by three cycles of freeze-thawing. Supernatants were collected after a low speed centrifugation. Caspase 3 and caspase 1 activities in the extracts were measured by using the CaspACE assay system (Fluoremetric, Promega). Extracts of transiently transfected cells were made in a buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.0, 6 m urea, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.0125% bromphenol blue. 4 × 106 cells were suspended in 1 ml of buffer, sonicated at a pulse of 15 s twice, and incubated at 65 °C for 15 min before analyzing by 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Western blotting was done with a monoclonal anti-PARP antibody. Cells were extracted as for PARP cleavage assay except that the buffer contained 10 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Proteins were analyzed by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and a polyclonal Lamin B antibody. Cells at 72 h posttransfection were scraped out and collected by centrifugation. The cell pellet was incubated with 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K in 500 μl of buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, 5 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, 0.2% SDS) at 37 °C. The DNA was precipitated with an equal volume of isopropanol. The precipitated DNA was treated with 0.1 mg/ml RNase A at 37 °C, analyzed on a 2% agarose gel, and detected by ethidium bromide staining. For assaying release of cytochrome C from mitochondria to cytosol, cells were washed with chilled PBS, scraped off the plate in PBS, and harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellet was washed once with PBS and then suspended in 3 volumes of a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm aprotinin, and 250 mm sucrose (29Pastorino J.G. Chen S.T. Tafani M. Snyder J.W. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7770-7775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). After chilling on ice for 3 min, the cells were disrupted by 25 strokes in a glass homogenizer. The extract was centrifuged twice at 2500 × g to remove unbroken cells and nuclei. Mitochondria were then pelleted from the supernatant by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was removed and filtered successively through 0.2- and 0.1-μm Ultrafree MC filters (Millipore) to produce the cytosolic fraction. Equal amounts of cytosolic protein were electrophoresed by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotted with a monoclonal antibody to cytochrome C (Pharmingen) at a 1:5000 dilution followed by a secondary goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody at a 1:2000 dilution. The secondary antibody was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Amino acid sequences of the BH3 domains of 9-2, BclxL, Bad, and other proapoptotic family members were aligned using the homology module of Insight II (Molecular Simulations, Inc.). The secondary structures were determined using the PHD sec program at predict protein server. Molecular modeling of the 9-2 and the Bad BH3 domains was done using Insight II. For this modeling, the BH3 domain of BclxL was as taken on the template to construct the backbone conformations of the two test BH3 domains. In vitro coupled transcription-translation systems were used for synthesizing radiolabeled Flag-tagged proteins 9-2, its mutants, Bcl-2, and BclxL individually. Equal amounts of the interacting proteins were mixed in the binding buffer containing 10 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. 9-2 proteins were immunoprecipitated by anti-Flag antibody bound to agarose (9Sarkar S.N. Ghosh A. Wang H.W. Sung S.S. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25535-25542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). After washing twice with the binding buffer containing 250 mm NaCl, the bound proteins were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Extracts of transfected or untransfected cells were made by sonication of cells suspended in the binding buffer described above. 100 μg of protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag, polyclonal BclxL, or monoclonal Bcl2 antisera and protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitated proteins or proteins in the cell extracts were analyzed by Western blotting with different antisera. Flag-tagged 9-2 was transfected, and cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100, washed, and incubated in blocking buffer and then with the primary antibodies. As primary antibodies, rabbit anti-Flag antiserum at a 1:250 dilution and mouse monoclonal anti-Bcl-2 antiserum at a 1:500 dilution were used. As secondary antibodies, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit goat antiserum and Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse goat antiserum were used at a 1:2000 dilution. The green and red colors were detected by confocal fluorescent microscopy (13Ghosh A. Sarkar S. Sen G. Virology. 2000; 266: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We originally cloned the 9-2 isozyme of 2-5(A) synthetase from a mouse cDNA library along with another isozyme, 3-9 (7Ghosh S.K. Kusari J. Bandyopadhyay S.K. Samanta H. Kumar R. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15293-15299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence of 3-9 was almost identical to that of E16, a human isozyme, whereas all of 9-2 sequence was contained within that of E18, an alternatively spliced sister of E16. Thus, we proposed that the mRNAs for E16/3-9, E18, and 9-2 arise from the same primary transcript by alternative splicing (Fig. 1A). As a result, all three proteins contain an identical 345 residues at their amino termini and various numbers of unique residues at their carboxyl termini after the alternative splice junction. Because we are interested in determining specific cellular functions of these and other isozymes of 2-5(A) synthetases, we have been expressing them individually in human cell lines. Because we have been using human cells for expression analysis and the E16 and E18 isozymes were originally cloned from human cells, it was important to establish that the 9-2 isozyme is also expressed in human cells. Results presented in Fig. 1 demonstrate the existence of the 9-2 isozyme in IFN-treated human HT1080 cells. To test the existence of the 9-2 mRNA, RNA from IFN-treated cells was used for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using appropriate primers. The sense primer was from the common region just upstream of the splice junction, and the antisense primer was from the region common to the E18 and 9-2 mRNAs placed right at the translation termination point of the putative 9-2 protein (Fig. 1A). As expected, two pieces of DNA were amplified from RNA of IFN-treated cells (data not shown). Their sizes of 405 and 307 base pairs matched exactly the sizes expected of E18 mRNA and 9-2 mRNA, respectively. None of these DNAs were obtained without reverse transcription. The two cDNAs were completely sequenced, confirming the identities of the E18 and 9-2 mRNAs and the encoded proteins (Fig. 1, B and C). This portion of the human 9-2 sequence was identical to that of the mouse 9-2. The E18 sequence had two amino acid differences: a Thr to Ala and a Thr to Arg substitution as compared with the published E18 sequence (6Benech P. Mory Y. Revel M. Chebath J. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2249-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Induction of 9-2 mRNA could be detected as early as 2 h after IFN treatment of cells (data not shown). These data demonstrated that the alternatively spliced 9-2 mRNA exists, albeit at a low level, in IFN-treated human HT1080 cells. In the next set of experiments, the presence of the 9-2 protein in IFN-treated HT1080 cells was demonstrated. For this purpose, a 9-2-specific antibody was raised in rabbits using a peptide from its specific carboxyl-terminal domain as an antigen. This peptide sequence is underlined in Fig. 1C. For characterizing this antibody, extracts of cells expressing high quantities of the 3-9/E16, E18, or 9-2 isozyme were used. The 3-9 and E18 proteins were expressed in transfected HT1080 cells, but because the 9-2 isozyme killed these cells, we had to use a different source: insect cells infected with the appropriate recombinant baculovirus (10Ghosh A. Sarkar S.N. Guo W. Bandyopadhyay S. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33220-33226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A high resolution Western blot using a common antibody shows the presence of each isozyme in the respective cell extracts (Fig. 1D, lanes 1–3). In contrast, the newly raised 9-2-specific antibody recognized the 9-2 protein only (Fig. 1D, lanes 4–6), thus establishing its specificity. The 9-2-specific antibody was then used to analyze extracts of IFN-treated and untreated cells. Because we anticipated that the level of the 9-2 protein would be low, the 2-5(A) synthetases were enriched from the cell extracts by binding to poly(I)·poly(C) agarose before Western blot analysis using the 9-2-specific antibody. As shown in Fig. 1D, the 9-2 protein was clearly present in the extract of IFN-treated HT1080 cells (lane 7) but not in that of untreated cells (lane 8). Immunofluorescence assays showed that the 9-2 protein is primarily cytoplasmic (data not shown). Because ectopic expression of 9-2 by transfection of HT1080 cells caused cell death, we wanted to investigate the underlying mechanism. Results shown in Fig.2 demonstrated that it was due to cellular apoptosis. 9-2-expressing cells were clearly TUNEL-positive, an indication of the presence of multiple ends of DNA produced by apoptosis-associated DNA fragmentation (Fig.2A). In contrast, cells expressing the sister isozyme 3-9 were not TUNEL-positive. This was not due to a lower level of 3-9 expression; Western blotting of the cell extracts showed that 3-9 was expressed better than 9-2 (Fig. 2B). In the next series of experiments, the 9-2-mediated apoptotic process was characterized further. For this purpose, 9-2 or 3-9 expression vectors were co-transfected with an expression vector of the cell-surface marker, CD20. CD20-expressing cells were sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorter, cultured for a day, and used for biochemical analyses. As expected, DNA laddering assay showed DNA fragmentation in cells expressing 9-2 but not in cells transfected with 3-9 (Fig. 2F). Cellular apoptosis is often associated with the cleavage of the nuclear proteins PARP and Lamin B. Such cleavages were detected by Western blotting appropriate cell extracts with antibodies to the two proteins (Fig. 2, C and D). As expected, the 115-kDa PARP was cleaved to an 85-kDa derivative in cells expressing 9-2 but not in those expressing 3-9 (Fig.2C). Lamin B (70 kDa) cleavage gives rise to a characteristic 35-kDa fragment (Fig. 2D). Similar to PARP, Lamin B was also cleaved specifically in 9-2-expressing cells. DNA fragmentation and protein cleavages in apoptotic cells are preceded by the activation of specific caspases. Such caspase activation was measured in the extracts of 9-2-expressing cells using caspase-specific substrates and inhibitors. Caspase 3 was highly activated in 9-2-expressing cells (Fig. 2E) but not in 3-9-expressing cells. In contrast, caspase 1 was not activated in these extracts, demonstrating the specificity of caspase activation in 9-2-expressing cells. Another hallmark of cells undergoing apoptosis is the release of cytochrome C from mitochondria to cytoplasm. In 9-2-expressing cells, cytosolic cytochrome C was readily detected (Fig. 2G). As expected, no cytochrome C was present in the cytoplasm of vector-transfected cells, but a large amount of it was present in the cytoplasm of cells transfected with Bax, a known proapoptotic protein (Fig. 2G). This series of experiments demonstrated that 9-2 expression in cells causes cytosolic cytochrome C release and caspase activation followed by PARP and Lamin B cleavage and DNA fragmentation, a series of events known to occur in most cells undergoing apoptosis. Once it was firmly established that 9-2 could cause apoptosis, other 2-5(A) synthetase isozymes were tested for this effect. These proteins were expressed by transfection, and individual cells were stained for protein expression and TUNEL positivity. Of 300 9-2-expressing cells, 225 (75%) were TUNEL-positive (Fig.3A, bar 1). The corresponding numbers for the two sister isozymes, E18 and 3-9, were 4 and 3, respectively (Fig. 3A, bars 2 and 3). No cells expressing another small isozyme, L3, or the medium isozyme P69 were TUNEL-positive (Fig. 3A, bars 4 and 5). Western blotting showed that all isozymes were expressed at similar levels (Fig. 3A, inset). Thus, the proapoptotic activity was an exclusive property of the 9-2 isozyme. Because all isozymes could synthesize 2-5(A) and this was the only known activity of this class of proteins, there was no obvious explanation of the proapoptotic activity of the 9-2 protein. The first indication that we may have uncovered an independent activity came from testing the effect of 9-2 expression in RNase L−/− fibroblasts (a gift of Robert Silverman). These cells were killed as efficiently as the WT cells by 9-2, indicating that 2-5(A) activation of RNase L was not required for the apoptotic effect (data not shown). This prompted us to test whether the enzymatic activity of the 9-2 protein was dispensable as well. We had previously generated an enzymatically inactive mutant of 9-2, 9-2M, in which two Asp residues at its active center were replaced by Ala residues (9Sarkar S.N. Ghosh A. Wang H.W. Sung S.S. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25535-25542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This mutant of 9-2 was active in causing apoptosis in the HT1080 cells as measured by TUNEL assay (Fig. 3B). Another mutant of 9-2, 9-2 TM, is also enzymatically inactive because it is a monomer (10Ghosh A. Sarkar S.N. Guo W. Bandyopadhyay S. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33220-33226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This mutant retained the proapoptotic activity as well (Fig. 3B). The two enzymatically inactive mutant proteins were expressed to the same levels as the WT protein (Fig. 3C). When their apoptotic activities were quantitated, 9-2M killed 67% of the cells and 9-2 TM killed 61% of the cells as compared with 75% killing by the WT protein (Fig. 3C, bars 1–3). These results clearly established that the proapoptotic activity of 9-2 was independent of its ability to synthesize 2-5(A) and must be mediated by a different pathway. Because the enzymatic activity of 9-2 was not required for its apoptotic activity, we searched for an alternative biochemical explanation for its apoptotic action. A possible lead came from the observation that the 9-2 protein may contain a putative Bcl-2 homology domain 3. This domain was present in the isozyme-specific carboxyl-terminal tail of the protein between residues 372 and 393 (Fig.4A). When compared with the sequences of the BH3 domains of several members of the Bcl-2 family, all of them, including 9-2, contained predicted α-helical structures in this region. To probe their structures further, molecular modeling studies were done using the known structure of the BH3 domain of BclxL as the template (Fig. 4B). The BH3 domain of BclxL is known to be an amphipathic α-helix. The BH3 domain of Bad and the putative BH3 domain of 9-2 assumed very similar structures when the BclxL residues were replaced by the corresponding residues of the two other proteins. The hydrophilic surface of the BclxL BH3 domain contains two charged residues, Gln and Asp, and the corresponding hydrophobic surface contains two residues, Leu and Phe, that are known to be required to maintain the function of this domain. The Leu, Phe, and Asp residues were conserved in similar locations in the BH3 domains of 9-2 and Bad as well, whereas the Gln residue was replaced by Lys in 9-2 and by Arg in Bad (Fig. 4B). These analyses strongly suggested that the 9-2 protein contains an authentic BH3 domain. Because the 9-2 protein appears to have a BH3 domain, it may exert its proapoptotic activity by binding to the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and BclxL. These proteins contain the BH1 and BH2 domains that form a pocket to which certain BH3 domains can bind. This possibility was tested in the next series of experiments. In the first experiment confocal microscopy was used to examine whether the subcellular location of 9-2 partially overlaps with those of Bcl-2 (Fig. 5A). The distribution of 9-2 is shown in green and that of Bcl-2 in red. When the green image was overlain with the red image, many yellow areas were observed, indicating that subpopulations of 9-2 are located in the same compartments where Bcl-2 resides in cells.

To address this issue we down-regulated the enzyme in normal rat kidney fibroblasts by stable transfection of its cDNA in an antisense orientation. The selected clones revealed an absence of lysyl oxidase and dramatic phenotypic changes, interpretable as signs of transformation. The antisense lysyl oxidase clones showed, indeed, loose attachment to the plate and anchorage-independent growth and were highly tumorigenic in nude mice. Moreover, we found an impaired response of the PDGF and IGF-1 receptors to their ligands. In particular, the transformed cells showed a down-regulation of both PDGF receptors and expressed the 105-kDa isoform of the IGF-1β receptor, which was not present in the normal control cells. The lack of response to PDGF-BB has been described as a feature of many ras-transformed phenotypes. Therefore, we looked at the status of the p21ras. Indeed, we found a significantly higher level of active p21ras both during steady-state growth and prolonged starvation. Our data reveal new evidence for a tumor suppressor activity of lysyl oxidase, highlighting its particular role in controlling Ras activation and growth factor dependence.

Indeed, it catalyzes the oxidative deamination of peptidyl lysine and hydroxylysine to peptidyl-α-aminoadipic-δ-semialdehyde into elastin and collagen chains. The consequent aldehydes lead to a spontaneous condensation forming inter- and intrachain cross-links. This post-translational modification of extracellular matrix molecules seems to have a very important role both for collagen and elastin structural aspects and for triggering still unknown signal transduction pathways. Several reports have suggested a clear association between organ fibrosis and increased LOX activity (3Murawaki Y. Kusakabe Y. Hirayama C.

The most intriguing aspect regarding LOX activity refers to its putative cell phenotype control and/or tumor suppressor activity. In many naturally occurring and oncogene-induced tumors, LOX is down-regulated, while, in contrast, LOX is one of the main genes induced in concomitance with the reversion process (10Contente S.

In particular it seems that LOX was down-regulated in cells transformed byras or ras-dependent oncogenes, so that it was first identified as a “ras recision gene” (rrg) (10Contente S. Kenyon K.

The reversion or the re-transformation did not affect the level of p21ras although other possible mechanisms or parameters were not studied (10Contente S. Kenyon K. Rimoldi D. Friedman R.M. Science. 1990; 249: 796-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The localization of the enzyme is mainly extracellular, although recently it has been confirmed that processed LOX is localized intracellularly and inside the nucleus (16Li W. Nellaiappan K.

Chem. 2000; 275: 36341-36349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) seems to suggest a direct function for LOX in the nucleus. Therefore, LOX may have an intracellular substrate(s) that mediates its ability to control the cell phenotype. Despite these intriguing findings, there are no hypotheses to date about the mechanism through which LOX might actually work as a tumor suppressor. In the present study we have addressed this issue by studying the effects of the down-regulation of LOX in normal rat kidney fibroblast cells (NRK-49F). NRK-49F cells were stably transfected with pCLO3 vector, a pCDNA3 plasmid carrying the fragment from −33 to +985 of the mouse LOX coding sequence (19Contente S. Csiszar K. Kenyon K. Friedman R.M. Genomics. 1993; 16: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) in antisense orientation subcloned in KpnI and XbaI restriction sites. A control transfection on the same cells was performed with the pCDNA3 vector alone. Both transfections were performed in quadruplicates. Several pCLO3 clones (as-LOX) were isolated after extensive selection with G418 and designated as DDM-AL-A/B/C/D for those derived from the antisense LOX-transfected plates. The controls were named DDM-A/B/C/D. From the clones A/B/C/D of both transfections further clones were selected and designated by a number following the letter of the original clone (e.g. A1, A2,···C4). NRK-49F were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 1% glutamine, 1% nonessential amino acids, and antibiotics at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. The clones derived from the transfection with pcDNA3 and pCLO3 plasmids were selected by adding 400 µg/ml G418 to the above medium for at least a month. K-NRK, normal rat kidney fibroblasts transformed by K-ras (American Tissue and Cell Culture (ATCC), Manassas, VA), were grown in the same medium as above. LP8–3 cells, NIH-3T3 fibroblasts transformed by Ha-RasVal-12, were grown in the same medium as above, but with 1% pyruvate and without nonessential amino acids (kindly provided by Dr. Juan Carlos Lacal, Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas, CSIC, Madrid, Spain). The MCF-7 cells are derived from a mammary carcinoma tumor (ATCC) and were grown in the same medium as for NRK-49F, but without nonessential amino acids. About 5 × 103 cells/35-mm plate were seeded in 0.35% top agarose and poured over a layer of 0.5% agarose. Both agarose layers were prepared to contain 1× of the medium required for the indicated cells. The plates were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 under humidified conditions. 5-week-old nude mice clone crl:cd1-nuBR (Charles River, Lecco, Italy) were injected subcutaneously with 106 cells from the following cell lines: controls, NRK-49F, and DDM-C4 (NRK-49F transfected with pCDNA3.1 alone); as-LOX, DDM-AL-A4 and -C6; positive control, LP8–3. The mice were kept under standard sterile conditions and followed for the indicated times. The three dimensions, height (h), length (l), and width (w), of each tumor were measured at the indicated times, and the volumes were calculated according to the following formula: volume = [πh(h2 + 3a2)]/6, where a = (w + l)/4 (20Taguchi A. Blood D.C. del Toro G. Canet A. Lee D.C. Qu W. Tanji N. Lu Y. Lalla E. Fu C. Hofmann M.A. Kislinger T. Ingram M. Lu A. Tanaka H. Hori O. Ogawa S. Stern D.M. Schmidt A.M. Nature. 2000; 405: 354-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). To test the recidivism of the primary neoplasias, tumors from one control individual and two from the as-LOX groups were excised. Then the animals were followed up for 3 weeks. Total cell lysates were prepared in radioimmune precipitation buffer, containing a protease mixture and the phosphatase inhibitor I and II mixtures (Sigma). The lysates were cleared by 30-min centrifugation at 20,000 × g. Typically, 30 µg of the total cell lysate were separated on SDS-PAGE (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Then the gels were analyzed by Western blot with the commercial antibodies indicated in the respective figures. Anti-LOX and anti-LOL rabbit polyclonal have been previously described (7Sommer P. Gleyzal C. Raccurt M. Delbourg M. Serrar M. Joazeiro P. Peyrol S. Kagan H. Trackman P.C. Grimaud J.A. Lab. Invest. 1993; 69: 460-470PubMed Google Scholar, 22Decitre M. Gleyzal C. Raccurt M. Peyrol S. Aubert-Foucher E. Csiszar K. Sommer P. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 143-151PubMed Google Scholar). The recognized proteins were detected by using a secondary anti-rabbit antibody coupled to alkaline phosphatase and developing the blot with NBT/BCIP reagents (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). The immunoprecipitations were performed starting from 500 µg of total cell lysates, which were diluted to 500 µl with StaphA buffer, containing 8.6 mm Na2HPO4, 1.6 mm NaH2PO4, 0.1 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 15 mm NaN3. The samples were first precleared with protein G-agarose resin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and then incubated with the indicated antibodies for 2 h in an ice-cold bath. Finally, they were incubated overnight with 50 µl of protein G-agarose at 4 °C under vigorous shaking. The next day the resin was washed at least four times with StaphA plus 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma). The washed resin was finally resuspended in 20 µl of Laemmli buffer and loaded onto SDS-PAGE for further Western blot analysis. To verify that the as-LOX cells carried the expression vector, we performed PCR to detect the plasmid, using as template the genomic DNA extracted from four independent as-LOX clones. The primers were designed to amplify a fragment overlapping the plasmid and the antisense LOX sequence. The forward primer, specific for pCDNA3.1 vector, was in position 707: 5′-GCAAATGGGCGGTAGGCGTGTAC-3′; the reverse primer was specific for the antisense LOX sequence and designed in position 2304: 5′-GTCACGCTGCGCGTAACCACCACA-3′. The expected product was about 1.6 kilobases. The samples were amplified for 32 cycles with an annealing at 58 °C for 30 s, and the extension step was at 72 °C for 1 min. In the incubation buffer supplied by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) 5% dimethylsulfoxide was added. The lysyl oxidase antisense clones (as-LOX) clones showed striking phenotypic changes when compared with the control clones (Fig.1 A). The Western blot analysis (Fig. 2 A) showed a dramatic down-regulation of LOX in the as-LOX clone (DDM-AL-A4), where the protein was practically undetectable. The same results were obtained in many other as-LOX clones, proving that LOX down-regulation was not the random product of a genomic insertion effect (data not shown). We confirmed with PCR the presence of the transfecting vector pCLO3 integrated in their genomic DNA (Fig. 3). Fig. 2 B also showed that the antisense sequence did not block the translation of LOX-like (LOL) messenger, the most LOX-related among the other components of the LOX gene family (23Kenyon K.

Moreover, we noticed a stronger ability to grow under starvation conditions for more than 48 h, whereas the control clones showed a typical sufferance evident from the reduction of the cytosolic compartment and elongation of the cell body (Fig. 1 A). The same picture shows that the density of the as-LOX cells increased despite starvation, whereas there was no growth in the control cells, and cell death was evident (Fig. 1,A and B). These observations prompted us to look for the typical features of tumorigenicity. Fig.4, A and B shows a soft-agar colony-forming assay that tests the ability of the cells to grow under anchorage-independent conditions. The experiment also included two positive controls, K-NRK cells, K-rasoncogene-transformed homologous to NRK-49F, and a mammary tumor cell line, MCF-7. In Fig. 4 A, a macroscopic comparison of the colony-forming ability of two control clones versus two as-LOX clones selected from two independent transfections is shown. It is clear that as-LOX can grow in soft-agar forming a great number of large colonies, whereas the control cells formed fewer and smaller colonies, almost undetectable to the naked eye. As expected, K-NRK and MCF-7 cells also formed colonies, although K-NRK to a lesser extent. Fig. 4 B shows a microscopic image of the colonies formed by the tested cell lines. It appears that as-LOX clones and MCF-7 produced comparable size colonies. As a further approach to define the transformed status of as-LOX cells, we tested their tumorigenicity when injected in nude mice. We injected subcutaneously 10−6cells/mouse in a total of 14 animals for each cell line tested. We used two selected as-LOX clones, DDM-AL/A4 and C6, and a NIH-3T3 cell line transformed by Ha-ras Val-12 (LP8–3) (27Carnero A. Cuadrado A. del Peso L. Lacal J.C. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1387-1395PubMed Google Scholar) as a positive control. We used NRK-49F cells transfected with the vector alone as well as the parental NRK-49F cells as negative controls. The mice injected with either as-LOX clones had a strong and extremely rapid tumorigenic response (Fig.5 A). Subcutaneous nodules were already detectable after four days from the injection. The negative controls did not show any signs of tumor. The mice injected with LP8–3 cells also developed small tumors during the first week, and between day 8 and 14 they developed tumors comparable in size to the ones formed in the as-LOX-injected mice. The histology showed that the tumors developed by as-LOX cells were classical fibrosarcomas (data not shown). Late in the experiment, 5 of 28 control mice developed some very small tumors. A potential tumorigenicity of NRK-49F is also mentioned in the American Tissue and Cell Culture catalog and seems to be suggested also by those little colonies developed in our soft-agar experiments (Fig. 4, A and B). Moreover, to test the metastatic potential of the tumors developed in the as-LOX-injected mice, we excised the tumors in two animals from the group and followed them up for recidivism. After 10–15 days from the excision of the primary tumor, both animals developed a very aggressive secondary tumor, witnessing a high metastatic potential (Fig. 5 B). In fact, in the autopsy of the two tested animals, we found a massive infiltration of the peritoneum and lungs (Fig. 5 C). We submitted one of the control animals, which had developed a small tumor, to the same procedure, but it did not show recidivism during the tested time. Fig. 5 D shows a graphical comparison of tumor development among the tested cell lines. The tumorigenicity induced by LOX down-regulation is striking and comparable with the one induced by the NIH-3T3 cells expressing the activatedras-proto-oncogene (LP8–3).Figure 2LOX and LOL protein expression in control and as-LOX cells. 30 µg of total cell lysates from the indicated cell lines were analyzed by Western blot with anti-LOX (A, Ref. 7Sommer P.

Nothing was detected in the control mouse during the following 1 week of follow-up.C, metastasized internal organs: lungs, pleura, and subcutis nodes from the recidivant mice. D, time-course of tumor development. The volumes measured at the indicated times were calculated as described under “Materials and Methods.” The graph reports the average tumor volume from each group ± S.E. The significance of the differences between as-LOX and control cells was evaluated by Student's t test and is indicated in the graph.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In an attempt to characterize the as-LOX cells at a molecular level, we investigated the response to several growth factors and the levels of their respective receptors. Among them, we found that the treatment with PDGF-BB did not produce tyrosine autophosphorylation of the PDGF-β receptor. Fig. 6 A(upper panel) shows the anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblot of the immunoprecipitated PDGF-β receptor from control and as-LOX cells after 5 and 10 min of PDGF-BB treatment. It clearly appears that the tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor occurs only in the control cells, whereas the signal is completely absent in the as-LOX cells. Surprisingly, when we challenged the same immunoprecipitate with a specific anti-PDGF-β receptor to control the efficiency of the immunoprecipitation, we could not detect a band in the as-LOX clones (Fig. 6 A, lower panel). Thus, the absence of response seems to be due to a dramatic down-regulation of the receptor itself, rather than to a biochemical defect. These results prompted us to test the response of the PDGF-α receptor as well, to verify if our finding was isolated to the β receptor. Fig. 6 B shows that also in this case there was no autophosphorylation of the receptor upon PDGF-BB triggering (upper panel), because of its dramatically inhibited expression (lower panel). The same results were obtained challenging the cells with PDGF-AA (data not shown). Moreover, we analyzed the response to another important growth factor, IGF-1, often implicated in transformation and tumorigenesis as well as in differentiation processes (28Garrouste F.L.

Surprisingly, we detected an abnormal expression of the IGF-1β receptor, appreciably different in molecular weight and amount. Fig.7 A shows that while NRK-49F and control-transfected cells exhibited the normal 95-kDa β receptor, the as-LOX showed a higher expression of the 105-kDa isoform. Interestingly, in the same Western blot it can be observed that the LP8–3 cell line (NIH-3T3 expressing activated Ha-ras) predominantly displayed the same receptor isoform. This 105-kDa variant seems to be tissue-specific and, according to some investigators, expressed during fetal development (32Hainaut P. Kowalski A. Giorgetti S. Baron V. Van Obberghen E. Biochem.

Chem. 1990; 265: 9340-9345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A functional analysis of the IGF-1β receptor showed that again in as-LOX cells there was no autophosphorylation upon IGF-1 challenging (Fig. 6, B and C), although this isoform has been described as fully functional.Figure 7Impaired response of IGF-1β receptor to IGF-1 in as-LOX cells. A, 30 µg of the indicated cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot with anti-IGF-1β receptor polyclonal antibodies (C-20:sc-713).B, cells were starved for 48 h and then treated with 5 ng/ml of IGF-1 for 10 min. 500 µg of total cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-IGF-1β receptor polyclonal antibodies, divided into two aliquots and analyzed by Western blot with anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibodies (PY-99) or C,anti-IGF-1β receptor polyclonal antibodies. The figure is representative of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The down-regulation and/or absence of PDGF receptor autophosphorylation are a recurrent feature of some of the ras-transformed cell lines (37Rake J.B. Quinones M.A. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5348-5352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Paasinen-Sohns A. Holtta E.

Carcinog. 1999; 25: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed the functional state of p21ras by using the Raf-1 Ras-Binding Domain (RBD) pull-down assay, which specifically recognizes the GTP-bound form of p21ras. Fig.8 A shows that the active fraction of p21ras is highly increased in the two as-LOX clones that we used to induce tumors in the athymic mice. The same blot showed that the difference in the activated fraction of p21ras is not because of an increase in its total pool. Moreover, we studied the status of p21ras under different growth conditions: after 48 h of starvation, after 24 h of 10% FCS exposure following starvation, or a steady-state confluent status. Fig. 8 Bshows that the activated form of the protein is overall much higher in the as-LOX cells when compared with the control cells. Indeed, the active p21ras was between 25 and 11 times higher than the control cells (Fig. 8 C), depending on their growth status. As expected, the difference was highest after 48 h of starvation, when normal cells do not show any activated p21ras, whereas it was minimum (but still very high) after growth in 10% FCS, certainly as a result of the serum mitogenic stimulus. Our findings prove that LOX can act as a tumor suppressor, at least in our cell model. Previous attempts to antagonize the tumorigenicity ofras-transformed cells by overexpressing LOX did not succeed, 2A. Donato, personal observations. which is in agreement with the tumor suppressor theory. The lack of tumor suppressor can trigger the transformation process, if in a permissive genetic background (e.g. oncogene activation), but its increase cannot overcome an ongoing tumorigenic event. Perhaps, our NRK-49F cells have a latent potential tumorigenicity, like many immortalized cell lines. In this contest, the knockdown of LOX unleashed their tumorigenic potential. Friedman and co-workers (10Contente S. Kenyon K. Rimoldi D. Friedman R.M. Science. 1990; 249: 796-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 11Kenyon K. Contente S. Trackman P.C. Tang J. Kagan H.M. Friedman R.M. Science. 1991; 253: 802Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) obtained similar results, but in a more artificial model, where the target cells, NIH-3T3, were already transformed by H-ras and eventually induced to revert by an interferon β/γ treatment (10Contente S. Kenyon K. Rimoldi D. Friedman R.M. Science. 1990; 249: 796-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In these reverted cells, the down-regulation of LOX by antisense transfection brought the cells back to their transformed phenotype. Although very intriguing, the pre-existence of an activated p21ras and the treatment with interferon-introduced variables might have influenced the results. In fact, the reversion by interferon did not affect the level of H-ras product, which, moreover, was under a heterologous LTR promoter. Our study confirms Friedman's findings, but in a more physiological model. Indeed, we used normal fibroblasts that did not show abnormal levels of active p21ras and seemed normally regulated by the main growth factors. We also showed that as-LOX cells were unresponsive to some growth factors, the meaning of which is more difficult to explain. As mentioned above, this is not a new feature for a transformed cell line. The most obvious and rational physiological meaning of this finding might be that the pathway downstream of the growth factor receptor is already activated. Indeed, this was the case, when we look at the constitutive activation of p21ras in the as-LOX cells. As elsewhere suggested, our results also reinforced the idea of a control of LOX onras proto-oncogene. From our data it cannot be determined if the activation of p21ras is a direct consequence of a de-regulation depending on LOX absence or is rather the indirect result of the cell transformation. Certainly, Ras activation must play an important role in the described tumorigenic process, probably enhanced by the loss of response to two important growth factors. Likely, other elements of the mitogenic pathway are activated as well, which might have triggered a negative feedback down-regulating the level of the receptors, at least for PDGF. A very recent study (40Baron V. Schwartz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39318-39323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) suggests that the PDGF-β receptor can be down-regulated in an ubiquitin-dependent fashion as a consequence of loss of attachment to the substrate. We don't know yet, but a similar mechanism might be active in our as-LOX cells, because these cells display a looser attachment to the plate and, as a consequence, an elevated sensitivity to the trypsin. Regarding the IGF-1β receptor, the meaning of the 105-kDa isoform is not clear. We believe that it is related to a sort of de-differentiation or transformation into a different cell type. Nevertheless, in this case the signal from the growth factor seems abolished. All together, our data suggest that the absence of LOX determined a sort of growth factor independence. It should be recalled that growth factors are not synonymous to mitosis, but they are rather controllers of the cell cycle, maintaining the correct equilibrium with other extracellular signals. In our case, at least two of these important controllers are lost and this, by itself, might account for the observed transformation. More studies need to be performed to analyze other elements of the signal transduction in the as-LOX cells, mainly involving the cell-substrate and cell-cell attachment, which also seem to be altered. More challenging is the goal of determining the mechanisms by which the absence of LOX induced the described alterations. New insights will certainly be revealed by the identification of putative intracellular LOX targets or substrates, one of our next goals."

Hyperactive alleles of these proteins cause overproduction of target genes that include drug efflux pumps, which in turn confer high level drug resistance. Here we provide evidence that both Pdr1p and Pdr3p act to regulate production of an enzyme involved in sphingolipid biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae. The last step in formation of the major sphingolipid in the yeast plasma membrane, mannosyldiinositol phosphorylceramide, is catalyzed by the product of the IPT1 gene, inositol phosphotransferase (Ipt1p). Transcription of the IPT1 gene is responsive to changes in activity of Pdr1p and Pdr3p. A single Pdr1p/Pdr3p response element is present in the IPT1 promoter and is required for regulation by these factors. Loss of IPT1 has complex effects on drug resistance of the resulting strain, consistent with an important role for mannosyldiinositol phosphorylceramide in normal plasma membrane function. Direct assay for lipid contents of cells demonstrates that changes in sphingolipid composition correlate with changes in the activity of Pdr3p.

These lipids compose 30% of the total phospholipids present in the yeast plasma membrane, with M(IP)2C accounting for 75% of these yeast sphingolipids (1Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 305-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Control of the biosynthesis of these inositol-containing sphingolipids (Fig. 1) is critical to maintain normal function of the plasma membrane even though production of MIPC or M(IP)2C is not required for viability (2Zhao C.

Although maintenance of normal sphingolipid levels is crucial forS. cerevisiae cell function, little information is available detailing the mechanisms that regulate their biosynthesis. Recently, microarray experiments have provided insight into a possible means of regulation of sphingolipid biosynthetic enzyme production. DeRisiet al. (4DeRisi J. van den Hazel B. Marc P. Balzi E.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) profiled the genomic expression pattern of cells containing hyperactive forms of the Pdr1p and Pdr3p transcription factors. Pdr1p and Pdr3p are Cys6-Zn(II) transcription factors that act to modulate expression of genes involved in multiple or pleiotropic drug resistance in S. cerevisiae (see Refs. 5Balzi E. Goffeau A. J.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) identified genes that are transcriptionally up-regulated in the presence of hyperactive alleles of Pdr1p and/or Pdr3p. These loci included previously known Pdr1p/Pdr3p target genes like PDR5and YOR1 as well as new members of this regulon such as theIPT1 locus. IPT1 encodes the last step in biosynthesis of sphingolipids, inositol phosphotransferase, that produces M(IP)2C from MIPC (3Dickson R.C. Nagiec E.E. Wells G.B. Nagiec M.M. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29620-29625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Microarray analysis indicated that levels of IPT1mRNA increased by 2-fold in the presence of hyperactive forms of Pdr1p or Pdr3p (4DeRisi J. van den Hazel B. Marc P. Balzi E. Brown P. Jacq C. Goffeau A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Examination of the 5′-noncoding region ofIPT1 suggested the presence of a Pdr1p/Pdr3p response element (PDRE), the binding site for these transcriptional regulatory proteins (12Katzmann D.J. Hallstrom T.C. Mahe Y. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23049-23054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In the work described here, we provide evidence that this PDRE is required for the previously observed induction ofIPT1 gene expression by hyperactive alleles ofPDR1 and PDR3. Additionally, we have found that loss of the mitochondrial genome (ρ0 cell) leads to activation of Pdr3p, but not Pdr1p (13Hallstrom T.C. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37347-37356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Transcription ofIPT1 is induced in ρ0 cells in a fashion parallel to that of PDR5. Finally, the effects on biosynthesis of phospholipids are assayed in response to loss of the mitochondrial genome alone or simultaneous to loss of PDR3. These data strongly suggest that sphingolipid biosynthesis is a physiological target of Pdr1p/Pdr3p regulation and provide the first description of how production of these important lipids is transcriptionally regulated.

Using pLL1 as a template, a mutant form of theIPT1 PDRE was generated by PCR employing the primer pair CTT CTC GAG GAA CAA AAA TGT GAA CGC and GTA AAA CGA CGG CCA GT (M13 forward primer) along with the primer pair GGC GTC AAG AAG CGG CG and AAC AGC TAT GAC CAT G (M13 reverse primer). These products were isolated, and aliquots were pooled and reamplified with M13 forward and reverse primers. The resulting PCR fragment was cloned as anEcoRI/BamHI fragment into pBluescript SK+ and pSEYC102 as described above. A subclone of theIPT1 promoter was prepared for use as a template in DNase I protection experiments using PCR and the primer pair CGG AAT TCG GCG AAG AAG GCG G and CGG GAT CCG CGG CGA TAA ACG G. This PCR product was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and cloned into pBluescript SK+ digested with the same restriction enzymes. This plasmid was designated pLL3.

The ipt1-Δ1::URA3 disruption allele was constructed by cleaving a genomic clone of IPT withKpnI/AvrII to remove nucleotides 669–1096 of the 1584-base pair open reading frame. This fragment was replaced with theURA3 gene, and the resulting plasmid was designated pipt1::URA3. The disruption allele was separated from vector sequences by EcoRI/BglI digestion and used to transform cells to Ura3+. Amino-terminal fragments of Pdr1p and Pdr3p were expressed in bacterial cells as described previously (12Katzmann D.J. Hallstrom T.C. Mahe Y. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol.

Probes were generated from pLL3 cut with eitherEcoRI or BamHI, followed by treatment with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase. DNA fragments were labeled by incubation with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Radiolabeled IPT1 fragments were released from the vector by secondary restriction digestion and gel-purified.

An internal PvuII fragment from IPT1 and aBamHI/HindIII fragment from the ACT1gene were used as probes and were labeled by nick translation with [α-32P]dCTP. Hybridizations were carried out for 15 h at 42 °C in buffer containing 40% formamide, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, 5× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, and 20 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. The membranes were washed at 55 °C in 1× SSC and 0.2% SDS and then exposed to x-ray film. Assay of β-galactosidase activity produced from fusion genes was accomplished either by preparing a whole cell protein extract (21Rose M. Botstein D.

Aliquots corresponding to ∼107 cells were harvested in sterile Eppendorf tubes, resuspended in 1 ml of fresh synthetic complete medium (lacking serine for serine labeling), and transferred to sterile 15-ml glass test tubes. The cultures were preincubated with shaking for 120 min at 30 °C and 200 rpm and then labeled with either 3 μCi ofd-erythro-[4,5-3H]dihydrosphingosine ([3H]DHS; BioTrend, Cologne, Germany) or 20 μCi of [3H]serine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) for an additional 60 min. 1 ml of YPD medium containing 200 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate was inoculated from a single colony. The cells were grown in sterile 15-ml glass test tubes at 30 °C and 200 rpm for at least 10 generations to late log phase. Prior to harvesting, the cell density was determined by absorbance of a 1:20 dilution at 600 nm. The cultures were chilled on ice for 5 min and then harvested at 4 °C by centrifugation at 3000 × g. Preparation of whole cell lipid extracts was performed according to protocol IIIB as described (23Hanson B.A. Lester R.L. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 309-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If necessary, lipids were deacylated by mild alkaline hydrolysis (24Becker G.W. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 142: 747-754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and afterward partitioned between butanol and water as described (25Krakow J.L. Hereld D. Bangs J.D. Hart G.W. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12147-12153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dried lipid extracts were resuspended in 100 μl (pulse-labeled cells) or 30 μl (steady-state labeled cells) of chloroform/methanol/water (10:10:3, v/v/v) per 107 cells. Usually, 5 μl/lane was spotted onto high performance TLC plates (Kieselgel 60, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and resolved in chloroform, methanol, and 4.2 n NH4OH (9:7:2, v/v/v). Tritium-labeled lipids were treated with EN3HANCE (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and subjected to autoradiography/fluorography using X-Omat films (Eastman Kodak Co.). Quantitation of 32P-labeled lipids was performed using a Fuji FLA2000 phosphoimager (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan). All bands were identified using authentic standards, except for ceramide, which was identified due to its sensitivity to fumonisin B1 in combination with its RF value. Authentic sphingolipid standards were provided by Robert L. Lester (University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY). A possible regulatory influence of the Pdr1p and/or Pdr3p transcription factor on sphingolipid biosynthesis was suggested by two complementary observations. First, inspection of the IPT1 promoter sequence indicated the presence of a sequence element identical to known PDREs located from −454 to −445 base pairs upstream of theIPT1 ATG codon. The IPT1 PDRE has the sequence TTCCGCGGAA, which is identical to known PDREs located inPDR3 (26Delahodde A. Delaveau T. Jacq C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4043-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and PDR5 (12Katzmann D.J. Hallstrom T.C. Mahe Y. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23049-23054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Second, microarray experiments identified IPT1 as a potential target gene of hyperactive forms of both Pdr1p and Pdr3p (4DeRisi J. van den Hazel B. Marc P. Balzi E. Brown P. Jacq C. Goffeau A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). To confirm thatIPT1 mRNA levels respond to alterations in the activity of Pdr1p, we examined the expression of IPT1 mRNA by Northern analysis. Total RNA was isolated from cells carrying five different alleles of PDR1. These alleles covered a range of activity varying from no Pdr1p (pdr1-Δ2) to the hyperactive alleles (PDR1-2, PDR1-3, andPDR1-6), which produce higher levels of drug resistance and target gene expression than the wild-type gene. IPT1mRNA was analyzed along with ACT1 as a control for loading (Fig. 2). This analysis is entirely consistent with the previous microarray data and demonstrates that IPT1 mRNA levels were highest in the cells carrying the hyperactive alleles and were reduced in wild-type or pdr1-Δ2-containing cells. We conclude from these data that the expression of the genomic copy ofIPT1 is sensitive to the level of Pdr1p activity. To determine if the influence of Pdr1p was exerted at the level of theIPT1 promoter, we analyzed the regulation of anIPT1-lacZ fusion gene. To facilitate measurement of IPT1 gene expression, we fused a DNA fragment extending from the IPT1ATG codon to 621 base pairs of 5′-noncoding sequences with theEscherichia coli lacZ gene carried in the shuttle vector pSEYC102 (16Emr S.D. Vassarotti A. Garret J. Geller B.C. Takeda M. Douglas M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This plasmid produces β-galactosidase activity under the control of the IPT1 transcriptional and translational regulatory signals. This IPT1-lacZ fusion gene was introduced into several different genetic backgrounds, producing different levels of Pdr1p activity, and expression of the fusion gene was assayed (Table II).Table IIPdr1p control of IPT1 expressionStrainPDR1/PDR3allelesβ-Galactosidase activityIPT1-lacZmPDRE-IPT1-lacZPDR5-lacZunits/mgSEY6210PDR1/PDR329 ± 821 ± 6166 ± 40PB2PDR1/pdr3-Δ1::hisG33 ± 721 ± 5134 ± 37PB3pdr1-Δ2::hisG/PDR330 ± 922 ± 9151 ± 28PB4pdr1-Δ2::hisG/pdr3-Δ1::hisG30 ± 626 ± 412 ± 3PB4/PDR1PB4/pRS315-PDR132 ± 323 ± 6103 ± 17PB4/PDR1–3PB4/pRS315-PDR1–3166 ± 2920 ± 44210 ± 809PB4/PDR1–6PB4/pRS315-PDR1–6131 ± 2618 ± 43096 ± 320The indicated lacZ fusion genes were introduced into several different strains with different complements of PDR1 andPDR3. Transformants were grown to mid-log phase, and β-galactosidase activities were determined in protein extracts as described (21Rose M. Botstein D. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). IPT1-lacZ is a gene fusion between the wild-type IPT1 promoter and lacZ, whereasmPDRE-IPT1-lacZ is the same construct, but with the PDRE altered by site-directed mutagenesis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” PDR5-lacZ is a control for a known Pdr1p/Pdr3p-responsive gene (10Katzmann D.J.

Burnett P.E. Golin J. Mahe Y. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4653-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The IPT1-lacZ fusion gene directed production of 30 units/mg β-galactosidase activity in wild-type cells. This level of expression was not significantly influenced upon loss of either thePDR1 or PDR3 gene alone or in combination. However, introduction of the hyperactive alleles of PDR1(PDR1-3 and PDR1-6) led to an increase inIPT1 expression, consistent with the behavior of the genomic copy of IPT1. Expression of the PDR5 gene, which is known to be highly dependent on the presence of eitherPDR1 or PDR3 (10Katzmann D.J. Burnett P.E. Golin J. Mahe Y. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4653-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), also showed no significant decrease when either transcription factor was removed alone, but was strongly inhibited upon loss of both. PDR5 was similarly up-regulated when the hyperactive alleles of PDR1 were introduced. These data argue that, although IPT1 expression has a significant PDR1/PDR3-independent component, gain-of-function forms of Pdr1p are capable of elevating expression of this sphingolipid biosynthetic enzyme-encoding gene. To determine if this effect of Pdr1p requires the presence of the PDRE in theIPT1 promoter, a site-directed mutation was produced that removed this PDRE. This mutant IPT1 promoter (mPDRE-IPT1) was then placed in the lacZ fusion plasmid and introduced into the strains with differentially activePDR1 alleles. Loss of the PDRE from IPT1 eliminated the response of this promoter to the hyperactive forms of Pdr1p. This analysis indicates that not only does Pdr1p regulate expression ofIPT1 and that a single PDRE, located at −450 base pairs upstream of the ATG codon, is required for this regulatory effect, but that this single PDRE also mediates the response of IPT1 to Pdr3p as discussed below. The presence of a PDRE in the promoter of IPT1 suggests that Pdr1p (and likely Pdr3p) will directly interact with this DNA element as seen in a variety of other Pdr1p/Pdr3p-regulated genes. To test this idea, DNase I protection experiments were carried out examining the ability of bacterially produced Pdr1p and Pdr3p to bind to the IPT1promoter (Fig. 3). DNase I reactions performed in the absence of protein or the presence of protein extract prepared from bacterial cells containing the empty expression vector were indistinguishable. Extracts prepared from cells expressing the DNA-binding domains of Pdr1p or Pdr3p were able to inhibit DNase I cleavage over sequences corresponding to theIPT1 PDRE. Both factors protect approximately equal regions of the promoter and induce strong DNase I-hypersensitive cleavage sites on both DNA strands between the PDRE and the IPT1 ATG codon. This analysis demonstrates that both Pdr1p and Pdr3p can directly bind to the IPT1 PDRE and supports the view that this binding is important in transcriptional control of IPT1. Recently, we have found that the activity of Pdr3p is strongly regulated by the mitochondrial status of cells (13Hallstrom T.C. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37347-37356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Loss of the mitochondrial genome or the F1F0/cytochrome oxidase assembly factor Oxa1p leads to strong activation of PDR5 transcription in a Pdr3p-dependent fashion. To determine if IPT1expression might also be regulated in response to loss of mitochondrial function, we examined the expression of the IPT1-lacZ fusion gene in ρ0 cells (TableIII).Table IIIIPT1 expression responds to PDR3 and mitochondrial statusβ-Galactosidase activityIPT1-lacZmPDRE-IPT1-lacZunits/ODSEY6210(ρ+)15 ± 415 ± 5SEY6210(ρ0)31 ± 615 ± 5SEY6210(ρ+)/pRS31515 ± 310 ± 1SEY6210(ρ+)/pRS315-PDR3–1128 ± 210 ± 1Wild-type (SEY6210 (ρ+)) or mitochondrial genome-deficient (SEY6210 (ρ0) versions of SEY6210 were transformed with the indicated lacZ gene fusions and PDR3 expression plasmids. Transformants were grown to mid-log phase and assayed for β-galactosidase activity using permeabilized cells (22Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Open table in a new tab Wild-type (SEY6210 (ρ+)) or mitochondrial genome-deficient (SEY6210 (ρ0) versions of SEY6210 were transformed with the indicated lacZ gene fusions and PDR3 expression plasmids.

Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Loss of the mitochondrial genome led to an increase inIPT1-lacZ expression from 15 units/OD in wild-type cells to 31 units/OD in ρ0 cells. Introduction of the hyperactive allele of PDR3, PDR3-11, into wild-type cells along with the IPT1-lacZ gene fusion led to production of 28 units/OD of β-galactosidase activity. These data argue that Pdr3p can influence expression of IPT1 and that this gene is induced in response to loss of the mitochondrial genome. This finding led us to examine if changes in sphingolipid composition/synthesis could be detected in ρ0 cells. The above data indicate that IPT1 gene expression is both responsive to Pdr1p/Pdr3p control and induced in response to loss of the mitochondrial genome. These findings suggest the possibility that PDR3 activation following loss of the mitochondrial genome might alter the efficiency of the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway. To examine this idea, we analyzed the rates of sphingolipid synthesis by short-term labeling of the cells with [3H]DHS or [3H]serine. Wild-type cells incorporated exogenously added [3H]DHS into ceramide, IPC, MIPC, and M(IP)2C (Fig.4). Along with these complex lipids, [3H]DHS was also recovered in its hydroxylated derivative phytosphingosine as well as in DHS 1-phosphate. The diacylglycerol-based phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylcholine were also labeled from DHS via conversion of DHS 1-phosphate into palmitate, due to the action of the sphingoid base phosphate lyase Dpl1p (27Saba J.D. Nara F. Bielawska A. Garrett S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26087-26090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The loss of the mitochondrial genome in the ρ0 strain led to a different labeling pattern compared with the wild type. The amount of MIPC was reduced, whereas IPC-IV and M(IP)2C were elevated in the ρ0 strain. Strikingly, elimination of PDR3from the ρ0 strain returned MIPC and M(IP)2C levels back to those seen in the wild-type background, but did not restore normal IPC-IV levels. The deletion of PDR1 and DR3 in the wild-type background did not influence the lipid labeling pattern (data not shown), consistent with the lack of effect of the Δpdr1,Δpdr3background on IPT1 expression (Table II). In contrast to endogenously synthesized DHS, exogenously added DHS is efficiently phosphorylated upon uptake (28Nagiec M.M. Skrzypek M., E.E., N. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol.

In this report, we investigate whether the NF-κB signaling pathway is blocked during apoptosis induced by 2,3-dichloro-5,8-dihydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (NA), an analog of naphthoquinone. It is observed that NA triggers apoptotic cell death in HeLa cells and destroys resistance to apoptosis caused by tumor necrosis factor-α. Data presented in this study establish that p65/RelA, a subunit of NF-κB, is cleaved at Asp97by caspase-3 during apoptosis. Caspase-3-cleaved p65 loses transcriptional activity and potentiates NA-induced apoptosis, in contrast to an uncleavable mutant of p65, which protects the cell from apoptosis. Caspase-3, which is responsible for the cleavage of p65, is activated via the cytochrome c/caspase-9 signaling pathway rather than Fas/caspase-8 pathway during NA-induced apoptosis.

Although the cellular mechanisms underlying apoptosis vary according to the type of stimuli involved, it is generally believed that apoptosis can be induced by the activation of pro-apoptotic signaling or inhibition of survival signaling. A well known survival signal pathway is mediated by the transcription factor, nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)1 (1Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D.

Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar). NF-κB exists as a dimeric complex, comprising different members of the Rel family: p50, p52, p65, c-Rel, and RelB; all of which contain a well conserved amino-terminal 300 amino acid region. This part of the sequence, known as the “Rel homology region,” is responsible for DNA binding, dimerization, and nuclear localization (1Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2931) Google Scholar, 2May M.J. Ghosh S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). In unstimulated cells, NF-κB is located in the cytoplasm as an inactive complex through interactions with inhibitory proteins, IκBα and IκBβ. Upon cellular stimulation processes, such as cytokine induction or ionizing radiation, IκBs are rapidly phosphorylated and degraded. This in turn releases NF-κB, allowing translocation into the nucleus, binding to specific κB sites, and subsequently inducing the expression of target genes responsible for cell survival (4Brockman J.A.

The prevention of degradation or induction of IκB synthesis leads to the inhibition of NF-κB activation (9Auphan N. DiDonato J.A. Rosette C. Helmberg A. Karin M.

Despite a broad-range effect on growth suppression of cancer cells, its hydrophobicity presents difficulties for use as an anticancer drug.

In view of the fact that, as yet, little is known about the mechanism of action of NA, this study involves a detailed investigation into the molecular function of NA in apoptosis. In this report, we demonstrate that NA inhibits tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) induced activation of NF-κB and induces apoptosis of HeLa cells. NA potently inhibits transcriptional activity of NF-κB through caspase-3-mediated proteolytic cleavage of p65 at Asp97. Truncated p65 leads to the inhibition of transcriptional activity of NF-κB, and therefore the promotion of NA-induced apoptosis, while in contrast, uncleavable mutant p65 protein protects cells from apoptosis. These observations suggest that the activation of NF-κB is inhibited by caspase-3-mediated cleavage of p65, indicating that the survival pathway mediated by NF-κB might be abolished during NA-induced apoptosis. Human cervical epitheloid carcinoma (HeLa) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C, in a humidified incubator with an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Unless specified otherwise, all reagents were purchased from Sigma. HeLa cells were seeded in 35-mm plates at an initial density of 2 × 104 cells/plate. Cells were cultured for 16–20 h in complete medium and treated with 15 μm NA, 100 ng/ml TNF-α or a combination of NA and TNF-α for 24 h. After staining cells with trypan blue solution (0.4%), cell survival was quantified by measuring dye exclusion. Cell viability was determined as a percentage of control cells. For the apoptosis assay, HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids encoding p65, p65D97A, or Δp65 with pEGFP-C1 plasmid (CLONTECH) that encodes green fluorescence protein. Apoptotic cells were identified by their rounded morphology, compared with the stead-out morphology of non-apoptotic cells. The number of apoptotic cells were counted and presented as a percentage of the total population of fluorescent cells. Cells were lysed in 400 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K), and incubated at 50 °C for 15 h. DNA was prepared using phenol/chloroform extraction and precipitated with ethanol. After treatment with RNase A (0.1 mg/ml) for 2 h, DNA samples were separated by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels, and visualized with ethidium bromide staining. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested by centrifugation, and lysed in 400 μl of buffer A (10 mmHEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 15 min. Samples were made up to a volume of 25 μl with 10% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 and vortexed for 10 s. After centrifugation at 2,700 × g for 30 s, individual supernatant fractions (cytosolic extracts) were transferred to new tubes. Pellets were treated with ice-cold Buffer C (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.4 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 5 min. Supernatants (nuclear extracts) were transferred to new tubes and kept frozen at −70 °C until further use. The NF-κB-specific oligonucleotide (5′-AACGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCG-3′) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed by incubating 10 μg of nuclear extract with 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in binding buffer (5 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 5 mmMgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) for 10 min at 37 °C. After incubation, end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe was added and the reaction mixture incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Samples were separated by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in low ionic strength buffer, following which dried gels were subjected to autoradiography. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with NF-κB luciferase reporter plasmid for 12 h using the LipofectAMINE method according to manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies). To assess the variation in transfection efficiencies, a control plasmid pCMV (CLONTECH) that expressed the LacZ gene was used. Following 48 h transfection, cells were treated with NA, TNF-α, or a combination of these compounds for 24 h. With a view to investigating the transcriptional activity of NF-κB, cells were transfected with p65, p65D97A, or Δp65, together with NF-κB luciferase reporter plasmid. Luciferase assays were performed after 48 h transfection. Induction of luciferase expression was determined by Lumat LB9501 (Berthold), and standardized to the constitutive level of β-galactosidase activity. Western blot analysis was carried out on 10 μg of nuclear extract. Following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), proteins were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Schleicher and Schuell). Membranes were blocked with TBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 in 5% skimmed milk, and subsequently incubated with the following primary antibodies: anti-p65 COOH terminus (SC-372, Santa Cruz), anti-p65 NH2 terminus (SC-109, Santa Cruz), anti-PARP (N-20, Serotech), anti-Fas (G254–274, Pharmingen), anti-FasL (C-178, Santa Cruz), anti-caspase-3 (C31720, Transduction Laboratory), anti-caspase-9 (SC-7885, Santa Cruz), and cytochromec (65981A, Pharmingen). Membranes were washed with TBST and treated with secondary antibody conjugated with peroxidase. The quantity of protein present was detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), followed by exposure to film. In vitro transcription and translation were performed with the TNT-coupled reticulocyte system (Promega) and [35S]methionine (1,000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Aliquots of 3 μl of in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled p65 were incubated with 2 μl of recombinant caspases (caspase-3, caspase-1, or caspase-8) in the presence or absence of 10 μm YVAD-fmk or Ac-DEVD-CHO in reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mmNaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 90 min at 30 °C. [35S]Methionine-labeled p65 and mutants (p65D97A or p65D469A) were incubated for 90 min with 200 μg of cell lysates prepared from cells treated with NA for 24 h at 30 °C. Samples were subsequently subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Individual mutants of p65 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. For the p65D97A mutant, p65 DNA (100 ng) was incubated with 100 pmol of mutagenic oligomers (5′-GAAAGGACTGCCGGGCTGGCTTCTATGAGGC-3′ and 5′-GCCTCATAGAAGCCAGCCCGGCAGTCCTTTC-3′), and for the p65D469A construct, the oligomers (5′-ACCTGGCATCCGTCGCCAACTCCGAGTTTCA-3′ and 5′-TGAAACTCGGAGTTGGCGACGGATGCCAGGT-3′) were employed. The mutagenesis reaction was performed by polymerase chain reaction using cloned pfu polymerase (Stratagene), polymerase chain reaction was performed as follows: 50 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, 15 min at 68 °C for 12 cycles. Base substitutions of these constructs were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. Additionally, a NH2 terminus deletion mutant (Δp65) was produced by polymerase chain reaction, using the following primers: 5′-GGGAAGCTTGGCTTCTATGAGGCTGAGC-3′ and 5′-GGGGATCCTTAGGAGCTGATCTGACTCAGC-3. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 5 volumes of Buffer A (50 mm Tris Cl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm KH2PO4, 0.4 msucrose, 0.1 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin) and incubated on ice for 20 min. Following incubation, cells were treated with Nonidet P-40 (0.1%) and vortexed for 10 s. Unbroken cells and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Supernatant fractions were additionally centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet mitochondria. After the second round of centrifuging, supernatants containing cytosol were transferred to new tubes. NA has been shown to induce growth inhibition in human hepatocarcinoma cells (16Ham S.W. Park J.U. Lee S.J. Kim W.H. Kang K.H. Choi K.H. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1998; 8: 2507-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The effect of NA on growth in HeLa cells was investigated by treating cells with NA and examining cell viability. We observed a decrease in viability at 12 h, and entire loss of viability after 48 h, indicating that cell death occurs in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1 A). HeLa cells treated with TNF-α demonstrated continuous proliferation, thereby signifying resistance to cell death. However, cells treated with NA for 1 h prior to the addition of TNF-α once again showed significant cell death. In contrast, pretreatment with TNF-α notably reduced cell death induced by NA. In order to determine whether cells are killed via apoptotic processes, we examined internucleosomal DNA fragmentation (a well known biochemical characteristic) after treatment with NA. Apoptotic DNA laddering was faintly observed at 12 h (data not shown), and clearly present at 24 h following NA treatment. DNA fragmentation was not observed in cells exposed to TNF-α, but appeared during pretreatment with NA (Fig. 1 B). These results imply that NA induces cell death in HeLa cells via an apoptotic pathway, and attenuates TNF-α-induced resistance against apoptosis. The results illustrated in Fig. 1 suggest that NA might destroy survival signaling induced by TNF-α, and therefore induce cell apoptosis. NF-κB, a representative anti-apoptotic factor activated by TNF-α, protects cells from TNF-α-induced apoptosis (3Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar). The key question that requires address is whether NA overrides TNF-α-induced resistance by blocking NF-κB activation. NF-κB activity was examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, using32P-labeled NF-κB-specific oligonucleotide (see Fig.2 A for details). Treatment of HeLa cells with TNF-α resulted in remarkable activation of NF-κB, while NA failed to induce NF-κB activation. Moreover, TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB was strongly repressed by pretreatment with NA. We next examined the transcriptional activity of NF-κB, using a luciferase assay. It was observed that TNF-α-induced luciferase expression is significantly inhibited upon pretreatment with NA (Fig.2 B), indicating that NA inhibits TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation and therefore obstructs NF-κB-stimulated anti-apoptotic signaling pathway. Our results suggest that inhibition of NF-κB activity may be part of the mechanism responsible for the apoptotic effect of NA. It is known that NF-κB sequesters in the cytoplasm due to interactions with IκB, and translocates to the nucleus in response to extracellular stimuli (2May M.J. Ghosh S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 17Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4611) Google Scholar). With a view to understanding the molecular mechanism of NA, we examined whether NA-mediated NF-κB suppression is achieved by perturbance of nuclear translocation of NF-κB. HeLa cells were exposed to NA or TNF-α for 30 min, and the level of p65, a subunit of NF-κB in nuclear fractions, was assessed. As shown in Fig.3 A, exposure of cells to TNF-α results in an increase in the level of p65 protein in cell nuclei, in contrast to nuclear p65 in NA-treated cells, where no increase is observed. However, the amount of TNF-α-induced nuclear p65 is not reduced by pretreatment with NA, indicating that NA does not interrupt nuclear translocation of p65 induced by TNF-α. From the above data, we conclude that inhibition of TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation by NA is not due to prevention of nuclear translocation of p65. The next step was to investigate whether there are any changes in the amount of nuclear p65 at 24 h when cells undergo apoptosis induced by NA treatment. It was found that the protein level of nuclear p65 in NA-treated cells is not altered, compared with that of control or TNF-α-treated cells (Fig. 3 B). The cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), a predominant biochemical hallmark of apoptosis, was further observed in cells. Interestingly, the smaller band of p65 (M r ∼ 55,000) (Δp65) was recognized in NA-treated cells, but not in the control or TNF-α-treated cells (Fig.3 B). The truncated p65 (Δp65) is assumed to be a cleavage product generated during the apoptotic process. Experiments were conducted to analyze whether the appearance of Δp65 is correlated with NA-induced apoptosis. As shown in Fig.4 A, the Δp65 band firstly appears in cells treated with 10 μm NA for 24 h. In a time course experiment, this band was observed at 12 h after the addition of 15 μm NA (Fig. 4 B). In contrast to the results obtained with p65, we could not observe any cleavage of p50, which is another component of NF-κB. Since PARP cleavage was observed at 24 h after treatment with NA (Fig. 4 B, last panel), cleavage of p65 should be an earlier event. Our observations suggest that Δp65 is the cleavage product of p65 produced during NA-induced apoptosis. It is known that various proteins are cleaved by caspase-3 during apoptosis (18Sakahira H.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6346-6354Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether caspases are responsible for p65 cleavage, cells were incubated with a caspase-3-specific inhibitor (Ac-DEVD-CHO), and an inhibitor for a broad spectrum of caspases (zVAD-fmk) for 1 h prior to treatment with NA. Cleavage of p65 was monitored by Western blot analysis. Upon treatment with Ac-DEVD-CHO, we failed to observe the appearance of both the cleavage product (Fig.5 A) and DNA fragmentation (Fig. 5 B), which indicates that the cleavage of p65 is catalyzed by caspase-3. To provide direct evidence of this theory,in vitro-translated [35S]p65 was incubated with recombinant caspase-1, caspase-3, and caspase-8. It was noted that while p65 was cleaved by caspase-3 and inhibited by Ac-DEVD-CHO (Fig.6), caspase-1 and caspase-8 had no effect on the cleavage of p65. In view of the data obtained, we conclude that p65 is a substrate of caspase-3 in vitro.Figure 6p65 is cleaved by caspase-3 in vitro. 35S-Labeled wild-type p65 was incubated with recombinant caspase-3 in the absence or presence of caspase inhibitors (Ac-DEVD-CHO or zVAD-fmk), caspase-1, or caspase-8 for 90 min at 30 °C. The reaction mixtures were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and the p65 fragment was visualized by autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Caspase-3 has been shown to recognize and cleave specific substrates containing a conserved DXXD consensus tetrapeptide motif (22Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.T., Yu, V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3796) Google Scholar). Putative recognition sites for caspase-3 exist in the amino acid sequence of p65 (Asp-Cys-Arg-Asn97-Gly98, Asp-Thr-Asp-Asp294-Arg295, Ala-Ser-Val-Asp469-Asn470). In order to identify the cleavage site of p65 recognized by caspase-3, in vitro labeled [35S]p65 was incubated with caspase-3, and Western blot analysis was performed using antibodies against the COOH and NH2 termini of p65. The Δp65 band was recognized by an antibody against the COOH terminus, but not by anti-NH2 terminus antibody (Fig.7 A). Moreover, the Δp65 mutant generated during NA-induced apoptosis was not recognized by the NH2 terminus-specific antibody (Fig. 7 B). Taken together, the results clearly demonstrate that p65 is cleaved by caspase-3 at the NH2 terminus. To determine the exact cleavage site, we introduced point mutations at Asp97(p65D97A) and Asp469 (p65D469A). Wild-type (wt) p65 and the two p65 mutants were translated in vitro and incubated with cell lysates prepared from NA-treated cells. As shown in Fig. 7 C, p65D97A was resistant to caspase-3 in cell lysates, while wt p65 and p65D469A mutant proteins were cleaved. Our results confirm that caspase-3 cleaves the Asp-Cys-Arg-Asp97-Gly98 motif of p65 during NA-induced apoptosis. The findings so far implicate that NF-κB might be inactivated through caspase-3-mediated cleavage of p65 after the Asp97 residue during NA-induced apoptosis. The role of caspase-3-mediated p65 cleavage on NF-κB activity and apoptosis was further investigated. The NH2terminus of p65 contains a 300-amino acid Rel homology domain, which includes a DNA-binding domain, dimerization domain, and the nuclear translocation signal. In order to examine whether the transcriptional activity of NF-κB is disrupted by cleavage of p65, HeLa cells were co-transfected with NF-κB-luciferase reporter plasmid together with wild-type (wt) p65, caspase-3 resistant mutant (p65D97A), and caspase-3-cleaved COOH-terminal fragment of p65 (Δp65), respectively, following which luciferase activity was monitored. NF-κB activity was reduced to half that of control in the Δp65-transfected cells, while a 2-fold increase was observed in cells transfected with p65 or p65D97A (Fig.8 A). This suggests that cleavage of p65 at Asp97 impairs its DNA binding ability, and therefore leads to a reduction in the transcriptional activity of NF-κB. Experiments were subsequently conducted to analyze the effect of p65 cleavage on NA-induced apoptosis. Cells were expressed with different concentrations of p65, p65D97A, and Δp65, together with GFP. NA-induced apoptosis was monitored by counting the number of dead GFP-positive cells after treatment with NA for 12 h (see Fig.8 B). Following exposure of cells to NA, apoptosis was significantly enhanced in Δp65-transfected cells. In contrast, p65 and p65D97A inhibited apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. However, p65D97A was more effective at apoptotic inhibition than wild-type p65, suggesting the requirement of intact p65 for the inhibition of apoptosis. We conclude from the data that NA induces caspase-3-mediated cleavage of p65, leading to the disruption of anti-apoptotic function of NF-κB, and consequently to cell death. The molecular mechanism linked to NA-induced activation of caspase-3 was further investigated in this study. Caspase-3 is activated by two main pathways. Ligation of Fas ligand (FasL) to Fas activates caspase-8, which in turn cleaves and activates other caspases including caspase-3 (23Nunez G. Benedict M.A. Hu Y. Inohara N. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3237-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 24Enari M. Talanian R.V. Wong W.W. Nagata S. Nature. 1996; 380: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). The second pathway involves the activation of caspase-3 by caspase-9. Caspase-9 is activated by cytochrome c released from mitochondria in the presence of Apaf-1 and dATP during apoptosis (25Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6239) Google Scholar, 26Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous reports demonstrated that ligation of Fas induces caspase-3-mediated cleavage of p65 at the COOH terminus during apoptosis in Jurkat T cells (13Ravi R. Bedi A. Fuchs E.J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 882-886PubMed Google Scholar). This leads to the query as to whether caspase-3 is activated by an increase in Fas or FasL expression during NA-induced apoptosis (Fig.9 A). No change in the protein levels of Fas and FasL were observed following treatment with NA, indicating that Fas-stimulated caspase-8 signaling pathway is possibly not related to the activation of caspase-3 in our system. This leaves the possibility of the second pathway being preferentially in operation, that caspase-3 is activated through caspase-9. In order to examine this theory, HeLa cells were treated with TNF-α, NA, or a combination of these compounds. Cytosolic fractions of the cells were subjected to Western blot analysis for detection of cytochromec and caspase-9 (Fig. 9 B). Significant amounts of cytochrome c were released into the cytoplasm in NA-treated cells, but not in TNF-α-treated cells. Moreover, caspase-9 and caspase-3 were observed in concurrence with cytochrome crelease. Taken together, these results indicate that NA activates caspase-3 and leads to p65 cleavage via cytochromec/caspase-9 signaling, rather than the Fas/caspase-8 pathway. The transcription factor, NF-κB, is activated by various stimuli, and protects against apoptosis (3Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar, 27Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S.

Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2449) Google Scholar). TNF-α can trigger two different pathways with opposite effects simultaneously, the apoptotic pathway mediated by caspase-8, and survival signaling mediated by NF-κB. It is known that TNF-α does not induce apoptosis unless NF-κB pathway is blocked (29Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5154) Google Scholar). Previous studies have led to the discovery of the activation mechanism of NF-κB upon various apoptotic stimuli (1Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2931) Google Scholar, 2May M.J. Ghosh S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 4Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. McKinsey T.A. Hall S.M. Qi X. Lee W.Y. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell.

However, at present, it is currently unclear how apoptotic pathways overcome survival signaling mediated by NF-κB, and consequently induce cell death. In this article, we investigate whether the anti-apoptotic signaling mediated by NF-κB is inhibited during apoptosis induced by NA. We show that NA triggers apoptotic cell death in HeLa cells and destroys resistance to apoptosis caused by TNF-α. Furthermore, NA inhibits NF-κB activation through caspase-3-mediated cleavage of p65 at the NH2 terminus during apoptosis in HeLa cells. There is ample evidence in earlier literature to illustrate that the activity of NF-κB is inhibited by various drugs via a number of mechanisms. Glucocorticoids inhibit NF-κB activity by increasing levels of IκBα, and consequently sequestering NF-κB in the cytoplasm (9Auphan N. DiDonato J.A. Rosette C. Helmberg A. Karin M. Science. 1995; 270: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2163) Google Scholar). Moreover, NF-κB activation is prevented by anti-inflammatory drugs like sodium salicylate and aspirin (10Kopp E. Ghosh S. Science. 1994; 265: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar), which prevent degradation of IκB by inhibiting the activity of IκB kinase β (IKKβ). Proteosome inhibitors additionally block degradation of IκB (11Griscavage J.M. Wilk S. Ignarro L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3308-3312Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). It was reported that 3-deazaadenosine, which is known to induce apoptosis in human and mouse leukemia cells, inhibits the transcriptional activity of NF-κB through obstruction of p65 phosphorylation without reducing DNA binding activity (12Jeong S.Y. Ahn S.G. Lee J.H. Kim H.S. Kim J.W. Rhim H. Jeong S.W. Kim I.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18981-18988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Our present analyses demonstrate that activation of NF-κB is inhibited by proteolytic cleavage of p65 during NA-induced apoptosis. The cleavage, induced by caspase-3, occurs at a site in the NH2 terminus of the protein. Another recent study showed that ligation of Fas repressed NF-κB activity in Jurkat T cells by inducing proteolytic cleavage of p65 and p50 during apoptosis (13Ravi R. Bedi A. Fuchs E.J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 882-886PubMed Google Scholar). Data presented in this study indicate that p65 cleavage occurs at the COOH terminus, although also mediated by caspase-3. The cleavage at the COOH terminus of p65 was further examined during apoptosis induced by deprivation of growth factor (14Levkau B. Scatena M. Giachelli C.M. Ross R. Raines E.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), where caspase-6 and -7 are available for the COOH-terminal cleavage of p65, as well as caspase-3. Note that our results on the cleavage site of p65 at the NH2 terminus are significantly different from previous reports, although the fact that caspase-3 is responsible for the cleavage is universally established. With a view to explaining the dissimilar findings, we cannot exclude the possibility that another caspase is involved in the cleavage at this site, because the cell lysate had a higher activity of caspase than recombinant caspase-3 on the cleavage of p65 (Fig. 7 C). The identity of these caspases is still somewhat ambiguous. It is difficult to explain why activated caspase-3 targets only the NH2 terminus of p65 during NA-induced apoptosis. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the activation mechanism of caspase-3 or the environment in which caspase-3 targets p65 in our system might be different from that in the other studies conducted so far. It has been demonstrated that caspase-3 activation is regulated by at least two mechanisms. One involves a direct pathway from caspase-8 (23Nunez G. Benedict M.A. Hu Y. Inohara N. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3237-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar,24Enari M. Talanian R.V. Wong W.W. Nagata S. Nature. 1996; 380: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar), and the other is mediated by caspase-9, following the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (25Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6239) Google Scholar, 26Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NA induces apoptosis via cytochrome c release into the cytoplasm and activation of caspase-9 (Fig. 9). However, the expression profiles of Fas and FasL do not change during NA-induced apoptosis, suggesting that caspase-3 is activated by caspase-9 rather than caspase-8. It must therefore be concluded that two caspase-3 activation pathways exist differently that both ultimately lead to the cleavage of p65. One might mediate the NH2-terminal cleavage of p65 in NA-induced apoptosis, while the other mediates the COOH-terminal cleavage of p65 in Fas-induced apoptosis. During analyses on NF-κB transcriptional activity using the p65 mutants, it was noted that the p65 mutant truncated at the NH2 terminus (Δp65) inhibits NF-κB-dependent transcription by half that of the control protein following overexpression (Fig. 8 A). These data can be explained by the functional structure of p65. The NH2terminus of p65 contains a Rel homology domain within which lies a DNA-binding domain, dimerization domain, and nuclear localization signal. Proteolytic cleavage at this site might impair the DNA binding ability of p65, therefore leading to a decrease in the transcriptional activity of NF-κB. Overexpression of the deletion mutant Δp65 significantly increases NA-induced apoptosis, while uncleavable p65 mutant (p65D97A) blocks apoptosis (Fig. 8 B). Several genes induced by NF-κB are known to down-regulate apoptosis, including manganese superoxide dismutase (30Perera C.S. St. Clair D.K. McClain C.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), zinc finger protein A20 (31Opipari Jr., A.W. Hu H.M. Yabkowitz R. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12424-12427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and cellular inhibitor for apoptosis (CIAP) (32Chu Z.L. McKinsey T.A. Liu L. Gentry J.J. Malim M.H. Ballard D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10057-10062Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Thus, the abrogation of transcriptional activity of NF-κB by caspase-3-mediated cleavage of p65 might diminish the anti-apoptotic effect of NF-κB during apoptosis, which in turn explains why cells are more sensitive to apoptosis by NA. In conclusion, we suggest that NA represses NF-κB activity via caspase-3-mediated cleavage of p65, therefore sensitizing cells to apoptosis. Although the apoptotic mechanism of NA is currently unclear, down-regulation of NF-κB activity is evidently one of the active processes in NA-induced apoptosis. Several anticancer agents are less effective in the induction of apoptosis because of their concomitant activation of NF-κB. In this regard, NA might be a promising future candidate for cancer therapy. We thank Dr. Y. K. Jung for generously providing recombinant caspase-1, -3, and -8, and numerous helpful discussions, Dr. I. S. Kim for the human p65 and p50 cDNA, and Dr. J. W.

However, the recently cloned Arabidopsis thaliana isoform At4CL2 is exceptional because it has no appreciable activity with ferulate. On the basis of information obtained from the crystal structure of the phenylalanine-activating domain of gramicidin S-synthetase, 10 amino acid residues were identified that may form the substrate binding pocket of 4CL. Among these amino acids, representing the putative “substrate specificity motif,” only one residue, Met293, was not conserved in At4CL2, compared with At4CL1 and At4CL3, two isoforms using ferulate. Substitution of Met293 or Lys320, another residue of the putative substrate specificity motif, which in the predicted three-dimensional structure is located in close proximity to Met293, by smaller amino acids converted At4CL2 to an enzyme capable of using ferulate. The activity with caffeate was not or only moderately affected. Conversely, substitution of Met293 by bulky aromatic amino acids increased the apparent affinity (K m) for caffeate up to 10-fold, whereas single substitutions of Val294 did not affect substrate use.

During the first step, coumaric acid and ATP form a coumaroyl-adenylate intermediate with the simultaneous release of pyrophosphate. In the second step, the coumaroyl group is transferred to the sulfhydryl group of CoA, and AMP is released (1Knobloch K.-H. Hahlbrock K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 52: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 2Becker-André M. Schulze-Lefert P. Hahlbrock K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8551-8559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite their low overall sequence identity, one highly conserved peptide motif is common to 4CLs, luciferases, fatty acyl-CoA synthetases, acetyl-CoA synthetases, and specialized domains within peptide synthetase multienzymes. This conserved, putative AMP binding domain has been used as the most important criterion to group the above-listed proteins in one superfamily of adenylate-forming enzymes (3Fulda M. Heinz E. Wolter F.P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In good agreement with this theoretical classification and prediction of functional similarity, the mutational analysis of At4CL2 from Arabidopsis thaliana experimentally corroborated such a close functional relationship between 4CL and the adenylation and substrate recognition domains of nonribosomal peptide synthetases (4Stuible H.-P. Büttner D. Ehlting J. Hahlbrock K. Kombrink E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Considerable progress has been made in determining the structural basis of substrate specificity in the peptide synthetase system (5Conti E. Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. Brick P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4174-4183Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 6Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Marahiel M.A. Chem.

The crystal structure of the N-terminal adenylation subunit (phenylalanine-activating domain (PheA)) of gramicidinS-synthetase 1 obtained in the presence of AMP andl-phenylalanine, a substrate structurally related to coumaric acid, allowed both the localization of catalytic important positions and the identification of 10 amino acids lining the phenylalanine binding pocket (5Conti E. Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. Brick P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4174-4183Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). All substrate binding pocket constituents of PheA (except Lys517, which functions as the active site in adenylate formation and is therefore obviously not involved in substrate discrimination) could be identified within a 100-amino acid residue-comprising region, which is flanked by the conserved core motifs A3 and A6 of peptide synthetases (6Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Marahiel M.A. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 493-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar) exhibiting high sequence identity with the Box I(LPFSSGTTGLPKG) andBox II(GEICIRG) sequences of 4CLs, respectively. Using different sequence alignment strategies, the substrate specificity conferring amino acids corresponding to the residues identified in PheA have also been localized in other peptide synthetases (6Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Marahiel M.A. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 493-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar, 8Challis G.L. Ravel J. Townsend C.A. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 211-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). The importance of several of these positions for substrate recognition and specificity has been verified by site-directed mutagenesis (6Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Marahiel M.A. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 493-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). On the basis of these data, the concept of a substrate binding pocket with a limited number of contact residues being involved in substrate specificity determination has been established for several peptide synthetases (6Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Marahiel M.A. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 493-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar, 8Challis G.L. Ravel J. Townsend C.A. Chem.

The position of 4CL at a metabolic branch point connecting general phenylpropanoid metabolism with different end product-specific pathways makes 4CL a promising target for biotechnological manipulation. The suitability of 4CL for product or pathway engineering is not only suggested by its position within the plant secondary metabolism but is additionally supported by recent studies that indicate that 4CL isoforms by virtue of their different substrate specificities and expression patterns channel phenolic precursors either to the lignin or the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway (10Hu W.-J. Kawaoka A. Tsai C.-J. Lung J. Osakabe K. Ebinuma H. Chiang V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5407-5412Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 11Ehlting J. Büttner D. Wang Q. Douglas C.J. Somssich I.E. Kombrink E. Plant J. 1999; 19: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). We recently cloned and biochemically characterized three 4CL isoforms from A. thaliana (11Ehlting J. Büttner D. Wang Q. Douglas C.J. Somssich I.E. Kombrink E. Plant J. 1999; 19: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Although showing differences in detail, all three 4CLs were able to activate their typical substrates, coumarate and caffeate. Unexpected, however, was the observation that only the isoforms At4CL1 and At4CL3 were able to convert ferulate to the corresponding thiol ester, whereas At4CL2 was not (11Ehlting J. Büttner D. Wang Q. Douglas C.J. Somssich I.E. Kombrink E. Plant J. 1999; 19: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Both the minor structural differences existing between caffeate (3,4-dihydroxy cinnamic acid) and ferulate (3-methoxy-4-hydroxy cinnamic acid) and the high sequence identity found between the three At4CL isoforms suggested that only a limited number of amino acid residues are responsible for the inability of At4CL2 to convert ferulate to its thiol ester. Therefore, we decided to study the molecular mechanism preventing ferulate activation by At4CL2 in detail to unravel the principle rules of substrate specificity determination in the 4CL system. Standard DNA techniques were performed as described elsewhere (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1989Google Scholar). For plasmid amplification, theEscherichia coli strain DH5α (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used. Protein expression was performed using the E. colistrain M15(pRP4). The pQE30-based At4CL2 expression plasmid used for mutagenesis experiments has previously been described (11Ehlting J. Büttner D. Wang Q. Douglas C.J. Somssich I.E. Kombrink E. Plant J. 1999; 19: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Point mutations were introduced into At4CL2 by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the entire At4CL2 expression plasmid by using two mutated oligonucleotide primers, each complementary to opposite strands of the vector. Double mutants were created by polymerase chain reaction amplification of already existing At4CL2 mutant plasmids using a new pair of mutated oligonucleotide primers. Conditions for polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis were as follows: 1 cycle at 94 °C (1 min), 16 cycles at 94 °C (1 min), 59 °C (1 min), and 68 °C (14 min), and 1 final polymerization step at 68 °C (14 min). All components necessary for this mutagenesis procedure were included in the commercial QuikChange kit (Stratagene). One primer sequence of each pair of complementary mutagenesis primers is listed in TableI.Table ISequences of PCR primers used for the construction of At4CL2 mutant proteinsPrimer sequence1-aModified codons are underlined.MutationGGTGTAAAGTCACGGTGGCTCCAGTCGTGCCACCGATCGTTTTAGCM293PGGTGTAAAGTCACGGTGGCTGCCGTCGTGCCACCGATCGTTTTAGCM293AGGTGTAAAGTCACGGTGGCTATGATGGTGCCACCGATCGTTTTAGCV294MGGTGTAAAGTCACGGTGGCTATGCTCGTGCCACCGATCGTTTTAGCV294LGGTGTAAAGTCACGGTGGCTTTCGTCGTGCCACCGATCGTTTTAGCM293FGGTGTAAAGTCACGGTGGCTTACGTCGTGCCACCGATCGTTTTAGCM293YGGTGTAAAGTCACGGTGGCTTGGGTCGTGCCACCGATCGTTTTAGCM293WCTGAGCTCGGTTAGGATGGTTCTGTCTGGAGCAGCTCCTCTTGGK320LCTGAGCTCGGTTAGGATGGTTGCGTCTGGAGCAGCTCCTCTTGGK320A1-a Modified codons are underlined. Open table in a new tab The entire DNA sequences of all mutated reading frames were determined on ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencers (Applied Biosystems, Forster City, CA). To identify the putative substrate pocket-lining amino acids of 4CL, sequence alignments were generated with the PILEUP program of the Genetics Computer Group program package, version 10.0, with the gap weight and gap length weight set to 2 and 8, respectively (13Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11514) Google Scholar), using the following sequences (with GenBank accession numbers given in parentheses brackets): A. thaliana At4CL2 (AAD47193), At4CL1 (AAD47191), At4CL3 (AAD47194), Brevibacillus brevisgramicidin S-synthetase 1 (PheA; CAA33603), and other 4CL sequences as listed previously (11Ehlting J. Büttner D. Wang Q. Douglas C.J. Somssich I.E. Kombrink E. Plant J. 1999; 19: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Expression and purification of At4CL2 proteins were performed as recently described (4Stuible H.-P. Büttner D. Ehlting J. Hahlbrock K. Kombrink E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). 4CL activity was determined with the spectrophotometric assay previously described, using caffeic acid and ferulic acid as phenolic substrates (11Ehlting J. Büttner D. Wang Q. Douglas C.J. Somssich I.E. Kombrink E. Plant J. 1999; 19: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 14Knobloch K.-H. Hahlbrock K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 184: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The change of absorbance during CoA ester formation was monitored at 363 nm for caffeoyl-CoA and at 345 nm for feruloyl-CoA (15Stöckigt J. Zenk M.H. Z. Naturforsch. 1975; 30c: 352-358Crossref Scopus (279) Google Scholar). TheK m and V max values for caffeate and ferulate were estimated at fixed concentrations of ATP (5.5 mm) and CoA (0.3 mm) by linear regression of v/s against s (Hanes plot). Since K m and V max values could not be determined for all mutant enzymes because of their low activity, specific activity was determined in addition at standard conditions (0.2 mm phenolic substrate, 5.5 mmATP, 0.3 mm CoA) for all 4CL variants. Protein concentrations were determined according to Bradford (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard. To identify the substrate binding pocket-lining amino acids within the At4CL2 primary sequence, different multiple sequence alignments of the three 4CL isoforms of A. thaliana were performed with several adenylation domains of peptide synthetases, including PheA, luciferases, as well as all other available 4CL sequences (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”). We assumed that the functional relatedness between these three groups of enzymes is also reflected at the structural level, as recently described for PheA and firefly luciferase (5Conti E. Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. Brick P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4174-4183Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 17Conti E. Franks N.P. Brick P. Structure. 1996; 4: 287-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). In good agreement with this presumption, the reduced sequence alignment shown in Fig.1 reveals such structural similarity by the colinear organization of the two highly conserved sequence motifs common to 4CLs (Box I and Box II) and PheA (core motifs A3 and A6) and the length and sequence of the intervening region. Because in PheA all substrate binding pocket constituents are known to be located between the peptide motifs A3 and A6, we predicted that the substrate specificity conferring amino acids of 4CL are located between the putative AMP binding domain (Box I) and the so-called GEICIRG domain (Box II). Furthermore, the unusual features of At4CL2, which activates 3,4-dihydroxy cinnamic acid (caffeate) as its preferred substrate but is incapable of converting 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy cinnamic acid (ferulate) to the corresponding thiol ester, should be reflected in the constituents of the substrate binding pocket in comparison with the ferulate-using enzymes At4CL1 and At4CL3. By extraction of the nine putative substrate binding pocket-forming residues of At4CL1, At4CL2, and At4CL3 from the alignment with PheA, we identified two differences among the three Arabidopsis 4CL “substrate specificity motifs” (Fig. 1). First, the bulky methionine residue at position 293 in At4CL2 is substituted by proline and alanine residues in At4CL1 and At4CL3, respectively (Fig. 1). Because At4CL1 and At4CL3, in contrast to At4CL2, are able to activate ferulate, the observed difference suggested that ferulate use could be regulated by a size exclusion mechanism mediated by the bulkiness of the amino acid at position 293. Second, in At4CL3, position 320 (At4CL2 numbering) is occupied by a leucine, whereas At4CL1 and At4CL2 both carry a lysine in this position (Fig. 1). Although the different amino acid residues at position 320 allowed no obvious explanation of the available biochemical data on substrate use, in particular the missing ferulate activation by At4CL2, we assumed that this position could also be important for determining substrate specificity, because it should be located in close proximity to the other variable amino acid (Met293) if the enzyme has a three-dimensional structure similar to that of PheA. To test whether the bulky methionine residue at position 293 in At4CL2 is responsible for the lack of capacity of the enzyme to activate ferulate, Met293 was replaced by proline or alanine as suggested from the primary sequences of At4CL1 and At4CL3, respectively (Fig. 1). Both mutant enzymes, M293P and M293A, retained their activity with caffeate, and the K mand V max values for this substrate were comparable with those of the wild-type enzyme (TableII). However, as a novel catalytic activity, both mutant enzymes were able to activate ferulate, exhibiting K m values fairly similar to those reported for At4CL1 (199 µm) and At4CL3 (166 µm; Ref. 11Ehlting J. Büttner D. Wang Q. Douglas C.J. Somssich I.E. Kombrink E. Plant J. 1999; 19: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Although the specific activities of these new At4CL2 variants with ferulate were ∼50-fold higher than the residual activity displayed by the wild-type enzyme (2.3 picokatals/mg), caffeate was still the preferred substrate because of the significantly lower K m value (Table II). This is clearly illustrated by calculation of theV max:K m ratios, which for both mutants varied from 8.2 to 8.6 for caffeate and 0.5 to 1.1 for ferulate.Table IIKinetic properties of Arabidopsis 4CL2 mutant enzymesEnzymeCaffeateFerulateK mV maxSA2-aSpecific activity (based on protein), determined under standard conditions with 0.2 mmphenolic substrate.K mV maxSA2-aSpecific activity (based on protein), determined under standard conditions with 0.2 mmphenolic substrate.µmpicokatals/mgpicokatals/mgµmpicokatals/mgpicokatals/mgWild type24 ± 1.5158 ± 9144 ± 8ND2-bND, not determined, activity too low.ND2.3 ± 0.9M293P25 ± 8206 ± 38183 ± 25224 ± 46243 ± 9115 ± 7M293A24 ± 7.5206 ± 46188 ± 41558 ± 45284 ± 3678 ± 14M293P/V294M21 ± 4.6187 ± 44168 ± 42105 ± 27210 ± 37140 ± 40M293A/V294L24 ± 7190 ± 40170 ± 32162 ± 61290 ± 34165 ± 22V294M22 ± 4134 ± 23120 ± 18NDND4.9 ± 1V294L23 ± 4.6114 ± 11104 ± 10NDND3.2 ± 0.6M293F63 ± 17177 ± 63136 ± 41NDND<0.3M293Y224 ± 53176 ± 3088 ± 5NDND<0.1M293W180 ± 4244 ± 1023 ± 6NDND8.6 ± 0.6K320L74 ± 13147 ± 6107 ± 4151 ± 50234 ± 34140 ± 12K320A55 ± 6130 ± 12105 ± 840 ± 2135 ± 15108 ± 7K320L/M293P48 ± 6119 ± 3397 ± 2946 ± 7270 ± 50263 ± 62K320A/M293P84 ± 1963 ± 645 ± 658 ± 592 ± 871 ± 7All values are the mean ± S.D. of at least three independent determinations with affinity-purified protein.2-a Specific activity (based on protein), determined under standard conditions with 0.2 mmphenolic substrate.2-b ND, not determined, activity too low. Open table in a new tab All values are the mean ± S.D. of at least three independent determinations with affinity-purified protein. To test the specificity of the observed mutant phenotype after alteration of amino acid residue 293, we generated a second set of mutants at the neighboring position 294 that is also variable among theArabidopsis 4CLs (Fig. 1). Again, the newly introduced amino acids were selected according to the sequences of At4CL1 and At4CL3. The hereby generated At4CL2 variants, V294M and V294L, exhibited slightly reduced V max values and specific activities with caffeate, whereas no significant activity was observed with ferulate. Thus, despite its close proximity to Met293, the valine at position 294 is apparently not involved in determining substrate specificity in 4CL. However, the results obtained with the double mutants M293P/V294M and M293A/V294L demonstrate that substitutions of Val294 have a modulating influence on ferulate activation when combined with a second mutation, leading to a 2–3-fold decrease of the K m values in comparison with the single mutants M293P and M293A (Table II). Because a size reduction of the amino acid residue at position 293 seemed to be essential for the acceptance of ferulate as a substrate by At4CL2, we postulated that the introduction of bulky aromatic amino acids at this position should not only prevent ferulate (4-hydroxy-3-methoxy cinnamate) activation but should also reduce the efficiency of caffeate (3,4-dihydroxy cinnamate) activation. Therefore, it was no surprise that none of the three At4CL2 mutant enzymes, M293F, M293Y, and M293W, exhibited any significant enzymatic activity with ferulate (Table II). Substitution of Met293 by the smallest aromatic amino acid, phenylalanine, also did not appreciably affect theK m (only 2-fold) and V maxvalues for caffeate, whereas the bulkier amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan had significant effects. The M293Y substitution resulted in a 10-fold increase in the K m value without affectingV max, whereas by the M293W substitution, both parameters were affected, leading to a drastically reduced enzymatic capacity of the mutant enzyme (Table II). Collectively, these results support the model that the bulkiness of the amino acids lining the substrate binding pocket is an important factor determining substrate specificity in the 4CL system. To study a possible contribution of Lys320 on the catalytic properties of At4CL2, we substituted this residue with leucine, as suggested from the sequence comparison (Fig. 1), and with alanine. Compared with the wild-type enzyme, both substitutions, K320L and K320A, resulted in a 2–3-fold increase in the K mfor caffeate use, whereas V max was not affected, although a large, positively charged amino acid was replaced by smaller, aliphatic amino acids (Table II). In addition, both new mutant enzymes exhibited remarkable activity with ferulate, similar to the 4CL variants M293A and M293P (Table II). The properties of the mutant enzyme with the K320L substitution resembled those of the ferulate-activating At4CL2 variants carrying single point mutations at position 293 (Table II). In contrast, the K320A substitution led to a 4-fold decrease in the K m value for ferulate when compared with the K320L mutation, although no alanine was found at this position in any of the available 4CL sequences. The lowK m value (40 µm) in combination with the moderate V max value (135 picokatals/mg) resulted in a relatively highV max:K m ratio of 3.4 for ferulate, thereby slightly exceeding theV max:K m ratio of 2.4 for caffeate. The stronger mutant phenotype obtained with the K320A substitution in comparison with the K320L exchange again indicates that an increase of the available space for the substrate binding pocket allows a higher activity with bulky substrates. To analyze potential additive effects, two enzyme double mutants were created, each carrying ferulate specificity-conferring amino acids at both positions identified to be important (293 and 320). When the K320L/M293P variant and the K320L single mutant were compared with respect to caffeate use, no additive effect of the second mutation was apparent (Table II). However, for ferulate activation, theK m value of the K320L/M293P variant was 3–5-fold lower than the K m values of the corresponding enzymes with single mutations, whereas the V maxvalue was not affected (Table II). The combination of lowK m (46 µm) and highV max (270 picokatals/mg) made ferulate with aV max:K m ratio of 5.9, instead of caffeate with a V max:K mratio of 2.4, the preferred substrate of this new At4CL2 variant. In this case, the introduction of a second mutation had an additive effect and changed the substrate preference of the enzyme from caffeate to ferulate. A more complex situation was observed with the K320A/M293P double mutant, which exhibited K m values for ferulate and caffeate fairly similar to those of the K320A single mutant. In addition, however, the V max values and the specific activities were also clearly reduced for both substrates, and a positive influence of the second mutation on ferulate use was not apparent (Table II). In conclusion, the introduction of small amino acids at either position, 293 or 320, of the At4CL2 primary sequence promoted ferulate activation by this enzyme and generated a new substrate use profile. Together with the occurrence of additive effects of both mutations, as observed with the K320L/M293P double mutant, these results indicate that both substituted amino acid residues represent substrate binding pocket constituents, which are located in close proximity to each other in the three-dimensional structure of the protein and at the same time contact the 3-methoxy or 3-hydroxy groups of ferulate and caffeate, respectively. The results presented in this study demonstrate the possibility of rationally designing 4CL activity by site-directed mutagenesis. The generation of new enzymatic specificities using At4CL2 as a model system represents a first step toward modification of biosynthetic processes located downstream of the general phenylpropanoid metabolism. Starting from the crystal structure of PheA (5Conti E. Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. Brick P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4174-4183Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar), we identified nine amino acid residues in the At4CL2 primary sequence that may line the binding pocket for the phenolic substrate. Because the amino acid sequences of At4CL2 and PheA are only ∼15% identical in the region of ∼100 amino acids that harbors all the substrate binding and specificity-conferring constituents, it has to be emphasized that the assignment of functionally important amino acids in At4CL2 on the basis of sequence alignments is not necessarily correct for each predicted position. The functional relevance has to be verified experimentally for each position, and it may well be that other or additional positions than those deduced from the alignment with PheA are necessary and important for the determination of substrate specificity in the 4CL system. Nevertheless, the strong influence on ferulate and caffeate use exerted by variation of the amino acid residues at positions 293 and 320 in At4CL2 argue strongly in favor of a correct assignment of at least these two positions. The present results strongly suggest that both residues interact directly with the 3-hydroxy or 3-methoxy groups of the phenolic substrates and thus represent two of the amino acids lining the substrate binding pocket. The At4CL2 residues Met293 and Lys320 are likely to correspond to the PheA amino acids Thr278 and Ile299, respectively. In PheA, Thr278 and Ile299 are neighboring residues in the three-dimensional structure, both of which are located at the same side of the phenylalanine binding pocket (5Conti E. Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. Brick P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4174-4183Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). By comparing the nine substrate specificity-conferring amino acids of several peptide synthetases, five highly variable residues were identified, including Thr278and Ile299 in PheA. The high variability of these substrate binding pocket constituents was suggested to reflect their importance for determining substrate specificity (6Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Marahiel M.A. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 493-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). In accordance with this predicted importance, substitution of Thr278 by the larger methionine residue resulted in a 20-fold decrease in the use of the miscognate and bulkier substrate tryptophan compared with the cognate substrate phenylalanine. This observation indicated that the reduction of the available space within the substrate binding pocket was responsible for the increase in substrate specificity (6Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Marahiel M.A. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 493-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). The deduced colocalization of At4CL2 Met293 and Lys320 in the corresponding region of the substrate binding pocket is in good agreement with our experimental results. Substitution of either residue by a smaller amino acid renders the At4CL2 substrate binding pocket accessible to ferulate (Table II). Correspondingly, introduction of bulky aromatic amino acids at position 293 of At4CL2 resulted in a 10-fold increase of the K m value for caffeate (TableII). The data obtained from the peptide synthetase system indicate that the knowledge of specificity-conferring amino acids allows more precise predictions of substrate use by newly discovered adenylation domains before their biochemical characterization than would be possible by overall sequence comparison with functionally characterized enzymes (6Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Marahiel M.A. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 493-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar,8Challis G.L. Ravel J. Townsend C.A. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 211-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Predictions of substrate use and specificity are also desirable for the 4CL system, particularly in view of the extensive genome sequences that are presently becoming available. For example, although experimental evidence suggests that Arabidopsis contains only three bona fide 4CLs (11Ehlting J. Büttner D. Wang Q. Douglas C.J. Somssich I.E. Kombrink E. Plant J. 1999; 19: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), several new 4CL-like sequences were recently identified (accession numbers AC011000,AL132967, AL161502, and AL161549) for which a function has not yet been assigned. Despite the observed overall sequence similarity, 4CL activity could not be detected for one of these proteins (AC011000, gene F16P17.9) after heterologous expression in E. coli. 2H.-P.

Unfortunately, a systematic analysis of the parameters specifying substrate recognition and use by different 4CL isoforms has not yet been possible; in fact, it is impeded by the limited amount of available data correlating structural information with biochemical properties. The characterization of 4CL activities has been carried out largely with proteins purified from various plant species and tissues and revealed the existence of 4CL isoforms with considerable variation in substrate specificity, including the rare occurrence of activity toward sinapate (3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxy cinnamate; Refs. 1Knobloch K.-H. Hahlbrock K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 52: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 18Ranjeva R. Boudet A.M. Faggion R.

However, an unambiguous correlation of particular and unusual biochemical properties with a distinct 4CL coding sequence, e.g. by characterization of proteins expressed in E. coli, has been established only for A. thaliana (present work; Ref. 11Ehlting J. Büttner D. Wang Q. Douglas C.J. Somssich I.E. Kombrink E. Plant J. 1999; 19: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) andPopulus tremuloides (10Hu W.-J. Kawaoka A. Tsai C.-J. Lung J. Osakabe K. Ebinuma H. Chiang V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5407-5412Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The Populus protein Pt4CL1 can activate 5-hydroxy ferulate, whereas the isoform Pt4CL2 cannot. By comparison of the Pt4CL1 and Pt4CL2 sequences according to the same criteria as outlined above for the Arabidopsis 4CL system, a total of three amino acid differences can be identified among the nine putative substrate binding pocket constituents. However, a correlation between the bulkiness of these amino acid residues with the reported substrate preference of the Populus enzymes is not obvious, indicating that other factors such as hydrogen bonding, hydrophobicity, or Van der Waals interactions may also influence substrate recognition and use by 4CLs. Experimental evidence in support of the notion that in addition to size exclusion, such other mechanisms contribute to substrate specificity has again been obtained with the peptide synthetase system by Stachelhaus et al. (6Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Marahiel M.A. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 493-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar), who were able to alter the specificity of an adenylation domain from aspartate to asparagine by a single histidine-to-glutamate substitution. There is considerable interest in manipulation of phenylpropanoid metabolism, because phenolic compounds have a wide range of important functions in plants. They serve as structural components (lignin and suberin), protectants against biotic and abiotic stresses (phytoalexins, antioxidants, and UV-absorbing compounds), flower pigments, and signal molecules (21Weisshaar B. Jenkins G.I. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1998; 1: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). More recently, several plant phenolics received considerable attention as health-promoting “nutraceuticals” with antioxidant and anticancer activity (22Dixon R.A. Steele C.L. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 394-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). One approach to alter phenylpropanoid biosynthesis both quantitatively and qualitatively is to increase or reduce the expression of particular genes in transgenic plants (21Weisshaar B. Jenkins G.I. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1998; 1: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis, for example, a reduction in lignin content by 50% was achieved by expression of an At4CL1 antisense construct (23Lee D. Meyer K. Chapple C. Douglas C.J. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1985-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), and in tobacco a similar approach resulted in an 80% reduction in lignin content (24Kajita S. Hishiyama S. Tomimura Y. Katayama Y. Omori S. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 871-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In both cases the lignin subunit composition was also drastically altered, which may reflect an eminent disadvantage of the antisense approach, namely that several members of a gene family may be affected in a differential and unpredictable manner. In addition, even though specific inhibition of one particular 4CL isoform may result in a desirable reduction in lignin content in one particular organ or cell type, it may also affect other biosynthetic pathways, such as flavonoid formation, in others, with all the potential detrimental effects. The partial lack of protective flavonoid derivatives may, for example, enhance susceptibility to pathogen infection or to damage by UV light exposure (25Landry L.G. Chapple C.C.S. Last R.L. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). A more promising approach for manipulation of phenylpropanoid metabolism in a positive manner using the branch point position of 4CL may require modified structural genes encoding enzymes with clearly defined substrate specificities in combination with selectively altered promoter elements providing organ-, cell type-, and stimulus-specific expression. Correspondingly, the engineering of 4CL variants with enhanced capacity to activate the lignin precursor sinapate or the putative salicylate precursor cinnamic acid would be of great interest for both scientific as well as practical purposes. In conclusion, the data obtained in this study substantiate our prediction that, for its high-level expression, stability as active enzyme, which retains its structural integrity despite extensive mutational alterations, and simple functional analysis in an optical enzyme assay, At4CL2 represents a well suited model system to study the structural basis of substrate specificity in a subclass of adenylate-forming enzymes (4Stuible H.-P. Büttner D. Ehlting J. Hahlbrock K. Kombrink E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To overcome the still-existing limitations, especially the lack of a three-dimensional structural model, both the crystallization of the enzyme and further mutational analyses of At4CL2 have been initiated.

In heart failure, myofilaments response to Ca2+ are often altered and compounds that sensitize the myofilaments to Ca2+possess therapeutic value in this syndrome.

In the syndrome of heart failure, there is strong evidence that the amount of Ca2+ available for contraction is depressed as is the maximum force generating capability of the myofilaments (for reviews, see Refs. 1Endoh M. Gen. Pharmacol. 1995; 26: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 2Varro A. Papp J.G. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1995; 26: S32-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Nielsen-Kudsk J.E. Aldershvile J. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1995; 26: S77-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Treating this condition by elevating intracellular Ca2+ has the potential threat of inducing arrhythmias. In contrast, the ability to sensitize cardiac muscle to Ca2+ and increase cardiac contractility has the considerable advantage of increasing tension with little or no change in intracellular Ca2+ and thus no increase in the energy required to release and transport Ca2+ (for a review, see Ref. 1Endoh M. Gen. Pharmacol. 1995; 26: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A logical target for such Ca2+sensitizing drugs is cardiac troponin C (cTnC)1 due to its role as the Ca2+ binding receptor on the thin filament of cardiac muscle.cTnC is a member of the EF-hand family of Ca2+-binding proteins. Its structure represents a dumbbell with the N- and C-domains connected by a flexible linker in solution (4Sia S.K. Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Gagné S.M. Liu W. Putkey J.A. Sykes B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18216-18221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Both domains contain a core of hydrophobic residues. Once exposed, these hydrophobic residues are essential for the binding of cTnI to cTnC and transmitting the Ca2+ signal to other proteins in the thin filaments, and ultimately signal the activation of the myosin-actin ATPase reaction (for reviews, see Refs. 5Perry S.V. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 190: 9-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 6Filatov V.L. Katrukha A.G. Bulargina T.V. Gusev N.B. Biochemistry (Mosc). 1999; 64: 969-985PubMed Google Scholar). Structural studies have shown that the apo N-domain of cTnC (cNTnC) adopts a “closed” conformation with most of its hydrophobic residues buried (7Spyracopoulos L. Li M.X. Sia S.K. Gagné S.M. Chandra M. Solaro R.J. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12138-12146Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), like the apo N-domain of sTnC (sNTnC) (8Herzberg O. James M.N.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 761-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 9Gagné S.M. Tsuda S. Li M.X. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). However, the binding of Ca2+ has strikingly different structural consequences in cNTnC and sNTnC. In sTnC, the N-domain switches from a closed to an “open” conformation upon binding Ca2+ (9Gagné S.M. Tsuda S. Li M.X. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), while the N-domain of cTnC remains in a closed state in the Ca2+ bound state (7Spyracopoulos L. Li M.X. Sia S.K. Gagné S.M. Chandra M. Solaro R.J. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12138-12146Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Consequently, a large hydrophobic surface is exposed in the Ca2+-saturated sNTnC, but not in the Ca2+-saturated cNTnC. This is mainly due to the fact that sNTnC contains two functional Ca2+-binding sites, while cNTnC contains only one (10van Eerd J.P. Takahashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 64: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar).The exposed hydrophobic surface on the Ca2+-saturated sNTnC has been shown as the sTnI-binding site (11Herzberg O. Moult J. James M.N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2638-2644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Tripet B.P. Van Eyk J.E. Hodges R.S. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12419-12430Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although Ca2+ binding to cNTnC induces little structural changes, it sets the stage for cTnI binding. In the end, both cNTnC and sNTnC adopt similar conformations in binding their respective TnI regions. Specifically, sTnI115–131 was found to bind to the hydrophobic cleft of Ca2+-saturated sNTnC (13McKay R.T. Tripet B.P. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28494-28500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and the corresponding cTnI147–163 also interacts with the hydrophobic cleft of Ca2+-saturated cNTnC and stabilizes the opening conformation of cNTnC (15Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). This region of TnI has been identified by many biological and biophysical studies to be the region responsible for binding to the regulatory domain of TnC and this interaction modulates the binding of the N-terminal and inhibitory regions of TnI to the C-domain of TnC (for reviews, see Refs. 16Farah C.S. Reinach F.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar and17Solaro R.J. Rarick H.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar).Unlike the apo N-terminal domain, the apo C-terminal domain in both sTnC and cTnC possesses a largely unstructured state. Upon binding two Ca2+ ions, this domain folds into a compact globular structure (18Gasmi-Seabrook G.M. Howarth J.W. Finley N. Abusamhadneh E. Gaponenko V. Brito R.M. Solaro R.J. Rosevear P.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8313-8322Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 19Mercier P. Li M.X. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2902-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and exhibits a similar but slightly less open conformation as that of the Ca2+-saturated sNTnC. Two regions of TnI have been shown to interact with the Ca2+-bound C-domain (12Tripet B.P. Van Eyk J.E. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 728-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). These include the inhibitory region corresponding to sTnI96-115 or cTnI128–147, and the N-terminal region corresponding to sTnI1–40 or cTnI34–71. The inhibitory region is the critical functional region in the interaction of TnI with TnC and its movement from TnC to actin-tropomyosin is believed to be the major switch between muscle contraction and relaxation, while the N-terminal region plays primarily a structural role (12Tripet B.P. Van Eyk J.E. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 728-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). NMR studies of the inhibitory peptides have yielded some structural information on the interaction of inhibitory region with TnC (20Campbell A.P. Sykes B.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 405-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 21Campbell A.P. Van Eyk J.E. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1160: 35-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 22Hernandez G. Blumenthal D.K. Kennedy M.A. Unkefer C.J. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6911-6917Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), however, the exact binding sites for the inhibitory region on TnC has been under debate. The crystal structure of sTnC in complex with sTnI1–47 has shown that sTnI3–33 forms a long α-helix and binds to the hydrophobic groove of sCTnC (23Vassylyev D.G. Takeda S. Wakatsuki S. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4847-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The corresponding region of cTnI33–80 has also been shown to bind within the hydrophobic patch of cCTnC (18Gasmi-Seabrook G.M. Howarth J.W. Finley N. Abusamhadneh E. Gaponenko V. Brito R.M. Solaro R.J. Rosevear P.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8313-8322Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).In view of the importance of the exposed hydrophobic surfaces on both domains of cTnC for the binding of cTnI, it is clear that one way to enhance the Ca2+ sensitivity of cardiac muscle would be to stabilize the interaction of cTnC and cTnI by amplifying the hydrophobic cTnI-binding interface on cTnC. This can be accomplished by employing certain pharmacological agents that bind to the hydrophobic cleft but do not interfere with cTnC-cTnI interaction. Indeed, a variety of small hydrophobic compounds including the calmodulin antagonists bepridil, trifluoperazine, and calmidazolium have been shown to increase the Ca2+ sensitivity of cardiac muscle preparations (for a review, see Ref. 1Endoh M. Gen. Pharmacol. 1995; 26: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, most of these compounds are not good Ca2+ sensitizers due to other undesired properties. This led to a search for new generations of Ca2+ sensitizing compounds, among which is the thiadiazinone derivative EMD 57033 (24Ventura C. Miller R. Wolf H.P. Beier N. Jonas R. Klockow M. Lues I.

Pharmacol. 1993; 21: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This drug has been found to increase the Ca2+ sensitivity of both myofibrillar ATPase and force development by skinned muscle fibers (26Lues I. Beier N. Jonas R. Klockow M. Haeusler G. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1993; 21: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 27Solaro R.J. Gambassi G. Warshaw D.M. Keller M.R. Spurgeon H.A. Beier N. Lakatta E.G. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 981-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Recentin vivo studies have also demonstrated that EMD 57033 enhances cardiac contractile function without affecting Ca2+ homeostasis (28Haeusler G. Jonas R. Minck K.O. Schliep H.J. Schelling P.

Pharmacol. 2001; 37: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The myofibrillar Ca2+ sensitizing effects of EMD 57033 are remarkably stereo-specific. EMD 57033 is the (+)-enantiomer of a racemate. The (−)-enantiomer, EMD 57439, exhibits no Ca2+ sensitizing activity but acts as a pure phosphodiesterase III inhibitor (26Lues I. Beier N. Jonas R. Klockow M. Haeusler G. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1993; 21: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar,27Solaro R.J. Gambassi G. Warshaw D.M. Keller M.R. Spurgeon H.A. Beier N. Lakatta E.G. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 981-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism underlining the Ca2+sensitizing effects of EMD 57033 is not well understood. It is possible that the compound interacts directly with cTnC and increases its affinity for Ca2+. It is also possible that it exerts an effect on the interface of myosin-actin. An earlier fluorescence study has demonstrated that EMD 57033 interacts with isolated cTnC in a Ca2+-dependent and stereoselective manner (33Pan B.-S. Johnson J., R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 817-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A NMR study has shown that EMD 57033 induces chemical shift changes of Met methyl groups in the C-domain of cTnC (34Kleerekoper Q. Putkey J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23932-23939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Using NMR chemical shift mapping, we have demonstrated that the EMD 57033-binding site is in the hydrophobic pocket of the C-domain of cTnC and that this drug does not interfere with the binding of the inhibitory region of cTnI to cTnC (35Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Beier N. Putkey J.A. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8782-8790Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that EMD 57033 may exert its positive inotropic effect by binding to the structural domain of cTnC, modulating the interaction between cTnC and other thin filament proteins, rather than directly enhancing Ca2+ binding to the regulatory domain of cTnC.In order to delineate the molecular basis of the interaction between cTnC and EMD 57033, we have determined the NMR solution structure of the 1:1 complex between the Ca2+-saturated C-domain of human cTnC and EMD 57033. In the present structure, the drug molecule is oriented such that the chiral group of EMD 57033 fits deep in the hydrophobic pocket and makes several key contacts with the protein. This stereospecific interaction explains why the (−)-enantiomer of EMD 57033 is inactive. This structure provides a structural basis for the Ca2+ sensitizing effect of EMD 57033. We also examined the possible competition of the drug with cTnI peptides and found that the drug does not share the common binding epitope with the inhibitory region of cTnI but is displaced completely by the N-terminal region of cTnI. These results have important implications in understanding the mechanism underlining Ca2+ sensitizing effects of EMD 57033 in cardiac muscle contraction. In order to function properly, heart muscle must respond efficiently to the transient increases in cytosolic Ca2+levels in the myocardial cell. In the syndrome of heart failure, there is strong evidence that the amount of Ca2+ available for contraction is depressed as is the maximum force generating capability of the myofilaments (for reviews, see Refs. 1Endoh M. Gen. Pharmacol. 1995; 26: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 2Varro A. Papp J.G. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1995; 26: S32-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Nielsen-Kudsk J.E.

Biol. 1988; 203: 761-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 9Gagné S.M. Tsuda S. Li M.X. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). However, the binding of Ca2+ has strikingly different structural consequences in cNTnC and sNTnC. In sTnC, the N-domain switches from a closed to an “open” conformation upon binding Ca2+ (9Gagné S.M. Tsuda S. Li M.X. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), while the N-domain of cTnC remains in a closed state in the Ca2+ bound state (7Spyracopoulos L. Li M.X. Sia S.K. Gagné S.M. Chandra M. Solaro R.J. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12138-12146Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Consequently, a large hydrophobic surface is exposed in the Ca2+-saturated sNTnC, but not in the Ca2+-saturated cNTnC. This is mainly due to the fact that sNTnC contains two functional Ca2+-binding sites, while cNTnC contains only one (10van Eerd J.P. Takahashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 64: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The exposed hydrophobic surface on the Ca2+-saturated sNTnC has been shown as the sTnI-binding site (11Herzberg O. Moult J. James M.N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2638-2644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Tripet B.P. Van Eyk J.E. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 728-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 13McKay R.T. Tripet B.P. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12419-12430Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although Ca2+ binding to cNTnC induces little structural changes, it sets the stage for cTnI binding. In the end, both cNTnC and sNTnC adopt similar conformations in binding their respective TnI regions. Specifically, sTnI115–131 was found to bind to the hydrophobic cleft of Ca2+-saturated sNTnC (13McKay R.T. Tripet B.P. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28494-28500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and the corresponding cTnI147–163 also interacts with the hydrophobic cleft of Ca2+-saturated cNTnC and stabilizes the opening conformation of cNTnC (15Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). This region of TnI has been identified by many biological and biophysical studies to be the region responsible for binding to the regulatory domain of TnC and this interaction modulates the binding of the N-terminal and inhibitory regions of TnI to the C-domain of TnC (for reviews, see Refs. 16Farah C.S. Reinach F.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar and17Solaro R.J. Rarick H.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Unlike the apo N-terminal domain, the apo C-terminal domain in both sTnC and cTnC possesses a largely unstructured state. Upon binding two Ca2+ ions, this domain folds into a compact globular structure (18Gasmi-Seabrook G.M. Howarth J.W. Finley N. Abusamhadneh E. Gaponenko V. Brito R.M. Solaro R.J. Rosevear P.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8313-8322Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 19Mercier P. Li M.X. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2902-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and exhibits a similar but slightly less open conformation as that of the Ca2+-saturated sNTnC. Two regions of TnI have been shown to interact with the Ca2+-bound C-domain (12Tripet B.P. Van Eyk J.E. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 728-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). These include the inhibitory region corresponding to sTnI96-115 or cTnI128–147, and the N-terminal region corresponding to sTnI1–40 or cTnI34–71. The inhibitory region is the critical functional region in the interaction of TnI with TnC and its movement from TnC to actin-tropomyosin is believed to be the major switch between muscle contraction and relaxation, while the N-terminal region plays primarily a structural role (12Tripet B.P. Van Eyk J.E. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 728-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). NMR studies of the inhibitory peptides have yielded some structural information on the interaction of inhibitory region with TnC (20Campbell A.P. Sykes B.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 405-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 21Campbell A.P. Van Eyk J.E. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1160: 35-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 22Hernandez G. Blumenthal D.K. Kennedy M.A. Unkefer C.J. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6911-6917Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), however, the exact binding sites for the inhibitory region on TnC has been under debate. The crystal structure of sTnC in complex with sTnI1–47 has shown that sTnI3–33 forms a long α-helix and binds to the hydrophobic groove of sCTnC (23Vassylyev D.G. Takeda S. Wakatsuki S. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4847-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The corresponding region of cTnI33–80 has also been shown to bind within the hydrophobic patch of cCTnC (18Gasmi-Seabrook G.M. Howarth J.W. Finley N. Abusamhadneh E. Gaponenko V. Brito R.M. Solaro R.J. Rosevear P.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8313-8322Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In view of the importance of the exposed hydrophobic surfaces on both domains of cTnC for the binding of cTnI, it is clear that one way to enhance the Ca2+ sensitivity of cardiac muscle would be to stabilize the interaction of cTnC and cTnI by amplifying the hydrophobic cTnI-binding interface on cTnC. This can be accomplished by employing certain pharmacological agents that bind to the hydrophobic cleft but do not interfere with cTnC-cTnI interaction. Indeed, a variety of small hydrophobic compounds including the calmodulin antagonists bepridil, trifluoperazine, and calmidazolium have been shown to increase the Ca2+ sensitivity of cardiac muscle preparations (for a review, see Ref. 1Endoh M. Gen. Pharmacol. 1995; 26: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, most of these compounds are not good Ca2+ sensitizers due to other undesired properties. This led to a search for new generations of Ca2+ sensitizing compounds, among which is the thiadiazinone derivative EMD 57033 (24Ventura C. Miller R. Wolf H.P. Beier N. Jonas R. Klockow M. Lues I. Hano O. Spurgeon H.A. Lakatta E.G. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 1081-1090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Gross T. Lues I. Daut J. J. Mol. Cell.

Pharmacol. 1993; 21: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This drug has been found to increase the Ca2+ sensitivity of both myofibrillar ATPase and force development by skinned muscle fibers (26Lues I. Beier N. Jonas R. Klockow M. Haeusler G. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1993; 21: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 27Solaro R.J. Gambassi G. Warshaw D.M. Keller M.R. Spurgeon H.A. Beier N. Lakatta E.G. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 981-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Recentin vivo studies have also demonstrated that EMD 57033 enhances cardiac contractile function without affecting Ca2+ homeostasis (28Haeusler G. Jonas R. Minck K.O. Schliep H.J. Schelling P. Weygandt H. Lues I. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1997; 29: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 29Senzaki H. Isoda T. Paolocci N. Ekelund U. Hare J.M. Kass D.A.

Pharmacol. 2001; 37: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The myofibrillar Ca2+ sensitizing effects of EMD 57033 are remarkably stereo-specific. EMD 57033 is the (+)-enantiomer of a racemate. The (−)-enantiomer, EMD 57439, exhibits no Ca2+ sensitizing activity but acts as a pure phosphodiesterase III inhibitor (26Lues I. Beier N. Jonas R. Klockow M. Haeusler G. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1993; 21: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar,27Solaro R.J. Gambassi G. Warshaw D.M. Keller M.R. Spurgeon H.A. Beier N. Lakatta E.G. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 981-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism underlining the Ca2+sensitizing effects of EMD 57033 is not well understood. It is possible that the compound interacts directly with cTnC and increases its affinity for Ca2+. It is also possible that it exerts an effect on the interface of myosin-actin. An earlier fluorescence study has demonstrated that EMD 57033 interacts with isolated cTnC in a Ca2+-dependent and stereoselective manner (33Pan B.-S. Johnson J., R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 817-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A NMR study has shown that EMD 57033 induces chemical shift changes of Met methyl groups in the C-domain of cTnC (34Kleerekoper Q. Putkey J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23932-23939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Using NMR chemical shift mapping, we have demonstrated that the EMD 57033-binding site is in the hydrophobic pocket of the C-domain of cTnC and that this drug does not interfere with the binding of the inhibitory region of cTnI to cTnC (35Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Beier N. Putkey J.A. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8782-8790Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that EMD 57033 may exert its positive inotropic effect by binding to the structural domain of cTnC, modulating the interaction between cTnC and other thin filament proteins, rather than directly enhancing Ca2+ binding to the regulatory domain of cTnC. In order to delineate the molecular basis of the interaction between cTnC and EMD 57033, we have determined the NMR solution structure of the 1:1 complex between the Ca2+-saturated C-domain of human cTnC and EMD 57033. In the present structure, the drug molecule is oriented such that the chiral group of EMD 57033 fits deep in the hydrophobic pocket and makes several key contacts with the protein. This stereospecific interaction explains why the (−)-enantiomer of EMD 57033 is inactive. This structure provides a structural basis for the Ca2+ sensitizing effect of EMD 57033. We also examined the possible competition of the drug with cTnI peptides and found that the drug does not share the common binding epitope with the inhibitory region of cTnI but is displaced completely by the N-terminal region of cTnI. These results have important implications in understanding the mechanism underlining Ca2+ sensitizing effects of EMD 57033 in cardiac muscle contraction. We are indebted to Pascal Mercier for tremendous help with the NMRView program and Dr. Carolyn Slupsky for constructing the structure and parameter files of EMD 57033.

https://openalex.org/W1982565891,"Specific type I receptors for pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) are present in gonadotrope cells of the anterior pituitary gland. By transient transfection of mouse gonadotrope-derived αT3-1 cells, which are direct targets for PACAP and express gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRH-R), a marker of the gonadotrope lineage, we provide the first evidence that PACAP stimulates rat GnRH-R gene promoter activity. The EC50 of this stimulation is compatible with a mediation via activation of the cyclic AMP-dependent signaling pathway and, consistently, co-transfection of an expression vector expressing the protein kinase A inhibitor causes reduction in PACAP as well as cholera toxin-stimulated promoter activity. Deletion and mutational analyses indicate that PACAP activation necessitates a bipartite response element that consists of a first region (−272/−237) termed PACAP response element (PARE) I that includes a steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1)-binding site and a second region (−136/−101) referred to as PARE II that contains an imperfect cyclic AMP response element. Gel shift experiments indicate the specific binding of the SF-1 and a potential SF-1-interacting factor to PARE I while a protein immunologically related to the cyclic AMP response element-binding protein interacts with PARE II. These findings suggest that PACAP might regulate the GnRH-R gene at the transcriptional level, providing novel insights into the regulation of pituitary-specific genes by hypothalamic hypophysiotropic signals.

The pituitary gonadotropins then enter the systemic circulation to regulate gonadal function, including steroid hormone synthesis and gametogenesis. The responsiveness of gonadotrope cells to GnRH1 is dependent on the number of cell surface GnRH-R, and changes in the number of these receptors often correlate with changes in the level of receptor mRNA (1Kaiser U.B. Jakubowiak A. Steinberger A. Chin W.W. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 931-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 2Bauer-Dantoin A.C. Hollenberg A.N. Jameson J.L.

Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2803-2808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate this issue at the transcriptional level, namely the tissue-specific and regulated expression of the GnRH-R gene, the promoter regions of the mouse, rat, human, and ovine genes have been isolated and characterized (4Albarracin C.T. Kaiser U.B. Chin W.W. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2300-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 5Clay C.M. Nelson S.E. Digregorio G.B. Campion C.E. Wiedemann A.L. Nett R.J.

Endocrinol. 1998; 144: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Transient transfection assays in the mouse gonadotrope-derived αT3-1 cell line have provided evidence that gonadotrope-specific activity of the mouse promoter is mediated by a tripartite basal enhancer that includes an SF-1-binding site, a consensus AP-1 element, and a novel element termed GnRH-R-activating sequence (GRAS) (9Duval D.L. Nelson S.E. Clay C.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1814-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Similarly, the interaction of SF-1 with a gonadotrope-specific element motif in the human gene has been shown to mediate gonadotrope-specific expression (10Ngan E.S. Cheng P.K. Leung P.C. Chow B.K. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2452-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Regarding the rat promoter, we and others have reported that full gonadotrope specific activity required a distal regulatory domain in addition to the SF-1 and AP-1 elements present in the proximal domain (7Reinhart J. Xiao S. Arora K.K. Catt K.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 130: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 8Pincas H. Forraı̈ Z. Chauvin S. Laverrière J.N. Counis R. Mol. Cell.

Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 319-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We have found that the basal expression of the GnRH-R gene in the gonadotrope-derived αT3-1 cell line is highly dependent on a distal enhancer that is active in the context of the GnRH-R gene promoter only and therefore is termed GnRH receptor-specific enhancer. We have shown that GnRH receptor-specific enhancer activity (−1135/−753) was mediated through a functional interaction with a proximal region (−275/−226) that included the SF-1-binding site (11Pincas H. Amoyel K. Counis R. Laverrière J.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 319-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, the availability of these promoters has allowed the study of the hormonal regulation of the GnRH-R gene and led to the conclusion that some of the elements involved in constitutive expression were also implicated in hormonal regulation. The GRAS element was indeed demonstrated to be involved in the autocrine/paracrine stimulation of the mouse GnRH-R promoter by activin (12Duval D.L. Ellsworth B.S. Clay C.M. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1949-1952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, two reports based on deletion and/or mutational analysis and functional transfection studies, as well as electrophoretic mobility shift assays, have revealed the involvement of the AP-1 element in the mechanism of the homologous regulation of the mouse GnRH-R gene by GnRH in αT3-1 cells (13Norwitz E.R. Cardona G.R. Jeong K.H. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 867-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 14White B.R. Duval D.L. Mulvaney J.M. Roberson M.S. Clay C.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 566-577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An auxiliary element localized 10 bp upstream was found to be necessary for optimal activation by GnRH (13Norwitz E.R. Cardona G.R. Jeong K.H. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 867-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These elements interact with members of the Fos/Jun heterodimer superfamily in agreement with PKC dependence of GnRH-R response to GnRH (13Norwitz E.R. Cardona G.R. Jeong K.H. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 867-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 14White B.R. Duval D.L. Mulvaney J.M. Roberson M.S. Clay C.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 566-577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the probable implication of a mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in this regulation (14White B.R. Duval D.L. Mulvaney J.M. Roberson M.S. Clay C.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 566-577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the homologous, PKC-mediated desensitization of the human GnRH-R promoter activity in αT3-1 cells has been shown to involve a different AP-1 motif located in the distal part of the promoter (15Cheng K.W. Ngan E.S. Kang S.K. Chow B.K. Leung P.C. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3611-3622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Much less is known regarding the regulation of the GnRH-R promoter activity by the PKA-dependent pathway. Using transient transfection in the somatolactotrope GGH3 cell line stably expressing the GnRH-R gene, the mouse GnRH-R gene was found to be responsive to cAMP (16Lin X. Conn P.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3896-3902Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Similarly, treatment of αT3-1 cells with forskolin or a cAMP analog significantly increased luciferase activity of the transfected rat GnRH-R promoter (7Reinhart J. Xiao S. Arora K.K. Catt K.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 130: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These data led us to examine the regulation of the rat GnRH-R gene transcription by cAMP as well as by a physiological activator of the cAMP-dependent signaling pathway, the pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP). PACAP, a member of the vasoactive intestinal polypeptide/secretin/glucagon family of peptides, was isolated from ovine hypothalamic extracts based upon its adenylate cyclase stimulating activity in rat pituitary cells (17Miyata A. Arimura A. Dahl R.R. Minamino N. Uehara A. Jiang L. Culler M.D. Coy D.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1675) Google Scholar). The major form of PACAP is a C-terminal amidated 38-amino acid polypeptide, but a shorter form, PACAP27, corresponding to the N-terminal 27 residues of PACAP38, is also found in the hypothalamus. Two major PACAP receptors have been identified: 1) PAC1 receptors highly specific for PACAP that activate not only adenylate cyclase but also phospholipase C. These receptors have been shown to be expressed in the anterior pituitary, adrenal medulla, hypothalamus, testis, and αT3-1 pituitary cell line (18Schomerus E. Poch A. Bunting R. Mason W.T. McArdle C.A. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). 2) VPAC1 and VPAC2 receptors, which bind both vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and PACAP but activate almost exclusively adenylate cyclase (19Rawlings S.R. Piuz I. Schlegel W. Bockaert J. Journot L. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2088-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 20Harmar A.J. Arimura A. Gozes I. Journot L. Laburthe M. Pisegna J.R.

Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 296-324Google Scholar) and have been found in lung, liver, prostate gland, and seminal vesicles. At the pituitary level, PACAP stimulated the release of luteinizing hormonein vivo (22Osuga Y. Mitsuhashi N. Mizuno M. Endocrinol. Jpn. 1992; 39: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), whereas in vitro in cultured pituitary cells, it weakly stimulated luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone release. Interestingly, it notably enhanced GnRH-induced gonadotropin secretion, thus suggesting intriguing possibilities for this peptide in regulating gonadotropin secretion and reproductive function (23Culler M.D. Paschall C.S. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 2260-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Consistently, PACAP has been shown not only to stimulate glycoprotein hormone α-subunit synthesis and release (24Hart G.R. Gowing H. Burrin J.M. J.

Winters S.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 113: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Recently, Burrin and collaborators (27Burrin J.M. Aylwin S.J. Holdstock J.G. Sahye U. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) have demonstrated using transfection assays in αT3-1 cells that PACAP regulated the expression of the human α-subunit gene at the transcriptional level. In the present study, we examined the effects of PACAP and cAMP on GnRH-R promoter activity using αT3-1 cells. We employed deletion, mutation, and heterologous constructs of the rat GnRH-R promoter to delineate DNA sequences responsive to PACAP and cAMP. Gel shift assays were performed to assess the binding capacity of the putative elements with nuclear factors. We show that both PACAP and cAMP responsiveness of the GnRH-R gene promoter in αT3-1 cells is supported by two distinct proximal regions, one of which includes the SF-1-binding site localized at −245/−237 and is described previously as crucial for tissue-specific expression and the other, an imperfect cAMP response element present at position −110/−103. PACAP, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), and cholera toxin were obtained from Biovalley (Merseyside, UK), Calbiochem (San Diego, CA), and Sigma, respectively. All oligonucleotides were provided by Eurobio (Les Ulis, France) or Genaxis (Montigny-le Bretonneux, France). The series of 5′-deletion mutants termed pCAT1.2, pCAT0.5, and pCAT0.18 GnRH-R, spanning regions −1257/−32, −515/−32, and −180/−32 (all numbering is relative to the translational start site), respectively, have been described previously (8Pincas H. Forraı̈ Z. Chauvin S. Laverrière J.N. Counis R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 144: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A further series of 5′-deletion mutants spanning regions −433/−32, −381/−32, −316/−32, −297/−32, −272/−32, −247/−32, and −222/−32 were generated according to the same protocol using Deep Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Montigny-le Bretonneux, France) with selected sense primers that included an HindIII restriction site to facilitate cloning and the antisense primer −32 Sal, which was complementary to bases −20 to −39. A series of block replacement mutations at 8-bp intervals in the region from −260 to −221 within the pCAT0.27 GnRH-R construct (−272/−32) was generated by PCR amplification using a series of sense/antisense primers (overlapping over 14 bp) designed to place a PstI restriction site with T and C flanking bases at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively (TCTGCAGC). Overlapping fragments were generated from pCAT0.43 GnRH-R (from −433 to −32) as a template in separate PCR reactions using the mutated sense primer and antisense primer −32Sal or the mutated antisense primer and sense primer −433Hind. The amplified products were combined and submitted to a second round of PCR using the −272 Hind and −32Sal primers, and the resulting products were digested withHindIII and SalI, gel-purified, and inserted into the pCAT Basic vector (Promega, Lyon, France) digested with the same enzymes. Because of a superstimulated basal activity of construct −272 Mut D, the PstI site was replaced by a KpnI site (TGGTACCC). To subclone the artificial promoter constructs upstream of the luciferase reporter gene (Promega), the multiple cloning site of the pGL3-Basic vector was altered to provide compatible restriction sites in the appropriate orientation (11Pincas H. Amoyel K. Counis R. Laverrière J.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 319-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A minimal prolactin (PRL) promoter and a single 50-bp module containing the SF-1 element were synthesized as described previously (11Pincas H. Amoyel K. Counis R. Laverrière J.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 319-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The 50-bp module was introduced into the modified pGL3-Basic containing upstream either the minimal PRL promoter or a rat GnRH-R promoter fragment subcloned in place of the minimal PRL promoter (see below). The −136/−32 and the −101/−32 proximal regions of the GnRH-R promoter were generated using selected sense primers −136 Bst and −101 Bst, respectively, and antisense primer −32 Sal. The −56/−32 region was directly obtained by self-annealing two oligonucleotides with an overlap of 27 bp and thus reconstituting a double-stranded DNA, which included BstEII and SalI half-sites at each end for cloning into the BstEII/SalI sites in the modified pGL3-Basic vector. By serially replacing 8-bp segments from position −260 to −237 in the 50-bp module with the PstI restriction site flanked by T and C at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively (TCTGCAGC), three separate mutants were created and ligated upstream of the −136/−32 promoter region in place of the 50-bp module in the modified pGL3-Basic. The series of block replacement mutations eco1 to eco4 scanning the sequence from −136 to −101 in the −136/−32 promoter region were also generated by PCR amplification using a series of sense/antisense overlapping primers designed to place anEcoRI restriction site flanked by a GC at the 3′ end (GAATTCGC). All mutant plasmids were identified by restriction digest of midi-prep DNA and ultimately verified by nucleotide sequencing. The PKI expression vector was prepared by subcloning the rat cDNA encoding PKI into the XbaI/EcoRI site of the pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Leek, The Netherlands) upstream of the CMV promoter. This cDNA was initially cloned from rat pituitary by reverse transcription-PCR and ligated into pUC18 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in our laboratory, 2G. Garrel and R. Counis, unpublished data. whereas an identical rat PKI sequence was simultaneously isolated from the brain by another group (28Van Patten S.M. Howard P. Walsh D.A. Maurer R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2114-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The mouse gonadotrope αT3-1 cells were maintained in monolayer cultures in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Sigma) at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2, 95% air (29Alarid E.T. Windle J.J. Whyte D.B. Mellon P.L. Development. 1996; 122: 3319-3329PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection experiments with CAT or luciferase reporter constructs were carried out using the LipofectAMINE Plus reagent-mediated procedure (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (11Pincas H. Amoyel K. Counis R. Laverrière J.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 319-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Following a 6-h transfection, cells were subjected to appropriate treatment in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. Thereafter, medium was aspirated, and cells were processed as described previously for β-galactosidase and CAT assays (8Pincas H. Forraı̈ Z. Chauvin S. Laverrière J.N. Counis R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 144: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The cells were seeded at 3 × 106cells/100-mm tissue culture dish in triplicate and cultured for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. The culture medium was then replaced by OptiMEM medium, and the cells were cultured for an additional 6 h. The serum-free medium was finally replaced by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and cells were incubated in the presence or the absence of 20 nm PACAP for 16 h. Thereafter, cells were harvested, and nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of Andrews and Faller (30Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). Synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides, designed to contain 5′ protruding ends, were labeled (5 pmol) by filling in the recessed 3′ termini with Klenow fragment from Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I and 50 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol;Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The CRE/PARE II and CREB consensus probes were labeled with 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol;Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a T4 polynucleotide kinase. All probes were then purified on a Sephadex G50 fine column. For binding reactions, nuclear extracts (9 μg) and poly(dI-dC) (1 μg) were incubated in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 300 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 12% (v/v) glycerol) for 15 min at 4 °C. Thereafter, 40,000 cpm DNA probe (approximately 10 fmol) was added with or without an excess of unlabeled competitor, and the incubation was continued for 30 min at 20 °C. In antibody abrogation gel shift assays, nuclear extracts were incubated with either a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against the DNA-binding domain of murine SF-1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), a rabbit polyclonal anti-CREB antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), or an equal concentration of mouse IgG for 1 h at 4 °C prior to the addition of radiolabeled probe. Free probe was separated from bound probe by electrophoresis in 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels that were run at 120 V for 2 h in 1× Tris-borate-EDTA buffer. Gels were then transferred to blotting paper, dried, and subjected to autoradiography for 24–48 h with or without intensifying screens. The data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance. If the F-test was significant, then the means were compared using Tukey-Kramer's method of multiple comparisons. For Figs. 1 C, 5, and 6, the data were logarithmically transformed before proceeding to analysis of variance.Figure 5Two distinct promoter regions, PARE I and PARE II, are required for PACAP-regulated activity of the rat GnRH-R gene. A, promoter fusion constructs were designed, in which a 50-bp module corresponding to the −275/−226 SF-1-containing region was fused to either the rat PRL minimal promoter, or the −136/−32, the −101/−32, or the −56/−32 proximal region of the GnRH-R gene, placed upstream of the luciferase (LUC) reporter. The fusion constructs were transfected into αT3-1 cells as described previously. B, block replacement mutations A, B, and C were introduced into the context of the 50-bp module-(−136/−32)-Luc vector. The major transcription start sites located at positions −110/−107 and −99/−97 (relative to the ATG codon) are indicated by bent arrows. Luciferase activity was corrected for transfection efficiency by normalizing to the activity of TK-Renilla luciferase expression vector and expressed as fold stimulation over pLuc/PRL construct.

The effect of PACAP was compared with that exerted by activators of the PKA- and PKC-dependent pathways, cholera toxin (1 nm) and TPA (25 nm), respectively (Fig.1 B). Both PACAP and cholera toxin stimulated CAT expression of the −1257/−32 construct equivalently, with 2.5 ± 0.5-fold and 2.3 ± 0.1-fold increases over untreated cells, respectively. As a consequence of the presence of the enhancer in the distal part of the promoter, deletion of the sequence extending from −1257 to −515 caused a decrease in basal CAT activity (see the Introduction and Ref.11Pincas H. Amoyel K. Counis R. Laverrière J.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 319-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the resulting construct −515/−32 still displayed an increased response to both PACAP and cholera toxin. A further deletion from −515 to −180 abrogated both PACAP and cholera toxin response, suggesting that response elements for PACAP and cholera toxin were localized within a proximal promoter region extending from −515 to −180. Additional experiments using similar GnRH-R promoter sequences but fused to the luciferase gene reporter gave equivalent results, even following treatments with the adenylate cyclase activator, forskolin, or the permeant cAMP analog, 8-bromo-cAMP. In response to 10 μm forskolin, the luciferase constructs containing either the full-length (−1135/−32) or the enhancerless (−433/−32) promoter were stimulated 2.8 ± 0.3- and 3.5 ± 0.3-fold, respectively, whereas the construct containing the shortest GnRH-R promoter (−180/−32) remained unaffected (data not illustrated). Likewise, 2 mm 8-bromo-cAMP significantly stimulated the luciferase activity of both the full-length and the enhancerless constructs, by 2.0 ± 0.2- and 1.9 ± 0.2-fold, respectively. In contrast, unlike PACAP and activators of the PKA-dependent signaling pathway, TPA had no effect on the expression of any construct (Fig. 1 B). These data are in accordance with a previous report showing that forskolin and cAMP analogs, but not TPA, increased the activity of the rat promoter transfected into αT3-1 (7Reinhart J. Xiao S. Arora K.K. Catt K.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 130: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, these results suggested the involvement of a PKA-mediated pathway for the activation of the GnRH-R promoter by PACAP. To evaluate the specificity of the response of the rat GnRH-R promoter, increasing doses of PACAP ranging from 2 × 10−16 to 2 × 10−7m were tested in αT3-1 cell cultures transfected with the −515 GnRH-R CAT construct (pCAT0.5 GnRH-R) or with the promoterless pCAT Basic vector. As shown in Fig.1 C, PACAP induced a concentration-dependent increase in GnRH-R CAT activity, with a maximal response observed at 2 nm. As expected, the activity of the promoterless vector was not affected by PACAP. More importantly, the EC50 value for stimulation of GnRH-R promoter activity by PACAP (0.2 ± 0.06 nm) was in closer agreement with signaling through the cAMP/PKA cascade (3 nm) than through stimulation of the inositol-phosphate turnover (20 nm) in αT3-1 cells (18Schomerus E. Poch A. Bunting R. Mason W.T. McArdle C.A. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Taken together these findings implied that the stimulatory effect of PACAP on GnRH-R promoter was most probably mediated through coupling of PAC1 receptors to the PKA-dependent signaling pathway. To test this hypothesis, αT3-1 cells were transfected with pCAT0.5 GnRH-R and co-transfected with variable amounts of a vector expressing the rat PKI cDNA under the control of the CMV promoter (pcDNA3PKI). A vector containing only the CMV promoter (pcDNA3) was used as a control (Fig. 1 D). Co-transfected pcDNA3PKI significantly decreased (p < 0.01) basal GnRH-R CAT activity by about 50%. Furthermore, 0.5 μg of pcDNA3PKI markedly reduced (p < 0.001) both cholera toxin- and PACAP-activated GnRH-R CAT activity by 76.5 and 61.4%, respectively, whereas 1 μg led to a maximal inhibition of 84 and 70"

Here, we verify that the NMR solution structure of the third FII repeat (COL-3) is similar to that of the second FII repeat (COL-2); characterize its ligand-binding properties; and derive dynamics properties and relative orientation in solution for the two domains of the COL-23 fragment, a construct comprising COL-2 and COL-3 in tandem, with each domain possessing a putative collagen-binding site. Interaction of the synthetic gelatin-like octadecapeptide (Pro-Pro-Gly)6 (PPG6) with COL-3 is weaker than with COL-2. We found that a synthetic peptide comprising segment 33–42 (peptide 33–42) from the MMP-2 prodomain interacts with COL-3 and, albeit with lower affinity, with COL-2 in a way that mimics PPG6 binding. COL-3 strongly prefers peptide 33–42 over PPG6, which suggests that intramolecular interactions with the prodomain could modulate binding of pro-MMP-2 to its gelatin substrate. In COL-23, the two modules retain their structural individuality and tumble independently. Overall, the NMR data indicate that the relative orientation of the modules in COL-23 is not fixed in solution, that the modules do not interact with one another, and that COL-23 is rather flexible. The binding sites face opposite each other, and their responses to, and normalized affinities for, the longer ligand PPG12 are virtually identical to those of the individual domains for PPG6, thus precluding co- operativity, although they may interact simultaneously with multiple sites of the extracellular matrix.

In its latent form, the prodomain folds over the active-site cleft and contributes a cysteine thiol group, which coordinates the catalytic zinc ion and, as indicated by the recent x-ray crystallographic model (3Morgunova E.

This interaction can be disrupted by proteolysis. Once the active site is free, MMP-2 undergoes autolytic cleavage, resulting in loss of the prodomain (1Yu A.E. Murphy A.N. Stetler-Stevenson W.G.

In addition, several residues that are important for interaction with gelatin have been identified, via site-directed mutagenesis, in the second FII modules from MMP-2 (11Tordai H. Patthy L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and MMP-9 (12Collier I.E. Krasnov P.A. Strongin A.Y. Birkedal-Hansen H. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6776-6781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, little is known as to how tandem arrays of FII domains interact with other molecules. Fragments containing two or three consecutive FII modules from MMP-2 exhibit significantly higher apparent affinities for immobilized gelatin than any of the single modules (5Bányai L. Tordai H. Patthy L. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Modeling studies based on the structures of two FII modules from human fibronectin (13Sticht H. Pickford A.R. Potts J.R. Campbell I.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) as well as a recent NMR study of this pair (14Smith S.P. Hashimoto Y. Pickford A.R. Campbell I.D. Werner J.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8374-8381Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) indicate that the binding sites of two consecutive domains do not get close to each other. This indeed seems to be the case for the three FII domains in pro-MMP-2 (3Morgunova E. Tuuttila A. Bergmann U. Isupov M. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Tryggvason K. Science. 1999; 284: 1667-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). The reported x-ray study of MMP-2 (3Morgunova E. Tuuttila A. Bergmann U. Isupov M. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Tryggvason K. Science. 1999; 284: 1667-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) was performed on the ligand-free protein. Lingering questions are the nature of the interaction of FII domains with collagen-type ligands and whether the interaction of the propeptide with the third FII repeat reflects a specific affinity for the N-terminal domain. The latter is relevant in the context of identifying MMP-2 peptide ligands, as the binding molecule could serve as a template for the design of potential peptidomimetic anticancer drugs. Finally, contrary to the picture one may derive from the rigid crystallographic structure (3Morgunova E. Tuuttila A. Bergmann U. Isupov M. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Tryggvason K. Science. 1999; 284: 1667-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), FII domains are joined by flexible polypeptide linkers; hence, one is led to wonder as to the extent to which these modules act independently when in solution since binding assays indicate that the three modules in tandem possess at least two binding sites that can be occupied simultaneously by two collagen molecules (9Steffensen B.

Boros I. Venetianer P. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 179: 272-277Crossref Google Scholar) and transformed into the E. coli strain JM109. Expression, isolation, and refolding of the recombinant proteins were carried out as described (4Bányai L. Patthy L. FEBS Lett. 1991; 282: 23-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The 34–35-amino acid long N-terminal tails, derived from the β-galactosidase moiety of the expression vector, were partially removed by limited trypsin digestion (15Briknarová K. Grishaev A. Bányai L. Tordai H. Patthy L. Llinás M. Structure. 1999; 7: 1235-1245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The digests were purified on a gelatin-Sepharose 4B column using a 0–8 m urea gradient (5Bányai L. Tordai H. Patthy L. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Finally, the proteins were desalted and lyophilized. Sequence analyses with an ABI 472A Pulsed Liquid Phase Protein Peptide Sequencer were used to determine the N-terminal sequences of the digested proteins. 15N-Labeled proteins, expressed as described elsewhere (15Briknarová K.

The sequences of the truncated recombinant type II modules are shown in Fig. 1. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and amino acid analysis revealed a discrepancy between the expected and actual composition of COL-3 samples, whether unlabeled or 15N-labeled. It was verified by DNA sequencing that the codon for Glu11 (GAA) in the COL-3 expression plasmid changed to GGA (Gly) during plasmid propagation, which was confirmed by the NMR analysis. Fortunately, the effect of the E11G mutation on the overall conformation of COL-3 is negligible: 1H and 15N chemical shifts of the mutated protein and of wild-type COL-3 within the COL-23 construct are virtually identical. NMR data were acquired at 25 °C on a Bruker Avance DMX-500 spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm triple-resonance three-axis gradient probe. Spectra were processed and analyzed with the program Felix 95 (Molecular Simulations, Inc., San Diego, CA) on a Silicon Graphics Indy R-5000 workstation. The base line was corrected with a model-free algorithm developed by Friedrichs (18Friedrichs M.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Proton chemical shifts were referenced using p-dioxane (δ = 3.75 ppm) as an internal standard (19DeMarco A. J. Magn.

Sequential assignments of COL-3 were initially obtained for a sample of 0.5 mm unlabeled COL-3 in 90% H2O and 10% D2O, pH 5.4, based on two-dimensional homonuclear COSY (21Aue W.P. Bartholdi E.

The experiments were recorded with standard pulse sequences and phase cycles (XWIN-NMR Version 2.0, Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany). Solvent suppression in COSY was achieved via selective low power irradiation (presaturation) during the relaxation delay, whereas in TOCSY and NOESY, the WATERGATE scheme (27Piotto M. Saudek V.

COSY, TOCSY (mixing time of 70 ms), and NOESY (mixing time of 120 ms) experiments were also acquired for a sample of 0.5 mm COL-3 in 99.995% D2O, pH* 5.4 (uncorrected pH glass electrode reading).

Cross-peak volumes from two-dimensional NOESY (mixing time of 60 ms), after correction for the WATERGATE excitation profile, were converted to interproton distances with the program Felix 95. To calibrate ther −6 relationship between volumes and distances, well resolved cross-peaks between intraresidual methylene protons were used. Upper and lower distance restraints were generated by adding or subtracting 30% of the calculated distances, respectively. Redundant intraresidual restraints were retained. No restraints were applied to the first 10 or last 5 residues since they yielded only trivial (intraresidual and sequential) NOEs, and the magnetic relaxation data indicated that the corresponding segments are highly flexible. Restraints were introduced to reinforce hydrogen bonds that were detected in the secondary structures of preliminary models and that were supported by characteristic NOE patterns and retarded amide hydrogen-deuterium exchange kinetics. χ1 dihedral angle restraints and stereospecific assignments of β-methylene protons were based on3 J HαHβ estimates from COSY and 3 J NHβ values from cross-peak/diagonal peak intensity ratios in a three-dimensional HNHB spectrum (36Düx P. Whitehead B. Boelens R. Kaptein R. Vuister G.W. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 10: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The individual χ1 rotamers were restrained to −60 ± 30°, 60 ± 30°, and 180 ± 30°, respectively. Clear Hα(i-1) cross-peaks in three-dimensional HNHB, corresponding to3 J NHα(i-1)< −1.2 Hz, indicated that N is trans to Hα(i-1) (36Düx P. Whitehead B. Boelens R. Kaptein R. Vuister G.W. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 10: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and the relevant ψ dihedral angles were confined to −60 ± 60°. 50 structures, comprising residues 1–60, were generated via a standard distance geometry/simulated annealing protocol (39Nilges M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 229: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar, 40Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Brünger A.T. J. Biomol.

Yale University, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar). All structures were retained and further refined in explicit solvent (42Linge J.P. Nilges M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The calculations were performed on a Silicon Graphics Indy R-5000 workstation. The quality of the structures was assessed with the program PROCHECK (Version 3.4.4) (43Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Structural properties were analyzed with the programs X-PLOR and MOLMOL (44Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar). The latter was also used for display and presentation. Peptides (Pro-Pro-Gly)6(PPG6), (Pro-Pro-Gly)12 (PPG12), and acetyl-Pro-Ile-Ile-Lys-Phe-Pro-Gly-Asp-Val-Ala-amide (p33–42) were synthesized on a Model 431A peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems-Perkin Elmer, Foster City, CA) using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. The peptides were weighed and dissolved in H2O, and pH of the solution was adjusted to 7.0. Insoluble material in the PPG12 sample was collected by centrifugation and dissolved in H2O, pH 3.0.1H NMR signal intensity indicated that the stock solution retained ∼90% of all peptide material. Concentrations of COL-2, COL-3, and COL-23 were determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using absorption coefficients calculated according to (45Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3472) Google Scholar). Small aliquots of the peptide stock solution were added to samples of 0.35 mm15N-labeled COL-2, COL-3, or COL-23 in 90% H2O and 10% D2O, pH 7.0.1H-15N HSQC experiment was recorded at each step to monitor the ligand-induced resonance shifts. The equilibrium association constant was determined by a combination of linear and nonlinear least-squares fitting of the chemical shift changes as described previously (46Marti D.N. Hu C.-K.

Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1947-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The peptides were assumed to be monomeric in solution (48Kobayashi Y. Sakai R. Kakiuchi K. Isemura T. Biopolymers. 1970; 9: 415-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). X-NOEs and 15N longitudinal (R 1) and transverse (R 2) relaxation rates were determined from two-dimensional heteronuclear NMR experiments (38Dayie K.T. Wagner G. J. Magn. Reson. 1994; 111: 121-126Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The program Felix 97 (Molecular Simulations, Inc.) was used to measure peak heights, fit relaxation decays, and estimate uncertainties. R 2/R 1relaxation rate ratios were analyzed for each module separately with the program TENSOR (49Dosset P. Hus J.C. Blackledge M. Marion D. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 17: 23-28Crossref Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Only N–HN vectors with well defined orientation in the ensemble of calculated NMR structures and with R 1 and R 2 values that satisfied the criteria outlined in Ref. 50Tjandra N. Wingfield P. Stahl S. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 273-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar were included in the fitting. This comprised data for 29 residues in COL-23/2 and 31 residues in COL-23/3. TENSOR was also used to calculate the moments of inertia for COL-23. Virtually complete 1H and 15N NMR assignments of COL-3 were obtained as reported for COL-2 (15Briknarová K. Grishaev A.

Restraints for 654 interproton distances (140 long-range, 5 ≤ ‖i − j‖; 47 medium-range, 2 ≤ ‖i − j‖ ≤ 4; 120 sequential; and 347 intraresidual), 12 hydrogen bond distances, and 4 ψ and 28 χ1 dihedral angles were derived, as described under “Materials and Methods.” 50 structures were calculated using these restraints (Fig.2 a); statistics for the ensemble are summarized in Table I.

The first loop includes the amino-terminal segment preceding the first disulfide bridge. The second loop links the two β-sheets. The third loop connects the strands of the second β-sheet and contains an α-helical turn (Tyr47–Asp50). The first β-sheet and the loops are arranged around the second β-sheet, thus forming a large cavity filled with aromatic side chains of Phe17, Phe19, Phe21, Tyr26, Trp40, Tyr47, Trp53, and Phe55. An extended hydrophobic surface is formed by Phe21, Tyr26, Trp40, Tyr47, Trp53, and Phe55, whereas Phe19 is buried, and Phe17 faces the opposite side of the module (Fig. 4,a and b). The hydrophobic areas are surrounded by residues with charged side chain groups (Fig. 4, c and d). The Cys15–Cys41 and Cys29–Cys56 disulfide bridges and both the N and C termini are located at the back of the second β-sheet, opposite the aromatic cluster (Fig. 3). NMR (15Briknarová K. Grishaev A.

Consequently, modulation of the local Ca2+gradients influences IP3R excitability as well as the duration and amplitude of the [Ca2+]ioscillations. In the present work, we demonstrate that the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A (CSA) reduces the frequency of IP3-dependent [Ca2+]ioscillations in intact hepatocytes, apparently by altering the local Ca2+ gradients. Permeabilized cell experiments demonstrated that CSA lowers the apparent IP3 sensitivity for Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. These effects on IP3-dependent [Ca2+]isignals could not be attributed to changes in calcineurin activity, altered ryanodine receptor function, or impaired Ca2+fluxes across the plasma membrane. However, CSA enhanced the removal of cytosolic Ca2+ by sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), lowering basal and inter-spike [Ca2+]i. In addition, CSA stimulated a stable rise in the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), presumably by inhibiting the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, and this was associated with increased Ca2+ uptake and retention by the mitochondria during a rise in [Ca2+]i. We suggest that CSA suppresses local Ca2+ feedback by enhancing mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ uptake, these actions of CSA underlie the lower IP3 sensitivity found in permeabilized cells and the impaired IP3-dependent [Ca2+]i signals in intact cells. Thus, CSA binding proteins (cyclophilins) appear to fine tune agonist-induced [Ca2+]i signals, which, in turn, may adjust the output of downstream Ca2+-sensitive pathways.

All immunophilins described to date possesscis-trans-peptidylprolyl isomerase or rotamase activity, which has been implicated in the folding, assembly, and trafficking of target proteins in vivo (1Galat A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 689-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 2Fruman D.A. Burakoff S.J. Bierer B.E. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Thecis-trans-peptidylprolyl isomerase activity is inhibited by low concentrations of immunosuppressants. Based upon binding criteria, immunophilins are divided into two classes: (a) the cyclophilin family that selectively binds cyclosporin A (CSA)1 and (b) the FK-506 binding proteins (FKBP), which bind to FK-506, its analogues, and rapamycin. Although the precise functions of immunophilins and their downstream targets remain to be determined, they have frequently been implicated in regulating a variety of Ca2+-dependent pathways. The best characterized therapeutic action of CSA or FK-506 is the suppression of interleukin-2 gene transcription during antigen-induced T-lymphocyte activation. Specifically, CSA·cyclophilin or FK-506·FKBP complexes are targeted to and inhibit the catalytic activity of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase, calcineurin (4Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D.

Operating in a low conductance mode, the PTP is also proposed to furnish mitochondria with a fast Ca2+-efflux mechanism (i.e. mitochondrial calcium-induced calcium-release) that, in turn, amplifies inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-dependent cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]i) signals (9Ichas F.

FKBP12 forms tight complexes with both ryanodine receptors (RyRs) and IP3 receptors (IP3Rs) that are perturbed by FK-506 or rapamycin (16Brillantes A.B. Ondrias K. Scott A. Kobrinsky E. Ondriasova E.

Dissociation of the FKBP from the channels results in increased Ca2+ fluxes in response to caffeine or IP3 (16Brillantes A.B. Ondrias K. Scott A. Kobrinsky E. Ondriasova E. Moschella M.C.

Moreover, two ubiquitously expressed members of the cyclophilin family, s-cyclophilin and cyclophilin A, colocalize with or bind to the Ca2+storage protein of the ER, calreticulin (20Arber S.

Therefore, this raises the possibility that cyclophilins may modulate Ca2+storage properties of the ER and, indirectly, Ca2+ flux through the RyR and/or IP3R. Taken together, there is a wealth of evidence that immunophilins can potentially activate or inhibit Ca2+-dependent signal transduction by modifying the activity of diverse cellular targets.Periodic oscillations or spikes in [Ca2+]i are utilized by a wide range of extracellular stimuli (22Berridge M.J.

Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 247-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), which may in turn stimulate the influx of external Ca2+ to sustain the agonist signal and refill the internal stores (30Putney Jr., J.W. Bird G.S. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 610-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). In hepatocytes, the agonist dose, which presumably determines the intracellular [IP3], sets the frequency of [Ca2+]i spikes (i.e. frequency modulation). However, the positive feedback effect of [Ca2+]i on IP3R generates the rapid-rising phase of the [Ca2+]i spike, which is essentially independent of the agonist dose. This Ca2+-positive feedback is also thought to underlie the propagation of regenerative intracellular Ca2+ waves (24Thomas A.P. Bird G.S. Hajnóczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Putney Jr., J.W. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1505-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). We have previously suggested that the minimal prerequisites for generating oscillatory [Ca2+]i signals are the concordant actions of Ca2+ and IP3 on IP3R function (31Hajnoczky G. Thomas A.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3533-3543Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Because Ca2+ is involved in both the activation and inactivation of the IP3R (22Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6148) Google Scholar, 23Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Lipp P. Nature. 1998; 395: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar, 24Thomas A.P.

FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1505-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), other Ca2+ transport mechanisms could exert profound effects on the dynamics and frequency of [Ca2+]isignals by altering local Ca2+ gradients. Indeed, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake can modulate IP3sensitivity by suppressing the local, positive feedback effects of Ca2+ on the IP3R in hepatocytes (32Hajnoczky G. Hager R. Thomas A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14157-14162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar).In the present work, we have investigated the effects of CSA on IP3-dependent [Ca2+]ioscillations in hepatocytes. We demonstrate that CSA or its non-immunosuppressive analogue, N-methylvaline-cyclosporin (MeVal-CS), inhibits the frequency of IP3-dependent [Ca2+]ioscillations by simultaneously activating ER and mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. We provide evidence that this activation suppresses local, positive Ca2+ feedback on the IP3R and lowers IP3R sensitivity. Thus, cyclophilins may play an essential role in determining the shape and frequency of IP3-dependent [Ca2+]i signals and, ultimately, the activity of downstream Ca2+-sensitive targets by regulating cellular Ca2+ transport mechanisms. Immunosuppressants exert their activity by binding to immunophilins, an evolutionary conserved, but structurally heterogeneous family of proteins that shares a common enzymatic activity and pharmacological profile (1Galat A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 689-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 2Fruman D.A. Burakoff S.J. Bierer B.E. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 3Marks A.R. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 631-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). All immunophilins described to date possesscis-trans-peptidylprolyl isomerase or rotamase activity, which has been implicated in the folding, assembly, and trafficking of target proteins in vivo (1Galat A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 689-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 2Fruman D.A. Burakoff S.J. Bierer B.E. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Thecis-trans-peptidylprolyl isomerase activity is inhibited by low concentrations of immunosuppressants. Based upon binding criteria, immunophilins are divided into two classes: (a) the cyclophilin family that selectively binds cyclosporin A (CSA)1 and (b) the FK-506 binding proteins (FKBP), which bind to FK-506, its analogues, and rapamycin. Although the precise functions of immunophilins and their downstream targets remain to be determined, they have frequently been implicated in regulating a variety of Ca2+-dependent pathways. The best characterized therapeutic action of CSA or FK-506 is the suppression of interleukin-2 gene transcription during antigen-induced T-lymphocyte activation.

https://openalex.org/W2076439922,"Substance P analogues including [d-Arg1,d-Phe5,d-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P (SpD) act as broad spectrum neuropeptide antagonists and are potential anticancer agents that inhibit the growth of small cell lung cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. However, their mechanism of action is controversial and not fully understood. Although these compounds block bombesin-induced mitogenesis and signal transduction, they also have activity. The mechanism underlying this activity was examined. SpD binds to the ligand-binding site of the bombesin/gastrin-releasing peptide receptor and blocks the bombesin-stimulated increase in [Ca2+]i within the same concentration range that causes sustained activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK). The activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase by SpD and bombesin is blocked by dominant negative inhibition of G(alpha12). The ERK activation by SpD is pertussis toxin-sensitive in contrast to ERK activation by bombesin, which is pertussis toxin-insensitive but dependent on epidermal growth factor receptor phosphorylation. SpD does not simply act as a partial but differentially modulates the activation of the G-proteins G(alpha12), G(i), and G(q) compared with bombesin. This unique ability allows the bombesin receptor to couple to G(i) and at the same time block receptor activation of G(q). Our results provide direct evidence that SpD is acting as a agonist and that this has physiological relevance in small cell lung cancer cells. This validation of the concept of biased agonism has important implications in the development of novel pharmacological agents to dissect receptor-mediated signal transduction and of highly selective drugs to treat human disease."

To begin to define the regulation and function of terminal α(1,2)fucosylated carbohydrates in these and other tissues, we isolated and characterized a 85-kilobase (kb) genomic region of mouse chromosome 7, 23.2 centimorgans analogous to human chromosome 19q13.3 that encodes three α(1,2)fucosyltransferases. Gene-specific DNA probes from the open reading frames of the mouse fucosyltransferase genes corresponding to human FUT1, FUT2, and SEC1demonstrate distinct tissue-specific expression patterns by Northern blot analyses. Flow cytometry profiles of cultured cells transfected with DNA segments containing the open reading frames of the mouse genes confirm that each encodes an α(1,2)fucosyltransferase. In uterus and colon, a 3.3-kb FUT2 mRNA represents the major fucosyltransferase gene expressed. Steady-state FUT2mRNA levels are cyclically regulated during the estrus cycle, increasing 10-fold from early diestrus to a relative maximum in proestrus. In contrast, SEC1 and FUT1 do not show prominently regulated expression in uterus. FUT2expression localizes to luminal uterine epithelium by in situ hybridization, implying that this gene determines expression of cell surface Fucα1→2Galβ epitopes proposed to mediate blastocyst adhesion.

Specifically, the terminal α(1,2)fucosylated oligosaccharide epitope known as the H type 1 moiety undergoes differential expression in the endometrium and early embryo, exhibits regulation during the mouse estrus cycle, and is present at a time appropriate for implantation (23Kimber S.J. Lindenberg S. Lundblad A. J. Reprod. Immunol. 1988; 12: 297-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 24Kimber S.J. Lindenberg S. J. Reprod.

The epitope is also present on uterine epithelium of ovariectomized mice only after estrogen injection at a time correlated with endometrial receptivity (24Kimber S.J. Lindenberg S. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1990; 89: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition, exogenous H type 1 oligosaccharide and monoclonal antibodies toward this epitope inhibit blastocyst adhesion in vitro, whereas isomeric oligosaccharides and isotype-controlled antibodies do not inhibit this attachment (25Lindenberg S. Sundberg K. Kimber S.J. Lundblad A. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1988; 83: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a potential counter-receptor on hatched mouse blastocysts has been demonstrated by specific binding of fluorescently labeled H type 1 oligosaccharide (26Lindenberg S. Kimber S.J. Kallin E. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1990; 89: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 27Yamagata T. Yamazaki K. Biochem. Biophy. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 1004-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This binding was specific to the apical surface of mural trophectoderm where the initial adhesion to uterine epithelium is seen in the mouse. The glycosidic linkages of the H type 1 epitope, like other oligosaccharides, are catalyzed by the actions of specific glycosyltransferases (28Hagopian A. Eylar E.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 128: 422-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 29Sadler J.E. Ginsburg V. Robbins P.W. Biology of Carbohydrates. Wiley, New York1984: 200-287Google Scholar). The last step in the synthesis of the H type 1 determinant is catalyzed by an α(1,2)fucosyltransferase activity whose expression is restricted to specific tissues. By genetic analysis and cloning studies in humans, two fucosyltransferase genes,FUT1 1 andFUT2, are known to be capable of synthesizing α(1,2)fucose oligosaccharides such as those found in H type 1 epitopes (30Larsen R.D.

A third DNA segment in humans (called SEC1) appears to be a pseudogene containing gene-inactivating frameshift mutations (31Rouquier S. Lowe J.B. Kelly R.J. Fertitta A.L. Lennon G.C. Giorgi D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4632-4639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar,32Kelly R.J. Rouquier S. Giorgi D. Lennon G.G. Lowe J.B. J. Biol.

An α(1,2)fucosyltransferase activity has been demonstrated in preparations of mouse uterine epithelial cells in vitro(33White S. Kimber S.J. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 50: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This enzymatic activity varied 5-fold during the estrus cycle with the highest activity in estrus (33White S. Kimber S.J. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 50: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition, in ovariectomized mice, the activity was increased in estrogen-treated animals and inhibited in progesterone-treated animals. Furthermore, changes in the biochemical activity were correlated with cyclical changes in mRNA expression in luminal and glandular epithelium by hybridization in situ using a 650-bp probe from a portion of the mouse FUT1 coding exon (34Sidu S.S. Kimber S.J. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 60: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis with this probe on uterine RNA identified a single transcript of a size larger than expected for FUT1, based on our own characterization of the mouse FUT1 locus (35Domino S.E. Hiraiwa N. Lowe J.B. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis using sonicated uterine epithelial samples in vitrowas consistent with the presence of one type of α(1,2)fucosyltransferase activity (34Sidu S.S. Kimber S.J. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 60: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). FUT1 expression was reported by these authors to decrease during early pregnancy by reverse transcriptase-PCR and confirmed by sequencing of the resulting 358-bp band (34Sidu S.S. Kimber S.J. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 60: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Taken together, these experimental data suggest involvement of both the H type 1 epitope and the enzymes that catalyze the synthesis of this epitope in blastocyst adhesion. We now identify and characterize three mouse α(1,2)fucosyltransferase genes capable of expressing the H type 1 oligosaccharide. Using relatively short 200-bp gene-specific probes, we find that steady-state FUT2 mRNA levels are cyclically regulated during the estrus cycle, increasing ∼10-fold from early diestrus to a relative maximum in proestrus. FUT1was also detected in uterus but did not show regulated expression and accumulated at relatively lower steady-state mRNA levels.FUT2 expression localizes to luminal uterine epithelium byin situ hybridization, implying that this gene determines expression of cell surface Fucα1→2Galβ epitopes proposed to mediate blastocyst adhesion. A commercially available P1 genomic library (strain 129P2/OlaHsd, Incyte Genomics, St. Louis, MO) was screened using PCR primers that generate a 432-bp amplicon from the 3′-region of the open reading frame of mouse FUT1 (35Domino S.E. Hiraiwa N. Lowe J.B. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar): forward primer, 5′-TAC CTT TGT GGG TGT CCA TGT GCG-3′ and backward primer, 5′-GAT GCC CAC CCA CTC GGG CAG G-3′. Positive clones were transferred by transduction to Escherichia coli NS3516 to increase plasmid yield. Plasmid preparations were performed according to the manufacture's instructions by alkaline lysis of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside-induced cultures. Restriction digestions were performed with NotI,SfiI, SalI, and PacI. Restriction fragments of 2–85 kb were mapped by pulsed field gel electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel on a Bio-Rad CHEF Mapper for 16 h at 14 °C, 6 v/cm with switching times of 2.16–6.67 s and a ramping constant of 0.130. Plasmid Southern blotting (36Brown T. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley, New York1993: 2.9.1-2.9.15Google Scholar) using a double-stranded DNA probe corresponding to the 432-bp PCR amplicon was performed to identify smaller restriction fragments for subcloning and sequencing in vector pNEB193 (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA). Resulting plasmids were mapped by partial digestion restriction mapping (37Bloch K.D. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley, New York1987: 3.3.2Google Scholar) and DNA sequencing. Automated DNA sequencing was performed on Applied Biosystems DNA sequencers in the University of Michigan DNA Sequencing Core Facility. Sequencing runs with overlapping forward and backward primers were aligned using the program Sequencher (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI). Expression vectors for mouse FUT2 and SEC1 were designed using restriction sites obtained from the DNA sequences around each open reading frame and subcloned into the expression vector pcDNAI (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The plasmid pcDNAI-FUT2 contains the predicted open reading of mouseFUT2 in a 1.34-kb EcoRV fragment ligated into theEcoRV site of pcDNAI. The plasmid pcDNAI-SEC1 contains the predicted open reading of mouse SEC1 in a 1.34-kb TfiI/PvuII fragment. The TfiI overhang was filled in by T4 DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and ligated into the EcoRV site of pcDNAI. Correct orientation of the insert was determined by DNA sequencing. The expression vector pcDNAI-α(1,2)FTse containing humanFUT2 was used as a positive control (32Kelly R.J. Rouquier S. Giorgi D. Lennon G.G. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4640-4649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were stained 72 h following transient transfection by DOTAP liposomal transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with IgM monoclonal anti-A and -H antibodies (Chembiomed Ltd., Edmonton, Alberta, Canada) at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. Upon staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-murine IgM, cells were analyzed on a Becton-Dickinson FACScan (35Domino S.E. Hiraiwa N. Lowe J.B. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Enzymatic assay of α(1,2)fucosyltransferase activity in vitro was performed on extracts from transfected COS-7 cell cultures exactly as previously described (35Domino S.E. Hiraiwa N. Lowe J.B. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Following sequencing of the open reading frames ofFUT2 and SEC1, PCR primers were used to amplify DNA probes selective for each gene. Restriction sites forEcoRI and HindIII (underlined) were added for ease of subsequent isolation from the following plasmids. FUT2: 214-bp probe, forward primer 1, 5′-CGG AAT TCT GCT TTC TTT CCT GGC AGC C-3′; reverse primer 1, 5′-CCCAAG CTT TGC AGC TTG GCA CTC TGC TG-3′. SEC1: 208-bp probe, forward primer 2, 5′-CGG AAT TCT CCT GTC TTC TCT CAC TCA CAG TGC-3′; reverse primer 2, 5′-CCC AAG CTT TGA TGG TGA ACA TGC CCT CC-3′. The Expand High Fidelity PCR kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) was used for amplification of the probe sequences. The resulting DNA fragments were purified with a Qiagen QIAquick gel extraction kit column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), restricted with EcoRI and HindIII, re-purified, and cloned into pGEM-4Z (Promega, Madison, WI). DNA sequencing confirmed the correct amplification of the probe sequences. To obtain probes for Southern and Northern blot analysis, the FUT2-pGEM4Z and SEC1-pGEM4Z plasmids described above were restricted with EcoRI and HindIII. Double-stranded DNA probes of 214 and 208 bp were purified and used in Southern blot and Northern blot analyses following standard protocols (36Brown T. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D.

To summarize, total RNA was collected from various flash-frozen mouse organs and run twice over oligo-dT columns to enrich for polyadenylated RNA. Ultraviolet absorbance at 260 nm was determined for each sample, and equal amounts (3–5 μg) of polyadenylated RNA from each tissue were run on formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis. The gels were transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond-N, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and prehybridized overnight in a formamide-based nucleic acid hybridization buffer. 25 ng of oligonucleotide probes was random-primed with [32P]dCTP using the Rediprime DNA-labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) resulting in a specific activity of 1–2 × 109 cpm/μg of DNA probe. Blots were hybridized for 24–36 h, then washed with 2× SSC, 0.2% SDS at room temperature for 10 min three times, then 0.5× SSC, 0.2% SDS at 65 °C for 15 min twice. Washed blots were quantified on a PhosphorImager then subjected to autoradiography for the final images. Other mouse gene studies by Northern blot analysis used previously published or commercially available probes: FUT1, 347-bp PCR fragment (35Domino S.E. Hiraiwa N. Lowe J.B. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar); Fuc-TIV, NcoI-SspI segment (39Gersten K.M. Natsuka S. Trinchera M. Petryniak B. Kelly R.J. Hiraiwa N. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J.

Mice, strain 129×1/SvJ (Jackson Laboratory, Stock no. 000691), 8–9 weeks old, were followed by examination of vaginal cytology through at least two estrus cycles (41Nelson J.F. Felicio L.S. Randall P.K. Sims C. Finch C.E. Biol. Reprod. 1982; 27: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Uteri from 4–5 mice in each stage of the estrus cycle were collected for Northern analysis as above and forin situ hybridization. In situ hybridization was performed on 10-μm frozen sections of mouse uteri as previously described using FUT1- and FUT2-specific probes (35Domino S.E. Hiraiwa N. Lowe J.B. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 42Smith P.L. Gersten K.M. Petryniak B. Kelly R.J. Rogers C. Natsuka Y. Alford 3rd, J.A. Scheidegger E.P. Natsuka S. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8250-8259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The 228-bp FUT1 probe corresponds to bp 81–308 of the FUT1 open reading frame (35Domino S.E. Hiraiwa N. Lowe J.B. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The 214-bp FUT2probe corresponds to bp −20 to 194 of the FUT2 open reading frame. To compare in situ hybridization with the previously published study of FUT1 expression in uterus, a less selective 530-bp FUT1 probe that shares 70% similarity between FUT1 and FUT2 was derived from anEcoRI/PstI fragment corresponding to bp 556–1085 of the FUT1 open reading frame uterus (34Sidu S.S. Kimber S.J. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 60: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Frozen sections of mouse uteri were processed in duplicate. Each slide contained adjacent sections for hybridization with antisense and sense control probes. Single-stranded RNA probes were synthesized with [35S]UTP using the Riboprobe transcription kit (Promega) from T7 and Sp6 promoters as previously described (35Domino S.E. Hiraiwa N. Lowe J.B. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) using linearized plasmids. After hybridization under glass coverslips overnight, slides were washed twice under high stringency (50% formamide, 2× SSC, 20 mm dithiothreitol at 65 °C for 30 min), dipped in photographic emulsion, and exposed for 2–4 weeks at 4 °C. Slides were developed and examined under darkfield microscopy. Because the three human α(1,2)fucosyltransferase genes are physically linked within an 65-kb region of human chromosome 19, it was reasoned that a similar linkage may be found in the mouse (31Rouquier S. Lowe J.B. Kelly R.J. Fertitta A.L. Lennon G.C. Giorgi D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4632-4639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). A P1 phage library was chosen for screening because of the relatively large insert size in P1 clones of 75–95 kb (43Sternberg N.L. Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 11-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Because the three human α(1,2)fucosyltransferase genes showed the highest degree of sequence similarity in their 3′-regions (32Kelly R.J. Rouquier S. Giorgi D. Lennon G.G. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4640-4649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), PCR primers for the P1 screening were chosen from the presumed catalytic region in the 3′-end of a previously cloned mouse FUT1 open reading frame (35Domino S.E. Hiraiwa N. Lowe J.B. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) to maximize the potential cross-hybridization with several α(1,2)fucosyltransferase genes. Four positive P1 clones with inserts of 70–85 kb were obtained by screening a mouse genomic P1 library (see “Experimental Procedures”). The clones were characterized by pulsed field gel electrophoresis restriction mapping and plasmid Southern blotting using probes derived from mouse FUT1. Upon subcloning and sequencing of the largest clone, three α(1,2)fucosyltransferase open reading frames were obtained (Fig.1 A). From the T7-end of the P1 vector, 9257 bp were sequenced, including the open reading frame ofFUT1 (GenBank™ accession number AF214655). The DNA coding sequence of 129P2/OlaHsd mouse FUT1 was identical to our previously published sequence of NIH Swiss mouse FUT1 (35Domino S.E. Hiraiwa N. Lowe J.B. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). From the Sp6 site of the P1 vector, nine overlapping subclones were serially mapped by EcoRI restriction digestion and plasmid Southern blotting (Fig. 1 B). Open reading frames for mouse genes FUT2 (GenBank™ AF214656) and SEC1(GenBank™ AF214657) were determined by sequencing 6762-bp and 4705-bp contigs, and are similar to GenBank™ accession number sequencesAF064792 and Y09882/AF113532, respectively. The order and relative spacing of the three loci (FUT1, FUT2, and SEC1) on mouse chromosome 7, 23.2 centimorgans (35Domino S.E. Hiraiwa N. Lowe J.B. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), is similar to the homologous genes on human chromosome 19q13.3 (31Rouquier S. Lowe J.B. Kelly R.J. Fertitta A.L. Lennon G.C. Giorgi D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4632-4639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and implies gene duplication, as has been postulated for the human FUT1 and FUT2 loci. Mouse FUT2 and SEC1 are encoded by single open reading frames contained within relatively small continuous genomic DNA segments (Fig. 2 A). The humanFUT2 locus also maintains a single coding exon, although there are one or possibly more 5′-exons derived from this human gene. We do not yet know if the mouse FUT2 is similar in this regard, because we have not yet characterized the structures of mouseFUT2 cDNAs. When compared with the orthologous human fucosyltransferases, mouse FUT2 and SEC1 display 82% and 77%, respectively, nucleotide sequence identity (Fig.2 B). The corresponding mouse polypeptides predicted by these open reading frames show conservation of type-2 transmembrane topology, because each is predicted to maintain short intracellular amino termini, transmembrane regions of 14–20 amino acid residues, and conservation of predicted N-glycosylation sites. In contrast to the human gene, the coding region of mouseSEC1 extends beyond the region in human SEC1where a 2-base pair deletion results in a frameshift and consequent inactivation of fucosyltransferase activity. Mouse SEC1maintains an in-frame translation similar to FUT2, including a high degree of sequence similarity to FUT2, and conservation of three predicted N-glycosylation sites. The open reading frames of mouse FUT2 and SEC1 share 75% sequence identity overall, with 50-bp regions that vary from 25% to 99% identity (Fig. 2 C). Our previous studies have documented that mouse FUT1 encodes an α(1,2)fucosyltransferase (35Domino S.E. Hiraiwa N. Lowe J.B. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To determine if the genomic DNA sequences for FUT2 and SEC1 encode functional α(1,2)fucosyltransferases, 1.3-kb restriction fragments containing the open reading frames of each gene were cloned into mammalian expression vectors, sequenced to assure correct orientation, and transiently transfected into COS-7 cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In our previous studies, we found that blood group A and B glycosyltransferases are expressed in COS-7 cells, whereas α(1,2)fucosyltransferase, and H blood group molecules, are absent from these cells (35Domino S.E. Hiraiwa N. Lowe J.B. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Because H blood group molecules are used as substrates by the A and B transferases, the A and B transferases in COS-7 cells thus cannot form A or B antigens. However, when transfected with an α(1,2)fucosyltransferase expression vector, the cells can then form H blood group molecules, and these can in turn be used as substrates by the A and B transferases to form A and B blood antigens (35Domino S.E. Hiraiwa N. Lowe J.B. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the present analysis, anti-H and anti-A antibodies were used in similar flow-cytometry analyses on COS-7 cells transiently transfected with expression constructs for FUT2 and SEC1. Mouse FUT2 demonstrates accumulation of A and H antigens (Fig.3). Although significantly lower in apparent activity compared with human and mouse FUT2, cells transfected with the mouse SEC1 vector also accumulate A and H antigens. To compare the mouse enzymes to human FUT2, the apparent Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) for the artificial substrate phenyl-β-d-galactoside was assayed in extracts from transiently transfected COS-7 cells (see “Experimental Procedures”). While authentic α(1,2)fucosyltransferase acceptors include O- and N-linked type I and II glycans as well as glycolipids, phenyl-β-d-galactoside is typically chosen as a representative acceptor because of its ease of purification. Extracts from cells transfected with FUT2 fucosylate phenyl-β-d-galactoside with an apparent Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) of 10.2 mm. ThisKm is similar to the Kmdetermination for this substrate using human FUT2 (11.5 mm(32Kelly R.J. Rouquier S. Giorgi D. Lennon G.G. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4640-4649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 4). Unexpectedly, the expression vector containing the open reading frame of SEC1 had no detectable fucosyltransferase activity in this assay under circumstances where we identify cell surface H and A epitopes in SEC1-transfected cells. These observations suggest that the physiological acceptors for SEC1, some of which must be made by COS cells, are not highly similar to the in vitro substrate phenyl-β-d-galactoside To study mRNA expression of the FUT2 and SEC1 loci, we sought to generate relatively short gene-specific DNA probes with less than 35% sequence identity, because the open reading frames of FUT2 and SEC1 contain long regions of 75% to 99% similarity. From the 5′-coding regions, ∼200 bp of each gene were subcloned by PCR (see “Experimental Procedures”; Fig.5 A). To test the specificity of the probes, Southern blot analyses were performed (Fig.5 B). The FUT2 214-bp and SEC1 208-bp probes identify single bands (Fig. 5 B). Using these gene-specific probes, Northern blot analysis discloses thatFUT2 and SEC1 show distinct patterns of mRNA expression in adult tissues (Fig. 6). TheFUT2 probe identifies a single transcript of ∼3.3 kb expressed most abundantly in uterus, stomach, and colon, and at a lower level on ovary. In contrast, the SEC1 probe hybridizes to multiple transcripts in testes/epididymis"

Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 185-243Google Scholar, 2Webb B.L.J. Proud C.G. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 29: 1127-1131Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Such complexes can then bind to the 40 S ribosomal subunit to form pre-initiation complexes, bringing the Met-tRNAi into position to recognize the AUG start codon of the mRNA following ribosomal scanning. The eIF2-bound GTP molecule is then hydrolyzed to GDP and Pi in a process that requires a further factor, eIF5. The inactive eIF2·GDP complex is released from the ribosome. The rate of release of GDP from eIF2 is very slow under physiological conditions, and the exchange of bound GDP for GTP, to regenerate active eIF2·GTP, requires an additional factor, eIF2B. The activity of eIF2B plays a key role in regulating the initiation of translation and can be controlled in several ways. For example, phosphorylation of the α-subunit of eIF2 inhibits eIF2B and serves to inhibit translation under a range of stressful conditions (1Hinnebusch A.G. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 185-243Google Scholar). Conversely, eIF2B is activated by many stimuli, which stimulate protein synthesis, including insulin, and this appears to involve changes in the state of phosphorylation of the largest (ε) subunit of eIF2B (3Welsh G.I.

Studies using photoactivatable nucleotide analogs suggested that eIF2B contains binding sites for GTP and ATP, although the functions of these sites are unclear. eIF2B is an unusually complicated guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), those acting on small G-proteins such as Ras, for example, being much smaller monomeric proteins. The reasons for this complexity and the roles of the five subunits are still not completely clear. A major step toward addressing these issues has been the cloning of cDNAs encoding subunits of eIF2B. This has now been achieved for several species, including yeast (see, e.g., Refs. 10Bushman J.L.

Studies for all three sources have shown that the ε-subunit alone can catalyze nucleotide exchange on eIF2 (17Williams D.D. Pavitt G.D. Proud C.G. J. Biol.

Biol. 2000; 20: 3965-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). eIF2Bε forms a catalytic subcomplex with eIF2Bγ, with which it shares some sequence similarity. The other three subunits also display mutual sequence similarity and form a second subcomplex, which appears to have a regulatory function (19Pavitt G.D. Ramaiah K.V.A. Kimball S.R. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 514-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). There is some disagreement over the role of the α-subunit. This polypeptide is encoded by a non-essential gene in yeast (GCN3), although it is required for regulation of eIF2B by phosphorylation of eIF2α (21Hannig E.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4808-4820Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Similarly, studies in which mammalian eIF2B polypeptides were expressed in insect cells concluded that eIF2Bα was dispensable for activity (22Kimball S.R. Fabian J.R. Pavitt G.D. Hinnebusch A.G. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12841-12845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, others have found that preparations of eIF2B lacking the α-subunit showed reduced activity in nucleotide exchange (23Craddock B.L. Proud C.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 843-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), implying that this component was required for full activity. There is also disagreement over the catalytic mechanism of eIF2B; early studies supported the so-called “ping-pong” or substituted enzyme mechanism (Mechanism A in Fig. 1; Ref. 24Rowlands A.G. Panniers R. Henshaw E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5526-5533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is the one utilized by another GEF involved in mRNA translation, the bacterial elongation factor EF-Ts (25Hwang Y.W. Miller D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11498-11502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by factors that promote nucleotide exchange on other GTP-binding proteins (26Klebe C. Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 27Klebe C. Prinz H. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S.

These factors act to stimulate the release of bound guanine nucleotide and are thus termed “GDP dissociation stimulator proteins” (GDS proteins, Ref. 29Hutchinson J.P. Eccleston J.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11348-11359Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).Other studies have suggested that eIF2B may operate via the alternative sequential mechanism (Mechanism B in Fig. 1; Refs. 30Dholakia J.N. Wahba A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 546-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 31Nika J. Yang W. Pavitt G.D. Hinnebusch A.G. Hannig E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26011-26017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that the properties of eIF2B match the operation of the ping-pong mechanism and suggest that eIF2B acts as a GDS protein. We also show that eIF2Bβ contains a binding site for purine nucleotides and that eIF2Bα is required for the full activity of mammalian eIF2B. Chemicals and biochemicals were obtained from BDH-Merck (Poole, Dorset, United Kingdom (UK)) or Sigma Alrich (Gillingham, Dorset, UK), unless otherwise stated. [3H]GDP (10Ci/mmol), [γ-32P]GTP (5000 Ci/mmol), and [γ-32P]ATP (30 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham International. X-ray film was from Konica. Restriction enzymes were from Promega. These proteins were purified as described previously (8Oldfield S. Proud C.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), but using HeLa cell cytoplasm as the starting material (from Computer Cell Culture Center, Seneffe, Belgium). The cytoplasmic fraction was subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionation, and the material precipitating between 30% and 60% saturation was subjected to ion exchange chromatography successively on Q-Sepharose, S-Sepharose, MonoQ, and MonoS (all from Pharmacia Nycomed). eIF2B was assayed by its ability to promote the release of [3H]GDP from preformed eIF2·[3H]GDP complexes (8Oldfield S. Proud C.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), except that time allowed for formation of the eIF2·[3H]GDP binary complexes was extended to 20 min. In some cases, assays were performed with modifications (e.g. in the absence of unlabeled nucleotide) as described in the figure legends. UV cross-linking reactions were performed using a Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene). Reactions were 10 μl and contained 20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 5 μl of eIF2B (2 pmol), either 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]GTP or 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (as indicated), and either 0.5 or 2.5 μm unlabeled nucleotide (also as indicated). Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 5 min prior to exposure to UV radiation (1.2 J/cm2) for 20 min on ice. Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, and gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and dried prior to exposure to x-ray film. Control reactions were either incubated at 30 °C for 5 min and then on ice for 20 min without exposure to UV radiation, or incubated on ice only, as detailed in the figure legend. eIF2Bα in pET15b was provided by Dr. J. K. Tyzack (a former member of the laboratory at Dundee and Canterbury), and eIF2Bβ in pET11a was provided by Dr. B. Craddock (a former member of our laboratory at Bristol). The regions encoding the open reading frames for both subunits were excised (using NdeI and BamHI for eIF2Bα and NdeI andXhoI for eIF2Bβ) and ligated into pET28c (Novagen). Vectors were then transformed into Escherichia coli (BL21 DE3 pLysS) and grown overnight in LB containing 100 μg/ml kanamycin. They were then diluted 10-fold and grown to anA 600 of 0.6. Cultures were cooled on ice for 15 min, and expression was induced with 1 mmisopropylthio-β-d-galactoside for 2.5 h. Cells were the harvested by centrifugation (3500 × g) and lysed in 5% glycerol, 500 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 3 mm MgCl2, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm imidazole, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml protease inhibitors (leupeptin, pepstatin, aprotinin, and benzamidine) at −80 °C. Following lysis cells were defrosted and sonicated to shear any DNA present. Purification of proteins was performed using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). eIF2B was purified from HeLa cell extract using a slightly modified version of the method used earlier for its isolation from reticulocyte lysates (see “Materials and Methods”). This yielded protein displaying five polypeptides migrating on SDS-PAGE. These polypeptides displayed expected apparent molecular weights for subunits of mammalian eIF2B. This material was devoid of eIF2, as assessed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Fig.2 A) and by the much more stringent criterion of Western blotting with a sensitive monoclonal antibody against eIF2α (Fig.2 B). Such preparations are highly active in catalyzing exchange of labeled GDP bound to eIF2 for unlabeled GTP (Fig.2 C). We (8Oldfield S. Proud C.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and others (30Dholakia J.N. Wahba A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 546-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Nika J. Yang W. Pavitt G.D. Hinnebusch A.G. Hannig E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26011-26017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) have previously reported that eIF2B failed to catalyze the release of labeled GDP from eIF2·[3H]GDP complexes unless excess unlabeled GTP was present. In view of the aims of this study, it was important to show that this was also true for this preparation of eIF2B, which is indeed the case as shown in Fig. 2 C; whereas rapid release of bound [3H]GDP was observed when unlabeled GTP was present, very little release was observed in the absence of added GTP. A small degree of release of [3H]GDP was seen when the higher concentration of eIF2B was used, and this effect is discussed in greater detail below. Two different models have been proposed to explain the catalytic mechanism of eIF2B. These are depicted in Fig.1. Briefly, in the ping-pong or substituted enzyme model, the binding of eIF2B to eIF2·GDP complexes elicits the release of the GDP, allowing GTP to bind to eIF2 to form active eIF2·GTP complexes and resulting in the release of the eIF2B (Fig. 1 A). In this model, eIF2B is acting as a GDS. Complexes between eIF2, GDP, and eIF2B presumably do form, but only transiently, decaying as the GDP is released to yield eIF2·eIF2B binary complexes. The second model (sequential, Fig. 1 B) involves the formation of a “ternary complex” containing eIF2·GDP, eIF2B and GTP. The data showing a requirement for added guanine nucleotide in order to observe the release of bound GDP from eIF2 have been taken as support for the sequential mechanism (B in Fig. 1) (30Dholakia J.N. Wahba A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 546-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Nika J. Yang W. Pavitt G.D. Hinnebusch A.G. Hannig E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26011-26017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, consideration of the two mechanisms reveals that they are also entirely consistent with mechanism A. Indeed, such behavior is a prediction of this mechanism as displayed in Fig. 1 A. eIF2B is included in the assays used by ourselves and others at catalytic rather than stoichiometric amounts; in the assays depicted in Fig.2 C, typically the ratio of eIF2:eIF2B is about 1000:1. Inspection of the mechanism shown in Fig.1 A shows that for eIF2B to act catalytically, it must be released from the intermediate eIF2·eIF2B complex and that this requires free nucleotide. Free nucleotide would act to regenerate eIF2B, thus allowing it to function as a catalyst and thus to mediate further release of labeled GDP from the eIF2·[3H]GDP complexes, which are the substrate for this reaction. Since eIF2 can bind either GDP or GTP, one would expect that, under this model, catalytic exchange would proceed with either free GTP or GDP present. This is indeed the case for mammalian eIF2B (Fig.2 C and data not shown), as reported earlier for the yeast factor (11Cigan A.M. Bushman J.L. Boal T.R. Hinnebusch A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5350-5354Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Consistent with the earlier findings of Cigan et al. (11Cigan A.M. Bushman J.L. Boal T.R. Hinnebusch A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5350-5354Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) for yeast eIF2B, ATP did not facilitate release of bound GDP from eIF2 (data not shown). A prediction of mechanism A, the ping-pong mechanism, but not of mechanism B, is that incubation of eIF2·eIF2B complexes with guanine nucleotides should cause such complexes to dissociate. The eIF2·eIF2B complex was purified by ion-exchange chromatography on MonoQ (Fig. 3 A) and then incubated with GDP, followed by addition of MgCl2 and re-chromatography on MonoQ. During this second run, eIF2 was resolved from eIF2B (which eluted later from the column; see also Ref. 8Oldfield S. Proud C.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar and Fig. 3 (B and C)). Chromatography of complexes that had not been pre-treated with GDP did not result in separation of the two proteins, which instead again eluted as the eIF2·eIF2B complex (data not shown). To study this further, we performed similar experiments using gel permeation chromatography rather than ion exchange to resolve eIF2 or eIF2B from eIF2·eIF2B complexes. When eIF2·eIF2B complexes were applied to a Superose 6 column without GDP treatment, as expected, eIF2 and eIF2B eluted together (Fig.3 D). In contrast, when another sample of the eIF2·eIF2B complexes was incubated with GDP and then applied to a Superose 6 column, eIF2 (seen in fractions 27–29) clearly eluted later than eIF2B (mainly in fractions 24–26), indicating that eIF2 and eIF2B had dissociated from one another (Fig. 3 E). These data are again consistent with mechanism A, but not mechanism B, and support the contention that the ability of free GDP or GTP to facilitate the release of [3H]GDP bound to eIF2 is due to the regeneration of free, active eIF2B. The data again support the idea that eIF2B acts as a GDS. An additional prediction of mechanism A is that stoichiometric amounts of eIF2B should lead to extensive release of GDP even in the absence of free nucleotide. That this might be the case was suggested by the modest release of [3H]GDP observed in Fig. 2 C in the presence of the higher amount of eIF2B. To test this further, eIF2·[3H]GDP complexes were formed and subjected to gel filtration to remove free nucleotide. Purified eIF2B was then added in increasing amounts similar to or greater than the amount of eIF2·[3H]GDP complexes present. Under these conditions, release of labeled GDP was observed (Fig.4 A). Release was not complete, but in each case leveled out at a maximum extent (as the reaction attained equilibrium). As expected, the extent of release increased as larger amounts of eIF2B were used, since this will drive the equilibrium further toward completion. This is precisely the behavior predicted from the ping-pong mechanism, where eIF2B can bring about the release of amounts of GDP similar to the amount of eIF2B added, but cannot act catalytically as it becomes locked into the eIF2·eIF2B complexes. The release of eIF2B from these complexes requires free GDP or GTP, enabling the eIF2B now to act catalytically rather than stoichiometrically. Consistent with this, upon addition of free nucleotide, rapid complete loss of bound labeled GDP occurred, due to the catalytic action of the eIF2B (Fig. 4 B). Mechanism B requires that eIF2B contains a binding site for GTP and two earlier reports (for eIF2B from mammals (30Dholakia J.N. Wahba A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 546-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and yeast (31Nika J. Yang W. Pavitt G.D. Hinnebusch A.G. Hannig E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26011-26017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), respectively, have provided data indicating that eIF2B can bind GTP, albeit only to a low stoichiometry (∼0.2 mol of GTP/mol of eIF2B). Since eIF2Bε displays nucleotide exchange activity when expressed alone (17Williams D.D. Pavitt G.D. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3733-3742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 18Fabian J.R. Kimball S.R. Heinzinger N.K. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 514-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), one would expect that, if mechanism B were the mechanism of action of eIF2B, eIF2Bε should possess a binding site for GTP. However, we were unable to observe any significant binding of [γ-32P]GTP to our purified preparations of eIF2B complex in filter binding assays (binding <10% of the level seen for eIF2 on a molar basis; data not shown). Nevertheless, we pursued this issue further by using UV irradiation to cross-link [γ-32P]GTP to purified eIF2B. (This material is free of eIF2, thus obviating the problem of GTP binding to any eIF2 present.) We elected to perform these studies using unmodified GTP rather than 8-azido-GTP (where the photoactivatable label is in the base), as used previously (32Dholakia J.N. Francis B.R. Haley B.E. Wahba A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20638-20642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), since use of nucleotide analogs can give misleading results due to cross-linking to adjacent subunits in a protein complex rather than to the subunit which actually binds the nucleotide. An excellent example of this is eIF2 itself, where 8-azido-GTP (32Dholakia J.N. Francis B.R. Haley B.E. Wahba A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20638-20642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or other GTP analogs label eIF2α or -β (33Bommer U.A. Salimans M.M. Kurzchalia T.V. Voorma H.O. Karpova G.G. Biochem. Int. 1988; 16: 549-557PubMed Google Scholar,34Bommer U.A. Kurzchalia T.V. FEBS Lett. 1989; 244: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) rather than, or as well as, eIF2γ, the subunit that actually contains the GTP-binding site (35Hannig E.M. Cigan A.M. Freeman B.A. Kinzy T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 506-520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Gaspar N.J. Kinzy T.G. Scherer B.J. Humbelin M. Hershey J.W. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3415-3422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It could therefore be that the earlier studies, where 8-azido-GTP was cross-linked to eIF2Bβ, rather than eIF2Bε as expected for mechanism B, were also misleading. Our cross-linking studies using [γ-32P]GTP resulted in labeling of a polypeptide migrating at ∼40 kDa, i.e. in the position of eIF2Bβ (Fig.5 A), confirming the earlier study of Haley et al. (32Dholakia J.N. Francis B.R. Haley B.E. Wahba A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20638-20642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who found that this polypeptide was also labeled by azido-GTP. However, in contrast to that study, labeling was reduced by the presence of cold ATP as well as by cold GTP (Fig. 5 A). Similar labeling experiments using [γ-32P]ATP led to labeling of the same polypeptide, rather than eIF2Bγ and -δ reported by Haley et al. (32Dholakia J.N. Francis B.R. Haley B.E. Wahba A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20638-20642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To rule out the possibility that labeling occurred by transfer of the γ-phosphate (e.g. by a contaminating kinase), reactions were also performed without UV irradiation. Under this condition, no labeling was indeed observed (Fig. 5 B, lane 2). Labeling was decreased by addition of cold GTP or ATP (Fig. 5 C), GTP being slightly more effective than ATP. This suggests that ATP and GTP bind to the same (or overlapping) sites in eIF2β. To verify that GTP bound directly to eIF2Bβ, we expressed this polypeptide in E. coli as a His-tagged protein, purified it on nickel-agarose, and tested whether [γ-32P]GTP became cross-linked to it. As shown in Fig. 5 D (lane 2), UV irradiation did indeed result in cross-linking of labeled GTP to recombinant eIF2Bβ. This confirms that GTP interacts directly with this subunit and thus that the cross-linking to this polypeptide observed for the complex is not a consequence of its binding to another subunit at a site adjacent to eIF2Bβ in the holoprotein. As a negative control, reactions were again performed in the same way but without UV irradiation. In this case, no cross-linking was observed, once more ruling out the theoretical possibility that labeling by [γ-32P]GTP was due to phosphorylation of eIF2Bβ by a contaminating kinase (Fig.5 D, lanes 3 and 4). eIF2B is also known to interact with NAD+ and related compounds (5Dholakia J.N.

Biochem. 1992; 208: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To examine whether the binding site for these compounds was also located in eIF2Bβ, we performed UV cross-linking experiments with radioactive NAD+. However, this failed to result in labeling of any of the polypeptides of eIF2B, although lactate dehydrogenase, used as a positive control, was labeled (data not shown). In another approach, we examined whether NAD+or NADPH competed with GTP or ATP in the UV cross-linking experiments (Fig. 5). It did not; in fact, a reproducible increase in cross-linking was observed. It therefore appears that the nucleotide-binding site in eIF2Bβ is not the site responsible for binding NAD+, which presumably resides elsewhere in the protein. The ability of NAD+ to enhance labeling by [γ-32P]GTP or ATP may reflect allosteric interactions between the binding sites for these ligands. As reported previously (23Craddock B.L. Proud C.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 843-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), isolation of mammalian eIF2B from rabbit reticulocytes yields a proportion of the protein as a four-subunit complex lacking the α-subunit. The same is true of eIF2B prepared from HeLa cells (Fig. 6 A). Chromatography on MonoS yielded two pools of eIF2B; the material eluting at 290–320 mm KCl showed only four subunits on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6, A and B), whereas the material eluting at 330–370 mm showed five. The absence of eIF2Bα from the former material was confirmed using an antibody specific for the α-subunit of eIF2B (Fig. 6 A). No signal for eIF2Bα was observed in these fractions, whereas a clear signal was seen for the factor displaying all five subunits on SDS-PAGE (Fig.6 B). When the activities of the four- and five-subunit preparations were compared, the former was found to display only about 20–25% of the activity of the five-subunit material in the standard nucleotide exchange assay (Fig. 6 C). This is consistent with our earlier data for the four- and five-subunit preparations of the factor from rabbit reticulocytes (23Craddock B.L. Proud C.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 843-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To confirm that the absence of eIF2Bα from the four-subunit material was the explanation of its low activity, mammalian eIF2B"
https://openalex.org/W2061160824,"The finding that expression of a cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) transgene in cultured rat hepatoma cells caused a coordinate increase in lipogenesis and secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins led to the hypothesis that hepatic production of apoB-containing lipoproteins may be linked to the expression of CYP7A1 (Wang, S.-L., Du, E., Martin, T. D., and Davis, R. A. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 19351–19358). To examine this hypothesis in vivo, a transgene encoding CYP7A1 driven by the constitutive liver-specific enhancer of the human apoE gene was expressed in C56BL/6 mice. The expression of CYP7A1 mRNA (20-fold), protein (∼10-fold), and enzyme activity (5-fold) was markedly increased in transgenic mice compared with non-transgenic littermates. The bile acid pool of CYP7A1 transgenic mice was doubled mainly due to increased hydrophobic dihydroxy bile acids. In CYP7A1 transgenic mice, livers contained ∼3-fold more sterol response element-binding protein-2 mRNA. Hepatic expression of mRNAs encoding lipogenic enzymes (i.e. fatty-acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, stearoyl-CoA desaturase, squalene synthase, farnesyl-pyrophosphate synthase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, and low density lipoprotein receptor) as well as microsomal triglyceride transfer protein were elevated ∼3–5-fold in transgenic mice. CYP7A1 transgenic mice also displayed a >2-fold increase in hepatic production and secretion of triglyceride-rich apoB-containing lipoproteins. Despite the increased hepatic secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins in CYP7A1 mice, plasma levels of triglycerides and cholesterol were not significantly increased. These data suggest that the 5-fold increased expression of the low density lipoprotein receptor displayed by the livers of CYP7A1 transgenic mice was sufficient to compensate for the 2-fold increase production of apoB-containing lipoproteins. These findings emphasize the important homeostatic role that CYP7A1 plays in balancing the anabolic lipoprotein assembly/secretion pathway with the cholesterol catabolic bile acid synthetic pathway.

The assembly of apoB-containing lipoproteins is abrogated when these essential requirements are not satisfied, resulting in rapid degradation of apoB within the hepatocyte (7Borchardt R.A. Davis R.A.

Previous studies using cultured rat hepatoma cells showed that stable expression of CYP7A1 increases the cellular content of mature sterol response element-binding protein-1 (SREBP1) as well as mRNAs encoding essentially all the lipogenic enzymes required for very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) lipid production and assembly and secretion of apoB100-containing lipoproteins (19Wang S.-L.

These findings led us to hypothesize that CYP7A1 expression may indirectly regulate the assembly and secretion of VLDL via increasing the expression of SREBP, the expression of lipogenic enzymes and the expression of MTP (4Davis R.A.

Subsequent studies of livers from fasted and refed carbohydrate-induced mice showed that changes in the hepatic content of SREBPs could account for the observed changes in fat and sterol metabolism (25Horton J.D. Bashmakov Y. Shimomra I. Shiman H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5987-5992Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Fasted mice displayed reduced levels of SREBP1c and SREBP2, whereas livers from carbohydrate-refed mice displayed mainly an increase in SREBP1c (SREBP2 returned to normal levels) (25Horton J.D. Bashmakov Y. Shimomra I. Shiman H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5987-5992Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). SREBP1c preferentially increases the transcription of mRNAs involved in fatty acid biosynthesis (26Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Shimano H. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2331-2339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Shimano H. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2331-2339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the relative balance between mature levels of SREBP1 compared with SREBP2 influences metabolism via changing the expression of their gene targets.In the studies reported here, we examine the effect of expressing a CYP7A1 transgene in mice on the hepatic expression of mRNAs encoding SREBP1 and SREBP2, lipogenic enzymes, the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, and MTP and relate these changes to the production of hepatic apoB-containing lipoproteins. The results demonstrate that in CYP7A1 transgenic mice, hepatic production of apoB-containing lipoproteins is significantly augmented; yet there is no accumulation in plasma. Thus, plasma levels of lipoproteins do not necessarily reflect relative rates of VLDL production by the liver.RESULTSWe constructed a transgenic vector that we anticipated would provide stable and high level expression of CYP7A1 by the liver. A construct containing the coding region of rat CYP7A1 and the liver-specific enhancer region of the human apoE gene promoter region (29Simonet W.S. Bucay N. Lauer S.J. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8221-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was found to express high levels of CYP7A1 mRNA when transiently transfected into HepG2 cells (data not shown). This transgene was subsequently injected into blastocysts, which were implanted into pseudo-pregnant female mice (29Simonet W.S. Bucay N. Lauer S.J. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8221-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 30% of the newborn mice were shown to contain the rat CYP7A1 transgene, as determined by polymerase chain reaction analysis of genomic DNA obtained from the tail.First generation transgenic mice were bred with C57BL/6J mice. Progeny from each mating were examined for the presence of rat CYP7A1 mRNA (derived from the transgene) in liver. Two litters expressed rat CYP7A1 at levels similar to those reported in Fig.1. There was no significant difference in the expression of rat CYP7A1 mRNA between male and female mice. These transgenic mice also displayed increases in the hepatic expression of the LDL receptor and SREBP2 mRNAs that were similar to those displayed by fifth generation transgenic mice with a genetic background that was estimated to be >90% C57BL/6J (see Fig. 3). Thus, the phenotype described below for CYP7A1 transgenic mice is not likely the result of an epigenetic event caused by integration of the transgene.Figure 3Northern blot analysis of various lipogenic genes expressed in CYP7A1 transgenic and non-transgenic mice.Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from the livers of each group of mice on a chow diet (four/group (left panels) and three/group (right panels)) at mid-light.

The mRNA expression level of the rat CYP7A1 transgene was estimated to be >50-fold greater than that of the endogenous mouse CYP7A1. The expression of the transgene mRNA appeared to be liver-specific (i.e. using the RNase protection assay, we could not detect rat CYP7A1 mRNA in brain, lungs, heart, kidneys and skeletal muscle (data not shown)). Western blots of microsomes obtained from the livers of three transgenic mice displayed >9-fold more immunoreactivity toward an immunoaffinity-purified antibody raised against rat CYP7A1 compared with microsomes from non-transgenic mice (Fig. 1 B). The increased expression of CYP7A1 mRNA and protein in transgenic mice resulted in an ∼6-fold increase in CYP7A1 enzyme activity of hepatic microsomes (Fig. 1 C).Transgenic Expression of CYP7A1 Increases the Endogenous Bile Acid Pool Due Mainly to Increased TaurochenodeoxycholateThe bile acid pool was ∼2-fold greater in CYP7A1 transgenic mice compared with their non-transgenic littermates (Fig.2 A). It is interesting to note the stark difference in biliary bile acid composition between the CYP7A1 transgenic mice and non-transgenic mice. In the CYP7A1 transgenic mice, the relative content of the more hydrophobic (dihydroxy) biliary bile acids, taurochenodeoxycholic acid (+10-fold) and taurohyodeoxycholic acid (+5-fold), was increased, whereas the relative content of the more hydrophilic (trihydroxy) bile acids, taurocholic acid (−90%) and tauromuricholic acid (−50%), was significantly decreased (Fig. 2 B).Figure 2Transgenic expression of CYP7A1 increases the bile acid pool size. The small intestine, liver, and gall bladder were isolated from transgenic (Tg) and non-transgenic (Non-Tg) mice (three/group, N4 generation), and bile acid pool size (A) and composition (B) were determined by HPLC (34Schwarz M.

Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1663-1668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the livers of both groups of mice showed similar levels of apoB mRNA (Fig. 3). It is interesting to note that the changes in the expression of mRNAs displayed by CYP7A1 transgenic mice are similar to those observed in SREBP2 transgenic mice (26Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Shimano H. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2331-2339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Increased expression of hepatic LDL receptors was also observed in hamsters expressing CYP7A1 via an adenovirus transgene (37Spady D.K. Cuthbert J.A. Willard M.N. Meidell R.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 700-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).In CYP7A1 transgenic mice, the expression of endogenous (mouse) CYP7A1 was reduced to undetectable levels (Fig. 3), a result expected from the doubling of the endogenous bile acid pool size (Fig. 2). The alternative (acidic) bile acid biosynthetic pathway is controlled by oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7B1) mRNA (38Schwarz M. Lund E.G. Setchell K.D.R. Kayden H.J. Zerwekh J.E. Björkhem I. Herz J.

The livers of CYP7A1 transgenic mice expressed a 4.8-fold reduction in the expression of CYP7B1 compared with the livers of their non-transgenic siblings (Fig. 3). Feeding mice bile acids has been reported to cause a modest reduction in the hepatic expression of CYP7B1 mRNA (39Schwarz M. Lund E.G. Lathe R. Bjorkhem I. Russell D.W. J. Biol.

MTP protein levels were increased ∼1.7-fold (p < 0.025) in CYP7A1 transgenic mice compared with non-transgenic littermates when normalized to protein-disulfide isomerase (data not shown).Transgenic Expression of CYP7A1 Increases the Assembly and Secretion of Triglyceride-rich LipoproteinsWe quantitated the relative rate of accumulation of triglycerides and [35S]methionine-labeled apoB in the blood of mice treated with Triton WR-1339. Triton WR-1339 prevents the metabolism and removal of lipoproteins from plasma (40Friedman M. Byers S.O. Rosenman R.H. Arch. Intern. Med. 1965; 116: 807-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The rate of accumulation of VLDL in plasma following intravenous injection of Triton WR-1339 therefore provides a means to estimate their production rates. Following Triton WR-1339 administration, there were significantly greater amounts of triglyceride that accumulated in the plasma of CYP7A1 transgenic mice compared with non-transgenic littermates (Fig.4). Furthermore, least-squares analysis of the linear rate of accumulation of plasma triglycerides showed that CYP7A1 transgenic mice displayed a slope that was 2.2-fold greater than that obtained with non-transgenic mice.Figure 4Transgenic expression of CYP7A1 increases the hepatic production and secretion of triglycerides. Triton WR-1339 was injected into the tail veins of mice. At the indicated times, blood was obtained from the retro-orbital sinus. The content of triglycerides was determined by an enzyme assay. Each point represents the mean ± S.D. of four mice/group. *, significant difference (p < 0.01) between non-transgenic (open bars) and CYP7A1 transgenic (hatched bars) mice.

These combined data indicate that the hepatic assembly and secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins are increased in CYP7A1 transgenic mice.Figure 5Transgenic expression of CYP7A1 increases the hepatic production and secretion of de novosynthesized [35S]methionine-labeled apoB100 and apoB48. [35S]methionine was injected intraperitoneally; and 2 h later, Triton WR-1339 was injected via the tail vein. At the indicated times following Triton WR-1339 administration, blood was collected by retro-orbital puncture into heparinized Natelson tubes. Aliquots of plasma were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The portion of the gel containing apoB100 or apoB48 was excised and solubilized with Hyamine hydroxide, and then the amount of [35S]methionine was quantitated by β-scintillation counting. At each time point, 1 μl of plasma was placed on a filter paper, which was immersed in 15% trichloroacetic acid. The filter paper was then washed with acetone and ethyl ether. The trichloroacetic acid-precipitated protein was subjected to β-scintillation counting. Each point represents the relative amount of [35S]methionine in apoB100 or apoB48 relative to the total de novo synthesized [35S]methionine-labeled plasma proteins (trichloroacetic acid-precipitable protein). The slope of the linear rate of accumulation in plasma of [35S]methionine-labeled apoB100 or apoB48 relative to total [35S]methionine-labeled plasma proteins (determined by least-squares analysis) is indicated in each panel.

Although the concentration of triglyceride was slightly increased in the plasma of CYP7A1 mice, this 12% increase was not statistically significant. Furthermore, the plasma levels of cholesterol in non-high density lipoprotein lipoproteins were significantly decreased in CYP7A1 transgenic mice (−50%; p < 0.01) (Fig.6 A). We also examined the cholesterol content of lipoproteins that were fractionated by fast protein liquid chromatography. The results confirm the previous results showing that in the plasma of CYP7A1 transgenic mice, the cholesterol content of the apoB-containing lipoproteins (intermediate density lipoprotein and LDL; fractions 21–36) contained significantly less cholesterol (Fig.6 C). Plasma from CYP7A1 transgenic mice also contained significantly less cholesterol in the high density lipoprotein fractions (fractions 36–51) (Fig. 6 C). Although the plasma of CYP7A1 transgenic mice contained less cholesterol compared with the plasma obtained from non-transgenic littermates, the plasma content of both apoB100 and apoB48 was similar (Fig. 6 D). Thus, despite the significant 2-fold increase in hepatic production of apoB-containing lipoproteins in CYP7A1 mice, lipoproteins did not accumulate in plasma.Figure 6Plasma triglyceride and apoB containing lipoprotein cholesterol in transgenic and non-transgenic mice on a chow diet. Fasting plasma triglycerides (A) and apoB containing lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL, intermediate density lipoprotein, and LDL cholesterol) (B) were measured by enzyme assay. The means ± S.D. for nine mice/group are shown. Fast protein liquid chromatography analysis of plasma pooled from four CYP7A1 transgenic (Tg) and four non-transgenic (Non-Tg) mice was performed (C). Plasma from CYP7A1 transgenic and non-transgenic mice was assayed for apoB100, apoB48, and albumin by Western blot analysis (D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONOur results show that hepatic “overexpression” of a CYP7A1 transgene in mice leads to a 2-fold increase in the production of apoB100-containing lipoproteins. Further analysis indicated that the increased hepatic lipoprotein assembly/secretion displayed by CYP7A1 mice occurs in response to an induction of lipogenic biosynthetic enzymes whose transcription is increased by SREBP. The associated induction by SREBP2 of hepatic expression of LDL receptor mRNA was sufficient to prevent the accumulation in plasma of apoB-containing lipoproteins despite the increased lipoprotein production displayed CYP7A1 transgenic mice. The apparent coordinate linkage of the cholesterol/bile acid catabolic pathway with the anabolic lipoprotein assembly pathway contributes to the maintenance of cholesterol and lipoprotein homeostasis in C57BL/6 mice.The CYP7A1 transgene provided constitutive high level expression of CYP7A1 mRNA, protein, and enzyme activity in the livers of recipient mice (Fig. 1). Since transgenic mice showed normal fecundity, pregnancy, litter size, sex distribution, weight gain, fecal consistency, general health, and longevity (data not shown), the artificially increased expression of CYP7A1 did not impair essential physiological functions. It is interesting to note that the size of the bile acid pool of CYP7A1 transgenic mice was increased only ∼2-fold (Fig. 2), whereas CYP7A1 enzyme activity increased ∼6-fold (Fig.1 C). Thus, the expansion of the bile acid pool size was disproportionately less than expected. In other studies of mice fed a diet containing 0.2% cholate, the bile acid pool was also increased only 2-fold (34Schwarz M. Russell D.W. Dietschy J.M. Turley S.D. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1833-1843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These combined data suggest that an as yet to be defined process may limit expansion of the bile acid pool of mice beyond 2-fold.The finding that the expression of CYP7B was decreased ∼70% (Fig. 3) suggests that bile acid production by the alternative bile acid synthetic pathway (38Schwarz M.

Targeting subunits confer substrate specificity and localize PP1 to various subcellular compartments. Inhibitory subunits suppress PP1 activity. There are three PP1 inhibitory subunits: inhibitor 1 (I-1), DARPP-32, and inhibitor 2 (I-2) (1Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2146) Google Scholar, 2Lee E.Y.C.

These inhibitors are phosphorylated in response to many extracellular stimuli and allow PP1 to respond to various growth factors and hormones (3Oliver C.J. Shenolikar S. Frontiers Biosci. 1998; 3: 961-972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In rabbit skeletal muscle extract PP1 is found in both particulate and cytosolic fractions. PP1 in the particulate fraction is active, whereas in the cytosolic fraction it is inactive (1Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2146) Google Scholar, 2Lee E.Y.C.

The inactive cytosolic enzyme, a PP1·I-2 complex, is activated upon incubation with ATP/Mg and is hence called ATP/Mg-dependent PP1 (1Cohen P. Annu. Rev.

An earlier study found that most of the PP1 in brain extract is inactive and requires incubation with ATP/Mg to become active (13Yang S.D. Fong Y.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13464-13470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified enzyme is a PP1·I-2 complex, which is activated upon incubation with ATP/Mg in the presence of muscle GSK3. It was suggested that brain ATP/Mg-dependent PP1 is regulated in a manner similar to its muscle counterpart, via phosphorylation of I-2 (13Yang S.D. Fong Y.-L. J. Biol.

Thus, until now it has not been clear as to which kinase activates PP1·I-2 in the brain. Neuronal Cdc2-like protein kinase (NCLK) is a heterodimer of cyclin-dependent protein kinase 5 (Cdk5) and a neuronal-specific p25 regulatory subunit (reviewed in Ref. 14Lew J. Qi Z. Huang Q.-Q.

Cdk5, a member of the cyclin-dependent protein kinase family, is widely expressed in various tissues and cell lines (15Meyerson M. Enders G.H. Wu C.L. Su L.K. Gorka C. Nelson C. Harlow E. Tsai L.-H.

However, its kinase activity is detected only in terminally differentiated neurons where it is associated with a p25 subunit (16Lew J. Beaudette K. Litwin C.M.E. Wang J.H. J. Biol.

Herein we show that NCLK is complexed with PP1·I-2 in brain extract, phosphorylates I-2 on Thr72, and activates PP1·I-2. Our data suggest that NCLK is one of the kinases that activate PP1·I-2 in the central nervous system. Human I-2 cDNA plasmid in pT7T3D-pac vector (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) was subcloned into two different bacterial expression vectors: pET-9a (Promega, Madison, WI) and pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Baied'Urfe, Quebec, Canada). To subclone into the pET-9a vector Pfu DNA polymerase catalyzed 30 cycles polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out using I-2 cDNA as the template and forward (5′-AAAAAA CAT ATG GCG GCC TCG ACG G-3′) and reverse (5′-AAA AAA GGA TCC CTA TGA ACT TCG TAA TTT GTT TTG-3′) primers. The PCR condition was 95 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. A final 7-min extension at 72 °C was followed by a 10-min incubation with Taq polymerase (Promega) at 72 °C. The PCR product was ligated into a pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) and amplified. The I-2 cDNA insert from the pGEM-T Easy vector was excised by NdeI/BamHI and ligated into a NdeI/BamHI cloning site of the pET-9a vector. To subclone into pGEX-6P-1 vector, PCR was carried out using forward primer 5′-AAA AAA GGA TCC ATG GCG GCC TCG ACG G-3′ containing a BamHI site (underlined) and reverse primer 5′-AAA AAA GAA TTC CTA TGA ACT TCG TAA TTT GTT TTG-3′ containing an EcoRI site (underlined) as above, except Taq polymerase and pGEM-T Easy vector steps were excluded. The PCR product was excised withBamHI/EcoRI and ligated into aBamHI/EcoRI cloning site of the pGEX-6P-1 vector. Three forward primers, F1 (5′-AAA AAA GGA TCC ATG CAG AAA TAC GAG A-3′), F2 (5′-AAA AAA GGA TCC GGT GTG CCG AGT TCC GCC-3′), and F3 (5′-AAA AAA GGA TCC ATC GTG GCT CTG AAA C-3′), each containing a BamHI site (underlined) and two reverse primers R1 (5′-AAA AAA GTC GAC CTA GGC GGA ACT CGG CAC-3′), and R2 (5′-AAA AAA GTC GAC CTA GGG CGG ACA GAA GT-3′), each containing an SalI site (underlined) were used in the following combination to generate three cdk5 deletion mutants: cdk5-(1–48) (F1 and R1), cdk5-(42–292) (F2 and R2), and cdk5-(28–292) (F3 and R2). All PCR conditions were the same as described above except for using human cdk5 cDNA (15Meyerson M. Enders G.H. Wu C.L. Su L.K. Gorka C. Nelson C. Harlow E. Tsai L.-H.

Each PCR product was excised with BamHI/SalI and ligated into theBamHI/SalI cloning site of the pGEX-6P-1 vector. All recombinant plasmids were transfected into DH5α first followed by BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli cells. All cDNA clones were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. I-2 was purified from bacterial culture medium as described previously (25Huang H.-b. Horiuchi A. Watanabe T. Shih S.-R. Tsay H.-J. Li H.-C. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. J. Biol.

Overnight bacterial culture (10 ml) was diluted 100-fold in fresh medium and incubated with vigorous shaking at 37 °C. When theA600 of the medium reached ∼0.6, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. Shaking then continued for another 3 h at 37 °C. The medium was centrifuged, and the bacterial pellet was suspended in 100 ml of cold buffer A (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol) and protease inhibitor mixture (2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 5 mg/ml benzamidin). The suspension was subjected to freezing and thawing three times and then was sonicated three times, for 30 s each, using a probe sonicator. The sonicated suspension was centrifuged at 2.7 × 104 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was heated in a boiling water bath for 15 min. The heated sample was centrifuged, and the supernatant was loaded onto a DEAE-Sephacel column (2.3 × 23 cm) pre-equilibrated with buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT). The column was washed with buffer B until the effluent A280was less than 0.1 and then eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.5m NaCl in buffer B. Fractions containing I-2 were pooled, dialyzed against cold buffer B for 4 h, and then loaded onto an Affi-Gel blue (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) column (3 × 10 cm) previously equilibrated in buffer B. The column was washed and then eluted with a 250-ml linear gradient of NaCl (0–1 m) in buffer B. Fractions containing I-2 were combined and dialyzed against buffer A for 4 h and loaded onto a Q-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (1.5 × 5 cm) pre-equilibrated in buffer A. After washing the column with ∼50 ml of buffer A, the column-bound I-2 was eluted with a 50-ml linear gradient of NaCl (0–0.8m) in buffer A. Fractions containing I-2 were pooled and concentrated by dialysis against Aquacide III (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). The concentrated sample was dialyzed against buffer A, and stored frozen at −80 °C until used. NCLK (16Lew J. Beaudette K. Litwin C.M.E. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13383-13390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and phosphorylase kinase (26Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1777-1785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) were purified from fresh bovine brain and rabbit skeletal muscle extracts, respectively. PP1α was a generous gift from Dr. E. Y. C. Lee (New York Medical College). Phosphorylase b (Sigma-Aldrich Ltd., Oakville, Ontario, Canada) was phosphorylated by phosphorylase kinase using [γ-32P]ATP (26Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1777-1785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies against PP1 and I-2 were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) and Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), respectively. Polyclonal antibodies against the Cdk5 subunit of NCLK, MAPK (which cross-reacts with both brain-specific p43erk1 and p42erk2), casein kinase 1 (CK1), and casein kinase 2 (CK2) have been described previously (27Huang K. Paudel H.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5824-5829Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibody against the C-terminal region of GSK3β was prepared at Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). GSK3α was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Stephane Richard (Lady Davis Institute, Montreal) provided purified CK2. Various GST fusion proteins were purified from respective bacterial lysates as described (21Sobue K. Agarwal-Mawal A. Li W. Sun W. Miura Y Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16673-16680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The making of the NCLK synthetic peptide substrate has been described previously (22Paudel H.K. Lew J. Ali Z. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23512-23518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) substrate Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide) and inhibitory peptide PKI were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Ltd. The GSK3 peptide substrate KRREILSRRPSYR (28Wang Q.M. Fiol C.J. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Roach P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14566-14574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was synthesized at the peptide synthesis facility of the University of Calgary. This peptide was phosphorylated by PKA, and the phosphorylated peptide was purified by HPLC. The PP1·I-2 complex was reconstituted from PP1α and I-2 as described previously (8DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12144-12152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a 0.1-ml reconstitution mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml PP1, and 0.1 mg/ml I-2. The mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 60 min and loaded onto an Affi-Gel Blue column (∼1 ml) pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm EDTA. The column was washed with the equilibration buffer and fractions (0.5 ml each) were collected. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The reconstituted PP1·I-2 complex was recovered in flow-through fractions. I-2, PP1, GSK3, and CK2 concentrations were determined by Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad laboratories, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Concentrations of phosphorylase kinase and phosphorylase b were determined spectrophotometrically as described previously (26Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1777-1785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The concentration of NCLK is based on its activity (22Paudel H.K. Lew J. Ali Z. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23512-23518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Concentration of PKI was based on dry weight. Concentrations of NCLK and GSK3 peptide substrates were determined by amino acid analysis. Microcystin pull-down assay was carried out by mixing 50 μl of microcystin-Sepharose (Upstate Biotechnology) beads pre-equilibrated in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mmMnCl2, 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40 with 0.2 ml of combined gel filtration fractions from Fig.1 A. The mixture was incubated at 4 °C overnight with end-over-end shaking. The incubated mixture was centrifuged, and the recovered beads were washed three times with 0.5 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.2m NaCl, and 0.05% of Tween 20. The washed beads were mixed with 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled, and centrifuged, and 10 μl of the supernatant was analyzed by immunoblot analysis using the indicated antibody. To perform the GST pull-down assay 50 μl of glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich Ltd.) coated with the indicated GST fusion protein were mixed with 150 μl of the indicated protein solution and incubated overnight with end-over-end shaking at 4 °C. Incubated beads were washed four times with 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2 m NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20. The washed beads were mixed with 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled, and centrifuged, and 10 μl of the supernatant was analyzed by immunoblot analysis using the indicated antibody. ATP/Mg-dependent PP1 activity was assayed as described previously (9Park I.K. Roach P. Bondor J. Fox S.P. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 944-954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that the assay mixture also contained okadaic acid (Sigma-Aldrich Ltd.) (to inhibit PP2A) and PP2B inhibitor cypermethrin (Calbiochem). Samples were preincubated at 30 °C for 15 min in a mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm ATP, and 5 mmMgCl2. The assay was initiated by the addition of 10 μl of the preincubated sample to a vial containing 30 μl of the rest of the assay components. The final concentrations of the various components in the assay were 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.2% β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm caffeine, 0.5 mmMnCl2, 10 μm[32P]phosphorylase, 5 nm okadaic acid, 40 pm cypermethrin, 1 mm EGTA, and carryover preincubation mixture components. After 20 min at 30 °C, 10 μl of 50% trichloroacetic acid was added to the assay mixture. The assay mixture was cooled on ice for 10 min and centrifuged for 5 min using a bench top centrifuge. The supernatant (20 μl) was withdrawn, spotted onto a filter paper, and counted in a liquid scintillation counter to determine the amount of 32Pi released. NCLK, GSK3, and PKA activities were assayed by using their respective peptide substrates (27Huang K. Paudel H.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5824-5829Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). I-2 phosphorylation by NCLK was carried out in a reaction mixture containing 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm[γ-32P]ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml I-2, and 400 units/ml NCLK. Phosphorylation was initiated by the addition of NCLK to the mixture containing the rest of the assay components. After indicated time points at 30 °C aliquots were withdrawn, mixed with an equal volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and electrophoresed on a 12% SDS-gel. The gel was stained and destained, and the I-2 band in the gel was sliced out and counted in a liquid scintillation counter to determine the amount of radioactivity that was incorporated. I-2 phosphorylation by CK2 was carried out as above by using 10 μg/ml CK2 in the phosphorylation mixture. Over 4 h, CK2 incorporated 2.8 mol of phosphate/mol of I-2. CK2-phosphorylated I-2 was desalted by a Sephadex G-25 column and used to generate the data shown in Fig. 4. All procedures were performed at 4 °C. Fresh bovine brain (0.5 kg) was homogenized for 1 min in 1 liter of buffer C (20 mm MOPS (pH 7.4), 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 15 mm MgCl2), which contained protease inhibitor mixture. The homogenate was centrifuged at 104 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 105 × g for 45 min. The resulting clear supernatant was loaded onto a DEAE-Sephacel column (2.5 × 45 cm) previously equilibrated with buffer C. The flow-through fraction containing PP1 activity was loaded onto an SP-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (1 × 60 cm) pre-equilibrated with buffer C. The column was washed with buffer C and was eluted with 400 ml of a linear NaCl gradient (0–0.5 m) in buffer C. Fractions containing PP1 activity were pooled, dialyzed against buffer C, concentrated by dialysis against Aquacide III to ∼8 ml, and chromatographed through an FPLC Superose 12 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (2 × 70 cm) equilibrated and eluted with 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.15 m NaCl. Fractions 41–43, containing PP1 activity, were combined. A portion of the combined fractions was used to generate Figs. 1 B and 2, and the rest was loaded onto a hydroxylapatite column (1 × 15 cm) pre-equilibrated with buffer C. The column was washed with ∼40 ml of buffer C and eluted with a 50-ml linear gradient (0–0.5 m) of K2HPO4 (pH 7.4) in buffer C. I-2 was phosphorylated for 16 h by NCLK in a 0.7-ml reaction mixture containing 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 0.5 mm[γ-32P]ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml I-2, and 400 units/ml NCLK. Phosphorylated I-2 was desalted through a Sephadex G-25 column, lyophilized, dissolved in 0.2 ml of 50 mm NH4HCO3 (pH 8.0) containing 50 μg/ml trypsin, and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. The incubated tryptic digest was separated by a HPLC reverse phase column previously equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as described (26Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1777-1785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) using 0–40% acetonitrile gradient in 50 min. Radioactive fractions were lyophilized, dissolved in 50 mmNH4HCO3 containing 50 μg/ml of chymotrypsin, and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. The chymotryptic digest was lyophilized, dissolved in 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and loaded onto a DEAE-Sephacel column (∼2 ml) previously equilibrated in 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.2). The column was washed, and bound peptide was eluted with 0.3 m NaCl in the equilibration buffer. Fractions containing radioactivity were lyophilized, dissolved in 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, and chromatographed through an HPLC column as described above. Only one radioactive peptide was recovered. This peptide was sequenced at the Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology, University of Victoria by using a gas-phase micro-sequencer. In a previous study PP1·I-2 was found to be the predominant form of PP1 in brain extract (13Yang S.D. Fong Y.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13464-13470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To learn more about brain PP1·I-2, we chromatographed a fresh bovine brain extract through a DEAE-Sephacel column then an SP-Sepharose column. The effluent containing ATP/Mg-dependent PP1 activity was then analyzed by an FPLC Superose 12 gel filtration column. PP1 activity eluted from the gel filtration column as a broad peak (Fig.1 A). Immunoblot analyses of various gel filtration fractions (by using anti-PP1 or anti-I-2 antibodies) indicated that both PP1 and I-2 were present in column fractions containing PP1 activity (data not shown). The gel filtration analysis indicated that the molecular size of PP1·I-2 in Fig.1 A (fraction 42) is ∼450 kDa. Because the molecular size of PP1·I-2 is ∼70 kDa, these observations corroborate previous reports (2Lee E.Y.C. Zhang L. Zhao S. Wei Q. Zhang J. Qi Z.Q. Belmonte E.R. Frontiers Biosci. 1999; 4: 270-285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and indicate that PP1·I-2 is complexed with other protein (s) in the brain. As observed previously (13Yang S.D. Fong Y.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13464-13470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we found that PP1 has low activity in brain extract, is complexed with I-2, and is activated by preincubation with ATP/Mg (data not shown). These observations are consistent with a previous report (13Yang S.D. Fong Y.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13464-13470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and indicate that the PP1·I-2-activating factor is present in brain. An immunoblot analysis using anti-GSK3 antibody showed that GSK3 is present in Fig. 1 A column fractions (data not shown). To examine if GSK3 is responsible for ATP/Mg-dependent PP1·I-2 activation, we combined gel filtration fractions 41–43 containing peak PP1 activity from Fig.1 A. We preincubated an aliquot from the combined fractions with ATP/Mg the in the presence of the GSK3 inhibitor LiCl (29Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar) to block GSK3 action and assayed PP1 activity. Surprisingly, PP1 activity was only ∼29% inhibited (Fig. 1 B), although a kinase assay confirmed that LiCl had completely suppressed GSK3 activity in our samples (data not shown). These data suggested that the brain contains a kinase other than GSK3 that phosphorylates I-2 and activates PP1. To identify the PP1·I-2-activating kinase we included 2 mm Ca2+-chelator EGTA, or 50 μmPKA inhibitory peptide (PKI) in the preincubation mixture and assayed the Fig. 1 A combined column fractions. PP1 activity was approximately the same in samples preincubated in the presence of EGTA, PKI, or buffer control (data not shown). These data indicated that LiCl-insensitive ATP/Mg-dependent PP1 activation in Fig.1 B could not be due to the involvement of PKA or any Ca2+-dependent kinases (protein kinase C, calmodulin-dependent kinase 2, or phosphorylase kinase). MAPK phosphorylates I-2 in vitro (11Wang Q.M. Guan K.L. Roach P.J. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18352-18358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To determine if MAPK is a PP1·I-2-activating kinase, we analyzed Fig. 1 A column fractions by immunoblot analysis using anti-MAPK antibody. Our antibody that detected nanograms of MAPKs (p43erk1 and p42erk2) in brain extract failed to show any immunoreactivity (data not shown). By similar immunoblot analyses we determined that CK1 and CK2 were also absent in Fig. 1 Acolumn fractions (data not shown). These observations indicated that MAPK, CK1, and CK2 are not responsible for activating PP1·I-2 in Fig.1 B. I-2 Thr72 is follo"

Although Bcr and Tel have little in common, both contain oligomerization domains. To determine whether oligomerization alone is sufficient to activate c-Abl, we have generated and characterized an Abl protein that can be activated selectively with the chemical inducer of dimerization, AP1510. Mutant Abl proteins with one (c4F1) or two (c4F2) copies of the AP1510 binding motif (FKBP) transformed NIH 3T3 cells in a ligand-dependent manner with the c4F2 protein 60-fold more potent than c4F1. Both chimeric proteins exhibited ligand-dependent dimerization in vivo, suggesting that the increased transformation efficiency of the c4F2 mutant reflects more effective dimerization rather than formation of higher order oligomers. In the absence of ligand, c4F2-expresssing fibroblasts morphologically reverted and arrested in G1. In Ba/F3 cells, the c4F2 chimera exhibited ligand-dependent kinase activation, transformation to interleukin 3-independent growth, and relocalization of the fusion protein from nucleus to cytoplasm. These results demonstrate that dimerization alone is sufficient to activate the Abl kinase and provide a method to regulate conditionally c-Abl activity that will be useful for studying the normal physiological role of c-Abl and the mechanism of transformation and leukemogenesis. c-Abl is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that is activated in human leukemias by the fusion of Bcr or Tel sequences to the Abl NH2 terminus.

Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 179-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The in vivo mechanism of regulation of c-Abl kinase activity is not understood completely but appears to be distinct from that of Src family members. c-Src is regulated negatively by phosphorylation of the COOH-terminal tyrosine 527 by Csk and other cellular kinases and assumes an inactive conformation when this phosphotyrosine is bound by the Src SH21 domain in an intramolecular fashion (16Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar, 17Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). In this structure, the Src SH3 domain interacts with a single proline (Pro-250) in the linker region between the SH2 and catalytic domains. Activation of c-Src by dephosphorylation or mutation of Tyr-527 (18Piwinica-Worms H. Saunders K. Roberts T. Smith A. Cheng S.

In contrast, c-Abl is not tyrosine phosphorylated in its inactive state (21Jackson P. Baltimore D.

Biol. 1992; 12: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) does not activate Abl in vivo. Mutation of the Abl SH3 domain or a proline residue homologous to Src Pro-250 increases the catalytic activity of purified c-Abl (23Brasher B.B. Van Etten R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35631-35637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and induces cellular transformation (24Van Etten R.A. Debnath J. Zhou H. Casasnovas J.M.

Van Etten R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35631-35637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) or transphosphorylation by c-Src (5Plattner R. Kadlec L. DeMali K.A.

However, purified unphosphorylated c-Abl has high intrinsic kinase activity relative to inactive c-Src (23Brasher B.B. Van Etten R.A. J. Biol.

Muller A.J. Havlik M.H. Clark R. McCormick F. Witte O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5927-5931Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Pag/MSP23, a novel c-Abl SH3-binding protein, specifically suppresses c-Abl tyrosine kinase activity upon coexpression in vivo, suggesting it is a physiological inhibitor of c-Abl (6Wen S.-T. Van Etten R.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2456-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Naturally occurring oncogenic forms of Abl implicate another mechanism for activation of Abl kinase activity. The t(9;22) and t(9;12) chromosomal translocations in human leukemias activate Abl by fusing sequences from the Bcr and Tel proteins, respectively, to the NH2 terminus of c-Abl. Although Bcr, a cytoplasmic protein with RacGAP activity (28Diekmann D. Brill S. Garrett M.D. Totty N. Hsuan J. Monfries C. Hall C. Lim L. Hall A. Nature. 1991; 351: 400-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), and Tel, a nuclear transcription factor of the Ets family (29Golub T.R. Goga A. Barker G.F. Afar D.E.H. McLaughlin J. Bohlander S.K. Rowley J.D. Witte O.N. Gilliland D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4107-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), appear to have little in common, the translocated portions of both proteins contain domains implicated in self-association or oligomerization. Disruption of a leucine zipper-like coiled-coil domain in Bcr by insertion of proline-containing peptides (30McWhirter J.R. Galasso D.L. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7587-7595Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) or deletion of a helix-loop-helix oligomerization domain in Tel (29Golub T.R. Goga A. Barker G.F. Afar D.E.H. McLaughlin J. Bohlander S.K. Rowley J.D. Witte O.N. Gilliland D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4107-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) results in Abl fusion proteins that are defective for transformation and exhibit greatly decreased or absent in vivo kinase activity, as assessed by cellular phosphotyrosine levels. These observations suggest that oligomerization of c-Abl might be sufficient to activate Abl kinase activity. However, in the case of the Bcr-Abl fusion protein, additional sequences in Bcr are required for cellular transformation because Bcr-Abl mutants containing just the extreme NH2 terminus of Bcr including the amphipathic coiled-coil domain are defective for transformation of fibroblasts (30McWhirter J.R. Galasso D.L. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7587-7595Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 31Muller A.J. Young J.C. Pendergast A. Pondel M. Landau N.R. Littman D.R. Witte O.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). In support of this model of kinase activation, fusion of the estrogen receptor (ER) hormone binding domain to the COOH terminus of wild-type or SH3-deleted c-Abl generates chimeric proteins capable of inducing estradiol-dependent increases in cellular phosphotyrosine and transformation of fibroblasts (32Jackson P. Baltimore D. Picard D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2809-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), presumably mediated by hormone-dependent dimerization. Interestingly, in the absence of hormone, cells expressing both types of fusion exhibit low or absent phosphotyrosine levels and morphologically revert to an untransformed state, but they arrest in the cell cycle in early G1 (33Mattioni T. Jackson P.K. Bchini-Hooft van Huijsduinnen O. Picard D. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1325-1333PubMed Google Scholar). The fusion of ER to SH3-deleted Abl dominantly inactivates the transforming ability of this protein in the absence of ligand by formation of an inactive complex with Hsp90 (34Picard D. Salser S.J. Yamamoto K.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 1073-1080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The SH3-containing Abl-ER fusion protein requires increased time, new protein synthesis, and a higher estradiol dose for reinduction of transformation in reverted cells, implying that the Abl-ER fusion must overcome the inhibitory function of SH3 upon addition of hormone. The above studies collectively suggest that dimerization or oligomerization of c-Abl might be sufficient to activate Abl kinase activity in vivo. However, a requirement for additional functions in Bcr, Tel, or ER is difficult to exclude. In addition, the use of the Abl-ER fusion as a conditional form of Abl is compromised by the lack of COOH-terminal c-Abl sequences likely to be important for physiological function of Abl (35Schwartzberg P.L. Stall A.M. Hardin J.D. Bowdish K.S. Humaran T. Boast S. Harbison M.L. Robertson E.J. Goff S.P. Cell. 1991; 65: 1165-1176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) and by the pleiotropic effects of estradiol in mouse model systems. We have therefore employed a chemical inducer of dimerization (36Spencer D.M. Wandless T.J. Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1993; 262: 1019-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar) to investigate the effect of oligomerization on Abl kinase activity and transformation. This system utilizes a bifunctional adduct of the fungal immunosuppressive drug FK506, which is lipid-soluble, metabolically stable, and binds with subnanomolar affinity to its cellular receptor, FKBP12. FKBP12 is an abundant and ubiquitous 108-amino acid polypeptide with prolyl isomerase activity that binds to and inhibits calcineurin when complexed with FK506, resulting in immunosuppression by blocking T cell activation. Introduction of the FKBP module into a heterologous protein allows ligand-dependent homo- and heterodimerization of the target proteins (37Belshaw P.J. Ho S.N. Crabtree G.R. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4604-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Because the ligand is engineered to lack the calcineurin binding site, there is no inhibition of calcineurin. Using this system, we show here that dimerization of c-Abl is sufficient to activate c-Abl kinase activity in vivo and induce transformation of fibroblasts and hematopoietic cells. This system will be a useful tool for understanding the regulation of c-Abl and for investigating the primary consequences of activation of Abl kinasein vivo. The pPLcIV construct has been described previously (24Van Etten R.A. Debnath J. Zhou H. Casasnovas J.M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1977-1988PubMed Google Scholar). To make the pPLc4F1 and pPLc4F2 constructs, the cIVabl cDNA was opened at the unique StuI site at nucleotide 42 and fitted with a 12-base pair BamHI linker. This resulted in insertion of four amino acids (RGSA) at this position, which does not affect Abl kinase activity or regulation (data not shown). The XbaI-SpeI fragment from the plasmids pMF1E and pMF2E (36Spencer D.M. Wandless T.J. Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1993; 262: 1019-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar), containing one or two tandem copies of FKBP, was blunted with T4 polymerase, fitted with an 8-base pairBamHI linker, and cloned into the BamHI site in Abl to generate c4F1 and c4F2, respectively. The resulting fusion proteins have an additional three amino acids (underlined) on either side of the FKBP domain(s) (NH2-MGQQPGKVLGDQRRRGS(FKBP domain)GSAP … ). This vector was used to construct all the other mutants in this study, including the pcDNA3 and MINVneo (38Hawley R.G. Lieu F.H.L. Fong A.Z.C. Goldman S.J. Leonard J.P. Hawley T.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 795: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) vectors. The Abl P131L (24Van Etten R.A. Debnath J. Zhou H. Casasnovas J.M.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35631-35637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), and 1Q2Q3Q and ΔSal (12Wen S.-T. Jackson P.K. Van Etten R.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1583-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) mutations have been described previously. For coprecipitation studies, 293T cells were transfected with 5 μg of c4F1 K290M and 5 μg of c4F1 K290M ΔSal (or 5 μg of c4F2 K290M and 5 μg of c4F2 K290M ΔSal) in the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) using a modified calcium phosphate method (39DuBridge R.B. Tang P. Hsia H.C. Leong P.M. Miller J.H. Calos M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). For generation of retroviral stocks, 293T cells were transfected with 10 μg of pPL or MINVneo retroviral vector DNA and 5 μg of the ecotropic packaging construct pMCVecopac (39DuBridge R.B. Tang P. Hsia H.C. Leong P.M. Miller J.H. Calos M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). Supernatant was harvested 48 h later and titered by G418 resistance or Southern blot analysis of proviral copy number in transduced fibroblasts. To assay fibroblast transformation, NIH 3T3 cells were transduced with pPL retrovirus, plated in soft agar with or without 0.5 μm AP1510, and colonies counted at 21 days. To correct the soft agar colony numbers for differences in transduction efficiency, genomic DNA was isolated from an aliquot of the transduced cells and proviral copy number determined by Southern blotting, as described (24Van Etten R.A. Debnath J. Zhou H. Casasnovas J.M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1977-1988PubMed Google Scholar). Results were expressed as soft agar colonies/104 cells plated, normalized to one proviral copy/cell. To derive transformed fibroblast cell lines, pPL- or MINVneo-transduced NIH 3T3 cells were grown in monolayers in the presence of AP1510, populations of transformed cells were dislodged by squirting with medium, cloned by limiting dilution in the presence of 1 μm AP1510, and assayed for ligand-dependent morphological transformation. To determine the dose response of the clonal cell lines to AP1510, cells were plated in soft agar with increasing concentrations of AP1510 and scored for colony growth after 21 days. Ba/F3 cells were transduced with c4F2 MINVneo virus, selected for G418 resistance, and maintained in the absence of AP1510 and with supplemental WEHI-3B-conditioned medium as a source of IL-3. To determine the dose response of Ba/F3 cells expressing c4F2 to AP1510, cells were washed and replated in medium lacking IL-3 and containing increasing concentrations of AP1510. Viable cell counts were determined by trypan blue exclusion. Anti-Abl monoclonal antibodies (8E9, Pharmingen and Ab3, Oncogene Research), anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (4G10, Upstate Biotechnology), and rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch) were purchased from the respective vendors. Rabbit anti-Abl (GEX5) antiserum has been described previously (24Van Etten R.A. Debnath J. Zhou H. Casasnovas J.M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1977-1988PubMed Google Scholar). 293T cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl at pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 40 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% aprotinin), with 0.5 μm AP1510 included where indicated. Lysates were incubated overnight with polyclonal anti-Abl GEX5 antiserum, immune complexes collected with protein A-Sepharose, washed in RIPA buffer, high salt buffer (500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100), and low salt buffer (20 mm PIPES at pH 7.2), then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies, as described (24Van Etten R.A. Debnath J. Zhou H. Casasnovas J.M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1977-1988PubMed Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cell extracts were prepared in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 40 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% aprotinin, with 0.5 μm AP1510 added to extracts of cells grown in the presence of ligand. Cell lysates were layered onto a 2-ml 10–30% sucrose gradient in similar buffer without detergent and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 2.5 h at 4 °C. Fractions were collected from the bottom of the gradient, boiled in sample buffer under reducing conditions, fractionated by 5–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. Parallel gradients were run with visible molecular weight markers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). NIH 3T3 clones transformed by c4F1, c4F2, or c4F2 1Q2Q3Q were plated in the presence or absence of 0.5 μm AP1510. At various times after plating, cells were treated with trypsin, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed in 70% ethanol. Fixed cells were treated with RNase A, stained with propidium iodide, and the cellular DNA content analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting utilizing a FACScan flow cytometer and CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson). Ligand-dependent survival of cloned cell lines was analyzed by plating 105 cells/6-cm plate in the presence or absence of 0.5 μm AP1510 and counting viable cells at 24, 48, and 72 h after plating. Cell survival was also examined by terminal nucleotidyl transferase staining (In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, Roche) at the same time points, according to the manufacturer's instructions. To assess ligand-dependent activation of Abl kinase activity in vivo, Ba/F3 cells expressing c4F2 were grown for several generations in the absence of AP1510 and the presence of IL-3. Cells were washed extensively and plated at 106 cells/ml in medium lacking both IL-3 and AP1510. After 30 min, 0.5 μm AP1510 was added to the medium (time = 0). Cycloheximide (20 μg/ml) was added to duplicate samples. Whole cell extracts were prepared from 106 cells at various times post-AP1510 addition and processed for immunoblotting as described above. Ba/F3 cells expressing c4F2 or c4F2 1Q2Q3Q were deposited on glass coverslips by cytocentrifugation (Shandon) at 600 rpm for 1 min. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature, blocked with 5% normal donkey serum in phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with a mixture of 1 μg/ml each of the mouse anti-Abl monoclonal antibodies 8E9 and Ab3, and stained with rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody. Coverslips were mounted with Fluoromount G (Fisher Scientific) and photographed on a Zeiss epifluorescence microscope with Fuji Neopan ASA 1600 black and white film. To create a c-Abl molecule that could be inducibly dimerized by addition of an exogenous ligand, we utilized the FKBP oligomerization system. This system is comprised of two parts: a membrane-diffusible bivalent ligand and a ligand binding domain that is fused to the protein of interest. We constructed the chimeric Abl-FKBP molecule by inserting one or two tandem copies of the FKBP domain after the initial 14 amino acids of murine type IV (myristoylated) c-Abl (Fig. 1 A), generating c4F1 and c4F2 chimeric proteins (Fig. 1, B and D). The c-Abl-FKBP chimeras were predicted to form homo-oligomers in the presence of AP1510. To confirm the ligand-dependent oligomerizatioin of the Abl-FKBP chimeras, we generated two additional constructs that were truncated at the COOH-terminal SalI site, c4F1 K290M ΔSal and c4F2 K290M ΔSal (Fig. 1, C and E). We introduced the K290M kinase-inactivating point mutation into both full-length and truncated chimeras to eliminate the possibility of oligomerization mediated by tyrosine phosphorylation and SH2 binding. The full-length and truncated constructs were coexpressed in 293T cells and immunoprecipitated with an antibody (GEX5) that recognizes only the full-length protein. In the presence of AP1510, the c4F1 truncation mutant demonstrated weak coprecipitation with the full-length version, whereas the c4F2 truncation mutant exhibited stronger coassociation (Fig. 2). No coprecipitation was seen in the absence of AP1510. The Abl-FKBP chimeras therefore self-associatein vivo in a ligand-dependent fashion. To determine the consequences of oligomerization on c-Abl kinase activity, we tested the ability of the c4F1 and c4F2 chimeras to transform fibroblasts. NIH 3T3 cells were transduced with retroviruses expressing wild-type c-Abl, c4F1, or c4F2 and plated in soft agar with or without AP1510. A kinase-inactive mutant (c4F2 K290R) and a constitutively active Abl SH3 domain mutant (c4F2 P131L) were included as controls. Addition of the FKBP domain to c-Abl resulted in ligand-dependent soft agar colony formation (Fig. 3 A). The c4F1 construct produced about 10-fold more soft agar colonies in the presence of AP1510 than wild-type c-Abl, whereas the c4F2 construct was even more potent and produced more than 100 more colonies than wild-type c-Abl, comparable to transformation by Abl with the activating SH3 point mutation (c4 P131L). Both c4F1 and c4F2 showed only background levels of transformation in the absence of AP1510. c4F2 K290R (Fig. 1 F), a chimera with an inactive kinase domain, was nontransforming under all conditions (Fig. 3 A), demonstrating that Abl-FKBP was not acting merely to induce the dimerization of another pro-oncogenic protein that bound to Abl. Fusion of the ER hormone binding domain to SH3-deleted Abl dominantly inactivates the transforming ability of this kinase in the absence of estradiol (32Jackson P. Baltimore D. Picard D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2809-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In contrast, the c4F2 P131L construct (Fig.1 G) was equally transforming in the presence or absence of ligand (Fig. 3 A). This suggests that addition of the FKBP domain does not grossly affect Abl kinase activity or function in the absence of ligand. We also tested the requirement for several functional domains of Abl for ligand-dependent transformation by the Abl-FKBP chimera. An Abl-FKBP chimera with inactivation of the three COOH-terminal nuclear localization signals (c4F2 1Q2Q3Q, Fig. 1 H) was still transforming in the presence of ligand but somewhat less efficient than the parental c4F2, confirming previous observations that nuclear localization increases transformation by oncogenic forms of Abl (12Wen S.-T. Jackson P.K. Van Etten R.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1583-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). c-Abl can undergo intermolecular autophosphorylation at Tyr-412 in the catalytic domain that stimulates kinase activity over 8-fold (23Brasher B.B. Van Etten R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35631-35637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mutation of Tyr-412 to phenylalanine (c4F2 Y412F, Fig. 1 I) completely abolished ligand-dependent transformation by the Abl-FKBP chimera (Fig. 3 A), suggesting that dimerization-induced autophosphorylation is critical for transformation by this fusion protein. We isolated transformed clones stably expressing c4F1 or c4F2 by limiting dilution in the presence of AP1510 and assessed the transformation dose response to AP1510 for each cell line. Both c4F1 and c4F2 cell lines showed a sigmoidal response to increasing concentrations of AP1510 (Fig. 3 B). The half-maximal concentration of AP1510 for c4F1 was ∼2.5-fold higher than for c4F2 (90 μm versus 200 μm). Unlike the c4F1 chimera, the c4F2 chimera can theoretically form higher order oligomers such as homotrimers or homotetramers. The increased transformation ability of the c4F2 chimera relative to c4F1 could be a result of this property or might simply reflect more efficient dimerization at a given concentration of ligand. To examine the ligand-dependent association of the Abl-FKBP chimerain vivo, lysates from the c4F1 and c4F2 cell lines grown in the presence or absence of AP1510 were analyzed by sucrose gradient centrifugation. The c4F2 protein sedimented at about 300 kDa apparent molecular mass when cells were grown in AP1510 but sedimented at about 150 kDa from cells grown without AP1510 (Fig.4 A). The change in sedimentation pattern is consistent with c4F2"

Therefore, the present study characterized the physiological expression of PBCV-1 topoisomerase II and individual reaction steps catalyzed by the enzyme. Results indicate that the topoisomerase II gene is widely distributed among Chlorellaviruses and that the protein is expressed 60–90 min after viral infection of algal cells. Furthermore, the enzyme has an extremely high DNA cleavage activity that sets it apart from all known eukaryotic type II topoisomerases. Levels of DNA scission generated by the viral enzyme are ∼30 times greater than those observed with human topoisomerase IIα. The high levels of cleavage are not due to inordinately tight enzyme-DNA binding or to impaired DNA religation. Thus, they most likely reflect an elevated forward rate of scission.

Thus, it appears that most viruses rely on host enzymes to modulate the topological state of their chromosomes.There are some notable exceptions.

PBCV-1 topoisomerase II has high amino acid sequence identity with several other type II enzymes, including human topoisomerase IIα (46%) (23Li Y. Lu Z. Sun L. Ropp S. Kutish G.F. Rock D.L.

Recombinant PBCV-1 topoisomerase II (purified from yeast) displays enzymatic properties typical of eukaryotic type II enzymes; it relaxes, catenates, and decatenates double-stranded DNA substrates in an ATP-dependent manner (25Lavrukhin O.V.

Furthermore, it is not known whether the viral topoisomerase II has any catalytic features that distinguish it from cellular type II enzymes. To address these fundamental issues, the present study characterized the physiological expression of PBCV-1 topoisomerase II and examined individual reaction steps catalyzed by the enzyme. Results indicate that PBCV-1 topoisomerase II is synthesized in vivo post-infection. Moreover, the enzyme has an extremely high DNA cleavage activity that sets it apart from all known eukaryotic type II topoisomerases.DISCUSSIONViruses that infect eukaryotic cells commonly rely on host proteins to support fundamental DNA processes. Consequently, it is rare that they encode their own DNA topoisomerases. Nonetheless, poxviruses encode a type I topoisomerase (7Bauer W.R. Ressner E.C. Kates J. Patzke J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Virus Genes. 1999; 18: 243-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), contain open reading frames that are predicted to encode type II topoisomerases. One common feature of these viruses is that they have large double-stranded DNA genomes, ranging from 170 kb in African swine fever virus (69Yanez R.J. Rodriguez J.M. Nogal M.L. Yuste L. Enriquez C. Rodriguez J.F. Vinuela E. Virology. 1995; 208: 249-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) to 330 kb in PBCV-1 (70Rohozinski J. Girton L.E. Van Etten J.L. Virology. 1989; 168: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Furthermore, three have a similar genome structure; poxviruses (71Geshelin P. Berns K.I. J. Mol.

Virology. 1994; 202: 1079-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) contain linear nonpermuted double-stranded DNA genomes with inverted repeat regions adjacent to covalently closed hairpin termini. In contrast, the Chilo iridescent virus genome is circularly permuted and terminally redundant (75Delius H. Darai G. Flugel R.M. J.

Virol. 1987; 68: 2717-2722Crossref Google Scholar).Of the three viruses with predicted topoisomerase II genes, only PBCV-1 has been shown to encode an active type II enzyme (25Lavrukhin O.V. Fortune J.M. Wood T.G. Burbank D.E. Van Etten J.L. Osheroff N. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6915-6921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The original study on PBCV-1 topoisomerase II demonstrated that the enzyme could be produced in a yeast recombinant system (25Lavrukhin O.V. Fortune J.M. Wood T.G. Burbank D.E. Van Etten J.L. Osheroff N. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6915-6921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) but did not determine whether the protein actually is expressed following viral infection of algal cells. As determined in the present work, the PBCV-1 topoisomerase II gene is transcribed shortly after infection. The protein is synthesized 60–90 min post-infection and remains throughout the life cycle of the virus. Thus, PBCV-1 topoisomerase II is the first viral type II enzyme found to be expressed during the life cycle of a virus that infects eukaryotic cells.It is not clear why PBCV-1 carries its own topoisomerase II gene. The fact that type II topoisomerases are uncommon among viruses implies that the enzyme plays a unique and important role. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that the topoisomerase II gene is widely distributed among Chlorella viruses. At the present time, the physiological functions of the viral enzyme have not been defined. Circumstantial evidence indicates that initial replication of the PBCV-1 chromosome probably takes place in the nucleus (28Van Etten J.L. Meints R.H. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 447-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The lack of an obvious nuclear localization signal in the viral enzyme (due to the C-terminal truncation) (25Lavrukhin O.V. Fortune J.M. Wood T.G. Burbank D.E. Van Etten J.L. Osheroff N. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6915-6921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), together with the fact that replication begins ∼60 min following infection (28Van Etten J.L. Meints R.H. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 447-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) (just as synthesis of PBCV-1 topoisomerase II is beginning), makes it doubtful that the type II enzyme is required for the early stages of this process. More likely, PBCV-1 topoisomerase II functions in the late stages of viral replication or packaging, both of which take place in the cytoplasm (28Van Etten J.L. Meints R.H. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 447-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Finally, the high DNA cleavage activity of the enzyme suggests a potential role for PBCV-1 topoisomerase II in viral recombination. Unfortunately, until molecular techniques become available that allow specific manipulation of the PBCV-1 genome, the precise role(s) of the enzyme in the virus life cycle will remain unknown.Because viral enzymes often display unique properties, the present study characterized individual reaction steps of the PBCV-1 topoisomerase II catalytic cycle to determine whether the protein has features that differentiate it from cellular type II enzymes. One striking difference was observed. The concentration of DNA cleavage complexes formed by PBCV-1 topoisomerase II is dramatically higher than typically observed with eukaryotic type II enzymes. Compared with human topoisomerase IIα, the viral enzyme generates levels of DNA cleavage that are ∼30 times higher. This increased scission is not due to an excessively tight enzyme-DNA binding or to an impaired DNA religation activity. Moreover, preliminary studies indicate that the viral enzyme does not cleave DNA at a wider distribution of sites than human topoisomerase IIα. 4J. M. Fortune and N. Osheroff, unpublished data. These findings suggest that the high level of scission generated by PBCV-1 topoisomerase II reflects an exceptionally robust forward DNA cleavage reaction.The molecular basis for the high DNA cleavage activity of PBCV-1 topoisomerase II is not known. It may be related to the C-terminal truncation of the viral enzyme. This highly charged region of eukaryotic type II topoisomerases has been proposed to play an autoinhibitory function (78Corbett A.H. Fernald A.W. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2090-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 79Cardenas M.E. Walter R. Hanna D. Gasser S.M. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 533-543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, increased DNA scission may result from subtle differences in the active site of PBCV-1 topoisomerase II. Evidence for such a difference comes from divalent cation experiments. The DNA cleavage reaction of the viral enzyme is supported by a broader spectrum of divalent cations than previously observed for any eukaryotic type II topoisomerase.Amino acid sequence alterations that may contribute to increased cleavage are not obvious. The primary structure of PBCV-1 topoisomerase II is ∼45% identical to a variety of eukaryotic type II enzymes, including budding yeast, fission yeast, and Drosophilatopoisomerase II, as well as human topoisomerase IIα and IIβ (23Li Y. Lu Z. Sun L. Ropp S. Kutish G.F. Rock D.L. Van Etten J.L. Virology. 1997; 237: 360-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar,25Lavrukhin O.V. Fortune J.M. Wood T.G. Burbank D.E. Van Etten J.L. Osheroff N. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6915-6921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Most of the highly conserved charged residues in the DNA binding/cleavage domain of eukaryotic type II enzymes are present in the viral enzyme. However, several positions that contain hydrophobic or neutral amino acids in most eukaryotic enzymes are replaced by charged residues in PBCV-1 topoisomerase II.In summary, PBCV-1 topoisomerase II is the first viral type II enzyme found to be expressed following infection of a eukaryotic host. Furthermore, levels of DNA scission generated by this enzyme are significantly greater than previously observed for eukaryotic type II topoisomerases. The extraordinary DNA cleavage activity of PBCV-1 topoisomerase II provides a unique model in which to study the catalytic functions of type II enzymes. Topoisomerases play key roles in virtually every cellular DNA process, including replication, transcription, recombination, and chromosome segregation (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar, 2Wang J.C. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 3: 107-144Crossref Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 3Nitiss J.L. Biochim. Biophys.

Thus, it appears that most viruses rely on host enzymes to modulate the topological state of their chromosomes. There are some notable exceptions. A few viruses with large double-stranded DNA genomes contain topoisomerase genes. For example, poxviruses (including vaccinia) encode a type I topoisomerase (7Bauer W.R. Ressner E.C. Kates J.

PBCV-1 topoisomerase II is the smallest known type II topoisomerase, with a protomer molecular mass of 120 kDa compared to 160–180 kDa for eukaryotic enzymes (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev.

PBCV-1 topoisomerase II has high amino acid sequence identity with several other type II enzymes, including human topoisomerase IIα (46%) (23Li Y. Lu Z. Sun L. Ropp S. Kutish G.F. Rock D.L.

Recombinant PBCV-1 topoisomerase II (purified from yeast) displays enzymatic properties typical of eukaryotic type II enzymes; it relaxes, catenates, and decatenates double-stranded DNA substrates in an ATP-dependent manner (25Lavrukhin O.V.

Although PBCV-1 carries its own topoisomerase II gene, it is not known whether the protein actually is expressed following viral infection of host cells. Furthermore, it is not known whether the viral topoisomerase II has any catalytic features that distinguish it from cellular type II enzymes. To address these fundamental issues, the present study characterized the physiological expression of PBCV-1 topoisomerase II and examined individual reaction steps catalyzed by the enzyme. Results indicate that PBCV-1 topoisomerase II is synthesized in vivo post-infection. Moreover, the enzyme has an extremely high DNA cleavage activity that sets it apart from all known eukaryotic type II topoisomerases. DISCUSSIONViruses that infect eukaryotic cells commonly rely on host proteins to support fundamental DNA processes. Consequently, it is rare that they encode their own DNA topoisomerases. Nonetheless, poxviruses encode a type I topoisomerase (7Bauer W.R. Ressner E.C. Kates J. Patzke J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The original study on PBCV-1 topoisomerase II demonstrated that the enzyme could be produced in a yeast recombinant system (25Lavrukhin O.V. Fortune J.M. Wood T.G. Burbank D.E. Van Etten J.L. Osheroff N. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6915-6921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) but did not determine whether the protein actually is expressed following viral infection of algal cells. As determined in the present work, the PBCV-1 topoisomerase II gene is transcribed shortly after infection. The protein is synthesized 60–90 min post-infection and remains throughout the life cycle of the virus. Thus, PBCV-1 topoisomerase II is the first viral type II enzyme found to be expressed during the life cycle of a virus that infects eukaryotic cells.It is not clear why PBCV-1 carries its own topoisomerase II gene. The fact that type II topoisomerases are uncommon among viruses implies that the enzyme plays a unique and important role. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that the topoisomerase II gene is widely distributed among Chlorella viruses. At the present time, the physiological functions of the viral enzyme have not been defined. Circumstantial evidence indicates that initial replication of the PBCV-1 chromosome probably takes place in the nucleus (28Van Etten J.L. Meints R.H. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 447-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The lack of an obvious nuclear localization signal in the viral enzyme (due to the C-terminal truncation) (25Lavrukhin O.V. Fortune J.M. Wood T.G. Burbank D.E. Van Etten J.L. Osheroff N. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6915-6921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), together with the fact that replication begins ∼60 min following infection (28Van Etten J.L. Meints R.H. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 447-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) (just as synthesis of PBCV-1 topoisomerase II is beginning), makes it doubtful that the type II enzyme is required for the early stages of this process. More likely, PBCV-1 topoisomerase II functions in the late stages of viral replication or packaging, both of which take place in the cytoplasm (28Van Etten J.L. Meints R.H. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 447-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Finally, the high DNA cleavage activity of the enzyme suggests a potential role for PBCV-1 topoisomerase II in viral recombination. Unfortunately, until molecular techniques become available that allow specific manipulation of the PBCV-1 genome, the precise role(s) of the enzyme in the virus life cycle will remain unknown.Because viral enzymes often display unique properties, the present study characterized individual reaction steps of the PBCV-1 topoisomerase II catalytic cycle to determine whether the protein has features that differentiate it from cellular type II enzymes. One striking difference was observed. The concentration of DNA cleavage complexes formed by PBCV-1 topoisomerase II is dramatically higher than typically observed with eukaryotic type II enzymes. Compared with human topoisomerase IIα, the viral enzyme generates levels of DNA cleavage that are ∼30 times higher. This increased scission is not due to an excessively tight enzyme-DNA binding or to an impaired DNA religation activity. Moreover, preliminary studies indicate that the viral enzyme does not cleave DNA at a wider distribution of sites than human topoisomerase IIα. 4J. M. Fortune and N. Osheroff, unpublished data. These findings suggest that the high level of scission generated by PBCV-1 topoisomerase II reflects an exceptionally robust forward DNA cleavage reaction.The molecular basis for the high DNA cleavage activity of PBCV-1 topoisomerase II is not known. It may be related to the C-terminal truncation of the viral enzyme. This highly charged region of eukaryotic type II topoisomerases has been proposed to play an autoinhibitory function (78Corbett A.H. Fernald A.W. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2090-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 79Cardenas M.E. Walter R. Hanna D. Gasser S.M. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 533-543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, increased DNA scission may result from subtle differences in the active site of PBCV-1 topoisomerase II. Evidence for such a difference comes from divalent cation experiments. The DNA cleavage reaction of the viral enzyme is supported by a broader spectrum of divalent cations than previously observed for any eukaryotic type II topoisomerase.Amino acid sequence alterations that may contribute to increased cleavage are not obvious. The primary structure of PBCV-1 topoisomerase II is ∼45% identical to a variety of eukaryotic type II enzymes, including budding yeast, fission yeast, and Drosophilatopoisomerase II, as well as human topoisomerase IIα and IIβ (23Li Y.

Most of the highly conserved charged residues in the DNA binding/cleavage domain of eukaryotic type II enzymes are present in the viral enzyme. However, several positions that contain hydrophobic or neutral amino acids in most eukaryotic enzymes are replaced by charged residues in PBCV-1 topoisomerase II.In summary, PBCV-1 topoisomerase II is the first viral type II enzyme found to be expressed following infection of a eukaryotic host. Furthermore, levels of DNA scission generated by this enzyme are significantly greater than previously observed for eukaryotic type II topoisomerases. The extraordinary DNA cleavage activity of PBCV-1 topoisomerase II provides a unique model in which to study the catalytic functions of type II enzymes.

https://openalex.org/W2071184047,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) gene expression is regulated by upstream promoter elements, including the peri-Ets (pets) site, which mediate enhancer stimulation following treatment with the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). We previously showed that the oncoprotein DEK binds to the pets site in a site-specific manner. In this report, we show that binding to the HIV-2 pets site is modulated by treatment of U937 monocytic cells with TPA, an activator of protein kinase C. TPA treatment resulted in a reduction in the levels of DEK and the formation of a faster migrating pets complex in gel shift assays. We show further that the actions of TPA on pets binding can be duplicated by phosphatase treatment of nuclear proteins and is blocked with okadaic acid, a protein phospatase-2A (PP2A) inhibitor. Finally, we demonstrate that ectopic expression of the catalytic domain of PP2A can activate the HIV-2 enhancer/promoter alone or in synergy with TPA, an effect mediated in part through the pets site. These results suggest that, through an interaction with the protein kinase C pathway, PP2A is strongly involved in regulating HIV-2 enhancer-mediated transcription. This is a consequence of its effects on DEK expression and binding to the pets site, as well as its effects on other promoter elements. These findings have implications not only for HIV-2 transcription but also for multiple cellular processes involving DEK or PP2A.

We show further that the actions of TPA on pets binding can be duplicated by phosphatase treatment of nuclear proteins and is blocked with okadaic acid, a protein phospatase-2A (PP2A) inhibitor. Finally, we demonstrate that ectopic expression of the catalytic domain of PP2A can activate the HIV-2 enhancer/promoter alone or in synergy with TPA, an effect mediated in part through the pets site. These results suggest that, through an interaction with the protein kinase C pathway, PP2A is strongly involved in regulating HIV-2 enhancer-mediated transcription. This is a consequence of its effects on DEK expression and binding to the pets site, as well as its effects on other promoter elements. These findings have implications not only for HIV-2 transcription but also for multiple cellular processes involving DEK or PP2A. human immunodeficiency virus 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate peri-Ets okadaic acid protein phosphatase-2A catalytic subunit of PP2A protein kinase C long terminal repeat okadaic acid phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate protein phosphatase-1 dithiothreitol electrophoretic mobility shift assay potato acid phosphatase chloramphenicol acetyltransferase phorbol 12,13-didecanoate Transcriptional regulation of the genome of human immunodeficiency virus type-2 (HIV-2)1 is mediated by cellular factors acting via response elements located in the 5′ long terminal repeat (LTR) (1Markovitz D.M.

One such response element in the HIV-2 LTR, denoted pets (peri-Ets), is a TG-rich site found between two Elf-1 binding sites (PuB1 and PuB2) (2Markovitz D.M. Smith M.J. Hilfinger J. Hannibal M.C.

Recently, our laboratory demonstrated that the oncoprotein DEK binds to the HIV-2 pets response element in a site-specific manner (6Fu G.K. Grosveld G. Markovitz D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Virol. 1993; 67: 4448-4453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the roles of various kinases activated by these agents, such as protein kinase C (PKC) and IκB kinase, in regulation of the HIV-1 LTR have been well documented, little is known about the actions of specific phosphatases on LTR activity. A significant portion of the intracellular serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatase activity of many cells is due to phosphoprotein phosphatase-2A (PP2A) activity (19Schonthal A.H. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D1262-D1273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PP2A holoenzyme is composed of three subunits denoted A (65-kDa scaffold subunit), B (55-kDa regulatory subunit), and C (37-kDa catalytic subunit) (19Schonthal A.H. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D1262-D1273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ogris E. Gibson D.M. Pallas D.C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). These subunits associate to form an AC dimer (the core enzyme) or an ABC trimer (holoenzyme), each of which has different substrate specificities. Direct regulation of PP2A activity occurs in the replication cycle of some DNA tumor viruses such as simian virus 40 (SV40) and polyoma virus, which both encode antigens, small-t and middle-T, respectively, that form complexes with PP2A core enzyme (21Yang S.I. Lickteig R.L. Estes R. Rundell K. Walter G. Mumby M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1988-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). These complexes, although not transforming on their own, facilitate or enhance the cellular transformation processes caused by these viruses. Recently, a report by Reudiger et al. (22Ruediger R. Brewis N. Ohst K. Walter G. Virology. 1997; 238: 432-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) provided direct evidence for the involvement of PP2A in HIV-1 LTR regulation. In these experiments, increasing the ratio of PP2A core enzyme to holoenzyme by using an N-terminal mutant of the A subunit of PP2A inhibitedTat-stimulated HIV-1 transcription and virus production. Additional evidence that PP2A functions in regulating HIV LTR activity is provided by studies with okadaic acid (OKA), a marine sponge toxin that specifically inhibits protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) and PP2A. OKA has been reported to activate the HIV-1 LTR by inducing NF-κB nuclear translocation and binding to its cognate sites (23Rieckmann P. Thevenin C. Kehrl J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 24Li M. Damuni Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 1023-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 25Thevenin C.

Rodriguez M.S. Michelson S. Virelizier J.L. Virology. 1995; 208: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). OKA-induced Sp1-mediated transcription is further enhanced by the presence of Tat (26Vlach J. Garcia A. Jacque J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Michelson S. Virelizier J.L. Virology. 1995; 208: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 27Chun R.F. Semmes O.J. Neuveut C. Jeang K.T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2615-2629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies with OKA suggest the involvement of one or more phosphatases (PP2A or PP1) in regulating transcriptional activation of the HIV-1 LTR. Despite the observation by our laboratory that the HIV-2 pets site mediates activation of the promoter in response to several mitogenic and differentiating agents, DEK binding appears to be constitutive. This leads to questions of how activation through this HIV-2 element is regulated. In this paper, we demonstrate that TPA activation of the monocytic cell line U937 alters DEK protein levels and binding to the pets response element through a signaling cascade involving PKC and PP2A. We also show that ectopic expression of the catalytic domain of PP2A can increase the basal activity of the HIV-2 enhancer and enhances TPA-mediated activation of the promoter, acting largely through the pets response element. Finally, we show that the effects of TPA or PP2Ac on the HIV-2 enhancer can be blocked by treatment with the PP2A inhibitor OKA. Thus, PP2A plays an integral role in modulating transcription of the AIDS-causing retrovirus HIV-2. Human U937 monocytic cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), penicillin (50 units/ml), streptomycin (50 µg/ml), andl-glutamine (2 mm). Nuclear protein extracts from U937 monocytic cells were prepared using a modification of the method of Dignam (28Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar). All steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells were washed once with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and twice with 2 ml of buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, and 1× Complete protease inhibitor solution (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). The cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (15 µl of buffer A/107 cells + 0.01% Nonidet P-40) for 5 min. The nuclei were pelleted and the supernatant discarded. The nuclear membrane was disrupted by resuspension of the pellet in 10 µl of buffer C/107 cells (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 1× Complete mini protease inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) and gentle rocking of the tubes for 10 min followed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant containing the nuclear proteins was removed and diluted by the addition of 5 µl of modified buffer D (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 1× Complete mini protease inhibitor)/µl of buffer C. Protein concentration was quantitated using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA). For EMSA, 200 ng of probe DNA (sense 5′-TAT ACT TGG TCA GGG CGA ATT CTA ACT AAC AGA-3′) with a pets site (bold letters) and mutated PuB2 site was end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England BioLabs). Nuclear extract (5–10 µg) was incubated with 2 × 104 cpm of pets probe in reaction buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 4% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm DTT, 2 µg of bovine serum albumin, and 1.5 µg of poly dI·dC in a final reaction volume of 20 µl at room temperature for 15 min. For competitive binding reactions, 200 ng of cold pets probe or an oligonucleotide (5′-TAT ACT AGATCT GGG CGA ATT CTA ACT AAC AGA-3′) containing a mutated pets site (mutated bases are underlined) was added. Material from the binding reactions was separated by electrophoresis at room temperature in a 4% native acrylamide gel at 116 V for 3 h in TGE buffer (50 mm Tris base, 380 mm glycine, 2 mm EDTA, 50 µm β-mercaptoethanol). The gel was then dried and autoradiographed. Potato acid phosphatase (PAP) assays were performed as described by Pongubala (29Pongubala J.M. Van Beveren C. Nagulapalli S. Klemsz M.J. McKercher S.R. Maki R.A. Atchison M.L. Science. 1993; 259: 1622-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 unit of PAP Type II (Sigma) was mixed with 10 µg of nuclear extract, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 100 mm KCl in a final reaction volume of 20 µl. PAP, heat-inactivated by boiling for 5–10 min, was used in control reactions. The PAP reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 15–60 min, and 6 µl was used in binding reactions with 5 × 104cpm of pets probe labeled using Klenow polymerase. EMSA was performed as described above. 40 µg of nuclear extract was mixed with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading dye, denatured by boiling for 5 min, and separated by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by semi-dry blot transfer (FisherBiotech, FB-SDB-2020) at 250 mA for 1.5 h. The membrane was blocked with TBS-T (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% Tween 20) + 5% dry milk for 1 h at room temperature. The blot was then incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal DEK antiserum (gift of Gerard Grosveld) in TBS-T + 5% dry milk for 1 h at room temperature followed by three 15-min washes with TBS-T. Secondary antibody, a 1:10,000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugated IgG (H+L) (Life Technologies, Inc.), was added and the blot incubated for 45 min in TBS-T + 5% milk at room temperature. After the membrane was washed as described above, the secondary antibody was detected using Supersignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) as instructed. For some Western blots, the anti-DEK primary antibody was detected using a 1:8000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase-conjugated IgG (Sigma) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium (BCIP/NBT) alkaline phosphatase substrate (Sigma). The shift-Western assay was performed as described previously (30Demczuk S. Harbers M. Vennstrom B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2574-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, 30 µg of nuclear extract was used in binding reactions followed by EMSA on a 5% native acrylamide gel. Following separation of the nucleoprotein complexes, the gel and nitrocellulose membrane were soaked in transfer buffer (39 mm glycine, 48 mmTris base, 20% (v/v) methanol) with 0.1% SDS for 30 min at room temperature. The gel, Whatman 3MM filter papers, and membranes were stacked as described (30Demczuk S. Harbers M. Vennstrom B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2574-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell), and probe was transferred to DE-81 paper (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a semi-dry blotting unit (FisherBiotech, FB-SDB-2020) at 300 mA for 2.5–3 h. The nitrocellulose membrane was subsequently immunoblotted using a rabbit polyclonal α-DEK primary antibody detected by ECL after staining with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The DE-81 paper was dried and autoradiographed. The blot and autoradiograph were aligned, and the positions of the bands in each were compared. U937 cells were treated with 5 or 50 nm OKA (Calbiochem) only or pretreated for 30–45 min with OKA prior to stimulation with 32 nm TPA (Sigma). EMSA and DEK Western blots were performed 24 h post-treatment. U937 cells were treated with only 2 µm staurosporine or 10 µm Gö6983 (Calbiochem) or pretreated for 30–45 min prior to stimulation with 32 nm TPA. 24 h post-treatment, nuclear extract was prepared and EMSA was performed. HIV-2-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (HIV-2-CAT) and HIV-2-luciferase (HIV-2-luc) plasmids contain enhancer/promoter sequences (−556/+156) from the HIV-2 ROD strain (31Emerman M. Guyader M.

All HIV-2 site-specific mutant reporter plasmids were generated by the gap-heteroduplex method from wild-type HIV-2 enhancer (2Markovitz D.M. Smith M.J. Hilfinger J. Hannibal M.C. Petryniak B. Nabel G.J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5479-5484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pCMV5 PP2Ac (gift of Marc Mumby) constitutively expresses the catalytic domain of PP2A under the control of the CMV promoter. All plasmids were prepared using the Concert Maxiprep kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). 5 µg of reporter plasmid, alone or in combination with PP2Ac expression vector, was combined with empty pCMV5 vector for a total of 25 µg of total DNA. U937 undergoing logarithmic growth were harvested at 5 × 105 cells/ml, washed once with 50 ml of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium, and resuspended to a concentration of 25 × 106 cells/ml in serum-free RPMI medium. 107 cells (0.4 ml) were aliquotted to 0.4-cm electroporation cuvettes (Invitrogen) and incubated for 5 min at room temperature with the DNA mixture to be transfected. The cells were electroporated using an Invitrogen Electroporator II at a setting of 330 V, 1000 microfarads, and infinite resistance with an input voltage of ∼325 V. Following electroporation, the cells from each cotransfection were resuspended in 10 ml of RPMI + 10% fetal bovine serum and split evenly (5 × 107 cells/plate) into control and treatment groups. 12–16 h post-transfection, the treatment group was stimulated with 32 nm TPA. Any pretreatment with phosphatase inhibitors occurred 30 min prior to TPA stimulation. 24 h post-stimulation, the cells were harvested, pelleted, washed once with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 100 µl of 0.25 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) (CAT assays) or 1× passive lysis buffer (luciferase assays; Promega). The protein concentration of the lysates was determined by the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) method. For CAT assays, 5–30 µl of cell lysate was combined with 20 µl of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The final volume was increased to 50 µl with lysis buffer, if necessary, and the mixture was incubated for 15 min at 65 °C to inactivate endogenous acetyltransferases. The lysates were then transferred to 7-ml scintillation vials, and 200 µl of CAT reaction mixture (125 mm Tris-HCl, 1.25 mm chloramphenicol, 0.1 µCi of [3H]acetyl-CoA) was added. 5 ml of Econofluor-2 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) scintillation fluid was overlaid and the reaction incubated for 15–90 min at 37 °C before counting. Background and total counts were determined by mixing 200 µl of CAT reaction mixture with 5 ml of Econfluor-2 or Scintiverse (Fisher Scientific), respectively. CAT activity was background-subtracted and normalized for the total amount of protein used. Luciferase assays were performed using the Promega luciferase assay system according to the manufacturer's instructions. PP2A enzymatic activity in whole cell lysates from U-937 cells transfected with 2.5, 5, or 10 µg of pCMV5 PP2Ac expression vector was determined using the PP2A assay kit from Life Technologies according to the manufacturer's instructions. TPA is a biologically active diterpene with pleiotropic effects that binds to and activates PKC. Although TPA has been shown to activate the HIV-2 promoter, an effect mediated in part by the pets site (Fig.1 A), the effect of TPA treatment on binding to the pets site has not been investigated. To determine whether binding to the pets site could be modulated by cell activation, we treated U937 monocytic cells for at least 24 h with 32 nm TPA or the carrier dimethyl sulfoxide (control). Nuclear extracts were prepared and EMSA performed using a radiolabeled probe containing a pets response element. As seen in Fig.1 B, TPA treatment resulted in an increase in the electrophoretic mobility of the pets complex on gel shift assays. The effect of TPA on pets binding was also observed using other monocytic cell lines, including HL-60 and THP-1 (data not shown). Time course experiments with U937, HL-60, and THP-1 monocytic cell lines indicated that the complex transition begins as early as 30 min and is complete between 24 and 48 h post-treatment (data not shown). To confirm that the change in mobility of the pets complex was indeed due to phorbol ester treatment, U937 cells were treated with dimethyl sulfoxide, 50 nm TPA, 50 nm 4β-PDD, or 50 nm 4α-PDD. Like TPA, 4β-PDD is capable of activating PKC, whereas 4α-PDD (an isomer of 4β-PDD) is devoid of phorbol activity. 4β-PDD but not 4α-PDD elicited the same increase in the mobility of the pets complex as TPA did in EMSA (Fig. 1 C), thus confirming that phorbol activity was necessary. Our laboratory has previously shown that the oncoprotein DEK binds the pets response element in a site-specific manner (6Fu G.K. Grosveld G. Markovitz D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1811-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Because DEK is a nuclear phosphoprotein (9Fornerod M. Boer J. van Baal S. Jaegle M. von Lindern M. Murti K.G. Davis D. Bonten J. Buijs A. Grosveld G. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1739-1748PubMed Google Scholar), we postulated that the TPA-induced changes in the pets complex seen on EMSA might be because of changes in the DEK phosphorylation state or intracellular levels. To examine the latter hypothesis, we performed DEK Western blots using the nuclear extract used for EMSA in Fig. 1 C. Treatment of the cells with either TPA or 4β-PDD, but not 4α-PDD, also led to a marked reduction in DEK protein levels (Fig. 1 D). The loss of DEK correlated with the change in the electrophoretic mobility of the pets complex seen in the gel shift assay (Fig. 1 C). DEK protein levels were also reduced significantly in the HL-60 and THP-1 monocytic cell lines treated with TPA for at least 24 h (data not shown). The inability to detect DEK protein by Western blot post-TPA treatment of U937 cells implies that the change in electrophoretic mobility of the pets band may, in fact, be due to a loss of DEK from the complex and binding of a new cellular factor. As available antibodies against DEK do not consistently work in “shift-shift” assays, the shift-Western assay, which enables the localization of known DNA-binding proteins to specific EMSA bands (30Demczuk S. Harbers M. Vennstrom B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2574-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), was used to assess the presence or absence of DEK in specific complexes on EMSA. In this assay, nucleoprotein complexes within the gel matrix are electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane and DE-81 anion exchange paper, which capture the protein and radiolabeled probe, respectively. The nitrocellulose membrane is subsequently blotted for the protein of interest and the DE-81 paper autoradiographed. The overlapping of bands on both membranes suggests that the specific nuclear factor detected by immunoblot is localized to the gel shift band. A gel shift assay using nuclear extract from untreated or 32 nm TPA-treated U937 was performed using a radiolabeled pets probe followed by shift-Western assay using α-DEK antiserum (Fig. 1 E). An overlap can be clearly seen between the DEK protein band on the Western blot (Fig.1 E, lane 3) and the band on the DE-81 paper autoradiograph from the samples that received no treatment (Fig.1 E, lane 1). This finding was not unexpected given that DEK has already been shown capable of binding to the pets site (6Fu G.K. Grosveld G. Markovitz D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1811-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, no overlap between the DEK protein bands and the TPA-induced pets band was observed (Fig. 1 E, lanes 2 and 4). This observation correlates with the loss of DEK seen with TPA treatment (Fig. 1 D) and suggests the possibility of a second pets factor. Another interpretation of these results is that there are alternatively spliced or post-translationally modified forms of DEK induced by TPA that the anti-DEK antiserum could not detect. To test this possibility, we performed Western blots using total cell lysates from U937 or 293 cells transfected with a FLAG-DEK expression vector. Both the FLAG monoclonal and DEK rabbit polyclonal antibodies detected identical sets of bands on Western blots (data not shown). To determine whether PKC activation was required for the effect of TPA on pets site binding, we utilized the PKC inhibitors staurosporine and Gö6983. Gö6983 is a staurosporine derivative capable of inhibiting the α, β, γ, δ, ζ, and µ PKC isoforms (32Gschwendt M. Dieterich S. Rennecke J. Kittstein W. Mueller H.J. Johannes F.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar) without affecting other intracellular kinases. The α, β, δ, and ζ isoforms of PKC have all been implicated in the TPA-induced signaling cascade leading to the differentiation of monocytes into macrophages (33Oshevski S. Le Bousse-Kerdiles M.C.

Under the standard assay conditions for PtdSer decarboxylase, the recombinant S100B protein did not stimulate PtdSer decarboxylase activity and exhibited no PtdSer decarboxylase activity.

Several mechanisms have been proposed for phospholipid transport, including ones involving soluble carrier proteins, transport vesicles, and contact zones between donor and acceptor membranes (1Trotter P.J. Voelker D.R. Biochim. Biophy. Acta. 1994; 1213: 241-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, the importance of the above proposed mechanisms for membrane biogenesis remains unclear, and phospholipid transport processes are largely unknown with respect to specific mechanisms, genes, and proteins involved. In mammalian cells, phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn)1 synthesis through the decarboxylation of nascent phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) requires both interorganelle and intramitochondrial transport of PtdSer, because PtdSer synthase is located on the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial-associated membrane (MAM) (2Vance J.E.

Chem. 1993; 268: 7069-7074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has extensively studied the processes of PtdSer transport from the ER or MAM to the mitochondrial inner membrane in intact cells and a permeabilized cell system and has established the following: 1) The PtdSer transport to mitochondria requires ATP (7Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14671-14676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Voelker D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9921-9925Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 9Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14340-14346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2) The PtdSer transport to mitochondria can occur in the absence of its synthesis (9Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14340-14346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 3) The general features of protein and PtdSer export of the ER are fundamentally different insofar as the export of proteins, but not that of PtdSer, requires cytosolic factors and guanine nucleotides (9Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14340-14346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 4) Adriamycin, which is a potent inhibitor of the import of proteins into mitochondria, also inhibits the PtdSer transport between the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes (10Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12185-12188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 5). When permeabilized cells are disrupted by shearing, the PtdSer transport from the ER or MAM to mitochondria is restricted to the autologous organelle (11Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7069-7074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, studies by Vance and co-workers (12Shiao Y.-J. Lupo G. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11190-11198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) have suggested that the PtdSer synthesized in the ER traverses the MAM en route to the mitochondria. Although studies of the PtdSer transport from the ER or MAM to the mitochondrial inner membrane have revealed the general features of this transport process as described above, our knowledge about the genes or gene products specifically involved in this transport is very limited. Mitochondrial membrane protein(s) have been shown to be required for the transport of PtdSer from the MAM to the mitochondria (13Shiao Y.-J. Balcerzak B. Vance J.E. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), but such protein(s) remain to be identified. In this laboratory, a mammalian cell mutant defective in the intramitochondrial transport of PtdSer has been isolated (14Emoto K. Kuge O. Nishijima M. Umeda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12400-12405Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar); however, the mutant gene responsible for the defect has not yet been cloned. To further understand the mechanisms of PtdSer transport to mitochondria, we re-examined the effect of cytosol on the transport-dependent PtdSer decarboxylation in permeabilized CHO-K1 cells and found that cytosolic factors from bovine brain enhanced the transport-dependent PtdSer decarboxylation in permeabilized CHO-K1 cells in the presence of Ca2+. Here, we describe the purification and identification of one of the factors exhibiting this enhancing activity. Strain CHO-K1 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, and maintained in Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum, penicillin G (100 units/ml), streptomycin sulfate (100 μg/ml), and NaHCO3 (1,176 g/liter) under a 5% CO2 atmosphere of 100% humidity at 37 °C. The permeabilization of CHO-K1 cells was performed by the method of Voelker (9Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14340-14346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with slight modifications. Cells were seeded at 1.1 × 107 cells per 150-mm dish 20–24 h prior to permeabilization. For permeabilization, the cells were washed three times with solution A (140 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, and 0.1 μm CaCl2), overlaid with 14 ml of solution A supplemented with 50 μg/ml of saponin (Sigma) and then incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. After this treatment, the medium was aspirated off, and the cells were placed on ice and harvested in 13 ml of solution A by scraping with a rubber policeman. The harvested cells were collected by centrifugation at 400 × g for 5 min, washed twice by gentle suspension in 14 ml of solution A followed by centrifugation at 400 × g for 5 min, and then gently suspended in solution A at ∼2 × 107 permeabilized cells per ml. Unless stated otherwise, the reactions for measuring PtdSer and PtdEtn synthesis were conducted in 100 μl of solution A in the presence of permeabilized cells (∼5 × 105 cells), 0.5 mm CaCl2, 2 mm ATP, 5 mm phosphocreatine, 1 unit of creatine phosphokinase, and 0.2 μCi ofl-[U-14C]serine (160 μCi/μmol) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The reactions were performed in glass tubes at 37 °C and terminated by the addition of 1.5 ml of MeOH/ CHCl3 (2:1). The lipids were extracted from the reaction mixtures by the method of Bligh and Dyer (15Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43133) Google Scholar) and separated on a thin layer chromatography plate (Silica Gel 60, Merck) with the solvent system of chloroform/methyl acetate/1-propanol/MeOH/0.25% KCl in water, 50:50:50:20:18. The radioactivity of the separated lipids was analyzed with a BAS2000 image analyzer (Fuji Film). Fresh bovine brains were obtained from a local slaughterhouse. All procedures were carried out at 0–4 °C. To measure activity, aliquots of bovine brain cytosol and purification fractions were dialyzed against solution A. The brains were cut into small pieces and then homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer in five volumes of homogenizing buffer (50 mmHepes/NaOH, pH 7.5, 0.25 m sucrose, and 5 mmEDTA). The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min and the supernatant was centrifuged at 18,000 ×g for 15 min. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to obtain the soluble fraction (cytosol). The cytosol was dialyzed three times against 12 liters of 20 mm Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.5) and then loaded onto a ∼70 ml Q-Sepharose HP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (2.6 cm i.d.) equilibrated with 20 mm Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.5). The column was washed with 250 ml of 20 mm Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.5) and then eluted with an 850-ml linear gradient, 0–500 mm, of NaCl in 20 mm Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.5). The active fractions eluted with ∼400 mm NaCl were pooled, adjusted to 2m (NH4)2SO4 and 50 mm bis tris propane/NaOH (pH 6.8) by adding solid (NH4)2SO4 and a 0.5 msolution of bis tris propane/NaOH (pH 6.8), and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was loaded onto an 8 ml-phenyl-Sepharose HP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (1 cm i.d.) equilibrated with 50 mm bis tris propane/NaOH (pH 6.8) containing 2 m(NH4)2SO4. The column was washed with 20 ml of 50 mm bis tris propane/NaOH (pH 6.8) containing 2 m(NH4)2SO4 and then eluted with a 180-ml linear descending gradient, 2 to 0 m, of (NH4)2SO4 in 50 mm bis tris propane/NaOH (pH 6.8). The active fractions were pooled, concentrated to 400 μl with a collodion bag, loaded onto a Superdex 75 HR (10/30) column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 25 mm Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl, and then eluted with the same solution. The activity was eluted as a single peak corresponding to a molecular mass of ∼20 kDa. The active fractions from the Superdex 75 HR column were pooled and directly loaded onto a Mono Q HR (5/5) column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 20 mm Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl. The column was washed with 3 ml of 20 mm Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl, and eluted with 3 ml of 20 mm Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.5) containing 300 mm NaCl and a 15-ml linear gradient, 300 to 450 mm, of NaCl in 20 mm Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.5). The purified protein was cleaved with BrCN (4 mg/ml in 70% formic acid) for 18 h at room temperature, and the resulting peptides were separated by reversed-phase HPLC on a Devolosil ODS column (0.3 × 10 cm; Nomura Chem.) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid with an acetonitrile gradient. The amino acid sequences of peptides were determined with a Model 477 amino acid sequencer from Applied Biosystems. Poly (A)+ RNAs were prepared from CHO-K1 cells with a FastTrac 2.0 mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen) and used for reverse transcription-PCR. First-strand cDNA was synthesized with a SMART™ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH) and PowerScript™ reverse transcriptase (CLONTECH), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Using the resulting first-strand cDNA as a template, a partial CHO S100B cDNA was amplified by two-stage nested PCR with S100B-specific primers, which were designed based on human, rat, and mouse S100B cDNA sequences, and AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primers used for the first round of amplification were ATGTCTGAGCTGGAGAAGG (sense) and TCACTCATGTTCAAAGAACTC (antisense). For the second round of amplification, ATGTCTGAGCTGGAGAAGGCCA (sense) and TCACTCATGTTCAAAGAACTCATG (antisense) were used as primers. The resulting PCR product was cloned into a plasmid, pCR®II-TOPO (Invitrogen) and then subjected to DNA sequencing. The sequence determined was used to design PCR primers for 5′-RACE. 5′-RACE was performed using a SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit with an antisense primer, CGAAGGCCATAAATTCCTGGAAGTCACAC, and a nested antisense primer, TCTCCATCTCCATCTTCATCCAG, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting 5′-RACE product was cloned into pCR®II-TOPO and then subjected to DNA sequencing. The sequence determined was used to design PCR primers for 3′-RACE. 3′-RACE was performed using a SMART™ RACE cDNA amplification kit with a sense primer, GGACACTGAAGTCAGAGAGGACACCAGC, and a nested sense primer, TGACCAGGAGCCTCCAGG, according to manufacturer's instructions. Because the nested sense primer used for 3′-RACE corresponded to the sequence upstream of an initiation codon, the resulting 3′-RACE product contained a full-length open reading frame encoding CHO S100B protein. The 3′-RACE product was cloned into pCR®II-TOPO and then subjected to DNA sequencing. pCR®II-TOPO carrying the 3′-RACE product was named pCR®II-TOPO-cS100B. Using pCR®II-TOPO-cS100B as a template, the coding region of CHO S100B cDNA was engineered by PCR so as to add a BamHI site immediately upstream of the initiation codon and to add a HindIII site immediately downstream of the termination codon. The PCR product was digested withBamHI and HindIII and then ligated with the pQE9 vector (Qiagen) digested with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid was named pQE9-cS100B. pQE9-cS100B and an empty pQE9 vector were introduced into E. coli cells (M15 harboring plasmid pREP4; Qiagen). The resulting transformants, named M15/pQE9-cS100B and M15/pQE9, respectively, were grown to a density ofA600 = 1.0 in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml of ampicillin and 25 μg/ml of kanamycin at 30 °C, and then further cultivated for 2 h in the presence of 1 mm isopropyl-thio-β-d-galactoside at 30 °C. The cells were harvested and resuspended in solution A. After freezing and thawing, the cells were disrupted by sonication. The cell lysate was centrifuged twice at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the resulting supernatant was dialyzed against solution A and then subjected to biochemical characterization. After inducing the production of a His6-tagged CHO S100B protein as described above, M15/pQE9-cS100B cells were suspended in solution B (150 mmNaCl and 25 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.5), subjected to freezing and thawing, and then disrupted by sonication. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was loaded onto a 1-ml HisTrap™ column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with solution C (500 mm NaCl and 25 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.5) containing 10 mmimidazole. After washing with this solution, the His6-tagged CHO S100B protein was eluted with solution C containing 500 mm imidazole, concentrated with a collodion bag, and then loaded onto a Superdex 75 HR (10/30) column equilibrated with solution B. After elution with solution B, the purified His6-tagged CHO S100B protein was dialyzed against solution A and then subjected to biochemical characterization. Exponentially growing CHO-K1 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, suspended in 250 mm sucrose containing 10 mm Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.5) and 1 mmEDTA, and then homogenized with a Potter- Elvehjem Teflon homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 700 × gfor 5 min, followed by centrifugation of the supernatant at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting pellet was suspended in solution A and then centrifuged again at 100,000 ×g for 1 h. The pellet was resuspended in solution A and subjected to biochemical characterization. Exponentially growing CHO-K1 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, suspended in 250 mm sucrose containing 10 mmHepes/NaOH (pH 7.5), disrupted by sonication, and then used as the enzyme source. The reaction mixture, with a final volume of 100 μl, for measuring PtdSer decarboxylase activity comprised 0.03 μCi of [14C]PtdSer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 0.5 mm PtdSer from bovine brain (Sigma), 0.5 mg/ml of Triton X-100, 100 mmKH2PO4-K2HPO4 buffer (pH 7.0), and 10 mm EDTA or 0.5 mmCaCl2. The reactions were performed in glass tubes at 37 °C for 30 min and terminated by the addition of 1.5 ml of MeOH/CHCl3 (2:1). The lipids were extracted from the reaction mixtures by the method of Bligh and Dyer (15Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43133) Google Scholar) and separated on a thin layer chromatography plate (Silica Gel 60, Merck) using the solvent system described above. The radioactivity of the separated lipids was analyzed with a BAS2000 image analyzer (Fuji Film). Proteins were measured with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce), with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Tricine-SDS-PAGE was performed as described (16Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). Silver staining of proteins in polyacrylamide gels was performed with a silver staining kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). DNA sequencing was performed by automated sequencing with an Applied Biosystem Prism 310 genetic analyzer and fluorescence-tagged dye terminator cycle sequencing. We prepared saponin-permeabilized CHO-K1 cells according to the method of Voelker (9Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14340-14346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and examined its ability to synthesize PtdSer and PtdEtn from serine precursor in the presence or absence of bovine brain cytosol. When the permeabilized cells were incubated with [14C]serine at 37 °C in solution A containing 0.2 mm ATP and 0.5 mmCaCl2, [14C]PtdSer and [14C]PtdEtn were produced in a time-dependent manner in the absence of bovine brain cytosol (Fig.1), in agreement with Voelker's conclusion (9Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14340-14346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the synthesis of [14C]PtdEtn in permeabilized cells, which is dependent on the transport of PtdSer from the ER or MAM to the mitochondrial inner membrane, does not require cytosol. The addition of bovine brain cytosol, however, remarkably enhanced the synthesis of [14C]PtdEtn in permeabilized CHO-K1 cells, although the synthesis of [14C]PtdSer in the presence of bovine brain cytosol was similar to that in its absence (Fig. 1). These results indicated that the bovine brain cytosol contained factor(s) that enhanced the transport-dependent decarboxylation of PtdSer in permeabilized CHO-K1 cells. We fractionated bovine brain cytosol on a Q-Sepharose HP ion exchange column and subjected an aliquot of each fraction to assaying for transport-dependent PtdSer decarboxylation (TPSD)-enhancing activity. The amounts of [14C]PtdEtn and [14C]PtdSer synthesized from [14C]serine in permeabilized CHO-K1 cells, in the presence of an aliquot of each fraction, were determined; the increase in the ratio of [14C]PtdEtn/([14C]PtdEtn plus [14C]PtdSer) was used as an index of the TPSD-enhancing activity. The TPSD-enhancing activity was separated into two prominent peaks on Q-Sepharose HP column chromatography (Fig.2 A). In this study, the TPSD-enhancing factor in the peak II fraction (Fig. 2 A) was further purified by successive chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose hydrophobic (Fig. 2 B), Superdex 75 gel filtration (Fig.2 C), and Mono Q ion exchange (Fig. 2 D) columns. The overall purification of the TPSD-enhancing activity from the cytosol (700 mg of proteins) was 300-fold, with a recovery yield of 20%, where a 1% increase in the ratio of [14C]PtdEtn/([14C]PtdEtn plus [14C]PtdSer) was defined as 1 unit of activity. With the third gel filtration column, the TPSD-enhancing activity was eluted as a single peak corresponding to a molecular mass of ∼20 kDa. When proteins in the fractions separated by the final Mono Q chromatography were analyzed by tricine-SDS-PAGE, an ∼9 kDa protein was found to comigrate with the TPSD-enhancing activity (See Figs. 2 D and3.). These results suggested that a homo dimer of the purified ∼9 kDa protein exhibited the TPSD-enhancing activity.Figure 3Tricine-SDS-PAGE analysis of proteins in the fractions separated by the final Mono Q column chromatography. The fraction numbers correspond to those in Fig. 2 D. Proteins were stained with a silver staining kit. M, molecular mass marker proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine its amino acid sequence, the purified ∼9 kDa protein was subjected to cyanogen bromide cleavage, and then the N-terminal amino acid sequences of the resulting two fragments were determined after purification of the fragments by reverse phase HPLC column chromatography. A search involving a protein sequence data bank indicated that the sequences determined, ITTAXHEFFEH and ETLDSDGDGEXDFG, matched parts of the amino acid sequence of an EF-hand type calcium-binding protein, S100B. Thus, the purified ∼9 kDa protein was identified as a S100B protein. We isolated CHO S100B cDNA clones. The nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of CHO S100B cDNA are shown in Fig. 4. A comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of the CHO S100B protein with that of the S100B proteins of other species is also shown in Fig. 4. To confirm that the S100B protein exhibits the TPSD-enhancing activity, a His6-tagged recombinant CHO S100B (His-cS100B) protein was bacterially produced and subjected to assaying for the TPSD-enhancing activity. Fig. 5 shows the tricine-SDS-PAGE patterns of soluble proteins from E. colitransformants, designated as M15/pQE9 and M15/pQE9-cS100B, which harbored an empty vector plasmid and a His-cS100B protein-expressing plasmid, respectively. A protein of 12 kDa was produced in an expression plasmid-dependent manner (Fig. 5), indicating that the 12 kDa protein was a His-cS100B protein. From a lysate of M15/pQE9-cS100B cells, the His-cS100B protein was purified on HisTrap and Superdex 75 columns successively. The tricine-SDS-PAGE pattern of the purified His-cS100B protein is shown in Fig. 5. Although the purified His-cS100B protein had no significant effect on the synthesis of [14C]PtdSer from [14C]serine in permeabilized CHO-K1 cells (Fig. 6), the purified His-cS100B protein remarkably enhanced the synthesis of [14C]PtdEtn from [14C]serine (Fig. 6). This enhancement by the His-cS100B protein occurred in a saturable manner, ∼3-fold enhancement being the maximal level (Fig. 6 A). Like the purified His-cS100B protein, crude soluble proteins from M15/pQE9-cS100B cells also remarkably enhanced the synthesis of [14C]PtdEtn from [14C]serine in permeabilized CHO-K1 cells (Fig. 6). In contrast, crude soluble proteins from M15/pQE9 cells, which carried a control empty vector, were incapable of significantly enhancing the synthesis of [14C]PtdEtn from [14C]serine (Fig. 6). These results indicated that the His-cS100B protein was able to enhance the transport-dependent decarboxylation of PtdSer in permeabilized CHO-K1 cells.Figure 5Tricine-SDS-PAGE analysis of soluble proteins from M15/pQE9 and M15/pQE9-cS100B cells and the purified His-cS100B protein.

This CaCl2concentration is 103-104 times higher than the physiological level. To determine whether or not the enhancement of the transport-dependent decarboxylation of PtdSer by the S100B protein requires high Ca2+ levels and/or ATP, permeabilized CHO-K1 cells were incubated under the several sets of conditions shown in Fig. 7, with [14C]serine in the presence or absence of the His-cS100B protein. In solution A, which approximates the intracellular ionic composition and Ca2+ level (0.1 μm), the synthesis of [14C]PtdSer and [14C]PtdEtn from [14C]serine in permeabilized CHO-K1 cells were negligible (Fig. 7). The addition of 2 mm ATP, 0.5 mm CaCl2, or both 2 mm ATP and 0.5 mm CaCl2 to solution A led to efficient synthesis of [14C]PtdSer and [14C]PtdEtn (Fig. 7). These results were consistent with the previous conclusion (9Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14340-14346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the synthesis of PtdSer and PtdEtn from serine in permeabilized CHO-K1 cells require ATP or a high Ca2+level. The addition of the His-cS100B protein to solution A supplemented with 2 mm ATP, 0.5 mmCaCl2, or both 2 mm ATP and 0.5 mmCaCl2, respectively, led to ∼2-, ∼3-, and ∼3-fold enhancement of the synthesis of [14C]PtdEtn in permeabilized CHO-K1 cells (Fig. 7). In contrast to the [14C]PtdEtn synthesis, the [14C]PtdSer synthesis remained essentially unchanged upon the addition of the His-cS100B protein to these solutions. These results indicated that the enhancement of the transport-dependent decarboxylation of PtdSer by the His-cS100B protein occurred in a physiological salt solution supplemented with ATP and did not require ATP upon supplementation with a high level of Ca2+. To examine whether or not the transport-dependent decarboxylation of PtdSer by isolated organelle membranes as well as that by permeabilized cells is enhanced by the His-cS100B protein, we prepared a membrane fraction containing ER membrane, MAM and mitochondria by centrifugation of a postnuclear supernatant of CHO-K1 cells at 100,000 ×g. When the isolated membranes were incubated at 37 °C in solution A supplemented with [14C]serine, ATP, and 0.5 mm CaCl2, [14C]PtdSer and [14C]PtdEtn were efficiently produced (Fig.8), suggesting that the transport of nascent PtdSer to mitochondria had occurred. The addition of the His-cS100B protein to the incubation mixture led to 1.3-fold enhancement of [14C]PtdEtn formation. However, this enhancement was much lower than that of PtdEtn formation in permeabilized cells by the His-cS100B protein (Fig. 6). Therefore, the enhancement of transport-dependent decarboxylation of PtdSer by S100B protein in permeabilized cells seemed to be related to the preserved organelle structures in permeabilized cells and was probably not because of the stimulation of PtdSer decarboxylase. Next, we examined the effect of the His-cS100B protein on the PtdSer decarboxylase activity in a homogenate of CHO-K1 cells, which was measured under the standard assay conditions. Under such conditions, the His-cS100B protein did not stimulate PtdSer decarboxylase activity and did not exhibit PtdSer decarboxylase activity (TableI). Because the S100B protein is a Ca2+-binding protein, we also examined the effect of the His-cS100B protein on PtdSer decarboxylase activity in the presence of Ca2+ (0.5 mm). Ca2+ itself did not affect PtdSer decarboxylase activity (Table I). Even in the presence of 0.5 mm Ca2+, the His-cS100B protein did not stimulate PtdSer decarboxylase activity and did not exhibit PtdSer decarboxylase activity. These results also supported the idea that the enhancement of the transport-dependent decarboxylation of PtdSer by the His-cS100B protein in permeabilized CHO-K1 cells was not because of the stimulation of PtdSer decarboxylase.Table IPtdSer decarboxylase activityEnzyme sourceEDTACaCl2PtdEtn formednmol/30 minCHO-K1 homogenate+−2.0CHO-K1 homogenate plus His-cS100B+−2.0His-cS100B+−<0.002CHO-K1 homogenate−+1.9CHO-K1 homogenate plus His-cS100B−+2.0His-cS100B−+<0.002PtdSer decarboxylase activity was measured in the presence of 10 mm EDTA or 0.5 mM CaCl2 as described under “Experimental Procedure.” The amounts of CHO-K1 homogenate proteins and the His-cS100B protein used were 100 and 4 μg, respectively.

The PtdEtn synthesis via the decarboxylation of nascent PtdSer requires the transport of PtdSer from the ER or MAM to the mitochondrial inner membrane, because of the difference in the subcellular localization of PtdSer synthase and PtdSer decarboxylase (2Vance J.E.

Although enzymes involved in the PtdSer decarboxylation pathway, PtdSer synthase and PtdSer decarboxylase, have been identified through the isolation of cDNA clones (21Kuge O. Nishijima M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 19133-19139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the mammalian genes and gene products involved in the transport of PtdSer from the ER or MAM to the mitochondrial inner membrane have not been identified so far. In this study, a Ca2+-binding protein, S100B, was shown to enhance the transport-dependent decarboxylation of PtdSer in permeabilized CHO-K1 cells. This enhancement could be possibly because of the enhancement of a certain process of PtdSer transport or to the stimulation of PtdSer decarboxylase activity. However, the latter possibility was unlikely, because the His-cS100B protein did not stimulate PtdSer decarboxylase activity under the standard assay conditions, irrespective of the presence or absence of Ca2+, and the enhancement of decarboxylation of PtdSer by the His-cS100B protein observed in isolated membranes was much lower than that in permeabilized cells. Thus, the S100B protein was implicated in the transport of PtdSer from ER or MAM to mitochondrial inner membrane. The S100B protein is a member of a family of small (∼10 kDa) Ca2+-binding proteins of the EF-hand type known as the S100 family, which comprises 19 members (24Zimmer D.B. Cornwall E.H. Landar A. Song W. Brain Res. Bull. 1995; 37: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar, 25Schäfer B.W. Heizman C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar, 26Donato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 191-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). The S100B protein exists as a homodimer or a heterodimer with the S100A1 protein (27Isobe T. Okuyama T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 89: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 28Isobe T. Okuyama T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 116: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), which is another S100 family member and is related most closely to the S100B protein. The S100B protein has been shown to interact with various proteins, and has been implicated in the Ca2+-dependent regulation of a variety of intracellular activities such as protein phosphorylation, enzyme activities, cell proliferation, cytoskelton assembly, neurite outgrowth, and intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis (24Zimmer D.B. Cornwall E.H. Landar A. Song W. Brain Res. Bull. 1995; 37: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar, 25Schäfer B.W. Heizman C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar, 26Donato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 191-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Ca2+ binding to the S100B protein dimer induces a conformational change, which results in exposure of the binding surface of an individual monomer, with which target proteins of the S100B protein are believed to interact (26Donato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 191-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Thus, the S100B protein dimer appears to expose two binding surfaces and to be capable of cross-bridging two proteins, in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Inconsistent with our finding that cytosol enhances the transport-dependent decarboxylation of PtdSer in permeabilized cells, Voelker (9Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14340-14346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has reported that cytosol slightly inhibits it. This inconsistency may be attributed to the differences in the assay conditions. In the experiment performed by Voelker, the effect of cytosol was examined in the presence of EGTA, which chelates Ca2+ and arrests PtdSer synthesis. On the other hand, our assay was performed in a solution containing Ca2+ and in the presence of PtdSer synthesis. Thus, the enhancement of the transport-dependent decarboxylation of PtdSer by cytosol might require free Ca2+ and/or the presence of PtdSer synthesis. Bovine brain cytosol appears to contain several factors that enhance the transport-dependent decarboxylation of PtdSer in permeabilized cells, because the enhancing activity has been separated into several peaks on Q-Sepharose ion exchange column chromatography. We have also tried to purify factors other than the S100B protein and found that, in addition to the S100B protein, at least two factors, which are larger than 200 kDa and smaller than 10 kDa, respectively, can enhance the transport-dependent decarboxylation of PtdSer in permeabilized cells. 2O. Kuge and M. Nishijima, unpublished results. It is therefore likely that several cytosolic factors are involved in the transport or decarboxylation of PtdSer. Studies by Voelker (9Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14340-14346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7069-7074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested that a diffusible PtdSer transport intermediate, such as a soluble protein or a transport vesicle carrying PtdSer, is not involved in the import of PtdSer into mitochondria. Importantly, studies involving CHO-K1 cells disrupted by saponin-permeabilization followed by shearing have demonstrated that PtdSer produced in one population of disrupted cells cannot be transported to the mitochondria of a second population of disrupted cells (11Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7069-7074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, PtdSer transport from the ER or MAM to mitochondria is physically restricted. This restriction implies that PtdSer is imported into mitochondria via a tightly associated contact site between ER or MAM and mitochondria. Then, how can the cytosolic S100B protein enhance the PtdSer transport to the inner mitochondrial membrane? One possible explanation is that the S100B protein regulates a putative PtdSer transport machinery existing in the ER membrane, MAM, or outer mitochondrial membrane. Another possible explanation is that the S100B protein stabilizes the contact site or increases the number of contact sites between the ER or MAM and mitochondria through crossbridging membrane proteins of these organelles. Identification of S100B-interacting membrane protein(s) that exist in these organelles might provide new insights into the transport of PtdSer from the ER or MAM to mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1974687765,"DNA replication of papillomavirus requires the viral initiator E1 and the transcription factor E2. Bovine papillomavirus, type 1 (BPV-1), E1, and E2 bind cooperatively as dimers to proximal sites in the viral replicator generating a sequence-specific E1E2-<i>ori</i> complex. This complex is critical for replication and can be converted to a multimeric E1-<i>ori</i> initiator complex by displacement of E2 in the presence of hydrolyzable ATP. However, E2 can function over extended distances, and E2 at a distal position 33 base pairs upstream of the E1-binding site also loads an E1 dimer onto <i>ori</i>. Under these conditions, neither displacement of E2 nor ATP hydrolysis are required for E1-<i>ori</i> formation, consistent with a need for ATP hydrolysis in E2 displacement from E1E2-<i>ori</i>. However, ATP is required for stabilization of the resulting E1-<i>ori</i>complex. These results indicate that BPV (with a proximal E2-binding site) and human papillomaviruses (with distal E2-binding sites) utilize the same general mechanism for E1 loading but suggest that E1E2-<i>ori</i>, which forms preferentially on <i>ori</i>, may perform an additional role in BPV replication."

Here we characterize the contributory role of cytosolic phospholipase A2 in the oncogenic Ha-RasV12 signaling pathway leading to activation of c-fos serum response element (SRE) and transformation in Rat-2 fibroblasts. Using a c-fos SRE-luciferase reporter gene, we showed that the transactivation of SRE by Ha-RasV12 is mainly via a Rac-linked cascade, although the Raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade is required for full activation. In addition, Ha-RasV12-induced DNA synthesis was significantly attenuated by microinjection of recombinant RacN17, a dominant negative mutant of Rac1. To identify the mediators downstream of Rac in the Ha-RasV12 signaling, we investigated the involvement of cytosolic phospholipase A2.

In addition, regulation of c-fos transcription by serum response element (SRE) is itself regulated by several proteins, including serum response factor (SRF) and p62TCF/Elk-1 (10Treisman R.

In that regard, activation of the MAPK cascade is known to stimulate interaction between p62TCF/Elk-1 and SRF at SRE, thus providing a direct link between MAPK activity and induction of c-fos (10Treisman R.

In addition to the Raf-MAPK cascade, an essential role of Rac, a member of Rho family GTPases, in the Ras signaling pathway has been demonstrated by several groups (14Qui R.-G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons M. Nature. 1995; 374: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar, 15Joneson T. White M.A. Wigler M.H. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1996; 271: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Rho family GTPases were once thought to be involved primarily in organizing the actin cytoskeleton (16Hall A. Annu. Rev.

However, over the past several years, it has become evident that Rho GTPases also carry out critical functions in the control of cell proliferation and SRE activation (14Qui R.-G. Chen J. Kirn D.

Unlike the Raf-MAPK cascade, which activates SRE in a p62TCF/Elk-1-dependent manner, Rac and other Rho family GTPases were shown to stimulate SRE largely via a p62TCF/Elk-1-independent pathway, which probably involves direct activation of SRF (6Gille H.

Thus, the Rac-linked pathway is suggested to act as another effector pathway of Ras in the cell (14Qui R.-G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons M.

Consistent with this, cooperation between Rac and Raf-MAPK cascades was shown to cause transformation synergistically (15Joneson T. White M.A. Wigler M.H. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1996; 271: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). In addition, Rat-1 fibroblasts expressing RacV12, a constitutively activated mutant of Rac1, displayed all the features of malignant transformation (14Qui R.-G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons M.

However, the downstream elements of the Rac signaling cascade that mediates transformation remain to be identified. Although c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) could be speculated as a downstream mediator, Rac mutants defective in activating JNK were still shown to induce transformation (20Westiwick J.K. Lambert Q.T. Clark G.L. Symons M. Van Aelst L. Pestell R.G. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), suggesting that activation of JNK is probably not involved in Rac-mediated cell transformation. It has been reported that the p21-activated serine/threonine kinases might be involved in Rac transformation, because expression of a kinase-deficient p21-activated serine/threonine kinase 1 mutant inhibited Ras-transformation (21Tang Y. Chen Z. Ambrose D. Liu J. Gibbs J.B. Chernoff J. Field J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1977; 17: 4454-4464Crossref Scopus (182) Google Scholar). However, other groups reported that p21-activated serine/threonine kinase binding was dispensable for Rac-induced transformation, and thus the role of p21-activated serine/threonine kinases in transformation is still unclear (15Joneson T. White M.A. Wigler M.H. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1996; 271: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). It was recently demonstrated that when activated, Rac in turn activates cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), and there is a resultant release of arachidonic acid (AA), a principal product of cPLA2 activity (22Peppelenbosch M.P. Qiu R.-G. de Vries-Smits A.M.M. Tertoolen L.G.J. de Laat S.W. McCormick F. Hall A. Symons M.H. Bos J.L. Cell. 1995; 81: 849-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 23Kim B.-C.

Chem. 1999; 274: 24373-24377Google Scholar). This makes it likely that cPLA2 is a downstream mediator of Rac signaling. Consistent with this, cPLA2 has been shown to be necessary for Rac in mediating actin remodeling or c-fos SRE activation (23Kim B.-C. Kim J.-H. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For instance, the inhibition of cPLA2 by either pretreatment with mepacrine, a potent inhibitor of phospholipase A2, or cotransfection with antisense cPLA2 oligonucleotide dramatically repressed Rac-induced SRE activation (23Kim B.-C. Kim J.-H. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In addition, in actin remodeling, Rac was shown to stimulate growth factor-dependent actin stress fiber formation via cPLA2 and subsequent metabolism of AA metabolism by 5-lipoxygenase (25Peppelenbosch M.P. Tertoolen L.G.J. Hage W.J. de Laat S.W. Cell. 1993; 74: 565-575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Together, these observations place cPLA2 downstream of Rac in a pathway leading to SRE activation or actin remodeling. Thus, activated Ras may stimulate the Rac-cPLA2-dependent pathway as well as the Raf-MAPK-linked cascade to activate SRE and transformation. The aim of the present study, therefore, was to characterize the contribution made by cPLA2 to SRE activation and transformation induced by oncogenic Ras. With the aid of a c-fos SRE reporter plasmid, we found that transactivation of SRE by Ha-RasV12 is mainly mediated via the cPLA2-linked cascade. In addition, we present evidence suggesting the role of cPLA2 as a downstream mediator of Ha-RasV12 in a signaling to transformation. Together, our findings point to cPLA2 as a novel target for suppressing oncogenic Ha-RasV12 signaling in the cell. Antisense cPLA2oligonucleotide (GsTsGCTGGTAA GGATCTsAsT) is directed against codons 4–9 of the human cytosolic, Ca2+-dependent PLA2 gene; two linkages are phosphothiolated at both the 5′ and 3′ ends. Antisense and control (GsTsGCTCCTAAGTTTCTsAsT) cPLA2 oligonucleotides were purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Mepacrine and wortmannin were from Sigma; nordihydroguaretic acid, indomethacin, and AACOCF3 were from Biomol; PD 098059 was from Research Biochemical International (Natick, MA). Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) and monoclonal anti-BrdUrd antibody were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other chemicals were from standard sources and were molecular biology grade or higher. Reporter genes pSRE-Luc and pSREmt-Luc contain positions −53 to +45 of the c-fospromoter situated upstream of the luciferase gene, with wild-type or mutant SRE oligonucleotides (23-mers) inserted at the −53 position (23Kim B.-C. Kim J.-H. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). pSPORT-Ha-Ras and pSPORT-Ha-RasV12 were from Dr. P. Kirshmeier (Schering-Plough Research Institute). pEXV, pEXV-RacN17, and pEXV-RhoV14(RhoAval14) expression vectors were from Dr. A. Hall (University College London, London, UK). Dominant negative mutants of PI 3-kinase (pSG5-Δp85α) and Raf-1 (craf301, a kinase-defective form of Raf-1) were from Dr. J. Downward (Imperial Cancer Research Center) and Dr. U. R. Rapp (University of Wurzburg), respectively (26Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Pappin D. Das P. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A. Downward J.

Rat-2 fibroblasts were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (CRL 1764) and grown in DMEM supplemented with 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and penicillin (50 units/ml)-streptomycin (50 mg/ml) (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 (v/v). The stable Rat2-HO6 clone expressing Ha-RasV12, a constitutively activated Ha-Ras mutant, has been described previously (28Kumar C.C. Bushel P. Mohan-Peterson S. Ramirez F. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6877-6884PubMed Google Scholar). Transient transfection was carried out by plating ∼5 × 105cells in 100-mm dishes for 24 h, after which calcium phosphate:DNA precipitates prepared with a total of 20 μg of DNA, including 3 μg of pSRE-Luc and 5 μg of a GTPase expression vector (e.g.pEXV-RacN17), were added to each dish (29Jhun B.-H. Rose D.W. Seely B.L. Rameh L. Cantley L. Saltiel A. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7466-7475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To control for variations in cell number and transfection efficiency, all clones were cotransfected with 1 μg of pCMV-βGAL, a eukaryotic expression vector in which the Escherichia coli β-galactosidase (lac Z) structural gene is under the transcriptional control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The total quantity of DNA in each transfection was kept constant at 20 μg by adding appropriate quantities of sonicated calf thymus DNA (Sigma). After incubating 6 h with the calcium phosphate:DNA precipitates, the cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline before incubating in fresh DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS for an additional 36 h. Thereafter, cell extracts were prepared by rinsing each plate twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysing the cells in 0.2 ml of lysis solution (0.2 m Tris, pH 7.6, 0.1% Triton X-100). The lysed cells were scraped and spun for 1 min, and the supernatants were assayed for protein concentration and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. Luciferase activity was assayed in 10-μl samples of extract using a luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol; luciferase luminescence was counted in a luminometer (Turner Design, TD-20/20) and normalized to cotransfected β-galactosidase activity. β-galactosidase assays were carried out using 50-μl aliquots of extract diluted with 100 μl of H2O and 150 μl of 2× reaction buffer (3 mg/mlO-nitrophenyl-β-galactopyranoside, 2 mmMgCl2, 61 mm Na2HPO4, 39 mm NaH2PO4, 100 mm2-mercaptoethanol). When a faint yellow color appeared, the reactions were stopped by the addition of 350 μl of 1 mNa2CO3, and the optical density at 410 nm was measured in a spectrophotometer. The results were then used to normalize luciferase activity to transfection efficiency. Protein concentrations were routinely measured using the Bradford procedure with Bio-Rad dye reagent (Bio-Rad) and using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Transfection experiments were performed in duplicate with two independently isolated sets, and the results were averaged. Rat-2 cells were plated to a density of 1 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. After 4 h, 2 μCi/ml [3H]AA (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to each well and incubated for an additional 36 h, after which the cells were washed at least three times with medium. The cells were then transfected with pSPORT-Ha-RasWT or pSPORT-Ha-RasV12 using the calcium phosphate:DNA precipitation method. After incubating the cells for 6 h at 37 °C, the medium was exchanged for fresh DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS and incubated for another 6 h; [3H]AA released into the medium during that period was assayed by scintillation counting. At the end of each experiment, the cells were solubilized in 0.5 ml of EtOH, and total intracellular incorporation was determined so that counts could be corrected to intracellular pools of AA. The procedure for microinjection of purified fusion protein has been described. Briefly, Rat-2 cells were plated on scored 12-mm coverslips, incubated for 24 h, and then rendered quiescent by starvation for 48 h in serum-free DMEM. On the day of injection, the coverslips were transferred to 35-mm culture dishes, and Ha-Ras or Ha-RasV12, along with 2 mg/ml Rat IgG or RacN17 protein, was microinjected using glass capillary needles, yielding about 150–200 microinjected cells/coverslip. Two h after microinjection, BrdUrd was added, and the cells were incubated for an additional 16 h at 37 °C. The cells were then fixed for 20 min at 22 °C in acid alcohol (90% EtOH, 5% acetic acid, 5% H2O), after which they were incubated for 60 min at 22 °C with mouse anti-BrdUrd antibody, followed by 60 min with rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody and then 60 min with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rat IgG. The coverslips were then washed intensively and mounted. DNA synthesis by individual cells was assessed as a function of BrdUrd incorporation, which was photographed and analyzed using an Axioskop fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss). The immunofluorescent staining of the injected cells indicated that about 80% of the cells were successfully microinjected. Protein samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 8% acrylamide gels, followed by transfer to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes for 2 h at 100 V using a Novex wet transfer unit. Membranes were then blocked overnight in Tris-buffered saline with 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20 and 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk, after which they were incubated for 2 h with the primary antibody (anti-cPLA2 or anti-tubulin) in Tris-buffered saline and then for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence kits (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bands on XAR-5 film (Eastman Kodak Co.) corresponding to cPLA2 were measured by densitometry. For the soft agar clonability assays, 103 or 104 cells suspended in 4 ml of agar (Noble, Difco; 0.3% in growth medium with 10% FBS) were poured onto a 6-ml basal layer (0.6% agar in DMEM) in 100-mm plates. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 10 days, and the colonies were counted by staining them withp-iodonitro tetrazolium violet dye as described previously (30Kim J.-H. Johansen F.E. Robertson N. Catino J.J. Prywes R. Kumar C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13740-13743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the cell growth experiments, Rat-2 or Rat2-HO6 cells were plated onto a 6-well plate (105 cells/plate) in 1 ml of DMEM containing 10% FBS. On the next day, the medium was replaced with serum-free medium or serum-free medium containing mepacrine. The viable cell number was counted at 36 h later. Rat-2 and Rat2-HO6 cells (3 × 105) were plated on 60-mm dishes and incubated in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS for 24 h. Then, the culture medium was replaced with DMEM containing 0.5% FBS for an additional 24 h. For the measurements of the level of LTC4/D4/E4, the plates were rinsed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and mixed with 4 times their volume of absolute ethanol and left at 4 °C for 30 min. The resulting precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The ethanolic supernatant and culture medium containing the leukotrienes were collected through a C2 reverse phase column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, RPN 1903). The methyl formate in the eluted samples was then removed by evaporation under vacuum, and the samples reconstituted in assay buffer were stored under argon at −50 °C until assayed for LTC4/D4/E4 using a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, RPN 224) as instructed by the manufacturer. The enzyme immunoassay was calibrated with standard LTC4/D4/E4from 0.75 to 48 pg/well. The sensitivity, defined as the amount of LTC4/D4/E4 needed to reduce zero dose binding, was 0.5 pg/well, which is equivalent to 10 pg/ml. The statistical significance of LTC4/D4/E4 assays was assessed with analysis of variance (ANOVA) (p < 0.01). As a first step in characterizing the downstream signaling cascades elicited by constitutively activated, oncogenic Ha-RasV12, we investigated the mechanisms by which they stimulate c-fos SRE. Because activation of c-fos by normal Ha-RasWT was previously shown to be dependent upon p62TCF/Elk-1 binding to SRF (3Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 4Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 5Gauthier-Rouviere C. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), we initially used a luciferase reporter gene under the control of a human c-fos minimal promoter fused to SRE oligonucleotide to assess the extent to which Ha-RasV12 requires p62TCF/Elk-1 binding to stimulate SRE (Fig.1 A). Cotransfection with either pSPORT-Ha-RasWT or pSPORT-Ha-RasV12caused dose-dependent activation of c-fos SRE (Fig. 1 B). To assess the role of Elk-1/p62TCF, pSREmt-Luc, containing a mutant oligonucleotide (AGG to TGT), with an intact SRF interaction site but lacking a p62TCF/Elk-1 binding site (13Johansen F.-E. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5920-5928Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 31Kim B.-C. Kim J.-H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), was used as a reporter gene (Fig.1 A). Unlike transfection of pSPORT-Ha-RasWT, which activated c-fos SRE in a p62TCF/Elk-1-dependent manner, transfection with pSPORT-Ha-RasV12 stimulated both pSRE-Luc and pSREmt-Luc to similar degrees (∼12-fold increase over a pSPORT control vector), indicating that Ha-RasV12 acts independently of p62TCF/Elk-1 (Fig. 1 C). Ras activates the MAPK and Rac pathways via interactions with Raf-1 and PI 3-kinase, respectively, and proper function of both pathways is required for efficient mitogenesis or transformation by Ras (14Qui R.-G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons M. Nature. 1995; 374: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar, 15Joneson T. White M.A. Wigler M.H. Bar-Sagi D.

Cell. 1997; 89: 465-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (954) Google Scholar). To obtain further insight into the signaling mechanism by which Ha-RasV12 mediates c-fos SRE activation, therefore, we examined the effect of cotransfecting vectors encoding dominant negative mutants of either Rac1 (RacN17) (17Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3041) Google Scholar, 18Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar) or Raf-1 (craf301) (27Kolch W. Heidecker G. Lloyd P. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1991; 349: 426-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 A, both RacN17and craf301 significantly inhibited Ha-RasWT-induced SRE activation. On the other hand, although strongly inhibited by RacN17, transactivation of SRE by Ha-RasV12 was only partially affected (∼20% inhibition) by craf301 (Fig.2 A). Activation of SRE by RhoAV14, a constitutively activated RhoA mutant transfected as a control, was unaffected by either RacN17 or craf301 (Fig.2 A). SRE activation by Ha-RasWT thus appears to be via a pathway dependent on both Raf-MAPK and Rac, although the contribution of the latter was relatively small. Activation by Ha-RasV12, by contrast, appears to be largely via the Rac-linked pathway. Consistent with the aforementioned results, PD 098059, a specific MAPK kinase inhibitor (32Zhang C. Baumgartner R.A. Yamada K. Beaven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13397-13402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), markedly inhibited SRE activation by Ha-RasWT (e.g. ∼75% inhibition at 10 μm) but had a substantially smaller effect on Ha-RasV12-induced activation (Fig. 2 B). The levels of expression of Ha-RasWT and Ha-RasV12were similar (data not shown), meaning that the reduced sensitivity to inhibition of Raf-MAPK on the part of Ha-RasV12 was not due to the differential expression of Ras isoforms. Together with the p62TCF/Elk-1-independent nature (Fig. 1 C), therefore, Ha-RasV12 signaling to SRE seems to be largely via the Rac-linked pathway, although the Raf-MAPK cascade seems to still be required for efficient signaling. It has been reported that PI 3-kinase is situated downstream of Ras in the pathway leading to Rac activation (26Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Pappin D. Das P. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A. Downward J. Cell. 1997; 89: 465-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (954) Google Scholar). Therefore, to further investigate the contributing role of Rac-linked signaling to Ha-RasV12-induced SRE activation, we tested the effect of wortmannin (33Wymann M.P. Bulgarelli-leva G. Zvelebil M.J. Pirola L. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1722-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), a specific PI 3-kinase inhibitor, and observed that wortmannin selectively and dose-dependently inhibited SRE activation by Ha-RasV12 but had minimal effects on activation by Ha-RasWT (Fig.3 A). As an example, pretreatment with 0.1 μm wortmannin inhibited Ha-RasV12-induced SRE activation by ∼70% but had little effect on Ha-RasWT-induced SRE activation. Similarly, transient transfection with a dominant negative PI 3-kinase mutant, pSG5-Δp85α, dose-dependently inhibited the effects of Ha-RasV12 but attenuated the effects of wild-type Ha-Ras to a much smaller degree (Fig. 3 B). In another approach aimed at evaluating the role of Rac in Ha-RasV12signaling, recombinant RacN17 protein was microinjected into cells, and Ha-RasV12-stimulated DNA synthesis was assessed by indirect immunofluorescence. Groups of 150–200 quiescent cells on coverslips were microinjected with Ha-RasWT, Ha-RasV12, or RacN17 plusHa-RasV12 or Ha-RasWT along with control rat IgG and then labeled with BrdUrd. Ha-RasWT stimulated DNA synthesis in ∼40% of the microinjected cells, as indicated by their BrdUrd-labeled nuclei, whereas Ha-RasV12 stimulated 70% of cells to incorporate BrdUrd (Fig. 4). Coinjection of RacN17 reduced the fraction of cells stimulated to initiate DNA synthesis by Ha-RasV12 from 70 to 40% but had little effect on Ha-RasWT-induced DNA synthesis. The results of three independent experiments are graphically summarized in Fig. 4 B; they provide direct evidence that Rac is a critical link in the signal transduction pathway by which Ha-RasV12 stimulates DNA synthesis and, presumably, cell proliferation. In fibroblasts, Rac stimulates growth factor-dependent actin stress fiber formation via PLA2 activation and subsequent metabolism of AA by lipoxygenase (22Peppelenbosch M.P. Qiu R.-G. de Vries-Smits A.M.M. Tertoolen L.G.J. de Laat S.W. McCormick F. Hall A. Symons M.H. Bos J.L. Cell. 1995; 81: 849-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In addition, we observed that cPLA2 is a principal downstream mediator of Rac-induced activation of c-fos SRE, JNK, and reactive oxygen species (23Kim B.-C. Kim J.-H. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar,"

However, the abundance of ChM-I in fetal cartilage suggests that it may have other roles in chondrocyte growth modulation.

ChM-I stimulates DNA synthesis and proteoglycan biosynthesis in the presence of basic fibroblast growth factor 2 (2Hiraki Y. Tanaka H. Inoue H. Kondo J. Kamizono A. Suzuki F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Mature ChM-I is a 121-amino acid glycoprotein that is derived from the C terminus of a 335-amino acid precursor (2Hiraki Y. Tanaka H. Inoue H. Kondo J. Kamizono A. Suzuki F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The N terminus, as isolated from cartilage, is ELVR (1Neame P.J. Treep J.T. Young C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9628-9633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hiraki Y. Tanaka H. Inoue H. Kondo J. Kamizono A. Suzuki F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and this glycosylated protein is referred to in the present study as 28-kDa ChM-I. Little is known about the post-translational processing of the ChM-I precursor. The precursor remnant ChM-I presumably represents the product that results from cleavage of ChM-I and would have a C-terminal sequence of RERR. This presumed proteolytic site, which matches the consensus sequence for furin-protease cleavage, is conserved between species (9Shukunami C. Iyama K. Inoue H. Hiraki Y. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 39-49PubMed Google Scholar). It is not clear whether ChM-I is processed intra- or extracellularly. The precursor remnant may be degraded intracellularly, may remain on the cell surface, or may be rapidly internalized and degraded. A smaller, unglycosylated ChM-I form of 82 amino acids with a N-terminal DAEP, which is abundant in fetal cartilage (1Neame P.J. Treep J.T. Young C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9628-9633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), derives from the C terminus of 28-kDa ChM-I and is referred to here as 9-kDa ChM-I. The overall structure of ChM-I is analogous to the family of juxtacrine growth factors that are derived from membrane-anchored precursors (10Massagué J. Pandiella A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 515-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Members of this family include transforming growth factor β, tumor necrosis factor α, heparin binding epidermal growth factor, and amphiregulin. The precursor and soluble growth factor forms have functions that are separate from each other. For example, the precursor form of transforming growth factor-β is a juxtacrine growth factor that mediates signaling, proliferation, and adhesion of the neighboring cells (11Brachmann R. Lindquist P.B. Nagashima M. Kohr W. Lipari T. Napier M. Derynck R. Cell. 1989; 56: 691-700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The processed, secreted soluble form of transforming growth factor-β can diffuse freely and is a potent paracrine and autocrine growth factor. To analyze the processing pathway for ChM-I and to determine whether it might be a candidate member of the juxtacrine family of growth factors, we generated antipeptide antisera that detect and distinguish between processed and precursor ChM-I forms. We show for the first time that the ChM-I precursor is processed intracellularly. Transfection of mammalian cell culture systems with ChM-I constructs and pulse-chase analysis to establish a precursor-product relationship revealed a processing pathway similar to that seen in cultured chondrocytes. Our results support the hypothesis that furin is the protease responsible for post-translational processing of ChM-I. All tissue culture supplies were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. or Fisher. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma or Roche Molecular Biochemicals. [35S]Cysteine-methionine was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Restriction enzymes and molecular biology reagents were obtained from U. S. Biochemical Corp., Stratagene, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, or Life Technologies. Plasmids pCR2.1TA and pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) and frozen competent cells were obtained from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). ChM-I was isolated from cartilage with 4 m guanidine-HCl as previously described (1Neame P.J. Treep J.T. Young C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9628-9633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bovine articular cartilage from the metacarpal phalangeal joint or rib growth plate cartilage were obtained from fetal animals. Chondrocytes were isolated by digestion for 2 h with 2 mg/ml Pronase in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with gentle shaking (90 rpm), followed by an 18-h digestion with 0.5 mg/ml collagenase with gentle shaking (50 rpm). Freshly isolated cells were either lysed directly in sample buffer for Western blot analysis or plated in monolayer culture for metabolic labeling and subsequent immunoprecipitation. Chondrocytes and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (50 μg/ml streptomycin, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml gentamycin). A mutant CHO cell line deficient in furin (RPE.40; Ref. 12Inocencio N.M. Moehring J.M. Moehring T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31831-31835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was grown in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum serum and the same antibiotics and was a generous gift from Dr. Thomas Moehring. Long-term culture chondrosarcoma (LTC) cells were a generous gift from Dr. Kurt Doege and Dr. James Kimura and were passaged from the line established by Kucharska et al. (13Kucharska, A., Kuettner, K., and Kimura, J. (1990) J. Orthop. Res. 781–792.Google Scholar) in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with antibiotics and 10% fetal calf serum. CHO cells were plated at 2.5 × 105 cells per well in a six-well plate (35-mm well diameter). The following day, cells were transfected for 5 h with 1 μg of plasmid that had been mixed and incubated with 6 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies) for 30 min under serum-free conditions. Serum was then added to a final concentration of 10%, and incubation continued for up to 48 h. A similar protocol was used for transfection of RPE.40 cells (12Inocencio N.M. Moehring J.M. Moehring T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31831-31835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis for gene expression was performed by either Western immunoblotting or immunoprecipitation. For selection of CHO transfectants that were stably expressing ChM-I, cells were diluted 1:10 48 h after transfection and incubated in DMEM containing 1 mg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen) until zeocin-resistant cells formed visible colonies. Colonies that were zeocin resistant were trypsinized within cloning rings, transferred to 24-well plates, and selected for clonal purity by limiting dilution. For metabolic labeling, CHO transfectants or chondrocytes in monolayer cultures were plated in 100-mm tissue cultures dishes and labeled for 4 h with 250 μCi/plate [35S]cysteine-methionine in cysteine- and methionine-free DMEM containing 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum. The cell medium was removed and saved for further analysis. Cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by incubation (and gentle shaking) in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors: 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) at 4 °C for 30 min. Cells were then scraped and sonicated or passed through a 20-gauge needle for further lysis. For pulse-chase analysis, after the indicated pulse time, cells in monolayer were rinsed and incubated in complete DMEM for the indicated chase time. A hot start was used for all polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) using Ready-To-Go PCR beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Primers (40 μm) were synthesized by Genosys Biotech (Woodlands, TX). A typical PCR cycle was as follows: one cycle at 95 °C for 5 min and 30 cycles at 95 °C for 1 min, 61 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, followed by purification using a gel extraction system (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). RNA from bovine epiphyses was isolated as previously described (8Azizan A. Gaw J. Govindraj P. Tapp H. Neame P. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 521-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and used as the template for reverse transcription-PCR using primers 6U23 (AAGCCTCCTGGTGTCCTGCTCCG) and 1111L26 (TCCGTCATGGTCCCTTTAGCTTCAGG). The product was cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) and then subcloned into pcDNA3.1/Zeo at the BamHI and NotI sites (Invitrogen). A PCR product corresponding to full-length precursor ChM-I was prepared with primers 786U19 (CGTGTACGGTGGGAGGTCT) and 2164L22 (CTGACACGGAAGATCAACGGTC; see Fig.4 A). These primers are in the pcDNA3.1 vector, outside the cDNA-derived cassette. Modified half-length precursor ChM-I DNA fragments were prepared. Overlap extension followed by PCR was used to generate a full-length PCR product containing the desired mutations of R214S and E215Q (pPreChM-I; primers 1576SQU30, ATCCAGAGAGAAAGAAGCCAACTGGTAAGA; and 1584SQL30, TCTTTCTTCGGTTGACCATTCTTTTTAGCA) and E215 stop (pRemChM-I; primers 1576U30, ATCCAGAGAGAGAAAGAAGATGACTGGTAAGA; and 1584L30, TCTTTCTTCTACTGACCATTCTTTTTAGCA). The products were then used to replace the wild-type ChM-I in plasmid pChM-I. Clones were then sequenced to verify incorporation of the correct sequence (DNA Sequencing Core Laboratory, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL). Two peptides, CWLKPTYPKEIQRERR (USF-PN2) and DNPYHQQEGESMTFDPRLC (USF-PN3), were synthesized, coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin via their terminal cysteine residues, and used to immunize rabbits to generate antisera AN71 and AN73, respectively (Anaspec Inc., San Jose, CA; Fig.1). All antisera were positive for the immunizing peptides in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Crude antisera were affinity purified further by adsorption of antibodies to peptides that had been immobilized to Sepharose (SulfoLink; Pierce). Purified antibodies were eluted with ImmunoPure Gentle Ag/Ab elution buffer (Pierce). The specificity of the AN73 antisera to chondromodulin was analyzed by passing it down affinity columns containing either immobilized USF-PN2 or USF-PN3 and analyzing both the void (unbound) fractions and eluted fractions in Western blots. Samples resuspended in sample buffer were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE; NuPAGE 4–12% bis-Tris (2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)- propane-1,3-diol) gel; Novex, San Diego, CA) under reducing conditions, and transferred by wet transfer to an Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Affinity-purified antisera AN71 and AN73 were used at dilutions of 1:5000 overnight. Antibodies were visualized with a goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA) and developed with a chemiluminescent substrate, CSPD™, using the Western-Light chemiluminescent detection system (Tropix). The cell lysate and medium (1 ml) were incubated with antisera AN71 or AN73 or the corresponding preimmune sera (5 μl) and a protein A-agarose suspension (Life Technologies; 30 μl) for 3 h at 4 °C and washed extensively with cell lysis buffer. The resulting samples were resuspended in sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The gel was treated with Entensify solution (NEN Life Science Products), and bands were detected with Biomax film (Eastman Kodak Co.) or a phosphorimaging screen (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) for densitometric quantitation. Two forms of ChM-I have been detected in fetal bovine cartilage: a glycosylated form with the N-terminal sequence ELVR (28-kDa ChM-I) and a smaller unglycosylated form with an N-terminal sequence of DAEP (9-kDa ChM-I; Fig. 1; Ref. 1Neame P.J. Treep J.T. Young C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9628-9633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The precursor of ChM-I has not been detected in cartilage to date, and neither has the remnant that should be left after removal of 28-kDa ChM-I from its precursor. 28-kDa ChM-I is preceded by the sequence RERR (Fig. 1; Ref. 14Hiraki Y. Mitsui K. Endo N. Takahashi K. Hayami T. Inoue H. Shukunami C. Tokunaga K. Kono T. Yamada M. Takahashi H.E. Kondo J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The N-terminal two-thirds of ChM-I, remnant ChM-I, may remain on the cell surface after 28-kDa ChM-I processing from the precursor, may be internalized, or may never appear on the cell surface and be degraded intracellularly. 9-kDa ChM-I is preceded by the sequence SVQE, which does not conform to the furin cleavage consensus sequence. Two anti-peptide antisera, AN71 and AN73, were generated to enable us to target specific domains of ChM-I (Fig. 1). AN71 is generated against the synthetic peptide USF-PN2 (Fig. 1), which contains the neoepitope that would derive from removal of ChM-I from the precursor. AN71 would also detect the residues in USF-PN2 that do not constitute a neoepitope and therefore would be expected to also detect the precursor for ChM-I. AN73 is generated against USF-PN3 (Fig. 1), which is located near the N terminus of the 9-kDa ChM-I, and detects the 28- and 9-kDa as well as the precursor ChM-I (Fig. 1). To visualize the products of ChM-I precursor processing, we analyzed fetal cartilage extracts and isolated chondrocytes by Western blotting, using affinity-purified anti ChM-I antiserum AN73. The 28- and 9-kDa forms of ChM-I could be visualized in Western blots of fetal cartilage tissue extracts but not from freshly isolated chondrocytes (Fig.2). The glycosylated 28-kDa ChM-I appeared as a broad diffuse band, and the unglycosylated 9-kDa ChM-I was detected as a sharp band. A 7-kDa form of ChM-I could be detected in chondrocytes and at a reduced level in cartilage tissue extract. This 7-kDa form of ChM-I has not been detected previously. To validate the interaction of AN73 with the 7-kDa band (as well as with 28- and 9-kDa ChM-I), Western analysis was performed with antiserum that had been adsorbed to columns of either Sepharose-immobilized USF-PN2 or USF-PN3. AN73 that had been passed down a column of immobilized USF-PN3 did not show the bands seen in Fig. 2, whereas AN73 that had been passed down a column of immobilized USF-PN2 did show these bands. This indicated that the immobilized immunizing peptide would efficiently remove immunoreactivity. Conversely, eluate from immobilized USF-PN2 did not react with these bands, whereas the eluate from immobilized USF-PN3 did react (results not shown). Thus, the bands detected by AN73 correspond to proteins containing the USF-PN3 sequence. We were unable to detect the precursor of ChM-I in articular cartilage or chondrocytes using Western blotting with AN73 antiserum (Fig. 2). To visualize the ChM-I precursor, we labeled chondrocyte monolayers with [35S]cysteine-methionine and immunoprecipitated the cell lysate and medium with AN73 anti-ChM-I antiserum. Both the ChM-I precursor (47 kDa) and glycosylated 28-kDa ChM-I could be immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate. Secreted 28-kDa ChM-I could be recovered from the medium of a fetal monolayer chondrocyte culture (Fig. 3 A). The bands corresponding to the precursor and 28-kDa ChM-I were specific, because they were absent when preimmune sera was used. We previously reported that ChM-I mRNA is abundant in the resting and proliferating zones of growth plate chondrocytes (8Azizan A. Gaw J. Govindraj P. Tapp H. Neame P. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 521-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). ChM-I and remnant ChM-I were immunoprecipitated from monolayer chondrocytes isolated from the proliferating zone of the bovine rib growth plate (Fig. 3 B). Precursor and 28-kDa ChM-I were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates, and secreted 28-kDa ChM-I was immunoprecipitated from the culture medium. Immunoprecipitation with AN71 affinity-purified antiserum detected a band of ∼28 kDa (Fig. 3 B), corresponding to the ChM-I remnant that remains associated with the cell layer after 28-kDa ChM-I is cleaved from the precursor (Fig. 1). The identity of the remnant ChM-I was confirmed with ChM-I constructs (below and Fig. 4). The corresponding preimmune sera failed to precipitate USF-PN2- or USF-PN3-containing proteins or peptides. LTC cells also produce chondromodulin. The cell lysate and culture medium were immunoprecipitated with AN71 and AN73. Secreted 28-kDa ChM-I was recovered from culture media (Fig. 3 C). A band at ∼23 kDa was immunoprecipitated with AN71. This band (p23) is smaller than the ChM-I remnant detected in chondrocytes using the same method and seems likely to be a cross-reacting protein (Figs. 3 C,5, and 6), possibly another protein with an RERR furin cleavage consensus sequence.Figure 6Pulse-chase analyses of ChM-I from LTC cells and LTC pChM stable transfectants.LTC cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]cysteine-methionine for 30 min and then chased with complete DMEM. Cell lysates and medium from LTC cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-ChM-I AN73 (A) and quantitated, and the data were plotted (B). C, Pulse-chase analysis of AN71-immunoprecipitated LTC pChM-I cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) ChM-I processing could be analyzed and the antisera could be further validated by using recombinant ChM-I mutants that either cannot be processed or that have been artificially truncated at the processing site. To dissect ChM-I-processing events and to further confirm the specificity of AN71 and AN73, ChM-I constructs pChM-I (encoding the wild-type ChM-I precursor), pPreChM-I (encoding a mutant ChM-I precursor that cannot be processed), and pRemChM-I (encoding a mutant ChM-I that has been truncated at the processing site; Fig. 4 A) were constructed. CHO cells were transfected with empty vector pcDNA3.1, pChM-I, pPreChM-I, and pRemChM-I. Fig. 4 B shows the Western blot analysis of transfected CHO cells that were analyzed using AN71 anti-remnant or AN73 anti-ChM-I antisera. CHO cells transfected with pChM-I expressed a precursor ChM-I form of ∼47 kDa when immunoblotted with AN73 anti-ChM-I antiserum. This precursor band is clearly visible in cells transfected with pChM-I and pPreChM-I but is not present in pRemChM-I transfectants. Mature 28-kDa ChM-I was not detected with AN73 in this experiment, because it was processed and secreted into the cell medium (Fig. 4 C). When visualized with peptide-purified anti-remnant AN71 antiserum, pRemChM-I transfectants appear to accumulate massive amounts of the remnant ChM-I. A remnant is also visible in cells transfected with pChM-I. As expected, the remnant ChM-I was absent in pPreChM-I transfectants, because processing had been disabled by the mutation at the processing site. To further analyze the expression of products of the ChM-I constructs, cell lysates and culture media from CHO cells that were stably expressing wild-type and mutant ChM-I were immunoprecipitated with either AN71 or AN73 antisera (Fig. 4 C). The lysate of CHO ChM8.1 that was stably transfected with wild-type pChM-I contains precursor and cell-associated 28-kDa ChM-I when immunoprecipitated and visualized with AN73. 28-kDa ChM-I was recovered in the cell medium with AN73, whereas the remnant ChM-I form was detected with peptide-purified AN71 anti-remnant antiserum. In contrast, CHO mutant PreChM2.11 expressed only the unprocessed precursor ChM-I and not the 28-kDa ChM-I or remnant ChM-I. CHO ChM-I mutant RemChM7.1 expressed remnant ChM-I but not the precursor or 28-kDa ChM-I. AN71 detected both the precursor and the remnant, because the precursor also contains the USF-PN2 sequence. The ChM-I remnant (a sharp band at 28 kDa) was immunoprecipitated from LTC cells (Fig. 5) stably transfected with pChM-I. Transiently transfected cells accumulated considerably more precursor and remnant than stably transfected cells (results not shown). This is likely because of overloading of translational and post-translational machinery within the transfected cells. LTC cells were pulse labeled with [35S]cysteine-methionine for 30 min and chased for various times to determine ChM-I the precursor-product relationship. Pulse-chase analysis was also performed to detect other short-lived, intermediate processed ChM-I forms that may be present in the cells. Cell lysates and media were immunoprecipitated with AN73 anti-ChM-I antisera (Fig. 6 A). The bands corresponding to precursor and processed ChM-I in nontransfected LTC cells were scanned and quantitated relative to total counts and plotted against time (Fig. 6 B). We were unable to detect the ChM-I-remnant in LTC cells unless they were overexpressing ChM-I as a result of transfection with pChM-I. Pulse-chase analysis of pChM-I stably transfected LTC cells using AN71 as the immunoprecipitating antiserum resulted in two bands (Fig. 6 C), a transient band corresponding to remnant ChM-I and a stable band that did not show a precursor-product relationship and that corresponded to p23. Precursor ChM-I declined with time, whereas secreted 28-kDa ChM-I increased correspondingly. A peak of cell-associated 28-kDa ChM-I was detected after 1 h of chase but declined after that, further supporting the hypothesis that there is not a pool of the cell-associated precursor and that the precursor is cleaved into 28-kDa ChM-I and a rapidly degraded remnant. No other intermediate forms were detected. In contrast, transfected CHO cells accumulated considerable intracellular 28-kDa ChM-I. In CHO cells, high levels of precursor and 28-kDa ChM-I were still present after 6 h of chase, suggesting that the cellular processing machinery was overloaded (data not shown). Defective processing of the mutant pPreChM-I CHO transfectant implies that the intact signal RERR is necessary for precursor cleavage by a specific protease. This processing signal matches the consensus sequence for furin protease (15Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). We investigated the possibility that furin is the cleaving protease for ChM-I by using a mutant CHO cell line, RPE.40, which is defective in the expression of furin protease, due to a mutation in the fur gene (12Inocencio N.M. Moehring J.M. Moehring T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31831-31835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RPE.40 cells were transfected with either pcDNA3.1 vector or pChM-I and then metabolically labeled with [35S]cysteine-methionine. CHO cells transfected with pChM-I showed the expected precursor ChM-I and processed 28-kDa ChM-I when immunoprecipitated with AN73 antiserum. Remnant ChM-I was immunoprecipitated with peptide-purified AN71 antiserum (Fig. 7). In contrast, only precursor ChM-I was detected when the cell lysates of RPE.40 transfected with pChM-I were immunoprecipitated with AN73 anti-ChM-I antisera. The ChM-I precursor band was absent in RPE.40 cells that were transfected with the pcDNA3.1 vector plasmid, and secreted 28-kDa ChM-I was not detected in the culture medium of RPE.40 cells. Peptide-purified AN71 antiserum detected the ChM-I remnant in transfected CHO cells but not in RPE.40 cells transfected with pChM-I. The differences in ChM-I expression between CHO and RPE.40 cells suggest that in RPE.40 cells, the ChM-I precursor was not cleaved and processed as it was in furin-positive CHO cells. ChM-I was first identified as an abundant glycoprotein (small, cartilage-derived glycoprotein) with an N terminus of ELVR (28-kDa ChM-I) in dissociative extracts of fetal and newborn bovine nasal cartilage. A smaller, nonglycosylated, C-terminal fragment with an N terminus of DAEP (9-kDa ChM-I) was also found in similar molar quantities (1Neame P.J. Treep J.T. Young C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9628-9633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as a product of either intra- or extracellular cleavage of 28-kDa ChM-I. Identification of a full-length cDNA encoding the ChM-I precursor (2Hiraki Y. Tanaka H. Inoue H. Kondo J. Kamizono A. Suzuki F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) suggested the presence of at least two other forms of ChM-I, a membrane-associated precursor and the N-terminal two-thirds remnant that remains membrane associated after removal of 28-kDa ChM-I. The precursor and precursor remnant have not previously been detected. The goal of this study was to define steps in the biosynthesis and post-translational processing of the precursor to generate free 28-kDa ChM-I (Fig. 1). Using anti-ChM-I- and anti-remnant ChM-I-specific antisera, we were able to detect and identify the four ChM-I forms previously reported, or speculated to be present, in cartilage, as well as 7-kDa ChM-1, a species that has not been observed previously (Figs.2 and 3). Detection of precursor, remnant, and 28-kDa ChM-I in cultured chondrocyte lysates and secreted 28-kDa ChM-I in chondrocyte culture medium (Fig. 3, A and B) suggests that the pathway for ChM-I processing depicted in Fig. 1 is likely to be correct. The proteins synthesized by CHO cells transfected with constructs containing modified ChM-I (Fig. 4) further support the processing hypothesis. The product of pPreChM-I mutated at the predicted protease recognition site was deficient in processing, implying that ChM-I processing was indeed at this site and that an intact signal is necessary for protease cleavage. pRemChM-I with a stop codon that deleted 28-kDa ChM-I from the precursor expressed a product that is similar in size and immunoreactivity to the native remnant ChM-I form seen in chondrocytes (Fig. 3) and transfected CHO cells (Fig. 5), further confirming the identity of remnant ChM-I. Before this study, this processing paradigm had been speculative, because these different ChM-I forms had not been identified. Cleavage of precursor proteins that generate biologically active proteins and peptides can occur intracellularly, at the cell surface or within the extracellular milieu (16Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Brain Res. 1999; 848: 45-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). It was not clear before this study whether ChM-I is processed intra- or extracellularly. There are three possible schemes for ChM-I precursor processing that would generate the active mature 28-kDa ChM-I. In the first, the ChM-I precursor would be processed on the cell surface, leaving remnant ChM-I associated with the cell surface. In the second scheme, the ChM-I precursor may be processed intracellularly, and 28-kDa ChM-I would then be independently secreted; the precursor remnant could also be transported to the cell surface. Third, the ChM-I precursor could be cleaved intracellularly; the remnant would be rapidly removed (and would not be detected on the cell surface); and 28-kDa ChM-I would be transported to the cell surface. On the basis of the results of the present study, the third scheme appears to be most likely. As shown in Fig. 3, precursor, remnant, and 28-kDa ChM-I could be immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates, indicating that processing of the precursor takes place intracellularly, before secretion of the mature 28-kDa ChM-I. If processing takes place on the cell surface, as described in the first scheme, 28-kDa ChM-I would only be associated with the cells if it were bound to the cell surface in some way. This was not observed in the present study. Pulse-chase analysis of LTC cells overproducing pChM-I show that the cell-associated 28-kDa ChM-I is rapidly lost from the cell layer, in parallel to the loss of the 28-kDa remnant, suggesting that the two events are nearly contemporaneous. These findings indicate that processing precedes secretion of 28-kDa ChM-I, which supports the hypothesis that processing of the ChM-I precursor takes place intracellularly. Intracellular processing suggests that ChM-I may be cleaved from its precursor by a specific intracellular protease, immediately after biosynthesis. Presumably, the recognition site is the RERR that immediately precedes the sequence ELVR at the N terminus of bovine 28-kDa ChM-I. Mutation of R-ELVR to S-QLVR at the predicted processing site (coded for by pPreChM-I; see Fig. 4B) disabled ChM-I precursor cleavage, establishing that the intact signal RERR is necessary for recognition by a specific protease for correct processing of the ChM-I precursor. The processing signal matches the consensus sequence for furin protease cleavage (RXR/KR). Furin belongs to the proprotein convertase (PC) family of mammalian subtilisin/Kex2p-like endoproteases (15Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). The seven members of this family identified to date, PC1, PC2, furin, PC4, PC5/PC6, PACE4, and PC7/SPC7/PC8/LPC, are responsible for the conversion of precursor proteins into their biologically active forms (16Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Brain Res. 1999; 848: 45-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Precursors are usually cleaved at the general motif (K/R)-(X)n-(K/R), wheren = 0, 2, 4, or 6, and X is any amino acid but usually not cysteine (16Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Brain Res. 1999; 848: 45-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). A mutant strain of the CHO-K1 cells, RPE.40, was shown to be resistant to Pseudomonas exotoxin A because of impaired proteolytic processing of the proprotein form that generates the active toxin (17Moehring J.M. Moehring T.J. Infect. Immun. 1983; 41: 998-1009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was later verified that RPE.40 had a mutated fur gene, which abolished expression of furin protease responsible forPseudomonas exotoxin A cleavage in the cell line (12Inocencio N.M. Moehring J.M. Moehring T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31831-31835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We show in this study that although precursor ChM-I was correctly processed in transfected CHO cells, it was not cleaved in similarly transfected RPE.40 cells (Fig. 7). These data strongly suggest that furin is the protease involved in the cleavage of precursor ChM-I into mature 28-kDa ChM-I at its specific recognition sequence. The smaller 9-kDa ChM-I found in developing articular cartilage (Fig.2; Ref. 1Neame P.J. Treep J.T. Young C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9628-9633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was not detected in freshly isolated chondrocytes, chondrocyte monolayer cultures, or CHO cells that were stably expressing ChM-I. This suggests that it may not be processed directly from the precursor ChM-I but is likely cleaved from secreted 28-kDa ChM-I by a matrix-associated protease, possibly one of the matrix metalloproteinase family. The P7 form of ChM-I appears to be the product of action by an intracellular protease, because P7 could be detected only in freshly isolated chondrocytes. The sharp band on SDS-PAGE suggests that P7 does not contain the carbohydrate found on 28-kDa ChM-I. It contains the USF-PN3 epitope and does not have a high enough molecular weight to include both this epitope and the C-terminal end of ChM-I. Therefore, it is probably an internal peptide fragment. No other intermediate forms other than the precursor, remnant, and 28-kDa ChM-I were detected through pulse-chase analysis, suggesting that the 28-kDa ChM-I is directly processed from the precursor ChM-I form. As the immunoprecipitated ChM-I precursor declined with time, the bands for the processed 28-kDa ChM-I (cell associated and secreted) were increased, indicating a precursor-product relationship. Appearance of the cell-associated 28-kDa ChM-I precedes that of the secreted form, suggesting that there is a delay in a cell-associated compartment before 28-kDa ChM-I is released into the medium. Thus, precursor ChM-I undergoes intracellular processing immediately after biosynthesis, generating the cell-associated 28-kDa ChM-I, which is then secreted into the medium. We establish in this study that the different forms of ChM-I, precursor, remnant, and 28- and 9-kDa ChM-I, are present in cartilage. We showed that precursor ChM-I is processed intracellularly, most likely by furin protease, to generate 28-kDa ChM-I, which is then secreted outside the cell. To date, the role of 28-kDa ChM-I as a cartilage-specific antiangiogenic and growth-modulating factor has been elucidated (18Suzuki F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 19Hiraki Y. Shukunami C. Pediatr. Nephrol. 2000; 14: 602-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The precursor and remnant have half-lives that are relatively short, suggesting that they do not have a function. It is possible that the extracellular cleavage of 9-kDa ChM-I from 28-kDa ChM-I may enable the smaller, unglycosylated protein to diffuse more rapidly through the matrix, thus modulating the activity of ChM-I. In this context, it is interesting that a relative of ChM-1 has been detected recently in tendon (20Brandau O. Fåssler R. Aszódi A. Dev. Dyn. 2001; 221: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This protein appears to remain in the cell membrane (21Shukunami C. Oshima Y. Hiraki Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 1323-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 22Yamana K. Wada H. Takahashi Y. Sato H. Kasahara Y. Kiyoki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 1101-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and therefore, unlike ChM-1, may be a candidate juxtacrine factor.

We showed that diamide, a reagent that promotes disulfide bond formation, caused a loss of immunorecognition of the monomeric hHSF1 protein in a standard Western blot detection procedure. Modification of the Western blot procedure to include dithiothreitol in the equilibration and transfer buffers after gel electrophoresis allowed for the detection of a compact, intramolecularly disulfide cross-linked oxidized hHSF1 (ox-hHSF1) in the diamide-treated sample. The effect of diamide was blocked by pretreatment with N-ethylmaleimide and was reversed by dithiothreitol added to the sample prior to gel electrophoresis. Incubation with nitrosoglutathione at 42 °C also promoted the conversion of HSF1 to ox-HSF1; at 25 °C, however, nitrosoglutathione was by itself without effect but blocked the formation of ox-hHSF1 in the presence of diamide. The disulfide cross-linked ox-hHSF1 was monomeric and resistant to the in vitro heat-induced trimerization and activation. The possibility that ox-HSF1 may occur in oxidatively stressed cells was evaluated. Treatment of HeLa cells with 2 mml-buthionine sulfoximine promoted the formation of ox-HSF1 and blocked the heat-induced activation of HSF DNA binding activity.

The free thiol group (S−, thiolate anion) of cysteine is a powerful nucleophile and is the most readily oxidized and nitrosylated of amino acid side chains (1Lunblad R.L. Techniques in Protein Modification. CRC Press, New York1995: 63-96Google Scholar, 2Stamler J.S. Hausladen A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 247-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The disulfide-bonded cystine, by comparison, is relatively unreactive but provides a covalent link between different regions of a protein and confers stability to a specific conformation (3Brandon C. Tooze J. Introduction to Protein Structure. 2nd Ed. Garland Publishing, New York1998: 353-356Google Scholar, 4Jaenicke R. Chadwick D.J. Widdows K. Protein Conformation. John Wiley and Sons, New York1991: 206-221Google Scholar). These considerations gave impetus to the suggestion that the redox-dependent thiol-disulfide exchange reaction can provide an important mechanism to regulate protein structure and function (5Gilbert H.F. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 330-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 6Ziegler D.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 305-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). The notion that thiol-disulfide exchange may be involved in regulating transcription factor activity has gained much recent interest and support (7Ashlund F. Beckwith J. Cell. 1999; 96: 751-753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). For example, activation of the prokaryotic OxyR transcription factor has been shown to be a two-step process involving first the oxidation of Cys-199 to a sulfenic acid followed by intramolecular disulfide cross-link of Cys-199 and Cys-208 (8Zheng M. Aslund F. Storz G. Science. 1998; 279: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Importantly, OxyR can be activated independently by hydrogen peroxide or by a shift of the cellular redox state as in Escherichia coli mutants lacking components of the thioredoxin and glutaredoxin pathways (9Aslund F. Zheng M. Beckwith J. Storz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1999; 96: 6161-6165Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). These observations provided the much needed information to relate changes in cellular redox status to the mechanism of regulation of OxyR and to the oxidative stress response in prokaryotes. Examples of eukaryotic transcription factor regulationin vitro through reversible redox-dependent modification of key cysteine-SH groups include AP-1 (10Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher III F.J. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar), Rel/κB (11Mathews J.R. Wakasugi N. Virelizier J. Yodoi J. Hay R.T.

Bishopric N.H. Discher D.J. Murphy B.J. Webster K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 135-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and Pax proteins (14Tell G. Scalon A. Pellizzari L. Formisano S. Pucillo C. Damante G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25062-25072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Whereas in vivoevidence for a causal relationship of changes in cellular redox status and function of the candidate eukaryotic transcription factor(s) is lacking, the demonstration of redox-dependent regulation of OxyR in the living prokaryotic cells and the presence in eukaryotic cells of enzymes/proteins that catalyze thiol-disulfide exchange (e.g. thioredoxin, nucleoredoxin, and Ref-1 (15Hirota K. Matsui M Iwata S. Nishiyama A. Mori K. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar)) would argue for conservation of this regulatory mechanism in evolution. We are interested in determining if redox may provide a mechanism of regulation of the structure and function of hHSF1,1 the transcription factor that mediates the heat shock transcriptional response to heat and other environmental stresses (16Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3788-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar, 17Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). This interest stems in part from our desire to understand the age-dependent dysfunction of HSF1 in a variety of model systems, including human diploid fibroblasts in culture (18Liu A.Y.-C. Lee Y.K.

Manalo D. Liu A.Y.-C. Biol. Signals. 1996; 5: 180-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and is based on the generally acknowledged importance of oxidation and oxidative damage of proteins as contributing causes of aging (20Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20313-20316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2783) Google Scholar). As a first step toward this goal, we developed the necessary reagents and experimental protocols for the resolution, detection, and quantitation of redox conformers of the human heat shock factor 1, and we evaluated the effects in vitro and in vivo of various redox-active compounds on the redox status, structure, and function of hHSF1. The polyclonal rabbit anti-hHSF1 antibody was prepared by immunizing a rabbit with histidine-tagged hHSF1 produced inE. coli and affinity-purified using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin from Qiagen, Valencia, CA. The specificity of this antibody was very similar to the antibody previously provided to us (21Huang L.E. Zhang H. Bae S.W. Liu A.Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 48: 30718-30725Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) from the laboratory of Dr. C. Wu at the NCI, National Institutes of Health (22Rabindran S.K. Haroun R.I. Clos J. Wisnieski J. Wu C. Science. 1993; 259: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The enhanced chemiluminescence Western blot detection kit was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The plasmid, pJC20(HSF1) was from the laboratory of Dr. Carl Wu (23Rabindran D.K. Giorgi F. Clos J. Wu C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6906-6910Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs. Inc., Beverly, MA. Transcription in vitro was done using mMessage-mMachine T7-Transcripton kit (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX), and translationin vitro was done using rabbit reticulocyte lysate fromPromega, Inc., Madison, WI. Consensus oligonucleotides of Oct-1, TATA-1, AP-1, NF-κB, and SP-1 were from Promega Inc., Madison, WI. Diamide (diazenedicarboxylic acid bis(N,N-dimethylamide)), buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), sodium nitrate, sodium nitroprusside (sodium nitroferricyanide, Na2Fe(CN)5NO), and other SH-directed reagents were from Sigma or Pierce. Other chemicals were of molecular biology grade or reagent grade. HeLa cells were grown as monolayer cultures at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 units/ml penicillin plus 50 μg/ml streptomycin. The growth medium was replenished every 3 days until cells reach confluency. Cells were harvested at the end of an experiment by first removing the medium, rinsing the monolayer twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4), scraping the cells off with a plastic scraper, and pelleting by centrifugation at 1,800 × g for 4 min. The primary objective of this study was to determine the effectsin vitro of diamide and nitrosoglutathione on the redox status and function of HSF1. For this, the S100 cell extract of control HeLa cells containing the latent HSF1 protein was used. The method of preparation of the S100 extract was as described previously (24Baler R. Gerhard D. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2486-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Briefly, the harvested cell pellet was resuspended by light vortexing in 4× packed cell volume of Buffer A (15 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin and pepstatin, 0.01 units/ml aprotinin), repelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended in 2× packed cell volume of Buffer A. After a 15-min incubation on ice, the swollen cells were Dounce-homogenized with a B-type pestle (15 strokes). The cell homogenate was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 8 min, and the pellet was saved for nuclear extract preparation described below. The supernatant was transferred to a new Eppendorf tube, mixed with 0.11× volume of Buffer B (180 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, 1.0 m NaCl, 13.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin and pepstatin, and 0.01 units/ml aprotinin), and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 60 min. The supernatant was carefully removed and dialyzed against 50× volume of Buffer D (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 22% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 0.5 mm DTT) for 4 h at 4 °C. The S100 cell extract thus obtained was aliquoted and kept frozen at −70 °C until use. For studies of the effects in vivo of glutathione depletion on the redox status and function of HSF1, HeLa cells were incubated with 1 mm BSO, a specific inhibitor of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, for 24 h at 37 °C, followed by an additional 2-h incubation under control (37 °C) or heat shock (42 °C) condition. Cells were harvested, and whole cell extracts were prepared essentially according to methods described (24Baler R. Gerhard D. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2486-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 25Ausubel J Brent F. M Kingston R Moore R. D Smith D. D Seidman J. A Struhl J. G Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1990: 10.2.1-10.2.8Google Scholar). Briefly, the freshly prepared cell pellet was placed in a liquid-N2 bath for 10 min. It was then resuspended in 2.5× pellet volume of a modified whole cell lysis Buffer C (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, 0.42m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm iodoacetamide, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin and pepstatin, and 0.01 units/ml aprotinin) and thawed at 25 °C for 10 min with mild vortexing every 2 min. The mixture was then placed on ice for 10 min with periodic pulse vortexing and then centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 12,000 × g. The supernatant containing whole cell extract was aliquoted and stored at −70 °C until use. Nitrosothiols (RSNO; orthionitrites) are unstable esters of thionitrous acid of the general structure R–S–N=O, and the biological activity of RSNO was likely due to the heterolytic decomposition and release of the nitrosonium cation (NO+) as oppose to the homolytic decomposition and release of nitric oxide (NO⋅) (26Arnelle D.R. Stamler J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). The RSNO reagents that we have used in this study include S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) andS-nitrosoacetylpenicillamine (SNAP). The other NO carrier that we used was sodium nitroprusside from Sigma. GSNO and SNAP were prepared according to procedures described (27Mathews W.R. Kerr S.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1993; 267: 1523-1537Google Scholar). Briefly, sodium nitrate (NaNO2) was mixed with an equimolar concentration of GSH (dissolved in water) or N-acetylpenicillamine (dissolved in 25% methanol). The solutions were adjusted to pH 2.0 and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min at which time a characteristic color developed as follows: GSNO gave a deep orange hue, whereas SNAP formation was indicated by a light green color. The samples were then neutralized with NaOH to pH 7.4, aliquoted, frozen, and stored as stock at −70 °C to be used over the next 2 months. For controls, GSH and NAP without sodium nitrate were similarly processed. HeLa cells treated with these control reagents were used to validate the specificity of effects of the S-nitrosothiols. The in vitro activation of hHSF1 by heat was critically dependent on protein concentration (28Larson J.S. Schuetz T.J. Kingston R.E. Nature. 1988; 335: 372-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 29Mosser D.D. Kotzbauer P.T. Sarge K.D. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3748-3752Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). We routinely prepared and used S100 cell extracts with a protein concentration >4.5 μg/μl in order to get a robust and reliable activation of the HSF1 DNA binding activity. Aliquots of cell extracts were incubated at 42 °C for 30–60 min to activate hHSF1. Extracts incubated at 25 °C served as controls. In order that we may resolve and probe redox conformers of HSF1 by gel electrophoresis and immuno-Western blot, it was necessary for us to exclude SH-reducing reagents, such as β-mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol, from the sample buffer used for gel electrophoresis. This is an important variation from the standard practice in protein gel electophoresis. Our 2× sample buffer for gel electrophoresis contained 125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 20% glycerol, 25 μg/ml bromphenol blue, and SDS in concentrations indicated below. For SDS-PAGE, the sample, separation gel, and electrophoresis buffer contained 2, 0.1, and 0.1% SDS, respectively. For native gel electrophoresis, there was no SDS in the separation gel and electrophoresis buffer, although it was necessary to include 0.02% of SDS in the sample buffer. The omission of this 0.02% SDS (0.01 of that present in the normal SDS sample buffer) caused the hHSF1 signal to appear as a smear in immuno-Western blot analysis of proteins resolved by native gel electrophoresis. Perhaps the presence of a trace amount of SDS in the sample buffer had a salutary effect in preventing protein aggregation. Occasionally, when it was necessary for us to determine the total amount of HSF1, we included in the sample buffer 10 mm DTT, and the samples were then processed for gel electrophoresis and immuno-Western blot probing of HSF1. Aliquots of protein samples with 20 μg of protein were mixed with an equal volume of the specified 2× sample buffer and then loaded onto a mini-gel apparatus. Gel electrophoresis was done according to the method of Laemmli as described previously (25Ausubel J Brent F. M Kingston R Moore R. D Smith D. D Seidman J. A Struhl J. G Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1990: 10.2.1-10.2.8Google Scholar) using a 4% spacer gel and, unless indicated otherwise, a 5.5% separation gel. Samples were electrophoresed at 100 V for 70 min or until the tracking dye, bromphenol blue, reached the bottom of the gel. For assessment of the stoichiometry of hHSF1, samples were incubated with glutaraldehyde (2 mm, 30 min at 25 °C) to cross-link protein subunits, followed by quenching of the cross-linking reaction with the addition of 100 mm lysine. These sample was then mixed with an equal volume of a reducing (10 mmDTT) SDS sample buffer and heated at 100 °C for 10 min to ensure the complete denaturation of proteins and reduction of disulfide-bonded cystines. Electrophoretic separation of the HSF1 monomer, dimer, and trimer was done using a SDS (4–10% gradient)-acrylamide gel. Immuno-Western blot detection of hHSF1 was done under either a standard or reducing condition. For the standard procedure, the gel after electrophoresis was equilibrated for 10 min in 50 ml of 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm glycine, and 20% methanol, and proteins were then transferred electrophoretically (50 mA, 60 min at 25 °C) onto a nitrocellulose membrane in the same buffer. For the reducing Western transfer procedure, the equilibration and transfer buffers contained 5 and 1 mm DTT, respectively. Nonspecific protein-binding site on the nitrocellulose membrane was blocked by incubation of the membrane with 10% nonfat milk in a Tris-buffered saline/Triton X-100 buffer (10 mmTris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100). Immunodetection of the hHSF1 protein was done using a 1:2500 dilution of the anti-HSF1 antibody and 1:5000 dilution of the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody. Antigen-antibody complex was detected using the ECL Western Detection Kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. In this as well as our previous studies (22Rabindran S.K. Haroun R.I. Clos J. Wisnieski J. Wu C. Science. 1993; 259: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 30Park J. Liu A.Y.-C. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 185: 348-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) of immuno-Western blot detection of hHSF1, the specific hHSF1 signal appeared as a cluster of bands with apparent molecular masses of ∼85–90 kDa in SDS-PAGE. Electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay of HSF DNA binding activity was performed essentially as described previously (31Choi H.S. Lin A. Li B. Liu A.Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18005-18011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Liu A.Y.-C. Choi H.S. Lee Y.K. Chen K.Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 149: 560-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Aliquots of cell extracts containing 20–40 μg of protein were used to assay for binding to 32P-HSE. 500 ng of poly(dI/dC) was used to quench nonspecific protein-DNA binding. The reaction was initiated by adding 0.25–1.0 ng of the HSE-oligonucleotide probe (25,000–30,000 cpm) to the samples and incubation for 20–30 min at 25 °C. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved from the free 32P-HSE (DNA) probe by electrophoresis in a low ionic strength 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. A glycerol-bromphenol blue/xylene cyanol dye solution was added to flanking empty wells to monitor the migration of free probes. Samples were electrophoresed at 200 V for about 45 min. In the initial phase of this study, we noticed that detection of the hHSF1 monomer in HeLa S100 cell extracts using a standard immuno-Western blot detection protocol was markedly affected by cysteine SH-directed reagents. Fig. 1illustrates this. Thus, treatment of the latent hHSF1 with diamide significantly reduced the immunodetection of hHSF1 in a standard Western blot procedure (lanes 2–7). This effect of diamide was readily and completely reversed by DTT (5 mm) added to the sample prior to gel electrophoresis (lane 8), whereas DTT by itself had no effect (lane 9). This result suggests that the loss of immunoreactivity of the diamide-treated hHSF1 was not because of irreversible degradation of the protein. This cycle of treatment with diamide and then DTT could be repeated at least two times with little or no change in the signal intensity of hHSF1. Diamide is an oxidizing reagent known to promote protein disulfide cross-link (33Kosower N.S. Kosower E.M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This being given, the result in Fig. 1 suggested to us that perhaps disulfide bond formation selectively stabilized a form of hHSF1 with a shielded antigenic core that was difficult if not impossible to detect using the anti-hHSF1 polyclonal antibody. Accordingly, we reasoned that breaking the disulfide bond(s) after the completion of gel electrophoresis may allow for the immunorecognition and detection of the oxidized hHSF1 protein. We devised a “reducing” Western blot procedure, in which the gel after electrophoresis was equilibrated in a buffer containing 5 mm DTT, and proteins were transferred from the gel to nitrocellulose membrane in buffer containing 1 mm DTT. A diagrammatic illustration of this experimental strategy is shown in Fig. 2, and the result comparing immuno-Western blot detection of hHSF1 using the standardversus the reducing Western transfer procedure is shown in Fig. 3. We showed that whereas diamide treatment caused the hHSF1 protein to evade immunodetection in a standard Western blot procedure (Fig. 3 A), the equilibration and then transfer of proteins after electrophoresis in a buffer containing DTT allowed for the detection of a set of faster moving, and presumably more compact forms of ox-hHSF in both SDS- and native gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3, B and C, respectively). The fact that the ox-hHSF1 could be resolved from and in fact had a greater electrophoretic mobility than hHSF1, particularly in native gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3 C), has two important implications. First, it suggests that the reduced HSF1 protein was metastable and unable to maintain its compact conformation during electrophoresis. Second, the result argues for intramolecular rather than intermolecular disulfide cross-link. Together, the results in Figs. 1 and 3 showed that diamide promoted the formation of ox-hHSF1, an intramolecularly disulfide cross-linked hHSF1 conformer. This effect of diamide could be assessed either by the apparent loss of immunoreactivity of hHSF1 in a standard Western blot procedure or by the appearance of a more compact form (faster mobility) of the protein in both SDS- and native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis detectable with a “reducing” Western transfer procedure.Figure 3Diamide promoted formation of a compact disulfide cross-linked hHSF1 , and the immuno-Western blot detection of this oxidized hHSF1 required reduction of the disulfide bond after the gel electrophoresis procedure. Conditions of sample treatment are as follows: lane 1, untreated S100 control; lane 2, sample treated with 1 mm diamide (DM) for 30 min at 25 °C; lane 3, sample treated first with 1 mm diamide for 30 min at 25 °C followed by 5 mm dithiothreitol and incubation for another 30 min. The treated samples were mixed with an equal volume of the 2× non-reducing sample buffer and then subjected to analysis by gel electrophoresis and immuno-Western blot probing for hHSF1 as specified below. A,standard Western blot detection of hHSF1 in SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Samples were mixed with an equal volume of SDS sample buffer and subjected to analysis by SDS-PAGE. All procedures and buffers used (gel electrophoresis, equilibration, and transfer of proteins from the gel to nitrocellulose membrane) were done without dithiothreitol.B, reducing Western blot detection of hHSF1 in SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Upon completion of the SDS-PAGE procedure, the gel was equilibrated in a buffer containing 5 mm DTT, and proteins were transferred in buffer containing 1 mm DTT. The membrane was then probed for hHSF1 according to methods described in the text. C, reducing Western blot detection of hHSF1 in native polyacrylamide gel. Samples were mixed with an equal volume of the 2× sample buffer for native gel electrophoresis and then loaded onto a native 5.5% polyacrylamide gel. After the electrophoresis procedure, the gel was equilibrated in buffer containing 5 mm DTT; proteins were transferred in a buffer containing 1 mm DTT, and the presence of hHSF1 was probed as inB. The position of the native (and presumably reduced) hHSF1 protein is indicated by a brace. The position of the oxidized hHSF1 is indicated by *. We note that in both SDS- and native PAGE the mobility of the oxidized hHSF1 conformer is faster than the reduced hHSF1, suggesting intramolecular rather then intermolecular disulfide cross-link.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Studies with other cysteine-SH-directed reagents provided additional support that formation of the compact hHSF1 conformer is a result of disulfide cross-link. Fig. 4 Ashowed that the effect of diamide was blocked by prior treatment of the hHSF1 with N-ethylmaleimide, a cysteine-SH-alkylating agent (compare lanes 3 and 6). Similarly, in Fig.4 B, we showed that preincubation of the S100 extract with GSNO, a physiologically important carrier and donor of nitric oxide (34Stamler J.S. Jaraki O. Osborne J. Simon D.I.

NEM (Fig. 4 A, lane 5) and GSNO (Fig.4 B, lane 5) were by themselves without effect. The effects of GSNO were complex and dependent on the temperature of incubation. In Fig. 5 we showed that whereas incubation of the S100 extract with GSNO at 25 °C by itself had little or no effect on the mobility of hHSF1 in native PAGE, incubation at 42 °C promoted the formation of ox-hHSF1 (comparelanes 4 and 7), and this effect of GSNO was readily and completely reversed by DTT (compare lanes 7 and8). As controls, we showed that incubation at 42 °C without (lane 9) and with glutathione (GSH,lane 10) or sodium nitrate (NO2,lane 11) had no effect. Our observation of these distinct effects of GSNO on hHSF1 regulation at 25 versus 42 °C as presented in Fig. 5 is consistent with the suggested importance of both additive (trans-nitrosylation) and redox (e.g. disulfide bond formation) chemistry in subserving the many and diverse biological effects of GSNO (36Lipton S.A.

The hHSF1 protein can be induced to undergo monomer to trimer conversion in vitro by heat (42 °C) or by treatment with Nonidet P-40 or low pH buffer (28Larson J.S. Schuetz T.J. Kingston R.E.

Hamaguchi M. Hanafusa H. Nature. 1988; 332: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The v-Crk gene product is an adaptor protein containing a viral gag portion fused with a SH2 and SH3 domain. The corresponding cellular proto-oncogene was shown to exist in two splice variants, Crk I (28 kDa) and Crk II (42 kDa), of which Crk II encodes an additional N-terminal SH3 domain (2Reichman C.T. Mayer B.J. Keshav S. Hanafusa H. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 451-460PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, another closely related gene has been identified, CRKL, which is similar to Crk II (3ten Hoeve J. Morris C. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2469-2474PubMed Google Scholar). Both c-Crk II and CRKL are ubiquitously expressed (4Oehrl W. Kardinal C. Ruf S. Adermann K. Groffen J. Feng G.S. Blenis J. Tan T.H. Feller S.M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1893-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), suggesting an important cellular function. How does v-Crk induce oncogenicity? As an adaptor protein the v-Crk protein does not possess catalytic activity. Nevertheless the v-Crk-transformed cells contain enhanced levels of proteins phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, indicating the activation of a tyrosine kinase or the inactivation of a phosphotyrosine phosphatase (for review, see Ref. 5Feller S.M. Posern G. Voss J. Kardinal C. Sakkab D. Zheng J. Knudsen B.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 535-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Since tyrosine kinase activities often have been implicated in signal transduction and oncogenesis, this is likely to be involved. In v-Crk-transformed cells the most prominently phosphorylated proteins are Paxillin and p130cas (6Sabe H. Shoelson S.E. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31219-31224Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 7Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Reichman C. Shoelson S.E. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), both adapter proteins described as have signaling functions in focal adhesions (9Brugge J.S. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 309-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Focal adhesions are the sites where cells are bound to the extracellular matrix through integrin receptors that are connected to the intracellular actin cytoskeleton. In addition to their structural function, focal adhesions also serve to transduce extracellular signals via multiprotein complexes. Focal adhesion signaling has important functions in the regulation of cell morphology, cell cycle progression, and cell survival (10Howe A. Aplin A.E. Alahari S.K. Juliano R.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 220-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 11Meredith Jr., J.E. Schwartz M.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 146-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). v-Crk not only induced the phosphorylation of Paxillin and p130cas but also bound stably to their phosphorylated tyrosine residues through its SH2 domain (6Sabe H. Shoelson S.E. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31219-31224Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 7Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Reichman C. Shoelson S.E. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Hanafusa H. Mol.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). In accordance, v-Crk was shown to localize in focal adhesions (12Nievers M.G. Birge R.B. Greulich H. Verkleij A.J. Hanafusa H. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 389-399PubMed Google Scholar). Through its SH3 domain, v-Crk can bind to several downstream signaling molecules like DOCK180, Sos, and C3G and the kinases Abl, KHS, and HPK1 (for review, see Ref. 5Feller S.M. Posern G. Voss J. Kardinal C. Sakkab D. Zheng J. Knudsen B.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 535-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). These data suggest that v-Crk enhances focal complex signaling, but the mechanism resulting in oncogenicity is not known. v-Crk not only induces oncogenicity in fibroblast model systems; various data also suggest the involvement of Crk in human tumors. Particularly, CRKL is a major substrate protein of leukemogenic BCR-ABL proteins (13Senechal K. Halpern J. Sawyers C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23255-23261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These are the gene products of the chimericBCR/ABLoncogenes that are generated by the well known Philadelphia chromosome translocation and which cause chronic myelogenous leukemia. CRKL- and p130cas-mediated signaling is thought to play an important role in this disease (for review, see Ref.14Sattler M. Salgia R. Leukemia ( Baltimore ). 1998; 12: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recently BCAR1, a protein showing 91% amino acid identity with mouse and rat p130cas, has been identified by a random retroviral mutagenesis approach as being involved in breast cancer (15Brinkman A. van der Flier S. Kok E.M. Dorssers L.C. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Particularly, high levels of BCAR1 were associated with poor survival of patients (16van der Flier S. Brinkman A. Look M.P. Kok E.M. Meijer-van Gelder M.E. Klijn J.G. Dorssers L.C. Foekens J.A. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 120-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Since p130cas contains many binding sites for Crk (8Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), Crk may be the main downstream effector. In both cases the mechanism of tumorigenesis is not fully clear. Various aspects of focal adhesion signaling are shown to be stimulated by Crk, which might contribute to the oncogenic properties. Cell morphology and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton are affected by Crk-mediated activation of Rho-like GTPases, particularly Rac (17Kiyokawa E. Hashimoto Y. Kobayashi S. Sugimura H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3331-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 18Altun-Gultekin Z.F. Chandriani S. Bougeret C. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. de Graaf P. van Bergen en Henegouwen P. Hanafusa H. Wagner J.A. Birge R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3044-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In neuronal cells, v-Crk was shown to delay apoptosis (19Glassman R.H. Hempstead B.L. Staiano-Coico L. Steiner M.G. Hanafusa H. Birge R.B. Cell Death Diff. 1997; 4: 82-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), whereas in experiments using Xenopus lysates, Crk appeared to have an apoptosis stimulatory role (20Evans E.K. Lu W. Strum S.L. Mayer B.J. Kornbluth S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 230-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Crk may play a role in cell cycle progression (21Oktay M. Wary K.K. Dans M. Birge R.B. Giancotti F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1461-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In addition, however, various data indicate a role for Crk in growth factor-stimulation (e.g. Refs. 22Hempstead B.L. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Glassman R. Mahadeo D. Kraemer R. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1964-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar and23Beitner-Johnson D. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5187-5190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In this study we set out to investigate which mechanism could be involved in the v-Crk-induced oncogenesis by analyzing stably transformed NIH 3T3 fibroblast cell lines expressing v-Crk or v-Crk mutants that were previously described (12Nievers M.G. Birge R.B. Greulich H. Verkleij A.J. Hanafusa H. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 389-399PubMed Google Scholar). We and others showed that v-Crk induces in fibroblasts the capacity to grow in soft agar. This property is highly correlated with tumorigenicity and is considered to reflect anchorage independence of growth. In soft agar growth assays, v-Crk is less oncogenic than e.g. oncogenic Ras variants or v-Src. Similarly v-Crk induces an intermediary phenotype with respect to induction of a highly refractile spindle-shaped morphology in fibroblast cells (12Nievers M.G. Birge R.B. Greulich H. Verkleij A.J. Hanafusa H. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 389-399PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we compared the oncogenic properties of v-Crk-transformed NIH 3T3 cells with those of RasL61-transformed cells and found that v-Crk does not stimulate serum-independent growth. In contrast, our data indicate that the major v-Crk-induced effect is the protection of the fibroblast cells against cell death and particularly against apoptosis, which is also observed in the RasL61-transformed cells. Analysis of the pathways involved in the protection by v-Crk indicates the activation of the PKB1/Akt survival pathway as one of the mechanisms. 3-[4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and 4′,6′-diamidine-2′-phenylindole dihydochloride (DAPI) were from Sigma.

LY294002 was from Alexis, PD98059 from Biomol, and SB203580 was from Calbiochem. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. The NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with v-Crk and with v-CrkSH2− and SH3− have previously been described (12Nievers M.G. Birge R.B. Greulich H. Verkleij A.J. Hanafusa H. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 389-399PubMed Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with RasL61 were kindly provided by Dr. B. Burgering. COS-1-, NIH 3T3 (ATCC)-, and NIH 3T3-derived cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 7.5% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Relative cell number and viability was determined using MTT as a substrate (24Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46884) Google Scholar). In short, cells were cultured in 12-well plates and were incubated with the MTT solution for 60 min at 37 °C. Cells were lysed, and the formazan salt was solubilized in 0.04n HCl in isopropanol under continuous shaking. The absorbance was measured at 570 nm with a microplate reader (Bio-Rad). The background value without cells (A 570 ∼ 0.010) was subtracted. For the cell lines used, the MTT signal in the presented range was linearly correlated with the cell number, as counted by phase contrast microscopy. The MTT signal per cell was roughly similar for the cell lines used. For serum starvation survival experiments cells were incubated in serum-free medium for the indicated times. For UVC treatment (25Schreiber M. Baumann B. Cotten M. Angel P. Wagner E.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5338-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) cells were grown in a 12-well dish. Before UVC treatment cells were incubated for 20 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.075% fetal calf serum. Medium was removed, and UV treatment was performed in a Stratalinker (Stratagene) with the indicated doses (standard: 200 J/m2). After treatment with UV light, 1 ml of serum-free medium was added, and cells were incubated at 37 °C. At the indicated time points random field photographs were taken, and cell death was morphologically scored as the percentage of cells that are in the process of blebbing, that have a condensed nucleus, or that have lysed. Also, for visualization of condensed nuclei, the cells were grown on glass coverslips and similarly treated. They were fixed in ice-cold methanol (−20 °C) and subsequently incubated with 1 μg/ml DAPI in methanol for 5 min (room temperature). Cells were washed once with methanol and once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), air-dried, and mounted in 9 μl of Mowiol (Hoechst, Frankfurt, FRG) supplemented with 0.1% paraphenylene diamine. Fluorescent DNA-DAPI complexes were visualized in a Leica-Aristoplan microscope equipped with epi-illumination. Alternatively, when phase contrast pictures were taken, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, rinsed with PBS, permeabilized with ice-cold 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium citrate in PBS for 2 min, rinsed with PBS, stained with 0.4 μg/ml DAPI in PBS for 1 min, rinsed twice with PBS, and air-dried (26Kennedy S.G. Wagner A.J. Conzen S.D. Jordan J. Bellacosa A. Tsichlis P.N. Hay N. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 701-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). For annexin V staining, cells on glass coverslips were rinsed rapidly in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), 20 mm Hepes, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and incubated in DMEM, 20 mm Hepes, 0.1% BSA containing 0.25 μg of propidium iodine and 1 μl of concentrated annexin V-FITC (Nexins Research) for 10 min at room temperature in the dark. After washing in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 20 mmHepes, 0.1% bovine serum albumin cells were mounted in Mowiol/ paraphenylene diamine. Cell lysates and immunoprecipitates were solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer containing 0.1 mdithiothreitol and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (8%). Proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride filters that were blocked with 3% milk proteins (w/v, Protifar) in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 140 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for at least 1 h. The filters were probed with primary antibody in 0.3% protifar in TBST for at least 1 h (or overnight), washed four times in TBST, incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit) in 0.3% protifar in TBST buffer for 30 min and washed again four times with TBST. Proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Renaissance). For quantification of protein amounts, a densitometer (Molecular Dynamics) and ImageQuant software were used. Antibodies against PKB/Akt (1:2000) were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Where indicated, the phospho-specific Akt/PKB antibodies against phospho-Ser-473 (1:1500) was obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), whereas in addition, phospho-Ser-473-PKB antibodies (1:1500) were used fromBIOSOURCE International (Camarillo, CA) since the Biolabs antibodies gave significantly more background signal with nonphosphorylated PKB/Akt. The secondary antibodies (1:10000) were from Jackson ImmunoResearch (Pennsylvania, PA). Transient transfections in COS-1 cells were performed at 40% confluency with 4 μg of DNA/6-cm dish using the Fugene (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) transfection protocol. For co-transfection 2 μg of each plasmid/6-cm dish were transfected. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were serum-starved for 16 h. Stimulated and unstimulated cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) with freshly added 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Lysates were incubated on ice for 5 min and centrifuged for 5 min at 15,000 × g, and supernatants were precleared by incubating with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuging for 5 min at 15,000 ×g. HA-PKB was immune-precipitated from aliquots (200 μg of protein) of the precleared extracts using 2 μg of the monoclonal anti-HA antibody (12CA5) coupled to a (1:1) mixture of protein G-agarose beads and protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma).Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with low salt buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2) before Western blot analysis or twice with high salt buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, and 0.5 m LiCl) and twice with low salt buffer before activity measurements. One-third of the immunoprecipitates was used for Western blot analyses. Immune precipitation of endogenously expressed PKB/Akt from NIH 3T3-derived cell lines was performed similarly, except that cells were grown in 10-cm dishes and immune precipitation was performed with Immobilized Akt 1G1 monoclonal antibody (New England Biolabs). PKB activity was assayed with the Crosstide peptide (GRPRTSSFAEG) as a substrate as previously described (27Doornbos R.P. Theelen M. van der Hoeven P.C. van Blitterswijk W.J. Verkleij A.J. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8589-8596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were incubated with 45 μl of kinase assay mixture (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 30 μm Crosstide peptide, 1 μm specific peptide inhibitor of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKI) (Bachem, Bubendorf, Switzerland), 50 μm unlabeled ATP, and 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After incubation for 20 min at 30 °C under continuous shaking, reactions were stopped by the addition of 5 μl 200 mm EDTA. Proteins were precipitated by the addition of 12.5 μl 25% trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged for 1 min at 14,000 rpm. Supernatants containing the phosphorylated peptide were spotted onto p81 phosphocellulose filters (Whatman), washed three times with 1% (v/v) orthophosphoric acid, and analyzed by Cerenkov counting. Under the conditions used, the kinase assays are linear for at least 60 min. To investigate how v-Crk induces oncogenicity we first analyzed serum dependence and growth rate of stably transfected NIH 3T3 fibroblast cell lines expressing v-Crk (3T3v-Crk) or v-Crk mutants, mutated either in the SH2 (3T3SH2−) or the SH3 (3T3SH3−) domain of v-Crk. These previously described cell lines (12Nievers M.G. Birge R.B. Greulich H. Verkleij A.J. Hanafusa H. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 389-399PubMed Google Scholar) were compared with control NIH 3T3 cells (3T3) and RasL61-transformed cells (3T3Ras). Growth of these cell lines in the presence of 0.5, 2.0, or 7.5% fetal calf serum was monitored daily using a MTT assay. Fig. 1shows a representative time point, showing the relative cell densities after 3 days. Clearly no profound differences in growth were observed between 3T3v-Crk and NIH 3T3 control cells that could explain oncogenicity. It appeared that their doubling time is similar and their growth is similarly correlated with the serum concentration. At 0.5% serum, the cells complete their cell cycle, but in contrast to RasL61-transformed cells, none of the other cell lines continued to grow, showing a strict dependence on serum. The only difference observed is that 3T3v-Crk cells grow to higher saturation density than the control cells (12Nievers M.G. Birge R.B. Greulich H. Verkleij A.J. Hanafusa H. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 389-399PubMed Google Scholar), as was apparent with the MTT assay after 4 days of growth (not shown) and was confirmed by phase contrast microscopy. For comparison, highly oncogenic 3T3Ras-transformed cells require less serum, grow more rapidly, and grow to even higher saturation densities (Fig. 1). They grow even in serum-free conditions (see next paragraph). The 3T3SH3− cell line that expresses the SH3− mutant v-Crk protein has growth characteristics similar to NIH 3T3. In contrast, the 3T3SH2− cells grow more slowly, reach lower cell densities, and die in the presence of 0.5% fetal calf serum. Apparently the SH2 mutant of v-Crk has a negative effect, both with respect to cell growth and survival. As compared with RasL61, v-Crk clearly induces more restricted oncogenic properties. To investigate a possible role of v-Crk in cell survival, the effect of serum deprivation was further investigated. Serum deprivation results in rapid cell death of control NIH 3T3 cells; within 48 h, ∼95% of the cells die (Fig. 2). The 3T3v-Crk cells on the other hand are more resistant against serum withdrawal; ∼40–50% of the cells survive for even longer than a week, as is also seen by phase contrast microscopy. RasL61-transformed cells continue growing in serum-free conditions. The surviving v-Crk-transformed cells were fully capable of growing when serum was added again (not shown). To determine the role of the SH2 and SH3 domains of v-Crk in mediating protection against cell death, the mutant cell lines were assayed. The 3T3SH3− cell line dies with similar kinetics to NIH 3T3, whereas the 3T3SH2− cell line is significantly more sensitive to serum starvation-induced cell death (Fig. 2). Thus, v-Crk protects against cell death, and both the SH2 and SH3 domain of v-Crk are required for this protection. In addition, the v-Crk mutant protein mutated in the SH2 domain (v-CrkSH2−) enhances cell death, having a dominant negative function with respect to survival. Figs. 1 and 2 indicate that the main growth difference between NIH 3T3- and v-Crk-transformed NIH 3T3 cells is the ability of 3T3v-Crk to survive in serum-free conditions. Inhibition of apoptosis by v-Crk would provide a physiological selective advantage in vivo for v-Crk-transformed cells. The MTT assay (Fig. 2) measures the number of surviving cells but does not distinguish between death by necrosis or apoptosis. Actually, an important characteristic of apoptosis is that during the programmed cell death the cell membrane remains impermeable, and the cell content is not released. Using phase contrast microscopy we noticed that blebbing apoptotic cells are still capable of forming dark blue formazan crystals in the MTT assay. A decrease in MTT signal due to apoptosis is therefore only observed when (apoptotic) cells detach from the substratum or when they have lysed due to secondary necrosis. Using nuclear DAPI staining, we found that cell death upon serum starvation (48 h) results in nuclear condensation, characteristic of apoptosis (Fig. 3A). To further prove that cell death occurred due to apoptosis, annexin V binding assays were performed. Annexin V binds to phosphatidylserine, a phospholipid that normally is present at the inner leaflet of the cell membrane but during apoptosis is exposed at the outer leaflet. In the presence of serum, neither NIH 3T3 cells nor 3T3v-Crk cells bound annexin V. However, after 24 h of serum depletion the NIH 3T3 cells heavily stained with annexin V-FITC, and 3T3v-Crk cultures stained significantly less (Fig. 3B, panels B andE). Annexin V-FITC staining of starved NIH 3T3 cells revealed that many cell fragments (presumably derived from blebs: see next paragraph) are shedded off. In addition, some NIH 3T3 cells are in necrosis, as is revealed by their plasma membrane permeability for propidium iodine (Fig. 3B, panel C, red arrow). In conclusion, both DAPI and annexin V staining demonstrate the protective effects of v-Crk expression against apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal. To test if v-Crk also protects against apoptosis induced by other methods, UVC treatment was applied. After overnight serum starvation, cells were treated with various doses of UVC light and analyzed for apoptosis by morphological criteria and by analyzing nuclear condensation by DAPI staining. After treatment with 200 J/m2 UV light for 5 h, more than 80% of the NIH 3T3 cells are apoptotic or in (secondary) necrosis. Fig.4A illustrates that UVC irradiation induces apoptosis, as shown both by nuclear condensation and cell membrane blebbing. A higher magnification of a typical blebbing cell shows many cell protrusions that are connected to the cell body only through a thin stalk, as is nicely illustrated in cells expressing green fluorescent protein (Fig. 4B). Later in the apoptotic process the protrusions are pinched off while still containing green fluorescent protein, implying that the plasma membrane is still intact, which is characteristic of apoptosis (results not shown). The effect of 200 J/m2 UVC on survival of the different cell lines is represented in Fig. 4C. It shows that the v-Crk-transformed cells are protected against UV-induced apoptosis, as compared with NIH 3T3 cells. Similar conclusions were reached using other UV doses (50, 100, 400, 600 J/m2) and at different time points after UV treatment (results not shown). Again, survival of the v-CrkSH3 mutant-expressing cells is similar to the NIH 3T3 cells. The SH2 mutant-expressing cells are slightly more sensitive to UV-induced apoptosis. RasL61-transformed cells do not undergo apoptosis at all in these conditions. Other apoptotic stimuli including H2O2 and osmotic stress were also tested (not shown). In all cases tested, v-Crk provided protection against apoptosis. As a first approach in determining which signaling pathways might be activated by v-Crk to inhibit apoptosis, we used pharmacological inhibitors. The best-described anti-apoptotic pathway is the PI 3-kinase-PKB/Akt pathway, which can be inhibited by the PI 3-kinase inhibitors LY924002 and wortmannin. Because v-Crk has been implicated in activation of the Ras-Raf-MEK-Erk pathway (28York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J.

The N-terminal amino acid residue of the β subunit of mature OATase has been shown to be a threonine and cleavage shown to occur between the alanine and threonine residues in a conserved ATML sequence of the precursor proteins (2Marc F.

N., Jr. (1996) Glycobiology 669–675.Google Scholar). In glycosylasparaginase from Flavobacterium, structural and biochemical studies have shown that cleavage results from a nucleophilic threonine attack on the peptide linkage with the preceding aspartate residue (7Guan C.

Cell. 1999; 98: 651-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In addition to threonine the deprotonated side chains of cysteine and serine residues, are also able to attack a preceding carbonyl group resulting in N → O or N → S shift (8Xu Q. Buckley D. Guan C. Guo H.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 651-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 9Liu Y. Guan C. Aronson Jr., N.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9688-9694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The peptide amide bond is therefore replaced with a more reactive (thio)ester bond, and a subsequent attack by a second nucleophile, which can be an activated water molecule, breaks the ester bond thereby exposing Thr, Cys, or Ser at the N terminus of the downstream peptide (10Perler F.B. Nature Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Thus the question arises as to how the cleavage of the OATase precursor protein is accomplished in procaryotes. To answer this question we have investigated the thermostable OATase from B. stearothermophilus. Our data indicate that precursor protein cleavage is necessary for enzyme activation and that the invariant threonine Thr-197 is responsible for the self-catalyzed cleavage reaction.DISCUSSIONOur previous studies on three procaryotic OATases indicated autoproteolysis as a likely mechanism for the intramolecular cleavage of the OATase preprotein into α and β subunits, which together constitute the active enzyme (2Marc F. Weigel P. Legrain C. Almeras Y. Santrot M. Glansdorff N. Sakanyan V. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5217-5226Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In agreement with this hypothesis the results of the present study show that two α and β subunits can be formed in vitro in the presence of protease inhibitors, that cleavage of the precursor protein occurs in a wide range of pH values at 69 °C (a temperature at which a majority of the E. coli host proteases are inactive), and that cleavage either does not occur or proceeds very slowly when the conserved threonine is substituted. Therefore we conclude that the single chain precursor protein of B. stearothermophilus OATase indeed undergoes self-catalyzed autoprocessing. Furthermore our data emphasize that the invariant Thr-197 plays a crucial role in this autoproteolysis because no cleavage could be detected when threonine had been replaced by glycine and because no protein assembling could be observed when the two subunits had been expressed separately and then mixed together. However, the hydroxyl group of serine or the thiol group of cysteine at position 197 in the precursor protein still permits a low rate intramolecular cleavage of mutant precursor proteins as compared with wild-type OATase. Thus, as found for other autoprocessing pathways (see Ref 10Perler F.B. Nature Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) it appears that the side chain of Thr, Ser, or Cys in the OATase precursor protein can participate in proton transfer to provide a transition from the preexisting peptide bond to an active (thiol) ester bond which is then broken to liberate the α and β subunits, exposing alanine at the C terminus of the α subunit and one of the above mentioned amino acids at the N terminus of the β subunit. Therefore, the invariant threonine, being conserved in more than 40 available OATase sequences from bacteria, archaea, and eucaryotes, should play a crucial role in the preOATase protein self-catalyzed cleavage.Given the crucial role of the invariant threonine in intramolecular cleavage of preOATase, we assume that the processing of a wild-type OATase precursor from B. stearothermophilus is similar to the processing of glycosylasparaginase from Flavobacterium(8Xu Q. Buckley D. Guan C. Guo H.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 651-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 22Guo H.-C. Xu Q. Buckley D. Guan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20205-20212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). When the de novo synthesized OATase precursor is correctly folded, the hydroxyl group of Thr-197 can be deprotonated and its nucleophilicity become enhanced (Fig.6). A nucleophilic attack on the α-carbonyl group of Ala-196 can then lead to the formation of a cyclic tetrahydral intermediate with a negatively charged carbonyl oxygen and then to the formation of a reactive ester bond. Hydrolysis by a nucleophilic water molecule (or by another nucleophile) can lead to the formation of the next intermediary tetrahydral state from which a breakage reaction liberates two nascent subunits thus exposing the threonine residue at the N terminus of the β subunit.The ping-pong kinetic mechanism of OATase indicates that an acetylated intermediate is formed by covalent binding of the acetyl group from a corresponding donor (2Marc F. Weigel P. Legrain C. Almeras Y. Santrot M. Glansdorff N. Sakanyan V. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5217-5226Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This intermediate appears to be rather unstable because, in the absence of an acetyl group acceptor, some CoA is formed (see Table I) presumably by hydrolysis of the acetylated intermediate. The acetylation reaction itself requires deprotonation of a particular amino acid which should be located in the β subunit as only this subunit has been found to be acetylated in OATase. Our data show that self-catalyzed precursor cleavage is a necessary step to form active OATase, probably by directing appropriate folding and/or topological organization of the active site in the oligomeric molecule. Indeed, replacement of the invariant threonine by glycine completely abolishes enzymatic activity. The two other substitutions, T197S and T197C, slow down precursor protein autocleavage but also cause significant loss of OATase activity. The fact that the T197S and T197C mutant proteins still exhibit low enzymatic activity after complete cleavage of precursors and association of subunits into heterotetrameric molecules indicates that, in addition to autoproteolysis, these mutants are affected in catalysis as well. A probability is that an N-terminally positioned Thr-197 in the β subunit is involved in the enzymatic mechanism; this could be by mediating the transfer of the acetyl group from the acetylated intermediate to the l-glutamate acceptor molecule or by inducing an appropriate conformation at the active site.It is worth noting that this hypothesis of a crucial function for the invariant threonine in both preprotein cleavage and OATase catalytic mechanism could explain an apparent discrepancy between our results and the conclusions of Abadjieva et al. (5Abadjieva A. Hilven P. Pauwels K. Crabeel M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11361-11367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) concerning the maturation of active yeast OATase. These authors independently proposed OATase autoproteolytic processing and found that the replacement of threonine 215 (referred to by us as Thr-197 for B. stearothermophilus) by alanine abolishes activity in yeast OATase (5Abadjieva A. Hilven P. Pauwels K. Crabeel M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11361-11367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, they also observed that a S. cerevisiae strain deleted for the OATase gene and carrying two plasmids with separately cloned and expressed yeast α and β subunits (in the latter case a methionine residue had been introduced at the N terminus to initiate translation) still exhibited a weak OATase activity. In contrast, from a plasmid providing concomitant but independent expression of B. stearothermophilus OATase α and β subunits from the same mRNA, we have observed no complementation of E. coli argE or argA mutants and could detect no OATase activity whether the invariant threonine was immediately preceded or replaced by a methionine residue. The fact that OATase activity is only partly restored when using the yeast constructions was attributed by Abadjieva et al. to the presence of the methionine residue introduced at the N terminus of the β subunit (5Abadjieva A. Hilven P. Pauwels K. Crabeel M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11361-11367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, if we consider that the invariant threonine is essential for the OATase-mediated catalytic mechanism and not only for processing, then the low activity measured in yeast could be due to partial removal of the N-terminal methionine (21Li X. Chang H-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12357-12361Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar); this would expose the threonine residue at the N terminus and thus mimic the result of self-catalyzed processing from a precursor.Microbial OATases belong to the N-terminal transferases family of enzymes. N-acetyltransferases play important roles in various processes such as the expression of eucaryotic genes, the inactivation or activation of drugs in bacterial and mammalian cells, the morphogenesis of membranes, the formation of nodules during the establishment of symbiotic relationships between bacteria and plants, and the emergence of metabolic pathways for several amino acids. All these enzymes catalyze acetyl group transfer from acetyl-CoA to a primary amino group in different target molecules, including proteins, lipids, amino acids, sugars, and still other compounds (for a review see Ref. 23Kouzarides T.

Sci. 1997; 22: 154-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). However, in addition to self-catalyzed intramolecular cleavage OATases exhibit other features not yet detected among the above mentioned N-acetyltransferases; monofunctional OATases are able to accept the acetyl group from a donor other than acetyl-CoA, namely from N-acetyl-l-ornithine, whereas bifunctional OATases are active toward both acetyl-CoA andN-acetyl-l-ornithine. These features as well as the absence of similarity between well characterizedN-acetyltransferases and OATases reflect their distant evolutionary relationship (30Sakanyan V. Petrosyan P. Lecocq M.

Further structural and enzymatic studies of OATases may help to understand the molecular mechanism which couple self-catalyzed cleavage of the precursor to transacetylation catalysis and to elucidate the phylogenetic position of these enzymes among other N-acetyltransferases.AcknowledgementsWe are grateful to Daniel Gigot for providing labeled N-acetyl-l-glutamate.

Biochem. 1995; 228: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), OATase has been shown to be synthesized as a precursor protein that undergoes proteolytic cleavage, leading to the formation of α and β subunits that assemble into heterodimeric or heterotetrameric molecules in eucaryotes or procaryotes, respectively. The N-terminal amino acid residue of the β subunit of mature OATase has been shown to be a threonine and cleavage shown to occur between the alanine and threonine residues in a conserved ATML sequence of the precursor proteins (2Marc F.

Biochem. 1997; 250: 232-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Cleavage of the yeast OATase precursor has been suggested to be self-catalyzed rather than protease-assisted (5Abadjieva A.

Posttranslational autoproteolysis has been described for several proteins from eucaryotes and procaryotes (6Aronson, N. N., Jr. (1996) Glycobiology 669–675.Google Scholar). In glycosylasparaginase from Flavobacterium, structural and biochemical studies have shown that cleavage results from a nucleophilic threonine attack on the peptide linkage with the preceding aspartate residue (7Guan C.

Cell. 1999; 98: 651-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In addition to threonine the deprotonated side chains of cysteine and serine residues, are also able to attack a preceding carbonyl group resulting in N → O or N → S shift (8Xu Q. Buckley D. Guan C. Guo H.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 651-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 9Liu Y. Guan C. Aronson Jr., N.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9688-9694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The peptide amide bond is therefore replaced with a more reactive (thio)ester bond, and a subsequent attack by a second nucleophile, which can be an activated water molecule, breaks the ester bond thereby exposing Thr, Cys, or Ser at the N terminus of the downstream peptide (10Perler F.B. Nature Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus the question arises as to how the cleavage of the OATase precursor protein is accomplished in procaryotes. To answer this question we have investigated the thermostable OATase from B. stearothermophilus. Our data indicate that precursor protein cleavage is necessary for enzyme activation and that the invariant threonine Thr-197 is responsible for the self-catalyzed cleavage reaction. DISCUSSIONOur previous studies on three procaryotic OATases indicated autoproteolysis as a likely mechanism for the intramolecular cleavage of the OATase preprotein into α and β subunits, which together constitute the active enzyme (2Marc F. Weigel P. Legrain C. Almeras Y. Santrot M. Glansdorff N. Sakanyan V. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5217-5226Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In agreement with this hypothesis the results of the present study show that two α and β subunits can be formed in vitro in the presence of protease inhibitors, that cleavage of the precursor protein occurs in a wide range of pH values at 69 °C (a temperature at which a majority of the E. coli host proteases are inactive), and that cleavage either does not occur or proceeds very slowly when the conserved threonine is substituted. Therefore we conclude that the single chain precursor protein of B. stearothermophilus OATase indeed undergoes self-catalyzed autoprocessing. Furthermore our data emphasize that the invariant Thr-197 plays a crucial role in this autoproteolysis because no cleavage could be detected when threonine had been replaced by glycine and because no protein assembling could be observed when the two subunits had been expressed separately and then mixed together. However, the hydroxyl group of serine or the thiol group of cysteine at position 197 in the precursor protein still permits a low rate intramolecular cleavage of mutant precursor proteins as compared with wild-type OATase. Thus, as found for other autoprocessing pathways (see Ref 10Perler F.B. Nature Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) it appears that the side chain of Thr, Ser, or Cys in the OATase precursor protein can participate in proton transfer to provide a transition from the preexisting peptide bond to an active (thiol) ester bond which is then broken to liberate the α and β subunits, exposing alanine at the C terminus of the α subunit and one of the above mentioned amino acids at the N terminus of the β subunit. Therefore, the invariant threonine, being conserved in more than 40 available OATase sequences from bacteria, archaea, and eucaryotes, should play a crucial role in the preOATase protein self-catalyzed cleavage.Given the crucial role of the invariant threonine in intramolecular cleavage of preOATase, we assume that the processing of a wild-type OATase precursor from B. stearothermophilus is similar to the processing of glycosylasparaginase from Flavobacterium(8Xu Q. Buckley D. Guan C. Guo H.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 651-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 22Guo H.-C. Xu Q. Buckley D. Guan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20205-20212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). When the de novo synthesized OATase precursor is correctly folded, the hydroxyl group of Thr-197 can be deprotonated and its nucleophilicity become enhanced (Fig.6). A nucleophilic attack on the α-carbonyl group of Ala-196 can then lead to the formation of a cyclic tetrahydral intermediate with a negatively charged carbonyl oxygen and then to the formation of a reactive ester bond. Hydrolysis by a nucleophilic water molecule (or by another nucleophile) can lead to the formation of the next intermediary tetrahydral state from which a breakage reaction liberates two nascent subunits thus exposing the threonine residue at the N terminus of the β subunit.The ping-pong kinetic mechanism of OATase indicates that an acetylated intermediate is formed by covalent binding of the acetyl group from a corresponding donor (2Marc F. Weigel P. Legrain C. Almeras Y. Santrot M. Glansdorff N. Sakanyan V. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5217-5226Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This intermediate appears to be rather unstable because, in the absence of an acetyl group acceptor, some CoA is formed (see Table I) presumably by hydrolysis of the acetylated intermediate. The acetylation reaction itself requires deprotonation of a particular amino acid which should be located in the β subunit as only this subunit has been found to be acetylated in OATase. Our data show that self-catalyzed precursor cleavage is a necessary step to form active OATase, probably by directing appropriate folding and/or topological organization of the active site in the oligomeric molecule. Indeed, replacement of the invariant threonine by glycine completely abolishes enzymatic activity. The two other substitutions, T197S and T197C, slow down precursor protein autocleavage but also cause significant loss of OATase activity. The fact that the T197S and T197C mutant proteins still exhibit low enzymatic activity after complete cleavage of precursors and association of subunits into heterotetrameric molecules indicates that, in addition to autoproteolysis, these mutants are affected in catalysis as well. A probability is that an N-terminally positioned Thr-197 in the β subunit is involved in the enzymatic mechanism; this could be by mediating the transfer of the acetyl group from the acetylated intermediate to the l-glutamate acceptor molecule or by inducing an appropriate conformation at the active site.It is worth noting that this hypothesis of a crucial function for the invariant threonine in both preprotein cleavage and OATase catalytic mechanism could explain an apparent discrepancy between our results and the conclusions of Abadjieva et al. (5Abadjieva A. Hilven P. Pauwels K. Crabeel M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11361-11367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) concerning the maturation of active yeast OATase. These authors independently proposed OATase autoproteolytic processing and found that the replacement of threonine 215 (referred to by us as Thr-197 for B. stearothermophilus) by alanine abolishes activity in yeast OATase (5Abadjieva A. Hilven P. Pauwels K. Crabeel M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11361-11367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, they also observed that a S. cerevisiae strain deleted for the OATase gene and carrying two plasmids with separately cloned and expressed yeast α and β subunits (in the latter case a methionine residue had been introduced at the N terminus to initiate translation) still exhibited a weak OATase activity. In contrast, from a plasmid providing concomitant but independent expression of B. stearothermophilus OATase α and β subunits from the same mRNA, we have observed no complementation of E. coli argE or argA mutants and could detect no OATase activity whether the invariant threonine was immediately preceded or replaced by a methionine residue. The fact that OATase activity is only partly restored when using the yeast constructions was attributed by Abadjieva et al. to the presence of the methionine residue introduced at the N terminus of the β subunit (5Abadjieva A. Hilven P. Pauwels K. Crabeel M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11361-11367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, if we consider that the invariant threonine is essential for the OATase-mediated catalytic mechanism and not only for processing, then the low activity measured in yeast could be due to partial removal of the N-terminal methionine (21Li X. Chang H-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12357-12361Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar); this would expose the threonine residue at the N terminus and thus mimic the result of self-catalyzed processing from a precursor.Microbial OATases belong to the N-terminal transferases family of enzymes. N-acetyltransferases play important roles in various processes such as the expression of eucaryotic genes, the inactivation or activation of drugs in bacterial and mammalian cells, the morphogenesis of membranes, the formation of nodules during the establishment of symbiotic relationships between bacteria and plants, and the emergence of metabolic pathways for several amino acids. All these enzymes catalyze acetyl group transfer from acetyl-CoA to a primary amino group in different target molecules, including proteins, lipids, amino acids, sugars, and still other compounds (for a review see Ref. 23Kouzarides T.

However, in addition to self-catalyzed intramolecular cleavage OATases exhibit other features not yet detected among the above mentioned N-acetyltransferases; monofunctional OATases are able to accept the acetyl group from a donor other than acetyl-CoA, namely from N-acetyl-l-ornithine, whereas bifunctional OATases are active toward both acetyl-CoA andN-acetyl-l-ornithine. These features as well as the absence of similarity between well characterizedN-acetyltransferases and OATases reflect their distant evolutionary relationship (30Sakanyan V. Petrosyan P. Lecocq M.

The hydrolase reaction occurs in a 310-amino acid long amino-terminal domain of FDH (Nt-FDH), whereas the dehydrogenase reaction requires the full-length enzyme. The amino-terminal domain of FDH shares some sequence identity with several other enzymes utilizing 10-formyl-THF as a substrate. These enzymes have two strictly conserved residues, aspartate and histidine, in the putative catalytic center. We have shown recently that the conserved aspartate is involved in FDH catalysis. In the present work we studied the role of the conserved histidine, His106, in FDH function. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments showed that replacement of the histidine with alanine, asparagine, aspartate, glutamate, glutamine, or arginine in Nt-FDH resulted in expression of insoluble proteins. Replacement of the histidine with another positively charged residue, lysine, produced a soluble mutant with no hydrolase activity. The insoluble mutants refolded from inclusion bodies adopted a conformation inherent to the wild-type Nt-FDH, but they did not exhibit any hydrolase activity. Substitution of alanine for three non-conserved histidines located close to the conserved one did not reveal any significant changes in the hydrolase activity of Nt-FDH. Expressed full-length FDH with the substitution of lysine for the His106 completely lost both the hydrolase and dehydrogenase activities. Thus, our study showed that His106, besides being an important structural residue, is also directly involved in both the hydrolase and dehydrogenase mechanisms of FDH. Modeling of the putative hydrolase catalytic center/folate-binding site suggested that the catalytic residues, aspartate and histidine, are unlikely to be adjacent to the catalytic cysteine in the aldehyde dehydrogenase catalytic center. We hypothesize that 10-formyl-THF dehydrogenase reaction is not an independent reaction but is a combination of hydrolase and aldehyde dehydrogenase reactions.

FDH is a homotetramer of 902-amino acid residue monomers (5Schirch D. Villar E. Maras B. Barra D. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24728-24735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 519-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Each monomer consists of two functional domains, amino- and carboxyl-terminal, connected by about a 100-amino acid residue linker which is not part of either catalytic domain (1Cook R.J. Lloyd R.S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 10273-10278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal domain of FDH is up to 50% homologous to proteins from a family of aldehyde dehydrogenases (1Cook R.J. Lloyd R.S. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4965-4973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hempel J. Nicholas H. Lindahl R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1890-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Expressed separately, this domain possesses aldehyde dehydrogenase activity (7Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10266-10272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) as well as the full-length FDH (1Cook R.J. Lloyd R.S. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4965-4973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hydrolase activity resides in a 310-amino acid residue amino-terminal domain of FDH (Nt-FDH) (5Schirch D. Villar E. Maras B. Barra D. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24728-24735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10273-10278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The dehydrogenase reaction requires participation of the second, aldehyde-dehydrogenase homologous, functional domain and occurs only when the two domains work in concert, having been combined in one polypeptide (5Schirch D. Villar E. Maras B. Barra D. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24728-24735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 10273-10278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal domain of FDH bears the folate-binding site and reveals sequence identity to other enzymes that use 10-formyl-THF as a substrate (1Cook R.J. Lloyd R.S. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4965-4973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10273-10278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the cell, 10-formyl-THF is used in three biosynthetic reactions where it serves as a formyl donor (10Wagner, C., Folate in Health and Disease, Bailey, L., 1995, 23, 42, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York.Google Scholar). Two of the reactions are involved in de novo purine biosynthesis (11Benkovic S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1984; 9: 320-322Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and are accomplished by glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GART, EC 2.1.2.2) (12Daubner S.C. Schrimsher J.L. Schendel F.J. Young M. Henikoff S. Patterson D. Stubbe J.A. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7059-7062Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (EC2.1.2.3) (13Mueller W.T. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The reactions result in incorporation of two carbons into the purine ring. Another minor biosynthetic reaction that requires 10-formyl-THF is formylation of the amino acid in methionyl-tRNA (14Guillon J.-M. Mechulam Y. Schmitter J.-M. Blanquet S. Fayat G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4294-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This is a specialized tRNA used for initiation of translation in prokaryotes, distinct from the one involved in methionine incorporation during polypeptide chain elongation. Such a formylation is also encountered in chloroplasts and mitochondria of eukaryotes (14Guillon J.-M. Mechulam Y. Schmitter J.-M. Blanquet S. Fayat G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4294-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The reaction is catalyzed by 10-formyltetrahydrofolate:l-methionyl-tRNAN-formyltransferase (FMT, EC 2.1.2.9) (14Guillon J.-M. Mechulam Y. Schmitter J.-M. Blanquet S. Fayat G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4294-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Despite low overall sequence identity, 10-formyl-THF-utilizing enzymes bear some common structural elements (1Cook R.J. Lloyd R.S. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4965-4973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10273-10278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, there are two strictly conserved residues, an aspartate and a histidine located within the most conserved region in the middle of the enzyme molecules (1Cook R.J. Lloyd R.S. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4965-4973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10273-10278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that these residues participate in folate binding and/or catalysis (1Cook R.J. Lloyd R.S. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4965-4973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Inglese J. Smith J.M. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6678-6687Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). An aspartate/histidine pair is found as a catalytic dyad or part of catalytic triad in the active site of a number of enzymes including serine proteases (16Blow D.M. Birktoft J.J. Hartley B.S. Nature. 1969; 221: 337-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar, 17Blow D.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 405-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 18Dodson G.

Nutr. 2000; 130: 1437S-1446SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). From the group of 10-formyl-THF-converting enzymes, the GART mechanism and structure have been studied in more detail (15Inglese J. Smith J.M. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6678-6687Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 25Warren M.S. Marolewski A.E. Benkovic S.J.

Biol. 1998; 281: 485-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It was shown that replacement of the conserved aspartate with asparagine resulted in catalytically inactive enzyme (15Inglese J. Smith J.M. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6678-6687Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Later it was shown that both conserved residues, the aspartate and the histidine, are adjacent to the folate substrate bound to GART (28Almassy R.J. Janson C.A. Kan C.-C. Hostomska Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6114-6118Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 30Klein C. Chen P. Arevalo J.H. Stura E.A. Marolewski A. Warren M.S. Benkovic S.J. Wilson I.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 153-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and are involved in the enzyme catalysis (25Warren M.S. Marolewski A.E. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8855-8862Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Replacement of either of the residues resulted in an enzyme with substantially reduced activity, whereas the double mutant was completely inactive (25Warren M.S. Marolewski A.E. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8855-8862Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Studies on another enzyme, FMT, also showed that these residues are in close proximity to each other within the substrate binding pocket (32Schmitt E. Blanquet S. Mechulam Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4749-4758Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and they are involved in the enzyme catalysis (33Newton D.T. Mangroo D. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The third 10-formyl-THF utilizing enzyme, AICAR formyltransferase, that carries out a reaction very similar to that of GART, also revealed the presence of the histidine and aspartate (34Rayl E.A Moroson B.A. Beardsley G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2225-2233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In contrast to GART and FMT, however, it has been shown that these residues are not involved in aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase function (34Rayl E.A Moroson B.A. Beardsley G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2225-2233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This led to the conclusion that they are just part of a common structural element. Recently, we have shown (35Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35777-35784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) that similar to GART and FMT the conserved aspartate is involved in FDH catalysis. In the present work we studied the role of another conserved residue, histidine 106, in the FDH mechanism. 10-Formyl-5,8-dideazafolate (10-formyl-DDF) and 5,8-dideazafolate (DDF) were obtained from Dr. John B. Hynes, Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Medical University of South Carolina. All media were obtained from Difco or Life Technologies, Inc. SDS-PAGE standards were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.Other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. We used the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to introduce point mutations into Nt-FDH cDNA cloned to pRSET vector (36Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 14: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) or into full-length FDH cDNA cloned to pVL 1393 vector (37Krupenko S.A. Horstman D.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). After introduction of mutation the vector was transformed intoEscherichia coli XL-1 Blue cells using a standard protocol, and the cells were grown on LB ampicillin plates to allow mutant selection. Plasmids were isolated by using Quantum Prep kit (Bio-Rad) and sequenced to identify clones carrying the mutation. The entire coding region of the clones carrying the designed mutations was sequenced to ensure the absence of random mutations. Expression of Nt-FDH mutants has been done as we described earlier (36Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 14: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The vector with mutation was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and the cells were grown in 4 ml of NZCYM medium containing ampicillin (50 mg/ml) overnight at 37 °C with shaking. The 100 ml of NZCYM medium containing ampicillin was inoculated with the overnight culture and incubated at 37 °C with shaking untilA600 = 0.6 (about 6 h) followed by induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm final concentration). Three hours after induction the cells were harvested by centrifugation (5,000 × g, 10 min), resuspended in 2 ml of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100), and incubated for 30 min with 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme at 37 °C. The suspension was chilled on ice and sonicated (3 times for 30 s). The insoluble material was precipitated by centrifugation (18,000 × g, 15 min). The pellet was dissolved in 5 ml of 6 m urea by continuous stirring for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant and the dissolved pellet were examined for the presence of the Nt-FDH by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot technique. The mutant was purified using the procedure that we developed earlier (36Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 14: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) for wild-type Nt-FDH. All buffers used in the purification steps contained 1 mmNaN3. The supernatant of cell lysate (2 ml) obtained as described above was dialyzed overnight against 20 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, and was then passed through a 0.2-mm filter (Nalgene) to remove insoluble contaminants. Purification was done on a DEAE-MemSep 1000 HP Ion Exchange Membrane Chromatography cartridge (Millipore) with a linear NaCl gradient (0–0.4 m in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) using a ConSep LC100 chromatographic system (Millipore). Lysate samples of 1 ml each containing about 4 mg of total protein were applied in the chromatography run. The chromatography was done at a flow rate of 4.0 ml/min, and fractions of 0.8 ml were collected. The fractions were analyzed for the presence of Nt-FDH by SDS-PAGE. The fractions containing Nt-FDH were combined, dialyzed against 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, concentrated on Centricon 10 (Amicon-Millipore), and stored at 4 °C in the presence of 1 mm NaN3and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. After dissolving the pellet in 6m urea, the sample (0.1 mg/ml protein) was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, for 18 h at 4 °C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (18,000 × g, 15 min), and the soluble sample was subjected to the chromatography procedure on ion-exchange resin as described for the soluble H106K mutant. The expression of the full-length FDH mutants has been done in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system as we described previously (37Krupenko S.A. Horstman D.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The vector carrying mutated FDH cDNA and linearized AcNPV viral DNA was co-transfected into Sf9 cells using the BaculoGold transfection kit (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Recombinant viral stock was amplified in Sf9 cells to produce high titer virus stock. High five cells were seeded as a monolayer in 25-cm2 flasks (about 2 × 106cells per flask) and grown overnight. Each flask was infected with 0.1 ml of high titer virus stock. Culture medium and cells were collected separately 2–4 days post-infection, and the recombinant protein production was detected by SDS-PAGE (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar) followed by Western immunoblot analysis (39Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5889) Google Scholar). For large scale recombinant protein production, High five cells were seeded in 225-cm2 flasks (about 20 × 106 cells per flask), and after growing overnight each flask was infected with 1.0 ml of high-titer virus stock. The culture medium 96 h post-infection was collected, centrifuged to remove detached cells, and used to isolate recombinant protein. All buffers used in purification steps contained 10 mm 2-ME and 1 mmNaN3. Mutants were purified from the cell-free culture medium by affinity chromatography on a column of Sepharose-5-formyltetrahydrofolate essentially as we described earlier (40Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 651-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A column (1.5 × 10 cm) was packed with about 8.0 ml of settled gel and equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm 2-ME and 1 mmNaN3 (buffer 1). Medium (200 ml) plus 2-ME (10 mm) and NaN3 (1 mm) was applied to the affinity column. The column was then washed with buffer 1 containing 1 m KCl (100 ml). The enzyme was eluted from the column with buffer 1 containing 1 m KCl and 20 mm folic acid. The eluate was passed through a column of Bio-Gel P6-DG (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with buffer 1 to remove unbound folate. The eluate was concentrated to ∼5 ml using an Amicon (Beverly, MA) filtration cell. Additional purification was done on a Mono Q column with a linear KCl gradient (0–0.5 m in buffer 1) using a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). SDS-PAGE was carried out according to the method of Laemmli (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar) in 8.0 or 12.5% gel. Western immunoblot analysis was performed as described by Burnette (39Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5889) Google Scholar) with rabbit polyclonal antiserum against pure rat liver FDH and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Bio-Rad) (41Leary J.J. Brigati D.J. Ward D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4045-4049Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using the protein assay of Bradford (42Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). Amino-terminal sequence analysis of wild-type and mutant proteins was carried out in the Vanderbilt Medical Center Core facility using automated Edman degradation with gas phase analysis on an LF-3000 (Beckman Instruments) or an Applied Biosystem 470A (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) protein sequencer. All assays were performed at 30 °C in a Shimadzu 2401PC double beam spectrophotometer. For measurement of hydrolase activity, the reaction mixture contained 0.05m Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm 2-ME, and 5 μm substrate 10-formyl-DDF. 10-Formyl-DDF is an alternative, stable substrate for the enzyme (40Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 651-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The reaction was started by the addition of enzyme (1–20 μg) in a final volume of 1.0 ml and read against a blank cuvette containing all components except enzyme. Appearance of product 5,8-dideazafolate (DDF) was measured at 295 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 18.9 × 103 (43Smith G.K. Mueller W.T. Benkovic P.A. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1241-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Addition of NADP+ to the reaction mixture provided a measure of both dehydrogenase and hydrolase activities, i.e. total activity of the enzyme. Hydrolase activity measured in the absence of NADP+ was subtracted from the total activity to give the dehydrogenase activity. Dehydrogenase activity was also measured independently using the increase in absorbance at 340 nm due to production of NADPH and the molar extinction coefficient of 6.2 × 103. Aldehyde dehydrogenase activity was assayed using propanol essentially as described by Lindahl and Evces (44Lindahl R. Evces S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 33: 3383-3389Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar) with our modifications (7Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10266-10272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 50 mm CAPS buffer, pH 9.4, 5 mm propanol, 1 mm NADP+, and enzyme in a total volume of 1 ml. Activity was estimated from the increase in absorbance at 340 nm. Fluorescence experiments were done on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 650-40 or Hitachi F-2500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Emission fluorescence spectra of wild-type and mutant enzymes were recorded by scanning from 300 to 460 nm with fluorescence excitation at either 280 or 295 nm. Protein samples (0.1 mg/ml) were in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. Emission fluorescence spectra of ANS complexed to Nt-FDH were recorded by scanning from 400 to 600 nm with fluorescence excitation at 360 nm. Protein samples (0.1 mg/ml) were preincubated with ANS (3 × 10−5m) in 20 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, for 30 min. All experiments were done at room temperature. Binding of 10-formyl-DDF and DDF to the Nt-FDH mutants was detected by measuring the quenching of protein tryptophan fluorescence as we described previously (8Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10273-10278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 35Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35777-35784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Protein samples (about 10.0 nm) were in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8. The concentrations of ligands were varied from 2 to 2000 nm for 10-formyl-DDF and from 50 nm to 40 μm for DDF. The experiments were done at 25 °C. Fluorescence excitation was at 291 nm, and the emission was monitored at 340 nm. The data were corrected for dilution effect, for 10-formyl-DDF or DDF intrinsic fluorescence, and for absorptive screening caused by DDF. Intrinsic fluorescence of 10-formyl-DDF or DDF was measured experimentally. In case of DDF the observed fluorescence signal was multiplied by the correction factor, C, to obtained the corrected data. The correction factor was calculated according to the equation C = 10ΔA/2, whereΔA is the absorbance of DDF at the excitation wavelength (45Eftink M.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 278: 221-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Kd values for the ligands were calculated from data on fluorescence quenching in the presence of ligands that were plotted in a linear form. The value (1 −F/Fo)−1 was plotted against the inverse of ligand concentration (46Chow S.F. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15516-15521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is a modified form of the classical Stern-Volmer plot that relates the decrease in fluorescence to the concentration of a collisional quencher (47Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1618) Google Scholar). F is intrinsic fluorescence observed at a quencher concentration; Fo is fluorescence in the absence of quencher. The slope of the line (least squares fit) gave aKd value. Variation of the measured values was about 5%. Far-UV CD spectra were obtained on an Jasco 720 spectrometer. The concentration of wild-type and mutant proteins was in the range of 0.3–0.5 mg/ml in 50 mm phosphate, pH 7.0. Spectra were recorded at 25 °C using cylindrical quartz cuvette with path length of 0.1 cm. For each sample, three separate spectra were collected and averaged using a step interval of 1.0 nm. The protein spectra were corrected by subtracting a blank solution containing 50 mm phosphate. The final results are reported as mean residue ellipticity in units of degree·cm2·dmol−1 calculated using a mean residue weight of 115.0.

The role of the small domain in the biogenesis and stability of the cytochromeb6 f complex and electron transfer through the cytochrome b6 f complex was studied with a small domain deletion mutant in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The mutant is able to grow photoautotrophically but with a slower rate than the wild type strain. The heme group is covalently attached to the polypeptide, and the visible absorption spectrum of the mutant protein is identical to that of the native protein. The kinetics of electron transfer in the mutant were measured by flash kinetic spectroscopy. Our results show that the rate for the oxidation of cytochrome f was unchanged (t = 12 = ∼100 μs), but the half-time for the reduction of cytochrome f is increased (t 12 = 32 ms; for wild type,t 12 = 2.1 ms). Cytochromeb6 reduction was slower than that of the wild type by a factor of approximately 2 (t 12 = 8.6 ms; for wild type, t 12 = 4.7 ms); the slow phase of the electrochromic band shift also displayed a slower kinetics (t 12 = 5.5 ms; for wild type,t 12= 2.7 ms). The stability of the cytochromeb6 f complex in the mutant was examined by following the kinetics of the degradation of the individual subunits after inhibiting protein synthesis in the chloroplast. The results indicate that the cytochromeb6 f complex in the small domain deletion mutant is less stable than in the wild type. We conclude that the small domain is not essential for the biogenesis of cytochromef and the cytochromeb6 f complex.

Cytochrome f is one of the four redox centers and the largest subunit (31 kDa) in the cytochromeb6 f complex. It transfers electrons from the Rieske FeS1 protein to plastocyanin. The biogenesis of cytochrome f and the assembly of the cytochrome b6 fcomplex involve a complicated process (1Wollman F.-A. Minai L. Nechushtai R. Biochim. Biophys.

Cytochrome fis required for the assembly of the cytochromeb6 f complex because when thepetA gene encoding cytochrome f in the chloroplast genome was disrupted, there was no assembled cytochromeb6 f complex, and the resulting mutant could not grow photoautotrophically (3Kuras R.

Although these results shed light on the functioning of C-terminal transmembrane span and the large domain of cytochrome f, the role of the small domain remained ambiguous. The small domain of cytochrome f consists of amino acid residues from Asn172 to Leu228 (9Büschlen S. Choquet R. Kuras R. Wollman F.-A.

Mutations of amino acid residues within the small domain did not reveal any significant difference from the wild type protein in vivo (15Soriano G.M. Ponamarev M.V. Tae G.-S. Cramer W.A.

Biomembr. 1999; 31: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) speculated that the small domain of cytochrome f might function like the subunit VIII in the cytochrome bc1 complex to provide structural stability to the complex. Recently, the crystal structure of cytochrome f from C. reinhardtiirevealed that cytochrome f could exist in dimeric form (7Chi Y.-I. Huang L.-S. Zhang Z. Fernández-Velasco J.G. Berry E.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7689-7701Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and amino acid residues from the small domain are found to be involved in the hydrogen bond formation in the interface of this dimer. However, the relationship of this dimer to the structure of cytochromef in vivo is not clear. We were interested in defining the role of the small domain of cytochrome f in the biogenesis and the functioning of cytochrome f and the cytochromeb6 f complex. To address this question, we have made a small domain deletion mutant of cytochromef in C. reinhardtii. The mutant is able to grow photoautotrophically and has an assembled cytochromeb6 f complex. Our studies showed that the electron transfer through the cytochromeb6 f complex can occur in the mutant but at a slower rate. In addition, the mutant cytochromeb6 f complex was not as stable as that in the wild type strain. C. reinhardtiiwild type (cc-125), cytochrome f small domain deletion mutant (pFSSD), and ΔpetA mutant (14Zhou J. Fernández-Velasco J.G. Malkin R. J. Biol.

(1989) The Chlamydomonas Source Book: A Comprehensive Guide to Biology and Laboratory Use, pp. 25–63 and 593–594, Academic Press Inc., San Diego, CA.Google Scholar) under dim light (2 μmol of photons m−2 s−1). For the photoautotrophic growth of strains, the wild type and the pFSSD mutant were grown on HS plates (28Harris, E. (1989) The Chlamydomonas Source Book: A Comprehensive Guide to Biology and Laboratory Use, pp. 25–63 and 593–594, Academic Press Inc., San Diego, CA.Google Scholar) under medium light (35 μmol of photons m−2 s−1). Liquid cultures of the wild type strain and the pFSSD mutant were carried out in HS medium bubbled with 3% CO2 under 35 μmol of photons m−2s−1 light intensity. Bacteria Escherichia coliDH5α strain was used for DNA manipulations. PCR was performed as described previously (20Gong X.-S. Wen J.Q. Gray J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1732-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) to make the construct (Fig. 2). The following are the sequences of the following primers: primer I, 5′-CAACTGGAATCCCCTTATAG-3′ (located 50 bp upstream of petAgene); primer II, 5′-CGCTACGTAAATAGTGTTGTTTGA-3′ (the bold codon encodes Tyr171); primer III, 5′-GCCTACGTA ACAAACAACAACCCTAACGTTGG-3′ (the bold codon encodes Thr229); and primer IV, 5′-GTAGGAGCTGCACAGCAGCC-3′ (located 13 bp downstream from thepetA gene). The underlined sequence is the SnaBI restriction site. The PCR template was the plasmid pJB101ΔH containing the petA gene (14Zhou J. Fernández-Velasco J.G. Malkin R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6225-6232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A 700-bp fragment I was obtained by PCR using primers I and II. A new SnaBI site was introduced at the 3′-end of the fragment. Fragment II with a length of 220 bp was obtained by PCR using primers III and IV. A newSnaBI site was also added to the 5′-end of fragment II. Fragment I was cut with HindIII and cloned into pUC19 plasmid cut with HindIII and HincII to give pUCFI. Fragment II was cloned into pUC19 cut with HincII to give pUCFII. For the pUCFII, we selected the construct with an orientation where the SnaBI site is adjacent to theHindIII site from the pUC19 polylinker region. The correct sequences of the inserts were confirmed by sequencing in an Applied Biosystems DNA sequencer 377. pUCFII was then digested withSnaBI and EcoRI to give a 220-bp fragment, which was ligated with pUCFI cut with the same enzyme to give pUCFSD. pUCFSD was digested with HindIII and AflII. The insertion was cloned into pJB101ΔH plasmid digested with the same restriction enzyme to give pJBFSD. To make the chloroplast transformation construct pFSSD, the petA gene sequence from pADFI283ST (3Kuras R. Wollman F.-A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) was replaced with small domain deletion petAmutant sequence from pJBFSD by digesting both plasmids withBglII and EcoRV. In the pFSSD construct the sequence of petA gene, which encodes a small domain of cytochrome f from Gln172 to Leu228, was deleted (57-amino acid sequence). An extra codon for valine was added in the petA gene sequence of the small domain deletion mutant between the codon for Tyr171 and the codon for Thr229 that resulted from the addition of a newSnaBI site. The ΔpetA strain was transformed as described previously (14Zhou J. Fernández-Velasco J.G. Malkin R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6225-6232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) using the biolistic particle delivery system (PDS-1000/He; Bio-Rad). 250 ml of TAP medium was inoculated with the ΔpetA strain and grown for 3 days under dim light. 600 ml of fresh TAP medium was inoculated to ∼1 × 105cells/ml. Cells grown to ∼2 × 106 cells/ml in the presence of 0.5 mm fluorodeoxyuridine were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended to a concentration of ∼1 × 108 cells/ml. 1 ml of the cell suspension was mixed with an equal volume of (premelted and incubated at 42 °C) 0.2% agar in TAP, and 0.7 of the mixture was spread onto two preprepared TAP plates. 4 μg of pFSSD DNA was precipitated onto 0.3 mg of gold particles, which were used to bombard the cells on the plates. The bombarded cells were transferred to TAP plates containing 150 μg/ml spectinomycin and incubated under dim light at 25 °C. PCR was performed to select the transformants as described previously by Berthold et al.(29Berthold D.A. Best B.A. Malkin R. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1993; 11: 338-344Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). C. reinhardtii DNA was prepared by centrifuging cells from 50 ml of culture.

The solution was extracted three times with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:24:1 v/v/v). The DNA was precipitated with 0.7 volumes of isopropyl alcohol. After digesting the DNA with EcoRV andHindIII, Southern blot hybridization was carried out as described previously (14Zhou J. Fernández-Velasco J.G. Malkin R. J. Biol.

The pellet of C. reinhardtii cells was resuspended with autolysin solution and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Cells were then washed twice with HS liquid medium. A home-built single beam kinetic spectrophotometer with microsecond time resolution was used as described previously (14Zhou J. Fernández-Velasco J.G. Malkin R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6225-6232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Flash-induced spectroscopy was done at 25 °C under anaerobic conditions maintained by argon flux. Cells were suspended in HS medium, pH 6.8 (28Harris, E. (1989) The Chlamydomonas Source Book: A Comprehensive Guide to Biology and Laboratory Use, pp. 25–63 and 593–594, Academic Press Inc., San Diego, CA.Google Scholar), at a chlorophyll concentration of 30 μg/ml. A short 23% P700-saturating flash, having a duration of 3.5 μs at half-peak height, was used to avoid multiple turnovers of the cytochrome b6 fcomplex. Cytochrome f was monitored as ΔA554–545 nm (14Zhou J. Fernández-Velasco J.G. Malkin R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6225-6232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) in the presence of 30 μm FCCP. For the measurement of cytochrome foxidation, 22 μm stigmatellin was also added to inhibit the reduction of cytochrome f. Cytochromeb6 was measured as ΔA564–575 nm (15Soriano G.M. Ponamarev M.V. Tae G.-S. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14590-14598Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) in the presence of 30 μm HQNO and 30 μm FCCP. The slow phase of the electrochromic band shift was measured as the difference of ΔA515 nm (18Ponamarev M.V. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17199-17208Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) in the absence and the presence of 22 μm stigmatellin. The kinetic data were fit as first order reactions to give the rate constants, which were used to calculate the half-times of the reactions. DNA was isolated from the primary transformants, which were able to grow on the TAP plates containing spectinomycin. The colonies giving the correct size of the DNA fragment by PCR were transferred to HS plates and incubated under dim light at 25 °C. Most of the colonies died after 3–4 weeks. Only a few tiny green colonies were found under the microscope. They were restreaked onto the fresh HS plates and TAP plates. After a few weeks it was confirmed that pFSSD mutant was able to grow photoautotrophically. The growth rate measured in HS liquid medium under 35 μmol of photons m−2 s−1 showed that the pFSSD mutant grew slightly more slowly than the wild type (TableI). Under higher light intensity,i.e. 160 μmol of photons m−2s−1, the slower growth in the pFSSD mutant is more noticeable (doubling time, 9.8 h versus 8 h). Southern blot analysis revealed the presence of the correct insertion in these cells (Fig. 3). In comparison with the wild type strain, the smaller band from the pFSSD mutant showed the correct size of deletion (∼0.16 kilobase) from thepetA gene sequence. The chlorophyll contents of the wild type and pFSSD mutant are very similar. The chlorophyll (a +b)/cell is 3.8 ± 0.5 × 10−15 and 3.2 ± 0.3 × 10−15 mol/cell, respectively. The chlorophyll a/chlorophyll b ratio is 2.5 and 2.3, respectively. The presence of the mutant polypeptide was then examined by immunoblotting (Fig. 4). The anti-cytochromef antibodies identified a band of smaller molecular mass (∼25 kDa) in the pFSSD mutant, which is approximately the expected molecular mass for cytochrome f after the deletion of the small domain. The antibodies against cytochromeb6, subunit IV, and Rieske FeS protein also identified bands of the same size as the wild type from the pFSSD mutant, which are in contrast to the petA deletion strain where no detection of any of the subunits of the cytochromeb6 f complex is observed (Fig. 4,lane 2). It is known that the absence of cytochromef results in a rapid degradation of the cytochromeb6 f complex subunits (3Kuras R. Wollman F.-A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Therefore the presence of other subunits in the pFSSD mutant suggests that the cytochrome b6 f complex was assembled. However, the level of these proteins in the mutant cells was only 40–30% of the level in the wild type cells, showing that there was less cytochrome b6 f complex in the mutant. Detection of peroxidase activity using tetramethylbenzidine and H2O2 also indicated the presence of a new 25-kDa heme-containing protein, suggesting that heme had been covalently inserted into the mutant polypeptide of cytochromef. We conclude from these studies that deletion of the small domain does not affect the translocation of the protein to the lumen, the processing of the precursor protein, and the incorporation of the heme group into the polypeptide and that the small domain is not essential for the assembly of the cytochromeb6 f complex.Table IComparison of physiological and kinetic parameters between wild type and the pFSSD mutantDoubling time1-aCells were grown in the HS medium under 35 μmol of photons m−2s−1 and bubbled with 3% CO2.Oxygen evolution1-bNet photosynthesis.

In this study, analysis of 2′,5′-Oligoadenylate (2–5A) binding and activation of the 80- and 37-kDa forms of RNase L has been completed utilizing photolabeling/immunoprecipitation and affinity assays, respectively. Saturation of photolabeling of the 80- and the 37-kDa RNase L with the 2–5A azido photoprobe, [32P]pApAp(8-azidoA), was achieved. Half-maximal photoinsertion of [32P]pApAp(8-azidoA) occurred at 3.7 × 10−8m for the 80-kDa RNase L and at 6.3 × 10−8m for the 37-kDa RNase L. Competition experiments using 100-fold excess unlabeled 2–5A photoaffinity probe, pApAp(8-azidoA), and authentic 2–5A (p3A3) resulted in complete protection against photolabeling, demonstrating that [32P]pApAp(8-azidoA) binds specifically to the 2–5A-binding site of the 80- and 37-kDa RNase L. The rate of RNA hydrolysis by the 37-kDa RNase L was three times faster than the 80-kDa RNase L.

The 2–5A-dependent 80-kDa RNase L is the terminal enzyme in the 2–5A synthetase/RNase L antiviral defense pathway (2Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Scheiber R.D. Annu. Rev.

RNase L is distinguished from other RNases in that it requires 2–5A for allosteric activation (reviewed in Refs. 1Suhadolnik R.J. Peterson D.L. O'Brien K. Cheney P.R. Herst C.V.T. Reichenbach N.L.

The 80-kDa RNase L plays an essential role in the inhibition of viral mRNA and thus the inhibition of viral protein synthesis (3Sen G.C. Lengyel P. J. Biol.

In addition to the 80-kDa form of RNase L, a 40/42-kDa form has been identified and is thought to be a proteolytic degradation product of the 80-kDa RNase L (7Bayard B. Bette-Bobillo P. Aliau S. Eur.

As part of ongoing studies on the up-regulation of the 2–5OAS/RNase L antiviral pathway, a previously unknown 37-kDa form of RNase L has recently been identified in extracts of PBMC from individuals who met the diagnostic criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) (9Shetzline S.

We had previously demonstrated that the 2–5OAS/RNase L pathway is constitutively active in PBMC extracts from individuals with CFS; 2–5OAS is predominantly in its activated form and levels of bioactive 2–5A and RNase L enzyme activity are elevated in CFS PBMC extracts compared with healthy control PBMC extracts (13Suhadolnik R.J.

Continued analyses of CFS PBMC extracts have revealed the presence of a novel low molecular mass RNase L that binds 2–5A, exhibits 2–5A-dependent RNase L activity, and has a molecular mass of 37-kDa under denaturing conditions (1Suhadolnik R.J.

Two subsets of individuals with CFS have been identified in PBMC extracts using azido photoaffinity labeling with [32P]pApAp(8-azidoA) and immunoprecipitation with a polyclonal antibody specific to the human 80-kDa RNase L (1Suhadolnik R.J.

One subset contains only the 37-kDa RNase L and the second subset contains both the 80- and 37-kDa RNase L. The subset of CFS PBMC containing only the 37-kDa RNase L had the higher level of RNase L activity compared with the subset containing both the 80- and 37-kDa forms of RNase L (2Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Scheiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3365) Google Scholar). In a two-site randomized-coded study, the presence of the 37-kDa RNase L also correlated with the level of clinical disability experienced by the study subjects (10Suhadolnik R.J. Peterson D.L. Cheney P.R. Horvath S.E. Reichenbach N.L. O'Brien K. Lombardi V. Welsh S. Furr E.G. Charubala R. Pfleiderer W. J. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. 1999; 5: 223-242Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The elucidation of the molecular structure of the 37-kDa RNase L has been a major effort in this laboratory (1Suhadolnik R.J. Peterson D.L. O'Brien K. Cheney P.R. Herst C.V.T. Reichenbach N.L. Kon N.

We hypothesized that the observed differences in the levels of biologically active 2–5A and RNase L activity in healthy control and CFS PBMC extracts could be attributed to differences in the 2–5A binding affinity or enzyme activity of the 80- and 37-kDa forms of RNase L. In the current study, we have characterized the 2–5A binding and activation of the 80- and 37-kDa RNase L in healthy control and CFS PBMC extracts utilizing azido photochemical cross-linking and affinity binding assays. Saturation of 2–5A azido photolabeling was achieved for the 80- and 37-kDa forms of RNase L. Competition experiments revealed that the 2–5A azido photoaffinity probe, [32P]pApAp(8-azidoA), binds specifically to the 80- and 37-kDa RNase L in healthy control and CFS PBMC extracts, respectively. The rate of RNA hydrolysis by the 37-kDa RNase L was three time faster than the 80-kDa RNase L. The data presented in this study also demonstrate the use of the 2–5A azido photoprobe for the detection of the 37-kDa RNase L in CFS PBMC extracts. The 2–5A azido photoaffinity probe, ApAp(8-azidoA), and 2–5A4 were generously supplied by Dr. Wolfgang Pfleiderer (Konstanz Universität, Konstanz, Germany). The fibrous cellulose powder CF11 used to prepare the core(2–5A)-cellulose was from Whatman. Healthy control and CFS PBMC extracts were used as source of the 80- and 37-kDa RNase L, respectively. PBMC extracts were prepared in the presence of protease inhibitors as described previously (1Suhadolnik R.J. Peterson D.L. O'Brien K. Cheney P.R. Herst C.V.T. Reichenbach N.L. Kon N. Horvath S.E.

The chemical synthesis of ApAp(8-azidoA) was completed as described (16Charubala R. Pfleiderer W. Sobol R.W. Li S.W. Suhadolnik R.J. Helv. Chim.

Phosphorylation of the 5′ terminus of ApAp(8-azidoA) (0.15 mm) was performed with [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) in the absence and presence of ATP (1.6 mm) and T4 polynucleotide kinase according to the manufacturer's directions. The yield of the radiolabel incorporation for [32P]pApAp (8-azidoA) in the absence of ATP was 30% with a specific activity of 6000 Ci/mmol and 5–10% in the presence of ATP with a specific activity of 60 Ci/mmol. Covalent photoaffinity labeling, immunoprecipitation, and quantitation of the 2–5A binding immunoreactive proteins from healthy control and CFS PBMC extracts were as described previously (1Suhadolnik R.J.

A concentration range of 0 to 700 nm[32P]pApAp(8-azidoA) (6 × 104 Ci/mol) was used to photolabel and immunoprecipitate 2–5A binding, immunoreactive proteins in PBMC extracts from healthy controls and CFS patients (50 μg of total protein) was described previously (1Suhadolnik R.J.

Covalent cross-linking of the 2–5A photoaffinity probe [32P]pApAp(8-azidoA) to the 80- and 37-kDa forms of RNase L was quantitated using a Fuji BAS 2000 PhosphorImager and converted to concentration of bound [32P]pApAp(8-azidoA) (nm) following photolabeling/immunoprecipitation experiments. The amount of bound [32P]pApAp(8-azidoA) was plotted as a function of the concentration of [32P]pApAp(8-azidoA) (nm) used per assay and fit to a nonlinear regression for one-site and two-site models using Sigma plot version 5.0 (17Chavan A.J.

The specificity of [32P]pApAp(8-azidoA) binding to RNase L in PBMC extracts was determined by two types of competition experiments using unlabeled pApAp(8-azidoA) and p3A3. In the first type of competition experiment, PBMC extracts (50 μg of total protein) were combined with a mixture of radiolabeled [32P]pApAp(8-azidoA) (1 × 10−8m; 6 × 106 Ci/mol; 10,000 dpm) and varying concentrations of unlabeled pApAp(8-azidoA) (0 to 5 × 10−6m) and incubated for 30 min at 0 °C. In the second type of competition experiment, PBMC extracts (50 μg of total protein) were combined with a mixture of [32P]pApAp(8-azidoA) (1 × 10−8m; 6 × 106 Ci/mol; 60,000 dpm) and p3A3 (1 × 10−11 to 1 × 10−7m) and incubated for 30 min at 0 °C. The photolabeling mixtures were photolyzed, immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody to human 80-kDa RNase L, fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and analyzed as described from this laboratory (1Suhadolnik R.J.

The percent bound [32P]pApAp(8-azidoA) was plotted as a function of the concentration of unlabeled pApAp(8-azidoA) or p3A3 using Sigma plot 5.0. Core(2–5A)-cellulose assays were used to determine the activation of RNase L in PBMC extracts from healthy controls and CFS patients as described (20Silverman R.H. Anal.

Briefly, in time-dependent activation assays, PBMC extracts (150 μg of total protein) were incubated with core(2–5A)-cellulose (0 °C, 1 h) to immobilize 80- and 37-kDa RNase L. The immobilized RNase L was combined with radiolabeled substrate, poly(U)-3′-[32P]pCp (1.1 × 10−5m; 10,000 dpm), and 2–5A activator, pA4 (1 × 10−7m), and incubated at 30 °C for 0 to 120 min (30 μl total reaction volume). The poly(U)-3′-[32P]pCp was precipitated and quantitated by scintillation spectrometry as described (1Suhadolnik R.J. Peterson D.L. O'Brien K. Cheney P.R. Herst C.V.T. Reichenbach N.L. Kon N. Horvath S.E. Iacono K.T. Adelson M.E. De Meirleir K. De Becker P. Charubala R. Pfleiderer W. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1997; 17: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Non-2–5A-dependent RNase activity in PBMC extracts was determined in the presence of poly(C)-3′-[32P]pCp, which is not a substrate for RNase L (1Suhadolnik R.J. Peterson D.L. O'Brien K. Cheney P.R. Herst C.V.T. Reichenbach N.L. Kon N. Horvath S.E. Iacono K.T. Adelson M.E. De Meirleir K. De Becker P. Charubala R. Pfleiderer W. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1997; 17: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The data were plotted as the percent RNA remaining as a function of the time of incubation at 30 °C using Sigma plot 5.0. Half-maximal (50%) hydrolysis of poly(U)-3′-[32P]pCp was determined as the midpoint between 100% RNA remaining and the amount of RNA remaining once maximal RNase L activity was attained. In the current study, we utilized the methods of covalent photoaffinity labeling with the 2–5A azido photoprobe, [32P]pApAp(8-azidoA), and immunoprecipitation with a polyclonal antibody to human RNase L to determine the binding requirements for the interaction of 2–5A with 80- and 37-kDa RNase L in healthy control and CFS PBMC extracts, respectively. By using cell extracts prepared from PBMC, we have chosen to employ a system that contains all the components necessary to form the activated complexes for the 80- and 37-kDa RNase L proteins (22Potter R.L. Haley B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 613-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In previous photolabeling studies, we have used 2–5A azido photoprobes to specifically identify the different forms of RNase L in interferon-treated L929 cell extracts (21Suhadolnik R.J. Kariko K. Sobol R.W. Li S.W. Reichenbach N.L. Haley B.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8840-8846Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated that the activation of the 80-kDa RNase L in interferon-treated L929 cells extracts by an 8-azido-2–5A photoaffinity probe was comparable to the RNase L activity measured in the presence of p3A3 using core (2–5A)-cellulose assays (16Charubala R.

Core (2–5A)-cellulose assays were employed in the current study to determine 2–5A-dependent RNase activity in healthy control and CFS PBMC extracts. We have demonstrated that the expression of the 37-kDa RNase L in CFS PBMC extracts correlates with elevated levels of bioactive 2–5A and RNase L activity (1Suhadolnik R.J. Peterson D.L. O'Brien K. Cheney P.R. Herst C.V.T. Reichenbach N.L. Kon N. Horvath S.E. Iacono K.T. Adelson M.E. De Meirleir K. De Becker P. Charubala R. Pfleiderer W. J.

Using the combined methods of covalent photoaffinity labeling with the 2–5A photoaffinity probe, [32P]pApAp(8-azidoA), and immunoprecipitation with a polyclonal antibody to human 80-kDa RNase L, the binding affinity of 2–5A to 80-kDa RNase L in healthy control PBMC extracts and to 37-kDa RNase L in CFS PBMC extracts was determined (Fig.1). The healthy control PBMC extracts chosen for the study contained only the 80-kDa RNase L and the CFS PBMC extracts contained only the 37-kDa RNase L. Binding of [32P]pApAp(8-azidoA) to either 80- or 37-kDa RNase L in PBMC extracts reached equilibrium in 30 min at 0 °C and remained constant through 90 min prior to photolabeling/immunoprecipitation (data not shown). The extent of photolabeling at 0 °C of the 80- and 37-kDa RNase L by [32P]pApAp(8-azidoA) reached a maximum at 60 s and remained constant through 90 s (data not shown). Therefore, photolysis was conducted for 60 s to maximize the extent of [32P]pApAp(8-azidoA) photoinsertion into the 80- and 37-kDa RNase L. In the absence of UV irradiation, there was no covalent cross-linking of the [32P]pApAp(8-azidoA) to RNase L. The amount of [32P]pApAp(8-azidoA) covalently bound to the 80- or 37-kDa RNase L was linear with respect to the amount of used PBMC extract or CFS PBMC extract up to 100 μg of total protein (data not shown). The best curve fit for the binding of the 2–5A azido photoprobe to the 80- and 37-kDa forms of RNase L following non-linear regression analysis was for a one-site model, which indicates that the molar ratio of 2–5A to RNase L is 1:1 (Fig. 1). Saturation of photolabeling by [32P]pApAp(8-azidoA) was approached at 3.0 × 10−7m for the 80- and 37-kDa RNase L (Fig. 1,B and D). Based on earlier photolabeling studies (23Dolan J.W. Marshall N.F. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5747-5754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we performed similar experiments assuming that the efficiency of 2–5A azido photolabeling of the 80- and 37-kDa is constant at all concentrations of [32P]pApAp(8-azidoA). These photolabeling data have been used to determine apparent dissociation constants, which are represented by the concentration at which 50% of the maximal photoinsertion is attained. The apparent meanKd for the 80-kDa RNase L in three healthy control PBMC extracts was determined to be 3.7 ± 2.8 × 10−8m. Half-maximal 2–5A azido photolabeling for the 80-kDa RNase L from the representative healthy control PBMC extract shown in Fig. 1 B is 6.9 × 10−8m. The apparent mean Kd for the 37-kDa RNase L in three CFS PBMC extracts was determined to be 6.3 ± 5.5 × 10−8m. Half-maximal 2–5A azido photolabeling for the 37-kDa RNase L from the representative CFS PBMC extract shown in Fig. 1 D is 1.7 × 10−7m. Saturation of photolabeling studies revealed relatively similar mean apparent Kd for the covalent binding of the [32P]pApAp(8-azidoA) to the 80- and 37-kDa RNase L. To determine the specificity of [32P]pApAp(8-azidoA) for the 2–5A-binding site on the 80- and 37-kDa RNase L, two types of competition experiments were completed using unlabeled pApAp(8-azidoA) or p3A3. In the first type, a concentration-dependent protection against photoaffinity labeling of the 80- and 37-kDa forms of RNase L was observed when healthy control and CFS PBMC extracts were incubated with a mixture of radiolabeled [32P]pApAp(8-azidoA) and unlabeled pApAp(8-azidoA), respectively (Fig. 2). The binding of the 2–5A photoaffinity probe to the 80-kDa RNase L was inhibited by 50% with 1.7 × 10−8munlabeled pApAp(8-azidoA) (Fig. 2, A and B, andB, inset), which is in good agreement with the apparent mean Kd determined from the saturation of photolabeling studies. Fifty percent protection against photoinsertion of [32P] pApAp(8-azidoA) into the 2–5A-binding site of the 37-kDa RNase L was achieved with 3.9 × 10−9m unlabeled pApAp(8-azidoA) (Fig. 2, C andD, and D, inset), which is consistent with the apparent mean Kd determined from the saturation of photolabeling experiments (Fig. 1). An apparent increase in covalent photoincorporation of [32P]pApAp(8-azidoA) into the 2–5A-binding site of the 80-kDa RNase L was observed when photolabeling mixtures contained unlabeled photoprobe at concentrations less than 1.0 × 10−8m (Fig. 2 B, inset). Such an apparent increase in photoincorporation can be observed only in the presence of unlabeled photoprobe at concentrations below the apparent Kd for ligand binding to a protein (24Trad C.H. Chavan A.J. Clemens J. Haley B.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 304: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 25Levitzki A. Koshland Jr., D.E. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, a cooperative allosteric effect may occur, as has been demonstrated in isotope competition experiments with the photoprobe [α-32P]2-azido-NAD+ and ovine prolactin (24Trad C.H. Chavan A.J. Clemens J. Haley B.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 304: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 25Levitzki A. Koshland Jr., D.E. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This precedent might account for the difference in requirements for formation of the activated complex for 80- and 37-kDa RNase L. Simultaneous incubation of 1.0 × 10−8m [32P]pApAp(8-azidoA) with unlabeled pApAp(8-azidoA) at concentrations less than 1.0 × 10−8m did not result in an increase in covalent photolabeling of [32P]pApAp(8-azidoA) to the 37-kDa RNase L (Fig. 2 D, inset). Incubation of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled pApAp(8-azidoA) (1.0 × 10−6m) with the 80-kDa RNase L resulted in complete inhibition of photolabeling (Fig. 2, B and B, inset). In contrast, complete inhibition of photolabeling of the 37-kDa RNase L was achieved by incubation with a 10-fold excess of unlabeled pApAp(8-azidoA) (1.0 × 10−7m) (Fig. 2, D and D, inset). Therefore, protection of photoinsertion by [32P]pApAp(8-azidoA) into the 80- and 37-kDa RNase L could be achieved with 100-fold excess unlabeled pApAp- (8-azidoA). Based on the data presented in Figs. 1 and 2, a second type of competition experiment was performed to measure the specific photolabeling of the 2–5A allosteric binding site of the 80- and 37-kDa forms of RNase L by [32P]pApAp(8-azidoA). Using authentic p3A3 at concentrations ranging from 1 × 10−11 to 1 × 10−6m in the presence of 1 × 10−8m[32P]pApAp(8-azidoA), a concentration-dependent protection of 2–5A azido photolabeling was observed (Fig. 3). Photoinsertion of [32P]pApAp(8-azidoA) into the 2–5A-binding site of the 80-kDa RNase L was inhibited 50% by p3A3 at a concentration of 7.6 × 10−10m (Fig. 3, A andC, ○), which is in agreement with 4 × 10−10m p3A4 required to inhibit 50% of the chemical cross-linking of 2–5A in L929 cell extracts (26Nolan-Sorden N.L. Lesiak K. Bayard B. Torrence P.F. Silverman R.H. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 184: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Photolabeling of 37-kDa RNase L by [32P]pApAp(8-azidoA) was inhibited by 50% at a concentration of 1.2 × 10−10mp3A3 (Fig. 3, B and C, ●). Incubation of [32P]pApAp(8-azidoA) and p3A3 at equal concentrations (1 × 10−8m) with 80- and 37-kDa RNase L resulted in complete protection against covalent photolabeling (Fig.3 C). These data indicate that [32P]pApAp(8-azidoA) binds specifically to the 2–5A allosteric binding site of the 80- and 37-kDa RNase L. In contrast to the photoaffinity labeling/immunoprecipitation method used to determine 2–5A binding activity, the core(2–5A)-cellulose method is an affinity binding assay used to measure 2–5A-mediated hydrolysis of single-stranded RNA in the absence of non-2–5A-dependent RNases and other factors which may cause modifications, synthesis, or degradation of 2–5A (20Silverman R.H. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 144: 450-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We previously reported that RNase L activity as measured by the ribosomal RNA cleavage assay was elevated up to 45-fold in PBMC extracts from individuals with CFS compared with healthy controls (13Suhadolnik R.J. Reichenbach N.L. Hitzges P. Sobol R.W. Peterson D.L. Henry B. Ablashi D.V. Müller W.E.G. Schröder H.C. Carter W.A. Strayer D.R. Clin. Infect.

Müller W.E.G. Schröder H.C. Strayer D.R. Carter W.A. In Vivo. 1994; 8: 599-604PubMed Google Scholar). In view of the elevated RNase L activity observed in CFS PBMC extracts, we hypothesized that, in the presence of 2–5A and poly(U)-3′-[32P]pCp, the 37-kDa RNase L would be more active than the 80-kDa RNase L. Time-dependent cleavage of poly(U)-3′-[32P]pCp by the 80- and 37-kDa forms of RNase L was observed (Fig. 4). Poly(C)-3′-[32P]pCp was also used to measure nonspecific RNase activity; the results revealed that the observed 2–5A-dependent RNase L activity was not due to the activity from nonspecific RNases (data not shown). Maximum hydrolysis of poly(U)-3′-[32P]pCp by the 80-kDa RNase L was attained at 60 min with half-maximal hydrolysis observed at 24 min (Fig.4 A). In PBMC extracts from healthy controls, we observed a maximum of 65% hydrolysis of poly(U)-3′-[32P]pCp at 120 min (Fig. 4 A), which is in reasonable agreement with the 80% hydrolysis observed in L929 cell extracts (20Silverman R.H. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 144: 450-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Only 2% hydrolysis of poly(U)-3′-[32P]pCp by the 80-kDa RNase L was observed at 10 min. The delay in the activation observed with the 80-kDa RNase L in healthy control PBMC extracts could be attributed to the time required for 80-kDa RNase L to dissociate from the core(2–5A)-cellulose and form its activated homodimer complex following the addition of poly(U)-3′-[32P]pCp and 2–5A. A similar lag time for the activation of 80-kDa RNase L immobilized on core(2–5A)-cellulose was previously observed for the 80-kDa RNase L in mouse L929 cell extracts (20Silverman R.H. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 144: 450-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 21Suhadolnik R.J. Kariko K. Sobol R.W. Li S.W. Reichenbach N.L. Haley B.E.

Biochem. 1990; 184: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In contrast, maximum hydrolysis of poly(U)-3′-[32P]pCp by the 37-kDa RNase L was attained by 30 min with half-maximal hydrolysis at 8 min (Fig. 4 B). Unlike the 80-kDa RNase L, the 37-kDa RNase L did not exhibit a lag time for activation. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the 37-kDa RNase L hydrolyzes poly(U) at a rate three times faster than the 80-kDa RNase L. This increase in the hydrolysis of poly(U)-3′-[32P]pCp by the 37-kDa RNase L compares with a 10-fold increase in RNase L activity in CFS PBMC extracts as measured by ribosomal cleavage assays (13Suhadolnik R.J. Reichenbach N.L. Hitzges P. Sobol R.W. Peterson D.L. Henry B. Ablashi D.V. Müller W.E.G. Schröder H.C. Carter W.A. Strayer D.R. Clin. Infect.

The aim of this study was to validate the specific interactions involved in the allosteric binding of 2–5A and activation of the 80- and 37-kDa forms of RNase L in PBMC extracts from healthy controls and individuals diagnosed with CFS, respectively. Further characterization of the molecular structure of the 37-kDa RNase L is underway in this laboratory (1Suhadolnik R.J. Peterson D.L. O'Brien K. Cheney P.R. Herst C.V.T. Reichenbach N.L. Kon N.

The results in this study demonstrate that [32P]pApAp(8-azidoA) specifically binds to the 2–5A allosteric binding site of the 80- and 37-kDa RNase L with relatively the same affinity. However, time-dependent hydrolysis of poly(U)-3′-[32P]pCp was three times faster with the 37-kDa RNase L than with the 80-kDa RNase L, which suggests that the elevated RNase L activity observed in CFS PBMC extracts may be attributed to the increased affinity of the RNA substrate and to the increased efficiency of RNA cleavage the 37-kDa form of RNase L. Current efforts are aimed at extending these results to the identification of the amino acid sequence that comprises the 2–5A-binding site of the 37-kDa RNase L. Azido photoaffinity probes have been used to specifically identify ligand binding and active sites of enzymes (18Shoemaker M.T. Haley B.E.

Further examination of the parameters required for the formation of the activated complex for 37-kDa RNase L observed in CFS PBMC extracts is underway in this laboratory.

A subset of proteins (e.g. 8 inSaccharomyces cerevisiae and 13 in humans) are encoded by the mitochondrial genome and are, except for mitochondrial ribosomal protein Var1, assembled co- or post-translationally into the inner membrane. These membrane proteins are inserted into the inner membrane in a manner that requires complete translocation of hydrophilic negatively charged segments across the lipid bilayer to the intermembrane space. In S. cerevisiae mitochondria, translation initiation of several proteins depends on mRNA-specific activators that mediate the functional interaction between the mRNA 5′-untranslated leaders and the mitochondrial ribosomes (5Sanchirico M.E. Fox T.D. Mason T.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5796-5804Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 6Michaelis U. Korte A. Rodel G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 230: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Because the activator proteins are bound to the inner membrane, translation occurs on membrane-tethered ribosomes. In this way, they might promote co-translational membrane insertion, although this remains to be verified. Mitochondria are believed to be derived from a bacterial ancestor, and the mitochondrial protein export system resembles that of bacteria, topologically and evolutionally. The Sec-dependent export machinery that is conserved in Escherichia coli and plant thylakoid, however, is not encoded in the yeast genome. These observations suggest that there is a Sec-independent export pathway in mitochondria. Recent studies indicate that Oxa1p, a nuclear-encoded protein that is conserved from prokaryotes to eukaryotes (7Bonnefoy N. Chalvet F. Hamel P. Slonimski P.P. Dujardin G. J. Mol.

Subsequently, Oxa1p was demonstrated to be involved in topogenesis of CoxII; it mediates export of the N- and C-terminal tails of CoxII to the intermembrane space (11He S. Fox T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1449-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 12Hell K. Herrmann J. Pratje E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). A recent report demonstrated that it also mediates the insertion of CoxI and CoxIII into the inner membrane (13Hell K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1281-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The accumulated evidence indicates that the Oxa1p system mediates export of the negatively charged tails or loops connecting the transmembrane domains (TMDs) across the membrane to the intermembrane space in a membrane potential-dependent manner. Also, Oxa1p might be involved in the membrane assembly of F1F0-ATPase because F1F0-ATPase activity is significantly decreased in Δoxa1 yeast cells (14Altamura N. Capitanio N. Bonnefoy N. Papa S. Dujardin G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Later experiments, however, demonstrated that this was caused by rapid degradation of F1F0-ATPase subunits by the AAA-protease Yme1p in Δoxa1. Furthermore, F1F0-ATPase activity and insertion of its membrane subunits were restored in Δoxa1Δyme1 cells, suggesting that Oxa1p is not essential for the export of the F1F0-ATPase membrane subunits (15Lemaire C. Hamel P. Velours J. Dujardin G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23471-23475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In bacteria, most integral membrane proteins are inserted into the inner membrane using the SRP homologue Ffh, the SRP receptor FtsY, and the SecYEG trimeric complex (16Dalbey R.E. Robinson C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 17-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 17Dalbey R.E. Kuhn A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 51-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The other membrane proteins such as the M13 procoat protein and the Pseudomonas Pf3 coat protein are inserted across the membrane in the Sec-independent pathway; the proteins are thought to insert directly into the lipid bilayer by a mechanism driven by hydrophobic forces or, in several cases, membrane potential. The M13 procoat protein is synthesized with a cleavable signal peptide and spans the membrane once with the processed N terminus exposed to the periplasm and the C terminus remaining in the cytoplasm (18Kuhn A. Kreil G. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3681-3685Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 19Kuhn A. Science. 1987; 238: 1413-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 20Date T. Goodman J.M.

The Pf3 coat protein is synthesized without a cleavable signal sequence and inserts into the membrane once, exposing the N-terminal segment to the periplasm and the C-terminal segment to the cytoplasm (25Kiefer D. Hu X. Dalbey R. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2197-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 26Kiefer D. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6299-6306Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In contrast to the predicted direct insertion mechanism, Samuelson et al. (27Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) demonstrated that insertion of the M13 procoat protein across the membrane depends on a Oxa1p homologue, YidC. Therefore, both YidC-mediated and protein machinery-independent mechanisms seem to function in the insertion of Sec-independent proteins across the membrane. The mechanisms of protein insertion across the mitochondrial inner membrane from the matrix remain largely unknown because of the lack of a suitable in vitro assay system that can substitute for thein organello system so far utilized. In the present study, we developed an in vitro insertion assay using inverted mitochondrial inner membrane vesicles (INVs) and rat F1F0-ATPase subunit 8 (Su8) synthesized in anE. coli system as the substrate. Su8 is a 67-residue membrane subunit of oligomycin-sensitive ATPase and is inserted into the inner membrane once with a short N-terminal region translocated to the intermembrane space, whereas the C-terminal tail remains on the matrix side (28Hekman C. Tomich J.M. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13564-13571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Oda T. Futaki S. Kitagawa K. Yoshihara Y. Tani I. Higuti T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Using this system, Su8 can be inserted post-translationally across INVs with the correcttrans-cis topology depending on the matrix fraction but independently of ATP, membrane potential, or protein components exposed to the matrix space. The insertion was driven by hydrophobic forces because it is dependent on the hydrophobicity of the TMD. Furthermore, Su8 was inserted post-translationally into liposomes in the correct topology in the matrix fraction-dependent manner. These results suggest that the Sec- and Oxa1p-independent insertion pathways, which are conserved in E. coli and chloroplast thylakoids, also exist in mitochondria, although the involvement of proteinaceous machinery remains to be clarified. Rat mitochondrial DNA was prepared from isolated mitochondria as described previously (30Welter C. Dooley S. Blin N. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 83: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Rat Su8 was cloned using the polymerase chain reaction with mitochondrial DNA as a template and the following oligonucleotides as the primers: upstream primer, TTGGATCCATGCCACAACTAGACACATCCACATGA; and downstream primer, ATACTCGAGTTATTGTGGGGGTAATGAAAGAGGCAA. The amplified fragment was cloned directly into pGEM-T Easy (Promega). After DNA sequencing, the mitochondrial codons were mutated to corresponding universal codons using polymerase chain reaction-dependent mutagenesis. The DNA encoding Su8 by universal codons was excised withBamHI and XhoI and cloned into pET-28a(+) (Novagen) to fuse the T7 tag sequence to the N terminus. The segment coding for T7-tagged Su8 (T7-Su8) was excised with NdeI andBpu1102I and ligated to pET-3a (Novagen). TM1 and TM2 mutants were generated by the method of Kunkel (31Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar). Rat mitochondrial inner membrane vesicles were prepared as described by Jascur (32Jascur T. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. Rat liver mitochondria, prepared as described previously (33Hachiya N. Alam R. Sakasegawa Y. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Omura T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1579-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), were diluted to a concentration of 1 mg/ml with 20 mm HEPES-KOH buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), placed on ice for 30 min, and sonicated with a Branson sonicator equipped with a microtip for 15 s at 15-s intervals for a total 6 min at 0 °C. The unbroken mitochondria were removed by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the membrane vesicles were precipitated from the supernatant by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C. The membrane vesicles were suspended in a small volume of 10 mm HEPES-KOH buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10 mm KCl and layered in centrifuge tubes on a linear gradient of 0.85–1.6 m sucrose in 10 mm HEPES-KOH buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10 mmKCl and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 16 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the solution was collected from the top of the tubes into four fractions, and each fraction was diluted with nine volumes of buffer A (33Hachiya N. Alam R. Sakasegawa Y. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Omura T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1579-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) containing 10 mm KCl and 10 mm MgCl2 and centrifuged separately at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The recovered membrane vesicles were suspended in the same buffer, and each aliquot was subjected to Western blotting with antibodies against rat Tom40 and rat Tim17 to determine which fractions contained the mitochondrial outer and inner membranes, respectively. The lower two fractions contained the inner membrane vesicles. The orientation of the inner membrane vesicles was determined as follows. Inner membrane vesicles or mitoplasts (50 μg) were treated with or without 100 μg/ml trypsin on ice for 30 min. After the addition of 500 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, the reaction mixtures were centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 15 min to recover the membranes, which were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed by immunoblotting with antibodies against the N-terminal intermembrane space segment of rat Tim23 and full-length rat Tim44 (34Ishihara N. Mihara K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1998; 123: 722-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To determine the membrane topology of endogenous Su8, 50 μg of INVs or mitoplasts were treated with various concentrations of proteinase K at 0 °C for 30 min. After addition of 5 mm PMSF, membrane vesicles were pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 15 min and analyzed using Western blotting with antibodies against a synthetic peptide for the matrix-exposed C-terminal segment (12 residues) of rat Su8. The mitochondrial matrix fraction was prepared according to the method used for the preparation of the chloroplast S-30 fraction (35Hirose T. Sugiura M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) except that the extraction buffer was adjusted to pH 7.4. T7-Su8 was synthesized in the transcription-translation coupled E. coli S30 system according to the method of Yamaneet al. (36Yamane K. Ichihara S. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2358-2362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with a slight modification, 2Y. Akiyama and K. Ito, personal communication. except that 7.14 units/μl T7 RNA polymerase (Takara), 11.7 KBq/μl Expre35S35S protein-labeling mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 0.5 μg of plasmid DNA were used. The reaction was conducted at 37 °C for 45 min, and then 2 mm puromycin was added to the mixture, and the mixture was incubated for 10 min to terminate the reaction. The insertion reaction of T7-Su8 across the INVs was performed as follows. The translation mixture (7.5 μl) was added to the insertion reaction mixture containing 20 mmHEPES-KOH buffer (pH 7.4), 60 mm potassium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm ATP, 0.02 mm GTP, 6 mm creatine phosphate, 25 units/ml creatine kinase, 1 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol, and mitochondrial matrix fraction (usually 5 mg/ml) in 35 μl. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 1.5 μl of INVs (50 μg of protein) and incubated at 37 °C for 50 min. The reaction mixtures were then treated with 350 μg/ml proteinase K at 0 °C for 30 min. After terminating the reaction with 5 mm PMSF, the reaction mixtures were diluted to 150 μl with buffer D (20 mmHEPES-KOH buffer (pH 7. 4) containing 150 mm potassium acetate), layered over 150 μl of buffer D containing 0.75m sucrose in the centrifuge tubes, and centrifuged in a Hitachi RP 45A rotor at 100,000 × g for 8 min. The precipitated membranes were subjected to Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE (37Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10408) Google Scholar), and the gels were analyzed using a Bioimage Analyzer FLA 2000 (Fuji). Sodium carbonate extraction of the T7-Su8-inserted INVs was performed as follows. After proteinase K digestion and membrane pelleting as described above, the membrane vesicles were dissolved in 100 μl of 0.1 m sodium carbonate (pH 11. 5) and incubated on ice for 20 min. The mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 15 min to separate the membrane and supernatant fractions. The membrane fraction was resuspended in 0.1 m sodium carbonate (pH 11.5). The membrane and supernatant fractions were then precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and analyzed using SDS-PAGE and subsequent fluorography. Immunoprecipitation was performed as follows. After the insertion reaction, the T7-Su8-inserted INVs or liposomes were dissolved in 50 μl of SDS-lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1% SDS and 2 mm1,4-dithiothreitol) and incubated at 85 °C for 5 min. The mixture was then diluted to 500 μl with IP buffer (20 mmHEPES-KOH buffer (pH 7. 4) containing 200 mm KCl and 0.5% Triton X-100). After removal of the insoluble materials by centrifugation, the mixture was pretreated with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h, and the supernatant was incubated overnight with antibodies against the T7 tag or the C-terminal peptide of Su8 and protein G-Sepharose. Protein G-Sepharose was collected by centrifugation, washed three times with 0.5 ml each of IP buffer, and extracted with the loading buffer for Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE. Liposomes were prepared by the method of Vergeres et al. (38Vergeres G. Manenti S. Weber T. Sturzinger C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19879-19887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. A mixture of cardiolipin and phosphatidylcholine (1:4, w/w) in organic solvents was evaporated by flushing N2 and suspended with vortexing in buffer F (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4) containing 100 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA) containing 170 mm sucrose. The mixture was subjected to freezing-thawing five times, diluted with five volumes of buffer F, and spun in an Ultracentrifuge at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 22 °C to obtain liposomes, which were suspended in buffer F. Phospholipid concentrations were determined by measuring lipid phosphate by the method of Eibl and Lands (39Eibl H. Lands W.E. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 30: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). For the membrane insertion assay, liposomes containing the same amounts of lipid phosphate as that of INVs were used. In vitro translation products, mitochondria matrix fractions, and INVs were treated separately with 15 mm deoxyglucose and 50 units/ml hexokinase at 37 °C for 10 min prior to the insertion reaction. To study the mechanisms of insertion of mitochondrial DNA-encoded proteins across the inner membrane, we developed an in vitro assay system. The mitochondrial DNA-encoded subunit 8 of F1F0-ATPase (Su8) was used as the substrate. Su8 is a 67-residue, single-spanning membrane protein of F1F0-ATPase subunits with an N-terminal 8-residue segment that is exposed to the intermembrane space and a C-terminal tail of 41 residues exposed to the matrix space (28Hekman C. Tomich J.M. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13564-13571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,29Oda T. Futaki S. Kitagawa K. Yoshihara Y. Tani I. Higuti T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The template DNA encoding T7-Su8 by universal codons was subjected to transcription-translation with E. coli S30 extract in the presence of [35S]methionine, and the synthesized35S-T7-Su8 was subjected to the insertion reaction with INVs and the mitochondrial matrix fraction. The reaction mixtures were then treated with proteinase K, and the protected fragments in the INVs were analyzed using a Fluoroimager to assess insertion (Fig. 1 A). The orientation of the INVs was first examined using proteolysis followed by immunoblot analysis with antibodies against Tim44 and the intermembrane space segment of Tim23. Rat Tim44 localizes to the inner membrane exposing the bulk portion to the matrix side, whereas Tim23 is a polytopic integral inner membrane protein with the N-terminal segment exposed to the intermembrane space (34Ishihara N. Mihara K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1998; 123: 722-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). As expected, Tim44 in the mitoplasts was resistant to externally added trypsin, whereas the intermembrane segment of Tim23 was completely removed (Fig. 1 B). In the INVs, in contrast, ∼75% of Tim44 was sensitive, and ∼90% of Tim23 was resistant to the trypsin treatment. These results indicate that ∼75% or more (see Fig. 1 C, for example) of INVs had an inside-out orientation. The topology of endogenous Su8 in the isolated INVs was then determined using protease susceptibility assays. The mitoplasts or INVs were treated with proteinase K, and the remaining Su8 was analyzed using SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with antibodies against a synthetic peptide for the C terminus of Su8. As shown in Fig. 1 C, Su8 in the mitoplasts was resistant to proteinase K digestion, whereas it was completely digested in the INVs, thus confirming the reported topography of the C terminus. Determination of the N terminus of Su8 exposed to the intermembrane space was unsuccessful, however, because the reactivity of the antibodies prepared against a synthetic peptide for the N-terminal segment was too weak to detect Su8 fragments. Exposure of the N terminus of Su8 to the intermembrane space was later verified with T7-Su8 in the in vitro assay (see below). To assess the insertion of Su8 across INVs, we constructed a T7-Su8 fusion protein in which the T7 tag was fused to the N terminus of Su8 (Fig.2 A). If in vitrosynthesized T7-Su8 was inserted correctly across the INVs, the T7 tag should be protected from protease digestion. This was indeed the case. Proteinase K treatment of the INVs incubated with T7-Su8 in the presence of the matrix fraction produced the three protected bands A, B, and C (Fig. 2 B), which were resistant to extraction with 100 mm sodium carbonate (pH 11.5). Furthermore, all three bands were digested by proteinase K in the presence of Triton X-100. These results indicate that bands A, B, and C were firmly integrated into the INVs and protected by the membrane. The same three bands were detected when in vitro synthesized T7-Su8 was incubated co-translationally with the INVs, although they significantly inhibited the transcription-translation reaction (data not shown). The topology of these bands in the INVs was then assessed using immunoprecipitation with antibodies against T7 and the C-terminal segment of Su8, which revealed that bands A and B contained the T7 tag, band A contained the C-terminal segment, but band C contained neither the T7 tag nor the C-terminal segment (Fig. 2 C). Thus, the membrane topology of bands A, B, and C was deduced as shown in Fig. 2 D; bands A and B were inserted across the membrane with the N-terminal portion exposed to the lumenal space (i.e. corresponding to the intermembrane space side), whereas band C was inserted into the membrane with both the N- and C-terminal domains remaining on the outer surface of the INVs (i.e. corresponding to the matrix side). It is not known why the C-terminal segment of band A was resistant to proteinase K. The positive net charges in the C-terminal domain (Fig.2 A) might interact with the negatively charged phospholipid head groups and prevent access to the protease (21Gallusser A. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2723-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To further examine the integration process, the translocation time course was examined. As shown in Fig. 3 (B andC), the majority of T7-Su8 was initially inserted into the membrane in the band C topology, which then decreased gradually. In contrast, T7-Su8 with the A or B topologies increased over time for 50 min in a manner reciprocal to band C. The N terminus of band C seemed to translocate over time across the membrane to assume the topology of bands A and B.Figure 3Insertion of T7-Su8 across INVs requires mitochondrial matrix fraction. A, time course of insertion of T7-Su8 in the absence of the mitochondrial matrix fraction.

Bands A, B, and C in the fluorograms in panels A and B were quantified using a Bioimage Analyzer (FLA2000).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Post-translational membrane integration of T7-Su8 in the correct topology strictly depended on the mitochondrial matrix fraction (Figs. 3, A and C, and 4). In the absence or the presence of the heat-treated matrix fraction, only a trace amount of bands A and B was detectable (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, only a slight retardation in the accumulation of the C topology was observed in the absence of the matrix fraction (Fig. 3, A and C). The accumulation of T7-Su8 with the A and B topologies was strictly dependent on the amount of the matrix fraction added to the reaction (Fig. 4 C). These results clearly indicate that the matrix fraction was required for the insertion of the N terminus of T7-Su8 across the membrane. We then examined whether T7-Su8 with the band C topology could be chased to the band A and B topologies in a matrix fraction-dependent manner. The INVs that were incubated with T7-Su8 in the absence of the matrix fraction were recovered by centrifugation and incubated further with or without the matrix fraction, followed by proteinase K digestion (Fig.5 A). As shown in Fig. 5(B and C), in the absence of the matrix fraction, a small amount of band C was converted to bands A and B, the background activity of which was probably derived from contamination by theE. coli S-30 fraction. The mitochondrial matrix fraction significantly stimulated the conversion (Fig. 5, B andC), thus indicating that membrane translocation of the N-terminal segment of T7-Su8 strictly depended on the matrix fraction.Figure 5The matrix fraction mediates insertion of the N-terminal portion of the initially inserted T7-Su8 across INVs. A, schematic presentation of the matrix fraction-independent insertion of T7-Su8 and the subsequent chase-translocation in the presence of the matrix fraction.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6299-6306Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we examined the role of hydrophobic forces on the insertion of T7-Su8 across INVs. We constructed the T7-Su8 mutants TM1 and TM2, in which hydrophobic residues in the former (TM1) and the latter (TM2) half of the TMD were replaced by hydrophilic residues (Fig.6 A). Membrane integration activity greatly deteriorated in TM1 and was completely lost in TM2 (Fig. 6 B), indicating that hydrophobicity of the TMD is crucial for the matrix fraction-dependent membrane insertion of T7-Su8. Oxa1p mediates export of the negatively charged N- or C-terminal tails or the loops connecting the TMDs to the intermembrane space in CoxII and nuclear-encoded preOxa1p (10Hell K. Herrmann J.M.

Cell. 1997; 8: 1449-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This export process resembles the bacterial N-tail export mechanism of the M13 procoat protein; it depends on the membrane potential and an Oxa1p homologue, YidC (17Dalbey R.E. Kuhn A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 51-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 27Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The N terminus of Pf3 coat protein is exported in a membrane potential-dependent manner (25Kiefer D. Hu X. Dalbey R. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2197-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether the export of the N terminus of T7-Su8 depends on the membrane potential and/or ATP. The insertion reaction was temperature-dependent (Fig.7 A), and neither ATP depletion from the reaction mixture nor dissipation of the membrane potential with ionophores inhibited the export (Fig. 7, B andC). Furthermore, neither ATPγS nor GTPγS affected the export efficiency (data not shown). These and the above results indicate that neither the membrane potential nor a nucleotide triphosphate-coupled system was involved in the translocation of the N terminus of T7-Su8 across the inner membrane and suggest that this process was driven mainly by hydrophobic forces. The N terminus of T7-Su8 translocated with a slightly faster time course when succinate was present in the assay system, suggesting that the membrane potential slightly affects the translocation, although it is not essential for the translocation (data not shown). We examined whether protein components exposed to the outer surface of INVs are involved in the translocation of the N terminus of T7-Su8. Trypsin treatment of the vesicles did not inhibit the matrix fraction-assisted translocation (Fig. 7 D), indicating that the membrane components exposed to the matrix surface are not involved in the translocation process. The possibility that the components or the segments deeply embedded in the inner membrane take part in this process, however, cannot be ruled out. Several proteins in the Sec-independent pathways of E. coli (e.g. Pf3 coat protein) and chloroplast thylakoids (e.g. CF0II, PsbX, and PsbW; see “Discussion”) insert directly across the lipid bilayer (17Dalbey R.E. Kuhn A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 51-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether T7-Su8 can translocate across synthetic liposomes. As shown in Fig.8, T7-Su8 was inserted across liposomes over time in the same topologies as in the case for INVs (Fig.8 A), and this reaction was dependent on the matrix fraction (Fig. 8, B and C), although the kinetics of the insertion were slightly different between them (compare Fig.3 C with Fig. 8 C). The precurser-product relation between band C and bands A plus B was not apparent in liposomes, suggesting that the translocation step might be rate-limiting in the absence of the membrane proteins. In any event, these results indicate that T7-Su8 can be inserted directly across the lipid bilayer in a matrix fraction-dependent manner. The mitochondrially synthesized proteins CoxI, CoxII, and CoxIII and the nuclear encoded mitochondrial precursor protein with a bipartite sorting signal, preOxa1p, are inserted across the membrane by Oxa1-dependent translocase in a membrane potential-dependent manner (10Hell K.

Nevertheless, the insertion mechanism of the other mitochondrially synthesized proteins is not well understood. We developed an in vitro insertion assay system and analyzed the insertion of Su8 across the INVs. This assay system revealed that T7-Su8 is first inserted into the outside of INVs in ancis-cis orientation, and then the N terminus translocates in a matrix fraction-dependent manner to the lumenal side to assume the correcttrans-cis orientation. This insertion can proceed post-translationally and neither requires ATP nor membrane potential, although the membrane potential slightly stimulates the reaction. Because the insertion activity is significantly impaired by decreasing hydrophobicity of the TMD, hydrophobic forces seem to have a crucial role in membrane translocation, whereas electrical force has an auxiliary function to translocate the negatively charged N-terminal segment. Furthermore, trypsin treatment of INVs does not interfere with the translocation activity, suggesting that surface (i.e.matrix side) exposed protein regions of the translocation components, if any, are not essential. Because Oxa1p exposes protease-susceptible charged segments to the outer surface of INVs, Oxa1 is probably not involved in the insertion of T7-Su8. In this respect, the insertion of T7-Su8 across membranes resembles that of the Pf3 coat protein of E. coli inner membrane and ATPase subunit CF0II and PsbX and PsbW of photosystem II ofArabidopsis thylakoids. CF0II, PsbX, and PsbW are synthesized in the cytosol with a bipartite targeting signal, and after processing of the stroma-targeting signal they are inserted from the stroma across the membrane, independent of SRP, SecA, SecYE, nucleotide triphosphates, and membrane potential (16Dalbey R.E.

Protease treatment of thylakoid membrane does not impair their insertion across the membranes (41Kim S.J. Robinson C. Mant A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Of note, Pf3 coat protein insertion strictly depends on membrane potential. This is probably because the hydrophobicity of the TMD is insufficient to drive insertion, because an extended TMD allows for membrane insertion in the absence of membrane potential (26Kiefer D. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6299-6306Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Whether the insertion of these proteins across the membranes proceeds in the membrane translocator-mediated pathway or in the translocator-independent direct insertion mechanism still remains to be clarified. In any event, our present results suggest that a unique membrane translocation mechanism that is conserved in E. coli and chloroplasts is also present in mitochondria. The function of the mitochondrial matrix fraction remains to be established. Translocation of the N terminus of T7-Su8 depends strictly on the mitochondrial matrix fraction, whose activity is inactivated by heat treatment. We speculate that the matrix fraction makes the conformation of T7-Su8 translocation-competent. Because the initial membrane insertion of T7-Su8 in the cis-cisorientation (band C orientation) does not require the matrix fraction, newly synthesized T7-Su8 should assume the insertion-competent conformation. Rather, the matrix fraction is required for the subsequent step of translocation of the T7-Su8 N terminus across the membrane. Another possibility might be that the matrix fraction functions similarly to Sec A and drives the insertion of the substrate protein into the lipid bilayer. This is not consistent with the present results, however, because T7-Su8 was inserted across the membrane spontaneously in the presence of the matrix fraction. Additional analysis is required.
