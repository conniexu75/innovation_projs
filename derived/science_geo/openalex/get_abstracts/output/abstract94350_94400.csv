https://openalex.org/W2027523671,"Intracerebroventricular administration of oxytocin to virgin female rats that had been ovariectomized and primed with estrogen 48 hours previously induced a rapid onset of full maternal behavior. The maternal behavior persisted and its incidence was dose-related. Tocinoic acid, the ring structure of oxytocin, also rapidly induced the onset of persistent, full maternal behavior. Arginine vasopressin induced persistent maternal behavior, but this behavior had a later onset. Prostaglandin F2 alpha induced strong partial maternal behavior, which showed early onset but did not persist. Many other peptides, ovarian steroids, and prostaglandin E2 were no more effective than saline. These findings suggest that the release of oxytocin and prostaglandin F2 alpha during labor may promote maternal behavior in rats."

https://openalex.org/W1522259447,"Melittin is the principal protein component of bee venom and is thought to function as a lytic agent. Despite its predominantly hydrophobic character, melittin is soluble as a tetramer in aqueous salt solutions. We report here on the determination of the crystal structure of tetrameric melittin at 2.8-A resolution by the method of multiple isomorphous replacement, followed by partial atomic refinement at 2.0-A resolution. The melittin tetramer contains a noncrystallographic 2-fold axis of symmetry in addition to a crystallographic 2-fold axis, so that the four polypeptide chains have nearly identical structures. The noncrystallographic 2-fold axis was utilized twice during the determination of the structure. The multiple isomorphous replacement electron density map was averaged over this 2-fold axis before model building and strict noncrystallographic symmetry was assumed during the initial stages of atomic refinement. The 2.8-A resolution electron density map suggests that the melittin monomer contains two alpha-helical regions separated by a non-alpha-helical segment at residues 11 and 12. Difference maps at 2.0-A resolution tend to confirm this structure and reveal that at least six solvent molecules are bound to the melittin tetramer in the crystal. The relatively high occupancies of four of these suggest that they are ions of crystallization rather than water molecules."

https://openalex.org/W1580349070,"Human coagulation factor V was purified from freshly frozen plasma by a method that gave high yields of single chain factor V. The purified protein has an Mr = 330,000 and consists of a single polypeptide chain with the following NH2-terminal sequence: Ala-Gln-Leu-Gly-Gln-Phe-Tyr-Val. Limited proteolysis of factor V by thrombin led to formation of factor Va which has a cofactor activity 25- to 30-fold that of factor V. Two intermediates and four end products were formed in the course of activation. From the NH2 terminus of factor V the end products are termed (apparent molecular weights in parentheses), fragment D (105,000), E (71,000), C1 (150,000), and F1F2 (71-74,000). The carboxyl-terminal fragment F1F2 is a doublet presumably resulting from cleavage of one of two approximately equally sensitive bonds. The end products but not the intermediates resemble those obtained on thrombin activation of bovine factor V, indicating a different order of peptide bond cleavages. The thrombin-catalyzed activation of purified factor V resembles the activation of factor V in plasma as judged from the activation pattern of a 125I-labeled factor V tracer in coagulating plasma. Fragments D and F1F2 are held together by noncovalent interactions and constitute the biologically active factor V molecule as judged from reconstitution experiments utilizing the isolated fragments. The two fragments (E and C1), derived from the interior of the molecule, are activation peptides."

https://openalex.org/W2152810225,"Naturally occurring t haplotypes are chromosome 17 polymorphisms that suppress genetic recombination in t/+ heterozygotes over a long distance that includes the H-2 complex. There is strong linkage disequilibrium between t haplotypes and H-2 haplotypes; over 20 independently isolated t chromosomes representing eight different complementation groups share only four H-2 haplotypes. Thus t haplotypes and their associated H-2 loci are inherited en bloc as a “supergene” complex, whose frequency is driven in wild mouse populations by their high transmission from male t heterozygotes. This phenomenon must therefore serve as an important regulator of H-2 polymorphisms. Genes within the region of recombination suppression in t haplotypes have been mapped by crossing-over that occurs readily between two different t haplo-types situated in trans, and by this means we show here that the H-2 complex occupies an anomalous position in t haplotypes, mapping proximal to the locus of tf closely flanked by t-lethal mutations."

https://openalex.org/W1641872032,"Hemoglobin-catalyzed phenylhydrazine oxidation, a model for Heinz-body hemolytic anemias, is known to result in hemoglobin degradation and erythrocyte lysis. The catalytic reaction is shown here to be terminated by inactivation of the prosthetic heme groups after each heme moiety catalyzes the consumption of 6 oxygen molecules and 6 phenylhydrazines, and the formation of 5 benzenes. The phenyl residue not converted to benzene is primarily found, after acidic methanol workup, covalently bound to a nitrogen of protoporphyrin IX. Analogous reactions are observed with substituted phenylhydrazines and, to a lesser degree due to their slower oxidation, with alkylhydrazines. Ortho-substituted phenylhydrazines, however, do not give the N-aryl heme derivatives even though they inactivate the hemoproteins. ESR spin-trapping experiments establish that all of the hydrazines are oxidized to carbon radicals. Direct evidence is provided for the formation of a globin-stabilized heme complex which terminates catalytic activity and which, depending on the conditions of protein denaturation, reverts to heme or is converted to the corresponding N-aryl heme derivative. The globin-stabilized intermediate appears to involve direct coordination of the aryl group through one of its carbon atoms with the prosthetic heme iron moiety."

Exposure to five repetitive electric pulses of about 1 kilovolt per centimeter with a duration of 50 microseconds caused approximately 20 percent of the cells to become fused (multinucleate) when 1 millimolar magnesium was present in the medium. The effects of minimum thresholds of field strength, pulse duration, and number of pulses were determined. Cell disruption was observed when the electric field exceeded 2.0 kilovolts per centimeter or the pulse was of longer duration than 120 microseconds."
https://openalex.org/W1608391891,"A simple method based on the differential extraction of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) by saline and albumin solutions has been developed to study the factors that influence lipid translocation across intact human erythrocyte membrane. With this assay, the rate of LPC translocation across the bilayer at 37 degrees C was found to be 1.87% h (0.0187 h-1). Identical translocation rates were derived for normal cells and cells in which the ATP was totally depleted, implying that the metabolic state of the cell had no influence. In contrast, the translocation rate was strongly influenced by temperature. Above 21 degrees C, the rate doubled for every 51 degrees C increase in temperature, suggesting an important role for diffusion through the lipid phase. Denaturation of a single major skeletal protein, spectrin, by heating cells to 5 degrees C did not alter the translocation rate. However, oxidative cross-linking of a complex of membrane proteins by treatment with diamide significantly increased the rate of translocation at 37 degrees C. Cholesterol enrichment of the cells decreased the apparent rate of translocation but not the total quantity of LPC translocated. Taken together, these data suggest that lipid translocation across the intact human erythrocyte membrane is not energy dependent, and that it is influenced by the organizational state of both the lipid and protein moieties of the membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1994514032,"Many nucleus-encoded mitochondrial enzymes differ in physical and chemical properties from analogous cytoplasmic enzymes, and it is therefore generally assumed that different genes encode analogous mitochondrial and cytoplasmic enzymes. However, our genetic studies show that for at least two different tRNA modifications, mutations in nuclear genes affect cytoplasmic as well as mitochondrial tRNAs. These studies utilize two yeast genes: TRM1 and TRM2. trm1 cells do not have the enzyme activity necessary to methylate guanosine to N2,N2-dimethylguanosine. trm2 is a new mutation that we describe here. trm2 cells are deficient in tRNA-(uridine-5)methyltransferase, and hence contain tRNA lacking 5-methyluridine or ribothymidine. Other than lacking 5-methyluridine trm2 cells have no obvious physiological defect. These studies also show that the N2,N2-dimethylguanosine and 5-methyluridine modifications are not added to tRNA in an obligatory order, and that 5-methyluridine is not required for removal of intervening sequences from precursor tRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2112065937,"The t haplotypes of mouse chromosome 17 are natural polymorphisms in wild populations that contain mutations that affect or control such diverse functions as tail length, embryonic lethality and maturation and function of male germ cells. The major impediment to dissecting the genetics of this complex region has been its unusual property of recombination suppression in heterozygotes with wild-type chromosomes. Recently it was shown that recombination suppression does not occur in heterozygotes containing two different t haplotypes, which suggested that t chromosomes may be mismatched with respect to wild-type but share sequences that permit crossing-over between them. Thus for the first time questions of allelism and map positions of the t-lethal mutations can be addressed. We report here the results of three experiments that analyzed the tw12 haplotype trans to either tw5, tw32 or tw18. In all cases these lethal mutations were nonallelic to tw12. These results, together with evidence for functional relatedness, suggest the t-lethals may be a gene family spread out over more than 15 centiMorgans of chromosome 17."

https://openalex.org/W1487589123,"The effect of 3-deazaadenosine on phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis has been studied in rat liver in vivo and in adult rat hepatocytes maintained in monolayer culture. The drug had a marked inhibitory effect on phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis via the N-methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine. In contrast, treatment of rats or hepatocytes with 3-deazaadenosine caused a 2- to %fold increase in phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis via CDP-choline. The effect of the drug was much less marked on phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis in rat spleen, and no significant effect was observed in rat brain. Experiments indicated that the reaction catalyzed by CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase was stimulated approximately %fold by treatment of the hepatocytes with 3-deazaadenosine and this could account for the increased rate of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. This enzyme activation appeared to be associated with a redistribution of enzyme protein from the cytosol to the microsomes. No effect was observed on the activity of microsomal phosphatidylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase. However, a metabolite of 3-deazaadenosine, S-3-deazasdenosylL-homocysteine, was shown to be a competitive inhibitor of the N-methyltransferase with respect to S-adenosyl-L-methionine. The results suggest that treatment with 3-deazaadenosine causes an inhibition of phosphatidylethanolamine-N-methylation by the accumulation of two competitive inhibitors, S-adenosylL-homocysteine and S-3-deazaadenosyl-~-homocysteine. There appears to be cookdinate regulation of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis via CDP-choline and N-methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine. However, the mechanism by which 3-deazaadenosine causes a stimulation and redistribution of the cytidylyltransferase reaction remains to be elucidated."

https://openalex.org/W1528509040,"To examine the possibility that Factor XIII zymogens bind to fibrinogen, we have studied the reaction between radiolabeled Factor XIII and fibrinogen coupled to beads. Platelet and plasma Factor XIII were iodinated with Na(125I)iodide using lactoperoxidase. Both forms of 125I-Factor XIII retained greater than 92% of the transglutaminase activity. 125I-platelet and plasma Factor XIII specifically bound to human fibrinogen covalently coupled to either carboxylated latex or acrylonitrile beads but not to fetuin- or albumin-coated beads. Unlabeled platelet Factor XIII inhibited 90% of the total binding of 125I-platelet and 125I-plasma Factor XIII to fibrinogen, whereas human IgG, fetuin, and serum albumin had no effect. These data suggest that 125I-platelet and plasma Factor XIII specifically bind to fibrinogen by the a2 subunit. 125I-Factor XIII which was bound to the fibrinogen beads migrated identically to unbound material on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Soluble fibrinogen inhibited binding of 125I-Factor XIII to fibrinogen beads, indicating that binding is not due to alteration of the fibrinogen coupled to the beads. Binding of 125I-Factor XIII was reversible and time- and temperature-dependent: maximal binding occurred by 1 min at 37 degrees C. Binding was independent of calcium; 10 mM EDTA had no effect. Binding was dependent on sodium chloride concentration; complete inhibition of binding occurred at concentrations above 300 mM NaCl. The Kd for binding, 1 X 10(-8) M, is approximately 7-fold higher than the concentration of Factor XIII in plasma. These data support the hypothesis that Factor XIII circulates in plasma bound to fibrinogen. This interaction may play a role in regulating the physiologic activation and function of Factor XIII."
https://openalex.org/W14143485,"Chloride ion is required for platelet serotonin transport. This anion requirement is relatively specific for Cl-. Only Br- fully substitutes, while SCN-, NO2-, and NO3- are much less effective. Serotonin influx requires external Cl-, and efflux requires internal Cl-. Although internal Cl- is not required for transport and has little effect on the initial rate of influx, it decreases the steady state level of serotonin accumulation. Chloride ion does not merely fulfill a need for a permanent ion since it is required for exchange of internal with external serotonin. Moreover, serotonin accumulation still requires external Cl- when a K+ diffusion potential (interior negative) is imposed across the vesicle membrane with valinomycin. Furthermore, Cl- lowers the Km and raises the Vmax for transport, suggesting direct effects on the transporter. These results strongly suggest serotonin-Cl- co-transport across the platelet plasma membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1509453541,"A method to quantitate the extent of phosphorylation of the 20,000-dalton phosphorylatable myosin light chain (P-light chain) in cardiac, smooth, or skeletal muscle samples which have limited amounts of tissue and myosin is presented. Native myosin is isolated from other cellular proteins in crude homogenates prepared from a few milligrams of muscle by pyrophosphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The extent of P-light chain phosphorylation is maintained throughout this procedure by the inclusion of myosin light chain kinase and phosphatase inhibitors. Myosin obtained by pyrophosphate-gel electrophoresis is subjected to isoelectric focusing on polyacrylamide gels to separate the phosphorylated from the nonphosphorylated forms of the P-light chain. Following staining with ammonial-silver phosphorylation is quantitated on a mole of phosphate incorporated per mol of P-light chain basis by densitometric scanning of the isoelectric focusing gels. Direct comparison of this methodology with another method used for quantitating phosphorylation revealed no difference between the techniques in measuring the extent of P-light chain phosphorylation in muscle biopsy samples. This methodology provides the means for examination of the possible regulatory roles of P-light chain phosphorylation in contraction of cardiac, smooth, skeletal muscle."

https://openalex.org/W2138003248,"We have studied the viral genes playing a role in persistence of reovirus in L cells. We established persistent infections by coinfecting L cells using wild-type reovirus type 2 and defective reovirus type 3. An analysis of the genomic double-stranded RNA pattern of the virus population selected during persistent infection revealed that the S4 gene was derived from the defective parent in three independently established lines, suggesting that the S4 gene plays an essential role in the establishment of persistent infection. The selection of recombinant viruses containing the S4 gene derived from the defective virus was specific for persistent infection, since it was not selected in lytic infections. Following the establishment of persistent infection, mutations in the S1 gene appeared in two of three cell lines. Thus mutations in the S4 gene play a critical role in the establishment of persistent infection, while mutations in the S1 gene play a role in the maintenance of the persistent infection."
https://openalex.org/W1550992877,"When a mixture of DNA-free core histones (H) from calf thymus is phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, phosphate is incorporated primarily into H2B and, to a lesser extent, into H3 and H4. In contrast, when the phosphorylation of the DNA-free histones is compared to the phosphorylation of histones in long chromatin or in nucleosome core, only one of the core histones, H3, is phosphorylated. The site of modification of H3 has been identified as serine 10, which is located in the highly charged basic NH2-terminal region of the molecule. The other sites of phosphorylation in H2B nd H4 are completely masked when the histones are complexed with DNA. It is only when the nucleosome core structure is perturbed that these additional sites become accessible to the kinase. If long chromatin which contains H1 is phosphorylated, histone 1 is also phosphorylated by catalytic subunit at serine 38. However, the addition of excess H1 to H1-depleted long chromatin inhibits the phosphorylation of H3. In addition to the histones, the high mobility group (HMG) protein, HMG 14, was also found to be a good substrate for the kinase. Phosphorylation of HMG 17 in comparison was much less."
https://openalex.org/W1656849515,"Cyclopropanone hydrate irreversibly inactivates horseradish peroxidase in a time-dependent manner in the presence of oxidizing agent, hydrogen peroxide. The inhibition reaction is a second order reaction of cyclopropanone hydrate with compound I, the 2 electron-oxidized form of peroxidase, and results in covalent modification of the heme cofactor. A new propionic acid side chain is substituted for one of the methine protons of the heme. A mechanism for inhibition is proposed to involve oxidative ring opening of cyclopropanone hydrate to give the primary free radical of propionic acid, which subsequently alkylates the heme. An isoporphyrin pi cation intermediate is predicted by this mechanism, and this intermediate has been detected spectroscopically."

https://openalex.org/W1572652023,"Mammalian aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are often found in several different molecular weight forms in the same extract, although the structural basis for this diversity is not clear. In this report, we describe the separation of high and low molecular weight forms of rat liver arginyl-tRNA synthetase, and the extensive purification to near homogeneity of the low molecular weight form of the enzyme, free of other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. The purified enzyme catalyses the incorporation into tRNA of 9,500 nmol of arginine/min/mg of protein under optimal assay conditions, corresponding to a turnover number of approximately 550 min-1. The molecular weight of the native enzyme was calculated to be approximately 59,000 based on a sedimentation coefficient of about 3.6 S and a Stokes radius of 39 A. The subunit molecular weight based on sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gel electrophoresis was also about 60,000, indicating that the enzyme is a monomer. The relation of this form of arginyl-tRNA synthetase to the high molecular weight form and its possible origin are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1577689231,"Previous studies on scleral proteoglycans (proteodermatan sulfate) using light scattering and ultracentrifugation techniques have shown that the molecules form aggregates in 0.15 M NaCl (Coster, L., Fransson, L.-A., Sheehan, J. K., Nieduszynski, I. A., and Phelps, C. F. (1981) Biochem. J., 197, 483-490). Aggregation was not promoted by hyaluronate but addition of free scleral dermatan sulfate chains enhanced multimerization. To investigate the possibility that scleral proteoglycans interact via their dermatan sulfate side chains, we have adopted an affinity chromatography procedure where binding of proteoglycans to various dermatan sulfate-agaroses may be studied. The evidence for an interaction between the side chains of the macromolecules and the immobilized dermatan sulfates are as follows: (a) the dermatan sulfate chains released from the proteoglycan by proteolysis display affinity for dermatan sulfate-agarose, (b) a significant proportion of the [3H]acetylated proteoglycans that were bound to the dermatan sulfate gel can be displaced by eluting with a solution of dermatan sulfate chains, (c) selective periodate oxidation of L-iduronate in the dermatan sulfate chains of the proteoglycans abolishes the affinity, (d) the core protein prepared by chondroitinase ABC digestion of the proteoglycan does not bind to dermatan sulfate-agarose, and (e) binding is retained after reduction-alkylation of the protein core. Furthermore, free [3H]dermatan sulfate chains co-elute with the proteoglycan upon gel filtration in 0.2 M NaCl."

https://openalex.org/W1567249833,"We have measured the binding of two radioiodinated monoclonal anti-dinitrophenyl antibodies (IgE and IgG2a) to two dinitrophenylated lipid haptens in lipid bilayer membranes having various compositions and physical properties. These antibodies bind strongly to the lipophilic dinitrophenyl group in some membranes. Dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine and dipentadecanoylphosphatidylcholine containing 2 mol % dinitrophenyl lipid hapten bind anti-dinitrophenyl antibodies below the chain-melting transition temperatures of these lipids (22 and 35 degrees C, respectively) but not above these temperatures. Evidently, the lipophilic dinitrophenyl group is partially or completely buried in the hydrophobic region of these bilayers at temperatures above the chain-melting transition temperatures. The inclusion of increasing concentrations of cholesterol in such membranes (e.g. in dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine at 37 degrees C) results in a marked enhancement of antibody binding. It was found that a third lipid hapten containing the dinitrophenyl group does not show this strong dependence of antibody binding on the physical state of the lipid membrane. The weak immunologic degranulation of rat basophil leukemia cells by dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine membrane targets at 37 degrees C can be attributed to a weak binding of anti-dinitrophenyl IgE to these membranes (Balakrishnan, K., Hsu, F. J., Cooper, A. D., and McConnell, H. M. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 6427-6433). However, if the antibody is first allowed to bind to this membrane below the lipid chain-melting transition temperature, these IgE-coated membrane targets are very effective in releasing serotonin from the rat basophil leukemia cells when the temperature is raised to 37 degrees C."

Pharmacol. 28, 651-655). Its effect on nucleic acid synthesis in vitro in isolated nuclei has now been investigated. DNA synthesis in nuclei was inhibited by methyl mercury; 50% inhibition was obtained with a concentration of 8 microM, compared to approximately 30 microM which is required in vivo. In contrast, RNA synthesis in HeLa nuclei was stimulated by methyl mercury. This stimulation is specific for alpha-amanitin-sensitive RNA synthesis (catalyzed by RNA polymerase II); in contrast, alpha-amanitin-resistant synthesis (catalyzed by polymerases I and III) was inhibited. Transcription of calf thymus DNA by solubilized RNA polymerases was inhibited by ethyl mercury. However, if the enzymes were preincubated with the DNA prior to addition of the methyl mercury, subsequent synthesis by RNA polymerase II was stimulated, whereas the inhibition of the other enzymes was unaffected. The most likely explanation for these results is that methyl mercury specifically stimulates chain elongation by RNA polymerase II whereas it inhibits elongation by polymerases I and III, and initiation by all three enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2382592886,"The lack of ubiquinone in the isolated succinate-ubiquinone reductase (Complex II) and in some preparations of ubiquinone-binding protein (QPs) has caused some concern about the nature of interaction between ubiquinone and QPs. When a low concentration of radioactively labeled ubiquinone derivative in dilute detergent solution was incubated with delipidated or intact succinate-ubiquinone reductase followed by high speed centrifugation, a stoichiometric amount of radioactive ubiquinone derivative was taken up by protein, indicating that the interaction between ubiquinone and protein is specific and strong. The specific interaction between ubiquinone and delipidated succinate-ubiquinone reductase was also confirmed by observation of a protein-dependent, pronase-sensitive spectral shift of ubiquinone. When ubiquinone was bound to succinateubiquinone reductase in aqueous solution, it showed an absorption maximum at 282 nm instead of 288 nm, the absorption peak when no protein is present. Delipidated succinate-ubiquinone reductase was reacted with a photoaffinity labeled ubiquinone derivative, followed by photolysis and electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and 8-mercaptoethanol. The radioactivity was located mainly in the two low molecular weight subunits which contain QPs, indicating that ubiquinone is preferentially bound to the QPs. The specific interaction between ubiquinone and protein in succinate-ubiquinone reductase is stronger than that between the enzyme and Triton X-100. When succinatecytochrome c reductase was separated into succinateubiquinone and ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductases by treatment with Triton X-100 and calcium phosphate column chromatography, ubiquinone was bound to succinate-ubiquinone reductase. After a prolonged washing with 0.2% Emasolll30 solution, which removed all the bound Triton X-100, most of the ubiquinone remained bound to protein. The above results indicate that ubiquinone is specifically bound to protein."

A comparison of H1-depleted nuclei to complete nuclei indicates that the presence of H1 on the oligonucleosomes prevents their escape from the nucleus. Even core particles (140-150 base pairs of DNA) are preferentially retained in the nucleus of H1."

Biosynthesized surface components were analyzed by reacting [35S]methionine-labeled macrophages with trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid and purifying trinitrophenyl-substituted surface proteins by immunoprecipitation. Identification of gp160 was based on its molecular weight and unique trypsin sensitivity. In addition, [35S]methionine-labeled surface and intracellular glycoproteins were purified by Lens culinaris lectin affinity chromatography. Both purification procedures demonstrated that gp160 is biosynthesized by elicited macrophages in culture. gp160 was first detected on the cell surface 60-80 min after pulse labeling; transit to the cell surface was almost maximal at 3 h. No evidence was found for intracellular accumulation of mature gp160, i.e. in time course experiments all [35S]methionine-labeled gp160 was sensitive to trypsin treatment of intact cells. However, [35S]methionine-labeled gp160 was not detected in pulse-labeled macrophages until 60 min of nonradioactive chase incubation, indicating the existence of a precursor form."
