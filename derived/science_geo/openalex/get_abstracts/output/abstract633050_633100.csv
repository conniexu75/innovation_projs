https://openalex.org/W3106349779,"Hybrid classical-quantum algorithms aim at variationally solving optimisation problems, using a feedback loop between a classical computer and a quantum co-processor, while benefitting from quantum resources. Here we present experiments demonstrating self-verifying, hybrid, variational quantum simulation of lattice models in condensed matter and high-energy physics. Contrary to analog quantum simulation, this approach forgoes the requirement of realising the targeted Hamiltonian directly in the laboratory, thus allowing the study of a wide variety of previously intractable target models. Here, we focus on the Lattice Schwinger model, a gauge theory of 1D quantum electrodynamics. Our quantum co-processor is a programmable, trapped-ion analog quantum simulator with up to 20 qubits, capable of generating families of entangled trial states respecting symmetries of the target Hamiltonian. We determine ground states, energy gaps and, by measuring variances of the Schwinger Hamiltonian, we provide algorithmic error bars for energies, thus addressing the long-standing challenge of verifying quantum simulation."

Characterizing the global distribution of these symbioses and identifying the factors that control this distribution are thus integral to understanding the present and future functioning of forest ecosystems. Here we generate a spatially explicit global map of the symbiotic status of forests, using a database of over 1.1 million forest inventory plots that collectively contain over 28,000 tree species. Our analyses indicate that climate variables-in particular, climatically controlled variation in the rate of decomposition-are the primary drivers of the global distribution of major symbioses. We estimate that ectomycorrhizal trees, which represent only 2% of all plant species7, constitute approximately 60% of tree stems on Earth. Ectomycorrhizal symbiosis dominates forests in which seasonally cold and dry climates inhibit decomposition, and is the predominant form of symbiosis at high latitudes and elevation. By contrast, arbuscular mycorrhizal trees dominate in aseasonal, warm tropical forests, and occur with ectomycorrhizal trees in temperate biomes in which seasonally warm-and-wet climates enhance decomposition. Continental transitions between forests dominated by ectomycorrhizal or arbuscular mycorrhizal trees occur relatively abruptly along climate-driven decomposition gradients; these transitions are probably caused by positive feedback effects between plants and microorganisms. Symbiotic nitrogen fixers-which are insensitive to climatic controls on decomposition (compared with mycorrhizal fungi)-are most abundant in arid biomes with alkaline soils and high maximum temperatures. The climatically driven global symbiosis gradient that we document provides a spatially explicit quantitative understanding of microbial symbioses at the global scale, and demonstrates the critical role of microbial mutualisms in shaping the distribution of plant species."
https://openalex.org/W2944969418,"Nature uses 64 codons to encode the synthesis of proteins from the genome, and chooses 1 sense codon-out of up to 6 synonyms-to encode each amino acid. Synonymous codon choice has diverse and important roles, and many synonymous substitutions are detrimental. Here we demonstrate that the number of codons used to encode the canonical amino acids can be reduced, through the genome-wide substitution of target codons by defined synonyms. We create a variant of Escherichia coli with a four-megabase synthetic genome through a high-fidelity convergent total synthesis. Our synthetic genome implements a defined recoding and refactoring scheme-with simple corrections at just seven positions-to replace every known occurrence of two sense codons and a stop codon in the genome. Thus, we recode 18,214 codons to create an organism with a 61-codon genome; this organism uses 59 codons to encode the 20 amino acids, and enables the deletion of a previously essential transfer RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2946597534,"HIV/AIDS is a leading cause of disease burden in sub-Saharan Africa. Existing evidence has demonstrated that there is substantial local variation in the prevalence of HIV; however, subnational variation has not been investigated at a high spatial resolution across the continent. Here we explore within-country variation at a 5 × 5-km resolution in sub-Saharan Africa by estimating the prevalence of HIV among adults (aged 15–49 years) and the corresponding number of people living with HIV from 2000 to 2017. Our analysis reveals substantial within-country variation in the prevalence of HIV throughout sub-Saharan Africa and local differences in both the direction and rate of change in HIV prevalence between 2000 and 2017, highlighting the degree to which important local differences are masked when examining trends at the country level. These fine-scale estimates of HIV prevalence across space and time provide an important tool for precisely targeting the interventions that are necessary to bringing HIV infections under control in sub-Saharan Africa. Fine-scale estimates of the prevalence of HIV in adults across sub-Saharan Africa reveal substantial within-country variation and local differences in both the direction and rate of change in the prevalence of HIV between 2000 and 2017."
https://openalex.org/W2946801856,"Genetic and epigenetic intra-tumoral heterogeneity cooperate to shape the evolutionary course of cancer1. Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a highly informative model for cancer evolution as it undergoes substantial genetic diversification and evolution after therapy2,3. The CLL epigenome is also an important disease-defining feature4,5, and growing populations of cells in CLL diversify by stochastic changes in DNA methylation known as epimutations6. However, previous studies using bulk sequencing methods to analyse the patterns of DNA methylation were unable to determine whether epimutations affect CLL populations homogeneously. Here, to measure the epimutation rate at single-cell resolution, we applied multiplexed single-cell reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing to B cells from healthy donors and patients with CLL. We observed that the common clonal origin of CLL results in a consistently increased epimutation rate, with low variability in the cell-to-cell epimutation rate. By contrast, variable epimutation rates across healthy B cells reflect diverse evolutionary ages across the trajectory of B cell differentiation, consistent with epimutations serving as a molecular clock. Heritable epimutation information allowed us to reconstruct lineages at high-resolution with single-cell data, and to apply this directly to patient samples. The CLL lineage tree shape revealed earlier branching and longer branch lengths than in normal B cells, reflecting rapid drift after the initial malignant transformation and a greater proliferative history. Integration of single-cell bisulfite sequencing analysis with single-cell transcriptomes and genotyping confirmed that genetic subclones mapped to distinct clades, as inferred solely on the basis of epimutation information. Finally, to examine potential lineage biases during therapy, we profiled serial samples during ibrutinib-associated lymphocytosis, and identified clades of cells that were preferentially expelled from the lymph node after treatment, marked by distinct transcriptional profiles. The single-cell integration of genetic, epigenetic and transcriptional information thus charts the lineage history of CLL and its evolution with therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2945293993,"Autonomic nerve fibres in the tumour microenvironment regulate cancer initiation and dissemination, but how nerves emerge in tumours is currently unknown. Here we show that neural progenitors from the central nervous system that express doublecortin (DCX+) infiltrate prostate tumours and metastases, in which they initiate neurogenesis. In mouse models of prostate cancer, oscillations of DCX+ neural progenitors in the subventricular zone-a neurogenic area of the central nervous system-are associated with disruption of the blood-brain barrier, and with the egress of DCX+ cells into the circulation. These cells then infiltrate and reside in the tumour, and can generate new adrenergic neurons. Selective genetic depletion of DCX+ cells inhibits the early phases of tumour development in our mouse models of prostate cancer, whereas transplantation of DCX+ neural progenitors promotes tumour growth and metastasis. In humans, the density of DCX+ neural progenitors is strongly associated with the aggressiveness and recurrence of prostate adenocarcinoma. These results reveal a unique crosstalk between the central nervous system and prostate tumours, and indicate neural targets for the treatment of cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2945840175,"Mitochondria contain their own genomes that, unlike nuclear genomes, are inherited only in the maternal line. Owing to a high mutation rate and low levels of recombination of mitrochondrial DNA (mtDNA), special selection mechanisms exist in the female germline to prevent the accumulation of deleterious mutations1-5. However, the molecular mechanisms that underpin selection are poorly understood6. Here we visualize germline selection in Drosophila using an allele-specific fluorescent in situ-hybridization approach to distinguish wild-type from mutant mtDNA. Selection first manifests in the early stages of Drosophila oogenesis, triggered by reduction of the pro-fusion protein Mitofusin. This leads to the physical separation of mitochondrial genomes into different mitochondrial fragments, which prevents the mixing of genomes and their products and thereby reduces complementation. Once fragmented, mitochondria that contain mutant genomes are less able to produce ATP, which marks them for selection through a process that requires the mitophagy proteins Atg1 and BNIP3. A reduction in Atg1 or BNIP3 decreases the amount of wild-type mtDNA, which suggests a link between mitochondrial turnover and mtDNA replication. Fragmentation is not only necessary for selection in germline tissues, but is also sufficient to induce selection in somatic tissues in which selection is normally absent. We postulate that there is a generalizable mechanism for selection against deleterious mtDNA mutations, which may enable the development of strategies for the treatment of mtDNA disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2945519993,"Solid tumours are infiltrated by effector T cells with the potential to control or reject them, as well as by regulatory T (Treg) cells that restrict the function of effector T cells and thereby promote tumour growth1. The anti-tumour activity of effector T cells can be therapeutically unleashed, and is now being exploited for the treatment of some forms of human cancer. However, weak tumour-associated inflammatory responses and the immune-suppressive function of Treg cells remain major hurdles to broader effectiveness of tumour immunotherapy2. Here we show that, after disruption of the CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) signalosome complex, most tumour-infiltrating Treg cells produce IFNγ, resulting in stunted tumour growth. Notably, genetic deletion of both or even just one allele of CARMA1 (also known as Card11) in only a fraction of Treg cells-which avoided systemic autoimmunity-was sufficient to produce this anti-tumour effect, showing that it is not the mere loss of suppressive function but the gain of effector activity by Treg cells that initiates tumour control. The production of IFNγ by Treg cells was accompanied by activation of macrophages and upregulation of class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex on tumour cells. However, tumour cells also upregulated the expression of PD-L1, which indicates activation of adaptive immune resistance3. Consequently, blockade of PD-1 together with CARMA1 deletion caused rejection of tumours that otherwise do not respond to anti-PD-1 monotherapy. This effect was reproduced by pharmacological inhibition of the CBM protein MALT1. Our results demonstrate that partial disruption of the CBM complex and induction of IFNγ secretion in the preferentially self-reactive Treg cell pool does not cause systemic autoimmunity but is sufficient to prime the tumour environment for successful immune checkpoint therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2946284589,"Future information technology demands ever-faster, low-loss quantum control. Intense light fields have facilitated milestones along this way, including the induction of novel states of matter1-3, ballistic acceleration of electrons4-7 and coherent flipping of the valley pseudospin8. These dynamics leave unique 'fingerprints', such as characteristic bandgaps or high-order harmonic radiation. The fastest and least dissipative way of switching the technologically most important quantum attribute-the spin-between two states separated by a potential barrier is to trigger an all-coherent precession. Experimental and theoretical studies with picosecond electric and magnetic fields have suggested this possibility9-11, yet observing the actual spin dynamics has remained out of reach. Here we show that terahertz electromagnetic pulses allow coherent steering of spins over a potential barrier, and we report the corresponding temporal and spectral fingerprints. This goal is achieved by coupling spins in antiferromagnetic TmFeO3 (thulium orthoferrite) with the locally enhanced terahertz electric field of custom-tailored antennas. Within their duration of one picosecond, the intense terahertz pulses abruptly change the magnetic anisotropy and trigger a large-amplitude ballistic spin motion. A characteristic phase flip, an asymmetric splitting of the collective spin resonance and a long-lived offset of the Faraday signal are hallmarks of coherent spin switching into adjacent potential minima, in agreement with numerical simulations. The switchable states can be selected by an external magnetic bias. The low dissipation and the antenna's subwavelength spatial definition could facilitate scalable spin devices operating at terahertz rates."

https://openalex.org/W2944864150,"Complex multicellular organisms evolved on Earth in an oxygen-rich atmosphere1; their tissues, including stem-cell niches, require continuous oxygen provision for efficient energy metabolism2. Notably, the maintenance of the pluripotent state of animal stem cells requires hypoxic conditions, whereas higher oxygen tension promotes cell differentiation3. Here we demonstrate, using a combination of genetic reporters and in vivo oxygen measurements, that plant shoot meristems develop embedded in a low-oxygen niche, and that hypoxic conditions are required to regulate the production of new leaves. We show that hypoxia localized to the shoot meristem inhibits the proteolysis of an N-degron-pathway4,5 substrate known as LITTLE ZIPPER 2 (ZPR2)-which evolved to control the activity of the class-III homeodomain-leucine zipper transcription factors6-8-and thereby regulates the activity of shoot meristems. Our results reveal oxygen as a diffusible signal that is involved in the control of stem-cell activity in plants grown under aerobic conditions, which suggests that the spatially distinct distribution of oxygen affects plant development. In molecular terms, this signal is translated into transcriptional regulation by the N-degron pathway, thereby linking the control of metabolic activity to the regulation of development in plants."
https://openalex.org/W2945999435,"Transcriptional cofactors (COFs) communicate regulatory cues from enhancers to promoters and are central effectors of transcription activation and gene expression1. Although some COFs have been shown to prefer certain promoter types2–5 over others (for example, see refs 6,7), the extent to which different COFs display intrinsic specificities for distinct promoters is unclear. Here we use a high-throughput promoter-activity assay in Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells to screen 23 COFs for their ability to activate 72,000 candidate core promoters (CPs). We observe differential activation of CPs, indicating distinct regulatory preferences or ‘compatibilities’8,9 between COFs and specific types of CPs. These functionally distinct CP types are differentially enriched for known sequence elements2,4, such as the TATA box, downstream promoter element (DPE) or TCT motif, and display distinct chromatin properties at endogenous loci. Notably, the CP types differ in their relative abundance of H3K4me3 and H3K4me1 marks (see also refs 10–12), suggesting that these histone modifications might distinguish trans-regulatory factors rather than promoter- versus enhancer-type cis-regulatory elements. We confirm the existence of distinct COF–CP compatibilities in two additional Drosophila cell lines and in human cells, for which we find COFs that prefer TATA-box or CpG-island promoters, respectively. Distinct compatibilities between COFs and promoters can explain how different enhancers specifically activate distinct sets of genes9, alternative promoters within the same genes, and distinct transcription start sites within the same promoter13. Thus, COF–promoter compatibilities may underlie distinct transcriptional programs in species as divergent as flies and humans. A screen of 23 transcriptional cofactors for their ability to activate 72,000 candidate core promoters in Drosophila melanogaster identified distinct compatibility groups, providing insight into mechanisms that underlie the selective activation of transcriptional programs."
https://openalex.org/W2945205721,"Cell competition—the sensing and elimination of less fit ‘loser’ cells by neighbouring ‘winner’ cells—was first described in Drosophila. Although cell competition has been proposed as a selection mechanism to optimize tissue and organ development, its evolutionary generality remains unclear. Here, by using live imaging, lineage tracing, single-cell transcriptomics and genetics, we identify two cell competition mechanisms that sequentially shape and maintain the architecture of stratified tissue during skin development in mice. In the single-layered epithelium of the early embryonic epidermis, winner progenitors kill and subsequently clear neighbouring loser cells by engulfment. Later, as the tissue begins to stratify, the basal layer instead expels losers through upward flux of differentiating progeny. This cell competition switch is physiologically relevant: when it is perturbed, so too is barrier formation. Our findings show that cell competition is a selective force that optimizes vertebrate tissue function, and illuminate how a tissue dynamically adjusts cell competition strategies to preserve fitness as its architectural complexity increases during morphogenesis. Cell competition in the developing mouse epithelium involves apoptosis and engulfment when the epithelium has only one layer, but switches to involve asymmetric cell division and differentiation of ‘loser’ cells as the epithelium becomes stratified."
https://openalex.org/W2945765254,"Adult intestinal stem cells are located at the bottom of crypts of Lieberkühn, where they express markers such as LGR51,2 and fuel the constant replenishment of the intestinal epithelium1. Although fetal LGR5-expressing cells can give rise to adult intestinal stem cells3,4, it remains unclear whether this population in the patterned epithelium represents unique intestinal stem-cell precursors. Here we show, using unbiased quantitative lineage-tracing approaches, biophysical modelling and intestinal transplantation, that all cells of the mouse intestinal epithelium-irrespective of their location and pattern of LGR5 expression in the fetal gut tube-contribute actively to the adult intestinal stem cell pool. Using 3D imaging, we find that during fetal development the villus undergoes gross remodelling and fission. This brings epithelial cells from the non-proliferative villus into the proliferative intervillus region, which enables them to contribute to the adult stem-cell niche. Our results demonstrate that large-scale remodelling of the intestinal wall and cell-fate specification are closely linked. Moreover, these findings provide a direct link between the observed plasticity and cellular reprogramming of differentiating cells in adult tissues following damage5-9, revealing that stem-cell identity is an induced rather than a hardwired property."

https://openalex.org/W2945193235,"Rac-GTPases are major regulators of cytoskeletal remodeling and their deregulation contributes to numerous pathologies. Whether or how Rac promotes tubulointerstitial fibrosis and chronic kidney disease (CKD) is currently unknown. We showed that the major profibrotic cytokine, TGF-β1 promoted rapid Rac1-GTP loading in human kidney 2 (HK-2) human renal epithelial cells. A Rac-specific chemical inhibitor, EHT 1864, blocked TGF-β1-induced fibrotic reprogramming in kidney epithelial cells and fibroblasts. Stable Rac1 depletion in HK-2 cells, moreover, eliminated TGF-β1-mediated non-SMAD pathway activation [e.g., Src, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), p53] and subsequent plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), connective tissue growth factor, fibronectin, and p21 induction. Rac1 and p22phox knockdown abrogated free radical generation by TGF-β1 in HK-2 cells, consistent with the role of Rac1 in NAPD(H). TGF-β1-induced renal epithelial cytostasis was also completely bypassed by Rac1, p22phox, p47phox, and PAI-1 silencing. Rac1b isoform expression was robustly induced in the fibrotic kidneys of mice and humans. Intraperitoneal administration of EHT 1864 in mice dramatically attenuated ureteral unilateral obstruction-driven EGFR, p53, Rac1b, yes-associated protein/transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif activation/expression, dedifferentiation, cell cycle arrest, and renal fibrogenesis evident in vehicle-treated obstructed kidneys. Thus, the Rac1-directed redox response is critical for TGF-β1-driven epithelial dysfunction orchestrated, in part, via PAI-1 up-regulation. Rac pathway inhibition suppressed renal oxidative stress and maladaptive repair, identifying Rac as a novel therapeutic target against progressive CKD.-Patel, S., Tang, J., Overstreet, J.

On the basis of our previous work, we propose that these truncations could originate from lysosomal activity attributable to cysteine cathepsins (Cts). Here, using a transgenic SNCAA53T mouse model, overexpressing the PD-associated α-syn variant A53T, we compared levels of α-syn species in purified brain lysosomes from nonsymptomatic mice with those in age-matched symptomatic mice. In the symptomatic mice, antibody epitope mapping revealed enrichment of C-terminal truncations, resulting from CtsB, CtsL, and asparagine endopeptidase. We did not observe changes in individual cathepsin activities, suggesting that the increased levels of C-terminal α-syn truncations are because of the burden of aggregated α-syn. Using LC-MS and purified α-syn, we identified C-terminal truncations corresponding to amino acids 1–122 and 1–90 from the SNCAA53T lysosomes. Feeding rat dopaminergic N27 cells with exogenous α-syn fibrils confirmed that these fragments originate from incomplete fibril degradation in lysosomes. We mimicked these events in situ by asparagine endopeptidase degradation of α-syn fibrils. Importantly, the resulting C-terminally truncated fibrils acted as superior seeds in stimulating α-syn aggregation compared with that of the full-length fibrils. These results unequivocally show that C-terminal α-syn truncations in LBs are linked to Cts activities, promote amyloid formation, and contribute to PD pathogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2945308578,"Arsenic (As) is a carcinogenic and hazardous substance that poses a serious risk to human health due to its transport into the food chain. The present research is focused on the As transport in different lentil genotypes and the role of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF) in mitigation of As phyto-toxicity. Arsenic transport from soil to root, shoot and grains in different lentil genotypes was analyzed by flow injection hydride generation atomic absorption spectrophotometry. AMF were applied for the reduction of As uptake as well as the improvement of plant growth in lentil genotypes. Arsenic phyto-toxicity was dose-dependent as evidenced by relatively higher shoot length, fresh and dry weight of root and shoot in 5 and 15 mgkg-1 As-treated lentil plants than that in 100 mgkg-1 As-treated lentil. Arsenic accumulation occurred in roots and shoots of all BARI-released lentil genotypes. Arsenic accumulation in grains was found higher in BARI Mashur 1 than other lentil genotypes. AMF treatment significantly increased growth and biomass accumulation in lentil compared to that in non-AMF plants. Furthermore, AMF effectively reduced the As concentrations in roots and shoots of lentil plants grown at 8 and 45 mgkg-1 As-contaminated soils. This study revealed remarkable divergence in As accumulation among different BARI-released lentil genotypes; however, AMF could reduce As uptake and mitigate As-induced phyto-toxicity in lentil. Taken together, our results suggest a great potential of AMF in mitigating As transfer in root and shoot mass and reallocation to grains, which would expand lentil cultivation in As-affected areas throughout the world."

https://openalex.org/W2945776643,"The Middle-to-Upper Paleolithic transition in Europe covers the last millennia of Neanderthal life together with the appearance and expansion of Modern Human populations. Culturally, it is defined by the Late Middle Paleolithic succession, and by Early Upper Paleolithic complexes like the Châtelperronian (southwestern Europe), the Protoaurignacian, and the Early Aurignacian. Up to now, the southern boundary for the transition has been established as being situated between France and Iberia, in the Cantabrian façade and Pyrenees. According to this, the central and southern territories of Iberia are claimed to have been the refuge of the last Neanderthals for some additional millennia after they were replaced by anatomically Modern Humans on the rest of the continent. In this paper, we present the Middle-to-Upper Paleolithic transition sequence from Cova Foradada (Tarragona), a cave on the Catalan Mediterranean coastline. Archaeological research has documented a stratigraphic sequence containing a succession of very short-term occupations pertaining to the Châtelperronian, Early Aurignacian, and Gravettian. Cova Foradada therefore represents the southernmost Châtelperronian–Early Aurignacian sequence ever documented in Europe, significantly enlarging the territorial distribution of both cultures and providing an important geographical and chronological reference for understanding Neanderthal disappearance and the complete expansion of anatomically Modern Humans."
https://openalex.org/W2946513519,"The OTOF gene (Locus: DFNB9), encoding otoferlin, is reported to be one of the major causes of non-syndromic recessive sensorineural hearing loss, and is also reported to be the most common cause of non-syndromic recessive auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD). In the present study, we performed OTOF mutation analysis using massively parallel DNA sequencing (MPS). The purpose of this study was to reveal the frequency and precise genetic and clinical background of OTOF-related hearing loss in a large hearing loss population. A total of 2,265 Japanese sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) patients compatible with autosomal recessive inheritance (including sporadic cases) from 53 otorhinolaryngology departments nationwide participated in this study. The mutation analysis of 68 genes, including the OTOF gene, reported to cause non-syndromic hearing loss was performed using MPS. Thirty-nine out of the 2,265 patients (1.72%) carried homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the OTOF gene. It is assumed that the frequency of hearing loss associated with OTOF mutations is about 1.72% of autosomal recessive or sporadic SNHL cases. Hearing level information was available for 32 of 39 patients with biallelic OTOF mutations; 24 of them (75.0%) showed profound hearing loss, 7 (21.9%) showed severe hearing loss and 1 (3.1%) showed mild hearing loss. The hearing level of patients with biallelic OTOF mutations in this study was mostly severe to profound, which is consistent with the results of past reports. Eleven of the 39 patients with biallelic OTOF mutations had been diagnosed with ANSD. The genetic diagnosis of OTOF mutations has significant benefits in terms of clinical decision-making. Patients with OTOF mutations would be good candidates for cochlear implantation; therefore, the detection of OTOF mutations is quite beneficial for patients, especially for those with ANSD."

Its unique properties are central to the functions of essential biopolymers, like proteins (side chains of specific amino acids) and nucleic acids (the bases), as well as low-molecular-weight metabolites and signaling messengers. Their stability relative to other organic molecules also poses paradoxical challenges to the cell: catalyzing reactions that allow their utilization, appropriate modification, and proper incorporation into macromolecular building blocks on the one hand and the prevention of the accumulation of versions that can be toxic on the other hand. As part of this cellular management of compounds with aromatic rings, diverse molecular mechanisms have evolved for their opening and catabolism. Enzymes involved in the breakage of aromatic rings act via oxidative ring activation, resulting in cleavage at an intradiol bond (class I) or an extradiol bond (class II), or in some cases independently of a diol (class III) (Fig. 1A) (1Vaillancourt F.H.

Extradiol bond-cleaving enzyme superfamilies catalyze ring breakage assisted by a coordinated metal ion and display at least three unrelated protein folds: 1) the vicinal oxygen chelate dioxygenase superfamily of the glyoxalase fold (type I extradiol dioxygenases); 2) the protocatechuate dioxygenase (PCAD) 4The abbreviations used are: PCADprotocatechuate dioxygenaseSAMS-adenosylmethioninePNPpurine nucleoside phosphorylasePBDperiplasmic-binding protein/chelatase fold domainPDBProtein Data BankAPD2-aminophenol 1,6-dioxygenaseLUCALast Universal Common AncestorTMtransmembranel-DOPA3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanineHGThorizontal gene transferPCAprotocatechuateTATtwin-arginine translocation2,3-PCDprotocatechuate 2,3-dioxygenasePGApoly-γ-glutamatewHTHwinged helix–turn–helixPQQpyrroloquinoline quinoneIPPisopentenyl diphosphatePBPperiplasmic-binding protein. superfamily of the phosphorylase/peptidyl hydrolase fold (type II); and 3) the cupin family dioxygenases of the double-stranded β-helix fold (type III).

The type II extradiol dioxygenases of the PCAD superfamily share a common fold with catalytically unrelated clades of enzymes, namely the nucleosidase/nucleoside phosphorylases (PNP) and a diverse assemblage of peptidyl/amidohydrolases (6Murzin A.G.

The PCAD domains further show close structural and sequence affinities with the Memo family (7Qiu C. Lienhard S. Hynes N.E. Badache A. Leahy D.J.

Biodegradative Bacteria: How Bacteria Degrade, Survive, Adapt, and Evolve. Springer, Tokyo2014: 207-226Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar), an understanding of their total evolutionary history is generally lacking. To reconcile these findings with the role of the poorly-understood Memo and to better understand the internal relationships and the provenance of the PCAD–Memo superfamily, we initiated a comprehensive comparative genomic analysis. In our analysis, we sought to specifically address certain lacunae in the current literature, including 1) phyletic distributions of the PCAD clades based on complete genome sequences; 2) superfamily-wide substrate specialization along with prediction of novel pathways; 3) the extent of the dispersal of aromatic degradation pathways across organisms; 4) the origin, inter-family evolutionary relationships of the PCAD enzymes and the higher-order relationships with the Memo domain. Through these analyses, we elucidated the evolutionary history of the unified superfamily, observing that the PCAD dioxygenases likely descended from the more ancient Memo-like clade, which in turn descends via a single circular permutation event of the protein fold from a PNP-peptidyl/amidohydrolase-like prototype with which they share a similarly located active-site pocket. This history establishes that the shift to a dedicated aromatic ring opening function likely happened only after the PCAD clade had diverged from the Memo-like clade. These observations open novel avenues of investigation into the precise molecular function of Memo, which remains poorly-understood despite increasing experimental evidence in the last decade linking it to various human diseases. Additionally, this analysis presents the first comprehensive comparative genomic account of the aromatic ring-opening dioxygenases of the PCAD superfamily, reporting a range of known and newly-predicted substrates as well as structural features influencing substrate recognition and likely processing efficiency. Finally, we report the discovery of a previously-unrecognized family in the PCAD superfamily present across the Actinobacteria, which, although likely an enzymatically inactive version of the superfamily domain, appears to function in the synthesis of a metabolite derived from a modified nucleotide. To collect members of the PCAD–Memo superfamily, we initiated iterative sensitive sequence-based similarity searches using known members of the PCAD superfamily as seeds (see under “Experimental procedures”). Searches were run until convergence; sequences retrieved with borderline statistical significance (e-values between 0.01 and 0.001) were used as seeds in new searches to confirm membership in the superfamily. As an example, a search initiated with a sequence from the AMMECR1 fusion family (accession number: WP_006301058.1) returns a 2-aminophenol 1,6-dioxygenase (APD) family member from Cupriavidus (accession number: AEI74584.1; e-value: 2e-26; iteration: 2), a Rv2728c-like family member from Mycobacterium sp. 141 (accession number: WP_019969303.1; e-value: 9e-22; iteration: 2), a classical Memo family member from Arabidopsis thaliana (accession number: NP_565590.1; e-value 5e-04; iteration: 2), and a YgiD family member from Magnaporthe oryzae (accession number: ELQ40968.1; e-value: 3e-04; iteration: 3). Similarly, we initiated structural similarity searches using known crystal structures as seeds (see under “Experimental procedures”). These searches retrieved increasingly distant members of the PCAD dioxygenase-Memo superfamily relative to the starting structure, followed by other structures belonging to the phosphorylase/peptidyl hydrolase fold, namely the purine nucleoside phosphorylases (PNP superfamily). For example, a structure-based homology search initiated with a crystal structure from the classical LigB family (PDB code 1B4U_B) first returns other PCAD structures (examples: 3VSH_D, z-score: 24.5; 2PW6_A, z-score: 19.2), then Memo family structures (example: 3BD0_A, z-score 15.3), and then PNP and peptidyl/amidohydrolase structures (example: 1TCV_A, z-score: 5.8). A search initiated with a Memo family member (PDB code 3BCZ_A) first detects other Memo structures and then detects various PCAD structures (examples: 5HEE_A, z-score: 19.0; 1B4U_B, z-score 15.3; 2PW6_A, z-score: 14.5), before finally detecting PNP and peptidyl/amidohydrolase structures (example: 1TCV_A, z-score 6.5). The collected PCAD complement of 6619 sequences was subject to clustering analyses to gain insight into the distinct families composing the superfamily (see “Experimental procedures”) (22Heger A. Holm L. Towards a covering set of protein family profiles.Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2000; 73 (11063778): 321-33710.1016/S0079-6107(00)00013-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In total, clustering by BLASTCLUST identified 15 clearly-delineable families in the PCAD–Memo superfamily, which, in accordance with the structure search results, revealed a fundamental divide between the PCAD and Memo clades of the superfamily. Five families were found to belong to the Memo clade, and nine clearly fell into the PCAD clade, and a single family falling into the PCAD clade in the sequence similarity network (Fig. 1, B and C), but not strongly associating with either clade in the BLASTCLUST analysis. The relationships among these families and the sparseness of experimentally-characterized versions are shown in a sequence similarity network depicted in Fig. 1. To provide context for a study of the natural history of the PCAD–Memo superfamily, we analyzed the above-collected complement of PCAD–Memo-solved structures and retrieved sequences to define the essential core of the domain and to catalog the complete range of structure and sequence variations. Table 1 presents the summary of the conserved and variable features identified across the superfamily, and these are further discussed below.Table 1Capital letters in column headers denote residues conserved across the superfamily, provided in linear order of appearance relative to core structural elements Open table in a new tab The core fold of the PCAD–Memo superfamily is a α/β three-layered sandwich with eight conserved strands forming a central β-sheet. There are seven conserved helices that sandwich the central sheet with two in one layer and five in the opposite layer (Fig. 2A). Comparison of the solved structures alongside multiple sequence alignments constructed for the families currently lacking any structure revealed three loop regions that consistently exhibit structural variation, and we hereafter refer to them as variable regions 1–3 (VR1–3; see below, Fig. 2A, and Table 1). Another region occasionally displaying variability across individual families is the “dimerization” loop between strand 2 (S2) and strand 3 (S3) and helix 6 (H6), which can sometimes “break” into two distinct elements (referred to as H6a and H6b in Table 1). Previous research on the PCAD–Memo superfamily had reported extensive sequence diversity between and within individual families (23Barry K.P. Ngu A. Cohn E.F. Cote J.M. Burroughs A.M. Gerbino J.P. Taylor E.A. Exploring allosteric activation of LigAB from Sphingobium sp. strain SYK-6 through kinetics, mutagenesis and computational studies.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2015; 567 (25562402): 35-4510.1016/j.abb.2014.12.019Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Our analysis suggests that despite this diversity, several key sequence positions are conserved across the superfamily (see alignment columns shaded in black with white lettering, denoted by an asterisk in Fig. 3, Table 1, and Fig. S1). In total, eight positions are well-conserved across all enzymatically-active families in the superfamily; mapping of these positions onto available structures indicates that these are closely associated with the conserved active-site pocket (Fig. 2 and Table 1). Three of these positions (Fig. 2A and Fig. 3), namely the histidines after S1 and S2 and the acidic residue or cysteine between H6 and H7, are residues coordinating the active-site metal ion (7Qiu C.

The histidine downstream of S6 is farther away from the coordinated metal but close to the substrate suggesting that it might contribute to aromatic substrate selectivity via π–π interactions (Figs. 2A and 3). Furthermore, the aromatic residue at the N terminus of H3 forms π–π interactions with both the above histidines coordinating the metal ion and may help maintain a delocalized π-cloud system for effective chelation (7Qiu C.

The remaining conserved residues either help position the above residues or maintain the active-site conformation through hydrogen bonding. These observations also indicate that the PCAD–Memo superfamily falls entirely in the range of sequence conservation in the face of structural variation that has been described for several other families of enzymatic protein domains (27Zhang D. Iyer L.M. Burroughs A.M. Aravind L. Resilience of biochemical activity in protein domains in the face of structural divergence.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2014; 26 (24952217): 92-10310.1016/j.sbi.2014.05.008Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The substrate is positioned within the active site via coordination interactions between the diol oxygens or a phenol oxygen and amino group nitrogen and the metal. This strongly suggests that the PCAD family is likely to be specific for substrates that contain an aromatic diol. The substrate is shielded from the solvent by elements of VR1 and sometimes VR3 or an additional subunit (e.g. LigA; see below) such that only the extradiol bond, which is cleaved, is exposed for attack by dioxygen. Beyond the above eight site residues closely associated with the active site, certain other well-conserved charged or polar positions were identified. Notable among these is a nearly absolutely-conserved aspartate residue in H5 (see column shaded in gray in Fig. 3, denoted by a caret symbol). While not extending into the active site itself, it appears to provide a stabilizing backbone contact that positions the loop between S6 and H5 as a “wall” delimiting one side of the active-site pocket (Fig. 3). The above-mentioned three structurally variable regions in the superfamily (Fig. 2) occur between S1 and H1 (VR1), S3 and H2 (VR2), and S6 and H5 (VR3) (Fig. 2A and Table 1). VR1 tends to be the shortest and often takes the form of a small helical segment. The most minimal version of this represents a unifying feature across families of the Memo clade (Table 1 and Fig. 2B). More complex versions occur in clades like the LigZ-like family and take the form of longer predicted α-helical inserts. VR2 tends to be structurally more diverse than VR1 (Table 1). It might range from a complete lack of an insert (the Rv2728c-like family), through relatively simple forms consisting of predicted extended loops (e.g. the PqqD-like fusion and LigZ families), to large inserts composed of multiple delineable secondary structure elements in several families. For instance, in the Memo family VR2 contains elements stacking with core elements (7Qiu C. Lienhard S. Hynes N.E. Badache A. Leahy D.J. Memo is homologous to nonheme iron dioxygenases and binds an ErbB2-derived phosphopeptide in its vestigial active site.J. Biol.

Solved structures for the APD and PF0612 (Table 1) provide an indication of the likely spatial positioning of the more elaborate VR2 inserts: in both cases, the VR2 inserts form a partial fourth layer to the core three-layered sandwich, stacking outside of the “forward” helical layer (Fig. 2B). The final variable region, VR3, typically forms or is predicted to form elongated loops"

However, the relationships between excitotoxicity, RBP function, and disease have not been explored. Here, using primary cortical and motor neurons, we found that excitotoxicity induced the translocation of select ALS-linked RBPs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm within neurons. RBPs affected by excitotoxicity included TAR DNA–binding protein 43 (TDP-43) and, most robustly, fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma (FUS/TLS or FUS). We noted that FUS is translocated through a calcium-dependent mechanism and that its translocation coincides with striking alterations in nucleocytoplasmic transport. Furthermore, glutamate-induced up-regulation of glutamate ionotropic receptor α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)–type subunit 2 (GRIA2) in neurons depended on FUS expression, consistent with a functional role for FUS in excitotoxic stress.

https://openalex.org/W2945682808,"Previous studies on athletes' cognitive functions have reported superior performance on tasks measuring attention and sensorimotor abilities. However, how types of sports training shapes cognitive profile remains to be further explored. In this study, we recruited elite athletes specialized in badminton (N = 35, female = 12) and volleyball (N = 29, female = 13), as well as healthy adult controls (N = 27, female = 17) who had not receive any regular sports training. All participants completed cognitive assessments on spatial attention, sensory memory, cognitive flexibility, motor inhibition, and the attention networks. The results showed that athletes generally showed superior performance on selective cognitive domains compared to healthy controls. Specifically, compared to the healthy control, volleyball players showed superior on iconic memory, inhibitory control of action, and attentional alerting, whereas badminton players showed advantages on iconic memory and basic processing speed. Overall, volleyball players outperformed badminton players on those tasks require stimulus-driven visual attention and motor inhibition, likely due to different training modalities and characteristics of specialty that involves even more complex cognitive processes. To conclude, our findings suggest cognitive plasticity may drive by sports training in team/individual sports expertise, manifesting cognitive profile in sport expertise with distinct training modalities."

PWID were interviewed at NSID and SDCF using a standardized questionnaire focused on drug consumption and risk behaviours. The national drug monitoring system RELIS was consulted to determine the frequency of cocaine/heroin use. Transmission clusters were analysed by phylogenetic analyses using approximate maximum-likelihood. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed on epidemiological data collected at NSID and SDCF to determine risk factors associated with cocaine use.From January 2013 to December 2017, 68 new diagnosis of HIV infection reported injecting drug use as the main risk of transmission at NSID. The proportion of female cases enrolled between 2013-2017 was higher than the proportion among cases enrolled prior to 2013. (33% vs 21%, p < 0.05). Fifty six viral sequences were obtained from the 68 PWID newly diagnosed for HIV. Two main transmission clusters were revealed: one HIV-1 subtype B cluster and one CRF14_BG cluster including 37 and 9 patients diagnosed since 2013, respectively. Interviews from 32/68 (47%) newly diagnosed PWID revealed that 12/32 (37.5%) were homeless and 27/32 (84.4%) injected cocaine. Increased cocaine injection was indeed reported by the RELIS participants from 53 to 63% in drug users with services contacts between 2012 and 2015, and from 5 to 22% in SDCF users between 2012 and 2016. Compared with PWID who injected only heroin (n = 63), PWID injecting cocaine and heroin (n = 107) were younger (mean of 38 vs 44 years, p≤0.001), reported more frequent piercing (≤0.001), shared and injected drugs more often (p≤0.01), and were more frequently HIV positive (p<0.05) at SDCF using univariate logistic regression analysis. Finally, in the multivariate analysis, use of heroin and cocaine was independently associated with younger age, piercing, sharing of drugs, and regular consumption (p<0.05).Injecting cocaine is a new trend of drug use in Luxembourg associated with HIV infection in this recent outbreak among PWID."
https://openalex.org/W2946400410,"Murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog (AKT) kinases target both cytosolic and nuclear substrates for phosphorylation. Whereas the cytosolic substrates are known to be closely associated with the regulation of apoptosis and autophagy or metabolism and protein synthesis, the nuclear substrates are, for the most part, poorly understood. To better define the role of nuclear AKT, potential AKT substrates were isolated from the nuclear lysates of leukemic cell lines using a phosphorylated AKT substrate antibody and identified in tandem mass spectrometry. Among the proteins identified was adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR)1p110, the predominant nuclear isoform of the adenosine deaminase acting on double-stranded RNA. Coimmunoprecipitation studies and in vitro kinase assays revealed that AKT-1, -2, and -3 interact with both ADAR1p110 and ADAR2 and phosphorylate these RNA editases. Using site-directed mutagenesis of suspected AKT phosphorylation sites, AKT was found to primarily phosphorylate ADAR1p110 and ADAR2 on T738 and T553, respectively, and overexpression of the phosphomimic mutants ADAR1p110 (T738D) and ADAR2 (T553D) resulted in a 50-100% reduction in editase activity. Thus, activation of AKT has a direct and major impact on RNA editing.-Bavelloni, A., Focaccia, E., Piazzi, M., Raffini, M., Cesarini, V., Tomaselli, S., Orsini, A., Ratti, S., Faenza, I., Cocco, L., Gallo, A., Blalock, W.

https://openalex.org/W2945929379,"Human population growth and anthropogenic activities are exacerbating pressures on biodiversity globally. Land conversion is aggravating habitat fragmentation and non-human primates are increasingly compelled to live in forest-agricultural mosaics. In Sierra Leone, more than half of the wild chimpanzee population (Pan troglodytes verus) occurs outside protected areas and competes for resources with farmers. Our study area, in the Moyamba district in south-western Sierra Leone, is practically devoid of forest and is dominated by cultivated and fallow fields, swamps and mangroves. In this region, traditional slash-and-burn agriculture modifies annually the landscape, sparing swamps and mangroves and semi-domesticated oil palms (Elaeis guineensis). This study aimed to explore ecological and anthropogenic factors influencing chimpanzee relative abundance across this highly degraded and human-impacted landscape. Between 2015 and 2016, we deployed 24 camera traps systematically across 27 1.25x1.25 km grid cells. Cameras were operational over a period of 8 months. We used binomial iCAR models to examine to what extent anthropogenic (roads, settlements, abandoned settlements and human presence) and habitat variables (swamps, farmland and mangroves) shape chimpanzee relative abundance. The best model explained 43.16% of the variation with distance to roads and swamps emerging as the best predictors of chimpanzee relative abundance. Our results suggest that chimpanzees avoid roads and prefer to maintain proximity to swamps. There was no significant effect of settlements, abandoned settlements, mangroves or human presence. It appears that chimpanzees do not avoid areas frequented by people; although, our findings suggest temporal avoidance between the two species. We highlight the importance of studying chimpanzee populations living in anthropogenic habitats like agricultural-swamp matrixes to better understand factors influencing their distribution and inform conservation planning outside protected areas."
https://openalex.org/W2945667030,"Short bowel syndrome (SBS) presents an increasing problem in pediatrics. SBS often results from surgical resection of necrotic bowel following necrotizing enterocolitis or treatment of anatomic gastrointestinal defects. SBS is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and creates substantial burdens for patients, families, and the health system. Recent reports have demonstrated that the fecal microbiome of children with SBS is significantly different from healthy control and severe intestinal microbial imbalances is associated with poor growth. We hypothesized that children with SBS and adverse clinical features such as PN dependent, shorter bowel length and lack of ileocecal valve would demonstrate more gut dysbiosis compare with the SBS non-PN dependent. An improved understanding of SBS pathogenesis would enhance management and potentially suggest new interventions. We studied microbial communities of SBS and control non-SBS patients from the jejunum, obtained endoscopically or by ostomy aspiration, and stool. We enrolled SBS patients who did and did not require parenteral nutrition (PN), as a surrogate marker for the seriousness of their disease. We studied the microbiota using high-throughput DNA sequencing of 16S rRNA genes and statistical analyses. We found that microbial diversity was significantly greater in jejunal aspirate than in stool samples in SBS patients, unlike non-SBS patients; that SBS patients receiving enteral feeds had greater diversity, and that SBS patients on PN and enteral feeds had lower differences in diversity in jejunal vs. stool samples. We found a trend toward increased diversity in patients with an intact ileocecal valve, and found that certain taxa were more abundant in the certain sample types, and in SBS patients vs. non-SBS patients. SBS patients have lower microbial diversity, especially patients with more severe disease, patients requiring PN, and those lacking an ileocecal valve. SBS patients, particularly those with more complex characteristics, exhibit differences in their intestinal microbiota. Particular individual taxa were over- and under-represented in patients with more unfavorable disease. While diminished diversity and alterations in microbiota composition are likely consequences of SBS, future efforts aimed at increasing microbial diversity and interventions targeting specific microbiota characteristics might constitute a testable approach to ameliorate some clinical SBS clinical consequences."

More recent studies have shown that, in addition to HIFα, PHD3 has also other substrates. Moreover, pHD3 is believed to act as a tumor suppressor, but the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that PHD3 stabilizes p53 in a hydroxylase-independent manner. We found that PHD3 overexpression increases and PHD3 knockdown decreases p53 levels. Mechanistically, PHD3 bound MDM2 proto-oncogene (MDM2) and prevented MDM2 from interacting with p53, thereby inhibiting MDM2-mediated p53 degradation. Interestingly, we found that PHD3 overexpression could enhance p53 in the presence of the prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor dimethyloxalylglycine, and the prolyl hydroxylase activity-deficient variant PHD3-H196A also inhibited the p53-MDM2 interaction and stabilized p53. Genetic ablation of PHD3 decreased p53 protein levels in mice intestinal epithelial cells, but a genetic knockin of PHD3-H196A did not affect p53 protein levels in vivo. These results suggest that the prolyl hydroxylase activity of PHD3 is dispensable for its ability to stabilize p53. We found that both PHD3 and PHD3-H196A suppress the expression of the stem cell-associated gene NANOG and inhibited the properties of colon cancer stem cells through p53.

https://openalex.org/W2946519292,"Adequate supply of choline, an essential nutrient, is necessary to support proper brain development. Whether prenatal choline availability plays a role in development of the visual system is currently unknown. In this study, we addressed the role of in utero choline supply for the development and later function of the retina in a mouse model. We lowered choline availability in the maternal diet during pregnancy and assessed proliferative and differentiation properties of retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) in the developing prenatal retina, as well as visual function in adult offspring. We report that low choline availability during retinogenesis leads to persistent retinal cytoarchitectural defects, ranging from focal lesions with displacement of retinal neurons into subretinal space to severe hypocellularity and ultrastructural defects in photoreceptor organization. We further show that low choline availability impairs timely differentiation of retinal neuronal cells, such that the densities of early-born retinal ganglion cells, amacrine and horizontal cells, as well as cone photoreceptor precursors, are reduced in low choline embryonic d 17.5 retinas. Maintenance of higher proportions of RPCs that fail to exit the cell cycle underlies aberrant neuronal differentiation in low choline embryos. Increased RPC cell cycle length, and associated reduction in neurofibromin 2/Merlin protein, an upstream regulator of the Hippo signaling pathway, at least in part, explain aberrant neurogenesis in low choline retinas. Furthermore, we find that animals exposed to low choline diet in utero exhibit a significant degree of intraindividual variation in vision, characterized by marked functional discrepancy between the 2 eyes in individual animals. Together, our findings demonstrate, for the first time, that choline availability plays an essential role in the regulation of temporal progression of retinogenesis and provide evidence for the importance of adequate supply of choline for proper development of the visual system.-Trujillo-Gonzalez, I., Friday, W.

https://openalex.org/W2945616063,"A nonreceptive uterus is a major cause of embryo implantation failure. This study examined the importance of the Gαq/11-coupled class of GPCRs as regulators of uterine receptivity. Mice were created lacking uterine Gαq and Gα11; as a result, signaling by all uterine Gαq/11-coupled receptors was disrupted. Reproductive profiling of the knockout females revealed that on d 4 of pregnancy, despite adequate serum progesterone (P4) levels and normal P4 receptor (PR) expression, there was no evidence of PR signaling. This resulted in the down-regulation of heart and neural crest derivatives expressed 2, Kruppel-like factor 15, and cyclin G1 and the subsequent persistent proliferation of the luminal epithelium. Aquaporin (Aqp) 11 was also potently down-regulated, whereas Aqp5/AQP5 expression persisted, resulting in the inhibition of luminal closure. Hypertrophy of the myometrial longitudinal muscle was also dramatically diminished, likely contributing to the observed implantation failure. Further analyses revealed that a major mechanism via which uterine Gαq/11 signaling induces PR signaling is through the transcriptional up-regulation of leucine-rich repeat-containing GPCR 4 (Lgr4). LGR4 was previously identified as a trigger of PR activation and signaling. Overall, this study establishes that Gαq/11 signaling, in a P4-dependent manner, critically regulates the acquisition of uterine receptivity in the female mouse, and disruption of such signaling results in P4 resistance.-de Oliveira, V., Schaefer, J., Calder, M., Lydon, J.

https://openalex.org/W2945895257,"We present a study of the dimensionality and factorial invariance of religiosity for 26 countries with a Christian heritage, based on the 1998 and 2008 rounds of the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) Religion survey, using both exploratory and multi-group confirmatory factor analyses. The results of the exploratory factor analysis showed that three factors, common to Christian and religiously unaffiliated respondents, could be extracted from our initially selected items and suggested the testing of four different three-factor models using multi-group confirmatory factor analysis. For the model with the best fit and measurement invariance properties, we labeled the three resulting factors as “Beliefs in afterlife and miracles”, “Belief and importance of God” and “Religious involvement.” The first factor is measured by four items related to the Supernatural Beliefs Scale (SBS-6); the second by three items related to belief in God and God’s perceived roles as a supernatural agent; and the third one by three items with the same structure found in previous cross-cultural analyses of religiosity using the European Values Survey (ESS) and also by belief in God. Unexpectedly, we found that one item, belief in God, cross-loaded on to the second and third factors. We discussed possible interpretations for this finding, together with the potential limitations of the ISSP Religion questionnaire for revealing the structure of religiosity. Our tests of measurement invariance across gender, age, educational degree and religious (un)affiliation led to acceptance of the hypotheses of metric- and scalar-invariance for these groupings (units of analysis). However, in the measurement invariance tests across the countries, the criteria for metric invariance were met for twenty-three countries only, and partial scalar invariance was accepted for fourteen countries only. The present work shows that the exploration of large multinational and cross-cultural datasets for studying the dimensionality and invariance of social constructs (in our case, religiosity) yields useful results for cross-cultural comparisons, but is also limited by the structure of these datasets and the way specific items are coded."

Numerous factors regulate ENaC activity, including extracellular ligands, post-translational modifications, and membrane-resident lipids. However, ENaC regulation by bile acids and conjugated bilirubin, metabolites that are abundant in the biliary tree and intestinal tract and are sometimes elevated in the urine of individuals with advanced liver disease, remains poorly understood. Here, using a Xenopus oocyte-based system to express and functionally study ENaC, we found that, depending on the bile acid used, bile acids both activate and inhibit mouse ENaC. Whether bile acids were activating or inhibiting was contingent on the position and orientation of specific bile acid moieties. For example, a hydroxyl group at the 12-position and facing the hydrophilic side (12α-OH) was activating. Taurine-conjugated bile acids, which have reduced membrane permeability, affected ENaC activity more strongly than did their more membrane-permeant unconjugated counterparts, suggesting that bile acids regulate ENaC extracellularly. Bile acid–dependent activation was enhanced by amino acid substitutions in ENaC that depress open probability and was precluded by proteolytic cleavage that increases open probability, consistent with an effect of bile acids on ENaC open probability. Bile acids also regulated ENaC in a cortical collecting duct cell line, mirroring the results in Xenopus oocytes. We also show that bilirubin conjugates activate ENaC.

ENaC is a heterotrimer composed of α, β, and γ subunits. Each subunit contributes two transmembrane helices to a single pore, with the bulk of each subunit contained in the extracellular domains (25Noreng S. Bharadwaj A. Posert R. Yoshioka C. Baconguis I.

Gating regulation by extracellular factors is emblematic of this protein family. Numerous studies have identified sites and structures key to regulation by extracellular factors (27Kashlan O.B. Kleyman T.R. ENaC structure and function in the wake of a resolved structure of a family member.Am. J. Physiol.

Here we examined the molecular determinants of ENaC regulation by amphipathic compounds found in bile. We found that specific bile acids regulate mouse ENaC, both heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes and endogenously expressed in a mouse cortical collecting duct cell line (mpkCCDc14). When systematically screening bile acids, we found that both channel activation and inhibition were associated with specific moieties and that neither activation nor inhibition depended on membrane permeability. We also found that conjugates of bilirubin activated ENaC. Other known modes of ENaC regulation, including proteolytic processing, influenced bile acid activation of the channel. Deoxycholic acid (DCA) robustly activated uncleaved channels, which have a low basal open probability (Po), whereas DCA and taurocholic acid (t-CA) failed to activate fully cleaved channels, which have a high Po. Our data suggest that biliary factors may be natural ligands for the channel and bind to the extracellular side of the channel to influence its Po. It has previously been reported that bile acids activate human and rat ENaC, ASIC1, and BASIC expressed in Xenopus oocytes (6Wiemuth D. Lefèvre C.M. Heidtmann H. Gründer S. Bile acids increase the activity of the epithelial Na+ channel.Pflugers Arch. 2014; 466 (24292109): 1725-173310.1007/s00424-013-1403-0Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 7Ilyaskin A.V.

Here, we investigated bile acid regulation of mouse ENaC, which has been extensively studied and is relevant in key model systems. We expressed WT mouse α, β, and γ subunits in oocytes and measured the effect of 1 mm DCA, cholic acid (CA), chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), and hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA) (Fig. 1A) on whole-cell currents by two-electrode voltage clamp (TEVC). We found that bile acids enhanced ENaC currents in the order DCA > CA > CDCA and that HDCA inhibited ENaC currents (Fig. 1B). Bile acid regulation of ENaC currents occasionally demonstrated oocyte batch dependence (note the bimodal distribution of CA data), suggesting that differences in protein biosynthesis may influence bile acid regulation. DCA activation was dose-dependent, with evident activation at 10 μm DCA and more than half-maximal activation at 100 μm DCA (Fig. 1C). Because bilirubin conjugated to glucuronic acid (c-bilirubin) is also a major bile component, we determined whether c-bilirubin activates ENaC (Fig. 2A). Bilirubin conjugation allows for aqueous phase excretion of the heme catabolite into bile. We found that c-bilirubin reversibly activated ENaC and that activation was dose-dependent (Fig. 2, B and C). ENaC activation by c-bilirubin required higher doses than DCA for equivalent increases in current and did not saturate even at 5 mm c-bilirubin (Figs. 1C and 2C). To test whether ENaC activation depended on the opened porphyrin ring of bilirubin or the glucuronide moieties introduced by conjugation, we tested the ability of taurine-conjugated bilirubin to activate the channel (t-bilirubin; Fig. 2A). We found that t-bilirubin activated ENaC more potently than c-bilirubin did (Fig. 2, B and C). These data suggest that bilirubin itself mediates activation of ENaC by c-bilirubin and t-bilirubin. Taken together, our data show that specific biliary factors activate mouse ENaC expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Schmidt et al. (28Schmidt A. Löhrer D. Alsop R.J. Lenzig P. Oslender-Bujotzek A. Wirtz M.

Palmitoylation (post-translational modification by hydrophobic palmitate) of the ENaC β and γ subunits has been proposed to activate ENaC through an analogous mechanism (29Mueller G.M. Maarouf A.B.

ENaC β and γ subunits are palmitoylated at specific intracellular cysteine residues (βCys-43, βCys-557, γCys-33, and γCys-41), and mutating these sites to alanine prevents palmitoylation. We hypothesized that DCA could activate ENaC through a similar mechanism and that there might be overlap between the two modes of regulation. We expressed ENaC subunits with all four palmitoylation sites mutated to alanine (ENaCΔP) in oocytes and tested whether mutation affected activation by DCA (Fig. 3). We found that removing all four palmitoylation sites potentiated DCA activation of ENaC currents by 7.5-fold (Fig. 3C). We also tested ENaCs lacking palmitoylation sites in only the β (βΔP) or γ (γΔP) subunits (Fig. 3). We found that γΔP recapitulated the effect of removing all four sites, whereas βΔP had an intermediate effect. When we mutated individual palmitoylation sites, we found the greatest effects at the N-terminal palmitoylation sites flanking a highly conserved His-Gly sequence. These results suggest that palmitoylation affects ENaC regulation by DCA. Preventing ENaC palmitoylation may have affected DCA activation through overlapping mechanisms of activation (i.e. by enhancing membrane association of key intracellular structures). Alternatively, preventing palmitoylation may simply reduce the channel’s basal Po, leaving greater potential for activation (note the lower basal currents in Fig. 3B). We tested the ability of DCA to activate channels forced into a low-Po state through an independent mechanism: by preventing ENaC cleavage. ENaC α and γ subunits each undergo double cleavage that releases autoinhibitory tracts (31Hughey R.P. Mueller G.M. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L. Poland P.A. Harkleroad K.L. Carattino M.D. Kleyman T.R.

Mutating the furin sites in the α and the γ subunits (ENaCΔF: αR205A,R231AβγR143A) prevents cleavage by furin but leaves channels susceptible to cleavage by less stringent proteases like trypsin (33Carattino M.D. Sheng S.

We also found that preventing cleavage greatly increased activation by DCA as compared with WT (Fig. 4C), similar to the effect of preventing palmitoylation. We then measured the effect of DCA activation before and after trypsin activation (Fig. 5A). As before, DCA activated ENaC currents, and the effect was reversible (Fig. 5A, DCA #1). Trypsin addition (2 μg/ml) irreversibly activated ENaC currents, consistent with cleavage. However, subsequent DCA addition (DCA #2) failed to activate currents further. Notably, trypsin activation was comparable with the first DCA activation. We confirmed these results by testing channels lacking autoinhibitory tracts in the α and γ subunits (ENaCΔI: αΔ206–231βγΔ144–186). Channels lacking both tracts have a high open probability (39Carattino M.D. Hughey R.P. Kleyman T.R.

After removing trypsin from the bath, a second perfusion of 1 mm DCA was applied (DCA #2), followed by 10 μm amiloride (amil).

The presence of restrictive respiratory disease may lead to uncoordinated action of the respiratory muscles which affects breathing pattern and chest wall volumes. The aim of this study was to evaluate chest wall volumes, chest wall asynchrony and inspiratory paradoxical movement of breathing, as well as the influence of the time of disease diagnosis in subjects with Parkinson’s disease and post-Stroke in comparison to healthy individuals. Methods Total and compartmental chest wall volumes, chest wall asynchrony and paradoxical movement were measured at rest in a seated position by Optoelectronic Plethysmography in 76 individuals (29 healthy individuals, 20 post-Stroke and 27 Parkinson’s disease subjects). Post-stroke and Parkinson’s disease subjects were also grouped according to the length of diagnosis. Results In both groups with restrictive respiratory disease we observed that pulmonary rib cage compartment (VRCp) volume is reduced when compared to healthy subjects (p <0.05). This same pattern was observed when analyzing post-stroke subjects with more than three years of diagnosis and Parkinson’s subjects with less than three years of diagnosis (p<0.05). Furthermore, post-stroke subjects with inspiratory paradoxical movement showed decreased total and compartmental chest wall volumes (p<0.05), while individuals with Parkinson’s disease with inspiratory paradoxical movement only presented a decrease in pulmonary rib cage compartment volume (p<0.05). Conclusion Our study presents new findings for better understanding of chest wall volumes and chest wall asynchrony in post-stroke and Parkinson’s disease individuals. Half of the subjects with post-Stroke and Parkinson’s disease presented inspiratory paradox movement, but changes in breathing pattern was especially observed in post-stroke subjects with more than three years of diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2945138065,"Progestin-only long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) are increasingly popular among women seeking contraception; however, recent epidemiological studies suggest that systemically administered medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) may increase HIV acquisition. In order to determine the exact mechanisms underlying increases in transmission specific to MPA use and to test safer, alternative contraceptive progestin types and delivery methods, in vitro modeling studies must be performed. To achieve this, it is imperative that accurate hormone concentrations be utilized when modeling progestin-mediated outcomes, as the down-stream effects are dose-dependent. The local concentrations of progestins to which the lower female genital tract tissues are exposed after initiation of LARCs are unknown, but they likely differ from peripheral concentrations, dependent upon the progestin type and delivery method. Here, we measured in vivo endocervical and plasma concentrations of (1) systemically-delivered depo MPA (DMPA), (2) levonorgestrel (LNG) delivered via intrauterine system (IUS) and (3) etonogestrel (ETG) delivered via vaginal ring in women who recently initiated contraception treatment. Levels of ETG and LNG in cervical secretions were 100–200 fold higher than plasma levels. In contrast, measurable MPA levels were approximately 10-fold higher in plasma compared to cervical secretions. These results will inform the design of accurate in vitro studies on the influence of progestins on epithelial cells, tissue explants, and peripheral blood cells, to be able to better predict in vivo outcomes. Subsequent observations will aid in determining how MPA might influence HIV acquisition and may facilitate identification of optimal progestin-containing LARC alternatives for women at high risk for HIV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2945829982,"Objective To investigate the effects of lifestyle-related factors on ischemic heart disease (IHD) according to body mass index (BMI) and fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels among Korean adults. Methods A total of 119,929 men and 89,669 women (from National Sample Cohort version 2.0, National Health Insurance Service) aged ≥20 years who were examined during 2003–2006 and had no preexisting type 2 diabetes or circulatory diseases were followed until December 2015 to confirm IHD incident cases. Data on lifestyle-related factors (BMI, FBG, diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity) were collected at baseline. Lifestyle-related risk factors were defined as mainly vegetable/mainly meat diet, former/current smoking, alcohol consumption ≥3 times/week, and no physical activity. Associations between these factors and IHD were examined using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results High BMI (≥25 kg/m2), high FBG (≥100 mg/dL), mainly meat diet, and former/current smoking were associated with increased risk for IHD. Alcohol consumption ≤twice/week and physical activity ≤twice/week were associated with lower risk of IHD. With increased lifestyle-related risk factors, the risk of IHD also increased in women (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.18–4.73) and men (HR = 1.66, 95% CI 1.48–1.85). This increase was larger in women, with a significant sex interaction (p = 0.0001). Significant interactions between BMI and alcohol consumption (p = 0.0002) and between BMI and physical activity (p = 0.0063) were observed. Interactions were seen between FBG level and meal type in both BMI<25 kg/m2 (p = 0.0106) and BMI≥25 kg/m2 (p = 0.0281) and between FBG level and alcohol consumption in BMI ≥25 kg/m2 (p = 0.0118). Conclusions The impact of lifestyle-related factors on IHD was more pronounced in women than in men and may be modified by BMI and FBG level among Korean adults. This might be taken into account when planning individual interventions to reduce IHD risk."
https://openalex.org/W2951895968,"Anthropogenic pressures, such as contaminant exposure, may affect stable isotope ratios in biota. These changes are driven by alterations in the nutrient allocation and metabolic pathways induced by specific stressors. In a controlled microcosm study with the amphipod Gammarus spp., we studied effects of the β-blocker propranolol on stable isotope signatures (δ15N and δ13C), elemental composition (%C and %N), and growth (protein content and body size) as well as biomarkers of oxidative status (antioxidant capacity, ORAC; lipid peroxidation, TBARS) and neurological activity (acetylcholinesterase, AChE). Based on the known effects of propranolol exposure on cellular functions, i.e., its mode of action (MOA), we expected to observe a lower scope for growth, accompanied by a decrease in protein deposition, oxidative processes and AChE inhibition, with a resulting increase in the isotopic signatures. The observed responses in growth, biochemical and elemental variables supported most of these predictions. In particular, an increase in %N was observed in the propranolol exposures, whereas both protein allocation and body size declined. Moreover, both ORAC and TBARS levels decreased with increasing propranolol concentration, with the decrease being more pronounced for TBARS, which indicates the prevalence of the antioxidative processes. These changes resulted in a significant increase of the δ15N and δ13C values in the propranolol-exposed animals compared to the control. These findings suggest that MOA of β-blockers may be used to predict sublethal effects in non-target species, including inhibited AChE activity, improved oxidative balance, and elevated stable isotope ratios. The latter also indicates that metabolism-driven responses to environmental contaminants can alter stable isotope signatures, which should be taken into account when interpreting trophic interactions in the food webs."
https://openalex.org/W2952498883,"This study examines the post-ingestive fate of two host-plant derived small-molecule phenolics (the acetophenones piceol and pungenol) that have previously been shown to be toxic to the outbreaking forest pest, spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana). We test first whether these compounds are transformed during passage through the midgut, and second whether the budworm upregulates activity of the detoxification enzyme glutathione-s-transferase (GST) in response to feeding on these compounds. Insects were reared on either foliage or artificial diet to the fourth instar, when they were transferred individually to one of two treatment diets, either control or phenolic-laced, for approximately 10 days, after which midguts were dissected out and used for Bradford soluble protein and GST enzyme activity analysis. Frass was collected and subjected to HPLC-DAD-MS. HPLC showed that the acetophenones do not autoxidize under midgut pH conditions, but that glucose- and glutathione- conjugates are present in the frass of insects fed the phenolic-laced diet. GST enzyme activity increases in insects fed the phenolic-laced diet, in both neutral pH and alkaline assays. These data show that the spruce budwom exhibits counter-adaptations to plant phenolics similar to those seen in angiosperm feeders, upregulating an important detoxifying enzyme (GST) and partially conjugating these acetophenones prior to elimination, but that these counter-measures are not totally effective at mitigating toxic effects of the ingested compounds in the context of our artifical-diet based laboratory experiment."
https://openalex.org/W2945324128,"The chemically-rich seaweed Galaxaura is not only highly competitive with corals, but also provides substrate for other macroalgae. Its ecology and associated epiphytes remain largely unexplored. To fill this knowledge gap, we undertook an ecological assessment to explore the spatial variation, temporal dynamics, and diversity of epiphytic macroalgae of Galaxaura divaricata on patch reefs in the lagoon of Dongsha Atoll, a shallow coral reef ecosystem in the northern South China Sea that has been repeatedly impacted by mass coral bleaching events.Twelve spatially independent patch reefs in the Dongsha lagoon were first surveyed to assess benthic composition in April 2016, and then revisited to determine G. divaricata cover in September 2017, with one additional Galaxaura-dominated reef (site 9). Four surveys over a period of 17 months were then carried out on a degraded patch reef site to assess the temporal variation in G. divaricata cover. Epiphytic macroalgae associated with G. divaricata were quantified and identified through the aid of DNA barcoding at this degraded site.Patch reefs in the Dongsha lagoon were degraded, exhibiting relatively low coral cover (5-43%), but high proportions of macroalgae (13-58%) and other substrate (rubble and dead corals; 23-69%). The distribution of G. divaricata was heterogeneous across the lagoon, with highest abundance (16-41%) in the southeast area. Temporal surveys showed consistently high covers (mean ± SD = 16.9 ± 1.21%) of G. divaricata for 17 months. Additional photographic evidence suggested that overgrowth of G. divaricata can persist for 3.5 years. Yet, G. divaricata provides substrate to other macroalgae (e.g., Lobophora sp.) that also limit the growth of corals.Our study demonstrates that an allelopathic seaweed, such as G. divaricata, can overgrow degraded coral reefs for extended periods of time. By providing habitat for other harmful macroalgae, a prolonged Galaxaura overgrowth could further enhance the spread of macroalgae, and strengthen negative feedback loops, decreasing the recovery potential of degraded reefs."
https://openalex.org/W2945028502,"The J-domain protein Zuotin is a multi-domain eukaryotic Hsp70 co-chaperone. Though it is primarily ribosome-associated, positioned at the exit of the 60S subunit tunnel where it promotes folding of nascent polypeptide chains, Zuotin also has off-ribosome functions. Domains of Zuotin needed for 60S association and interaction with Hsp70 are conserved in eukaryotes. However, whether the 4-helix bundle (4HB) domain is conserved remains an open question. We undertook evolutionary and structural approaches to clarify this issue. We found that the 4HB segment of human Zuotin also forms a bundle of 4 helices. The positive charge of Helix I, which in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is responsible for interaction with the 40S subunit, is particularly conserved. However, the C-termini of fungal and human 4HBs are not similar. In fungi the C-terminal segment forms a plug that folds back into the bundle; in S. cerevisiae it plays an important role in bundle stability and, off the ribosome, in transcriptional activation. In human, C-terminal helix IV of the 4HB is extended, protruding from the bundle. This extension serves as a linker to the regulatory SANT domains, which are present in animals, plants and protists, but not fungi. Further analysis of Zuotin sequences revealed that the plug likely arose as a result of genomic rearrangement upon SANT domain loss early in the fungal lineage. In the lineage leading to S. cerevisiae, the 4HB was subjected to positive selection with the plug becoming increasingly hydrophobic. Eventually, these hydrophobic plug residues were coopted for a novel regulatory function-activation of a recently emerged transcription factor, Pdr1. Our data suggests that Zuotin evolved off-ribosome functions twice-once involving SANT domains, then later in fungi, after SANT domain loss, by coopting the hydrophobic plug. Zuotin serves as an example of complex intertwining of molecular chaperone function and cell regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2946056231,"Mesoderm development is a finely tuned process initiated by the differentiation of pluripotent epiblast cells. Serine/threonine kinase 40 (STK40) controls the development of several mesoderm-derived cell types, its overexpression induces differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) toward the extraembryonic endoderm, and Stk40 knockout (KO) results in multiple organ failure and is lethal at the perinatal stage in mice. However, molecular mechanisms underlying the physiological functions of STK40 in mesoderm differentiation remain elusive. Here, we report that Stk40 ablation impairs mesoderm differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, STK40 interacts with both the E3 ubiquitin ligase mammalian constitutive photomorphogenesis protein 1 (COP1) and the transcriptional regulator proto-oncogene c-Jun (c-JUN), promoting c-JUN protein degradation. Consequently, Stk40 knockout leads to c-JUN protein accumulation, which, in turn, apparently suppresses WNT signaling activity and impairs the mesoderm differentiation process. Overall, this study reveals that STK40, together with COP1, represents a previously unknown regulatory axis that modulates the c-JUN protein level within an appropriate range during mesoderm differentiation from mESCs. Our findings provide critical insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating the c-JUN protein level and may have potential implications for managing cellular disorders arising from c-JUN dysfunction.

https://openalex.org/W2944986089,"Background The specific research aims of this study included: 1) Conduct an epidemiologic analysis of recreational sports injuries among 1500 children, ages 5–11 in Florida: and 2) Utilize the computerized pediatric concussion tool from ImPACT Applications, Inc. for baseline and follow-up testing to better understand these injuries. This research followed a prospective surveillance design utilizing a large cohort of children, ages, 5–11, who play recreational football, soccer, and baseball/softball in Florida. The study venue was a large athletic facility in Hillsborough County, Florida. The sports observed were soccer (girls’ and boys’), baseball, softball, and football. Internal and external advisory boards were consulted throughout the study. Methods Certified Athletic Trainers (ATCs) were hired to use High School Reporting Information Online (RIO) for injuries and the Ipad-administered pediatric concussion tool developed by ImPACT Applications, Inc for baseline/follow-up concussion data. Results Over the course of the project, 26 RIO-reported injuries were reported. Football and soccer produced the greatest rate of injuries. There were 12 concussions which comprised nearly half of all the RIO injuries (46%). We conducted 882 baseline concussion tests and 13 follow-up tests over the 2 years. Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time data have been collected and reported on sports injuries in the study population. Future studies built on these findings will allow for the development of targeted guidelines and interventions for coaches, players, and parents so sports injury-related morbidity and mortality decrease in our youngest athletes."
https://openalex.org/W2945796351,"Liver serine-threonine kinase B1 (LKB1) is a tumor suppressor that has been linked to many types of tumors. However, the role of LKB1 in cartilaginous tumorigenesis is still poorly understood. In this study, we find that cartilage-specific, tamoxifen-inducible Lkb1 knockout results in multiple enchondroma-like lesions adjacent to the disorganized growth plates. We showed that chondrocytes retain an immature status caused by loss of Lkb1, which may lead to the dramatic expansion of growth-plate cartilage and the formation of enchondroma-like lesions. Additionally, increased mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activity is observed in the Lkb1 conditional knockout (cKO) chondrocytes, and rapamycin (mTORC1 inhibitor) treatment significantly alleviates the expansion of growth-plate cartilage and eliminates the enchondroma-like lesions in Lkb1 cKO mice. Thus, our findings indicate that loss of Lkb1 leads to the expansion of chondrocytes and the formation of enchondroma-like lesions during postnatal cartilage development, and that the up-regulated mTORC1-signaling pathway is implicated in this process. Our findings suggest that modulation of LKB1 and related signaling is a potential therapy in cartilaginous tumorigenesis.-Zhou, S., Li, Y., Qiao, L., Ge, Y., Huang, X., Gao, X., Ju, H., Wang, W., Zhang, J., Yan, J., Teng, H., Jiang, Q. Inactivation of Lkb1 in postnatal chondrocytes leads to epiphyseal growth-plate abnormalities and promotes enchondroma-like formation."

https://openalex.org/W2952155892,"Representations of the body and peripersonal space can be distorted for people with some chronic pain conditions. Experimental pain induction can give rise to similar, but transient distortions in healthy individuals. However, spatial and bodily representations are dynamic, and constantly update as we interact with objects in our environment. It is unclear whether induced pain disrupts the mechanisms involved in updating these representations. In the present study, we sought to investigate the effect of induced pain on the updating of peripersonal space and body representations during and following tool-use. We compared performance under three conditions (pain, active placebo, neutral) on a visuotactile crossmodal congruency task and a tactile distance judgement task to measure updating of peripersonal space and body representations, respectively. Consistent with previous findings, the difference in crossmodal interference from visual distractors in the same compared to opposite visual field to the tactile target was less when tools were crossed than uncrossed. This suggests an extension of peripersonal space to incorporate the tips of the tools. Also consistent with previous findings, estimates of the felt tactile distance judgements decreased after active tool-use. In contrast to our predictions, however, we found no evidence that pain interfered with performance on either task when compared to the control conditions. Our findings suggest that the updating of peripersonal space and body representations is not disrupted by induced pain. That is, experiencing acute pain does not give rise to distorted representations of the body and peripersonal space that can be present in people with chronic pain conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2946357300,"To what extent can online social networks predict who is at risk of an infection? Many infections are transmitted through physical encounter between humans, but collecting detailed information about it can be expensive, might invade privacy, or might not even be possible. In this paper, we ask whether online social networks help predict and contain epidemic risk. Using a dataset from a popular online review service which includes over 100 thousand users and spans 4 years of activity, we build a time-varying network that is a proxy of physical encounter between its users (the encounter network) and a static network based on their reported online friendship (the friendship With computer simulations, we compare stochastic infection processes on the two networks, considering infections on the encounter network as the benchmark. First, we show that the friendship network is useful to identify the individuals at risk of infection, despite providing lower accuracy than the ideal case in which the encounters are known. This limited prediction accuracy is not only due to the static nature of the friendship network because a static version of the encounter network provides more accurate prediction of risk than the friendship network. Then, we show that periodical monitoring of the infection spreading on the encounter network allows to correct the infection predicted by a process spreading on the friendly staff ndship network, and achieves high prediction accuracy. Finally, we show that the friendship network contains valuable information to effectively contain epidemic outbreaks even when a limited budget is available for immunization. In particular, a strategy that immunizes random friends of random individuals achieves the same performance as knowing individuals' encounters at a small additional cost, even if the infection spreads on the encounter network."
https://openalex.org/W2950947406,"Sorghum is used as a substitute for rice in dog food, owing to its nutritional similarity and low cost. However, its use has been associated with negative effects, like a reduction in palatability, digestibility, and enzyme activity, which can decrease nutrient absorption. The presence of condensed tannins (CT) in sorghum may cause these effects. Another tannin group, the hydrolysable tannins (HT), is known for its antioxidant properties. Research has shown the nutritional effects of sorghum on dogs, but the effect of HT on dogs remains unknown. We evaluated the effects of substituting rice with sorghum containing CT and inclusion of commercial extract of HT on digestibility, fecal and urinary characteristics, and postprandial blood glucose levels in adult dogs. Eight adult Beagle were randomly subjected to 4 treatments: (R) 50% rice; (RS) 25% rice + 25% sorghum; (RHT) 50% rice + 0.10% HT; (RSHT) 25% rice + 25% sorghum + 0,10% HT. Tannins did not affect food intake. The digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, crude protein (CP), acid hydrolyzed fat, gross energy, and metabolizable energy (ME) decreased with sorghum inclusion (P < 0.05). Greater fecal dry matter was observed with the RHT diet. HT associated with sorghum, RSHT diet, reduced ME (P < 0.05). Sorghum inclusion enhanced fecal output, without altering fecal score (P > 0.05). No alterations in urinary characteristics were observed. Sorghum and HT did not affect the postprandial blood glucose response measured by the area under the curve (P > 0.05). The substitution of rice by sorghum decreased CP digestibility and ME of the diets. Sorghum can be considered as a source of carbohydrates with lower digestibility of protein and energy than rice. HT may potentiate the effect of CT, but more research is needed to evaluate its potential use in dog nutrition."
