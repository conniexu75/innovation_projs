Although we now know a great deal about how the brain analyses visual information, we know little about how visual representations become linked with values. To study this process, we turned to the amygdala, a brain structure implicated in reinforcement learning. We recorded the activity of individual amygdala neurons in monkeys while abstract images acquired either positive or negative value through conditioning. After monkeys had learned the initial associations, we reversed image value assignments. We examined neural responses in relation to these reversals in order to estimate the relative contribution to neural activity of the sensory properties of images and their conditioned values. Here we show that changes in the values of images modulate neural activity, and that this modulation occurs rapidly enough to account for, and correlates with, monkeys' learning. Furthermore, distinct populations of neurons encode the positive and negative values of visual stimuli. Behavioural and physiological responses to visual stimuli may therefore be based in part on the plastic representation of value provided by the amygdala."

https://openalex.org/W2014725561,"Under most conditions, conventional superconductivity and ferromagnetism are mutually exclusive. Although they have been observed together in iron under pressure, the principle holds as a rule. But now Keizer et al. describe a system in which superconductivity and magnetism are finally seen working together. The material in which this occurs is chromium dioxide, well known as the active component of magnetic recording tape. It's a half-metallic ferromagnet, and can sustain a Josephson (or ‘spin triplet’) supercurrent that switches with the direction of magnetization. In general, conventional superconductivity should not occur in a ferromagnet, though it has been seen in iron under pressure1. Moreover, theory predicts that the current is always carried by pairs of electrons in a spin singlet state2, so conventional superconductivity decays very rapidly when in contact with a ferromagnet, which normally prohibits the existence of singlet pairs. It has been predicted that this rapid spatial decay would not occur if spin triplet superconductivity could be induced in the ferromagnet3,4. Here we report a Josephson supercurrent through the strong ferromagnet CrO2, from which we infer that it is a spin triplet supercurrent. Our experimental set-up is different from those envisaged in the earlier predictions, but we conclude that the underlying physical explanation for our result is a conversion from spin singlet pairs to spin triplets at the interface. The supercurrent can be switched with the direction of the magnetization, analogous to spin valve transistors, and therefore could enable magnetization-controlled Josephson junctions."

These drugs are appended via a valine-citrulline (vc) dipeptide linkage designed for high stability in serum and conditional cleavage and putative release of fully active drugs by lysosomal cathepsins. To characterize the biochemical processes leading to effective drug delivery, we examined the intracellular trafficking, internalization, and metabolism of the parent antibody and two antibody-drug conjugates, cAC10vc-MMAE and cAC10vc-MMAF, following CD30 surface antigen interaction with target cells. Both cAC10 and its conjugates bound to target cells and internalized in a similar manner. Subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that the antibody and antibody-drug conjugates entering target cells migrated to the lysosomes. Trafficking of both species was blocked by inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, suggesting that drug conjugation does not alter the fate of antibody-antigen complexes. Incubation of cAC10vc-MMAE or cAC10vc-MMAF with purified cathepsin B or with enriched lysosomal fractions prepared by subcellular fractionation resulted in the release of active, free drug. Cysteine protease inhibitors, but not aspartic or serine protease inhibitors, blocked antibody-drug conjugate metabolism and the ensuing cytotoxicity of target cells and yielded enhanced intracellular levels of the intact conjugates. These findings suggest that in addition to trafficking to the lysosomes, cathepsin B and perhaps other lysosomal cysteine proteases are requisite for drug release and provide a mechanistic basis for developing antibody-drug conjugates cleavable by intracellular proteases for the targeted delivery of anti-cancer therapeutics.

The unmet medical need for more effective anticancer therapeutics, especially for strategies that can focus toxicity to tumor cells and away from normal tissues, has lead to the development of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 3The abbreviations used are: mAb, monoclonal antibody; MMAE, monomethyl auristatin E; MMAF, monomethyl auristatin F; vc, valine-citrulline; ADC, mAb-drug conjugate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. linked to immunotoxins, radionuclides, or cytotoxic drugs, to provide selective elimination of antigen-positive target cells. The first such clinically approved agent, Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg), an anti-CD33 mAb linked to the potent DNA damaging agent calicheamicin, is used for the treatment of patients with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (1Sievers E.L. Larson R.A. Stadtmauer E.A. Estey E. Lowenberg B. Dombret H. Karanes C. Theobald M. Bennett J.M. Sherman M.L. Berger M.S. Eten C.B. Loken M.R. van Dongen J.J. Bernstein I.D. Appelbaum F.R. J. Clin. Oncol. 2001; 19: 3244-3254Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Mylotarg and multiple other mAb-drug conjugates (ADCs) and mAbtoxin conjugates currently in development use primarily disulfide or hydrazone linkers sensitive to the reductive or acidic environment of the tumor cell (2Omelyanenko V.

Pastan I. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 3937-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). These linkers readily deliver and liberate free drug or toxin within the target cell and yet are relatively unstable in circulation compared with the circulating half-life of the mAb (7Sanderson R.J. Hering M.A. James S.F. Sun M.M. Doronina S.O. Siadak A.W. Senter P.D. Wahl A.F. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 843-852PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in premature drug release. An alternative approach is to employ ADC linkers of protease-cleavable dipeptides. These combine qualities of high stability in serum or plasma with efficient drug release potentially by lysosomal proteases (8Dubowchik G.M. Firestone R.A. Padilla L. Willner D. Hofstead S.J.

Using this strategy, we recently described a new ADC of the anti-CD30 mAb cAC10 (9Wahl A.F. Klussman K. Thompson J.D. Chen J.H. Francisco L.V. Risdon G. Chace D.F. Siegall C.B. Francisco J.A.

This drug linker system was shown to be highly stable in vitro and in vivo (7Sanderson R.J. Hering M.A. James S.F. Sun M.M. Doronina S.O. Siadak A.W. Senter P.D. Wahl A.F. Clin.

One premise of this drug delivery technology is that the mAb-antigen complex on the cell surface will internalize, traffic to the lysosomes, and be metabolized by lysosomal proteases to release free drug. ADC efficacy therefore depends in part on mAb-antigen interaction at the cell surface triggering the internalization, trafficking, and subsequent release of the active cytotoxic payload. Thus, conjugates comprised of different drug linkers or with different mAbs against the same target can vary significantly in their utility. For example, anti-CD20 ADC incorporating doxorubicin (16Braslawsky G.R. Kadow K. Knipe J. McGoff K. Edson M. Kaneko T. Greenfield R.S. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 1991; 33: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 17Sapra P. Allen T.M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 7190-7194PubMed Google Scholar) or ricin-A (18Goulet A.C. Goldmacher V.S. Lambert J.M. Baron C. Roy D.C. Kouassi E. Blood. 1997; 90: 2364-2375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were ineffective as anti-tumor agents, whereas anti-CD20 conjugates of vcMMAE were highly effective against CD20+ tumors (14Law C.L. Cerveny C.G. Gordon K.A. Klussman K. Mixan B.J. Chace D.F. Meyer D.L. Doronina S.O. Siegall C.B. Francisco J.A. Senter P.D. Wahl A.F. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 7842-7851Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the anti-CD20 mAb remained on the cell surface, whereas the anti-CD20vc-MMAE conjugate was readily internalized, resulting in rapid cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (14Law C.L. Cerveny C.G. Gordon K.A. Klussman K. Mixan B.J. Chace D.F. Meyer D.L. Doronina S.O. Siegall C.B. Francisco J.A. Senter P.D. Wahl A.F. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 7842-7851Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Alternatively, in targeting CD30, both mAb and anti-CD30 ADC demonstrated comparable binding and internalization rates in CD30+ tumor cells (11Francisco J.A. Cerveny C.G. Meyer D.L. Mixan B.J. Klussman K. Chace D.F. Rejniak S.X. Gordon K.A. DeBlanc R. Toki B.E. Law C.L. Doronina S.O. Siegall C.B. Senter P.D. Wahl A.F.

Just what governs optimal ADC internalization and trafficking critical for effective drug release is not known. Here we examine the trafficking and intracellular fate of anti-CD30 mAb cAC10 and two cAC10-drug conjugates, cAC10vc-MMAE and cAC10vc-MMAF, in CD30+ T-cell lymphoma cell lines. Using flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, subcellular fractionation, and chemical inhibitors of trafficking and processing, we demonstrate that the cytotoxicity of peptide-linked auristatin ADCs is contingent upon their delivery to the lysosome and the activity of lysosomal cysteine proteases. These studies demonstrate the functional basis of drug delivery by ADCs with protease-cleavable linkers for anti-cancer therapeutics.

L540cy cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated fetal calf sera and antibiotics. L540cy cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated with 2 μg/ml cAC10, cAC10vc-MMAE, or cAC10vc-MMAF for 30 min on ice, rinsed with ice-cold PBS, and then incubated for 30 min in the presence (cross-linking) or absence (no cross-linking) of 2 μg/ml goat anti-human IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) (20Coffey G.P.

The reactions were stopped by quick freezing in a dry ice bath. The digests were mixed with Novex sample buffer (Invitrogen), run on 4-20% Tris-Gly or 4-12% Bis-Tris gradient gels (Invitrogen) under reducing conditions, and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Invitrogen). The membranes were blocked with 2% nonfat dry milk in PBST (PBS+ 0.1% Tween 20) prior to incubation with the mouse SG2.15 antibody to detect drug.

The results were reported as the IC50 values, the concentration of compound needed to yield a 50% reduction in viability compared with untreated cells (control = 100%). To inhibit ADC metabolism, L540cy cells (8 × 103 cells/well) were pretreated with 20 μm E64d, 0.5 μm CA074-OME, 10 μm calpeptin (Calbiochem), 3 μm N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO (calpain inhibitor I; Calbiochem), 20 μg/ml pepstatin A (Calbiochem), 20 μm p-aminoethylbenzenesulfonyl fluoride (Calbiochem), 20 μg/ml aprotinin (Sigma), or 25 μm cystamine dihydrochloride (Sigma) for 1 h prior to the addition of cAC10vc-MMAE. The cultures were maintained for 96 h prior to the addition of Celltiter-Glo. The cells were incubated with Celltiter-Glo reagent for 25 min, and the dishes were processed for luminescent readout. In other experiments, Karpas cells (5 × 105 cells) were incubated in growth medium for 4 h at 37 °C prior to the harvesting of cells to generate lysosomal fractions. The fractions were washed with 0.25 m sucrose buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. Each fraction was incubated with cAC10vc-MMAE (5 μg/ml) for 24 h in reaction buffer (2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0). Afterward, the fractions were diluted 300-fold in RPMI growth medium and added to cultures of CD30-negative Ramos cells (1 × 104 cells/well; American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) in the presence or absence of 2.5 μg/ml mouse anti-MMAE antibody, SG3.190. Cell growth was assessed 96 h later with Alamar Blue. The cells were incubated with the dye for 4 h prior to fluorescence measurement on a Fusion HT plate reader. MMAE and MMAF belong to the dolastatin 10 family of highly potent anti-mitotic agents that inhibit tubulin polymerization (Fig. 1) (10Doronina S.O. Toki B.E. Torgov M.Y. Mendelsohn B.A. Cerveny C.G.

In contrast to MMAE, the charged, carboxylic acid terminus of free MMAF can potentially limit passive transit through cell membranes. The cAC10 antibody-drug conjugates of MMAE and MMAF containing a protease-cleavable vc linker were prepared as described previously (10Doronina S.O. Toki B.E. Torgov M.Y. Mendelsohn B.A. Cerveny C.G.

We have reported that cAC10 and cAC10-vcMMAE were comparable in binding to CD30+ cells and lacked interaction with CD30-negative cells (11Francisco J.A. Cerveny C.G. Meyer D.L. Mixan B.J. Klussman K.

The activities of the free drugs and the conjugates cAC10vc-MMAE and cAC10vc-MMAF were compared on CD30+ lymphoma cell lines including Karpas-299 and L540cy (Table 1). Comparison of free drugs showed that the cell-permeable MMAE was 50-200-fold more effective than MMAF. As an ADC however, cAC10vc-MMAF was significantly more potent than cAC10vc-MMAE (IC50 < than 0.11 nm, p < 0.001). Neither drug conjugate exhibited appreciable activity against multiple antigen-negative cell lines, demonstrating that the potency of these ADCs is antigen-dependent. For example, the IC50 value against the CD30-negative cell line Ramos following 96 h continuous exposure was >75 nm (Table 1).TABLE 1Cytotoxic activities of cAC10vc-MMAE and cAC10vc-MMAF on CD30+ tumor cell linesCell lineTypeCD30aCD30 levels expressed as the number of antibody molecules bound per cell.MMAEMMAFcAC10vc-EcAC10vc-FKarpasALCL (T-cell)290,6760.52 ± 0.29bp < 0.005 to MMAF.101 ± 120.11 ± 0.016bp < 0.005 to MMAF.0.05 ± 0.005L540cyHD (T-cell)587,5111.25 ± 0.81cp < 0.001 to MMAF.65.6 ± 14.30.32 ± 0.032dp < 0.001 to cAC10vc-F.0.11 ± 0.035RamosBurkitt lymphoma00.039 ± 0.02bp < 0.005 to MMAF.58 ± 10>75>75a CD30 levels expressed as the number of antibody molecules bound per cell.b p < 0.005 to MMAF.c p < 0.001 to MMAF.d p < 0.001 to cAC10vc-F. Open table in a new tab To evaluate the trafficking and internalization of cAC10 and its ADC, CD30+ L540cy cells were preincubated with mAb or ADCs and treated with vehicle or anti-human IgG for cross-linking prior to culture at 37 °C. Cross-linked antibodies exhibit increased internalization and cellular clearance (10Doronina S.O. Toki B.E. Torgov M.Y. Mendelsohn B.A. Cerveny C.G. Chace D.F. DeBlanc R.L. Gearing R.P. Bovee T.D. Siegall C.B. Francisco J.A. Wahl A.F. Meyer D.L. Senter P.D. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 778-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). At appointed times, the cells were harvested and assessed for surface-bound and intracellular levels of mAb and ADCs by flow cytometry (Fig. 2). Cell surface levels of both mAb and ADCs decreased sharply with time, coincident with increased intracellular levels (Fig. 2), suggesting that they internalized with similar kinetics. By 20 h, the surface levels of mAb and ADCs were ∼60% of the initial levels (Fig. 2A). Intracellular levels rose quickly within the first hour, peaked between 2 and 5 h, and maintained lower but steady levels up to 48 h (Fig. 2B). Cross-linking of the cAC10 antibody and ADCs increased intracellular levels of both the mAb and the conjugates by ∼3-fold over levels observed in the absence of cross-linking (Fig. 2B). Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to localize the internalized mAb and ADCs within L540cy cells (Fig. 3). The cells were incubated with the mAb or ADCs either on ice or at 37 °C for the stated times and imaged immediately or fixed, permeabilized, and then processed for immunofluorescence. The cells incubated on ice and stained for mAb or ADCs (Fig. 3, top panels, green signal) showed diffuse, cell surface-associated staining and no evidence of internalization. Lysosomes, visualized using an antibody to lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (Lamp-1; Fig. 3, top panels, red signal) or with LysoTracker (bottom panels, red signal) were distinct and punctate. At 37 °C, there was capping and punctate staining for both mAb and ADCs within the L540cy cells and reduced staining on the cell surface. The intracellular mAb and ADC signals co-localized with those for Lamp-1 (Fig. 3, arrows, yellow signal, 16 h incubation) or with LysoTracker (Fig. 3, 3-h incubation, yellow signal, Merged, and data not shown), suggesting that both mAb and ADCs internalized and were transported to the l"

https://openalex.org/W2093935547,"S-nitrosation of mitochondrial proteins has been proposed to contribute to the pathophysiological interactions of nitric oxide (NO) and its derivatives with mitochondria but has not been shown directly. Furthermore, little is known about the mechanism of formation or the fate of these putative S-nitrosothiols. Here we have determined whether mitochondrial membrane protein thiols can be S-nitrosated on exposure to free NO from 3,3-bis(aminoethyl)-1-hydroxy-2-oxo-1-triazene (DETA-NONOate) by interaction with S-nitrosoglutathione or S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) and by the NO derivative peroxynitrite. S-Nitrosation of protein thiols was measured directly by chemiluminescence detection. S-Nitrosoglutathione and S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine led to extensive protein thiol oxidation, with about 30% of the modified protein thiols persistently S-nitrosated. In contrast, there was no protein thiol oxidation or S-nitrosation on exposure to 3,3-bis (aminoethyl)-1-hydroxy-2-oxo-1-triazene. Peroxynitrite extensively oxidized protein thiols but produced negligible amounts of S-nitrosothiols. Therefore, mitochondrial membrane protein thiols are S-nitrosated by preformed S-nitrosothiols but not by NO or by peroxynitrite. These S-nitrosated protein thiols were readily reduced by glutathione, so S-nitrosation will only persist when the mitochondrial glutathione pool is oxidized. Respiratory chain complex I was S-nitrosated by S-nitrosothiols, consistent with it being an important target for S-nitrosation during nitrosative stress. The S-nitrosation of complex I correlated with a significant loss of activity that was reversed by thiol reductants. S-Nitrosation was also associated with increased superoxide production from complex I. These findings point to a significant role for complex I S-nitrosation and consequent dysfunction during nitrosative stress in disorders such as Parkinson disease and sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W1966973624,"Previous studies have determined that mice with a homozygous deletion in the adapter protein p66shc have an extended life span and that cells derived from these mice exhibit lower levels of reactive oxygen species. Here we demonstrate that a fraction of p66shc localizes to the mitochondria and that p66shc-/- fibroblasts have altered mitochondrial energetics. In particular, despite similar cytochrome content, under basal conditions, the oxygen consumption of spontaneously immortalized p66shc-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts were lower than similarly maintained wild type cells. Differences in oxygen consumption were particularly evident under chemically uncoupled conditions, demonstrating that p66shc-/- cells have a reduction in both their resting and maximal oxidative capacity. We further demonstrate that reconstitution of p66shc expression in p66shc-/- cells increases oxygen consumption. The observed defect in oxidative capacity seen in p66shc-/- cells is partially offset by augmented levels of aerobic glycolysis. This metabolic switch is manifested by p66shc-/- cells exhibiting an increase in lactate production and a stricter requirement for extracellular glucose in order to maintain intracellular ATP levels. In addition, using an in vivo NADH photobleaching technique, we demonstrate that mitochondrial NADH metabolism is reduced in p66shc-/- cells. These results demonstrate that p66shc regulates mitochondrial oxidative capacity and suggest that p66shc may extend life span by repartitioning metabolic energy conversion away from oxidative and toward glycolytic pathways.

Generation of ATP in the mitochondria represents the most efficient pathway to meet the energetic needs of a cell. This process, however, requires the consumption of molecular oxygen with a corresponding production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). 2The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; MEF, mouse embroyo fibroblast; FCCP, carbonylcyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone; ED-FRAP, enzyme-dependent fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. Generation of ROS appears to be one of the central mechanisms that contribute to aging in a wide range of organisms (1Finkel T. Holbrook N.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (7418) Google Scholar, 2Wallace D.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2005; 39: 359-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (2561) Google Scholar, 3Balaban R.S. Nemoto S. Finkel T. Cell. 2005; 120: 483-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3348) Google Scholar). In contrast, under aerobic conditions, energy generation can also be achieved through glycolytic pathways present in the cytosol. These cytosolic pathways are inherently less efficient but do not produce ROS. Each cell employs a different relative balance between these two major energetic pathways, although relatively little is known about how this partition is established or maintained. In lower organisms, such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila, a number of longevity-associated genes have been isolated. One prominent and well characterized aging pathway regulates the activity of the transcription factor DAF-16, a member of the Forkhead family of transcriptional regulators. Evidence suggests that DAF-16 is involved in responding to numerous environmental stresses (4Johnson T.E. de Castro E. Hegi de Castro S. Cypser J. Henderson S. Tedesco P. Exp. Gerontol. 2001; 36: 1609-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). A rise in intracellular ROS is one particular stress that may be relevant to life span determination, and in this regard, it is of interest that both DAF-16 and its closest mammalian ortholog Foxo3a appear to regulate a number of cellular antioxidant proteins (5Murphy C.T.

Nature. 2002; 419: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). In addition to the DAF-16 pathway, RNAi screens performed in C. elegans has identified a number of other putative longevity genes (10Lee S.S. Lee R.Y. Fraser A.G. Kamath R.S. Ahringer J. Ruvkun G. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar, 11Hamilton B. Dong Y. Shindo M. Liu W. Odell I. Ruvkun G. Lee S.S. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1544-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Interestingly, functional characterization of these longevity-associated genes have determined that a number of them appear to be important for mitochondrial function. Similarly, direct knockdown of components of the electron transport chain has also been shown to extend the life span of the worm (12Dillin A. Hsu A.L. Arantes-Oliveira N. Lehrer-Graiwer J. Hsin H. Fraser A.G. Kamath R.S. Ahringer J. Kenyon C. Science. 2002; 298: 2398-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Analysis of these long lived mitochondrial mutants, as well as in depth energetic analysis of the previously characterized DAF-16-related mutants, has led to the proposal that many life span-extending mutants in C. elegans slow aging by decreasing mitochondrial metabolism (13Rea S. Johnson T.E. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 197-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This hypothesis suggests that a shift away from trichloroacetic acid-based mitochondrial metabolism might extend life by a reduction in oxidative stress. Nonetheless, it should be mentioned that the relationship between metabolic rate and ROS production is not straightforward (3Balaban R.S. Nemoto S. Finkel T. Cell. 2005; 120: 483-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3348) Google Scholar). In contrast to the wealth of information regarding aging in lower organisms, there is relatively little known regarding the genetic control of mammalian life span. Only a handful of genes have to date been documented to be capable of extending either the mean or maximum age of mammalian organisms (14Kenyon C. Cell. 2005; 120: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). One previously described knock-out mouse that appears to produce a long-lived but phenotypically normal animal was obtained after deletion of p66shc (15Migliaccio E. Giorgio M. Mele S. Pelicci G. Reboldi P. Pandolfi P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 1999; 402: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1479) Google Scholar). Shc proteins are alternatively spliced 46-, 52-, and 66-kDa isoforms that were initially viewed as simple adapter molecules linking receptors with downstream effector molecules such as Ras proteins (16Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 93-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). The larger p66shc isoform differs structurally from its two other isoforms by the presence of a 14-kDa N-terminal CH2 domain. Previous studies have demonstrated that animals deficient in p66shc have an approximate 30% extension in life span (15Migliaccio E. Giorgio M. Mele S. Pelicci G. Reboldi P. Pandolfi P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 1999; 402: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1479) Google Scholar). These animals are resistant to exogenous oxidative stress and also exhibit lower levels of spontaneous oxidative burden (15Migliaccio E. Giorgio M. Mele S. Pelicci G. Reboldi P. Pandolfi P.P.

Consistent with these in vivo observations, p66shc-/- cells have lower levels of ROS (8Nemoto S. Finkel T. Science. 2002; 295: 2450-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 19Trinei M. Giorgio M. Cicalese A. Barozzi S. Ventura A. Migliaccio E. Milia E. Padura I.M. Raker V.A. Maccarana M. Petronilli V. Minucci S. Bernardi P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3872-3878Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). One potential explanation for this effect may come from a modest increase in scavenging capacity in these cells (8Nemoto S. Finkel T. Science. 2002; 295: 2450-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar); however, this is unlikely to explain the much more significant decrease in basal and stress-induced ROS levels. Given that the mitochondria represent the largest source of ROS generation within cells and that oxygen consumption and ROS generation represent an important determinant in aging in a number of species, we sought to explore whether p66shc might directly regulate ROS production by regulating mitochondrial metabolism. Cell Lines and Subcellular Fractionation—Spontaneously immortalized MEFs (+/+) cells and p66shc-/- MEFs were a gift of Pier Pelicci and have been previously described (8Nemoto S. Finkel T. Science. 2002; 295: 2450-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). PC12 and HeLa cells were obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. To purify the cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions, we used the ApoAlert Cell Fraction kit (Clontech). To assess the distribution of p66shc, 30 μg of mitochondrial or cytosolic fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the purity of the fractions was assessed by probing for the cytosolic gene product tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and the mitochondrial gene product COX4 (Clontech). For some experiments, we also collected and analyzed the initial 700 × g pellet containing plasma membranes. For construction of the R177A mutant, substitution of alanine for arginine residue at amino acid position 177 was performed by standard methods, and both the mutant and wild type were subsequently confirmed by direct sequencing. Reconstitution of p66shc into p66shc-/- cells was achieved by transfection of the hygromycin resistance plasmid pTK-Hygro only for control cell lines or this resistance plasmid along with an epitope-tagged p66shc-/- expression plasmid that has been previously described (8Nemoto S. Finkel T. Science. 2002; 295: 2450-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). In both cases, hygromycin-resistant colonies were obtained, and p66shc expression was monitored by Western blot analysis employing the epitope tag. For knock-down expression of p66shc in PC12 cells, we targeted a 20-nucleotide sequence in p66shc: GTACAACCCACTTCGGAATG. This sequence was incorporated into the psiRNA vector (InvivoGen) to enable the continuous, endogenous expression of small interfering RNAs in stable clones. For oxygen consumption measurements, two random knockdown cell lines were compared with two random Zeocin-selected PC12 cell lines transfected with the psiRNA vector alone. Mitochondrial NADH and NADH Oxidase Measurements—Cellular NADH fluorescence was measured at room temperature using an excitation wavelength of 351 nm with emission monitored using a 385-470-nm band pass filter. Optical slice thickness was set to 1.5 μm. NADH regeneration was assessed using NADH ED-FRAP as previously described (20Combs C.A. Balaban R.S. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2018-2028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 21Joubert F. Fales H.M. Wen H. Combs C.A. Balaban R.S. Biophys.

In brief, all ED-FRAP data analysis was performed using custom-written programs in the IDL programming language (RSI Inc., Boulder, CO). Initial rates of regeneration were determined using a linear regression of the first five points (2 s) after the photolysis pulse. Before fitting, all recovery points were filtered using a Lee filter algorithm to smooth out additive image noise. To determine NADH consumption in cytosolic or mitochondrial fractions, MEF lysate was fractionated as above, and 30 μg of either mitochondrial or cytosolic lysate protein was used. Mitochondrial protein was solubilized in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA) and subsequently diluted 1:20 (v/v) in phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), and the disappearance of 100 μm NADH was monitored at 340 nm. Metabolic Measurements—Oxygen consumption was measured using an oxygen electrode standardized to room air (0.2 mm O2). The data were digitized and stored using an analog to digital conversion system (DASYLab32). All measurements of oxygen consumption were performed in intact cells. In general, one representative experiment performed in triplicate is shown. All oxygen consumption experiments were performed on at least three separate occasions. To maximize oxygen consumption, the chemical uncoupler carbonylcyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP; 5.0 μm) was used. Lactate was measured using the lactate reagent kit (Sigma). Media from wild type MEFs or p66shc-/- cells (1 × 106) were conditioned for 24 h prior to lactate determination. For the simultaneous determination of oxygen utilization and lactate levels, we employed the methods previously described (23Sariban-Sohraby S. Magrath I.T. Balaban R.S. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 4662-4664PubMed Google Scholar). The degree of proton leak was calculated by measuring oxygen consumption in permeabilized cells (digitonin, 250 μg/ml) in the presence of oligomycin (25 μg/ml). ATP was measured from 1 × 106 cells using the ATP determination kit (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) with cells either maintained in full media or in media lacking glucose. Six hours after glucose withdrawal, cells were lysed in buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA) for ATP determination. Results of ATP and lactate levels are, except where indicated, the results of a single representative experiment performed in triplicate. All experiments were performed at least three separate times. p66shc Localizes to the Mitochondria and Regulates Oxygen Consumption and Oxidative Capacity—Since Shc proteins were viewed as adapter molecules for cell surface receptor complexes, the subcellular localization of p66shc as well as its two other protein isoforms, p46shc and p52shc, were initially thought to be confined to the plasma membrane. Recent reports have challenged this assumption, and in particular evidence suggests that p46shc localizes exclusively to the mitochondria and that a 32-amino acid motif is essential for this targeting (24Ventura A. Maccarana M. Raker V.A. Pelicci P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2299-2306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This 32-a-mino acid motif is not unique for p46shc and is also contained within p66shc. Consistent with these observations, recent evidence suggests that this larger Shc isoform might also be partially localized within the mitochondria (24Ventura A. Maccarana M. Raker V.A. Pelicci P.G.

As noted in Fig. 1, we also observed that a proportion of p66shc was consistently found within the mitochondrial fraction. Based on calculation of the relative mass of the mitochondrial fraction, we estimate that ∼10% of p66shc is contained within the mitochondria of our wild type MEFs. This estimation is in good agreement with other recent observations (25Giorgio M. Migliaccio E. Orsini F. Paolucci D. Moroni M. Contursi C. Pelliccia G. Luzi L. Minucci S. Marcaccio M. Pinton P. Rizzuto R. Bernardi P. Paolucci F. Pelicci P.G. Cell. 2005; 122: 221-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar) as well as indirect immunofluorescence data (supplemental Fig. S1). As mentioned above, importation of p46shc into the mitochondria requires a nonconventional N-terminal 32-amino acid targeting sequence and, in particular, an arginine residue at position 22 of the protein (24Ventura A. Maccarana M. Raker V.A. Pelicci P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2299-2306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This entire targeting sequence is also contained within the p66shc isoform, but because of the N-terminal CH2 domain of p66shc, the critical arginine reside occurs at position 177. Making the corresponding Arg177 substitution in p66shc revealed that this amino acid change did not significantly alter the distribution of p66shc (Figs. 1B and S1). Thus, importation of p66shc into the mitochondria appears to occur via a mechanism that significantly diverges from the p46shc isoform. We next sought to understand whether the absence of p66shc in cells alters mitochondrial function. Given the relationship between mitochondrial metabolism and aging, we first sought to characterize oxygen consumption in intact wild type and p66shc-/- cells. As noted in Fig. 2A, basal oxygen consumption was reduced by ∼30-50% in p66shc-/- MEFs. This difference could not be explained by differences in mitochondrial number, since cytochrome a and a3 content was similar in the two cell types (wild type MEFs, 40 ± 8 μmol/107 cell; p66shc-/- MEFs, 50 ± 5 μmol/107 cell, p not significant). In an effort to measure maximal oxygen consumption, we treated cells with the chemical uncoupling agent FCCP. Oxygen consumption of wild type and p66shc-/- MEFs treated with FCCP demonstrated a bell-shaped concentration effect with maximal uncoupling noted at 5 μm FCCP, a concentration that was subsequently employed in all experiments. As noted in Fig. 2A, under these maximally uncoupled conditions, wild type cells more than doubled their oxygen consumption, whereas p66shc-/- cells had a much more modest rise in oxygen consumption. In contrast, the addition of the mitochondrial inhibitor oligomycin resulted in a similar and nearly complete reduction in oxygen consumption in both wild type and p66shc-/- cells. Therefore, under resting conditions, oxygen consumption in both cell types appears to derive almost exclusively from mitochondrial cytochrome chain activity, and the degree of oligomycin-insensitive uncoupled respiration appears low. To further confirm the role of p66shc in regulating oxygen consumption, we generated stable cell lines with reconstituted p66shc in an MEF knock-out cell background. Seven random control clones of p66shc-/- transfected with an empty vector had levels of oxygen consumption similar to what was previously observed in the p66shc-/- parental cell line (Fig. 2B). In contrast, seven random clones transfected with a p66shc expression vector had increased levels of oxygen consumption (p < 0.01). This difference in respiration did not appear to reflect differences in uncoupling, since the level of oligomycin-insensitive respiration did not appreciably differ between the p66shc-reconstituted and empty vector clones (supplemental Fig. S2). To potentially extend these observations to other cell types, we also created stable clones of PC12 cells constitutively expressing a short interfering RNA directed at p66shc. Compared with two control PC12 lines, PC12 cells with knock-down p66shc expression had reduced oxygen consumption (Fig. 2C and inset). Absence of p66shc Increases Aerobic Glycolysis—If p66shc-/- cells have less oxygen consumption and hence less mitochondria-dependent energy generation, then presumably energetic demands are met through an increase in alternative ATP-generating pathways. One major alternative pathway is aerobic glycolysis, with the ATP-generating step deriving from the cytosolic conversion of pyruvate to lactate. Measurement of 24-h lactate production revealed that p66shc-/- cells did indeed have evidence for increased lactate production (Fig. 3A). To understand the relative balance between aerobic respiration occurring in the mitochondria and glycolysis taking place within the cytosol, we simultaneously measured oxygen consumption and lactate levels using a previously described method (23Sariban-Sohraby S. Magrath I.T. Balaban R.S. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 4662-4664PubMed Google Scholar). As noted in Table 1, using these values, as well as the calculated level of proton leak derived from oligomycin-insensitive respiration (Fig. 3B), we determined that wild type MEFs had over half of their ATP production derived from aerobic respiration. In contrast, for p66shc-/- cells, aerobic respiration accounted for closer to one-third of ATP production.TABLE 1Sources of ATP generation in wild type (+/+) and p66shc−/− MEFsO2 consumptionLactic acidTotal ATPPercentage of ATP production fromRespirationGlycolysisnmol/min/mg protein%%+/+2.3 ± 0.310 ± 0.924 ± 1.554.145.9−/−1.4 ± 0.114 ± 1.422 ± 1.635.065.0 Open table in a new tab The increased reliance on glycolysis for p66shc-/- cells was also demonstrated by the differences in energetic homeostasis in the setting of glucose withdrawal. Under these conditions, oxidative phosphorylation is supported by the remaining carbon substrates, most notably glutamate and fatty acids. As noted in Fig. 3C, 6 h after withdrawing glucose from the media, wild type cells had a modest, but not statistically significant, fall in intracellular ATP levels. In contrast, the same glucose withdrawal resulted in a pronounced reduction in intracellular ATP levels in p66shc-/- cells. These results are consistent with the classical Pasteur effect, whereby an inhibition of oxidative metabolism results in an increased reliance on less efficient, glycolytic pathways to meet cellular energetic demands. Regulation of Mitochondrial NADH Metabolism by p66shc—We next sought to further understand the basis for the difference in resting oxygen consumption between wild type and p66shc-/- MEF. As noted in Fig. 4, A and B, microfluorometric measurements of the distribution of NADH appeared similar in wild type and p66shc-/- cells. This technique predominantly measures protein-bound NAD(P)H and is therefore most reflective of mitochondrial rather then free cytosolic NAD(P)H levels. Quantification of the NADH fluorescent intensity revealed an approximate 20% increase in resting fluorescence in knock-out cells (Fig. 4C). Since the interpretation of resting NADH levels in quiescent cells is difficult, we next sought to assess whether differences existed in NADH turnover between these two cell types. Using a previously described NADH photolysis technique, NADH ED-FRAP (20Combs C.A. Balaban R.S. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2018-2028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 21Joubert F. Fales H.M. Wen H. Combs C.A. Balaban R.S. Biophys.

Methods Enzymol. 2004; 385: 257-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), we noted that p66shc-/- cells exhibited an overall reduction in the degree of NADH regeneration photolysis demonstrated an approximate 40% following the laser-induced photolysis of NADH to NAD (Fig. 5A). Quantification of the initial recovery rate of NADH regeneration following reduction in p66shc-/- cells (Fig. 5B). These data are consistent with p66shc-/- cells having a blockage or slowing of NADH synthesis from NAD, a process that normally occurs either in the Krebs cycle or from reverse electron flow through Site I of oxidative phosphorylation (21Joubert F. Fales H.M. Wen H. Combs C.A. Balaban R.S. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 629-645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).FIGURE 5p66shc alters mitochondrial NADH flux.

Therefore, to further pursue the question of alterations in NADH metabolism, we prepared from wild type and p66shc-/- cytosolic and mitochondrial extracts cells. As noted in Fig. 6, cytosolic consumption of exogenous NADH was similar in the two cell lines. In contrast, compared with wild type cells, permeabilized mitochondria derived from p66shc-/- cells had a considerably slower rate of exogenous NADH consumption. As such, these biochemical measurements are consistent with the previously described noninvasive, NADH ED-FRAP measurements and suggest that the defect in NADH metabolism in p66shc cells is confined predominantly to the mitochondria. The identification of gene products that regulate life span has provided significant insight into the molecular mechanisms that underlie aging. In contrast to lower organisms, to date, only a handful of mammalian longevity genes have been identified, and it remains unclear as to how these gene products actually regulate life span (14Kenyon C. Cell. 2005; 120: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). One dominant theory regarding aging involves the role of overall metabolism and, in particular, the contribution of reactive oxygen species generated by mitochondrial metabolism (1Finkel T. Holbrook N.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (7418) Google Scholar, 2Wallace D.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2005; 39: 359-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (2561) Google Scholar, 3Balaban R.S. Nemoto S. Finkel T. Cell. 2005; 120: 483-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3348) Google Scholar). Here we have demonstrated that the mammalian longevity gene product p66shc functions as a regulator of mitochondrial metabolism. The impetus for our investigation began with the initial observation that p66shc-/- mice exhibit increased resistance to oxidative stress such as was observed following paraquat exposure (15Migliaccio E. Giorgio M. Mele S. Pelicci G. Reboldi P. Pandolfi P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 1999; 402: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1479) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that animals lacking p66shc have a reduction in other markers of basal oxidative stress (17Napoli C. Martin-Padura I. de Nigris F. Giorgio M. Mansueto G. Somma P. Condorelli M. Sica G. De Rosa G. Pelicci P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2112-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 18Francia P. delli Gatti C. Bachschmid M. Martin-Padura I. Savoia C. Migliaccio E. Pelicci P.G. Schiavoni M. Luscher T.F. Volpe M. Cosentino F. Circulation. 2004; 110: 2889-2895Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, cells derived from p66shc animals have reduced resting and stress-induced levels of ROS (8Nemoto S. Finkel T. Science. 2002; 295: 2450-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 19Trinei M. Giorgio M. Cicalese A. Barozzi S. Ventura A. Migliaccio E. Milia E. Padura I.M. Raker V.A. Maccarana M. Petronilli V. Minucci S. Bernardi P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3872-3878Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In the process of performing these experiments, a very recent report suggested that p66shc can generate hydrogen peroxide in conjunction with reduced cytochrome c (25Giorgio M. Migliaccio E. Orsini F. Paolucci D. Moroni M. Contursi C. Pelliccia G. Luzi L. Minucci S. Marcaccio M. Pinton P. Rizzuto R. Bernardi P. Paolucci F. Pelicci P.G. Cell. 2005; 122: 221-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). These authors have argued that this property is essential for the burst of mitochondrial ROS that occurs with the induction of apoptosis. Interestingly, this study identified a region of p66shc required for the in vitro interaction with cytochrome c that is adjacent to but outside the unique CH2 domain of the protein. Since this identified region is also present in p52shc, it is unclear whether this ROS-producing property is also shared by the other Shc isoforms that are not currently associated with longevity. It also remains unclear how this ability to generate hydrogen peroxide following apoptotic stress relates to the observation that levels of ROS are chronically reduced in p66shc-/- cells and animals, especially since under basal conditions, one would not expect a significant rate of apoptosis. One possibility is that nonapoptotic stresses could also activate p66shc to produce hydrogen peroxide in a cytochrome c-dependent fashion. Although answers to these questions require further study, together they argue that p66shc has properties beyond being a simple adapter molecule. Whereas our data and previous studies suggest that a fraction of p66shc localizes to the mitochondria, it is currently unclear how this importation occurs. In the related p46shc molecule, an N-terminal stretch of 32 amino acids is responsible for directing this isoform exclusively to the mitochondria (24Ventura A. Maccarana M. Raker V.A. Pelicci P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2299-2306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This sequence is not recognized by current bioinformatic methods as a mitochondrial targeting sequence. Within this region, arginine 22 is essential for mitochondrial targeting (24Ventura A. Maccarana M. Raker V.A. Pelicci P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2299-2306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The corresponding 32-amino acid stretch is found in p66shc, but as demonstrated here and previously, the majority of p66shc is nonmitochondrial. Similarly, as we show here, in contrast to the p46shc isoform, mutation of the corresponding arginine in p66shc does not alter the subcellular distribution of the protein. It remains possible that our localization of p66shc within the mitochondria is spurious and that the mitochondrial fractions used in our subcellular fractionation experiments were contaminated in some fashion, perhaps by the inadvertent inclusion of plasma membranes. Although this remains a possibility, several observations argue against this. First, previous experiments using perhaps the gold standard of subcellular localization, immunogold electron microscopy, have consistently detected p66shc within the mitochondria (25Giorgio M. Migliaccio E. Orsini F. Paolucci D. Moroni M. Contursi C. Pelliccia G. Luzi L. Minucci S. Marcaccio M. Pinton P. Rizzuto R. Bernardi P. Paolucci F. Pelicci P.G.

Trinei M. Bono M. Puri C. Tacchetti C. Ferrini M. Mannucci R. Nicoletti I. Lanfrancone L. Giorgio M. Pelicci P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25689-25695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Similarly, p66shc has been shown to form a molecular complex with the mitochondrial protein cytochrome c (25Giorgio M. Migliaccio E. Orsini F. Paolucci D. Moroni M. Contursi C. Pelliccia G. Luzi L. Minucci S. Marcaccio M. Pinton P. Rizzuto R. Bernardi P. Paolucci F. Pelicci P.G. Cell. 2005; 122: 221-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). Finally, analysis of our fractions suggests that, at least at the level of Western blot detection, the mitochondrial fractions are relatively free of contamination (supplemental Fig. 3). Nonetheless, until more information is known regarding the mechanisms underlying mitochondrial localization, we cannot conclusively state that the metabolic effects seen in our p66shc-/- cells are due to the absence of p66shc in the mitochondria rather then the absence of this protein in another subcellular compartment. The observations presented here suggest that p66shc may regulate the partition of ATP generation in the cell and that in the absence of p66shc, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is reduced, whereas the reliance on glycolysis is increased. Given that mitochondrial electron flow is the major producer of cellular ROS, these results may provide an explanation for the previous observation that p66shc-/- cells and animals have lower levels of ROS (8Nemoto S. Finkel T. Science. 2002; 295: 2450-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 15Migliaccio E. Giorgio M. Mele S. Pelicci G. Reboldi P. Pandolfi P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G.

It should be noted that our results were predominantly obtained in spontaneously immortalized MEFs. A similar albeit smaller role for p66shc in regulating oxygen consumption was also seen in PC12 cells (Fig. 2C). Our preliminary observations of oxygen consumption in primary MEFs derived from p66shc-/- animals suggest that the metabolic alterations are significantly less then what we observed in our immortalized MEFs (data not shown). Thus, the role of p66shc in mitochondrial metabolism may vary considerably between different cell types and even between primary and immortalized MEFs. Although considerable drift can occur with cell culture, the observation that reconstitution of p66shc in our spontaneously immortalized knock-out MEFs increases oxygen consumption (Fig. 2B) provides strong evidence for a continuous role of p66shc in the observed metabolic phenotype. Although to date, relatively few mammalian longevity genes have been determined, there is a much richer literature from other species such as nematodes. Although the requirement for oxygen and the ability to withstand prolonged hypoxia clearly differs between worms and higher mammals, it is interesting to note that a number of previously described C. elegans longevity mutants have altered mitochondrial metabolism (10Lee S.S. Lee R.Y. Fraser A.G. Kamath R.S. Ahringer J. Ruvkun G. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar, 11Hamilton B. Dong Y. Shindo M. Liu W. Odell I. Ruvkun G. Lee S.S. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1544-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Included among these is the isp-1 mutant, which has a defect in Complex III leading to decreased oxygen consumption and extended life (27Feng J. Bussiere F. Hekimi S. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 633-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Similarly, RNAi methods have determined that inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport or other essential mitochondrial proteins can often result in worms that have reduced oxygen consumption, lower ATP levels, and a corresponding increase in life span (12Dillin A. Hsu A.L. Arantes-Oliveira N. Lehrer-Graiwer J. Hsin H. Fraser A.G. Kamath R.S. Ahringer J. Kenyon C. Science. 2002; 298: 2398-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Thus, as recently hypothesized, reducing the level of mitochondrial metabolism may be an important way of extending the life span of lower organisms (13Rea S. Johnson T.E. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 197-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The results presented here, along with previous studies demonstrating an extended life span of p66shc-/- mice (15Migliaccio E. Giorgio M. Mele S. Pelicci G. Reboldi P. Pandolfi P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 1999; 402: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1479) Google Scholar), suggest that this paradigm may also be applicable to mammalian species.

However, the physiological role of CCN2 is largely unknown. As an initial approach to elucidate the physiological function of CCN2, mice deleted for the ccn2 gene were recently generated (5Ivkovic S. Yoon B.S. Popoff S.N. Safadi F.F. Libuda D.E. Stephenson R.C. Daluiski A. Lyons K.M. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 2779-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Mice homozygous for a deletion of the ccn2 gene die soon after birth, displaying an inability of the rib cage to ossify properly (5Ivkovic S. Yoon B.S. Popoff S.N. Safadi F.F. Libuda D.E. Stephenson R.C. Daluiski A. Lyons K.M. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 2779-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). The phenotype of these mice is consistent with a role for CCN2 in matrix synthesis and remodeling as ccn2–/–embryos show reduction in the expression of bone-specific matrix proteins, such as aggrecan (5Ivkovic S. Yoon B.S. Popoff S.N. Safadi F.F. Libuda D.E. Stephenson R.C. Daluiski A. Lyons K.M. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 2779-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). We recently found that embryonic fibroblasts isolated from ccn2–/–mice showed reduced basal adhesive signaling, including a reduction of FAK and ERK phosphorylation and delays in α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) stress fiber formation (6Chen Y.

Indeed, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detecting the amino-terminal portion of the CCN2 protein has indicated that the appearance of CCN2 in the blister fluid of scleroderma patients can be considered an excellent surrogate marker for the severity of skin fibrosis (12Dziadzio M. Usinger W. Leask A. Abraham D. Black C.M. Denton D. Stratton R. Q. J. Med. 2005; 98: 485-492Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). One of the most potent inducers of CCN2 is TGFβ, which promotes CCN2 expression in dermal fibroblasts, but not in epidermal keratinocytes, through a complex network of transcriptional interactions requiring Smads, protein kinase C, and Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase/ERK and a consensus transcription enhancer factor binding-element in the CCN2 promoter (11Holmes A.

CCN2 protein production in response to TGFβ does not occur in smad3–/– mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) or in the presence of the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitor U0126 (10Holmes A.

As CCN2 is induced by TGFβ, it has been hypothesized that CCN2 is a downstream mediator of TGFβ action (15Grotendorst G.R. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Indeed, this notion is the chief operating paradigm in the field. In fact, it is unclear whether physiologically CCN2 is a downstream mediator or co-activator of TGFβ action. Furthermore, the contribution of CCN2 to particular TGFβ signaling pathways is unknown. Finally, although CCN2 has been proposed to be required for TGFβ responses in fibroblasts, but not in epithelial cells (15Grotendorst G.R. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar), whether CCN2 is required for all, or a subset, of TGFβ responses in fibroblasts is completely unknown. In this study, we take advantage of the fact that CCN2 is expressed by MEFs and is induced by TGFβ in this cell type (10Holmes A. Abraham D.J. Sa S. Shi-wen X. Black C.M. Leask A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10594-10601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Consequently, examining the impact of loss of CCN2 expression by MEFs is likely to be a useful predictive tool to assess the impact of CCN2 in development, but should significantly affect our understanding of CCN2 action in pathological conditions where CCN2 is constitutively expressed, such as cancer and fibrosis (16Blom I.E. Goldschmeding R. Leask A. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Such an approach should also allow an appreciation of the potential effect of anti-CCN2 therapies on these pathologies. Thus, in this study, we perform Affymetrix gene profiling, Western blot, and real time (RT)-PCR analyses to evaluate the contribution of CCN2 to the activity of TGFβ in MEFs. Our results provide new insights into the role of CCN2 in mesenchymal biology. Cell Culture and Harvesting—ccn2+/+ and ccn2–/– MEFs (embryonic day 14.5) were isolated as described previously (5Ivkovic S. Yoon B.S. Popoff S.N. Safadi F.F. Libuda D.E. Stephenson R.C. Daluiski A. Lyons K.M. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 2779-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar) and grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l -glutamine, antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin), and 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen). Cells were grown at 37 °C, 5% CO2, harvested at 90–95% confluence, and washed twice in PBS. The cells were then scraped in PBS, and pellets were collected after centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 2% SDS, quantified (BCA kit; Pierce), and placed in Laemmli sample buffer containing complete protease and phosphates inhibitors mixture (Roche Applied Science). fak+/+ and fak–/– MEFs (American Type Culture Collection) were similarly cultured. Western Blot Analysis—Equal amounts of protein (20 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Gels were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose (Invitrogen). Membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma), and immunoblotting was performed using anti-phospho-ERK, anti-ERK, anti-FAK, or antiphospho-FAK antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-CCN2 (Abcam), anti-type I collagen (BIODESIGN International), anti-α-SMA, and anti-vinculin (Sigma) antibodies as described by the manufacturer. Anti-GAPDH and anti-vimentin (Sigma) antibodies were used as loading controls. Blots were then developed by incubation with biotinylated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies (1:1000; Vector Laboratories) as secondary antibodies, followed by incubation with ABC reagent (Vector Laboratories). Signal was detected using a luminescence kit (ECL kit; Amersham Biosciences) and x-ray film. Densitometry was performed using Gel Base/Gel-Blot Pro (Synoptics). Cell Transfections—Transfections of ccn2+/+ and ccn2–/– MEFs were performed essentially as described previously (11Holmes A. Abraham D.J. Chen Y. Denton C. Shi-Wen X. Black C.M. Leask A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13008-13015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 13Chen Y. Blom I.E. Sa S. Goldschmeding R. Abraham D.J. Leask A. Kidney Int. 2002; 62: 1149-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 105 cells were seeded into each well of a 6-well plate. The next day, cells were transfected using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) in a ratio of 3 μl of FuGENE per 2 μg of DNA (1.5 mg of reporter, 0.5 mg of CMV-β-galactosidase (Clontech)). Luciferase expression was determined and adjusted for β-galactosidase expression, which was used to control for differences in transfection efficiencies among wells (Applied Biosystems). Experiments were performed three times in triplicate. A representative experiment is shown. In rescue experiments, cells were similarly transfected with either a vector encoding constitutively active Akt1 or an empty expression vector (Upstate Biotechnology). Cells were incubated after transfection for 24 h in serum-free media, followed by further incubation in the presence or absence of 4 ng/ml TGFβ 1 for 6 h. RNA was harvested and subjected to real time-PCR analysis. To verify the functionality of the Akt1 construct, a reporter DNA construct containing multimers of an NFκB-responsive element upstream of the secreted enhanced alkaline phosphatase gene (NFκB-SEAP; Clontech) was transfected into NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (American Type Culture Collection) using PolyFect (Qiagen) at a ratio of 10 μl of PolyFect per 2 μg of DNA (0.25 mg of CMV-β-galactosidase; 0.25 mg of NFκB-SEAP; 1 μg of empty expression vector or expression vector containing constitutively active Akt1). RNA Quality Assessment, Probe Preparation, and GeneChip Hybridization and Analysis—Microarrays and analysis were performed essentially as described previously (17Shi-wen X. Howat S. Renzoni E. Holmes A. Pearson J. Bou-Gharios G. Eastwood M. duBois R. Black C.M. Leask A. Abraham D.J. J. Biol.

All GeneChips were processed at the London Regional Genomics Centre (Robarts Research Institute, London, Ontario, Canada). RNA was harvested (Trizol, Invitrogen) and quantified, and quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies Inc.) and the RNA 6000 Nano kit (Caliper Life Sciences). Quality data were then analyzed using the degradometer (mean degradation factor 1.99, S.D. 0.0678). Biotinylated cRNA was prepared from 10 μg of total RNA as per the Affymetrix GeneChip Technical Analysis Manual (Affymetrix). Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT)24 primers. Biotin-labeled cRNA was prepared by cDNA in vitro transcription using the Bizarre High Yield RNA Transcript Labeling kit (Enzo Brioche) incorporating biotinylated UTP and CTP. Fifteen μg of labeled cRNA was hybridized to Mouse Genome 430 2.0 GeneChips for 16 h at 45 °C as described in the Affymetrix Technical Analysis Manual (Affymetrix). GeneChips were stained with streptavidin/phycoerythrin, followed by an antibody solution, and a second streptavidin/phycoerythrin solution, with all liquid handling performed by a GeneChip Fluidics Station 450. GeneChips were scanned with the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Signal intensities for genes were generated using GCOS1.2 (Affymetrix) using default values for the statistical expression algorithm parameters and a target signal of 150 for all probe sets and a normalization value of 1. Normalization was performed in GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent Technologies Inc.). The Robust Multichip Average preprocessor was used to import data from the .cel files. Data were first transformed (measurements less than 0.01 set to 0.01) and then normalized per chip to the 50th percentile and per gene to wild-type control samples. Experiments were performed twice, and fold changes were identified using the GeneSpring filter. Data presented in Table 1 are an average of these independent studies. The fold change between treated and untreated samples had to be at least 2-fold to identify a transcript as being altered. These criteria had to be met in both sets of experiments. Clustering using gene ontologies was filtered using a 2-fold cutoff using the level two filtering parameter by the Affymetrix website. Probes annotated by the Gene Ontology Consortium were used. Categories that were considered over-represented in the set of transcripts that were CCN2-dependent had to have at least four members.TABLE 1Transcripts induced by TGFβ greater than 2-fold in Ccn2+/+ and Ccn2–/– MEFsAffymetrix IDFold change WTFold change KOGenBank™ accession no.DescriptionMatrix production, contraction, cell adhesion1419149_at1110NM_008871Serine (or cysteine) proteinase inhibitor, clade E, member 11449660_s_at77AW548837Coronin, actin-binding protein 1C1421315_s_at64BI688355Cortactin1423341_at67BB377873Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 41416741_at55AW744319Procollagen, type V, α11417500_a_at54BC016492Transglutaminase 2, C polypeptide1416687_at53BC021352Procollagen lysine, 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 21450379_at44NM_010833Moesin1419089_at44BI111620Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 31423407_a_at43BF228318Fibulin 21460302_at44AI385532Thrombospondin 11417534_at43NM_010580Integrin β51416157_at43NM_009502Vinculin1450944_at33BB377873Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 41419648_at33NM_008659Myosin IC1418726_a_at35NM_011619Troponin T2, cardiac1448228_at33M65143Lysyl oxidase1452469_a_at33BF578669Smoothelin1452783_at33AK005500Fibronectin type III domain containing 3B1426750_at33AW538200Filamin, β1452545_a_at32U37029Integrin β11451097_at32BC015289Vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein1427385_s_at22BC003232Actinin, α11425896_a_at22AF007248Fibrillin 11448346_at22NM_007687Cofilin 1, non-muscle1449335_at22BI111620Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 31417917_at22NM_009922Calponin 1Cell signaling1421207_at87AF065917Leukemia inhibitory factor1427682_a_at711X06746Early growth response 21417409_at55NM_010591jun oncogene1415899_at54NM_008416jun-B oncogene1418572_x_at45NM_013749Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 12a1449982_at45NM_008350Interleukin 111448593_at45NM_018865WNT1-inducible signaling pathway protein 11422865_at43NM_009821Runt-related transcription factor 11422414_a_at44NM_007589Calmodulin 21422485_at33AK004804SMAD 41418901_at33NM_009883CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), β1438133_a_at33BM202770Cysteine-rich protein 611448605_at34NM_007484Ras homolog gene family, member C1448594_at34NM_018865WNT1-inducible signaling pathway protein 11429046_at32BI697997Smurf21417148_at33NM_008809Platelet-derived growth factor receptor, β polypeptide1421534_at33NM_008016Fibroblast growth factor-inducible 151448694_at33NM_010591jun oncogene1423389_at33BF226166SMAD 71452163_at22BB151715Ets11428395_at23BB832916Smurf11448304_a_at55NM_024287RAB6, member RAS oncogene familyCell metabolism1438160_x_at187AV348121Solute carrier organic anion transporter family, member 4a11417730_at77NM_010162Exostoses (multiple) 11417262_at78M94967Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 21429776_a_at77AK005680DnaJ (Hsp40) homolog, subfamily B, member 61426645_at64AU079047Heat shock protein 1, α1450986_at55BB729616Nucleolar protein 51422459_a_at55NM_011875Proteasome 26 S subunit, non-ATPase, 131426790_at44BC024835Structure specific recognition protein 11439041_at32BM239325Solute carrier family 39 (zinc transporter), member 101417462_at43NM_007598CAP, adenylate cyclase-associated protein 1 Open table in a new tab Real Time-PCR—Cells were serum-starved for 24 h and treated with 4 ng of TGFβ for different lengths of time, as indicated. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen), and the integrity of the RNA was verified by gel electrophoresis or Agilent Bioanalyzer. For initial time course analysis, total RNA (25 ng) was reverse-transcribed and amplified using TaqMan Assays on Demand (Applied Biosystems) in a 15-μl reaction volume containing two unlabeled primers and 6-carboxyfluorescein-labeled TaqMan MGB probe. Samples were combined with TaqMan one-step mastermix (Applied Biosystems). Amplified sequences were detected using the ABI Prism 7900 HT sequence detector (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Triplicate samples were run; transcripts were measured in picograms, and expression values were standardized to values obtained with control 28 S RNA primers as described previously (19Stanton L.A. Sabari S. Sampaio A.V. Underhill T.M. Beier F. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was performed by the Student's paired t test. Adhesion Assay—Adhesion assays were performed essentially as described (6Chen Y. Abraham D.J. Shi-wen X. Black C.M. Lyons K.M. Leask A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5635-5646Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). 96-Well plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with 4 μg/ml type I collagen, 4 μg/ml fibronectin, or 4 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in 1× PBS. Nonspecific binding sites on substrates were blocked for 1 h in 1% BSA in PBS at room temperature prior to addition of cells. Fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM, 0.5% fetal calf serum for 24 h and then were harvested with 2 mm EDTA in PBS (20 min, room temperature), washed twice with DMEM containing 0.5% BSA (Sigma), and resuspended in the same medium at 2.5 × 105 cells/ml. Cells (100 μl/well) were added to wells of the 96-well plate and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. An acid phosphatase assay was used, in which adherent cells were quantified by incubation with 100 μl of substrate solution (0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, and 0.1% Triton X-100) for 2 h at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 15 μl of 1 n NaOH/well, and A450 was measured. Statistical analysis was performed by the Student's unpaired t test. CCN2 Is Required for the Ability of TGFβ to Induce α-SMA and Type I Collagen but Is Not Required for Induction of MMP-3 or a Smad3-responsive Promoter—CCN2 protein is induced by TGFβ yet is expressed at a basal level in MEFs (9Igarashi A. Nashiro K. Kikuchi K. Sato S. Ihn H. Grotendorst G.R. Takehara K. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 280-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). To assess whether CCN2 was required for transcriptional responses to TGFβ, real time-PCR was performed on mRNAs prepared at various time points after TGFβ treatment of ccn2+/+ and ccn2–/– MEFs. Primers detecting matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), COL1A1, COL1A2, and α-SMA were selected for these initial analyses, given that these are known markers of an activated fibroblast (20Gabbiani G. J. Pathol. 2003; 200: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). To our surprise, the ability of TGFβ to induce COL1A1, COL1A2, and α-SMA was impaired even at the earliest time points, paralleling the induction of CCN2 mRNA in ccn2+/+ fibroblasts (Fig. 2). Results were confirmed using Western blot analyses employing anti-α-SMA and anti-type I collagen antibodies (Fig. 1). Conversely, TGFβ was able to induce MMP-3 in the absence of CCN2 (Fig. 2). These results suggest that the ability of CCN2 to mediate TGFβ-induced gene expression is dependent on the basal, constitutive expression of CCN2 by MEFs rather than on the TGFβ-induced increment of CCN2 expression. Given that MMP-3 was induced by TGFβ in ccn2–/– MEFs, these results suggest that CCN2 is not generally required for TGFβ-dependent transcriptional responses but, in the context of MEFs, that CCN2 may be a cofactor for TGFβ action.FIGURE 2RT-PCR time course analysis of the induction by TGFβ1 of mRNAs in ccn2+/+ and ccn2–/– MEFs. CCN2 is a co-factor for the TGFβ1 induction of a subset of mRNAs. MEFs isolated from ccn2+/+ and ccn2–/–mice dermal fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM, 0.5% FBS for 24 h and treated for TGFβ1 (4 ng/ml) for 2, 6, and 24 h. RT-PCR was used to detect CCN2, αSMA, COL1A1, COL1A2, and MMP-3 mRNA. Induction of α-SMA, COL1A1, and COL1A2 depended on CCN2, as addition of TGFβ to ccn2–/– MEFs impaired the induction of these mRNA at all time points tested, paralleling the induction of CCN2 mRNA. Note that TGFβ induction of MMP-3 mRNA occurred in ccn2–/– MEFs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm the notion that CCN2 was not generally required for the ability of TGFβ to induce gene expression, ccn2+/+ and ccn2–/–fibroblasts were transfected with a DNA construct bearing multiple copies of a Smad-responsive element subcloned upstream of the luciferase reporter gene (SBE-lux; Fig. 3). This element is responsive to activation of the Smad3 pathway, which is required for TGFβ responses in fibroblasts (21Piek E. Ju W.J. Heyer J. Escalante-Alcalde D. Stewart C.L. Weinstein M. Deng C. Kucherlapati R. Bottinger E.P. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19945-19953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The generic TGFβ-responsive Smad signaling pathway was fully active in ccn2–/– MEFs as the ability of the Smad reporter to respond to TGFβ was not impaired in ccn2–/– MEFs (Fig. 3). Collectively, these results suggest that CCN2 was not generally required for TGFβ signaling in fibroblasts but instead affects a specific subset of TGFβ-dependent responses. Affymetrix Gene Profiling of Ccn2+/+ and Ccn2–/–Fibroblasts Reveal Novel Genes Whose Induction by TGFβ Is CCN2-dependent—To evaluate to what extent CCN2 was required for the ability of TGFβ to induce gene expression by MEFs, we cultured ccn2+/+ and ccn2–/– MEFs until 80% confluence and serum-starved cells for 24 h. Cells were then treated in the presence or absence of TGFβ (4 ng/ml) for an additional 6 h. This time point was chosen because our real time-PCR analysis indicated that TGFβ responses in MEFs were maximal at 6 h. Total RNA was prepared from these cells, reverse-transcribed, and applied to Affymetrix MOE430 arrays. Experiments were performed twice, and average induction values were obtained. Analysis of data by GeneSpring revealed TGFβ induced 942 transcripts greater than 2-fold in ccn2+/+ fibroblasts. Of these 345 were not induced in ccn2–/–fibroblasts. A representative selection of transcripts is shown in Tables 1 and 2. That the majority of TGFβ-induced genes in ccn2+/+ were also induced in ccn2–/– MEFs supported our initial impression that CCN2 was not generally required for the ability of TGFβ to induce gene expression. Pro-fibrotic (adhesion, contraction, and matrix) genes, as revealed by cluster analysis, were revealed to be both independent and dependent on CCN2 (Tables 1 and 2). Similarly, genes involved with cell signaling and metabolism were both independent and dependent on CCN2 (Tables 1 and 2). No significant physiological grouping specific to ccn2-dependent or ccn2-independent genes emerged. However, analysis of functional clusters indicated that genes significantly over-represented in the group nonresponsive to TGFβ in ccn2–/–fibroblasts were those involved with RNA processing and transcription. A complete list of these mRNAs is shown in Table 3. These results indicated that loss of CCN2 expression in MEFs is likely to both directly and indirectly affect gene expression in response to TGFβ (Tables 2 and 3).TABLE 2Transcripts induced by TGFβ1>2-fold in Ccn2+/+ MEFs but <2-fold in Ccn2–/– MEFsAffymetrix IDFold change WTFold change KOGenBank™ accession no.DescriptionMatrix production, contraction, cell adhesion1445534_at51.5BM206272Filamin, β1430533_a_at41.5BI134907Catenin β1448383_at31.5NM_008608Matrix metalloproteinase 141426519_at31.5AI314028Proline 4-hydroxylase, α11416572_at31NM_008608Matrix metalloproteinase 141418230_a_at31BC005621LIM and senescent cell antigen-like domains 11445965_at31BB037433RIKEN cDNA C920027118 gene1431834_a_at21AK020015Elastin microfibril interfacer 1 (Emilin 1)1456623_at21.5BM232388Tropomyosin 1, α1438556_a_at11BB224629Tropomodulin 31418440_at21NM_007739Procollagen, type VIII, α1Cell signaling"
https://openalex.org/W2044950028,"Motexafin gadolinium (MGd) is a chemotherapeutic drug that selectively targets tumor cells and mediates redox reactions generating reactive oxygen species. Thioredoxin (Trx), NADPH, and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) of the cytosol/nucleus or mitochondria are major thiol-dependent reductases with many functions in cell growth, defense against oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Mammalian TrxRs are selenocysteine-containing flavoenzymes; MGd was an NADPH-oxidizing substrate for human or rat TrxR1 with a Km value of 8.65 μm (kcat/Km of 4.86 × 104 m–1 s–1). The reaction involved redox cycling of MGd by oxygen producing superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. MGd acted as a non-competitive inhibitor (IC50 of 6 μm) for rat TrxR. In contrast, direct reaction between MGd and reduced human Trx was negligible. The corresponding reaction with reduced Escherichia coli Trx was also negligible, but MGd was a better substrate (kcat/Km of 2.23 × 105 m–1 s–1) for TrxR from E. coli and a strong inhibitor of Trx-dependent protein disulfide reduction. Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), a 1:1 complex of the non-identical R1- and R2-subunits, catalyzes the essential de novo synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides for DNA synthesis using electrons from Trx and TrxR. MGd inhibited recombinant mouse RNR activity with either 3 μm reduced human Trx (IC50 2 μm) or 4 mm dithiothreitol (IC50 6 μm) as electron donors. Our results demonstrate MGd-induced enzymatic generation of reactive oxygen species by TrxR plus a powerful inhibition of RNR. This may explain the effects of the drug on cancer cells, which often overproduce TrxR and have induced RNR for replication and repair. Motexafin gadolinium (MGd) is a chemotherapeutic drug that selectively targets tumor cells and mediates redox reactions generating reactive oxygen species. Thioredoxin (Trx), NADPH, and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) of the cytosol/nucleus or mitochondria are major thiol-dependent reductases with many functions in cell growth, defense against oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Mammalian TrxRs are selenocysteine-containing flavoenzymes; MGd was an NADPH-oxidizing substrate for human or rat TrxR1 with a Km value of 8.65 μm (kcat/Km of 4.86 × 104 m–1 s–1). The reaction involved redox cycling of MGd by oxygen producing superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. MGd acted as a non-competitive inhibitor (IC50 of 6 μm) for rat TrxR. In contrast, direct reaction between MGd and reduced human Trx was negligible. The corresponding reaction with reduced Escherichia coli Trx was also negligible, but MGd was a better substrate (kcat/Km of 2.23 × 105 m–1 s–1) for TrxR from E. coli and a strong inhibitor of Trx-dependent protein disulfide reduction. Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), a 1:1 complex of the non-identical R1- and R2-subunits, catalyzes the essential de novo synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides for DNA synthesis using electrons from Trx and TrxR. MGd inhibited recombinant mouse RNR activity with either 3 μm reduced human Trx (IC50 2 μm) or 4 mm dithiothreitol (IC50 6 μm) as electron donors. Our results demonstrate MGd-induced enzymatic generation of reactive oxygen species by TrxR plus a powerful inhibition of RNR. This may explain the effects of the drug on cancer cells, which often overproduce TrxR and have induced RNR for replication and repair. Texaphyrins are porphyrin-like synthetic macrocycles that form highly stable complexes with large metal cations (1Sessler J.L. Miller R.A. Biochem.

MGd (see Fig. 1), similar to porphyrins (4Zawirska B. Neoplasma (Bratisl.). 1979; 26: 223-229PubMed Google Scholar), selectively targets tumor cells by an unknown mechanism. Drug localization in tumors has been confirmed in animal models and in human clinical trials using magnetic resonance imaging, which detects the paramagnetic gadolinium ion (5Young S.W. Qing F.

MGd is easily reduced (half-wave potential 50 mV versus normal hydrogen electrode), and in vitro, it may catalyze slow oxidation of intracellular reducing metabolites such as ascorbate, GSH, and NADPH, generating superoxide and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a process called futile redox cycling (6Magda D.

Recently, MGd has been shown to disrupt zinc metabolism and induce oxidative stress in human cancer cell lines (11Magda D. Lecane P. Miller R.A. Lepp C. Miles D. Mesfin M. Biaglow J.E. Ho V.V. Chawannakul D. Nagpal S. Karaman M.W. Hacia J.G. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 3837-3845Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These studies showed increased levels of intracellular free zinc, increased metallothionein transcripts, inhibition of thioredoxin reductase, and cell death following incubation of human lung carcinoma cells with MGd in the presence of exogenous zinc acetate (11Magda D.

These findings could possibly result from oxidation of vicinal thiols or generation of ROS, but the in vivo mechanisms are still largely unknown. We hypothesized that MGd may target ribonucleotide reductase, thioredoxin (Trx), or thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) (12Jordan A. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 71-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 13Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Arner E.S.J. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6102-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1996) Google Scholar). All these enzymes have redox-active Cys residues and are central to cell growth and survival. The thioredoxin system, comprising Trx, TrxR, and NADPH, acts as a general protein disulfide reductase, where reduced Trx (Trx-(SH)2) is used to reduce protein disulfides to protein dithiols (protein-(SH)2) and Trx-S2 is reduced by TrxR using electrons from NADPH (13Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Arner E.S.J. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6102-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1996) Google Scholar).

Trx-(SH)2+Protein-S2→Trx-S2+Protein-(SH)2REACTION 1 Trx-S2+NADPH+H+→TrxRTrx-(SH)2+NADP+REACTION 2 The Trx system participates in a large number of biological functions via its protein disulfide reductase activity, involving thioredoxin peroxidases (peroxiredoxins), methionine sulfoxide reductases, regulation of transcription factors, ribonucleotide reduction, and DNA synthesis or selenium metabolism (14Arner E.S.J.

Mammalian TrxR enzymes in the cytosol/nucleus (TrxR1) or mitochondria (TrxR2) are selenoproteins with a selenocysteine (Sec) in the active site (-Gly-Cys-Sec-Gly) and have a broad substrate specificity (19Zhong L.

Increased levels of Trx have been reported in many different tumors with a correlation to malignancy and poor prognosis (21Berggren M. Gallegos A. Gasdaska J.R. Gasdaska P.Y. Warneke J. Powis G.

Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), another target for antitumor therapy and a key S-phase enzyme reducing all four ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides with electrons from Trx-(SH)2, is essential for DNA synthesis (27Eklund H. Uhlin U. Farnegardh M. Logan D.T. Nordlund P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2001; 77: 177-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 28Kolberg M. Strand K.R. Graff P. Andersson K.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1699: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). A compound that interferes with the activity of RNR leads to the inhibition of DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. In this report, we show that MGd is a substrate for mammalian TrxR, generating reactive oxygen species. It also acts as an inhibitor of Trx-dependent disulfide reduction by blocking reduction of Trx-S2. No reaction was found between Trx-(SH)2 and MGd. RNR was also strongly inhibited by MGd. We believe that these results are important to explain the mechanism of action of MGd on tumor cells. Materials—MGd was obtained from Pharmacyclics, Inc (Sunnyvale, CA) as a stock solution dissolved in 5% aqueous mannitol at a concentration of 2.3 mg/ml (2 mm). Bovine serum albumin, DTNB, DTT, insulin, NADPH, glucose-6-phosphate, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were purchased from Sigma. [3H]CDP and PD-10 Sephadex G-25 columns were from Amersham Biosciences. Amplex® Red hydrogen peroxide/peroxidase assay kit was from Molecular Probes. Escherichia coli Trx1 and TrxR (29Holmgren A. Björnstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar), human Trx1, and the double mutant C61S/C72S were prepared as described (30Ren X. Björnstedt M. Shen B. Ericson M.L. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9701-9708Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Calf thymus, human placenta TrxR1, as well as rat recombinant TrxR1 (31Arner E.S. Sarioglu H.

E. coli RNR (32Sjoberg B.M. Loehr T.M. Sanders-Loehr J. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) was a kind gift of Prof. Britt-Marie Sjöberg, and mouse R1 and R2 proteins of RNR were expressed and purified and the R2 protein activated as described by Thelander and co-workers (33Davis R. Thelander M. Mann G.J. Behravan G. Soucy F. Beaulieu P. Lavallee P. Gräslund A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23171-23176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Mann G.J.

The E. coli strains expressing the subunits were kind gifts from Prof. Lars Thelander, Umeå University. Spectrophotometric Measurements—The spectra of 20 μm MGd, with and without 1 mm DTT, were recorded at 25 °C in 50 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5 (TE buffer), in 1-cm semimicro quartz cuvettes, using a Shimadzu UV2100 spectrophotometer. Other measurements were made with a recording Zeiss PMQ III spectrophotometer. Oxidation of NADPH by MGd—Assays were carried out in a total volume of 0.50 ml, containing 100 μm NADPH, 50 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, and different concentrations of MGd. MGd was excluded from the reference cuvette. The reaction was initiated by adding 0.2 μm rat TrxR or 0.015 μm E. coli TrxR to the reference and reaction cuvettes, after which NADPH oxidation was followed at 340 nm. A molar extinction coefficient of 6200 m–1cm–1 was used in calculations. Production of H2O2 by Redox Cycling of MGd—This assay was performed in TE buffer with 200 μm NADPH, 20 μm MGd, and 0.2 μm rat TrxR, under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. Anaerobic conditions were generated by using degassed and nitrogen-equilibrated buffers and special cuvettes covered by rubber septa. After following the consumption of NADPH at A340 nm, the reactions were terminated, and the concentration of H2O2 was measured using Amplex® Red hydrogen peroxide/peroxidase assay kit, according to the protocol from Molecular Probes. Oxidation of Trx-(SH)2 by MGd—E. coli or human Trx (0.5 mm) was reduced with 5 mm DTT for 30 min under nitrogen, after which DTT was removed by running the sample through a Sephadex G-25 column, with nitrogen-equilibrated TE buffer. After mixing 20 μm Trx-(SH)2 and 20 μm MGd in potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, or in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, with or without 1 mm EDTA, oxidation of reduced Trx was measured as the decrease of SH groups over time, after stopping the reaction with 6 m guanidine hydrochloride in TE buffer containing 1 mm DTNB. We used a molar extinction coefficient at 412 nm of 13.600 m–1 cm–1 for each SH group. Binding between MGd and TrxR—MGd bound to Sephadex and Sepharose resins in a saturable way. A PD-10 Sephadex G-25 desalting column was equilibrated with 40 μm MGd in TE buffer until the absorbance at 470 nm was constant in the eluate. Then, a mixture of 40 μm MGd and 4 μm rat TrxR or 40 μm MGd and 0.4 μm E. coli TrxR in a final volume of 0.50 ml of TE buffer was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C and applied to the column. Fractions of 0.50 ml were collected by eluting the column by TE buffer containing 40 μm MGd, and the absorbance at 280 and 470 nm was recorded. Protein Disulfide Reduction Using Insulin—This assay was performed to measure the activity of Trx or TrxR (Reactions 1 and 2) as described (29Holmgren A. Björnstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). A total volume of 120 μl was generated, containing 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm NADPH, 0.3 mm insulin, 1.8 μm Trx, and 0–140 μm MGd. The reaction was initiated by adding 5 nm rat TrxR to all tubes. After 20 min, the reaction was terminated by adding 500 μl of 1 mm DTNB in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride in TE buffer (pH 8.0); thereafter, the amount of generated insulin SH groups was measured at A412 nm and quantified by the molar extinction coefficient of 13600 m–1 cm–1 for 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoic acid (29Holmgren A. Björnstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). All kinetic experiments were performed at 20 °C. Both reference and reaction cuvettes contained MGd. Disulfide Reduction Assay with an NADPH Regenerating System—The catalytic activity of TrxR with Trx (Reactions 1 and 2) in the presence of MGd with varying NADPH was tested using glucose-6-phosphate to regenerate NADPH (35Prongay A.J. Engelke D.R. Williams Jr., C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2656-2664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This experiment was performed in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, 1.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm glucose-6-phosphate, 0.2 units/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 0.2 mm insulin, 10 μm human Trx, and varying concentrations of NADPH (0.25–50 μm). After initiating the reactions by adding 10 nm TrxR, the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, and reactions were terminated by the addition of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 1 mm DTNB in TE buffer to the samples, and the absorbance at A412 nm was determined to measure insulin SH groups. TrxR Activity by DTNB Reduction—In a final volume of 0.50 ml, 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTNB, 0.2 mm NADPH, and varying concentrations of MGd were mixed. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 15 nm rat TrxR to all cuvettes except the reference, and A412 nm was recorded for 5 min. Ribonucleotide Reductase Assay—RNR activity was determined by following the conversion of [3H]CDP into [3H]dCDP with mouse RNR according to the methods of Thelander and co-workers (33Davis R. Thelander M. Mann G.J. Behravan G. Soucy F. Beaulieu P. Lavallee P. Gräslund A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23171-23176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Mann G.J. Gräslund A. Ochiai E. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Reducing equivalents were provided through either 4 mm DTT or 3 μm human Trx and 0.1 μm calf liver TrxR and 1 mm NADPH. The reaction was initiated by adding mouse RNR (5.5 μg of R1 and 2.1 μg of R2) (33Davis R. Thelander M. Mann G.J. Behravan G. Soucy F. Beaulieu P. Lavallee P. Gräslund A. Thelander L. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) to the reaction mixture containing 40 mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.5, 2 mm ATP, 10 mm magnesium chloride, 200 mm potassium chloride, and 0.5 mm [3H]CDP (23,000 cpm/nmol) in a final volume of 50 μl. Samples were incubated at 37 °C, and the reaction was terminated after 30 min by the addition of 1 m HClO4 followed by acid hydrolysis. The amount of [3H]dCDP formed was calculated from the results of liquid scintillation counting after ion-exchange chromatography separation of the monophosphates on Dowex-50 columns. Statistical Analysis—Nonlinear least-squares curve fitting and error calculations were done using the software package Grace. The Ultraviolet and Visible Spectrum of MGd—MGd has a strong green color, and as seen from the spectrum (Fig. 1), there was a relatively strong absorbance at 340 and 412 nm, which are wavelengths for spectrophotometric assays of the oxidation of NADPH or sulfhydryl groups by DTNB, respectively (29Holmgren A. Björnstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Adding 1 mm DTTtoa20 μm MGd solution resulted in no change of the spectrum after 30 min. The dithiol DTT is known to be a slow reductant of MGd, but regeneration of the parent molecule by oxygen-dependent redox cycling obviously is quickly generating ROS (6Magda D. Lepp C. Gerasimchuk N. Lee I. Sessler J.L. Lin A. Biaglow J.E. Miller R.A. Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 2001; 51: 1025-1036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In our studies, we measured redox reactions at 340 nm in the presence of MGd and the Trx system without any corrections due to spectral changes in MGd. MGd as a Substrate for Thioredoxin Reductase—MGd is supplied as a solution in mannitol, and previous measurements of the redox properties of the molecule using an oxygen electrode have been made in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl (6Magda D. Lepp C. Gerasimchuk N. Lee I. Sessler J.L. Lin A. Biaglow J.E. Miller R.A. Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 2001; 51: 1025-1036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Initial experiments using this buffer with NADPH and 0.2 μm rat TrxR showed oxidation of NADPH at 340 nm. The addition of 1 mm EDTA, a standard condition for assays of Trx and TrxR (29Holmgren A. Björnstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar), did not inhibit the reaction as if MGd was not complexed but rather slightly stimulated the reaction rate. This may be due to complexation of heavy metal ions in buffer salts, which may inhibit TrxR. Buffers used in the present study therefore all contained EDTA. As seen in Fig. 2A, the addition of increasing amounts of MGd resulted in a saturable oxidation of NADPH. Examination of the data with Michaelis-Menten kinetics yielded an apparent Km value of 8.65 μm, a kcat of 0.42 × s–1, and a kcat/Km of × 104 4.86 m–1 s–1 for the rat TrxR1. The addition of up to 10 μm human Trx1 did not stimulate the reaction. The pure human placenta TrxR (29Holmgren A. Björnstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar) showed a similar activity as the rat recombinant enzyme (data not shown). To test whether the smaller non-selenium-dependent prokaryotic TrxR from E. coli (14Arner E.S.J. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6102-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1996) Google Scholar) used MGd as a substrate, the same experiments were performed. As shown in Fig. 2B, MGd acted faster with the E. coli enzyme, and a Km value of 22.1 μm, a kcat of 4.93 × s–1, and a kcat/Km of 2.23 × 105 m–1 s–1 were calculated. As in the case of mammalian TrxR, the addition of E. coli Trx1 did not increase the reaction rate. In conclusion, the slow oxidation of NADPH by MGd described previously (6Magda D. Lepp C. Gerasimchuk N. Lee I. Sessler J.L. Lin A. Biaglow J.E. Miller R.A. Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 2001; 51: 1025-1036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) is dramatically increased by the addition of catalytic amounts of TrxR. Surprisingly, E. coli TrxR, which usually is highly specific (14Arner E.S.J. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6102-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1996) Google Scholar, 29Holmgren A. Björnstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar) had a higher catalytic efficiency than the selenocysteine-containing mammalian TrxR. MGd Redox Cycling Leads to Production of Hydrogen Peroxide—MGd takes electrons from NADPH, which was catalyzed by TrxR. Then, MGd reacts with oxygen to be regenerated by redox cycling (6Magda D. Lepp C. Gerasimchuk N. Lee I. Sessler J.L. Lin A. Biaglow J.E. Miller R.A. Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 2001; 51: 1025-1036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This phenomenon leads to the production of reactive oxygen species, including superoxide (Reaction 3) and hydrogen peroxide by spontaneous decay of superoxide (Reaction 4). NADPH+H++2O2→MGdNADP++2O2·-+2H+REACTION 3 2O2·-+2H+→H2O2+O2REACTION 4 Previous results showed that MGd leads to O2 consumption in the presence of NADPH as detected with an oxygen electrode (6Magda D. Lepp C. Gerasimchuk N. Lee I. Sessler J.L. Lin A. Biaglow J.E. Miller R.A. Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 2001; 51: 1025-1036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Our results showed that the addition of TrxR dramatically accelerates NADPH oxidation (Reaction 3). This reaction was studied under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, using 200 μm NADPH, 20 μm MGd, and 0.2 μm rat-TrxR. Only in the presence of oxygen did significant NADPH oxidation occur (Fig. 3). The reaction was further analyzed after another 6 h, when more than 150 μm NADPH had been oxidized. The cuvette then contained 50 μm H2O2, which was determined using a hydrogen peroxide assay. This amount of reaction products is rather low, which can be explained by H2O2 being a direct substrate for mammalian TrxR, yielding H2O, thus removing H2O2 (19Zhong L. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18121-18128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The Reaction between MGd and Thioredoxin Is Surprisingly Slow—As mentioned above, the addition of 10 μm reduced Trx to the reaction with TrxR did not increase the rate of NADPH oxidation. This was unexpected since Trx is generally a fast disulfide reductant (13Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Arner E.S.J. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6102-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1996) Google Scholar). To study the reaction between Trx and MGd, we generated reduced Trx1 by incubating with excess DTT and removed the reductant by gel chromatography. Then, 20 μm Trx-(SH)2 and 20 μm MGd were mixed in TE buffer followed by determination of free SH groups in Trx by using 1 mm DTNB in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride. The result of this analysis showed that the half-life of the reaction was more then 20 min, indicating that the reaction is very slow. This experiment was repeated several times with E. coli as well as human Trx1 under different conditions, with and without EDTA, and at different temperatures. No reaction was observed. In addition, there was no evidence of complex formation between MGd and reduced or oxidized Trx using the gel chromatography method described later. Characterization of the Reaction between MGd and Mammalian Thioredoxin Reductase—MGd induced an NADPH oxidase activity in TrxR similar to the effect of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNCB), which acts as an irreversible inhibitor of human TrxR with loss of Trx disulfide reductase activity but induction of a 34-fold higher NADPH oxidase activity (36Arner E.S. Björnstedt M. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3479-3482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the reaction between TrxR and MGd required the active enzyme, 100 μm DNCB was added to TrxR and NADPH. The DNCB-modified enzyme without Trx disulfide reductase activity showed no reaction with MGd and NADPH at 340 nm above the control. However, if fresh TrxR was added, a reaction with MGd was observed (data not shown). DNCB alkylates the active site selenocysteine and cysteine residues of the enzyme (37Nordberg J. Zhong L. Holmgren A. Arner E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10835-10842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and therefore, an interaction of MGd with the FAD or alternative redox active disulfide of the enzyme to oxidize NADPH-generating ROS is excluded. Further evidence that the reaction between TrxR and MGd required the fully active enzyme was that a mutant TrxR with the Sec-498 → Cys mutation (19Zhong L. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18121-18128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), with a 100-fold lower kcat for Trx reduction than the wild type rat enzyme, did not show any reactivity with MGd (data not shown). MGd Binds to Thioredoxin Reductase—MGd and TrxR were co-incubated, after which dialysis membranes or gel filtration columns were used to separate excess drug. However, we found that MGd binds to dialysis membranes and plastic surfaces as well as Sephadex columns. To overcome this, we equilibrated an 8.3-ml PD-10 Sephadex G-25 column by running 40 μm MGd in TE buffer until a constant absorbance at 470 nm was reached. Then, enzyme incubated with MGd was added to the green-colored PD-10 column, and a chromatogram was generated. The peak at 470 nm of MGd co-eluted with protein at 280 nm (Fig. 4A), indicating that MGd bound to rat TrxR, and a corresponding trough was present at the low molecular weight eluted fractions. In fact, E. coli TrxR (Fig. 4B) bound more MGd, and a calculation showed that approximately up to six molecules of MGd were eluted per enzyme dimer. In contrast, the rat TrxR1 enzyme gave a ratio of 1.4:1, indicating a smaller amount of MGd bound. MGd Inhibits the Activity of the Thioredoxin System—The Trx system is an NADPH-dependent general disulfide reductase (13Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237"
https://openalex.org/W2070730866,"Abstract Four phosphinic peptide libraries with compounds having the general formula p-Br-Ph-(PO2-CH2)-Xaa′-Yaa′-Zaa′-NH2 have been prepared and screened against 10 matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). We identified two phosphinic peptides with Ki values of 0.19 and 4.4 nm toward MMP-12 (macrophage elastase) that are more than 2-3 orders of magnitude less potent toward the other MMPs tested. These highly selective MMP-12 inhibitors contain a Glu-Glu motif in their Yaa′-Zaa′ positions. Incorporation of this Glu-Glu motif into the sequence of a nonspecific fluorogenic peptide cleaved by MMPs provides a highly selective substrate for MMP-12. A model of one of these inhibitors interacting with MMP-12 suggests that the selectivity observed might be due, in part, to the presence of two unique polar residues in MMP-12, Thr239 and Lys177. These MMP-12-selective inhibitors may have important therapeutic applications to diseases in which MMP-12 has been suggested to play a key role, such as in emphysema, atherosclerosis, and aortic abdominal aneurysm."
https://openalex.org/W2105828700,"Toll-like receptor (TLR) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) signaling pathways are important for both innate and adaptive immune responses. However, the cross-talk between these two signaling pathways is incompletely understood. Here we show that IFN-γ and LPS synergistically induce the expression of proinflammatory factors, including interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, IL-12, NO, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Comparable synergism was observed between IFN-γ and peptidoglycan (PGN; a TLR2 ligand) and poly(I:C) (a TLR3 ligand) in the induction of IL-12 promoter activity. IFN-γ enhanced lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ERK and JNK phosphorylation but had no effect on LPS-induced NF-κB activation. Interestingly, we found that IRF-8–/– macrophages were impaired in the activation of LPS-induced ERK and JNK and the production of proinflammatory cytokines induced by LPS or IFN-γ plus LPS. Retroviral transduction of IRF-8 into IRF-8–/– macrophages rescued ERK and JNK activation. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation experiments show that IRF-8 physically interacts with TRAF6 at a binding site between amino acid residues 356 and 305 of IRF-8. Transfection of IRF-8 enhanced TRAF6 ubiquitination, which is consistent with a physical interaction of IRF-8 with TRAF6. Taken together, the results suggest that the interaction of IRF-8 with TRAF6 modulates TLR signaling and may contribute to the cross-talk between IFN-γ and TLR signal pathways.

Accumulating evidence indicates that activation of the innate immune system is a prerequisite for the induction of acquired immunity, particularly for the induction of a T helper 1 (Th1) immune response (4Iwasaki A. Medzhitov R. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 987-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (3368) Google Scholar). The TLRs are type I integral membrane glycoproteins, and on the basis of considerable homology in the cytoplasmic region, they are members of a superfamily that includes the interleukin-1 receptor. Eleven members of the TLR family have been identified in mammals (3Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6751) Google Scholar). The signal pathway activated by TLR stimulation involves, including TIR domain-containing adaptors, IL-1 receptor-associated kinases, and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) (5Takeda K. Akira S. Semin. Immunol. 2004; 16: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1870) Google Scholar). TLR stimulation results in the activation of NF-κB and MAP kinases, leading to production of proinflammatory factors, including IL-1, IL-6, NO, IL-12, and TNF-α. Although the innate immune response triggered by TLRs is necessary for host defense against various pathogens, it is not sufficient to clear infection by intracellular bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes. Either a Th1 immune response or the Th1 cytokine, IFN-γ, is required to eliminate intracellular bacterial pathogens (6Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 129-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar, 7Pamer E.G. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 812-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). This suggests that the TLR signaling pathway works synergistically with other pathways to arm macrophages for efficient clearance of pathogens. However, the cross-talk of the TLR pathway with other signaling pathways is incompletely understood. Responses to IFNα/β and IFN-γ are vital for both innate and adaptive immunity (8Le Page C. Genin P. Baines M.G. Hiscott J. Rev. Immunogenet. 2000; 2: 374-386PubMed Google Scholar, 9Ansel K.M. Lee D.U. Rao A. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 616-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). IFN signaling involves a variety of trans- and cis-acting factors and is mediated through DNA motifs, designated the IFN-stimulated response element and IFN-γ-activated sequence, found in promoters of IFN-inducible genes (10Pestka S. Krause C.D. Walter M.R. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 202: 8-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). These genes play prominent roles in the control of growth, differentiation, and activation of the immune system. The IRF-8/interferon consensus sequence-binding protein belongs to the IFN regulatory factor (IRF) family of transcription factors, which has 10 members (11Nguyen H. Hiscott J. Pitha P.M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 293-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 12Barnes B. Lubyova B. Pitha P.M. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 59-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Early reports suggested that IRF-8 is a negative regulator of gene promoters containing an IFN-stimulated response element (13Weisz A. Marx P. Sharf R. Appella E. Driggers P.H. Ozato K. Levi B.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25589-25596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Weisz A. Kirchhoff S. Levi B.Z. Int.

However, recent studies indicate a more complex role in both immunity and cell-cycle regulation (16Tamura T. Nagamura-Inoue T. Shmeltzer Z. Kuwata T. Ozato K. Immunity. 2000; 13: 155-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 17Tamura T. Ozato K. J.

IRF-8-deficient mice are highly susceptible to several pathogens, including Listeria monocytogenes and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, due to defects in both innate and adaptive immunity (20Scharton-Kersten T. Contursi C. Masumi A. Sher A. Ozato K. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1523-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 21Taniguchi T. Ogasawara K. Takaoka A. Tanaka N. Annu. Rev.

Med. 1997; 185: 921-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Macrophages from IRF-8–/– mice do not produce IL-12 in response to IFN-γ and LPS. IL-12 transcription is controlled by multiple transcription factors. The loss of IRF-8 binding to an IFN-stimulated response element site in the IL-12 promoter region in IRF8-deficient macrophages results in a defect in IL-12 production. However, this evidence does not necessarily rule out the possibility that IRF-8 may also affect upstream signaling pathways leading to IL-12 production. In addition, other members of the IRF family such as IRF3, IRF5, and IRF7 are involved in TLR signaling pathways (23Yamamoto M. Sato S. Hemmi H. Hoshino K. Kaisho T. Sanjo H. Takeuchi O. Sugiyama M. Okabe M. Takeda K. Akira S. Science. 2003; 301: 640-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (2527) Google Scholar, 24Takaoka A. Yanai H. Kondo S. Duncan G. Negishi H. Mizutani T. Kano S. Honda K. Ohba Y. Mak T.W.

Nature. 2005; 434: 772-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that IRF-8 interacts with the TLR signaling pathways resulting in the cross-talk between TLR and IFN-γ signaling pathways. In this study, we show that IFN-γ and LPS synergistically activate ERK and JNK kinases resulting in the synthesis of macrophage proinflammatory factors. The activation of ERK and JNK kinases is significantly impaired in macrophages from IRF-8-deficient mice. Furthermore, IRF-8 binds to TRAF6 and regulates TRAF6 ubiquitination. These results show that IRF-8 is an important molecule mediating cross-talk between the TLR and IFN-γ signaling pathways and therefore identify IRF-8 as a potential target of therapeutic intervention to control harmful immune responses. Reagents and Antibodies—Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was from Sigma and IFN-γ was obtained from R&D System (Minneapolis, MN). Antibodies against IRF-8, TRAF6, MyD88, ubiquitin, and β-actin were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Hemagglutinin (HA) monoclonal antibody 12CA5 was from Roche Applied Science; the FLAG monoclonal antibody and antibody against FLAG was from Sigma; antibody against AU1 was from Imgenex. Antibodies against ERK, JNK, and phosphorylated ERK and JNK were obtained from Cell Signaling. Protein G-Sepharose beads were from Amersham Biosciences. Recombinant mouse macrophage-colony stimulating factor and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor were from Peprotech. Plasmid Constructs—IRF-8 full-length cDNA and IRF-8 C-terminal deletion mutants were inserted into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1. The HA-ubiquitin plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Ze'ev Ronai (Mount Sinai School of Medicine). The TRAF6 expression plasmid was from Dr. Adrian Ting (Mount Sinai School of Medicine). Cell Lines and Peritoneal Macrophage—The RAW264.7 murine macrophage cell line and 293T cell line were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin. CL-2 cells (IRF-8–/– macrophages) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, antibiotics, recombinant mouse macrophage-colony stimulating factor (6 ng/ml), and recombinant mouse granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (6 ng/ml). Peritoneal macrophages were isolated from C3H/OUJ mice 3 days after intraperitoneal injection of 2 ml of thioglycollate medium. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from tumor cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). 0.4 μg of RNA was used for each reaction. An RT-PCR protocol was used to determine relative quantities of mRNA after 28 PCR cycles (One-step RT-PCR kit, Qiagen), and quantified relative to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as an internal control. The primers for all genes tested were analyzed by BLAST search and synthesized by Gene Link, including: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (5′-GTGGAGATTGTTGCCATCAACG-3′ (sense), 5′-CAGTGGATGCAGGGATGATGTTCTG-3′ (antisense)); IL-6 (5′-GAGAGGAGACTTCACAGAGGATAC-3′ (sense), 5′-GTACTCCAGAAGACCAGAGG-3′ (antisense)); IL-12 p40 (5′-GAGAAACAGTGAACCTCACC-3′ (sense), 5′-CAGACAGAGA-CGCCATTCCAC-3′ (antisense)); TNF-α (5′-GACACCATGAGCACAGAAAG-3′ (sense), 5′-GAGTAGACAAGGTACAACCC-3′ (antisense)); iNOS (5′-GAGATTGGAGTTCGAGACTTCTGTG-3′ (sense), 5′-TGGCTAGTGCTTCAGACTTC-3′ (antisense)); and IL-1β (5′-GACAGTGATGAGAATGACCG-3′ (sense), 5′-CTAATGGGAACGTCACACACC-3′ (antisense)). Cytokine Release and Nitric Oxide Production—Cytokine secretion was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R&D Systems) and nitric oxide (NO) production was measured using Greiss reagent (Sigma). Transfection—293T cells were transiently transfected using DNA-calcium phosphate precipitate as described previously. For each transfection, 10–20 μg of plasmid was used. Retroviral Transduction—For retroviral transduction we used a derivative of the Moloney murine leukemia virus vector Pmmp412. 293T cells seeded at a density of 4 × 106 cells per 10-cm dish were cultured overnight and then transfected by calcium phosphate precipitate with 2.5 μg of plasmid pMD.G, encoding vesicular stomatitis virus G protein, 7.5 μg of pM-D.OGP, encoding gag-pol, and 10 μg of retroviral expressing construct, encoding IRF-8, TRAF6, or HA-tagged ubiquitin. After 48 h the viral supernatant was collected, centrifuged at 800 × g, and used to transduce cells. RAW264.7 cells (5 × 106) were resuspended in 10 ml of viral supernatant in the presence of 5 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma), and cells were cultured for 48 h before assay. IL-12 p40 Promoter Analysis—RAW264.7 cells were transiently transfected using SuperFect (Qiagen). For each transfection, 2.5 μg of plasmid was mixed with 100 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (without serum and antibiotics) and 10 μl of SuperFect reagent, incubated at room temperature for 10 min, mixed with 600 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's complete medium, and immediately added to the cells in 6-well plates. Luciferase activity was measured 16–24 h later. When indicated, LPS (1 μg/ml) was added to the culture for 6–12 h before harvest. The cells were extracted with reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and 20 μl of extract was assayed for luciferase as described. Cells were co-transfected with a constitutively active cytomegalovirus promoter-β-galactosidase reporter plasmid to normalize experiments for transfection efficiency. Western Blotting—Cell lysates and prestained molecular weight markers were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBST (Triton-containing Tris-buffered saline), incubated with various antibodies (1:2000) for 1–2 h, washed with TBST, and stained with anti-rabbit, or anti-goat, or anti-mouse IgG conjugated to peroxidase (1:5000). Immunoreactivity was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL kit, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—RAW264.7 cells nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (18Xiong H. Zhu C. Li H. Chen F. Mayer L. Ozato K. Unkeless J.C. Plevy S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2271-2277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 27Plevy S.E. Gemberling J.H. Hsu S. Dorner A.J. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4572-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay probes were prepared by annealing complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides with 5′-GATC overhangs (Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc.) and were labeled by filling in with [α-32P]dGTP and [α-32P]dCTP using Klenow enzyme. Labeled probes were purified with Nuctrap purification columns (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described previously, using 105 cpm of probe and 5 μg of nuclear extracts per reaction. DNA-binding complexes were separated by electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide-Tris/glycine-EDTA gel, which was dried and exposed to x-ray film. Co-immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of ice-cold buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol) with protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml chymostatin, and leupeptin). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 15 min at 4 °C). Aliquots of lysate (500 μg of protein) were incubated with 2 μg of normal rabbit IgG or normal goat IgG for 4 h with intermittent agitation at 4 °C, and the lysates were precleared by the addition of 15 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4°C. After centrifugation, the resulting supernatant was incubated with 2 μg of anti-TRAF6 antibody or anti-IRF-8 antibody overnight at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Immune complexes were absorbed on protein G-Sepharose and washed five times with lysis buffer. Finally immunoblotting was performed as described above. IFN-γ and TLR Ligands Synergistically Induce the Production of Proinflammatory Factors in Macrophages—To analyze the cross-talk between IFN-γ and TLR signaling, we incubated peritoneal macrophages for 6 h (mRNA) or 24 h (protein release) with IFN-γ (10 ng/ml), LPS (1 μg/ml), or IFN-γ (10 ng/ml) and LPS (1 μg/ml). The results showed that IFN-γ and LPS synergistically induced the mRNAs for IL-1β, TNF-α, iNOS, IL-12 p40, and IL-6 (Fig. 1A). To ascertain if the synergism was at the transcriptional level, we transfected RAW264.7 cells with an IL-12 p40 promoter luciferase reporter construct for 12–18 h, and activated with IFN-γ, LPS, and IFN-γ and LPS for 12 h. IFN-γ and LPS synergistically activated the IL-12 p40 promoter (data not shown). We next wanted to determine if IFN-γ synergizes with PGN (TLR2) and poly(I:C) (TLR3). We transfected RAW264.7 cells with an IL-12 p40 promoter luciferase reporter plasmid for 12–18 h and activated cells with PGN (TLR2) and poly(I:C) (TLR3) in the presence or absence of IFN-γ. The addition of IFN-γ with the TLR ligands synergistically induced IL-12 p40 promoter activation (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that IFN-γ synergistically interacts with various TLR ligands to induce proinflammatory factors, suggesting that there exists cross-talk between the IFN-γ and TLR signaling pathways. MAP Kinase, but Not NF-κB Activation, Is Important for the Crosstalk between IFN-γ and TLR Signaling—Stimulation of the TLR signal pathway leads to the activation of NF-κB and MAP kinases, resulting in the induction of proinflammatory factors. To determine the effects of IFN-γ and LPS on NF-κB and MAP kinase activation in macrophages, RAW264.7 cells were incubated for various intervals in the presence of IFN-γ, LPS, or IFN-γ plus LPS, and cell lysates were analyzed for IκB, ERK, and JNK phosphorylation by immunoblotting. Although IFN-γ alone did not induce ERK and JNK phosphorylation, IFN-γ and LPS synergistically induced ERK and JNK phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). LPS induced IκB phosphorylation, but there was no synergism between IFN-γ and LPS in the induction of IκB phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). To confirm this result, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments to analyze nuclear NF-κB DNA-binding activity in RAW264.7 cells stimulated with LPS or IFN-γ plus LPS (Fig. 2B). There was no synergism, nor was there synergism between IFN-γ and LPS in the induction of NF-κB reporter activity (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that MAP kinase but not NF-κB activation is important for the cross-talk between IFN-γ and TLR signaling pathways. MAP Kinase Activation Is Impaired in IRF-8–/– Macrophages—We previously reported that IRF-8 is important for IL-12 and iNOS gene activation (18Xiong H. Zhu C. Li H. Chen F. Mayer L. Ozato K. Unkeless J.C. Plevy S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2271-2277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We also found that IFN-γ and LPS acted synergistically to induce IRF-8 protein expression (18Xiong H. Zhu C. Li H. Chen F. Mayer L. Ozato K. Unkeless J.C. Plevy S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2271-2277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To extend these observations, we analyze the synthesis of IRF-8 in RAW264.7 macrophages incubated with IFN-γ alone and in combination with TLR ligands PGN and poly(I: C). IFN-γ acted synergistically with PGN and poly(I:C) to induce IRF-8 (Fig. 3A). These results parallel the synergistic induction of proinflammatory factors by IFN-γ and LPS. Therefore we hypothesize that IRF-8 is pivotal for the cross-talk between IFN-γ and TLR signaling pathways. To address this question directly, we assayed cytokines released by thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages from wild-type and IRF-8–/– mice activated with IFN-γ (10 ng/ml), LPS (1 μg/ml), or IFN-γ (10 ng/ml) plus LPS (1 μg/ml) for 24 h. IL-12, IL-1, TNF-α, and IL-6 titers were lower in all cases from IRF-8–/– macrophages (Fig. 3, B–E). We next analyzed if MAP kinase activation was impaired in IRF-8–/– macrophages. Thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages from IRF-8–/– and wild-type mice activated with LPS (1 μg/ml) were assayed for phosphorylation of ERK and JNK by Western blot. Activation of ERK and JNK by LPS was strongly impaired in macrophages derived from IRF-8–/– mice and the IRF-8-deficient macrophage cell line CL-2 (Fig. 4, A and B). To confirm further the importance of IRF-8, we transduced CL-2 cells with IRF-8 or GFP for 2 days, activated the cells with LPS (1 μg/ml) at intervals, and analyzed ERK and JNK phosphorylation. Transduction of IRF-8 into IRF-8–/– macrophages rescued LPS-induced ERK and JNK activation compared with the GFP control (Fig. 4C). Similar results were found using the TLR ligands, PGN and poly(I:C) (Fig. 5, A and B). The inhibition of both MAP kinase activation and production of proinflammatory factors in IRF-8–/– macrophages highlight the central role for IRF-8 in TLR signaling.FIGURE 5TLR2 and TLR3-induced MAP kinase activation was impaired in IRF-8–/– macrophages. A, PGN and poly(I:C)-induced ERK and JNK activation was impaired in IRF-8–/– macrophages. RAW264.7 cells and IRF-8–/– macrophages were activated with PGN (5 μg/ml) or poly(I:C) (1 μg/ml) for 10, 30, and 60 min, and phosphorylation of ERK and JNK was analyzed by immunoblotting with phosphorylation specific and control antibodies. B, retroviral transduction of IRF-8 into CL-2 cells rescued ERK and JNK activation. Cl-2 cells were transduced with IRF-8 or GFP for 48 h and the cells were activated with PGN (5 μg/ml) or poly(I:C) (1 μg/ml) for 10, 30, and 60 min, and phosphorylation of ERK and JNK was detected as in A. C, retroviral transduction of IRF-8 DNA binding domain mutant rescued ERK activation. CL-2 cells were transduced with IRF-8 DNA binding domain mutant or GFP for 48 h, and the cells were activated with LPS (1 μg/ml) for 10 and 30 min, and phosphorylation of ERK was detected as in A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further analyze whether transactivation of IRF-8 is important for MAP kinase activation, we transduced the IRF-8 DNA binding domain mutant (K79E) (16Tamura T.

Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) or GFP into CL-2 cells for 2 days, activated the cells with LPS (1 μg/ml) at intervals, and analyzed ERK phosphorylation as above. The results showed that transduction of IRF-8 DNA binding domain mutant still rescued ERK activation (Fig. 5C), suggesting that the transactivation of IRF-8 is not essential for MAP kinase activation. IRF-8 Interacts Physically with TRAF6—To investigate how IRF-8 regulates TLR signaling, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments between IRF-8 and MyD88 or TRAF6, which revealed an interaction between IRF-8 and TRAF (Fig. 6A) but not MyD88 (data not shown). However, co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that MyD88 interacted with IRF-7 (Fig. 6B). In addition, gel filtration of lysates from 293T cells co-transfected with IRF-8 and TRAF6 showed that the two proteins co-eluted in a high molecular weight complex (data not shown). To confirm the interaction of IRF-8 with TRAF6 without protein overexpression, we incubated thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages with IFN-γ (10 ng/ml) and LPS (1 μg/ml) for 4 h and then collected cell lysates for co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Significantly we found that the physical interaction between IRF-8 and TRAF6 existed in peritoneal macrophages only after activation with IFN-γ and LPS (Fig. 6C). On a functional level, when IRF-8 and TRAF6 were co-transfected into RAW264.7 cells with an IL-12 p40 promoter luciferase reporter plasmid, we observed synergism in IL-12 p40 promoter activation (Fig. 6D). To map the domains of IRF-8 necessary for TRAF6 binding, we made several N-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged C-terminal truncation mutants, including IRF-8-(1–390), IRF-8-(1–356), IRF-8-(1–305), and IRF-8-(1–253). We co-transfected TRAF6 and IRF-8 or the IRF-8 truncation mutants into 293T cells and 2 days later prepared lysates for co-immunoprecipitation experiments. TRAF6 was co-immunoprecipitated with IRF-8, IRF-8-(1–390), and IRF-8-(1–356) but not with IRF-8-(1–305) or IRF-8-(1–253), indicating that the region between residues 305 and 356 of IRF-8 is required to interact with TRAF6 (Fig. 6E). IRF-8 Enhances TRAF6 Ubiquitination—TRAF6, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, plays a pivotal role in the activation of TLR signaling (1Medzhitov R. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 1: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (3284) Google Scholar, 3Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6751) Google Scholar) by catalysis of Lys-63-coupled polyubiquitination. Signal transduction by the IL-1 receptor, which shares many signaling components with TLR4, including TRAF6, is inhibited by a ubiquitin K63R mutant (28Deng L. Wang C. Spencer E. Yang L. Braun A. You J. Slaughter C. Pickart C. Chen Z.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar). Because we find that IRF-8 and TRAF6 interact, we next analyzed the effect of IRF-8 on TRAF6 ubiquitination. Cell lysates from 293T cells co-transfected with TRAF6, HA-ubiquitin, and IRF-8 for 48 h were immunoprecipitated with anti-TRAF6 and immunoblotted with anti-HA or anti-ubiquitin. Co-transfection of IRF-8 significantly enhanced TRAF6 ubiquitination visualized by staining HA-ubiquitin (Fig. 7A). Similarly, transfection of IRF-8 also enhanced TRAF6 ubiquitination visualized by anti-ubiquitin staining (Fig. 7B). To analyze the region in IRF-8 that is required for enhancement of TRAF6 ubiquitination, we co-transfected various IRF-8 C-terminal truncation mutants into 293T cells with TRAF6 and HA-Ub plasmids for 48 h. In agreement with the experiments to map IRF-8 TRAF6 interaction (Fig. 6E) IRF-8, IRF-8-(1–390), and IRF-8-(1–356) clearly enhanced TRAF6 ubiquitination, but IRF-8-(1–305) and IRF-8-(1–253) were without effect. Thus the enhancement of TRAF6 ubiquitination by IRF-8 is dependent on physical interaction of IRF-8 with TRAF6 (Fig. 7C). To confirm these experiments, we co-transduced IRF-8, TRAF6, and HA-Ub into RAW264.7 and CL-2 cells for 48 h and analyzed TRAF6 ubiquitination. In contrast to RAW264.7 cells, TRAF6 ubiquitination was significantly reduced in CL-2 cells. However, transduction of IRF-8 restored TRAF6 ubiquitination in both cell types to comparable levels (Fig. 7D). To investigate the relationship of the enhancement of TRAF-6 ubiquitination by IRF-8 with MAP kinase activation, we transduced CL-2 cells for 2 days with GFP or the IRF-8 mutant (1–390), which can enhance TRAF6 ubiquitination. Cells were activated with LPS (1 μg/ml) at intervals, and ERK phosphorylation was analyzed as above. The results showed that transduction of IRF-8-(1–390) still rescued ERK activation (Fig. 7E), suggesting TRAF6 ubiquitination enhanced by IRF-8 is important for MAP kinase activation. These results, in aggregate suggest that the interaction of IRF-8 with TRAF6 modulates TRAF6 ubiquitination and MAP kinase activation. In this study we investigate the role of IRF-8 in the cross-talk between IFN-γ and TLR signaling. We have shown that the activation of TLR4 by LPS to induce the expression of proinflammatory factors, including IL-1, IL-6, IL-12, NO, and TNF-α is synergized by IFN-γ. Comparable results were observed using PGN (a TLR2 ligand) and poly(I:C) (a TLR3 ligand) and IFN-γ to activate the IL-12 promoter. IFN-γ augmented only LPS-induced ERK and JNK phosphorylation and had no effect on NF-κB activation induced by LPS. Interestingly, in IRF-8–/– macrophages both the LPS-stimulated activation of ERK and JNK as well as expression of proinflammatory factors was inhibited. We found by co-immunoprecipitation experiments, that IRF-8 interacts physically with TRAF6 at a binding site between residues 305 and 356 of IRF-8. Furthermore, transfection of IRF-8 enhanced TRAF6 ubiquitination, which was dependent on the physical interaction between these two proteins. Taken together, the results suggest that the interaction of IRF-8 with TRAF6 modulates TLR signaling and may contribute to the cross-talk between IFN-γ and TLR signaling. We initially hypothesized that IFN-γ would enhance LPS-induced NF-κB activation, because NF-κB is an essential downstream target for TLR signaling (1Medzhitov R. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 1: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (3284) Google Scholar, 3Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6751) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, IFN-γ had no effect on LPS-induced NF-κB activation and had only a marginal effect on NF-κB activation. The synergistic activation by IFN-γ and LPS of ERK and JNK suggests that MAP kinases mediate IFN-γ and TLR cross-talk. The IFN-γ signal transduction pathway is composed of primary and secondary phases. In the primary phase, after IFN-γ binding to IFN-γR, STAT1 mediates the primary signaling response. After ligand engagement, STAT1 is first phosphorylated by tyrosine kinases JAK1 and JAK2, then dimerizes, and subsequently translocates to the nucleus (29Platanias L.C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (2372) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, STAT1 binds to IFN-γ-activated sequence sequences and activates transcription of target genes including IRF-1 and IRF-8, which are important in both innate and adaptive immune responses (17Tamura T. Ozato K. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 21Taniguchi T. Ogasawara K. Takaoka A. Tanaka N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 623-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). IRF-3, IRF-5, and IRF-7 have all been implicated in the TLR signal pathway. Several viruses activate the TLR3 signal pathway (30Rudd B.D. Burstein E. Duckett C.S. Li X. Lukacs N.W. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 3350-3357Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 31Guillot L.

Alexopoulou L. Anderson J.F. Fikrig E. Flavell R.A. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 1366-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar), suggesting that TLR3 may play an important role in anti-viral host defense. IRF-5-deficient mice are severely impaired in TLR ligand stimulation of proinflammatory cytokine synthesis (24Takaoka A. Yanai H. Kondo S. Duncan G. Negishi H. Mizutani T. Kano S. Honda K. Ohba Y. Mak T.W. Taniguchi T. Nature. 2005; 434: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Furthermore, IRF-5 interacts with and is activated by MyD88 and TRAF6. TLR activation results in the nuclear translocation of IRF-5 to activate cytokine gene expression. IRF-7 is also reported to play a role in TLR signaling. IRF-7 interacts with MyD88 and the TLR stimulated synthesis of IFN-α requires the formation of a complex consisting of MyD88, TRAF6, and IRF-7 (33Kawai T. Sato S. Ishii K.J. Coban C. Hemmi H. Yamamoto M. Terai K. Matsuda M. Inoue J. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 1061-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). IRF-8, an essential transcription factor in the induction of Th1 immune responses, is also involved in the TLR signaling pathway. CpG DNA-induced NF-κB activation was impaired in IRF-8–/– dendritic cells, suggesting IRF-8 is involved in TLR9 signaling. However, the molecular mechanism was not elucidated (34Tsujimura H. Tamura T. Kong H.J. Nishiyama A. Ishii K.J. Klinman D.M. Ozato K. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 6820-6827Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We report that macrophages from IRF-8–/– mice produced sharply decreased levels of IL-12, TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6 in response to LPS. Furthermore, we have found that LPS-induced ERK and JNK MAP kinase activation was severely impaired in peritoneal macrophages from IRF-8–/– mice. Unlike IRF-7, IRF-8 binds to TRAF6, but not to MyD88 (33Kawai T. Sato S. Ishii K.J. Coban C. Hemmi H. Yamamoto M. Terai K. Matsuda M. Inoue J. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 1061-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). IRF-8 resides predominantly in the nucleus but, upon stimulation, moves to the cytoplasm. Because signal transmission occurs in a short time frame, it is reasonable to postulate that, upon TLR activation, IRF-8 interacts with TRAF6 in the cytosol. IRF-3 is produced constitutively in most cell types and is present in the cytoplasm in the absence of activation. Both IRF-5 and IRF-7 are expressed constitutively at very low levels mainly in lymphoid tissues, but their expression is enhanced by IFN-α/β treatment (35Au W.C. Moore P.A. LaFleur D.W. Tombal B.

Chem. 2001; 276: 23382-23390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Unactivated macrophages express very low levels of IRF-8. However, IFN-γ stimulation induces IRF-8 synthesis, which is further augmented by TLR ligands LPS, PGN, and poly(I:C). The present study implicates TRAF6 as a target for IRF-8. TRAF6 is a ring domain-containing ubiquitin ligase, essential for the activation of NF-κB and MAP kinases downstream of the TLR signaling pathway (3Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6751) Google Scholar). TRAF6 forms a complex with an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme complex, consisting of Ubc13 and Uev1A, which catalyze the synthesis of lysine 63 polyubiquitin chains. Lysine 63 ubiquitination regulates protein-protein interaction rather than serving as a degradation signal. TRAF6, acting as an E3 ligase, activates signal transduction through association with downstream proteins, and TRAF6 itself is polyubiquitinated after oligomerization or dimerization. We find that IRF-8 interacts with TRAF6 and regulates TRAF6 ubiquitination. Because IRF-8 is not an E3 ligase, we suggest that IRF-8 either is part of the signaling complex, altering the activity of the UBC13-UEV1a complex, or is involved in recruitment of a different E3 ligase. Our study provides an insight into the mechanism of the gene induction program downstream of TLR signaling. The observation that IRF-8, whose synthesis is stimulated by IFN-γ and augmented by TLR ligands, is required for MAP kinase but not NF-κB activation clarifies the complex regulation of the inflammatory responses. Thus, IRF-8 is not only involved in TLR signaling, but also contributes to the cross-talk between IFN-γ and the TLR signaling pathways, resulting in the maximal production of proinflammatory cytokines. The interaction of IRF-8 with the TLR signaling pathway is a secondary signal required to boost the immune response, especially during intracellular bacteria or viral infection. IRF-8, therefore, is a potential target for therapeutic intervention aimed at controlling harmful immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W1991999185,"Force networks form the skeleton of static granular matter. They are the key ingredient to mechanical properties, such as stability, elasticity and sound transmission, which are of utmost importance for civil engineering and industrial processing. Previous studies have focused on the global structure of external forces (the boundary condition), and on the probability distribution of individual contact forces. The disordered spatial structure of the force network, however, has remained elusive so far. Here we report evidence for scale invariance of clusters of particles that interact via relatively strong forces. We analyzed granular packings generated by molecular dynamics simulations mimicking real granular matter; despite the visual variation, force networks for various values of the confining pressure and other parameters have identical scaling exponents and scaling function, and thus determine a universality class. Remarkably, the flat ensemble of force configurations--a simple generalization of equilibrium statistical mechanics--belongs to the same universality class, while some widely studied simplified models do not."

This extracellular region (“ectodomain”) of the Bacillus subtilis protein YueB (YueB780) was a 7 S elongated dimer forming a 36.5-nm-long fiber. YueB780 bound to the tail tip of bacteriophage SPP1.

We also showed that the receptor was exposed to the B. subtilis surface. YueB differed structurally from phage receptors from Gram-negative bacteria. Its properties revealed a fiber spanning the full length of the 30-nm-thick peptidoglycan layer. The fiber is predicted to be anchored in the cell membrane through transmembrane segments.

Virus interaction with one or several cellular receptors is an essential step for recognition of the host cell and for commitment of the virus to initiate infection. Animal, plant, fungi, Archaea, and bacterial cells have different surfaces that impose distinct barriers for virus entry. Strategies to overcome these barriers and the receptors targeted by viruses are expectedly different (1Poranen M.M. Daugelavicius R. Bamford D.H. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2002; 56: 521-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 2Vinga I. São-José C. Tavares P. Santos M.A. Wegrzyn G. Bacteriophage Biology and Biotechnology. Research SignPost, Kerala, India2006: 165-205Google Scholar). More than 95% of the known bacterial viruses (bacteriophages) use a tail structure to recognize the host cell surface and to deliver their double-stranded DNA genome to the bacterial cytoplasm. The DNA enters naked into the cell, with the empty phage particle remaining in the exterior of the bacterium (3Hershey A.D. Chase M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1952; 36: 39-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Phage adsorption to bacteria involves the specific interaction between tail adhesins and surface-exposed receptors of the host cell envelope. Adsorption of a particular phage may involve more than one cellular receptor, and binding can occur in a reversible or irreversible manner (4Adams M.H. Bacteriophages. Interscience Publishers, New York1959Google Scholar). Phage receptors are found in surface-exposed organelles, such as flagella or pili, in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and in the thick peptidoglycan cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria (1Poranen M.M.

It is thought that phages initially adsorb in a reversible way to a general component of the cell wall prior to irreversible binding to a specific receptor (8Monteville M.R. Ardestani B. Geller B.L.

The dimeric receptor was a 36.5-nm fiber that bound strongly to the tail tip of the SPP1 non-contractile tail and triggered DNA ejection in vitro.

YueB780 production was induced by incubating cultures in a 42 °C water bath for 30 min, and protein synthesis was continued for an additional period of 3 h at 37 °C.

The sample was kept on ice to prevent overheating. Crude extracts were centrifuged (30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C) to remove insoluble material and the soluble fraction filtered through a pore size of 0.22 μm. The cleared extract was run through a HisTrap™ HP column (Amersham Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden) coupled to anÄkta fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The column was eluted with a linear gradient of 50–500 mm imidazole in receptor buffer (50 mm Hepes-Na, pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl). Partially purified YueB780 was then applied to a Superose 6 column (Amersham Biosciences AB) equilibrated in receptor buffer and run at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Pure YueB780 was kept in receptor buffer at 4 °C for short periods or at –80 °C for long term storage. All receptor concentrations were calculated for YueB780 dimers. SDS-PAGE, Western blot, and protein concentration determination were carried out as described previously (12São-José C. Baptista C. Santos M.A. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 8337-8346Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Analytical size exclusion chromatography was carried out in a prepacked Superose 6 column (Amersham Biosciences AB) calibrated and run as described previously (16Jekow P. Behlke J. Tichelaar W. Lurz R. Regalla M. Hinrichs W. Tavares P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 724-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The Stokes radius derived from the Kaν value of YueB780 was determined by extrapolation from a plot of Stokes radii of standard proteins versus (–log Kaν)1/2 in which Kaν = (Ve – V0)/(Vt – V0), where Ve is the elution volume of the protein, V0 is the column void volume, and Vt is the column total volume accessible to solvent (16Jekow P. Behlke J. Tichelaar W. Lurz R. Regalla M. Hinrichs W. Tavares P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 724-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The standard proteins used were thyroglobulin (Stokes radius = 8.5 nm), ovalbumin (3.05 nm), and myoglobin (2.07 nm). Rabbit polyclonal anti-serum was raised against purified YueB780, and IgG was purified by affinity to protein-A-Sepharose using standard methods (17Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual,. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1988Google Scholar). Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation velocity measurements were carried out as described previously (18Thual C. Komar A.A. Bousset L. Fernandez-Bellot E. Cullin C. Melki R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13666-13674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Data were analyzed to provide the apparent distributions of sedimentation coefficients using the programs Svedberg (19Philo J.S. Schuster T.M. Laue T.M. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Birkhäuser, Boston1994: 156-170Crossref Google Scholar) and DC/DT (20Stafford III, W.F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The solvent density was 1.01081 g/cm3, and YueB780 partial specific volume (0.7219 cm3 g–1) was calculated using the SEDNTERP software (19Philo J.S. Schuster T.M. Laue T.M. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Birkhäuser, Boston1994: 156-170Crossref Google Scholar). Equilibrium sedimentation of YueB780 was performed at 6,500 rpm, 4The abbreviations used are: rpm, revolutions/min; pfu, plaque-forming unit(s). 25 °C. Radial scans at 276 nm were taken at 4-h intervals. Equilibrium was reached after 24 h of centrifugation. The base line was recorded at 60,000 rpm at the end of the experiment. The data were analyzed to yield weight-average molecular weights using the programs XLAEQ and EQASSOC supplied by Beckman Instruments. Analysis of SPP1-Receptor Interaction, Phage Inactivation, and DNA Ejection—Approximately 5 × 109 SPP1 plaque-forming units (pfu) were mixed in melting ice with different amounts of purified receptor in a final volume of 10 μl. After 30 min on ice, the reaction volume was brought to 40 μl with ejection buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2), resulting in mixtures with ∼1011 pfu/ml (0.17 nm) and different concentrations of receptor (from ∼1 to 17 μg/ml, i.e. ∼5.7–97.3 nm YueB780 dimers). The samples were then incubated for 3 h at 37 °C with DNase (10 μg/ml). In an identical experiment, phage SPP1 was mixed with a fixed concentration of receptor (30 nm) and incubated at different temperatures (0, 8, 15, 23, and 37 °C) for 3 h. Half of the mixtures from both experiments was used for phage titration in B. subtilis YB886, and the other half was processed as described previously (21de Frutos M. Brasiles S. Tavares P. Raspaud E. Eur. Phys. J. E. Soft Matter. 2005; 17: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis. Quantification of DNA band intensity was made using the KODAK 1D version 3.5.2 software (Kodak). To determine the rate of SPP1 inactivation (Ir) at different receptor concentrations, ∼1011 pfu/ml SPP1 phages were equilibrated at 37 °C in ejection buffer and then the receptor added at the final concentrations of 20, 40, 80, and 200 nm. At different times after receptor addition, aliquots were collected for SPP1 titration. For the calculation of Ir, phage titers were plotted as a function of time and the slopes of the resulting curves determined (Ir = ln(P0/P)/Δt, where P0 is the initial phage titer and P, the phage titer after a Δt period). The inactivation constant (Ki) was calculated by normalization of Ir according to the input concentration of the receptor (Ki = Ir·[C] –1R). The number of viable phages was determined by titration in parallel to each experiment, and the titer obtained was then used for accurate calculation of phage particle concentration and phage/receptor ratios. Electron Microscopy—YueB780 was prepared for electron microscopy observation by negative staining with 1% (w/v) uranyl acetate or liophylization by freeze drying followed by heavy metal rotary shadowing with platinum and carbon at an angle of 18° (22Lepault J. Weiss H. Homo J.C. Leonard K. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 149: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Phages, phage-YueB780 complexes obtained by co-incubation at 4 °C for 1 h, and phages that ejected their DNA after incubation with YueB780 at 37 °C for 2 h were imaged after negative staining (23Steven A.C. Trus B.L. Maizel J.V. Unser M. Parry D.A. Wall J.S. Hainfeld J.F. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 351-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) or adsorption to mica (24Portmann R. Sogo J.M. Koller T. Zillig W. FEBS Lett. 1974; 45: 646-647Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Immunolabeling with purified anti-YueB780 IgG followed by attachment of protein A complexed to colloidal gold was carried out as described previously (25Lurz R. Orlova E. Günther D. Dube P. Dröge A. Weise F. van Heel M. Tavares P. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 1027-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Bioinformatics—Primary sequence homology searches were carried out using PSI-BLAST. SignalP version 3.0 and TMHMM were used for the prediction of signal peptides, transmembrane segments, and membrane topology. Secondary structure predictions were made with PSIPRED. YueB regions potentially involved in coiled coil formation were identified with COILS, and the presence of heptad repeats was detected with PEPWHEEL. Bioinformatics of YueB—Analysis in silico of the YueB primary sequence (1076 amino acids, ∼120 kDa) revealed the presence of a putative N-terminal signal peptide and predicted that five transmembrane segments are localized in its C terminus (Fig. 1A). This organization strongly suggested that YueB has a large extracellular domain (ectodomain) of ∼800 amino acids. YueB is mostly detected in membrane-enriched fractions of B. subtilis cells, confirming that the receptor is associated to the membrane (12São-José C. Baptista C. Santos M.A. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 8337-8346Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Furthermore, data presented below demonstrated that the receptor ectodomain is exposed to the bacterial surface. Secondary structure predictions suggested that the ectodomain has the propensity to form long α-helices. Three of these putative α-helical regions (amino acids 172–236, 363–408, and 516–611) exhibited also the potential to form coiled coil structures. The segments spanning residues 524–544 and 560–607 include three and seven heptad repeats, respectively, containing the motif abcdefg. Residues a and d, which are localized in the same side of the putative helix, are occupied by hydrophobic residues. Position a is predominantly occupied by isoleucine or leucine, and b is usually leucine (consensus sequence (I/L)X(E/D)LXXX). These heptads confer an amphipathic character to the helices found in coiled coil structures that are involved in the oligomerization of numerous proteins (26Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). The pattern of long helices in the ectodomain was found on a large number of proteins from Gram-positive bacteria that have sequence similarity to YueB (data not shown) (12São-José C. Baptista C. Santos M.A. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 8337-8346Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Heptads and coiled coil regions were also identified in a significant number of those protein homologues (not shown). Purification of the YueB Ectodomain—We overproduced and purified a soluble histidine-tagged polypeptide spanning residues 30–797 of YueB (YueB780) (Fig. 1A) (12São-José C. Baptista C. Santos M.A. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 8337-8346Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). YueB780 was purified from total protein extracts by metal affinity chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography. The protein had a high tendency to aggregate at NaCl concentrations below 300 mm. In solutions with higher salt concentration, it behaved essentially as a monodisperse species (see “YueB780 Is an Elongated Dimer in Solution”). During the purification procedure, we were unable to eliminate some minor polypeptides that had a molecular weight lower than the one expected for YueB780 (Fig. 1B). Most of these species were detected by Western blot in crude extracts of cells producing YueB780 using an anti-YueB780 serum. In contrast, they were not detected in control extracts from non-induced cultures of the same bacterial strain, showing that they were truncated versions of the ectodomain rather than contaminant E. coli proteins (Fig. 1, C and D). The truncated versions lacked the YueB780 C terminus fused to the hexahistidine tag as revealed by Western blot with anti-hexahistidine serum that detected only the full size protein (Fig. 1E). Co-purification of truncated polypeptides with YueB780 suggested that they associate with the tagged ectodomain. YueB780, with a predicted molecular mass of 87.3 kDa, had an abnormal migration in SDS-PAGE corresponding to a protein with an apparent molecular mass of ∼120 kDa. YueB780 Forms a Fiber Structure—Native YueB780 eluted as a single peak with an apparent molecular mass slightly larger than 670 kDa from size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 2A). The Stokes radius of the molecule derived from its elution volume is 9.6 nm. The apparent mass and the hydrodynamic radius obtained are incompatible with the expected molecular mass of a globular, monomeric YueB780. Observation of YueB780 freeze-dried and shadowed with platinum-carbon (Fig. 2B) or negatively stained (Fig. 2C) showed that it forms fiber-shaped particles. At high concentrations (0.1 mg/ml), these particles had some heterogeneity in length, probably because of the head-to-tail association of fibers. However, a large majority of the population of molecules observed were particles with identical dimensions when serial dilutions of the protein were imaged in a range of concentrations from 0.1 mg/ml to 0.001 mg/ml. The fibers were 36.5 ± 2.5 nm long and 2.8 ± 0.5 nm thick (n = 30) (Fig. 2, B and C, arrows). YueB780 Is an Elongated Dimer in Solution—To investigate whether the elution behavior of YueB780 from the size exclusion column and the shape in the electron microscope were due to its oligomerization or to its non-globular nature, we carried out analytical ultracentrifugation measurements. Fig. 3A shows sedimentation boundaries of YueB780 at equally spaced times. Raw data (symbols) were modeled to a one- or two-component system. The best fit (solid lines) yielded a single species with a sedimentation coefficient (s20,w0) of 7 S, incompatible with that of a 87.3-kDa globular protein. No rapidly sedimenting material was detected while the rotor was accelerating to reach the operating speed (30,000 rpm), ruling out the presence of large aggregates. YueB780 was also subjected to sedimentation equilibrium. The average molecular mass of YueB780 in aqueous solution was found to be 164,216 ± 45 Da (Fig. 3B), which is very close to the mass expected for a YueB780 dimer (174.6 kDa). The frictional ratio value (f/f0) calculated for the YueB780 dimer based on its experimental mass and sedimentation coefficient was 1.65. This value deviated significantly from the frictional coefficients of globular proteins (f/f0 ∼1.2). It strongly suggested that YueB780 is asymmetrical, consistent with the elongated shape of a polypeptide having the dimensions determined from the electron microscopy measurements (axial ratio a/b = 12.6). The hydrodynamic radius of YueB780 determined using its experimental molecular mass and sedimentation coefficient is 6.08 nm. The discrepancy between this value and the Stokes radius derived from size exclusion chromatography is likely because of an inaccurate correlation, in the latter method, between the elution volume of very elongated molecules and the Stokes radius (27Potschka M. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 47-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). YueB780 Inactivates SPP1 and Triggers Phage DNA Ejection—When YueB780 was incubated with SPP1 virions at 37 °C, the phage titer decreased as a function of the receptor concentration showing that YueB780 bound and inactivated phage SPP1 (Fig. 4A). Considering the linear region of the phage inactivation curve (Fig. 4A), the concentration of YueB780 dimers required to inactivate 99% of the viable phage particles was 28.6 nm. This corresponded to a ratio of ∼130 YueB780 dimers/phage particle. Half of the phage/receptor mixtures used in the inactivation experiment was treated with proteinase K to inactivate the DNase present in the samples and to disrupt virions. After deproteinization, the samples were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis to quantify the DNA remaining inside the phage structures. The amount of protected phage DNA decreased as a function of the YueB780 concentration, reaching a minimum of 0.5–1% of protected DNA relative to the total amount of DNA present in the phages used in the assay (Fig. 4, A and B). SPP1 binding to the receptor fiber thus triggered exit of the phage DNA from the capsid, making it accessible to DNase attack. Note that the inactivation of infective phages was more drastic than the reduction of protected DNA in response to increasing concentrations of YueB780 (Fig. 4A). This was likely due to the presence of particles defective for DNA ejection within the SPP1 population. In such case, the DNase protection assay provided an underestimation of the extent of DNA release from virions competent for DNA ejection. The inactivation rate of SPP1 infectious particles in the presence of YueB780 exhibited a linear dependence on the concentration of the receptor within the range tested (20–200 nm YueB780), yielding an average inactivation constant of 2.93 × 10–3 ± 0.82 × 10–3 min–1·nm–1 at 37 °C (Fig. 4C). Phage genome ejection triggered by YueB780 was temperature-dependent. DNase protection assays showed that no DNA was released at 0 °C. At 8 and 15 °C, a fraction of the phage particles ejected their genome, and frequently the ejection was partial, leading to different sizes of DNA that remained inside the viral capsid, as revealed by the smear of protected DNA (Fig. 4D). This smear was observed at different concentrations of DNase, provided the amount of enzyme was high enough to fully digest free DNA under the experimental conditions used in the assay (≥5 μg/ml at 15 °C). Electron microscopy observations further confirmed that a significant number of phages ejected partially their DNA within the time course of the experiment (not shown). Genome ejection at 23 °C was as efficient as at 37 °C (Fig. 4D). Phage inactivation at different temperatures did not correlate well with the DNase protection assays. At 4 °C, for example, ejection was completely inhibited, but >90% of the phages were still inactivated (Fig. 4D). This discrepancy suggested that serial dilutions of the mixtures in chilled TBT buffer (for phage titration; 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2) did not lead to dissociation of the virus-receptor complexes, allowing phage genome ejection after plating. Visualization of SPP1-YueB780 Complexes—Fig. 5, A and B, shows electron micrographs of SPP1 virions with their DNA-filled head, tail, and tail spike structures. When SPP1 virus particles were incubated with YueB780 at 4 °C, their tail spike associated with YueB fiber structures (Fig. 5C, arrow). This interaction was confirmed using anti-YueB780 IgG that cross-linked SPP1-YueB780 complexes through the phage tail tip region and by labeling of IgG with protein A-gold (Fig. 5D). Despite binding to the receptor, almost all phages presented their heads filled with DNA, even after 72 h at 4 °C (incubation on ice inside a refrigerator). Incubation at 37 °C, with or without a preincubation at 4 °C, led to release of DNA from the vast majority of the virions (Fig. 5, E and F), as anticipated from biochemical experiments (Fig. 4). Visual inspection of micrographs of the tails before and after DNA ejection did not reveal structural differences (Fig. 5, A–F), with the exception of some stain penetration in the phage tail tube (Fig. 5, E and F), indicating that it had opened to allow DNA passage to the solution (Fig. 5G). These results showed that SPP1 DNA ejection, but not receptor binding, is a temperature-dependent process. The YueB Receptor Is Exposed at the Cell Surface—B. subtilis cells were incubated with anti-YueB780 antibodies to investigate whether the receptor is exposed to the bacterial surface. The rate of SPP1 irreversible adsorption to these bacteria was significantly lower than that observed with cells treated with an irrelevant antibody (anti-UL25 of HSV-1) or untreated (Fig. 6A). The adsorption constant (Kads) to bacteria pre-incubated with anti-YueB780 (0.41 min–1·U –1A) was ∼2.5-fold lower than that obtained in the other two conditions (Kads = 1.11 and 0.99 min–1·U –1A, respectively). Therefore, the YueB region displaying SPP1 receptor activity is exposed at the cell surface and is specifically masked by the binding of anti-Yue780 antibodies. Immunogold staining of cells incubated with anti-YueB780 IgG confirmed the localization of YueB780 at the B. subtilis surface (Fig. 6B). No labeling was observed in the yueB deletion mutant strain CSJ1 (not shown). YueB is a membrane protein of B. subtilis that serves as a receptor for the irreversible adsorption of bacteriophage SPP1 (12São-José C. Baptista C. Santos M.A. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 8337-8346Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We have purified an ectodomain of YueB that bound to the SPP1 tail tip and triggered ejection of viral DNA. YueB780 formed an elongated dimer that behaved like a rod in solution. Its shape explained the abnormal migration in SDS-PAGE and the early elution from size exclusion chromatography columns. The dimer is likely stabilized by a coiled coil between α-helices of the two polypeptide chains. This structure, which stabilizes α-helices through a very efficient burial of hydrophobic side chains (28Crick F.H.C. Acta Crystallogr. 1953; 6: 689-697Crossref Google Scholar), is found in many cellular and extracellular structural proteins (streptococcal M proteins, keratins, and tropomyosin (26Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar, 29Phillips Jr., G.N. Flicker P.F. Cohen C. Manjula B.N. Fischetti V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4689-4693Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar)) and in virus particles (30Carr C.M. Kim P.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 823-832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar, 31Efimov V.P. Nepluev I.V. Sobolev B.N. Zurabishvili T.G. Schulthess T. Lustig A. Engel J. Haener M. Aebi U. Venyaminov S. Yu Potekhin S.A. Mesyanzhinov V.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 470-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 32Andrews D. Butler J.S. Al-Bassam J. Joss L. Winn-Stapley D.A. Casjens S. Cingolani G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5929-5933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The properties of the YueB780 ectodomain are consistent with a dimeric YueB molecule forming an elongated fiber bound to the cytoplasmic membrane via 10 transmembrane segments. Because the putative N terminus signal peptide was not shown experimentally to be cleaved off from YueB, we cannot exclude the possibility that the fiber is fixed to the membrane both at the N and C termini. However, the fiber needs to be long enough to cross the ∼30-nm-thick peptidoglycan cell wall of the Gram-positive bacterium (33Graham L.L. Beveridge T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1413-1421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to expose a receptor domain to the medium (Fig. 6). Considering this requirement and the length of the ectodomain (36.5 nm), the most likely possibility is that YueB is attached to the cell membrane only through its C terminus. The YueB780 rod-like shape probably facilitates the accommodation of the ectodomain within the peptidoglycan mesh. These novel structural features for a virus receptor likely apply to the large family of proteins homologous to YueB that are found in Gram-positive bacteria and that share the same predicted membrane topology and secondary structure (12São-José C. Baptista C. Santos M.A. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 8337-8346Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Although the physiological function of these proteins remains unclear, their properties make them very suitable receptors for viruses of Gram-positive bacteria. YueB780 bound to the tail tip of SPP1 and triggered efficiently the release of phage DNA in the absence of other bacterial proteins (Figs. 4 and 5). The inactivation rate of SPP1 virions in the presence of 200 nm YueB780 (0.82 min–1) (Fig. 4C) was identical to the one obtained when phages are added to cultures of B. subtilis at a density of 108 cfu·ml–1 (12São-José C. Baptista C. Santos M.A. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 8337-8346Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The ratio used in the in vitro assay was 1500 YueB780 dimers/phage (200 nm receptor for 0.127 nm phage), which, if maintained in the context of SPP1 infection, would imply the presence of 150 active receptors/bacterium (inactivation rates are determined at an input multiplicity of 1 phage/10 bacteria). This number is very probably an overestimation, because during infection, the virus receptors are clustered in large particles (the bacterium), and the very efficient reversible adsorption of SPP1 to B. subtilis increases significantly the local concentration of phages at the bacterial surface. YueB780 bound to SPP1 at different temperatures, but DNA release was only efficient above 15 °C. A temperature dependence for DNA ejection was also found for phages λ (34Mackay D.J. Bode V.C. Virology. 1976; 72: 167-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and T5 (35Tosi F. Labedan B. Legault-Demare J. Virol. 1984; 50: 213-219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), showing that there is an energy barrier to triggering DNA release in tailed bacteriophages (36de Frutos M. Letellier L. Raspaud E. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 1364-1370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This barrier is physiologically relevant for phage infection, as it ensures that the virion only ejects its genome to the host cell at temperatures at which that the bacterium is metabolically active. Most interestingly, although SPP1 DNA ejection was fully blocked at 0 °C, partial ejection of the genome occurred in a fraction of the virion population at 8 and 15 °C (Fig. 4D) (electron microscopy observations not shown). Therefore, under these conditions, DNA traffic from the capsid to the phage outside is not a fast all-or-nothing process, because it can be trapped at intermediate stages in the absence of an external counterpressure to ejection. Our discovery indicates that the molecular event controlling DNA ejection in a temperature-dependent manner affects DNA movement. The DNA end that first exits the phage capsid during ejection is the one that is fixed to a structure-named connector. The connector is found at the tail extremity opposite to the tail tip, forming the tail-capsid interface. SPP1 DNA ejection thus requires that, following receptor binding to the tail tip, a signal is transmitted along the tail helical structure leading to the opening of gp16 (the protein that closes the connector pore) (37Orlova E.V. Gowen B. Dröge A. Stiege A. Lurz R. Weise F. van Heel M. Tavares P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1255-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), allowing movement of DNA along the tail tube. The conformations of the open connector or of the tail tube at low temperatures are the most conceivable factors in constraining DNA passage. This feature adds to the growing evidence that DNA exit during ejection is not a mere function of the internal pressure inside the capsid (38Evilevitch A. Lavelle L. Knobler C.M. Raspaud E. Gelbart W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9292-9295Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) but that the phage structure also has active control over the DNA movement process (39Mangenot S. Hochrein M. Radler J. Letellier L. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 430-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 40Kemp P. Gupta M. Molineux I.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 1251-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). YueB780 is the first active virus receptor of a Gram-positive bacterium that was purified. Its molecular properties differ radically from the well characterized receptors found in Gram-negative bacteria, which are the outer membrane pore-forming proteins LamB and FhuA (5Schirmer T. Keller T.A. Wang Y.-F. Rosenbusch J.P. Science. 1995; 267: 512-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 6Ferguson A.D. Hofmann E. Coulton J.W. Diederichs K. Welte W.

Cell. 1998; 95: 771-778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). As anticipated from the properties of Gram-positive bacteria surfaces, the YueB molecule is designed to cross the thick peptidoglycan cell wall, exposing the receptor domain to the extracellular medium. Its fiber structure is unlikely to provide a channel for viral DNA traffic. Because the binding of SPP1 to YueB triggers DNA ejection very efficiently, this raises the question as to how the phage-receptor interaction in vivo is coordinated with the efficient routing of viral DNA through the cell wall and membrane to reach the host cytoplasm.

https://openalex.org/W2144373514,"Inheritance of APOE alleles is associated with varying clinical outcomes in several neurodegenerative diseases that are associated with innate immune response in brain. We tested the hypothesis that inheritance of different APOE alleles would significantly modulate neurotoxicity arising from glial innate immune response. We first used dissociated cultures of wild-type (wt) murine neurons and glia derived from mice with targeted replacement (TR) of the epsilon2, epsilon3, or, epsilon4 APOE allele. Our results showed that the vast majority of bystander damage to wt neurons derived from microglia was greatest with TR APOE4 glia, intermediate from TR APOE3 glia, and least from TR APOE2 glia and preceded detectable NO secretion. Microglial p38MAPK-dependent cytokine secretion followed a similar pattern of TR APOE dependence. In hippocampal slice cultures, innate immune activation had a similar pattern of TR APOE-dependence and produced postsynaptic neuronal damage in TR APOE4 and TR APOE3 but not TR APOE2 cultures that was p38MAPK dependent. These findings suggest a new mechanism by which inheritance of different APOE alleles may influence the outcome of neurodegenerative diseases associated with microglial innate immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2134262275,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal inherited disorder caused by mutation in the gene encoding CF transmembrane regulator (CFTR). The clinical course of CF is characterized by recurrent pulmonary infections and chronic inflammation. Here, we show that toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2) expression and response were strongly enhanced in the human CF bronchial epithelial cell line, CFBE41o-. Treatment of the cells with 5-azacytidine decreased the promoter methylation within TLR2 proximal promoter and increased endogenous expression of TLR2 in non-CF 16HBE14o- cells, suggesting that TLR2 expression is epigenetically regulated by CpG methylation. Moreover, bisulfite sequence analysis revealed that TLR2 promoters were highly demethylated in CFBE41o- cells, implying that decreased methylation of the TLR2 promoter is responsible for CF-related up-regulation of TLR2. Finally, stable expression of WT-CFTR in CFBE41o- cells (CFBE41o-/WT-CFTR cells) reduced TLR2 expression and the response to its ligand peptidoglycan (PGN), implying a causal relationship between CFTR dysfunction and TLR2 up-regulation. Consistent with reduced expression of TLR2 in CFBE41o-/WT-CFTR cells, CpG methylation was increased in CFBE41o-/WT-CFTR cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate that TLR2 expression is epigenetically up-regulated in CF bronchial epithelial cells and suggest that TLR2 overexpression or prolonged activation of TLR2 signaling might be critical in CF pathogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2020417072,"We have shown that TRPC3 (transient receptor potential channel canonical type 3) is sharply up-regulated during the early part of myotube differentiation and remains elevated in mature myotubes compared with myoblasts. To examine its functional roles in muscle, TRPC3 was “knocked down” in mouse primary skeletal myoblasts using retroviral-delivered small interference RNAs and single cell cloning. TRPC3 knockdown myoblasts (97.6 ± 1.9% reduction in mRNA) were differentiated into myotubes (TRPC3 KD) and subjected to functional and biochemical assays. By measuring rates of Mn2+ influx with Fura-2 and Ca2+ transients with Fluo-4, we found that neither excitation-coupled Ca2+ entry nor thapsigargin-induced store-operated Ca2+ entry was significantly altered in TRPC3 KD, indicating that expression of TRPC3 is not required for engaging either Ca2+ entry mechanism. In Ca2+ imaging experiments, the gain of excitation-contraction coupling and the amplitude of the Ca2+ release seen after direct RyR1 activation with caffeine was significantly reduced in TRPC3 KD. The decreased gain appears to be due to a decrease in RyR1 Ca2+ release channel activity, because sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ content was not different between TRPC3 KD and wild-type myotubes. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that TRPC1, calsequestrin, triadin, and junctophilin 1 were up-regulated (1.46 ± 1.91-, 1.42 ± 0.08-, 2.99 ± 0.32-, and 1.91 ± 0.26-fold, respectively) in TRPC3 KD. Based on these data, we conclude that expression of TRPC3 is tightly regulated during muscle cell differentiation and propose that functional interaction between TRPC3 and RyR1 may regulate the gain of SR Ca2+ release independent of SR Ca2+ load.

This entire group of channels has been predicted to consist of six transmembrane segment channels that allow the entry of Ca2+ and Na+ into the cell (1Ramsey I.S. Delling M. Clapham D.E. Annu. Rev.

One of the TRPC subtypes, TRPC3, is highly expressed in the brain, skeletal muscle, and cardiac muscle (4Clapham D.E. Nature. 2003; 426: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (2164) Google Scholar, 5Hofmann T. Schaefer M. Schultz G. Gudermann T. J. Mol.

Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1089-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). It has been reported that TRPC3-mediated Ca2+ entry can be induced by two different mechanisms: 1) direct activation by binding of exogenous organic molecules or endogenous metabolites such as diacylglycerol analogues (7Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar), and 2) phospholipase C-mediated activation via phospholipase C-coupled receptor. The latter mechanism can be subdivided into two different submechanisms. One submechanism is store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) (8Li H.S. Xu X.Z. Montell C. Neuron. 1999; 24: 261-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 9Vazquez G. Lievremont J.P. St. J. Bird G. Putney Jr., J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The second submechanism is receptor-operated Ca2+ entry (11Okada T. Inoue R. Yamazaki K. Maeda A. Kurosaki T. Yamakuni T. Tanaka I. Shimizu S. Ikenaka K. Imoto K. Mori Y. J. Biol.

Sugimoto K. Hara Y. Mori E. Morii T. Kurosaki T. Mori Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4677-4688Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Physiological evidence has been demonstrated for the involvement of TRPC3 in many processes. For example, TRPC3 activation via phospholipase C γ-IP3R pathway is essential for brain-derived neurotrophic factor-dependent growth cone guidance in cerebellar granule neurons (15Li Y. Jia Y.C. Cui K. Li N. Zheng Z.Y. Wang Y.Z. Yuan X.B. Nature. 2005; 434: 894-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). In arterial smooth muscle cells, TRPC3 is activated by purinergic receptors, and then Ca2+ influx through TRPC3 induces depolarization and vasoconstriction (16Reading S.A. Earley S. Waldron B.J. Welsh D.G. Brayden J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: H2055-H2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Using heterologous expression studies in HEK 293 cells, it has been shown that TRPC3 physically interacts with cytosolic Ca2+ signaling proteins such as IP3R, where it competes with calmodulin for the same binding site on IP3R (17Zhang Z. Tang J. Tikunova S. Johnson J.D. Chen Z. Qin N. Dietrich A. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Zhu M.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3168-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported that TRPC3 interacts with ryanodine receptors (RyRs) (18Kiselyov K.I. Shin D.M. Wang Y. Pessah I.N. Allen P.D. Muallem S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 421-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 19Lee E.H. Allen P.D. Biophys. J. 2004; 86 (abstr.): 61Google Scholar); however, the functional roles of TRPC3 in skeletal muscle have not been well addressed. RyRs function as Ca2+ release channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and are essential proteins for excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in striated muscles (20Brady A.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1964; 26: 341-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 21Sandow A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1965; 17: 265-320PubMed Google Scholar). RyRs have been shown to have bidirectional communication with a second essential protein in EC coupling, the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR), which acts as both a sarcolemmal L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channel (20Brady A.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1964; 26: 341-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and the mechanical trigger for RyR activation (21Sandow A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1965; 17: 265-320PubMed Google Scholar). During EC coupling, as a result of membrane depolarization, Ca2+ influx through DHPR or conformational changes of DHPR via its gating charge movement activates RyR2 in cardiac muscle or RyR1 in skeletal muscle respectively. The Ca2+ stored in SR is then released through RyRs into the cytosol to cause muscle contraction. Recently, functional coupling between RyR and TRPC1 (22Sampieri A. Diaz-Munoz M. Antaramian A. Vaca L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24804-24815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) or TRPC3 (18Kiselyov K.I. Shin D.M. Wang Y. Pessah I.N. Allen P.D. Muallem S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 421-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) has been shown in heterologous expression systems such as Chinese hamster ovary and HEK cells. In the case of TRPC1, it has been proposed that the functional interaction between RyR1 and TRPC1 is a physical interaction with an undefined region in the cytoplasmic foot region of RyR1 (22Sampieri A. Diaz-Munoz M. Antaramian A. Vaca L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24804-24815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Furthermore, involvement of TRPCs has been reported in the abnormal calcium influx observed in muscle disease models such as dystrophic mouse skeletal muscle fibers (6Vandebrouck C. Martin D. Colson-Van Schoor M. Debaix H. Gailly P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1089-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Therefore, although in skeletal muscle it is possible for EC coupling to occur in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (21Sandow A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1965; 17: 265-320PubMed Google Scholar), the possible involvement of extracellular Ca2+ influx and the interactions of RyR1 with Ca2+ ion-conducting channel proteins in sarcolemma (other than the DHPR) during EC coupling still remain to be elucidated. In the current study, we have defined the role of TRPC3 during EC coupling and muscle contraction in primary mouse skeletal muscle myoblasts/myotubes in which TRPC3 mRNA and protein expression was reduced (>97 and >94%, respectively) by using small interference RNA. Materials—Fetal bovine serum, cell culture media, trypsin, l-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and basic fibroblast growth factor were obtained from Invitrogen. Caffeine, KCl, ryanodine, thapsigargin, cyclopiazonic acid, and heat-inactivated horse serum were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Monoclonal anti-RyR1 antibody (34C) was provided by Drs. J. Airey and J. Sutko (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA). Anti-TRPC3 antibody was obtained from Alomone Labs (Jerusalem, Israel). Anti-DHPR, sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA), triadin, and calsequestrin antibodies were obtained from Affinity BioReagents (Golden, CO). Anti-junctophilin 1 antibody was a kind gift from Dr. Jianjie Ma. Anti-calmodulin, FKBP12, and α-tubulin were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). G-Sepharose beads were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Collagen was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). FuGENE transfection reagent was obtained from Roche Diagnostics. Cell Cultures—The method used to derive primary wild-type myoblasts from mouse skeletal muscle was previously described (23Felder E. Protasi F. Hirsch R. Franzini-Armstrong C. Allen P.D. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 3144-3149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 24Moore R.A. Nguyen H. Galceran J. Pessah I.N. Allen P.D. J.

Physiol. 2004; 286: C179-C189Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). After ∼48 h in growth medium, myoblasts were replated either on 10-cm dishes coated with collagen to prepare cell lysates or on 96-well plates coated with collagen for Ca2+ imaging and Mn2+ quench experiments. When cells reached ∼70% confluence, growth medium was replaced with differentiation medium (containing 5% heat-inactivated horse serum and no growth factors) and placed into an 18% CO2 incubator to induce differentiation. HEK293 cells were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin. Creation of TRPC3 Knockdown Primary Myoblasts—To knock down the mRNA of TRPC3 in primary myoblasts, vectors expressing short hairpin RNA sequences were used. First, two different sequences were selected using a program from Dharmacon siDESIGN center (Dharmacon, Chicago, IL) based on the cDNA sequence of TRPC3 (GenBank™ accession number NM_019510). BLAST searches confirmed that the selected oligonucleotide sequences did not possess homology to any other genes. Each of two 19-nucleotide sequences (Fig. 1A, Sequences I and II) was inserted into a retroviral vector (pSIREN-RetroQ, Clontech Laboratories, Mountain View, CA). Retroviral particles were packaged by transfecting each short hairpin RNA-expressing vector into HEK293-based packaging cells with FuGENE transfection reagent, and the harvested supernatant was filtered with 0.2 μm non-pyrogenic disc filters (Pall Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI). The filter-through (TRPC3 KD retroviruses I and II) was stored at –70 °C before use. Primary mouse skeletal muscle myoblasts were incubated for 3 h with both TRPC3 KD retroviruses I and II and polybrene (8 μg/ml) on 3 successive days and clonally selected using puromycin (0.3 μg/ml). Each selected clone was expanded and differentiated into myotubes described in “Cell Cultures.” Total RNA from myoblasts and differentiated myotubes of each TRPC3 KD clone was prepared, subjected to RT-PCR to make cDNA, and analyzed by real-time PCR. The PCR mixture contained 12.5 μl of iTaq supermix with ROX (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), 0.4 μg of cDNA, and 2 pm of each primer in a 25-μl final volume. All samples were run in duplicate. The reaction conditions were 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Amplification and detection were performed with the ABI PRISM Sequence Detection System (AB Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Ca2+ Imaging and Mn2+ Quench Experiments—Ca2+ transients (cytosolic Ca2+ amount) and Mn2+ influx were measured as described previously (25Lee E.H. Lopez J.R. Li J. Protasi F. Pessah I.N. Kim D.H. Allen P.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C179-C189Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 26Fessenden J.D. Wang Y. Moore R.A. Chen S.R. Allen P.D. Pessah I.N. Biophys.

Chem. 1992; 267: 2164-2172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, differentiated primary wild-type and TRPC3 KD myotubes were loaded with Fluo-4 for Ca2+ imaging and Fura-2 for Mn2+ quench experiments (500 μm MnCl2). Dye-loaded myotubes were imaged with an intensified CCD camera with a ×40 objective. Caffeine, KCl, cyclopiazonic acid, ryanodine, and thapsigargin were dissolved in imaging buffer or Me2SO (<0.1%) and applied to myotubes by a 16-channel perfusion pipette (AutoMate Scientific, Berkley, CA). To maintain osmolarity, in the case of KCl (60 mm) application the concentration of Na+ was lowered and the chloride product was maintained. Co-immunoprecipitation—Co-immunoprecipitation was done as previously described (28Lee E.H. Rho S.H. Kwon S.J. Eom S.H. Allen P.D. Kim D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26481-26488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, myotubes were homogenized and incubated with a lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml of aprotinin, 12.5 μg/ml of leupeptin, and 20 μg/ml of pepstatin A) to prepare the cell lysate. For triadin, free Ca2+ concentration of the lysis buffer was set at 100 μm by adding 5 mm CaCl2. The cell lysate was then quickly centrifuged to remove insolubilized masses, and the protein concentration of the supernatant was determined. Total protein (500 μg) of each diluted lysate (4×) with Triton X-100-free lysis buffer was incubated with 25 μl of anti-RyR antibody overnight at 4 °C, followed by further incubation with protein G-Sepharose beads for 4 h. Beads were washed three times with the lysis buffer to remove non-specifically bound proteins. The immune complexes were treated with SDS-sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Statistical Analysis—Results are given as means ± S.E. with the number of experiments mentioned in the figure legends. Significance of the differences was analyzed by the paired or unpaired t-test (GraphPad InStat, v2.04). Differences were considered to be significant when p <0.05. Graphs were prepared using Origin v7. Small Interference RNA Knock Down of TRPC3 Expression—Total mRNA preparations of fourteen different TRPC3 knockdown clones were subjected to RT-PCR and then real-time PCR to examine TRPC3 mRNA levels (Fig. 1B). The most effective clone was clone number 2–21 (with 97.6 ± 1.9% reduction in the mRNA level). Immunoblot analysis with solubilized cell lysate from clone number 2–21 myotubes showed 94.6 ± 0.4% reduction in the protein level (Fig. 1C). This clone was named TRPC3 KD and used for all further functional and biochemical experiments. Functional Consequence of TRPC3 Knock Down—We examined cytosolic Ca2+ transients in response to depolarization and direct RyR1 activation in TRPC3 KD myotubes loaded with Fluo-4. Wild-type myotubes were used as a control. To mimic the membrane depolarization of muscle, 60 mm KCl was applied to myotubes for 30 s (Fig. 2A, left). Interestingly, TRPC3 KD myotubes had a 40% decrease in peak amplitude of depolarization-induced Ca2+ release compared with wild-type myotubes (Fig. 2B, normalized peak amplitude of TRPC3 KD myotubes was 0.61 ± 0.05 when the peak amplitude of wild-type myotubes was set to 1, p <0.05), suggesting that the gain of EC coupling was reduced in the absence of TRPC3 expression. Normalized responses compared with those of wild-type myotubes also showed that the transients in TRPC3 KD myotubes had a faster inactivation slope (Fig. 2A, right, dotted lines), which was supported by significantly decreased ratio of residual (at 20 s after KCl application, indicated by a vertical dotted line in panel A, left) versus peak amplitude in TRPC3 KD myotubes (Fig. 2C, 0.35 ± 0.04 (TRPC3 KD versus 0.52 ± 0.05 (wild type)). To rule out the possibility that the main cause of the reduced cytosolic Ca2+ release during EC coupling was due to a reduced amount of SR Ca2+ in TRPC3 KD myotubes, SR Ca2+ content was measured directly by treatment of the myotubes with 10 μm cyclopiazonic acid, an SR Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor; there was no significant difference in the amount of Ca2+ in the SR of TRPC3 KD myotubes compared with that of wild-type myotubes (Fig. 2, D and E). We examined several possibilities that could be responsible for the reduced gain of EC coupling. The first hypothesis we tested was that of an inherent impairment of RyR1 function. RyR1 activity was directly measured by challenging the myotubes with a saturating concentration of the channel agonist caffeine (40 mm) and measuring the size of the Ca2+ transient (Fig. 3). We found that the amplitude of the peak cytosolic Ca2+ elicited by caffeine treatment was also significantly lower in TRPC3 KD myotubes compared with wild-type myotubes (Fig. 3A, left, and 3B). However, when a normalized trace of TRPC3 KD myotubes (setting the peak response of wild type to 1) was overlaid with that of wild-type myotubes (Fig. 3A, right), the ratio of residual (at 20 s after caffeine application, indicated by a vertical dotted line in panel A, left) versus peak amplitude was unchanged (Fig. 3C, 0.87 ± 0.07 (TRPC3 KD) versus 0.79 ± 0.08 (Wild type)), suggesting that although the caffeine-induced peak amplitude was significantly decreased, the inactivation kinetics of RyR1 in TRPC3 KD myotubes were similar to those of wild-type myotubes. The second hypothesis was that TRPC3 could be the yet to be identified excitation-coupling calcium entry (ECCE) channel (29Cherednichenko G. Hurne A.M. Fessenden J.D. Lee E.H. Allen P.D. Beam K.G. Pessah I.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15793-15798Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and that the decrease in gain and decreased residual ratio after KCl application was secondary to a decrease in depolarization-induced Ca2+ entry. We tested this hypothesis using Mn2+ quench experiments in myotubes loaded with Fura-2 treated with (Fig. 4A) or without (supplemental Fig. S1) 500 μm ryanodine for 30 min to block RyR1 activity. 60 mm KCl was applied to myotubes to mimic membrane depolarization in the presence of extracellular Mn2+, and the rate of Mn2+ quench at the Fura-2 isosbestic point was determined. We found that the initial rate of ECCE in TRPC3 KD myotubes was not significantly different from that of wild-type myotubes (3.30 ± 0.35 (TRPC3 KD) versus 3.44 ± 0.44 (Wild type)), suggesting that TRPC3 is not the ECCE-mediating channel and does not interact with the ECCE-mediating protein(s) or play a role in the three-way communication among RyR1, the DHPR, and the ECCE channel. Because measurement of SR stores with cyclopiazonic acid (or thapsigargin) is difficult to quantitate, we determined whether the near abolishment of TRPC3 could interfere with SOCE. This was tested in myotubes loaded with Fluo-4 (Fig. 4B) in which SR Ca2+ stores had been previously depleted by the application of 200 nm thapsigargin in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. After total store depletion was confirmed by the lack of any response to KCl or caffeine, 2 mm Ca2+ was applied to the bath and the initial rate of Ca2+ entry was determined. The initial rate of SOCE was not different in TRPC3 KD myotubes compared with that of wild-type myotubes (2.60 ± 0.45 (TRPC3 KD) versus 3.16 ± 0.52 (Wild type)). Although the maximal amplitude of the SOCE transient was reduced in TRPC3 KD myotubes (0.92 ± 0.06 (TRPC3 KD) versus 1.15 ± 0.11 (Wild type)), this difference was not statistically significant (p 0.09) (Fig. 4C). The Effects of TRPC3 Knock Down on Muscle Protein Expression—To examine expression profiles of the 3 other TRPCs expressed in muscle and 10 triadic proteins involved in EC coupling in TRPC3 KD myotubes, solubilized cell lysates from wild-type and TRPC3 KD myotubes were subjected to immunoblot analysis (Fig. 5). The results of this analysis showed that TRPC1 was up-regulated (1.46 ± 1.91-fold) in response to the knock down of TRPC3, whereas the expression of TRPC4 and TRPC6 were unchanged (Fig. 5A). Of the 10 triadic proteins examined, 7 showed no change in expression (Fig. 5B). However triadin, junctophilin 1 (JP1), and calsequestrin (CSQ) had significant increases in basal expression levels (2.99 ± 0.32-, 1.91 ± 0.26-, and 1.42 ± 0.08-fold, respectively) associated with the 94% reduction of TRPC3 expression. Interestingly, like TRPC3, all three proteins are known to interact with RyR1 and have been shown to regulate RyR1 activity (20Brady A.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1964; 26: 341-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 21Sandow A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1965; 17: 265-320PubMed Google Scholar, 30Collins J.H. Tarcsafalvi A. Ikemoto N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 167: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Protein-Protein Interactions Determined by Co-immunoprecipitation—Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed with 34C (anti-RyR1 antibody) to examine whether there was any change in the amount of proteins interacting with RyR1 associated with the knock down of TRPC3 (Fig. 5C). As expected, co-immunoprecipitation of TRPC3 with RyR1 was absent in TRPC3 KD myotubes (data not shown). Of the three triadic proteins whose expression was up-regulated, we found that there was an increased complex formation of RyR1 with triadin (3.26 ± 0.59-fold) and JP1 (2.02 ± 0.20-fold), but not CSQ, in the solubilized TRPC3 KD myotube lysates. In this study, TRPC3 knock down in skeletal muscle myotubes was accomplished using a retroviral system to stably deliver small interference RNA. One clone (TRPC3 KD, clone number 2–21) had a >97% reduction in mRNA levels and >94% reduction in protein levels (Fig. 1). Myotubes from this clone were subjected to Ca2+ imaging and Mn2+ quench experiments to examine the functional consequences of TRPC3 knock down in muscle cells. These were followed by biochemical assays to reveal underlying mechanisms of the functional changes. TRPC3 KD myotubes had a significantly decreased gain of EC coupling, which is reflected as a decreased cytosolic Ca2+ transient during EC coupling (Fig. 2). In accordance with the fact that the major Ca2+ source for muscle contraction is Ca2+ release through RyR1 as a result of a physical interaction between RyR1 and the DHPR during skeletal EC coupling (21Sandow A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1965; 17: 265-320PubMed Google Scholar), RyR1 activity in TRPC3 KD myotubes was significantly reduced (Fig. 3). Because we ruled out store depletion as the cause for this reduction by showing that the SR Ca2+ content is the same in wild-type and TRPC3 KD myotubes (Fig. 2, D and E) and that the initial rate of SOCE is unchanged (Fig. 4B), it is likely that the reduced cytosolic Ca2+ transient during EC coupling in TRPC3 KD myotubes resulted from a direct reduction of RyR1 activity. This possibility is supported by the fact that in addition to a decreased gain of EC coupling, the knock down of TRPC3 is also associated with a decrease in the gain of Ca2+ release in response to direct activation of RyR1 by caffeine (Fig. 3). Two other mechanistic possibilities that link the reduced EC coupling and caffeine-induced release with our protein expression data (Fig. 5) are: 1) by increasing triadin and CSQ, it is very possible that their increased expression affects how tightly Ca2+ is bound to the complex immediately ready for Ca2+ release at the junctional endoplasmic reticulum store or, more likely, 2) the coupling efficiency of RyR1 activation to mobilize the Ca2+ immediately surrounding luminal space is diminished. These interpretations are warranted given that both proteins have been implicated in coupling RyR1 conformation to Ca2+ release from the lumen (31Ikemoto N. Ronjat M. Meszaros L.G. Koshita M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6764-6771Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 32Ikemoto N. Antoniu B. Kang J.J. Meszaros L.G. Ronjat M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5230-5237Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 33Guo W. Campbell K.P. J. Biol.

J. 2002; 82: 310-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). One of our original hypotheses was that TRPC3 was the ECCE channel, because TRPC3 could be co-immunoprecipitated with RyR1 (18Kiselyov K.I. Shin D.M. Wang Y. Pessah I.N. Allen P.D. Muallem S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 421-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and the newly discovered ECCE current could be blocked by 2-APB, SKF96365, and La3+, all of which are known to block TRPC3 current (29Cherednichenko G. Hurne A.M. Fessenden J.D. Lee E.H. Allen P.D. Beam K.G. Pessah I.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15793-15798Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was unequivocally proven incorrect as the initial rate of ECCE of TRPC3 KD myotubes was not significantly different from that of wild type (Fig. 4A) (1.23 ± 0.15 (TRPC3 KD) versus 1.30 ± 0.08 (wild type)). In addition, these results showed that the decreased gain in EC coupling was not secondary to a decreased ECCE current. A possible connection between the reduced RyR1 activity and the absence of TRPC3 is the up-regulation of triadin and subsequent direct inhibition of RyR1 function caused by the increase in the amount of triadin complexed with RyR1 (Fig. 5, B and C). Triadin has been previously suggested to be an direct inhibitory protein of RyR1 activity (35Beard N.A. Laver D.R. Dulhunty A.F. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2004; 85: 33-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), and overexpression of the primary skeletal 95-kDa isoform of triadin, Trisk 95, resulted in the almost complete abolition of skeletal-type depolarization-induced Ca2+ release in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ and a significant decrease in gain in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ (36Rezgui S.S. Vassilopoulos S. Brocard J. Platel J.C. Bouron A. Arnoult C. Oddoux S. Garcia L. De Waard M. Marty I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39302-39308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This is in accordance with our hypothesis. However, arguing against this hypothesis is the fact that in the Trisk 95-overexpressing cells, caffeine-induced Ca2+ release was not different from control. Another interesting protein that shows increased complex formation with RyR1 in TRPC3 KD myotubes is JP1. JP1 has been shown to facilitate junction formation between t-tubule and SR membrane via its N terminus, which has a specific affinity for t-tubule membrane, and its C terminus, which contains an SR membrane-spanning region (37Ito K. Komazaki S. Sasamoto K. Yoshida M. Nishi M. Kitamura K. Takeshima H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1059-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, with the exception of the known affinity of RyR1 for JP1 in co-immunoprecipitation studies, the mechanism by which an increase in JP1 expression would decrease RyR1 function is not known. The hypothesis that there is a functional interaction between TRPC3 and RyR1 is supported by the observation that expression of TRPC3 was enhanced by the expression of RyR1 in dyspedic 1B5 (lacking RyR1) myotubes (supplemental Fig. S2, upper left). Regulation of TRPC3 expression by RyR1 was also confirmed with wild-type (RyR1+/+) and RyR1-deficient (RyR–/–) primary myotubes (supplemental Fig. S2, right and histogram), indicating that this regulation is not dependent on the origin of the cells. Interestingly, although the expression of two of the three other TRPCs expressed in skeletal muscle, TRPC4 and TRPC6, is unchanged in TRPC3 KD myotubes, there is an increased expression level of TRPC1 (Fig. 5A). Considering recent reports about SOCE through heteromeric TRPC channels composed of endogenous TRPC1, TRPC3, and TRPC7 in HEK293 cells (38Zagranichnaya T.K. Wu X. Villereal M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29559-29569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and the proven tandem action of TRPC1 and TRPC3 to mediate SOCE in a rat hippocampal neuronal cell line (39Wu X. Zagranichnaya T.K. Gurda G.T. Eves E.M. Villereal M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43392-43402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), it is very likely that TRPC1 and TRPC3 are partners in making heteromeric TRPC channels in muscle. Thus it is likely that the increase in the expression of TRPC1 found here is sufficient to compensate for the absence of TRPC3 when the rate of depletion-activated SOCE is measured and prevents the conclusion that TRPC3 plays no role in SOCE in wild-type myotubes (Fig. 4, B and C). Studies with neurons have revealed that TRPC3 is highly expressed in the rat hippocampal cell line and mediates the specific SOCE required for its differentiation, but not that associated with proliferation (39Wu X. Zagranichnaya T.K. Gurda G.T. Eves E.M. Villereal M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43392-43402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The studies conclude that TRPC3 activity is essential for the guidance of nerve growth cone in rat pontine neurons (15Li Y. Jia Y.C. Cui K. Li N. Zheng Z.Y. Wang Y.Z. Yuan X.B. Nature. 2005; 434: 894-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). In the same context, we found that during differentiation of primary wild-type myoblasts to myotubes, expression level of TRPC3 peaked just after starting differentiation (day 1) and then gradually decreased (Ref. 19Lee E.H. Allen P.D. Biophys. J. 2004; 86 (abstr.): 61Google Scholar and supplemental Fig. S3). However, the fully differentiated myotubes on day five still expressed more TRPC3 than growing myoblasts (day zero) (2.85 ± 0.21-fold). Thus, in the case of mouse skeletal muscle, regulated TRPC3 expression is associated with muscle cell differentiation, although its role is not yet known. In conclusion, in this study we examined roles of TRPC3 in mouse skeletal muscle. We found that there appears to be a direct specific functional interaction between RyR1 and TRPC3 that, when interrupted, lowers the gain of the RyR1 activity without any depletion of the Ca2+ store. It is also possible that, either instead or in addition to this direct interaction, the up-regulation of triadin and JP1 associated with the absence of TRPC3 may play a role in down-regulating RyR1 activity. Our data clearly show that TRPC is not the ECCE-associated protein, and because of an associated up-regulation of the expression of TRPC1, which is known to be a partner in forming heteromeric SOCE channels in other tissues, it was not possible to see any difference in SOCE function associated with the knock down of TRPC3.

https://openalex.org/W2013678104,"Dendritic cells are the most potent of the antigen-presenting cells and are characterized by surface expression of CD83. Here, we show that the coding region of CD83 mRNA contains a novel cis-acting structured RNA element that binds to HuR, a member of the ELAV family of AU-rich element RNA-binding proteins. Transient transfection of mammalian cells demonstrated that this CD83 mRNA-derived element acts as a post-transcriptional regulatory element in cells overexpressing HuR. Notably, binding of HuR to the CD83 post-transcriptional regulatory element did not affect mRNA stability. Using RNA interference, we show that HuR mediated efficient expression of CD83. In particular, HuR was required for cytoplasmic accumulation of CD83 transcripts. Likewise, inhibition of the CRM1 nuclear export pathway by leptomycin B or overexpression of a defective form of the nucleoporin Nup214/CAN diminished cytoplasmic CD83 mRNA levels. In summary, the data presented demonstrate that the HuR-CRM1 axis affects the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of CD83 mRNA under regular physiological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2138669987,"Inner membrane proteins (IMPs) of Escherichia coli use different pathways for membrane targeting and integration. YidC plays an essential but poorly defined role in the integration and folding of IMPs both in conjunction with the Sec translocon and as a Sec-independent insertase. Depletion of YidC only marginally affects the insertion of Sec-dependent IMPs, whereas it blocks the insertion of a subset of Sec-independent IMPs. Substrates of this latter YidC-only pathway include the relatively small IMPs M13 procoat, Pf3 coat protein, and subunit c of the F(1)F(0) ATPase. Recently, it has been shown that the steady state level of the larger and more complex CyoA subunit of the cytochrome o oxidase is also severely affected upon depletion of YidC. In the present study we have analyzed the biogenesis of the integral lipoprotein CyoA. Collectively, our data suggest that the first transmembrane segment of CyoA rather than the signal sequence recruits the signal recognition particle for membrane targeting. Membrane integration and assembly appear to occur in two distinct sequential steps. YidC is sufficient to catalyze insertion of the N-terminal domain consisting of the signal sequence, transmembrane segment 1, and the small periplasmic domain in between. Translocation of the large C-terminal periplasmic domain requires the Sec translocon and SecA, suggesting that for this particular IMP the Sec translocon might operate downstream of YidC."

Previously, we have shown that robo4 is essential for angiogenesis in vivo and that robo4 knockdown embryos display spatial and temporal defects in intersomitic vessels (ISVs) sprouting (9Bedell V.M. Yeo S.Y. Park K.W. Chung J. Seth P. Shivalingappa V. Zhao J. Obara T. Sukhatme V.P. Drummond I.A. Li D.Y. Ramchandran R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6373-6378Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Two recent reports have begun addressing the nature of downstream signaling molecules triggered by Robo4. One reports mammalian enabled protein interaction with Robo4 cytoplasmic tail (6Park K.W. Morrison C.M. Sorensen L.K. Jones C.A. Rao Y. Chien C.B. Wu J.Y. Urness L.D. Li D.Y. Dev. Biol. 2003; 261: 251-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), and another reports that overexpression of Robo4 in endothelial cells down-regulates ERK and FAK (10Seth P. Lin Y. Hanai J. Shivalingappa V. Duyao M.P. Sukhatme V.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 332: 533-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To date, no report has identified the structural requirements for these activities of Robo4. To study signaling mechanisms triggered by Robo4 in the vasculature, we initially designed four structural mutants tagged with GFP. Overexpression analysis in zebrafish in vivo and in HEK-293T or porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cells in vitro was used to determine the functionality of the constructs, and signaling pathways triggered by the mutant proteins. Pull-down analysis in transfected HEK-293T and endothelial cells show that full-length Robo4 activate Cdc42 and Rac1 but not Rho and that this activation was dependent on the presence of the extracellular ligand-binding region in Robo4. Furthermore, Rho GTPase activation is conserved across other family members in evolution and correlates well with phenotypic morphological changes in Robo4 expressing endothelial cell such as the induction of filopodia and lamellipodia. In addition, robo4 knockdown embryos in vivo display lower amounts of active Cdc42 and Rac, and angioblasts isolated ex vivo from robo4 knockdown transgenic zebrafish embryos (endothelial specific promoter driving GFP) search actively for directional guidance cues. Finally, Cdc42DN blocks Robo4-induced filopodia, as well as cell adhesion and migration, which suggest an important role for Cdc42 and Rac activation in Robo4-mediated signaling events. Overall, this study implies Rho GTPases in Robo4-mediated attractive vascular guidance. Zebrafish Stocks and Reagents—Zebrafish were grown and maintained at 28.5 °C (11Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book. 4th Ed. University of Oregon Press, Eugene, OR2000Google Scholar). Mating was routinely carried out at 28.5 °C, and the embryos were staged according to established protocols (12Kimmel C.B. Ballard W.W. Kimmel S.R. Ullmann B. Schilling T.F. Dev.

The dominant negative and constitutive active Rho GTPase constructs have been reported before (14Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S.

All zebrafish studies were performed under NCI and National Institutes of Health animal institutional guidelines (animal protocol no. LP-020). Antibodies used in this study include GFP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), Cdc42 and Rac (BD Transduction Laboratories), Rho (Santa Cruz), Actin (Sigma), Tubulin (abcam), anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences), pan-cadherin (abcam), and anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Mounting media with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole were purchased from Vector Laboratories Inc. Cloning and Constructs—For fusion constructs F, N, C, C1, C2, and C3, fragments were amplified from previously cloned full-length Robo4 construct using upstream CCACCATGCAGGTGTCTGCATGGATGTTGT (F and N), CCACCATGATTGAGATCGTCACATTGCTGC (C), CCACCATGGTTAGTGTGATTAAAGAGCCGTT (C1, C2, and C3), and downstream GTCGGTGCGAGGGGCTCTCCAGATGTCCTC (F, C, and C1), GCACTGCCAGAGCTTGTTGATTCAG (C2), GCTTTTTAGCCGTAATAGGCAGAGT (C3), and TGCCACCAGGG TTGGCTGGTCTGATATGTC (N) primers using cycling parameters: 94 °C 2 min, 94 °C 30 s, 58 °C 30 s, 72 °C 1 min (34 cycles), and 72 °C 5 min as described before. The PCR products were cloned in-frame into CTGFP fusion Topo TA expression vectors (Invitrogen), and all clones were sequenced. Expression constructs were as follows. PAKN: N-terminal 150 aa non-catalytic domain of PAK1, which contains the Cdc42 and Rac binding regions was cloned into pCEFLP backbone containing an au1 tag. PAKNL2: same region of PAK1 with mutations in aa residues Leu-83 and Leu-86 (15Montaner S. Sodhi A. Servitja J.M. Ramsdell A.K. Barac A. Sawai E.T. Gutkind J.S. Blood. 2004; 104: 2903-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). WASP: 201-321 aa residues of WASP were cloned into pCEFL backbone. Cell Lines and Transfections—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B. Tissue culture plates were treated with phosphate-buffered saline containing 20 μg/ml poly-d-lysine for 15 min before seeding the cells to prevent them from detaching from the plates when in serum-free conditions. HEK-293T cells were transiently transfected with 5 μg of plasmid in a 10-cm plate using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAE) were maintained in Ham's F-12 media (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin. Transient transfections in PAE cells were performed using the Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) in conjunction with Magnetofection™ CombiMag-2000 (OZ biosciences) to increase transfection efficiency. For co-transfection experiments, equal amounts of the two plasmids were used. Western Blots—Cells were lysed at 4 °C in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 25 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm KCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10μg/ml aprotinin, 10μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. For pull-down analysis Rho lysis buffer was used. For GFP westerns, radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, or Rho lysis buffer were used. Solubility of the different mutant proteins varies in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and Rho lysis buffers. In Vivo Cdc42 and Rac1 Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Assay—In vivo Rac1 and Cdc42 activity was assessed by a modified method described before (16Servitja J.M. Marinissen M.J. Sodhi A. Bustelo X.R. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34339-34346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Briefly, after serum starvation for 24 h, the cells were lysed with ice-cold Rho-lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm EGTA, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, mixture of protease inhibitors, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysates were incubated for 20 min with a purified, bacterially expressed GST fusion protein containing the CRIB domain of PAK1 (p21 activated kinase), previously bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads, followed by three washes with Rho-lysis buffer. The GTP-bound forms of Rac1 or Cdc42 associated with GST-CRIB were quantified by Western blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody against Rac1 or Cdc42. For Rho pull-down assays, GST-Rhotekin-RBD beads were used and assay was performed as described before (17Chikumi H. Vazquez-Prado J. Servitja J.M. Miyazaki H. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27130-27134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). For in vivo embryo pull-down assays, most of the procedure remained the same except that lysates were made from 75 dechorionated, deyolked, MO injected or uninjected 24-hour post fertilization embryos per sample using 500 μl of Rho-lysis buffer. Fluorescent Confocal Microscopy—Endothelial cells transfected with relevant plasmid were grown on coverslips and serum-starved for 8 h prior to washing twice with PBS and fixing with 2% paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS for 20 min. The fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS for 10 min, blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and incubated for 20 min with phalloidin conjugated to Texas Red (Molecular Probes, Inc.). For membrane staining, transfected cells were stained with primary anti-pan cadherin followed by secondary anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate antibody. The coverslips were mounted, and confocal images were acquired at room temperature using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal system mounted on a Zeiss Axiovert 100M microscope equipped with an oil immersion Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.4 differential interference contrast (DIC) objective lens. Morpholino and RNA Microinjections—Microinjections of one-cell stage zebrafish embryo with RNA or MO were carried out as described before (11Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book. 4th Ed. University of Oregon Press, Eugene, OR2000Google Scholar). MOs were purchased from Gene Tools, Inc. and reconstituted in nuclease-free water to a 2 mm stock concentration (16 ng/nl). Appropriate dilutions were made in 5× injection dye (100 mm HEPES, 1 m KCl, 1% phenol red), and ∼2-3 nL of MOs (8-12 ng) were injected at the one-cell stage. Sequences of MO1 and MO2 were described previously (9Bedell V.M. Yeo S.Y. Park K.W. Chung J. Seth P. Shivalingappa V. Zhao J. Obara T. Sukhatme V.P. Drummond I.A. Li D.Y. Ramchandran R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6373-6378Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) except that MO1 and control MO (CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA) used in this study were fluorescein-tagged. For RNA injections, 150 pg was injected per embryo of wt-Robo4, untagged zebrafish Robo4 (zfR4), and YFP-capped RNA transcribed by T7 polymerase from linearized vectors containing the respective inserts. Embryo Dissociation Protocol—Embryos from Tg(vegfr2: G-RCFP) were dechorionated manually at 21 som in egg water. Dechorionated embryos were washed three times in 1× PBS before incubating the embryos in TMI buffer (100 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm HEPES, 1% polyethylene glycol 20000). The cells were dissociated in 1× Trypsin containing Proteinase K (0.08 mg/ml) with a narrow bore pipette tip and observed under a stereomicroscope until a single cell suspension was obtained. The dissociated cells were filtered with 70-μm nylon cell strainer and immediately transferred into a LabTek glass chamber along with media containing 10% sheep serum. Ex Vivo Time-lapse and Image Analysis—Dissociated cells from 21 som embryos were observed for GFP and RFP fluorescence using argon gas laser for GFP at 488 nm and helium neon laser for Rhodamine at 546 nm. Once a GFP+/RFP+ cell was detected, initial confocal time series acquisitions was collected one frame (sequentially) every 5 s for 30 min using the Zeiss AIM software version 3.2 sp2 (Carl Zeiss GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). All original confocal time series datasets were of frame size 532 pixels by 532 pixels, scan zoom of 3 and ∼94 to 394 megabytes. Post-processing of the time series datasets was analyzed using Bitplane's Imaris software version 4.1.1 (Bitplane AG, Zurich, Switzerland). Datasets were cropped to an approximate frame size of 225 pixels by 190 pixels and resampled using a subsampling factor of 2 for x and y. Each dataset was then volume-rendered with a 5-μm grid, and coordinate axes were calculated from the image properties used during image acquisition. After all modifications were completed, the time series datasets were recorded using MPEG file format at 25 frames per second and with a compression factor of 50. For time track analysis, each time series was collected using a Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.4 numerical aperture differential interference contrast oil immersion objective with a scan zoom ranging from 2.5 to 5. For panels B-E in Fig. 2, Imaris 3D (Bitplane AG, Basil, Switzerland) software (version 4.2.0) was used to create a volume rendering of each time series where a spot with a diameter of 4-5 mm represented the cell and a time track reflecting the movement of the spot was generated with the auto-regressive motion gap close function. Time tracks were color-coded with blue for early time points and white for late time points (see color-coded time bar, bottom right of each image). For panels F-I″ in Fig. 2, a 40-frame subset of each time series was made with the Zeiss AIM software, keeping the midpoint the same as the full 360 frame (5 s/frame) time series. Regions of interest were drawn around the cell perimeter using Image-Pro Plus (MediaCybernetics Inc., Silver Spring, MS) software (version 5.1.2). The green and/or red fluorescence plus phase contrasts were used as a guide to draw regions of interest around each cell at each time point. The new tif series was imported into the Zeiss AIM software to modify the z-step size from 1 mm to 15 mm to create the cylindrical effect for visual clarity. Using Imaris 3D software, the modified z-step tiff series was imported into the surpass module and volume rendered. Once rendered, the green and red fluorescence plus phase was switched off leaving only the regions of interest outline of the cell with or without the cellular projections intact. Migration Assay—Migration assay was performed on HEK-293T cells transfected with GFP, wt-Robo4, Cdc42DN, and wt-Robo4 plus Cdc42DN constructs using the BD Falcon insert system. Approximately 2 × 104 cells/well were placed on the upper chamber, and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% serum was used as the stimulus in the lower chamber. The cells were incubated for 5 h in a 37 °C incubator, and all treatments were carried out in triplicates. The cells from the upper membrane side were removed by cotton tip, and the migrated cells on the bottom side facing the stimulus were stained by Diff Quick stain kit (Dade Behring). The stained cells on the membrane were counted manually using an inverted microscope using a 60× objective (Leica). Adhesion Assay—Transfected HEK-293T cells with relevant constructs were washed thrice with PBS, trypsinized, resuspended to a concentration of 104 cells/well, and plated in 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA)- or fibronectin (5 μg/ml)-coated wells. After 5 h, cells were washed thrice with PBS, fixed, stained with Diff Quick stain kit, and counted manually. Statistical Analysis and Quantitation—A two-way χ2 test was performed to determine p value of RNA injected samples in Fig. 1. The RNA injection experiments showed statistical significance across samples for YFP and wt-Robo4 or zfR4 (p < 0.0005), whereas no significance was attributed between WT and YFP or wt-Robo4 and zfR4 samples. Statistical significance for Fig. 8 was determined by Student twosample t test assuming equal variances. For Fig. 8 (A and B): p values for GFP and wt-Robo4 or wt-Robo4 and wt-Robo4 plus CdcDN are p < 0.005 in migration assay (serum stimulus), and p < 0.0005 for adhesion assay (fibronectin). For Fig. 8C: p = 0.16 for wt-Robo4 and wt-Robo4 plus WASP, p < 0.001 for wt-Robo4 and wt-Robo4 plus PAKN. For Fig. 8D: p < 0.003 for c-Robo4 and GFP, p = 0.63 for n-Robo4 and GFP, p = 0.75 for c1-Robo4 and GFP. For Fig. 8E: p = 3.9e-08 for GFP and c-Robo4, p = 0.05 for GFP and c1-Robo4, and p = 0.009 for GFP and n-Robo4. Quantitation of Western blots was performed using Quantity One software. A volumetric analysis tool was used to generate values and, after background subtraction, percentage activation was calculated by GTP pull-down values divided by total lysate values multiplied by 100. The -fold activation was determined by dividing all values to untransfected or GFP values.FIGURE 8Robo4-mediated phenotypic readouts are ligand dependent.

Robo1 and Robo4 are the only two Robos of the robo family that are implicated to play a role in vascular signaling (Fig. 1A) (5Wang B. Xiao Y. Ding B.B. Zhang N. Yuan X. Gui L. Qian K.X. Duan S.

Genomics. 2002; 79: 547-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that removing endogenous robo4 in zebrafish results in temporal and spatial disruption of ISVs sprouting from dorsal aorta (9Bedell V.M. Yeo S.Y. Park K.W. Chung J. Seth P. Shivalingappa V. Zhao J. Obara T. Sukhatme V.P. Drummond I.A. Li D.Y. Ramchandran R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6373-6378Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). To investigate structure-function correlation for Robo4, we initially generated four deletion mutants tagged with GFP at their C terminus. A full-length zebrafish Robo4 tagged with GFP (wt-Robo4: 1-1134AA), N-terminal that lacks the entire C terminus (n-Robo4: 1-624AA), and two C-terminal GFP fusion constructs with one lacking partial N terminus (c-Robo4: 531-1134AA) while another lacking the N terminus completely (c1-Robo4: 585-1134AA) were generated (Fig. 1B). The constructs were transiently transfected into HEK-293T cells and lysates were immunoblotted with GFP antibody. Western blot showed protein above 160 kDa for wt-Robo4 (Fig. 1C, lane F), slightly above 105 kDa for n-Robo4 (Fig. 1C, lane N), and below 105 kDa for c-Robo4 (Fig. 1C, lane C) and c1-Robo4 (Fig. 1C, lane C1) constructs. Interestingly, wt-Robo4 and n-Robo4 fusion proteins migrate higher in molecular mass than their expected size (wt-Robo4: 150 kDa, n-Robo4: 91 kDa) reflecting probable post-translational modification in the extracellular domain of Robo4. The difference between c-Robo4 and c1-Robo4 is 54 aa, which amounts to a ∼6-kDa size difference that is observed in gradient gel (data not shown). To check if addition of GFP tag altered the function of the native protein, we used RNA overexpression readouts that was previously shown to phenocopy gene knockdown experiments. To observe vessels, we utilized Tg(vegfr2: G-RCFP) transgenic fish line carrying a 6.5-kb vegfr2-promoter fragment driving GRCFP (green reef coral fluorescent protein) expression in angioblasts. We injected capped RNA for untagged zebrafish Robo4 (zfR4), wt-Robo4, and control yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) into Tg(vegfr2: GRCFP) embryos and checked for ISVs sprouting from dorsal aorta at 22-24 som (Fig. 1, D-G). Both untagged zebrafish Robo4 (zfR4) (Fig. 1F) and wt-Robo4 RNA (Fig. 1G) disrupted ISVs sprouting from dorsal aorta when compared with YFP (Fig. 1E) or uninjected embryos (Fig. 1D) suggesting that the GFP tag did not alter the native functionality of Robo4. Quantitation shows a 3-fold increase in defective embryos in wt-Robo4 and zfR4 injected samples when compared with wild type (WT) uninjected or YFP-injected embryos (Fig. 1H) and are statistically significant (p < 0.0005). Robo4 Knockdown Angioblasts ex Vivo Search Actively for Guidance Cues—Because robo4 knockdown zebrafish embryos display ISVs sprouting defects (9Bedell V.M. Yeo S.Y. Park K.W. Chung J. Seth P. Shivalingappa V. Zhao J. Obara T. Sukhatme V.P. Drummond I.A. Li D.Y. Ramchandran R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6373-6378Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), we checked the behavior of angioblasts isolated from these embryos. We developed an ex vivo approach (Fig. 2A) where fluorescein-tagged splicing MO was injected at one-cell stage into Tg(vegfr2: GRCFP) embryos. The embryos were developed until desired stage, and angioblasts were isolated by the embryo dissociation protocol explained under “Materials and Methods.” Two different splicing MOs were used that were previously shown to target robo4 transcript (9Bedell V.M. Yeo S.Y. Park K.W. Chung J. Seth P. Shivalingappa V. Zhao J. Obara T. Sukhatme V.P. Drummond I.A. Li D.Y. Ramchandran R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6373-6378Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Live time-lapse pictures were captured of angioblasts plated on glass cover chambers, and all movies were made during the period from 24 to 26 som stage where robo4 expression is seen in the vasculature (9Bedell V.M. Yeo S.Y. Park K.W. Chung J. Seth P. Shivalingappa V. Zhao J. Obara T. Sukhatme V.P. Drummond I.A. Li D.Y. Ramchandran R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6373-6378Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, angioblasts isolated from robo4 MO1 (supplemental movie 3) and MO2 (movie 4) embryos show movement that resemble cells actively searching for guidance and continue rolling (movie 4) in a nondirectional manner. On the other hand, control MO injected (movie 2) or uninjected (movie 1) angioblasts display less activity and appear stationary. Moreover, cells that were not endothelial in origin (GFP-) but were injected with MO did not show any difference in behavior when compared with control MO or uninjected embryos (data not shown). Time tracks in the still images (Fig. 2, B-E) show the track of angioblast movement. The MO-injected embryos (Fig. 2, C and D) show extended time tracks from the original position in comparison to uninjected (Fig. 2B) or control MO-injected embryos (Fig. 2E), which show compacted tracks. In addition to time tracks, four different cylindrical projections (Fig. 2, F-I) showing different cell topology angle were generated for each sample. Comparing the F panels, the MO sample (F′) shows numerous deviations from concentric patterns seen in angioblast from uninjected (F) and control MO (F″) injected samples. Moreover, the well defined path traversed by the angioblast in both uninjected (G-I) and control MO (G″-I″) is lost in random movements seen in MO (G′-I′) cylindrical projections. These results suggest that angioblast in the absence of Robo4 seem to search and move in a random trajectory. To determine whether the absence of Robo4 had any correlation to the angioblast behavior and movements, we investigated whether Rho GTPases that play a role in actin cytoskeletal rearrangement leading to directional migration were perturbed in the presence of Robo4. Robo4 Fusion Proteins Activate Rho GTPases—Structure-function fusion constructs described previously were transfected into endothelial cells (Fig. 3, A-L), and protein expression was visualized under GFP fluorescent microscopy. Because all deletion proteins contained the transmembrane domain we checked for membrane targeting for fusion proteins by performing immunostaining with pan-cadherin marker on the transfected cells. Confocal analysis shows co-localization patterns for wt-Robo4 (Fig. 3, A-C), n-Robo4 (Fig. 3, D-F), c-Robo4 (Fig. 3, G-I), and c1-Robo4 (Fig. 3, J-L) proteins with cadherin suggesting that all the proteins are appropriately targeted to the plasma membrane. We also checked for co-localization with markers for nucleus, golgi, ER, mitochondria, and lysosome, and none of them co-localized with the fusion proteins (data not shown). Initially, we performed overexpression analysis in HEK-293T cells, because biochemical studies are relatively easier to perform due to their high transfection efficiency. We transfected the fusion constructs into HEK-293T cells and performed an endogenous Rho GTPase pull-down assay with PAK beads that recognized both activated Cdc42 and Rac1, followed by Western blot with specific antibodies to Cdc42 (Fig. 4A) and Rac1 (Fig. 4B). Both wt-Robo4 (Fig. 4, A and B, lane F) and c-Robo4 (Fig. 4, A and B, lane C) activated Cdc42 or Rac1, but n-Robo4 and c1-Robo4 did not (Fig. 4, A and B, lanes N and C1). More"
https://openalex.org/W2015500420,"Data mining of the Corynebacterium glutamicum genome identified 4 genes analogous to the mshA, mshB, mshC, and mshD genes that are involved in biosynthesis of mycothiol in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium smegmatis. Individual deletion of these genes was carried out in this study. Mutants mshC– and mshD– lost the ability to produce mycothiol, but mutant mshB– produced mycothiol as the wild type did. The phenotypes of mutants mshC– and mshD– were the same as the wild type when grown in LB or BHIS media, but mutants mshC– and mshD– were not able to grow in mineral medium with gentisate or 3-hydroxybenzoate as carbon sources. C. glutamicum assimilated gentisate and 3-hydroxybenzoate via a glutathione-independent gentisate pathway. In this study it was found that the maleylpyruvate isomerase, which catalyzes the conversion of maleylpyruvate into fumarylpyruvate in the glutathione-independent gentisate pathway, needed mycothiol as a cofactor. This mycothiol-dependent maleylpyruvate isomerase gene (ncgl2918) was cloned, actively expressed, and purified from Escherichia coli. The purified mycothiol-dependent isomerase is a monomer of 34 kDa. The apparent Km and Vmax values for maleylpyruvate were determined to be 148.4 ± 11.9 μm and 1520 ± 57.4 μmol/min/mg, respectively (mycothiol concentration, 2.5 μm). Previous studies had shown that mycothiol played roles in detoxification of oxidative chemicals and antibiotics in streptomycetes and mycobacteria. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that mycothiol is essential for growth of C. glutamicum with gentisate or 3-hydroxybenzoate as carbon sources and the first characterization of a mycothiol-dependent maleylpyruvate isomerase.

Mycothiol (1Spies H.S. Steenkamp D.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), also known as MSH and chemically 1D-myo-inosityl-2-(N-acetyl-l-cysteinyl)amido-2-deoxy-α-d-glucopyranoiside, is the major low-molecular mass thiol in mycobacteria and streptomycetes (2Newton G.L. Arnold K. Price M.S. Sherrill C. Delcardayre S.B. Aharonowitz Y. Cohen G. Davies J. Fahey R.C. Davis C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1990-1995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some investigations showed that mycothiol is associated with protection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium smegmatis against antibiotics such as rifampin (3Newton G.L. Unson M.D. Anderberg S.J. Aguilera J.A. Oh N.N. del Dcardayre S.B. Av-Gay Y. Fahey R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 4Rawat M.

Newton G.L. Koledin T. Fahey R.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1723-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Thus, mycothiol is a potential target for medical treatment and has raised interest from both academia and industry. In addition, mycothiol also has the ability to protect cells against a range of toxic compounds. For example, in Amycolatopsis methanolica and Rhodococcus erythropolis, mycothiol detoxifies formaldehyde by acting as a cofactor for a formaldehyde dehydrogenase (6Misset-Smits M. Ophem P.W. Sakuda S. Duine J.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 221-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and detoxifies alkylating agents such as monobromobimane by converting them to S-conjugates of mycothiol (7Newton G.L.

Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6050-6058Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To date, the understanding of the physiological function of mycothiol is limited to detoxification and the protection of living cells (9Newton G.L. Fahey R.C. Arch. Microbiol. 2002; 178: 388-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), whereas essential metabolic roles for cell growth have not been reported. A survey on the distribution of low-molecular mass thiols in microorganisms showed that Corynebacterium diphtheriae produced mycothiol (2Newton G.L. Arnold K. Price M.S. Sherrill C. Delcardayre S.B. Aharonowitz Y. Cohen G. Davies J. Fahey R.C. Davis C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1990-1995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the occurrence of mycothiol in other Corynebacterium species has not been reported, and the physiological function of mycothiol in corynebacteria is still not well defined. The genus Corynebacterium covers both medical and industrial important species. For example, Corynebacterium glutamicum is commercially used for production of amino acids and vitamins (10Eggeling L. Bott M. Handbook of Corynebacterium glutamiucm. 1st Ed. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2005Crossref Google Scholar), and C. diphtheriae is a pathogen for human beings. Recently, the genomes of C. glutamicum (11Kalinowski J. Bathe B. Bartels D. Bischoff N. Bott M. Burkovski A. Dusch N. Eggeling L. Eikmanns B.J. Gaigalat L. Goesmann A. Hartmann M. Huthmacher K.

Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4671-4682Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) have been sequenced. This greatly stimulated the study of the physiology of corynebacteria. Consequently, C. glutamicum has been newly characterized for its robust ability to metabolize aromatic compounds (15Shen X.H. Liu S.J. Sci. China Ser. C. 2005; 48: 241-249PubMed Google Scholar, 16Shen X.H. Huang Y. Liu S.J. Microbes Environm. 2005; 20: 160-167Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 17Shen X.H. Liu Z.P. Liu S.J. Biotechnol. Lett. 2005; 26: 575-580Google Scholar), and a novel glutathione-independent gentisate pathway has been described (18Shen X.H. Jiang C.Y. Huang Y. Liu Z.P. Liu S.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 3442-3452Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of mycothiol was characterized in M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis, and the genes mshB, mshC, and mshD were found encoding for the enzymes that sequentially catalyze the formation of mycothiol from 1D-myo-inosityl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-α-d-glucopyranoside (GlcNAc-Ins). A fourth gene, mshA, is involved in the production of GlcAc-Ins, but the substrate of MshA has not been identified (9Newton G.L. Fahey R.C. Arch. Microbiol. 2002; 178: 388-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Orthologs of these msh genes could be found in the genome data of the Corynebacterium species, but their functions in biosynthesis of mycothiol have not been proven experimentally. During our studies on biosynthesis of mycothiol and assimilation of aromatic compounds with C. glutamicum, we found that mycothiol-negative mutants lost the ability to grow on several aromatic compounds. This surprising discovery raised the question of how mycothiol is involved in aromatic compound assimilation/degradation. In this report, our results indicate that mycothiol functions as an essential growth factor for C. glutamicum when gentisate and 3-hydroxybenzoate are provided as carbon sources. We further linked the biosynthesis of mycothiol to gentisate assimilation by identification of a mycothiol-dependent maleylpyruvate isomerase in C. glutamicum. Bacterial Strains and Culture Conditions—Bacterial strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Escherichia coli strains were grown aerobically on a rotary shaker (150 rpm) at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth or on LB plate with 1.5% (w/v) agar. C. glutamicum, Streptomyces clavuligerus, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus subtilis, and Streptomyces coelicolor were routinely grown in LB media on a rotary shaker (150 rpm) at 30 °C. To determine the growth with aromatic compounds, C. glutamicum strains were grown in mineral salts medium, pH 8.4, supplemented with 0.05 g liter–1 of yeast extract (15Shen X.H. Liu S.J. Sci. China Ser. C. 2005; 48: 241-249PubMed Google Scholar), on a rotary shaker (150 rpm) at 30 °C. Aromatic compounds were added at final concentrations of 2 mm. Cellular growth was monitored by measuring the turbidity at 600 nm. For generation of mutants and maintenance of C. glutamicum, BHIS (brain/heart broth with 0.5 m sorbitol) medium was used. When needed, antibiotics were used at the following concentrations: kanamycin, 50 μg ml–1 for E. coli and 25 μg ml–1 for C. glutamicum.TABLE 1Bacterial strains, plasmids, and primers used in this studyStrains, plasmids, and primersRelevant characteristics or sequencesSource/Ref.E. coliXL1-BluesupE44 hsdR17 recA1 endA1 gyrA46 thi relA1 lac- F′[proAB+ lacIq lacZΔM15 Tn10(tetT)]Stratagene (catalog No. 200249)BL21(DE3)hsdS gal (λcIts857 ind-l Sam7 nin-5 lacUV5-T7 gene 1)Novagen (catalog No. 69450-3)C. glutamicumRES167Restriction-deficient mutant of ATCC13032, Δ(cglIM-cglIR-cglIIR)Tauch et al.

Open table in a new tab Construction of Plasmids for Site-specific Gene Deletion—Plasmids pK18mobsacBΔncgl1055, pK18mobsacBΔncgl1457, and pK18mobsacB-Δncgl2487 were constructed using the gene-SOEing method described by Horton (19Horton R.M. Mol. Biotechnol. 1995; 3: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The primers used are listed in Table 1. The primary products were amplified using fusion DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). The resulting products were purified using the PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and then used as templates for the second round of PCR. The final products were digested with restriction enzymes corresponding to the cleavage sites introduced via PCR and ligated into appropriately digested pK18mobsacB. The ligation mixture was used to transform E. coli DH5αMCR, the transformants were selected on LB plates containing 50 μg ml–1 kanamycin and 40 μg ml–1 X-Gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside). To generate mutants in mycothiol biosynthesis from C. glutamicum, site-specific gene deletion was performed using the above generated pK18mobsacB derivatives that are not replicable in C. glutamicum and allow for marker-free deletion of the target genes (20Schäfer A. Tauch A. Jäger W. Kalinowski J. Thierbach G. Pühler A. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 145: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (2143) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids pK18mobsacBΔncgl1055, pK18mobsacBΔncgl1457, and pK18mobsacBΔncgl2487 were transformed into C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 by electroporation (21Tauch A. Kirchner O. Löffler B. Götker S. Pühler A. Kalinowski J. Curr. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Integration of the introduced plasmids into the chromosome by single crossover was tested by selection on BHIS plates containing 25 μgml–1 kanamycin. For the deletion of the target gene, the kanamycin-resistant (KmR) cells were grown overnight in liquid BHIS and spread on BHIS plates containing 10% sucrose. Cells growing on this plate were tested for kanamycin sensitivity (KmS) by parallel picking on BHIS plates containing either kanamycin or sucrose. Sucrose-resistant and kanamycin-sensitive cells were then tested for deletion by PCR, using the corresponding DF1 and DR2 primer pair (Table 1). Extraction and Determination of Mycothiol in Wild Type and Mutants of C. glutamicum—The detection of mycothiol from C. glutamicum cells was carried out according to the procedures as described by Newton et al. (2Newton G.L. Arnold K. Price M.S. Sherrill C. Delcardayre S.B. Aharonowitz Y. Cohen G. Davies J. Fahey R.C. Davis C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1990-1995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and was modified. One milliliter of 50% warm (60 °C) acetonitrile containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 2 mm bromobimane (Sigma) was added to a tube that contained 200 mg of frozen cells, sonificated at 60 °C for 20 s, and maintained in a 60 °C water bath for 15 min in dark. After acidification with 5 μl of 5 n methanesulfonic acid, the cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatants were diluted 3-fold in aqueous 10 mm methanesulfonic acid prior to HPLC 3The abbreviation used is: HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. analysis. The bimane derivatives of various thiols were separated and detected with HPLC that was equipped with a C18 column (ZORBAX, 250 × 4.6 mm) and was operated at the following conditions. The column was first eluted with 10% methanol (in water) for 5 min, and then the methanol content was increased to 100% in 10 min. The bimane derivative of mycothiol was eluated at 11.79 min in this system. Heterologous Expression of the Maleylpyruvate Isomerase Gene in E. coli and Purification of Recombinant Protein—The expression plasmid pET28a-ncgl2918 was described previously (18Shen X.H. Jiang C.Y. Huang Y. Liu Z.P. Liu S.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 3442-3452Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The plasmid was electroporated into E. coli BL21(DE3). Synthesis of recombinant protein in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells was initiated by addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside when the culture reached A600 of 0.6–0.8 and continued cultivation for an additional 8 h at 25°C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and were disrupted by sonification at 4 °C (160 W, 3 s sonifying versus 5 s break, 50 cycles) in Tris-HCl buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). Cellular lysate was centrifuged and the supernatant was used for protein purification. Recombinant protein was purified with the His-Bind protein purification kit (Novagen, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To remove any residue proteins, imidazole, and salts in the collected fractions, fractions were pooled and were further separated by Superdex™ 200 gel chromatography with Tris-HCl buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). All steps of chromatography were controlled by the fast protein liquid chromatography system (Äkta FPLC, Amersham Biosciences). The purified protein was concentrated by ultrafiltration through Millipore Ultra-15 (10 kDa) and stored at –70 °C. Determination of Molecular Mass of the Purified Proteins—The native molecular mass of the maleylpyruvate isomerase was estimated by gel filtration chromatography on a prepacked Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was equilibrated and eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) containing 100 mm NaCl at a flow rate of 0.4 ml min–1. Molecular mass was calculated according to their elution volume and calibrated with the molecular mass standard kit (MW-GF-1000, Sigma). The subunit molecular mass was determined with SDS-PAGE, which was conducted with a 5% stacking gel and 12% resolving gel and run in a Mini-PROTEIN II Electrophoresis Cell (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Apparent molecular mass was estimated according to the relative mobility to protein standards with molecular mass ranging from 14 to 97 kDa. Enzymatic Preparation of Maleylpyruvate and Determination of Maleylpyruvate Isomerase Activity—Maleylpyruvate was prepared from gentisate by gentisate 1,2-dioxygenase digestion (18Shen X.H. Jiang C.Y. Huang Y. Liu Z.P. Liu S.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 3442-3452Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) in a system containing (total volume 3 ml): 0.1 mm gentisate, 5 μl of recombinant 1,2-dioxygenase from E. coli, 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. After incubation at room temperature for 3 min (complete conversion of gentisate to maleylpyruvate), this mixture was used as the crude maleylpyruvate preparation without any further purification. For determination of maleylpyruvate isomerase activity, 10 μl of boiled cellular lysate of C. glutamicum and 5–10 μl of maleylpyruvate isomerase preparations were added to the above crude maleylpyruvate preparation. The maleylpyruvate isomerase activity was qualitatively monitored by scanning the spectral absorption changes at 250–400 nm with a UV visible spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter DU800) at a wavelength interval of 1 nm, and was quantitatively determined by measuring the decrease of absorbance at 330 nm due to maleylpyruvate disappearance. Rates of isomerization of maleylpyruvate to fumarylpyruvate were calculated with a value of 2,400 cm–1 m–1 for the extinction changes at 330 nm (22Hagedorn S.R. Bradley G. Chapman P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 640-647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test if coenzyme A and cysteine support maleylpyruvate isomerase activity, coenzyme A and cysteine (each 0.01 mm) were included in the assay broth. Protein concentration was determined according to the method of Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar), with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Preparation and Treatment of Various Bacterial Cellular Lysates—To evaluateifthefollowingbacteriacontainedthefactorthatsupportedmaleylpyruvate isomerase from C. glutamicum, cells of about 0.15 g from each of S. clavuligerus, B. megaterium, B. subtilis, S. coelicolor, and mutants of mshB, mshC, and mshD of C. glutamicum were disrupted by sonification at 4 °C (160 watts, 3 s sonifying versus 5 s break, 50 cycles) in Tris-HCl buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). Cellular debris was separated by centrifugation and the resulting supernatants were boiled for 5 min to eliminate any enzyme activities. The boiled supernatants (10 μl) were added to the maleylpyruvate isomerase activity assay mixtures, as described above. Isolation of Mycothiol from C. glutamicum—Isolation and purification of mycothiol from C. glutamicum was carried out by integration of Sephadex LH20 chromatography and the methods of Newton et al. (24Newton G.L. Bewley C.A. Dwyer T.J. Horn R. Aharonowitz Y. Cohen G. Davies J. Faulkner D.J. Fahey R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) with a thiol-affinity chromatography and Steenkamp et al. (25Steenkamp D.J. Spies H.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) with HPLC. Frozen cells (37 g) of C. glutamicum were thawed in 74 ml of 0.75 m perchloric acid. Acid-insoluble cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was adjusted to pH 4.5 with 4 m KOH and then stored at 0 °C for 30 min. Precipitated potassium perchlorate was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant (81 ml) was mixed with 27 ml of buffer A (0.4 m Tris-HCl, 2 m NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, pH 7.5). The mixture was applied onto a thiopropyl-Sepharose™ 6B column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed using 80 ml of buffer B (0.1 m Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5). The column was then eluted with 60 ml of buffer C (0.1 m Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 30 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5). Regeneration of this thiolpropyl-Sepharose 6B column was performed with 1.5 mm 2,2′-dipyridyl disulfide, according to instructions from the Thiolpropyl-Sepharose 6B supplier (Amersham Biosciences, catalog number 17-0420-01). The active eluant (2 ml) was applied onto a Sephadex LH20 column (Amersham Biosciences) and fractionated using 50% methanol in water, pH 4.5. The active fractions were concentrated with a rotary evaporator (Ratavapor, BÜCH RE121, Switzerland), lyophilized, and finally dissolved in water. Further purification of mycothiol was carried out with HPLC using isocratic elution (2% acetonitrile, 0.45% propionic acid) on a C18 column (ZORBAX, 250 × 4.6 mm). Mass Spectrometry—Positive-ion electrospray mass spectrometry analyses were performed on an Agilent 1100 LC/MSD Trap XCT instrument (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Instrument control, data acquisition, and data processing were done using the Agilent 1100 Chemstation (version 10.02) and Data Analysis (version 5.1) software. The instrument was operated in full-scan mode. Acquisition was performed in the continuum mode, and the acquisition parameters were as follows: tune source: trape drive (39.9), octopole RF amplitude (187.1 vpp), capillary exit (94.8 V), skim 1 (40.0 V), skim 2 (–5.0 V), dry temperature (325 °C), nebulizer (50.00 p.s.i.), nitrogen gas (10.00 liters/min), HV capillary (2680 V), HV end-plate offset (–500 V). The scan (average of three spectra) was between m/z 100–550 with maximal Accu time of 200,000 μs and ICC target of 200,000. Fragmentation was set with SmartFrag Ampl between 30 and 200%, fragmentation width, 10.00 m/z; fragmentation time, 40,000 μs; and fragmentation delay, 0 μs. Kinetic Measurements—Michaelis-Menten kinetics of the maleylpyruvate isomerization catalyzed with isomerase from C. glutamicum was identified by plotting reaction rates against substrate concentrations (ranging from 66 to 380 μm) at a mycothiol concentration of 2.5 μm. The apparent Km and Vmax values were determined by nonlinear regression analysis of the plots of the initial isomerization rates and substrate concentrations. Effects of Metal Ions and Chemicals on Maleylpyruvate Isomerase Activity—To test the effects of various metal ions and chemicals on the mycothiol-dependent maleylpyruvate isomerase, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Fe3+, Zn2+ (each 1 mm), GSH (0.05 mm), dithiothreitol (0.05 mm), EDTA (1 and 10 mm), and bromobimane (1 mm) were incubated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with the enzyme for 15 min at room temperature. The activities of the treated enzymes were assayed as described above. The enzyme without treatment was run in parallel as control. In M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis, mycothiol is synthesized through the catalysis by the MshA, MshB, MshC, and MshD proteins (9Newton G.L. Fahey R.C. Arch. Microbiol. 2002; 178: 388-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Putative genes orthologous to those encoding for MshA, MshB, MshC, and MshD were identified in the genomes of C. glutamicum and other Corynebacterium species (Table 2). To identify the functions of these genes, efforts on generation of mutations within these genes were made. C. glutamicum deletion mutants in mshB, mshC, and mshD were successfully constructed, and the mutation of each gene was subsequently confirmed by PCR. HPLC analysis showed that wild type and the mshB– mutant produced mycothiol, and mshB– produced about 5% of the wild type, but the mutants mshC– and mshD– did not produce detectable levels of Msh (Fig. 1, A–D).TABLE 2BLAST searching results and annotated and identified functions of genes involved in mycothiol biosynthesis of C. glutamicumGene and positionAnnotated function of gene productsIdentified function of gene productsSequence identityRelated gene products (organism, locus_tag)bpncgl0389/mshA 423878-425134Predicted glycosyltransferaseMshA glycosyltransferase349/409 (85%)Conserved hypothetical protein (C. efficiens, CE0422)291/405 (71%)Putative glycosyl transferase (C. diphtheriae, DIP0388)232/407 (57%)Putative glycosyltransferase (N. farcinica, nfa51920)213/421 (50%)MshA (M. tuberculosis, Rv0486)205/433 (47%)Putative glycosyltransferase (S. coelicolor, SCO4204)ncgl1055/mshB 1147592-1148464Hypothetical proteinMshB deacetylase210/299 (70%)Hypothetical protein (C. efficiens, CE1158)185/281 (65%)Hypothetical protein (C. diphtheriae, DIP0971)136/296 (45%)Hypothetical protein (N. farcinica, nfa47570)113/292 (38%)MshB (M. tuberculosis, Rv1170)113/296 (38%)Hypothetical protein (S. coelicolor, SCO5126)ncgl1457/mshC 1596246-1597508Cysteinyl-tRNA synthetaseMshC ligase346/430 (80%)Cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase (C. efficiens, CE1639)266/421 (63%)Cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase (C. diphtheriae, DIP1261)250/420 (59%)Putative cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase (N. farcinica, nfa29340)241/426 (56%)MshC (M. tuberculosis, Rv2130c)231/426 (54%)Putative cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase (S. coelicolor, SCO1663)ncgl2487/mshD 2737834-2738712Histone acetyltransferase HPA2-like proteinMshD acetyltransferease197/292 (67%)Hypothetical protein CE2468 (C. efficiens, CE2468)132/294 (44%)Putative acetyltransferase (C. diphtheriae, DIP1911)113/294 (38%)Putative acetyltransferase (N. farcinica, nfa5990)105/297 (35%)Putative acetyltransferase (S. coelicolor, SCO4151)109/311 (35%)Hypothetical protein (M. tuberculosis, Rv0819) Open table in a new tab All the mutants mshB–, mshC–, and mshD– grew as well as the wild type strain of C. glutamicum, and there were no significant phenotypic differences observed, when cultivated in LB and BHIS media. However, we found that the mutants mshC– and mshD– lost the ability to grow on gentisate as the sole carbon source (Fig. 2). To see if their abilities to grow on other aromatic compounds were disturbed, these mutants were tested for growth on various aromatic compounds as carbon sources. The results obtained showed that mutants mshC– and mshD– also lost the ability to grow on 3-hydroxybenzoate, but their ability to assimilate 4-hydroxybenzoate, benzoate, phenol, and resorcinol was not disturbed (Table 3). Previous studies revealed that (i) benzoate was assimilated through the catechol 1,2-dioxygenase pathway (17Shen X.H. Liu Z.P. Liu S.J. Biotechnol.

https://openalex.org/W2154209855,"The endoplasmic reticulum-resident chaperone heat-shock protein 47 (HSP47) plays an essential role in procollagen biosynthesis. The function of HSP47 relies on its specific interaction with correctly folded triple-helical regions comprised of Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeats, and Arg residues at Yaa positions have been shown to be important for this interaction. The amino acid at the Yaa position (Yaa-3) in the N-terminal-adjoining triplet containing the critical Arg (defined as Arg0) was also suggested to be directly recognized by HSP47 (Koide, T., Asada, S., Takahara, Y., Nishikawa, Y., Nagata, K., and Kitagawa, K. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 281, 3432-3438). Based on this finding, we examined the relationship between the structure of Yaa-3 and HSP47 binding using synthetic collagenous peptides. The results obtained indicated that the structure of Yaa-3 determined the binding affinity for HSP47. Maximal binding was observed when Yaa-3 was Thr. Moreover, the required relative spatial arrangement of these key residues in the triple helix was analyzed by taking advantage of heterotrimeric collagen-model peptides, each of which contains one Thr-3 and one Arg0. The results revealed that HSP47 recognizes the Yaa-3 and Arg0 residues only when they are on the same peptide strand. Taken together, the data obtained led us to define the HSP47-binding structural epitope in the collagen triple helix and also define the HSP47-binding motif in the primary structure. A motif search against human protein database predicted candidate clients for this molecular chaperone.

Disruption of both alleles of the hsp47 gene in mice causes abnormal procollagen folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), resulting in an embryonic lethal phenotype (1Nagai N. Hosokawa M.

Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5913-5922Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although the molecular function of HSP47 remains unclear, it has been suggested that HSP47 could stabilize correctly folded triple-helical intermediates of procollagen that are otherwise unstable at body temperature (3Tasab M. Batten M.R. Bulleid N.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2204-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 4Koide T. Aso A. Yorihuzi T. Nagata K. J. Biol.

HSP47 has also been suggested to inhibit lateral associations that form insoluble aggregates in the ER (5Thomson C.A. Ananthanarayanan V.S. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Efforts toward elucidating the collagen-recognition mechanism of HSP47 have been made by our group and others, and to date, Arg residues at Yaa positions in the collagenous Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeats have been shown to be necessary for interaction with HSP47 (6Koide T. Takahara Y. Asada S. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6178-6182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 7Tasab M. Jenkinson L. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol.

The importance of the triple-helical structure for HSP47 binding has also been strongly suggested, and it was finally proven in the preceding paper by using conformationally constrained collagenous peptides (8Koide T. Asada S. Takahara Y. Nishikawa Y. Nagata K. Kitagawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3432-3438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The minimal number of Arg residues per triple helix required for the specific interaction was further determined to be one. In addition, the Yaa residue occupying position -3 (denoted as Yaa-3, and similar nomenclatures are used later), based on the essential Arg residue at a Yaa position (whose position is defined as position 0), has also been suggested to be important for the interaction, since replacement of the 4-hydoxy-l-proline (Hyp) residue at position -3 in (Pro-Hyp-Gly)2-Pro-Hyp-3-Gly-Pro-Arg0-Gly-(Pro-Hyp-Gly)4-Pro-Hyp-amide with p-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine (Bpa) abolished the binding, even though the peptide had a triple-helical structure and contained an Arg residue at a Yaa position. In the present study, we focused on the structure of Yaa-3, which was expected to be another structural determinant for HSP47 binding, together with the side chain structure of Arg0. A structure-activity relationship study was performed using collagen-like peptides with various Yaa-3 substitutions. Moreover, the three-dimensional arrangement of the Yaa-3 and Arg0 residues required for HSP47 binding was determined by utilizing heterotrimeric collagen-model peptides with different fixed chain arrangements. To date, HSP47 has been shown to interact with at least the major types of collagen, including types I to V (9Natsume T. Koide T. Yokota S.-i. Hirayoshi K. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31224-31228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it has not been elucidated whether all 27 types of mammalian collagens require the assistance of HSP47 during their folding processes. In addition, there is currently little available information regarding the interactions of HSP47 with other collagen-related proteins. In the final part of this article, we show the results of a motif search for HSP47-binding proteins against human protein data bases using an originally developed computational search program and predict possible clients of HSP47. Synthetic Peptides—Peptide chains were constructed manually based on the N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl-based solid-phase method on Rink-amide resins (Novabiochem, Darmstadt, Germany). Heterotrimerization of the peptides were conducted according to the procedure described elsewhere (Ref. 10Koide T. Nishikawa Y. Takahara Y. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2004; 14: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar and also see supplemental materials). The peptides were purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography and characterized by electron spray-ionization mass spectrometry or matrix-assisted laser-depsorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Prior to use, all peptide solutions were kept at 4 °C for at least 2 days to allow the formation of triple helices. CD Spectrometry—To characterize the conformational states of the synthetic collagen-like peptides, CD spectra of the refolded trimers (1 mg/ml in 20 mm bis-Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl) were recorded on a Jasco J-820 spectropolarimeter as described previously (10Koide T. Nishikawa Y. Takahara Y. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2004; 14: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thermal transition curves of the triple helices were determined by monitoring the changes in the molar ellipticity at 225 nm at a heating rate of 0.3 °C/min. All the peptides were triple-helical in the buffer used for the experiments at the temperature at which the binding assays were conducted. Solid-phase Peptide Binding (Peptide Pull-down) Assay—Solid-phase binding assays to examine HSP47 binding to peptide-immobilized Sepharose beads were performed as reported previously (6Koide T. Takahara Y. Asada S. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6178-6182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, Escherichia coli lysates containing either recombinant mouse (11Koide T. Asada S. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34523-34526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) or human (12Yokota S.-i. Kubota H. Matsuoka Y. Naitoh M. Hirata D. Minota S. Takahashi H. Fujii N. Nagata K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 303: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) HSP47 protein (70 μl) were mixed with 130 μl of binding buffer (50 mm HEPES-Na (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) and 25-μl bed of the affinity beads. The binding was carried out at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle rotation. After washing, the proteins retained on the beads were eluted with 2× Laemmli's SDS sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.7), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.002% bromphenol blue) and separated by SDS-PAGE in 12% gels. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (CBB). Purification of HSP47—Recombinant mouse HSP47 was purified from E. coli lysates by gelatin-affinity chromatography essentially as described previously (8Koide T. Asada S. Takahara Y. Nishikawa Y. Nagata K. Kitagawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3432-3438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 13Saga S. Nagata K. Chen W.T. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Competition Assay—Competitive binding assays were conducted at 25 °C on a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor (BIACORE X; Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The R/R/R peptide (10Koide T. Nishikawa Y. Takahara Y. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2004; 14: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) was immobilized on the surface of a CM5 sensor chip to 495.2 resonance units using standard amine coupling at pH 5.6, according to the manufacturer's protocol. The binding reaction was performed in 50 mm bis-Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.005% Tween 20. Purified HSP47 was preincubated with various concentrations of the competitor peptides for 10 min at 25 °C. Each analyte solution was run over the sensor chip three times at a flow rate of 40 μl/min. The bulk shift due to changes in the refractive index measured using a mock-coupled surface was subtracted from the binding signal under each condition to obtain the specific signals. The surface was regenerated by washing with 5 μl of 100 mm HCl. Computational HSP47-binding Protein Search—Search programs were written in Perl CGI scripts (Perl 5.8.1) and run on an Apache 1.3.33 HTML server preinstalled on a local Apple Macintosh Darwin Core system. Collections of FASTA-formatted amino acid sequence files from sequenced Homo sapiens (human), Mus musculus (mouse), and Rattus norvegicus (rat) genes were downloaded from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes anonymous FTP site to the local host. The total numbers of H. sapiens, M. musculus, and R. norvegicus genes registered in each database were 23,476, 25,371, and 21,879, respectively. Briefly, HSP47-binding proteins were extracted from the database by following steps: 1) extraction of proteins containing at least 6 Xaa-Yaa-Gly repeats with two (or more) Pro in its Xaa- or Yaa positions; 2) elimination of proteins whose Xaa-Yaa-Gly repeated region was compatible with 9 repeats of Gly or three repeats of Gly-Xaa-Gly, thereby resulting in the selection of collagenous proteins; and 3) extraction of proteins with Yaa-Gly-Xaa-Arg in their triple-helical region to obtain putative HSP47-binding proteins. The binding sites were classified into “high affinity” (Yaa-3 is Thr or Pro), medium affinity (Yaa-3 is Ser, Val, or Ala) and low affinity (Yaa-3 is Ile, Leu, Asn, Met, His, Phe, or Tyr) sites, according to the results of the competitive binding assays (see supplemental materials). Cell Culture—HepG2 (human hepatoma cell line, JCRB1054) and THP-1 (human monocyte leukemia cell line, JCRB0112.1) cells were obtained from Health Science Research Resources Bank (Osaka, Japan). The Chinese Hamster ovary cell line stably expressing human CL-P1 (CL-P1/CHO-ldlA7) was established as described previously (14Ohtani K. Suzuki Y. Eda S. Kawai T. Kase T. Keshi H. Sakai Y. Fukuoh A.

Cells were grown for 2 days post confluence with their optimal medium containing 50 μg/ml sodium ascorbate. Glutathione S-Transferase (GST)-HSP47 Binding Assay (GST Pull-down Assay)—Human serum was obtained from one of the authors of this article. Cell lysates were obtained by resuspension of collected cells into lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40), followed by the removal of insoluble materials by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min. Three-hundred μg of lysate or 100 μl of human serum was mixed with a 30-μl bed volume of GST- or GST-HSP47 fusion protein-bound glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden). After washing the beads with TBST buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.005% Tween 20) three times, proteins retained on the beads were separated by SDS-PAGE using 4-20% gradient gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) skim milk in TBST and incubated with anti-complement 1q (C1q) antibody (sc-27658, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Macrophage scavenger receptor (0100-0404, Biogenesis, Poole, UK), rabbit anti-CL-L1 polyclonal serum, rabbit anti-CL-P1 polyclonal serum (14Ohtani K. Suzuki Y. Eda S. Kawai T. Kase T. Keshi H. Sakai Y. Fukuoh A. Sakamoto T. Itabe H. Suzutani T. Ogasawara M. Yoshida I. Wakamiya N. J. Biol.

Horseradish peroxidase- or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody was used and the immunoreactive bands were visualized with a peroxidase staining kit (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) or an alkaline phosphatase substrate kit (Bio-Rad) as appropriate. Yaa-3 and Arg0 in the Collagen Triple Helix Are Key Residues for the Interaction with HSP47—HSP47 has been shown to interact with Xaa-Arg-Gly (where Xaa is any amino acid) sequences in triple-helical regions of collagen (6Koide T. Takahara Y. Asada S. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6178-6182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 7Tasab M. Jenkinson L. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35007-35012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). As shown in previous binding assays, replacement of the Hyp-3 residue of (Pro-Hyp-Gly)2-Pro-Hyp-3-Gly-Pro-Arg0-Gly-(Pro-Hyp-Gly)4-Pro-Hyp-amide with a Bpa residue results in complete loss of HSP47 binding, while similar substitutions of other positions have little effect on the binding (8Koide T. Asada S. Takahara Y. Nishikawa Y. Nagata K. Kitagawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3432-3438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that the amino acid Yaa-3 is another key residue for recognition by HSP47. Based on this finding, the relationship between the structure of the Yaa-3 residue and HSP47 binding was first analyzed using (Pro-Hyp-Gly)3-Pro-Yaa-3-Gly-Pro-Arg0-Gly-(Pro-Hyp-Gly)4-amide with various substitutions in the Yaa-3 residue. The peptides synthesized and used are shown in Fig. 1. Gly, Trp, and Cys residues, which are rarely found in Yaa positions of native collagens (15Ramshaw J.A.M. Shah N.K. Brodsky B. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 122: 86-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), were omitted. All the peptides formed triple-helical structures at 25 °C in the buffer used for the experiments, as judged by CD spectroscopic analyses (data not shown). The peptides were immobilized onto N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)-activated beads, and their interactions with recombinant HSP47 were examined by peptide-pull-down assays. The Lys-containing col.KR peptide was omitted from these assays because its ϵ-amino group would react with the NHS group. As shown in Fig. 2A, the amounts of HSP47 retained on the beads appeared to differ depending on the structure of the Yaa-3 residue. The bindings with col.TR and col.PR were the most prominent, followed by those with col.SR and col.OR. When Asp, Asn, Glu, and Gln were incorporated at the Yaa-3 position, the protein band corresponding to bound HSP47 was hardly detected on the gel, although they all contained Arg residues at Yaa-positions.FIGURE 2Interaction of HSP47 with collagen-like peptides with various Yaa-3 residues. A, binding of HSP47 to (Pro-Hyp-Gly)3-Pro-Yaa-3-Gly-Pro-Arg0-Gly-(Pro-Hyp-Gly)4-amide immobilized to Sepharose beads. An E. coli lysate containing HSP47 was mixed with affinity beads on which the peptides were immobilized. After washing, the proteins retained on the beads were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and visualized by CBB staining. The molecular sizes are shown in kilodaltons. B, competitive binding assays on BIACORE. HSP47 binding was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data for only 10 of the 19 peptides are shown because of the space limitation. Values are means ± S.D. (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The relative HSP47 binding affinities of these peptides were further determined by competition assays on an SPR biosensor. Purified HSP47 protein was mixed with varying concentrations of the competitor peptides and injected over a sensor chip on which an Arg-containing homotrimeric peptide, R/R/R (10Koide T. Nishikawa Y. Takahara Y. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2004; 14: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), was immobilized. In these assays, the col.RR peptide was designed as (Pro-Hyp-Gly)2-Pro-Glu-6-Gly-Pro-Arg-3-Gly-Pro-Arg0-Gly-(Pro-Hyp-Gly)4-amide to discriminate between the two Arg residues at positions Yaa0 and Yaa-3 by placing a disfavored Glu residue at position Yaa-6 (Figs. 1 and 2A). The inhibition curves obtained by plotting the bound HSP47 signals (Fig. 2B) were used to estimate the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50 values) (Table 1). The results were consistent with those obtained by the peptide pull-down assay (Fig. 2A). The IC50 values were found to range from the submicromolar level for col.TR and col.PR to over 100 μm. Regarding the Yaa-3 residue, small hydrophobic and hydroxyl-containing amino acids were preferred by HSP47, while amino acids with long or charged side chains were disfavored. The pair of Thr-3 and Arg0 was revealed to serve as the best client structure for HSP47. A Pro residue at the Yaa-3 position was also found to contribute to the high affinity binding. However, it should be noted that in the folding pathway of procollagen, most of the Pro residues in Yaa positions are enzymatically converted to Hyp residues, prior to the triple helix formation. In addition, no correlation between the IC50 values and the Tm (melting temperature) values of the triple helices were observed (Table 1).TABLE 1Determined IC50 and Tm valuesPeptideIC50aIC50 values represent the means ± S.D. obtained from three independent determinations.

The collagen triple helix is a supercoil of three polyproline II-like helices with a one-residue stagger relative to each other (16Bella J. Eaton M. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. Science. 1994; 266: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Thus, five different spatial arrangements for the combination of these two key residues are possible (Fig. 3A, right). Therefore, we next investigated which arrangement is recognized by HSP47 by employing a system utilizing heterotrimeric collagen-like peptides. Covalently linked trimeric peptides 1-5 were designed to possess fixed arrangements of the two important residues (Fig. 3A). Here, we used cystine knots to tether the three peptide strands, since cystine knots were reported to be structurally compatible with the collagen triple helix and a one-residue stagger between the adjacent chains can be unambiguously introduced (17Ottl J. Moroder L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 653-661Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Only one of the three N-terminal amino groups was left free to enable immobilization onto amine-reactive Sepharose beads in a fixed molecular orientation. In these heterotrimers, the position of the Arg residue was fixed to a Yaa0-position, and one Thr and two Glu residues were introduced at the three corresponding Yaa-3-positions in five different combinations (Fig. 3A). In these peptides, Thr and Glu residues were chosen as representatives of the favored and disfavored amino acids for HSP47 binding, respectively (Fig. 2 and Table 1). These heterotrimeric peptides were triple-helical at the assay temperature, showing similar positive Θ225 values to one another on CD measurements (Fig. 3B). The Tm values for the triple helices of these peptides were also similar to one another (around 45 °C). After coupling to Sepharose beads, the interactions of these trimeric peptides with HSP47 were examined by solid-phase pull-down assays. As shown in Fig. 3C, HSP47 only specifically interacted with Trimer 3, in which the Thr residue and Arg residue are present in the same peptide strand. Thus, the structure required for HSP47 binding is describable in the primary structure. Based on the results shown in Table 1, HSP47-binding motifs were determined as shown in Table 2, and classified for convenience, into “high affinity,” “medium affinity.” and “low affinity” sites according to their IC50 values.TABLE 2HSP47-binding motifsHSP47-binding motifIC50Yaa in Yaa-Gly-Pro-Arg-GlyμmHigh affinityIC50 < 1Thr, ProMedium affinity1 ≤ IC50 < 10Ser, Hyp, Val, AlaLow affinity10 ≤ IC50 < 100Ile, Leu, Asn, Met, His, Phe, Tyr Open table in a new tab HSP47-binding Sites in Native Procollagens—The identification of HSP47-binding motifs (Table 2) enabled us to estimate the number and localization of HSP47-binding sites in the triple-helical regions of native procollagens. In a previous report (6Koide T. Takahara Y. Asada S. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6178-6182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we proposed that bovine type III procollagen possesses 32 HSP47-binding sites based on the knowledge that Xaa-Arg-Gly sequences form these binding sites. Similarly, 40 binding sites were predicted to be present in human type III procollagen. Thomson and Ananthanarayanan (18Thomson C.A. Tenni R. Ananthanarayanan V.S. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1792-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) later pointed out the possibility that we had overestimated the number of HSP47-binding sites, based on their results for HSP47 binding assays using CNBr-cleaved collagen fragments. The estimated numbers of HSP47-binding sites were revised in the present study by taking the structures of the amino acids at Yaa-3 positions into consideration. The central triple-helical region (1029 amino acid residues) of human type III procollagen contains a total of 29 possible HSP47-binding sites (Fig. 4). Assuming that all the Pro residues at Yaa-positions are converted to Hyp residues prior to triple helix formation, two high affinity binding sites matching the Thr-Gly-Xaa-Arg motif are found. The numbers of the medium and low affinity sites are estimated to be 24 and 3, respectively. Prediction of HSP47 Clients—Since most studies on HSP47 have been carried out by only looking at abundant types of collagens, such as types I, III, and IV etc., the involvement of HSP47 in the biosynthesis of minor collagens or collagen-related proteins has been less extensively investigated. The identification of HSP47-binding motifs further enabled us to search for proteins that could interact with HSP47. By using a newly developed computational search program, we selected candidate HSP47-binding proteins from human, rat, and mouse genome databases. The search results derived from the human genome data base are shown in Table 3. Among 102 putative collagenous proteins possessing at least six repeats of the Xaa-Yaa-Gly triplet, 80 proteins contained sequences matching the HSP47-binding motif. All the genes encoding precursors of the α-chains of all types of collagen (types I to XXVII, Table 3, entries 1-40) were revealed to contain multiple HSP47-binding sites, regardless of the subclassifications based on their supramolecular structures, and no significant differences in the frequencies of occurrence were found among the collagen types. These results therefore imply that all collagen precursors are clients of HSP47. In addition to the collagen family, a number of collagen-related proteins, such as pulmonary-surfactant proteins (entries 41-43), ficolins (entries 44 and 45), macrophage scavenger receptors (entries 46 and 47), C1q (entries 48 and 49), C1q-related proteins (entries 52-57), asymmetric acetylcholinesterase (ColQ, entry 50), and some collectins (entries 59 and 63) were also selected as possible HSP47-interacting proteins.TABLE 3Human proteins possessing the HSP47-binding motifa Most of the Pro residues at Yaa positions would be converted to Hyp prior to triple helix formationb The existence of a HSP47-binding motif is not conserved among speciesc Cytosolic or nuclear proteinsd Only DNA sequences are available Open table in a new tab a Most of the Pro residues at Yaa positions would be converted to Hyp prior to triple helix formation b The existence of a HSP47-binding motif is not conserved among species c Cytosolic or nuclear proteins d Only DNA sequences are available To confirm this prediction, five collagen-related proteins were examined their binding ability to GST-HSP47 immobilized to Sepharose beads. C1q, which has one medium affinity and one low affinity HSP47-binding motif (OGXR and LGXR) in its A-chain (entry 48), was shown to specifically interact with GST-HSP47 (Fig. 5A, C1QA). Macrophage scavenger receptor 1 (MSR1, entry 46) with two medium affinity sites, collectin liver 1 (CL-L1/COLEC10, entry 63) with one low affinity site, and collectin placenta 1 (CL-P1/COLEC12, entry 59) with four medium affinity sites also showed specific binding to GST-HSP47 (Fig. 5A, MSR1, CL-L1, and CL-P1). On the other hand, mannnose-binding lectin (MBL2), which has no HSP47-binding site (data not shown), did not show any detectable binding (Fig. 5A, MBL2). These results obtained by the in vitro binding assay proved the validity of our in silico search.

All compounds displayed a biphasic effect on mitochondrial respiration with uncoupling at low concentrations and respiratory inhibition at higher concentrations, the relative uncoupling potency being BH3I-2′ (half-maximal uncoupling at about 80 nm) > Chelerythrine (half-maximal uncoupling at about 2 μm) > HA14-1 (half-maximal uncoupling at about 20 μm). At concentrations lower than required for uncoupling all compounds sensitized the permeability transition pore (PTP) to opening both in isolated mitochondria and intact cells.

Antiapoptotic proteins of the BCL-2 family contribute to neoplastic cell expansion by suppressing physiological cell death mechanisms and by increasing the resistance to anticancer drugs. High levels of the BCL-2 protein can be found in cells selected for their resistance to chemotherapeutic agents (1Sartorius U.A. Krammer P.H. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 97: 584-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and this makes BCL-2 an attractive target for cancer therapy (2Reed J.C. Nat. Rev.

Despite intense research on this topic, the mechanisms through which BCL-2 prevents apoptosis are not fully understood (4Igney F.H. Krammer P.H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1646) Google Scholar). The protein dimerizes with other members of the family, which comprises both pro- and antiapoptotic members; and it is widely believed that the outcome for cell survival depends on the ratio of pro- to antiapoptotic BCL-2-like proteins (5Adams J.M. Cory S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 61-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). A computer screening based on the structure of the close BCL-2 relative, BCL-XL, has identified HA14-1, 6The abbreviations used are: HA14-1, ethyl 2-amino-6-bromo-4-(1-cyano-2-ethoxy-2-oxoethyl)-4H-chromene-3-carboxylate; B-CLL, B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia; BH3I-2′, 3-iodo-5-chloro-N-[2-chloro-5-((4-chlorophenyl)sulfonyl)phenyl]-2-hydroxybenzamide; Chelerythrine, 1,2-dimethoxy-12-methyl[1,3]benzodioxolo[5,6-c]phenantridinium; Cs, cyclosporin; EM20-25, 5-(6-chloro-2,4-dioxo-1,3,4,10-tetrahydro-2H-9-oxa-1,3-diaza-anthracen-10-yl)-pyrimidine-2,4,6-trione; FCCP, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HA, human influenza hemagglutinin; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PT, permeability transition; PTP, permeability transition pore; siRNA, small interfering RNA; TMRM, tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester. a small organic ligand that is able to displace a peptide modeled on the BCL-2 binding region of BAK, a proapoptotic member of the family (6Wang J.-L. Liu D. Zhang Z.-J. Shan S. Han X. Srinivasula S.M. Croce C.M. Alnemri E.S. Huang Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7124-7129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). Remarkably, HA14-1 was able to cause cell death that was preceded by activation of caspase-9 and -3 and caused mitochondrial depolarization in situ (6Wang J.-L. Liu D. Zhang Z.-J. Shan S. Han X.

Similar results have been reported for antimycin A, which displays a striking BCL-2 binding activity that is retained by a 2-methoxy derivative devoid of inhibitory effects on respiration (7Tzung S.P.

Chem. 2003; 278: 20453-20456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), which were identified by high throughput screening of chemical libraries. These findings point to mitochondria as the targets for the effects of BCL-2 ligands. Mitochondria are important players in the pathways to cell death through at least three mechanisms: (i) changes of ATP production, (ii) alteration of Ca2+ homeostasis, (iii) release of apoptogenic proteins like cytochrome c and Smac-Diablo that activate procaspase-9 and then downstream caspases (10Bernardi P. Petronilli V. Di Lisa F. Forte M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 112-117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). A mechanistic link between BCL-2, mitochondria, and cell death is provided by the reported inhibition of the release of cytochrome c and of other mitochondrial proteins by BCL-2 overexpression (11Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Castedo M. Hirsch T. Marchetti P. Macho A. Daugas E. Geuskens M. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1331-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar, 12Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K.

Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4277) Google Scholar). Although it appears reasonable that the proapoptotic effects of HA14-1, BH3Is, and Chelerythrine are mediated by interactions with BCL-2 in mitochondria, the mechanistic basis for the mitochondrial effects of these drugs has not been established. Specifically, the depolarizing and/or cytochrome c-releasing effects of BCL-2 ligands could be due to opening of the PTP, an inner membrane channel that is reportedly inhibited by BCL-2 overexpression (11Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Castedo M. Hirsch T. Marchetti P. Macho A. Daugas E. Geuskens M. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1331-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar), or to interference with energy coupling and/or respiration. Assessing whether BCL-2 ligands directly affect electron transfer appears particularly important in the light of the finding that antimycin A, the selective inhibitor of electron transfer at the bc1 complex, also binds to BCL-2 at the same site as HA14-1 (7Tzung S.P. Kim K.M. Basanez G. Giedt C.D. Simon J. Zimmerberg J. Zhang K.Y. Hockenbery D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). In this paper we have investigated the mitochondrial and cellular effects of BH3I-2′, Chelerythrine, and HA14-1. All three compounds displayed a biphasic effect on mitochondrial respiration with uncoupling at low concentrations and respiratory inhibition at higher concentrations, the relative uncoupling potency being BH3I-2′ > Chelerythrine > HA14-1, and they all sensitized the PTP to opening at concentrations lower than required for uncoupling both in isolated mitochondria and intact cells. BCL-2 overexpression did not sensitize but rather protected cells from the cytotoxic effects of the BCL-2 ligands. We show that the BCL-2 binding and PTP-inducing effects can be separated from the potentially toxic effects on respiration through the identification of EM20-25, a molecule devoid of effects on mitochondrial respiration that is able to induce PTP opening in isolated mitochondria and intact cells, to disrupt the BCL-2/BAX interactions in situ with activation of caspase-9 and to sensitize leukemic cells to the killing effects of staurosporine, chlorambucil, and fludarabine. Measurements on Isolated Mitochondria—Liver mitochondria were isolated from albino Wistar rats weighing about 300 g by standard centrifugation techniques, as described previously (14Costantini P. Petronilli V. Colonna R. Bernardi P. Toxicology. 1995; 99: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Oxygen consumption was measured polarographically with a Clark oxygen electrode in a closed 2-ml vessel equipped with magnetic stirring and thermostated at 25 °C. Mitochondrial swelling was followed as the change of light scattering of the mitochondrial suspension at 545 nm with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 650-40 fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with magnetic stirring and thermostatic control. Cell Cultures—PC3 human prostate cancer cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine. HeLa Neo and HeLa BCL-2 cells (a generous gift of Dr. Naoufal Zamzami, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine. The media were all supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units × ml–1 penicillin, and 50 μg × ml–1 streptomycin. Cells were kept in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C in a Forma tissue culture water jacketed incubator. Analysis of BCL-2, BCL-XL, and GAPDH Expression in Different Cell Lines—One day before the experiment, 1 × 106 PC3, HeLa Neo, and HeLa BCL-2 cells were plated onto 100-mm diameter tissue culture dishes in the appropriate growth medium and incubated at 37 °C. Cells were then harvested, sedimented, washed once with ice-cold PBS, resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin), incubated 30 min on ice, and finally Dounce-homogenized. The homogenates were sedimented at full speed in a microcentrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris and nuclei. The supernatants, corresponding to the soluble cellular extracts, were transferred to clean tubes, and the protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay. Equal protein amounts (100 μg) were solubilized in Laemmli gel sample buffer containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, separated electrophoretically by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to Western blotting analysis using a mouse anti-human BCL-2 antibody (clone 7, BD Biosciences) or a rabbit anti-human BCL-XL antibody (clone 54HD, Cell Signaling Technology†), as described below. The same membranes were then washed, stripped as described below, and probed with a mouse monoclonal antibody against rabbit skeletal muscle GAPDH (clone 6C5, Chemicon International, Inc.). Purification of B-CLL Cells—B-CLL was diagnosed according to standard clinical and laboratory criteria, and patients who had not yet received treatment were studied. Mononuclear cells were recovered following centrifugation on Ficoll-Hypaque gradient (15Cerutti A. Trentin L. Zambello R. Sancetta R. Milani A. Tassinari C. Adami F. Agostini C. Semenzato G. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1854-1862PubMed Google Scholar). Cell samples were washed three times with PBS and resuspended in endotoxin free RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 20 mm HEPES and l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum (ICN Flow, Costa Mesa, CA). T cells were removed from the entire cell suspension by rosetting with neuroaminidase (Sigma)-treated sheep red blood cells. Additional enrichment of B cells was obtained by removing residual CD3+, CD16+, and CD56+ lymphocytes using high gradient magnetic separation columns (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany), as described previously (16Trentin L. Zambello R. Agostini C. Enthammer C. Cerutti A. Adami F. Zamboni S. Semenzato G. Blood. 1994; 84: 4249-4256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 × 106 cells obtained as above were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in 80 μl of PBS with purified azide-free CD3 (OKT3, Ortho Pharmaceuticals, Raritan, NJ), CD16 (Leu-11c, BD Biosciences) and CD56 (Leu-19) monoclonal antibodies. After two washes with PBS supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 20 μl of colloidal superparamagnetic microbeads conjugated with goat-anti-mouse-IgG antibodies were added. The CD3+, CD16+, and CD56+ cells rosetting with microbeads were then isolated and removed applying a magnetic system to the outer wall of the columns. Following this multistep negative selection procedure, more than 98% of the resulting cell population was CD19+ and BCL-2+ with high density expression of BCL-2 as defined by mean fluorescence intensities, which were comparable in all cells. The expression of BCL-2 was detected using flow cytometric analysis with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled mouse anti-hBcl-2 monoclonal antibody (Clone 124, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Cells were fixed and permeabilized using Fix and Perm kit (Caltag) for 15 min at room temperature and then stained with anti-BCL-2 antibody for 30 min. A fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled mouse IgG1 monoclonal antibody was used as a negative control. Fluorescence Microscopy—One-hundred thousand cells were seeded onto 24-mm diameter round glass coverslips in 6-well plates and grown for 1 day. The coverslips were then transferred onto the stage of a Zeiss Axiovert 100TV inverted microscope equipped with a HBO mercury lamp (100 watts), and epifluorescence was detected with a 12-bit digital cooled CCD camera (Micromax, Princeton Instruments). Cells were incubated in Hanks' balanced salt solution without bicarbonate and phenol red and allowed to equilibrate with 20 nm TMRM in the presence of 1.6 μm CsH or 1 μm CsA for 30 min at 37 °C prior to further additions. Fluorescence images were acquired with a 560-nm dichroic mirror using a 40×/1.3 oil immersion objective (Zeiss), with excitation at 546 ± 5 nm and emission at 580 ± 15 nm. Exposure time was 80 ms, and data were acquired and analyzed with the MetaMorph Metafluour Imaging Software. Clusters of several mitochondria were identified as regions of interest, whereas background was taken from fields not containing cells. Sequential digital images were acquired every 2 min for 60 min, and the average fluorescence intensity of all the regions of interest and of the background was recorded and stored for subsequent analysis. Mitochondrial fluorescence intensities minus background were normalized to the initial fluorescence for comparative purposes. Cell Viability—The number of viable cells was assessed based on the Resazurin assay as described (17O'Brien J. Wilson I. Orton T. Pognan F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5421-5426Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar, 18Gugliucci A. Ranzato L. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Petronilli V. Cusan C. Prato M. Mancini M. Pagano F. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31789-31795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in 96-well microtiter plates (20 × 103 cells/well) in their medium (0.2 ml/well) for 1 day. Cells grown on each well were then treated for 16 h as described in the legend to Fig. 5 in the Forma incubator. After treatment the medium was replaced with fresh medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) Resazurin for 3 h. The ratio of oxidized to reduced Resazurin (which reflects the metabolic activity of viable cells) was detected at 540/620 nm with a microplate reader (Spectracount™ Packard). We verified that the ratio increased linearly with the number of cells in the range used in the experiments. Immunoprecipitation—The day before the experiment, 1 × 106 HeLa BCL-2 cells were plated onto 100-mm diameter tissue culture dishes in the appropriate growth medium and incubated at 37 °C until a confluence of about 80–90% was reached. Cells were then transiently transfected with 4 μg of the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 containing the BAX cDNA sequence fused to a HA tag sequence (a generous gift of Atan Gross, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel) or with 4 μg of pcDNA3 alone, using the Lipofectamine™ reagent (Invitrogen) and following the protocol described in the product technical sheet. Exactly 46 h after the start of transfection, the medium was removed, and the cells were incubated for 6 h with fresh medium containing EM20-25 at the concentrations indicated in the legend to Fig. 8 or the same volume of Me2SO. Cells were then harvested, sedimented, washed once with ice-cold PBS, resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer, incubated 30 min on ice, and finally Dounce-homogenized. The homogenate was sedimented at full speed in a microcentrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris and nuclei. The supernatant, corresponding to the soluble cellular extract, was transferred to a clean tube and the protein concentration determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Equal protein amounts (450 μg in a final volume of 1 ml) were incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rocker platform with 50 μl of an anti-HA affinity matrix (Roche Applied Science) previously equilibrated with lysis buffer. The matrix was then sedimented at full speed in a microcentrifuge for 10 s and the supernatant (corresponding to the flow-through) carefully removed and stored at –20 °C. The matrix was washed with (i) 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer, (ii) 1 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 500 mm NaCl and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and otherwise identical to the lysis buffer, and (iii) 1 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and otherwise identical to the lysis buffer except that it did not contain NaCl. The matrix was carefully pelleted and the supernatant removed at each wash step. The matrix was finally resuspended in 40 μl of Laemmli gel sample buffer containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 5 min, and pelleted again. The supernatants were transferred to clean tubes and subjected to Western blotting analysis using a mouse anti-human BCL-2 antibody, as described below. The same membrane was then washed, stripped as described below, and probed with a rat monoclonal anti-HA antibody (clone 3F10, Roche Applied Science). Detection of Caspase-9 Cleavage—The flow-through fractions from the anti-HA affinity matrix incubation were precipitated with 4 volumes of ice-cold acetone for 10 min followed by centrifugation at full speed in a microcentrifuge for 15 min at 4 °C. The acetone was carefully removed and the pellets were air-dried at room temperature, resuspended in 40 μl of Laemmli gel sample buffer containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and boiled for 5 min. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed as described below. Both full-length and cleaved caspase-9 were detected by using a rabbit polyclonal anti caspase-9 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Transfection—The human Bcl-2 siRNA sequence was designed as 5′-GCUGCACCUGACGCCCUUCtg-3′, and the corresponding annealed oligonucleotide was purchased from Ambion, Inc. (Austin, TX). A validated, non-targeting siRNA (negative control comprised of a 19-bp scrambled sequence with no significant homology to any known human gene sequences) was also purchased from Ambion, Inc. Transient transfection of siRNA was carried out using Oligofectamine™ reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. One day before transfection with siRNA, HeLa BCL-2 cells were plated on 12-well plates and grown in the appropriate medium supplemented with 10% serum and without antibiotics until a confluence of about 30–50% was reached. Cells were transfected with 100 pmol of Bcl-2 siRNA or 25 pmol of negative control RNA per well in serum-free medium for 4 h and then cultured in the presence of serum (10%) and without antibiotics at 37 °C until they were ready to be assayed for cell viability or Western blotting analysis (40 h after RNA addition). The number of viable cells after RNA addition was assessed based on the Resazurin assay, as described previously. For Western blotting analysis, cells were harvested, sedimented, washed once with ice-cold PBS, resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer, incubated 30 min on ice, and finally Dounce-homogenized. The homogenates were sedimented at full speed in a microcentrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris and nuclei. The supernatants, corresponding to the soluble cellular extracts, were transferred to clean tubes and the protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay. Equal protein amounts (100 μg) were solubilized in Laemmli gel sample buffer containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, separated electrophoretically by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to Western blotting analysis, as described below, using a mouse anti-human BCL-2 antibody. The same membrane was then washed, stripped as described in the following paragraph, and probed with a mouse monoclonal antibody against rabbit skeletal muscle GAPDH (clone 6C5, Chemicon International. Inc.). SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—The proteins from each solubilized sample, obtained as described in the preceding paragraphs, were separated electrophoretically in SDS-polyacrylamide 1.5-mm-thick minigels (12% acrylamide-0.4% bisacrylamide) and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. For immunoblotting analysis, the membrane was blocked in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat milk (blocking buffer) and incubated with the proper antibody for 2 h (anti-BCL-2 and anti-HA antibodies) or overnight (anti-BCL-XL, anti-GAPDH, and anti-caspase-9 antibodies). The membrane was then washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with blocking buffer containing horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse, anti-rat, or anti-rabbit IgG (1:5,000 dilution) for 1 additional hour. After further washing in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, labeled proteins were visualized with an ECL Western blotting detection kit (Bio-Rad). Membrane stripping for sequential blotting was carried out using the Re-Blot Plus Western blot recycling kit (Chemicon International, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Reagents—TMRM was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR); CsA was purchased from Fluka Riedel-de Haen. BH3I-2′ and Chelerythrine were from Calbiochem and Sigma, respectively, while HA14-1 and EM20-25 were supplied from Hoffmann-La Roche (Basel, Switzerland). The antibody against caspase-9 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., and it recognized both the uncleaved and cleaved forms of caspase; the secondary peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were from Southern Biotechnology, and the peroxidase detection kit was from Pierce. All other chemicals and tissue culture reagents were purchased from Sigma and were of the highest available grade. We tested the effects of BH3I-2′, Chelerythrine, and HA14-1 on the respiration of isolated rat liver mitochondria. All compounds displayed a biphasic effect, with uncoupling at lower concentrations and respiratory inhibition as the concentration was raised further (Fig. 1). The most effective was BH3I-2′ (half-maximal activity at about 80 nm, which is equivalent to the uncoupling activity of the most potent protonophore, FCCP). Chelerythrine had an intermediate potency (half-maximal uncoupling at about 2 μm), followed by HA14-1 (half-maximal uncoupling at about 20 μm). We next investigated whether these compounds affect the PTP with a sensitive technique that we introduced in 1993 (19Petronilli V. Cola C. Massari S. Colonna R. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21939-21945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is illustrated for HA14-1 (Fig. 2A). In these protocols mitochondria are first loaded with a small Ca2+pulse that is not sufficient to open the PTP per se. Under these conditions, the addition of a low concentration of FCCP (40 nm in this experiment) was not sufficient to trigger opening of the voltage-dependent PTP because the threshold potential for PTP opening was not reached (Fig. 2, trace a). Yet, increasing concentrations of HA14-1 in the range between 1 and 10 μm caused a marked effect on PTP opening by 40 nm FCCP, which now occurred in increasing fractions of the mitochondria (traces b–f). The effect was due to PTP opening because it was fully inhibited by CsA (trace g). It should be stressed that 10 μm HA14-1 did not depolarize mitochondria nor did it potentiate the depolarizing effects of concentrations of FCCP between 10 and 150 nm (results not shown). Of note, all BCL-2 ligands displayed a prominent PTP-sensitizing effect at concentrations that did not affect mitochondrial respiration (Fig. 2B). To test whether these complex effects of BCL-2 ligands could also be observed in intact cells, we preliminarly studied the pattern of expression of BCL-XL and BCL-2 in three cell lines. Western blot analysis (Fig. 3) revealed that PC3 cells (lane 1) expressed high levels of BCL-XL but no detectable BCL-2, while HeLa Neo (lane 2) and HeLa BCL-2 cells (lane 3) expressed comparable levels of BCL-XL, BCL-2 being expectedly up-regulated in the latter cell type only. We then incubated human prostate cancer PC3 cells with TMRM, which accumulates inside energized mitochondria. Mitochondrial depolarization causes probe release, which can be detected as the decrease of mitochondrial fluorescence with sensitive imaging techniques (20Bernardi P. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Petronilli V. Di Lisa F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 687-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). The experiments of Fig. 4 document that the addition of 10 nm BH3I-2′ (A), 1 μm Chelerythrine (B), or 5 μm HA14-1 (C) caused a fluorescence decrease (A–C, closed symbols) that is consistent with in situ mitochondrial depolarization, as demonstrated by the similar effect elicited by the protonophore FCCP (all panels). As expected of a PTP-dependent event, the TMRM fluorescence decrease elicited by the BCL-2 ligands was effectively prevented by CsA, which desensitizes the PTP (A–C, open symbols). As the concentration was increased to 30 nm BH3I-2′ (A′), 10 μm Chelerythrine (B′), and 30 μm HA14-1 (C′) mitochondrial depolarization was faster (A′–C′, closed symbols) and could no longer be inhibited by CsA (A′–C′, open symbols). We then tested the effects of BCL-2 ligands on the survival of PC3, HeLa Neo, and HeLa BCL-2 cells (Fig. 5). BCL-2-overexpressing cells (open squares in all panels) were significantly protected from the killing effects of staurosporine (A) as compared with Neo-transfected cells (closed squares in all panels). In striking contrast, HeLa BCL-2 cells, as well as PC3 cells, were as sensitive as HeLa Neo cells to the toxic effects of BH3I-2′ (B), Chelerythrine (C), and HA14-1 (D). These results suggest that the cytotoxicity of BCL-2 ligands may be largely independent of expression of BCL-2 and BCL-XL and that it may rather be mediated by the effects of these compounds on respiration. To assess whether the toxic mitochondrial effects were inevitably linked to the BCL-2 binding activity, we screened a series of HA14-1 analogs from the Hoffmann-La Roche chemical library. Fig. 6 reports the structure of one such compound, whose synthesis has been reported in the literature (21Figueroa-Villar J.D. Cruz E.R. Tetrahedron. 1993; 49: 2855-2862Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and which we named EM20-25, together with that of HA14-1. EM20-25 did not cause uncoupling, and it only slightly inhibited uncoupled respiration at concentrations above 30 μm (Fig. 7A), but it did cause sensitization of th"

Rnd2-bound Pragmin significantly stimulates RhoA activity and induces cell contraction through RhoA and the Rho-kinase pathway in HeLa cells. In PC12 cells, expressing Pragmin inhibits nerve growth factor-induced neurite outgrowth in response to Rnd2, and knock-down of Pragmin by Pragmin-specific small interfering RNA enhances neurite elongation. Therefore, Rnd2 regulates neurite outgrowth by functioning as the RhoA activator through Pragmin, in contrast to Rnd1 and Rnd3 inhibiting RhoA signaling.

Activation of the Rho family proteins requires GDP-GTP exchange catalyzed by various guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), 2The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; HA, hemagglutinin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DIG, digoxigenin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DTT, dithiothreitol; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); NGF, nerve growth factor; F-actin, filamentous actin. 2The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; HA, hemagglutinin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DIG, digoxigenin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DTT, dithiothreitol; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); NGF, nerve growth factor; F-actin, filamentous actin. whereas the activation of the GTPases is down-regulated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which stimulate the intrinsic GTPase activities. Presently, at least 20 mammalian Rho family proteins have been identified: Rho (A, B, and C), Rac (1Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A.

Among them, the functions of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 have been extensively characterized, and they induce formations of actin stress fibers, lamellipodia, and filopodia, respectively, in fibroblasts (4Ridley A.J.

In neuronal cells, activation of Rac and Cdc42 induces the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia of the growth cone and stimulation of neurite outgrowth. On the other hand, Rho activation induces the inhibition of neuritogenesis and neurite retraction. These actions of Rho family GTPases are mediated by a variety of downstream effectors (8Mackay D.J.

The Rnd proteins, Rnd1, Rnd2, and Rnd3/RhoE, comprise a unique branch of the Rho family GTPases that lack intrinsic GTPase activity and consequently remain constitutively active (19Nobes C.D. Lauritzen I. Mattei M.G. Paris S. Hall A. Chardin P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Previous studies have suggested that Rnd1 and Rnd3 have antagonistic effects on RhoA-regulated signaling pathways, and several downstream effectors have been identified, such as Socius and p190RhoGAP (20Katoh H.

In contrast to Rnd1 and Rnd3, little is known about Rnd2, although Rnd2 is expressed specifically in neurons in brain (22Nishi M. Takeshima H. Houtani T. Nakagawara K. Noda T. Sugimoto T. Brain Res.

We have recently demonstrated that Vps4-A is a Rnd2-binding protein, involved in endosomal vesicle trafficking (24Tanaka H. Fujita H. Katoh H. Mori K. Negishi M. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, we identified Rapostlin as an effector of Rnd2, inducing neurite branching (25Fujita H. Katoh H. Ishikawa Y. Mori K.

During screening putative Rnd2-binding proteins by a yeast two-hybrid system, we found a novel effector protein of Rnd2, Pragmin. Pragmin specifically binds to Rnd2 among the Rho family GTPases in a GTP-dependent manner. Pragmin with Rnd2 stimulates RhoA activity and inhibits NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. Plasmid Constructions and Antibodies—Wild-type and mutant forms of Rnd2, wild-type Rnd1 and Rnd3, mutant forms of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 were obtained as described previously (14Katoh H. Aoki J. Ichikawa A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2489-2492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 20Katoh H. Harada A. Mori K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell.

For a yeast two-hybrid screening, Rnd2V16S224 (Rnd2V16 lacking a farnesylation site in the COOH-terminal CAAX motif by a substitution of Cys to Ser) was fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain in the yeast expression vector pGBKT7 (Clontech). For purification of recombinant proteins, cDNAs of Rnd1, Rnd2, Rnd3, and Pragmin-CT* (amino acids 947-1368) were subcloned into pGEX-4T-2 (Amersham Biosciences). For expression in mammalian cells, cDNAs of RhoAV14, Rac1V12, Cdc42V12, Rnd1, Rnd2, Rnd2V16, Rnd2N21, and Rnd3 were subcloned into pcDNA3 encoding an initiating Met followed by the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag sequence at the NH2 terminus. The small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for Pragmin were designed to target 19 nucleotides of rat Pragmin (Pragmin siRNA-A, nucleotides 224-242, 5′-CCACCATGATGACTTCTGA-3′; Pragmin siRNA-B, nucleotides 1339-1357, 5′-GCAACCACTATTACTGTTA-3′), and the siRNA for Rapostlin was designed to target 19 nucleotides of rat Rapostlin (nucleotides 132-150, 5′-ACAGCTCAGGAATCTTTCA-3′). They were subcloned into an siRNA expression vector pSilencer (Ambion) to express a 21-nucleotides hairpin siRNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. A pSilencer plasmid encoding a validated nontargeting siRNA supplied by the manufacturer was used as a negative control. Antibodies used were as follows: mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibody 9E10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY); mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody 12CA5 (Roche Applied Science); mouse monoclonal anti-RhoA antibody 26C4, goat polyclonal anti-Rho8 (Rnd3) antibody C-19, and mouse monoclonal anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) antibody B-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin antibody (Sigma); Alexa Fluor 488/594-conjugated secondary antibodies and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR); and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (DAKO). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Rnd1 and Rnd2 have been described previously (25Fujita H. Katoh H. Ishikawa Y. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45428-45434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 29Ishikawa Y. Katoh H. Negishi M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 11065-11072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibody for Pragmin was generated against bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused peptide corresponding to the amino acids 15-297 of Pragmin. The specific antibody was purified by passage over HiTrap NHS-activated HP columns (Amersham Biosciences). Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—A rat brain cDNA library fused to the GAL4 activation domain of the pACT2 vector (Clontech) was screened using Rnd2V16S224/pGBKT7 as bait in the yeast strain AH109 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Interaction between the bait and library proteins activates transcription of the reporter gene HIS3, Ade, and lacZ. From 1.2 × 107 transformants, 318 colonies grew on selective medium, containing 2 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole but lacking histidine and adenine, and 139 colonies were also positive for β-galactosidase activity. Positive clones were sequenced using an ABI PRISM 310 DNA sequencer. One of these, a clone F-53 was found to encode the COOH-terminal 422 amino acids of Pragmin. BLAST search revealed that F-53 is identical to the sequence corresponding to the COOH-terminal region of NCBI reference sequence number XM_224908. To obtain a full-length cDNA, two primers were synthesized: 5′-ATAGAATTCCCATGTCTGCGTGCAGTGACTTTG-3′ (5′ end of a putative coding sequence of XM_224908 with EcoRI) and 5′-TAAGCGGCCGCTCAGAGAAGTTGC-3′ (3′ end of F-53 with NotI). These two primers were used in reverse transcription-PCR with rat brain RNA as a template, and a 4.1-kb PCR fragment was obtained. The PCR product was subcloned into pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced completely. For expression in mammalian cells, cDNAs of full-length Pragmin (amino acids 1-1368), the NH2-terminal half region of Pragmin (Pragmin-NT; amino acids 1-829), and the COOH-terminal half region of Pragmin (Pragmin-CT; amino acids 830-1368) were subcloned into pcDNA3 encoding an initiating Met followed by the Myc epitope tag sequence at the NH2 terminus. The cDNA of full-length Pragmin was also subcloned into pEGFP-C3 (Clontech). Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNAs were isolated using Isogen (Nippongene, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and 30 μg of RNA was used to generate cDNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Roche Applied Science). Reverse transcription was performed with the primers of Pragmin (5′-ATAGAATTCCCATGTCTGCGTGCAGTGACTTTG-3′ and 5′-TTCTGTTGGTCTTGTACATGT-3′) using the generated cDNA as a template. In Situ Hybridization—Antisense and sense riboprobes were prepared by in vitro transcription of the plasmids encoding bp 3741-4107 of rat Pragmin cDNA sequence with T7 and T3 RNA polymerases and digoxigenin (DIG) RNA labeling mix (Roche Applied Science). In situ hybridization was performed as described previously (29Ishikawa Y. Katoh H. Negishi M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 11065-11072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 40-μm-thick coronal sections of postnatal day 27 of rat brains were treated with 1.0 μg/ml proteinase K (Roche Applied Science) for 7 min at room temperature and then acetylated before hybridization. After prehybridization, the sections were incubated with 500 ng/ml DIG-labeled antisense or sense probe overnight at 55 °C and washed with SSC several times. DIG-labeled probes were immunodetected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-DIG antibody (1:2000 dilution; Roche Applied Science) and then reacted with nitro blue tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Roche Applied Science). Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa and 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 4 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.2 mg/ml streptomycin under humidified air containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. PC12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfections were carried out with Superfect (Qiagen) for HeLa cells, Lipofectamine PLUS (Invitrogen) for 293T cells, or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for PC12 cells, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoblotting—Proteins were separated by 10 or 12.5% SDS-PAGE and were electrophoretically transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.). The membrane was blocked with 3% low fat milk in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) and then incubated with primary antibodies. The primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro Binding Assays—All GST-fused proteins were purified from Escherichia coli as described previously (14Katoh H. Aoki J. Ichikawa A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2489-2492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 30Self A.J. Hall A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Recombinant GTPases were loaded with guanine nucleotide as described previously (24Tanaka H. Fujita H. Katoh H. Mori K. Negishi M. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by comparing with bovine serum albumin standards after SDS-PAGE and by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. For pull-down assays, 293T cells transfected with Myc-tagged Pragmin or HA-tagged Rho family GTPases were rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed with the ice-cold cell lysis buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) for Pragmin or the buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) for Rho family GTPases. Cell lysates were then centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatants were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 2 μg of GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. After the beads were washed with the ice-cold cell lysis buffer, the bound proteins were eluted in Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-HA or anti-Myc antibody. A dot-blot assay was performed as described previously (25Fujita H. Katoh H. Ishikawa Y. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45428-45434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, 8μg of GST, GST-fused Pragmin-CT*, Rho-binding domain of Rho-kinase (amino acids 932-1065) (14Katoh H. Aoki J. Ichikawa A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2489-2492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), or COOH-terminal tail of Plexin-B1 (amino acids 1724-1915) (31Oinuma I. Katoh H. Harada A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25671-25677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) was spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane and allowed to dry for 2 h at room temperature. The membrane was blocked with dot-blot buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT) containing 5% low fat milk for 1 h at 4°C. The membrane was then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in the buffer containing 20 μg of GST-fused Rnd proteins preloaded with GTPγS. The membrane was washed with the dot-blot buffer and then incubated with 3% low fat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing anti-Rnd1, Rnd2, or Rnd3 antibody. These antibodies were detected by using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the ECL detection kit. Immunoprecipitation—293T cells cotransfected with Myc-tagged Pragmin and HA-tagged Rnd2 were rinsed once with PBS and lysed with the ice-cold cell lysis buffer A. After centrifugation, the supernatants were incubated with anti-HA monoclonal antibody for 1 h and then with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with the lysis buffer A, and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. For the endogenous protein binding assay, the embryonic day 16 rat brains were homogenized in ice-cold homogenization buffer (0.32 m sucrose, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm benzamidine) with a digital homogenizer (Iuchi, Japan), and the homogenates were lysed with 1% Triton X-100 in the ice-cold homogenization buffer. After centrifugation, the supernatants were incubated with anti-Rnd2 polyclonal antibody for 1 h and then with protein A-Sepharose for 3 h at 4°C. The beads were washed with the homogenization buffer, and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HeLa cells were seeded onto round 13-mm glass coverslips in 24-well plates at a density of 1.5 × 104 cells/well, and cultured for 16 h after transfection. PC12 cells were seeded onto round 13-mm glass coverslips coated with poly-d-lysine at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well. At 5 h after transfection, PC12 cells were differentiated with 50 ng/ml nerve growth factor (NGF; Promega Corp.) in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and further cultured for 43 h. For siRNA-mediated knockdown experiments, PC12 cells were differentiated with 50 ng/ml NGF for 24 h and then transfected in the presence of 50 ng/ml NGF followed by further incubation for 36 h. Cells on coverslips were rinsed with PBS and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. After residual formaldehyde had been quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 10 min, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min and incubated with 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS for 1 h. For detection of Myc epitope, cells were incubated with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody in 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS (1:1000 dilution) for 1 h, followed by incubation with Alexa 488/594-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody in PBS (1:2000 dilution) for 1 h. For detection of Rnd2, cells were incubated with anti-Rnd2 polyclonal antibody in 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS (1 μg/ml) for 1 h, followed by incubation with Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody in PBS (1:2000 dilution) for 1 h. Filamentous actin (F-actin) was stained with Alexa 488-conjugated phalloidin in PBS (1:500 dilution) for 1 h. Cells on coverslips were mounted in 90% glycerol containing 0.1% p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride in PBS and photographed with a Leica DC350F digital camera system equipped with a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope. The images were analyzed with Image-Pro Plus image analysis software. Measurement of RhoA Activity—Measurement of RhoA activity was performed as described previously (32Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 264-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Yamaguchi Y. Katoh H. Yasui H. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18977-18983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Briefly, 16 h after transfection, HeLa cells were washed with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline and lysed for 10 min with cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 30 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) containing 20 μgof GST-fused Rho-binding domain of mouse Rhotekin. The cell lysates were centrifuged for 3 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatants were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads for 50 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed with wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 30 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin), and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Densitometric analyses were performed with NIH Image software, and the amounts of GTP-bound RhoA were normalized to the total amounts of RhoA in cell lysates. Cloning of Pragmin, a Novel Rnd2 Effector, and Its Expression—In an attempt to identify effector proteins of Rnd2, we employed a two-hybrid screening of a rat brain cDNA library with Rnd2V16S224, equivalent to a constitutively active Val-12 mutation in Ras (25Fujita H. Katoh H. Ishikawa Y. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45428-45434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), lacking the COOH-terminal CAAX motif, as bait. Approximately 1.2 × 107 clones were screened, and several positive clones were isolated. Sequence analyses revealed that one of them encoded the COOH-terminal region of a novel protein. A BLAST search to match the isolated fragment revealed that it shows 98% identity to rat NCBI reference sequence clone XM_224908, its function being unknown. We cloned cDNA encoding full-length of this protein (1368 amino acids) and then named it Pragmin (pragma of Rnd2). Pragmin has two serine-rich regions and a kinase-like domain at the COOH terminus (Fig. 1A). The kinase-like domain has substitutions in the highly conserved DFG triplet within the activation segment critical for kinase activity. The other region of Pragmin showed no significant sequence homology to any other known proteins. To examine the tissue distribution of Pragmin, we carried out reverse transcription-PCR. Pragmin mRNA was detected in rat brain, kidney, spleen, small intestine, and colon (Fig. 1B). The expression level of Pragmin mRNA did not change during the development of brain from embryonic day 14 to adult. To reveal the distribution of Pragmin mRNA in the postnatal day 27 of rat brain, we performed in situ hybridization using a DIG-labeled Pragmin antisense riboprobe (Fig. 1C). Expression of Pragmin mRNA was observed in cortical neurons and hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Pragmin mRNA-expressing neurons were also found in the piriform cortex and cerebellum. This expression pattern was similar to that of Rnd2 mRNA (22Nishi M. Takeshima H. Houtani T. Nakagawara K. Noda T. Sugimoto T. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 67: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To determine whether the interaction of Rnd2 with Pragmin is dependent on GTP, full-length Pragmin tagged with Myc was expressed in 293T cells and used in a pull-down assay with GST-fused Rnd2 preloaded with GTPγS or nucleotide-free GST-fused Rnd2. Pragmin interacted with GTPγS-bound Rnd2 but not with nucleotide-free Rnd2 or GST alone (Fig. 2A). To examine whether Pragmin interacts specifically with Rnd2 among the Rho family GTPases, HA-tagged Rnd subfamily GTPases and well characterized Rho family GTPases were expressed and used in a pull-down assay with the GST-fused COOH-terminal region of Pragmin (Pragmin-CT*), a fragment originally isolated from the yeast two-hybrid screening. Both wild-type Rnd2 and Rnd2V16 strongly bound to Pragmin-CT*, whereas Rnd1, Rnd3, constitutively active RhoA (RhoAV14), Rac1 (Rac1V12), and Cdc42 (Cdc42V12) did not, indicating that Rnd2 specifically binds to Pragmin among the Rho family GTPases (Fig. 2B). To examine whether Rnd2 directly binds to Pragmin, we carried out a dot-blot assay. GST-fused Pragmin-CT* was spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and the membrane was overlaid with GTPγS-preloaded Rnd1, Rnd2, or Rnd3. Pragmin directly interacted with Rnd2 but not with Rnd1 or Rnd3, although the RhoA-binding domain of Rho-kinase, a RhoA-specific effector, failed to interact with three Rnd GTPases (Fig. 2C). On the other hand, the COOH-terminal tail of Plexin-B1, which is known to associate with three Rnd GTPases (31Oinuma I. Katoh H. Harada A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25671-25677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), interacted with Rnd1, Rnd2, and Rnd3. The interaction between Rnd2 and Pragmin also occurred in mammalian cells, as observed by an immunoprecipitation study of 293T cells cotransfected with Myc-tagged Pragmin and HA-tagged Rnd2V16 (Fig. 2D). In contrast, Rnd2N21, equivalent to a dominant negative Asn-17 mutation in Ras, did not bind to Pragmin in the cells. Furthermore, we examined the endogenous interaction between Rnd2 and Pragmin in the embryonic day 16 of rat brain, since they were highly expressed in the brain (22Nishi M. Takeshima H. Houtani T. Nakagawara K. Noda T. Sugimoto T. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 67: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Antibody for Pragmin was generated against bacterially expressed the GST-fused NH2-terminal region of Pragmin and was confirmed to recognize Myc-tagged Pragmin specifically (Fig. 2E). Endogenous Pragmin was coimmunoprecipitated with Rnd2 by anti-Rnd2 polyclonal antibody but not by anti-HA antibody used as a negative control (Fig. 2F). Pragmin Induces Cell Contraction through RhoA Activation—To investigate the role of the interaction of Rnd2 with Pragmin, HeLa cells were transfected with Pragmin, Rnd2V16, or both, and morphological changes in transfected cells were analyzed by the fluorescence of F-actin.

These membranes are stable in concentrated 3–5 m NaCl solutions, whereas membranes of non-halophilic Archaea, which do not contain PGP-Me, are unstable and leaky under such conditions. By x-ray diffraction and vesicle permeability measurements, we demonstrate that PGP-Me contributes in an essential way to membrane stability in hypersaline environments.

By contrast, LUV made of polar lipid extracts from moderately halophilic and non-halophilic Archaea (Methanococcus jannaschii, Methanosarcina mazei, Methanobrevibacter smithii) are leaky and aggregate at high salt concentrations. However, adding PGP-Me to M. mazei lipids results in gradual enhancement of LUV stability, correlating with the PGP-Me content. The LUV data are substantiated by the x-ray results, which show that H. halobium and M. mazei lipids have dissimilar phase behavior and form different structures at high NaCl concentrations. H. halobium lipids maintain an expanded lamellar structure with spacing of 8.5–9 nm, which is stable up to at least 100 °C in 2 m NaCl and up to ∼60 °C in 4 m NaCl. However, M. mazei lipids form non-lamellar structures, represented by the Pn3m cubic phase and the inverted hexagonal HII phase. From these data, the forces preventing membrane aggregation in halophilic Archaea appear to be steric repulsion, because of the large head group of PGP-Me, or possibly out-of-plane bilayer undulations, rather than electrostatic repulsion attributed to the doubly charged PGP-Me head group.

Microbial growth occurs over a wide range of salt concentrations spanning the whole range from fresh water environments to NaCl concentrations of 3–5 m (1Oren A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

To survive under conditions of high salinity, halophilic and halotolerant microorganisms have developed specific cell and cell membrane adaptations (5Vreeland R.H. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1987; 14: 311-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Eubacteria and other halotolerant organisms use organic solutes from the surroundings or synthesize compatible osmolytes to balance the high external osmotic pressure (1Oren A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

Extremely halophilic Archaea maintain osmotic balance by accumulating salts through osmoregulation (4Margesin R. Schinner F. Extremophiles. 2001; 5: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) and have adapted their membranes to have low proton and sodium permeability at high salt concentrations (7van de Vossenberg J.L. Driessen A.J. Grant W.D. Konings W.N. Extremophiles. 1999; 3: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The membrane destabilizing effects caused by NaCl may be compensated for by a shift in lipid composition; for example, in Vibrio costicola, by a decrease in non-bilayer-forming phosphatidylethanolamine and a corresponding increase in phosphatidylglycerol (8Sutton G.C.

However, the membrane lipids of the organisms in the different domains differ significantly in structure and composition. Archaeal lipids are characterized by ether linkages and isoprenoid chains, mainly phytanyl and bisphytanediyl, in contrast to the ester linkages and straight fatty acyl chains of non-Archaea (10Kates M.

Noteworthy, archaeal lipids have an sn-2,3 enantiomeric configuration, opposite to the sn-1,2 configuration of the glycerophospholipids from the other domains (10Kates M. Experientia. 1993; 49: 1027-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). With respect to their composition, the membranes of extremely halophilic Archaea have several unique characteristics that vary little within specific genera (14Kamekura M. Kates M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1999; 63: 969-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Phospholipids with ethanolamine, inositol, and serine head groups are generally absent and specific phosphatidylglycerol phospholipids, sometimes including several sulfated glycolipids, predominate. Most notably, extreme halophiles contain a major, ubiquitous phospholipid, archaetidylglycerol 3Archaetidylglycerol denotes archaeal phosphatidylglycerol with ether-linked isoprenoid chains (Fig. 1). 3Archaetidylglycerol denotes archaeal phosphatidylglycerol with ether-linked isoprenoid chains (Fig. 1). methylphosphate (PGP-Me), 4The abbreviations used are: PGP-Me, archaetidylglycerol methylphosphate; PG, phosphatidylglycerol or archaetidylglycerol; PGP, archaetidylglycerol phosphate; PC, phosphatidylcholine; LUV, large unilamellar vesicles; CF, 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein; OG, n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside; FAB-MS, fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. 4The abbreviations used are: PGP-Me, archaetidylglycerol methylphosphate; PG, phosphatidylglycerol or archaetidylglycerol; PGP, archaetidylglycerol phosphate; PC, phosphatidylcholine; LUV, large unilamellar vesicles; CF, 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein; OG, n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside; FAB-MS, fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. which is an archaeal analogue of phosphatidylglycerol methylphosphate (Ref. 15Kates M. Moldoveanu N. Stewart L.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1169: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar and Fig. 1). PGP-Me accounts for 50–80% of the polar membrane lipids of extreme halophiles but is absent and replaced by other lipids in moderate halophiles and non-halophiles (Table 1). For example, in the moderate halophile Methanosarcina mazei, which contains no PGP-Me, the phosphoinositol phospholipids are most abundant (16Sprott G. Dicaire C.J. Patel G.B. Can. J. Microbiol. 1994; 40: 837-843Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The extreme halophiles also contain archaetidylglycerol (PG), and some strains have minor amounts of sulfated PG (10Kates M.

Open table in a new tab Because of its abundance in extreme archaeal halophiles, the diacidic phospholipid PGP-Me can be expected to play a major role in determining the properties of their membranes. It is believed that it contributes to membrane stability in hypersaline environments (10Kates M. Experientia. 1993; 49: 1027-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar); however, it has neither been tested nor is its mechanism understood. To elucidate the role of PGP-Me, we performed a comparative study on the stability of large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) made of polar lipid extracts from several archaeal strains including extreme halophiles, moderate halophiles, and non-halophiles, which strongly differ by PGP-Me content (Table 1). Both measures used (leakage of entrapped carboxyfluorescein (CF) and LUV aggregation) demonstrated that the LUV stability at high salt concentrations correlates with the PGP-Me content of the membranes. These data were substantiated by low angle x-ray diffraction measurements, which showed that the polar lipids from Halobacterium halobium (extreme halophile) and M. mazei (moderate halophile) have dissimilar phase behavior and form different structures at high salt concentrations. H. halobium lipids, typified by a very high PGP-Me content of ∼78% (Table 1), maintained an expanded lamellar structure stable up to least 4 m NaCl in broad temperature ranges about the physiological temperatures, whereas M. mazei lipids, which have no PGP-Me, formed non-lamellar structures, represented by the Pn3m cubic phase and the inverted hexagonal HII phase, at high NaCl concentrations. In this way, both the LUV and the x-ray diffraction data sets consistently demonstrate a critical role of PGP-Me for the bilayer stabilization in hypersaline environments.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESLipid Isolation and Composition—The Archaea used in this study are shown in Table 1. The source of cultures and growth conditions were as reported previously (17Sprott G.D. Meloche M. Richards J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3907-3910Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 18Sprott G.D. Larocque S. Cadotte N. Dicaire C.J. McGee M. Brisson J.R. Biochim. Biophys.

Archaea. 2003; 1: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Lipids were extracted from freeze-thaw cell pastes by the Bligh and Dyer method using methanol/chloroform/water (2:1:0.8, v/v), and total polar lipids were purified from neutral lipids by acetone precipitation and washing (20Sprott G. Dicaire C.J. Fleming L.P. Patel G.B. Cells Mater. 1996; 6: 143-155Google Scholar). The total polar lipid extracts were then analyzed by negative ion fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FAB-MS), and the analysis of ions obtained was consistent with that reported earlier (17Sprott G.D. Meloche M. Richards J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3907-3910Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 18Sprott G.D. Larocque S. Cadotte N. Dicaire C.J. McGee M. Brisson J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1633: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The m/z values from negative ion FAB-MS spectra were compared from batch to batch to confirm that similar proportions of core lipids were present in each lipid mixture extracted from fresh biomass (12Sprott G.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The amounts of PGP-Me and PG in the different organisms are given in Table 1. PGP-Me and PG were estimated from relative signal heights of lipid signals in negative ion FAB-MS spectra of total polar lipids (n = 3). PGP-Me was taken as the composite of signals of m/z 899, 899+sodium and 885. The relatively small 885 signal represents the composite of PGP fragment (loss of Me) of PGP-Me and PG-sulfate present as a minor lipid in Halobacterium species (10Kates M. Experientia. 1993; 49: 1027-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Branched chain 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol, were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.Purification of PGP-Me and PG—Total polar lipids of Haloferax volcanii were separated by thin layer chromatography on Silica gel 60 glass plates using chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (85:22.5:10:4, v/v). PGP-Me and PG lipid bands were detected and recovered as described (18Sprott G.D. Larocque S. Cadotte N. Dicaire C.J. McGee M. Brisson J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1633: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Negative ion FAB-MS established a purity of >98% for both PGP-Me (m/z 899.5) and PG (m/z 805.3).Preparation of LUV—LUV were prepared by extrusion. Lipids dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1) were dried under a stream of nitrogen, and placed under vacuum for 1 h. 4 mg of lipid were hydrated in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 20 mm 5,6-CF and 500 mm NaCl. They were probe-sonicated using Virsonic 60 sonicator for 15 s at 4-watt RMS and frozen at –20 °C overnight. After thawing to room temperature, the suspensions were probe-sonicated for 30 s in two 15-s bursts (4-watt RMS) and extruded through a 0.2-μm polycarbonate filter (20 passes) using an Avanti mini-extruder assembly (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc). LUV were sized by quasi-elastic light scattering using a DynaPro LSR particle size analyzer. Non-entrapped CF was removed by passing the dispersions through Sephadex PD-10 columns (21Mathai J.C. Sprott G.D. Zeidel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27266-27271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar).LUV Permeability—Leakage of CF from LUV was used as a measure of the bilayer integrity. Because entrapped CF is self-quenched, its leakage results in a fluorescence increase recorded using an SLM-Aminco 500C spectrofluorometer. In a typical experiment, 25–40-μl volumes of LUV containing 20 mm CF were dispensed into 2.5 ml of hypertonic solutions of 4 m NaCl. Leakage measurements were also made with LUV dispensed into 4 m KCl, 4 m sorbitol, and 4 m glycerol solutions. The LUV leakage was measured as the CF fluorescence increase over a period of 10 min divided by the maximum possible CF fluorescence. To obtain the maximum CF release, LUV were lysed after the initial 10 min by addition of 0.5% n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside (OG) or by sonication of the sample (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Salt-induced leakage of LUV. Time course of CF leakage from LUV at different NaCl concentrations for the extreme halophile H. halobium (dashed line) and for the moderate halophile M. mazei (solid lines, 0.8, 2.4, 3.2, 4.0 m NaCl).

Aliquots of LUV diluted with phosphate-buffered saline containing various NaCl concentrations were examined by phase contrast microscopy to confirm aggregation. Average diameters were determined with a particle sizer (Nicomp 270) following 30-min incubations at 25 °C after dilution (Table 2).TABLE 2LUV size (nm) and stability with increase of the external NaCl concentrationLipid kind0.16 m NaCl2 m NaCl3 m NaCl4 m NaClH. halobiumaAverage diameter of 188 ± 89 nm following dilution in 5 m NaCl.148 ± 107125 ± 101141 ± 106166 ± 114H. salinarum125 ± 58159 ± 58134 ± 66251 ± 106N. magadii68 ± 39117 ± 6298 ± 56174 ± 81H. volcanii78 ± 5587 ± 64130 ± 68160 ± 88H. minutum77 ± 3996 ± 4996 ± 5182 ± 51H. morrhuae116 ± 55129 ± 67171 ± 73132 ± 75M. mazei122 ± 60—bVesicle aggregation.—bVesicle aggregation.—bVesicle aggregation.M. jannaschii184 ± 150—bVesicle aggregation.—bVesicle aggregation.—bVesicle aggregation.M. smithii234 ± 121—bVesicle aggregation.—bVesicle aggregation.—bVesicle aggregation.T. acidophilum149 ± 113—bVesicle aggregation.—bVesicle aggregation.—bVesicle aggregation.Archaeal PGP-Me80 ± 62126 ± 97NDcND, not determined.116 ± 92Archaeal PG55 ± 34273 ± 195—bVesicle aggregation.—bVesicle aggregation.Diphytanoyl PG158 ± 96682 ± 501—bVesicle aggregation.—bVesicle aggregation.Diphytanoyl PC250 ± 185205 ± 149194 ± 132288 ± 185a Average diameter of 188 ± 89 nm following dilution in 5 m NaCl.b Vesicle aggregation.c ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab X-Ray Sample Preparation and Measurements—Polar lipid extracts from H. halobium and M. mazei dissolved in chloroform were used. Chloroform was removed with a stream of argon, and the lipids were dried under high vacuum for 24 h. Lipid dispersions with 10% (w/v) lipid content were prepared by hydration and vortexing at room temperature, followed by 5 freeze-thaw cycles between dry ice and room temperature, accompanied by vortexing during the thawing steps. The dispersion media used were 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, containing 0, 2, or 4 m NaCl, respectively. The dispersions were stored at 4 °C for ∼1 day and equilibrated at room temperature for several hours prior to the x-ray measurements. The samples were vortexed again and loaded into x-ray capillaries immediately before their measurement. H. halobium samples at all NaCl concentrations and also M. mazei samples at 0 m NaCl remained with time visually completely homogeneous. In contrast, M. mazei samples at 2 and 4 m NaCl tended to segregate spontaneously into lipid-dense portions and lipid-free solution. X-ray patterns were recorded from the lipid-dense portions in the latter two dispersions. Use of a “cold” freeze-thaw procedure for preparation of the dispersions eliminated effects of higher temperatures on their initial structure. In this way, we were able to distinguish between “initial” states of the dispersions that were not heated above room temperature, and their states assumed after heating-cooling temperature scans. Because of beam time limitations, such scans were performed at a relatively fast rate of 10 °C/min. Thus, the phase transition temperatures referred to further in the text may be higher than the equilibrium transition midpoints, which can only be obtained using very low, quasistatic scan rates. This circumstance, however, does not affect in any substantial way the conclusions derived from the x-ray data.Low angle x-ray patterns were recorded at stations 18D, BioCAT and 5IDD, DND-CAT, APS, Argonne, using two-dimensional 2048 × 2048 MAR detectors at a sample-to-detector distance of ∼200 cm. Spacings were determined from axially integrated two-dimensional images using the FIT2D program and silver behenate as calibration standard. A temperature-controlled capillary sample holder was used. All measurements were started at 20 °C, and temperature scans in the range 0–100 °C were performed at a rate of 10 °C/min. The sample holder was mounted on a motorized stage, and by moving it with respect to the incident beam it was possible to ensure that the patterns recorded were representative of the whole sample volumes.RESULTSLUV Properties at High NaCl Concentrations—LUV represent a convenient experimental model frequently used to test the effect of various factors on the membrane stability and integrity. Because our aim was to elucidate the effect of PGP-Me on the membrane stability, we compared the properties of LUV made of polar lipid extracts from extremely halophilic, moderately halophilic, and non-halophilic Archaea, which strongly differ by PGP-Me content. As an important reference point, we also studied the properties of LUV prepared from purified PGP-Me.The procedure applied for LUV preparation resulted in dispersions of stable LUV, which did not release entrapped CF, regardless of their lipid composition. Leakage of CF was observed, however, upon dilution of these dispersions with concentrated NaCl solutions. In a typical experiment, a 25–40-μl volume of the initial LUV dispersion was dispensed into 2.5 ml of concentrated NaCl solution, and the course of CF leakage was monitored by recording the fluorescence increase with time. These measurements revealed large differences among LUV prepared from the polar lipids of different archaeal strains. For example, LUV from the total polar lipids of the extreme halophile H. halobium remain stable and show minimal CF leakage even at the highest 4 m NaCl concentration. In contrast, LUV prepared from the polar lipids of the moderate halophile M. mazei are stable at low NaCl concentrations only and show increasing rates of CF release with increases in the NaCl concentration (Fig. 2). Results of CF release measurements in 4 m NaCl for several archaeal strains are summarized in Fig. 3. Highest LUV stability (lowest CF release) was exhibited by lipids from the extreme halophiles H. halobium and Halobacterium salinarum, which also have the highest PGP-Me content. Polar lipids from moderately halophilic and non-halophilic strains, which have no PGP-Me, display lowest stability (highest CF release). The extreme halophiles H. volcanii and Halobacterium minutum are typified by intermediate CF leakage values, with H. minutum LUV being seemingly more leaky than might be expected based solely on their PGP-Me content. This indicates that other lipids might also contribute to the membrane stabilization/destabilization. Similar to Natronobacterium magadii, H. minutum contains a proportion of PGP-Me with C20-C25 isoprenoid chains in addition to the usual C20-C20 chains. Such asymmetric chains may be expected to impart instability to the bilayers, as N. magadii vesicles of similar phospholipid content have been shown to leak entrapped CF even in isotonic saline (22).FIGURE 3Stability of different Archaea in hypersaline solution. CF leakage from LUV prepared from the polar lipids of different Archaea after 10 min of incubation in 4 m NaCl solutions. The numbers in parentheses show the PGP-Me content as shown in Table 1. Error bars were calculated from 4–10 experiments for each column.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)LUV aggregation was also monitored as another indicator for the salt tolerance of LUV with different lipid compositions (Table 2). In keeping with the CF leakage data, the LUV from extreme halophile lipids exhibited marked resistance to aggregation in the whole NaCl range up to 4 m NaCl, although an increase in their average diameter was seen in most cases. Aggregation was also monitored by phase contrast microscopy, and the increase in LUV size was always associated with aggregation of LUV. We did not attempt to investigate if fusion of LUV was involved. By contrast, LUV from lipids isolated from moderately halophilic and non-halophilic strains were found to aggregate at all tested NaCl concentrations.In view of the observed correlations of the LUV stability with their PGP-Me content, it was of importance to investigate the properties of LUV prepared from purified PGP-Me. These experiments showed that PGP-Me vesicles do not aggregate in concentrated NaCl solutions (Table 2) and also exhibit a relatively low CF leakage of ∼20% (Figs. 4 and 5), comparable to that of LUV made of extreme halophile lipids. Noteworthy, LUV made of archaeal PG were found to aggregate in 2 m NaCl (Table 2), thus suggesting that PGP-Me and PG have completely different effects with regard to their contribution to the membrane stability.FIGURE 4PGP-Me content and LUV stability in hypersaline solution. LUV was prepared by mixing specific percentages of purified PGP-Me and M. mazei polar lipids. CF leakage from LUV was measured after 10 min of incubation in 4 m NaCl solutions. The PGP-Me amounts in the mixtures are given as weight %.

Fig. 4 shows that increasing the proportion of PGP-Me in these mixtures leads to gradual reduction in CF leakage to levels typical for the most stable extreme halophiles H. halobium and H. salinarum. These results clearly demonstrate the ability of PGP-Me to stabilize the lipid membranes in solutions with high NaCl concentrations.To compare the NaCl effect with that of other solutes, measurements of CF leakage from LUV were also made in 4 m solutions of KCl, sorbitol, and glycerol. These data show that NaCl and KCl have similar effects on LUV stability, dependent on the PGP-Me content, whereas sorbitol (Fig. 5) and glycerol (data not shown) cause high CF leakage regardless of the LUV lipid composition.All the above described measurements were performed with LUV in strongly asymmetric environments, up to 4 m external solute concentrations versus internal NaCl concentrations of 0.5 m in the CF leakage and 0.16 m NaCl in the LUV aggregation experiments. To test if these large osmotic gradients caused LUV instabilities, we attempted to prepare vesicles with high internal NaCl concentrations. Whereas H. halobium lipids were found to form"

We have employed hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry to examine the influence of bound ligands on solvent exposure of AChBP. Quantitative measurements of deuterium incorporation are possible for ∼56% of the Lymnaea AChBP sequence, covering primarily the outer surface of AChBP. In the apoprotein, two regions flanking the ligand occupation site at the subunit interface, loop C (residues 175-193) and loop F (residues 164-171), show greater extents of solvent exchange than other regions of the protein including the N- and C-terminal regions. Occupation by nicotinic agonists, epibatidine and lobeline, and nicotinic antagonists, methyllycaconitine, α-bungarotoxin, and α-cobratoxin, markedly restricts the exchange of loop C amide protons, influencing both the rates and degrees of exchange. Solvent exposure of loop C and its protection by ligand suggest that in the apoprotein, loop C exhibits rapid fluctuations in an open conformation. Bound agonists restrict solvent exposure through loop closure, whereas the larger antagonists restrict solvent exposure largely through occlusion of solvent. Loop F, found on the complementary subunit surface at the interface, also reveals ligand selective changes in amide proton exchange rates.

Receptors to neurotransmitters, hormones, and various autacoids possess both recognition and signal transduction capabilities to confer signaling responses in the organism. Identifying the precise structural determinants governing selectivity and the conformational changes attendant to ligand binding in many cases has been hampered by limitations in structural characterization of integral membrane protein receptors at an atomic level of resolution. In the case of the pentameric ligand-gated ion channels, the discovery and crystallographic structural resolution of a soluble acetylcholine-binding protein (AChBP) 2The abbreviations used are: AChBP, acetylcholine-binding protein; nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; Bgtx, α-bungarotoxin; Cbtx, α-cobratoxin; MLA, methyllycaconitine; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; PDB, Protein Data Bank. from snails that resembles the extracellular domain of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) have provided a critical template for analyzing the structure and conformation of the superfamily of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (1Brejc K. van Dijk W.J.

Finally, the functionality of a chimera in which a slightly modified AChBP was attached to the transmembrane spans of a related Cys loop receptor established that AChBP could serve as both a structural and functional surrogate of the ligand-gated ion channels (11Bouzat C.

Analysis of structure by mass spectrometry should prove to be an important addition to current structural analysis. Monitoring amide bond hydrogen exchange enabled us to examine solvent exposure of the apoprotein and compare that with the many complexes that can form with the natural neurotransmitter acetylcholine, its congeners, the alkaloid agonists and antagonists, and the several peptide toxins that associate with this protein. Mass spectrometry enabled us to identify individual peptides in the subunit and therein ascertain by molecular mass the extent of exchange occurring with a D2O solvent over a particular time interval. We examined here the amide proton exchange behavior of AChBP and found that a peptide encompassing loop C shows rapid exchange in the apoform with 13 of 17 amides rapidly incorporating deuterium. Upon ligand binding, 6 of 13 exchanging amide protons were occluded from the solvent. The extent of protection and exchange rates were analyzed in terms of immobilization of loop C through capping of the small agonists and partial occlusion and/or immobilization of the loop by antagonists. Similarly, loop F, found on the complementary subunit interface, also revealed ligand-selective changes in solvent exposure. Materials—(+)-Epibatidine, α-bungarotoxin (Bgtx), and α-cobratoxin (Cbtx) were purchased from Sigma. Methyllycaconitine citrate and α-lobeline were purchased from Tocris (Ellisville, MO). Deuterium oxide (D2O; 99.9% deuterium) was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Cambridge, MA). Pepsin immobilized on 6% agarose was obtained from Pierce. α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Aldrich) was recrystallized once from ethanol. All other materials were of the highest grade commercially available. Expression and Purification of AChBP—AChBP from Lymnaea stagnalis was expressed and purified as described previously (6Hansen S.B. Radic Z. Talley T.T. Molles B.E. Deerinck T. Tsigelny I. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41299-41302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, N-terminal FLAG-tagged AChBP was expressed in HEK 293 cells deficient in the glycosylation processing enzyme, N-acetylglucosylamine transferase I (GNT- cells) (15Reeves P.J. Callewaert N. Contreras R. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13419-13424Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Soluble AChBP secreted from media of the stable cell lines was purified by a FLAG antibody column followed by elution with 3× FLAG peptide in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.6). The eluate was concentrated to a stock solution containing ∼260 μm AChBP in binding sites prior to deuterium exchange. Deuterium Exchange and Mass Spectrometry—All exchange mixtures for AChBP contained 20-26 μm protein, 15 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm NaCl, with a final pH of 7.6, and 80% D2O. Formation of the five AChBP complexes used a 1:1.2-fold molar excess of ligand and a 5-min incubation. Deuterium exchange was initiated when the concentrated AChBP stock was diluted 10-fold into deuterated buffer. After intervals of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 min, the deuterium exchange reaction was quenched by a 10-fold dilution into a prechilled vial (0 °C) containing a quench buffer composed of 2% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O, making the final solution ∼0.04% trifluoroacetic acid, pH 2.2. The quenched protein was then mixed with 50 μl of pepsin bead slurry (previously incubated on ice) with occasional mixing for 5 min, centrifuged for 15 s at 12,000 × g at 4 °C, divided in aliquots, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at -80 °C until analyzed. Samples were individually analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry immediately after thawing to minimize off-exchange as described previously (16Mandell J.G. Falick A.M. Komives E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14705-14710Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 17Mandell J.G. Falick A.M. Komives E.A. Anal Chem. 1998; 70: 3987-3995Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Samples were mixed with cold matrix, spotted on a prechilled MALDI target plate, and dried under vacuum. The back exchange that occurred during the analysis was determined by carrying out control experiments in which each of the protein samples was deuterated for 24 h at 25 °C. To determine the number of deuterons incorporated in each peptide, mass spectra were quantified by subtracting the centroid of the undeuterated control from the centroid of the isotopic peak cluster for the deuterated sample. All values reported represent only the deuterons exchanged onto the backbone amide-hydrogen positions. The residual deuterium content that incorporated into rapidly exchanging side chain positions was subtracted as described previously (18Hughes C.A. Mandell J.G. Anand G.S. Stock A.M. Komives E.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 967-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Finally, corrections were applied to account for the exchange condition of 80% D2O and back exchange of 21% (18Hughes C.A. Mandell J.G. Anand G.S. Stock A.M. Komives E.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 967-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Kinetic plots of deuteration were typically fit to a double exponential model accounting for deuterons exchanging at a rapid rate (mainly solvent-accessible amides) and those hindered through hydrogen bonding and solvent occlusion. The fit was implemented in Prism 4.0 (San Diego, CA). Peptides produced by pepsin cleavage of AChBP were identified by a combination of sequence searching for accurate masses and MS/MS sequencing by MALDI QqTOF mass spectrometer. Amide hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange was designed to probe solvent accessibility of regions of AChBP and changes in solvent accessibility upon agonist and antagonist binding. To localize the observed changes, after incubation in buffer with or without ligand, AChBP was cleaved with pepsin under low pH quench conditions. Low pH substantially reduces amide exchange rates allowing us to measure prior exchange events at physiological pH. A total of 14 peptides from AChBP were analyzed from each MALDI mass spectrum (Fig. 1). The complete set of mapped (underlined) and unmapped regions is shown under the sequence of AChBP in Fig. 1. Incubation of AChBP with deuterium buffer led to an increase in mass for the envelopes associated with each identifiable peptide fragment (cf.Fig.4A). Because deuterium labeling occurs when the protein is in its native state, the amount of deuteration reflects the solvent accessibility of a certain protein region. The rate and extent of the time-dependent incorporation of deuterium was quantified and plotted. Table 1 shows the analyzed data reported as the average number of deuterons incorporated after 10 min for three independent determinations.TABLE 1Summary of hydrogen/deuterium exchange data for AchBPRegion of AChBPMH+Number of amidesFree AChBPEpibatidine-boundMLA-boundBungarotoxin-boundLoop FPhe165—Phe171934.4463.66 ± 0.063.63 ± 0.133.60 ± 0.103.82 ± 0.03Tyr164—Phe1711097.5074.81 ± 0.014.84 ± 0.094.46 ± 0.095.00 ± 0.06β5′Ala103—Leu1121044.5790.20 ± 0.020.17 ± 0.010.25 ± 0.050.15 ± 0.04β2Trp53—Thr621308.6092.44 ± 0.082.54 ± 0.012.63 ± 0.072.50 ± 0.01Loop ATyr89—Leu1021572.85112.62 ± 0.082.53 ± 0.062.54 ± 0.052.53 ± 0.06C-terminal tailArg202—Leu2101086.6783.55 ± 0.153.38 ± 0.133.70 ± 0.053.41 ± 0.24Phe201—Leu2101233.7594.12 ± 0.204.16 ± 0.144.30 ± 0.144.05 ± 0.10Asn200—Leu2101347.78104.15 ± 0.194.10 ± 0.034.23 ± 0.064.05 ± 0.10Val197—Leu2101646.97124.51 ± 0.244.38 ± 0.064.62 ± 0.224.46 ± 0.08N-terminal helixAsp-8—Leu71809.85148.43 ± 0.288.59 ± 0.258.79 ± 0.278.58 ± 0.13Asn-8—Tyr81972.91159.55 ± 0.039.43 ± 0.109.70 ± 0.109.55 ± 0.24Loop CAsp175—Glu1932162.881712.5 ± 0.297.54 ± 0.127.64 ± 0.144.53 ± 0.05α1-β1 loopTyr8—Ala282482.31179.62 ± 0.179.53 ± 0.019.93 ± 0.209.59 ± 0.09Tyr8—Ser302668.431911.18 ± 0.2311.22 ± 0.1511.01 ± 0.2311.06 ± 0.19 Open table in a new tab Amide Exchange Dynamics for ApoAChBP—The 14 peptides analyzed, covering 56% of the total sequence, showed great differences in their exchange capacities over a 10-min interval. The crystal structure of AChBP shows a homopentameric structure with the five AChBP monomers surrounding a central channel. Apart from an N-terminal helix, β structure forms much of the channel lining and outer surface of the pentamer. In the apoprotein, two regions flanking the ligand binding site at the subunit interface (loop C, Asp175-Glu193 and loop F, Tyr164-Phe171) exchange rapidly with the solvent (Fig. 2, Table 1). The loop C peptide is highly deuterated, with 13 of 17 (∼75%) possible amide protons deuterated even after a short deuteration period of 2 min. Two peptides, covering the tip of loop F, which is situated on the complementary subunit face of AChBP active site, were also highly deuterated. By contrast, the α1-β1 loop and the N- and C-terminal peptides have intermediate solvent accessibility; roughly 40-60% of amides were exchanged (Table 1). It should be noted that the mapped C-terminal peptide included the C-terminal residues 206-210, for which electron density was not observed in the crystal structures. The most solvent-excluded region of apoprotein lies in the β-hairpin and β-strands of the extended β-sandwich. β2 (Trp53-Thr62) has two exchangeable amides of nine, and loop A (Tyr89-Leu102) region has 2 of 12 exchangeable protons. The more C-terminal portion of β5′ (Ala103-Leu112) was virtually devoid of exchange after 10 min. Ligand Binding Markedly Reduces Amide Exchange in Loop C—We examined here the amide proton exchange behavior of AChBP when associated with two nicotinic agonists, (+)-epibatidine and lobeline, and three nicotinic antagonists, the alkaloid methyllycaconitine (MLA) and the peptidic toxins Bgtx and Cbtx (Fig. 3). Occupation by epibatidine resulted in reduced exchange of 6 of the 13 rapidly exchanging amide backbone hydrogens in loop C (Fig. 4, Table 1). The crystal structure of AChBP-epibatidine revealed close proximity (≤4 Å) for backbone residues of four loop C residues (Tyr183, Cys187, Cys188, Tyr192) with epibatidine. Therefore, solvent protection by epibatidine shows that loop C undergoes a loss of solvent accessibility and dynamics upon agonist binding. Similar results were obtained for the large agonist (lobeline) and the alkaloid antagonist (MLA) when bound to AChBP (Table 1, Fig. 5).FIGURE 5Kinetics of deuterium incorporation into several peptide fragments in the apoprotein (black) and the epibatidine (green)- and MLA (orange)-bound forms of AChBP. The total number of incorporated deuterons is plotted against time (minutes) for the following peptide fragments: Asp-8-Leu7 (N-terminal helix), Trp53-Thr62 (β2), Tyr89-Leu102 (loop A), Ala103-Leu112 (β5), Tyr164-Phe171 (loop F), Asp175-Glu193 (loop C), and Val197-Leu210 (C terminus). Conditions are the same as in Fig. 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the case of the larger peptidic α-neurotoxin antagonists Bgtx and Cbtx, a greater number of amide hydrogens are protected. This is particularly manifest at short time periods (Fig. 6A). The higher affinity complex of AChBP with Bgtx approximates monophasic deuteration kinetics. By contrast, Cbtx produces a biphasic deuteration kinetic profile and a smaller degree of solvent protection after 10 min. This suggests that modes of interaction or the interfacial area between toxin-receptor complex differs slightly, even though both Bgtx and Cbtx are members of the long three-fingered α-neurotoxins. Fig. 3B compares the amino acid residues on the toxin shown in the crystal structure (10Bourne Y. Talley T.T. Hansen S.B. Taylor P. Marchot P. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1512-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) to be in contact with the AChBP subunit interface. Interestingly, HEPES buffer, used in the initial crystallizations of AChBP (1Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar), also results in solvent protection of loop C (Fig. 6B). Previous calorimetry studies show that the presence of HEPES lowers the apparent affinity of AChBP-nicotine interaction 6-fold, whereas another buffer, Tris-HCl at pH 7.0, had no effect (9Celie P.H. van Rossum-Fikkert S.E. van Dijk W.J. Brejc K. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Neuron. 2004; 41: 907-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). When we compare H/D exchange of AChBP in the presence of Tris and HEPES buffer at an equivalent pH value (7.0), we find HEPES protects the loop C amide hydrogens, suggesting that HEPES occupation of the agonist-antagonist site in solution. This observation is consistent with the presence of HEPES in the binding site in the crystallized binding protein (1Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar, 2Sixma T.K. Smit A.B. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2003; 32: 311-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Antagonist Binding Alters Solvent Accessibility of Loop F—No significant differences in deuteration of loop F were observed when the agonists epibatidine and lobeline were bound (Fig. 7). By contrast, occupation of the antagonist MLA resulted in reduced exchange of loop F (Tyr164-Phe171) especially at short deuteration periods up to 2 min (Fig. 7, Table 1). The crystal structure of the MLA·AChBP complex shows close proximity of MLA with Tyr164 in loop F (4Hansen S.B. Sulzenbacher G. Huxford T. Marchot P. Taylor P. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3635-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Thus, MLA appears to lock the flexible loop F in place and reduce the dynamics of amide proton exchange. In the presence of the large, three-fingered peptide antagonists Bgtx and Cbtx, in contrast to the other ligands, enhanced exchange of loop F was observed at short exchange times (Fig. 7). Accordingly, α-neurotoxins enhance solvent accessibility to this region. Most of the increase in the rate of deuteration for the neurotoxin complexes is lost with a shorter overlapping peptide fragment of the loop F, residues 165-171. Therefore, the increase in deuteration can be localized largely to the amide proton of Phe165, the most N-terminal amide in the Tyr164-Phe171 peptide. The crystal structure of Cbtx-bound Lymnaea AChBP shows the Thr155-Tyr164 segment of loop F to be more exposed toward solvent with a root-mean-square deviation of up to 3.5 Å for Glu163 (10Bourne Y. Talley T.T. Hansen S.B. Taylor P. Marchot P. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1512-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The enhanced exposure of the amide protons may reflect the C-terminal portion of this segment extending in a radial direction. Residues Tyr89-Leu102 Show Decreased Solvent Accessibility upon Ligand Binding—Because only 2 of 14 analyzed peptides show changes in exchange kinetics upon ligand binding during the 10-min deuteration interval (Fig. 5), we extended the time course of the deuteration exchange from 10 min to 25 h. Even after 25 h, the residues protected by epibatidine in loop C remain resistant to exchange, appearing to be highly sheltered from solvent (data not shown). By contrast, differences in exchange with bound antagonists observed for loop F disappeared after extended exchange periods. Furthermore, residues 89-102 (loop A), a region highly protected from solvent in the apoform, showed decreased solvent accessibility upon epibatidine binding only at long deuteration periods extending to 25 h (Fig. 8). The crystal structure shows the 89-102 loop to line the bottom of the binding site pocket and internal vestibule. The enhanced solvent protection indicates that enclosure of loop C around the agonist in the binding site pocket has a slight influence on solvent exposure to the hydrogen-bonding network on the neighboring subunit (see Fig. 9).FIGURE 9Positions of bound ligands and their influence on AChBP exchange. The top panels show the crystal structures oriented to exhibit the AChBP subunit interface in epibatidine with Aplysia AChBP (PDB accession code 2BYQ) (A), MLA with Aplysia AChBP (PDB accession code 2BYR) (B), and Cbtx with Lymnaea AChBP (PDB accession code 1YI5) (C) complexes. The main chains from the + and - faces of the subunit interface are in gray and gold, respectively. Side chains in close proximity (within 4 Å) with ligand are labeled. Aplysia AChBP residues shown in A and B correspond to their homologous residues in Lymnaea AChBP as follows: Tyr93: Tyr89 (loop A); Ser167: Tyr164 (loop F); Gln186: Val183; Tyr188: Tyr185; Cys190: Cys187; Cys191: Cys188; Tyr195: Tyr192. Loop C (Asp175-Glu193) is highlighted in blue, and loop F (Tyr164-Phe171) is highlighted in yellow, blue, and red depending on the complex. Note here that loop C caps the ligand binding site in the presence of agonist and is extended radially in the presence of antagonist. The bottom panels show changes in the H/D exchange probes for the same ligands bound to AChBP mapped onto an AChBP subunit interface. Sequences in dark blue show greater protection in the presence of the respective ligand. Sequences in yellow are not protected by the ligands. Sequence shown in red (loop F) shows an increase exchange in the presence of the respective ligand. The crystal structure of lobeline with Aplysia AChBP (PDB code 2BYS) is shown in supplemental Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Solvent Exposure and Solution Conformation Assessed by H/D Exchange—Amide H/D exchange with mass spectrometry, applied to full-length AChBP in the apo-, agonist, and antagonist bound states, provides a perspective on solution dynamics of AChBP and the conformational differences associated with ligand binding. The technique, employing differences in peptide mass with differential exposures to H2O and D2O, allowed us to analyze the native, unmodified structure in various aqueous buffers replicating physiologic conditions. Studies in solution circumvent limitations that constrain the protein in the solid state or may be specifically induced by crystal packing or the position of the symmetry-related molecule in crystal structures. H/D exchange coupled with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) has been applied to the study of lipid vesicle-reconstituted nicotinic receptors, demonstrating that lipid composition affects exchange rates (19Methot N. Baenziger J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14815-14822Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Through the use of FTIR, overall exchange in α-helical and β-sheet regions can be distinguished, but the mass spectrometry approach (20Zhang Z. Smith D.L. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 522-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar) allows identification of exchange on particular peptides in the structure. In this initial H/D exchange study, we were able to identify peptides that covered about 56% of the sequence. The structure of pentameric AChBP can be divided into an outer and inner shell; and fortunately, following digestion, the outer shell, to which agonists have access, yields about 75% of the peptides detectable in the mass spectrometry stream. Additional approaches, by modifying pepsin digestion conditions with low concentrations of denaturants or analyzing orthologous AChBPs from Aplysia or Bulinus, may provide the means to enhance coverage in this family of AChBPs. In the apoform, two segments (Tyr164-Phe171, loop F, and Asp175-Glu193, loop C) flanking the Lymnaea AChBP ligand binding site were highly deuterated even at the shortest exchange time, suggesting that these two loop regions are well exposed to solvent and dynamic. In fact, these two loops appear to be at least as solvent-accessible as the N- and C-terminal residues for which electron density is not visible in the crystal structure. The loop lining the channel opening, loop A (Tyr89-Leu102) showed a much slower exchange, reflecting a more ordered structure at the channel lining. The slow exchange may also indicate that H2O molecules in the channel opening are more structured. Distinctive Changes in Loop C Behavior Associated with Agonist and Antagonists—Recent crystallographic studies have revealed distinctive loop C conformations between the agonists and antagonists thus far studied (4Hansen S.B.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1512-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Agonists such as nicotine and carbamoylcholine (9Celie P.H. van Rossum-Fikkert S.E. van Dijk W.J. Brejc K. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Neuron. 2004; 41: 907-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar), as well as the more selective agonists epibatidine and lobeline (4Hansen S.B. Sulzenbacher G. Huxford T. Marchot P. Taylor P. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3635-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), all reveal a closure or capping of the loop C around the ligand. Requirements for this capping might well arise from the small size of many agonists as well as their flexibility in terms of the torsional movements of their respective ring systems. By contrast, complexes with the alkaloid antagonist, methyllycaconitine, and the peptidic α-conotoxins and α-cobratoxin reveal an extended loop C. In the case of methyllycaconitine, the distance between the loop C and core backbone is 7 Å; for α-cobratoxin it is 10 Å and for α-conotoxin IM1, 12 Å (4Hansen S.B. Sulzenbacher G. Huxford T. Marchot P. Taylor P. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3635-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 10Bourne Y. Talley T.T. Hansen S.B. Taylor P. Marchot P. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1512-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The distinction between an extended or closed loop C being associated with antagonist and closed loop C association with agonist was originally noted by Karlin (21Karlin A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1969; 54: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), who found that bromoacetylcholine and m-maleimidobenzyl trimethylammonium when conjugated to the reduced vicinal disulfides, now known to reside on loop C, behaved as agonist and antagonist, respectively, on the intact receptor. The distance between the point of the sulfhydryl-reactive electrophiles and the quaternary ammonium is 9 Å for bromoacetylcholine and 13 Å for m-maleimidobenzyl trimethylammonium. In the case of agonist binding, the loop closure seen in the crystal structures likely restricts solvent access and exchange rates. Not only will surface occlusion by agonist itself exclude solvent interactions, but also amide bond associations between the interacting surfaces of loop C and the subunit core should diminish exchange. A comparison of the four agonist complexes available from the crystal structure (4Hansen S.B. Sulzenbacher G. Huxford T. Marchot P. Taylor P. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3635-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 9Celie P.H. van Rossum-Fikkert S.E. van Dijk W.J. Brejc K. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Neuron. 2004; 41: 907-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) suggests that their limited spatial dimensions and inherent torsional motion and flexibility should enable them to fit behind a completely closed loop C. Accordingly, both envelopment of the agonist and interactions between loop C and the backstop β structure behind the loop account for this lack of exchange of six additional hydrogens. We estimate that four loop C residues (Tyr185, Cys187, Cys188,Tyr192) are in van der Waals contact with the epibatidine agonist itself (4Hansen S.B. Sulzenbacher G. Huxford T. Marchot P. Taylor P. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3635-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). An equivalent reduction in exchangeable amide hydrogens for the MLA antagonist suggests that antagonists may also lock loop C in a more restricted position. Simple extension of loop C may serve to increase exposure of residues not in immediate proximity to the antagonist molecule, but this would be compensated for by occlusion of residue surfaces around loop C by the larger antagonist. Thus, although epibatidine and methyllycaconitine show virtually identical protection of loop C amide hydrogens, the bulk of the smaller epibatidine structure lies on the apical side of loop C, whereas the bulk of the MLA structure is on the membrane side (4Hansen S.B. Sulzenbacher G. Huxford T. Marchot P. Taylor P. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3635-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Also, epibatidine affects closure of loop C to envelop the ligand, whereas MLA binds with the loop C in a more open conformation. Hence, restrictions in H/D exchange likely result from the associated ligand locking an apostructure with a flexible loop C into a more rigid conformation in the bound state. A similar situation likely arises with the bound Cbtx and Bgtx, where loop I and II of the toxin fingers cover portions of an extended loop C residues (Ser182-Tyr192). Although both toxins are members of the long α-neurotoxin family, which contain an additional disulfide in the central loop (Loop II), sequence differences of certain residues (Fig. 3B) between the two toxins produce different rates and extents of solvent protection (Fig. 6). Although a Bgtx·AChBP crystal structure is not yet available for direct comparisons of the contacting residues, a difference in the tertiary structure of the two toxins (Fig. 3A) suggests different interaction points for the flexible fingers on the α-toxin (22Hibbs R.E. Johnson D.A. Shi J. Hansen S.B. Taylor P. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 16602-16611Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The capacity of HEPES buffer at 50 mm to limit amide hydrogen exchange in loop C is consistent with the crystal structure showing that HEPES within the binding pocket is largely superimposed within the agonist-occupied volume capped by loop C (1Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). Crystallization conditions using other buffer conditions and polyethylene glycol have shown a more open C-loop extending some 7 Å from the core structure (Ref. 4Hansen S.B. Sulzenbacher G. Huxford T. Marchot P. Taylor P. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3635-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar and Fig. 9). Such a structure would allow for solvent exposure on the outer and inner surfaces of the C-loop. Loop C in the absence of ligand may well exhibit rapid fluctuations in position as predicted from molecular dynamics (13Gao F. Bren N. Burghardt T.P. Hansen S. Henchman R.H. Taylor P. McCammon J.A. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8443-8451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 14Henchman R.H. Wang H.L. Sine S.M. Taylor P. McCammon J.A. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 2564-2576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Hence, AChBP exchange dynamics are consistent with a more open solvent-exposed loop C as seen in the absence of HEPES (4Hansen S.B. Sulzenbacher G. Huxford T. Marchot P. Taylor P. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3635-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Ligand-induced Changes in Loop F Exchange—Residues in loop F are also proximal to the binding site, but they arise from the complementary subunit interface. The loop F region shows substantial variability in sequence among the different subunits of the nAChR. This is also a region where sequence insertions are evident when subunits presenting a binding face are compared. For example, in the muscle nAChR subunits, γ, δ, and ϵ show a sequence insertion in that region (3Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 967-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar). Hence, the loop F region contains important residues that dictate selectivity for the binding site when this region of γ, δ, ϵ is paired with the principal face of α subunits (23Sine S.M. Kreienkamp H.J. Bren N. Maeda R. Taylor P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 205-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Thus, it is not surprising that this region exhibits considerable flexibility in solution. Because the surface for all agonist binding lies apical to loop C and hence distal to loop F, a lack of influence of agonist binding on exchange parameters of loop F might be anticipated. Interestingly, the large α-neurotoxins, despite the bulk of their structure residing on the membrane side of the loop (10Bourne Y. Talley T.T. Hansen S.B. Taylor P. Marchot P. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1512-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), increase exchange in this region. A suggestion of α-neurotoxins altering loop F position is evident in the recent crystal structure (10Bourne Y. Talley T.T. Hansen S.B. Taylor P. Marchot P. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1512-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) where the 155-164 segment of the subunit becomes exposed. By contrast, the succinamidyl moiety of methyllycaconitine appears to cover and perhaps immobilize a portion of the loop F region (Fig. 9). The binding surface of methyllycaconitine is unique among the alkaloid ligands studied to date in that much of its binding surface lies on the membrane side of loop C. Outside of the differences in conformation of loops C and F, to date the H/D exchange data strongly suggest minimal conformational changes in other regions of the molecule, particularly those loops in the receptor that would be positioned near the membrane surface. In the crystal structures (4Hansen S.B. Sulzenbacher G. Huxford T. Marchot P. Taylor P. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3635-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 8Celie P.H. Kasheverov I.E. Mordvintsev D.Y. Hogg R.C. van Nierop P. van Elk R. van Rossum-Fikkert S.E. Zhmak M.N. Bertrand D. Tsetlin V. Sixma T.K. Smit A.B. Nat. Struct. Mol Biol. 2005; 12: 582-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), only small differences in conformation are seen in the Cys loop and other regions that appear to interact with the M2-M3 loop region in the transmembrane span (11Bouzat C. Gumilar F. Spitzmaul G. Wang H.L. Rayes D. Hansen S.B. Taylor P. Sine S.M. Nature. 2004; 430: 896-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). This might arise from the sequence truncation in AChBP leaving its C-terminal end limp as a flexible end. Indeed, a comparison of the C-terminal peptides 197-210 and 201-210 shows an equal degree of exchange, suggesting that exchange is accentuated in the most C-terminal position of these peptides. This initial study of AChBP by H/D exchange shows that two loops (C and F) serve as flexible flaps controlling access of active site to ligands. H/D exchange with mass spectrometry reveals conformational states of AChBP not evident in a static crystal structure and thereby provides a novel insight into the solution dynamics of AChBP.

Although both SQR and QFR can catalyze the interconversion of fumarate and succinate, QFR is a much better fumarate reductase, and SQR is a better succinate oxidase. An exception to the conservation of amino acids near the dicarboxylate binding sites of the two enzymes is that there is a Glu (FrdA Glu-49) near the covalently bound FAD cofactor in most QFRs, which is replaced with a Gln (SdhA Gln-50) in SQRs. The role of the amino acid side chain in enzymes with Glu/Gln/Ala substitutions at FrdA Glu-49 and SdhA Gln-50 has been investigated in this study. The data demonstrate that the mutant enzymes with Ala substitutions in either QFR or SQR remain functionally similar to their wild type counterparts. There were, however, dramatic changes in the catalytic properties when Glu and Gln were exchanged for each other in QFR and SQR. The data show that QFR and SQR enzymes are more efficient succinate oxidases when Gln is in the target position and a better fumarate reductase when Glu is present. Overall, structural and catalytic analyses of the FrdA E49Q and SdhA Q50E mutants suggest that coulombic effects and the electronic state of the FAD are critical in dictating the preferred directionality of the succinate/fumarate interconversions catalyzed by the complex II superfamily.

Succinate dehydrogenase is part of the aerobic respiratory chain and citric acid cycle of most organisms, whereas fumarate reductase is found in anaerobic or facultative bacteria and lower eukaryotes that live a portion of their life cycle in a reduced oxygen environment (1Van Hellmond J.J. van der Klei A. van Weelden S.W.H. Tielens A.G.M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2003; 358: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Based upon amino acid sequence analysis, biochemical studies, and their overall structures, it has been proposed that both enzymes arose from a common evolutionary ancestor (2Gest H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1980; 7: 73-77Crossref Google Scholar, 3Wood D. Darlinson M.G. Wilde R.J. Guest J.R. Biochem. J. 1984; 222: 519-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 4Hägerhäll C. Biochim. Biophys.

Succinate dehydrogenase and fumarate reductase from Escherichia coli are composed of four nonidentical subunits organized into two domains. A membrane-extrinsic domain comprises two polypeptide chains: a 64-66-kDa flavoprotein subunit, containing a covalently bound FAD cofactor and the substrate binding site, and a 27-kDa iron-sulfur subunit containing three iron-sulfur clusters([2Fe-2S]2+,1+, [4Fe-4S]2+,1+, and [3Fe-4S]1+,0). The membrane-extrinsic domain is bound to the membrane through interactions with the hydrophobic subunits of the complex. These subunits comprise two membrane anchor polypeptides, each containing three transmembrane helices and providing a binding site(s) for quinone (for reviews, see Refs. 5Lancaster C.R.D. Simon J.

Comparison of the structures of complex II is possible due to the availability of x-ray crystallographic structures for both SQR and QFR of E. coli (9Iverson T.M. Luna-Chavez C. Cecchini G. Rees D.C.

The sequence similarity within the SQR/QFR superfamily is reflected in structural alignments of members whose structures are known (17Schröder I. Gunsalus R.P. Ackrell B.A.C. Cochran B. Cecchini G.

QFRs and SQRs all contain covalently bound FAD and are bidirectional (i.e. they will catalyze both succinate oxidation and fumarate reduction). There are, however, significant differences for the kinetics of fumarate reduction by fumarate reductase and succinate dehydrogenase. In addition to conventional steady-state solution kinetics, these differences have been measured by electro-chemical experiments (protein film voltammetry) in which the enzymes exhibit high electrocatalytic activity when adsorbed on a graphite electrode. In these studies, SQR is proficient at reducing fumarate above an electrode potential of approximately -60 mV (pH 7.0), whereas catalysis is severely constrained at potentials below this value (21Sucheta A. Ackrell B.A.C. Cochran B. Armstrong F.A. Nature. 1992; 356: 361-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 22Ackrell B.A.C. Armstrong F.A. Cochran B. Sucheta A. Yu T.

Native QFRs by contrast, exhibit normal positive order kinetics (i.e. the rate of fumarate reduction increases with increasing thermodynamic driving force). The reasons for the differences in catalytic activity between the enzyme complexes remain unclear but are likely to relate to differences between the FAD and/or dicarboxylic acid binding sites of SQR and QFR (23Pershad H.R. Hirst J. Cochran B. Ackrell B.A.C. Armstrong F.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1412: 262-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 24Léger C. Heffron K. Pershad H.R. Maklashina E. Luna-Chavez C. Cecchini G. Ackrell B.A.C. Armstrong F.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11234-11245Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The remarkable degree of conservation of amino acid residues involved in substrate binding and interaction with the flavin in SQR and QFR has a notable exception. In E. coli FrdA, Glu-49 is located within 5 Å of the FAD cofactor, whereas in E. coli SdhA, a Gln residue (Gln-50) is found at this position. The majority of enzymes classified as QFRs contain a Glu at this position, whereas all SQRs contain a Gln. The soluble fumarate reductase homologs are exceptions, since they contain an Ala at this position. However, their structures reveal that this location is filled by the propionate group of a heme moiety, not present in the QFR/SQR family, which conserves the negative charge found in the QFRs. It should also be noted that the soluble flavoprotein homologs contain a noncovalently bound FAD cofactor and are essentially unable to oxidize succinate (25Turner K.L. Doherty M.K. Heering H.A. Armstrong F.A. Reid G.A. Chapman S.K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3302-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In this paper, we compare the catalytic and dicarboxylate binding effects of Glu, Gln, and Ala residues at position 49 in E. coli FrdA and position 50 in E. coli SdhA. The results show that Ala substitutions do not significantly alter the catalytic properties of QFR or SQR. Substitution at this position with the residue found in the complementary enzyme has profound effects on catalytic activity, with the SdhA-Q50E SQR mutant becoming a more efficient fumarate reductase, whereas the FrdA-E49Q QFR becomes a better succinate dehydrogenase. These substitutions, however, give no detectable alteration of the kinetic properties related to the “tunnel diode” effect. The results are discussed in the context of altered substrate binding, supported by an x-ray structure of the FrdA E49Q mutant QFR, and effects on the electronic status of the FAD moiety. E. coli strain DW35 (ΔfrdABCD, sdhC::kan), which was used as the host for expression of wild type and mutant forms of SQR and QFR, has been previously described (26Westenberg D.J. Gunsalus R.P. Ackrell B.A.C. Sices H. Cecchini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 815-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pH3 (frdA+B+C+D+) was used for expression of wild type QFR (26Westenberg D.J. Gunsalus R.P. Ackrell B.A.C. Sices H. Cecchini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 815-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and plasmid pFAS (PFRDsdhC+D+A+B+) was used for expression of wild type SQR (27Maklashina E. Berthold D.A. Cecchini G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5989-5996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pFAB-HT (frdA+B+) containing a C-terminal His tag has been previously described (24Léger C. Heffron K. Pershad H.R. Maklashina E. Luna-Chavez C. Cecchini G. Ackrell B.A.C. Armstrong F.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11234-11245Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and was used for expression of the two-subunit soluble fumarate reductase (FrdAB). Plasmids pH3 and pFAS were used as the templates for mutagenesis of the frdA and sdhA genes in QFR and SQR. Plasmid pFAB-HT was used as template for mutagenesis of frdA in the soluble FrdAB enzyme. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed utilizing the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Primers for mutagenesis were obtained from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Nucleotide changes to construct the mutants are underlined. To construct the SdhA Q50A mutant, primer 5′-ACCGTTTCTGCGGCAGGCGGCATTACCG-3′ and its reverse complement were designed. The SdhA Q50E mutant was constructed using the primer 5′-CCGTTTCTGCGGAAGGCGGATTACC-3′ and its reverse complement. Following mutagenesis, the 1390-base pair HindIII-BstXI fragment containing either the SdhA Q50E or Q50A mutation was cloned into pFAS for expression of the mutant enzyme. For the QFR FrdA E49Q mutation, the primer 5′-CATACCGTTGCTGCACAGGGGGGCTCC-3′ and its reverse complement were designed. The 1277-base pair BstEII-ApaI fragment containing the FrdA E49Q mutation was cloned into pH3 for the expression of the four subunit QFR and into pFAB-HT for the expression of two-subunit His-tagged fumarate reductase. The QFR FrdA E49A mutant was constructed using primer 5′-CCGTTGCTGCAGCAGGGGGCTCCGC-3′ and its reverse complement. Cloning of this mutant into plasmid pH3 used a similar strategy to that used for the FrdA E49Q mutant. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing using the University of California San Francisco biomolecular core facility. Plasmids encoding the mutations were subsequently transformed into E. coli DW35 for expression of mutant enzyme. QFR, SQR, and FrdAB were expressed in DW35 cells harboring the appropriate plasmid and grown under microaerophilic conditions. Starter cultures (25 ml) in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium with 150 μg/ml ampicillin were grown overnight at normal aeration. These cells were then used to inoculate 2-liter flasks filled with 1.4 liters of Terrific Broth medium containing ampicillin (150 μg/ml), and the cells were grown overnight at 37 °C with moderate aeration (150 rpm) on a gyrotory shaker. E. coli used to express soluble FrdAB was grown using an identical protocol for 16 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation (10 min at 5000 × g) and stored at -80 °C. Isolation of the membrane fractions enriched with wild type and mutant SQR and QFR enzymes was as previously described (28Luna-Chavez C. Iverson T.M. Rees D.C. Cecchini G. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 19: 188-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 29Horsefield R. Yankovskaya V. Törnroth S. Luna-Chavez C. Stambouli E. Barber J. Byrne B. Cecchini G. Iwata S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2003; 59: 600-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Protein extraction with the detergent Thesit (Anapoe C12E9 (polyoxyethylene 9-dodecyl ether; Anatrace Inc., Maumee, OH) and purification on Q-Sepharose fast flow chromatography were carried out as previously described for wild type and mutant QFR and SQR (28Luna-Chavez C. Iverson T.M. Rees D.C. Cecchini G. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 19: 188-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 29Horsefield R. Yankovskaya V. Törnroth S. Luna-Chavez C. Stambouli E. Barber J. Byrne B. Cecchini G. Iwata S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2003; 59: 600-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Purified enzyme fractions were pooled, concentrated under nitrogen using an Amicon cell and YM30 membrane, and stored at -80 °C. Isolation of the soluble His-tagged FrdAB suitable for protein film voltammetry was performed as previously described (24Léger C. Heffron K. Pershad H.R. Maklashina E. Luna-Chavez C. Cecchini G. Ackrell B.A.C. Armstrong F.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11234-11245Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) using nickel affinity resin (Qiagen). Soluble FrdAE49Q B mutant enzyme was purified by a protocol identical to that used for wild type FrdAB. FrdAB as isolated exhibits high initial rates of succinate oxidation and does not require preactivation. SQR and QFR as isolated, however, are only partially active due to the presence of tightly bound oxaloacetate at their active sites. To activate the enzymes, SQR and QFR were diluted to 1-2 mg of protein/ml in 30 mm bis-Tris-propane buffer, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Thesit, 3 mm malonate and incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. Activated enzymes were stored on ice for the duration of the experiment. The standard assay medium contained 30 mm bis-Tris-propane buffer (pH range 6.0-8.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.006% Thesit, and 3 mm potassium cyanide at 30 °C. Succinate Oxidation—The succinate oxidase reaction of SQR was monitored by the decrease of the absorbance at 600 nm in the presence of succinate, 1.5 mm phenazine ethosulfate, and 50 μm 2,6-dichloroindophenol (ϵ600 = 21.8 mm-1 cm-1 (pH 7.8)). The succinate-ferricyanide reductase activity of QFR was determined at 420 nm with 0.5m m potassium ferricyanide (ϵ420 = 1mm-1 cm-1) and 20 mm succinate. Fumarate Reduction—Fumarate reduction activities of QFR and SQR with quinol analogues were determined in a reaction coupled to DT dia-phorase (NADH:quinone reductase) as previously described (30Maklashina E. Cecchini G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 369: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) with menaquinone (MQ1) and ubiquinone (UQ1) for QFR and SQR, respectively (MQ1 and UQ1 were kindly provided by Eisai Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Fumarate reduction with a 0.2 mm concentration of the low potential electron donors benzylviologen (BV) or methylviologen was performed in 3-ml screw top cuvettes under a continuous flow of argon. Prior to initiation of the reaction, 10 mm glucose, glucose oxidase, and catalase were added to the assay medium to maintain anaerobiosis. A stoichiometric amount of sodium dithionite was added to reduce the viologens (starting absorbance ∼1.8), and the reaction was initiated by the addition of either enzyme or fumarate. The progress of the reaction was monitored by the decrease of viologen absorbance at 602 nm (ϵ602 = 9.6 mm-1 cm-1, pH 7.0), kcat was calculated using covalently bound FAD content. The soluble FrdAB domain containing the FrdA E49Q mutation was used for voltammetry experiments using a mixed buffer system at 25 °C as previously described (24Léger C. Heffron K. Pershad H.R.

A pyrolytic graphite edge rotating disk working electrode was used in conjunction with an EG&G model electrode rotator. Crystallization of the FrdA E49Q variant of E. coli QFR was performed by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method using 0.7 μl of protein solution (20 mg/ml, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.7% Thesit) and 0.7 μl of mother liquor (13.5% polyethylene glycol 5000 monomethyl ether, 200 mm magnesium acetate, 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.6, 100 μm ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid, and 0.001% dithiothreitol) at a temperature of 20 °C. Protein crystals grew after 1-2 days and were cryocooled after 3-5 days. Prior to flash cooling in liquid nitrogen, crystals were quickly dipped into cryosolution containing mother liquor and 30% ethylene glycol. Diffraction data were collected at the European Synchotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), beamline ID-13, using a wavelength of 0.9537 Å. Radiation damage was minimized by translating the crystals after every three degrees of data collection. Crystals belonged to the orthorhombic space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions a = 96.80 Å, b = 139.53 Å, c = 273.97 Å (Table 1). Data were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (32Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar) and the CCP4 suite of programs (33Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).

Moss D.A. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The final model of FrdA E49Q has an Rcryst of 0.246 and an Rfree of 0.285. Geometric indicators of model quality are reasonable with root mean square deviation in bond lengths of 0.024, angles of 2.60°, and 74% of residues in the most favored region of the Ramachandran diagram (Table 1).

The wild type (teal) and FrdA E49Q variant (yellow) are superimposed in the same view as Fig. 1. Only the main chains from the E49Q variant are shown for clarity. Oxygen atoms are in red, nitrogen atoms are in blue, and carbon atoms follow the color of the molecule. Little structural perturbation is observed, with a slight movement of the side chain functional group of Arg-287. However, an altered hydrogen-bonding pattern is observed, with a new hydrogen bonding interaction to the side chain of Glu-245, altered directionality of the hydrogen bond to Arg-287, and a putative hydrogen-bonding interaction with the N-5 of the FAD. The latter two have been shown to directly participate in the fumarate reduction reaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) FAD content was determined as previously described (42Maklashina E.

Protein concentration was determined by the BCA method (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard in the presence of 1% (w/v) SDS. In order to obtain data as representative as possible of the in vivo enzymes, all EPR data reported herein were obtained from preparations of cytoplasmic membranes that had been activated with malonate as described above. Potentiometric titrations were carried out at 25 °C in a buffer containing 100 mm Tricine/KOH (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm malonate at 25 °C as previously described (43Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3247-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The following redox mediators were used at a concentration of 25 μm: 2,6-dichlorindophenol, 1,2-naphthoquinone, toluylene blue, phenazine methosulfate, thionine, methylene blue, resorufin, indigotrisulfonate, indigocarmine, anthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid, and neutral red. EPR spectra were recorded using a Bruker ESP300E spectrometer equipped with a Bruker liquid nitrogen evaporating cryostat (an ER4111 VT variable temperature unit). Spectra were recorded at a temperature of 150 K (-123 °C) using a microwave power of 20 milliwatts at 9.438 GHz and a modulation amplitude of 2 Gpp (gauss, peak-to-peak) at 100 KHz. Five scans were accumulated for each sample. Em values determined by EPR were representative of two to three independent titrations with an S.D. value of approximately ±10 mV. Potentiometric titration data were analyzed by plotting the intensity of the g = 2.00 peak-trough versus Eh and fitting the data to two Em values (44Hastings S.F. Kaysser T.M. Jiang F. Salerno J.C.

The clinical development of BsAb as therapeutics has been hampered, however, by the difficulty in preparing the materials in sufficient quantity and quality by traditional methods. In recent years, a variety of recombinant methods has been developed for efficient production of BsAb, both as antibody fragments and as full-length IgG-like molecules. Here we describe a novel recombinant approach for the production of an Fc domain-containing, IgG-like tetravalent BsAb, with two antigen-binding sites to each of its target antigens, by genetically fusing a single variable domain antibody to the N terminus of the light chain of a functional IgG antibody of different specificity. A model BsAb was constructed using a single variable domain antibody to mouse platelet-derived growth factor receptor α and a conventional IgG antibody to mouse vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2. The BsAb was expressed in mammalian cells and purified to homogeneity by one-step protein A affinity chromatography. Furthermore, the BsAb retains the antigen binding specificity and the receptor neutralizing activity of both of its parent antibodies. This design and expression of Fc domain-containing, IgG-like BsAb should be applicable to the construction of similar BsAb from antibodies recognizing any pair of antigens.

The primary use of BsAb has been to redirect cytotoxic immune effector cells for enhanced killing of tumor cells. In this context, one arm of the BsAb binds an antigen on the tumor cell, and the other binds a determinant expressed on effector cells, such as CD3, CD16, or CD64, which are expressed on T lymphocytes, natural killer cells, or other mononuclear cells (Refs. 4Xiong D.

By cross-linking tumor and effector cells, the BsAb not only brings the effector cells within the proximity of the tumor cells but also simultaneously triggers their activation, leading to effective tumor cell killing. In addition, BsAb has also been used to enrich the tumor/normal tissue localization ratio of chemo- or radiotherapeutic agents. In this setting, one arm of the BsAb binds an antigen expressed on the cell targeted for destruction, and the other arm binds a chemotherapeutic drug, radioisotope, or toxin. The naked BsAb is administered first, and after sufficient time has passed for the BsAb to bind tumor cells and to clear from normal tissue, the cytotoxic molecule is delivered, with rapid accumulation in the tumor, because of its affinity for the tumor-bound BsAb (8Corvalan J.R.

A major obstacle in the general development of BsAb has been the difficulty of producing materials of sufficient quality and quantity for both preclinical and clinical studies. Initially, the main route to the production of BsAb was by co-expression of both the light chains (LC) and both the heavy chains (HC) of two parent antibodies of different specificities (antibody A and antibody B) in a single cell through either the hybrid hybridoma technique (16Milstein C. Cuello A.C. Nature. 1983; 305: 537-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) or DNA co-transfection. Unfortunately, assuming that all four polypeptide chains are equally expressed and that there is no pairing preference between any particular LC and HC, in addition to the desired heterodimeric BsAb product (LCA-HCA plus LCB-HCB), there are also a large number of undesired products formed from the 10 molecules that result from the 16 permutations of LC and HC pairings. Consequently, the desired binding-competent BsAb are a minor product (in theory, an eighth of the total), and purification from the other products is very difficult. Another traditional method for BsAb production is chemical conjugation of two antibodies (or their fragments) of different specificities (17Brennan M. Davison P.F. Paulus H. Science. 1985; 229: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The chemical modification process may inactivate the antibody or promote aggregation. As purification from undesired products remains difficult, the resulting low yield and poor quality BsAb makes this process, like the hybrid hybridoma and DNA co-transfection, unsuitable for the large scale production required for clinical development. In recent years, a variety of recombinant methods has been developed for the efficient production of BsAb, especially for BsAb antibody fragments (1Kontermann R.E. Acta Pharm. Sin. 2005; 26: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 18Carter P. Ridgway J. Zhu Z. J. Hematother. 1995; 4: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 19Todorovska A. Roovers R.C. Dolezal O. Kortt A.A. Hoogenboom H.R. Hudson P. J. Immunol. Methods. 2001; 248: 47-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the successful design and production of full-length IgG-like, i.e. Fc domain-containing, BsAb has been generally limited (20Carter P. J. Immunol. Methods. 2001; 248: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 21Marvin J. Zhu Z. Acta Pharm. Sin. 2005; 26: 649-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In this study, we describe a novel recombinant method for the production of an Fc domain-containing BsAb molecule by direct fusion of a single variable domain (sVD) antibody to the N terminus of the LC of a functional IgG antibody of a different specificity. The resulting BsAb molecule was expressed in mammalian cells and purified by protein A chromatography. Furthermore, the BsAb retained the binding specificities and the receptor neutralizing activities of both of the parent antibodies. Proteins and Cells—Recombinant mouse platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (mPDGFRα)-Fc, mouse vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (mVEGFR2)-Fc fusion proteins, and human PDGF-AA were purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). VEGF protein was expressed in baculovirus and purified at ImClone Systems (New York) following the procedure described elsewhere (22Lu D. Kussie P. Pytowski B. Persaud K. Bohlen P. Witte L. Zhu Z. J.

Pepper of University Medical Center, Geneva, Switzerland. The control antibodies 1C11, an antibody directed against human VEGFR2, and C225, an antibody directed against human epidermal growth factor receptor, were produced at ImClone Systems (23Zhu Z.

Selection of Anti-mPDGFRα Antibodies from a Phage Display Fab Library—A large naive human Fab phage display library from the Dyax Corp. (containing 3.7 × 1010 clones) (25Hoet R.M. Cohen E.H.

Briefly, the library stock (100 μl) was grown to log phase in 20 ml of 2YTAG medium (2YT contains 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 2% glucose), rescued with M13K07 helper phage, and amplified overnight in 2YTAK medium (2YT contains 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml kanamycin) at 30 °C. The phage preparation was precipitated in 4% polyethylene glycol, 0.5 m NaCl, and then resuspended in 1 ml of 3% fat-free milk/PBS containing 240 μg/ml of an unrelated human IgG and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h to block nonspecific binding and to deplete phages displaying Fab directed against human IgG Fc fragment. For each round of selection, mPDGFRα-Fc-coated Maxisorp Star tubes (Nunc, Rosklide, Denmark) were first blocked with 3% milk/PBS at 37 °C for 1 h and then incubated with the phage preparation at room temperature for 1 h. The tubes were washed 15 times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 followed by 15 washes with PBS. The bound phage was eluted at room temperature for 10 min with 1 ml of a freshly prepared solution of 100 mm triethylamine (Sigma). The eluted phages were incubated with 10 ml of mid-log phase TG1 cells at 37 °C for 30 min stationary and 30 min shaking. The infected TG1 cells were pelleted, plated onto three 2YTAG plates, and incubated overnight at 30 °C. All of the colonies grown on the plates were scraped into 3–5 ml of 2YTA medium, mixed with glycerol (final concentration, 10%), aliquoted, and stored at –80 °C. For subsequent rounds of selection, the phage stock (100 μl) from the previous round of selection was amplified and used for selection followed the procedure described above on Maxisorp Star tubes coated with decreasing amounts of mPDGFRα-Fc (50, 10, and 2 μg/ml for the 1st, the 2nd, and the 3rd round of selections, respectively). ELISA Screening for Antibodies with Binding and Blocking Activities—Individual TG1 clones recovered after each round of selection were randomly picked and grown at 37 °C in 96-well plates. To produce phage, the cells were rescued with M13K07 helper phage as described above. To produce soluble Fab, the cells were incubated in 2YTA medium containing 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) at 30 °C overnight. For binding ELISA, 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc) were coated with mPDGFRα-Fc (50 μl at 1 μg/ml, 4 °C overnight). The amplified phage preparation or the cell culture supernatant containing soluble Fab was blocked with 1/6 volume of 18% milk/PBS at room temperature for 1 h and added to the mPDGFRα-Fc-coated plates. After incubation at room temperature for 1 h, the plates were washed three times with PBST. For phage ELISA, the plates were incubated with a mouse anti-M13 phage antibody horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate (Amersham Biosciences); for Fab ELISA, the plates were incubated with a rabbit anti-human Fab antibody-HRP conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). The plates were then washed three times; TMB peroxidase substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) was added, and the absorbance at 450 nm was read using a microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). For blocking ELISA, phage or Fab supernatant was mixed with a fixed amount of mPDGFRα-Fc (0.5 μg/ml) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The mixture was then transferred to 96-well plates precoated with PDGF-AA (0.5 μg/ml) and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The plates were then incubated at room temperature for 1 h with a rabbit anti-human Fc antibody-HRP conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and developed as described above to quantify the amount of plate-bound mPDGFRα-Fc protein. Identification of Anti-mVEGFR2 Antibody 2B4—Anti-mVEGFR2 antibody, 2B4, was isolated from the Fab phage library (Dyax Corp.) following the same procedure described above on Maxisorp Star tubes coated with mVEGFR2-Fc fusion protein. 2B4 binds specifically to mVEGFR2 and blocks efficiently mVEGFR2/VEGF interaction. 4J. Shen, M. D. Vil, X. Jimenez, M. Iacolina, H. Zhang, and Z. Zhu, unpublished results. Expression and Purification of Soluble Fab Fragments—Phagemids of the individual selected clones were used to transform a nonsuppressor Escherichia coli host HB2151. Expression of the Fab fragments in HB2151 and purification of the soluble Fab proteins from the periplasmic extracts of the E. coli were carried out as described previously (26Lu D. Jimenez X. Zhang H. Bohlen P. Witte L. Zhu Z. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 97: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The Fab proteins were purified using protein G columns following the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). The purity and the molecular size of the purified proteins were analyzed by electrophoresis using a NuPAGE™ 4–12% BisTris gel (Invitrogen) followed by visualization by staining with SimplyBlue™ SafeStain (Invitrogen). Construction of Bispecific Anti-mPDGFRα × Anti-mVEGFR2 Antibody Based on the Single VH Domain Antibody 1F2—The BsAb was prepared using the single VH domain of the anti-mPDGFRα antibody, 1F2, and the variable domains (both VL and VH) from the conventional anti-mVEGFR2 antibody, 2B4, as the building blocks (Fig. 4). In this construct, 1F2 VH domain was linked on its C terminus via a 5-amino acid linker, Ala-Ser-Thr-Lys-Gly, to the N terminus of 2B4 LC. The resultant polypeptide, 1F2(VH)-2B4(VL)-CL, was then co-expressed with the 2B4 HC, 2B4(VH)-CH1-CH2-CH3, to form the bispecific molecule 1F2–2B4IgG. The BsAb construct was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells and purified using protein A affinity chromatography. The purity of the BsAb was assayed by SDS-PAGE analysis under both reducing and nonreducing conditions, and the protein concentrations were determined by ELISA, using an anti-human Fc antibody as the capturing agent and an anti-human κ chain antibody-HRP conjugate as the detection agent. A clinical grade antibody, C225, an antibody directed against human epidermal growth factor receptor, was used as the standard for calibration. Quantitative Receptor Binding and Blocking Assays—Two different assays were carried out to examine the binding specificity and efficiency of the BsAb. In the first assay, the cross-linking assay, the BsAb was tested for its capability in simultaneously binding two target receptors; the BsAb or the monospecific antibodies (5 nm) were first incubated with mVEGFR2 or mPDGFR-α (100 ng) in solution and then transferred to a microtiter plate coated with the second receptor, mPDGFR-α or mVEGFR2 (100 ng/well), followed by incubation with a biotin-labeled polyclonal antibody to the first receptor (the receptor in solution), mVEGFR2 or mPDGFR-α. The plate was then developed as described above after further incubation with a streptavidin-HRP conjugate. In the second assay, the direct binding assay, various amounts of purified antibodies were added to mPDGFRα-Fc- or mVEGFR2-Fc-coated plates (1 μg/ml) and incubated at room temperature for 1 h, after which the plates were washed three times with PBST. The plates were then incubated at room temperature for additional 1 h with a rabbit anti-human Fab antibody-HRP conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The plates were washed and developed. In the blocking assay, various amounts of antibodies were first mixed with a fixed amount of mPDGFRα-Fc or mVEGFR2-Fc (0.5 μg/ml) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The mixture was then transferred to 96-well plates precoated with rhPDGF-AA or VEGF (0.5 μg/ml) and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After washing three times, the plates were incubated with an anti-human Fc antibody-HRP conjugate and developed as described above. IC50, the antibody concentration that yielded 50% blockade of mPDGFRα or mVEGFR2 from binding to its respective ligand, was determined. Antibody Affinity Determination—The binding kinetics of various antibodies to their target receptors were measured using a BIAcore 3000 biosensor (BIAcore, Inc., Uppsala, Sweden). Briefly, mPDGFRα or mVEGFR2-Fc fusion protein was immobilized onto a sensor chip, and soluble antibodies were injected at concentrations ranging from 1.5 to 100 nm. Sensorgrams were obtained at each concentration and were evaluated using the program BIAevaluation 2.0. The affinity constant, Kd, was calculated from the ratio of dissociation rate (koff)/association rate (kon). Receptor Phosphorylation Assay—eEnd.1 cells were first examined for expression of mVEGFR2 and mPDGFRα via FACS analysis. Briefly, the cells were incubated with 2B4 IgG, 1F2-CH/CL, or 1F2–2B4IgG (10 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 1 h, followed by incubation with a PE-labeled goat anti-human Fc antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for an additional hour, and analysis on a Guava Easycyte System (Guava Technologies, Inc., Hayward, CA). In receptor phosphorylation assay, eEnd.1 cells were plated onto 6-cm dishes and grown to 70–80% confluence, after which the cells were washed twice in PBS and cultured overnight in serum-free medium. The cells were first incubated with various antibodies at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by stimulation with VEGF or PDGF-AA at 37 °C for 15 min. The cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin) for 1 h, followed by centrifugation of the lysate at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The receptors were immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate supernatant by an anti-mP-DGFRα (eBioscience, San Diego) or an anti-mVEGFR2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), followed by the addition of 20 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The precipitated receptor proteins were resolved on a 4–12% NuPAGE BisTris gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Phospho-mVEGFR2 and phospho-mPDGFRα were detected on the blot using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody-HRP conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Total receptor proteins loaded on the gel were assayed with antibodies to mPDGFRα or mVEGFR2 (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Identification of Single VH Domain Antibodies to mPDGFRα from a Fab Phage Display Library—A large naive human Fab phage display library containing 3.7 × 1010 clones was used to select antibodies directed against mPDGFRα. A total of three rounds of selection were performed on immobilized mPDGFRα-Fc fusion protein in the presence of a high concentration of an unrelated human IgG in the solution in order to deplete phage clones reacting with the Fc fragment. After the 2nd and the 3rd round of selection, 190 clones were randomly picked from each round and tested for PDGFRα binding and blocking activities by both phage ELISA and soluble Fab ELISA. More than 77% clones picked after the 2nd round and 99% of clones after the 3rd round bound specifically to mPDGFRα, suggesting a high efficiency of the selection process. Blocking assay revealed that ∼4.2% of binders also blocked mPDGFRα from binding to its ligand PDGF-AA. DNA sequencing analysis yielded eight distinct clones among the blockers. All these blockers, plus one nonblocker (clone 3F3), were selected for further study (Table 1). The VH and VL subgroup was assigned according to the classification of the Andrew CR Martin's Bioinformatics Group. No identical VHs or VLs were found among the nine clones, except for clones 1C10 and 1F2 (which share the same VH). Most interestingly, 4 of 8 blockers, clones 1C10, 1F2, 1F9, and 3G7, only possess a truncated LC. Clones 1F2 and 1F9 lack most of the VL domain because of an in-frame gene deletion but possess an intact CL domain. Clone 1C10 has a frameshift mutation within the complementarity determining region (CDR) 3 of VL resulting in reading frameshift and a stop codon that leads to deletion of the entire CL. Clone 3G7 has a stop codon at the 5′ end of VL gene because of a frameshift mutation leading to the loss of the entire LC (Fig. 1). Both clone 1C10 and 3G7 Fab-like fragments expressed very poorly in E. coli because they lacked the CL domain.TABLE 1Identification of anti-mPDGFRα antibodies from a Fab phage display libraryCloneVH subgroupVL subgroupCLBindingBlocking1C10IκIINoaCL domain deletion due to a stop codon in the N terminus of CL resulted from a frame-shift mutation within the CDR3.+bBinding to immobilized mPDGFRα receptor protein was determined by a semi-quantitative phage-based ELISA. + indicates OD450 nm <0.5; ++ indicates OD450 nm between 0.5 to 2.0; and +++ indicates OD450 nm >2.0.++cBlockade of mPDGFRα/PDGF-AA interaction as determined by a semi-quantitative phage-based ELISA. - indicates no blocking; +, ++, and +++ indicate a blocking potency of 35-50, 51-75, and >75%, respectively.1F2INAdNo VL domain.

Open table in a new tab The Fab fragments of six clones were expressed in E. coli, purified by affinity chromatography using protein G column, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). Under nonreducing conditions, Fabs with complete light and heavy chains, clones 1A11, 1E10, 3B2, and 3F3, yielded a single protein band with a molecular mass of ∼50 kDa (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, Fab fragments of 1F2 and 1F9 gave a small band of ∼37.5 kDa because of the lack of VL domain (Fig. 2B). Under reducing conditions, the conventional Fab fragment showed two bands, the LC and the VH-CH1 fragment, of about the same size (∼25 kDa), which was not distinguishable under the electrophoresis condition (Fig. 2B). 1F2 and 1F9 Fabs yielded two bands that were resolved under the electrophoretic conditions as follows: the upper bands correlate with the normal size VH-CH1 fragment, and the lower bands represent the CL fragment only (∼12. 5 kDa) (Fig. 2B). mPDGFRα Binding and mPDGFRα/PDGF-AA Blocking by the Anti-mPDGFRα Antibodies—Purified Fab fragments from six clones were compared quantitatively in their binding efficiency to mPDGFRα and their potency in blocking mPDGFRα/PDGF-AA interaction. Clone 1F2 Fab, a single VH domain clone, is the most efficient binder to the receptor, followed by 1F9, another VH domain-only clone, and then the conventional Fab fragments, clones 1A11, 1E10, 3F3, and 3B2 (Fig. 3A). Clone 1F2 is also the most potent blocker to receptor/ligand interaction, with an IC50 of 12 nm, which is followed by clone 1F9 (IC50, 57 nm), 1E10 (IC50, 140 nm), 1A11 (IC50, 220 nm) (Fig. 3B). Clone 3B2, a weak blocker in phage-based ELISA, failed show any blocking activity as soluble Fab protein. The control clone, 3F3, binds well to the receptor but does not block receptor/ligand interaction. The binding kinetics of various anti-mPDGFRα clones were determined by surface plasmon resonance on a BIAcore instrument. Consistent with ELISA binding assay, 1F2 showed the highest binding affinity with a Kd of 0.42 ± 0.21 nm (kon, 9.2 ± 4.2 × 105 m–1 s–1, koff, 3.1 ± 0.76 × 10–4 s–1), which is followed by clone 1F9 (Kd, 2.1 ± 0.75 nm) and clone 1E10 (Kd, 12.2 ± 2.9 nm). When clone 1F2 was converted into a divalent Fab form (VH-CH1/VH-CL), the affinity was further increased to 0.08 nm, representing a 5-fold enhancement over the monovalent 1F2 Fab. As a comparison, the divalent IgG form of clone 1E10 has a binding affinity of 0.81 ± 0.34 nm (data not shown). Identification of the Anti-mVEGFR2 Antibody 2B4—The anti-mVEGFR2 antibody, 2B4, was isolated from the Fab phage library (Dyax Corp.) by selecting on Maxisorp Star tubes coated with mVDGFR2-Fc fusion protein (Fig. 1). Fab fragment of 2B4 binds specifically to mVEGFR2 and blocks mVEGFR2/VEGF interaction. The binding affinity of 2B4 Fab and IgG to mVEGFR2 was 6.7 ± 3.0 and 0.39 ± 0.1 nm, respectively, as determined by BIAcore analysis. 2B4 IgG blocks mVEGFR2/VEGF interaction with an IC50 value of ∼3.5 nm. Construction and Expression of sVD Antibody-based BsAb—The BsAb construct was prepared using the variable domains from the single VH domain antibody 1F2 and the conventional antibody, 2B4 (Fig. 4A). 1F2 VH was first fused to the N terminus of 2B4 VL via a 5-amino acid linker to form 1F2VH-2B4 LC, which was then co-expressed with the intact HC of 2B4 (Fig. 4A). As a control, a bivalent 1F2 molecule, 1F2-CH/CL, was also created by co-expression the 1F2VH-CH1-CH2-CH3 fusion along with the CL domain (Fig. 4A). All the antibody molecules were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells and purified from the supernatant of cell cultures by affinity chromatography using protein A columns. The purified antibodies were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under both nonreducing and reducing conditions. When assayed under nonreducing condi"
https://openalex.org/W2146855688,"We investigate the role of Rab4, a Ras-like small GTPase coordinating protein transport from the endosome to the plasma membrane, on the recycling and activation of endogenous β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) in HL-1 cardiac myocytes in vitro and transgenic mouse hearts in vivo. β1-AR, the predominant subtype of β-AR in HL-1 cardiac myocytes, was internalized after stimulation with isoproterenol (ISO) and fully recycled at 4 h upon ISO removal. Transient expression of Rab4 markedly facilitated recycling of internalized β-AR to the cell surface and enhanced β-AR signaling as measured by ISO-stimulated cAMP production. Transgenic overexpression of Rab4 in the mouse myocardium significantly increased the number of β-AR in the plasma membrane and augmented cAMP production at the basal level and in response to ISO stimulation. Rab4 overexpression induced concentric cardiac hypertrophy with a moderate increase in ventricle/body weight ratio and posterior wall thickness and a selective up-regulation of the β-myosin heavy chain gene. These data provide the first evidence indicating that Rab4 is a rate-limiting factor for the recycling of endogenous β-AR and augmentation of Rab4-mediated traffic enhances β-AR function in cardiac myocytes.

Three subtypes, β1-AR, β2-AR, and β3-AR, have been identified in the mammalian hearts. β1-AR and β2-AR are major mediators of cardiac contractility through coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins to regulate the activation of adenylyl cyclases, which in turn modulates production of intracellular cAMP and activation of protein kinase A. β1-AR couples to the stimulatory G protein Gs, whereas β2-AR couples to both Gs and the inhibitory G protein Gi (1Xiang Y.

The number of β-AR at the cell surface at a certain time determines the amplitude of functional response to β-AR stimulation by extracellular hormones. This number of cell surface receptors is regulated by precise receptor intracellular trafficking and targeting. Intracellular trafficking of the receptors is a dynamic process and highly coordinated by many regulatory factors at distinct organelles (6Ulloa-Aguirre A. Janovick J.A. Brothers S.P. Conn P.M.

After being synthesized, folded, and assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the β-ARs are transported from the ER to the plasma membrane through the Golgi apparatus, where posttranslational modifications (e.g. glycosylation) occur. Upon stimulation with agonists, the β-ARs at the plasma membrane may undergo internalization to the endosome (8Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

The internalization involves phosphorylation of β-ARs by at least two kinases, protein kinase A and G protein receptor kinase (GRK), and subsequent binding of the phosporylated receptors to arrestins, which serve as adaptor proteins recruiting components of the transport machinery to the clathrin-coated pits, initiating formation of the early endosome (10Hausdorff W.P.

The internalized receptors in the early endosome may be sorted to the lysosome for degradation or to the recycling endosome for return to the plasma membrane (12Morrison K.J. Moore R.H. Carsrud N.D.

Rab proteins are Ras-like small GTPases that regulate vesicular protein transport in both endocytosis and exocytosis (6Ulloa-Aguirre A. Janovick J.A. Brothers S.P. Conn P.M.

Although most of the Rab GTPases identified are ubiquitous and highly conserved in their structure and function, each Rab GTPase has a distinct intracellular localization and regulates discrete protein transport steps in secretory and endocytic pathways (15Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar, 16Rosenfeld J.L. Knoll B.J. Moore R.H.

For example, Rab5 modulates protein transport from the plasma membrane to the endosome, whereas Rab4 is specifically involved in the transport from the early endosome to the plasma membrane (7Duvernay M.T.

Life Sci. 2003; 74: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). For GPCRs, Rab4 has been demonstrated to regulate the recycling of internalized β2-AR, neurokinin 1 receptor, and CB1 cannabinoid receptor (9Seachrist J.L. Anborgh P.H. Ferguson S.S. J. Biol.

However, these studies were carried out in systems overexpressing individual receptors and the function of Rab4 was manipulated through expressing dominant-negative Rab4 mutants to attenuate endogenous Rab4 function. These studies have demonstrated that Rab4 is essential for the recycling of internalized GPCRs back to the plasma membrane. Importantly, endogenous Rab4 expression is augmented in transgenic mouse hearts overexpressing β2-AR, which develop heart failure (21Wu G. Yussman M.G. Barrett T.J. Hahn H.S. Osinska H. Hilliard G.M. Wang X. Toyokawa T. Yatani A. Lynch R.A. Robbins J. Dorn G.W. II. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 1130-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), suggesting that endogenous Rab4 level may be altered in certain pathological conditions. However, the effects of increase wild-type Rab4 expression on the GPCR recycling and signaling and on the cardiac function have not been studied. In this report, we investigated the effect of augmentation of Rab4 function on the recycling and activation of endogenous β-AR in both cardiac myocytes in vitro and mouse hearts in vivo. Our data demonstrated that increased wild-type Rab4 expression facilitated recycling to the plasma membrane and signaling of β-AR in cultured HL-1 cardiac myocytes. Our results also showed that cardiac specific overexpression of wild-type Rab4 augmented the membrane targeting and function of β-AR. Furthermore, overexpression of wild-type Rab4 induced cardiac hypertrophy with preserved contractile function. These data provide the first evidence indicating that endogenous Rab4 expression level is a rate-limiting factor for the recycling of endogenous β-AR and that augmentation of Rab4-mediated traffic enhances β-AR function in cardiac myocytes.

Culture and Transfection of HL-1 Cardiomyocytes—HL-1 myocytes were plated onto 12-well plates at a density of 4 × 105 cells/well and cultured in Claycomb medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.1 mm norepinephrine, and 2 mm l-glutamine as described previously (23Filipeanu C.M.

Rab4 was tagged with FLAG epitope at the amino terminus of Rab4 (FLAG-Rab4) by PCR using a primer GACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAG coding a peptide DYKDDDDK. The FLAG epitope has been used to label a number of proteins resulting in tagged-proteins with similar characteristics to their respective wild-types (24Wozniak M. Saunders C. Schramm N. Keefer J.R. Limbird L.E. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 343: 530-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). After 24-h culture without norepinephrine, HL-1 myocytes were transiently transfected with 2 μg of Rab4 or the pcDNA3 vector using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) as described previously (23Filipeanu C.M.

Ligand Binding in Intact HL-1 Cardiomyocytes—Intact cell ligand binding was used to measure cell surface expression of β-AR. HL-1 myocytes were cultured on 12-well plates and incubated with [3H]CGP12177 at a concentration of 20 nm for 2 h at room temperature. To measure the expression of β1-AR and β2-AR subtypes, the HL-1 cells were preincubated with the β1-AR-selective antagonist atenolol (20 μm) or the β2-AR-selective antagonist ICI118,551 (20 μm) for 30 min. The nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of alprenolol (20 μm). After washing twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (1 ml each time), the cells were digested with 1 ml of 1 m NaOH. The radioactivity was counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry in 5 ml of Ecoscint A scintillation solution (National Diagnostics, Inc., Atlanta, GA). Measurement of β-AR Internalization and Recycling in HL-1 Myocytes—β-AR internalization in response to stimulation with ISO and recycling of internalized receptors were determined as essentially described (9Seachrist J.L.

Briefly, HL-1 myocytes were cultured on 12-well plates and transfected as described above. At 48 h after transfection, the cells were incubated with ISO at a concentration of 10 μm for different times at 37 °C to initiate receptor internalization. The cells were washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium to remove ISO and allowed to recover for different time periods (from 15 to 240 min). β-AR expression at the cell surface was then determined by ligand binding as described above. Generation of Rab4 Transgenic Mice—Transgenic mice overexpressing Rab4 in the myocardium were generated essentially as described (21Wu G. Yussman M.G. Barrett T.J. Hahn H.S. Osinska H. Hilliard G.M. Wang X. Toyokawa T. Yatani A. Lynch R.A. Robbins J. Dorn G.W. II. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 1130-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding FLAG-Rab4 was cloned into exon three of the full-length mouse α-myosin heavy chain (MHC) promoter (21Wu G. Yussman M.G. Barrett T.J. Hahn H.S. Osinska H. Hilliard G.M. Wang X. Toyokawa T. Yatani A. Lynch R.A. Robbins J. Dorn G.W. II. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 1130-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The entire 7.7-kb transgene fragment containing the entire α-MHC promoter, the complete FLAG-Rab4 cDNA, and a human growth hormone polyadenylation signal sequence was released from the plasmid backbone by digestion with BamHI and was used for microinjection into pronuclei of fertilized mouse oocytes (FVB/N background) using standard techniques (Pennington Biomedical Research Institute, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA). Transgenic mice were identified by Southern blot or PCR analysis using genomic DNA extracted from mouse tails. All studies were performed in Rab4 transgenic mice and nontransgenic (NTG) siblings at 22 weeks old in accordance with protocols approved by the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Measurement of Cardiac β-AR Expression—β-AR density was measured as described (25Schwinger R.H.G. Böhm M. Erdmann E. Am. Heart J. 1990; 119: 899-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), with modifications. Briefly, myocardial membranes were prepared by homogenization of both ventricles with a Polytron in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl supplemented with Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) and centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 40 min. Final membrane preparations were re-suspended in binding buffer containing 75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 12.5 mm MgCl2,2 mm EDTA at a concentration of 2.0 mg/ml. Receptor binding of myocardial membranes was performed using the nonselective β-AR ligand [125I]iodocyanopindolol. Reactions were conducted in 500 μl of binding buffer containing 25 μg of membrane proteins and 400 pm [125I]iodocyanopindolol for 1 h. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 20 μm alprenolol. The reactions were terminated by vacuum filtration through glass-fiber filters. The radioactivity was counted in a γ counter. All assays were performed in duplicate, and receptor density was expressed as fmol/mg of membrane protein. Measurement of cAMP Production— cAMP production in response to stimulation with ISO or forskolin was measured in the presence of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (0.5 mm), a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, by using cAMP enzymeimmunoassay system (Biotrak, Amersham Biosciences) as described (26Sato M. Gettys T.W. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13375-13382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For measurement of cAMP production by membrane fractions prepared from NTG and Rab4 transgenic mouse ventricles, an aliquot of membrane fraction (about 0.8 μg of protein) was transferred into microtiter plates and then incubated with anti-cAMP antiserum, followed by the incubation with cAMP-peroxidase. After washing and addition of substrate, peroxidase activity was measured by spectrometry. cAMP concentrations were calculated based on the competition of cAMP in samples with a fixed quantity of peroxidase-labeled cAMP. For measurement of cAMP production in cultured cardiomyocytes, HL-1 cells were cultured in 12-well plates and transfected with 2 μg of Rab4 or pcDNA3 as described above. After 48 h, the cells were stimulated with increasing concentrations of ISO (from 10-9 to 10-5 m) or forskolin (100 μm) for 10 min at room temperature. The reactions were stopped by aspirating the medium and then the cells were lysed using 200 μl of dodecyltrimethylammonium (2.5%). One-hundred μl of cell lysate was used to determine cAMP concentration as described above. Measurement of Cardiac Hypertrophy—Morphometric analysis and histological examination of Masson's trichrome- and hematoxylin-eosin-stained ventricles used standard techniques as described previously (21Wu G.

Radiolabeled RNA dots were quantitated with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences), and expression of each cardiac gene was normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression. Echocardiography—Mice were anesthetized with avertin (250 mg/kg, intraperitoneal). Cardiac ultrasound studies were performed on Rab4 transgenic mice and NTG sibling controls at 22 weeks old using a SSA770 Aplio Ultrasound system (Toshiba America Medical Systems, Tustin, CA) with a 1204AX linear array transducer scanning at 14 MHz center frequency. Depth setting was 2 cm with a 0.75-cm electronic focus and two-dimensional imaging frame rate of 238 Hz. Two-dimensional guided M-mode studies of the left ventricle at the level of the papillary muscles were performed. M-mode measurements were made using the leading-edge to leading-edge method, as per American Society of Echocardiography guidelines (28Sahn D.J. DeMaria A.N. Kisslo J. Weyman A.E. Circulation. 1978; 58: 1072-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (7194) Google Scholar). The left ventricular end-systolic dimension (ESD) was determined as the point in time when the posterior left ventricular wall was most anterior and left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (EDD) when the posterior LV wall was most posterior. Left ventricular fractional shortening (the proportion of blood ejected during systole compared with maximal ventricular capacity in diastole) was measured as: (EDD - ESD)/EDD. Both sonographer and interpreter were blinded to the identity of experimental groups. Immunoblot Analysis—Western blot analysis of protein expression was carried out as described previously (22Wu G. Zhao G. He Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47062-47069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 23Filipeanu C.M. Zhou F. Claycomb W.C. Wu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41077-41084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The signal was detected using ECL Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) with a Fujifilm Luminescent Image Analyzer (LAS-1000plus) and quantitated using Image Gauge Program (Version 3.4). Protein loading and transfer efficiency were evaluated by Amido Black staining of the membrane after immunoblotting. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Differences were evaluated using Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Effect of Transient Expression of Rab4 on the Recycling of Internalized β-AR in HL-1 Cardiomyocytes—To determine whether Rab4 is involved in the regulation of endogenous β-AR recycling in cardiac myocytes, we choose HL-1 cardiomyocytes, an immortal cardiac muscle cell line that proliferates and retains phenotypic characteristics of cardiomyocytes (29Claycomb W.C. Lanson N Jr A. Stallworth B.S. Egeland D.B. Delcarpio J.B. Bahinski A. Izzo Jr., N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2979-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar). We first determined the relative expression of β1-AR and β2-AR in HL-1 myocytes by ligand binding in intact cells in the presence or absence of the β1-AR-selective antagonist atenolol or the β2-AR-selective antagonist ICI118,551. β1-AR is the predominant subtype of β-AR in HL-1 cardiac myocyte, whereas β2-AR expression is markedly lower than that of β1-AR (Fig. 1A). Internalization of β-AR in response to stimulation with ISO in HL-1 cardiac myocytes was then characterized. ISO stimulation induced internalization of plasma membrane β-AR in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, B and C). Cell surface expression of β-AR was reduced by 23% after ISO stimulation for 15 min and the internalization reached the maximum after simulation for 30-60 min (Fig. 1B). The cell surface expression of β-AR was significantly attenuated by 57% in HL-1 myocytes after stimulation with ISO at a concentration of 10 μm for 30 min (Fig. 1C). In the next series of experiments we determined whether increased Rab4 function could modulate the recycling of internalized β-AR in HL-1 myocytes. HL-1 myocytes were transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged Rab4. Rab4 expression was then determined by Western blotting using FLAG high affinity monoclonal and Rab4 antibodies. The FLAG antibody detected only exogenously transfected Rab4, whereas the Rab4 antibody detected both transfected FLAG-Rab4 and endogenous Rab4. Rab4 expression was about four times higher in the FLAG-Rab4 transfected cells than endogenous Rab4 in cells transfected with the pcDNA3 vector (Fig. 2A). β-AR expression at the cell surface as measured by intact cell ligand binding was about the same in cells transfected with the pcDNA vector and Rab4 (specific binding in pcDNA-transfected cells: 2242 ± 151 cpm and in Rab4-transfected cells: 2171 ± 237 cpm, n = 3 each in duplicate). The HL-1 myocytes were treated by ISO for 30 min to initiate internalization and then allowed to recover for various period of time (15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min). After 4 h, β-ARs were fully recycled back to the plasma membrane in myocytes transfected with the pcDNA3 vector (Fig. 2B). However, the recycling of internalized β-AR was much faster in HL-1 myocytes transfected with Rab4 and reached the maximal recovery after 2 h (Fig. 2B). At 4 h after recycling, the expression of β-AR at the cell surface is similar in HL-1 myocytes transfected with control plasmid and Rab4. These data indicate that increased Rab4 function by transient expression of wild-type Rab4 facilitates the recycling of ISO-internalized endogenous β-AR, mostly β1-AR, in HL-1 cardiomyocytes. Effect of Transient Expression of Rab4 on β-AR Signaling in HL-1 Cardiomyocytes—To determine whether Rab4-faciliated recycling of internalized β-AR could modulate β-AR signaling, we measured the effect of transient expression of Rab4 on cAMP production in HL-1 cardiomyocytes. HL-1 myocytes were stimulated with increasing concentration of ISO (from 10-9 to 10-5 m) and intracellular cAMP concentrations were then measured. cAMP production in response to ISO stimulation at concentrations from 10-8 to 10-5 m was significantly higher in myocytes transfected with Rab4 than myocytes transfected with the pcDNA3 vector Fig. 3. To determine whether increased cAMP production in Rab4-transfected HL-1 myocytes is due to the alteration of adenylyl cyclase activity, we measured cAMP production in response to stimulation with forskolin, which directly activates adenylyl cyclases, bypassing the plasma membrane receptors. Forskolin-stimulated cAMP production was almost the same in Rab4 and pcDNA-transfected HL-1 myocytes (7109 ± 780 pmol/well versus 7235 ± 861 pmol/well, n = 3, p > 0.05). These data indicate that Rab4 is able to regulate β-AR signaling through modulating β-AR recycling. Effect of Transgenic Overexpression of Rab4 on β-AR Expression in the Plasma Membrane—Preceding data indicate that increased Rab4 function facilitates recycling of internalized endogenous β-AR in cultured HL-1 myocytes. To determine whether increased Rab4 function could influence β-AR recycling in cardiac myocytes in vivo, we generated transgenic mice cardiac-specifically expressing FLAG-tagged Rab4. Transgenic mice were identified by Southern blot and PCR analyses of genomic DNA extracted from mouse tails. Rab4 expression in the ventricles of Rab4 transgenic and NTG mice was determined by Western blot analysis using anti-Rab4 and FLAG antibodies. Rab4 expression in transgenic mouse ventricles was increased by about 12-fold compared with NTG siblings (Fig. 4A). Expression of Rab1 and Rab5 was the same in Rab4 transgenic and NTG mouse ventricles (Fig. 4A), indicating that cardiac overexpression of Rab4 had no compensatory effects on the expression of other closely related Rab GTPases. We next determined whether Rab4 overexpression could alter the density of β-AR in the plasma membrane by radioligand binding. As β-AR are synthesized in the ER and transported to the plasma membrane through the Golgi apparatus, any contamination of the ER and/or the Golgi in the plasma membrane fractions would influence the actual number of the receptors in the plasma membrane. Thus, we first determined whether the plasma membrane preparations contained the ER and/or Golgi by measuring the expression of the ER marker calregulin, the Golgi marker GM130, and the plasma membrane marker Na+-K+-ATPase by immunoblotting. Both calregulin and GM130 were exclusively detected in the cytosolic fraction but not in the membrane fraction, whereas Na+-K+-ATPase was detected in the membrane fraction but not in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 4B). These data indicate that the membrane preparations did not contain the ER and the Golgi. β-AR density was significantly increased in the membrane fraction from Rab4 transgenic mouse ventricles by 22% (Fig. 4C) compared with that from NTG. In contrast to the increased β-AR density, expression of Gs, Gi, Gβ, and GRK2, molecules involved in the β-AR signaling, was not altered in Rab4 transgenic mice (Fig. 4D). These data indicate that increased Rab4 function by overexpressing wild-type Rab4 selectively augments β-AR expression in the plasma membrane. Effect of Transgenic Overexpression of Rab4 on β-AR Signaling—We then determined whether enhanced Rab4 expression in the plasma membrane in vivo could activate β-AR signaling. cAMP production in response to stimulation with ISO was measured using membrane preparations from Rab4 transgenic and NTG mouse ventricles. Consistent with the increased β-AR density in the plasma membrane, ISO-stimulated cAMP production was significantly augmented by 3.3-fold in ventricles from Rab4 transgenic mice as compared with NTG controls (Fig. 5A). cAMP production at basal level was also significantly increased by 1.6-fold in Rab4 transgenic mouse hearts (Fig. 5A). ISO-promoted cAMP production is doubled in Rab"

Strains possessing this locus are known to produce sialylated outer core structures that mimic host gangliosides, and have been implicated in triggering the onset of Guillain-Barré syndrome. The acetyltransferase, which was cloned and expressed as a fusion construct in Escherichia coli, is soluble and homologous with members of the NodL-LacA-CysE family of O-acetyltransferases. This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of O-acetyl groups onto oligosaccharide-bound sialic acid, with a high specificity for terminal α2,8-linked residues. The modification is directed to C-9 and not C-7 as is believed to occur more commonly in other organisms.

Despite their wide prevalence and importance in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, this is the first report to describe the characterization of a purified sialate O-acetyltransferase. As the terminal residue of membrane-associated glycoconjugates in vertebrates and higher invertebrates, sialic acids are important parts of the cellular apparatus devoted to the detection and integration of environmental stimuli. Several pathogenic microorganisms are known to incorporate sialic acids into their surface structures, thereby mimicking an abundant molecular component displayed by host cells and providing a mechanism to evade immune response (1Vimr E. Lichtensteiger C. Trends Microbiol. 2002; 10: 254-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Sialic acids are a family of carboxylated monosaccharides that possess a common backbone structure of 9 carbon atoms. The structural diversity in the family arises as a result of various modifications to the biochemical precursor and most naturally abundant member, 5-N-acetyl-neuraminic acid (NeuAc) 2The abbreviations used are: NeuAc, 5-N-acetylneuraminic acid; CE-MS, capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry; FCHASE, 6-(5-fluorescein-carboxamido)-hexanoic acid succimidyl ester; LOS, lipo-oligosaccharide; SOAT, sialate O-acetyltransferase; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; HMBC, heteronuclear multiple bond coherence. 2The abbreviations used are: NeuAc, 5-N-acetylneuraminic acid; CE-MS, capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry; FCHASE, 6-(5-fluorescein-carboxamido)-hexanoic acid succimidyl ester; LOS, lipo-oligosaccharide; SOAT, sialate O-acetyltransferase; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; HMBC, heteronuclear multiple bond coherence.

One commonly observed modification is O-acetylation at one or more of the hydroxyl groups at positions 4, 7, 8 or 9. This process, which is catalyzed enzymatically by sialate O-acetyltransferases (SOATs), changes the binding and recognition characteristics of the underlying molecule and, as a result, diversifies the interaction potential for a given sialoglycan. O-Acetylation of sialic acids has been implicated in a growing number of physiological and pathological processes. In developing animals, ganglioside O-acetylation is associated with tissue growth and differentiation (4Blum A.S. Barnstable C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8716-8720Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 5Constantine-Paton M. Blum A.S. Mendez-Otero R. Barnstable C.J. Nature. 1986; 324: 459-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This process is of clinical importance because different degrees of modification have been observed in human cell lines that have undergone malignant transformation (6Cheresh D.A. Reisfeld R.A. Varki A.P. Science. 1984; 225: 844-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 7Fahr C. Schauer R. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2001; 116: 254-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Therefore O-acetylated gangliosides could serve as targets for directed cancer therapies. O-Acetylation has contrasting effects on the process of viral attachment to membrane-bound sialoglycans; this is an obligatory modification for the association of some enteric and respiratory viruses but inhibits binding by others (8Herrler G.

Biochem. 1976; 54: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) have been shown to be O-acetylated in some cases, which results in altered immunogenic properties. As a result of the biological importance of sialic acid O-acetylation in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, there has been considerable effort directed toward the identification and characterization of SOATs. Recently, the genes encoding putative SOATs involved in capsule O-acetylation have been identified in E. coli K1 (11Deszo E.L. Steenbergen S.M. Freedberg D.I. Vimr E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5564-5569Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and N. meningitidis (14Claus H. Borrow R. Achtman M. Morelli G. Kantelberg C. Longworth E. Frosch M. Vogel U. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 227-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). As yet, there have been no reports detailing their expression and characterization in vitro. Progress on the eukaryotic front has been slower; there have been no SOATs identified in any organism. A number of obstacles have hindered the ability to clone and purify these enzymes from a eukaryotic source. Two important contributing factors are that they are membrane-associated, and their activity may be codependent on the presence of other proteins (for a more detailed discussion, see Ref. 15Shi W.X. Chammas R. Varki A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The mucosal pathogen Campylobacter jejuni is a leading cause of diarrheal disease and of food-borne gastroenteritis worldwide (16Nachamkin I. Allos B.M. Ho T. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 11: 555-567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This organism exhibits a highly variable array of cell-surface glycans that are associated with virulence (17Gilbert M. Karwaski M.F.

In several strains of C. jejuni, the glycan component of the lipo-oligosaccharide (LOS) is sialylated and structurally similar to gangliosides (19Aspinall G.O. McDonald A.G. Raju T.S. Pang H.

There is a convincing body of evidence to suggest that the LOS from these strains may be responsible for generating antibodies that are cross-reactive with host epitopes found in abundance in nervous tissue, triggering an auto-immune response, which gives rise to Guillain-Barré syndrome (24Godschalk P.C. Heikema A.P. Gilbert M. Komagamine T. Ang C.W. Glerum J. Brochu D. Li J. Yuki N. Jacobs B.C. van Belkum A. Endtz H.P. J. Clin.

In this report, we describe the identification of a SOAT gene (orf11) in the LOS biosynthesis locus of C. jejuni, which was cloned into E. coli and stably expressed as a fusion construct. Our identification of this gene is the first evidence, to our knowledge, to indicate that LOS-bound NeuAc may be O-acetylated in C. jejuni or any other bacterial species. The expression of the enzyme in a heterologous source, and subsequent purification, enabled precise biochemical characterization, which as noted above, has proven intractable in studies of SOATs found in other organisms to date. Cloning of the SOAT from C. jejuni—The orf11 gene was amplified from the various C. jejuni strains using the Pwo polymerase and the following primers: CJ-175 (5′-CTTAGGAGGTCATATGGAAAAAATAACCTTAAAATGC-3′ 37 mer, NdeI site in italics) and CJ-176 (5′-CCTAGGTCGACTTAAAATAGATTAAAAATTTTTTTTGATTTTAG-3′ 44 mer, SalI site in italics). The PCR products were digested with NdeI and SalI and cloned in pCWori+(-lacZ) containing the sequence encoding the E. coli maltose-binding protein (without the leader peptide) and the thrombin cleavage site. Purification of the Recombinant SOAT—E. coli AD202 containing construct CJL-130 (Orf11 from C. jejuni ATCC 43446 in pCWori+) was grown in 2 YT medium containing 150 μg/ml ampicillin and 2 g/liter glucose. The culture was incubated at 37 °C until A600 = 0.35, induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and then incubated overnight at 20 °C. The cells were broken using an Avestin C5 Emulsiflex cell disruptor (Avestin, Ottawa) and the MalE-Orf11 fusion was purified by affinity chromatography on amylose resin following the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). In Vitro O-Acetyltransferase Reaction—6-(5-Fluorescein-carbox-amido)-hexanoic acid succimidyl ester (FCHASE)-labeled oligosaccharides were prepared as described previously (26Wakarchuk W.W. Cunningham A.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 213: 263-274PubMed Google Scholar). The acetyltransferase activity was assayed using 0.5 mm NeuAcα-2,8-NeuAcα-2,3-Galβ-1,4-Glc-FCHASE, 1 mm acetyl-CoA, 50 mm Mes (pH 6.5), 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The enzymatic reactions were performed at 37 °C for 5 min and were stopped by the addition of acetonitrile (25% final). The samples were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis (CE) as described previously (26Wakarchuk W.W. Cunningham A.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 213: 263-274PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that produces 1 μmol of 9-O-acetylated product in 1 min. Quantitation of the reactions was performed by integration of the CE trace peaks using the MDQ 32 Karat software (Beckman, CA). TLC analysis was performed with aluminum backed silica plates that were developed in ethyl acetate:methanol:water:acetic acid (4:2:1:0.1). Determination of the O-Acetylation Site by NMR Spectroscopy—Lyophilized O-acetyl-NeuAcα-2,8-NeuAcα-2,3-Galβ-1,4-Glc-FCHASE was dissolved in D2O at a concentration of ∼3 mm. Standard 1H-13C HSQC and HMBC spectra were acquired to assign the position of the O-acetyl group to C-9. The reported 1H chemical shifts are referenced with respect to the methyl group of acetone appearing at 2.225 ppm. To address whether there was postenzymatic migration of the O-acetyl group on the glycerol side chain, the acetylation of NeuAcα-2,8-NeuAcα-2,3-Galβ-1,4-Glc-FCHASE by MalE-Orf1143446 from C. jejuni was monitored in real time by 1H NMR. This was accomplished by recording successive 1H one-dimensional spectra of the reaction at 2-min intervals over a period of 100 min at 37 °C. The reaction mixture contained 2.5 mm of the substrate, 5 mm acetyl-CoA, and 10 mm MgCl2 in deuterated phosphate buffer (pH = 6.5). The reaction was initiated upon addition of an aliquot of enzyme (8 milliunits). Roughly 5 min elapsed between the addition of the enzyme, and the acquisition of the first time point (defined as t = 0 min). The reaction progress was followed and quantified by integrating the O-acetyl and H9′-resonances, which both gave rise to well resolved peaks. The uncertainty associated with integration measurements is ∼10%. All NMR data were acquired on Varian instruments operating at 500 and 600 MHz, and processed using the software Topspin (Bruker Biospin). Whole-cell Neuraminidase Treatment—C. jejuni cells, harvested from Mueller-Hinton plates, were rinsed twice in phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 5.5) and then resuspended in a buffered solution of neuraminidase (100 milliunits/ml, from Clostridium perfringens, Sigma) and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. The cells were spun down (9000 × g, 2 min), and the supernatant was lyophilized. The presence of NeuAc and 9-O-acetyl-NeuAc was verified by NMR and capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS). For NMR analysis, the cell-free suspension was redissolved in D2O, and standard 1H one-dimensional and carbon-correlated spectra were obtained. The observed chemical shifts correspond with previously published values for these molecules in solution (27Haverkamp J. van Halbeek H. Dorland L. Vliegenthart J.F. Pfeil R. Schauer R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 122: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). For mass spectrometric analysis, CE was performed using a Prince CE system (Prince Technologies, The Netherlands). The CE system was coupled to an API 3000 mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems/Sciex, Concord, Canada) via a microspray interface. A sheath solution (isopropanol-methanol, 2:1) was delivered at a flow rate of 1 μl/min. Separations were obtained on ∼90-cm length of bare fused-silica capillary with a background electrolyte of 30 mm morpholine in deionized water (pH 9.0). A voltage of 30 kV was typically applied at the injection, and –5.0 kV was applied at the capillary outlet as electrospray voltage (negative detection mode). Orf11 of C. jejuni ATCC 43446 Has Sialate O-Acetyltransferase Activity—Based on the gene complement in the LOS biosynthesis locus, C. jejuni strains can be grouped into eight classes (28Parker C.T. Horn S.T. Gilbert M. Miller W.G. Woodward D.L. Mandrell R.E. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2005; 43: 2771-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Class A, B, and C strains are capable of synthesizing sialylated oligosaccharide cores that mimic ganglioside structures (17Gilbert M. Karwaski M.F. Bernatchez S. Young N.M. Taboada E. Michniewicz J. Cunningham A.M. Wakarchuk W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 327-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and are thought to be those responsible for triggering the onset of Guillain-Barré syndrome in humans (24Godschalk P.C. Heikema A.P. Gilbert M. Komagamine T. Ang C.W. Glerum J. Brochu D. Li J. Yuki N. Jacobs B.C. van Belkum A. Endtz H.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 1659-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 29Koga M. Gilbert M. Takahashi M. Li J. Koike S. Hirata K. Yuki N. J. Infect. Dis. 2006; 193: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Strains belonging to classes A and B also possess a gene, originally named orf11, that encodes a protein showing homology with various acetyltransferases of the NodL-LacA-CysE family, although it was not possible to determine its acceptor based on the activity of the homologues. This gene is located immediately downstream of the four genes (cst-II, neuB, neuC, and neuA) involved in sialylation of the LOS outer core, which suggested that Orf11 could be a SOAT. In the biosynthetic pathway of sialoglycans, free forms of sialic acids are CMP-activated prior to their transfer, by sialyltransferases, onto nascent oligosaccharides. Sialic acids could conceivably be targeted for O-acetylation at any of the three stages in the pathway, i.e. either as free NeuAc, after activation as CMP-NeuAc, or after transfer to a glycan. In almost all systems studied to date, the substrates for these enzymes are known to be NeuAc-linked oligosaccharides. However, in group B Streptococcus, sialic acid destined for the capsular polysaccharide are O-acetylated prior to activation (10Lewis A.L. Nizet V. Varki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11123-11128Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and in the Golgi apparatus of mammalian cells there is evidence that CMP-NeuAc may be the substrate for certain SOATs (30Shen Y. Tiralongo J. Iwersen M. Sipos B. Kalthoff H. Schauer R. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Orf11 from C. jejuni ATCC 43446 was expressed as a MalE fusion construct (MalE-Orf11)43446 in E. coli and was purified by affinity chromatography. There was no evidence of O-acetylated product when purified MalE-Orf1143446 was incubated with either NeuAc or CMP-NeuAc as acceptor in the presence of acetyl-CoA (data not shown). We have previously used FCHASE glycosides as synthetic acceptors to confirm the biological role of several glycosyltransferases cloned from bacterial sources (31Gilbert M. Watson D.C. Cunningham A.M. Jennings M.P. Young N.M. Wakarchuk W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28271-28276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 32Gilbert M. Brisson J.R. Karwaski M.F.

FCHASE derivatives were employed to establish that Orf11 from C. jejuni ATCC 43446 catalyzes the transfer of an O-acetyl group to oligosaccharide-bound NeuAc and that it has a strong preference for terminal α2,8-linked residues. Following incubation in the presence of acetyl-CoA, NeuAcα-2,8-NeuAcα-2,3-Galβ-1,4-Glc-FCHASE and (NeuAcα-2,8)2-NeuAcα-2,3-Galβ-1,4-Glc-FCHASE glycosides possessing terminal α2,8-linked NeuAc exhibited more rapid migration rates on a TLC plate as a result of O-acetylation (Fig. 1). The level of conversion to a higher mobility form was barely detectable when NeuAcα-2,3-Galβ-1,4-Glc-FCHASE, possessing a terminal α2,3-linked NeuAc, was used as the acceptor (Fig. 1). The specific activity of the purified MalE-Orf1143446 was 0.4 milliunits/mg with the monosialylated acceptor, 77.8 milliunits/mg with the disialylated acceptor and 17.2 milliunits/mg with the trisialylated acceptor. A recent study with solubilized Golgi membranes from guinea pig liver tissue possessing endogenous SOAT activity reported a similar ability to O-acetylate several compounds, at significantly diminished levels, that were not believed to be the natural substrates of the enzyme (33Iwersen M. Dora H. Kohla G. Gasa S. Schauer R. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 1035-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Sequence Variation of Orf11 in Various C. jejuni Strains—We previously deposited the sequence of the entire LOS biosynthesis locus from 8 class A and B strains of C. jejuni (see legend of Fig. 2 for accession numbers), which all contain a copy of Orf11. The orf11 gene from ATCC 43460 encodes a truncated protein (63 amino acids) because of a frameshift mutation and is thus inactive. Because the translation products from C. jejuni OH4382 and OH4384 are identical, there are six distinct full-length Orf11 variants among the eight class A and B loci that we sequenced. The level of protein sequence identity is high, with 94% of the residues being conserved among the six variants (Fig. 2). To assess how specific amino acid differences affected O-acetyltransferase activity, we cloned and expressed the six Orf11 variants as MalE fusion constructs. We compared the activity of the six variants using NeuAcα-2,3-Galβ-1,4-Glc-FCHASE and NeuAcα-2,8-NeuAcα-2,3-Galβ-1,4-Glc-FCHASE as acceptors, and we analyzed the products by TLC (data not shown). As described earlier, MalE-Orf1143446 had high activity on terminal α-2,8-linked NeuAc and significantly lower activity on α-2,3-linked NeuAc. MalE-Orf1143438 and MalE-Orf1143449 also had high activity on terminal α-2,8-linked NeuAc and significantly lower activity on α-2,3-linked NeuAc. MalE-Orf1143432 had low activity on α-2,8-linked NeuAc and no activity on α-2,3-linked NeuAc. MalE-Orf11OH4382 and MalE-Orf1143456 are both inactive. Single mutations are responsible for the inactivation of these variants because Orf11OH4382 has only one amino acid difference (D75G) with Orf1143446, as does MalE-Orf1143456 with Orf1143449 (E91G) (Fig. 2). We sequenced the orf11 gene from 26 additional clinical strains (see supplemental Table 1) to study the sequence variation in a set larger than the eight strains discussed above. Eight of the clinical strains had orf11 genes that encoded full-length versions, whereas 13 contained the presence of homopolymeric G-tracts, which can lead to the expression of a mixture of truncated and full-length gene products in a culture. For instance the orf11 gene from MF6 has a mixture of 10 and 11-G homopolymeric tracts, which results in the expression of either a full-length protein (276 amino acids) or a truncated one (64 amino acids), respectively. The remaining five C. jejuni strains encode truncated forms of Orf11 as a result of single base deletions or insertions, as well as a G to A substitutions (see supplemental Table 1). The presence of many inactive and phase-variable orf11 alleles in clinical strains suggests that C. jejuni is undergoing selective pressure to modulate the activity of this gene. In a broader context, there is a high level of sequence divergence among proteins known to possess O-acetyltransferase activity. Some, however, exhibit sufficient homology to enable grouping into one of two families. The first, known as the NodL-LacA-CysE family, comprises water-soluble cytoplasmic proteins (34Downie J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 1649-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), whereas the second comprises a group of integral membrane proteins (35Hara O. Hutchinson C.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5141-5144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme we have identified in C. jejuni shows homology with the NodL-LacA-CysE family. Interestingly, a recently published sequence for a SOAT, which is involved in capsule production in N. meningitidis, also shows homology with the water-soluble family of O-acetyltransferases (14Claus H. Borrow R. Achtman M. Morelli G. Kantelberg C. Longworth E. Frosch M. Vogel U. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 227-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The SOAT from C. jejuni HS:19 O-Acetylates Directly at the 9-Position—Sialic acids have been found to be modified with O-acetyl groups at C-4 and at any one of the three hydroxyl groups on the exocyclic side chain (i.e. C-7, C-8, and C-9) (2Schauer R. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 449-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 3Varki A. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). One of the peculiarities associated with O-acetylation to the exocyclic side chain is that this group will migrate spontaneously from the 7- to the 9-position, via the 8-O-acetyl species (36Varki A. Diaz S. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 236-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). 8-O-Acetylated sialic acids are very unstable and exist only transiently, unless the hydroxyl group at C-9 has already been modified or is the linkage site. O-Acetyl migration from the 7- to the 9-position, which has been observed directly in vitro using free forms of modified NeuAc in solution, occurs on a relatively slow time scale under mild solution conditions (t1/2 ≈ 10 h at pH 7,37°C) but is accelerated by raising the solution pH (37Kamerling J.P. Schauer R. Shukla A.K. Stoll S. van Halbeek H. Vliegenthart J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 162: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). There is evidence that some organisms may possess specific enzymes that facilitate O-acetyl migration (38Vandamme-Feldhaus V. Schauer R. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In almost all organisms where 9-O-acetylated sialoglycans have been detected, the de novo enzymatic product has been postulated to be the 7-O-acetylated species, which was converted to the 9-O-acetyl isomer following migration (10Lewis A.L. Nizet V. Varki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11123-11128Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 14Claus H. Borrow R. Achtman M. Morelli G. Kantelberg C. Longworth E. Frosch M.

Chem. 1990; 265: 13091-13103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated, however, that in the Golgi apparatus of mammalian systems, sialylated glycoconjugates are likely O-acetylated at both C-7 and C-9 directly, possibly by different SOATs. The precise acceptor position has been difficult to determine in these studies because of the inability to purify these enzymes. Using the SOAT from C. jejuni ATCC 43446 (MalE-Orf1143446), we synthesized preparative quantities of 9-O-acetyl-NeuAcα-2,8-NeuAcα-2,3-Galβ-1,4-Glc-FCHASE for analysis by NMR spectroscopy. We were able to assign the O-acetyl group to the C-9 position of the terminal NeuAc. This is demonstrated by the downfield shift of the non-equivalent 9-proton resonances on this residue (H9 = 4.21 and H9′ = 4.38 ppm) relative to the analogous pair in the non-acetylated FCHASE glycoside (H9 = 3.64 and H9′ = 3.88 ppm, from (32Gilbert M. Brisson J.R. Karwaski M.F. Michniewicz J. Cunningham A.M. Wu Y. Young N.M. Wakarchuk W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3896-3906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar)). The esterification position was confirmed through the use of HMBC carbon-correlated proton spectra, where we observed a connectivity between the H9 protons and the carbonyl carbon of the acetyl group. Our assignment of the O-acetyl group to the 9-position in the enzymatic product did not rule out the possibility that this isomer was formed postenzymatically, as a result of migration from C-7. To confirm the acceptor position on NeuAcα-2,8-NeuAcα-2,3-Galβ-1,4-Glc-FCHASE, O-acetylation was followed in real time, by acquiring 1H spectra of the reaction mixture continuously at 2-min intervals from the start of the reaction (Fig. 3). Both the O-acetyl and H9′ resonances of the 9-O-acetylated species were well resolved thereby allowing us to unambiguously monitor its formation. Our data clearly establish that MalE-Orf1143446 transfers the O-acetyl group directly to C-9. This is demonstrated by the growth in signal at 4.38 ppm in the earliest time points following the addition of the enzyme (Fig. 3B). This resonance appears as a result of esterification at the 9-position and establishes the creation of the 9-O-acetylated species. In addition, the signal intensity of the nascent O-acetyl group grows at the same rate as H9′ (Fig. 3C). This indicates that the formation of the O-acetyl ester bond, and the downfield shift of the 9-protons occurs in parallel. Our results are incompatible with the possibility that O-acetylation is directed originally to C-7, followed by migration, a process that under similar conditions was determined to have a t1/2 of ∼10 h (37Kamerling J.P. Schauer R. Shukla A.K. Stoll S. van Halbeek H. Vliegenthart J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 162: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). It will be of interest to determine how rare this SOAT is in its ability to O-acetylate the 9-position directly. Characterization of SOATs from other organisms will be required to clarify when and why O-acetylation may be directed to C-7 versus C-9. It seems unlikely that this is a random process, because 7-O-acetyl species exhibit different binding and chemical characteristics than the corresponding 9-O-acetyl forms (42Manzi A.E. Sjoberg E.R. Diaz S. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13091-13103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Kniep B. Claus C. Peter-Katalinic J. Monner D.A. Dippold W. Nimtz M. J. Biol.

It is possible that in cases where C-7 is the target, this isomer may be required for proper processing and transport of the glycoconjugate or for a time-limited physiological response at the cell surface. Detection of LOS-bound O-Acetylated NeuAc in C. jejuni—NeuAc has been found to be incorporated into the LOS of Haemophilus influenzae (44Hood D.W. Makepeace K. Deadman M.E. Rest R.F. Thibault P. Martin A. Richards J.C. Moxon E.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 679-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), Neisseria spp (45Smith H. Parsons N.J. Cole J.A. Microb. Pathog. 1995; 19: 365-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and C. jejuni (21Aspinall G.O. McDonald A.G. Pang H. Kurjanczyk L.A. Penner J.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, there have been no reports of O-acetylated NeuAc in the LOS of any of these organisms. Modified NeuAc, if indeed present, would likely have been missed because of the unique challenges associated with the characterization of the glycan component of the LOS. Conventional spectral techniques designed to accomplish this task invariably require the prior removal of the fatty acyl components. Unfortunately, chemical treatments used to strip the fatty acyl chains from the oligosaccharide have the undesired consequence of cleaving NeuAc residues and/or saponification of O-acetyl modifications. Once the orf11 gene was identified as a SOAT, we sought a method to detect the presence of O-acetyl-NeuAc at the surface of C. jejuni cells. The presence of this modified residue was eventually found by treating whole cells with neuraminidase and analyzing the cell-free suspensions by both 1H NMR and CE-MS. Several strains belonging to type A and B LOS classes were screened (supplemental Table 1). In addition to orf11, class A and B strains possess several genes that are involved in the sialylation of the LOS (17Gilbert M. Karwaski M.F. Bernatchez S. Young N.M. Taboada E. Michniewicz J. Cunningham A.M. Wakarchuk W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 327-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Neuraminidase treatment of 10 strains resulted in the release of NeuAc (Fig. 4A), whereas in 4 others, we detected both NeuAc and 9-O-acetyl-NeuAc (Fig. 4B). A significant proportion of the released sialic acid was the modified species, as demonstrated by the 1:3 ratio of 9-O-acetyl-NeuAc to NeuAc observed in the 1H NMR spectra of the GB17 cell-free suspension (Fig. 4B). Several C. jejuni strains that possess an active orf11 allele do not display 9-O-acetyl-NeuAc, as indicated by the neuraminidase assay. Two principal explanations can account for this. First, the accompanying sialyltransferase gene in the LOS locus, cst-II, will dictate whether a suitable substrate is available to accept the O-acetyl modification. We have previously demonstrated that this sialyltransferase exists as either a monofunctional version (Thr-51) that can transfer α-2,3-linked NeuAc to galactose, or as a bifunctional version (Asn-51) that can transfer both α-2,3-NeuAc to galactose and α-2,8-NeuAc to NeuAc (17Gilbert M. Karwaski M.F. Bernatchez S. Young N.M. Taboada E. Michniewicz J. Cunningham A.M. Wakarchuk W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 327-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). 9-O-Acetyl-NeuAc was only detected in strains that possess a bifunctional Cst-II, i.e. in those capable of synthesizing LOS with terminal α2,8-linked sialic acid. This is in full agreement with our biochemical characterization of this SOAT, which demonstrated that the enzyme has a high specificity for α2,8-linked residues (Fig. 1). Second, SOAT activity in C. jejuni appears to be modulated by the presence of homopolymeric nucleotide tracts in the strains that have the combination of an active orf11 allele and a bifunctional Cst-II (supplemental Table 1). Polymeric G-tracts have been reported in earlier studies of C. jejuni genes involved in LOS biosynthesis (17Gilbert M. Karwaski M.F. Bernatchez S. Young N.M. Taboada E. Michniewicz J. Cunningham A.M. Wakarchuk W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 327-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), and their presence can lead to premature translation termination, resulting in truncated gene products. Many of the orf11 genes that were sequenced have heterogeneous G-tracts that can abolish SOAT activity in strains where active orf11 alleles are present. Our emerging understanding of LOS biosynthesis in C. jejuni, and other bacteria, indicates that the genes involved are found in a highly mutable genetic locus, and there are several mechanisms employed to vary the structure of the LOS outer core (17Gilbert M. Karwaski M.F. Bernatchez S. Young N.M. Taboada E. Michniewicz J. Cunningham A.M. Wakarchuk W.W. J. Biol.

It was noted earlier that among the 34 orf11 genes that were sequenced (8 sequences from previously sequenced LOS loci (Fig. 2) and 26 additional sequences in the supplemental Table 1), we found several instances of point mutations, nucleotide insertions and deletions, and polymeric G-tracts. These accumulated differences within the nucleotide sequence serve to modulate the expression of the SOAT. Coupled with the modulation of the expression of other genes within the LOS locus, such as cst-II, class A and B strains have the potential to synthesize a considerable variety of sialylated oligosaccharides, some of which will be O-acetylated. Conclusions—In most organisms that possess sialylated glycoconjugates, O-acetylation has been found to be a frequent modification (2Schauer R. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 449-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 3Varki A. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). This is true in some pathogenic bacteria, where NeuAc residues residing on the capsule have been shown to exhibit varying levels of O-acetylation (10Lewis A.L. Nizet V. Varki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11123-11128Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 12Orskov F. Orskov I. Sutton A. Schneerson R. Lin W. Egan W. Hoff G.E. Robbins J.B. J. Exp.

Future effort will be geared toward establishing whether this modification is a virulence factor. In this paper, we have described the cloning, purification, and characterization of a soluble SOAT that has high specificity for terminal α2,8-linked sialic acid. This enzyme may serve as a valuable tool for the development of therapeutic agents directed against malignant cell lines overexpressing O-acetylated gangliosides.

https://openalex.org/W2015126942,"We have demonstrated that levels of specific modification in histone H3 are modulated by members of the nucleosome-binding high mobility group N (HMGN) protein family in a variant-specific manner. HMGN1 (but not HMGN2) inhibits the phosphorylation of both H3S10 and H3S28, whereas HMGN2 enhances H3K14 acetylation more robustly than HMGN1. Two HMGN domains are necessary for modulating chromatin modifications, a non-modification-specific domain necessary for chromatin binding and a modification-specific domain localized in the C terminus of the HMGNs. Thus, chromatin-binding structural proteins such as HMGNs affect the levels of specific chromatin modifications and therefore may play a role in epigenetic regulation.

Thus, chromatin-binding structural proteins such as HMGNs affect the levels of specific chromatin modifications and therefore may play a role in epigenetic regulation. Post-translational modifications of core histones in chromatin are important molecular markers of epigenetic regulation and part of the mechanisms that regulate the orderly progression of DNA-related nuclear events, such as transcription, recombination, replication, and repair (1Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7666) Google Scholar, 2Berger S.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar, 3Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6623) Google Scholar). The levels and patterns of histone modification in chromatin are not fixed; they are in a constant state of flux and are the result of an equilibrium established by the activities of enzymes that continuously add, and those that continuously remove, chemical groups from histones. Among the best-studied examples are the changes in the levels of acetylation and phosphorylation in the tail of histone H3. The former reflects alterations in the equilibrium of the action of histone acetyl-transferases and deacetylases (4Kuo M.H. Allis C.D. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 615-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar, 5Kadosh D. Struhl K. Cell. 1997; 89: 365-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), whereas the latter is dependent on the opposing activities of kinases and phosphatases that access and modify specific residues in the tails of the nucleosomal histones (6Nowak S.J.

These and studies with histone H1 (10Fan Y. Nikitina T. Zhao J. Fleury T.J. Bhattacharyya R. Bouhassira E.E. Stein A. Woodcock C.L. Skoultchi A.I.

Biol. 2000; 20: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) suggest that the levels of chromatin modifications are determined, not only by the opposing activities of the enzymes that continuously modify and demodify histones, but also by architectural chromatin-binding proteins that alter the ability of these enzymes to access and modify their nucleosomal targets. Significantly, the interaction of HMGN1 with nucleosomes reduced the levels of phosphorylation but enhanced the levels of acetylation, suggesting specificity in the effects of HMGN1 on chromatin modifications. HMGN is a family of proteins that binds specifically to the 147-bp nucleosome core particle, i.e. the building block of chromatin, and alters the structure and activity of the chromatin fiber. The major members of this protein family, HMGN1 and HMGN2, are present in most vertebrate cells, have very similar structures, bind to nucleosomes with similar affinities, and produce identical footprints on nucleosomal DNA (12Bustin M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 431-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 13Bustin M. Trieschmann L. Postnikov Y.V. Semin. Cell Biol. 1995; 6: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Yet, both in vivo and in vitro, they bind to nucleosomes specifically and form HMGN-specific homodimeric complexes containing either two molecules of HMGN1 or two molecules of HMGN2; heterodimeric nucleosome complexes containing one molecule of HMGN1 and one of HMGN2 are not formed (14Postnikov Y.V. Trieschmann L Rickers A. Bustin M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Because HMGN1 modulates the levels of chromatin modifications only when bound to nucleosomes, it is possible that the HMGN-specific nucleosome binding modes will lead to specific effects on chromatin modifications. Here we tested whether modification in the tail of H3 is modulated in an HMGN-specific manner. We found that HMGN1 and HMGN2 affect differently the MSK1-mediated phosphorylation of H3S10 and H3S28 and the PCAF-mediated acetylation of H3K14. Using a battery of HMGN domain swap mutants, we identified the protein domains regulating the levels of these histone modifications. These findings demonstrate that structural proteins that interact with chromatin without any obvious specificity for the DNA sequence may have specific effects on the levels of chromatin modifications. As such, HMGN and similar chromatin-binding structural proteins may play a role in epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. Preparation of Nucleosomes and Proteins and Construction of Domain Swap Mutant cDNAs—Nucleosome core particles were prepared from chicken red blood cells (15Ausio J. Dong F. van Holde K.E. J. Mol.

Catez F. Birger Y. Postnikov Y.V. Bustin M. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 375: 323-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The cDNAs, which encode domain swap mutants of HMGN proteins (see Fig. 2), were created by overlap extension PCR (17Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R.

To test for HMGN specificity in the modulation of H3 modification levels, we measured the ability of the H3 kinase MSK1 and the acetyltransferase PCAF to modify nucleosomal H3 in the presence of various amounts of either HMGN1 or HMGN2. MSK1 phosphorylates H3S10 and H3S28 (19Soloaga A. Thomson S. Wiggin G.R. Rampersaud N. Dyson M.H. Hazzalin C.A. Mahadevan L.C. Arthur J.S.

We have also reported that MSK1 phosphorylates two conserved serines in the HMGN proteins (8Lim J.H. Catez F. Birger Y. West K.L. Prymakowska-Bosak M. Postnikov Y.V. Bustin M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 573-584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and that PCAF acetylates lysine 2 in HMGN2 but not in HMGN1 (11Herrera J.E. West K.L. Schiltz R.L. Nakatani Y. Bustin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These modifications can also be seen in Fig. 1. Surprisingly, although HMGN1 inhibits histone H3 phosphorylation by MSK1 (Fig. 1A, lanes 3-6 and Fig. 1B, open circles), the closely related homologue HMGN2, which binds to the nucleosome core particle with the same affinity as HMGN1 (Fig. 2), does not inhibit the phosphorylation of histone H3 by MSK1 (Fig. 1, A and B). Western blots indicate that HMGN1 inhibits the phosphorylation of both H3S10 and H3S28, the two MSK1 targets of histone H3, whereas HMGN2 does not effect the phosphorylation of either (Figs. 1C and Fig. 3). The inhibition of the phosphorylation of nucleosomal H3 by HMGN1 is dependent on its nucleosome binding; HMGN1 mutants that do not bind to chromatin do not inhibit this phosphorylation (8Lim J.H. Catez F. Birger Y. West K.L. Prymakowska-Bosak M. Postnikov Y.V. Bustin M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 573-584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Because HMGN1 and HMGN2 bind to nucleosomes with similar affinity (Fig. 2A, right column), these results indicate a HMGN variant-specific effect on histone H3 phosphorylation. HMGN variant-specific effects were also observed by analysis of the PCAF-mediated acetylation of nucleosomal H3K14. Thus, although HMGN1 enhances the acetylation of histone H3 <2-fold, (Fig. 1D; E, open circles), HMGN2 has a significantly stronger effect and enhances the acetylation levels almost 3.5-fold (Fig. 1D, lanes 7-10; E, closed triangles). These results reveal HMGN-type specificity in the modulation of both the phosphorylation and acetylation of histone H3 in nucleosomes. The differences between HMGN1 and HMGN2 in modulating histone modification is unexpected, because the structure and biochemical properties of these two proteins are very similar (12Bustin M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 431-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 22Alfonso P.J. Crippa M.P. Hayes J.J. Bustin M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To further verify that the two proteins indeed have distinct effects on histone modifications, we examined whether their ability to modulate histone modification levels localizes to specific HMGN protein domains. All HMGNs contain four major domains (12Bustin M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 431-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar); two domains marked as NLS1 and NLS2 (Fig. 2A) contain nuclear localization signals, a nucleosome binding domain (Fig. 2A, NBD), and a chromatin unfolding domain (Fig. 2A, CHUD). To identify the region of HMGN1 that is responsible for the inhibition of histone H3 phosphorylation or enhancement of H3 acetylation, we generated a series of domain swap mutants between HMGN1 and HMGN2 (Fig. 2A). All of the swap mutants were expressed in bacteria and purified to homogeneity (Fig. 2B). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (Fig. 2C) and Kd calculations (Fig. 2A) indicate that all of the swap mutants bound to nucleosomes with affinities similar to those of the native proteins. To test whether a specific domain in HMGN1 is mainly responsible for the inhibition of the MSK1-dependent phosphorylation of histone H3, we first tested the inhibitory activity of the swap mutants HMGN2-N1NBD, in which the NBD of HMGN2 (residues 17-46 of HMGN2) is replaced by the NBD of HMGN1 (residues 13-41 of HMGN1), and of HMGN2-N1C, in which the entire HMGN2 C terminus was replaced by domains NLS2 and CHUD of HMGN1. We found that HMGN2-N1NBD does not inhibit the phosphorylation of either H3S10 or H3S28, whereas HMGN2-N1C inhibits the phosphorylation of both H3S10 and H3S28 to the same degree as native HMGN1 (Fig. 3A, lanes 1-10). Thus, the inhibitory activity localizes to the C-terminal portion of HMGN1. The swap mutant HMGN2-N1NLS2, in which the NLS2 region of HMGN1 replaces that of HMGN2, inhibits the phosphorylation of both H3S10 and H3S28, whereas the swap mutant HMGN2-N1CHUD, which contains only the CHUD region of HMGN1, does not (Fig. 3A, lanes 11-15). Thus, the MSK1-inhibitory activity localizes to the NLS2 domain of HMGN1. Indeed, the deletion mutant HMGN1-Cdel26, which lacks the CHUD domain but contains the NLS2 domain, did inhibit the phosphorylation of both H3S10 and H3S28, whereas the deletion mutant HMGN1-Cdel55, which lacks 55 amino acid residues from the C terminus of HMGN1 and does not contain the NLS2 domain, did not. (Fig. 3A, lanes 16-20). Taken together, the results indicate that the specific inhibitory action of HMGN1 on the phosphorylation of S10 and S28 in the N terminus of H3 resides in the NLS2 region of the protein. The swap mutants described above were also used to identify the HMGN2 region involved in the enhancement of the PCAF-mediated H3 acetylation. We found that HMGN2-N1NBD enhances the H3 acetylation to the same extent as native HMGN2, whereas HMGN2-N1C enhances acetylation significantly less, to the same degree as native HMGN1(Fig. 3B, lanes 1-10). Thus, the C-terminal domain of HMGN2 contains the acetylation-enhancing activity. HMGN2-N1NLS2, which contains the CHUD domain of HMGN2, enhances acetylation, whereas HMGN2-N1CHUD, which contains the NLS2 of HMGN2 and the CHUD of HMGN1, did not enhance acetylation (Fig. 3B Lanes 11-16). Thus, the CHUD domain of HMGN2 is the main HMGN domain specifically involved in enhancing the PCAF-mediated H3 acetylation; the effect of HMGN1 is significantly smaller. Our major finding is that the levels of specific post-translational modifications in the N terminus of histone H3 are differentially regulated by two closely related proteins, HMGN1 and HMGN2. HMGN modulate chromatin modifications only when bound to chromatin; however, the modulating activity of the proteins localize to specific domains that are distinct from the domain necessary for chromatin binding. The HMGN specificity in modulating distinct modifications in the tail of H3 establishes the principle that structural chromatin-binding proteins modulate the levels of chromatin modifications and therefore may play a role in epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. In considering the molecular mechanisms whereby HMGN proteins affect the acetylation and phosphorylation of H3, we first note that the effects require direct interaction of the proteins with nucleosomes. We have already demonstrated that HMGN point mutants that do not bind to nucleosomes do not affect the levels of H3 modification either in vitro or in vivo (8Lim J.H. Catez F. Birger Y. West K.L. Prymakowska-Bosak M. Postnikov Y.V. Bustin M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 573-584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 9Lim J.H. West K.L. Rubinstein Y. Bergel M. Postnikov Y.V. Bustin M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3038-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Likewise, we have demonstrated that HMGN1 does not affect the modification of free, non-nucleosomal histones. One possible explanation for the inhibitory effects of HMGN1 on MSK1-mediated phosphorylation is that the binding of the entire molecule to the nucleosomes hinders the ability of the kinase to reach its target. This possibility is not compatible with the domain swap mutants. First, neither the mutant HMGN2-N1NBD nor the mutant HMGN1-Cdel55, both of which contain the HMGN1 nucleosome binding domain, inhibit phosphorylation of H3, which is proof that the binding itself is not the main cause for inhibition. Second, although HMGN1 and HMGN2 generate very similar nucleosomal DNA footprints, only HMGN1 inhibits phosphorylation, additional proof that the inhibition is not simply due to the binding of the protein to chromatin. Finally, the studies with additional mutants localizes the inhibitory effect to the NLS2 domain of HMGN1, indicating that only a specific region of the protein is responsible for specifically inhibiting the ability of MSK1 to phosphorylate nucleosomal H3. Significantly, the NLS2 domain is not a general, nonspecific inhibitory domain. It does not affect the PCAF-mediated acetylation of H3K14, located only four amino acids away from H3S10. The net charge of the NLS2 domain of HMGN1 is similar to that of HMGN2; however, the amino acid sequence is significantly different. When inserted into HMGN2 protein, this sequence inhibits phosphorylation. Thus, the sequence of the NLS2 region of HMGN1 functions as an MSK1 inhibitory domain. These considerations are also relevant to understanding the main HMGN2 determinants that enhance the PCAF-mediated acetylation of H3K14. The difference in the amino acid sequence of the CHUD domains of HMGN1 and HMGN2 may be the underlying reason for their different acetylation-promoting activities. Our findings that the NLS2 domain of HMGN1 inhibits phosphorylation and that the CHUD domain of HMGN2 enhances the PCAF-mediated acetylation of H3 are strong evidence that HMGN proteins affect post-translational modifications at the local, nucleosome levels. Thus, the effect of HMGNs is not simply due to either the steric hindrance that inhibits the ability of a modifying enzyme to reach its target nor to their known “chromatin unfolding” activity that may enhance the ability of modifiers to reach their target. Taken together, these results indicate that two domains of HMGN are involved in regulating chromatin modifications. First, the NBD domain is necessary for chromatin interaction; modifications in this domain that abolish chromatin binding also abolish the ability of the proteins to modulate chromatin modification. With respect to the modification affected, the NBD domain acts as a nonspecific module in that it will affect all chromatin modifications that are modulated by HMGNs. The second domain is located in the C-terminal region of the proteins. Within this region, we have identified subdomains that either up-regulate or down-regulate the levels of specific modifications. Thus, the domains in the C terminus can be considered as modification-specific domains. We suggest that, once the HMGN protein is bound to nucleosomes, domains in the C terminus interact with the tails of histone and induce steric changes that alter the ability of modifying enzymes to modify their targets. This possibility is supported by the observation that these proteins form HMGN variant-specific complexes with nucleosomes. We have already suggested that, upon binding, HMGNs induce allosteric transitions in the nucleosomes, which favor the formation of homodimeric HMGN complexes (14Postnikov Y.V. Trieschmann L Rickers A. Bustin M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). HMGNs affect, not only the phosphorylation of H3S10 and H3S28 and the acetylation of H3K14, but also H3K4 methylation, H3K9 acetylation, H3K9 methylation (8Lim J.H. Catez F. Birger Y. West K.L. Prymakowska-Bosak M. Postnikov Y.V. Bustin M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 573-584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and modifications in H2A. 3Y. V. Postnikov and M. Bustin, unpublished data. Thus, the interaction of HMGN with chromatin may affect the levels of several types of modifications in the tail of the core histones. Our findings that HMGN1 and HMGN2 have differential effects on the phosphorylation and the acetylation of histone H3 are the first observations describing functional differences between HMGN1 and HMGN2 proteins. Together with our previous findings (8Lim J.H. Catez F. Birger Y. West K.L. Prymakowska-Bosak M. Postnikov Y.V. Bustin M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 573-584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 9Lim J.H. West K.L. Rubinstein Y. Bergel M. Postnikov Y.V. Bustin M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3038-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), they reinforce and expand the notion that HMGN proteins are part of the mechanisms that regulate the dynamics of histone modifications on chromatin. In living cells, HMGN functions within a network of chromatin-binding proteins, such as H1, HMGB, and HMGA, which compete for nucleosomal binding sites (23Catez F. Yang H. Tracey K.J. Reeves R. Misteli T. Bustin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4321-4328Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). As demonstrated for H1 (10Fan Y. Nikitina T. Zhao J. Fleury T.J. Bhattacharyya R.

Bustin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), it is likely that other structural chromatin-binding proteins will also affect the levels of histone modifications by mechanisms similar to those described here. Therefore, we suggest that the histone modification pattern in chromatin is determined, not only by the equilibrium between the enzymatic activities that modify and demodify the histones, but also by the dynamic and competitive binding of structural chromatin proteins.

Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 8 (Erk8) is a large MAP kinase whose activity is controlled by serum and the c-Src non-receptor tyrosine kinase. Here, we show that RET/PTC3, an activated form of the RET proto-oncogene, was able to activate Erk8, and we demonstrate that such MAP kinase participated in RET/PTC3-dependent stimulation of the c-jun promoter. By using RET/PTC3 molecules mutated in specific tyrosine autophosphorylation sites, we characterized Tyr981, a known binding site for c-Src, as a major determinant of RET/PTC3-induced Erk8 activation, although, surprisingly, the underlying mechanism did not strictly depend on the activity of Src. In contrast, we present evidence that RET/PTC3 acts on Erk8 through Tyr981-mediated activation of c-Abl. Furthermore, we localized the region responsible for the modulation of Erk8 activity by the RET/PTC3 and Abl oncogenes in the Erk8 C-terminal domain. Altogether, these results support a role for Erk8 as a novel effector of RET/PTC3 and, therefore, RET biological functions.

Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar). They coordinate signaling from a variety of extracellular and intracellular stimuli by acting as components of modular systems that involve other kinases and regulatory proteins. These stimuli induce specific phosphorylation on a conserved Thr-Xaa-Tyr motif present in all MAP kinases, thereby inducing their activation. Consequently, these proteins transmit the signals to a vast array of cellular regulatory proteins including protein kinases, transcription factors, cytoskeletal proteins, and other enzymes (1Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar). Erk8 is the last identified member of the MAP kinase family of proteins (2Abe M.K. Saelzler M.P. Espinosa R. II I Kahle K.T. Hershenson M.B. Le Beau M.M. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16733-16743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Expressed in humans at high levels in the brain, kidney, and lung, its activity can be modulated by serum and c-Src (2Abe M.K. Saelzler M.P. Espinosa R. II I Kahle K.T. Hershenson M.B. Le Beau M.M. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16733-16743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although possessing a very typical MAP kinase domain, Erk8 also presents a peculiarly long C-terminal domain containing two putative SH3-binding sites (2Abe M.K. Saelzler M.P. Espinosa R. II I Kahle K.T. Hershenson M.B. Le Beau M.M. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16733-16743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Information concerning its upstream activators, downstream effectors, and cellular functions is still extremely limited. RET is a typical trans-membrane receptor tyrosine-kinase, essential for the development of the sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric nervous system and of the kidney (3Schuchardt A. D'Agati V. Larsson-Blomberg L. Costantini F. Pachnis V. Nature. 1994; 367: 380-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). In complex with four glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored coreceptors, GFR-α 1-4, the RET protein binds growth factors of the glial-derived neurotrophic factor family, mediating their intracellular signaling (4Airaksinen M.S. Saarma M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar). As for other receptor tyrosine-kinases, ligand interaction triggers autophosphorylation of different RET intracellular tyrosine residues that work as docking sites for several adaptor and effector signaling molecules (5Santoro M. Melillo R.M. Carlomagno F. Vecchio G. Fusco A. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 5448-5451Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Among such tyrosines, although Tyr981 is a binding site for c-Src, Tyr1062 has been shown to mediate the interactions with most of RET effectors and to be responsible for activation of the Ras/Erk, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt, Jnk, p38, and Erk5 signaling pathways (6Kurokawa K. Kawai K. Hashimoto M. Ito Y. Takahashi M. J. Intern. Med. 2003; 253: 627-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Finally, Tyr1015 is a recognized docking site for phospholipase C γ (7Borrello M.G. Alberti L. Arighi E. Bongarzone I. Battistini C. Bardelli A. Pasini B. Piutti C. Rizzetti M.G. Mondellini P. Radice M.T. Pierotti M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2151-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gain-of-function mutations of RET have been repeatedly described in several human tumors (8Pasini B. Ceccherini I. Romeo G. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 138-144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). RET germline point mutations are in fact responsible for the three clinical subtypes of the multiple endocrine neoplasias type 2 (MEN2) syndrome, MEN2A, MEN2B, and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (5Santoro M. Melillo R.M. Carlomagno F. Vecchio G. Fusco A. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 5448-5451Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In addition, fusion of the intracellular kinase domain of RET with heterologous genes, caused by chromosomal inversions or translocations, generates the RET/PTC oncogenes, which represent the genetic hallmark of papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC), accounting for more than 80-90% of all thyroid carcinomas (9Sherman S.I. Lancet. 2003; 361: 501-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). Among the at least 10 different RET/PTC rearrangements, RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3, generated by the fusion with the H4 and RFG genes, respectively, are the most common types, accounting for more than 90% of all rearrangements (10Nikiforov Y.E. Endocr. Pathol. 2002; 13: 3-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies—As primary antibodies, we used rabbit polyclonal antisera to Erk2 (C-14) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-MAPK (p42/p44) (Cell Signaling), RET and phospho-RET (phospho-Tyr905) (11Carlomagno F. Guida T. Anaganti S. Vecchio G. Fusco A. Ryan A.J. Billaud M. Santoro M. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 6056-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), and mouse monoclonal antibodies to enhanced green fluorescent protein, AU5, and HA epitopes (Berkeley Antibody Company), Src (Ab-1; Oncogene Science), c-Abl (Pharmingen), and phospho-tyrosine, PY (Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Upstate Biotechnology). Expression Vectors—The expression vectors pCEFLP-SrcYF (constitutively active) and pCEFLP-SrcYF KM (dominant negative) were obtained by subcloning the corresponding cDNA obtained from pSM-SrcYF and pSM-SrcYF KM, kindly provided by H. Varmus (12Chiariello M. Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 580-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).

The HA-tagged forms of Erk8 deletion mutants (1-504; 1-486; 1-386; 1-373) were generated by cloning the corresponding cDNAs, obtained by PCR amplification, in the pCEFL-HA vector. The expression vector for the dominant negative Erk8 KR molecule was also provided by M. Abe (2Abe M.K. Saelzler M.P. Espinosa R. II I Kahle K.T. Hershenson M.B. Le Beau M.M. Rosner M.R. J. Biol.

To generate the pCEFL-HA-Erk8δ expression vector, we amplified by PCR the corresponding cDNA using an “expressed sequence tag” obtained from ResGen (Clone ID 5742965). These sequence data have been submitted to the GenBank™ data base under accession number AY994058. pCDNA3-RET/PTC3 and pBABE-RET/MEN2B expression plasmid have been described previously (13Carlomagno F.

The RET/PTC3Y981, RET/PTC3Y1015, RET/PTC3Y1062, RET/PTC3 Kindead, and RET/PTC3V804 expression plasmid were generated by the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), using pCDNA3-PTC3 as a template. Expression vectors for the activated form of c-Abl (Abl Act) and Bcr/Abl p210 (Bcr/Abl) have been described previously (15Lobo V. Luquero C.I.A. Alvarez-Vallina L. Tipping A.J. Viniegra J.G.

The dominant negative c-Abl (Abl-KD) expression vector was obtained by mutating a critical lysine in the kinase domain of c-Abl, contained in the pCEFL-AU5 vector. The c-myc and c-jun promoter reporter plasmids, pMyc-Luc and pJLuc, respectively, and the pCDNAIII-β-galactosidase expression vector have been described previously (12Chiariello M. Marinissen M.J.

Biol. 2000; 20: 1747-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The identity and integrity of the different clones were confirmed by dideoxy DNA sequencing. For each plasmid, additional information will be provided upon request. Western Blot Analysis—Lysates of total cellular proteins or immunoprecipitates were analyzed by protein immunoblotting after SDS-PAGE with specific rabbit antisera or mouse monoclonal antibodies. Immunocomplexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (ECL or ECL Plus, Amersham Biosciences) with the use of goat antiserum to rabbit or mouse immunoglobulin G, coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences). Reagents—The PP1 inhibitor was purchased from BIOMOL. PDGF was purchased from Serologicals Corp. Cell Culture and Transfections—293T, Cal62, Kat4, and ARO cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf bovine serum (BioWhittaker), 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). Rat Pc cells were maintained in Coon's modified Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 5% calf serum and a mixture of six hormones, including 10 milliunits/ml thyrotropin, 10 nm hydrocortisone, 10 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml apo-transferrin, 10 ng/ml somatostatin, and 10 ng/ml glycyl-histidyl-lysin (Sigma). 293T and NIH 3T3 cells were transfected by the Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen), whereas ARO cells were transfected by the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen), respectively, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. For transfections, 200 ng of HA-Erk8 and HA-Erk8δ and 100 ng of SrcYF, Abl Act, Bcr/Abl, and of the different Ptc3 expression vectors were always used. Reporter Gene Assays—NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with different expression plasmids together with 100 ng of the pMyc Luc reporter plasmid. ARO cells were transfected with different expression plasmids together with 20 ng of the pJLuc reporter plasmid. After a 24-h incubation in serum-free medium, the cells were lysed using reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity present in cellular lysates was assayed using d-luciferin and ATP as substrates, and light emission was quantitated using the 20n/20n luminometer as specified by the manufacturer (Turner BioSystems). RNA Extraction, RT-PCR, and Quantitative Real-time PCR—Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and subjected to on-column DNase digestion with the RNase-free DNase set (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The quality of RNA was verified by electrophoresis through 1% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide. We synthesized random-primed first-strand cDNA in a 50-μl reaction volume starting from 2 μg of RNA using the Gene-Amp RNA PCR core kit (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative (real-time) reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCRs) were performed by using the SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) in the iCycler apparatus (Bio-Rad). Amplification reactions (25-μl final reaction volume) contained 200 nm of each primer, 3 mm MgCl2, 300 μm deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), 1× SYBR Green PCR buffer (Applied Biosystems), 0.1 units/μl AmpliTaq Gold DNA Polymerase (Applied Biosystems), 0.01 units/μl Amp Erase (Applied Biosystems), RNase-free water, and 2 μl of cDNA samples. Thermal cycling conditions were optimized standard conditions and are available upon request. To verify the absence of nonspecific products, we performed 80 cycles of melting (55 °C for 10 s). The melting curve confirmed that a single product was generated. Amplification was monitored by measuring the increase in fluorescence caused by the binding of SYBR Green to double-stranded DNA. Primers were synthesized by MWG Biotech. Nucleotide sequences of the primers used in this study were as follows: qErk8Forw, 5′-GGAGTTTGGGGACCATCC-3′, and qErk8Rev, 5′-GCGTTCAGGTCAGTGTCC-3′. Src in Vitro Kinase Assay—Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.2 mg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin. Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min and immunoprecipitated by incubating 1 mg of total proteins with anti-Src antibodies for 60 min at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were recovered by incubation with protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) on a rotating platform at 4 °C for 60 min. After three washes with lysis buffer, the immunoprecipitates were washed with kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH = 7.0), 5 mm MgCl2) and resuspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer, 10 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP (>10,000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences), and 10 mm cold ATP. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, the beads were washed twice with lysis buffer, and the reaction was terminated by adding an equal volume of SDS-gel loading buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH = 6.8), 2% SDS, 5% glycerol, 0.7 m 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.25% bromphenol blue). When indicated, 5 mg of acid-denatured enolase were added to the reaction (Roche Applied Science). The samples were electrophoresed on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel. After the run, gels were incubated three times for 30 min in a fixing solution (20% methanol, 10% acetic acid), dried, and processed for auto-radiography with phosphor screens. Laser densitometry was used to quantitate Src kinase activity. Erk8 Is Activated by a RET-dependent Signaling Pathway—We performed an in silico analysis of Erk8 gene expression in mouse tissues through the public Mouse Gene Prediction Database resource (18Zhang W. Morris Q.D. Chang R. Shai O. Bakowski M.A. Mitsakakis N. Mohammad N. Robinson M.D. Zirngibl R. Somogyi E. Laurin N. Eftekharpour E. Sat E. Grigull J. Pan Q. Peng W.T. Krogan N. Greenblatt J. Fehlings M. van der Kooy D. Aubin J. Bruneau B.G. Rossant J. Blencowe B.J. Frey B.J. Hughes T.R. J. Biol. (Bronx N. Y.). 2004; 3: 21Google Scholar). Among other tissues, the mouse orthologue Erk8 gene was expressed at very high levels in the thyroid. To verify Erk8 expression also in human thyroid-derived cell lines, we next performed qRT-PCR in three human anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cell lines, ARO, Cal62, and Kat4. qRT-PCR evidenced high expression of Erk8 in the three human cell lines tested, whereas as a control, the human-specific primers did not detect any signal in a rat papillary thyroid carcinoma cell line, Pc (Fig. 1A). These data therefore suggest a role for Erk8 in signaling pathways involved in the homeostasis and/or pathology of the thyroid. As RET/PTC oncogenes are frequently involved in human papillary thyroid carcinomas (5Santoro M. Melillo R.M. Carlomagno F. Vecchio G. Fusco A. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 5448-5451Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), we decided to investigate their ability to modulate Erk8 activation. In particular, we investigated the role of RET/PTC3, a chimeric oncogene generated by the fusion of RET with the RFG gene (Fig. 1B) (19Santoro M. Dathan N.A. Berlingieri M.T. Bongarzone I. Paulin C. Grieco M. Pierotti M.A. Vecchio G. Fusco A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 509-516PubMed Google Scholar). As an approach to score Erk8 activation, we used an anti-phospho-MAPK (Erk2) antibody that recognizes phosphorylation in the conserved MAP kinase TEY motif. We performed Western blot analysis of 293T cells transfected with an HA epitope-tagged form of the Erk8 kinase, as described previously by Abe et al. (2Abe M.K. Saelzler M.P. Espinosa R. II I Kahle K.T. Hershenson M.B. Le Beau M.M. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16733-16743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and then distinguished the transfected HA-Erk8 and the endogenous Erk2 by their different molecular masses, ∼60 and ∼45 kDa, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1C, RET/PTC3 overexpression readily induced Erk8 activation at a level comparable with an activated form of c-Src (Src YF), used as a positive control (2Abe M.K. Saelzler M.P. Espinosa R. II I Kahle K.T. Hershenson M.B. Le Beau M.M. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16733-16743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Of note, no signal in the ∼60-kDa range was detected in the absence of HA-Erk8 transfection (Fig. 1C), indicating that the anti-phospho-MAPK antisera specifically recognized the Erk8 protein. As an additional control for the activity of RET/PTC3 and Src YF, both proteins activated the Erk2 MAP kinase (Fig. 1C), also scored by anti-phospho-MAPK Western blot. As the RET/PTC3 oncogene is generated by the fusion of RET with the RFG gene, we next wanted to address the specific contribution of RET to the activation of the Erk8 protein. To this aim, we used a different RET-derived oncogene, RET/MEN2B, representing a specific point mutant of the intracellular RET domain (5Santoro M. Melillo R.M. Carlomagno F. Vecchio G. Fusco A. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 5448-5451Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), therefore lacking the RFG component present in the RET/PTC3 chimeric protein. As shown in Fig. 1D, increasing amounts of the RET/MEN2B protein also induced Erk8 activation, therefore suggesting a specific role for the RET intracellular tyrosine kinase domain in the activation of this MAP kinase. Altogether, these results indicate that activated forms of the RET protooncogene stimulate Erk8 activity. A Kinase-defective Mutant for Erk8 Interferes with RET/PTC3 Signaling—The expression of the c-jun proto-oncogene is rapidly and transiently induced by different growth factors and cellular oncogenes (20Marinissen M.J. Chiariello M. Pallante M. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4289-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Among them, an oncogenic rearrangement of the RET proto-oncogene is able to strongly induce c-jun expression (21Ishizaka Y. Takahashi M. Ushijima T. Sugimura T. Nagao M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 1331-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), therefore establishing this gene as part of the RET signaling pathway. To investigate whether the RET/PTC3 oncogene was able to stimulate the activity of the c-jun promoter, we took advantage of the availability of a reporter plasmid carrying the luciferase gene under the control of the c-jun promoter, pJLuc (17Chiariello M. Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1747-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 20Marinissen M.J. Chiariello M. Pallante M. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4289-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). A variety of thyroid cell lines have been used as model systems to examine RET biological functions. Among them, human anaplastic thyroid carcinoma ARO cells have the advantage to be readily transfectable and to express endogenous Erk8 (Fig. 1A). Cotransfection of thyroid ARO cells with the pJLuc reporter plasmid and increasing concentrations of the RET/PTC3 cDNA revealed that this oncogene could strongly induce the activity of the c-jun promoter (Fig. 2A). To evaluate whether Erk8 activation is involved in RET/PTC3 signaling to the c-jun promoter, we next used a dominant negative, kinase defective (data not shown) Erk8 molecule, Erk8 KR. For these experiments, we therefore cotransfected RET/PTC3 with the c-jun reporter plasmid and increasing amounts of the Erk8 KR expression vector. As shown in Fig. 2B, the dominant negative Erk8 molecule caused a strong, although incomplete, inhibition of RET/PTC3-dependent c-jun promoter stimulation, suggesting the existence of both Erk8-dependent and Erk8-independent pathways linking RET/PTC3 to the expression of the c-jun proto-oncogene. Tyrosine 981 of RET/PTC3 Is Necessary for Erk8 Activation—Tyrosine phosphorylated residues in the kinase domain of RET, as well as of its derivative oncogenes, usually represent docking sites for adaptor proteins and enzymes that are able to propagate the signal to the intracellular environment (5Santoro M. Melillo R.M. Carlomagno F. Vecchio G. Fusco A. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 5448-5451Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We therefore used RET/PTC3 molecules in which different tyrosine phosphorylation sites have been inactivated by mutating them to phenylalanines to ascertain the dependence of RET/PTC3-induced Erk8 activation on the presence of these specific residues. Also, as these tyrosines have already been linked to the activation of different specific signaling pathways (5Santoro M. Melillo R.M. Carlomagno F. Vecchio G. Fusco A. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 5448-5451Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), this approach could grant us the possibility to suggest the participation of some of these effectors in the modulation of Erk8 activity. In particular, tyrosine 981 binds c-Src (22Encinas M. Crowder R.J. Milbrandt J. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18262-18269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), tyrosine 1015 is a docking site for phospholipase C γ (7Borrello M.G. Alberti L. Arighi E. Bongarzone I. Battistini C. Bardelli A. Pasini B. Piutti C. Rizzetti M.G. Mondellini P. Radice M.T. Pierotti M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2151-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and tyrosine 1062 is a multiple docking site that mediates most of the RET signaling pathways (6Kurokawa K. Kawai K. Hashimoto M. Ito Y. Takahashi M. J. Intern. Med. 2003; 253: 627-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), including Erk2 activation (23Chiariello M. Visconti R. Carlomagno F. Melillo R.M. Bucci C. de Franciscis V. Fox G.M. Jing S. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Fusco A. Santoro M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2435-2445Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). 293T cells were transiently transfected with the HA-Erk8 molecule, together with RET/PTC3, RET/PTC3Y981, RET/PTC3Y1015, or RET/PTC3Y1062, respectively (numbers indicating RET/PTC3 tyrosine residues correspond to their position in the wild-type RET receptor). Surprisingly, based on the observation that tyrosine 1062 mediates most of the RET signaling pathways (6Kurokawa K. Kawai K. Hashimoto M. Ito Y. Takahashi M. J. Intern. Med. 2003; 253: 627-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the RET/PTC3Y1062 mutant activated Erk8 at an extent comparable with the RET/PTC3 molecule, whereas as expected (23Chiariello M. Visconti R. Carlomagno F. Melillo R.M. Bucci C. de Franciscis V. Fox G.M. Jing S. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Fusco A. Santoro M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2435-2445Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), this mutation strongly affected Erk2 activation (Fig. 3). The tyrosine 1015 mutation, involving a known binding site for phospholipase C γ (7Borrello M.G. Alberti L. Arighi E. Bongarzone I. Battistini C. Bardelli A. Pasini B. Piutti C. Rizzetti M.G. Mondellini P. Radice M.T. Pierotti M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2151-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), also did not affect Erk8 activation by RET/PTC3 (Fig. 3). Conversely, tyrosine 981 mutation determined a dramatic reduction in RET/PTC3-dependent Erk8 activation, although such mutation proved irrelevant to Erk2 activation (Fig. 3). As a control, RET/PTC3 Kindead, a kinase-inactive form of RET/PTC3 containing a mutation in the ATP-binding catalytic lysine (Lys758), was unable to activate both Erk8 and Erk2 (Fig. 3). These results therefore imply tyrosine 981 of RET/PTC3 as a major site recognized by signaling molecules mediating RET/PTC3-dependent Erk8 activation. In addition, as tyrosine 981 has been previously recognized as a key residue for the binding of c-Src to RET (22Encinas M. Crowder R.J. Milbrandt J. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18262-18269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), they also suggest a role for c-Src in mediating RET/PTC3-initiated signals impinging on Erk8 activation. Src Activity Is Dispensable for RET/PTC3-dependent Erk8 Activation—Based on the above information and on the observation that c-Src activates Erk8 (2Abe M.K. Saelzler M.P. Espinosa R. II I Kahle K.T. Hershenson M.B. Le Beau M.M. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16733-16743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), we next sought to investigate whether c-Src was able to mediate RET/PTC3-dependent Erk8 activation. A classical approach to establish a role for Src kinases in cellular processes takes advantage of a pyrazolo-pyrimidine compound, PP1, which binds the ATP-binding pocket of these kinases, therefore blocking their enzymatic activity (24Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar) and biological functions (12Chiariello M. Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 580-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Although PP1 has been described to affect RET kinase activity (25Carlomagno F. Vitagliano D. Guida T. Napolitano M. Vecchio G. Fusco A. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Santoro M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1077-1082PubMed Google Scholar), a specific mutation in valine 804 in the RET kinase domain confers resistance (>50-fold increase of the IC50) to the compound (11Carlomagno F. Guida T. Anaganti S. Vecchio G. Fusco A. Ryan A.J. Billaud M. Santoro M. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 6056-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). We, therefore, introduced such mutation in the RET/PTC3 kinase domain (RET/PTC3V804), rendering its activity significantly resistant to PP1, as scored by RET/PTC3V804 autophosphorylation and activation of Erk2 (Fig. 4A). As expected, kinase activity of the parental RET/PTC3 molecule was completely abolished at comparable concentrations (compare the 5-10 μm PP1 lanes) as evidenced by both RET/PTC3 autophosphorylation and activation of Erk2 (Fig. 4B). Surprisingly, PP1 treatment of RET/PTC3V804-transfected cells only slightly affected Erk8 activity even at the highest doses tested (10 μm) (Fig. 4C) and after extensive times of treatment (up to 10 h of treatment, at 5 μm concentration) (Fig. 4D), thus excluding a role for c-Src and its related kinases (24Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1790)"
https://openalex.org/W2068530092,"The fasciculation and elongation protein ζ1 (FEZ1) is a mammalian orthologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans protein UNC-76, which is necessary for axon growth in that nematode. In previous studies FEZ1 has been found to interact with protein kinase Cζ, DISC1, the agnoprotein of the human polyomavirus JC virus, and E4B, a U-box-type ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase. We reported previously that FEZ1 and its paralogue FEZ2 are proteins that interact with NEK1, a protein kinase involved in polycystic kidney disease and DNA repair mechanisms at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Here we report the identification of 16 proteins that interact with human FEZ1-(221–396) in a yeast two-hybrid assay of a human fetal brain cDNA library. The 13 interacting proteins of known functions take part either in transcription regulation and chromatin remodeling (6 proteins), the regulation of neuronal cell development (2 proteins) and cellular transport mechanisms (3 proteins) or participate in apoptosis (2 proteins). We were able to confirm eight of the observed interactions by in vitro pull-down assays with recombinant fusion proteins. The confirmed interacting proteins include FEZ1 itself and three transcription controlling proteins (SAP30L, DRAP1, and BAF60a). In mapping studies we found that the C-terminal regions of FEZ1, and especially its coiled-coil region, are involved in its dimerization, its heterodimerization with FEZ2, and in the interaction with 10 of the identified interacting proteins. Our results give further support to the previous speculation of the functional involvement of FEZ1 in neuronal development but suggest further that FEZ1 may also be involved in transcriptional control.

Our results give further support to the previous speculation of the functional involvement of FEZ1 in neuronal development but suggest further that FEZ1 may also be involved in transcriptional control. FEZ1 (fasciculation and elongation protein ζ-1) was initially identified as a mammalian orthologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans UNC-76 protein, which is necessary for normal axonal outgrowth, bundling, and elongation in this nematode (1Bloom L. Horvitz H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3414-3419Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). FEZ1 mRNA is expressed abundantly in the rat adult brain and throughout all developmental stages of the brain in mouse embryos (2Kuroda S. Nakagawa N. Tokunaga C. Tatematsu K. Tanizawa K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 114: 403-411Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 3Fujita T. Ikuta J. Hamada J. Okajima T. Tatematsu K. Tanizawa K. Kuroda S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 313: 738-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The human FEZ1 includes 392 amino acid residues, and its predicted structural organization shows that the protein possesses three glutamine-rich regions and a coiled-coil region (4Suzuki T. Okada Y. Semba S. Orba Y. Yamanouchi S. Endo S. Tanaka S. Fujita T. Kuroda S. Nagashima K. Sawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24948-24956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). A mammalian homologue of FEZ1, the protein FEZ2, which shows ubiquitous tissue expression, was described in rat and human and has 48% amino acid sequence identity to FEZ1 (3Fujita T. Ikuta J. Hamada J. Okajima T. Tatematsu K. Tanizawa K. Kuroda S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 313: 738-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Interestingly, FEZ1 was identified as an interacting protein partner in several yeast two-hybrid screens with independent protein baits. The first bait shown to interact with FEZ1 was the regulatory domain of the protein kinase C ζ (PKCζ) 4The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; GST, glutathione S-transferase; 3-AT, 3-amino 1,2,4-triazole; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride. 4The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; GST, glutathione S-transferase; 3-AT, 3-amino 1,2,4-triazole; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride. (2Kuroda S. Nakagawa N. Tokunaga C. Tatematsu K. Tanizawa K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 114: 403-411Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It was further found that FEZ1 is a cellular substrate for phosphorylation through PKCζ and that phosphorylated FEZ1 promotes neurite extension of PC12 cells in the absence of nerve growth factor. In a second study, using the C terminus of DISC1 (disrupted-in-schizophenia 1) as bait, FEZ1 was also identified as an interacting protein. The DISC1 gene has been implicated as a candidate gene for the etiology of schizophrenia (5Millar J.K. Wilson-Annan J.C. Anderson S. Christie S. Taylor M.S. Semple C.A.M. Devon R.S. Clair D.M.

The interaction of FEZ1 and DISC1 was found to be up-regulated in PC12 cells during neuronal differentiation, and this caused an enhanced extension of neurites in the presence of nerve growth factor (6Miyoshi K. Honda A. Baba K. Taniguchi M. Oono K. Fujita T. Kuroda S. Katayama T. Tohyama M. Mol. Psychiatry. 2003; 8: 685-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Third, the agnoprotein of the human polyomavirus JC virus, the causative agent of a fatal demyelinating disease, showed direct interaction with FEZ1 and microtubules (4Suzuki T. Okada Y. Semba S.

It was further verified that FEZ1 associated with the microtubules and that the agnoprotein induced FEZ1 dissociation from the microtubules leading to inhibited neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. Furthermore, FEZ1 was found to interact with E4B, a U-box-type ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase, again via yeast two-hybrid system studies (8Okumura F. Hatakeyama S. Matsumoto M. Kamura T. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53533-53543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This interaction is enhanced in the presence of PKCζ, and phosphorylation and/or ubiquitination of FEZ1 may contribute to neurite extension. We found FEZ1, as well as its paralogue FEZ2, as NEK1 protein kinase interacting proteins in a previous study (9Surpili M.J. Delben T.M. Kobarg J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 15369-15376Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Members of the NEKs (Nima-related kinases) take part in the regulation of the cell cycle and meiosis and constitute the kinase family so far less well characterized functionally (10Quarmby L.M. Mahjoub M.R. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5161-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Further NEK1 interactors include kinesin family member 3A (KIF3A), which had been described to also interact with FEZ1 (4Suzuki T. Okada Y. Semba S. Orba Y. Yamanouchi S. Endo S. Tanaka S. Fujita T. Kuroda S. Nagashima K. Sawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24948-24956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The FEZ1 orthologue UNC-76 has also been reported to interact with kinesin (11Gindhart J.G. Chen J. Faulkner M. Gandhi R. Doerner K. Wisniewski T. Nandlestadt A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3356-3365Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Together, this may suggest that UNC-76/FEZ1 could play a role in kinesin-mediated transport pathways (4Suzuki T. Okada Y. Semba S. Orba Y. Yamanouchi S. Endo S. Tanaka S. Fujita T. Kuroda S. Nagashima K. Sawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24948-24956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We set out to use FEZ1 itself as bait in a yeast two-hybrid assay and screened a human fetal brain cDNA library for potential FEZ1-interacting proteins. We found that FEZ1 interacts with itself and were able to confirm both FEZ1 homodimerization as well as its heterodimerization with FEZ2 by a series of in vitro experiments. In total we identified 16 FEZ1-interacting proteins that are either involved in transcriptional regulation (6 proteins), neuronal cell development (2 proteins), intracellular transport processes (3 proteins) or apoptosis (2 proteins), or are of unknown function (3 proteins), and we were also able to confirm 8 of these interactions by in vitro pull-down assays with recombinant proteins. In summary, our results further support previous findings that FEZ1 may be a regulatory protein with important functions during neuronal development, possibly through its involvement in intracellular transport processes. However, our new finding that FEZ1 interacts with nuclear proteins, six of which are functionally involved in transcription regulation and chromatin remodeling, opens the intriguing new possibility that FEZ1 may in addition to the previous predicted functions also have regulatory functions in the nucleus. Plasmid Constructions—Several sets of oligonucleotides were designed for PCR amplification of complete FEZ1 or deletion constructs thereof, which were then inserted in vector pBTM116 in fusion with the LexA DNA binding domain or in vectors pACT2 or pGAD424 (Clontech) in fusion with the Gal4 activation domain (Fig. 1A). The nucleotide sequence coding residues 207–353 of human FEZ2 were PCR-amplified using a specific primer set, 5′-AGGAATTCGGCAGTTATGAAGAGAGAGTG-3′ and 5′-AGGTCGACGTTACACTCTCTCTTCATAACT-3′, and then cloned into EcoRI and SalI restriction site in vector pBTM116. To express full-length FEZ1 or its different indicated deletions fused to a His tag, the corresponding nucleotide sequences were amplified by PCR and inserted into bacterial expression vector pET28a (Novagen/EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA). FEZ1-(131–392) represents a FEZ1 clone obtained in a yeast two-hybrid screening using the regulatory domain of NEK1 (9Surpili M.J. Delben T.M. Kobarg J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 15369-15376Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and was subcloned and expressed using the vector pProEX-HTc (Invitrogen). For expression of BAF60a-(404–515) and complete FEZ1 as well as its different deletion constructs fused to GST, the corresponding nucleotide sequences were cloned into a modified vector pET28a-GST that codifies GST protein upstream of the protein to be inserted. All nucleotide sequences encoding the proteins identified to interact with the FEZ1-(221–392), except that encoding BAF60a-(404–515), were subcloned from the vector pACT2 to the bacterial expression vector pGEX-4T-2 (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI), which allows the expression of the proteins in the form of a GST fusion. The orientation, frame, and correctness of sequence of each insert DNA were confirmed by restriction endonuclease analysis and automated DNA sequencing. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen and DNA Sequence Analyses—The yeast two-hybrid screen (12Chien C.T. Bartel P.L. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9578-9582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar) of a human fetal brain cDNA library (Clontech) was performed by using the yeast strain L40 (trp1-901, his3Δ200, leu2-3, ade2 LYS2::(lexAop)4-HIS3 URA3::(lexAop)8-lac GAL4) and human FEZ1-(221–392) as a bait fused to the yeast LexA DNA binding domain in vector pBTM116 (13Bartel P.L. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). This fragment of FEZ1 does not autoactivate the yeast reporter genes (see Fig. 1 and “Results”). The autonomous activation test for HIS3 was performed in minimal medium plates without tryptophan and histidine but containing 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, or 50 mm of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT). Furthermore, the autonomous activation of LacZ was measured by the β-galactosidase filter assay described below. Yeast cells were transformed according to the protocols supplied by Clontech. The screening was performed in minimal medium plates without tryptophan, leucine, and histidine. Half of the transfected cells were plated in selective medium containing 10 mm 3-AT, and the other half was plated on selective medium without addition of 3-AT. Recombinant pACT2 plasmids of positive clones were isolated and their insert DNAs sequenced with a DNA sequencer model 377S (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The obtained DNA sequence data were translated using the TRANSLATE Tool of ExPASy (Expert Protein Analysis System), available online, and compared with sequences in the NCBI data bank using the BLASTP 2.2.12 program (14Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Millerm W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59762) Google Scholar). The prediction of coiled-coil structures in the analyzed protein sequences was performed by the software COILS available on line (Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research). Assay for β-Galactosidase Activity in Yeast Cells—β-Galactosidase activity in yeast cells was determined by the filter assay method. Yeast transformants (Leu+, Trp+, and His+) were transferred onto nylon membranes, permeabilized in liquid nitrogen, and placed on Whatman 3MM paper previously soaked in Z buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0) containing 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside (X-gal). After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, the yeast cells forming dark blue colonies were taken from replica plates for further analysis. Mapping the Protein Interaction Sites—One of the deletion constructs of FEZ1-(269–392) had the coiled-coil region removed. This construct was co-transformed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain L40 with the “bait”-plasmid DNAs isolated from the two-hybrid screening. After transformation, yeast clones were streaked on minimal medium plates without tryptophan, leucine, and histidine for testing their growth capacity under interaction-selective conditions. The presence of both types of plasmids was controlled by growth on plates with minimal medium plates without tryptophan and leucine (15Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). To further test if the paralogue of FEZ1, FEZ2, interacts with the proteins that were isolated in the yeast two-hybrid screen using FEZ1, the corresponding bait-plasmid DNAs were co-transformed in L40 with the construct pBTM116-FEZ2-(207–353). FEZ2-(207–353) alone does not transactivate the reporter genes, and the co-transfected L40 clones were selected on minimal medium without tryptophan, leucine, and histidine. Protein Expression and Purification—The nucleotide sequences in the library vector pACT2, which are inserted between restriction sites EcoRI and XhoI and code for the interacting proteins identified in the yeast two-hybrid system screen, were subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-4T-2 (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI) to allow expression of recombinant GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells. Soluble FEZ1 (complete or deletions), fused to the His tag or the GST tag, was purified for in vitro analyses from 1 liter of culture of E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells that were induced for 3 h to protein expression at 30 °C using 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. For size exclusion chromatography, the nucleotide sequence of the pACT2 clone (Fig. 1A), containing FEZ1-(131–392), was subcloned into expression vector pProExHTb (Invitrogen) using the restriction sites EcoRI and XhoI, as described (9Surpili M.J. Delben T.M. Kobarg J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 15369-15376Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). All His-tagged proteins used in this study were purified using a HiTrap chelating column in anÄKTA™ FPLC™ (GE Healthcare) as follows. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,500 × g for 10 min, and the cell pellet was resuspended and incubated for 30 min with 10 volumes of lysis buffer (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.05 mg/ml DNase). After three cycles of sonication, soluble and insoluble fractions were separated by centrifugation at 28,500 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The cleared supernatant was then loaded onto a HiTrap chelating column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer (lacking lysozyme and DNase), followed by extensive wash of the column with the same buffer. Bound proteins were eluted in a gradient of 0–100% of elution buffer (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 500 mm imidazole, pH 7.4). Aliquots of each eluted fraction obtained were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and peak fractions containing FEZ1 were dialyzed with buffer (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4·7H2O, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol, pH 7.4). The FEZ1 proteins (complete or deletions) fused to GST were induced for expression as described above. After sonication the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 28,500 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Uniflow resin (Clontech) and used for in vitro binding assay. The cDNA coding the proteins identified by yeast two-hybrid assay were cloned into the vector pGEX-4T-2 in fusion with GST, and fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells at 37 °C using 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h. In Vitro Binding Assay—Expressed GST, GST-KIBRA, GST-SAP30L, GST-CLASP2, GST-RAI14, GST-Bamacan, GST-DRAP1, and GST-BAF60a proteins were allowed to bind to 25 μl of glutathione-Uniflow resin (Clontech) in 1 ml of total bacterial protein extract in PBS for 1 h at 4 °C. After incubation, the beads containing bound recombinant proteins were washed three times with PBS (0.14 m NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) at 4 °C. 25 μg of purified full-length 6xHis-FEZ1 fusion protein were added to the resins containing GST or GST fusion proteins and incubated in 0.1 ml of PBS 1× for 4 h at 4 °C to allow protein-protein interactions to occur. The beads were then washed three times with 0.5 ml of PBS, followed by three washings with 0.5 ml of PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, then three washes with 0.5 ml of PBS only. Resin-bound proteins were resolved on two separate 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes by semi-dry electroblotting. After saturation with unspecific protein (5% bovine serum albumin) in TBS (0.15 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.2), one of the membranes was incubated with a mouse anti-His tag (1:5000) and the other with mouse monoclonal anti-GST antibody 5.3.3 (hybridoma supernatant 1:5) for 1 h each. The anti-GST monoclonal antibody 5.3.3 had been generated by immunizing BALB/c mice with a GST-CGI-55 recombinant fusion protein (16Lemos T.A. Passos D.O. Nery F.C. Kobarg J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 533: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Selection of hybridoma producing anti-CGI-55 or anti-GST antibodies was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with purified recombinant 6xHis-CGI-55 or GST protein. Specificity of the recloned hybridoma 5.3.3 was confirmed by anti-GST Western blot. After three washes with TBS, 0.05% Tween 20, the membranes were incubated with the secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:5000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h and washed again three times with TBS. The membranes were then developed by chemiluminescence using the reagent Luminol (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for detection of His-tagged or GST fusion proteins. To confirm the in vitro interaction of FEZ1 with itself, GST-FEZ1-(1–392), GST-FEZ1-(1–227), GST-FEZ1-(221–392), or GST-FEZ1-(269–392), which lacks the coiled-coil region, were all allowed to bind to glutathione-Uniflow resin as described above. For each preparation of loaded beads, we added in separate reactions 25 μg of each of the following three different purified 6xHis-FEZ1 fusion proteins, 6xHis-FEZ1-(1–392), 6xHis-FEZ1-(1–227), or 6xHis-FEZ1-(221–392), which were incubated, washed, and analyzed for protein interaction by Western blot as described above. Size Exclusion Chromatography—Five milligrams of purified 6xHis-FEZ1-(131–392) were loaded on a Superdex™ 75 10/30 Prep Grade column (GE Healthcare) that had been equilibrated previously with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl and calibrated with the following standard proteins: aldolase (158 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa). 0.5-ml fractions were collected, and 10-μl samples of each fraction of the different peaks observed were analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Analysis of the Auto-activation of Different FEZ1 Constructs in the Yeast Two-hybrid System—Before the yeast two-hybrid screening of a human fetal brain cDNA library, the construction encoding full-length FEZ1 was tested for autonomous activation of the reporter gene HIS3, i.e. capacity of growth in minimal medium (lacking tryptophan and histidine) and with addition of 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, or 50 mm 3-AT, an inhibitor of HIS3, that suppresses background growth of the yeast on minimal medium lacking histidine. To further investigate the autonomous activation of the second reporter gene lacZ, we also performed the β-galactosidase filter assay. The results of both assays revealed a strong and autonomous activation of the reporter genes HIS3 and lacZ by the full-length protein FEZ1. To solve this problem, a set of oligonucleotides was designed to subclone different regions of FEZ1 into the pBTM116 vector and to test them for autoactivation. Only the two constructions FEZ1-(221–392) and FEZ1-(269–392), which lack the coiled-coil region, did not show autonomous activation of the HIS3 and lacZ reporter genes (Fig. 1B). The construction FEZ1-(221–392) was chosen for the screening of the human fetal brain cDNA library. Interestingly, all N-terminal constructs of FEZ1 showed strong autoactivation (1–129, 122–227, 122–392, and 1–227). This may indicate that FEZ1 could be a transcriptional activation protein, and its putative transcriptional activation domain located at its N terminus seems to have a conserved function in respect to the activation of the reporter genes in yeast. It is noteworthy that the three glutamic acid-rich motifs are found in the N-terminal region of FEZ1 (Fig. 3B), the second and third of which are partially conserved also in FEZ2. Identification of Proteins that Interact with FEZ1—To identify proteins interacting with FEZ1, we employed the yeast two-hybrid system (13Bartel P.L. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) and screened a human fetal brain cDNA library. FEZ1-(221–392) was used as bait, and a total of about 1.5 × 106 co-transformed clones were assayed in two groups. Although the first half of transformants was plated on selective minimal medium plates (without tryptophan, leucine, and histidine), the another half was plated on selective minimal medium (without tryptophan, leucine, and histidine) with the addition of 10 mm 3-AT. All grown colonies that showed a strong blue color in the subsequent β-galactosidase filter assay had their plasmid DNA extracted and sequenced. A total of 101 plasmid DNAs from clones positive for both HIS3 and LacZ reporters were sequenced. 16 different proteins were identified using FEZ1-(221–392) as bait (Table 1), which can be organized into the following groups according the major described function attributed to them: 1) proteins involved in transcriptional control and chromatin organization (6 proteins); 2) proteins that take part in the regulation of neural cell development, microtubule dynamics, and transport (5 proteins); 3) proteins taking part in apoptosis processes (2 proteins) or tumorigenesis; and 4) proteins with little or no functional information available as yet (3 proteins). Table 1 summarizes the domain organization and functional characteristics of the proteins found to interact with FEZ1.TABLE 1Human FEZ1-interacting proteins identified by the yeast two-hybrid system screenProtein interacting with FEZ1C (aliases)Coded protein residues (complete sequence/retrieved)Accession no.Domain composition (native protein)aOther domains may be present.FunctionbOther functions may be known.Ref.DRAP1 (NC2α)205/1-205NP_006433Histone domain, coiled-coil regionTranscriptional control23Kamada K.

https://openalex.org/W2026532120,"Two isoforms of succinyl-CoA synthetase exist in mammals, one specific for ATP and the other for GTP. The GTP-specific form of pig succinyl-CoA synthetase has been crystallized in the presence of GTP and the structure determined to 2.1 Å resolution. GTP is bound in the ATP-grasp domain, where interactions of the guanine base with a glutamine residue (Gln-20β) and with backbone atoms provide the specificity. The γ-phosphate interacts with the side chain of an arginine residue (Arg-54β) and with backbone amide nitrogen atoms, leading to tight interactions between the γ-phosphate and the protein. This contrasts with the structures of ATP bound to other members of the family of ATP-grasp proteins where the γ-phosphate is exposed, free to react with the other substrate. To test if GDP would interact with GTP-specific succinyl-CoA synthetase in the same way that ADP interacts with other members of the family of ATP-grasp proteins, the structure of GDP bound to GTP-specific succinyl-CoA synthetase was also determined. A comparison of the conformations of GTP and GDP shows that the bases adopt the same position but that changes in conformation of the ribose moieties and the α- and β-phosphates allow the γ-phosphate to interact with the arginine residue and amide nitrogen atoms in GTP, while the β-phosphate interacts with these residues in GDP. The complex of GTP with succinyl-CoA synthetase shows that the enzyme is able to protect GTP from hydrolysis when the active-site histidine residue is not in position to be phosphorylated.

Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 327-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The determinations of the structures of several of these enzymes in complex with nucleotides, nucleotide analogues, and their other substrates has led to a good understanding of the interactions that are important in their binding and catalysis. The biological roles of the ATP- and GTP-specific SCS have not been fully delineated. Originally it was thought that the primary role for SCS was in the citric acid cycle, where it was responsible for the breakdown of succinyl-CoA to succinate and coenzyme A accompanied by the phosphorylation of nucleotide diphosphate to nucleotide triphosphate (26Kaufman S. Gilvarg C. Cori O. Ochoa S. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 203: 869-888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This step provides the only substrate-level phosphorylation of the citric acid cycle. It was thought that some species had SCS that could use either ADP or GDP, e.g. E. coli (27Murakami K. Mitchell T. Nishimura J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6247-6254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while others had SCS that could use only GDP, e.g. animals (26Kaufman S. Gilvarg C. Cori O. Ochoa S. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 203: 869-888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or ADP, e.g. plants (28Kaufman S. Alivisatos S.G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 216: 141-152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the currency for energy in the cell is ATP, the GTP produced in the citric acid cycle would have to be converted to ATP by nucleotide diphosphate kinase. Once it was discovered that some animals had two forms of SCS, one specific for each nucleotide, it was hypothesized that the two isoforms allowed SCS to serve different metabolic roles (29Hamilton M.L. Ottaway J.H. FEBS Lett. 1981; 123: 252-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The reaction catalyzed by SCS is reversible and the direction would depend on the relative concentrations of nucleotide diphosphate and nucleotide triphosphate (30Ottaway J.H. McClellan J.A. Saunderson C.L. Int. J. Biochem. 1981; 13: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Mammalian SCS is found in mitochondria where the ratio of the concentration of ATP to that of ADP is ∼1, while the ratio of the concentration of GTP to that of GDP is ∼100 (31Smith C.M. Bryla J. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 1497-1505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The high concentration ratio of GTP to GDP would drive the reaction in the opposite direction to that in the citric acid cycle (32McClellan J.A. Ottaway J.H. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1980; 67: 679-684Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar), thus GTP-specific SCS might serve in the synthesis of succinyl-CoA, while ATP-specific SCS would serve in the citric acid cycle. In addition to breaking down succinyl-CoA, SCS catalyzes the reverse reaction to produce succinyl-CoA, an essential precursor in the synthesis of heme (33Labbe R.F. Kurumada T. Onisawa J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 111: 403-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Recent experiments have shown that both enzymes are produced in many tissues but the relative amounts vary (34Lambeth D.O. Tews K.N. Adkins S. Frohlich D. Milavetz B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36621-36624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Tissues with high need for energy, such as the heart, do show higher activities of ATP-specific SCS, while kidney and liver tissues show higher activities of GTP-specific SCS. These relative activities are consistent with ATP-specific SCS serving a catabolic role, while GTP-specific SCS would serve an anabolic role. That said, the recent discovery of a deficiency of ATP-specific SCS activity associated with encephalomyopathy and mitochondrial DNA depletion (35Elpeleg O. Miller C. Hershkovitz E. Bitner-Glindzicz M. Bondi-Rubinstein G. Rahman S. Pagnamenta A. Eshhar S. Saada A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2005; 76: 1081-1086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) does suggest that ATP-specific SCS also serves an anabolic role. The structure of pig GTP-specific SCS has been determined in both the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms (36Fraser M.E. James M.N.G. Bridger W.A. Wolodko W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1325-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the catalytic reaction, His-259 of the α-subunit (designated His-259α) is transiently phosphorylated. Based on work with E. coli SCS, it was hypothesized that this active site histidine residue serves to shuttle the phosphoryl group between the nucleotide-binding site and the site where CoA and, presumably, succinate bind (5Fraser M.E. James M.N.G. Bridger W.A. Wolodko W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1633-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In this work, pig GTP-specific SCS has been crystallized in a complex with GTP to determine which residues provide nucleotide specificity. The structures of pig GTP-specific SCS without nucleotide and with GDP, crystallized under similar conditions to the GTP complex, have also been determined and are described here. These structures and the structures of other members of the ATP-grasp family provide useful comparisons for interpreting the binding of GTP to succinyl-CoA synthetase. Protein Expression—The two subunits of pig GTP-specific SCS were cloned and overexpressed in E. coli. The amino termini of both subunits were modified by PCR to remove the signal sequences that target the polypeptides to mitochondria. The modifications of the α-subunit result in translation beginning at the NH2-terminal sequence MSYTA, and post-translational modification removes the first methionine residue. The β-subunit begins with the amino acids MNLQ and the aminoterminal methionine residue is not cleaved. The design of the gene is different from one used earlier (37Bailey D.L. Wolodko W.T. Bridger W.A. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1255-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) because the crystal structure showed that a methionine residue inserted before the first residue of the mature β-subunit could interfere with catalysis (36Fraser M.E. James M.N.G. Bridger W.A. Wolodko W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1325-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It may be the reason for the reduced specific activity of the enzyme produced in E. coli (37Bailey D.L. Wolodko W.T. Bridger W.A. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1255-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Modified cDNAs encoding the mature α- and β-subunits were cloned into a single expression plasmid, each cDNA being placed downstream of a separate T7 promoter. E. coli BL21(DE3) were transformed with the plasmid. For protein expression, 500 ml of Luria-Bertani medium was inoculated and grown overnight at 30 °C. The cells were then diluted by a factor of twenty and allowed to grow until they reached an A600 nm of 0.4. Protein expression was induced with 1.0 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and the cells were grown overnight at 30 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation in a Sorvall GSA rotor at 5 × 103 rpm and 4 °C for 30 min and then resuspended in 0.1 m KCl, 50 mm potassium phosphate, 1.0 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.4. After freezing at -70 °C, the cells were thawed and sonicated. The debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 1 × 104 rpm in a Sorvall SS34 rotor at 4 °C, and the supernatant was retained. The pellet was then resuspended, resonicated, and recentrifuged, again retaining the supernatant. Protein Purification—Pig GTP-specific SCS was purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation and column chromatography at 4 °C. 20 g of ammonium sulfate were added to each 100 ml of supernatant, and after centrifugation at 1 × 104 rpm in the SS34 rotor, the precipitate was discarded. 30 g of ammonium sulfate were added per 100 ml of the original volume, and the sample was centrifuged. The supernatant was discarded, and the precipitate was redissolved in 10 mm potassium phosphate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm PMSF, 10.0 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1.0 mm benzamidine, pH 7.4. The solution was loaded onto a 5.0 × 19-cm G-Sephadex Coarse column and eluted with 10 mm potassium phosphate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm PMSF, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1.0 mm benzamidine for desalting. To separate pig GTP-specific SCS from E. coli SCS, the protein was loaded on a hydroxyapatite column (5.0 × 10 cm) and eluted using a gradient of the buffer in which the concentration of potassium phosphate increased to 0.5 m. The protein was again precipitated with ammonium sulfate and redissolved in a minimal volume of buffer, then run on a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (5.0 × 10 cm). The column was washed with 10 mm potassium phosphate, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, and eluted using a gradient increasing the potassium chloride concentration to 0.5 m. The protein was precipitated in 50% w/v ammonium sulfate, 10 mm potassium phosphate, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm PMSF, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1.0 mm benzamidine, pH 7.4, and stored at 4 °C. The final yield was ∼13 mg of enzyme per liter of initial culture when using a fermentor and half that when using 2.8-liter Fernbach flasks. The concentration and activity of pig GTP-specific SCS were measured spectrophotometrically. The concentration was determined from the absorbance at a wavelength of 280 nm using the absorption coefficient 0.35 A mg-1 cm-1 (38Murakami Y. Nishimura J.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 336: 252-263Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The activity of the enzyme was measured in 0.11 m Tris-HCl, 0.05 m sodium succinate, 0.01 m MgCl2, 0.1 m KCl, 0.1 mm GTP, 0.1 mm CoA, 0.1 mm diethyldithiothreitol by following the increase in absorption at 235 nm (39Cha S. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 13: 62-69Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Purified protein had a specific activity of 21 units mg-1, twice the activity provided by the previous clone (37Bailey D.L. Wolodko W.T. Bridger W.A. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1255-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Crystallization—For crystallization, an aliquot of the ammonium sulfate precipitate was collected by centrifugation for 60 min at 12 × 103 rpm in the SS34 rotor. The precipitate was resuspended in a minimal volume of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4. The protein solution was then dialyzed against 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, and 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol to remove ammonium sulfate. The dialysis bag was then transferred to a solution of 50 mm Bicine, pH 7.6, 0.5 mm GTP, 5mm MgCl2,1mm 2-mercaptoethanol overnight to phosphorylate His-259α. Dialysis in fresh phosphate buffer followed for a period of 24 h to remove the nucleotide, followed by dialysis in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, or 50 mm Bicine, pH 7.6. The protein solution was removed from the dialysis tubing and centrifuged for 30 min at 30 × 103 rpm in a Beckman TLA 100 rotor at 4 °C to remove particulate matter. Crystals were grown by vapor diffusion in hanging drops. The concentration of the protein was ∼8 mg/ml, and a 1–2-μl drop of this solution was mixed with an equal volume of the precipitant solution, then hung over a 1-ml well of the precipitant solution. The first diffracting crystals were obtained using a precipitant solution containing 10% v/v isopropanol, 100 mm ammonium sulfate, 20% w/v polyethylene glycol 4000, and 100 mm HEPES or Bicine, pH 7.5. Crystals were visible within 2 or 3 days. The crystals diffracted better when the pH of the buffer was adjusted with hydrochloric acid, later realized to be due to the chloride ions. In initial unsuccessful attempts to obtain crystals with nucleotide bound, crystals were soaked in mother liquor containing 10 mm GDP and 25 mm MgCl2. Crystals of the complex with GTP were successfully grown from a protein solution containing 5 mm GTP and 10 mm MgCl2 using 20% w/v polyethylene glycol 3350 and 150 mm KF in the precipitant solution. Crystals of the complex with GDP were grown by seeding small crystals of the GTP complex into drops set up using 5 mm GDP instead of GTP. The seeds that formed were transferred into fresh drops and allowed to grow. Data Collection and Structure Determination—Diffraction data were collected in house and at two synchrotrons. The in-house system was a Mar345 image plate detector on a rotating anode (Rigaku RU H3R, CuKα, 46 kV, 100 mA) with Osmic multilayer mirrors. Synchrotron data were collected at beamline 14-BM-C of the Advanced Photon Source and at beamline 8.3.1 of the Advanced Light Source using an ADSC CCD detector. For data collections at low temperature, the crystals were cryoprotected using mother liquor containing 10% v/v 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol instead of isopropanol and 15% v/v glycerol for the crystals without nucleotide and 5% v/v glycerol for crystals with nucleotide. The crystals were vitrified at 100 K in the cold stream of gaseous nitrogen (Oxford Cryostream). Diffraction data were processed using the programs Denzo and Scalepack (40Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38526) Google Scholar) or the Elves scripts (41Holton J. Alber T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The structures were solved by molecular replacement using the model of pig GTP-specific SCS identified in the Protein Data Bank (43Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H.

Model quality was judged using the programs PROCHECK (48Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl.

Genet. 1998; 30: 144-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar) were used to analyze the models. Four structures were determined: two with no nucleotide bound, plus the complex with GTP and the complex with GDP. The statistics for the four data sets and refined models are presented in Table 1. Each data set was collected from a single crystal, except for the data set for nucleotide-free GTP-specific SCS with the chloride ion. In this case, data were merged from two crystals, one of which diffracted to higher resolution than the other. (An equipment failure during the collection of the diffraction data from the better diffracting crystal led to the loss of that crystal.) The two structures with no nucleotide bound diffracted to different resolutions. The better diffracting crystals were grown with chloride, and electron density that was interpreted as the chloride ion was visible at a crystal-packing interface. Unfortunately, the chloride ion trapped the ATP-grasp domain in a more open conformation, likely leading to the lack of success in binding nucleotide to the protein in soaking experiments. Modifications of the crystallization conditions were needed to get crystals of the complex with nucleotide, as explained under “Experimental Procedures.” The crystals grown with GTP diffracted very well, to 2.1 Å resolution. Crystals with GDP grew under similar conditions but only diffracted to 3 Å resolution.TABLE 1Statistics for the data sets and refined modelsStructureNucleotide-freeNucleotide-free with Cl–Complex with GTPComplex with GDPX-ray sourceAdvanced Photon SourceIn-houseAdvanced Light SourceAdvanced Light SourceResolution range (high resolution)35–2.7 Å (2.75–2.7 Å)25–2.35 (2.43–2.35 Å)73–2.1 Å (2.21–2.1 Å)116–2.96 Å (3.12–2.96 Å)Rmerge (high resolution)aRmerge = (ΣΣ|Ii – 〈I 〉|)/ΣΣ 〈I 〉, where Ii is the intensity of an individual measurement of a reflection, and 〈I 〉 is the mean value for all equivalent measurements of this reflection4.9% (25.8%)11.4% (37.4%)5.5% (36.2%)12.6% (53.2%)〈I 〉/σ(〈I 〉) (high resolution)b〈I 〉 is the mean intensity for all reflections, 〈σ(I) 〉 is the mean sigma for these reflections35.4 (6.1)13.1 (3.8)19.8 (3.3)10.9 (3.0)Number of observations134,763120,730238,30298,686Average redundancy5.94.55.56.3Completeness99.8% (100%)87.9% (77.3%)99.6% (97.5%)100% (100%)Cell dimensionsa = b = 135.8 Å, c = 77.2 Å, α = β = 90°, γ = 120°a = b = 123.4 Å, c = 84.9 Å, α = β = 90°, γ = 120°a = b = 132.6 Å, c = 72.5 Å, α = β = 90°, γ = 120°a = b = 133.8 Å, c = 73.1 Å, α = β = 90°, γ = 120°Number of data for refinement22,39726,97843,84615,696R-factor (number of data)cR-factor = Σ||Fo| – |Fc||/Σ|Fo|21.5% (21,274)19.2% (25,907)19.5% (41,251)20.1% (14,892)R-free (number of data)dR-factor based on data excluded from the refinement (∼5%)31.0% (1123)25.9% (1071)24.2% (2235)27.5% (804)Number of protein atoms5225522552255221Number of water molecules6412629410Number of atoms in ions or ligands10166634Root mean square deviations from ideal geometry:Bond lengths (Å)0.0160.0170.0160.008Bond angles (°)2.01.91.91.4Ramachandran plot:Number in most favored regions503 (85.7%)530 (90.3%)543 (92.5%)485 (82.6%)Number in additional allowed regions80 (13.6%)57 (9.7%)44 (7.5%)101 (17.2%)Number in generously allowed regions4 (0.7%)001 (0.2%)a Rmerge = (ΣΣ|Ii – 〈I 〉|)/ΣΣ 〈I 〉, where Ii is the intensity of an individual measurement of a reflection, and 〈I 〉 is the mean value for all equivalent measurements of this reflectionb 〈I 〉 is the mean intensity for all reflections, 〈σ(I) 〉 is the mean sigma for these reflectionsc R-factor = Σ||Fo| – |Fc||/Σ|Fo|d R-factor based on data excluded from the refinement (∼5%) Open table in a new tab GTP is bound in the ATP-grasp fold of the amino-terminal domain of the β-subunit of pig GTP-specific SCS (Fig. 1). Fig. 1B shows the electron density for GTP and a potassium ion. The interactions providing the specific binding of the guanine base are hydrogen-bonding interactions between the side chain of Gln-20β and O-6 of the base and between the amide nitrogen and carbonyl oxygen atoms of Leu-109β and O-6, N-1, and N-2 of the base. The γ-phosphate of GTP interacts with the guanidinium group and amide nitrogen atom of Arg-54β, the amide nitrogen atom of Gly-53β and the side chain of Asp-220β. Although Lys-222β is also within hydrogen-bonding distance of the γ-phosphate, there is no electron density for the amino group of this side chain, indicating that it is disordered and does not interact strongly with the γ-phosphate. Electron density is visible for only one ion bridging the α- and β-phosphates of GTP, as well as interacting with the carbonyl oxygen atom of Asn-206β and the carboxylate oxygen atom of Asp-220β. Initially, this ion was modeled as magnesium, but it was changed to potassium because of the relatively long distances (2.7–3.0 Å) between it and the oxygen atoms in its coordination shell (53Harding M.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 872-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and the relatively low temperature factor of 22 Å2 compared with the average temperature factor of 40 Å2 for the atoms in GTP. During the final cycles of refinement as potassium, the temperature factor for the ion increased to 33 Å2. His-259α is phosphorylated in the structure of the complex with GTP and in the structures where no nucleotide is bound. It is not phosphorylated in the complex with GDP, but there is electron density for a phosphate ion near His-259α. A second molecule of GTP in complex with a single Mg2+ ion is bound at a crystal-packing interface in the structure of the GTP complex. Its interactions with the two protein molecules may explain why this crystal diffracts so well compared with the crystals of the complex with GDP. A small amount of electron density is visible in the same crystal-packing site in the complex of GDP with SCS, possibly because of contamination of GDP with GTP or because of phosphorylation of the protein, which could then lead to phosphorylation of GDP during crystallization. There is also extra density at the GDP-binding site that could be attributed to some GTP bound at this site. Due to the low resolution of the diffraction data, only GDP was modeled in the nucleotide-binding site. Fig. 1C shows the electron density for GDP and the potassium ion. The structure"

The beta retrovirus mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) uses transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) to enter cells in a pH-dependent mechanism, probably co-trafficking with TfR1 to an acidic compartment where virus entry occurs. We have shown here that, although mouse and rat TfR1 function as entry receptors, cat, dog, hamster, or human TfR1s do not support MMTV infection. We also demonstrated that MMTV entry is independent of transferrin, iron, and the TfR1 cofactor hereditary hematochromatosis HFE protein. Using chimeric mouse/human hybrid TfR1 constructs, we determined the site of interaction with MMTV and found that it maps to two segments physically disparate from the TfR and HFE binding sites. Thus, MMTV has apparently evolved to enter cells independently of the iron status of the host.

Much is known about the role of transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) 2The abbreviations used are: TfR1, transferrin receptor 1; Tf, transferrin; HFE, hematochromatosis protein; MMTV, mouse mammary tumor virus; NMUMG, normal murine mammary gland; aa, amino acid. 2The abbreviations used are: TfR1, transferrin receptor 1; Tf, transferrin; HFE, hematochromatosis protein; MMTV, mouse mammary tumor virus; NMUMG, normal murine mammary gland; aa, amino acid. and its accessory proteins in the uptake of iron into cells. Iron-bound transferrin (Tf) first binds to TfR1 at neutral pH at the cell surface and traffics with the receptor to an acidic compartment where iron is released and transported to the cytoplasm via divalent metal transport protein 1 (reviewed in Ref. 1Aisen P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 36: 2137-2143Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The receptor then recycles back to the cell surface, where iron-free Tf is released and a new molecule of iron-bound Tf binds. At least one additional cell surface protein has been implicated in the process of iron uptake, the β2-μglobulin-associated, major histocompatibility locus-encoded hereditary hematochromatosis HFE protein, which competes with Tf for binding to TfR1 and is thought to limit iron uptake by cells in which it is co-expressed with the receptor (1Aisen P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 36: 2137-2143Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Indeed, mice with targeted deletion of the β2-μglobulin gene develop an iron overload disorder similar to that seen in HFE patients (2Santos M. Schilham M.W. Rademakers L.H. Marx J.J. de Sousa M. Clevers H. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1975-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). HFE protein is found in a number of cell types, including epithelia, fibroblasts, and monocytes/macrophages (3Riegert P. Gilfillan S. Nanda I. Schmid M. Bahram S.

The crystal structure of the human TfR1 ectodomain has been solved, both as a homodimer (6Lawrence C.M. Ray S. Babyonyshev M. Galluser R. Borhani D.W. Harrison S.C. Science. 1999; 286: 779-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) and in complex with the HFE protein (7Bennett M.J. Lebron J.A. Bjorkman P.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The protein is defined by three domains, a protease-like domain (residues 122-188 and 384-606) with similarity to carboxyl- and amino-peptidases but no apparent enzymatic activity, an apical domain (residues 189-383), and a helical domain (residues 607-760) required for subunit dimerization. The solution of the structure in combination with mutagenesis studies (8West Jr., A.P. Giannetti A.M. Herr A.B. Bennett M.J. Nangiana J.S. Pierce J.R. Weiner L.P. Snow P.M. Bjorkman P.J. J. Mol.

Cell. 2004; 116: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) have defined overlapping and competing binding sites for Tf and HFE located in the helical region of the protein. Sequence comparison of this region from different species shows strong conservation of an RGD-like sequence that is critical for Tf and HFE binding (8West Jr., A.P. Giannetti A.M. Herr A.B. Bennett M.J. Nangiana J.S. Pierce J.R. Weiner L.P. Snow P.M. Bjorkman P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 385-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 13Dubljevic V. Sali A. Goding J.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, despite this conservation, binding of Tf from one species to the receptor of another species can vary by several orders of magnitude (14Shimo-Oka T. Hagiwara Y. Ozawa E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1986; 126: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 15Penhallow R.C. Brown-Mason A. Woodworth R.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1986; 128: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), indicating that other regions of the TfR1 are involved in this interaction. This is supported by mutagenesis studies implicating sequences in the protease-like domain in addition to the helical domain that affect Tf and HFE binding (8West Jr., A.P. Giannetti A.M. Herr A.B. Bennett M.J. Nangiana J.S. Pierce J.R. Weiner L.P. Snow P.M. Bjorkman P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 385-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Even outside the Tf binding site, there is strong interspecies sequence conservation of TfR1. For example, the mouse and human TfR1 coding regions are 76% identical and 86% homologous. Despite this conservation, the murine beta retrovirus MMTV, which uses TfR1 as its entry receptor, does not infect cells expressing either human or hamster TfR1 (16Ross S.R. Schofield J.J. Farr C.J. Bucan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12386-12390Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Indeed, we have shown here that only rodent TfR1s, and not cat, dog, hamster, or human molecules, support virus entry into cells. Using sequence comparison in combination with the known structure of human TfR1 as an initial starting point for design, we constructed mouse/human chimeric receptors and found that MMTV utilizes a region of TfR1 that is physically distinct from the sites of Tf and HFE binding. In support of these functional studies, we also showed that MMTV infection is not affected by the presence of Tf or iron or the absence of the HFE protein.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 628-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar) were prepared in 293T cells and used for infection as previously described (20Golovkina T.V. Dzuris J.L. van den Hoogen B. Jaffe A.B. Wright P.C. Cofer S.M. Ross S.R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3066-3071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Infection was quantified by in situ staining of lacZ-positive colonies; the data are presented as Lac-forming units/ml of virus preparation. In some experiments, soluble β-galactosidase assays were performed with pseudovirus-infected cell extracts using a commercial kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Inc., Madison, WI). These data are presented as milliunits/mg/h protein. To test the wild-type, mutant, or chimeric TfR1s for their ability to function as MMTV receptors, DNA was transiently transfected into 293T cells using calcium phosphate precipitation (16Ross S.R. Schofield J.J. Farr C.J. Bucan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12386-12390Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were infected with MMTV pseudotypes and analyzed for infection by lacZ staining. Tf Competition—Mouse apo-Tf (Sigma) was converted to holo-Tf as described (21McKenna W.R. Mickelsen P.A. Sparling P.F. Dyer D.W. Infect. Immun. 1998; 56: 785-791Crossref Google Scholar). Mouse and human (Sigma) apo- and holo-Tf at the indicated concentrations were incubated with TRH3 cells on ice in the presence of MMTV pseudoviruses for 1 h. Cells were washed several times with medium and refed. After 48 h, infected cells were stained in situ for β-galactosidase and colonies were counted. Desferrioxamine and Ferric Ammonium Citrate Treatment— NMuMG or TRH3 cells were preincubated for 1 h with 100 μm desferrioxamine mesylate (Sigma) or 100 μg/ml of ferric ammonium citrate (Sigma). MMTV pseudovirus infection was carried out in the presence of the compounds. After 2 h of incubation with virus, the cells were washed; infection was quantified 48 h later as previously described (20Golovkina T.V. Dzuris J.L. van den Hoogen B. Jaffe A.B. Wright P.C. Cofer S.M. Ross S.R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3066-3071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tf Uptake Assay—At 24 h post-transfection, 293T cells were incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 1 h. Fluorescein isothiocyanate- or Texas Red-conjugated Tf (12 μg/ml; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was applied to cells in serum-free medium for 1 h. The cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, and observed with a Nikon DIAPHOT 300 microscope. Western Blot and Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting Analysis—All transfected cells were harvested at 48 h post-transfection for expression analysis. For chimeras 1-6, partially purified membrane fractions were prepared (22Gruenheid S. Canonne-Hergaux F. Gauthier S. Hackam D.J. Grinstein S. Gros P. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 831-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), and 10 μg of protein/lane were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE) and analyzed by Western blotting. For the other chimeras and the site-mutagenized constructs, whole cell lysates of transfected cells were prepared and separated by SDS-PAGE. Hybridoma supernatant OKT9 (a gift from Morrie Birnbaum) was used to detect proteins from whole cell lysates, and polyclonal rabbit anti-human CD71 (H-300; Santa Cruz Biotechnology., Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was used to detect the human and site-mutagenized receptors in membrane preparations. Rat anti-mouse TfR1 monoclonal antibody MOPC-315 (RDI, Flanders, NJ) was used to detect the mouse receptor. Different antisera/antibodies were used because the recognized epitopes were not present in all the chimeric proteins (see “Results”). For whole cell lysates and membrane preparations, the blots were stripped and probed with anti-mouse β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or anti-Na+K+ ATPase (Abcam, Inc., Cambridge, MA) as loading controls. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis for TfR1 was performed as previously described (23Hemmi H. Kaisho T. Takeuchi O. Sato S. Sanjo H. Hoshino K. Horiuchi T. Tomizawa H. Takeda K. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar). Chimeric and Mutant Receptor Construction—Chimeras of the human and mouse TfR1 were prepared as diagrammed in Fig. 5, using gene splicing by overlap extension (24Warrens A.N. Jones M.D. Lechler R.I. Gene. 1997; 186: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Details of the primers used for this method are available upon request. The cloned human and mouse receptor clone cDNAs served as the initial templates for construction of chimeras 1-3; chimeras 5-16 used chimera 3 as the backbone. All the chimeras were cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) and sequenced to verify the alterations. Site-directed mutagenesis on chimeras 15 and 16 (Fig. 6) was performed with the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Inc., La Jolla, CA).FIGURE 6Site-directed mutants.

Each sequence alignment was submitted to SwissModel (25Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9399) Google Scholar, 26Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Immunology News. 1999; 6: 132-134Google Scholar) to obtain model structures based on the known crystal structure of human TfR1 (Protein Data Bank number 1CX8). Coordinate sets for the mouse, rat, and hamster TfR1 models are available upon request. MMTV Uses Rodent, but Not Other Species, TfR1 for Virus Entry— We previously showed that mouse, but not hamster or human, TfR1 would function as an entry receptor for MMTV (16Ross S.R. Schofield J.J. Farr C.J. Bucan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12386-12390Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Additionally, work by others has shown that rat cells are susceptible to MMTV infection (27Dudley J.P. Varmus H.E. J. Virol. 1981; 39: 207-218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The TfR1 coding regions from a large number of species, including mouse, rat, human, hamster, cat, and dog, have been sequenced and are highly conserved. Comparison of these sequences revealed that the mouse is more highly related to the rat than it is to the human, cat, or dog TfR1s (90% to rat versus ∼76% identity to human, hamster, dog, or cat). We therefore tested whether MMTV could use the cat or dog TfR1 for infection as a means of identifying critical regions in the receptor required for entry. Expression plasmids containing the cloned TfR1 cDNAs from mouse, dog, cat, and human were transfected into 293T cells and tested for receptor expression by a Tf uptake assay (Fig. 1) or Western blot analysis (not shown) and for their ability to support infection of MMTV pseudoviruses (Table 1). Additionally, rat XC cells were tested for infection with MMTV pseudoviruses. Although all receptors supported Tf uptake, only mouse and rat, but not human, cat, or dog, TfR1 allowed infection by MMTV pseudoviruses. This allowed us to begin to define the regions of the mouse TfR1 that might be involved in interaction with the MMTV Env.TABLE 1Species-specific tropism of MMTV entry Tissue culture cells from different species (NMuMG, XC, CHO, 293T) or 293T cells transfected with mammalian expression plasmids containing the murine (mTfR1), human (hTfR1), feline (fTfR1), or canine (cTfR1) cDNAs were tested for infection by MMTV pseudoviruses as previously described (18Zhang Y.

Virol. 2003; 77: 10468-10478Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Cell LineInfectionNMuMG (mouse mammary)+XC (rat hepatoma)+CHO (Chinese hamster ovary)–293T (human embryonic kidney)–293T/mTfR1+293T/hTfR1–293T/fTfR1–293T/cTfR1– Open table in a new tab MMTV Infection Is Not Affected by Tf or HFE—We next tested whether Tf or HFE affected interaction of MMTV with TfR1, because both are known to change receptor conformation (7Bennett M.J. Lebron J.A. Bjorkman P.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 10Giannetti A.M. Bjorkman P.J. J. Biol.

Proteomics. 2005; 4: 1959-1967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, the Tf binding site on TfR1 is highly conserved between species and overlaps the HFE binding site. However, there are differences in the affinity of binding of Tf from one species to the TfR1 of different species (14Shimo-Oka T. Hagiwara Y. Ozawa E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1986; 126: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 15Penhallow R.C. Brown-Mason A. Woodworth R.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1986; 128: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and recent work has indicated that amino acids outside the Tf and HFE binding site on the TfR1 affect their binding (10Giannetti A.M. Bjorkman P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25866-25875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 11Xu G. Liu R. Zak O. Aisen P. Chance M.R. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2005; 4: 1959-1967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, it was also possible that MMTV could interact with TfR1 in the same region as Tf and HFE. We first tested whether Tf competed with MMTV for binding to TfR1, using mouse apo- and mouse and human holo-Tf. MMTV pseudovirions and increasing concentrations of the different Tfs were incubated on ice with TRH3 cells (293T cells stably expressing the mouse TfR1) (18Zhang Y. Rassa J.C. deObaldia E.M. Albritton L. Ross S.R. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 10468-10478Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). There was no significant effect of Tf on MMTV infection, indicating that it did not compete with MMTV for receptor interaction and that any conformational changes induced by Tf binding did not affect the virus's use of TfR1 for entry. Similar results were obtained when apo- or holo-Tf was tested with NMuMG cells expressing the endogenous mouse receptor (not shown). At the highest concentrations of murine holo-Tf, there was at most a 50% reduction in infection levels (Fig. 2A) that could be due to receptor internalization. To further confirm that MMTV and Tf, as well as HFE, bound to different sites on the receptor, we carried out site-directed mutagenesis of the Tf binding site on the mTfR1. Two different mutants were made in the binding site (645YSARGDYF), Y6456A and G650A; both these mutations dramatically reduced Tf uptake (13Dubljevic V. Sali A. Goding J.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and abrogated interaction with HFE (8West Jr., A.P. Giannetti A.M. Herr A.B. Bennett M.J. Nangiana J.S. Pierce J.R. Weiner L.P. Snow P.M. Bjorkman P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 385-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) when introduced into the human TfR1. The mutants were expressed at about the same level as wild-type receptor in transiently transfected cells (Fig. 3A). However, whereas Tf uptake was inhibited in cells expressing either mutant (shown for G650A in Fig. 3B), the mutations had only a marginal effect on MMTV infection, reducing infection by at most 50% (Fig. 3C). Moreover, MMTV infection was not affected by treatment of NMuMG (Fig. 2B) or TRH3 (not shown) cells with the iron chelator desferrioxamine, which reduces extra- and intracellular iron levels (28). In contrast, treatment of either NMuMG or TRH3 cells with 100 μg/ml of ferric ammonium citrate, which decreases receptor levels, reduced infection by ∼80% (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these results indicate that MMTV interacts with TfR1 and infects cells in the presence and absence of Tf and iron. Finally, we tested whether the absence of the HFE molecule, which binds to TfR1 at sites both overlapping and distinct from Tf, affected MMTV infection. Embryonic fibroblasts were prepared from C3H/HeN and β2-μglobulin knock-out (C3H/HeN background) mice and tested for infection with MMTV pseudotypes. Cells from the two mouse strains were infected at similar efficiencies (Fig. 4). Additionally, we tested in vivo infection of β2-μglobulin mice and saw no difference in infection compared with wild-type mice (not shown), as has been previously reported (29Velin D. Acha-Orbea H. Kraehenbuhl J.P. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7250-7254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data indicated that MMTV might interact with a different region of TfR1 than Tf or HFE. Identification of the Site of Interaction of MMTV with TfR1—The data described in the preceding section indicated that MMTV/TfR1 contact was not affected by either Tf or HFE and suggested that the viral envelope protein might interact at a distinct site. Because of the high level of amino acid identity/homology, we made the assumption that the mouse, rat, hamster, cat, dog, and human TfR1 molecules all folded into similar structures and performed sequence comparison of the TfR1s from these species. This analysis showed three potential regions of highest dissimilarity between the different species that, when placed on the crystal structure, indicated they were on the surface of the TfR1 molecule (aa 196-237, aa 247-370, and aa 560-643). Using the human TfR1 molecule as a backbone, we constructed a series of chimeric molecules between the mouse and human TfR1s to determine whether any of the three regions were required for MMTV infection (Fig. 5A). To ensure that the chimeric receptors were expressed at similar levels, we used Tf uptake assays (not shown) and Western blot analysis of both total cell extracts (Figs. 5B and 6B) and partially purified membranes (Fig. 5B). All the chimeric receptors that demonstrated Tf uptake showed similar levels of expression by Western blot analysis. We used rabbit anti-human TfR1 directed against aa 461-760 of the human receptor or monoclonal antibody OKT9, which detects human but not mouse TfR1. The rabbit polyclonal antisera only weakly interacted with region aa 461-760 of the mouse TfR1 (for example, see mouse and chimeras 3 and 4 in Fig. 5B). Moreover, OKT9 only interacted with chimeras that contained human sequence aa 305-366 (i.e. chimeras 6, 9, 11, 12, and 13, but not 5, 7, and 8; Fig. 5B). The chimeras (Fig. 5A, 1-16) that were expressed and supported Tf uptake were then tested for their ability to serve as an MMTV entry receptor. Chimeras 3 and 4, but not 1 and 2, supported MMTV infection, thereby eliminating the first candidate region (aa 196-237) from further consideration and defining the minimum region of mouse TfR1 required to support MMTV between amino acids 238-643 (Fig. 5A). This left two potential areas of interaction, based on their divergent sequence between rodents and other species and their location on the surface of the receptor, amino acids 247-370 and 560-643. Accordingly, we constructed chimera 5 and showed that it functioned as a virus receptor, allowing infection at levels similar to the mouse TfR1. Additional constructs allowed us to map the minimal region required from the mouse TfR1 from amino acids 285-296 (segment 1) and 569-589 (segment 2) (see chimeras 6-11 and 16 in Fig. 5C). Both segments 1 and 2 were required, because chimeras 14 and 15, containing only mouse segment 2 (aa 569-589) or segment 1 (aa 285-296), respectively, did not function as MMTV entry receptors (Fig. 5C). Chimeras 14, 15, and 16 were all expressed at similar levels (Fig. 6B and data not shown). Segments 1 and 2 map to opposing parts of a groove found at the outside edges of the TfR1, a region completely distinct from the Tf and HFE binding site (Fig. 7A). To further define the amino acids important for MMTV Env interaction in segment 1, we carried out site-specific mutagenesis, using chimera 16 as a backbone. Two amino acids in segment 1 of the mouse TfR1, Lys-287 and Asp-296, which are located on either side of conserved loop extending into the pocket (supplemental Fig. S1), were important for MMTV infection, because changing either the former alone to its human counterpart (K287Q) or both simultaneously (K287Q and D296E) reduced infection levels 60 and 87%, respectively (Fig. 6C). To further define the MMTV interaction site in segment 2, we created two additional chimeras, 12 and 13 (Fig. 5A), containing aa 569-577 and 578-589, respectively, as well as segment 1, from the mouse. Chimera 12 functioned weakly as a receptor, supporting pseudovirus infection about 2 orders of magnitude lower than the wild-type mouse or functional chimeric receptors. In contrast, chimera 13 did not support infection. The ability to fully support infection was restored to chimera 12 when amino acids 578 (Glu to Gln), 582 (Glu to Gln), 585 (Lys to Gln), and 589 (Ala to Thr) were all changed from human to mouse (chimera 52 in Fig. 6, A and D). The region of TfR1 containing the RGD sequences that constitute the Tf and HFE binding sites are highly conserved among mouse, rat, human, hamster, cat, and dog, but MMTV was unable to infect cells of any but the first two species. We therefore used the inability of MMTV to infect cells expressing human TfR1 to map the domains required for infection. By comparing the sequences of the mouse, rat, human, cat, and dog TfR1s and placing the regions of greatest dissimilarity on the human crystal structure, we found three potential regions of interaction and constructed mouse/human chimeras to test their role in infection. We were able to determine that two segments were critical determinants of infection, aa 285-296 located within the apical domain and 569-589 found in the membrane-distal region of the protease domain. Although the two segments are distinct on the linear map, in the folded molecule they form opposing sides of a groove or depression located on the surface of the outer edge of the TfR1 dimer and distant from the Tf and HFE binding sites (Fig. 7). To ensure that the chimeric receptors were expressed at similar levels, we used Tf uptake assays and Western blot analysis of both total cell extracts and partially purified membranes. All the chimeric receptors that demonstrated Tf uptake showed similar levels of expression by Western blot analysis. Although it is possible that some of the chimeras were not expressed on the cell surface at the same levels, virus infection can occur when only small amounts of receptor are present (16Ross S.R. Schofield J.J. Farr C.J. Bucan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12386-12390Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). 3A. Sankin and S. Ross, unpublished observations. Indeed, because we used transient transfection to achieve expression of the chimeric TfR1s, all were highly overexpressed relative to the endogenous hTfR1 expressed by 293T cells (compare the no DNA lanes in Figs. 5B and 6B to the lanes containing extracts from transfected cells). Thus, it is likely that the inability of certain chimeras to function as MMTV entry receptors is a reflection of sequence and not level of expression. Mouse and man differ at six of the twelve residues in the first segment (residues 285-296 of human TfR1), yet most of the differences in this segment do not correlate with receptor function. For example, the asparagine at residue 292 in human TfR1 (Asn-292) differs from the glutamate (Glu-294) in the mouse receptor, but non-susceptible hamster cells also have a glutamate in this position. Further, the third and last residues in this segment differ between the mouse and rat even though the virus infects both species. To understand this discordance we mod"

Pseudoknot 1 (pk1), immediately upstream of this coding region in tmRNA, is a structural element that is considered essential for tmRNA function based on the analysis of pk1 mutants in vitro. pk1 binds near the ribosomal decoding site and may make base-specific contacts with tmRNA ligands. To study pk1 structure and function in vivo, we have developed a genetic selection that ties the life of Escherichia coli cells to tmRNA activity. Mutation of pk1 at 20% per base and selection for tmRNA activity yielded sequences that retain the same pseudoknot fold. In contrast, selection of active mutants from 106 completely random sequences identified hairpin structures that functionally replace pk1. Rational design of a hairpin with increased stability using an unrelated sequence yielded a tmRNA mutant with nearly wild-type activity. We conclude that the role of pk1 in tmRNA function is purely structural and that it can be replaced with a variety of hairpin structures. Our results demonstrate that in the study of functional RNAs, the inactivity of a mutant designed to destroy a given structure should not be interpreted as proof that the structure is necessary for RNA function. Such mutations may only destabilize a global fold that could be formed equally well by an entirely different, stable structure. tmRNA rescues stalled ribosomes in eubacteria by forcing the ribosome to abandon its mRNA template and resume translation with tmRNA itself as a template.

This dual-function RNA acts as both tRNA and mRNA to rescue ribosomes stalled on broken templates or at certain nascent peptide sequences (3Hayes C.S. Bose B. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33825-33832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Aminoacylated tmRNA enters the A-site of stalled ribosomes and transfers alanine to the growing peptide chain as would a normal tRNA. The ribosome then resumes translation with tmRNA as the template, adding a 10-amino-acid tag to the nascent polypeptide. As a result of tmRNA action, stalled ribosomes are released and recycled, and the aborted protein product is marked for destruction by proteases (1Karzai A.W. Roche E.D. Sauer R.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 2Withey J.H. Friedman D.I. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57: 101-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In the trans-translation model of tmRNA function described above, the ribosome switches templates while synthesizing a single polypeptide. How does tmRNA position itself inside the ribosome for translation to resume in the correct frame? The global fold of tmRNA places the first codon near the decoding center of the ribosome; a short single-stranded sequence immediately upstream of this initial codon determines the precise frame (4Williams K.P. Martindale K.A. Bartel D.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5423-5433Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 5Lee S. Ishii M. Tadaki T. Muto A. Himeno H. RNA (N.

The global structure of tmRNA is dominated by several pseudoknot structures surrounding the tag-encoding sequence (7Williams K.P. Bartel D.P. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 1306-1310PubMed Google Scholar, 8Felden B. Himeno H. Muto A. McCutcheon J.P. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. RNA (N. Y.). 1997; 3: 89-103PubMed Google Scholar). The Escherichia coli tmRNA, for example, has four pseudoknots (see Fig. 1). Only 11 nucleotides upstream of the resume codon, pseudoknot 1 (pk1), may be involved with positioning the template in the ribosomal A-site. The cryoelectron microscopy structure of the 70 S ribosome bound to tmRNA, and its partner protein SmpB reveals that although pk2-4 are looped around the beak of the 30 S subunit without forming extensive contacts with the ribosome, pk1 is bound intimately between the beak and the decoding center on the 30 S subunit (9Valle M. Gillet R. Kaur S. Henne A. Ramakrishnan V. Frank J. Science. 2003; 300: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Valle et al. (9Valle M. Gillet R. Kaur S. Henne A. Ramakrishnan V. Frank J. Science. 2003; 300: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) speculate that pk1 is pulled toward the decoding center as tmRNA transitions from the initial binding complex visualized by cryoelectron microscopy to full accommodation in the A-site resulting in Ala transfer and tmRNA translocation to the ribosomal P-site. In vitro studies support the conclusion that pk1 plays a crucial role in tmRNA function. Although pk2-4 are dispensable for trans-translation in vitro, replacing pk1 with single-stranded sequence destroys tmRNA function (10Nameki N. Tadaki T. Himeno H. Muto A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Mutations designed to disrupt the base pairing of pseudoknot 1 helices reduce tmRNA-mediated tagging dramatically (11Nameki N. Felden B. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Himeno H. Muto A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 733-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The alteration of single-stranded loop sequences lowers activity, leading to proposals that these nucleotides form Mg2+ binding sites (11Nameki N. Felden B. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Himeno H. Muto A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 733-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) or make base-specific contacts with the ribosome (12Nameki N. Chattopadhyay P. Himeno H. Muto A. Kawai G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). One limitation in the study of the trans-translation system has been the lack of a robust in vivo selection for tagging activity. The ssrA gene that encodes tmRNA in E. coli is not essential for growth under laboratory conditions (2Withey J.H. Friedman D.I. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57: 101-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). One report of a genetic selection takes advantage of tmRNA-mediated tagging and proteolysis of the Arc repressor, allowing derepression of the kanR gene and survival on kanamycin (4Williams K.P. Martindale K.A. Bartel D.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5423-5433Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The authors characterized 2451 colonies by replica plating and reported high background (∼0.1%); this screen is not robust enough to search through large collections of mutants (libraries) of tmRNA or other components of the tagging machinery. To extend the study of tmRNA structure and function to a relevant in vivo context, we have created a genetic selection that ties tmRNA function to the life of an E. coli cell. This selection allows the characterization of millions of mutants of tmRNA in a single experiment. Here we describe the application of this selection to identifying the structural and functional requirements for pseudoknot 1. How does the pk1 sequence determine its structure and what role does pk1 play in positioning tmRNA correctly inside the ribosome for resumption of translation on tmRNA? DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized on an ABI Expedite 8909 or purchased from Sigma-Genosys. Enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. Plasmid Construction—The tmRNA-K1 plasmid expresses the altered tmRNA gene from its own (ssrA) promoter on a low copy (p15A) origin with a tetracycline resistance marker. It was created by altering the tag sequence (ANDENYALAA) to code for the last 14 amino acids of KanR (ANKLQFHLMLDEFF). Nucleotides 90-137 of tmRNA, from the resume codon to the end of helix 5, were replaced with the sequence GCAAATAAACTGCAGTTTCATTTGATGCTCGATGAGTTCTTCTAATAACAGAATCTCATC. This sequence creates a stem-loop structure similar to helix 5 following the tag template. It contains a PstI cleavage site for cloning mutant pk1 regions immediately upstream. The tmRNA-K1 plasmid was created by PCR amplification of pKW11 (13Roche E.D. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28509-28515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) using the primers GAGCATCAAATGAAACTGCAGTTTATTTGCGACTATTTTTTGCGGCTTTTTAC and GATGAGTTCTTCTAATAACAGAATCTCATCCCTCTCTCCCTAGCCTCC, followed by phosphorylation and blunt end ligation. Truncated kanR constructs were expressed from the araBAD promoter on a multicopy (pBR322 origin) vector with a β-lactamase marker. The first version of the selection, used in the 20% mutagenesis of wild-type pk1, induced stalling with the sequence Pro255-Pro256-Opal. The kanR-DPP plasmid was cloned by the amplification of the kanR gene with primers CATATGGCTAGCATGAGCCATATTCAACGGGAAAC and CGGCTTTTTCAAAAATATGGTATTGATCCGCCTTGAGAATTCGAGCTC, digestion with NheI and EcoRI, and ligation into the pBAD-GFP vector. To combine the two plasmids into a single selection vector, the tmRNA expression cassette was PCR-amplified from tmRNA-K1 with primers CCGCTACGGTCCGAGAACTGTGAATGCGCAAACC and TAGCGAAGATCTTAAATCCTGGTGTCCCTGTTG. The kanR-DPP plasmid was PCR-amplified with primers CGACCGAGATCTTCGCTACGTGACTGGGTCATG and AGTTCTCGGACCGTAGCGGAGTGTATACTGGCTTAAC. These fragments were digested with BglII and RsrII and ligated together. QuikChange mutagenesis and removal of SphI and PstI sites from the resulting plasmid, pBad-KT2, allow these unique sites surrounding the pseudoknot 1 sequence to be used for cloning. The sequence GAATAGAGGCCTTCAACTCCGCGGATACTA was then inserted between SphI and PstI, replacing wild-type pk1, and making tmRNA inactive. This “dummy insert” also provides StuI and SacII sites to assist in library creation. A second, more active version of the selection vector was generated by replacing the C-terminal amino acids Asp254-Pro255-Pro256 (kanR-DPP) with Ser254-Glu255-Pro256 in the truncated kanR gene. This kanR-SEP sequence was discovered by cloning six random codons after Ile253 of the truncated kanRΔ15 gene in pBad-KT2 and selecting for kanamycin resistance under more stringent conditions: 37 °C and 15 μg/ml kanamycin. Addition of a chloramphenicol resistance cassette into the BglII site provided a second antibiotic marker to reduce contamination, yielding the plasmid p16Dum-Cat. tmRNA expression vectors for the bacteriophage assays were created by PCR amplification of the pKW11 plasmid and blunt end cloning. The procedure was similar to that described above to make tmRNA-K1, except that no change was made to the tag template; the only difference from wild-type tmRNA is the pseudoknot 1 sequence. The ΔssrA control was made by removing the entire tmRNA sequence by digestion of pKW11 with NcoI and EcoRI, followed by treatment with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I to create blunt ends for religation. The pk1 sequences are as follows: 50CUC, CCTCGGGCGGTTGGCCTCGTAAAAAGCCGC; pk1L, CGAGGGCCGC; M20, AAAAGCGTCCCGTTAGGGACGGTGGGAATA; M20-2, AAAAGCATCCCGTTAGGGATGTTGGGATA; RD2, AAACAGCCCGGGGAACCGGGCTGAATAAA. Selection of Mutant pk1 Libraries—The conservative mutagenesis of pk1 was accomplished by mutating the 30 nucleotides of pk1 at 20% per base. The oligonucleotide CAAGGTGCATGCCGAGGGGCGGTTGGCCTCGTAAAAAGCCGCAAAAAATAGTCGCAAATAAACTGCAGTTTCAT was synthesized with mixed phosphoramidites incorporated into the positions underlined. These mixes included 80% of the wild-type base and ∼7% each of the other three bases. A short primer bound to a constant 3′-region was extended by the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I to generate double-stranded DNA. This DNA was cleaved by SphI and PstI and ligated into the pBad-KT2 vector, and the plasmid library was introduced into DH10B by electroporation. Following plasmid purification, the resulting library was introduced into the selection strain, X90 ssrA::cat (14Keiler K.C. Waller P.R. Sauer R.T. Science. 1996; 271: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). The cells were induced with 2% arabinose for 3 h at 30 °C, plated onto media containing ampicillin, 2% arabinose, and 15 μg/ml kanamycin, and grown for 48 h at 25 °C. The second library, with fully randomized pk1 sequences, was generated in a similar manner except it incorporated N30 (25% each base) in place of the underlined sequence above. This library was cloned into the second generation selection vector p16Dum-Cat and selected as above. The third library, with 20% mutagenesis of M20, replaced the underlined sequence with mixed phosphoramidites as above but based on the M20 sequence. The mutant inserts were cloned into p16Dum-Cat and selected on media containing ampicillin, 2% arabinose, and 50 μg/ml kanamycin at 25 °C. Surviving clones from these libraries were recloned, transformed into fresh cells, grown up from single colonies, and reassayed under selection conditions to ensure that the tmRNA mutant in question is responsible for the tagging activity. Phage Efficiency of Plating (EOP) Assays—X90 ssrA::cat cells carrying a pKW11-derivative expressing pk1 mutants of tmRNA were grown overnight in media with tetracycline at 37 °C. The cells were washed in 2× YT media, diluted, and grown in 2× YT with 10 mm MgSO4 for 3 h at 37 °C to an A600 of ∼1. The cells were then washed with 10 mm MgSO4, resuspended to an A600 of 0.5, and measured out into 200-μl aliquots. 1 μl of phage λimmP22 c2-dis at various dilutions was added to an aliquot, incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, mixed with 3 ml of top agar (2× YT, 10 mm MgSO4, and 0.7% agarose), and grown overnight at 37 °C. Plaques on tmRNA mutants were smaller than those formed on wild-type tmRNA-containing cells as reported previously (15Withey J. Friedman D. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2148-2157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The number of plaques were counted for four different trials as reported in Fig. 5. Development of a Selection for tmRNA Activity—The function of tmRNA in vivo is to tag mistranslated proteins with an 11-amino-acid sequence. If this tag could be altered to confer protein function rather than proteolysis, the activity of the tagged protein would reflect the level of tmRNA function. To provide a genetic selection, the protein must be required for cell survival and have essential residues in its C-terminal 10-20 amino acids. In the absence of tmRNA activity, the truncated protein would be inactive, and the cells would die; in the presence of an active tmRNA variant, the protein could be tagged with the essential amino acids to form a functional enzyme and confer cell survival (Fig. 2). The selection protein we chose is the E. coli kanamycin resistance protein (KanR). Analysis of the homologous Aph(3′)-IIIa·kanamycin co-crystal structure (Fig. 2) reveals that the C-terminal helix of 15 residues (shown in red) plays an important role both structurally and catalytically in binding the substrate (16Fong D.H. Berghuis A.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2323-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Deletion of these residues leads to loss of function; cells expressing the KanR C-terminal deletion (kanRΔ15) show no more kanamycin resistance than cells lacking the kanR gene. Natural tmRNA sequences encoding the peptide tag vary in length and composition and can be altered without loss of function (13Roche E.D. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28509-28515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 17Gueneau de Novoa P. Williams K.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D104-D108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We replaced the natural tag template with a sequence encoding ANKLQFHLMLDEFF and expressed tmRNA from its own promoter from the tmRNA-K1 plasmid. Following transfer of Ala from the tmRNA itself, the addition of these 14 residues encoded by tmRNA restores the missing 15 amino acids that make up the C-terminal helix of KanR. We found that the identity of the resume codon was an important factor; GCA was significantly more active than AUG, the wild-type kanR codon (data not shown). All known tmRNA template sequences contain GNN resume codons (17Gueneau de Novoa P. Williams K.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D104-D108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Presumably G at this position is important for the recognition of the proper frame for reinitiation of translation by the ribosome. For the altered tag to complete the KanR protein correctly, ribosomes must stall at exactly the right position on the kanRΔ15 mRNA. Ribosomes stall during termination at inefficient stop codons such as the opal codon (UGA) when the protein sequence terminates in proline (3Hayes C.S. Bose B. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33825-33832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The E. coli YbeL protein, for example, ends in Glu-Pro-(Opal) and is tagged with good efficiency (up to 40%) by tmRNA precisely at the position of the stop codon (3Hayes C.S. Bose B. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33825-33832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Two mutations in kanRΔ15, N255E, and Met257Opal, create a Glu-Pro-(Opal) sequence in the kanR mRNA that acts as a signal to induce ribosome stalling, yielding the kanR-SEP selection gene. Based on the structure of Aph(3′)-IIIa, the KanR protein is expected to have a surface-exposed loop of five residues, ending in Pro256, preceding the C-terminal helix (16Fong D.H. Berghuis A.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2323-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This loop permits the introduction of the Glu-Pro-Ala scar introduced by these changes and transfer of Ala from aminoacylated tmRNA without affecting KanR function. Tagging of the truncated KanR polypeptides on stalled ribosomes by the altered tmRNA generates full-length, functional KanR protein, conferring kanamycin resistance to cells. We co-transformed an E. coli strain lacking tmRNA with the kanR-SEP and tmRNA-K1 plasmids. When plated onto media containing 15 μg/ml kanamycin, all of the co-transformants survive at 37 °C. Under the same conditions, bacteria with kanR-SEP but lacking the modified tmRNA-K1 survive at the level of 5 colony forming units in 107 plated. The enrichment ratio is roughly a factor of 103 better than the previous genetic selection for tmRNA function (4Williams K.P. Martindale K.A. Bartel D.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5423-5433Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Conservative Mutagenesis of pk1—This genetic selection for transtranslation provides a method to rapidly identify active tmRNA sequences from libraries of millions of mutants. Conserved bases in the sequences of active mutants reveal which positions contain information required for function. This strategy of mutagenesis and selection was used to characterize the relationship of the pk1 sequence to its structure and function. In creating a library of pk1 mutants, we biased the sequences toward the wild-type pk1 sequence to retain the overall pk1 fold thought to be required for tmRNA function. We randomized the sequence of pk1 at the rate of 20% per base (see “Materials and Methods”). Analysis of mutants prior to selection revealed that an average of seven mutations were introduced at random positions in the 30 nucleotides of pk1. The library of ∼4 × 107 tmRNA mutants was introduced with the selection gene into an E. coli strain lacking tmRNA. Following selection at 25 °C on 15 μg/ml kanamycin, 104-105 colonies survived. The comparison of 67 pk1 sequences from the selected tmRNAs gives a clear picture of what positions are tolerant to mutation. The average number of mutations per pk1 sequence was 1.4, significantly lower than the average of 7 in preselection sequences. This was expected given the sensitivity of the pk1 structure to mutation. The results in Fig. 3 indicate the information required at each position by the total height (e.g. position 61 has low information content and is very tolerant of mutations). Because the greatest possible mutagenesis at each position is 20%, the sequence is heavily biased toward the wild-type sequence. The information content is therefore artificially inflated and the differences are more significant than they appear. The two helical regions, stem 1 (nucleotides 49-53 and 63-67) and stem 2 (nucleotides 55-59 and 74-78), are not equally important in the pk1 structure (Fig. 3). Stem 1 is absolutely invariant, with all the selected clones maintaining all five possible base pairs. The wobble pair introduced by the mutation A51G is active; likewise, mutations at the other positions are always accompanied by covarying mutations that re-establish the base pair (e.g. G50C and C66G). In contrast, only three of the five base pairs of stem 2 are conserved; uncompensated mutations of the outer G55-C78 and U59-G74 base pairs are tolerated. Contrary to conclusions based on in vitro work (11Nameki N. Felden B. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Himeno H. Muto A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 733-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 12Nameki N. Chattopadhyay P. Himeno H. Muto A. Kawai G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), loop 2 (nucleotides 60-62) can be mutated in vivo without affecting trans-translation. The earlier finding that loop 2 mutants form pseudoknots but display inhibited activity led to the speculation that these bases form an Mg2+ or ribosome binding site. The strict requirement for G or U at position 61 and G at 62 in vitro was not observed in our in vivo assay; G61C and G62U mutants were viable. There is disagreement in the literature whether or not the first nucleotide in loop 2, U60, pairs with A73 to extend stem 2 by one base pair (7Williams K.P. Bartel D.P. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 1306-1310PubMed Google Scholar, 8Felden B. Himeno H. Muto A. McCutcheon J.P. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. RNA (N. Y.). 1997; 3: 89-103PubMed Google Scholar, 11Nameki N. Felden B. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Himeno H. Muto A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 733-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Chemical probing showed that U60 is accessible, but A73 is protected from modifications (11Nameki N. Felden B. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Himeno H. Muto A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 733-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Similarly, our findings suggest that U60 can be mutated to the other bases without loss of function, but A73 is highly conserved. We propose that U60 is unpaired and is part of loop 2, whereas A73 forms interactions elsewhere. The conservation of the adenosines in loop 3 (nucleotides 69-73) is striking, particularly at the 3′-end of that sequence. Analysis of the pseudoknot data base shows that adenosine is highly enriched in loop 3 of pseudoknots (63.9% A) particularly at the 3′-end (18Aalberts D.P. Hodas N.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 2210-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These adenosines may make A-minor motif interactions (19Nissen P. Ippolito J.A. Ban N. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4899-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) with the stem 1 helix, as seen in the high-resolution structures of several pseudoknots (20Su L. Chen L. Egli M. Berger J.M. Rich A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 21Michiels P.J. Versleijen A.A. Verlaan P.W. Pleij C.W. Hilbers C.W. Heus H.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Such interactions are consistent with the in vitro finding that mutations in loop 3 destabilize stem 1 in tmRNA pk1 (11Nameki N. Felden B. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Himeno H. Muto A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 733-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Formation of A-minor motif interactions may place constraints on the sequence of stem 1, particularly the G52-C64 and G53-C63 pairs. These positions are invariant in all of our analyzed sequences. Construction of a covariant mutant (G49U51C53-G63A65C67) that alters these base-pairing patterns in stem 1 did not restore activity in vitro (11Nameki N. Felden B. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Himeno H. Muto A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 733-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Random Mutagenesis of pk1—Having learned what the requirements are for pk1 to fold correctly, we wondered whether more radical mutations could form alternate structures that function in place of pk1. To isolate active sequences far away in sequence space from wild-type pk1, we created a library of 1 × 106 mutants in which the entire pk1 sequence was completely randomized (N30). This library covered but a tiny fraction of the theoretical diversity of 430 or ∼1018. Following selection at 25 °C on 15 μg/ml kanamycin, roughly 50 colonies survived. Sequencing of tmRNA sequences revealed that these mutants bear no resemblance to the wild-type pk1 sequence. None form pseudoknot structures by inspection or analysis by the prediction software pknotsRG-mfe (22Reeder J. Giegerich R. BMC Bioinformatics. 2004; 5: 104Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Instead, the mutant structures are predicted by the mfold algorithm (23Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10302) Google Scholar) to form simple hairpin-loop structures (e.g. mutant M20, Fig. 4). All mfold free energy calculations and structural predictions were performed at 37 °C. The activity of mutants like M20 that replace pk1 with a hairpin shows that pk1 is not required for tmRNA activity. M20 is significantly less active than wild-type tmRNA but fails to confer resistance to high kanamycin concentrations (50 μg/ml) or at higher temperatures (37 °C), conditions under which cells containing wild-type tmRNA display 100% survival. To create a second generation library, we mutated the M20 sequence at 20% per base over the 30 nucleotides replacing the pk1 sequence. A library of 2 × 106 M20 derivatives was subjected to selection on plates containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin (kan50) at 25 °C. Of the eight surviving clones, M20-2 is the most active, with 100% survival on kan50 at 25 °C and 50% survival on kan15 at 37 °C. The predicted secondary structure of M20-2 contains two more base pairs than its M20 parent and is predicted to be slightly more stable thermodynamically (-12.4 kJ/mol versus -11.5 kJ/mol, respectively). Quantification of pk1 Mutant Activity—Our initial analyses of M20 and M20-2 function were performed with the KanR assay and in the tmRNA context (a mutated tag sequence) in which the mutants were evolved. To correlate our assay with others in the literature and to obtain more quantitative measures of the activity of the mutants, we introduced the evolved pk1 sequences into otherwise wild-type tmRNA (containing the natural template encoding ANDENYALAA). tmRNA activity was measured by the efficiency of plaque formation by the hybrid bacteriophage λimmP22 c2-dis. This phage only forms plaques on bacteria with intact trans-translation systems (2Withey J.H. Friedman D.I. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57: 101-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 15Withey J. Friedman D. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2148-2157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); cells expressing wild-type tmRNA from a low copy plasmid (pKW11) support the growth of ∼1 × 105 more plaques than cells expressing no tmRNA. In addition to the wild-type and ΔssrA controls, we assayed two pk1 mutants that were characterized previously in vitro. The first, pk1L, replaces pk1 with a single-stranded sequence CGAGGGCCGC. This mutant is from the study reporting that although pk2, pk3, and pk4 were dispensable for tmRNA function in vitro, pk1 was essential (10Nameki N. Tadaki T. Himeno H. Muto A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The second, 50CUC, maintains the pk1 sequence but is designed to destroy the folding of stem 1 by preventing the core three bases from pairing. The 50CUC mutant displays a 10-fold reduction in activity in vitro (11Nameki N. Felden B. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Himeno H. Muto A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 733-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). EOP assays reveal that these two mutants are indistinguishable from the tmRNA knock-out, ΔssrA (Fig. 5). As measured by this assay, a missing or misfolded pk1 region renders tmRNA completely inactive in vivo. The M20 clone evolved from random sequence is ∼1000-fold more active than the missing or misfolded pk1 controls, suggesting that its hairpin structure is sufficient to restore tmRNA stability and function (Fig. 5). M20 is, however, ∼100-fold weaker than wild-type tmRNA. The M20-2 second-round clone shows an activity 4-fold higher than M20. The cutoff for survival in the high stringency KanR assay must therefore lie between M20 and M20-2 activity. The fact that the improved M20-2 mutant has more predicted base pairs and thermodynamic stability led to the hypothesis that further improvements in stability of the hairpin could improve activity. If a hairpin structure is all that is required to replace the wild-type pk1, perhaps there is nothing special about the hairpins that we evolved, and any stable hairpin structure could functionally replace pk1. To test these hypotheses, we rationally designed an eight-base-pair stem with a tetraloop, utilizing a sequence substantially different from the evolved M20 and M20-2 clones. This rationally designed hairpin, RD2, is predicted to be significantly more stable (-19.8 kJ/mol versus -11.5 kJ/mol) than the M20 hairpin (23Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10302) Google Scholar). EOP assays show that RD2 is nearly as active as wild-type tmRNA, 29-fold more active than M20 (Fig. 5). These findings suggest that the stability of the structure replacing pseudoknot 1 plays an key role in the overall function of tmRNA mutants but that the specific sequence used is not as important. Previous in vitro studies suggest that tmRNA pseudoknot 1 (pk1) is essential to the tagging function in trans-translation. It must form a pseudoknot structure (10Nameki N. Tadaki T. Himeno H. Muto A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 11Nameki N. Felden B. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Himeno H. Muto A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 733-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), may make specific contacts to the ribosome (12Nameki N. Chattopadhyay P. Himeno H. Muto A. Kawai G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and may play a role in positioning the template region of tmRNA near the decoding center for proper continuation of translation (9Valle M. Gillet R. Kaur S. Henne A. Ramakrishnan V. Frank J. Science. 2003; 300: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), although the precise choice of frame is determined by the single-stranded sequence between the resume codon and pk1 (4Williams K.P. Martindale K.A. Bartel D.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5423-5433Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 5Lee S. Ishii M. Tadaki T. Muto A. Himeno H. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 999-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 6Lim V.I. Garber M.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To study the requirements for pk1 structure and its relation to tmRNA function in vivo, we developed a genetic selection that ties the life of an E. coli cell to tmRNA activity. KanR polypeptides lacking an essential C-terminal sequence are stalled on ribosomes; if rescued by an altered tmRNA that codes for the missing amino acids, the ribosomes produce full-length, functional KanR, and the cell survives on kanamycin plates. Cells lacking tmRNA activity are killed. This selection provides the means to identify rare active mutants among large libraries of tmRNA, giving 106-fold enrichment of active sequences. Work is also underway to use this genetic selection to characterize other components of the trans-translation process. The generation of two libraries with different levels of mutagenesis yields apparently contradictory conclusions. The first library, generated by a conservative mutagenesis scheme (20% per base), supports the previous in vitro findings that mutations that destabilize the pseudoknot structure of pk1 destroy tmRNA activity. Very few mutations were tolerated; the stem 1 region allowed covarying mutations only, maintaining all five of its base pairs, whereas stem 2 allowed the loss of its outer two base pairs. The U60G61G62 bases of loop 2 are tolerant to mutation, suggesting that they do not form critical Mg2+ binding sites or bind external ligands such as ribosomal components as previously proposed (11Nameki N. Felden B. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Himeno H. Muto A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 733-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 12Nameki N. Chattopadhyay P. Himeno H. Muto A. Kawai G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). U60 does not pair with A73, instead, A73 and other conserved adenine bases at the 3′-end of loop 3 probably form A-minor motif interactions with the end of stem 1. These findings about the sequence requirements of the pk1 structure add a new layer of detail to what was previously known but are largely consistent with previous in vitro findings. They reinforce the idea that a well folded pseudoknot 1 structure is essential to tmRNA function. In contrast, results from the second library, in which pk1 was replaced by completely random sequence (N30), support the conclusion that any stable secondary structure is sufficient. Rare mutants were isolated that substitute hairpin-loop structures in place of pk1. A second round of mutagenesis and selection improved the activity of the best of these clones, M20, by increasing hairpin stability (mutant M20-2). Rational design of an even more stable hairpin, using an unrelated sequence, created a mutant (RD2), which is nearly as active as wild-type tmRNA. The sequence of the hairpin appears to be much less important than its thermodynamic stability. These surprising results were confirmed with a standard EOP assay using phage λimmP22 c2-dis. This assay demonstrates that our results are not because of an artifact of the KanR assay or the altered tmRNA tag sequence used in the selection. What is the resolution of these apparently paradoxical conclusions? Low levels of mutagenesis of the wild-type pk1 sequence either destroys or retains the pk1 fold, but total randomization allows alternate stable structures far away in sequence space to be identified. We propose that the only requirement for the pk1 region of tmRNA is that it forms a stable structure that prohibits other deleterious global misfolding events. Alternate stable conformations were detected by NMR and denaturation profiles previously in vitro (11Nameki N. Felden B. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Himeno H. Muto A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 733-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 12Nameki N. Chattopadhyay P. Himeno H. Muto A. Kawai G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar); the role of stable pseudoknots is probably to prevent these structures from folding. A pseudoknot structure is not necessary however. This finding has important consequences for mutational analyses of structures in functional RNAs. The inactivity of a mutant designed to destroy a given structure does not logically require that the structure is necessary for function, as is too often assumed. The mutation may cause global folding problems that in turn render the molecule inactive. This does not prove that the given structure could not be replaced by a stable structure quite different from itself. In our case, the inactivity of a mutant pseudoknot does not prove that the structure has to be a pseudoknot; it only demonstrates that the region in question must form a stable fold. Stability and global folding should therefore be an important consideration in designing mutations to test hypotheses about the role of specific structures in RNA and in interpreting such studies. Our findings also highlight the importance of analyzing a large number of mutants and the power of genetic approaches to do so in an efficient manner.

Here we show that in polarized epithelial cells, ARNO is localized exclusively to the apical plasma membrane, where it regulates endocytosis. Expression of ARNO stimulates apical endocytosis of the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor, and coexpression of ARF6 with ARNO leads to a synergistic stimulation of apical endocytosis. Expression of a dominant negative ARF6 mutant, ARF6-T27N, antagonizes this stimulatory effect. Deletion of the N-terminal coiled-coil (CC) domain of ARNO causes the mutant ARNO to localize to both the apical and basolateral plasma membranes. Expression of the CC domain alone abolishes ARNO-induced apical endocytosis as well as co-localization of IgA-receptor complexes with ARNO and clathrin. These results suggest that the CC domain contributes to the specificity of apical localization of ARNO through association with components of the apical plasma membrane. We conclude that ARNO acts together with ARF6 to regulate apical endocytosis. ARNO is a guanine-nucleotide exchange protein for the ARF family of GTPases.

Class I includes ARFs 1-3, which function primarily in the Golgi and endosomes. Class II contains ARFs 4 and 5, whose functions are poorly understood. ARF6, the sole representative of class III, has been found to be involved in endocytosis and postendocytic recycling (5Claing A. Biochem.

Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2257-2267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) at the apical plasma membrane (PM) of epithelial cells controls the concentration of diverse apical PM transport proteins, which mediate the exchange of materials between the organism and the outside world (22Mostov K.E. Verges M. Altschuler Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Apical CME is thus highly regulated by numerous extracellular signals and intracellular signaling pathways. Previously, we reported that in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells, ARF6 is localized exclusively to the apical PM, where it controls CME (23Altschuler Y. Liu S.-H. Katz L. Tang K. Hardy S. Brodsky F. Mostov K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). When a constitutively active ARF6 mutant (ARF6-Q67L) is expressed in MDCK cells, it is found exclusively at the apical membrane and strongly stimulates CME. A dominant inhibitory mutant ARF6-T27N also stimulates apical endocytosis, although far less potently than ARF6-Q67L.Like other small GTPases, ARF6 cycles between an active GTP-bound form and an inactive GDP-bound form. However, ARF6 is unusual because it remains associated with membranes in its inactive form (24Gaschet J. Hsu V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20040-20045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 25Macia E. Luton F. Partisani M. Cherfils J. Chardin P. Franco M. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2389-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Activation of ARFs relies on a large and diverse family of guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), referred to as the Sec7 family (1Chavrier P. Goud B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Diversity within the Sec7 family derives from differences both within and outside of the 200-amino acid catalytic domain (26Jackson C.L. Casanova J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 60-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Among the 15 ARF GEFs in the human genome, the ARNO/cytohesin, EFA6, and BRAG subfamilies contain pleckstrin homology (PH) domains that regulate their association with the plasma membrane and thus are candidates to catalyze ARF6 nucleotide exchange in vivo.Based on in vitro studies, ARNO/cytohesins, EFA6A, and GEP100/BRAG2 have all been suggested to activate ARF6 (27Franco M. Peters P.J. Boretto J. van Donselaar E. Neri A. D'Souza-Schorey C. Chavrier P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1480-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 28Someya A. Sata M. Takeda K. Pacheco-Rodriguez G. Ferrans V.J. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2413-2418Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). It is likely that each of these GEFs mediates ARF6 activation at different subcellular sites or in different cell types. Localization of each GEF within cells is presumably determined by structural elements outside the catalytic domain. Apart from the C-terminal PH domain, members of the ARNO/cytohesin subfamily contain a coiled-coil (CC) domain at their N terminus that mediates homodimerization and also participates in other protein/protein interactions. At least three proteins have been identified that interact with the CC domain of ARNO family members GRASP, CASP, and IPCEF (29Nevrivy D.J. Peterson V.J. Avram D. Ishmael J.E. Hansen S.G. Dowell P.

Both CASP and IPCEF have been shown to co-migrate to the PM together with ARNO in response to epidermal growth factor stimulation (31Mansour M. Lee S.Y. Pohajdak B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32302-32309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 32Venkateswarlu K. J. Biol.

Brown D. Bourgoin S. Casanova J.E. Vinay P. Ausiello D.A. Marshansky V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18540-18550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). ARF1 was localized to both the Golgi and apical domain, whereas ARF6 was found exclusively apically in these cells. In addition, both ARNO and ARF6 in proximal tubule cells appear to translocate from the cytosol to endosomes in a manner that is dependent on endosome acidification. In polarized MDCK cells, EFA6 localizes to the apical domain and participates in tight-junction formation by regulating the association of the tight junction with the apical actin ring (34Luton F. Klein S. Chauvin J.P. Le Bivic A. Bourgoin S. Franco M. Chardin P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1134-1145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, within the subapical domain of MDCK as well as in renal proximal tubules, EFA6 was shown to associate with TWIK1, which belongs to the family of K+ channels. This association was stabilized in baby hamster kidney cells by expression of an ARF6-GDP mutant (35Decressac S. Franco M. Bendahhou S. Warth R. Knauer S. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. Lesage F. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 1171-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Given the diversity of localizations and actions reported for ARF6, ARNO, and EFA6, it is vital to determine which GEF is responsible for activation of ARF6 at specific sites in individual cell types. In particular, the unique localization of ARF6 to the apical PM and its function in the regulation of apical CME make the question of how ARF6 is activated a central issue in epithelial cell biology and physiology. Here we report that in polarized epithelial cells ARNO is localized, through its CC domain, exclusively to the apical PM, where it acts to regulate apical endocytosis by activating ARF6.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMost of the methods are described in detail in our recent papers on ARF6 and ARNO (23Altschuler Y. Liu S.-H. Katz L. Tang K. Hardy S. Brodsky F. Mostov K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 36Frank S. Upender S. Hansen S.H. Casanova J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar).Antibodies—The polyclonal rabbit antiserum against human ARNO has been described previously (36Frank S. Upender S. Hansen S.H. Casanova J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). For tissue immunolabeling, this antibody was affinity-purified using a GST-ARNO fusion protein lacking the CC domain of ARNO (residues 2-60). This was necessary as antibodies against the CC epitope cross-reacted with vimentin in both tissues and fixed cells. 9E10 antibody was purchased from Covance (Berkeley CA); FLAG antibody was from Sigma; sheep anti-human secretory IgA was from Cappel Laboratories (Cochranville, PA); and X22 antibody against clathrin heavy chain and TD1 against clathrin light chain were kindly provided by Frances Brodsky (University of California, San Francisco). Secondary antibodies, anti-mouse, and anti-rabbit conjugated to either Alexa 488 or Alexa 594 (minimal reactivity) were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR).Localization of Endogenous ARNO—Tissues from Sprague-Dawley rats were fixed in paraformaldehyde/lysine/periodate by intravascular perfusion. They were then coarsely chopped with a razor blade, further fixed overnight at 4 °C, and then cryoprotected by incubation in 30% sucrose/PBS for 3 h. Tissue slices were then snap-frozen in Tissue-Tec embedding medium, and 5-μm cryosections were prepared using a Reichert cryostat. For immunolabeling, tissues were preblocked in PBS containing 10% normal goat serum and 0.25% saponin and then incubated with primary antibody (10 μg/ml) in blocking buffer for 30 min at room temperature. After washing, samples were incubated for 30 min with Cy2-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Caco-2 monolayers were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and then blocked and labeled as described for tissues.Brush-border (BB) Preparation—Confluent monolayers of Caco-2 cells were scraped from two 10-cm plates in a volume of 2 ml/plate Tris-mannitol buffer (2 mm Tris, pH 7.1, 50 mm mannitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The suspended cells were then sonicated using a Misonix probe sonicator at a setting of 5 for 30 s. CaCl2 was added to a final concentration of 18 mm and the sample incubated on ice for 10 min. Non-BB membranes were then pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 950 × g, and BB membranes were recovered from the supernatant by centrifugation for 40 min at 150,000 × g, 4 °C. Enzymatic assays were conducted on each fraction as described previously (35Decressac S. Franco M. Bendahhou S. Warth R. Knauer S. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. Lesage F. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 1171-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For Na,K-ATPase, activity was quantitated as ouabain-inhibitable phosphate release (37Coppi M.V. Guidotti G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 346: 312-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Exogenous Expression of ARF6 and ARNO—Recombinant adenoviruses expressing ARF6, ARNO, and their mutants were prepared and used to infect filter-grown MDCK cells as described previously (23Altschuler Y. Liu S.-H. Katz L. Tang K. Hardy S. Brodsky F. Mostov K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 36Frank S. Upender S. Hansen S.H. Casanova J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The ARNO-Δcoil mutation was constructed by deleting residues 2-53 in-frame. The CC domain was constructed by PCR amplification of a DNA sequence corresponding to the FLAG tag followed by 62 N-terminal amino acids of ARNO. The level of expression of the exogenous proteins was under the control of the tetracycline-repressible system. We estimate that the level of expression of exogenous ARNO-WT and ARNO-Δcoil was ∼10-20-fold higher than that of endogenous ARNO. A principal source of uncertainty in this measurement is that we do not know precisely how well our antibody against ARNO cross-reacts with the canine ARNO endogenous to MDCK cells. However, we used this antibody to confirm that the expression levels of exogenous ARNO and the mutants used in this report were all reasonably constant, within ∼20%.Immunofluorescence of MDCK Cells—These procedures were performed as described previously (23Altschuler Y. Liu S.-H. Katz L. Tang K. Hardy S. Brodsky F. Mostov K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). As a convenient and reproducible marker for the apical PM, we used either MDCK cells transfected with concentrative nucleoside transporter 1 fused to green fluorescent protein (CNT1-GFP), which we have recently shown to be localized to the apical PM (38Mangravite L.M. Lipschutz J.H. Mostov K.E. Giacomini K.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F879-F885PubMed Google Scholar), or cells labeled at 4 °C with IgA by incubating the cells with cold IgA for 60 min at 4 °C, followed by extensive washes with PBS containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm CaCl2 and fixation. Images were taken using a Bio-Rad confocal or NIKON TE-2000S (Nikon, Melville, NY) inverted fluorescence microscope with a plan Apo 60× objective lens (Nikon), equipped with a Z stepper and a Hamamatsu CCD ORCAII camera (Hamamatsu, Tucson, AZ). Images were all deconvolved with SimplePCI software (Improvision, Coventry, UK). All images were compiled using Adobe Photoshop and/or Canvas software (ACD Systems International Inc., Saanichton, British Columbia, Canada) and are representative of the original data.Assays of Membrane Traffic—Assays of apical and basolateral endocytosis, basolateral to apical transcytosis, and apical recycling, utilized radioiodinated dimeric IgA, bound to the rabbit polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR), which had been stably transfected into the cells. Methods for these assays have been described previously (39Breitfeld P. Casanova J.E. Harris J.M. Simister N.E. Mostov K.E. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 32: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Biosynthetic delivery of proteins to the PM was measured as described (40Reich V. Mostov K. Aroeti B. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2133-2139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Fractionation of MDCK Cells—Subcellular fractionation was modified from a previously described protocol to maintain actin in polymerized form (41Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). Briefly, MDCK cells were grown in 10-cm dishes for 3 days, infected with appropriate recombinant adenoviruses, and incubated for 18 h. Cells were rinsed with cold PBS (containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2), scraped, and resuspended in ice-cold homogenization buffer (100 mm NaCl, 3 mm imidazole, 300 mm sucrose, 20 mm Tris, 1 mm dithiothreitol protease inhibitor mixture, pH 8.0). Cells were homogenized by 80-90 passages through a 27-gauge syringe. Subsequently, the homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g, 4 °C, for 5 min to remove nuclei and large debris. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g, 4 °C, for 30 min to obtain a crude PM fraction. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 165,000 × g,4 °C, for 2 h to obtain a light membrane fraction (endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi) and the supernatant (Cyt) containing the cell cytosol. After each centrifugation, the resulting pellet was rinsed briefly with ice-cold PBS before subsequent fractionations to avoid possible crossover contamination.RESULTSARNO Is Localized to the Apical Surface of Epithelial Cells—We examined the subcellular localization of endogenous ARNO in both rat epithelial sections and the Caco-2 epithelial cell line, as well as by recombinant expression of ARNO in MDCK cells. In rat epithelial sections, ARNO was found primarily at the apical PM, as shown by immunofluorescent staining of sections of rat small intestine (Fig. 1A), kidney proximal tubule (Fig. 1B), submandibular gland (Fig. 1C), and parotid gland (Fig. 1D). This staining is characteristic of the apical PM facing the inner lumen of the tubules. Fig. 3A shows co-staining of endogenous ARNO with the apical marker Ezrin in cultured Caco-2 human intestinal cells. This latter figure illustrates the fine punctate pattern characteristic of apical microvilli in a section taken through the apical PM.FIGURE 3ARNO is found at the apical surface of polarized epithelial MDCK and Caco-2 cells. A, a monolayer of Caco-2 cells was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with affinity-purified anti-ARNO antibody (green) and anti-Ezrin, a brush-border marker. ARNO is shown to completely localize with the apical marker Ezrin. B-E, MDCK Tet-Off cells were uninfected (control) or infected with ARNO-WT (B-D), ARNO-E157A, or ARNO-R280D (E) adenoviruses, incubated for 18 h for expression, and subsequently processed for immunofluorescence. B, series of X-Y confocal sections of cells stained for Myc-tagged exogenous ARNO (green) and anti-tight junction marker ZO-1 (red). The distance (in microns) of the section above or below the center of the ZO-1 staining is indicated on the top left. C-E, section through the apical domain showing co-localization of the apical PM marker CNT1-GFP (green) and either ARNO-WT (C and D) or ARNO mutants (E) (red). D, X-Z confocal section showing co-localization between CNT1-GFP (green) and ARNO (red). E, apical section of MDCK Tet-Off cells expressing the catalytically inactive mutant ARNO-E157A and PH domain-inactive mutant ARNO-R280D (red) stained with the apical marker CNT1-GFP (green). Note that ARNO is localized exclusively to the apical PM, independent of the activities of the Sec7 or PH domains. Bar, 2 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm the apical localization of endogenous ARNO in epithelial cells, we took a biochemical approach in which we isolated a BB membrane fraction from the Caco-2 intestinal cell line. As shown in Fig. 2A, this BB fraction was significantly enriched in the apical marker protein alkaline phosphatase, relative to non-BB membranes, indicating that it is enriched in apical proteins. Immunoblotting of the different fractions revealed that most of the endogenous ARNO is present in the cytosolic fraction, as described previously (36Frank S. Upender S. Hansen S.H. Casanova J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), but the membrane-bound ARNO is detected only in BB membrane fractions and not in the non-BB membrane fractions. Endogenous ARF6 is also enriched in the BB membrane, confirming our previous results that exogenously expressed ARF6 is localized to the apical PM (23Altschuler Y. Liu S.-H. Katz L. Tang K. Hardy S. Brodsky F. Mostov K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Ezrin, a well characterized apical protein, also shows a distribution similar to that of ARNO, confirming correct separation of the membrane into its BB (apical) and basolateral parts (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2ARF6 and ARNO are enriched in BB membranes from Caco-2 cells. A, BB membranes were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Aliquots of total cell lysates, non-BB membranes, BB membranes, and cytosol were analyzed for the presence of the endoplasmic reticulum markerα-glucosidase II, the Golgi markerα-mannosidase, the apical PM marker alkaline phosphatase, or the basolateral PM marker Na,K-ATPase. Note that BB membranes are significantly enriched in alkaline phosphatase activity. B, equivalent amounts of protein from each fraction were immunoblotted with antibodies to Ezrin, ARF6, and ARNO. Fractionation reveals that both ARF6 and ARNO are enriched in the BB fraction, indicating apical PM localization.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next, we determined the localization of recombinant ARNO in MDCK cells. Because our polyclonal antibody fails to detect endogenous ARNO by immunofluorescence in MDCK cells, we expressed exogenous Myc-tagged human ARNO (36Frank S. Upender S. Hansen S.H. Casanova J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) in MDCK cells using a recombinant adenovirus system that incorporates a tetracycline-regulated promoter. In Fig. 3, representative X-Y confocal sections of apical and basolateral focal planes demonstrate that ARNO localizes exclusively to the apical PM and is not detected below the tight junctions on the lateral PM (Fig. 3B). To show that ARNO was precisely at the apical PM, and not in the cytoplasm immediately below it, we performed colocalization with an integral apical PM protein. As an apical marker, we expressed CNT1-GFP, which is an integral protein of the apical PM (38Mangravite L.M. Lipschutz J.H. Mostov K.E. Giacomini K.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F879-F885PubMed Google Scholar). This gave results identical to co-localization with the apical marker GP135 (localized by indirect immunofluorescence) but was more reproducible and convenient. As shown in Fig. 3C, ARNO and CNT1-GFP co-localized precisely. Moreover, we did not detect either endogenous or exogenous ARNO in a perinuclear or supranuclear cytoplasmic location, characteristic of the Golgi in MDCK (Figs. 1 and 3).ARNO in Concert with ARF6 Induces CME at the Apical PM—To examine the function of ARNO in CME at the apical PM, we performed a biochemical endocytosis assay tracing the rate of IgA endocytosis by the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR), which was stably expressed in these cells. In the first experiment, we measured the effect of exogenous expression of ARNO on apical and basolateral CME. For this purpose, MDCK cells were infected with adenovirus encoding wild-type ARNO (Fig. 4A) and incubated for 18 h to induce expression. As shown in Fig. 4B, expression of wildtype ARNO induced apical endocytosis of IgA ∼6-fold but had no significant effect on basolateral endocytosis of IgA (Fig. 4C). We observed no effect on the delivery of newly made pIgR to either apical or basolateral PM, transcytosis of IgA by pIgR from the basolateral to apical PM, or recycling of apical or basolateral internalized IgA back to the PM (data not shown).FIGURE 4Effects of ARNO and ARF6 on apical endocytosis. A, schematic structural diagram of ARNO as well as the deletion mutants. B-C, MDCK Tet-Off cells were grown for 3 days on Corning transwells. Control cells (uninfected) and cells expressing ARNO-WT, ARNO-Δcoil or ARNO-ΔPH for 18 h were used in a 5-min assay of radioiodinated IgA endocytosis from either the apical (B) or basolateral (C) surface. ARNO-WT strongly stimulates apical endocytosis. Mutants show reduced levels of stimulated apical endocytosis of IgA (B); no effect is observed on endocytosis of IgA from the basolateral PM (C). D and E, MDCK Tet-Off cells were grown for 3 days on Corning transwells. Control cells (uninfected) and cells expressing ARNO-WT, ARF6-WT, or ARF6-T27N or co-expressing ARNO-WT with ARF6-WT (D) or ARF6-T27N (E) for 18 h were used in a 5-min assay of radioiodinated IgA endocytosis from the apical surface. The level of ARNO expression was ∼50% of that used in B and C to allow monitoring of both stimulatory and inhibitory effects. Cells co-expressing ARNO-WT and ARF6-WT show a synergistic stimulatory effect on apical endocytosis (D). Note that cells co-expressing ARNO-WT with dominant negative ARF6-T27N show no effect on apical endocytosis, indicating that ARF6-T27N abolished the stimulatory effect of ARNO on endocytosis (E).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We have reported previously that ARF6 localizes to the apical PM and regulates CME there. Although overexpression of dominant active ARF6-Q67L, and to a lesser extent of dominant negative ARF6-T27N, stimulates apical CME, the wild-type form of ARF6 did not induce any stimulation of apical CME (23Altschuler Y. Liu S.-H. Katz L. Tang K. Hardy S. Brodsky F. Mostov K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that in epithelia ARNO may be the exchange factor for ARF6. To test this hypothesis, we co-expressed a submaximal level of ARNO that induced approximately half the effect on apical endocytosis (∼15% of bound IgA endocytosed in a 5-min warm-up) with overexpressed A"

Both the β- and α-ligated chlorophylls of photosystem I are shown to have ample contacts to apoprotein within their proteinaceous binding sites, in particular, at C-13 of the isocyclic ring. The H-bonding patterns for the C-131 oxo groups, however, are clearly distinct for the β-ligated and α-ligated chlorophylls. The β-ligated chlorophylls frequently employ their C-131 oxo in H-bonds to neighboring helices and subunits. In contrast, the C-131 oxo of α-ligated chlorophylls are significantly less involved in H-bonding interactions, particularly to neighboring helices. Remarkably, in the peripheral antenna, light harvesting complex (LH2) from Rhodobacter sphaeroides, a single mutation in the α-subunit, introduced to eliminate H-bonding to the β-bacteriochlorophyll-B850, which is ligated in the “β-position,” results in significant thermal destabilization of the LH2 in the membrane. In addition, in comparison with wild type LH2, the expression level of the LH2 lacking this H-bond is significantly reduced. These findings show that H-bonding to the C-131 keto group ofβ-ligated (bacterio)-chlorophyll is a key structural motif and significantly contributes to the stability of bacteriochlorophyll proteins in the native membrane. Our analysis of photosystem I and II suggests that this hitherto unrecognized motif involving H-bonding to β-ligated chlorophylls may be equally critical for the stable assembly of the inner core antenna of these multicomponent chlorophyll proteins.

Major advances have recently been made in the understanding of the factors that determine membrane protein folding and assembly (for recent reviews see Refs. 1DeGrado W.F. Gratkowski T.T. Lear J.P.

Van der Waals' interactions and H-bonding interactions have been recognized to significantly contribute to the stability of membrane proteins. Intermolecular H-bonding may even drive the assembly of transmembrane (TM) 2The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane; (B)Chl, (bacterio)chlorophyll; LH, light harvesting complex; WT, wild type; PS, photosystem. 2The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane; (B)Chl, (bacterio)chlorophyll; LH, light harvesting complex; WT, wild type; PS, photosystem. helices in detergent and biological membranes (3Zhou F.X.

U. S. A. 2001; 98: 880-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In addition, in numerous high resolution structures of membrane proteins, H-bonding networks are likely to exist at helix-helix interfaces between membrane embedded backbone keto groups and polar side chains as well as between side chain groups (5Adamian L. Jackups Jr., R. Binkowski T.A. Liang J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 251-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 6Adamian L. Liang J.

In membrane-embedded, cofactor-binding proteins as for example (bacterio)chlorophyll ((B)Chl)-binding proteins, additional factors have to be taken into account. Interactions between the cofactors and TM proteins contribute significantly to their folding in the membrane, in addition to helix-helix interactions.The (B)Chls belong to the cyclic tetrapyrroles, which are ubiquitous cofactors of biological catalysis and which are involved in a multitude of reactions. Their central metals differentiate the major classes: iron in the hemes, and magnesium (and rarely zinc) in Chl and BChl. The presence of different substituents at the periphery of the tetrapyrrole skeleton, as well as its hydrogenation state, further distinguish these two groups of molecules. The structures of Chl and BChl are very similar. The macrocycles of Chl a and BChl a differ only at ring B; BChl has one additional bond in ring B, and the substituent at ring A is an acetyl carbonyl group in BChl and a vinyl group in Chl. The carbonyl groups frequently interact with the surrounding polypeptide and/or neighboring pigments. In particular, the H-bonding state of the acetyl carbonyl of BChls has been recognized to modulate the spectral and, although still disputed, redox properties of these molecules (10Ivancich A. Artz K. Williams J.C. Allen J.P. Mattioli T.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11812-11820Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). H-bonding to the C-131 keto carbonyl at the isocyclic ring, which is common to all bacteriochlorophylls and chlorophylls, seems to be widespread (see e.g. Refs. 8Witt H. Schlodder E. Teutloff C.

Acta. 2001; 1507: 5-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), which comprises more than 10 TM subunits and contains nearly 100 Chl-binding pockets and thus constitutes a considerable data base for (bacterio)chlorophyll binding studies, the majority of the polar groups of Chls, in particular the C-131 keto group, are likely to be H-bonded by the polypeptide residues in close vicinity (11Braun P. Vegh A. Strohmann B. Hunter N. Robert B. Scheer H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1607: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 14Moenne-Loccoz P. Robert B. Ikegami I. Lutz M.

Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2005Google Scholar).The ligation to the central magnesium has long been recognized to be critical for the binding of BChl and thus the assembly of BChl proteins (17Coleman W.J. Youvan D.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. 1990; 19: 333-367Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 18Olsen J.D. Sturgis J.N. Westerhuis W.H. Fowler G.J. Hunter C.N. Robert B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12625-12632Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, only recently, the stereochemical aspect in Chl ligation has been discussed for Chl protein assemblies (19Balaban T.S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 545: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 20Balaban T.S. Fromme P. Holzwarth A.R. Krauβ N. Prokhorenko V.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 197-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Because of the dissymmetric arrangement of the substituents, the two faces of the chlorin macrocycle are diastereotopic (see Fig. 1). Ligation of the central magnesium atom may occur from either the top (β-type) or the bottom (α-type) of the macrocycle. The two ligation states should differ in their energies, with the ligation from below being favored by ∼4 kJ/mol over ligation from above (21Oba T. Tamiaki H. Photosynth. Res. 2002; 74: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In (B)Chl proteins, the two types of ligation are unevenly distributed. In PS I only 14 of the 96 Chl molecules are ligated in the β-position (19Balaban T.S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 545: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that the stereochemistry of (B)Chl ligation by the protein matrix may considerably influence the photophysical properties of these pigments. In the case of the (B)Chl ligated in the β-position, it has been proposed that ligation could result in a more pronounced red-shifted absorption, thus optimizing energy transfer (19Balaban T.S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 545: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In a very recent work, it has been proposed that the β-ligated Chl in light-harvesting complex II occupies key positions for energy transfer (22Balaban T.S. Photosynth. Res. 2005; 86: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This, however, has not been demonstrated by experimental studies. The role of the diastereotopic distinct ligation of (B)Chls thus remains to be substantiated.Here, we have addressed the role of the diastereotopic Chl ligation by a combination of statistical analysis of PS I and site-specific mutagenesis of the (B)Chl-binding pockets of the peripheral LH2 antenna from Rhodobacter sphaeroides. We show that there is a strong correlation between the ligation stereochemistry and the H-bonding patterns of the C=O groups of ring E with neighboring polypeptide in PS I. The C-131 keto carbonyl groups of the unfavorable β-ligated Chls primarily have H-bonding contacts with residues from neighboring helices and/or loop structures. In contrast, the C-131 keto carbonyl groups of α-ligated Chls have significantly less H-bonding contacts, and it is primarily to loop structures. As is obvious from the LH2 crystal structure (23McDermott G. Prince S.M. Freer A.A. Hawthornthwaite-Lawless A.M. Papiz M.Z. Cogdell R.J. Isaacs N.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 517-521Crossref Scopus (2475) Google Scholar, 24Koepke J. Hu X. Muenke C. Schulten K. Michel H. Structure. 1996; 4: 581-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar), both BChls that make up BChl-B850 are ligated in the β-position. Mutation of the H-bond donor to the C-131 carbonyl of one of these BChl molecules results in the significant impairment of LH2 assembly. This supports the idea that ligation of (bacterio)chlorophyll in the β-position has a pronounced structural impact on (B)Chl proteins.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains, Plasmids, Gene Transfer, and Growth Conditions—The bacterial strains used in this work include Escherichia coli strain S17-1 (thi pro hsdR- hsdM+ recA RP4-2 (Tc::mu Kan::Tn7)) and Rb. sphaeroides strain DD13 (genomic deletion of both pucBA and puf-BALMX; insertion of SmR and KanR genes, respectively) (25Jones M.R.

The spectra were fitted or smoothed using the graphing and data analysis software Origin 7.0 (OriginLab Cooperation).Statistical Analysis of Chl-binding Pockets in PS I—Chl protein contacts at a radius of ≤4 Å in PS I were determined by use of the program WebLab viewer 3.7. For each Chl atom, the number and type of contacts to surrounding residues have been determined at a radius ≤4Åinthe structure of PS I (31Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Seanger W. Krauss N.

Chl protein contacts have been analyzed for all Chls ligated to protein or H2O molecules except for the Chls from subunit B in PS I (the binding pockets of B are highly homologous to A). For Chl helix contacts of the Chls ligated in the β-position, the pockets of the B subunit of PS I have been included as well to obtain a sufficiently large sample group (in total 14 Chls). Putative H-bonds have been identified by use of a WebLab viewer 3.7 as described in Ref. 27Kwa L.G. Garcia-Martin A. Vegh A. Strohmann B. Scheer H. Robert B. Braun P. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 545: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It thus constitutes a considerable data base for Chl binding studies, in particular, for statistical analyses of Chl binding pockets. We have analyzed and compared the proteic environments around the α- and β-ligated Chls of PS I (Fig. 2) within a radius of ≤4 Å. At first sight, the contacts (defined as atoms within ≤4 Å) between the PS I apoproteins and the β- and α-ligated Chl forms appear to be similar (Fig. 2, A and C). Contacts occur most frequently with the long substituents of the Chl macrocycle, in particular with rings B, C, and E. Of these, the C-133 methoxy, the C-131, and 133 C=O groups and the methyl group of C12 have the highest number of contacts to the apoproteins. Relatively infrequent are contacts with the substituents of ring D, the atoms that make up the tetrapyrrole rings, and methine bridges (Fig. 2, A and C). The amino acid residues that are taking part in these contacts are also similar for the two diastereotopic ligation forms. Naturally, histidine is frequently close to the nitrogen atoms, which bind the central magnesium atoms. Notably, the aromatic residue, phenylalanine, is often found to be close to Chl, in particular around atoms that have little contact to histidine residues. Contacts to phenylalanine residues are entirely absent at C-14, C-15, C-16, and N-24 of ring D where histidines are frequently observed. Next to these two residues, the aliphatic residues leucine, isoleucine, and valine as well as alanine and the aromatic residues tyrosine and tryptophan make up most of the residues in the Chl-binding pockets. Polar residues are present to a lesser degree but are equally distributed, whereas charged residues are rarely found in close vicinity of the Chls (Fig. 2, A and C).FIGURE 2Analysis of the chlorophyll protein contacts in PS I. Contacts to the proteinaceous environment, excluding contacts to binding helices, are shown for β-ligated Chls (A) and α-ligated Chls (C). Contacts between residues of the binding-helices and the Chl atoms only are shown for β-ligated Chls (B) and α-ligated Chls (D). The binding helices are defined as the helices that provide the ligand for the central magnesium atom. The color coding is His (brown), Phe (red), Trp and Tyr (orange), Gly and Pro (white), polar (light blue), charged (dark blue), and aliphatic residues (gray). The location of ring E is indicated by the arrow.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Chl protein Interactions Vary Depending on the Chl Ligation State—Fig. 2 (B and D) show the contact maps for β- and α-ligated Chl with their respective binding helices, i.e. the helices that carry the ligating residue to the central Mg of the Chls. These contact maps are clearly distinct for the two diastereotopic forms. The main differences are observed at the rings E and their substituents. In case of the β-ligated Chl (Fig. 2B), there exist very few close contacts between the residues of the helices and the atoms of ring E. Remarkably, the keto carbonyl and methoxy groups of C-131 and C-131 of the β-ligated Chls are not found in the vicinity of the residues of the binding helices in PS I (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the atoms of ring E of the α-ligated Chls are very frequently found in close vicinity of these residues (Fig. 2D). Both the C-131 and C-133 oxo as well as C-134 of the α-ligated Chl are frequently in close contact with the residues of the binding helices. Additional differences in the Chl-binding sites are observed for the atoms of ring D and the 17-propionic phytol (Fig. 2D). In the case of the α-ligated Chls, contacts are conspicuously low. These findings show that significant differences exist between the binding pockets of Chls, depending on the ligation state. The C-13 substituents of Chls ligated in the α-position are facing the binding helix, and thus, they are often in close contact with residues of these helices. The C-13 substituents of Chls ligated in the β-position, however, face to the opposite side and are not in contact with the binding helix. Nevertheless there is a substantial number of contacts between the C-13 substituents of the Chls ligated in the β-position and the protein environment as shown in Fig. 2A.Chls Ligated in the β-Position Associate with Residues of Adjacent Helices—The interactions of the C-131 oxo groups of the β-ligated and α-ligated Chls in photosystem I and photosystem II are listed in Table 1. These data show that the oxo atoms of β-ligated Chls in both PS I and PS II are exclusively found in close contact with residues of adjacent helices or loop structures but not with residues of the helices which carry the magnesium ligand (Table 1). Remarkably, these close contacts include the helices of other subunits, as well as those of the same apoprotein. Most of the contacts of the C-131 oxo involve residues of neighboring helices (44% in PS I and 57% in PS II) either from the apoproteins, or from neighboring subunits. The remaining C-131 oxo atoms of the Chls ligated in the β-position are in close contact with other Chls and residues located in loop structures. Interestingly, a very different picture emerges for the C-131 oxo atoms of α-ligated Chl. Here, the majority of contacts (47% in PS I and 39% in PS II) are to residues of adjacent loop structures, whereas contacts to neighboring helices (10% in PS I and 25% in PS II) are less frequent, in particular to different subunits (3% in PS I and 7% in PS II).TABLE 1H-bonding interactions of the Chl ligated in the β- and α-positions in PS I and IIH-bonding to C131 oxoChl βChl αPS IPS IIPS IPS IIH-bondContactH-bondContactH-bondContactH-bondContactNeighboring subunitsaH-bonds between Chl molecules that are ligated by their central magnesium to one subunit and residues of another subunit (e.g. Chl is ligated to subunit A, the C131 group makes a H-bond to a residue of subunit J).141414140307Neighboring helicesbH-bonds between Chl that are ligated to one TM helix and the residues of neighboring TM helices (other than the binding helices within one subunit).30364357810425Binding helicescH-bonds between Chl and residues of the binding helices.0000614718Loops, parallel helicesdH-bonds between Chl and residues from loop structures (including helices parallel to the membrane).21210142547739Neighboring pigments, H20 etc.eH-bonds between Chl and neighboring Chl or carotenoids (contacts to Chl are only included if no contacts to polypeptide are present).ND29ND14ND26ND7a H-bonds between Chl molecules that are ligated by their central magnesium to one subunit and residues of another subunit (e.g. Chl is ligated to subunit A, the C131 group makes a H-bond to a residue of subunit J).b H-bonds between Chl that are ligated to one TM helix and the residues of neighboring TM helices (other than the binding helices within one subunit).c H-bonds between Chl and residues of the binding helices.d H-bonds between Chl and residues from loop structures (including helices parallel to the membrane).e H-bonds between Chl and neighboring Chl or carotenoids (contacts to Chl are only included if no contacts to polypeptide are present). Open table in a new tab Chls Ligated in the β-Position Are H-bonded to the Residues of Adjacent Helices—Almost all of the observed contacts between the C-131 oxo of the Chl molecules ligated in the β-position and the surrounding residues are identified as H-bonding interactions (Table 1) as judged by the distance and angle between the interacting atoms (not shown). All of the contacts to the helices of neighboring subunits and most of the contacts to adjacent helices within the apoproteins are identified as H-bonds. Essentially, these findings are very similar for the two photosystems with the exception that the majority of contacts to loop structures are not identified as H-bonds in PS II yet are identified as H-bonds in PS I. The reason for this discrepancy is presently unknown. It maybe related to the lower resolution in the case of the PS II structure introducing a considerable error. Remarkably, in the case of the Chls ligated in the α-position, very few of the contacts to adjacent helices are identified as H-bonding interactions. Of the contacts to loops structures (in PS I) and binding helices approximately half meet the criteria for H-bonding interactions (Table 1). In PS II, very few H-bonds are identified in the case of the contacts between the α-ligated Chls and loop structures as has been already observed for β-ligated Chls (see above).In conclusion, the statistical analyses of PS I and PS II suggests that the binding pockets of the two Chl ligation forms are clearly distinct. In particular, the C-13 substituents are found in different protein environments. In the majority of Chls, which are the Chls ligated in the α-position, the oxo atoms of the C-131 are in the close vicinity of loop structures and the helices carrying the magnesium ligand as well as adjacent helices. A considerable percentage of H-bonding interactions are merely found for the contacts to loop structures (in PS I). In contrast, the C-131 oxo of the Chls ligated in the β-position are chiefly engaged in H-bonds, in particular with helices other than the one ligating the central Mg. It appears thus that the C=O groups of β-ligated Chls mediate interactions between adjacent helices, likely critically contributing to their packing and assembly. H-bonding, in particular involving the β-ligated Chls, may thus be a critical, hitherto unrecognized, assembly motif in (B)Chl proteins.Mutagenesis of the H-bond Donor to β-Ligated BChl-B850 Significantly Hampers LH2 Assembly—To experimentally explore the role of H-bonding to the C-131 keto carbonyl group of (B)Chl that is ligated in the β-position, we chose the peripheral antenna complexes, LH2, from the purple bacterium Rb. sphaeroides. This complex contains three bacteriochlorophyll molecules, two are bound in the β-position (BChl-B850) and one is bound in the α-position (BChl-B800). Although the pigments used for the statistical analysis of Chl protein interactions (Fig. 2 and Table 1) are Chl a, the LH2s contain BChl a. The overall structures of BChl and Chl, however, are very similar (Fig. 1). In particular, ring C and E including the C-13 substituents are identical in the two molecules. It has previously been shown that Chl molecules may replace BChl in certain photosynthetic complexe"
https://openalex.org/W2046874990,"Signal peptide peptidases (SPPs) are enzymes involved in the initial degradation of signal peptides after they are released from the precursor proteins by signal peptidases. In contrast to the eukaryotic enzymes that are aspartate peptidases, the catalytic mechanisms of prokaryotic SPPs had not been known. In this study on the SPP from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakaraensis (SppATk), we have identified amino acid residues that are essential for the peptidase activity of the enzyme. ΔN54SppATk, a truncated protein without the N-terminal 54 residues and putative transmembrane domain, exhibits high peptidase activity, and was used as the wild-type protein. Sixteen residues, highly conserved among archaeal SPP homologue sequences, were selected and replaced by alanine residues. The mutations S162A and K214A were found to abolish peptidase activity of the protein, whereas all other mutant proteins displayed activity to various extents. The results indicated the function of Ser162 as the nucleophilic serine and that of Lys214 as the general base, comprising a Ser/Lys catalytic dyad in SppATk. Kinetic analyses indicated that Ser184, His191 Lys209, Asp215, and Arg221 supported peptidase activity. Intriguingly, a large number of mutations led to an increase in activity levels of the enzyme. In particular, mutations in Ser128 and Tyr165 not only increased activity levels but also broadened the substrate specificity of SppATk, suggesting that these residues may be present to prevent the enzyme from cleaving unintended peptide/protein substrates in the cell. A detailed alignment of prokaryotic SPP sequences strongly suggested that the majority of archaeal enzymes, along with the bacterial enzyme from Bacillus subtilis, adopt the same catalytic mechanism for peptide hydrolysis.

Secretion proteins and membrane proteins in many cases harbor signal sequences at their extreme N termini that are cleaved during translocation by signal peptidases (1Paetzel M. Karla A. Strynadka N.C.J. Dalbey R.E. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4549-4579Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The released signal peptides are subsequently cleaved into smaller fragments by signal peptide peptidases (SPPs) 2The abbreviations used are: SPP, signal peptide peptidase; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid; MCA, α-4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide; FRETS, fluorescence resonance energy transfer substrates. 2The abbreviations used are: SPP, signal peptide peptidase; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid; MCA, α-4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide; FRETS, fluorescence resonance energy transfer substrates.

It had long been presumed that the signal peptides, after their removal from the precursor protein, have no active function in the cell and are simply degraded to free amino acids. However, it is now known that in human cells, peptide fragments generated after cleavage by SPP exhibit vital regulatory functions in immune surveillance (3Braud V.M. Allan D.S.J. O'Callaghan C.A. Söderström K. D'Andrea A. Ogg G.S. Lazetic S. Young N.T. Bell J.I. Phillips J.H. Lanier L.L. McMichael A.J. Nature. 1998; 391: 795-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar, 4Lemberg M.K. Bland F.A. Weihofen A. Braud V.M. Martoglio B. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 6441-6446Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The function of SPP has also been reported to be necessary for the proper development of Drosophila larvae (5Casso D.J. Tanda S. Biehs B. Martoglio B. Kornberg T.B. Genetics. 2005; 170: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In bacteria, SPP was first identified in Escherichia coli. A previously identified cytoplasmic membrane protein, protease IV (6Pacaud M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4333-4339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was found to exhibit SPP activity toward the signal peptide of the outer membrane lipoprotein (2Ichihara S. Beppu N. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9853-9857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gene was cloned (sppAEc) (7Ichihara S. Suzuki T. Suzuki M. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9405-9411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and gene disruption studies strongly implied the involvement of SppAEc in signal peptide degradation (8Suzuki T. Itoh A. Ichihara S. Mizushima S. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2523-2528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other cytoplasmic proteases including oligopeptidase A have also been found to participate in this degradation pathway (9Novak P. Ray P.H. Dev I.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 420-427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is now presumed that in E. coli, SppA initiates the degradation by introducing endoproteolytic cuts into the signal peptide, whereas the other cytoplasmic proteases are responsible for complete degradation of the smaller fragments into free amino acids (10Novak P. Dev I.K. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5067-5075Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SppA has also been identified and genetically characterized in the Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis. The enzyme, along with a cytoplasmic peptidase TepA, has been found to play an important role in signal peptide degradation in this organism (11Bolhuis A. Matzen A. Hyyryläinen H.-L. Kontinen V.P.

In the Archaea, much remains to be understood on the mechanisms of protein secretion (12Pugsley A.P. Francetic O. Driessen A.J. de Lorenzo V. Mol.

In terms of signal peptidases, the type I signal peptidase from Methanococcus voltae has been characterized, and a catalytic triad comprised from Ser52, His122, and Asp148 has been determined to be critical for its peptidase activity (15Ng S.Y.M. Jarrell K.F. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5936-5942Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 16Bardy S.L. Ng S.Y.M. Carnegie D.S. Jarrell K.F. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 1188-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). FlaK, an aspartic protease essential for preflagellin signal cleavage has also been studied from this organism (17Bardy S.L. Jarrell K.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1339-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In the Crenarchaeota, the homologue of bacterial type IV prepilin peptidases from Sulfolobus solfataricus (PibD) has been characterized, and residues on the substrate that are important for recognition by PibD have been examined (18Albers S.-V. Szabó Z. Driessen A.J.M. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3918-3925Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). As for SPPs, we have recently carried out the first examination of an archaeal SPP (SppATk) (19Matsumi R. Atomi H. Imanaka T. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 7072-7080Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) from the hyperthermophilic archaeon, Thermococcus kodakaraensis KOD1 (20Atomi H. Fukui T. Kanai T. Morikawa M. Imanaka T. Archaea. 2004; 1: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). SppATk (334 residues) was much smaller in size compared with its bacterial counterpart SppAEc (618 residues). A single, putative membrane-spanning domain was present in the N-terminal region of the protein. We found that ΔN54SppATk, a truncated protein without the N-terminal 54 residues, was a soluble protein exhibiting peptidase activity and stable against autoproteolysis. The substrate specificity of ΔN54SppATk examined with a FRETS peptide library was consistent with its presumed role as an SPP in T. kodakaraensis. From the primary structures, archaeal and bacterial homologues of SppATk and SppAEc are all members of the S49 family of peptidases included in the Clan SK (MEROPS, the peptidase data base, merops.sanger.ac.uk/) (21Rawlings N.D. Tolle D.P. Barrett A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D160-D164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the eukaryotic SPPs have been determined to be aspartic proteases (22Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 23Wolfe M.S. Kopan R. Science. 2004; 305: 1119-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), the effects of various inhibitors on SppATk and SppAEc strongly suggest that the enzymes are serine proteases (6Pacaud M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4333-4339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Matsumi R. Atomi H. Imanaka T. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 7072-7080Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Although sequence comparisons among SppA homologues reveal the presence of several conserved serine residues, experimental evidence identifying the nucleophilic serine has not yet been obtained. Moreover, even with the sequence comparisons, it is still difficult to estimate what other residues might be involved in the catalytic mechanism of SPPs. In particular, His and Asp/Glu residues that comprise the well known catalytic triad of serine proteases are not clearly conserved among the bacterial and archaeal SppA sequences. To gain insight on the residues involved in the catalytic mechanism of prokaryotic SPPs, here we have performed a detailed site-directed mutagenesis study on ΔN54SppATk. Through the analyses of various mutant proteins, we have been able to determine multiple residues that are essential or important for the activity of this protein. Our results strongly suggest that ΔN54SppATk and other SppA homologues from the Archaea utilize a Ser/Lys dyad mechanism in peptide cleavage. Strains, Media, and Plasmids—E. coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used as the host strain for gene expression with the plasmid pET21a(+) (Novagen, Madison, WI). The plasmids were amplified with E. coli JM109 (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). E. coli strains were cultivated in LB medium (10 g/liter of tryptone, 5 g/liter of yeast extract, and 10 g/liter of NaCl) with 100 μgml-1 ampicillin at 37 °C. DNA Manipulation, Sequence Analysis, and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Plasmid DNA was isolated with the plasmid mini kit from Qiagen. DNA sequencing was performed using a BigDye terminator cycle sequencing kit v.3.1 and a model 3100 capillary DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sequence comparisons and alignments were performed with the ClustalW program provided by the DNA Data Bank of Japan. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using a QuikChange XL site-directed kit (Stratagene). The template used was an expression plasmid previously constructed for wild-type ΔN54SppATk, a protein with an N-terminal truncation of 54 amino acid residues. An artificial Met residue was inserted directly before Cys55 (19Matsumi R. Atomi H. Imanaka T. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 7072-7080Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The primers used to incorporate each mutation are shown in Table 1. After sequence confirmation, the plasmids were introduced into E. coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL cells.TABLE 1Primers used in this studyMutationPrimer sequencesS128A5′-GTTCTCCTCTGGATTGAAGCCCCCGGTGGCGTAGTTGGG-3′5′-CCCAACTACGCCACCGGGGGCTTCAATCCAGAGGAGAAC-3′G130A5′-CTCTGGATTGAAAGTCCCGCCGGCGTAGTTGGGCCTGTT-3′5′-AACAGGCCCAACTACGCCGGCGGGACTTTCAATCCAGAG-3′G131A5′-TGGATTGAAAGTCCCGGTGCCGTAGTTGGGCCTGTTATT-3′5′-AATAACAGGCCCAACTACGGCACCGGGACTTTCAATCCA-3′K150A5′-AAAAAGTTGTCTTTAGTTGCCCCAGTCGTCGCTTACAGC-3′5′-GCTGTAAGCGACGACTGGGGCAACTAAAGACAACTTTTT-3′S162A5′-AGCGGGGATATCATAGCAGCCGGGGGATACTACATAGCA-3′5′-TGCTATGTAGTATCCCCCGGCTGCTATGATATCCCCGCT-3′Y165A5′-ATCATAGCATCAGGGGGAGCCTACATAGCAGTTGGGGCT-3′5′-AGCCCCAACTGCTATGTAGGCTCCCCCTGATGCTATGAT-3′S184A5′-CCGCTGGCTGAGGTCGGAGCCATCGGAGTTATCTACGTT-3′5′-AACGTAGATAACTCCGATGGCTCCGACCTCAGCCAGCGG-3′H191A5′-ATCGGAGTTATCTACGTTGCCTACGACCTGGAGAAGAAC-3′5′-GTTCTTCTCCAGGTCGTAGGCAACGTAGATAACTCCGAT-3′K209A5′-ATAAAGGTAAATGTATTCGCCACTGGTAAACACAAGGAC-3′5′-GTCCTTGTGTTTACCAGTGGCGAATACATTTACCTTTAT-3′K214A5′-TTCAAAACTGGTAAACACGCCGACATGGGGGCCGAGTGG-3′5′-CCACTCGGCCCCCATGTCGGCGTGTTTACCAGTTTTGAA-3′D215A5′-AAAACTGGTAAACACAAGGCCATGGGGGCCGAGTGGAGA-3′5′-TCTCCACTCGGCCCCCATGGCCTTGTGTTTACCAGTTTT-3′R221A5′-GACATGGGGGCCGAGTGGGCCGATTTAACGCCAGAAGAA-3′5′-TTCTTCTGGCGTTAAATCGGCCCACTCGGCCCCCATGTC-3′E226A5′-TGGAGAGATTTAACGCCAGCCGAACGCGAGAAGATAACG-3′5′-CGTTATCTTCTCGCGTTCGGCTGGCGTTAAATCTCTCCA-3′E227A5′-AGAGATTTAACGCCAGAAGCCCGCGAGAAGATAACGGAG-3′5′-CTCCGTTATCTTCTCGCGGGCTTCTGGCGTTAAATCTCT-3′R250A5′-AGCGCAGTGAGCGAGGGGGCCAACATGACCATTGATGAA-3′5′-TTCATCAATGGTCATGTTGGCCCCCTCGCTCACTGCGCT-3′D277A5′-GTTACTGGAGCCCTCGTCGCCGAGCTTGGGGGTATGGAC-3′5′-GTCCATACCCCCAAGCTCGGCGACGAGGGCTCCAGTAAC-3′ Open table in a new tab Expression and Purification of Wild-type and Mutant ΔN54SppATk Proteins—The recombinant E. coli cells were grown in LB medium, and gene expression was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at the mid- to late exponential growth phase. After 6 h, the cells were collected, washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and resuspended in the same buffer. The cells were sonicated on ice, and the supernatant after centrifugation (20,000 × g, 30 min at 4 °C) was applied to heat treatment at 85 °C for 15 min, immediately cooled on ice, and then centrifuged (20,000 × g, 30 min at 4 °C). The soluble protein sample was brought to 35% saturation with ammonium sulfate, and the precipitate was dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). This was applied to anion exchange chromatography (ResourceQ; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.2 m NaCl and eluted with a linear gradient (0.2-1.0 m) of NaCl. After desalting with a HiPrep26/10 column (Amersham Biosciences), the sample was applied to gel filtration chromatography (Superdex 200 HR 10/30; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.15 m NaCl, and the obtained fractions were used for enzyme analysis. The protein concentration was determined with a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Enzyme Activity Measurements—Standard activity measurements were performed at 60 °C in 1 ml of 50 mm CHES (pH 10.0) with 0.1 μg of purified protein and 200 μm Ala-Ala-Phe-MCA available from Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan). Release of 7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin was monitored consecutively with a fluorescence spectrophotometer capable of maintaining the cuvette at desired temperatures between 30 and 100 °C. λex and λem were 380 and 460 nm, respectively. The final concentration of Me2SO used to dissolve the substrate was constant at 3% of the reaction mixture. Kinetic parameters were calculated with IGOR Pro version 5.0 (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy of Wild-type and Mutant Enzymes—Each protein sample was prepared in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 75 mm NaCl at a protein concentration of ∼0.1 mg ml-1. A J-820 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) was used to measure ellipticity as a function of wavelength from 250 to 200 nm in 0.2-nm increments using a 0.1-cm cylindrical quartz cuvette. The samples were scanned one hundred times and averaged. The mean molar ellipticity [θ] (deg cm2 dmol-1) was calculated from the equation [θ] = θ/10 nCl, where θ is the measured ellipticity in millidegrees, C is the molar concentration of enzyme subunits, l is the path length in centimeters, and n is the number of residues/subunit. Examination of the Substrate Preference of Wild-type and Mutant Enzymes—The substrate preferences of the wild-type, S128A, and Y165A proteins were examined with a FRETS peptide library (25Xaa series, Peptide Institute) (19Matsumi R. Atomi H. Imanaka T. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 7072-7080Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 24Tanskul S. Oda K. Oyama H. Noparatnaraporn N. Tsunemi M. Takada K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 309: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These peptide substrates harbor a highly fluorescent 2-(N-methylamino)benzoyl group linked to the side chain of the N-terminal d-2,3-diamino propionic acid residue (d-A2pr), along with a 2,4-dinitrophenyl group (quencher) linked to the ϵ-amino group of a Lys residue. In between the d-2,3-diamino propionic acid residue and the Lys residue lies the peptide Gly-Zaa-Yaa-Xaa-Ala-Phe-Pro, where Zaa is a mixture of Phe, Ala, Val, Glu, or Arg; Yaa is a mixture of Pro, Tyr, Lys, Ile, or Asp; and the Xaa residue is a defined single amino acid of choice. λex and λem were 340 and 440 nm, respectively. To examine the preference for residues at the P-1 position, 1 μg of purified enzyme was added to the reaction mixture with a final volume of 1 ml containing 30 μm substrate in 50 mm CHES (pH 10.0). The final concentration of Me2SO used to dissolve the substrate was constant at 3% of the reaction mixture. Highly Conserved Amino Acid Residues among the Signal Peptide Peptidases from Archaea and Bacteria—To determine which residues should be selected for site-directed mutagenesis and subsequent biochemical analyses, we aligned all SppA homologues found in the archaeal genomes, along with the biochemically and/or genetically characterized bacterial SppA from E. coli and B. subtilis. Among the 21 archaeal genomes that have been sequenced, we could identify 19 SppA homologues in 16 organisms (see legend of Fig. 1). Although a number of other open reading frames have been annotated as putative SPPs, they displayed clearly lower degrees of similarity with SppATk and SppAEc and were therefore not selected for further examination. The sequence comparison indicated that SppA homologues were not present in Aeropyrum pernix, S. solfataricus, and Sulfolobus tokodaii from the Crenarchaeota and Methanopyrus kandlerii and Archaeoglobus fulgidus from the Euryarchaeota. A region corresponding to residues between Met115 and Lys291 in SppATk was fairly conserved among all sequences and presumably includes the catalytic core regions of these enzymes. An alignment of the sequences spanning this region, along with the mutations introduced in this study, is shown in Fig. 1. Although the eukaryotic SppA has been demonstrated to be an aspartate peptidase (22Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), inhibitor studies on the bacterial SppAEc and the archaeal SppATk have indicated that both of these enzymes are serine peptidases (6Pacaud M.

We therefore initially focused on the presence of conserved serine residues. Ser128, Ser162, and Ser184 of SppATk were completely conserved in all sequences, with the only exceptions being a replacement of the first Ser to Thr in one of the three homologues from Haloarcula marismortui and a replacement of the third Ser to His in another homologue from this strain. In terms of the His residue in the well known Ser/His/Asp catalytic triad, only three His residues were found in this region of SppATk and were not highly conserved among the SppA sequences. His140 and His213 were not conserved even in the closely related Pyrococcus spp., whereas His191, although shared by SppATk and the three Pyrococcus enzymes, was not found in the other SppA sequences. As an alternative, we found that the basic residue Arg250 was highly conserved among the SppA proteins. As for the Asp residue, Asp277 was the only acidic residue that was present without exception in all sequences (Fig. 1). Production and Purification of Mutant SppATk Proteins via Site-directed Mutagenesis—Based on the sequence alignment described above, we first constructed the following six mutants; S128A, S162A, S184A, H191A, R250A, and D277A. The primers used to incorporate the mutations are shown in Table 1. The mutations were incorporated into the expression vector for ΔN54SppATk, a truncated protein without the N-terminal 54 residues of SppATk. Sequence analysis confirmed that only the intended mutations were introduced into the genes. Recombinant mutant proteins were produced in E. coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL cells and purified from the cell-free extracts by heat treatment at 85 °C for 15 min, followed by ammonium sulfate fractionation, anion exchange chromatography, and gel filtration chromatography. Although we were able to obtain each mutant protein in a soluble form, the amount of protein produced in the E. coli cells varied with each mutant. We previously reported that the recombinant ΔN54SppATk was obtained in an octameric or hexadecameric form (19Matsumi R. Atomi H. Imanaka T. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 7072-7080Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We also observed various quaternary structures in the mutant proteins, but only the fraction corresponding to the octameric form of the protein was used for further analysis. The apparent homogeneity of each protein after the purification procedure was examined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). Peptidase Activity of the Wild-type and Mutant ΔN54SppATk Proteins—We have previously reported that the synthetic peptide Ala-Ala-Phe-MCA is a good substrate for the wild-type ΔN54SppATk (19Matsumi R. Atomi H. Imanaka T. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 7072-7080Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The activity levels of each mutant protein were measured at 60 °C in the presence of a fixed concentration of this substrate (200 μm) and compared with that of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 3). We found that the mutation of Ser162 had the most detrimental effect. No activity could be observed with the standard assay procedures. We could estimate that the activity of the protein was only 0.004% of that of the wild-type enzyme by using a 100-fold higher protein concentration. The S184A and H191A mutations also brought about a decrease in enzyme activity, but significant levels of activity, 24 and 45% of that of the wild-type enzyme, respectively, were still observed in each mutant protein. Interestingly, the S128A, R250A, and D277A mutations did not have any negative effect but rather led to an unexpected increase in peptidase activity. It has been shown that mutations in the catalytic residues of serine proteases with a catalytic triad result in 104-106-fold reduction in activity (25Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 28-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Our results clearly indicate that Ser162 is essential for the peptidase activity of SppATk and is most likely the nucleophilic serine of the enzyme. The results also reveal that Arg250 and Asp277, two highly conserved residues in both archaeal and bacterial SPPs, have little, if any, role in the peptide hydrolyzing mechanism of SppATk. Mutations to Identify the General Base Residue of SppATk—The absence of conserved histidine residues among SppA proteins and the fact that His191 was not essential for the catalytic activity suggested that SppATk was not dependent on the well known Ser/His/Asp catalytic triad. We therefore searched for other basic and acidic residues as targets for site-directed mutagenesis. Intriguingly, there were no other charged residues that were completely conserved in all of the sequences. We therefore chose those that were the most highly conserved among the sequences, Lys150, Lys209, Lys214, Asp215, Arg221, Glu226, and Glu227. Each residue was replaced by Ala with appropriate primers (Table 1). Expression and purification were carried out as described for the initial mutant proteins, and the apparent homogeneity of each mutant protein is displayed in Fig. 2. The K150A and E226A mutations did not have a negative effect on the activity of the enzyme. All other residue replacements led to mutant proteins with lower levels of activity than that of the wild-type enzyme. Moderate effects were observed in K209A (59% activity retained), E227A (35%), and D215A (20%), whereas the effect of the R221A (4%) was much more significant. The K214A mutation had the most dramatic effect, and as in the case of the S162A mutation, activity could not be detected under standard procedures. By applying increased protein concentration, activity of K214A was estimated at 0.01% of that of the wild-type protein. The results indicate that Lys214 is essential for activity of SppATk and that the protein most likely utilizes a Ser-Lys catalytic dyad for peptide cleavage. The results also indicate that Arg221, although not essential, plays an important role in the peptidase activity of SppATk. Effects of Mutations on Other Highly Conserved Residues—We next focused on conserved, noncharged residues. Several glycine residues were highly conserved among the homologues, and in particular, a consecutive Gly-Gly sequence was conserved in all SppA proteins. In some lipases and esterases, a consecutive glycine sequence provides the main chain amino group(s) that stabilize the oxyanion intermediate that is formed after the nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl group by serine (26Henke E. Pleiss J. Bornscheuer U.T. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2002; 41: 3211-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We therefore constructed the mutant proteins G130A and G131A. We also selected a Tyr residue in the near vicinity of the nucleophilic Ser162 that is completely conserved among Spp proteins and introduced a Y165A mutation. As a result, we observed a moderately positive effect with the G130A mutation and a surprisingly high increase in activity in the Y165A mutant protein. The G131A mutation had a drastic effect on activity, and the protein exhibited only 2% of the activity levels of the wild-type enzyme, indicating an important role for this glycine residue. Circular Dichroism Spectra of Wild-type and Mutant ΔN54SppATk Proteins—To examine whether the single-residue replacements had unintended broad effects on the protein structure, we analyzed the CD spectrum of each mutant protein. In all mutant proteins, including the two that hardly exhibited activity (S162A and K214A), the CD spectra were indistinguishable from that of the wild-type protein (data not shown). We would like to note that in the case of G130A and G131A, we observed a slight increase in ellipticity between 225 and 230 nm, raising the possibility of protein-protein interaction. Overall, the results indicate that the single-residue replacements introduced did not lead to significant changes in the secondary structures of the proteins. This allows us to interpret the changes in activity as direct consequences brought about by residue exchange. Kinetic Analysis of the Mutant Proteins—We next performed kinetic analyses for all mutant proteins that exhibited sufficient levels of activity. Most mutant proteins were analyzed by standard procedures with various concentrations of Ala-Ala-Phe-MCA. The S162A and K214A mutant proteins could not be examined because of their extremely low levels of activity. Analyses of the G131A and R221A proteins were carried out with 20- and 10-fold higher amounts of enzyme, respectively. We have previously reported that the cleavage reaction of Ala-Ala-Phe-MCA by the wild-type ΔN54SppATk followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics (19Matsumi R. Atomi H. Imanaka T. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 7072-7080Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, in the process of analyzing the activity levels of mutant proteins at high substrate concentrations, we observed a decrease in activity levels. Further examination of all active proteins, including the wild-type ΔN54SppATk, confirmed the occurrence of substrate inhibition. By considering several equations, we found that our data fit very well (R2 > 99.4) to one of the typical substrate inhibition models, expressed as v = Vmax[S]/(Ks1 + [S] + 1/Ks2 [S]2), where v is reaction velocity, Vma"

The molecular mechanisms involved in cell-specific expression of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase α (CTα) are not fully understood. In this study, we investigated whether or not histone deacetylation is involved in repression of CTα expression in quiescent C3H10T1/2 mouse embryo fibroblasts. We have examined the contributions of the Sp1 and E2F binding sites in the repression of CTα gene expression. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and HDAC activity are associated with Sp1 in serum-starved cells or during serum stimulation. However, HDAC1 association with E2F was only detected in serum-starved cells. By chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we detected both direct and indirect association of HDAC1 with the CTα promoter. Treatment with the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A induced CTα expression.

Transition through the mammalian cell cycle is accompanied by the periodic expression of genes that participate in cell cycle-dependent processes. The transcription of several genes involved in DNA replication and mitosis, the DNA polymerase α, cyclin-dependent kinase 2, and thymidine kinase genes (1Farnham P.J. Slansky J.E. Kollmar R. Biochim.

We demonstrated that this activation is driven by the binding of Sp1 to the B site present in the CTα proximal promoter (15Banchio C. Schang L.M. Vance D.E. J. Biol.

A recent study has demonstrated that Net acts as a repressor of CTα transcription (17Sugimoto H. Okamura K. Sugimoto S. Satou M. Hattori T. Vance D.E. Izumi T. J. Biol.

Acetylation of core histones unpacks the condensed chromatin and renders the target DNA accessible to transcriptional machinery, hence contributing to gene expression (18Jaskelioff M. Peterson C.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Conversely, deacetylation of core histones by histone deacetylase (HDAC) increases chromatin condensation and precludes binding between DNA and transcription factors, leading to transcriptional silencing (19Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 1997; 89: 325-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar, 20Iizuka M. Smith M.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Previous studies have identified different mechanisms for transcriptional repression. One mechanism involves a direct interaction of retinoblastoma protein (Rb) with the E2F transactivation domain, resulting in masking of this domain and blocking its ability to stimulate transcription (21Ross J.F. Liu X. Dynlacht B.D. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 195-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Another mechanism is based on the ability of Rb to recruit chromatin remodeling proteins, such as HDACs, and assemble transcription repression complexes at E2F-regulated promoters (21Ross J.F. Liu X.

Our data support a dynamic model in which Sp1·HDAC and E2F·Rb·HDAC complexes cooperate to establish stable repression of CTα gene expression in quiescent cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The luciferase vector, pGL3-Basic, which contains the cDNA for Photinus pyraris luciferase, and the dual luciferase reporter assay system were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). Lipofectamine Plus reagent, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), and fetal bovine serum were from Invitrogen. Anti-Rb, anti-HDAC1, anti-Sp1, and anti-E2F (Santa Cruz) are commercially available. ECL® immunoblotting reagents were purchased from Amersham Biosciences, and trichostatin (TSA) was from Sigma.Cell Culture—C3H10T1/2 mouse embryo fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM supplemented with penicillin G (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37 °C. Cells were arrested in G0 by incubation in culture medium with low serum (0.5%) for 48 h and released by the addition of fresh medium containing 10% FBS. Transient transfections with CTα promoter-luciferase reporter plasmids containing deletions at the 5′ end of the murine promoter, LUC.C7 (–1268/+38) and LUC.C8 (–201/+38) (1 μg), were performed using a cationic liposome method. LUC.C7 (–1268/+38) and LUC.C8 (–201/+38), inserted into the promoterless luciferase vector pGL3-basic (Promega), were prepared as described previously (26Bakovic M. Waite K. Tang W. Tabas I. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). All dishes received 1 μg of pSV-β-galactosidase (Promega) as a control for transfection efficiency. Luciferase assays were performed using the Promega assay system, as recommended by the manufacturer, and luminometric measurements were made using a Fluskan Ascent FL Type 374 luminometer (Thermolabsystems). Luciferase activity was normalized to the protein content or β-galactosidase activity. LUC.C7ΔE2F was constructed with the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) using LUC.C7 as a template and the following set of primers: E2Fup (gACCggCggCAggAgATgCCACACATCC) and E2Fdown (ggATgTgTggCATCTCCTgCCgCCggTC).Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts were grown for 24 h in DMEM plus 10% FBS. After serum deprivation for 72 h, cells were cross-linked by the addition of 1% formaldehyde for 5 min at 37 °C. Cells were collected, lysed, and sonicated three times for 10 s each time at 2.5% with an ultrasonic processor XL from Heat Systems and treated as recommended by the manufacturer. For PCR analysis, we used two set of primers: ChIPCT1 (5′-TTgCCCTCgCCTCTACTCCTgCTC)/ChIPCT2 (5′-CTCCCgCCCgCCCTCTTgTC) and CB001 (5′-CCACACATCCggAATTCC)/CB002 (5′-CACCgACTAgCgAAgTC). PCRs were performed using 2.5 μl of template DNA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 20 pmol of each primer for 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C 1 min. For the assay performed on plasmids LUC.C7delE2F and LUC.C7delSp1, we used a set of primers, ChIPCT1 and GLP2, chosen specifically to detect the episomal CTα promoter but not the chromosomal one.Nuclear Extract Preparations—Total nuclear extracts of C3H10T1/2 cells grown to G0 or S phase of the cell cycle were prepared as described by Andrews and Faller (27Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2209) Google Scholar).Immunoblot Analysis—Nuclear proteins (10 μg) from C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts were heated for 3 min at 90 °C in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% SDS, and 0.004% bromphenol blue. The samples were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 192 mm glycine, and 0.1% SDS buffer. The proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose by electroblotting in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 192 mm glycine, 20% (v/v) methanol). Following transfer, the membrane was incubated for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C with 5% skim milk in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 (T-TBS) and incubated for 1 h with antibody raised against the protein as indicated. Immunoreactive proteins were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Immunoprecipitation—Nuclear extracts were prepared as described above from cells collected after 20 h of cell cycle induction. 200 μg of nuclear extract protein were incubated with 5 μg of polyclonal anti-Sp1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-E2F (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in a 1-ml final volume of immunoprecipitation buffer (1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40). The reaction was incubated for 1 h at 4°C and then incubated for 30 min with 50 μl of 10% Protein A-Sepharose (Staphylococus aureus, Cowan strain), and the complex was washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer. The pellet was resuspended in 30 μl of concentrated electrophoresis sample buffer and boiled, and the supernatant was loaded onto a SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and probed with appropriate antibodies.Treatment with Trichostatin—Stably transfected LUC.C8 (–201/+38), LUC.C7 (–1268/+38), LUC.C7ΔE2F, and LUC.C7ΔSp1C C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts were grown under normal conditions for 24 h and synchronized in G0 phase with DMEM containing 0.5% FBS for 72 h. The cell cycle was induced by adding DMEM containing 10% FBS, and TSA was added at the concentrations indicated. Samples were collected at 20 h (S phase) after induction of the cell cycle, and luciferase activity was measured.HDAC Activity—Nuclear extracts were immunoprecipitated using anti-Sp1 or anti-E2F antibodies, and HDAC activity was measured following the manufacturer's instructions.RESULTSIs the G0 Repression of CTα Regulated by HDAC?—We have previously shown that in C3H10T1/2 mouse embryo fibroblasts, the CTα gene is transcriptionally regulated by Sp1. Binding of Sp1 to the consensus Sp1 binding site B is essential for CTα activation during the S phase of the cell cycle (15Banchio C. Schang L.M. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32457-32464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The interaction of the DNA-binding proteins was direct and shown to be strongly enhanced during the S phase due to Sp1 phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (16Banchio C. Schang L.M. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40220-40226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Since CTα transcription is low during the G0 phase of the cell cycle, we investigated whether HDAC is involved in such repression. To address this question, we used a LUC.C7 (–1268/+38) (26Bakovic M. Waite K. Tang W. Tabas I. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) stable line of C3H10T1/2 cells. Cells were synchronized for 48 h by serum deprivation (G0 phase), and after this time, duplicate samples were incubated for 20 h with the indicated concentrations of TSA or dimethyl sulfoxide as a control. TSA is a nonreversible inhibitor of HDAC (28Taunton J. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar). We analyzed the luciferase/protein ratio as a measure of CTα expression. When cells were treated with TSA, a 2.8-fold increase in CTα expression was observed, consistent with a mechanism whereby HDAC causes repression through chromatin remodeling (Fig. 1).HDAC1 Binds the CTα Promoter—The association between HDAC1 and the CTα promoter was monitored by ChIP assay using chromatin prepared from C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts that were grown to different phases of the cell cycle (determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA; data not shown). Target sequences were detected by PCR using two sets of primers as described under “Experimental Procedures” and in Fig. 2A. A portion of the CTα promoter was found in association with anti-HDAC1 immunoprecipitate in chromatin extracted from G0- and S-phase cells (Fig. 2B). As a control, chromatin was immunoprecipitated in the absence of specific antibodies, and in these samples, no significant quantity of CTα promoter was detected. Although the PCR is not quantitative, clearly, the amount of CTα promoter associated with HDAC1 decreased as cells progressed through the G0-S transition.FIGURE 2In vivo association of HDAC1 with the CTα promoter.

The lines between arrows represent the PCR products. B, a ChIP assay was performed with anti-HDAC1 antibody or a nonrelated antibody anti-IgG as a control. The pairs of primers (ChIPCT1/ChIPCT2 and CB001/CB002) were used to amplify the DNA isolated from the ChIP assay. The data are representative of three separate experiments.

Nuclear extracts obtained from resting and S-phase C3H10T1/2 mouse embryo fibroblasts were immunoprecipitated with anti-Sp1 or anti-E2F antibodies and the co-immunoprecipitated HDAC1 was detected by immunoblot. As Fig. 3 shows, Sp1 directly or indirectly binds HDAC1 in both phases of the cell cycle. Whereas HDAC1 was expressed at a higher level in replicating cells, the affinity to Sp1 seemed to be the same. In the case of immunoprecipitation of E2F, HDAC1 was only immunoprecipitated during the G0 phase as expected from previous models where the progression of the cell cycle induced a release of HDAC from E2F (29Wells J.

In agreement with the immunoblot experiments, we observed that Sp1 is associated with significant HDAC activity in both G0 and S phases, whereas E2F is associated with HDAC activity in G0 phase (Fig. 4), with much less activity found in the S phase. HDAC activity was also measured in nuclear extracts treated with TSA to assess the effectiveness of the assay, and HDAC activity was inhibited by 50% (data not shown).FIGURE 4Sp1 and E2F interact with HDAC. Nuclear extracts from C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts at the G0 or S phase of the cell cycle were immunoprecipitated with anti-Sp1 antibody or anti-E2F antibody. Associated HDAC activity (ratio of fluorescence to mg of protein) was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data represent the means ± S.D. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)CTα Expression Is Regulated by E2F and Sp1—E2F regulates several families of genes whose products are required for cell progression. In G0 or G1 cells, E2F sites in the promoters of these genes are generally occupied by complexes that include E2F proteins and Rb or other members of the pocket family. Experimental data indicate that Rb-E2F repressive complexes function in association with HDAC (24Luo R.X. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1966-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).Investigation of the DNA sequence of the proximal promoter for the CTα gene revealed a putative E2F binding site at the –212 position upstream of the transcriptional start sites (see Fig. 2A). Using the luciferase reporter construct LUC.C7 (–1268/+38), we constructed a plasmid (LUC.C7ΔE2F) harboring a point mutation in the putative E2F binding site (see “Experimental Procedures”). C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts were transfected with the wild type LUC.C7 or mutated LUC.C7ΔE2F plus pSV-β-galactosidase as a control for transfection efficiency. Samples were collected at G0 phase and S phase. We also analyzed the activity of a reporter construct LUC.C7Δ Sp1(C) harboring a mutation in the previously identified Sp1 binding site C that was shown to be a negative regulator of CTα expression (15Banchio C. Schang L.M. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32457-32464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The activity of the LUC.D3 (–52/+38) construct, which excludes both the E2F and the Sp1 binding sites (see Fig. 2A), was also analyzed. As Fig. 5 shows, mutation of the E2F binding site abruptly decreased CTα expression in both phases analyzed. Like LUC.D3, the mutation in E2F not only decreased the basal activity in G0 but also affected S-phase activation. In contrast, mutation of the Sp1 binding site C resulted in enhanced expression of the luciferase reporter (Fig. 5). From these results and a previous report (32Fry C.J. Slansky J.E. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1966-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), E2F appears to play a role in both repression and activation.FIGURE 5Effect of Sp1 and E2F binding site mutations on CTα expression. Cells were transfected with the indicated plasmid plus β-galactosidase as a control, and after synchronization, samples corresponding to G0 and S phases of the cell cycle were harvested and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity.

Fig. 6 shows that significant quantities of the CTα promoter associate with each of the proteins assayed, whereas no significant amount was detected with a nonspecific antibody, anti-IgG. Although the PCR used was not quantitative, there were differences in the intensities of the bands that may reflect a direct or indirect interaction between each protein with DNA (33Ferreira R.

ChIP assays were performed with anti-E2F, -Rb, or -HDAC antibodies. A nonrelated antibody, anti-IgG, was used as a control.

C7ΔSp1(C), with mutations in the E2F and Sp1(C) binding sites, respectively, were transfected into C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts. After synchronization in G0 phase, the cells were analyzed by ChIP assay using antibodies against Sp1, Rb, HDAC, and E2F (Fig. 7). The fragment of the CTα promoter harboring the corresponding mutation in each case was analyzed by designing primers ChIPCT1 and GLP2 (see Fig. 2A), which specifically recognize the plasmids. As a negative control, we used a sample incubated with a nonrelated antibody anti-IgG. Mutation in the E2F binding site does not affect the association between the CTα promoter with Sp1, HDAC1, or E2F-Rb. In contrast, a mutation in Sp1(C) decreases the association with HDAC1 but has no effect on E2F and Rb association. Because the primers amplified a fragment of the CTα promoter that includes three Sp1 binding sites, we did not evaluate the effect of a mutation in the Sp1 binding site C on Sp1 association. Thus, the interaction of HDAC1 with the CTα promoter depends at least in part on the Sp1(C) binding site.FIGURE 7Mutation of the Sp1(C), but not the E2F, site decreases the binding of HDAC1 to the CTα promoter. ChIP assays were performed with anti-Rb, -E2F, or -HDAC1 antibodies using cells transfected with the indicated mutated LUC.C7 plasmids. A nonrelated antibody, anti-IgG, was used as a control. The pairs of primers (ChiPCT1 and GLP2) used to amplify the DNA isolated from the ChIP assay were designed to specifically detect the episomal DNA (see “Experimental Procedures”).

Cells were synchronized for 48 h by serum deprivation, after which duplicate samples were incubated with the indicated concentration of TSA or dimethyl sulfoxide as a control. We analyzed the luciferase/protein ratio as a measure of CTα expression. Mutation in the Sp1(C) binding site did not abolish the induction of luciferase activity caused by TSA (Fig. 8A). However, mutation of E2F decreased the induction by TSA, but we still observed a 1.7-fold induction of luciferase activity after treatment. In agreement with our previous results, analysis of LUC.C8, which excludes the E2F binding site, revealed an increase in CTα expression in both phases of the cell cycle after TSA treatment (Fig. 8B).FIGURE 8Differential sensitivity of the E2F and Sp1 binding sites on the CTα promoter to TSA. A, stable cell lines expressing the nonmutated LUC.C7 luciferase constructs or constructs with mutations in the designated promoter binding sites were synchronized to G0 and then incubated with the indicated concentration of TSA. Luciferase activity/protein ratio between treated and untreated cells was used to calculate the induction caused by TSA treatment. Values represent the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. B, the LUC.C8 stable cell line was synchronized, and the cell cycle was induced by adding 10% FBS. Cells from G0 and S phase were treated with the indicated TSA concentration for 20 h, and the luciferase activity/protein ratio was calculated.

https://openalex.org/W1995711571,"Endostatin has attracted considerable attention because of its ability to inhibit angiogenesis. This property of monomeric endostatin contrasts with that of the trimeric endostatin moiety generated from the intact C-terminal domain of collagen XVIII that induces a promigratory phenotype in endothelial cells. This activity is inhibited by monomeric endostatin. In this study we demonstrate that the effect of oligomeric endostatin can also be inhibited by exogenous glycosaminoglycans in a size-dependent manner, with heparin oligosaccharides containing more than 20 monosaccharide residues having optimal inhibitory activity. Oligomeric endostatin was also found to induce morphological changes in Chinese hamster ovary cells, an epithelial cell line. This novel observation allowed the utilization of a panel of Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants with defined glycosaminoglycan biosynthetic defects. The action of oligomeric endostatin on these cells was shown to be dependent on cell surface glycosaminoglycans, principally heparan sulfate with N- and 6-O-sulfation of glucosamine residues rather than iduronate 2-O-sulfation being important for bioactivity. The responsiveness of a cell line (pgsE-606) with globally reduced heparan sulfate sulfation and shortened S domains, however, indicates that overall heparan sulfate domain patterning is the key determinant of the bioactivity of oligomeric endostatin. Purified heparin-monomeric endostatin constructs generated by zero-length cross-linking techniques were found to be unable to inhibit the action of oligomeric endostatin. This indicates a mechanism for the perturbation of oligomeric endostatin action by its monomeric counterpart via competition for glycosaminoglycan attachment sites at the cell surface."
