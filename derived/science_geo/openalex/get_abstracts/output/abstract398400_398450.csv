https://openalex.org/W2011580597,"Production of new neurons in the adult hippocampus decreases with age; this decline may underlie age-related cognitive impairment. Here we show that continuous depletion of the neural stem cell pool, as a consequence of their division, may contribute to the age-related decrease in hippocampal neurogenesis. Our results indicate that adult hippocampal stem cells, upon exiting their quiescent state, rapidly undergo a series of asymmetric divisions to produce dividing progeny destined to become neurons and subsequently convert into mature astrocytes. Thus, the decrease in the number of neural stem cells is a division-coupled process and is directly related to their production of new neurons. We present a scheme of the neurogenesis cascade in the adult hippocampus that includes a proposed ""disposable stem cell"" model and accounts for the disappearance of hippocampal neural stem cells, the appearance of new astrocytes, and the age-related decline in the production of new neurons."

We provide a historical perspective of the evolution of the neurosphere assay and highlight limitations in the use of sphere-forming assays in the context of neurospheres. We discuss theoretical and technical considerations of experimental design and interpretation that surround the use of this assay with any tissue. Stem cells are remarkable cells that are found in many tissues. They exhibit two cardinal properties: the ability to undergo self-renewal and the ability to differentiate. Because of these properties, stem cells are of crucial importance for maintaining tissue homeostasis and for tissue repair after injury. Great excitement has arisen about the therapeutic potential of stem cells, as well as recognition of their contribution to pathological states such as tumors. Changes in stem cell properties and the niches they inhabit may also have profound consequences for understanding aging. To explore the dynamics, function, and regulation of stem cells and how these may go awry in disease, experimental assays must reliably be able to distinguish stem cells and their progeny. Due to the general lack of unique cell-surface markers and the absence of a distinct and discernable morphological phenotype, stem cells have typically been defined and studied on the basis of functional criteria. With the development of markers to prospectively identify putative stem cells, as well as sophisticated genetic approaches for lineage tracing, it is becoming increasingly feasible to define the dynamics of stem cells in vivo. Moreover, the ability to prospectively purify stem cells and their progeny has allowed their functional properties to be studied in vitro and their potential to be evaluated by transplantation in vivo. In the last few years, exciting discoveries have been made about the existence of quiescent and activated pools of stem cells and their ability to shuttle between these states. Transit amplifying progeny also have the potential to revert back to a stem cell state, at least in some tissues. As we discover more about the biology and behavior of stem cells within their niches and novel principles emerge, it is important to re-evaluate the strategies utilized to identify and functionally characterize adult stem cells. In particular, it is crucial to distinguish whether different paradigms evaluate actual in vivo stem cells or reveal stem cell potential and to have a clear understanding of the strengths and limitations of different assays. Stem cells from diverse tissues are typically cultured in vitro under nonadherent conditions as spheres, or under adherent conditions in two-dimensional cultures or in three-dimensional matrices. Sphere-forming assays are widely used in stem cell biology, as theoretically both self-renewal and differentiation can be evaluated at the single-cell level. In this Protocol Review, we critically assess the utility and the limitations of sphere-forming assays. As they were first used in the neural stem cell field almost 20 years ago, we provide a historical overview of the evolution of the neurosphere assay, which highlights important lessons that have been learned in the neural stem cell field regarding the identity of neurosphere-forming cells. Indeed, not all neurospheres arise from stem cells, and this finding critically impacts the broadly held premise that sphere-forming assays are a functional assay for uniquely detecting in vivo stem cells. Instead, sphere-forming assays evaluate the potential of a cell to behave as a stem cell when removed from its in vivo niche. We then outline additional important theoretical and technical considerations that incorporate emerging principles in stem cell biology that impact the interpretation of sphere-forming assays when used to evaluate stem cells from any organ. The discovery of adult neural stem cells was the result of two coincident and divergent lines of research. The first was the reinvestigation of adult neurogenesis, and the second was the in vitro study of multipotent precursors from the adult brain. Neural stem cells present in specialized niches in the adult mammalian brain continuously generate new neurons that are functionally integrated into neural circuits, including in humans. Adult neurogenesis occurs in two regions of the mammalian brain: the subventricular zone (SVZ), which is a thin layer of dividing cells adjacent to the lateral ventricles that generates olfactory bulb interneurons, and the subgranular zone (SGZ) in the hippocampal formation. These areas of continuous neurogenesis harbor stem cells that retain the capacity to proliferate, self-renew over an extended period of time, and differentiate into the three primary cell types of the brain (neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes). As the neurosphere assay is almost exclusively used in the SVZ and not the SGZ, from which cells are predominantly cultured as adherent cells, the rest of this review is focused on the SVZ. In the late 1960s, Joseph Altman first showed that new neurons are generated in the adult mammalian brain, yet this finding was largely ignored (Altman, 1969Altman J. Autoradiographic and histological studies of postnatal neurogenesis. IV. Cell proliferation and migration in the anterior forebrain, with special reference to persisting neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb.J. Comp. Neurol. 1969; 137: 433-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). In the 1980s, the group of Fernando Nottebohm showed that new neurons functionally integrate into the adult songbird brain (reviewed in Nottebohm, 2004Nottebohm F. The road we travelled: discovery, choreography, and significance of brain replaceable neurons.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2004; 1016: 628-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, it was not until the early 1990s, when new technical approaches were utilized combining in vivo labeling and in vitro culture, that it was shown that precursors capable of giving rise to neurons were present in the adult mammalian brain and that neurogenesis and long-distance migration occur in vivo (Lois and Alvarez-Buylla, 1993Lois C. Alvarez-Buylla A. Proliferating subventricular zone cells in the adult mammalian forebrain can differentiate into neurons and glia.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1993; 90: 2074-2077Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar, Lois and Alvarez-Buylla, 1994Lois C. Alvarez-Buylla A. Long-distance neuronal migration in the adult mammalian brain.Science. 1994; 264: 1145-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar, Kirschenbaum and Goldman, 1995Kirschenbaum B. Goldman S.A. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor promotes the survival of neurons arising from the adult rat forebrain subependymal zone.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 210-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). At the same time, Reynolds and Weiss first cultured cells that exhibit stem cell properties as free-floating spheres, called neurospheres, from the adult brain (Reynolds and Weiss, 1992Reynolds B.A. Weiss S. Generation of neurons and astrocytes from isolated cells of the adult mammalian central nervous system.Science. 1992; 255: 1707-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (4377) Google Scholar). They dissected striatal tissue, which included the periventricular area encompassing the SVZ, enzymatically dissociated the tissue to single cells and plated them in nonadherent conditions in serum-free medium in the presence of epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Figure 1). A small population of cells began to divide, initially adhering to the plate, and after a few days, detaching and forming spheres of proliferating cells. The majority of cells within these neurospheres expressed nestin, an intermediate filament present in neuroepithelial stem cells in the embryonic brain. To assess whether cells could be propagated as secondary cultures, to show self-renewal, the neurospheres were mechanically dissociated and cultured again in the presence of EGF, with a subset forming secondary neurospheres (Figure 1). When plated on an adherent substrate, they differentiated into both neurons and glial cells. This provided the first evidence that multipotent stem cells were present in the adult mammalian brain. Microdissection experiments subsequently revealed that the SVZ (also called the subependymal zone) is the source of neurospheres in vivo (Morshead et al., 1994Morshead C.M. Reynolds B.A. Craig C.G. McBurney M.W. Staines W.A. Morassutti D. Weiss S. van der Kooy D. Neural stem cells in the adult mammalian forebrain: a relatively quiescent subpopulation of subependymal cells.Neuron. 1994; 13: 1071-1082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). Moreover, it was also proposed that neurospheres only arise from relatively quiescent cells in vivo, based on a series of [3H]-thymidine kill experiments, in which neurospheres were cultured after the in vivo elimination of rapidly dividing cells (Morshead et al., 1994Morshead C.M. Reynolds B.A. Craig C.G. McBurney M.W. Staines W.A. Morassutti D. Weiss S. van der Kooy D. Neural stem cells in the adult mammalian forebrain: a relatively quiescent subpopulation of subependymal cells.Neuron. 1994; 13: 1071-1082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). However, as the cell types in the SVZ had not yet been defined, it was not clear which cells were present when neurospheres were cultured at different time points after the [3H]-thymidine kill. Further experiments revealed that neurospheres can be cultured from the entire ventricular axis of the central nervous system, including the spinal cord (Weiss et al., 1996Weiss S. Dunne C. Hewson J. Wohl C. Wheatley M. Peterson A.C. Reynolds B.A. Multipotent CNS stem cells are present in the adult mammalian spinal cord and ventricular neuroaxis.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7599-7609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Vescovi et al., 1993Vescovi A.L. Reynolds B.A. Fraser D.D. Weiss S. bFGF regulates the proliferative fate of unipotent (neuronal) and bipotent (neuronal/astroglial) EGF-generated CNS progenitor cells.Neuron. 1993; 11: 951-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). However, both bFGF and EGF are required for neurospheres to grow from these non-neurogenic brain regions. EGF neurospheres can only be cultured from the SVZ. Since these early experiments, the neurosphere assay has evolved. It is now accepted that the assay needs to be performed at clonal density. To demonstrate multipotency, individual neurospheres must give rise to neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, the three main cell types in the brain, upon differentiation after withdrawal of growth factors. In addition, although at first neurospheres were considered to be a homogeneous population of nestin+ stem cells, it is now clear that individual neurospheres contain stem cells, progenitors, and differentiated cells. The neurosphere assay therefore appeared to provide a simple retrospective assay to identify cells exhibiting both functional properties of stem cells, self-renewal, and differentiation, as well as a quantitative readout of the number of stem cells in vivo. Importantly, the identity of the in vivo stem cells had not yet been discovered, and it was not feasible to prospectively isolate different cell populations from the SVZ to directly test which cells have the capacity to give rise to neurospheres. A key step in identifying the stem cells responsible for adult neurogenesis, determining their in vivo lineage, and elucidating which cells give rise to neurospheres was defining the cell types and architecture of the SVZ niche. The SVZ has several striking organizational features, best visualized in whole-mount preparations that reveal the entire three-dimensional surface of the ventricular wall (Doetsch and Alvarez-Buylla, 1996Doetsch F. Alvarez-Buylla A. Network of tangential pathways for neuronal migration in adult mammalian brain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 14895-14900Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that stem cells in the adult SVZ are regionally specified and that precursors for different interneuron subtypes reside in different regions (Hack et al., 2005Hack M.A. Saghatelyan A. de Chevigny A.

Goldman J.E. Dorsal radial glia generate olfactory bulb interneurons in the postnatal murine brain.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 4297-4302Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Newly generated neurons migrate from their sites of birth and collect in a network of migrating chains that extends throughout the SVZ to join the rostral migratory stream that leads to the olfactory bulb (Doetsch and Alvarez-Buylla, 1996Doetsch F. Alvarez-Buylla A. Network of tangential pathways for neuronal migration in adult mammalian brain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 14895-14900Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). A small number of oligodendrocytes are also generated in the adult SVZ (Nait-Oumesmar et al., 1999Nait-Oumesmar B. Decker L. Lachapelle F. Avellana-Adalid V. Bachelin C. Van Evercooren A.B. Progenitor cells of the adult mouse subventricular zone proliferate, migrate and differentiate into oligodendrocytes after demyelination.Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 4357-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, Menn et al., 2006Menn B. Garcia-Verdugo J.M. Yaschine C. Gonzalez-Perez O. Rowitch D. Alvarez-Buylla A. Origin of oligodendrocytes in the subventricular zone of the adult brain.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 7907-7918Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). However, it is still unknown if tripotent stem cells exist in vivo or whether separate stem cells give rise to oligodendrocytes and neurons. Initially, ultrastructural analysis was used to identify the cellular populations in the SVZ, as there were no markers available to distinguish the different cell types (Doetsch et al., 1997Doetsch F. García-Verdugo J.M. Alvarez-Buylla A. Cellular composition and three-dimensional organization of the subventricular germinal zone in the adult mammalian brain.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5046-5061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, two markers commonly used to identify neural stem cells, nestin and Sox2, are expressed by all cell types in this region and, therefore, cannot be used as unique markers of stem cells (Doetsch et al., 1997Doetsch F. García-Verdugo J.M. Alvarez-Buylla A. Cellular composition and three-dimensional organization of the subventricular germinal zone in the adult mammalian brain.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5046-5061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Tavazoie et al., 2008Tavazoie M. Van der Veken L. Silva-Vargas V. Louissaint M. Colonna L. Zaidi B. Garcia-Verdugo J.M. Doetsch F. A specialized vascular niche for adult neural stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 13: 279-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Four main classes of cells are present in the SVZ (Figure 2). Multiciliated ependymal cells (Type E cells) line the ventricles. The chains of neuroblasts (Type A cells) travel through tunnels formed by the processes of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)+ cells with many ultrastructural features of astrocytes (Type B cells). Rapidly dividing transit-amplifying cells (Type C cells) are clustered adjacent to the chains of neuroblasts. Cell ablation and lineage-tracing studies established the SVZ stem cell lineage. Intriguingly, cells with several hallmarks of glial cells, long thought to be support cells in the brain and derived from a completely different lineage than neurons, are stem cells in both adult neurogenic regions (reviewed in Kriegstein and Alvarez-Buylla, 2009Kriegstein A. Alvarez-Buylla A. The glial nature of embryonic and adult neural stem cells.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 32: 149-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar). Within the SVZ, GFAP-positive (Type B) cells are stem cells both during regeneration and under homeostasis (Doetsch et al., 1999aDoetsch F. Caillé I. Lim D.A. García-Verdugo J.M. Alvarez-Buylla A. Subventricular zone astrocytes are neural stem cells in the adult mammalian brain.Cell. 1999; 97: 703-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3102) Google Scholar). They divide to generate transit amplifying cells, which in turn give rise to neuroblasts (Figure 2). Furthermore, a subset of GFAP+ cells form neuropheres. At the time that GFAP+ cells were identified as stem cells, ependymal cells were also proposed to be stem cells in the SVZ (Johansson et al., 1999Johansson C.B. Momma S. Clarke D.L. Risling M. Lendahl U. Frisén J. Identification of a neural stem cell in the adult mammalian central nervous system.Cell. 1999; 96: 25-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar). This debate was largely resolved as more sophisticated genetic labeling and purification strategies were developed. This finding was not replicated by others (reviewed in Kokovay et al., 2008Kokovay E. Shen Q. Temple S. The incredible elastic brain: how neural stem cells expand our minds.Neuron. 2008; 60: 420-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and the original group proposing that ependymal cells form neurospheres has recently published that they do not give rise to neurons under homeostasis (Carlén et al., 2009Carlén M. Meletis K. Göritz C. Darsalia V. Evergren E. Tanigaki K. Amendola M. Barnabé-Heider F. Yeung M.S. Naldini L. et al.Forebrain ependymal cells are Notch-dependent and generate neuroblasts and astrocytes after stroke.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). However, several recent papers have resurrected the idea that multiciliated ependymal cells are stem cells, based on the claim that CD133 and FoxJ1 are exclusively expressed by ependymal cells and can be used to purify them (Coskun et al., 2008Coskun V. Wu H. Blanchi B. Tsao S. Kim K. Zhao J. Biancotti J.C. Hutnick L. Krueger Jr., R.C. Fan G. et al.CD133+ neural stem cells in the ependyma of mammalian postnatal forebrain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 1026-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, Meletis et al., 2008Meletis K. Barnabé-Heider F. Carlén M. Evergren E. Tomilin N. Shupliakov O. Frisén J. Spinal cord injury reveals multilineage differentiation of ependymal cells.PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e182Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). However, both markers are also expressed by a subpopulation of GFAP+ cells (see below); the specificity of these markers in non-neurogenic brain regions needs to be better defined using high resolution ultrastructural and molecular analysis. Later experiments in which dividing GFAP+ cells were killed in GFAP-TK mice confirmed that GFAP+ cells are the source of adult generated neurons (García et al., 2004García A.D. Doan N.B. Imura T. Bush T.G. Sofroniew M.V. GFAP-expressing progenitors are the principal source of constitutive neurogenesis in adult mouse forebrain.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 1233-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, Imura et al., 2003Imura T. Kornblum H.I. Sofroniew M.V. The predominant neural stem cell isolated from postnatal and adult forebrain but not early embryonic forebrain expresses GFAP.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2824-2832PubMed Google Scholar, Morshead et al., 2003Morshead C.M. Garcia A.D. Sofroniew M.V. van Der Kooy D. The ablation of glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive cells from the adult central nervous system results in the loss of forebrain neural stem cells but not retinal stem cells.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 18: 76-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, even now, a critical issue is the lack of markers available to distinguish between GFAP+ stem cells and other brain astrocytes, as well as how they differ in their functional roles and potential. Another important, and ongoing issue, is the identity and dynamics of putative quiescent stem cells in the adult SVZ. Based on regeneration studies, a pool of slowly dividing B cells escapes being killed by an anti-mitotic drug and rapidly regenerates the SVZ (Doetsch et al., 1999aDoetsch F. Caillé I. Lim D.A. García-Verdugo J.M. Alvarez-Buylla A. Subventricular zone astrocytes are neural stem cells in the adult mammalian brain.Cell. 1999; 97: 703-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3102) Google Scholar). Markers have not yet been defined that allow the purification of these quiescent cells. Moreover it is still unknown whether these cells are only activated during injury or whether a deeply quiescent pool participates in neurogenesis under homeostasis as well. A crucial advance in defining which cells form neurospheres was the identification of markers that allow populations at different stages of the lineage to be isolated or killed using genetic approaches. A very active effort in the neural stem cell field is to define the heterogeneity of GFAP+ cells within the SVZ and elsewhere in the brain and assess their stem cell potential. Important insights have arisen from anatomical, ultrastructural, and functional analysis. Early studies using electron microscopy identified two populations of GFAP+ Type B cells in the SVZ. Type B1 cells extend a process between ependymal cells to contact the lateral ventricle and have a primary cilium (Doetsch et al., 1999bDoetsch F. García-Verdugo J.M. Alvarez-Buylla A. Regeneration of a germinal layer in the adult mammalian brain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 11619-11624Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Type B2 cells are located closer to the vasculature and divide more frequently (Doetsch et al., 1997Doetsch F. García-Verdugo J.M. Alvarez-Buylla A. Cellular composition and three-dimensional organization of the subventricular germinal zone in the adult mammalian brain.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5046-5061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Figure 2). Recent work has uncovered important new features of the SVZ niche (Mirzadeh et al., 2008Mirzadeh Z. Merkle F.T. Soriano-Navarro M. Garcia-Verdugo J.M. Alvarez-Buylla A.

A specialized vascular niche for adult neural stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 13: 279-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (776) Google Scholar), which sheds light on the functional organization of GFAP+ Type B cells. Ependymal cells are organized as a series of pinwheels along the ventricular wall with Type B1 astrocytes contacting the ventricle at the center of these pinwheels (Mirzadeh et al., 2008Mirzadeh Z. Merkle F.T. Soriano-Navarro M. Garcia-Verdugo J.M. Alvarez-Buylla A. Neural stem cells confer unique pinwheel architecture to the ventricular surface in neurogenic regions of the adult brain.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 265-278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar) (Figure 2). In addition, a planar vascular plexus extends throughout the length of the SVZ (Shen et al., 2008Shen Q. Wang Y. Kokovay E. Lin G. Chuang S.M. Goderie S.K. Roysam B. Temple S.

Both stem cells and transit-amplifying cells are tightly associated with this vascular plexus and contact it at specialized sites that lack astrocyte endfeet (Shen et al., 2008Shen Q. Wang Y.

Several markers have now been identified that distinguish different subpopulations of Type B cells in the SVZ and have allowed their prospective purification (Pastrana et al., 2009Pastrana E.

Importantly, some of these markers are coexpressed by multiple cell types, such as CD133 (prominin), which is expressed by both ependymal cells and a subset of B1 cells contacting the ventricle (Coskun et al., 2008Coskun V.

https://openalex.org/W2118532317,"We report the immediate effects of estrogen signaling on the transcriptome of breast cancer cells using global run-on and sequencing (GRO-seq). The data were analyzed using a new bioinformatic approach that allowed us to identify transcripts directly from the GRO-seq data. We found that estrogen signaling directly regulates a strikingly large fraction of the transcriptome in a rapid, robust, and unexpectedly transient manner. In addition to protein-coding genes, estrogen regulates the distribution and activity of all three RNA polymerases and virtually every class of noncoding RNA that has been described to date. We also identified a large number of previously undetected estrogen-regulated intergenic transcripts, many of which are found proximal to estrogen receptor binding sites. Collectively, our results provide the most comprehensive measurement of the primary and immediate estrogen effects to date and a resource for understanding rapid signal-dependent transcription in other systems."
https://openalex.org/W2134975640,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous, small noncoding RNAs that play important roles in various cellular functions and tumor development. Recent studies have indicated that miR-21 is one of the important miRNAs associated with tumor growth and metastasis, but the role and molecular mechanism of miR-21 in regulating tumor angiogenesis remain to be elucidated. In this study, miR-21 was overexpressed by transfecting pre-miR-21 into human prostate cancer cells and tumor angiogenesis was assayed using chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). We found that overexpression of miR-21 in DU145 cells increased the expression of HIF-1α and VEGF, and induced tumor angiogenesis. AKT and extracellular regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2 are activated by miR-21. Inhibition of miR-21 by the antigomir blocked this process. Overexpression of the miR-21 target, PTEN, also inhibited tumor angiogenesis by partially inactivating AKT and ERK and decreasing the expression of HIF-1 and VEGF. The AKT and ERK inhibitors, LY294002 and U0126, suppressed HIF-1α and VEGF expression and angiogenesis. Moreover, inhibition of HIF-1α expression alone abolished miR-21-inducing tumor angiogenesis, indicating that HIF-1α is required for miR-21-upregulated angiogenesis. Therefore, we demonstrate that miR-21 induces tumor angiogenesis through targeting PTEN, leading to activate AKT and ERK1/2 signaling pathways, and thereby enhancing HIF-1α and VEGF expression; HIF-1α is a key downstream target of miR-21 in regulating tumor angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2027275966,"<h2>Summary</h2> In adult skin, stem cells in the hair follicle bulge cyclically regenerate the follicle, whereas a distinct stem cell population maintains the epidermis. The degree to which all bulge cells have equal regenerative potential is not known. We found that Sonic hedgehog (Shh) from neurons signals to a population of cells in the telogen bulge marked by the Hedgehog response gene <i>Gli1</i>. Gli1-expressing bulge cells function as multipotent stem cells in their native environment and repeatedly regenerate the anagen follicle. Shh-responding perineural bulge cells incorporate into healing skin wounds where, notably, they can change their lineage into epidermal stem cells. The perineural niche (including Shh) is dispensable for follicle contributions to acute wound healing and skin homeostasis, but is necessary to maintain bulge cells capable of becoming epidermal stem cells. Thus, nerves cultivate a microenvironment where Shh creates a molecularly and phenotypically distinct population of hair follicle stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W1981127983,"Neurofibrillary tangles, composed of insoluble aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein Tau, are a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD) and other tauopathies. However, recent evidence indicates that neuronal dysfunction precedes the formation of these insoluble fibrillar deposits, suggesting that earlier prefibrillar Tau aggregates may be neurotoxic. To determine the composition of these aggregates, we have employed a photochemical cross-linking technique to examine intermolecular interactions of full-length Tau in vitro. Using this method, we demonstrate that dimerization is an early event in the Tau aggregation process and that these dimers self-associate to form larger oligomeric aggregates. Moreover, using these stabilized Tau aggregates as immunogens, we generated a monoclonal antibody that selectively recognizes Tau dimers and higher order oligomeric aggregates but shows little reactivity to Tau filaments in vitro. Immunostaining indicates that these dimers/oligomers are markedly elevated in AD, appearing in early pathological inclusions such as neuropil threads and pretangle neurons as well as colocalizing with other early markers of Tau pathogenesis. Taken as a whole, the work presented herein demonstrates the existence of alternative Tau aggregates that precede formation of fibrillar Tau pathologies and raises the possibility that these hierarchical oligomeric forms of Tau may contribute to neurodegeneration.

Here we use genome-wide transgenic RNAi to identify 620 genes potentially involved in controlling this balance in Drosophila neuroblasts. We quantify all phenotypes and derive measurements for proliferation, lineage, cell size, and cell shape. We identify a set of transcriptional regulators essential for self-renewal and use hierarchical clustering and integration with interaction data to create functional networks for the control of neuroblast self-renewal and differentiation. Our data identify key roles for the chromatin remodeling Brm complex, the spliceosome, and the TRiC/CCT-complex and show that the alternatively spliced transcription factor Lola and the transcriptional elongation factors Ssrp and Barc control self-renewal in neuroblast lineages. As our data are strongly enriched for genes highly expressed in murine neural stem cells, they are likely to provide valuable insights into mammalian stem cell biology as well."
https://openalex.org/W2070427701,"Somatic stem cells mediate tissue maintenance for the lifetime of an organism. Despite the well-established longevity that is a prerequisite for such function, accumulating data argue for compromised stem cell function with age. Identifying the mechanisms underlying age-dependent stem cell dysfunction is therefore key to understanding the aging process. Here, using a model carrying a proofreading-defective mitochondrial DNA polymerase, we demonstrate hematopoietic defects reminiscent of premature HSC aging, including anemia, lymphopenia, and myeloid lineage skewing. However, in contrast to physiological stem cell aging, rapidly accumulating mitochondrial DNA mutations had little functional effect on the hematopoietic stem cell pool, and instead caused distinct differentiation blocks and/or disappearance of downstream progenitors. These results show that intact mitochondrial function is required for appropriate multilineage stem cell differentiation, but argue against mitochondrial DNA mutations per se being a primary driver of somatic stem cell aging."
https://openalex.org/W2081695451,"The glycosyltransferase, ST6Gal-I, adds sialic acid in an α2–6 linkage to the N-glycans of membrane and secreted glycoproteins. Up-regulation of ST6Gal-I occurs in many cancers, including colon carcinoma, and correlates with metastasis and poor prognosis. However, mechanisms by which ST6Gal-I facilitates tumor progression remain poorly understood due to limited knowledge of enzyme substrates. Herein we identify the death receptor, Fas (CD95), as an ST6Gal-I substrate, and show that α2–6 sialylation of Fas confers protection against Fas-mediated apoptosis. Intriguingly, differences in ST6Gal-I activity do not affect the function of DR4 or DR5 death receptors upon treatment with TRAIL, implicating a selective effect of ST6Gal-I on the Fas receptor. Using ST6Gal-I knockdown and forced overexpression colon carcinoma cell models, we find that α2–6 sialylation of Fas prevents apoptosis stimulated by FasL as well as the Fas-activating antibody, CH11, as evidenced by decreased activation of caspases 8 and 3. We also show that α2–6 sialylation of Fas does not alter the binding of CH11, but rather inhibits the capacity of Fas to induce apoptosis by blocking the association of FADD with Fas cytoplasmic tails, an event that initiates death-inducing signaling complex formation. Furthermore, α2–6 sialylation of Fas inhibits Fas internalization, which is required for apoptotic signaling. Although dysregulated Fas activity is a well known mechanism through which tumors evade apoptosis, the current study is the first to link Fas insensitivity to the actions of a specific sialyltransferase. This finding establishes a new paradigm by which death receptor function is impaired for the self-protection of tumors against apoptosis.

This finding establishes a new paradigm by which death receptor function is impaired for the self-protection of tumors against apoptosis. The ability to evade apoptosis is one of the defining characteristics of a malignant tumor cell (1Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22400) Google Scholar). Escape from cell death can be accomplished through alterations in various cellular components, including dysregulation of oncogenes and tumor suppressors, and mutations in apoptotic and anti-apoptotic signaling machinery.

TNF family of death receptors death-inducing signaling complex immobilized pH gradient Maackia amurensis agglutinin Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule Sambucus Nigra agglutinin. The Fas death receptor, like other TNFRs, is a homotrimeric transmembrane receptor that activates multiple intracellular signaling cascades, one of which directs apoptosis. Upon association with activating ligands, Fas undergoes higher order clustering, which facilitates the binding of cytosolic proteins to the Fas cytoplasmic tails. The first protein recruited to the Fas tails is FADD, which binds to Fas through a region known as the death domain. Several other proteins, including procaspase 8 and procaspase 10, are then recruited to the Fas/FADD complex, and together these proteins form the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). This complex is internalized through clathrin-mediated endocytosis and allows for further DISC formation required for apoptotic signaling (4Lee K.H. Feig C. Tchikov V. Schickel R. Hallas C. Schütze S. Peter M.E. Chan A.C. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1009-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). This enhanced formation of the DISC leads to the autolytic cleavage and activation of procaspase 8, which goes on to cleave the effector caspase, caspase 3, ultimately resulting in apoptotic endpoints such as membrane blebbing and DNA fragmentation (2Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3018) Google Scholar). Diminished Fas expression and activity are well established as mechanisms responsible for the apoptotic resistance of tumor cells. A myriad of studies have reported alterations in the expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic components involved in the Fas pathway such as c-FLIP, BAX, and BCL-2 (5Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4811) Google Scholar, 6Meijerink J.P. Mensink E.J. Wang K. Sedlak T.W. Slöetjes A.W. de Witte T. Waksman G. Korsmeyer S.J.

Additionally, in many tumor types there is up-regulation of the endogenous ligand for the Fas receptor, FasL, which is thought to provide a mechanism of self-conservation for tumor cells through FasL-directed killing of tumor-invading immune cells (8Walker P.R. Saas P. Dietrich P.Y. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4521-4524PubMed Google Scholar). However, despite the extensive research focused on changes in the expression level of Fas and associated signaling molecules, very few studies have investigated molecular mechanisms that alter Fas function independent of variant protein expression, for example, post-translational modifications such as glycosylation. The Fas receptor is modified with both O- and N-linked glycans (9Li Y. Yang X. Nguyen A.H. Brockhausen I. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2007; 39: 1625-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), although the functional significance of these glycoconjugates in Fas signaling has received minimal attention. It has been known for decades that tumor cells express an altered profile of cell surface oligosaccharides, and in fact there is a specific subset of glycosylating enzymes exhibiting aberrant activity in human cancers. The ST6Gal-I sialyltransferase is one of the enzymes up-regulated in multiple types of cancer (10Petretti T. Schulze B. Schlag P.M. Kemmner W. Biochim. Biophys.

ST6Gal-I is responsible for the addition of the negatively charged sugar, sialic acid, in an α2–6 linkage to the N-linked glycans of cell surface or secreted glycoproteins. In the current study we have identified Fas as an ST6Gal-I substrate and further determined that α2–6 sialylation of Fas inhibits Fas-mediated cell death. These collective results elucidate a novel mechanism by which tumor cells evade apoptosis. HD3 colon epithelial cells expressing oncogenic ras were developed as previously reported (18Seales E.C. Jurado G.A. Singhal A. Bellis S.L. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7137-7145Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These HD3 cells were then transduced with lentivirus (purchased from Sigma) containing either shRNA sequence against ST6Gal1 (HD3.sh) or an empty vector (HD3.ev). A pooled population of clones stably expressing shRNA was generated by puromycin selection. Down-regulation of ST6Gal-I expression was confirmed by Western blot (19Shaikh F.M. Seales E.C. Clem W.C. Hennessy K.M. Zhuo Y. Bellis S.L. Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 2941-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). SW48 cells were purchased from ATCC. These cells were transduced with either lentivirus containing rat liver ST6Gal-I cDNA (SW.ST6) or lentivirus containing an empty vector (SW.ev). The original ST6Gal-I plasmid was obtained from Dr. Karen Colley (University of Illinois, Chicago), and lentiviral vectors developed from this plasmid were constructed by Dr. John Wakefield (OpenBiosystems, Inc.). SW.ST6 cells represent a pooled population of stably transduced clones, isolated by puromycin selection. Confirmation of expression and functionality of ST6Gal-I has been published previously (20Seales E.C. Jurado G.A. Brunson B.A. Wakefield J.K. Frost A.R. Bellis S.L. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 4645-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). HD3 cells were maintained in low glucose (1 g/liter) DMEM with 7% FBS and 1% antibiotic/antifungal containing penicillin G, streptomycin sulfate, and amphotericin B (Invitrogen). SW48 cells were maintained in 1X-L15 medium with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotic/antifungal. To induce apoptosis, cells were treated with either 4 ng/ml membrane-bound FasL (Millipore), 0.5 mg/ml CH11 (Millipore), or 2 mg/ml TRAIL (Biomol International) for 18 h (see FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3 below) or 6 h (see Fig. 5C). Cells were then lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) with 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Bioscience). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% dried nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.01% Tween 20 blocking buffer at room temperature for 1 h. The membranes were then subjected to primary antibody against cleaved caspase 3 (Cell Signaling), cleaved caspase 8 (Cell Signaling), Fas (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), FADD (Cell Signaling), DR4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), DR5 (ProSci Inc.), and β-tubulin (Abcam) overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed and then subjected to HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Proteins were visualized by using Immobilon (Millipore).FIGURE 2FLICA staining of cleaved caspases 3 and 7 demonstrates that ST6Gal-I protects cells from Fas- but not DR4/DR5-mediated apoptosis. A, HD3.par and HD3.sh cells were stained with FLICA in the absence of CH11 treatment (panels 1 and 2), which revealed negligible activation of caspases 3 and 7 in both cell lines. Upon treatment with CH11, there is more activated caspase 3 and 7 staining in HD3.sh (panel 4) as compared with HD3.par (panel 3). There are also changes in colony and individual cell morphology, indicating apoptosis. Additionally, as can be seen in B, there is nuclear condensation verifying apoptosis (white arrows) in the HD3.sh after treatment with CH11. C, to induce DR4/DR5 signaling, cells were treated with TRAIL. Minimal FLICA staining was observed in the absence of treatment (panels 1 and 2), whereas extensive and comparable amounts of cleaved caspases 3 and 7 were observed in HD3.par (panel 3) and HD3.sh (panel 4) cells, indicating that ST6Gal-I activity does not protect against DR4/5-directed apoptosis (orange, FLICA staining of cleaved caspases 3 and 7; blue, Hoechst staining for nuclei).

The binding levels for both cell lines are very similar. B, CH11 binding curve. Flow cytometric analyses of cells treated with CH11 at 1, 10, 20, or 40 μg/ml revealed comparable mean fluorescent intensities (MFI) at all concentrations. Values for MFI were normalized to the IgM control. C, caspase 8 cleavage is affected by variant Fas sialylation. Cells were treated with CH11, and lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for cleaved caspase 8. The level of cleaved caspase 8 is higher in the HD3.sh as compared with HD3.par upon treatment with CH11, indicating enhanced cleavage of caspase 8 when ST6Gal-I is down-regulated. D, DISC formation enhanced by knockdown of ST6Gal-I. DISC components were isolated by treating cells at 4 °C (control) or 37 °C for 30 min with CH11 and precipitating through anti-IgM-conjugated agarose beads. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted for the Fas-binding protein, FADD. As shown, there is more FADD in HD3.sh after Fas activation with CH11 at 37 °C, indicating more DISC formation in ST6Gal-I deficient cells. The PVDF membrane was stripped and reprobed for the presence of Fas to verify equal immunoprecipitation. Densitometry was used to quantify the FADD and Fas bands, and the FADD:Fas ratio was calculated. Values shown represent the averages from two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cells were grown on chamber slides and treated with the Fas-activating antibody, CH11 (Millipore) at 0.5 mg/ml or TRAIL (Biomol International) at 2 mg/ml for 18 h. The reaction was then stopped with ice-cold PBS. The protocol for the Caspases 3 and 7 FLICA Apoptosis Detection Kit was followed as recommended by the manufacturer (Immunochemistry Technologies). The slides were imaged by band-pass filter with excitation at 550 nm and emission at 580 nm for the red fluorescence of cleaved caspases 3 and 7, and UV-filter with excitation at 365 nm and emission at 480 nm for Hoescht staining of the nuclei. For quantification, the percentage of apoptosis was calculated as the number of FLICA-positive cells compared with the total number of cells in three independent fields of view. Statistical analysis was performed by repeated-measure analysis of variance, with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Cell lysate protein (1000 μg) was incubated overnight with 50 μl of immobilized SNA-1 or MAA lectin (EY Laboratories) with rotation at 4 °C. The α2–6 sialylated proteins complexed with SNA or α2–3 sialylated proteins complexed with MAA lectin were collected by brief centrifugation and washed. Sialylated proteins were released from the complexes by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The proteins were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted to detect Fas. HD3 whole cell lysates were prepared by lysing in lysis buffer with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) with 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Bioscience). Lysates were then diluted in isoelectric focusing rehydration buffer containing 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 30 mm DTT, 0.5% ampholytes, and trace bromphenol blue. Samples were used to rehydrate 11-cm, 3–10 linear gradient IPG strips for 16 h in Drystrip Reswelling tray. For the first dimension, IPG strips were focused using Amersham Biosciences IPGphor II isoelectric focusing unit at 50 μA per strip at 20 °C. For the second dimension, strips were equilibrated in DTT equilibration buffer containing 6 m urea, 20% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 2% SDS, 65 mm DTT, and trace bromphenol blue for 30 min and in IA equilibration buffer containing 6 m urea, 20% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 2% SDS, 2.5% iodoacetamide, and trace bromphenol blue for 15 min. Strips were then electrophoresed on 12.5% criterion gels (Bio-Rad) at a 100-V constant in the Bio-Rad Criterion gel box. Proteins were then transferred to PVDF membranes and immunoblotted for Fas (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cells were harvested non-enzymatically from tissue culture dishes using Cell Stripper solution (Cellgro). Cells were then resuspended into ice-cold PBS containing 0.2% heat-denatured BSA. For the antibody binding assay: cells were treated with CH11 (Millipore) at 20 μg/ml or IgM control for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were then incubated with FITC-tagged secondary antibodies. For the CH11 binding curve, the same experiment was performed using a range of CH11 concentrations, including 1, 10, 20, or 40 μg/ml. For Fas expression: cells were treated with FITC-conjugated anti-human CD95 (BC Pharmingen) for 1 h at 4 °C. After labeling, cells were washed in PBS/BSA and then analyzed with a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Arthritis and Musculoskeletal Center Analytic and Preparative Core Facility. DISC components were immunoprecipitated by treating 8.0 × 106 cells with 1.0 μg/ml CH11 (Millipore) in media at 4 °C (control) or 37 °C for 30 min. Treatment was stopped by the addition of ice-cold PBS. Cells were centrifuged to remove unbound antibody and washed with ice-cold PBS. Cells were then subjected to lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) with 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Bioscience) on ice for 15 min. Samples were centrifuged, and supernatant was collected and rotated overnight with 40 μl of prewashed anti-IgM-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma). Precipitated proteins were released from the complexes by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for the Fas-binding protein, FADD (Cell Signaling Technology). The PVDF membrane was then stripped with Restore Western Blot Stripping Buffer (Thermo Scientific) and reprobed with Fas (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as previously described. Cells were lifted from the tissue culture plastic with trypsin, and trypsin activity was stopped with trypsin inhibitor. Cells were resuspended in media with 1.0 μg/ml CH11 (Millipore) at 4 °C (control) or were warmed to 37 °C for 30 min to activate internalization. Cells were washed and resuspended in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS and fixed for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed and resuspended in media with 1.25 μg/ml anti-mouse IgM Alexa 488 (Invitrogen) at 4 °C for 1 h. Stained cells were then washed and resuspended in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and plated on a glass microscope slide. Slides were imaged with the Zeiss LSM 710 laser confocal scanning microscope. To evaluate the role of ST6Gal-I-mediated sialylation in regulating tumor cell behavior, we previously developed a cell model system with variant levels of ST6Gal-I expression. HD3 colon carcinoma cells express high levels of endogenous ST6Gal-I as a secondary consequence of oncogenic ras activity (18Seales E.C. Jurado G.A. Singhal A. Bellis S.L. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7137-7145Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This cell line was subsequently stably transduced with shRNA to force down-regulation of ST6Gal-I (19Shaikh F.M. Seales E.C. Clem W.C. Hennessy K.M. Zhuo Y. Bellis S.L. Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 2941-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the current study, the parental HD3 cell line expressing high endogenous ST6Gal-I (HD3.par) and the shRNA knockdown of ST6Gal-I (HD3.sh) were treated with either the ligand for DR4 and DR5, TRAIL, or the Fas-activating antibody, CH11. Levels of apoptosis were then evaluated by immunoblotting for the apoptotic marker, cleaved caspase 3. As shown in Fig. 1A, when treated with CH11, HD3.sh cells exhibited a markedly greater degree of cleaved caspase 3 than HD3.par cells, suggesting that low levels of ST6Gal-I-mediated sialylation were associated with enhanced Fas-mediated apoptosis. In contrast, equally high levels of activated caspase 3 were observed in cells treated with TRAIL. Thus, variant levels of ST6Gal-I sialylation appeared to modulate apoptosis induced by Fas receptors, but not DR4 or DR5. To ensure that ST6Gal-I knockdown did not alter the expression of death receptors, Western blots of Fas, DR4, and DR5 were performed, which showed equivalent levels in the HD3.par and HD3.sh cells (Fig. 1B). To further investigate the selective protection by ST6Gal-I against Fas-mediated apoptosis, we again treated the cells with TRAIL or CH11 and monitored apoptosis through immunofluorescence staining with the FLICA reagent, which binds to activated caspases 3 and 7 (cells were counterstained with Hoechst to reveal cell nuclei). HD3.par cells treated with CH11 displayed a small apparent increase in FLICA staining relative to untreated HD3.par cells, however extensive FLICA staining was observed in the CH11-treated HD3.sh cells (Fig. 2A). In addition, CH11-treated HD3.sh cells exhibited condensed nuclei, and a disruption in the integrity of cell colonies, both indicative of apoptotic activity (Fig. 2B). In contrast to the effects of CH11, treatment with TRAIL induced very strong caspase activation in both the HD3.par and HD3.sh cells (Fig. 2C). Analysis of the percentage of apoptosis can be seen in Fig. 2D. These data suggest that sialylation by ST6Gal-I protects HD3 cells from apoptosis induced by the Fas receptor, but not DR4/DR5, and importantly, that ST6Gal-I knockdown can sensitize cells to Fas-mediated cell death. Although the CH11 antibody is commonly used to stimulate Fas-mediated apoptosis, it was important to examine the effects of ST6Gal-I on apoptosis induced by the biologic ligand for the Fas receptor, FasL. HD3.par, HD3.sh, and additionally, an empty vector control cell line (HD3.ev) were treated with either CH11 or FasL and immunoblotted for cleaved caspase 3. As shown in Fig. 3A, HD3.sh cells displayed higher levels of cleaved caspase 3 in response to both FasL and CH11 as compared with HD3.par and HD3.ev cells, confirming that diminished α2–6 sialylation renders cells more susceptible to two independent Fas activators. Having shown that ST6Gal-I knockdown enhances Fas-mediated apoptosis, we next evaluated whether overexpression of the enzyme in cells with low endogenous ST6Gal-I would inhibit Fas-induced apoptosis. To this end we monitored cell death in the SW48 colon epithelial cell model, which lacks any detectable expression of ST6Gal-I (21Dall'Olio F. Chiricolo M. Lollini P. Lau J.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 554-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Previously we generated an SW48 cell line that stably expresses ST6Gal-I and verified protein expression and enzyme activity (20Seales E.C. Jurado G.A. Brunson B.A. Wakefield J.K. Frost A.R. Bellis S.L. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 4645-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). SW48 parental cells (SW.par), which have no ST6Gal-I, SW48 cells with forced expression of ST6Gal-I (SW.ST6), and an SW48 cell line transduced with an empty vector lentivirus (SW.ev) were treated with CH11 or FasL and surveyed for apoptosis (Fig. 3B). These experiments revealed substantially lower levels of activated caspase 3 in SW.ST6 cells compared with SW.par and SW.ev cells. Hence, the combined results in Fig. 3 establish that ST6Gal-I activity confers protection against apoptosis induced by both the Fas-activating antibody, CH11, and also the endogenous ligand, FasL, in two distinct colon carcinoma cell models. We next sought to determine if the Fas receptor is a direct target for α2–6 sialylation by ST6Gal-I, given that this receptor is known to have two possible N-linked glycosylation sites (22Oehm A. Behrmann I. Falk W. Pawlita M. Maier G. Klas C. Li-Weber M. Richards S. Dhein J. Trauth B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10709-10715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Itoh N. Yonehara S.

To address this, cell lysates were incubated with agarose-conjugated SNA, a lectin that binds specifically to α2–6-linked sialic acids. Samples were centrifuged to selectively precipitate α2–6 sialylated proteins, and α2–6 sialylated proteins were then immunoblotted for the Fas receptor. As depicted in Fig. 4A, the band representing Fas in the SNA precipitates from HD3.par cells is denser than that noted in precipitates from HD3.sh cells, indicating more sialylated Fas in the presence of high ST6Gal-I expression. However, no differences were observed in the amount of Fas present in whole cell lysates (representing total Fas protein), indicating that variant ST6Gal-I expression alters Fas sialylation but not Fas protein expression. Also, MAA lectin precipitation (specific for α2–3 sialic acids) revealed that, despite a decrease in α2–6 sialylation, there was no change in α2–3 sialylation of the Fas receptor (Fig. 4A). SNA precipitation analyses performed with SW48 cells yielded similar results; Fas was found to be heavily sialylated in SW48 cells with forced expression of ST6Gal-I (SW.ST6 cells), whereas the Fas receptor expressed by parental and empty-vector SW48 cells lacked α2–6 sialylation, as can be seen in Fig. 4B. (MAA precipitation of SW48 cell lysate was not performed as these cells have no α2–3 sialyltransferases (21Dall'Olio F. Chiricolo M. Lollini P. Lau J.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 554-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).) As with HD3 cells, variant expression of ST6Gal-I did not alter total Fas protein levels. To further confirm Fas as an ST6Gal-I substrate, whole cell lysates from HD3.ev and HD3.sh cells were resolved using two-dimensional electrophoresis to separate proteins by both molecular weight and isoelectric point, and then immunoblotting was performed to detect Fas isoforms (Fig. 4C). Several Fas isoforms were revealed by this assay; however, a higher molecular weight, more negatively charged band was missing from the HD3.sh lysates. These results are consistent with the loss of a sialylated Fas isoform in cells with ST6Gal-I knockdown. We also used flow cytometry to show that variant Fas sialylation did not change the levels of cell surface Fas expression (Fig. 4D). One possible explanation for the decrease in apoptotic signaling from sialylated Fas receptors was that sialic acids might sterically block the binding of Fas activators to the ligand-binding domain.

Arsenic interaction with DNA repair proteins containing functional zinc finger motifs is one proposed mechanism to account for these observations. Here, we report that arsenite binds to both CCHC DNA-binding zinc fingers of the DNA repair protein PARP-1 (poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1). Furthermore, trivalent arsenite coordinated with all three cysteine residues as demonstrated by MS/MS. MALDI-TOF-MS analysis of peptides harboring site-directed substitutions of cysteine with histidine residues within the PARP-1 zinc finger revealed that arsenite bound to peptides containing three or four cysteine residues, but not to peptides with two cysteines, demonstrating arsenite binding selectivity. This finding was not unique to PARP-1; arsenite did not bind to a peptide representing the CCHH zinc finger of the DNA repair protein aprataxin, but did bind to an aprataxin peptide mutated to a CCHC zinc finger. To investigate the impact of arsenite on PARP-1 zinc finger function, we measured the zinc content and DNA-binding capacity of PARP-1 immunoprecipitated from arsenite-exposed cells. PARP-1 zinc content and DNA binding were decreased by 76 and 80%, respectively, compared with protein isolated from untreated cells. We observed comparable decreases in zinc content for XPA (xeroderma pigmentosum group A) protein (CCCC zinc finger), but not SP-1 (specificity protein-1) or aprataxin (CCHH zinc finger). These findings demonstrate that PARP-1 is a direct molecular target of arsenite and that arsenite interacts selectively with zinc finger motifs containing three or more cysteine residues."
https://openalex.org/W2137833675,"The neurotransmitter glutamate is released by excitatory projection neurons throughout the brain. However, non-glutamatergic cells, including cholinergic and monoaminergic neurons, express markers that suggest that they are also capable of vesicular glutamate release. Striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs) express the Type-3 vesicular glutamate transporter (VGluT3), although whether they form functional glutamatergic synapses is unclear. To examine this possibility, we utilized mice expressing Cre-recombinase under control of the endogenous choline acetyltransferase locus and conditionally expressed light-activated Channelrhodopsin2 in CINs. Optical stimulation evoked action potentials in CINs and produced postsynaptic responses in medium spiny neurons that were blocked by glutamate receptor antagonists. CIN-mediated glutamatergic responses exhibited a large contribution of NMDA-type glutamate receptors, distinguishing them from corticostriatal inputs. CIN-mediated glutamatergic responses were insensitive to antagonists of acetylcholine receptors and were not seen in mice lacking VGluT3. Our results indicate that CINs are capable of mediating fast glutamatergic transmission, suggesting a new role for these cells in regulating striatal activity."

We analyzed the fluctuations of antibodies against EBV before histopathological diagnosis to assess the risk of NPC and aimed to provide a reliable basis for screening in high risk populations.This study was based on a population-based screening program in Sihui County in Guangdong Province of China. A total of 18,986 subjects were recruited in 1987 and 1992, respectively. Baseline and repeated serological tests were performed for IgA antibodies against EBV capsid antigen (VCA/IgA) and early antigen (EA/IgA). Follow-up until the end of 2007 was accomplished through linkage with population and health registers. Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to estimate the relative risk of NPC in association with EBV antibodies. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was used to further evaluate the predictive ability.A total of 125 NPCs occurred during an average of 16.9 years of follow-up. Using baseline information alone or together with repeated measurements, serological levels of VCA/IgA and EA/IgA were significantly associated with increased risks for NPC, with a striking dose-response relationship and most prominent during the first 5 years of follow-up. Considering the fluctuant types of serological titers observed during the first three tests, relative risk was highest among participants with ascending titers of EBV VCA/IgA antibodies with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 21.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] 7.1 to 64.1), and lowest for those with decreasing titers (HR = 1.5, 95% CI 0.2 to 11.4), during the first 5 years of follow-up. Time-dependent ROC analysis showed that VCA/IgA had better predictive performance for NPC incidence than EA/IgA.Our study documents that elevated EBV antibodies, particularly with ascending titers, are strongly associated with an increased risk for NPC."
https://openalex.org/W2029044425,"Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/S6K1 signalling emerges as a critical regulator of aging. Yet, a role of mTOR/S6K1 in aging-associated vascular endothelial dysfunction remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of S6K1 in aging-associated endothelial dysfunction and effects of the polyphenol resveratrol on S6K1 in aging endothelial cells. We show here that senescent endothelial cells displayed higher S6K1 activity, increased superoxide production and decreased bioactive nitric oxide (NO) levels than young endothelial cells, which is contributed by eNOS uncoupling. Silencing S6K1 in senescent cells reduced superoxide generation and enhanced NO production. Conversely, over-expression of a constitutively active S6K1 mutant in young endothelial cells mimicked endothelial dysfunction of the senescent cells through eNOS uncoupling and induced premature cellular senescence. Like the mTOR/S6K1 inhibitor rapamycin, resveratrol inhibited S6K1 signalling, resulting in decreased superoxide generation and enhanced NO levels in the senescent cells. Consistent with the data from cultured cells, an enhanced S6K1 activity, increased superoxide generation, and decreased bioactive NO levels associated with eNOS uncoupling were also detected in aortas of old WKY rats (aged 20–24 months) as compared to the young animals (1–3 months). Treatment of aortas of old rats with resveratrol or rapamycin inhibited S6K1 activity, oxidative stress, and improved endothelial NO production. Our data demonstrate a causal role of the hyperactive S6K1 in eNOS uncoupling leading to endothelial dysfunction and vascular aging. Resveratrol improves endothelial function in aging, at least in part, through inhibition of S6K1. Targeting S6K1 may thus represent a novel therapeutic approach for aging-associated vascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W2061065748,"Many bats are threatened by habitat loss, but opportunities to manage their habitats are now increasing. Success of management depends greatly on the capacity to determine where and how interventions should take place, so models predicting how animals use landscapes are important to plan them. Bats are quite distinctive in the way they use space for foraging because (i) most are colonial central-place foragers and (ii) exploit scattered and distant resources, although this increases flying costs. To evaluate how important distances to resources are in modelling foraging bat habitat suitability, we radio-tracked two cave-dwelling species of conservation concern (Rhinolophus mehelyi and Miniopterus schreibersii) in a Mediterranean landscape. Habitat and distance variables were evaluated using logistic regression modelling. Distance variables greatly increased the performance of models, and distance to roost and to drinking water could alone explain 86 and 73% of the use of space by M. schreibersii and R. mehelyi, respectively. Land-cover and soil productivity also provided a significant contribution to the final models. Habitat suitability maps generated by models with and without distance variables differed substantially, confirming the shortcomings of maps generated without distance variables. Indeed, areas shown as highly suitable in maps generated without distance variables proved poorly suitable when distance variables were also considered. We concluded that distances to resources are determinant in the way bats forage across the landscape, and that using distance variables substantially improves the accuracy of suitability maps generated with spatially explicit models. Consequently, modelling with these variables is important to guide habitat management in bats and similarly mobile animals, particularly if they are central-place foragers or depend on spatially scarce resources."

We address some safety and efficacy concerns with this research, as well as the ethics of fair subject selection. We consider other populations that might be better for this research: chronic complete SCI patients for a safety trial, subacute incomplete SCI patients for an efficacy trial, and perhaps primary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) patients for a combined safety and efficacy trial. Geron recently announced that it had begun enrolling patients in the world's first-in-human clinical trial involving cells derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). This trial raises important questions regarding the future of hESC-based therapies, especially in spinal cord injury (SCI) patients. We address some safety and efficacy concerns with this research, as well as the ethics of fair subject selection. We consider other populations that might be better for this research: chronic complete SCI patients for a safety trial, subacute incomplete SCI patients for an efficacy trial, and perhaps primary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) patients for a combined safety and efficacy trial. In January 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Geron's first-in-human embryonic stem cell (hESC) clinical trial in patients with subacute American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale grade A thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI) (hereafter, complete SCI) (Geron, 2009aGeron (2009a). Geron receives FDA clearance to begin world's first human clinical trial of embryonic stem cell-based therapy (http://www.geron.com/media/pressview.aspx?id=1148).Google Scholar). Then, in August 2009, the FDA placed the trial on hold (before any patients had been enrolled) because of concerns about the risk of cyst formation at the injury site (Geron, 2009bGeron (2009b). Geron comments on FDA hold on spinal cord injury trial (http://www.geron.com/media/pressview.aspx?id=1188).Google Scholar). In July 2010 the clinical hold was lifted, and in October 2010 Geron announced that it had begun to enroll patients in its Phase 1 clinical trial (Geron, 2010aGeron (2010a). Geron to proceed with first human clinical trial of embryonic stem cell-based therapy (http://www.geron.com/media/pressview.aspx?id=1229).Google Scholar). Typically, a Phase 1 clinical trial aims “to assess the safety and feasibility of the investigational intervention and to determine dosages for subsequent clinical trials. Direct therapeutic benefit, although hoped for, is unlikely in early trials, particularly if the first participants receive low doses” (Lo et al., 2005Lo B. Zettler P. Cedars M.I. Gates E. Kriegstein A.R. Oberman M. Reijo Pera R. Wagner R.M. Wuerth M.T. Wolf L.E. Yamamoto K.R. A new era in the ethics of human embryonic stem cell research.Stem Cells. 2005; 23: 1454-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Geron's Phase 1 clinical trial of hESC-derived oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (GRNOPC1) involves one injection of 2 million GRNOPC1 cells into patients within 7–14 days postinjury. The primary endpoint for the trial is safety (“as measured by the frequency and severity of adverse events within 1 year of GRNOPC1 injection that are related to GRNOPC1, the injection procedure used to administer GRNOPC1, and/or the concomitant immunosuppression administered”); however, Geron identifies efficacy as a secondary endpoint (“as measured by sensory scores and lower extremity motor scores on International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury [ISNCSCI] examinations”) (Geron, 2010cGeron (2010c). Phase 1 Safety Study of GRNOPC1 in Patients with Neurologically Complete, Subacute, Spinal Cord Injury (http://clinicaltrials.gov/archive/NCT01217008/2010_10_07).Google Scholar). This secondary endpoint is noteworthy insofar as it likely explains the choice of subacute complete SCI patients as the target population. Fair subject selection is a requirement for ethical clinical research (World Medical Association (WMA), 2008World Medical Association (WMA) (2008). WMA Declaration of Helsinki - Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects (http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/b3/index.html).Google Scholar, Emanuel et al., 2000Emanuel E.J.

Ethics and Regulations of Clinical Research.Second Edition. Yale University Press, New Haven, Connecticut1988Google Scholar). In this article we critically examine this aspect of trial design and suggest that while there are sound reasons to have chosen subacute complete SCI patients as the target population, there are both scientific and ethical reasons why a different patient population—chronic complete SCI patients, subacute incomplete SCI patients, or patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) with spinal lesions—might have been a more appropriate target. Following injury, the spinal cord undergoes a cascade of changes within hours, days, months, and years. The resulting axonal disruption stops the bidirectional flow of information between the brain and spinal neuronal networks beyond the lesion site. In addition, animal models of SCI have shown that at the level of the lesion, spared axons undergo extensive but transient demyelination, and injured neurons undergo degenerative processes that can lead to cell death. In the last two decades, the scientific community has shown in animal models that glial cell transplants can exhibit neuroprotective effects on the spinal cord after injury. These transplants may spare axons and neurons that could have been harmed by SCI by reducing the lesion size and the inflammatory reaction, by delivering trophic support, and/or by remyelinating axons in the vicinity of the injury (for review, see Tetzlaff et al., 2010Tetzlaff W.

More recently, Keirstead and colleagues have demonstrated that hESC-derived GRNOPC1—a type of glial cell—remyelinates spared axons in addition to promoting functional recovery of forelimb-hindlimb coordination in a rat model of subacute incomplete thoracic SCI (Cloutier et al., 2006Cloutier F. Siegenthaler M.M. Nistor G. Keirstead H.S. Transplantation of human embryonic stem cell-derived oligodendrocyte progenitors into rat spinal cord injuries does not cause harm.Regen.

Despite some concerns from the scientific community regarding the absence of replication of the preclinical evidence in independent laboratories and in large animal models of SCI (e.g. cat, dog, rabbit, or primate) whose anatomy is closer to that of human (Courtine et al., 2007Courtine G. Bunge M.B. Fawcett J.W. Grossman R.G. Kaas J.H. Lemon R. Maier I. Martin J. Nudo R.J.

Translational research in spinal cord injury: a survey of opinion from the SCI community.J. Neurotrauma. 2010; 27: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), Geron has moved forward to the first-in-human hESC clinical trial. In a recent survey, the majority of scientists called for independent replication as well as large animal models to demonstrate safety and efficacy of a cell transplant therapy prior to clinical translation (Kwon et al., 2010Kwon B.K. Hillyer J. Tetzlaff W. Translational research in spinal cord injury: a survey of opinion from the SCI community.J. Neurotrauma. 2010; 27: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). With the first hESC clinical trial, Geron aims to assess the safety of hESC-derived GRNOPC1 as well as the potential of these cells to myelinate axons of the central nervous system and promote behavioral recovery in patients with subacute complete thoracic SCI. The clinical trial is designed to replicate part of the original study in rodents in targeting a SCI patient population at a similar level (thoracic) and within a similar time frame (1–2 weeks postinjury, which is referred to as a subacute period). According to Geron, “Patients eligible for the Phase 1 trial must have documented evidence of functionally complete SCI with a neurological level of T3 to T10 spinal segments and agree to have GRNOPC1 injected into the lesion sites between seven and 14 days after injury” (Geron, 2010aGeron (2010a). Geron to proceed with first human clinical trial of embryonic stem cell-based therapy (http://www.geron.com/media/pressview.aspx?id=1229).Google Scholar). However, one critical difference between the animal studies and the human trials is the injury type. In the animal studies, the cells were tested in rodents with incomplete SCI; in the clinical trials, the cells will be tested in humans with complete SCI. Patients with complete SCI with a neurological level of T3 to T10 spinal segments exhibit a total lack of sensory, motor, and autonomic (including bladder and bowel) functions below their trunk and in their legs. In patients with incomplete SCI, some neurologic function remains. In the long term, patients with SCI are susceptible to developing medical complications such as pressure sores, chronic pain, and respiratory, cardiovascular, and bone problems. Successful recovery depends upon how well these chronic conditions are ameliorated. A significant problem with the chosen target population, patients with subacute complete SCI, is that the transplanted hESC-derived GRNOPC1 (along with systemic immunosuppression) might impair spontaneous recovery in a subset of trial participants. Six to ten percent of patients initially assessed as complete SCI show spontaneous functional improvement over time, suggesting the initial lesion was incomplete (Burns et al., 2003Burns A.S. Lee B.S. Ditunno Jr., J.F. Tessler A. Patient selection for clinical trials: the reliability of the early spinal cord injury examination.J. Neurotrauma. 2003; 20: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, Consortium for Spinal Cord Medicine, 2000Consortium for Spinal Cord MedicineOutcomes following traumatic spinal cord injury: clinical practice guidelines for health-care professionals.J.

Neurological prognosis after traumatic quadriplegia. Three-year experience of California Regional Spinal Cord Injury Care System.J. Neurosurg. 1979; 50: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Spontaneous recovery in this population (i.e., patients with incomplete SCI initially diagnosed as complete SCI) might be jeopardized by participation in the GRNOPC1 trial. These patients would undergo a second surgery to transplant the cells within 1–2 weeks after the initial SCI, following a first operation to decompress the spinal cord and/or stabilize the spine. In addition to the research risks of cell transplantation and immunosuppression, this second surgery would expose patients to additional neurosurgical risks, including extending the lesion while transplanting the cells or introducing infection. In this way, trial participation would disadvantage (some) patients relative to the standard of competent care otherwise available to them outside the trial (Anderson and Kimmelman, 2010Anderson J.A. Kimmelman J. Extending clinical equipoise to phase 1 trials involving patients: unresolved problems.Kennedy Inst. Ethics J. 2010; 20: 75-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Further, it is important to understand that patients with subacute complete SCI are a vulnerable population. Seven to 14 days postinjury, which is the recruitment period for the Geron trial, is a time during which the patients who will have suffered an acute traumatic event will be experiencing stress, anxiety, fear, and depression in degrees proportionate to the severity of injury (Dryden et al., 2005Dryden D.M. Saunders L.D. Rowe B.H. May L.A. Yiannakoulias N. Svenson L.W. Schopflocher D.P. Voaklander D.C.

These patients will have had little time to reflect on their changed life circumstances and to fully understand and appreciate the risks of participating in a first-in-human hESC clinical trial. Moreover, these patients may be desperate for any opportunity to reverse their misfortune and as such may be eager to agree to participate in research without fully understanding and appreciating the consequences of their decision. The Declaration of Helsinki states:Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote respect for all human subjects and protect their health and rights. Some research populations are particularly vulnerable and need special protection. These include those who cannot give or refuse consent for themselves and those who may be vulnerable to coercion or undue influence (World Medical Association (WMA), 2008World Medical Association (WMA) (2008). WMA Declaration of Helsinki - Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects (http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/b3/index.html).Google Scholar). This is not a directive to exclude vulnerable populations from research, but rather a call to pay particular attention to the risk of coercion or undue influence. With this risk there is the worry that one of the elements of free and informed choice, namely voluntariness, will be compromised. In addition to the risk of coercion or undue influence, there is also the risk of exploitation (Ruof, 2004Ruof M.C. Vulnerability, vulnerable populations, and policy.Kennedy Inst. Ethics J. 2004; 14: 411-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). With this risk, the concern is with the degree to which people might be used to serve the interests of others. With the Geron hESC-derived GRNOPC1 trial, we do not imagine that patients with subacute complete SCI will be coerced into research participation. We do imagine, however, that recently diagnosed complete SCI patients—as compared with chronic complete SCI patients or patients with primary progressive MS with spinal lesions—may be more vulnerable to undue influence and possibly exploitation (where exploitation involves taking unfair advantage of another). For example, as Miller and Rosenstein remark, “Insofar as patient-subjects confuse research with therapy, they do not accurately comprehend what they are doing and thus may be vulnerable to exploitation” (Miller and Rosenstein, 2003Miller F.G. Rosenstein D.L. The therapeutic orientation to clinical trials.N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 1383-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Subacute complete SCI patients are at increased risk of conflating participating in a clinical trial with accessing novel medical treatment(s), a phenomenon known as the therapeutic misconception (Gilbert, 2009Gilbert, F. (2009). Geron's hESC trial for spinal cord injury: the risk of therapeutic misconception. Bioethics Forum (http://www.thehastingscenter.org/Bioethicsforum/Post.aspx?id=3370).Google Scholar, Miller and Rosenstein, 2003Miller F.G. Rosenstein D.L. The therapeutic orientation to clinical trials.N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 1383-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). To be more precise, these patients, who suddenly and unexpectedly find themselves in dire circumstances, may fail to appreciate the disadvantages associated with trial participation, where protocol design (not the needs or interests of patients) determines what interventions patients (once they are trial participants) will receive (Appelbaum et al., 1987Appelbaum P.S. Roth L.H. Lidz C.W. Benson P. Winslade W. False hopes and best data: consent to research and the therapeutic misconception.Hastings Cent. Rep. 1987; 17: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, Kimmelman, 2007Kimmelman J. The therapeutic misconception at 25: treatment, research, and confusion.Hastings Cent. Rep. 2007; 37: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In general, first-in-human clinical trials aim to produce socially valuable medical knowledge; they do not serve therapeutic functions (Anderson and Kimmelman, 2010Anderson J.A. Kimmelman J. Extending clinical equipoise to phase 1 trials involving patients: unresolved problems.Kennedy Inst. Ethics J. 2010; 20: 75-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). And in particular, Geron's first-in-human Phase 1 hESC-derived GRNOPC1 clinical trial is about contributing to generalizable knowledge, not about delivering cutting-edge stem cell therapy. It is doubtful, however, that subacute complete SCI patients would understand the invitation to enroll in Geron's trial in these terms, unless the consent process unambiguously explained that clinical benefits were highly unlikely, and that “the value of the knowledge sought, rather than the product's therapeutic activity” (Kimmelman and London, 2011Kimmelman J. London A.J. Predicting harms and benefits in translational trials: ethics, evidence, and uncertainty.PLoS Med. 2011; 8: e1001010Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) justified the move from preclinical to clinical research. Indeed, the risk of therapeutic misconception (i.e., conflating care and research) is likely to be high among patients recently diagnosed with complete SCI who, in the immediate posttraumatic period, likely will expect nothing less of their clinicians than medical advice aimed at promoting their recovery (as contrasted with advice aimed at producing medical knowledge to benefit society). It is our contention that, in general, patients with subacute complete SCI are unlikely to fully understand and appreciate that trial participation means the needs and interests of science, not their personal needs and interests, will determine the “care” they receive. In addition to the therapeutic misconception, there is the misestimation of harms and benefits. To be clear, even if subacute complete SCI patients understand (and appreciate) the difference between research and therapy, in the immediate postinjury period they very likely will underestimate the potential harms and overestimate the potential benefits of research participation, resulting in a mistaken understanding of the harm-benefit ratio. As Christopher Thomas Scott astutely noted,Newly disabled persons (and the surrogates and families who care for them) may overestimate the long-term emotional impact of a recent injury. As a result, participants might be more likely to agree to a trial now than they would after time passes and their expectations change. For those living with a debilitating or deadly disease, a person's hope for an incremental benefit from a safety trial—however remote—might outweigh any considerations of risk. Restoration of bowel function for a patient with a spinal injury represents a significant improvement in quality of life. On the other hand, an inoperable tumor caused by the transplant may mean a lifetime of peripheral pain (Scott, 2008Scott C.T. Stem cells: new frontiers of ethics, law, and policy.Neurosurg. Focus. 2008; 24: E24Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Here, it is important to stress that the potential harms associated with the Geron trial are not insignificant. In addition to the surgical risks of extending the lesion while transplanting the cells and of infection, there are the risks of (1) preventing endogenous remyelination, (2) promoting teratoma formation, (3) affecting inflammation, and (4) promoting aberrant neural reorganization. First, hESC-derived GRNOPC1 transplantation could be hazardous in humans because GRNOPC1 transplants may be in direct competition with endogenous progenitor-derived glial cells. The expected benefit of GRNOPC1 resides in their potential to remyelinate axons after SCI (Cloutier et al., 2006Cloutier F. Siegenthaler M.M. Nistor G. Keirstead H.S. Transplantation of human embryonic stem cell-derived oligodendrocyte progenitors into rat spinal cord injuries does not cause harm.Regen. Med. 2006; 1: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, Keirstead et al., 2005Keirstead H.S. Nistor G. Bernal G. Totoiu M. Cloutier F. Sharp K. Steward O. Human embryonic stem cell-derived oligodendrocyte progenitor cell transplants remyelinate and restore locomotion after spinal cord injury.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4694-4705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). Although the injured spinal cord undergoes demyelination of spared axons shortly following SCI, recent studies of mouse and primate SCI have reported that axons are eventually remyelinated by cells derived from endogenous progenitors (Lasiene et al., 2008Lasiene J. Shupe L. Perlmutter S. Horner P. No evidence for chronic demyelination in spared axons after spinal cord injury in a mouse.J.

This suggests there is no chronic demyelination after SCI. In humans, the role of persistent demyelination in neurologic dysfunction following SCI is not clear: no progressive chronic demyelination has been reported to date, and persistent demyelination was reported in only a fraction of patients (Guest et al., 2005Guest J.D. Hiester E.D. Bunge R.P. Demyelination and Schwann cell responses adjacent to injury epicenter cavities following chronic human spinal cord injury.Exp.

Marcillo A. The pathology of human spinal cord injury: defining the problems.J. Neurotrauma. 2004; 21: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Second, there is a risk of teratoma formation generated by undifferentiated hESCs. While differentiated stem cells (GRNOPC1) do not seem to degenerate or migrate away from the injection site in the rat (Cloutier et al., 2006Cloutier F. Siegenthaler M.M. Nistor G. Keirstead H.S.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4694-4705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar), undifferentiated stem cells can be harmful in nonhuman animals (Hofstetter et al., 2005Hofstetter C.P. Holmström N.A.

Some incidences of tumors have been reported after transplantations of predifferentiated hESCs in the brain (Brederlau et al., 2006Brederlau A. Correia A.S. Anisimov S.V. Elmi M. Paul G. Roybon L.

Med. 2006; 12: 1259-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). These undifferentiated hESCs could originate from cells incompletely differentiated before transplantation as well as from transplanted cells that could dedifferentiate in the injured spinal cord. A few undifferentiated stem cells might be sufficient to generate tumors at the lesion site or at distant healthy regions of the central nervous system. The cells could also be quiescent for months or years before developing teratomata or teratocarcinomas (Knoepfler, 2009Knoepfler P.S. Deconstructing stem cell tumorigenicity: a roadmap to safe regenerative medicine.Stem Cells. 2009; 27: 1050-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). However, it is reassuring to note that Geron extensively investigated the number of residual undifferentiated stem cells required for teratoma formation in an immunocompromised rodent (dose response) and that no teratomata were reported by Geron 12 months after GRNOPC1 transplants in the animal model (Geron, 2010bGeron (2010b). Preclinical Safety studies (http://www.geron.com/GRNOPC1Trial/grnopc1-sec3.html).Google Scholar). Third, GRNOPC1 transplants could affect the inflammation that occurs following SCI. In animal models of SCI (Hausmann, 2003Hausmann O.N. Post-traumatic inflammation following spinal cord injury.Spinal Cord. 2003; 41: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, Popovich et al., 1997Popovich P.G. Wei P. Stokes B.T.

We previously showed that trophoblast stem (TS) cells lacking the protein kinase MAP3K4 maintain properties of both stemness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Here, we show that MAP3K4 controls the activity of the histone acetyltransferase CBP, and that acetylation of histones H2A and H2B by CBP is required to maintain the epithelial phenotype. Combined loss of MAP3K4/CBP activity represses expression of epithelial genes and causes TS cells to undergo EMT while maintaining their self-renewal and multipotency properties. The expression profile of MAP3K4-deficient TS cells defines an H2B acetylation-regulated gene signature that closely overlaps with that of human breast cancer cells. Taken together, our data define an epigenetic switch that maintains the epithelial phenotype in TS cells and reveals previously unrecognized genes potentially contributing to breast cancer.

TS cells lacking MAP3K4 activity (TSKI4) exhibit properties of stemness and EMT Loss of H2A/H2B acetylation by CBP induces EMT, but does not affect stemness TS cells maintain epithelial identity and stem cell renewal by independent mechanisms TSKI4 cells and human breast tumors share an intersecting EMT gene signature The transition of epithelial cells to motile mesenchymal cells occurs through a process known as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), in which epithelial cells lose cell-cell contacts and apical-basal polarity concomitantly with the acquisition of a mesenchymal morphology and invasive properties. Several molecular events are coordinated for the initiation and completion of EMT, including loss of the adhesive cell-surface protein E-cadherin, activation of EMT-inducing transcription factors, and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (Yang and Weinberg, 2008Yang J. Weinberg R.A. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition: at the crossroads of development and tumor metastasis.Dev. Cell. 2008; 14: 818-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2270) Google Scholar). During development, EMT is responsible for proper formation of the body plan and for differentiation of many tissues and organs. Examples of EMT in mammalian development include implantation, gastrulation, and neural crest formation (Thiery et al., 2009Thiery J.P. Acloque H. Huang R.Y.J. Nieto M.A. Epithelial-mesenchymal transitions in development and disease.Cell. 2009; 139: 871-890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6817) Google Scholar). Initiation of placenta formation regulated by trophoectoderm differentiation is the first, and yet most poorly defined, developmental EMT. The commitment of stem cells to specialized cell types requires extensive reprogramming of gene expression, involving, in part, epigenetic control of transcription. The first cell-fate decision is the formation of the trophoectoderm and the inner cell mass of the blastocyst. Trophoblast stem (TS) cells within the trophoectoderm maintain a self-renewing state in the presence of FGF4 (Tanaka et al., 1998Tanaka S. Kunath T. Hadjantonakis A. Nagy A. Rossant J. Promotion of Trophoblast Stem Cell Proliferation by FGF4.Science. 1998; 282: 2072-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). For TS cells and most other tissue stem cells, self-renewal is defined as cell division with the maintenance of multipotency (He et al., 2009He S. Nakada D. Morrison S.J. Mechanisms of stem cell self-renewal.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2009; 25: 377-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Diminished exposure to FGF4 induces TS cells to give rise to multiple differentiated trophoblast lineages, each required for establishment of the placenta. For implantation to occur, TS cells must undergo morphological changes to a more invasive phenotype, thereby exhibiting the functional hallmarks of EMT. An emerging topic in the EMT field is the intersection between EMT and stemness. We have previously characterized the developmental defects of a genetically engineered mouse with the targeted inactivation of MAP3K4, a serine-threonine kinase important for JNK and p38 activation in response to FGF4 (Abell et al., 2009Abell A.N. Granger D.A. Johnson N.L. Vincent-Jordan N. Dibble C.F. Johnson G.L. Trophoblast Stem Cell Maintenance by Fibroblast Growth Factor 4 Requires MEKK4 Activation of Jun N-Terminal Kinase.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 2748-2761Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition to embryonic defects, the MAP3K4 kinase-inactive mouse (KI4) has trophoblast defects resulting in hyperinvasion, defective decidualization, fetal growth restriction, and implantation defects (Abell et al., 2005Abell A.N. Rivera-Perez J.A. Cuevas B.D. Uhlik M.T. Sather S. Johnson N.L. Minton S.K. Lauder J.M. Winter-Vann A.M.

TS cells isolated from the conceptuses of KI4 mice (TSKI4 cells) exhibit the hallmarks of EMT, while maintaining TS cell multipotency, and are a unique developmental stem cell model from which to examine parallels between EMT and stemness. Recently, EMT has been linked to the metastatic progression of cancer and to the acquisition of stem cell properties (Mani et al., 2008Mani S.A. Guo W. Liao M.-J. Eaton E.N. Ayyanan A. Zhou A.Y. Brooks M. Reinhard F. Zhang C.C.

The claudin-low (CL) intrinsic subtype of breast cancer is characterized by its mesenchymal and stem cell-like properties. In concordance with the stem cell-like CD44+/CD24−/lo and CD49f+/EpCAM− antigenic phenotypes of breast tumor-initiating cells (TICs) and mammary stem cells, gene-expression profiling demonstrated that CL tumors have reduced expression of several epithelial differentiation markers, while exhibiting increased expression of certain stemness and mesenchymal markers (Lim et al., 2009Lim E. Vaillant F. Wu D. Forrest N.C. Pal B. Hart A.H. Asselin-Labat M.-L. Gyorki D.E. Ward T.

Herein, we define an epigenetic mechanism important for the initiation of the first EMT event during development. Using TSKI4 cells uniquely trapped in EMT prior to initiation of the trophoblast differentiation program, we capture the genetic and epigenetic profile of the intersection between the properties of EMT and stemness. Importantly, we identify a molecular mechanism reliant on the histone acetyltransferase CBP that is responsible for controlling epigenetic remodeling during EMT in TSKI4 cells. TS cells lacking CBP (TSshCBP) expression exhibit an EMT similar to TSKI4 cells, which is mediated by the selective loss of H2A and H2B acetylation. Comparison across developmental and cancer EMT models exhibiting stem-like properties demonstrated a highly significant intersection between the gene expression profiles of TSKI4 cells and CL human tumors and cell lines. Repressed genes from the EMT gene signature demonstrated loss of H2BK5Ac in TSKI4, TSshCBP, and CL cells. These results highlight the importance of MAP3K4/CBP-mediated acetylation of H2BK5 for maintenance of the TS cell epithelial phenotype. In the presence of FGF4, TS cells maintain self-renewal as defined by the maintenance of cell division with multipotency (Niwa et al., 2005Niwa H. Toyooka Y. Shimosato D. Strumpf D. Takahashi K. Yagi R. Rossant J. Interaction between Oct3/4 and Cdx2 determines trophectoderm differentiation.Cell. 2005; 123: 917-929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar, Tanaka et al., 1998Tanaka S. Kunath T. Hadjantonakis A. Nagy A. Rossant J. Promotion of Trophoblast Stem Cell Proliferation by FGF4.Science. 1998; 282: 2072-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). TSKI4 cells lack MAP3K4 activity but are self-renewing and multipotent. When cultured in the presence of FGF4, TSKI4 cells expressed the TS cell markers Cdx2, Eomes, Esrrβ, and FGFR2 at levels similar to TSWT cells (Figures 1A–1D ). Removal of FGF4 promoted the differentiation of TSKI4 cells into all trophoblast lineages similar to TSWT cells with the loss of expression of stem cell markers (Figures 1A–1D) and the gain of expression of trophoblast lineage markers, including the giant cell marker PLI, the spongiotrophoblast marker Tpbpα, and the syncytiotrophoblast marker Gcm1 (Figures 1E–1G). Developmental potency of these stem cells was established through the injection of GFP-labeled TSWT or TSKI4 cells into wild-type blastocysts. Both TSWT and TSKI4 cells produced chimeric conceptuses with similar frequencies (Figure 1H) and contributed selectively to the trophoblast lineages, including the extraembryonic ectoderm, ectoplacental cone, and giant cells (Figures 1I–1N and see Figures S1A–S1H available online). These cells were not found in the embryo or in any ICM-derived extraembryonic tissue (Figures 1I–1N). TSKI4 cells also exhibit the molecular and cellular characteristics of EMT. TSWT cells grew with an epithelial morphology (Figure 1O), strong peripheral E-cadherin (Figure 1P), and cortical actin expression at cell-cell contacts (Figures 1Q and 1R). In contrast, TSKI4 cells exhibited a polarized front-back end, mesenchymal morphology (Figure 1S). E-cadherin was significantly reduced in TSKI4 cells (Figure 1T). Also, filamentous actin was observed at the leading edge of TSKI4 cells (Figures 1U and 1V). Reduction of total E-cadherin in TSKI4 cells relative to TSWT cells was further validated by western blotting (Figure 1W). Real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) showed a modest increase in the expression of the mesenchymal markers vimentin and N-cadherin in TSKI4 cells, and western blotting revealed a 2.9- and 2.2-fold increase in vimentin and N-cadherin protein expression respectively (Figures S1I and S1J). Differentiation of both TSWT and TSKI4 cells also increased vimentin and N-cadherin protein expression (Figure S1J). TSKI4 cells and 4 day differentiated TSWT cells exhibited a 14- to 16-fold increase in invasiveness compared to TSWT cells (Figure 1X). Hyperinvasiveness of the TSKI4 cells was also seen in vivo. Defective decidualization is induced by excessive trophoblast invasion (Norwitz et al., 2001Norwitz E.R. Schust D.J. Fisher S.J. Implantation and the survival of early pregnancy.N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 345: 1400-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). Compared to injection of TSWT cells (Figure 1Y), injection of TSKI4 cells into wild-type blastocysts resulted in defective decidualization consistent with the hyperinvasiveness of TSKI4 cells (Figures 1Z–1BB). Cumulatively, these data demonstrate that TSKI4 cells are self-renewing stem cells with properties of EMT, including loss of E-cadherin and gain of invasiveness. Removal of FGF4 promotes the differentiation of TS cells and increased invasiveness of trophoblasts through Matrigel-coated transwells (Figure 2A ). The invasive population was largest at 4 days post FGF4 withdrawal (TINV) (Figure 2A). Morphologically, TSWT cells cultured in FGF4 grew in tight epithelial sheets with actin localized around the cell periphery (Figures 2B and 2C). In contrast, TINV cells isolated from the bottom of Matrigel-coated transwells exhibited mesenchymal cell characteristics with prominent actin stress fibers and filamentous actin localized to the front end of polarized cells (Figures 2D and 2E) and loss of E-cadherin (Figures 2F and 2G). E-cadherin was more significantly reduced in TINV cells compared to 4 day differentiated trophoblasts (TDIFF) not selected for invasiveness (Figures 2F and 2G). Expression of the mesenchymal marker fibronectin was significantly increased and vimentin was also expressed in TINV cells (Figure S2A). These changes in invasiveness, morphology, and E-cadherin expression indicated that the TINV cells have undergone EMT. To induce EMT in TS cells, we ectopically expressed a defined inducer of EMT, the transcription factor Snail, in TSWT cells (TSSnail) (Cano et al., 2000Cano A. Pérez-Moreno M.A. Rodrigo I. Locascio A. Blanco M.J. del Barrio M.G. Portillo F. Nieto M.A. The transcription factor snail controls epithelial-mesenchymal transitions by repressing E-cadherin expression.Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (2718) Google Scholar). TSSnail cells exhibited a polarized, mesenchymal morphology with increased filamentous actin and mesenchymal markers vimentin and N-cadherin (Figures 2H–2J and Figure S2B). A 10-fold increase in invasiveness compared to TSWT cells and loss of E-cadherin showed Snail overexpression-induced TS cell EMT (Figures 2K and 2L). TSSnail cells expressed TS stem cell markers and were able to differentiate into trophoblast lineages upon removal of FGF4 (Figures S2C and S2D). To identify transcription factors responsible for inducing EMT in TS cells, we compared the expression levels of eight transcription factors known to regulate EMT in other systems. FGF4 withdrawal from TSWT cells induced Snail message at 4 days of differentiation and in TINV cells, suggesting that Snail is important for TS cell EMT (Figure 2M and Figure S2E). The EMT-inducing transcription factors Slug and Twist were elevated in undifferentiated TSKI4 cells, but were not induced with differentiation or invasion of TSWT cells (Figures 2N and 2O and Figure S2E). Upregulation of Lef1 and Ets1 were also detected in TSKI4 and TSSnail cells (Figures 2P and 2Q). Similar to Snail, Lef1 was induced at 4 days of TSWT cell differentiation and in TINV cells (Figure 2P and Figure S2E). Other known transcriptional regulators of EMT, such as Zeb1, Foxc2, and Gsc, were not induced with EMT of TINV or TSKI4 cells (Figures S2F–S2H). To identify genes related to the acquisition of invasiveness in trophoblast EMT, we measured gene expression changes in TINV cells compared to TSWT cells using genome-wide Agilent microarrays. With a Benjamini-Hochberg p value < 0.05, 6641 genes exhibited a minimum 2-fold change in expression in TINV cells (Table S1). Since TINV cells were differentiated for 4 days, a component of the 6641 changed genes reflected differentiation-specific changes unrelated to the acquisition of invasiveness. When gene expression changes of TDIFF cells compared to TSWT cells were measured, 5706 genes exhibited altered expression by a minimum of 2-fold (Table S1). Direct comparison of gene expression changes in TINV and TDIFF cells revealed that 2359 genes had significantly different expressions measured as a minimum 1.5-fold change with 80% of these genes being changed only in TINV cells (Table S2). Gene ontology (GO) analysis of the 2359 genes showed significant enrichment in canonical KEGG pathways regulating focal adhesions, actin cytoskeleton, and adherens junctions (Figure S3A). These findings define an invasive gene signature for trophoblast EMT. Unlike TINV cells that have undergone EMT, but have lost stemness, TSKI4 cells are self-renewing stem cells in EMT. TSKI4 cells serve as a useful model to distinguish between genes that mediate invasiveness and EMT. Gene expression profiling defined changes in TSKI4 cells compared to TSWT cells, identifying 1083 significantly upregulated genes and 702 significantly downregulated genes by more than 2-fold (Benjamini-Hochberg p value < 0.05) (Table S1). GO analysis of downregulated genes showed a significant enrichment in nine canonical signaling pathways (Figure S3B). The top three enriched signaling pathways included focal adhesions, ECM-interactions, and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton—the same pathways that were identified in the TINV signature. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of TSKI4, TINV, and TDIFF cells showed a common gene set for TINV and TDIFF cells indicated by a node correlation coefficient of 0.82 (Figure 3A ). This strong correlation reflects the significant changes in gene expression due to FGF4 removal and loss of stemness in TINV and TDIFF cells, as compared to TSKI4 cells, showing that TSKI4 cells are not differentiated cells. Venn diagrams of upregulated (Figure 3B) and downregulated (Figure 3C) genes highlight the significant intersection between TDIFF and TINV cells, while demonstrating the limited intersection of 416 genes between TSKI4 and TINV cells. Significantly changed genes were categorized according to biological function, and 25% of these genes regulate cell adhesion and motility, including Lamb2, Fn1, and RhoB (Figure 3D and Figure S3C). In addition, genes were identified whose importance to invasion and EMT has not been previously defined, including the enrichment for genes regulating RNA splicing, transcription, translation, and protein degradation (Figure S3C). However, these genes must be functionally tested to prove their role in invasion and EMT. Using qRT-PCR, we validated the expression changes of several genes showing similar changes in TSKI4 and TINV cells (Figures S3D and S3E). Induction of differentiation by FGF4 removal from TSWT cells was accompanied by reduced acetylation of all core histones, specifically at H2AK5, H2BK5/K12/K15/K20, H3K9, and H4K8 (Figure 4A ). Trimethylation of H3K4 and H3K9 was unchanged with differentiation (data not shown). The differentiation-induced loss of histone acetylation suggests the importance of histone acetylation in maintaining the undifferentiated epithelial state of TS cells. We therefore examined histone modifications in TSKI4 cells. Figure 4B shows the loss of acetylation at H2AK5, H2BK5, H2BK12, and H2BK15 in TSKI4 cells compared to TSWT cells. H3K9Ac and H4K8Ac were unaffected, demonstrating that loss of histone acetylation was selective for H2A and H2B. Examination of histone methylation showed that trimethylation of H3K4 and H3K9 was not altered, suggesting that loss of H2A and H2B acetylation (H2A/H2BAc) in TSKI4 cells occurs independently of changes in histone methylation (Figure 4C). Examination of TSSnail cells that exhibit properties of stemness and EMT similar to TSKI4 cells revealed the selective loss of H2A/H2BAc with no change in H3 and H4 acetylation (Figure 4D). These data show the association of loss of H2A/H2BAc with changes characteristic of EMT, while maintaining stemness in TSKI4 cells. We used ChIP-seq to identify genes associated with the epigenetic mark H2BK5Ac during TS cell reprogramming important for the induction of EMT. After obtaining DNA samples by ChIP using a highly specific H2BK5Ac antibody (Figures S4A and S4B), we generated a total of 44 and 27 million Illumina sequence reads for TSWT and TSKI4 cells respectively, consistent with western blotting data (Figure 4). This genome-wide analysis of the read-tag distribution demonstrated that H2BK5Ac is significantly enriched near the transcription start sites (TSS) of 13,625 genes in TS cells (Table S3 and Figure 5A ). This H2BK5Ac peak location profile near the TSS is consistent with published studies in CD4+ T cells (Wang et al., 2008Wang Z. Zang C. Rosenfeld J.A. Schones D.E. Barski A. Cuddapah S. Cui K. Roh T.-Y. Peng W. Zhang M.Q. Zhao K. Combinatorial patterns of histone acetylations and methylations in the human genome.Nat. Genet. 2008; 40: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar). Limiting the analysis to the well-annotated RefSeq gene set (NCBI37/mm9), we compared the read tag density between TSWT and TSKI4 cells within 1 kb upstream and downstream of the TSS. We normalized read-tag counts based upon the ratio of genome-wide total mapped reads between TSWT and TSKI4 cells. We removed background regions by filtering genes whose read tag counts did not significantly exceed cell-type-specific background noise (<20 read tags per 2 kb region). After removing duplicate genes, 4163 genes were significantly different in H2BK5Ac between TSWT and TSKI4 cells, as determined by the exact rate ratio test with Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p value ≤ 0.05. From the 4163 genes with a significant change in H2BK5Ac, 3515 genes had a significant loss of H2BK5Ac, while 648 genes had a significant gain of H2BK5Ac in TSKI4 compared to TSWT cells (Figures 5B and 5C). Changes in H2BK5Ac were visualized by normalized read tag density plots. We demonstrated the dramatic loss of H2BK5Ac in TSKI4 cells for a select set of genes including Acsl6, Dbndd2, Itgav, Krt19, and Trim54 (Figure 5D and Figure S4C). These are examples of genes with a highly significant loss of H2BK5Ac (i.e., Benjamini-Hochberg p values < 10−18), and they occur in the top 3% of affected genes (Table S3). Loss of H2BK5Ac in TSKI4 compared to TSWT cells was confirmed by ChIP-qRT-PCR (Figure 5E) and correlated with the loss of gene expression (Table S2 and Figure S3E). Furthermore, Acsl6, Itgav, Lamb2, and Trim54 demonstrated a similar loss of H2BK5Ac in TINV cells by ChIP-qRT-PCR, suggesting the importance of these genes in regulating the EMT program that occurs during trophoblast differentiation (Figure 5E). Although the majority of genes had a loss of H2BK5Ac in TSKI4 compared to TSWT cells, 648 genes had an increase in H2BK5Ac density in TSKI4 cells. Normalized density plots of Dkk3 and Mycn highlight two genes with a significant increase in H2BK5Ac (i.e., Benjamini-Hochberg p values < 10−12) and a coordinate increase in gene expression in TSKI4 cells (Figure 5F; Table S1 and Table S3). Consistent with the maintenance of TS cell multipotency, enrichment of H2BK5Ac occurs at the promoters of the TS cell markers Cdx2, Eomes, and Fgfr2 (Figure 5G). As indicated from normalized promoter density plots, Eomes and Esrrβ demonstrated unchanged levels of H2BK5Ac between TSWT and TSKI4 cells, while Cdx2 and Fgfr2 demonstrated a 50% decrease in H2BK5Ac density (Figure 5G). H2BK5Ac levels were validated by H2BK5Ac ChIP-qRT-PCR for the Eomes and Cdx2 promoters (Figure S4D). Using mRNA-seq to quantitatively compare the changes in H2BK5Ac with the changes in gene expression for TSWT and TSKI4 cells, there was a modest positive correlation between changes in gene expression and H2BK5Ac, as determined by a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.62 (p value < 10−16) (Figure 5H). This finding was further supported by GO analysis of genes both significantly downregulated and hypoacetylated, showing shared gene changes important for maintenance of focal adhesions, the actin cytoskeleton, and extracellular matrix interactions (Figure S3B and Figure S4E). Collectively, these results highlight the importance of H2BK5Ac in regulating the active gene transcription program of TS cells, whereby loss of H2BK5Ac results in repression of genes critical to maintenance of the epithelial phenotype. Recent studies have shown that the CL subtype of triple-negative breast cancer exhibits both mesenchymal and stem-like properties (Prat et al., 2010Prat A. Parker J.S. Karginova O. Fan C. Livasy C. Herschkowitz J.I. He X. Perou C.M. Phenotypic and molecular characterization of the claudin-low intrinsic subtype of breast cancer.Breast Cancer Res. 2010; 12: R68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). Compared to the four other breast tumor subtypes (i.e., luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched, and basal-like), CL tumors have the lowest expression of epithelial differentiation markers CD24, EpCAM, and KRT7/19 and the cell-adhesion proteins CLDN3/4/7 and CDH1, while exhibiting highest expression of the mesenchymal markers VIM, N-cadherin, SNAI2, and TWIST1 (Prat et al., 2010Prat A. Parker J.S. Karginova O. Fan C. Livasy C. Herschkowitz J.I. He X. Perou C.M. Phenotypic and molecular characterization of the claudin-low intrinsic subtype of breast cancer.Breast Cancer Res. 2010; 12: R68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). Hierarchical clustering of 22 genes characteristic of EMT and stemness from gene expression data of TSKI4 cells and 52 breast cancer cells lines reported by Neve et al., 2006Neve R.M. Chin K. Fridlyand J. Yeh J. Baehner F.L. Fevr T. Clark L. Bayani N. Coppe J.-P. Tong F. et al.A collection of breast cancer cell lines for the study of functionally distinct cancer subtypes.Cancer Cell. 2006; 10: 515-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar revealed that TSKI4 cells clustered most closely with the CL breast cancer subtype (Figure 6A ). Similar to the CL cell lines, TSKI4 cells exhibited an increase in the mesenchymal markers VIM, CDH2, SNAI2, and TWIST1 with loss of the epithelial differentiation and cell adhesion markers CD24, KRT7/8/19, and CLDN4 (Figure 6A). Next, we examined the intersection between genes with unique Entrez identifiers from gene array data of CL cell lines compared to gene array data of TSKI4 cells. The intersection between upregulated and downregulated genes in the CL cell lines compared to TSKI4 cells was determined to be significant with 62 upregulated (p value < 0.005) and 31 downregulated (p value < 0.01) overlapping genes (Figure 6B). This overlapping gene set was plotted on the basis of log2 ratio values from TSKI4 cells to demonstrate gene expression changes of the intersecting TSKI4/CL cell EMT gene signature (Figure 6C). Genes important for the induction of the mesenchymal phenotype—such as CDH2, DKK1, MET, PDGFRβ, SNAI2, TIMP2, THY1, TWIST1, and VIM—were significantly upregulated, while genes important for maintenance of the epithelial phenotype and cell adhesion—such as AIM1, BCAM, KRT7, KRT19, and RAB25—were repressed (Figure 6C). In addition to these known regulators of EMT, this significant genetic intersection between two distinct EMT models with stem cell characteristics highlights a gene set important for both EMT and stemness. TS cell EMT models, TSKI4, and TSSnail demonstrated selective loss of histone H2A/H2BAc (Figure 4D). By H2BK5Ac ChIP-qRT-PCR, we examined the levels of H2BK5Ac on 32 downregulated genes that have overlapping gene expression profiles between CL SUM159 and TSKI4 cells and are known to have a significant loss of H2BK5Ac in TSKI4 cells by ChIP-seq (Figure 6C and Table S3). Of the 32 genes tested by H2BK5Ac ChIP-qRT-PCR, 75% of these genes were validated to have a loss of H2BK5Ac and a coordinate loss of gene expression in TSKI4 compared to TSWT cells (Figure 6D and Figures S5A–S5C). Furthermore, 81% of these genes had a similar loss of H2BK5Ac in TSSnail cells (Figure 6D and Figures S5B and S5C). Due to the significant genetic intersection between CL cell lines and the TSKI4 EMT model, we determined the levels of H2BK5Ac on the promoters of the same 32 overlapping genes in the CL SUM159 cell line. Importantly, 80% of these genes had a loss of H2BK5Ac in SUM159 cells compared to human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs), as determined by ChIP-qRT-PCR (Figure 6E and Figures S5D and S5E). These results suggest that loss of H2BK5Ac represses genes with an important role in maintenance of the epithelial phenotype, thereby contributing to the progression of two distinct EMT programs. The pathological significance of the TSKI4/CL association was further emphasized by comparing the gene expression profile of TSKI4 cells to the five intrinsic molecular subtypes of breast tumors cataloged in the UNC337 data set (Prat et al., 2010Prat A. Parker J.S. Karginova O. Fan C. Livasy C. Herschkowitz J.I. He X. Perou C.M. Phenotypic and molecular characterization of the claudin-low intrinsic subtype of breast cancer.Breast Cancer Res. 2010; 12: R68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). Tumors from the CL breast cancer subtype showed highest expression of the TSKI4 gene expression signature compared to the basal-like, HER2-enriched, luminal A, and luminal B breast tumors (Figure 6F). Further analysis of the overlapping gene-expression profiles in CL human tumors and TSKI4 cells demonstrated a highly significant intersection between the gene array profiles of TSKI4 cells and CL human tumors (p value < 0.0001 for upregulated genes) (Figure 6G).

https://openalex.org/W1973447501,"Background Despite a plethora of bioluminescent reporter genes being cloned and used for cell assays and molecular imaging purposes, the simultaneous monitoring of multiple events in small animals is still challenging. This is partly attributable to the lack of optimization of cell reporter gene expression as well as too much spectral overlap of the color-coupled reporter genes. A new red emitting codon-optimized luciferase reporter gene mutant of Photinus pyralis, Ppy RE8, has been developed and used in combination with the green click beetle luciferase, CBG99. Principal Findings Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) were transfected with vectors that expressed red Ppy RE8 and green CBG99 luciferases. Populations of red and green emitting cells were mixed in different ratios. After addition of the shared single substrate, D-luciferin, bioluminescent (BL) signals were imaged with an ultrasensitive cooled CCD camera using a series of band pass filters (20 nm). Spectral unmixing algorithms were applied to the images where good separation of signals was observed. Furthermore, HEK293 cells that expressed the two luciferases were injected at different depth in the animals. Spectrally-separate images and quantification of the dual BL signals in a mixed population of cells was achieved when cells were either injected subcutaneously or directly into the prostate. Significance We report here the re-engineering of different luciferase genes for in vitro and in vivo dual color imaging applications to address the technical issues of using dual luciferases for imaging. In respect to previously used dual assays, our study demonstrated enhanced sensitivity combined with spatially separate BL spectral emissions using a suitable spectral unmixing algorithm. This new D-luciferin-dependent reporter gene couplet opens up the possibility in the future for more accurate quantitative gene expression studies in vivo by simultaneously monitoring two events in real time."
https://openalex.org/W2133846291,"Nitrogen (N) availability is a strong determinant of plant biomass partitioning, but the role of different N sources in this process is unknown. Plants inhabiting low productivity ecosystems typically partition a large share of total biomass to belowground structures. In these systems, organic N may often dominate plant available N. With increasing productivity, plant biomass partitioning shifts to aboveground structures, along with a shift in available N to inorganic forms of N. We tested the hypothesis that the form of N taken up by plants is an important determinant of plant biomass partitioning by cultivating Arabidopsis thaliana on different N source mixtures. Plants grown on different N mixtures were similar in size, but those supplied with organic N displayed a significantly greater root fraction. ¹⁵N labelling suggested that, in this case, a larger share of absorbed organic N was retained in roots and split-root experiments suggested this may depend on a direct incorporation of absorbed amino acid N into roots. These results suggest the form of N acquired affects plant biomass partitioning and adds new information on the interaction between N and biomass partitioning in plants."
https://openalex.org/W2163133855,"The transcription factor SOX2 is widely known to play a critical role in the central nervous system; however, its role in peripheral neurogenesis remains poorly understood. We recently developed an hESC-based model in which migratory cells undergo epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) to acquire properties of neural crest (NC) cells. In this model, we found that migratory NC progenitors downregulate SOX2, but then start re-expressing SOX2 as they differentiate to form neurogenic dorsal root ganglion (DRG)-like clusters. SOX2 downregulation was sufficient to induce EMT and resulted in massive apoptosis when neuronal differentiation was induced. In vivo, downregulation of SOX2 in chick and mouse NC cells significantly reduced the numbers of neurons within DRG. We found that SOX2 binds directly to NGN1 and MASH1 promoters and is required for their expression. Our data suggest that SOX2 plays a key role for NGN1-dependent acquisition of neuronal fates in sensory ganglia."
https://openalex.org/W2070760491,"Quantitative imaging of intermediate filaments (IF) during the advanced phase of the assembly process is technically difficult, since the structures are several µm long and therefore they exceed the field of view of many electron (EM) or atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques. Thereby quantitative studies become extremely laborious and time-consuming. To overcome these difficulties, we prepared fluorescently labeled vimentin for visualization by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM). In order to investigate if the labeling influences the assembly properties of the protein, we first determined the association state of unlabeled vimentin mixed with increasing amounts of labeled vimentin under low ionic conditions by analytical ultracentrifugation. We found that bona fide tetrameric complexes were formed even when half of the vimentin was labeled. Moreover, we demonstrate by quantitative atomic force microscopy and electron microscopy that the morphology and the assembly properties of filaments were not affected when the fraction of labeled vimentin was below 10%. Using fast frame rates we observed the rapid deposition of fluorescently labeled IFs on glass supports by TIRFM in real time. By tracing their contours, we have calculated the persistence length of long immobilized vimentin IFs to 1 µm, a value that is identical to those determined for shorter unlabeled vimentin. These results indicate that the structural properties of the filaments were not affected significantly by the dye. Furthermore, in order to analyze the late elongation phase, we mixed long filaments containing either Alexa 488- or Alexa 647-labeled vimentin. The 'patchy' structure of the filaments obtained unambiguously showed the elongation of long IFs through direct end-to-end annealing of individual filaments."
https://openalex.org/W2126657273,"Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a Gram-positive human pathogen best known for causing pharyngeal and mild skin infections. However, in the 1980's there was an increase in severe GAS infections including cellulitis and deeper tissue infections like necrotizing fasciitis. Particularly striking about this elevation in the incidence of severe disease was that those most often affected were previously healthy individuals. Several groups have shown that changes in gene content or regulation, as with proteases, may contribute to severe disease; yet strains harboring these proteases continue to cause mild disease as well. We and others have shown that group A streptococci (MGAS5005) reside within biofilms both in vitro and in vivo. That is to say that the organism colonizes a host surface and forms a 3-dimensional community encased in a protective matrix of extracellular protein, DNA and polysaccharide(s). However, the mechanism of assembly or dispersal of these structures is unclear, as is the relationship of these structures to disease outcome. Recently we reported that allelic replacement of the streptococcal regulator srv resulted in constitutive production of the streptococcal cysteine protease SpeB. We further showed that the constitutive production of SpeB significantly decreased MGAS5005Δsrv biofilm formation in vitro. Here we show that mice infected with MGAS5005Δsrv had significantly larger lesion development than wild-type infected animals. Histopathology, Gram-staining and immunofluorescence link the increased lesion development with lack of disease containment, lack of biofilm formation, and readily detectable levels of SpeB in the tissue. Treatment of MGAS5005Δsrv infected lesions with a chemical inhibitor of SpeB significantly reduced lesion formation and disease spread to wild-type levels. Furthermore, inactivation of speB in the MGAS5005Δsrv background reduced lesion formation to wild-type levels. Taken together, these data suggest a mechanism by which GAS disease may transition from mild to severe through the Srv mediated dispersal of GAS biofilms."
https://openalex.org/W2033382599,"Although amino acids can function as signaling molecules in the regulation of many cellular processes, mechanisms surrounding L-threonine involvement in embryonic stem cell (ESC) functions have not been explored. Thus, we investigated the effect of L-threonine on regulation of mouse (m)ESC self-renewal and related signaling pathways. In L-threonine-depleted mESC culture media mRNA of self-renewal marker genes, [(3)H]thymidine incorporation, expression of c-Myc, Oct4, and cyclins protein was attenuated. In addition, resupplying L-threonine (500 μM) after depletion restores/maintains the mESC proliferation. Disruption of the lipid raft/caveolae microdomain through treatment with methyl-β-cyclodextrin or transfection with caveolin-1 specific small interfering RNA blocked L-threonine-induced proliferation of mESCs. Addition of L-threonine induced phosphorylation of Akt, ERK, p38, JNK/SAPK, and mTOR in a time-dependent manner. This activity was blocked by LY 294002 (PI3K inhibitor), wortmannin (PI3K inhibitor), or an Akt inhibitor. L-threonine-induced activation of mTOR, p70S6K, and 4E-BP1 as well as cyclins and Oct4 were blocked by PD 98059 (ERK inhibitor), SB 203580 (p38 inhibitor) or SP 600125 (JNK inhibitor). Furthermore, L-threonine induced phosphorylation of raptor and rictor binding to mTOR was completely inhibited by 24 h treatment with rapamycin (mTOR inhibitor); however, a 10 min treatment with rapamycin only partially inhibited rictor phosphorylation. L-threonine induced translocation of rictor from the membrane to the cytosol/nuclear, which blocked by pretreatment with rapamycin. In addition, rapamycin blocked L-threonine-induced increases in mRNA expressions of trophoectoderm and mesoderm marker genes and mESC proliferation. In conclusion, L-threonine stimulated ESC G(1)/S transition through lipid raft/caveolae-dependent PI3K/Akt, MAPKs, mTOR, p70S6K, and 4E-BP1 signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2059647424,"Age-related bone loss is associated with changes in bone cellularity with characteristically low levels of osteoblastogenesis. The mechanisms that explain these changes remain unclear. Although recent in vitro evidence has suggested a new role for proteins of the nuclear envelope in osteoblastogenesis, the role of these proteins in bone cells differentiation and bone metabolism in vivo remains unknown. In this study, we used the lamin A/C null (Lmna−/−) mice to identify the role of lamin A/C in bone turnover and bone structure in vivo. At three weeks of age, histological and micro computed tomography measurements of femurs in Lmna−/− mice revealed a significant decrease in bone mass and microarchitecture in Lmna−/− mice as compared with their wild type littermates. Furthermore, quantification of cell numbers after normalization with bone surface revealed a significant reduction in osteoblast and osteocyte numbers in Lmna−/− mice compared with their WT littermates. In addition, Lmna−/− mice have significantly lower osteoclast number, which show aberrant changes in their shape and size. Finally, mechanistic analysis demonstrated that absence of lamin A/C is associated with increase expression of MAN-1 a protein of the nuclear envelope closely regulated by lamin A/C, which also colocalizes with Runx2 thus affecting its capacity as osteogenic transcription factor. In summary, these data clearly indicate that the presence of lamin A/C is necessary for normal bone turnover in vivo and that absence of lamin A/C induces low bone turnover osteopenia resembling the cellular changes of age-related bone loss."
https://openalex.org/W2116745209,"We lack the understanding of why HIV-infected individuals in South Africa progress to AIDS. We hypothesised that in end-stage disease there is a shifting dynamic between T cell imposed immunity and viral immune escape, which, through both compensatory and reverting viral mutations, results in increased viral fitness, elevated plasma viral loads and disease progression. We explored how T cell responses, viral adaptation and viral fitness inter-relate in South African cohorts recruited from Bloemfontein, the Free State (n = 278) and Durban, KwaZulu-Natal (n = 775). Immune responses were measured by γ-interferon ELISPOT assays. HLA-associated viral polymorphisms were determined using phylogenetically corrected techniques, and viral replication capacity (VRC) was measured by comparing the growth rate of gag-protease recombinant viruses against recombinant NL4-3 viruses. We report that in advanced disease (CD4 counts <100 cells/µl), T cell responses narrow, with a relative decline in Gag-directed responses (p<0.0001). This is associated with preserved selection pressure at specific viral amino acids (e.g., the T242N polymorphism within the HLA-B*57/5801 restricted TW10 epitope), but with reversion at other sites (e.g., the T186S polymorphism within the HLA-B*8101 restricted TL9 epitope), most notably in Gag and suggestive of ""immune relaxation"". The median VRC from patients with CD4 counts <100 cells/µl was higher than from patients with CD4 counts ≥ 500 cells/µl (91.15% versus 85.19%, p = 0.0004), potentially explaining the rise in viral load associated with disease progression. Mutations at HIV Gag T186S and T242N reduced VRC, however, in advanced disease only the T242N mutants demonstrated increasing VRC, and were associated with compensatory mutations (p = 0.013). These data provide novel insights into the mechanisms of HIV disease progression in South Africa. Restoration of fitness correlates with loss of viral control in late disease, with evidence for both preserved and relaxed selection pressure across the HIV genome. Interventions that maintain viral fitness costs could potentially slow progression."
https://openalex.org/W1987461554,"The ratio of the lengths of the second and fourth finger (2D∶4D) has been described as reflecting the degree of prenatal androgen exposure in humans. 2D∶4D is smaller for males than females and is associated with traits such as left-handedness, physical aggression, attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder and a genetic polymorphism of the androgen receptor. All of these traits are known to be correlated to the vulnerability for alcohol dependency. We therefore hypothesized low 2D∶4D in patients with alcohol dependency. In the present study on 131 patients suffering from alcohol dependency and 185 healthy volunteers, we found that alcohol dependent patients had smaller 2D∶4D ratios compared to controls with preserved sexual dimorphism but with reduced right-left differences. The detection of alcohol dependency based on 2D∶4D ratios was most accurate using the right hand of males (ROC-analysis: AUC 0.725, sensitivity 0.667, specificity 0.723). These findings provide novel insights into the role of prenatal androgen exposure in the development of alcohol dependency and for the use of 2D∶4D as a possible trait marker in identifying patients with alcohol dependency."
https://openalex.org/W2066672028,"Introduction Sleep is a complex phenomenon characterized by important modifications throughout life and by changes of autonomic cardiovascular control. Aging is associated with a reduction of the overall heart rate variability (HRV) and a decrease of complexity of autonomic cardiac regulation. The aim of our study was to evaluate the HRV complexity using two entropy-derived measures, Shannon Entropy (SE) and Corrected Conditional Entropy (CCE), during sleep in young and older subjects. Methods A polysomnographic study was performed in 12 healthy young (21.1±0.8 years) and 12 healthy older subjects (64.9±1.9 years). After the sleep scoring, heart period time series were divided into wake (W), Stage 1–2 (S1-2), Stage 3–4 (S3-4) and REM. Two complexity indexes were assessed: SE(3) measuring the complexity of a distribution of 3-beat patterns (SE(3) is higher when all the patterns are identically distributed and it is lower when some patterns are more likely) and CCEmin measuring the minimum amount of information that cannot be derived from the knowledge of previous values. Results Across the different sleep stages, young subjects had similar RR interval, total variance, SE(3) and CCEmin. In the older group, SE(3) and CCEmin were reduced during REM sleep compared to S1-2, S3-4 and W. Compared to young subjects, during W and sleep the older subjects showed a lower RR interval and reduced total variance as well as a significant reduction of SE(3) and CCEmin. This decrease of entropy measures was more evident during REM sleep. Conclusion Our study indicates that aging is characterized by a reduction of entropy indices of cardiovascular variability during wake/sleep cycle, more evident during REM sleep. We conclude that during aging REM sleep is associated with a simplification of cardiac control mechanisms that could lead to an impaired ability of the cardiovascular system to react to cardiovascular adverse events."
https://openalex.org/W2047842052,"Herein we measure the effect of four adaptive non-synonymous mutations to the glycerol kinase (glpK) gene on catalytic function and regulation, to identify changes that correlate to increased fitness in glycerol media. The mutations significantly reduce affinity for the allosteric inhibitor fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) and formation of the tetramer, which are structurally related, in a manner that correlates inversely with imparted fitness during growth on glycerol, which strongly suggests that these enzymatic parameters drive growth improvement. Counterintuitively, the glpK mutations also increase glycerol-induced auto-catabolite repression that reduces glpK transcription in a manner that correlates to fitness. This suggests that increased specific GlpK activity is attenuated by negative feedback on glpK expression via catabolite repression, possibly to prevent methylglyoxal toxicity. We additionally report that glpK mutations were fixed in 47 of 50 independent glycerol-adapted lineages. By far the most frequently mutated locus (nucleotide 218) was mutated in 20 lineages, strongly suggesting this position has an elevated mutation rate. This study demonstrates that fitness correlations can be used to interrogate adaptive processes at the protein level and to identify the regulatory constraints underlying selection and improved growth. Herein we measure the effect of four adaptive non-synonymous mutations to the glycerol kinase (glpK) gene on catalytic function and regulation, to identify changes that correlate to increased fitness in glycerol media. The mutations significantly reduce affinity for the allosteric inhibitor fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) and formation of the tetramer, which are structurally related, in a manner that correlates inversely with imparted fitness during growth on glycerol, which strongly suggests that these enzymatic parameters drive growth improvement. Counterintuitively, the glpK mutations also increase glycerol-induced auto-catabolite repression that reduces glpK transcription in a manner that correlates to fitness. This suggests that increased specific GlpK activity is attenuated by negative feedback on glpK expression via catabolite repression, possibly to prevent methylglyoxal toxicity. We additionally report that glpK mutations were fixed in 47 of 50 independent glycerol-adapted lineages. By far the most frequently mutated locus (nucleotide 218) was mutated in 20 lineages, strongly suggesting this position has an elevated mutation rate. This study demonstrates that fitness correlations can be used to interrogate adaptive processes at the protein level and to identify the regulatory constraints underlying selection and improved growth. Adaptive mutations are selected specifically because the altered genetic locus significantly effects phenotype to improve fitness in the organism's current environment. As such, discovered adaptive single nucleotide polymorphisms provide an opportunity to study modulation of significant phenotype characteristics at the finest genetic level, and to determine the underlying molecular and biochemical mechanisms that mediate dynamic genetic control of phenotype. In this study, we examine adaptive mutations to the glycerol kinase gene (glpK) 3The abbreviations used are:glpKglycerol kinase geneFBPfructose-1,6-bisphosphateGLPKglycerol kinase. that each independently improves growth on glycerol media. These mutations were acquired during 44-day adaptive evolution experiments of Escherichia coli on glycerol-supplemented M9 minimal medium, and were discovered by whole-genome resequencing in addition to mutations to other genes (1Fong S.S. Joyce A.R. Palsson B.Ø. Genome Research. 2005; 15: 1365-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Glycerol kinase was the only gene that acquired a non-synonymous mutation in all five adapted lineages. glycerol kinase gene fructose-1,6-bisphosphate glycerol kinase. The repeated acquisition of a mutation to the same gene suggests that the mutations are selected to alleviate a specific constraint related to the gene function. This constraint could be difficult to identify because non-synonymous mutations often alter many enzyme properties, as well as other distant interactions (1Fong S.S. Joyce A.R. Palsson B.Ø. Genome Research. 2005; 15: 1365-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 2Knight C.G. Zitzmann N. Prabhakar S. Antrobus R. Dwek R. Hebestreit H. Rainey P.B. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 1015-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, given a set of mutations that alleviate the same constraint with varying degrees of efficacy, the property under selection should stand out because of its correlation to fitness gain. Glycerol kinase is the rate-limiting enzyme in glycerol metabolism (3Lin E.C. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1976; 30: 535-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), suggesting that the mutations alleviate insufficient in vivo GlpK activity during growth on glycerol. In this study, the effects of four adaptive GlpK mutants are profiled (Table 1). The fitness gains imparted by these mutants have previously been carefully measured (4Applebee M.K. Herrgård M.J. Palsson B.Ø. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 5087-5094Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), but they do not correlate with previously measured increases in Vmax (4Applebee M.K. Herrgård M.J.

Bacteriol. 1970; 102: 753-759Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Its kinetics significantly diverge from Michaelis-Menten behavior due to substrate activation by ATP (7Pettigrew D.W. Yu G.J. Liu Y. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8620-8627Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). GlpK activity is regulated by multiple mechanisms, including allosteric inhibition by both fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) (8Zwaig N. Lin E.C. Science. 1966; 153: 755-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and IIAGlc (the cytosolic subunit of the glucose-specific phosphotransferase system) (9Postma P.W. Epstein W. Schuitema A.R.

J Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 810-816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These signals of glucose metabolism and uptake, respectively, inhibit GlpK activity during growth on glucose and other catabolically preferred substrates, although there is evidence that FBP inhibition is the dominant control mechanism (11Holtman C.K. Pawlyk A.C. Meadow N.D. Pettigrew D.W. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3336-3344Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In solution, the GlpK enzyme exists in a dimer-tetramer equilibrium that is thermodynamically and structurally coupled to FBP binding (12de Riel J.K. Paulus H. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 5141-5146Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 13de Riel J.K. Paulus H. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 5134-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). On one hand, the apparent dissociation constant of the dimer-tetramer reaction is dependent on the concentration of FBP. On the other, tetramer formation is required for FBP inhibition, making the apparent affinity for FBP dependent on the concentration of protein (10Novotny M.J. Frederickson W.L. Waygood E.B. Saier Jr., M.H. J Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 810-816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12de Riel J.K. Paulus H. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 5141-5146Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 14Yu P.

The glpFKX operon is repressed by GlpR in absence of intracellular glycerol (specific repression), though this repression is thought to be leaky since GlpK is required to produce glycerol-3-phosphate to alleviate GlpR repression. CRP-cAMP induces glpFKX expression when levels of cAMP are high and is considered necessary for strong expression as this operon is otherwise considered catabolite repressed. All strains utilized in this study are derived from E. coli K-12 MG1655 (ATCC 47076), with the exception of those used for vector maintenance and protein expression described below. “Wild type” E. coli refers to genetically-unmodified MG1655 (ATCC 47076) stock strain. The GlpK mutant strains were derived in a previous study by introducing individual glpK mutations into the wild-type genome by λred recombination (5Herring C.D. Raghunathan A. Honisch C. Patel T. Applebee M.K. Joyce A.R. Albert T.J. Blattner F.R. van den Boom D. Cantor C.R. Palsson B.Ø. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 1406-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 17Herring C.D. Glasner J.D. Blattner F.R. Gene. 2003; 311: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Mutant and wild-type glpK sequences were cloned into vector pGEX-6P-1 (GE Healthcare) using the EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites. The mutant GlpK sequences were amplified by PCR from glycerol-evolved end point colonies (supplemental Table S1) (5Herring C.D. Raghunathan A. Honisch C. Patel T. Applebee M.K. Joyce A.R. Albert T.J. Blattner F.R. van den Boom D. Cantor C.R. Palsson B.Ø. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 1406-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), and validated by Sanger sequencing. It should be noted that the EcoRI restriction site is eight codons downstream from the PreScission protease cleavage site, which adds 8 residues (Gly-Pro-Leu-Gly-Ser-Pro-Glu-Phe-) to the N terminus of the expressed protein. Mutant GlpK proteins were expressed from pGEX-6P-1 constructs transformed into One Shot BL21 star (DE3) E. coli (Invitrogen). Clones were grown in 2 × 200 ml cultures of LB ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Expression of GlpK mutants after addition of 1 mm IPTG was monitored by the 56 kDa band from SDS-PAGE analysis of whole lysate, visualized using SimplyBlue Safe Stain (Invitrogen). Optimal expression after IPTG addition was observed after 5 h. Collected cells were lysed using lysozyme and sonication. GST-tagged GlpK enzymes were purified using 1 ml GSTrap FF columns (GE Healthcare). Before column loading, the sonicated lysate was clarified by centrifugation and filtration of the supernatant through a 0.45 μm syringe filter. GSTrap FF columns were used as described by the manufacturer except that 10 mm glycerol was added to both the binding buffer and the PreScission cleavage buffer to stabilize GlpK conformation, and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol was added to the binding buffer to minimize oxidative damage. Glycerol kinase protein was eluted from the column by cleavage of the glutathione S-transferase domain by PreScission protease (GE Healthcare). SDS-PAGE of 10 mg the eluted protein showed a high concentration of ∼60 kDa protein corresponding to GlpK, and traces of three other unknown proteins that correspond to frequently co-purified chaperones (supplemental Fig. S1). The apparent molecular weight of each GlpK allozyme was determined by small zone analytical gel permeation chromatography using an Akta Purifier HPLC system with a Bio-Gel 0.5 m column (1.0 × 30 cm). The column was equilibrated with standard buffer (0.1 m triethanolamine-HCl, pH 7.0, 2 mm glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and calibrated as previously described (15Liu W.Z. Faber R. Feese M. Remington S.J. Pettigrew D.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10120-10126Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The column was injected with 0.1 mg of each variant protein in 0.2 ml of standard buffer, with a column flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. The apparent elution volume was determined by monitoring the absorbance at 280 nm, and the apparent molecular weight was estimated by using the column calibration curve. The enzymes were equilibrated with standard buffer by gel permeation chromatography. Enzyme concentrations and glycerol kinase activities at pH 7.0 and 25 °C were determined and catalytic and allosteric parameters were obtained from fits of initial-velocity enzyme kinetics data as described (18Pettigrew D.W. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 2009; 492: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Enzyme was assayed at 0.5 μg/ml concentration, unless otherwise noted. Glycerol was 2 mm in all assays. ATP was 2.5 mm for studies of FBP and IIAGlc inhibition. The results are presented as the best fit parameter ± S.E. as given from fits obtained with Kaleidagraph v. 3.51 (Synergy Software), unless otherwise noted. Inhibition by FBP was analyzed by fitting the dependence of the specific activity (SA) on FBP concentration in Equation 1,SA=SA0-((SA0(1-W)[FBP]nH)/((K0.5)nH+[FBP]nH))Eq. 1 where SA refers to the SA at the indicated concentration of FBP, SA0 is the SA at 0 FBP, W is SA∞/SA0 with SA∞ the SA in the saturating presence of FBP, K0.5 is the FBP concentration that gives one-half maximal inhibition, and nH is the Hill coefficient. The inhibition parameters could not be independently estimated from fitting the data because the apparent FBP affinities were reduced so dramatically (see “Results”). To enable data for the variant enzymes to be fitted, the values for the Hill coefficient and W were fixed to the values obtained from the fits to the N-terminal extension native enzyme. Inhibition by IIAGlc was analyzed by fitting the dependence of the SA on the concentration of IIAGlc in Equation 2,SA=SA0-((SA0(1-W)[IIAGIc])/(K0.5+[IIAGIc]))Eq. 2 where, SA is the SA at the indicated concentration of IIAGlc, SA0 is the SA at 0 IIAGlc, W is SA∞/SA0 with SA∞ the SA in the saturating presence of IIAGlc, and K0.5 is the IIAGlc concentration that gives one-half maximal inhibition. Each culture was grown in 200–250 ml of M9 medium + 0.2% of carbon source in a 500-ml Erlenmeyer flask incubated at 30 °C by water bath and aerated by magnetic stir bar spinning at 1200–1400 rpm. The A600 of the cultures were measured every 40–80 min using a Thermo Spectronic BioMate3 spectrophotometer starting at ∼0.02 A culture density. At least three data points (linear fit R2 >0.99) were used to calculate each growth rate measurement, and the growth rate of each strain in each condition was measured on at least three different days. Samples of culture were collected during logarithmic growth at absorbances between 0.10–0.30, absorbance measured at 600 nm. Sample preparation was modeled after that described by A. Death et al. (19Death A. Ferenci T. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5101-5107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using Millipore® 25-mm diameter 0.45-μm pore Triton-free nitrocellulose filters. The volume of culture passed through the filter was estimated from absorbance to contain approximately the same number of cells as 1 ml of culture with an absorbance of 1 (i.e. 5 ml was collected from a culture at 0.2 A). Cells on the filter were immediately washed with 10 ml of 30 °C fresh media to rinse away extracellular cAMP, and then the filter was quickly submerged in 5 ml of ice-cold 65% ethanol to quench cellular activity. The samples were immediately vortexed at the maximum setting for 5–10 s and stored at −20 °C (19Death A. Ferenci T. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5101-5107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The solution was evaporated by speedvac, and the dried residue re-dissolved in the cAMP assay buffer provided with the cAMP Direct Biotrack EIA kit (GE Healthcare), which was used to assay cAMP levels using the manufacturer's instructions for the non-acetylation protocol. One-fifth of each sample was used per assay. Each strain was cultured in triplicate, and each sample was assayed twice. Three independent cultures of each strain were harvested during exponential growth. As described elsewhere (20Lee D.H. Palsson B.O. Appl. Env. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 4158-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 21Covert M.W. Knight E.M. Reed J.L. Herrgard M.J. Palsson B.O. Nature. 2004; 429: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar), RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNAprotect and RNeasy kit and 10 μg of RNA was converted to cDNA using random hexamers and Invitrogen SuperScript II reverse transcriptase. Each quantitative PCR (qPCR) reaction contained 5–10 ng of cDNA, 0.3 μm of each primer, and 12.5 μl of 2× SYBR Master Mix (Qiagen) (see supplemental Table S1 for primer sequences). Assays were measured by an iCycler iQ (Bio-Rad). Each qPCR reaction was performed in triplicate. The relative expression of each gene was calculated by normalization to the quantity of dmsA (assay for glpK in strain kA and kC versus wild type) or rrsB (all other assays). qPCR results were analyzed using qGene software (22Muller P.Y. Janovjak H. Miserez A.R. Dobbie Z. BioTechniques. 2002; 32 (1376, 1378-1379): 1372-1374PubMed Google Scholar). The efficiency of each primer pair was calculated by generating a standard curve from qPCR of E. coli genomic DNA diluted 102-106-fold. Three technical replicates of each biological cDNA sample were assayed, and the Cq values averaged to calculate the mean normalized expression. Significant differences in growth rates, intracellular cAMP, and gene expression between each mutant strain and wild type in each growth condition were determined by one-way ANOVA with matching of co-acquired measurements, and Dunnett's multiple comparisons post-test against wild type values. These analyses were performed on GraphPad Prism software. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated with two-tails using GraphPad software. The fitness differences between wild type and the glpK mutant strains were not measured during the previous competition study (4Applebee M.K. Herrgård M.J. Palsson B.Ø. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 5087-5094Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), so the selection rate between wild type and the Q37P mutant was estimated from the measured growth rate difference between the strains (0.058 h−1 ± 0.016 (S.E.), from Table 1). A single relative fitness value for each mutant strain relative to the Q37P mutant was calculated from the pool of pair-wise competition measurements (4Applebee M.K. Herrgård M.J. Palsson B.Ø. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 5087-5094Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) by averaging all possible combinations of competitions that produce an estimated fitness difference between a particular pair when summed. A total of 50 lineages were adaptively evolved on glycerol minimal medium to sample the variety of adaptive glycerol kinase mutations that may be acquired. Adaptation of lineages G1, G2, and GA-GE have been described elsewhere (1Fong S.S. Joyce A.R. Palsson B.Ø. Genome Research. 2005; 15: 1365-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 5Herring C.D. Raghunathan A. Honisch C. Patel T. Applebee M.K. Joyce A.R. Albert T.J. Blattner F.R. van den Boom D.

Nature. 2002; 420: 186-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar), and the same method was used to develop the additional 44 “eBOP” lineages. The lineages were evolved for 25 or 40 days (supplemental Table S2). Mutations to the glpK gene were identified by Sanger sequencing of PCR products with two sets of primers that amplify overlapping regions of the glpK gene, covering the region −100 bp upstream to 1,510 bp downstream of the transcription start site. We measured the functional properties of each of four GlpK allozymes (Table 1), including initial velocity kinetics and sensitivity to allosteric inhibitors FBP and IIAGlc, to assess the relationship between changes to enzyme function and fitness caused by the mutations. Results of these assays are shown in Fig. 1 and Table 2. The effect of the N-terminal extension is summarized in Table 2 and supplemental Note S1 and was determined not to be significant.TABLE 2Catalytic and allosteric properties of GlpK mutantsGlpK residue changeCatalytic parametersaCatalytic parameters are obtained from fits of the dependence of the initial velocity on [ATP] in the saturating presence of glycerol (10 mm) to the Michaelis-Menten equation.

Open table in a new tab Native GlpK has two apparent Michaelis constants that describe how the initial velocity depends on ATP concentration, a high affinity constant of about 10 μm, and a lower affinity constant of about 2 mm (7Pettigrew D.W.

Estimating the apparent lower ATP affinity constant is problematic because GlpK also becomes substrate-inhibited by ATP at those concentrations. For this reason, we only examined the effect of the amino acid substitutions on catalytic parameters Km and Vmax at ATP concentrations that reveal changes to the high affinity constant. Results of these determinations show that the catalytic properties for the GlpK allozymes V61L and D72V differ little from those of the wild type GlpK. For allozymes M271I and Q37P, both Km for ATP and Vmax are increased. It is evident that the increased fitness observed across the GlpK mutant strains is not correlated with their catalytic properties, as shown by the poor associated Spearman correlations (Table 2). Allosteric inhibition of GlpK by FBP or IIAGlc was determined in the saturating presence of glycerol (2 mm) and near-saturating ATP (2.5 mm). When assayed under these"

In this study, we determined the dose-dependent effects of dietary fat on the development of this metabolic condition with a focus on changes in gene expression in the small intestine. C57BL/6J mice were fed diets with either 10, 20, 30 or 45 energy% (E%) derived from fat for four weeks (n = 10 mice/diet). We found a significant higher weight gain in mice fed the 30E% and 45E% fat diet compared to mice on the control diet. These data indicate that the main shift towards an obese phenotype lies between a 20E% and 30E% dietary fat intake. Analysis of differential gene expression in the small intestine showed a fat-dose dependent gradient in differentially expressed genes, with the highest numbers in mice fed the 45E% fat diet. The main shift in fat-induced differential gene expression was found between the 30E% and 45E% fat diet. Furthermore, approximately 70% of the differentially expressed genes were changed in a fat-dose dependent manner. Many of these genes were involved in lipid metabolism-related processes and were already differentially expressed on a 30E% fat diet. Taken together, we conclude that up to 20E% of dietary fat, the small intestine has an effective 'buffer capacity' for fat handling. From 30E% of dietary fat, a switch towards an obese phenotype is triggered. We further speculate that especially fat-dose dependently changed lipid metabolism-related genes are involved in development of obesity."

IntroductionVesicles transport biosynthetic cargo and lipids between different compartments of the endomembrane system. Formation of the transport vesicles requires adaptors, coat proteins, and regulatory GTPases of the Arf1/Sar1 family. The initial contact between a vesicle and its target membrane requires Rab GTPases and tethers, which are in most cases multisubunit complexes. Rab GTPases, which cycle between an inactive GDP- and active GTP-bound state, and tethers coordinate the assembly of SNARE proteins on vesicle and target membrane into a four-helix bundle, which ultimately drives bilayer fusion (1Cai H.

In addition, Dsl1 and Tip20 are linked to the coatomer, which implies a role in the recognition and/or uncoating of the COPI vesicle (4Frigerio G.

Schmitt H.D. Dev. Cell. 2009; 17: 403-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).The Dsl1 complex is closely linked to the SNAREs Ufe1, Use1/Slt1, Sec20, and Sec22, which are required for fusion at the ER membrane (9Lewis M.J.

The R-SNARE Sec22 is generally accepted as the v-SNARE on COPI vesicles. However, Sec22 has not been previously identified as part of the Dsl1 complex and is dispensable for yeast survival. In addition, it can be functionally replaced by the R-SNARE Ykt6 in anterograde (13Liu Y. Barlowe C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3314-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and potentially also in retrograde transport. Ykt6, which lacks a transmembrane domain and thus is unlikely to function as the sole v-SNARE, is found in multiple SNARE complexes at the Golgi, endosomes, and the vacuole (10Burri L. Lithgow T. Traffic. 2004; 5: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 14Meiringer C.T. Auffarth K. Hou H. Ungermann C. Traffic. 2008; 9: 1510-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).Here, we present additional insights into the interactions and functions of the Dsl1 complex. We show that the two R-SNAREs Sec22 and Ykt6 are associated with the Dsl1 complex, with Sec22 being the preferred subunit. Only Ykt6 is sensitive to Sec18/NSF, whereas the remaining interaction between SNAREs and the Dsl1 complex is unaffected. Reconstitution approaches reveal that the Dsl1 complex contains several interfaces for SNAREs, and in vivo studies suggest that subunits of the Dsl1 complex and the Q-SNAREs are ER-resident proteins. Our data support a model of tethering via coat recognition, followed by SNARE assembly and fusion.DISCUSSIONFusion of Golgi-derived vesicles with the ER requires a close cooperation of the Dsl1 complex (2Kraynack B.A. Chan A. Rosenthal E. Essid M. Umansky B. Waters M.G. Schmitt H.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3963-3977Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) with the SNAREs Ufe1, Use1, Sec20, and Sec22 (12Dilcher M. Veith B. Chidambaram S. Hartmann E. Schmitt H.D. Fischer von Mollard G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3664-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 19Burri L. Varlamov O. Doege C.A. Hofmann K. Beilharz T. Rothman J.E. Söllner T.H. Lithgow T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 9873-9877Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Previous purification of the Dsl1 complex did not yield any R-SNARE but only the Q-SNAREs Use1, Ufe1, and Sec20 (2Kraynack B.A. Chan A. Rosenthal E. Essid M. Umansky B. Waters M.G. Schmitt H.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3963-3977Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, Use1 interacts with Sec20, Ufe1, and the R-SNAREs Sec22 and Ykt6 (19Burri L. Varlamov O. Doege C.A. Hofmann K. Beilharz T. Rothman J.E. Söllner T.H. Lithgow T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 9873-9877Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that Sec22 and Ykt6 are found in substoichiometric amounts in association with the isolated Dsl1 complex, suggesting that Ykt6 may regulate vesicle fusion by binding not only the Q-SNAREs, but also the SNARE-Dsl1 complex. We could not identify a binding site between any Dsl1 complex subunit and Ufe1 or Sec22, indicating that both bind to the Dsl1 complex via the SNAREs Sec20 and Use1 (11Lewis M.J. Rayner J.C. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3017-3024Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), which bind Tip20 and Dsl3 via their N-terminal domains (Fig. 3, A and B) (21Ren Y. Yip C.K. Tripathi A. Huie D. Jeffrey P.D. Walz T. Hughson F.M. Cell. 2009; 139: 1119-1129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that Sec22 is indeed the missing R-SNARE, as expected from previous studies (12Dilcher M. Veith B. Chidambaram S. Hartmann E. Schmitt H.D. Fischer von Mollard G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3664-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 19Burri L. Varlamov O. Doege C.A. Hofmann K. Beilharz T. Rothman J.E. Söllner T.H. Lithgow T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 9873-9877Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Sec22 completely removes Ykt6 from its association with the Dsl1 complex, whereas Ykt6 could not do so in reverse. A similar association of Ykt6 with the Dsl1-SNARE complex was recently observed by Spang and colleagues (37Diefenbacher M. Thorstinsdottir H. Spang A. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 25027-25038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition, Sec18 addition displaced Ykt6, but not Sec22 or the Q-SNAREs, from the Dsl1 complex. It is therefore possible that Ykt6 acts as an acceptor for the preferred SNARE Sec22 at the ER. Our data are consistent with the view that Sec22 is the v-SNARE in vivo, whereas the Q-SNAREs seem to be resident proteins of the ER.While our manuscript was in preparation, two studies provided insight into the structure of the Dsl1 complex (3Tripathi A. Ren Y. Jeffrey P.D. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 21Ren Y. Yip C.K. Tripathi A. Huie D. Jeffrey P.D. Walz T. Hughson F.M. Cell. 2009; 139: 1119-1129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Dsl1 and Tip20 resemble known structures of the exocyst complex (3Tripathi A. Ren Y. Jeffrey P.D. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In agreement with our results, Hughson and co-workers (21Ren Y. Yip C.K. Tripathi A. Huie D. Jeffrey P.D. Walz T. Hughson F.M. Cell. 2009; 139: 1119-1129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) demonstrate that Use1 and Sec20 bind via their N termini to Dsl3 and Tip20, respectively. Our data indicate that Ufe1 requires Sec20 for binding, whereas Sec22 only binds if all other SNAREs are present. This observation is consistent with our initial isolation of Sec22 and Ykt6 with the Dsl1 complex from yeast (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2). The purified Dsl1 complex is, however, very inefficient in promoting SNARE assembly (3Tripathi A. Ren Y. Jeffrey P.D. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and it has not been tested whether the slight increase in complex formation correlates with increased fusion.The Dsl1 complex is a critical factor involved in COPI vesicle recognition at the ER (8Zink S. Wenzel D. Wurm C.A. Schmitt H.D. Dev. Cell. 2009; 17: 403-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Its subunit Dsl1 binds directly to the heterodimeric complex of ∈-COP and the C terminus of α-COP (24Hsia K.C. Hoelz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 11271-11276Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), presumably to tether the COPI vesicles to the ER and promote uncoating. Our data agree with such a combined function and suggest that the ER resident Dsl1 complex then promotes assembly of Sec22 with the Dsl1 complex-bound Q-SNAREs.At the Dsl1 complex, Ykt6 may occupy a binding site to facilitate the association of Sec22 with the Q-SNAREs. Indeed, Sec22 can displace Ykt6, and the reverse is also possible if Sec18 is impaired. Potentially, Ykt6 orients the Dsl1-Q-SNARE complex in such a way that is predominantly competent to bind Sec22 in trans. If this is the case, then Ykt6 would have a more active role in ensuring proper assembly. We consider it unlikely that Ykt6 functions as a v-SNARE on Golgi-derived vesicles because its lipid anchor does not support membrane fusion (25McNew J.A. Weber T. Parlati F. Johnston R.J. Melia T.J. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). However, we cannot exclude a function of Ykt6 on COPI vesicles if Sec22 is lacking. It is also possible that in sec22Δ cells, a small portion of Sec20, Ufe1, or Use1 are recycled via the Golgi back to the ER and thus act as a v-SNARE, though we did not observe incorporation of Ufe1 into COPII-coated vesicles or relocalization of Sec20 into Golgi-like structures, except some dot-like structures in sec18-1 mutants (Fig. 4, C and D). It should be noted that more Ykt6 enters COPII-coated vesicles in sec22Δ cells (13Liu Y. Barlowe C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3314-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), suggesting that Ykt6 may compensate for some of the functions of Sec22. Alternatively, the Golgi SNARE Bet1, which interacts with Ufe1 and Use1 in vitro (37Diefenbacher M. Thorstinsdottir H. Spang A. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 25027-25038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), may function in this process.For the mammalian homolog of Dsl1, ZW10, it has been proposed that the protein is cycling between the ER and the Golgi (26Schmitt H.D. Trends Cell Biol. 2010; 20: 257-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This model is based on the observations that in primate cells ZW10 localizes at the ER, whereas in rodent cells, it is found at the Golgi (27Arasaki K. Uemura T. Tani K. Tagaya M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 359: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 28Hirose H. Arasaki K. Dohmae N. Takio K. Hatsuzawa K. Nagahama M. Tani K. Yamamoto A. Tohyama M. Tagaya M.

Our data on the yeast Dsl1 complex support a model, in which the entire tethering complex resides on one organelle and recruits vesicles via their coat (30Angers C.G. Merz A.J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2011; 22: 18-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Transport vesicles should then maintain their coat to ensure the recognition at the target organelle. Our interaction studies confirm that the Dsl1 complex binds the N-terminal domains of Use1 and Sec20, though it is possible that the complex has additional membrane binding sites. This would position the complex such that it directly couples tethering of COPI vesicles and SNARE-mediated fusion, by bringing together the SNARE on the vesicle with the assembled t-SNARE complex on the ER membrane (Fig. 4G). Interestingly, such a scenario is reminiscent of the proposed interaction of the HOPS complex with the AP-3 coat. Here, the AP-3 subunit Apl5 binds the HOPS subunit Vps41 (31Rehling P. Darsow T. Katzmann D.J. Emr S.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 346-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 32Darsow T. Katzmann D.J. Cowles C.R. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol.

Klose D. Steinhoff H.J. Reggiori F. Engelbrecht-Vandré S. Ungermann C. J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 845-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). HOPS might get stabilized similarly by SNAREs on the vacuole (35Stroupe C. Hickey C.M. Mima J. Burfeind A.S. Wickner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 17626-17633Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and could then tether AP-3 vesicles by binding the coat. We therefore postulate that the tether-coat interaction might be of general importance to drive fusion reactions.

https://openalex.org/W1965387607,"Innate immune activation via IL-1R or Toll-like receptors (TLR) contibutes to acute kidney injury but its role in tissue remodeling during chronic kidney disease is unclear. SIGIRR is an inhibitor of TLR-induced cytokine and chemokine expression in intrarenal immune cells, therefore, we hypothesized that Sigirr-deficiency would aggravate postobstructive renal fibrosis. The expression of TLRs as well as endogenous TLR agonists increased within six days after UUO in obstructed compared to unobstructed kidneys while SIGIRR itself was downregulated by day 10. However, lack of SIGIRR did not affect the intrarenal mRNA expression of proinflammatory and profibrotic mediators as well as the numbers of intrarenal macrophages and T cells or morphometric markers of tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis. Because SIGIRR is known to block TLR/IL-1R signaling at the level of the intracellular adaptor molecule MyD88 UUO experiments were also performed in mice deficient for either MyD88, TLR2 or TLR9. After UUO there was no significant change of tubular interstitial damage and interstitial fibrosis in neither of these mice compared to wildtype counterparts. Additional in-vitro studies with CD90+ renal fibroblasts revealed that TLR agonists induce the expression of IL-6 and MCP-1/CCL2 but not of TGF-β, collagen-1α or smooth muscle actin. Together, postobstructive renal interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy develop independent of SIGIRR, TLR2, TLR9, and MyD88. These data argue against a significant role of these molecules in renal fibrosis."

The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and causes of blindness in persons aged 50 and above in southern Malawi to plan eye care services for the community.A population-based survey was conducted in 7 districts in southern Malawi. Villages were selected by probability proportionate to size within each district. Clusters were further subdivided into segments. A predetermined number of segments were selected randomly in each cluster. The survey team moved from house to house in each segment until they had examined 50 people over the age of 50. Examination consisted of visual acuity measurement with tumbling ""E"" chart and ocular examination by an ophthalmologist. Participants were categorized by visual acuity. Those who were visually impaired (VA<6/18 in the better eye with available correction) were assigned a main cause of visual loss. Further information was sought from anyone who had received cataract surgery.A total number of 3,583 persons aged 50 and above were sampled; among these 3,430 (95.7%) were examined. The prevalence of blindness (presenting visual acuity <3/60 in the better eye) among persons aged 50 and above was 3.3% (95% CI 2.5-4.1). Cataract was the most common cause of blindness contributing to 48.2% of all cases, followed by glaucoma (15.8%) and cornea scarring (12.3%). The cataract surgical coverage in blind persons was 44.6%.The prevalence of blindness and visual impairment in persons aged 50 and above was lower than the WHO estimate for Malawi. The majority of the causes were avoidable, with cataract accounting for approximately half of all cases of blindness. The data suggests that expansion of eye care programs to address avoidable causes of blindness is necessary in this area of southern Malawi."
https://openalex.org/W1988440685,"Methamphetamine (METH) is an addictive and neurotoxic psychostimulant widely abused in the USA and throughout the world. When administered in large doses, METH can cause depletion of striatal dopamine terminals, with preservation of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Because alterations in the expression of transcription factors that regulate the development of dopaminergic neurons might be involved in protecting these neurons after toxic insults, we tested the possibility that their expression might be affected by toxic doses of METH in the adult brain. Male Sprague-Dawley rats pretreated with saline or increasing doses of METH were challenged with toxic doses of the drug and euthanized two weeks later. Animals that received toxic METH challenges showed decreases in dopamine levels and reductions in tyrosine hydroxylase protein concentration in the striatum. METH pretreatment protected against loss of striatal dopamine and tyrosine hydroxylase. In contrast, METH challenges caused decreases in dopamine transporters in both saline- and METH-pretreated animals. Interestingly, METH challenges elicited increases in dopamine transporter mRNA levels in the midbrain in the presence but not in the absence of METH pretreatment. Moreover, toxic METH doses caused decreases in the expression of the dopamine developmental factors, Shh, Lmx1b, and Nurr1, but not in the levels of Otx2 and Pitx3, in saline-pretreated rats. METH pretreatment followed by METH challenges also decreased Nurr1 but increased Otx2 and Pitx3 expression in the midbrain. These findings suggest that, in adult animals, toxic doses of METH can differentially influence the expression of transcription factors involved in the developmental regulation of dopamine neurons. The combined increases in Otx2 and Pitx3 expression after METH preconditioning might represent, in part, some of the mechanisms that served to protect against METH-induced striatal dopamine depletion observed after METH preconditioning."
https://openalex.org/W2055858475,"Di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP), a chemical widely used in many consumer products, is estrogenic and capable of producing seriously reproductive and developmental effects in laboratory animals. However, recent in vitro studies have shown that DBP and mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP), the major metabolite of DBP, possessed thyroid hormone receptor (TR) antagonist activity. It is therefore important to consider DBP and MBP that may interfere with thyroid hormone system.Nieuwkoop and Faber stage 51 Xenopus laevis were exposed to DBP and MBP (2, 10 or 15 mg/L) separately for 21 days. The two test chemicals decelerated spontaneous metamorphosis in X. laevis at concentrations of 10 and 15 mg/L. Moreover, MBP seemed to possess stronger activity. The effects of DBP and MBP on inducing changes of expression of selected thyroid hormone response genes: thyroid hormone receptor-beta (TRβ), retinoid X receptor gamma (RXRγ), alpha and beta subunits of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSHα and TSHβ) were detected by qPCR at all concentrations of the compounds. Using mammalian two-hybrid assay in vitro, we found that DBP and MBP enhanced the interactions between co-repressor SMRT (silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors) and TR in a dose-dependent manner, and MBP displayed more markedly. In addition, MBP at low concentrations (2 and 10 mg/L) caused aberrant methylation of TRβ in head tissue.The current findings highlight potential disruption of thyroid signalling by DBP and MBP and provide data for human risk assessment."
https://openalex.org/W2119522550,"Soluble IgE receptors are potential in vivo modulators of IgE-mediated immune responses and are thus important for our basic understanding of allergic responses. We here characterize a novel soluble version of the IgE-binding alpha-chain of Fc-epsilon-RI (sFcεRI), the high affinity receptor for IgE. sFcεRI immunoprecipitates as a protein of ∼40 kDa and contains an intact IgE-binding site. In human serum, sFcεRI is found as a soluble free IgE receptor as well as a complex with IgE. Using a newly established ELISA, we show that serum sFcεRI levels correlate with serum IgE in patients with elevated IgE. We also show that serum of individuals with normal IgE levels can be found to contain high levels of sFcεRI. After IgE-antigen-mediated crosslinking of surface FcεRI, we detect sFcεRI in the exosome-depleted, soluble fraction of cell culture supernatants. We further show that sFcεRI can block binding of IgE to FcεRI expressed at the cell surface. In summary, we here describe the alpha-chain of FcεRI as a circulating soluble IgE receptor isoform in human serum."
https://openalex.org/W1981444453,"Sphingolipids such as ceramide are recognized as vital regulators of many biological processes. Neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2) is one of the key enzymes regulating ceramide production. It was previously shown that the enzymatic activity of nSMase2 was dependent on anionic phospholipids (APLs). In this study, the structural requirements for APL-selective binding of nSMase2 were determined and characterized. Using lipid-protein overlay assays, nSMase2 interacted specifically and directly with several APLs, including phosphatidylserine and phosphatidic acid. Lipid-protein binding studies of deletion mutants identified two discrete APL binding domains in the N terminus of nSMase2. Further, mutagenesis experiments pinpointed the core sequences and major cationic amino acids in the domains that are necessary for the cooperative activation of nSMase2 by APLs. The first domain included the first amino-terminal hydrophobic segment and Arg-33, which were essential for nSMase2 to interact with APLs. The second binding domain was comprised of the second hydrophobic segment and Arg-92 and Arg-93. Moreover, mutation of one or both domains decreased APL binding and APL-dependent catalytic activity of nSMase2. Further, mutation of both domains in nSMase2 reduced its plasma membrane localization. Finally, these binding domains are also important for the capability of nSMase2 to rescue the defects of yeast lacking the nSMase homologue, ISC1. In conclusion, these data have identified the APL binding domains of nSMase2 for the first time.

Currently, six different SMases have been identified and grouped based upon their catalytic pH optima, including an acid SMase, an alkaline SMase and four neutral SMases (N-SMases) (5Tomiuk S.

Activation of N-SMases has been implicated in various biological responses, such as growth arrest, inflammation and aging (9Nikolova-Karakashian M. Karakashian A. Rutkute K. Subcell.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 11247-11256Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Recently, considerable progress has been made regarding the specific roles of the identified N-SMase isoforms, particularly neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2), in signal transduction and a variety of cell processes (11Clarke C.J.

Mammalian nSMase2 was first identified in 2000 based on similarity to bacterial SMase (6Hofmann K. Tomiuk S. Wolff G. Stoffel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 5895-5900Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The human nSMase2 protein is a membrane-bound 655 amino acid protein consisting of a C-terminal catalytic domain, two N-terminal hydrophobic segments (HSs), and a 200-residue collagen-like domain between the N and C termini (6Hofmann K. Tomiuk S. Wolff G. Stoffel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 5895-5900Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). More recently, nSMase2 was also found to be palmitoylated via thioester bonds at two major sites, one in the N terminus and the other in the catalytic region of the enzyme. Notably, nSMase2 palmitoylation is important for correct subcellular localization and stability of this enzyme (12Tani M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10047-10056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition, nSMase2 was found to localize to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (PM) (13Tani M. Hannun Y.A. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 1323-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A number of studies have implicated nSMase2 in growth arrest, the cellular response to cytokines and oxidative stress. Prior to the cloning of nSMase2, it was first identified as a confluent cell-associated gene in rat 3Y1 cells (14Hayashi Y. Kiyono T. Fujita M. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18082-18086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and was subsequently implicated in confluence-induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in MCF-7 breast cancer cells (15Marchesini N.

Many studies have reported activation of nSMase2 by tumor necrosis factor in a variety of cell types including smooth muscle cells, HUVECs and A549 cells, although regulation of nSMase2 appears to be cell type dependent with protein kinase C-delta and p38 MAPK involved in A549 cells (16Clarke C.J. Truong T.G. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1384-1396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 17Clarke C.J. Guthrie J.M. Hannun Y.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 74: 1022-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and matrix metalloproteinases, furin and integrins involved in smooth muscle cells (18Tellier E. Nègre-Salvayre A. Bocquet B. Itohara S. Hannun Y.A. Salvayre R. Augé N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2997-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In addition, nSMase2 was implicated in aging-associated inflammation, particularly in the response to interleukin-1β (19Karakashian A.A. Giltiay N.V. Smith G.M. Nikolova-Karakashian M.N. Faseb. J. 2004; 18: 968-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Finally, in vivo studies have demonstrated that nSMase2 is essential for late embryonic and postnatal bone development. In particular, nSMase2 knock-out mice develop a form of dwarfism and have delayed puberty as part of a hypothalamus-induced pituitary hormone deficiency (20Stoffel W. Jenke B. Blöck B. Zumbansen M. Koebke J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 4554-4559Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a distinct mutant mouse strain (fro/fro) with inactive nSMase2 developed osteogenesis and dentinogenesis imperfecta (21Aubin I. Adams C.P. Opsahl S. Septier D. Bishop C.E. Auge N. Salvayre R. Negre-Salvayre A. Goldberg M. Guénet J.L. Poirier C. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 803-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Finally, a recent study of human cancers found mutations of nSMase2 in human leukemias (22Kim W.J. Okimoto R.A. Purton L.E. Goodwin M. Haserlat S.M. Dayyani F. Sweetser D.A. McClatchey A.I. Bernard O.A. Look A.T. Bell D.W. Scadden D.T. Haber D.A. Blood. 2008; 111: 4716-4722Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies reveal a multitude of roles for nSMase2 in both physiological and pathological states. Consequently, further understanding of nSMase2 regulation is essential. Protein-phospholipid interactions are important for regulation of both protein localization and activity and, by extension, can have effects on cell signaling. In particular, anionic phospholipids (APLs) such as phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidic acid (PA) play important roles in these interactions (23van Klompenburg W. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. de Kruijff B. EMBO. J. 1997; 16: 4261-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). PS has been implicated in a number of cell signaling pathways. Indeed, several signature domains for PS binding have been identified such as the C2 domain in PKC (24Stahelin R.V. Digman M.A. Medkova M. Ananthanarayanan B. Rafter J.D. Melowic H.R. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29501-29512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and the Gla domain in some coagulation factors (25McDonald J.F. Shah A.M. Schwalbe R.A. Kisiel W. Dahlbäck B. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5120-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) while other less conserved PS binding motifs have also been identified (26Stace C.L. Ktistakis N.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 913-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Importantly, the majority of PS binding motifs contain both positively charged and hydrophobic amino acid residues. Another APL, PA, has also been implicated in cell signaling. PA can be generated rapidly via hydrolysis of PC by phospholipase D or by phosphorylation of diacylglycerol by diacylglycerol kinases. Notably, PA has been shown to regulate both localization and function of several effectors (26Stace C.L. Ktistakis N.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 913-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), which include important signaling regulators such as Raf-1 (27Rizzo M.A. Shome K. Watkins S.C. Romero G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23911-23918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), protein kinase C epsilon (28Corbalán-Garcia S. Sánchez-Carrillo S. García-García J. Gómez-Fernández J.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11661-11668Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and sphingosine kinase 1 (29Delon C. Manifava M. Wood E. Thompson D. Krugmann S. Pyne S. Ktistakis N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44763-44774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). However, although several PA binding sequences have been identified, a signature binding motif for PA has yet to be identified (26Stace C.L. Ktistakis N.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 913-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 30Jones J.A. Rawles R. Hannun Y.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 13235-13245Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, the identification of PA/PS-interacting proteins as well as their binding domains is of interest, and the information will provide further insight into the lipid interaction and regulation of these effectors. Previous studies have shown that nSMase2 activity can be stimulated by APLs (6Hofmann K. Tomiuk S. Wolff G. Stoffel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 5895-5900Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 31Marchesini N. Luberto C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13775-13783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, as nSMase2 does not contain a previously characterized phospholipid binding domain, it is unclear if and where APLs interact with this enzyme. In this study, we find that nSMase2 directly interacts with APLs, in particular with PS and PA. In addition, we have identified two discrete APL selective binding sites in the N terminus of nSMase2, nSM2-APLB1 (nSMase2 APL binding type 1) and nSM2-APLB2 (nSMase2 APL binding type 2) domains. Further mutagenesis experiments allowed us to pinpoint the major cationic amino acids in the domains that are necessary for the cooperative activation of nSMase2 by APLs. Moreover, both domains are important for both activity and subcellular localization of nSMase2 in mammalian cells. Finally, these binding domains are also important for the capability of nSMase2 to rescue the defects of yeast lacking the nSMase homologue, ISC1. Taken together, these results offer insight into the interactions between nSMase2 and APLs. Moreover, these data strongly establish the N terminus of nSMase2 as a crucial component in regulating its activity. Anti-GFP antibody and anti-V5 antibody were purchased from Invitrogen. Goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies were acquired from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. [choline-methyl-14C]SM was provided by the Lipidomics Core Facility at the Medical University of South Carolina. All other lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. HEK293 cells were cultured in MEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or Effectene reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), point and deletion mutations were introduced into the nSMase2 vectors generated previously (12Tani M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

All oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S1. The PCR products and constructs were subsequently sequenced to verify the desired mutations. The HEK293 or MCF-7 cells were collected in lysis buffer (1× PBS, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche)) and homogenized by brief sonication. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 800 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatant was taken for protein determination using BCA Assay (Bio-Rad). Equal amount total proteins from each lysate were loaded onto 4–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels, subjected to electrophoresis, and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The blots were probed using 1:2000 dilution of primary (anti-GFP, FLAG, or β-actin) antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase labeled secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). The signals were detected using Enhanced Chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce). The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain JK9–3dα/isc1Δ (MATa trp1 leu2–3 his4 ura3 ade2 rme1 ISC1::KanMX) (32Sawai H.

Synthetic minimal medium, containing galactose, and uracil dropout supplement were purchased from Clontech. Yeast extract and peptone were from Difco. Plasmids were transformed into yeast cells as previously described (33Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar), and the expression of nSMase2 was induced by incubating the cells in synthetic complete-uracil dropout medium containing 2% galactose overnight and then harvested. Cells were lysed by vortexing with glass beads in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris pH 7.4, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture), and then spun for 100,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant was subjected to immunoprecipitation using a FLAGIPT1-FLAG immunoprecipitation kit according to the manufacturer's instruction and the nSMase-FLAG was finally eluted from beads by adding 3×FLAG peptide solution in the presence of 0.5% Triton X-100. Lipid-protein overlay assays were performed as described previously (34Jones J.A. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15530-15538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, equimolar amounts of the indicated dioleoyl-lipids were spotted onto Hybond C extra nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare). The membranes were allowed to dry for 1 h and were then wetted by floating on purified water. The membranes were equilibrated in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 5 min, followed by blocking with 1.5% fatty acid free bovine serum albumin (BSA)/TBS-T (blocking reagent) for 1 h at room temperature. Cell lysates containing nSMase2 were diluted into blocking reagent to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. The membranes were then incubated in the presence of the enzyme overnight at 4 °C. The protein was identified by incubating with a 1:1500 dilution of anti-GFP or FLAG antibody, followed by incubation with secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution). Finally, the protein was visualized using Enhanced Chemiluminescence with exposure to Biomax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Quantitative densitometry was performed using ImageQuant TL software (GE Healthcare). In vitro neutral SMase enzymatic assays were performed as described previously with modifications (31Marchesini N. Luberto C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13775-13783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were collected and lysed as described above. Each reaction mixture contained 100 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μm [choline-methyl-14C]SM. For kinetics determination, 12.5 μm (0.8 mol%) to 400 μm (25.8 mol%) SMs were used as substrate for the activity assays. To determine the PA or PS effects on the nSMase activity, 3.1 μm (0.2 mol%) to 25 μm (1.6 mol%) PA or 12.5 μm (0.8 mol%) to 400 μm (25.8 mol%) PS were included in the buffer. After incubation for 0.5 h at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 1.5 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1), followed by adding 400 μl of water. Phases were separated by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 5 min. By subjecting 500 μl of the upper phase to scintillation counting, SMase activity was determined by quantification of the amount of released radioactive phosphocholine. HEK293 or MCF-7 cells were plated onto 35-mm confocal dishes (MatTek) and transfected with V5 tagged nSMase2 vectors (1 μg/dish). Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were treated and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min. Following fixation, cells were permeabilized for 5 min with 100% methanol at −20 °C and then blocked in 2% human serum (Jackson) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were blocked in 2% human serum for 1 h at room temperature. Anti-giantin (Covance) or anti-calnexin antibodies were co-incubated with anti-V5 antibody. Incubations were performed in 2% human serum at 1:300 dilutions for 1 h at room temperature. Following incubation with the primary antibody, cells were washed three times with PBS, probed with fluorescent secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were viewed on a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta Confocal Microscope. Yeast cells from colonies transformed with pYES2 vector containing ISC1, ISC1-K168A, nSMase2, or nSMase2 mutants, including R33A/Δ45–48, R92A/R93A, and R33A/R92A/R93A/Δ45–48 were inoculated into liquid minimum medium without uracil containing 2% dextrose. When the cells reached log phase, the cultures were diluted to an absorbance of A600 of 0.3. Three dilutions of 1:10 were performed consecutively for each transformant, cells from each dilution were spotted on uracil dropout minimal medium plates containing galactose and raffinose as carbon source. The plates were made with or without hydroxyurea (10 mg/ml). Spots were checked for growth after 3 to 4 days of incubation at 30 °C. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. The mean value is calculated from a single experiment. The data are representative of at least two independent experiments. Previously, we demonstrated that nSMase2 activity is stimulated by several APLs, especially PS, cardiolipin (CL), and PA (31Marchesini N. Luberto C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13775-13783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To define the physical interactions between nSMase2 and APLs, binding studies were carried out using the lipid-protein overlay method (fat-blot assays) as described previously (35Stevenson J.M. Perera I.Y. Boss W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22761-22767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Using this approach, several phospholipids, including CL, PA, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, and PS, were immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane, and binding was examined by incubation with cell lysates from HEK293 cells overexpressing nSMase2-GFP protein followed by immunostaining with anti-GFP antibody. As a control for nonspecific binding of protein to lipids, GFP overexpressor HEK293 cells were used (Fig. 1, A and B). It was observed that nSMase2-GFP bound strongly to PS, CL, and PA, with modest binding to phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylinositol. On the other hand, no binding was observed to the other immobilized phospholipids. The binding of nSMase2-GFP to phospholipids was very prominent whereas that of GFP was hardly detectable (Fig. 1C). Similar results were further observed when using lyates with overexpressed FLAG-tagged nSMase2 in the isc1Δ strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Fig. 1, D and E). Because nSMase2 localizes predominantly to the PM and partly to the Golgi and CL is predominantly a mitochondrial lipid, we chose to focus the subsequent studies on PA and PS. To demonstrate direct binding of the protein to phospholipids, we evaluated the ability of immunoprecipitated nSMase2 to interact with APLs. As shown in Fig. 1F, the interaction was also detected between APLs and immunoprecipitated nSMase2-FLAG expressed from yeast, confirming the direct binding. In addition, we have performed a competition experiment by adding PA or PS to nSMase2-FLAG prior to overlay assay (Fig. 1G). Interestingly, while preincubation with PS in solution specifically inhibited the PS binding, a preincubation with PA was able to inhibit the binding signals of both PA and PS, suggesting that more than one APL binding domain may exist. Altogether, these results demonstrate specific interaction of nSMase2 with its specific activating APLs. As the N terminus of nSMase2 has two HSs, this region may also contain the APL binding domain. To test this hypothesis, we determined the APL binding capability of the N terminus of nSMase2 (aa 1–123)-GFP and a deletion nSMase2 mutant (Δ12–123) without the HSs (Fig. 2, A and B). As shown in Fig. 2C, only the nSMase2 (aa 1–123)-GFP displayed a robust interaction with PA and PS. In contrast, the N-terminal deletion (Δ12–123) mutant showed no detectable binding. Although the Δ12–123 mutant displayed a lower level of expression (Fig. 2B), no interaction signal detected even at a 5-fold higher concentration for this mutant (supplemental Fig. 2A). These results demonstrate that the N-terminal (aa 1–123) of nSMase2 is both necessary and sufficient for binding to APLs. Next, we examined the binding location by separating the N-terminal of nSMase2 into two segments tagged by GFP at C terminus, nSMase2 (aa 1–52)-GFP containing the 1st HS, and nSMase2 (aa 1–123/Δ12–59)-GFP containing only the 2nd HS (Fig. 2, A and D). Importantly, each of the segments showed binding capability to APLs (Fig. 2E). Interestingly, while the 1st segment showed a higher PA-binding signal, the 2nd segment bound to PS and PA with similar intensity. Thus, two distinct APL-binding domains exist in the N terminus of nSMase2, with preferential interactions with PA. As there are no significant matches between the sequence of nSMase2 and other defined lipid-binding domains, it became important to identify the novel APL binding domains in nSMase2. A mutagenesis approach was applied to identify the key determinants of the 1st APL binding domain in nSMase2. Therefore, a series of GFP-tagged deletion or point mutants were made from mutants within aa 1–59 in nSMase2 tagged by GFP at the C terminus (Fig. 3A). The mutated vectors were then transformed and overexpressed in HEK293 cells successfully according to the Western blot results (Fig. 3B). The PA binding signal on the fat blot was examined by incubation with HEK293 lysates expressing the truncated or point mutants of nSMase2 (aa 1–59)-GFP. As shown in Fig. 3, A and C, while significant binding to PA was observed using the mutant nSMase2(aa 1–52)-GFP, decreased binding was found when deleting the hydrophobic segment as only weak signals were detected from nSMase2 (aa 25–52)-GFP and no binding signals from nSMase2(aa 1–26)-GFP. Because positively charged amino acid have been shown to be important for APL and protein interaction (36Okamoto Y. Vaena De Avalos S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46470-46477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we next determined the effects of mutation of Arg-33 and/or deletion of aa 45–48 (KRQR) on binding to APL. Interestingly, a point mutation of Arg-33 to Ala was enough to eliminate the PA binding signal of nSMase2 (aa 1–40)-GFP. For nSMase2 (aa 1–52)-GFP, mutation of R33A or deletion of aa 45–48 resulted in decreased PA binding. However, only the combination of R33A and deleting aa 45–48 could abolish the interaction, suggesting these positive charged amino acid residues are important for interaction between nSMase2 and APLs via electrostatic interactions. Interestingly, all mutants of the first domain showed substantially less PS binding, and mutation of Arg-33 or deletion of aa 45–48 nearly abolished all detected PS binding. Taken together, the results identify the first domain necessary for APL binding in nSMase2, with a conserved “FPCYWXXDRLXASXXXTXXEKRXR” motif as the binding core sequence (supplemental Fig. S4A). To localize the second APL-specific binding domain in nSMase2, a series of GFP-tagged deletion or point mutants were generated from mutant nSMase2 (aa 1–123/Δ12–59)-GFP (which harbors the second HS) (supplemental Fig. S1A) and overexpressed in HEK293 cells (supplemental Fig. S1B). The lysates were further subjected to fat-blot binding assays (supplemental Fig. S1, A and C). Mutation of either Arg-92 or Arg-93 to Ala decreased APL binding signals whereas mutation of Arg-99 to Ala showed no effects on the interaction signal. Moreover, mutating both Arg-92 and Arg-93 resulted in complete loss of the interaction for nSMase2 (aa 1–123/Δ12–59)-GFP, suggesting that Arg-92 and Arg-93 are the essential amino acid residues to interact with APLs. Further, when part of the 2nd HS was truncated (nSMase2 (aa 68–123)-GFP), the binding signal decreased, and further deletion of this HS ("
https://openalex.org/W2039376141,"The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, an obligate heterotetrameric assembly organized as a dimer of dimers, is typically composed of two glycine-binding GluN1 subunits and two glutamate-binding GluN2 subunits. Despite the crucial role that the NMDA receptor plays in the nervous system, the specific arrangement of subunits within the dimer-of-dimer assemblage is not conclusively known. Here we studied the organization of the amino terminal domain (ATD) of the rat GluN1/GluN2A and GluN1/GluN2B NMDA receptors by cysteine-directed, disulfide bond-mediated cross-linking. We found that GluN1 ATDs and GluN2 ATDs spontaneously formed disulfide bond-mediated dimers after introducing cysteines into the L1 interface of GluN2A or GluN2B ATD. The formation of dimer could be prevented by knocking out endogenous cysteines located near the L1 interface of GluN1. These results indicate that GluN1 and GluN2 ATDs form local heterodimers through the interactions in the L1-L1 interface and further demonstrate a dimer-of-heterodimer arrangement in GluN1/GluN2A and GluN1/GluN2B NMDA receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2066802493,"Class A G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute the largest family of transmembrane receptors in the human genome. Understanding the mechanisms which drove the evolution of such a large family would help understand the specificity of each GPCR sub-family with applications to drug design. To gain evolutionary information on class A GPCRs, we explored their sequence space by metric multidimensional scaling analysis (MDS). Three-dimensional mapping of human sequences shows a non-uniform distribution of GPCRs, organized in clusters that lay along four privileged directions. To interpret these directions, we projected supplementary sequences from different species onto the human space used as a reference. With this technique, we can easily monitor the evolutionary drift of several GPCR sub-families from cnidarians to humans. Results support a model of radiative evolution of class A GPCRs from a central node formed by peptide receptors. The privileged directions obtained from the MDS analysis are interpretable in terms of three main evolutionary pathways related to specific sequence determinants. The first pathway was initiated by a deletion in transmembrane helix 2 (TM2) and led to three sub-families by divergent evolution. The second pathway corresponds to the differentiation of the amine receptors. The third pathway corresponds to parallel evolution of several sub-families in relation with a covarion process involving proline residues in TM2 and TM5. As exemplified with GPCRs, the MDS projection technique is an important tool to compare orthologous sequence sets and to help decipher the mutational events that drove the evolution of protein families."
https://openalex.org/W2085846847,"Morphogen molecules form concentration gradients to provide spatial information to cells in a developing embryo. Precisely how cells decode such information to form patterns with sharp boundaries remains an open question. For example, it remains controversial whether the Drosophila morphogenetic protein Bicoid (Bcd) plays a transient or sustained role in activating its target genes to establish sharp expression boundaries during development.In this study, we describe a method to simultaneously detect Bcd and the nascent transcripts of its target genes in developing embryos. This method allows us to investigate the relationship between Bcd and the transcriptional status of individual copies of its target genes on distinct scales. We show that, on three scales analyzed concurrently--embryonic, nuclear and local, the actively-transcribing gene copies are associated with high Bcd concentrations. These results underscore the importance of Bcd as a sustained input for transcriptional decisions of individual copies of its target genes during development. We also show that the Bcd-dependent transcriptional decisions have a significantly higher noise than Bcd-dependent gene products, suggesting that, consistent with theoretical studies, time and/or space averaging reduces the noise of Bcd-activated transcriptional output. Finally, our analysis of an X-linked Bcd target gene reveals that Bcd-dependent transcription bursts at twice the frequency in males as in females, providing a mechanism for dosage compensation in early Drosophila embryos.Our study represents a first experimental uncovering of the actions of Bcd in controlling the actual transcriptional events while its positional information is decoded during development. It establishes a sustained role of Bcd in transcriptional decisions of individual copies of its target genes to generate sharp expression boundaries. It also provides an experimental evaluation of the effect of time and/or space averaging on Bcd-dependent transcriptional output, and establishes a dosage compensation mechanism in early Drosophila embryos."
https://openalex.org/W1967549486,"Bacteriochlorophylls (BChls) c, d, and e are the major chlorophylls in chlorosomes, which are the largest and one of the most efficient antennae produced by chlorophototrophic organisms. In the biosynthesis of these three BChls, a C-13(2)-methylcarboxyl group found in all other chlorophylls (Chls) must be removed. This reaction is postulated to be the first committed step in the synthesis of these BChls. Analyses of gene neighborhoods of (B)Chl biosynthesis genes and distribution patterns in organisms producing chlorosomes helped to identify a gene (bciC) that appeared to be a good candidate to produce the enzyme involved in this biochemical reaction. To confirm that this was the case, a deletion mutant of an open reading frame orthologous to bciC, CT1077, was constructed in Chlorobaculum tepidum, a genetically tractible green sulfur bacterium. The CT1077 deletion mutant was unable to synthesize BChl c but still synthesized BChl a and Chl a. The deletion mutant accumulated large amounts of various (bacterio)pheophorbides, all of which still had C-13(2)-methylcarboxyl groups. A C. tepidum strain in which CT1077 was replaced by an orthologous gene, Cabther_B0081 [corrected] from ""Candidatus Chloracidobacterium thermophilum"" was constructed. Although the product of Cabther_B0081 [corrected] was only 28% identical to the product of CT1077, this strain synthesized BChl c, BChl a, and Chl a in amounts similar to wild-type C. tepidum cells. To indicate their roles in the first committed step of BChl c, d, and e biosynthesis, open reading frames CT1077 and Cabther_B0081 [corrected] have been redesignated bciC. The potential mechanism by which BciC removes the C-13(2)-methylcarboxyl moiety of chlorophyllide a is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1974445460,"The hypothalamic melanocortin system--the melanocortin receptor of type 4 (MC4R) and its ligands: α-melanin-stimulating hormone (α-MSH, agonist, inducing hypophagia), and agouti-related protein (AgRP, antagonist, inducing hyperphagia)--is considered to play a central role in the control of food intake. We tested its implication in the mediation of the hunger-curbing effects of protein-enriched diets (PED) in mice. Whereas there was a 20% decrease in food intake in mice fed on the PED, compared to mice fed on an isocaloric starch-enriched diet, there was a paradoxical decrease in expression of the hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin gene, precursor of α-MSH, and increase in expression of the gene encoding AgRP. The hypophagia effect of PED took place in mice with invalidation of either MC4R or POMC, and was even strengthened in mice with ablation of the AgRP-expressing neurons. These data strongly suggest that the hypothalamic melanocortin system does not mediate the hunger-curbing effects induced by changes in the macronutrient composition of food. Rather, the role of this system might be to defend the body against the variations in food intake generated by the nutritional environment."
https://openalex.org/W1999345611,"Neuron polarization is essential for the formation of one axon and multiple dendrites, establishing the neuronal circuitry. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling promotes axon selection and elongation. Here we report in hippocampal neurons siRNA knockdown of the proline-rich inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (PIPP), which degrades PI3K-generated PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3), results in multiple hyperelongated axons consistent with a polarization defect. We identify collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2), which regulates axon selection by promoting WAVE1 delivery via Kinesin-1 motors to the axon growth cone, as a PIPP-interacting protein by Y2H screening, direct binding studies, and coimmunoprecipitation of an endogenous PIPP, CRMP2, and Kinesin-1 complex from brain lysates. The C-terminal growth cone-targeting domain of PIPP facilitates its interaction with CRMP2. PIPP growth cone localization is CRMP2-dependent. PIPP knockdown in PC12 cells promotes neurite elongation, WAVE1 and Kinesin-1 growth cone localization, whereas knockdown of CRMP2 exhibits the opposite phenotype, with shorter neurites and decreased WAVE1/Kinesin-1 at the growth cone. In contrast, CRMP2 overexpression promotes neurite elongation, a phenotype rescued by full-length PIPP, or expression of the CRMP2-binding PIPP domain. Therefore this study identifies PIPP and CRMP2 exert opposing roles in promoting axon selection and neurite elongation and the complex between these proteins serves to regulate the localization of effectors that promote neurite extension."
https://openalex.org/W2092002669,"The protein kinase C (PKC) family of Ca(2+) and/or lipid-activated serine-threonine protein kinases is implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity and insulin resistance. We recently reported that protein kinase Cβ (PKCβ), a calcium-, diacylglycerol-, and phospholipid-dependent kinase, is critical for maintaining whole body triglyceride homeostasis. We now report that PKCβ deficiency has profound effects on murine hepatic cholesterol metabolism, including hypersensitivity to diet-induced gallstone formation. The incidence of gallstones increased from 9% in control mice to 95% in PKCβ(-/-) mice. Gallstone formation in the mutant mice was accompanied by hyposecretion of bile acids with no alteration in fecal bile acid excretion, increased biliary cholesterol saturation and hydrophobicity indices, as well as hepatic p42/44(MAPK) activation, all of which enhance susceptibility to gallstone formation. Lithogenic diet-fed PKCβ(-/-) mice also displayed decreased expression of hepatic cholesterol-7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and sterol 12α-hydroxylase (CYP8b1). Finally, feeding a modified lithogenic diet supplemented with milk fat, instead of cocoa butter, both increased the severity of and shortened the interval for gallstone formation in PKCβ(-/-) mice and was associated with dramatic increases in cholesterol saturation and hydrophobicity indices. Taken together, the findings reveal a hitherto unrecognized role of PKCβ in fine tuning diet-induced cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis, thus identifying PKCβ as a major physiological regulator of both triglyceride and cholesterol homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2013012885,"Background Induction of neovascularization by releasing therapeutic growth factors is a promising application of cell-based gene therapy to treat ischemia-related problems. In the present study, we have developed a new strategy based on nucleofection with alternative solution and cuvette to promote collateral growth and re-establishment of circulation in ischemic limbs using double transplantation of gene nucleofected primary cultures of fibroblasts, which were isolated from rat receiving such therapy. Methods and Results Rat dermal fibroblasts were nucleofected ex vivo to release bFGF or VEGF165 in a hindlimb ischemia model in vivo. After femoral artery ligation, gene-modified cells were injected intramuscularly. One week post injection, local confined plasmid expression and transient distributions of the plasmids in other organs were detected by quantitative PCR. Quantitative micro-CT analyses showed improvements of vascularization in the ischemic zone (No. of collateral vessels via micro CT: 6.8±2.3 vs. 10.1±2.6; p<0.05). Moreover, improved collateral proliferation (BrdU incorporation: 0.48±0.05 vs. 0.57±0.05; p<0.05) and increase in blood perfusion (microspheres ratio: gastrocnemius: 0.41±0.10 vs. 0.50±0.11; p<0.05; soleus ratio: soleus: 0.42±0.08 vs. 0.60±0.08; p<0.01) in the lower hindlimb were also observed. Conclusions These results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of double transplantation of gene nucleofected primary fibroblasts in producing growth factors and promoting the formation of collateral circulation in ischemic hindlimb, suggesting that isolation and preparation of gene nucleofected cells from individual accepting gene therapy may be an alternative strategy for treating limb ischemia related diseases."

We used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments to analyze the steady state turnover of the immobile pool of green fluorescent protein-labeled NCAM180, the largest postsynaptically accumulating isoform of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). We show that there is a continuous flux of NCAM180 to the postsynaptic membrane from nonsynaptic regions of dendrites by diffusion. In the postsynaptic membrane, the newly delivered NCAM180 slowly intermixes with the immobilized pool of NCAM180. Preferential immobilization and accumulation of NCAM180 in the postsynaptic membrane is reduced after disruption of the association of NCAM180 with the spectrin cytoskeleton and in the absence of the homophilic interactions of NCAM180 in synapses.

In the present study, we used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to analyze the turnover of green fluorescent protein-labeled NCAM (NCAM180GFP) in the postsynaptic membrane of cultured hippocampal neurons. Our data indicate that at the steady state there is a continuous flux of NCAM180GFP to the postsynaptic membrane from the extrasynaptic regions via diffusion and that this newly delivered NCAM180GFP slowly intermixes with the immobilized pool of postsynaptic NCAM180GFP. The postsynaptic spectrin cytoskeleton and homophilic interactions of NCAM regulate immobilization and overall levels of NCAM180GFP in the postsynaptic membrane but do not significantly affect the diffusion of NCAM180GFP to the postsynaptic site. We propose that flux of NCAM180 from the extrasynaptic membrane is required for the homeostatic refreshment of the synaptic pool of NCAM180. Cultures of hippocampal neurons were prepared from 1–3-day-old C57BL/6J or NCAM-deficient (NCAM−/−) mice from homozygous breeding pairs and maintained on glass coverslips as described (29Westphal D.

NCAM−/− mice were provided by Harold Cremer (30Cremer H. Lange R. Christoph A. Plomann M. Vopper G. Roes J. Brown R. Baldwin S. Kraemer P. Scheff S. Barthels D. Rajewsky K. Wille W.

All of the experiments were conducted in accordance with the German and European Community laws on protection of experimental animals, and all of the procedures used were approved by the responsible committee of the State of Hamburg. For time lapse video recordings, the cells were maintained in Corning dishes (35 mm in diameter) with glass bottoms (MatTek Corporation, Ashland, MA). Hippocampal neurons were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Synapses were labeled by incubating cultures for 90 s in modified Tyrode solution containing 47 mm KCl and 10 μm FM4-64 (Invitrogen). Latrunculin A (5 μm; Biomol, Hamburg, Germany) was applied for 2 h (31Allison D.W. Chervin A.S. Gelfand V.I. Craig A.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4545-4554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dishes were transferred to the CO2 incubator (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) of the confocal laser scanning microscope for recording at 35 °C and 5% CO2. Transfected hippocampal neurons were imaged on the LSM510 laser scanning microscope (Zeiss). A high numerical aperture oil immersion objective (×40, 1.4 NA) was used to maximize the collection of the emitted fluorescent light. During image acquisition, the power of the 15-milliwatt argon laser (with the excitation wavelength of 488 nm) was minimized to reduce photodamage to cells and photobleaching of the GFP tag. The adjustable confocal aperture was completely opened to increase the fluorescence signal and to increase the depth of field so that minor fluctuations in the focus during image acquisition would not erroneously contribute to the signal. Photobleaching and image acquisition were performed automatically using the time series program of the LSM510 software. Before photobleaching, several images of the area of interest were acquired to record base-line fluorescence intensity. For analysis, the average pixel intensity of the photobleached region of the neurite for each time point before and after photobleaching was measured from the original stored images using LSM510 software. The background values measured near the bleached region were subtracted. To predict the behavior of NCAM180GFP molecules in the membrane, we defined F, B, and G to be, respectively, the number of free (bleached), bound (bleached), and green fluorescent molecules normalized by the total number. The green molecules may be free or bound. If a be the rate of diffusion in the membrane, Kb is the rate of binding to the scaffold proteins, and Kd is the dissociation rate from the scaffold, then the kinetics can be described by the following system of ordinary differential equations,dFdt=-(a+Kb)F+KdBEq. 1 dBdt=KbF-KdBEq. 2 dGdt=aFEq. 3 where t is time measured in seconds. The equilibrium between free and bound molecules occurs at a fraction f = Kd/(Kb + Kd) of molecules unbound. Assuming binding is at steady state at the time of photobleaching, the initial conditions are F(0) = f, B(0) = 1 − f, G(0) = 0, and the solution of the above system of equations isG(t)=1-(θ-(a+λ)+2fa)e-(a+λ+θ)t/22θ-(θ+(a+λ)-2fa)e-(a+λ-θ)t/22θEq. 4 where λ = Kb + Kd and whereθ=(a+λ)2-4aλf.Eq. 5 Note that the case in which only diffusion acts can be found by setting Kb = 0 and taking the limit as Kd → 0, in which case the concentration of green molecules reduces to G(t) = 1 − e−at. For a given experiment, the solution (Equation 4) can be fitted to data to obtain estimates of a, f, and θ. The ratio Kd/Kb can then be estimated as f/(1 − f). To test whether the inclusion of binding and dissociation improved the model fit, we used the lack-of-fit test with degrees of freedom (2, n − 3) for each data set from each individual time lapse experiment, where n is the sample size. For 26 of 27 data sets, the resulting p value was <10−6, indicating that the model with binding and diffusion was statistically superior to the model with only diffusion. To visualize the behavior of NCAM180 in live neurons, cultured hippocampal neurons were transfected with NCAM180 tagged with the GFP inserted between its transmembrane and second fibronectin type III domains to ensure that the tag does not interfere with the interactions mediated by the extracellular and intracellular domains of NCAM (12Sytnyk V. Leshchyns'ka I. Delling M. Dityateva G. Dityatev A. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 649-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In neurons from early postnatal mice maintained for 5 days in vitro, NCAM180GFP was broadly expressed along neurites and in somata (Fig. 1). This distribution was similar to the distribution of endogenous NCAM detected with NCAM antibodies (not shown). NCAM180GFP accumulated at sites of contacts between neurons, visualized as intersections between neurites of NCAM180GFP transfected neurons (Fig. 1), in accordance with previous reports for endogenous NCAM (12Sytnyk V.

Schachner M. Cell Tissue Res. 1987; 250: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Next, we asked whether there is an exchange in NCAM180GFP molecules between interneuronal contacts and neighboring regions of neurites. To analyze this, FRAP experiments were performed. Clusters of NCAM180GFP at intersections of transfected neurites were irreversibly photobleached with a high intensity laser beam of 488-nm wavelength. Time lapse imaging showed that NCAM180GFP fluorescence rapidly recovered at the contact sites (Fig. 1). NCAM180GFP fluorescence intensity at contact sites recovered not only to the basal levels of the fluorescence intensity at regions surrounding the contact but increased above this level so that the preferential accumulation of NCAM180GFP fluorescence at the contact site was restored (Fig. 1). One possible explanation for this observation is that the preferential increase in fluorescence levels at contacts is due to the superposition of the fluorescence signals in neurites at the point of the intersection. However, this preferential accumulation of fluorescence was only observed at contacts formed by neurons transfected with NCAM180GFP but not at contacts formed by neurons transfected with GFP, thus arguing against this possibility (Fig. 1). To exclude this possibility in a more direct manner, further analysis was performed on synaptic contacts in which contact sites in live neurons were visualized using markers of synaptic vesicles (see below). In mature neurons, NCAM180 accumulates postsynaptically (25Sytnyk V. Leshchyns'ka I. Nikonenko A.G. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 1071-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 26Persohn E. Pollerberg G.E. Schachner M. J. Comp. Neurol. 1989; 288: 92-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). To identify postsynaptic regions in NCAM180GFP transfected neurons, synaptic boutons of hippocampal neurons maintained in culture for 2 weeks were loaded with the lipophilic dye FM4-64 by a brief incubation in high K+ solution (47 mm K+, 90 s) in the presence of the dye (12Sytnyk V.

PLoS One. 2010; 5: e12018Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). NCAM180GFP accumulations in dendrites apposed to FM4-64 clusters were then identified as postsynaptic (Fig. 2A). Preferential accumulation of NCAM180 in the postsynaptic membrane was estimated by analyzing the ratio of NCAM180GFP fluorescence level in the postsynaptic membrane to the NCAM180GFP fluorescence levels in the neighboring nonsynaptic regions. This analysis showed that the level of NCAM180GFP was approximately two times higher in the postsynaptic membrane when compared with nonsynaptic regions (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3B; see also Fig. 7).FIGURE 7Preferential accumulation of NCAM180GFP in the postsynaptic membrane is reduced in the absence of the homophilic interactions of NCAM180GFP or its association with the spectrin cytoskeleton.

Note that NCAM180GFP accumulates postsynaptically in NCAM+/+ neurons and NCAM+/+ neurons co-transfected with βI3–5 (NCAMpostsynaptic/NCAMnonsynaptic = ∼2).

Under these conditions, NCAM180GFP fluorescence could be specifically attributed to the postsynaptic transfected neuron, whereas FM4-64-positive boutons belonged to NCAM180GFP negative nontransfected neurons. The exchange of NCAM180GFP molecules between the postsynaptic membrane and nonsynaptic regions of dendrites was then analyzed in FRAP experiments. In each experiment, a 3-μm-long region of a dendritic surface membrane of the NCAM180GFP transfected neuron apposed to a FM4-64 loaded synaptic bouton was irreversibly photobleached with a high intensity laser beam, and recovery of NCAM180GFP fluorescence in the photobleached area was monitored over time (Fig. 2B). Time lapse recordings showed that, similarly to contacts in immature neurons, NCAM180GFP fluorescence recovered in the photobleached area, indicating that NCAM180GFP moves into the postsynaptic membrane from nonsynaptic regions. The recovery occurred in a gradual fashion without any obvious steep quantal increases in fluorescence (Fig. 2B), which would be characteristic of vesicular delivery of NCAM180GFP. The latter suggested that NCAM180GFP entered the postsynaptic membrane by diffusion. NCAM180GFP fluorescence recovery occurred in a nonuniform manner with the strongest recovery observed in the center of the synaptic contacts when compared with the adjacent segments of the dendrite (Fig. 2B). For comparison, in each experiment NCAM180GFP fluorescence recovery after photobleaching was also analyzed in the regions located on the same dendrite but 5–10 μm away from the postsynaptic region (Fig. 2). These dendritic regions were chosen to be not apposed to FM4-64 loaded synaptic boutons and were thus identified as nonsynaptic. Similarly to postsynaptic regions, NCAM180GFP fluorescence rapidly recovered in the photobleached nonsynaptic regions (Fig. 2B). In contrast to the postsynaptic regions, NCAM180GFP fluorescence in nonsynaptic segments recovered uniformly all over the bleached area (Fig. 2B). In FRAP experiments, the postphotobleaching recovery level is often considered as a measure of the freely diffusible pool of molecules, which can be assumed to be the same or lower in the postsynaptic membrane when compared with extrasynaptic regions. However, quantification of FRAP experiments showed that in a typical synaptic contact, postsynaptic NCAM180GFP fluorescence recovered above the levels observed in nonsynaptic regions within several minutes after photobleaching (Fig. 3B). The initial levels of NCAM180GFP fluorescence were approximately two times higher in the postsynaptic membrane versus the nonsynaptic membrane (Fig. 3B). To take into account these differences in expression levels, NCAM180GFP levels were normalized to the prebleach levels in the region analyzed. A comparison of the normalized curves showed that NCAM180GFP fluorescence recovery was slower in postsynaptic versus nonsynaptic regions (Fig. 3C). Altogether, these differences in postphotobleaching recovery behavior suggested that the recovery of NCAM180GFP fluorescence was not determined only by the freely diffusible pool of NCAM180GFP. A possible explanation for the reaccumulation of NCAM180GFP fluorescence in the postsynaptic membrane in FRAP experiments is that NCAM180GFP not only diffuses to the postsynaptic regions from the nonsynaptic regions but also binds to the synaptic scaffold during the time lapse recordings and substitutes immobilized NCAM180GFP, which was photobleached. To analyze this possibility, we developed a mathematical model to predict the behavior of NCAM180GFP in the membrane. NCAM180 has been shown to bind via the intracellular domain to spectrin molecules (25Sytnyk V. Leshchyns'ka I. Nikonenko A.G. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 1071-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 35Leshchyns'ka I. Sytnyk V. Morrow J.S. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 625-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and is expected to interact via the extracellular domain with extracellular domains of other adhesion molecules in the synaptic cleft (Fig. 3A). Hence, a model describing the behavior of NCAM180GFP as a function of rates of diffusion and binding and dissociation from the synaptic scaffold proteins including postsynaptic spectrin and NCAM molecules on adjacent presynaptic membrane was developed. This model was then used to fit the normalized experimental data. A comparison with the model considering only the diffusion of NCAM180 showed that the model considering binding of NCAM180 to the synaptic scaffold provided a statistically significantly better fit of the experimental recovery curves. This analysis showed that the diffusion rate tended to be lower (although statistically not significantly) in the postsynaptic membrane when compared with the nonsynaptic regions (Table 1). A significant proportion of NCAM180GFP was found in the immobile pool both in synaptic and nonsynaptic regions. The immobile pool of NCAM180GFP was, however, predicted to be significantly increased up to 59 ± 2.7% of the total pool of NCAM180GFP in the postsynaptic membrane versus 48 ± 1.9% of the total pool of NCAM180GFP in the nonsynaptic membrane. To characterize the interactions of NCAM180GFP with the scaffold molecules, the ratio of the dissociation rate from the scaffold to the rate of binding to the scaffold (Kd/Kb) was analyzed using the model parameters. The predicted Kd/Kb was significantly lower in postsynaptic (0.82 ± 0.11) versus nonsynaptic (1.16 ± 0.1) regions (Table 1), suggesting enhanced binding to and lower dissociation of NCAM180 from the molecular scaffolds in synapses.TABLE 1Diffusion rates and immobilization parameters for NCAM180GFP in the postsynaptic membraneTreatmentDiffusion rate, 10−2Kd/KbImmobile poolPostsynapticNonsynapticPostsynapticNonsynapticPostsynapticNonsynapticNone3.9 ± 0.54.5 ± 0.40.82 ± 0.11ap < 0.05, t test.1.16 ± 0.1059 ± 2.7%ap < 0.05, t test.48 ± 1.9%NCAM−/−4.5 ± 0.45.8 ± 0.60.99 ± 0.071.02 ± 0.1048 ± 4.0%52 ± 2.3%βI2–33.4 ± 0.34.9 ± 0.81.16 ± 0.101.17 ± 0.2248 ± 1.7%52 ± 3.5%βI3–53.4 ± 0.34.6 ± 0.50.43 ± 0.06ap < 0.05, t test.0.82 ± 0.1371 ± 3.0%ap < 0.05, t test.58 ± 3.7%Latrunculin3.7 ± 0.43.9 ± 0.61.084 ± 0.111.34 ± 0.1750 ± 2.4%45 ± 3.2%a p < 0.05, t test. Open table in a new tab Next, we analyzed the role of the homophilic interactions of NCAM180 for its immobilization in the postsynaptic membrane by analyzing the postphotobleaching recovery of NCAM180GFP fluorescence in the postsynaptic membrane in the absence of interactions of the postsynaptic NCAM180GFP with NCAM molecules in the presynaptic membrane (Fig. 4A). In these experiments, neurons from NCAM-deficient (NCAM−/−) mice (30Cremer H. Lange R. Christoph A. Plomann M. Vopper G. Roes J. Brown R. Baldwin S. Kraemer P. Scheff S. Barthels D. Rajewsky K. Wille W. Nature. 1994; 367: 455-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar) were maintained in culture and transfected with NCAM180GFP. Transfection conditions were chosen to obtain very low transfection efficiency, so that only 1% or less of neurons in culture expressed NCAM180GFP. Most of the synaptic contacts received by NCAM180GFP transfected neurons were formed by axons from nontransfected NCAM negative neurons, implying that postsynaptic NCAM180GFP was not engaged in the homophilic interactions with presynaptic NCAM (Fig. 4A). Analysis of such synapses showed that preferential accumulation of NCAM180GFP in the postsynaptic membrane was reduced by ∼50% in the absence of the homophilic interactions of NCAM180GFP (compare prebleach levels in Fig. 4; see also Fig. 7). Analysis of the FRAP curves with the model equations showed that Kd/Kb in postsynaptic regions was increased, and the immobile pool of NCAM180GFP was reduced when compared with wild-type neurons reaching the levels observed nonsynaptically (Fig. 4 and Table 1). The diffusion rate was not changed compared with diffusion rate in postsynaptic regions in wild-type neurons (Table 1). Hence, whereas the flux of the extrasynaptic NCAM180 to the postsynaptic regions was not changed, immobilization of NCAM180GFP in the postsynaptic membrane was reduced in the absence of homophilic interactions. Because NCAM180 binds to the postsynaptic spectrin scaffold (25Sytnyk V. Leshchyns'ka I. Nikonenko A.G. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 1071-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), we also analyzed whether this interaction plays a role in immobilization of NCAM180 in the postsynaptic membrane. Two experiments were performed. First, we performed FRAP experiments in which this interaction was disrupted by co-transfecting wild-type hippocampal neurons with the spectrin fragment βI2–3 containing the NCAM binding site and disrupting the association between NCAM180 and endogenous spectrin (3"

Transcriptomes of LGN tissue from two independently generated Chrnb2-/- mutants and from wildtype mice were obtained at postnatal day 4 (P4), during the normal period of segregation of eye-specific afferents to the LGN. Microarray analysis reveals reduced expression of genes located on the cell membrane or in extracellular space, and of genes active in cell adhesion and calcium signaling. In particular, mRNA for cadherin 1 (Cdh1), a known axon growth regulator, is reduced to nearly undetectable levels in the LGN of P4 mutant mice and Lypd2 mRNA is similarly suppressed. Similar analysis of retinal tissue shows increased expression of crumbs 1 (Crb1) and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 21 (Ccl21) mRNAs in Chrnb2-/- mutant animals. Mutations in these genes are associated with retinal neuronal degeneration. The retinas of Chrnb2-/- mutants are normal in appearance, but the increased expression of these genes may also be involved in the abnormal projection patterns of RGC to the LGN. These data may provide the tools to distinguish the interplay between neural activity and molecular expression. Finally, comparison of the transcriptomes of the two different Chrnb2-/- mutant strains reveals the effects of genetic background upon gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1998390149,"Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is considered to be a necessary, but not sufficient, causal agent of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). All forms of KS are characterized by the proliferation of spindle-shaped cells, and most (>90%) spindle cells from KS lesions are latently infected with KSHV. During KSHV latency, only a few viral genes are expressed. Among those latent genes, the ORF 73 gene encodes the latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA), which is critical for the establishment and maintenance of the latent KSHV infection. Much evidence suggests that many cytokines can increase the frequency and aggressiveness of KS. In this study, a microarray analysis of KS and normal tissues revealed that multiple cytokines and cytokine receptors are regulated by KSHV latent infection. Of special interest, IL-22R1 transcript level was found to be down-regulated in the KS tissue. To study the possible regulation of IL-22R1 by LANA, the IL-22R1 promoter was constructed and found to contain a LANA-binding site (LBS). LANA was demonstrated to down-regulate IL-22R1 expression via direct binding to the LBS located within the IL-22R1 promoter region. Furthermore, KSHV latently infected cells showed an impaired response to IL-22 stimulation. These results suggest that LANA can regulate host factor expression by directly binding to a cis-acting element within the factor's promoter to benefit latent viral infection and suppression of the antiviral immune response."

In this study, epitope-tagged wild-type human PAR(1) (hPAR(1)) and a panel of N-linked glycosylation-deficient mutant receptors were permanently expressed in epithelial cells (Kirsten murine sarcoma virus-transformed rat kidney cells and CHO cells). We have analyzed the role of N-linked glycosylation in regulating proteinase activation/disarming and cell global expression of hPAR(1). We reported for the first time that glycosylation in the N terminus of hPAR(1) downstream of the tethered ligand (especially Asn(75)) governs receptor disarming to trypsin, thermolysin, and the neutrophil proteinases elastase and proteinase 3 but not cathepsin G. In addition, hPAR(1) is heavily N-linked glycosylated and sialylated in epithelial cell lines, and glycosylation occurs at all five consensus sites, namely, Asn(35), Asn(62), Asn(75), Asn(250), and Asn(259). Removing these N-linked glycosylation sequons affected hPAR(1) cell surface expression to varying degrees, and N-linked glycosylation at extracellular loop 2 (especially Asn(250)) of hPAR(1) is essential for optimal receptor cell surface expression and receptor stability."
https://openalex.org/W1986005890,"No randomized control trial to date has studied the use of cervical spine management strategies in cases of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) at risk for cervical spine instability solely due to damaged ligaments. A computer algorithm is used to decide between four cervical spine management strategies. A model assumption is that the emergency room evaluation shows no spinal deficit and a computerized tomogram of the cervical spine excludes the possibility of fracture of cervical vertebrae. The study's goal is to determine cervical spine management strategies that maximize brain injury functional survival while minimizing quadriplegia.The severity of TBI is categorized as unstable, high risk and stable based on intracranial hypertension, hypoxemia, hypotension, early ventilator associated pneumonia, admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and age. Complications resulting from cervical spine management are simulated using three decision trees. Each case starts with an amount of primary and secondary brain injury and ends as a functional survivor, severely brain injured, quadriplegic or dead. Cervical spine instability is studied with one-way and two-way sensitivity analyses providing rankings of cervical spine management strategies for probabilities of management complications based on QALYs. Early collar removal received more QALYs than the alternative strategies in most arrangements of these comparisons. A limitation of the model is the absence of testing against an independent data set.When clinical logic and components of cervical spine management are systematically altered, changes that improve health outcomes are identified. In the absence of controlled clinical studies, the results of this comparative computer assessment show that early collar removal is preferred over a wide range of realistic inputs for this subset of traumatic brain injury. Future research is needed on identifying factors in projecting awakening from coma and the role of delirium in these cases."
