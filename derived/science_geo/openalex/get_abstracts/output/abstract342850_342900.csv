https://openalex.org/W2064455647,Toxicity in sponges and holothurians is inversely related to latitude and may reach 100 percent for holothurians in high-diversity coral reefs. Evidence from approximately 700 experiments and from underwater observations suggests that predation by fish has resulted in natural selection for noxious and toxic chemical compounds in species within these taxa.
https://openalex.org/W2047990877,The ] Kungs have lived in the Kalahari Desert of South Africa by hunting and gathering since the Pleistocene Age. The role of women in the settled ] Kung has aroused considerable interest among social scientists. ] Kung women belonging to the nomadic bands enjoy higher status more authonomy and greater ability to directly influence group decisions than to sedentary ] Kung women. One reason for this may be that the nomadic women help gather the food for the band. Sex role development is different too. Nomadic living discourages the development of distinct games for boys and girls. In addition to promoting sexual egalitarianism this discourages aggression. The settled ] Kung seem to have lost a natural check on their fertility rates. Medical effects of the altered diet and way of life of the sedentary ] Kung have not yet been well established. Population growth among the sedentary group results from both a decrease in the age of menarche and a decrease in the average time between births.

The fingers, 6 millimeters in diamneter and 24 centimeters long, were photographed below the salinity maximum of the outflow, in an interface 22 centimeters thick where temperature and salinity decreased O. 15 degrees C and 0.03 per mil, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W3205606851,"The world's inhabitants, including Scientists, live primarily in the Northern Hemisphere. It is quite natural to be concerned about events that occur close to home and neglect faraway events. Hence, it is not surprising that so little attention has been given to the Southern Hemisphere. Evidence for global cooling has been based, in large part, on a severe cooling trend at high northern latitudes. This article points out that the Northern Hemisphere cooling trend appears to be out of phase with a warming trend at high latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere. The data are scanty. We cannot be sure that these temperature fluctuations are not the result of natural causes. However, it seems most likely that human activity has already significantly perturbed the atmospheric weather system. The effect of particulate matter pollution should be most severe in the highly populated and industrialized Northern Hemisphere. Because of the rapid diffusion of CO2 molecules within the atmosphere, both hemispheres will be subject to warming due to the atmospheric (greenhouse) effect as the CO2 content of the atmosphere builds up from the combustion of fossil fuels. Because of the differential effects of the two major sources of atmospheric pollution, the CO2 greenhouse effect warming trend should first become evident in the Southern Hemisphere. The socioeconomic and political consequences of climate change are profound. We need an early warning system such as would be provided by a more intensive international world weather watch, particularly at high northern and southern latitudes."

https://openalex.org/W2048020546,"The roles of photoperiodism and related light-dependent and hormonal processes in plants are not well understood. Rapid growth, aquatic habit, and adaptability to axenic culture make the Lemnaceae, or duckweeds, excellent material for investigating these topics and others in which highly defined conditions or the presence of organic substances are crucial. As a major example among several that are described, recent work with one species suggests a relation between some features of carbon dioxide flux and the photoperiodic timing mechanism, thus providing a system in which the biochemical basis of the latter may be explored."

https://openalex.org/W2048599586,"Calcite crystals extracted from marrow cavities of bones found in hominid-bearing breccias from Makapansgat and Swartkrans were studied for fossil tracks. The absence of the expected numbers of tracks in these and in calcites from Beds I and II, Olduvai Gorge, combined with the results of laboratory heating experiments, indicates that track annealing has occurred at ambient temperatures and precludes the widespread use of calcite for fission track dating."
