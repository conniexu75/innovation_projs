https://openalex.org/W1983774108,"Trever Bivona and colleagues identify the upregulation of the AXL kinase in human non–small cell lung cancer with acquired resistance to erlotinib. Inhibition of AXL restores sensitivity to erlotinib in in vitro and in vivo tumor models. The authors suggest AXL as a potential therapeutic target that may prevent or overcome acquired resistance in patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer. Human non–small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) with activating mutations in EGFR frequently respond to treatment with EGFR-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as erlotinib, but responses are not durable, as tumors acquire resistance. Secondary mutations in EGFR (such as T790M) or upregulation of the MET kinase are found in over 50% of resistant tumors. Here, we report increased activation of AXL and evidence for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in multiple in vitro and in vivo EGFR-mutant lung cancer models with acquired resistance to erlotinib in the absence of the EGFR p.Thr790Met alteration or MET activation. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of AXL restored sensitivity to erlotinib in these tumor models. Increased expression of AXL and, in some cases, of its ligand GAS6 was found in EGFR-mutant lung cancers obtained from individuals with acquired resistance to TKIs. These data identify AXL as a promising therapeutic target whose inhibition could prevent or overcome acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs in individuals with EGFR-mutant lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2157888653,"Single-molecule sequencing instruments can generate multikilobase sequences with the potential to greatly improve genome and transcriptome assembly. However, the error rates of single-molecule reads are high, which has limited their use thus far to resequencing bacteria. To address this limitation, we introduce a correction algorithm and assembly strategy that uses short, high-fidelity sequences to correct the error in single-molecule sequences. We demonstrate the utility of this approach on reads generated by a PacBio RS instrument from phage, prokaryotic and eukaryotic whole genomes, including the previously unsequenced genome of the parrot Melopsittacus undulatus, as well as for RNA-Seq reads of the corn (Zea mays) transcriptome. Our long-read correction achieves >99.9% base-call accuracy, leading to substantially better assemblies than current sequencing strategies: in the best example, the median contig size was quintupled relative to high-coverage, second-generation assemblies. Greater gains are predicted if read lengths continue to increase, including the prospect of single-contig bacterial chromosome assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2082682623,"Chambers et al. use a combination of small-molecule pathway inhibitors to rapidly differentiate human pluripotent stem cells into nociceptors, a type of sensory neuron. The conversion occurs about three-fold faster than during development, suggesting that pathway inhibition may offer a general approach for speeding up the generation of specific cell types in vitro. Considerable progress has been made in identifying signaling pathways that direct the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into specialized cell types, including neurons. However, differentiation of hPSCs with extrinsic factors is a slow, step-wise process, mimicking the protracted timing of human development. Using a small-molecule screen, we identified a combination of five small-molecule pathway inhibitors that yield hPSC-derived neurons at >75% efficiency within 10 d of differentiation. The resulting neurons express canonical markers and functional properties of human nociceptors, including tetrodotoxin (TTX)-resistant, SCN10A-dependent sodium currents and response to nociceptive stimuli such as ATP and capsaicin. Neuronal fate acquisition occurs about threefold faster than during in vivo development1, suggesting that use of small-molecule pathway inhibitors could become a general strategy for accelerating developmental timing in vitro. The quick and high-efficiency derivation of nociceptors offers unprecedented access to this medically relevant cell type for studies of human pain."

https://openalex.org/W2089210429,"The biological impact of Rho depends critically on the precise subcellular localization of its active, GTP-loaded form. This can potentially be determined by the balance between molecules that promote nucleotide exchange or GTP hydrolysis. However, how these activities may be coordinated is poorly understood. We now report a molecular pathway that achieves exactly this coordination at the epithelial zonula adherens. We identify an extramitotic activity of the centralspindlin complex, better understood as a cytokinetic regulator, which localizes to the interphase zonula adherens by interacting with the cadherin-associated protein, α-catenin. Centralspindlin recruits the RhoGEF, ECT2, to activate Rho and support junctional integrity through myosin IIA. Centralspindlin also inhibits the junctional localization of p190 B RhoGAP, which can inactivate Rho. Thus, a conserved molecular ensemble that governs Rho activation during cytokinesis is used in interphase cells to control the Rho GTPase cycle at the zonula adherens."
https://openalex.org/W2167244325,"Senescence is a stable cell cycle arrest program that contributes to tumor suppression, organismal aging and certain wound healing responses. During liver fibrosis, for example, hepatic stellate cells initially proliferate and secrete extracellular matrix components that produce fibrosis; however, these cells eventually senesce and are cleared by immune cells, including natural killer (NK) cells. Here, we examine how NK cells target senescent cells and assess the impact of this process on liver fibrosis. We show that granule exocytosis, but not death-receptor-mediated apoptosis, is required for NK-cell-mediated killing of senescent cells. This pathway bias is due to upregulation of the decoy death receptor, Dcr2, an established senescence marker that attenuates NK-mediated cell death. Accordingly, mice with defects in granule exocytosis accumulate senescent stellate cells and display more liver fibrosis in response to a fibrogenic agent. Our results thus provide new insights into the immune surveillance of senescent cells and reveal how granule exocytosis has a protective role against liver fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2011246380,"The multikilobase reads that can be produced by single-molecule sequencing technologies may span complex, repetitive genomic regions but have high error rates. Bashir et al. use these reads to organize contigs assembled from accurate, short-read data, facilitating the analysis of clinically important regions of an outbreak strain of cholera. Advances in DNA sequencing technology have improved our ability to characterize most genomic diversity. However, accurate resolution of large structural events is challenging because of the short read lengths of second-generation technologies. Third-generation sequencing technologies, which can yield longer multikilobase reads, have the potential to address limitations associated with genome assembly. Here we combine sequencing data from second- and third-generation DNA sequencing technologies to assemble the two-chromosome genome of a recent Haitian cholera outbreak strain into two nearly finished contigs at >99.9% accuracy. Complex regions with clinically relevant structure were completely resolved. In separate control assemblies on experimental and simulated data for the canonical N16961 cholera reference strain, we obtained 14 scaffolds of greater than 1 kb for the experimental data and 8 scaffolds of greater than 1 kb for the simulated data, which allowed us to correct several errors in contigs assembled from the short-read data alone. This work provides a blueprint for the next generation of rapid microbial identification and full-genome assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2048714464,"Unlike healthy adult tissues, cancers produce energy mainly by aerobic glycolysis instead of oxidative phosphorylation. This adaptation, called the Warburg effect, may be a feature of all dividing cells, both normal and cancerous, or it may be specific to cancers. It is not known whether, in a normally growing tissue during development, proliferating and postmitotic cells produce energy in fundamentally different ways. Here we show in the embryonic Xenopus retina in vivo, that dividing progenitor cells depend less on oxidative phosphorylation for ATP production than non-dividing differentiated cells, and instead use glycogen to fuel aerobic glycolysis. The transition from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation is connected to the cell differentiation process. Glycolysis is indispensable for progenitor proliferation and biosynthesis, even when it is not used for ATP production. These results suggest that the Warburg effect can be a feature of normal proliferation in vivo, and that the regulation of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation is critical for normal development."
https://openalex.org/W2089221377,"Activation of the TRPM8 ion channel in sensory nerve endings produces a sensation of pleasant coolness. Here we show that inflammatory mediators such as bradykinin and histamine inhibit TRPM8 in intact sensory nerves, but do not do so through conventional signalling pathways. The G-protein subunit Gα(q) instead binds to TRPM8 and when activated by a Gq-coupled receptor directly inhibits ion channel activity. Deletion of Gα(q) largely abolished inhibition of TRPM8, and inhibition was rescued by a Gα(q) chimaera whose ability to activate downstream signalling pathways was completely ablated. Activated Gα(q) protein, but not Gβγ, potently inhibits TRPM8 in excised patches. We conclude that Gα(q) pre-forms a complex with TRPM8 and inhibits activation of TRPM8, following activation of G-protein-coupled receptors, by a direct action. This signalling mechanism may underlie the abnormal cold sensation caused by inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2003818007,"Evan Eichler and colleagues explore the structural diversity and ancestral origins of the 17q21.31 inversion region. They find that complex duplication architectures have arisen independently on both inversion haplotypes and have recently reached high frequencies among Europeans, either through extraordinary genetic drift or selective sweeps. The 17q21.31 inversion polymorphism exists either as direct (H1) or inverted (H2) haplotypes with differential predispositions to disease and selection. We investigated its genetic diversity in 2,700 individuals, with an emphasis on African populations. We characterize eight structural haplotypes due to complex rearrangements that vary in size from 1.08–1.49 Mb and provide evidence for a 30-kb H1-H2 double recombination event. We show that recurrent partial duplications of the KANSL1 gene have occurred on both the H1 and H2 haplotypes and have risen to high frequency in European populations. We identify a likely ancestral H2 haplotype (H2′) lacking these duplications that is enriched among African hunter-gatherer groups yet essentially absent from West African populations. Whereas H1 and H2 segmental duplications arose independently and before human migration out of Africa, they have reached high frequencies recently among Europeans, either because of extraordinary genetic drift or selective sweeps."
https://openalex.org/W2068065185,"A lack of expression of miR-143 and miR-145 has been demonstrated to be a frequent feature of colorectal tumors. Activating KRAS mutations have been reported in 30-60% of colorectal cancers and an inverse correlation between Kras and miR-143/145 expression has been observed. Previously, we have demonstrated that oncogenic Kras leads to repression of the miR-143/145 cluster in pancreatic cancer and is dependent on the Ras responsive element (RRE) binding protein (RREB1), which negatively regulates miR-143/145 expression. In the present study, we have found that RREB1 is overexpressed in colorectal adenocarcinoma tumors and cell lines, and the expression of the miR-143/145 primary transcript is inversely related to RREB1 expression. In colorectal cancer cell lines, the miR-143/145 cluster is repressed by RREB1 downstream of constitutively active KRAS. RREB1 is activated by the MAPK pathway and negatively represses the miR-143/145 promoter through interaction with two RREs. In addition, overexpression of miR-143 or miR-145 in HCT116 cells abrogates signaling through the MAPK, PI3K and JNK pathways by downregulation of both KRAS and RREB1 in addition to downregulation of a cohort of genes in the MAPK signaling cascade. These results establish a complex network of regulation through which the miR-143/145 cluster is able to modulate KRAS signaling in colorectal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2054808321,"N-BAR-domain-containing proteins regulate membrane dynamics, as they stabilize curved membrane topologies, but whether they primarily sense or generate curvature has remained unclear. Galic, Meyer and colleagues now report that N-BAR proteins accumulate at highly curved membrane areas. Many of the more than 20 mammalian proteins with N-BAR domains1,2 control cell architecture3 and endocytosis4,5 by associating with curved sections of the plasma membrane6. It is not well understood whether N-BAR proteins are recruited directly by processes that mechanically curve the plasma membrane or indirectly by plasma-membrane-associated adaptor proteins that recruit proteins with N-BAR domains that then induce membrane curvature. Here, we show that externally induced inward deformation of the plasma membrane by cone-shaped nanostructures (nanocones) and internally induced inward deformation by contracting actin cables both trigger recruitment of isolated N-BAR domains to the curved plasma membrane. Markedly, live-cell imaging in adherent cells showed selective recruitment of full-length N-BAR proteins and isolated N-BAR domains to plasma membrane sub-regions above nanocone stripes. Electron microscopy confirmed that N-BAR domains are recruited to local membrane sites curved by nanocones. We further showed that N-BAR domains are periodically recruited to curved plasma membrane sites during local lamellipodia retraction in the front of migrating cells. Recruitment required myosin-II-generated force applied to plasma-membrane-connected actin cables. Together, our results show that N-BAR domains can be directly recruited to the plasma membrane by external push or internal pull forces that locally curve the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2026114862,"Steven McCarroll and colleagues use a population genetics approach to identify nine different structural forms of the 17q21.31 inversion region. They show that duplications have arisen independently on both ancestral forms of the inversion and have reached high frequencies in Europeans. Structurally complex genomic regions are not yet well understood. One such locus, human chromosome 17q21.31, contains a megabase-long inversion polymorphism1, many uncharacterized copy-number variations (CNVs) and markers that associate with female fertility1, female meiotic recombination1,2,3 and neurological disease4,5. Additionally, the inverted H2 form of 17q21.31 seems to be positively selected in Europeans1. We developed a population genetics approach to analyze complex genome structures and identified nine segregating structural forms of 17q21.31. Both the H1 and H2 forms of the 17q21.31 inversion polymorphism contain independently derived, partial duplications of the KANSL1 gene; these duplications, which produce novel KANSL1 transcripts, have both recently risen to high allele frequencies (26% and 19%) in Europeans. An older H2 form lacking such a duplication is present at low frequency in European and central African hunter-gatherer populations. We further show that complex genome structures can be analyzed by imputation from SNPs."
https://openalex.org/W1975916185,"The female hormone progesterone (P4) promotes the expansion of stem-like cancer cells in estrogen receptor (ER)- and progesterone receptor (PR)-positive breast tumors. The expanded tumor cells lose expression of ER and PR, express the tumor-initiating marker CD44, the progenitor marker cytokeratin 5 (CK5) and are more resistant to standard endocrine and chemotherapies. The mechanisms underlying this hormone-stimulated reprogramming have remained largely unknown. In the present study, we investigated the role of microRNAs in progestin-mediated expansion of this dedifferentiated tumor cell population. We demonstrate that P4 rapidly downregulates miR-29 family members, particularly in the CD44+ cell population. Downregulation of miR-29 members potentiates the expansion of CK5+ and CD44+ cells in response to progestins, and results in increased stem-like properties in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate that miR-29 directly targets Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), a transcription factor required for the reprogramming of differentiated cells to pluripotent stem cells, and for the maintenance of breast cancer stem cells. These results reveal a novel mechanism, whereby progestins increase the stem cell-like population in hormone-responsive breast cancers, by decreasing miR-29 to augment PR-mediated upregulation of KLF4. Elucidating the mechanisms whereby hormones mediate the expansion of stem-like cells furthers our understanding of the progression of hormone-responsive breast cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2055107424,"Chronic inflammation involving activated microglia and astroglia is becoming a hallmark of many human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders. Although NF-κB is a multifunctional transcription factor, it is an important target for controlling inflammation as the transcription of many proinflammatory molecules depends on the activation of NF-κB. Here, we have undertaken a novel approach to attenuate NF-κB activation and associated inflammation in activated glial cells. RNS60 is a 0.9% saline solution containing charge-stabilized nanostructures that are generated by subjecting normal saline to Taylor-Couette-Poiseuille (TCP) flow under elevated oxygen pressure. RNS60, but not normal saline, RNS10.3 (TCP-modified saline without excess oxygen), and PNS60 (saline containing excess oxygen without TCP modification) were found to inhibit the production of nitric oxide (NO) and the expression of inducible NO synthase in activated microglia. Similarly, RNS60 also inhibited the expression of inducible NO synthase in activated astroglia. Inhibition of NF-κB activation by RNS60 suggests that RNS60 exerts its anti-inflammatory effect through the inhibition of NF-κB. Interestingly, RNS60 induced the activation of type IA phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and Akt and rapidly up-regulated IκBα, a specific endogenous inhibitor of NF-κB. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase and Akt by either chemical inhibitors or dominant-negative mutants abrogated the RNS60-mediated up-regulation of IκBα. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RNS60 induced the activation of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) via the PI 3-kinase-Akt pathway and that RNS60 up-regulated IκBα via CREB. These results describe a novel anti-inflammatory property of RNS60 via type IA PI 3-kinase-Akt-CREB-mediated up-regulation of IκBα, which may be of therapeutic benefit in neurodegenerative disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2024160645,"Pannexin 1 (Panx1) is a channel-forming glycoprotein expressed in different cell types of mammalian skin. We examined the role of Panx1 in melanoma tumorigenesis and metastasis since qPCR and Western blots revealed that mouse melanocytes exhibited low levels of Panx1 while increased Panx1 expression was correlated with tumor cell aggressiveness in the isogenic melanoma cell lines (B16-F0, -F10, and -BL6). Panx1 shRNA knockdown (Panx1-KD) generated stable BL6 cell lines, with reduced dye uptake, that showed a marked increase in melanocyte-like cell characteristics including higher melanin production, decreased cell migration and enhanced formation of cellular projections. Western blotting and proteomic analyses using 2D-gel/mass spectroscopy identified vimentin and β-catenin as two of the markers of malignant melanoma that were down-regulated in Panx1-KD cells. Xenograft Panx1-KD cells grown within the chorioallantoic membrane of avian embryos developed tumors that were significantly smaller than controls. Mouse-Alu qPCR of the excised avian embryonic organs revealed that tumor metastasis to the liver was significantly reduced upon Panx1 knockdown. These data suggest that while Panx1 is present in skin melanocytes it is up-regulated during melanoma tumor progression, and tumorigenesis can be inhibited by the knockdown of Panx1 raising the possibility that Panx1 may be a viable target for the treatment of melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W2063858714,"Cancer arises as the consequence of mutations and epigenetic alterations that activate oncogenes and inactivate tumor suppressor genes. Through a genome-wide screen for methylated genes in colon neoplasms, we identified aberrantly methylated RET in colorectal cancer. RET, a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase and a receptor for the glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor family ligands, was one of the first oncogenes to be identified, and has been shown to be an oncogene in thyroid cancer and pheochromocytoma. However, unexpectedly, we found RET is methylated in 27% of colon adenomas and in 63% of colorectal cancers, and now provide evidence that RET has tumor suppressor activity in colon cancer. The aberrant methylation of RET correlates with decreased RET expression, whereas the restoration of RET in colorectal cancer cell lines results in apoptosis. Furthermore, in support of a tumor suppressor function of RET, mutant RET has also been found in primary colorectal cancer. We now show that these mutations inactivate RET, which is consistent with RET being a tumor suppressor gene in the colon. These findings suggest that the aberrant methylation of RET and the mutational inactivation of RET promote colorectal cancer formation, and that RET can serve as a tumor suppressor gene in the colon. Moreover, the increased frequency of methylated RET in colon cancers compared with adenomas suggests RET inactivation is involved in the progression of colon adenomas to cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2146814170,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) control crucial physiological processes and their dysfunction contributes to various human diseases, including cancer. The orphan GPCR GPR55 was identified and cloned more than a decade ago, but very little is known about its physio-pathological relevance. It has been recently shown that GPR55 controls the behavior of human cancer cell lines in culture and xenografts. However, the assessment of the actual role of this receptor in malignant transformation in vivo is hampered by the lack of studies on its functional impact in clinically-relevant models of cancer. Here we demonstrate that GPR55 drives mouse skin tumor development. Thus, GPR55-deficient mice were more resistant to DMBA/TPA-induced papilloma and carcinoma formation than their wild-type littermates. GPR55 exerted this pro-tumor effect primarily by conferring a proliferative advantage on cancer cells. In addition, GPR55 enhanced skin cancer cell anchorage-independent growth, invasiveness and tumorigenicity in vivo, suggesting that it promotes not only tumor development but also tumor aggressiveness. Finally, we observed that GPR55 is upregulated in human skin tumors and other human squamous cell carcinomas compared with the corresponding healthy tissues. Altogether, these findings reveal the pivotal importance of GPR55 in skin tumor development, and suggest that this receptor may be used as a new biomarker and therapeutic target in squamous cell carcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W2124692728,"Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States, while DNA-damaging ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation from the sun remains the major environmental risk factor. Reducing skin cancer incidence is becoming an urgent issue. The energy-sensing enzyme 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has a key role in the regulation of cellular lipid and protein metabolism in response to stimuli such as exercise and changes in fuel availability. However, the role of AMPK in the response of skin cells to UVB damage and in skin cancer prevention remains unknown. Here we show that AMPK activation is reduced in human and mouse squamous cell carcinoma as compared with normal skin, and by UVB irradiation, suggesting that AMPK is a tumor suppressor. At the molecular level, AMPK deletion reduced the expression of the DNA repair protein xeroderma pigmentosum C (XPC) and UVB-induced DNA repair. AMPK activation by its activators AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside) and metformin (N′,N′-dimethylbiguanide), the most widely used antidiabetic drug, increased the expression of XPC and UVB-induced DNA repair in mouse skin, normal human epidermal keratinocytes, and AMPK wild-type (WT) cells but not in AMPK-deficient cells, indicating an AMPK-dependent mechanism. Topical treatment with AICAR and metformin not only delayed onset of UVB-induced skin tumorigenesis but also reduced tumor multiplicity. Furthermore, AMPK deletion increased extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation and cell proliferation, whereas AICAR and metformin inhibited ERK activation and cell proliferation in keratinocytes, mouse skin, AMPK WT and AMPK-deficient cells, suggesting an AMPK-independent mechanism. Finally, in UVB-damaged tumor-bearing mice, both topical and systemic metformin prevented the formation of new tumors and suppressed growth of established tumors. Our findings not only suggest that AMPK is a tumor suppressor in the skin by promoting DNA repair and controlling cell proliferation, but also demonstrate previously unknown mechanisms by which the AMPK activators prevent UVB-induced skin tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1966185031,"Two thirds of breast cancers express estrogen receptors (ER). ER alpha (ERα) mediates breast cancer cell proliferation, and expression of ERα is the standard choice to indicate adjuvant endocrine therapy. ERbeta (ERβ) inhibits growth in vitro; its effects in vivo have been incompletely investigated and its role in breast cancer and potential as alternative target in endocrine therapy needs further study. In this work, mammary epithelial (EpH4 and HC11) and breast cancer (MC4-L2) cells with endogenous ERα and ERβ expression and T47-D human breast cancer cells with recombinant ERβ (T47-DERβ) were used to explore effects exerted in vitro and in vivo by the ERβ agonists 2,3-bis (4–hydroxy–phenyl)-propionitrile (DPN) and 7-bromo-2-(4–hydroxyphenyl)-1,3-benzoxazol-5-ol (WAY). In vivo, ERβ agonists induced mammary gland hyperplasia and MC4-L2 tumour growth to a similar extent as the ERα agonist 4,4′,4′′-(4-propyl-(1H)-pyrazole-1,3,5-triyl) trisphenol (PPT) or 17β-estradiol (E2) and correlated with higher number of mitotic and lower number of apoptotic features. In vitro, in MC4-L2, EpH4 or HC11 cells incubated under basal conditions, ERβ agonists induced apoptosis measured as upregulation of p53 and apoptosis-inducible factor protein levels and increased caspase 3 activity, whereas PPT and E2 stimulated proliferation. However, when extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK ½) were activated by co-incubation with basement membrane extract or epidermal growth factor, induction of apoptosis by ERβ agonists was repressed and DPN induced proliferation in a similar way as E2 or PPT. In a context of active ERK ½, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)/RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase (AKT) signalling was necessary to allow proliferation stimulated by ER agonists. Inhibition of MEK ½ with UO126 completely restored ERβ growth-inhibitory effects, whereas inhibition of PI3K by LY294002 inhibited ERβ-induced proliferation. These results show that the cellular context modulates ERβ growth-inhibitory effects and should be taken into consideration upon assessment of ERβ as target for endocrine treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2168289152,"Although human lysyl-tRNA synthetase (KRS), an enzyme for protein synthesis, is often highly expressed in various cancer cells, its pathophysiological implications have not been understood. Here we found that KRS induces cancer cell migration through interaction with the 67-kDa laminin receptor (67LR) that is converted from ribosomal subunit p40. On laminin signal, KRS was phosphorylated at the T52 residue by p38MAPK and dissociated from the cytosolic multi-tRNA synthetase complex for membrane translocation. The importance of T52 phosphorylation for membrane translocation of KRS was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. In the membrane, turnover of 67LR was controlled by Nedd4-mediated ubiquitination, and KRS inhibited ubiquitin-dependent degradation of 67LR, thereby enhancing laminin-induced cell migration. This work thus unveiled a unique function of KRS in the control of cell migration and its pathological implication in metastasis.—Kim, D. G., Choi, J. W., Lee, J. Y., Kim, H., Oh, Y. S., Lee, J.

Here, we show that the abnormal phosphorylation of DARPP-32 occurs specifically in medium spiny neurons (MSNs) expressing dopamine D1 receptors (D1R). Using mice in which DARPP-32 is selectively deleted in D1R-expressing MSNs, we demonstrate that this protein is required for l-DOPA-induced activation of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 and the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathways, which are implicated in dyskinesia. We also show that mutation of the phosphorylation site for cAMP-dependent protein kinase on DARPP-32 attenuates l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia and reduces the concomitant activations of ERK and mTORC1 signaling. These studies demonstrate that, in D1R-expressing MSNs, l-DOPA-induced activation of ERK and mTORC1 requires DARPP-32 and indicates the importance of the cAMP/DARPP-32 signaling cascade in dyskinesia."
https://openalex.org/W1969916031,"Despite the established role of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) as a growth inhibitor in vitro, a high level of IGFBP-3 in breast tumor tissue is associated with the stimulation of xenograft growth in mice and poor prognosis in patients. To understand the contribution of IGFBP-3 to breast cancer progression, tandem affinity purification was used to identify novel interacting proteins. The endoplasmic reticulum protein, glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), was shown to bind to IGFBP-3, confirmed by colocalization, coimmunoprecipitations, glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldowns and a nanomolar binding affinity. GST pulldowns also indicated that the GRP78 ATPase domain mediated the interaction with IGFBP-3. The critical roles of GRP78 in the unfolded protein response and macroautophagy led to an investigation of possible links between IGFBP-3, GRP78 and cellular stress responses. IGFBP-3 was found to stimulate the survival of breast cancer cells subjected to glucose starvation and hypoxia. Pharmacological inhibitors and small interfering RNA knockdown established that the increased survival of IGFBP-3-expressing cells was dependent on an intact autophagy response, as well as GRP78. The contribution of autophagy was confirmed by the demonstration that IGFBP-3 expression increases both the formation of autophagic puncta and flux through the system. In conclusion, we have shown that IGFBP-3 stimulates autophagy and thereby promotes the survival of breast cancer cells exposed to conditions that represent the adverse microenvironments encountered by solid tumor cells in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2038346401,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is a complex disorder that involves numerous cellular and subcellular alterations including impairments in mitochondrial homeostasis. To better understand the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of AD, we analyzed brains from clinically well-characterized human subjects and from the 3xTg-AD mouse model of AD. We find Aβ and critical components of the γ-secretase complex, presenilin-1, -2, and nicastrin, accumulate in the mitochondria. We used a proteomics approach to identify binding partners and show that heat shock protein 60 (HSP60), a molecular chaperone localized to mitochondria and the plasma membrane, specifically associates with APP. We next generated stable neural cell lines expressing human wild-type or Swedish APP, and provide corroborating in vitro evidence that HSP60 mediates translocation of APP to the mitochondria. Viral-mediated shRNA knockdown of HSP60 attenuates APP and Aβ mislocalization to the mitochondria. Our findings identify a novel interaction between APP and HSP60, which accounts for its translocation to the mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2061434125,"Transforming Growth Factor-β (TGF-β) and Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) signaling pathways are both independently implicated as key regulators in tumor formation and progression. Here, we report that the tumor-associated overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) desensitizes TGF-β signaling and its cytostatic regulation through specific and persistent Stat3 activation and Smad7 induction in vivo. In human tumor cell lines, reduction of TGF-β-mediated Smad2 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation and Smad3 target gene activation were observed when EGFR was overexpressed, but not in cells that expressed EGFR at normal levels. We identified Stat3, which is activated specifically and persistently by overexpressed EGFR, as a key signaling molecule responsible for the reduced TGF-β sensitivity. Stable knockdown of Stat3 using small hairpin RNA(shRNA) in Head and Neck (HN5) and Epidermoid (A431) tumor cell lines resulted in reduced growth compared with control shRNA-transfected cells when grown as subcutaneous tumor xenografts. Furthermore, xenografts with Stat3 knockdown displayed increased Smad3 transcriptional activity, increased Smad2 phosphorylation and decreased Smad7 expression compared with control xenografts in vivo. Consistently, Smad7 mRNA and protein expression was also significantly reduced when EGFR activity was blocked by a specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor, AG1478, or in Stat3 knockdown tumors. Similarly, Smad7 knockdown also resulted in enhanced Smad3 transcriptional activity in vivo. Importantly, there was no uptake of subcutaneous HN5 xenografts with Smad7 knockdown. Taken together, we demonstrate here that targeting Stat3 or Smad7 for knockdown results in resensitization of TGF-β's cytostatic regulation in vivo.

We have shown here that p16(INK4A) expression is reduced in 83% CAFs as compared with their normal adjacent counterparts cancer-free tissues isolated from the same patients. This decrease is mainly due to AUF1-dependent higher turnover of the CDKN2A mRNA in CAFs. Importantly, p16(INK4A) downregulation using specific siRNA activated breast fibroblasts and increased the expression/secretion levels of stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2. Consequently, media conditioned with these cells stimulated the proliferation of epithelial cells. Furthermore, the migration/invasion of breast cancer cells was also enhanced in an SDF-1-dependent manner. This effect was mediated through inducing an epithelial-mesenchymal transition state. By contrast, increase in p16(INK4A) level through ectopic expression or AUF1 downregulation, reduced the secreted levels of SDF-1 and MMP-2 and suppressed the pro-carcinogenic effects of CAFs. In addition, p16(INK4A)-defective fibroblasts accelerated breast tumor xenograft formation and growth rate in mice. Importantly, tumors formed in the presence of p16(INK4A)-defective fibroblasts exhibited higher levels of active Akt, Cox-2, MMP-2 and MMP-9, showing their greater aggressiveness as compared with xenografts formed in the presence of p16(INK4A)-proficient fibroblasts. These results provide the first indication that p16(INK4A) downregulation in breast stromal fibroblasts is an important step toward their activation."
https://openalex.org/W2082636793,"This study investigated the role of discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1), a collagen receptor that displays tyrosine-kinase activity, in the development of glomerulonephritis. Crescentic glomerulonephritis was induced in DDR1-deficient mice and their wild-type (WT) littermates as controls, by injection of alloimmune sheep nephrotoxic serum (NTS). Histological, functional and transcriptomic studies were performed. Glomerulonephritis produced a 17-fold increase of DDR1 expression, predominantly in glomeruli. DDR1 deletion protected NTS-treated mice against glomerular disease (proteinuria/creatininuria 5.5±1.1 vs. 13.2±0.8 g/mmol in WT, crescents 12±2 vs. 24±2% of glomeruli, urea 16±2 vs. 28±5 mM), hypertension (123±11 vs. 157±8 mmHg), and premature death (70 vs. 10% survival) (all P<0.05). Reciprocal stimulation between DDR1 and interleukin-1b expression in vivo and in cultured podocytes suggested a positive feed-back loop between DDR1 and inflammation. In NTS-treated WT mice, administration of DDR1-specific antisense oligodeoxynucleotides decreased DDR1 expression (-56%) and protected renal function and structure, including nephrin expression (4.2±1.4 vs. 0.9±0.4 arbitrary units, P<0.05), compared to control mice receiving scrambled oligodeoxynucleotides. The therapeutic potential of this approach was reinforced by the observation of increased DDR1 expression in glomeruli of patients with lupus nephritis and Goodpasture's syndrome. These results prompt further interest in DDR1 blockade strategies, especially in the treatment of glomerulonephritis."

Glial cells, in particular astrocytes, have been shown to be highly active in lipid synthesis and secretion. To determine the importance of astrocytes as lipid providers in the brain, we generated mice in which the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) was deleted from astrocytes using cre/lox technology. SCAP mutant mice showed microcephaly, without effects on astrocyte survival. SCAP deletion in astrocytes led to a loss of cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis pathways. SCAP mutants showed progressive motor deficits, dyskinesia, and reduced anxiety. Interestingly, SCAP mutants showed changes in brain sterol and fatty acid profiles that were concordant with reduced lipid synthesis as well as with increased uptake of dietary lipids. Accordingly, a high-fat diet rich in cholesterol and monounsaturated fatty acids, but not a fish oil diet rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids, improved motor deficits and survival of the mutant mice. These observations establish a critical role for astrocytes in brain lipid metabolism and demonstrate that dietary lipids can rescue astrocyte-mediated lipid deficiency. The ability to correct these neurological deficits suggests that lipid supplementation may serve as a treatment for brain disorders associated with defective astrocyte lipid synthesis. —Camargo, N., Brouwers, J.

It may emerge through selection of clones that are inherently resistant from the outset or through mechanisms acquired during treatment. Cell fusion represents an efficient means of rapid phenotypic evolution that make cells with new properties at a rate exceeding that achievable by random mutagenesis. Here, we first identified a number of proteins involved in cell fusion using a shotgun proteomics approach, then we investigated the role of these proteins namely tetraspanin CD81/CD9, ADAM10, GTP-binding protein α13, radixin, myosin regulatory light chain and RhoA in the regulation of colon cancer cell fusion. We also found a previously unrecognized role of ADAM10, Gα13 and RhoA in promoting cell fusion. Finally, we show that the occurrence of cell fusion in a metastatic model of colon carcinoma causes the appearance of cells resistant to both 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin. These findings highlight the importance of cell fusion in cancer progression and raise significant implications for overcoming chemoresistance in metastatic colon cancer."

Here, we show that targeted disruption of the novel gene Rnase10 encoding a secreted proximal epididymal protein in the mouse results in a binding defect in spermatozoa and their inability to pass through the uterotubal junction in the female. The failure to gain the site of fertilization in the knockout spermatozoa is associated with a gradual loss of ADAM3 and ADAM6 proteins during epididymal transit. In the distal epididymis, these spermatozoa appear to lack calcium-dependent associations with the immobilizing glutinous extracellular material and are released as single, vigorously motile cells that display no tendency for head-to-head agglutination and lack affinity to the oviductal epithelium. In sperm-egg binding assay, they are unable to establish a tenacious association with the zona pellucida, yet they are capable of fertilization. Furthermore, these sperm show accelerated capacitation resulting in an overall in vitro fertilizing ability superior to that of wild-type sperm. We conclude that the physiological role of sperm adhesiveness is in the mechanism of restricted sperm entry into the oviduct rather than in sperm-egg interaction.—Krutskikh, A., Poliandri, A., Cabrera-Sharp, V., Dacheux, J.

The most prevalent mutation, B-RafV600E, promotes cancer cell behavior through mechanisms that are still incompletely defined. Here, we used a sensitive microarray profiling platform to compare microRNA (miRNA) expression levels between primary melanocytes and B-RafV600E-positive melanoma cell lines, and between melanoma cells treated in the presence and absence of an MKK1/2 inhibitor. We identified a network of >20 miRNAs deregulated by B-Raf/MKK/ERK in melanoma cells, the majority of which modulate the expression of key cancer regulatory genes and functions. Importantly, miRNAs within the network converge on protein regulation and cancer phenotypes, suggesting that these miRNAs might function combinatorially. We show that miRNAs augment effects on protein repression and cell invasion when co-expressed, and gene-specific latency and interference effects between miRNAs were also observed. Thus, B-Raf/MKK/ERK controls key aspects of cancer cell behavior and gene expression by modulating a network of miRNAs with cross-regulatory functions. The findings highlight the potential for complex interactions between coordinately regulated miRNAs within a network."
https://openalex.org/W2008552477,"Cell proliferation and invasion are critical for malignant progression, yet how these processes relate to each other and whether they regulate one another during metastasis is unknown. We show that invasiveness of breast cancer cells is associated with growth arrest due to p21CIP1 upregulation. Knockdown of p21CIP1 increases cell proliferation and suppresses invasion. Since p21CIP1 acts to inhibit cyclin E during cell-cycle progression, we demonstrated that a constitutively active form of cyclin E had similar effects to p21CIP1 inhibition resulting in enhanced cell growth and suppressed invasiveness. We tested these findings in vivo in the Polyoma middle T mammary tumor model in which p21CIP1 was deleted. p21CIP1 knockout mice exhibited dramatic suppression of metastasis, independent of tumor growth, which was rescued by p21CIP1. Metastasis suppression by p21CIP1 ablation was associated with striking cytoskeletal reorganization leading to a non-invasive and highly proliferative state. Thus, p21CIP1 regulates metastasis by mediating reciprocal switching between invasion and proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2106253000,"Neurexin-1 (NRXN1) and neuroligin-1 (NLGN1) are synaptic cell adhesion molecules that connect pre- and postsynaptic neurons at synapses and mediate signaling across the synapse, which modulates synaptic activity and determines the properties of neuronal networks. Defects in the genes encoding NLGN1 have been linked to cognitive diseases such as autism. The roles of both NRXN1 and NLGN1 during synaptogenesis have been studied extensively, but little is known about the role of these molecules in neuritogenesis, which eventually results in neuronal circuitry formation. The present study investigated the neuritogenic effect of NLGN1 in cultures of hippocampal neurons. Our results show that NLGN1, both in soluble and membrane-bound forms, induces neurite outgrowth that depends on the interaction with NRXN1 β and on activation of fibroblast growth factor receptor-1. In addition, we demonstrate that a synthetic peptide, termed neurolide, which is modeled after a part of the binding interface of NLGN1 for NRXN1β, can bind to NRXN1β and mimic the biological properties of NLGN1 in vitro.—Gjørlund, M.

https://openalex.org/W2024353883,"Junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A) is a membranous cell-cell adhesion protein involved in tight-junction formation in epithelial and endothelial cells. Its overexpression in breast tumors has recently been linked with increased risk of metastasis. We sought to identify if JAM-A overexpression was associated with specific subtypes of breast cancer as defined by the expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor. To this end, JAM-A immunohistochemistry was performed in two breast cancer tissue microarrays. In parallel, cross-talk between JAM-A, HER2 and ER was examined in several breast cell lines, using complementary genetic and pharmacological approaches. High JAM-A expression correlated significantly with HER2 protein expression, ER negativity, lower patient age, high-grade breast cancers, and aggressive luminal B, HER2 and basal subtypes of breast cancer. JAM-A and HER2 were co-expressed at high levels in vitro in SKBR3, UACC-812, UACC-893 and MCF7-HER2 cells. Knockdown or functional antagonism of HER2 did not alter JAM-A expression in any cell line tested. Interestingly, however, JAM-A knockdown decreased HER2 and ER-α expression, resulting in reduced levels of phospho-(active) AKT without an effect on the extracellular signal-related kinase phosphorylation. The downstream effects of JAM-A knockdown on HER2 and phospho-AKT were partially reversed upon treatment with the proteasomal inhibitor MG132. We conclude that JAM-A is co-expressed with HER2 and associates with aggressive breast cancer phenotypes. Furthermore, we speculate that JAM-A may regulate HER2 proteasomal degradation and activity, potentially offering a promise as a therapeutic target in HER2-positive breast cancers."
https://openalex.org/W1990714271,"Bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) plays an important role in maintaining embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in the undifferentiated state and in the regulation of lineage commitment. We recently identified a transmembrane protein, named Dies1, the suppression of which by RNA interference blocks mouse ESC differentiation by interfering with the BMP4 signaling. We asked whether modulation of Dies1 levels could be a physiological mechanism to regulate ESC pluripotency and/or differentiation. We demonstrated that miR-125a targets Dies1 and regulates its expression in ESCs. The overexpression of miR-125a impairs differentiation, and this effect is specifically mediated by Dies1 down-regulation and accompanied by a decrease of BMP4 signaling. We also found that Dies1 is associated with BMP4 receptor complex and that BMP4 activates the transcription of miR-125a gene. Therefore, a feedback loop exists that sets ESC sensitivity to BMP4. The analysis of this regulatory mechanism revealed that miR-125a overexpression and the consequent inhibition of the BMP4 signaling arrest the cells in the epiblast stem cell (epiSC) status, due to the concomitant activation of the Nodal/Activin pathway.—Parisi, S., Battista, M., Musto, A., Navarra, A., Tarantino, C., Russo, T.

https://openalex.org/W2023460670,"Truncated-ERBB2 isoforms (t-ERBB2s), resulting from receptor proteolysis or alternative translation of the ERBB2 mRNA, exist in a subset of human breast tumors. t-ERBB2s lack the receptor extracellular domain targeted by therapeutic anti-ERBB2 antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates, including trastuzumab, trastuzumab-DM1 and pertuzumab. In clinical studies, expression of t-ERBB2 in breast tumors correlates with metastasis as well as trastuzumab resistance. By using a novel immuno-microarray method, we detect a significant t-ERBB2 fraction in 18 of 31 (58%) of immunohistochemistry (IHC)3+ ERBB2+ human tumor specimens, and further show that t-ERBB2 isoforms are phosphorylated in a subset of IHC3+ samples (10 of 31, 32%). We investigated t-ERBB2 biological activity via engineered expression of full-length and truncated ERBB2 isoforms in human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs), including HMEC and MCF10A cells. Expression of p110 t-ERBB2, but not p95m (m=membrane, also 648CTF) or intracellular ERBB2s, significantly enhanced cell migration and invasion in multiple cell types. In addition, only expression of the p110 isoform led to human breast epithelial cell (HMLE) xenograft formation in vivo. Expression of t-ERBB2s did not result in hyperactivation of the phosphoinositide kinase-3/AKT or mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways in these cells; rather, phosphoproteomic array profiling revealed attenuation of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) in p110-t-ERBB2-expressing cells compared to controls. Short hairpin-mediated silencing of STAT5 phenocopied p110-t-ERBB2-driven cell migration and invasion, while expression of constitutively active STAT5 reversed these effects. Thus, we provide novel evidence that (1) expression of p110 t-ERBB2 is sufficient for full transformation of HMEC, yielding in vivo xenograft formation, and (2) truncated p110 t-ERBB2 expression is associated with decreased phosphorylation of STAT5."
https://openalex.org/W2051124872,"Grb2-associated binder 1 (Gab1) is a docking protein that transduces signals from a variety of tyrosine kinases, including Met and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Although the related protein Gab2 is strongly implicated in human cancer, a role for Gab1 has been less clear. However, a screen for gene mutations in breast cancer identified two somatic mutations in Gab1, Y83C and T387N. In this paper we describe the functional characterization of these Gab1 mutants. MCF-10A immortalized mammary epithelial cells overexpressing Gab1 Y83C and T387N exhibited a more elongated, fibroblastic phenotype compared with wild-type Gab1 controls. Expression of Gab1 or the mutants promoted epidermal growth factor (EGF)-independent proliferation in monolayer culture to a similar degree. However, in Matrigel culture, both mutants enhanced the formation of acini exhibiting an aberrant, branched morphology. In addition, expression of the mutants modestly increased Erk activation. The two mutants also enhanced branching morphogenesis in a different mammary epithelial cell line, HC11. To gain further insights into the mechanism of action of these mutations, we mapped Gab1 phosphorylation sites by mass spectrometry. This detected phosphorylation of T387 but ;not Y83. Cellular stimulation with EGF or hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) led to a transient, or sustained, induction of T387 phosphorylation, respectively. As T387 corresponds in position to Gab2 T391, which suppresses Gab2 signaling in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, these data support a model in which the T387N mutation abrogates negative-feedback regulation of Gab1. Interrogation of publically-available databases revealed additional cancer-associated mutations at, or in close proximity to, identified serine/threonine phosphorylation sites in other docking proteins. These data indicate that aberrant Gab1 signaling can directly contribute to breast cancer progression, and that negative feedback sites in docking proteins can be targeted by oncogenic mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2141239407,"Group IVA phospholipase A2 (IVA-PLA2) is an enzyme that intiates the arachidonic acid pathway and plays an important role in inflammation. We demonstrate that IVA-PLA2 deficiency suppresses lipid deposition in the liver, which was induced by administration of a high-fat and -cholesterol diet (HFCD) for 16 wk in mice. Herein, we performed 2-dimensional gel-based comparative proteomics to further define the suppressive effect of IVA-PLA2 deficiency on fatty liver formation. In comparisons among 4 groups, wild-type (WT)/normal diet (ND), IVA-PLA2-deficient knockout (KO)/ND, WT/HFCD, and KO/HFCD, 4 proteins, 3 of which are associated with hepatic fibrosis, were identified as molecules, of which altered expression by HFCD was suppressed in KO mice compared to WT mice. Therefore, we assessed the effect of IVA-PLA2 deficiency on hepatic fibrosis induced by HFCD or carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) in mouse models. Biochemical and histological analyses revealed that IVA-PLA2 deficiency markedly reduced overall collagen accumulation in the liver of HFCD- and CCl4-derived mouse models. We found that IVA-PLA2 deficiency prevented activation of hepatic stellate cells and infiltration of F4/80-positive macrophages without affecting other immunocytes such as CD8(+) lymphocytes and natural killer cells. In summary, IVA-PLA2 deficiency attenuates not only lipid deposition in the liver but also hepatic fibrosis formation.—Ishihara, K., Miyazaki, A., Nabe, T., Fushimi, H., Iriyama, N., Kanai, S., Sato, T., Uozumi, N., Shimizu, T., Akiba, S.

https://openalex.org/W2002248601,"Pancreatic carcinoma, a leading cause of cancer death, is thought to develop out of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN). PanIN lesions have not yet attained the fully malignant phenotype, but show increased proliferation and dysplasia, and frequently bear an oncogenic KRAS mutation. Pancreatic cancer development is associated with increased activity of the transcription factor NF-κB. NEMO (IKKγ) is a subunit of the IKK complex essential for the activation of canonical NF-κB signaling and has been ascribed both oncogenic and tumor-suppressive roles in gastrointestinal tumors. Here, we wanted to address the function of NEMO in pancreatic tumorigenesis. We therefore conditionally ablated NEMO in a mouse model for pancreatic carcinoma based on the expression of oncogenic KRAS in pancreatic precursor cells. Mice were analyzed for PanIN lesions and for the activation of associated signaling pathways. NEMO ablation in the pancreas, while in itself not causing any overt pathology, led to a drastic (>93%) decrease in the prevalence of both low-grade and high-grade PanIN in 10-month-old mice expressing oncogenic KRAS. Also, the inflammatory and fibrotic response associated with KRAS action in the pancreas was virtually abolished, including expression of inflammatory cytokines and activation of the interleukin-6/STAT3 axis. Moreover, the activation of MAPK signaling, Notch and KLF4 signaling normally observed in KRAS-induced PanIN was strongly reduced or absent when NEMO was ablated. Our study suggests that NEMO, an IKK subunit necessary for canonical NF-κB activation, is dispensable for normal pancreatic development and function, but essential for the propagation of KRAS-induced PanIN lesions."

The relative weight of soleus muscle to body weight [soleus wt (mg)/body wt (g)] in the HUL group was less than that of the C and HUL + 17-AAG groups (P<0.05). We revealed HSP90, HSP70 mRNA decrease in the HUL group (but not the HUL+ 17-AAG group) vs. C (P<0.05). The unloading resulted in significant increases of μ-calpain and conjugated ubiquitin (Ub) levels (proteins as well as mRNAs) vs. the C group, whereas 17-AAG administration prevented these alterations (studied by SDS-PAGE and RT-PCR). pFOXO3 protein was decreased in the HUL group vs. C, but not in HUL + 17-AAG. Content of E3-lygase (MuRF-1, MAFbx) mRNA was increased in both suspended groups.

However, whether Aurora B is regulated by acetylation is not known. Using IP with an anti-acetyl lysine antibody, we identified Aurora B as an acetylated protein in PC3 prostate cancer cells. Knockdown of HDAC3 or inhibiting HDAC3 deacetylase activity led to a significant increase (P<0.01 and P<0.05, respectively) in Aurora B acetylation as compared to siLuc or vehicle-treated controls. Increased Aurora B acetylation is correlated with a 30% reduction in Aurora B kinase activity in vitro and resulted in significant defects in Aurora B-dependent mitotic processes, including kinetochore-microtubule attachment and chromosome congression. Furthermore, Aurora B transiently interacts with HDAC3 at the kinetochore-microtubule interface of congressing chromosomes during prometaphase. This window of interaction corresponded with a transient but significant reduction (P=0.02) in Aurora B acetylation during early mitosis. Together, these results indicate that Aurora B is more active in its deacetylated state and further suggest a new mechanism by which dynamic acetylation/deacetylation acts as a rheostat to fine-tune Aurora B activity during mitotic progression."
https://openalex.org/W2044562594,"More than 30 mutations in ACTA2, which encodes α-smooth muscle actin, have been identified to cause autosomal dominant thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection. The mutation R256H is of particular interest because it also causes patent ductus arteriosus and moyamoya disease. R256H is one of the more prevalent mutations and, based on its molecular location near the strand-strand interface in the actin filament, may affect F-actin stability. To understand the molecular ramifications of the R256H mutation, we generated Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast cells expressing only R256H yeast actin as a model system. These cells displayed abnormal cytoskeletal morphology and increased sensitivity to latrunculin A. After cable disassembly induced by transient exposure to latrunculin A, mutant cells were delayed in reestablishing the actin cytoskeleton. In vitro, mutant actin exhibited a higher than normal critical concentration and a delayed nucleation. Consequently, we investigated regulation of mutant actin by formin, a potent facilitator of nucleation and a protein needed for normal vascular smooth muscle cell development. Mutant actin polymerization was inhibited by the FH1-FH2 fragment of the yeast formin, Bni1. This fragment strongly capped the filament rather than facilitating polymerization. Interestingly, phalloidin or the presence of wild type actin reversed the strong capping behavior of Bni1. Together, the data suggest that the R256H actin mutation alters filament conformation resulting in filament instability and misregulation by formin. These biochemical effects may contribute to abnormal histology identified in diseased arterial samples from affected patients."

Here, we show that this combination can also convert neural stem cells to neuroblastoma-like tumor. To address whether there are common mechanisms regulating the expression of this combination of genes, we examined public repositories of gene expression data and found that although these genes are rarely expressed together, co-expression was observed in a proportion of germ cell tumors (GCTs), in embryonic stem (ES) cells and in testis. These cell types and tissues are related to pluripotency and we show here that in mouse ES cells, Arid3b and Mycn are indeed involved in cell proliferation; the former in avoiding cell death and the latter in driving cell cycle progression. Accordingly, the two genes are induced during somatic cell reprogramming to iPS, and this induction is accompanied by the switching of promoter histone marks from H3K27me3 to H3K4me3. Conversely, the switch from H3K4me3 to H3K27me3 in these genes occurs during the differentiation of neural crest to mature sympathetic ganglia cells. In many, if not most, neuroblastomas these genes carry H3K4me3 marks within their promoters. Thus, a failure of the epigenetic silencing of these genes during development may be an underlying factor responsible for neuroblastoma."

Postinjury regeneration of skeletal muscle occurs through activation, proliferation, and differentiation of resident stem cells, including satellite cells and endothelial precursor cells. We wanted to determine the role of mitochondrial function in the regeneration process. Using a previously described method for complex-mediated delivery to intracellular mitochondria, a combination of polycistronic RNAs encoding the H strand of the rat mitochondrial genome was administered to injured rat quadriceps muscle, resulting in restoration of mitochondrial mRNA levels, organellar translation, and respiratory capacity. Intramuscular ATP levels were elevated on pcRNA treatment of injured muscle; concomitantly, levels of reactive oxygen species in the injured muscle were reduced. These effects combined to produce a notable increase in the rate of wound resolution, accompanied by reduction of fibrosis and acceleration of myogenesis, vasculogenesis, and resumption of muscle contractile function. There was evidence of proliferation of Pax7+ satellite cells, expression of muscle-specific regulatory factors in a specific time sequence, and formation of new myofibers in the regenerating muscle.

However, few compounds can effectively discriminate between ligand-binding sites that contain α6 vs. α4 nAChR subunits. Using a chimeric (α6/α4) subunit, we showed that α-conotoxin BuIA binds the extracellular rat α6β2 vs. α4β2 interface with ~60,000-fold selectivity. Chimeras containing residues from the α6 subunit were inserted into the homologous position of the α4 subunit to identify critical sequence segments. The region between residues 184 and 207 in the α6 subunit accounted for the potency difference. Chimeras within this region followed by point mutations were constructed for further definition. α6 Lys185, Thr187, and Ile188 form a triad of key residues that influence BuIA binding; when these 3 α6 residues were inserted into the α4 subunit, there was an ~2000-fold increase in toxin potency. We used a crystal structure of BuIA bound to the acetylcholine-binding protein together with the structure of the Torepedo marmorata nAChR to build a homology model of BuIA bound to the interface between α6 and β2 subunits. The results indicate that the triad of α6 residues lies outside the C loop and is distantly located from bound BuIA (> 10 Å). This suggests that alterations in potency are not caused by the direct interaction between the triad and BuIA. Instead, alterations in C-loop 3-dimensional structure and/or flexibility may account for differential potency. Thr198 and Tyr205 also contributed to BuIA potency. In addition, Thr198 caused BuIA potency differences between the closely related α6 and α3 subunits. Together, the findings provide insight into differences between the α6 and other α subunits that may be exploited by α-conotoxins to achieve binding selectivity.—Kim, H.-W., McIntosh, J.

https://openalex.org/W1965388668,"Histone acetylation has a central role in establishing an active chromatin environment. The functional contribution of histone acetylation to chromatin transcription is accomplished by a dominant action of histone acetyltransferases over repressive histone-modifying activities at gene promoters; misregulation of these dynamic events can lead to various diseases. Here, we describe the synthesis and characterization of transducible peptides derived from histone H4 N-terminal tail as a molecular tool to establish and maintain the active state of p53 target genes. Cellular experiments demonstrate a distinct increase in p53 transactivation by acetylated H4 tail peptides, but only a modest change by unmodified H4 tail peptides. The molecular basis underlying the observed effects involves the selective interaction of the tail peptides with G9a histone methyltransferase and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and the disruption of their occupancy at p53 target promoters. Furthermore, treatment of xenograft models and cancer cell lines with the tail peptides sharply decline tumor cell growth and enhances apoptosis in response to DNA damage. These results indicate that H4 tail peptide mimics upregulate p53 transcription pathway and may be used as a novel strategy for anticancer therapy."

First, we confirmed the overexpression of AVEN in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL) patient samples. We then established a transgenic mouse model with T-cell-specific overexpression of AVEN, with which we demonstrated the oncogenic cooperation of AVEN with heterozygous loss of p53. Finally, we used a subcutaneous xenograft mouse model to show that AVEN knockdown in the T-ALL cell lines, MOLT-4 and CCRF-CEM, and in the acute myeloblastic leukemia cell line, Kasumi-1, leads to a halt in tumor growth owing to the increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation of tumor cells. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the anti-apoptotic molecule, AVEN, functions as an oncoprotein in hematopoietic neoplasms."

Aberrant EGFR activation occurs in many cancer types, and inhibition of this receptor is a promising anti-tumour strategy. Besides overexpression of the wild-type receptor, mutated oncogenic EGFR variants are often associated with malignant transformation. In human non-small-cell lung cancers, kinase mutants of the EGFR are rather common. Human glioblastoma often express the truncated EGFRvIII version as well as other dimerized and permanently activated mutants of the receptor, which are considered as tumour drivers. Similarly, the mutated and dimerized EGFR variant Xiphophorus melanoma receptor kinase (Xmrk) is causative for the development of malignant pigment cell tumours in medaka and Xiphophorus melanoma models. It is generally believed that oncogenic receptors that are active due to dimerizing mutations are ligand independent. Here, we show that different EGFR variants from fish and human efficiently induce autocrine loops by inducing EGFR ligands such as amphiregulin and HB-EGF. Importantly, the pre-dimerized oncogenic EGFR versions Xmrk from Xiphophorus and human EGFRC600F, though already active in absence of ligands, respond to ligand stimulation with enhanced oncogenic signalling. In summary, our data show that autocrine or paracrine loops are still acting on pre-dimerized oncogenic EGFRs and contribute to their pro-tumorigenic signalling."
https://openalex.org/W1975702639,"Focal adhesion kinase-family-interacting protein of 200 kDa (FIP200) has been shown to regulate multiple cellular functions, including cell adhesion, autophagy, development and proliferation. Furthermore, FIP200 is considered to have tumor-suppressive activity, which may be correlated with its inactivation in human breast cancers, in addition to its role as an important signal transduction node. Herein, we report that FIP200 interacts with the oncoprotein β-catenin. Moreover, FIP200 promotes destabilization of wild-type β-catenin, but not a cancer-causing form of β-catenin, and as a result represses the β-catenin-mediated transcription. FIP200-induced degradation of β-catenin is independent of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) of the well-established β-catenin destruction complex (glycogen synthase kinase-3β/axin/APC), in a component of β-catenin E3 ubiquitin ligase, β-TrCP-dependent manner. Thus, the APC-independent β-catenin degradation by FIP200 suggests a role for FIP200 in tumor suppression in the presence of APC dysfunction. These findings reveal a new and important function of FIP200 in regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2058091523,"Reduced expression of the pro-apoptotic protein SMAC (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase) has been reported to correlate with cancer progression, while its significance and underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the role of SMAC in intestinal tumorigenesis using both human samples and animal models. Decreased SMAC expression was found to correlate with increased cIAP2 expression and higher grades of human colon cancer. In mice, SMAC deficiency significantly increased the incidence and size of colon tumors induced by azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS), and highly enriched β-catenin hot spot mutations. SMAC deficiency also significantly increased the incidence of spontaneous intestinal polyps in APCMin/+ mice. Loss of SMAC in mice led to elevated levels of cIAP1 and cIAP2, increased proliferation and activation of the NF-κB p65 subunit in normal and tumor tissues. Unexpectedly, SMAC deficiency had little effect on the incidence of precursor lesions, or apoptosis induced by AOM or DSS, or in established tumors in mice. Furthermore, SMAC knockout enhanced TNFα-mediated NF-κB activation via cIAP2 in HCT 116 colon cancer cells. These results demonstrate an essential and apoptosis-independent function of SMAC in tumor suppression and provide new insights into the biology and targeting of colon cancer."
