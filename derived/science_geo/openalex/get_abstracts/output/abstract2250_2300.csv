https://openalex.org/W1487437286,"The (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase from human erythrocyte membranes has been solubilized in Triton X-100 and purified on a calmodulin affinity chromatography column in the presence of phosphatidylserine, to limit the inactivation of the enzyme. The enzyme was purified at least 150 times when compared with the original ghosts and showed a specific activity of 3.8 mumol.mg-1.min-1. In sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, a single major band was visible at a position corresponding to a molecular weight of about 125,000; a minor band (11% of the total protein) was present at a position corresponding to Mr = 205,000. Upon incubation of the purified preparation with [32P]ATP, both bands were phosphorylated in proportion to their mass, suggesting that both were active forms of purified ATPase."

Active lymphokines were obtained both from mitogen- and antigen-stimulated lymphocytes. These observations suggest that the degradation of collagen in chronic inflammatory lesions may be caused by macrophage collagenase.
https://openalex.org/W2006555144,"A library of random chicken DNA fragments, 15-22 kb long, has been prepared in the vector lambda Charon 4A. This library was screened with combined adult and embryonic globin cDNA, and several independent globin gene-containing recombinants were isolated. One of these recombinants, lambda Chicken beta-globin 1 (lambda C beta G1), contains the adult chicken beta-globin gene and a closely linked embryonic beta-like globin gene. Both genes are transcribed in the same direction with the adult gene located 5' to the embryonic gene. Electron microscopic visualization of R loop structures generated by hybridization of globin RNA to lambda C beta G1 demonstrates that both globin genes contain major intervening sequences about 800 bp long, similar to those present in mammalian beta-globin genes. The adult beta-globin gene also contains a minor (approximately 100 bp long) intervening sequence analogous to the one observed in mammalian beta-globin genes. Restriction enzyme analysis of the adult beta-globin gene on lambda C beta G1 is consistent with the hypothesis that its two intervening sequences occur in the same positions with respect to the beta-globin amino acid sequence as do the corresponding mammalian intervening sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1603501938,"Earlier studies have shown that cytochrome c oxidase from bakers' yeast is an oligomeric enzyme which contains three polypeptides (I to III) synthesized on mitochondrial ribosomes and four polypeptides (IV to VII) synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes. These polypeptide subunits have now been isolated by a simple protocol which utilizes differences in polypeptide charge, solubility, and size. Their molecular weights determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, gel filtration in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride, and amino acid analysis were: I, 40,000; II, 33,000; III, 22,000; IV, 14,500; V, 12,700; VI, 12,700; and VII, 4,600. All seven polypeptide subunits exhibited acidic isoelectric points; cytoplasmically made subunits were more acidic than mitochondrially made ones. The amino acid composition of two mitochondrially made subunits and two cytoplasmically made subunits was determined. The two mitochondrial translation products, I and II, contained only 34.7% and 42.1% polar amino acids, respectively, whereas the two cytoplasmic translation products, IV and VI, contained 48.3% and 49.3%, respectively. This agreed with the observation that Subunits I and II are very insoluble, requiring detergents for solubility, whereas Subunits IV and VI are water-soluble in the absence of any added detergent. These results indicate that the cytochrome c oxidase subunits synthesized on mitochondrial and cytoplasmic ribosomes are fundamentally different in size, isoelectric properties, and hydrophobicity. They also suggest the possibility that at least some of the mitochondrially made subunits are buried in the lipid phase of the mitochondrial inner membrane."

https://openalex.org/W2093367977,"The newborn mammal has a limited ability to mount an immune response1–5. As the individual matures, the potential for immunological reactivity develops and expands. During the early period of relative immune incompetence, tolerance to some foreign antigens is easily induced6,7. It is thought that the individual may be acquiring tolerance to self antigens during this period, hence its importance for immunological homeostasis. The contribution of mononuclear phagocytes to the initiation of immune responses is now well established. These phagocytes are essential for the development of various lymphocyte functions, in particular, those of the T lymphocytes. Most T-lymphocyte activities require that the macrophage take up and ‘present’ the antigen in a process modulated by the I region of the major histocompatibility gene complex (for review see ref. 8). Although some earlier studies5,9–13 have indicated deficient macrophage function in the neonate, precise definition of the putative deficiency is lacking. We show here that macrophages from neonatal mice present antigen poorly and that this can be correlated with the small number of macrophages that bear Ia antigens."

https://openalex.org/W29215966,"ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake, ATPase phosphorylation, and Pi production by sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles were measured in rapid quench experiments, using trichloroacetic acid, H&+, EGTA, EDTA, and La3+ as quench reagents. Trichloroacetic acid, EDTA, and H&+ cause total inhibition of enzyme activity and loss of accumulated calcium. On the other hand, EGTA and La3+ permit retention of calcium accumulated by the vesicles, while blocking ATP utilization within a time shorter than a single enzyme cycle. While EGTA inhibits specifically enzyme phosphorylation by ATP, La3+ quenches both enzyme phosphorylation and phosphoenzyme cleavage. A significant time lag between block of phosphoenzyme formation and block of phosphoenzyme cleavage suggests that the latter effect requires penetration of La3+ inside the vesicles. ATPase activity is also blocked with EDTA, which can be used for comparative studies on quenching at neutral or acidic pH and detection of possible acidlabile intermediates. It is concluded that the information yield from rapid quench experiments can be greatly enhanced by selective use of reagents displaying specific quench mechanisms. Thereby, it is demonstrated directly that: (a) an initial burst of Ca2+ uptake following addition of ATP is due to a single turnover of enzyme units phosphorylated before quenching, and corresponds to a distinct translocation step occurring with K > 14 s-‘; (b) a step related to hydrolytic cleavage of the phosphorylated intermediate is rate-limiting in the enzyme turnover; (c) the concentration of acid-labile enzyme l phosphate complex is negligible in the presence of ATP and Ca’+; (d) modulation of enzyme activity is dependent on occupancy of cation binding sites exposed to the outer or inner side of the membrane, consistent with a model of shifting site orientation to account for vectorial transport: (e) a state of very low permeability and minimal efflux of intravesicular Ca2+ is obtained only in the presence of ATP and Mg’+, when Ca2+ is dissociated from high affinity ATPase sites."
https://openalex.org/W1631870052,"ATP concentration modulates oxygen exchange catalyzed by purified, soluble mitochondrial ATPase during ATP hydrolysis so that water oxygen incorporation into each Pi formed increases markedly as ATP concentration is lowered. This behavior is readily explained by catalytic cooperativity between subunits of the ATPase. However, other reasonable explanations also need consideration. A new approach for assessing these various explanations is used, based on measurement of the [18O]Pi species formed by hydrolysis of ATP highly labeled with 18O in the gamma-phosphoryl group. The results and other supporting data give what appears to be the most compelling evidence yet attained for alternating site catalytic cooperativity in an enzymic catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1641317256,"Specific cell surface membrane receptors, labeled by forming a complex with low concentrations (about 10--9 M to 10--10 M) of a highly radioactive (125-I, carrier-free) ligand, can serve as simple, reliable, sensitive, and quantitative markers for plasma membranes in fractionation procedures. 125-I-Labeled insulin, cholera toxin and the plant lictins, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), and concanavalin A are the receptor ligands used for labeling plasma membranes. Plasma membranes are labeled before homogenization by incubating intact cells briefly at 24 degrees or 4 degrees, or by very brief in situ perfusion of the organ, with the 125-I-Labeled marker. After removing the free 125-I-labeled ligand from the medium by washing (at 4 degrees), the membrane-marker complex remains intact over prolonged (days) periods of time at 4 degrees. Labeling occurs nearly exclusively on the cell surface, the specificity of this plasma membrane reaction is maintained through homogenization and fractionation, and little dissociation of the complex, detectable exchange of label, or aggregation occur even upon prolonged incubation of the homogenates. When desired, the complex can be dissociated deliberately by manipulating experimental conditions such as temperature or by adding specific simple sugars. The most generally suitable marker appears to be WGA. At least in certain tissues (e. g. fat cells) labeling of the plasma membrane with 125-I-WGA and 125-I-isnulin can be performed equally well and selectively in homogenates as in the intact cell. 125-I-Cholera toxin cannot be used in homogenates because of significant binding to nuclei. The use of 125-I-labeled WGA as a specific plasma membrane marker is illustrated in following the course of fractionations, and in quantitating the yield and purity, of plasma membranes from fat cells, lymphocytes, and liver. The results are compared with simultaneous measurements of the plasma membrane enzyme markers, ATPase, 5-nucleotidase, and basal as well as hormone-stimulated adenylate cyclase activities. The fractionation of liver plasma membranes by aqueous dextran-polyethylene glycol two-phase polymer systems and by conventional differential centrifugation procedures arealso quantitated with the marker, 125I-WGA. Substantial quantities of plasma membrane material are no recovered in the interphase of the two-phase polymer system. Conventional liver fractionation procedures which retain, for further purification, only the readily sedimented pellet (2000 times g, 15 min) discard a very large (at least 70%) questenal hy"
https://openalex.org/W1588579481,"The rate of phosphorylation of the Ca2+-dependent ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles by ITP and ATP was studied using a millisecond mixing and quenching device. The rate of phosphorylation was slower when the vesicles were preincubated in a Ca2+-free medium than when preincubated with Ca2+, regardless of the substrate used and of the pH of the medium. When the vesicles were preincubated with Ca2+ at pH 7.4 an overshoot of phosphorylation was observed in the presence of ITP. The overshoot was abolished when the pH of the medium was decreased to 6.0 or when the vesicles were preincubated in a Ca2+-free medium. Using vesicles preincubated with Ca2+ the apparent Km for ITP found was 2.5 mM at pH 6.0 and 1.0 mM at pH 7.4. The Vmax observed (77 mumol g-1 s-1) did not change with the pH of the medium. Both at pH 6.0 and 7.4 the apparent Km for ATP was 3 microM when preincubated in a Ca2+-free medium. At pH 6.0 the Vmax for ATP varied from 96 to 33 mumol g-1 s-1 depending on whether the vesicles were preincubated in the presence or absence of Ca2+. At pH 7.4 the Vmax for ATP was 90 mumol g-1 s-1 in both conditions. The rate of phosphorylation of the vesicles was dependent on the relative Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations of the reaction medium regardless of the substrate used."

https://openalex.org/W2093418387,"We have studied the interaction of highly purified Int protein with DNA restriction fragments from the lambda phage attachment site (attP) region. Two different DNA sequences are protected by bound Int protein against partial digestion by either pancreatic DNAase or neocarzinostatin. One Int binding site includes the 15 bp common core sequence (the crossover region for site-specific recombination) plus several bases of sequence adjoining the core in both the P and P′ arms. The second Int-protected site occurs 70 bp to the right of the common core in the P′ arm, just at the distal end of the sequence encoding Int protein. The two Int binding sites are of comparable size, 30–35 bp, but do not share any extensive sequence homology. The interaction of Int with the two sites is distinctly different, as defined by the observation that only the site in the P′ arm and not the site at the common core region is protected by Int in the face of challenge by the polyanion heparin. Restriction fragments containing DNA from the bacterial attachment site (attB) region exhibit a different pattern of interaction with Int. In the absence of heparin, a smaller (15 bp) sequence, which includes the left half of the common core region and the common core-B arm juncture, is protected against nuclease digestion by Int protein. No sequences from this region are protected by Int in the presence of heparin."

We first constructed a derivative of plasmid pBR322 in which the expression of the tetracycline genes (tet) is controlled by the gal promoter (Pgal). This new plasmid contains a unique Hind III site between Pgal and tet into which the nutR and tR1 sites were introduced. The order of the relevant genetic markers in this second plasmid is Pgal-nutR-tR1-tet. Cells transformed with this plasmid express tet only if pN is provided and if the plasmid contains an intact gal promoter. Our data suggest that transcription which originates at Pgal is modified by pN at nutR, enabling it to pass through tR1 into tet. We conclude that promoters do not play a specific role in pN recognition and that nut sequences are both necessary and sufficient for pN action."

Isolation of the subunits has shown: (a) over 90% of the incorporated label is associated with the alpha and beta subunits; (b) the amount of label incorporated into the alpha subunit is about 0.5 g atoms/mol which is nonspecifically associated with a number of tyrosine and lysine residues; (c) the amount of radioactivity incorporated into the beta subunit is about 0.9 g atoms/mol which correlates with the degree of inactivation of the enzyme and resides on a single tyrosine residue; (d) up to 2.2 mol of alpha subunit have been isolated from each mole of inactivated enzyme; and (e) about 2 mol of beta subunit have been isolated from each mole of inactivated enzyme. These results account for the incorporation of 4.5 g atoms of 14C which are incorporated/mol of ATPase during inactivation if there are three copies each of the alpha and beta subunit present in the enzyme. It has also been shown that 4-chloro-7-nitrobenzofurazan (NBD-Cl) and FSBA react with different tyrosine residues when they inactivate the ATPase. In addition, it has been shown that the ATPase inactivated with FSBA retains the capacity to bind up to 2.2 mol of [14C]ADP/350,000 g of enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1547942394,"Purified DNA polymerase III has two distinct exonuclease activities: one initiates hydrolsis at the 3 termini, and the other at the 5 termini of single-stranded DNA. Both exonucleases have the same relative mobility on polyacrylamide gels as the polymerase activity. Molecular identity of the three activities is further indicated by their comparative rates of thermal inactivation and their sensitivity to ionic strength. The 3-5 exonuclease activity hydrolyzes only single-standed DNA. The rate of hydrolysis is twice the optimal rate of polymerization. The products are 5-mononucleotides, but the 3-5 activity is unable to cleave free dinucleotides or the 5-terminal dinucleotide of a polydeoxynucleotide chain. The 3-5 activity will not degrade 3-phosphoryl-terminated oligonucleotides such as d(pTpTpTp). The 5-3 activity catalyzes the hydrolysis of single-stranded DNA at 1/15 the rate of the 3-5 exonuclease. The 5-3 exonuclease requires the presence of a 5 single-stranded terminus in order to initiate hydrolysis, but will thereafter proceed into a double-stranded region. Although the limit products found during hydrolysis of substrates designed to assay specifically the 5-3 activity are predominantly mono- and dinucleotides, these products probably arise from the subsequent hydrolysis of oligonucleotides by the 3-5 hydrolytic activity. This interpretation is supported by (a) the relatively greater activity of the 3-5 exonuclease, (b) the inability of the enzyme to degrade d(pTpTpTp), and (c) the release of the 5 terminus of a single-stranded DNA molecule as an oligonucleotide. The 5-3 exonuclease attacks ultraviolet-irradiated duplex DNA which has first been incised by the Micrococcus luteus endonuclease specific for thymine dimers in DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1593706770,"Partial reactions of potassium-stimulated ATP phosphohydrolase from hog gastric mucosa were studied by means of a rapid-mixing apparatus. At 21 degrees C, in the presence of 2 mM MgCl2 and 5 microM [gamma-32P]ATP there was a rapid phosphorylation of the enzyme with a pseudofirst order rate constant of 1400 min-1. Addition of the ATP about 120 ms before the MgCl2 increased this rate constant to 4400 min-1. In the absence of MgCl2 there was no phosphorylation. Addition of 4 or 10 mM KCl to the phosphoenzyme which had been formed in the absence of KCl produced a rapid initial rate of dephosphorylation (k = 2600 and 3200 min-1 respectively). An additional slow component of dephosphorylation was observed when unlabeled ATP was added together with the KCl (k = 700 to 900 min-1). At a 4 mM concentration, KCl stimulated the ATPase activity about 9-fold. At higher concentrations, the activity was reduced in parallel with a reduction of the steady state level of phosphoenzyme. Addition of KCl to the enzyme before the addition of ATP plus MgCl2 resulted in a low rate and extent of phosphorylation. KCl appeared to inhibit the phosphorylation at a level preceeding the E.ATP complex."

https://openalex.org/W1600155863,"The environments of the two sulfhydryl groups of procine muscle adenylate kinase have been investigated by chemical modification reactions. The results indicate that the environments of the two-SH groups of procine muscle adenylate kinase are markedly different and that substrates induce conformational changes in the enzyme in the region of the sulfhydryl groups. The fluorogenic reagent 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1, 3-diazole (NBD-chloride) reacts specifically with the -SH groups of the enzyme at pH 7.9. One thiol group reacts with NBD-chloride approximately 40-fold faster than the other one, and the fast reacting group has been identified as Cys-25 in the amino acid sequence. The similarity of the rate of the more slowly reacting Cys-187 with NBD-chloride to that of glutathione with the same reagent is consistent with its location on the surface of the enzyme as determined by x-ray crystallography structure. The fast reacting Cys-25 in the interior of the structure can be approached by compounds such as NBD-chloride via a cleft. Reaction of Cys-25, presumably located close to the catalytic center, leads to complete inactivation of the enzyme. Substrates such as ATP, MgATP, and ADP which bind to the triphosphate subsite of the enzyme decrease the rate of reaction of Cys-25 by factors up to 3.5 but have only a small effect (approximately equal to 10%) on the reactivity of Cys-187. AMP, however, has a pronounced effect on the reactivity of Cys-187, the slowly reacting group. The multisubstrate analogue P-1, P-5-di-(adenosine-5)pentaphosphate (Ap-5A) decreases the rate of reaction of the fast reacting thiol group by a factor of 300. The behavior of Cys-25 toward NBD-chloride, i.e. super-reactivity in the absense of Ap-5A and slow reactivity in the presence of the multisubstrate inhibitor, was characteristic for both porcin and carp adenylate kinase. In the presence of Ap-5A adenylate kinase can be selectively modified at Cys-187; the introduction of the fluorescent NBD group at this position has no effect on enzymatic activity. A slow transfer of the NBD group occurs from the third groups to the epsilon-amino group of Lys-31. This transfer reaction is further evidence that the structure of adenylate kinase in dilute solution is similar to that of the crystalline enzyme since the x-ray data have shown that the sulfur of Cys-187 and the epsilon-nitrogen of Lys-31 are less than 4 A apart. The strongly fluorescent NBD-NH-enzyme possesses full activity and binds substrates as. cont'd"
https://openalex.org/W2082151095,"Two variant mtDNA types ((types IIa and HI-10) have been identified in individual subcultures of the extra-nuclear [poky] mutant of Neurospora crassa. Eco RI digests of type IIa mtDNA are characterized by an extra band, alpha, Mr = 1.4 Mdal, which arises from tandemly inserted reiterations of a 1.4 Mdal sequence. Restriction enzyme analysis and Southern hybridization experiments show: that the 1.4 Mdal repeats are located at the junction of Eco RI-4 and -6, that the repeats contain sequences ordinarily present in Eco RI-4 and -6, that the repeats are oriented head-to-tail and that the number of repeats per molecule (n) varies from n = 0 to n = 8, with about half of the molecules containing no repeats. The 1.4 Mdal repeats appear to be actively mained in type IIa mtDNA populations as a result of a specific alteration in mtDNA. Data are presented which suggest that this alteration may be located near small deletions and/or sequence changes in Eco RI-3 and -10, fragments almost exactly opposite the site of the repeats on the genome. The second variant, HI-10 mtDNA, arose in a heteroplasmic strain in which type IIa mtDNA was one component. The most striking feature of HI-10 mtDNA is the up to 5-fold amplification of an 18 Mdal segment extending from Eco RI-4 (the site of the 1.4 Mdal repeats) through the rRNA genes. Eco RI digests show that HI-10 possesses characteristic features of type IIa mtDNA, including the 1.4 Mdal repeats and the alteration in Eco RI-10. HI-10 mtDNA also shows a novel Eco RI fragment, beta, Mr = 2.9 Mdal. The variant Neurospora mtDNAs may be generated by mechanisms analogous to those which give rise to defective mtDNAs of yeast petite mutants. The possible consequences of defective mtDNAs in obligately aerobic organisms are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1486369166,"Incorporation of Pi and ATP synthesis by sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase were studied by rapid quench methods in order to demonstrate whether protein phosphorylation obtained in various experimental conditions leads to intermediates of the same reaction chain, or to products of independent reactions. Phosphorylation occurs rapidly (k = 30 s-‘) when saturating Pi is added to vesicles preincubated with ethylene glycol bis(P-aminoethyl ether)iV,iV,iV’,iV’-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), while it is much slower (k = 2.0 s-‘) in vesicles loaded actively (with calcium in the presence of ATP) previous to sequential addition of EGTA and Pi. If the reaction is started by simultaneous rather than sequential addition of EGTA and Pi, a lag period is observed and phosphorylation occurs with identical kinetics in loaded and nonloaded vesicles. In all cases, independent of the different kinetics of ATPase phosphorylation with Pi, decay of the resulting phosphoenzyme occurs with identical kinetics upon Pi dilution, consistent with hydrolytic cleavage of the same species. The rate constant for the hydrolytic reaction (8 to 11 s-l) is equal to the turnover of the enzyme operating with ATP as the substrate. Addition of Pi and ADP to loaded vesicles, independent of whether EGTA is added previous to or simultaneous with Pi, results in ATP synthesis with kinetics similar to those of Pi incorporation into the enzyme. It is concluded that ATPase phosphorylation with Pi occurs exclusively when the enzyme resides in specific reactive states which are part of the same catalytic cycle. Observed differences in the kinetics of phosphorylation are related to different states in which the enzyme resides in various experimental conditions and reflect conversion of the enzyme to a reactive state. Independent of the kinetics of ATPase phosphorylation with Pi, the resulting phosphoenzyme acquires the ability to synthesize ATP in the presence of high intravesicular Ca’+."

Iron, zinc, cobalt, manganese, calcium, sodium, copper, and potassium were not tightly bound at stoichiometric levels. Removal of magnesium by chelating agents caused loss of ATPase activity. Removal of tightly bound nucleotide by gel filtration in 50% glycerol- or 60 mM K2SO4-containing buffers did not remove magnesium. Cold dissociation did release magnesium when complete denaturation was accomplished. The results suggest that magnesium is an integral part of F1, that it is required for activity, and that magnesium and nucleotides are tightly bound at separate sites. The idea that the tightly bound nucleotides are not complexed with cations suggests certain structural requirements at their binding sites which might account for the unusual properties of the sites."

(1973) Nature New Biol. 245, 6-8) of molecular weights 60,000 and 35,000, respectively. The phi X A* protein is formed from a natural internal initiator site within the A gene cistron while the phi X A protein is the product of the entire A gene. These two proteins have been purified to homogeneity as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Previous studies have shown that the phi X A protein is an endonuclease which specifically introduces a discontinuity in the A cistron of the viral strand of supertwisted phi XRFI DNA. In addition to this activity, the phi X A protein also causes relaxation of supertwisted phi XRFI DNA and formation of a phi XRFH DNA . phi X A protein complex which has a discontinuity in the A cistron of the viral strand. This isolatable complex supports DNA synthesis when supplemented with extracts of uninfected Escherichia coli which lack phi X A protein and phi XRFI DNA. The phi XRFII DNA . phi X A protein complex can be attacked by exonuclease III but is not susceptible to attack by E. coli DNA polymerase I, indicating that the 5'-end of the complex is blocked. Attempts to seal the RFII structure generated from the phi XRFII DNA . phi X A protein complex with T4 DNA ligase in the presence or absence of DNA polymerase were unsuccessful. The phi X A protein does not act catalytically in the cleavage of phi XRFI DNA. Under conditions leading to the quantitative cleavage of phi XRFI DNA, the molar ratio of phi XRFI DNA to added phi X A protein was approximately 1:10. At this molar ratio, cross-linking experiments with dimethyl suberimidate yielded 10 distinct protein bands which were multiples of the monomeric phi X A protein. In the absence of DNA or in the presence of inactive DNA (phi XRFII DNA) no distinct protein bands above a trimer were detected. We found it possible in vitro to form a phi XRFII DNA . phi X A protein complex with wild-type phi XRFI DNA (phi X A gene+) and with phi XRFI DNA isolated from E. coli (su+) infected with phage phi X H90 (an am mutant in the phi X A gene). Thus, in vitro, in contrast to in vivo studies, phi X A protein is not a cis acting protein. The purified phi X A* protein does not substitute for the phi X A protein in in vitro replication of phi XRFI DNA nor does it interfere with the action of the phi X A protein which binds only to supertwisted phi XRFI DNA. In contrast, the phi X A* protein binds to all duplex DNA preparations tested. This property prevents nucleases of E. coli from hydrolyzing duplex DNAs to small molecular weight products."
https://openalex.org/W1579291064,"Abstract Techniques are described for studying the labeling of ADP and ATP to the ATP synthase complex of beef heart submitochondrial particles catalyzing oxidative phosphorylation. These suffice for measurements of nucleotides during the time required for a single turnover, during steady state net ATP synthesis, or under quasiequilibrium conditions of ATP formation and hydrolysis. Results show that the tightly bound ATP associated with isolated submitochondrial particles does not become labeled by medium [32P]Pi rapidly enough to qualify as an intermediate in ATP synthesis. In contrast to chloroplast preparations, little or no [32P]Pi committed to ATP formation is present on particles during steady state synthesis. Also, highly active particles synthesizing ATP from [32P]Pi and filtered after EDTA addition have no detectable [32P]ATP even though several ATPs have been made per synthase complex. However, under quasiequilibrium conditions membrane-bound ADP and ATP are present whose labeling characteristics qualify them as intermediates in ATP synthesis. In addition, a hexokinase-accessibility approach shows the presence of a steady level of ATP. Lack of detection of intermediates under other conditions is regarded as reflecting the ready reversibility of oxidative phosphorylation, with consequent facile cleavage of ATP and release of Pi."

By hybridization of 32P end-labeled total mitochondrial tRNAs and seven different purified tRNAs to restriction digests of mitochondrial DNA and of recombinant plasmids carrying specific restriction fragments, we have located the tRNA genes on the mitochondrial DNA. We have found that the mitochondrial tRNA genes are present in two major clusters, one between the two ribosomal RNA genes and the second closely following the large rRNA gene. Only one of the two DNA strands within these clusters codes for tRNAs. All of the genes for the seven specific purified tRNAs examined--those for alanine, formylmethionine, leucine 1, leucine 2, threonine, tyrosine, and valine--lie within these clusters. Interestingly, the formylmethionine tRNA hybridizes to two loci within one of these gene clusters.

Gelation of the protein occurred at about 70% inactivation; however, extrapolation to complete inactivation indicated that loss of activity correlated with modification of about 4 arginyls/mol. Partial inactivation of S-1 with phenylglyoxal also decreased MgADP binding markedly. When S-1 was modified in the presence of 5 mM MgADP, only 2 arginyls/mol were blocked and there was almost complete protection against loss of Ca2+-ATPase activity and ability to bind MgADP. Similar protection against inactivation by phenylglyoxal was obtained with MgATP or sodium pyrophosphate, but not with MgAMP or magnesium adenosine. These results suggest that 2 arginyls/myosin head are important for enzymatic activity, possibly serving as attachment points between enzyme and substrate. These essential arginyls were localized to a 17,000-dalton cyanogen bromide peptide from the heavy chain fragment of S-1."

The change in shape was specifically effected by analogs of cyclic AMP and cyclic AMP elevating agents, was reversible after removal of these additives, and was prevented by vinblastine and cytochalasin b, but was not affected by actinomycin D or cycloheximide."
https://openalex.org/W1532490583,"In toluene-treated cells of Bacillus brevis, newly synthesized RNA is rapidly degraded in a reaction that is inhibited by cyclic guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cGMP) and by 1,10-phenanthroline. This appears to be due to a ribonuclease found in cell-free extracts of B. brevis which is inhibited by cGMP and related compounds as well as by 1,10-phenanthroline. The cGMP-sensitive nuclease hydrolyzes synthetic polynucleotides, yielding nucleoside 5'-monophosphates as the sole products, even during the early stages of hydrolysis. Synthetic polynucleotides terminated by a 3'-phosphate are resistant to hydrolysis. While with 3'-hydrolysis of the polymer. The enzyme is therefore an exonuclease that degrades polynucleotides from the 3' end to product 5'-mononucleotides. It also acts on denatured but not on native DNA. Activity is greatest in the presence of Mn2+ and is not affected by the presence of monovalent cations. 1,10-Phenanthroline, but not 1,7-phenanthroline, inhibits the nuclease even when Mn2+ is present in excess. The inhibition of the enzyme by cGMP is noncompetitive, and cGMP itself is not hydrolyzed. The sensitivity of the nuclease to inhibition depends strikingly on the nature of the substrate and is lost when the enzyme is assayed at high pH. These observations suggest that cGMP inhibits the nuclease by combining with an allosteric site on the enzyme. Although cGMP was found to be the most effective inhibitor, other nucleoside 3':5'-monophosphates and derivatives of 5'-GMP can also inhibit the nuclease. Since measurements of cGMP in B. brevis have not revealed detectable amounts (less than 5 times 10-8 M), the substance that modulates the activity of the nuclease under physiological conditions remains to be identified."

https://openalex.org/W22176528,"Abstract In Neurospora, the gene encoding the mitochondrial large subunit (25 S) rRNA contains an intervening sequence of approximately 2.3 kilobases. We have recently identified two temperature-sensitive, nuclear mutants (289-67 and 299-9) which are defective in splicing of the 25 S RNA. When grown at the nonpermissive temperature (37 degrees C), the mutants show decreased ratios of 25 S/19 S RNA and accumulate a novel 35 S RNA which appears to be a continuous transcript of the 25 S RNA gene, including the intervening sequence. In the present work, mitochondrial ribonucleoprotein particles present in the 50 S subunit peak from wild type and mutant 299-9 were analyzed by equilibrium centrifugation in CsCl gradients containing 25 mM MgCl2. The results show that 35 S RNA can be isolated as part of a ribonucleoprotein particle associated with nearly all of the large subunit ribosomal proteins. However, the particles appear to be less stable in CsCl gradients and more sensitive to nucleolytic degradation than particles derived from mature large subunits. Our results indicate that binding of ribosomal proteins to 35 S RNA could precede removal of the intron, but that removal of the intron may be required to achieve stable protein binding."
https://openalex.org/W2427429835,"Certain phosphocreatine preparations contain a contaminant that inhibits phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase assays. The contaminant can be separated from phosphocreatine by anion exchange chromatography. After appropriate purification, phosphocreatine has no effect on phosphofructokinase or pyruvate kinase; thus, there is no evidence that it serves muscle as a regulator of these enzymes. Although the inhibitory preparations of phosphocreatine contain inorganic phosphate and trace amounts of more negatively charged phosphorylated contaminants, the inhibitor is not inorganic phosphate or pyrophosphate. The nature of the inhibitor remains to be determined."

https://openalex.org/W1514410121,"Pretreatment of hog high molecular weight renin for 30 min at 37 degrees C with 0.12 unit of either kallikrein or thrombin significantly increased (p less than 0.001) the amount of angiotensin I formed during subsequent incubations with homologous angiotensinogen. However, the thrombin-treated hog renin had 13 times more activity than the kallikrein-treated enzyme. Aprotinin did not inhibit the kallikrein-mediated activation of renin; the results indicated that aprotinin inhibited renin preferentially. Plasmin (0.25 unit) had little effect on the activity of high molecular weight renin. The molecular weight of hog renin on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was not altered after exposure to either kallikrein, thrombin, or plasmin. These results do not exclude the occurrence of a limited proteolytic event or a conformational change beyond the detection of the current method. The data show that the activation of hog high molecular weight renin by thrombin and kallikrein was not associated with the conversion of renin to Mr = 43,000."
https://openalex.org/W1606148238,"A method is presented by which an experimental record of total concentration as a function of radial distance, obtained in a sedimentation equilibrium experiment conducted with a noninteracting mixture in the absence of a density gradient, may be analyzed to obtain the unimodal distributions of molecular weight and of partial molar volume when these vary concomitantly and continuously. Particular attention is given to the caracterization of classes of lipoproteins exhibiting Gaussian distributions of these quantities, although the analysis is applicable to other types of unimodal distribution. Equations are also formulated permitting the definition of the corresponding distributions of partial specific volume and of density. The analysis procedure is based on a method (employing Laplace transforms) developed previously, but differs from it in that it avoids the necessity of differentiating experimental results, which introduces error. The method offers certain advantages over other procedures used to characterize and compare lipoprotein samples (exhibiting unimodal distributions) with regard to the duration of the experiment, economy of the sample, and, particularly, the ability to define in principle all of the relevant distributions from one sedimentation equilibrium experiment and an external measurement of the weight average partial specific volume. These points and the steps in the analysis procedure are illustrated with experimental results obtained in the sedimentation equilibrium of a sample of human serum low density lipoprotein. The experimental parameters (such as solution density, column height, and angular velocity) used in the conduction of these experiments were selected on the basis of computer-simulated examples, which are also presented. These provide a guide for other workers interested in characterizing lipoproteins of this class."
