https://openalex.org/W1963656947,Timing of the repetitive movements that constitute any rhythmic behavior is regulated by intrinsic properties of the central nervous system rather than by sensory feedback from moving parts of the body. Evidence of this permits resolution of the long-standing controversy over the neural basis of rhythmic behavior and aids in the identification of this mechanism as a general principle of neural organization applicable to all animals with central nervous systems.
https://openalex.org/W1988192567,"Abstract Recent studies have indicated that the DNA of the eucaryotic nucleus is organized in the form of supercoiled loops. We show here that after depleting interphase nuclei of histones and other nuclear proteins by treatment with nonionic detergent and high salt, intact (unnicked) loops of DNA can be visualized as a halo surrounding a nuclear skeleton or matrix. This halo of DNA loops can be reversibly wound using various concentrations of ethidium bromide and is irreversibly unwound when the DNA is gently nicked with DNAase I or exposure to ultraviolet light. These structures, comprising a halo of unwound DNA loops anchored to a nuclear matrix, provided us with a way in which to examine the relationship of DNA replication to the DNA loops. 3T3 cells were pulse-labeled with 3 H-thymidine for various periods and autoradiography was performed on the matrix-halo structures. It was found that after a 1 min pulse, >80% of the autoradiographic grains representing newly replicated DNA were found within the nuclear matrix even though the surrounding halo region contained 80% of the total nuclear DNA. With longer pulse times, the autoradiographic grains could be seen to move progressively outward from the nuclear matrix into the halo region. Over 70% of the autoradiographic grains could be chased out of the central matrix into the surrounding halo if the 1 min pulse was followed by a 1 hr incubation with excess unlabeled thymidine. These findings indicate that DNA replication occurs at fixed sites at the base of the loops and suggests that the replicating DNA loops are motile with respect to their nuclear matrix anchorage sites."
https://openalex.org/W1510981058,"A sequential dissociative extraction scheme is described in which tooth matrix proteins are extracted first in 4 M guanidine HCl, pH 7.4, and then in 4 M guanidine HCl, 0.5 M EDTA, pH 7.4, both with protease inhibitors present. The latter step dissolves the mineralized portion of the tissue and extracts noncollagenous proteins closely associated with hydroxyapatite crystallites in the mineralized matrix. In fetal bovine enamel, the initial dissociative extraction step completely removes proline-rich amelogenins from the tissue without dissolving the enamel apatite. The amelogenin proteins consist of several species on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with sodium dodecyl sulfate, but display anomalous migration behavior relative to conventional marker proteins in this technique. Subsequent extraction of fetal bovine enamel with guanidine HCl/EDTA removes matrix enamelins, acidic glycoproteins that are tightly bound to the enamel hydroxyapatite. This latter fetal protein type has not been isolated previously. The enamelins are adsorbed strongly by DEAE-cellulose in 7 M urea and totally adsorb to synthetic apatite, even in 4 M guanidine HCl. The enamelins display normal behavior on polyacrylamide gels and stain positively for sialic acid/phosphate and carbohydrate. With advancing tooth maturation, amelogenins disappear while enamelins are conserved. Gel filtration chromatography in 4 M guanidine HCl showed amelogenin components at apparent molecular weights of approximately 25,000, 15,000, 9,500, 7,500, and 6,000, while the enamelins eluted at Mr positions of approximately 72,000, 56,000, 42,000, 30,000, 21,000, 13,000, and 8,000. The gel filtration data showed a clear shift in molecular size population from higher to lower components for both amelogenins and enamelins with progressive enamel maturation."

The results suggest that olfactory and vomeronasal sensory information critical to male mating behavior is processed in the medial nucleus, which is an androgen-binding brain area. Thus the medial nucleus may act as a relay through which chemosensory information influences activity in the medial preoptic-anterior hypothalamic junction and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, areas important in the mediation of male sexual behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2133907310,"We have used electric dichroism to investigate chromatin fragments isolated from chicken erythrocytes. Both within the extended “10 nm filament” present at low salt and the condensed “30 nm solenoid” induced by the addition of divalent cations, the data give a quantitative description of the DNA conformation in the higher order structure of chromatin. In the 10 nm filament both the spacer DNA and the flat faces of the core particle discs must be oriented within 20° of the fiber axis. Within the Mg++-induced 30 nm solenoid the flat faces of the core particles must also be oriented close to parallel to the solenoid axis, the estimated angle depending upon the disposition of the spacer DNA. We suggest a model for the 30 nm solenoid."
https://openalex.org/W1662066112,"Recent studies have shown that there is an interorgan cycle of glutathione metabolism in which glutathione is translocated from certain cells into the blood plasma, and that plasma glutathione is utilized by cells that have gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. The present studies indicate that there is a significant intravascular phase of glutathione metabolism. The level of total glutathione (GSH + GSSG) in rat blood plasma was found to be 22 to 27 microM GSH equivalents, as determined by the glutathione reductase recycling method. About 85% of the total is in the form of GSH. These findings contrast with previous reports of total levels of 3 to 6 microM and 50 to 75% GSSG. We found that plasma allowed to stand at 23 degrees C for 30 to 60 min has total glutathione levels of 4 to 7 microM, most (95%) of which is GSSG; after treatment of this plasma (following deproteinization) with KBH4, levels of 21 to 24 microM were found. GSH disappears rapidly from plasma, whereas GSSG disappears very slowly. gamma-Glutamyl transpeptidase does not account for the loss of plasma GSH, nor does binding to proteins account for more than a small fraction of the GSH that disappears. Most of the GSH that disappears can be found in the deproteinized samples after treatment with KBH4. The findings are in accord with the view that glutathione is translocated to plasma in the form of GSH and that such GSH constitutes the major source of plasma thiol. The intravascular phase of GSH metabolism seems to involve reduction of disulfide bonds of plasma constituents and mobilization of compounds bound by disulfide linkage to plasma proteins to form GSSG and low molecular weight derivatives of glutathione such as disulfides."

The coupling of antibody to human erythrocyte F(ab′)2 in vesicles (140 molecules per vesicle) by this method caused a 200-fold increase in the binding of vesicles to human erythrocytes and resulted in about 80 percent of the vesicle lipid and contents being associated with cells.

Generation of a propagated nerve impulse in a crab nerve produced an outward movement of 50 to 100 angstroms of the nerve surfce and a rise in swelling pressure on the order of 5 dynes per square centimeter. In squid giant axons, the amplitude of the observed outward movement of the surface was small."

https://openalex.org/W1504663659,"The subcellular distribution of the acyl coenzyme A synthetases of rat liver was reinvestigated in order to determine whether part of this activity occurs in peroxisomes. Rat liver was fractionated by differential centrifugation and by equilibrium density centrifugation. Acyl-CoA synthetase was assayed using a new, simple extraction procedure on three substrates: palmitate, laurate, and octanoate. Comparison of the resulting synthetase distributions with the distributions of marker enzymes for peroxisomes, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum demonstrated the presence of some synthetase activity in each of the three organelles. These trimodal synthetase distributions were evaluated quantitatively by means of a computer program that calculated optimal linear combinations of marker enzymes using a least squares criterion. Peroxisomes were found to contain 7% of the liver's palmitoyl-CoA synthetase activity and 6% of its lauroyl-CoA synthetase activity, but no demonstrable octanoyl-CoA synthetase activity. The remainder of these activities are divided between the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, in a manner that agrees with previous studies. The chain length specificity of the synthetase(s) of each organelle appears to be unique. The absolute activity of the peroxisomal palmitoyl-CoA synthetase is sufficient to maintain maximal peroxisomal beta-oxidation. Clofibrate treatment of the rats caused a 2.6- to 3.1-fold increase in the liver's total acyl-CoA synthetase activities. The subcellular distribution was not greatly affected by this drug treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2145755249,"We have used homologous in vitro transcription to examine the nucleotide sequences required for activity of cloned Bombyx mori tRNA2Ala genes. We have compared the transcriptional properties of an intact gene and a truncated derivative of the same gene lacking all but 11 nucleotides of normal 5′ flanking DNA, and we find that at least two regions of DNA are required for accurate transcription of tRNA2Ala genes by homologous B. mori extracts. One of these sites is retained in the truncated gene and may be within the tRNA coding sequence. Competition experiments with intact and truncated genes indicate that this site probably acts by binding a factor necessary for specificity in polymerase III-catalyzed transcription. The second required site is removed by the Hind III cleavage used to produce shortened genes and thus must be 11 nucleotides or more upstream from the transcription initiation point. Possible roles for this site are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2130591395,"The complete DNA sequence of the ribosomal RNA region of mouse L cell mitochondrial DNA has been determined. Genes for the small (12S) and large (16S) rRNAs have been precisely located by direct sequencing of the termini of the two mature rRNAs. A comparison of the lengths (956 and 1582 nucleotides) and terminal sequences of the mature rRNAs with the DNA coding sequences indicates that mouse mt rRNAs are not spliced. Computer analysis of the complete DNA sequence has identified three potential transfer RNA genes. A gene for phenylalanine tRNA is located immediately adjacent to the 5′ end of the 12S rRNA gene, a valine tRNA gene occupies the entire region between the 12S and 16S rRNA genes and a leucine tRNA gene is located immediately adjacent to the 3′ end of the 16S gene. Hybridization of 32P-labeled, tRNA-sized mtRNA to selected DNA restriction endonuclease fragments from the rRNA region confirms the existence of small, abundant mtRNAs transcribed from these DNA sequences. All three tRNA genes and both rRNA genes are transcribed from the heavy strand of mtDNA. The mt rRNA sequences exhibit notable homologies to other rRNAs and, in particular, to those of E. coli. Within the 3′ terminal 50 nucleotides, the mouse mt 12S rRNA contains a potential 10 bp hairpin structure and a sequence of 15 consecutive nucleotides common to the RNA of the small ribosomal subunit in all systems, but does not contain the mRNA binding site (ACCUCC) found in E. coli and corn chloroplast rRNAs. The mt tRNA genes do not have the 3′ terminal CCA sequence encoded in the DNA, nor do they contain any intervening sequences. Two of the three tRNAs would lack many features which are known to be strictly conserved in all other nonorganelle tRNAs which have been sequenced. The fact that all the genes in this region are directly contiguous with at most one intervening nucleotide suggests that the entire region is transcribed into a polycistronic precursor RNA which is processed by endonucleolytic cleavages. The organization of the genes of the rRNA operon of mouse mtDNA, when compared to the organization of rRNA and tRNA genes in bacterial or eucaryotic nuclear genomes, provides evidence for the endosymbiotic hypothesis of the biogenesis of mammalian mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1583960539,"Cardiac troponin C (C-TnC) was labeled with the sulfhydryl-specific fluorescent probe molecule 2-(4'-iodoacetamidoanilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid at cysteine 35 and 84 to produce C-TnCIA. This modified protein binds Ca2+, undergoes Ca2+-induced increases in alpha helix, and forms a complex with other troponin subunits as does unlabeled C-TnC. C-TnCIA undergoes a small fluorescence decrease with Ca2+ or Mg2+ binding to the two high affinity Ca2+-Mg2+ sites of C-TnC and a large biphasic approximately 2.1-fold fluorescence increase with Ca2+ binding to two lower affinity Ca2+-specific sites with KCa of approximately 4.5 X 10(5) M-1 and approximately 5 X 10(2) M-1. C-TnCIA was formed in a complex with troponin I (TnI) and troponin T to form C-TnIA. This fluorescent reconstituted whole troponin undergoes a 25% decrease with Ca2+ binding to a Ca2+-specific site of KCa approximately 3 X 10(6) M-1. C-TnC, therefore, contains a single Ca2+-specific site of approximate equal affinity as the two Ca2+-specific regulatory sites of skeletal TnC. This Ca2+-specific site in C-TnC (like its two corresponding sites in S-TnC) undergoes an approximate 10-fold increase in affinity in whole troponin or when TnC is complexed with TnI. Since the two Ca2+-specific sites in skeletal troponin have been shown to be the regulatory sites of skeletal muscle contraction we suggest that this single Ca2+-specific site, of equal affinity, in C-TnC is the regulatory site of cardiac muscle contraction."

Hepatic mitochondria were isolated rapidly and formation of adenosine triphosphate and consumption of oxygen were assessed by a 2-minute incubation. Hormone injection enhanced formation of adenosine triphosphate 114 to 217 percent over control values, with a proportionate increase in consumption of oxygen. The ratio of phosphate to oxygen was about 2.0, signifying tightly coupled oxidative phosphorylation. Stimulation was not abolished by injection of cycloheximide, puromycin, actinomycin D, or chloramphenicol 1 hour before the rats were killed. This signifies direct mitochondrial stimulation by triiodothyronine in the absence of protein synthesis."

Based on the results of immunological assays, analysis of sugar composition, sequential degradation with specific glycosidases, and methylation analyses of the intact and desialyzed oligosaccharides, we propose the following structures for these compounds: (Formula: See text)."
https://openalex.org/W123822435,"A method is described for the purification of an enzyme, which catalyzes the conversion of benzene dihydrodiol to catechol, from rat liver cytoplasmic fraction to apparent homogeneity. The purification involved (NH4)2SO4 fractionation, DEAE-cellulose chromatography, interfacial salting-in and gel filtration through Sephadex G-100 superfine. The end product, which was purified over 500-fold with a yield of about 14% when compared to rat liver 100,000 X g supernatant, was judged to be homogeneous by several criteria, including sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, analytical ultracentrifugation, gel filtration, and immunoprecipitation. Physical studies suggested that the protein was a monomer with a molecular weight of 35,000 and one NADPH binding site per molecule. Amino acid analysis showed that the enzyme had a relatively high content of acidic and neutral amino acids in agreement with its isoelectric point which was at pH 6.2 Apparent Km values for benzene dihydrodiol and NADP+ were found to be 2.2 mM and 7.7 microM, respectively. The apparent Vmax value for the conversion of benzene dihydrodiol to catechol using NADP+ as cofactor was calculated to be 6.67 mumol/mg of enzyme/min. Substrate specificity studies showed that, in addition to benzene dihydrodiol, the dehydrogenase could oxidize acenaphthenol and the 3 alpha-hydroxy group of steroids. No activity was observable with a large number of other hydroxylated steroids possessing hydroxy groups at positions 3 beta, 11 beta, 17 alpha, 17 beta, 20 alpha, 20 beta, 21, and 22 of the steroid skeleton. Furthermore, only steroids which contained a 3-keto group and no double bond at the delta 4 position were reduced. This, and the fact that a range of nonsteroidal vicinal diols did not serve as substrates, indicates a relatively narrow substrate specificity. When benzene dihydrodiol was used as substrate, NADP+ was the preferred coenzyme but NAD+ was also accepted, whereas with the hydroxylated steroids the difference between the specific activities with NAD+ and NADP+ or with NADH and NADPH was less striking. The role of the enzyme in the metabolism of carcinogenic polycyclic hydrocarbons is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1537865659,"An adult rat heart myocyte preparation was used to study the uptake and metabolism of the 1-(14)C-labeled free fatty acids decanoate, laurate, myristate, palmitate, and oleate at 37 degrees C in the absence of serum albumin. The rate of total uptake consisted of both a nonsaturable and a saturable component. The nonsaturable component corresponded to the fatty acid accumulating in the free fatty acid fraction, and the rate of this accumulation increased logarithmically as a function of chain length. The saturable component corresponded to that portion of fatty acid converted to the only detectable metabolic products: CO2, triglyceride, and polar lipid. The Km for this process was about 1 microM and was independent of chain length. The Vmax for the saturable component varied only slightly with chain length, from 20 +/- 1 nmol/h-mg of cell protein for decanoate to 47 +/- 18 nmol/h-mg of cell protein for palmitate. The relative product distribution did vary with chain length, however, ranging from primarily carbon dioxide for decanoate to approximately equal quantities of carbon dioxide, triglyceride, and polar lipid for palmitate. Two internal pools of free fatty acid are postulated: a minor pool that equilibrates rapidly with external fatty acid and serves as the precursor for fatty acid activation, and a major pool containing most of the accumulated free acid. These two pools are interconvertible. The data support a simple diffusion or membrane-partitioning process for the accumulation of fatty acid in the second pool. The data presented in this paper are not sufficient to distinguish between a simple diffusion or a carrier-mediated process for uptake into the first pool. The saturation kinetics observed appear to represent a metabolic step such as fatty acid activation, rather than a transport carrier. Evidence of toxicity at a higher concentration of the longer chain fatty acids limits the concentration range that can be studied in the absence of albumin. Decanoate did not appear to be toxic at concentrations up to 300 microM, but laurate at 10 microM and myristate at 5 microM appeared to uncouple respiratory control."
https://openalex.org/W2008066554,"Xenopus laevis oocytes were used as a model system to study the intracellular fate of proteins incorporated by endocytosis. We found that the intracellular stability and compartmentation of proteins incorporated by receptor-mediated endocytosis differed substantially from that of proteins incorporated by nonspecific endocytosis. After its uptake, the specifically sequestered yolk precursor protein vitellogenin was converted to the yolk proteins lipovitellin and phosvitin which were stable with time (up to 13 days in culture). In contrast, nonspecifically incorporated albumin (125I-labeled or 3H-labeled bovine serum albumin) was rapidly degraded. To determine whether the differential stability of these proteins was related to their entry into different postendocytotic compartments, we examined the intracellular transfer pathways taken by these proteins. The transfer of vitellogenin from coated vesicles to the yolk platelets was found to involve a secondary compartment formed by the fusion of the incoming endosomes. This compartment, termed transitional yolk bodies (TYB), underwent a progressive condensation until it attained its terminal density (1.21 g/cm3) after ∼1.5 hr. The fusion of the TYB with the yolk platelets then occurred coincidentally with the time at which vitellogenin was proteolytically processed into the yolk proteins within the TYB. When the proteolytic cleavage of vitellogenin was blocked there was no fusion of the two compartments. In contrast, we found that albumin incorporated in the absence of vitellogenin was directly transferred from endosomes to yolk platelets without the formation of, or fusion with, a secondary compartment. However, when oocytes were exposed simultaneously to albumin and vitellogenin both proteins followed identical routes of compartmentation (that of vitellogenin) with no evidence of direct transfer of either protein to the yolk platelets. These results suggest that the incorporation of a specifically bound ligand can result in the formation of a unique intracellular compartment. Moreover, since yolk platelets were able to fuse only with vesicles lacking occupied receptors (in the case of albumin alone) or with a compartment in which the specific ligand had been proteolytically cleaved and presumably released from its receptor (in the case of VTG), we suggest that occupied receptors can act as a transmembrane signal which directs the postendocytotic compartmentation of proteins."

The final purified phosphoprotein product was chromatographically and electrophoretically homogenous. The apparent molecular weight for this fetal bovine dentin phosphoprotein was approximately 100,000 both by 4 M guanidine HCl gel filtration and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. This value is considerably higher than those previously reported for any other dentin phosphoprotein preparation. Roughly half of the total serine residues in the protein were phosphorylated and these residues together with aspartic acid comprised approximately 80% of the total polypeptide backbone.

We attempted to isolate the three lipid phases from both plaque homogenates and from extracted total plaque lipids using discontinuous sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The gradient was designed to isolate the cholesterol ester-rich phase (d 5 1.000 g/ml), the phospholipid-rich phase (d 5 1.028), the cholesterol monohydrate crystal phase (d < 1.054), and more dense nonlipid plaque constituents sedimenting at d = 1.054. The top layer of homogenized plaque (d < 1.00 g/ml) consisted of lipid droplets composed of 79.2% cholesterol ester, 7.8% triglyceride, 8.5% cholesterol, and 4.5% phospholipid. The top layer of extracted total plaque lipids had a similar composition. This composition approximates the cholesterol ester phase predicted by the phase diagram. The top layer of the extracted lipid system comprised 52% of total lipids closely approximating the 50% calculated from the phase diagram. However, only 20.4% of total plaque homogenate lipids were recovered in the top layer, indicating that some cholesterol ester was trapped or bound by other plaque components. The d = 1.028 layer revealed, in addition to the phospholipid phase, some cholesterol crystals, and in homogenate gradients, some lipid droplets. The composition of the homogenate d = 1.028 layer was consistent with the coexistence of all three lipid phases. The composition of the pure plaque lipid system d = 1.028 layer was consistent with the isolation of the phospholipid phase, but contaminated with some cholesterol crystals. The d = 1.054 layers from both extracted plaque lipids and plaque homogenate were rich in cholesterol monohydrate crystals. Homogenate layers were filtered and recentrifuged on a density gradient to further purify the crystals. The composition of the purified crystals was 88.0% cholesterol, 10.0% cholesterol ester, 1.1% triglyceride, and 0.9% phospholipid. The d = 1.054 layer of the extracted lipid system had a similar composition. Thus, two of the lipid phases of plaques, the cholesterol ester phase and the cholesterol crystalline phase, were isolated in relatively pure form. Almost all the"

Kinetic labeling and chase experiments in oviduct tissue-suspension system indicated that the ovalbumin and ovomucoid high molecular weight RNAs which were labeled with a short-time incubation can be chased by cold nucleosides and actinomycin D into mature mRNAs. The largest RNAs labeled in this oviduct suspension system have a size of 7.8 kb for ovalbumin and 5.5 kb for ovomucoid, which correspond respectively to the ""a"" bands of steady state RNA. The processing of the precursors to mature mRNA was also examined by electron microscopic analysis, by hybridizing oviduct nuclear RNA to probes which were isolated from different segments of intervening DNA sequences and by measuring the turnover kinetics of specific intervening sequences present in cellular poly(A) RNA.

https://openalex.org/W1525279229,"The regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase I has been cleaved proteolytically into two structurally independent domains. The larger domain (35K with trypsin or thermolysin and 31K with chymotrypsin) corresponded to the COOH-terminal end of the polypeptide chain and retained the cAMP binding site(s). The smaller domain (11 to 12K with trypsin), corresponding to the NH2-terminal region of the regulatory subunit, contained the region of dimer interaction. In the absence of reducing reagent, the two protomers of the native regulatory subunit and of the smaller domain could be covalently cross-linked by a disulfide bond. In addition to the two major domains, a 15-residue peptide that links the two domains has been isolated and partially characterized. Two major sites on the type I regulatory subunit were susceptible to proteolytic degradation. Site 1, susceptible to cleavage by both trypsin and thermolysin, has the following sequence: LysArg-Arg-Gly-Ala-Ile-Ser-Ala-. Cleavage at this site generated a 35K cAMP-binding fragment. Site 2 contained a chymotryptic cleavage site as well as a secondary tryptic site. The sequence at Site 2 was Val-Arg-Arg-Val-Ile-Ala. Cleavage here generated a 31K cAMP-binding fragment. Both sites contained 2 consecutive basic amino acid residues similar to the corresponding sequence in the type II regulatory subunit; however, in the case of the type I regulatory subunit, the serine at Site 1 does not serve as a site of autophosphorylation. In contrast to the dissociated regulatory subunit, the holoenzyme is partially protected from proteolytic degradation."

These findings support the observation that hydralazine is carcinogenic in mice. The carcinogenicity of many chemicals results from interaction with DNA. Since these studies demonstrate that hydralazine and dihydralazine damage DNA in mammalian cells, these drugs should be viewed as potential human carcinogens."
https://openalex.org/W2084237770,"The turnover rate of acetylcholine receptors at neuromuscular junctions in mice increases progressively after denervation and, after 15 days, reaches a half-time of 30 ± 5 hours. Denervation thus causes the clustered junctional acetylcholine receptors to assume the rapid turnover characteristic of extrajunctional receptors before innervation."
https://openalex.org/W1587396112,"Abstract The purity of several preparations of adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP) was analyzed using thin layer chromatography and the luciferin-luciferase assay. Three contaminants were identified: adenyl-5'-yl phosphoramidate, phosphorylated AMP-PNP, and ATP. The level of ATP contamination ranged from 0.02% to 0.3% in commercially obtained AMP-PNP preparations, and rose to 10% following incubation of AMP-PNP at 37 degrees C for 3 weeks in aqueous solution. The chemistry of the phosphoramidate bond is reviewed briefly, and evidence for a simple mechanism for the spontaneous formation of ATP from AMP-PNP is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1590620827,"Evidence for a reversible process resulting in stable activated and inactivated states of the mitochondrial branched chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex in isolated perfused rat heart is presented. The inactivation process is mediated by pyruvate infusion, while activation (up to 18-fold) is facilitated by branched chain alpha-keto acid substrates. The low activity state of the branched chain complex characteristic of freshly excised rat hearts could be maintained by infusion of either pyruvate or glucose. Activation of the complex in the perfused rat heart was achieved slowly by substrate-free perfusion, while rapid activation was accomplished by infusion of branched chain alpha-keto acids. The fully activated enzyme complex resulting from branched chain alpha-keto acid infusion subsequently could be inactivated maximally by infusion of pyruvate alone or intermediate degrees of inactivation could be produced by certain ratios of co-infused pyruvate and branched chain alpha-keto acid. alpha-Ketoisocaproate was an order of magnitude more effective than alpha-keto isovalerate either in preventing inactivation or in stimulating the opposing activation process when co-infused with pyruvate. The mitochondrial pyruvate transport inhibitor, alpha-cyanocinnamate, effectively prevented inactivation of the complex by infused pyruvate. Differential changes in the activation states of the branched chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes were evident when the two complexes were compared in apparently similar flux-inhibited (via octanoate infusion) and flux-stimulated (via dichloroacetate infusion) metabolic conditions. The differential effect of pyruvate concentration on the activity states of the two complexes was also well-defined. The results of the present study suggest distinct systems for the regulation of the activity of the two multienzyme complexes of interest. While our results argue neither for nor against an inactivation of the branched chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex by a protein kinase, the regulatory properties of such an intramitochondrial protein kinase may not be similar to the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. The mechanistic nature of the suggested novel regulatory system concerned with the pyruvate-mediated inactivation of the branched chain alpha-keto acid activation cannot be inferred at the present time."

https://openalex.org/W1978955613,"The crystal and molecular structure of folic acid dihydrate has been determined by x-ray diffraction. Folic acid is in an extended conformation with the pteridine ring in the keto form. The C(4) oxygen and N(10) atoms are on the same side of the molecule, hydrogen-bonded to the same water. This conformation has the pteridine rotated approximately 180 degrees away from the orientation of the pteridine ring of methotrexate bound to dihydrofolate reductase. The folic acid pteridine and phenyl rings interact in a stacking manner which is suggestive of the type of associations these groups could form in a complex of folate, dihydrofolate reductase, and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W2024479132,"Treatment of pregnant rats with reserpine prevented the normal disappearance of catecholamine fluorescence in presumptive neuroblasts of the embryonic gut. These cells normally express the noradrenergic phenotype transiently during embryonic development. The effect of reserpine was reproduced by treating mothers with hydrocortisone acetate. Moreover, the reserpine effect was blocked by treatment with dexamethasone, which inhibits the stress-induced increase in plasma glucocorticoids, and by mitotone, which causes adrenocortical cytolysis. It is concluded that reserpine, through the mediation of maternal glucocorticoid hormones, alters the phenotypic expression of these embryonic neuroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1558955530,"Phospholipids, glucolipids, and total proteins were separated from a plasma membrane fraction of rat liver. Membrane glycoproteins were isolated from deoxycholate extracts of rat liver membranes and hepatoma tissue culture membranes by concanavalin A chromatography. The membrane glycoprotein on hepatocytes that acts as a receptor for serum glycoproteins have lost their terminal sialic acid was also purified from rat liver membranes. Closed membrane vesicles were reconstituted from mixtures of deoxycholate-solubilized phospholipids and proteins by dialysis and purified by isopycnic centrifugation. The orientation of the proteins and glycoproteins in these reconstituted vesicles was examined by their accessibility to trypsin and neuraminidase and by their ability to be released from the vesicle by different concentrations of detergent. Most of the proteins are embedded in a right-side-out orientation in the lipid bilayer. The reconstituted membrane vesicles can be fused to mouse L-cells with polyethylene glycol. The extent of fusion is a function of the phospholipid:protein ratio in the reconstituted vesicles. After fusion, the phospholipid component of the vesicles mixes relatively rapidly with cell membrane lipids as judged by the immunofluorescence pattern of cells fused with lipid vesicles containing trinitrophenylated lipids. In contrast, proteins transferred to L-cells show restricted diffusion as judged again by immunofluorescence techniques. The metabolic turnover of proteins and glycoproteins after transfer to the plasma membranes of mouse L-cells was examined by radioisotopic methods. Total rat liver membrane proteins are very stable after transfer to the L-cells. Some of these proteins may be involved in the formation of an exoskeleton at the cell surface. Hepatoma tissue culture cell glycoproteins after transfer to the L-cells are less stable in terms of turnover properties than are total liver membrane proteins. However, some of these proteins are released into the medium as large molecular weight material rather than being degraded to small molecular weight, acid-soluble component. The receptor for serum asialoglycoproteins is relatively stable after transfer in reconstituted vesicles to the membrane of L-cells. Most of this hepatocyte-specific membrane glycoprotein is degraded to acid-soluble material with a half-life in the L-cell of at least 50 h. Transfer of the purified receptor in reconstituted vesicles to L-cells confers upon the recipient cell the biological activities specified and initiated by these receptors in hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2086196454,"All living and most fossil representatives of the reptilian subclass Archosauria lack pineal bodies. Arrhythmic, low-level, nonpineal melatonin is present, however, in the blood of Alligator mississippiensis. Although pineal bodies have been implicated in circadian phenomena, these results suggest that arrhytmic melatonin in alligators may not be involved incircadian events and indicate that the pineal is not the only source of the hormone melatonin. The evolutionary loss of the pineal in Archosauria occurred during the Mesozoic, and era noted for its seasonal stability. Arrhythmic melatonin titers inalligators and pineal loss in alligators and other archosaurs may be related to Mesozoic seasonal stability."
https://openalex.org/W1992436884,"The contemporary procedure for high resolution two dimensional gel electrophoresis was extended to include an initial nondenaturing dimension of electrophoresis. Use of the resulting three dimensional procedure revealed that the previously described single peak of estrogen-induced protein in the uterus of the rat contains at least three distinct proteins whose rates of synthesis are regulated by estrogen. These proteins were localized within partial protein maps, thereby providing definitive operational definitions for the detection and identification of each. It was unambiguously demonstrated that each of the three proteins is continuously synthesized in control uteri. These findings cast doubt on the simplistic hypothesis that estrogen induces a single key protein that triggers a ""cascade"" of sequential transcriptional events in the uterus. Our finding that the major uterine protein induced by estrogen is also synthesized in liver and muscle cells is significant in that it points to a more general cellular function for the protein, rather than a unique role within uterine cells. Finally, our procedure for three dimensional gel electrophoresis opens new avenues for the detection of minor proteins in heterogeneous protein mixtures, such as those from the tissues of higher animals."
https://openalex.org/W1546081672,"The effect of pH on the kinetics of the following transhydrogenation reactions catalyzed by energized and nonenergized submitochondrial particles has been studied: NADH leads to 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide phosphate (AcPyADP), NADH leads to thionicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (thioNADP), NADPH leads to AcPyADP, and NADPH leads to thioNADP. The effect of membrane energization on reaction rates can be approximated in the case of NADH leads to AcPyADP and thioNADP transhydrogenations, or equaled in the case of NADPH leads to AcPyADP and thioNADP transhydrogenations by lowering the assay pH to less than or equal to 6.0. For the reactions NADH leads to AcPyADP and thioNADP under energy-linked conditions, substrate Km values are lowest and Vmax values are highest at pH 7 to 7.5, the optimum pH for mitochondrial energy transduction processes. Under non-energy-linked conditions, however, Km values were lowest and Vmax values were highest at the most acid conditions (pH = 5.5) examined. Plots of ln (Vmax/Km) (an index of enzyme-substrate affinity to form a complex) versus pH showed the highest affinity at pH 7 to 7.5 for energy-linked conditions. Similar plots for non-energy-linked conditions. Similar plots for non-energy-linked conditions. Similar plots for non-energy-linked conditions showed a sharp and linear increase in the value of ln (Vmax/Km) as the assay pH was lowered from 8.5 to 6 to 6.5. This was followed by a less steep line down to pH 5.5, with a clear break at pH 6 to 6.5. These results suggested the involvement of ionizable group(s) with pK value(s) at pH 6 to 6.5 affecting enzyme-substrate binding under non-energy-linked conditions. An analogous mechanism, possibly by way of proton-induced conformation change of the transhydrogenase enzyme (EC 1.6.1.1), might be involved in increasing enzyme-substrate affinity and consequently the rate of transhydrogenation under energy-linked conditions.roton-induced conformation change of the transhydrogenase enzyme (EC 1.6.1.1), might be involved in increasing enzyme-substrate affinity and consequently the rate of transhydrogenation under energy-linked conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1578233641,"Rabbit liver microsomal cytochrome P-450 catalyzes the dealkylation of a variety of substrates when organic hydroperoxides, peracids, or peroxyesters are substituted for NADPH and O2. The peroxide-supported demethylation of p-nitroanisole by rabbit liver microsomes exhibited normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to both substrates. The Vmax values for the hydroperoxide-dependent reactions were dependent on the identity of the hydroperoxide and with several of the peroxides they were significantly greater than those obtained with NADPH and O2. The pH profiles for the hydroperoxide-supported demethylations were similar to the profile for the NADPH-supported reaction and exhibited optima from 7.0 to 7.6, depending on the identity of the organic oxidant. The kinetic mechanism of the t-butyl hydroperoxide-supported demethylation of p-nitroanisole was determined. Plots of reciprocal velocity versus the reciprocal concentration of either substrate at several different fixed concentrations of the other substrate converged to common points of intersection on the negative side of the ordinate and above the abscissa, suggesting a sequential mechanism involving the formation of a ternary complex between cytochrome P-450, p-nitroanisole, and t-butyl hydroperoxide followed by one or more reactions and the subsequent release of the products. Potassium cyanide was a competitive inhibitor with respect to t-butyl hydroperoxide and uncompetitive with respect to p-nitroanisole. t-Butyl alcohol, a product of the t-butyl hydroperoxide-supported reaction, was a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to both substrates. These results, which indicate that the reaction proceeds via an Ordered Bi Bi mechanism in which p-nitroanisole binds to the enzyme prior to the binding of t-butyl hydroperoxide, are discussed in relationship to the peroxidase-type mechanism which has been suggested for the action of cytochrome P-450."
https://openalex.org/W2083197844,"The underlying physical principles and current limitations of diagnostic ultrasonic instruments are reviewed. Recently developed ultrasonic imaging devices using pulsed-reflected ultrasound are discussed in detail. These instruments transmit short trains of 1.5- to 10-megahertz sound. Echoes reflected from tissue are converted to electrical signals, which are presented on a display device to outline the contour of tissues and organs within the body. The physical resolution of the system is dependent on several design factors in addition to the transmitted sound frequencies. A resolution volume of approximately 1.5 by 3 by 4 millimeters is achieved optimally with commercially available systems operating at 2.25 megahertz. The various instrument designs are described in the context of clinical usage. Because the sound is diffracted, refracted, and reflected, tghe imaging considerations are different from those of x-ray imaging. Diagnostic devices based on the Doppler principle are distinguished from pulsed-reflected ultrasonic instruments."
https://openalex.org/W2169922172,"The fatty acid synthetase of animal tissues consists of two identical subunits (Mr = 250,000), each of which is a multienzyme protein containing domains for the acyl carrier peptide and the seven different catalytic activities required for the conversion of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA to palmitate. Total poly(A+) RNA was isolated from goose uropygial gland and translated in a cell-free rabbit reticulocyte system. The translation products contained a polypeptide having the same molecular weight as the native synthetase subunits; this protein was specifically recognized by anti-synthetase antibodies and could be competed by excess native synthetase for antibody binding. Fractionation of the poly(A+) RNA by sucrose gradient centrifugation showed that synthetase mRNA is very large, repeatedly exhibiting a sedimentation coefficient of 35 S. Gel electrophoresis of this purified mRNA fraction following glyoxylation showed the presence of several species of RNA, one of which correlated well with the in vitro translation of the synthetase. This mRNA species has a molecular weight of 2.95 X 10(6), which is large enough to code for a protein with a molecular weight of 250,000. These results confirm the multifunctional nature of the synthetase and indicate that the synthetase subunit must arise as a single polypeptide chain synthesized from one contiguous mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1554054803,Minces and homogenates of muscle obtained from the marine shrimp Penaeus duorarum are capable of synthesizing homarine from [14C]glycine. Glycine carbon atoms are incorporated into homarine but not significantly into picolinate or quinolinate. [2-14C]Acetate is readily incorporated into quinolinate in the in vitro system but only slightly into homarine and not at all into picolinate. Quinolinic acid is rapidly methylated to N-methyl quinolinate which is not decarboxylated to form homarine. Procedures have been developed for the satisfactory separation of N-methyl quinolinate from homarine.
https://openalex.org/W1610611679,"Submitochondrial particles catalyze transhydrogenation from NADPH to [14C]NADP. This transhydrogenation is energy-linked, since its rate increases several-fold when the system is energized by succinate oxidation in the presence of rotenone (inhibitable by antimycin A or uncouplers), or by ATP hydrolysis (inhibitable by rutamycin or uncouplers). As in the case of transhydrogenation reactions from NAD(P)H to 3-ace-tylpyridine adenine dinucleotide phosphate and to thionicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, transhydrogenation from NADPH to [14C]NADP is also sensitive to treatment of the particles with trypsin or the arginyl residue modifier, butanedione. However, unlike the former reactions, transhydrogenation from NADPH to [14C]NADP cannot accumulate energy in the concentrations of the products, because, except for radioactivity, the nature and concentrations of the reactants and products remain unchanged throughout the course of the reaction. Therefore, the unrecoverable energy utilization by this region could be ascribed to an entropic component of the process, very likely an enzyme conformation change necessary for facilitation of hydride ion transfer from NADPH to [14C]NADP. This interpretation is in agreement with our previous kinetic evidence for enzyme conformation change associated with energy-linked transhydrogenation from NADH to 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide phosphate and thionicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, and with our conclusions regarding the mechanism of action of the transhydrogenase enzyme (Galante, Y.M., Lee, Y., and Hatefi, Y.

The enzyme is a proton pump and effects proton translocation coupled to hydride ion transfer from NADPH to NAD (Earle, S.R., and Fisher, R.R. (1980) J. Biol Chem. 255, 827-830). The present studies have shown that submitochondrial particles also catalyze transhydrogenation from NADPH to two NADP analogs, namely 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide phosphate (AcPyADP) and thionicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (thioNADP). Both reaction rates are greatly accelerated when the system is energized by ATP hydrolysis (inhibitable by uncouplers or rutamycin) or succinate oxidation (inhibitable by uncouplers or antimycin A). As in the case of NAD(H) in equilibrium with NADP(H) reactions, the transhydrogenations from NADPH to AcPyADP and thioNADP are inhibited by treatment of submitochondrial particles with trypsin or the arginyl residue modifier, butanedione. The Km values of the above substrates and the Vmax values under energy-linked conditions have been determined. The finding that the mitochondrial energy-linked transhydrogenase enzyme catalyzes transhydrogenation from NADPH to NADP analogs has revealed features regarding substrate site specificities and the effect of substrates on the directionality of proton translocation by the enzyme."
