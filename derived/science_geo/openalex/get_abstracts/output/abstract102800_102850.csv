https://openalex.org/W1999012962,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) induces both differentiation and survival of neurons by binding to the Trk receptor protein tyrosine kinase. Although Ras is required for differentiation, it was not required for NGF-mediated survival of rat pheochromocytoma PC-12 cells in serum-free medium. However, the ability of NGF to prevent apoptosis (programmed cell death) was inhibited by wortmannin or LY294002, two specific inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol (Pl)-3 kinase. Moreover, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) prevented apoptosis of PC-12 cells expressing the wild-type PDGF receptor, but not of cells expressing a mutant receptor that failed to activate Pl-3 kinase. Cell survival thus appears to be mediated by a Pl-3 kinase signaling pathway distinct from the pathway that mediates differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W2005562796,"Neurons in the superior temporal gyrus of anesthetized rhesus monkeys were exposed to complex acoustic stimuli. Bandpassed noise bursts with defined center frequencies evoked responses that were greatly enhanced over those evoked by pure tones. This finding led to the discovery of at least one new cochleotopic area in the lateral belt of the nonprimary auditory cortex. The best center frequencies of neurons varied along a rostrocaudal axis, and the best bandwidths of the noise bursts varied along a mediolateral axis. When digitized monkey calls were used as stimuli, many neurons showed a preference for some calls over others. Manipulation of the calls' frequency structure and playback of separate components revealed different types of spectral integration. The lateral areas of the monkey auditory cortex appear to be part of a hierarchical sequence in which neurons prefer increasingly complex stimuli and may form an important stage in the preprocessing of communication sounds."

This virus caused an outbreak of fatal respiratory disease in horses and humans. Genetic analyses show it to be only distantly related to the classic morbilliviruses rinderpest, measles, and canine distemper. When seen by electron microscopy, viruses had 10- and 18-nanometer surface projections that gave them a ""double-fringed"" appearance. The virus induced syncytia that developed in the endothelium of blood vessels, particularly the lungs."
https://openalex.org/W2062207135,"A single heterozygous nucleotide exchange in exon M2 of the gene encoding the parathyroid hormone-parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTH-PTHrP) receptor was identified in a patient with Jansen-type metaphyseal chondrodysplasia, which changes a strictly conserved histidine residue at position 223 in the receptor's first intracellular loop to arginine. Constitutive, ligand-independent adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate accumulation was observed in COS-7 cells expressing the mutant PTH-PTHrP receptor but not in cells expressing the wild-type receptor. This finding explains the severe ligand-independent hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia, and most likely the abnormal formation of endochondral bone, in this rare form of short-limbed dwarfism."

https://openalex.org/W2021505389,"The stretching of single, tethered DNA molecules by a flow was directly visualized with fluorescence microscopy. Molecules ranging in length (L) from 22 to 84 micrometers were held stationary against the flow by the optical trapping of a latex microsphere attached to one end. The fractional extension x/L is a universal function of eta vL 0.54 +/- 0.05, where eta and v are the viscosity and velocity of the flow, respectively. This relation shows that the DNA is not ""free-draining"" (that is, hydrodynamic coupling within the chain is not negligible) even near full extension (approximately 80 percent). This function has the same form over a long range as the fractional extension versus force applied at the ends of a worm-like chain. For small deformations (< 30 percent of full extension), the extension increases with velocity as x approximately v0.70 +/- 0.08. The relative size of fluctuations in extension decreases as sigma x/x approximately equal to 0.42 exp (-4.9 x/L). Video images of the fluctuating chain have a cone-like envelope and show a sharp increase in intensity at the free end."
https://openalex.org/W1984486504,"Members of the interleukin-6 family of cytokines bind to and activate receptors that contain a common subunit, gp130. This leads to the activation of Stat3 and Stat1, two cytoplasmic signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs), by tyrosine phosphorylation. Serine phosphorylation of Stat3 was constitutive and was enhanced by signaling through gp130. In cells of lymphoid and neuronal origins, inhibition of serine phosphorylation prevented the formation of complexes of DNA with Stat3-Stat3 but not with Stat3-Stat1 or Stat1-Stat1 dimers. In vitro serine dephosphorylation of Stat3 also inhibited DNA binding of Stat3-Stat3. The requirement of serine phosphorylation for Stat3- Stat3⋅DNA complex formation was inversely correlated with the affinity of Stat3-Stat3 for the binding site. Thus, serine phosphorylation appears to enhance or to be required for the formation of stable Stat3-Stat3⋅DNA complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2077673188,"Phosphatidylinositol (Pl)-3 kinase is one of many enzymes stimulated by growth factors. A constitutively activated mutant, p110*, that functions independently of growth factor stimulation was constructed to determine the specific responses regulated by Pl-3 kinase. The p110* protein exhibited high specific activity as a Pl-3 kinase and as a protein kinase. Expression of p110* in NIH 3T3 cells induced transcription from the fos promoter. Co-expression of dominant negative Ras blocked this response. When expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, p110* increased the amount of guanosine 5′-triphosphate-bound Ras, caused activation of the Ras effector Raf-1, and induced Ras-dependent oocyte maturation. These findings show that Pl-3 kinase can stimulate diverse Ras-dependent cellular processes, including oocyte maturation and fos transcription."

https://openalex.org/W2065129970,"Many surface proteins are anchored to the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria and are involved in the pathogenesis of these organisms. A hybrid molecule was designed that, when expressed in Staphylococcus aureus, was anchored to the cell wall and could be released by controlled enzymatic digestion. By a combination of molecular biology and mass spectrometry techniques, the structure of the cell wall anchor of surface proteins in S. aureus was revealed. After cleavage of surface proteins between threonine and glycine of the conserved LPXTG motif, the carboxyl of threonine is amide-linked to the free amino group of the pentaglycine crossbridge in the staphylococcal cell wall."

https://openalex.org/W2145484503,"Channel adaptation is a fundamental feature of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release channels (called ryanodine receptors, RyRs). It permits successive increases in the intracellular concentration of calcium (Ca2+) to repeatedly but transiently activate channels. Adaptation of RyRs in the absence of magnesium (Mg2+) and adenosine triphosphate is an extremely slow process (taking seconds). Photorelease of Ca2+ from nitrophenyl-EGTA, a photolabile Ca2+ chelator, demonstrated that RyR adaptation is rapid (milliseconds) in canine heart muscle when physiological Mg2+ concentrations are present. Phosphorylation of the RyR by protein kinase A increased the responsiveness of the channel to Ca2+ and accelerated the kinetics of adaptation. These properties of the RyR from heart may also be relevant to other cells in which multiple agonist-dependent triggering events regulate cellular functions."
https://openalex.org/W2008077535,"Shock due to Gram-negative bacterial sepsis is a consequence of acute inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or endotoxin released from bacteria. LPS is a major constituent of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, and its terminal disaccharide phospholipid (lipid A) portion contains the key structural features responsible for toxic activity. Based on the proposed structure of nontoxic Rhodobacter capsulatus lipid A, a fully stabilized endotoxin antagonist E5531 has been synthesized. In vitro, E5531 demonstrated potent antagonism of LPS-mediated cellular activation in a variety of systems. In vivo, E5531 protected mice from LPS-induced lethality and, in cooperation with an antibiotic, protected mice from a lethal infection of viable Escherichia coli."
https://openalex.org/W2020991261,"Outer hair cells undergo somatic elongation-contraction cycles in vitro when electrically stimulated. This ""electromotile"" response is assumed to underlie the high sensitivity and frequency selectivity of amplification in the mammalian cochlea. This process, presumably operating on a cycle-by-cycle basis at the frequency of the stimulus, is believed to provide mechanical feedback in vivo. However, if driven by the receptor potential of the cell, the mechanical feedback is expected to be severely attenuated at high frequencies because of electrical low-pass filtering by the outer hair cell basolateral membrane. It is proposed that electromotility at high frequencies is driven instead by extracellular potential gradients across the hair cell, and it is shown that this driving voltage is not subject to low-pass filtering and is sufficiently large. It is further shown that if the filtering properties of the cell membrane are canceled, taking advantage of the electrical characteristics of isolated outer hair cells in a partitioning glass microchamber, then the lower bound of the motor's bandwidth is approximately 22 kilohertz, a number determined only by the limitations of our instrumentation."
https://openalex.org/W2026444215,"Topographs of two-dimensional porin OmpF crystals reconstituted in the presence of lipids were recorded in solution by atomic force microscopy (AFM) to a lateral resolution of 10 angstroms and a vertical resolution of 1 angstrom. Protein-protein interactions were demonstrated on the basis of the AFM results and earlier crystallographic findings. To assess protein-lipid interactions, the bilayer was modeled with kinked lipids by fitting the head groups to contours determined with AFM. Finally, two conformations of the extracellular porin surface were detected at forces of 0.1 nanonewton, demonstrating the potential of AFM to monitor conformational changes with high resolution."
https://openalex.org/W1996621120,"The crystal structure of the extracellular portion of the beta chain of a murine T cell antigen receptor (TCR), determined at a resolution of 1.7 angstroms, shows structural homology to immunoglobulins. The structure of the first and second hypervariable loops suggested that, in general, they adopt more restricted sets of conformations in TCR beta chains than those found in immunoglobulins; the third hypervariable loop had certain structural characteristics in common with those of immunoglobulin heavy chain variable domains. The variable and constant domains were in close contact, presumably restricting the flexibility of the beta chain. This may facilitate signal transduction from the TCR to the associated CD3 molecules in the TCR-CD3 complex."
https://openalex.org/W2091418690,"Artificial ferritin has been synthesized with control of both the magnetic state (antiferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic) and the particle size over an ofer of magnitude in the number of iron atoms. The magnetic properties of the artificial ferritin were compared with those of natural horse spleen ferritin in a range of temperatures (20 millikelvin to 300 kelvin) and fields (1 nanotesla to 27 tesla). In the classical regime, the blocking temperature was found to correlate with the average particle size. A correlation was also observed in the quantum regime between the resonance frequency of macroscopic quantum tunneling of the Néel vector and the particle size. At high magnetic fields (to 27 tesla), a spin flop transition with a strong dependence on orientation was seen in the natural ferritin, providing evidence of antiferromagnetism in this system."
https://openalex.org/W2088192500,"Insects could minimize the high energetic costs of flight in two ways: by employing high-efficiency muscles and by using elastic elements within the thorax to recover energy expended accelerating the wings. However, because muscle efficiency and elastic storage have proven difficult variables to measure, it is not known which of these strategies is actually used. By comparison of mechanical power measurements based on gas exchange with simultaneously measured flight kinematics in Drosophila, a method was developed for determining both the mechanical efficiency and the minimum degree of elastic storage within the flight motor. Muscle efficiency values of 10 percent suggest that insects may minimize energy use in flight by employing an elastic flight motor rather than by using extraordinarily efficient muscles. Further, because of the trade-off between inertial and aerodynamic power throughout the wing stroke, an elastic storage capacity as low as 10 percent may be enough to minimize the energetic costs of flight."

https://openalex.org/W1972635679,"The crystal structure of a class I aminoacyl-transfer RNA synthetase, glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (GluRS) from Thermus thermophilus, was solved and refined at 2.5 Å resolution. The amino-terminal half of GluRS shows a geometrical similarity with that of Escherichia coliglutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (GlnRS) of the same subclass in class I, comprising the class I-specific Rossmann fold domain and the intervening subclass-specific α/β domain. These domains were found to have two GluRS-specific, secondary-structure insertions, which then participated in the specific recognition of the D and acceptor stems of tRNAGlu as indicated by mutagenesis analyses based on the docking properties of GluRS and tRNA. In striking contrast to the β-barrel structure of the GlnRS carboxyl-terminal half, the GluRS carboxyl-terminal half displayed an all-α-helix architecture, an α-helix cage, and mutagenesis analyses indicated that it had a role in the anticodon recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2054160977,"Isotopic signatures of nitrogen, argon, and xenon have been determined in separated millimeter-sized pockets of shock-melted glass in a recently identified lithology of the meteorite Zagami, a shergottite. The ratio of nitrogen-15 to nitrogen-14, which is at least 282 per mil larger than the terrestrial value, the ratio of xenon-129 to xenon-132 = 2.40, and the argon isotopic abundances match the signatures previously observed in the glassy lithology of the Antarctic shergottite EETA 79001. These results show that the signatures in EETA 79001 are not unique but characterize the trapped gas component in shock-melted glass of shergottites. The isotopic and elemental ratios of nitrogen, argon, and xenon closely resemble the Viking spacecraft data for the martian atmosphere and provide compelling evidence for a martian origin of the two shergottites and, by extension, of the meteorites in the shergottites-nakhlites-chassignites (SNC) group."

https://openalex.org/W2015672867,"The genetic code is based on specific interactions between transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetases and their cognate tRNAs. The anticodons for methionine and isoleucine tRNAs differ by a single nucleotide, and changing this nucleotide in an isoleucine tRNA is sufficient to change aminoacylation specificity to methionine. Results of combinatorial mutagenesis of an anticodon-binding-helix loop peptide were used to design a hybrid sequence composed of amino acid residues from methionyl- and isoleucyl-tRNA synthetases. When the hybrid sequence was transplanted into isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, active enzyme was generated in vivo and in vitro. The transplanted peptide did not confer function to methionyl-tRNA synthetase, but the substitution of a single amino acid within the transplanted peptide conferred methionylation and prevented isoleucylation. Thus, the swap of a single amino acid in the transplanted peptide switches specificity between anticodons that differ by one nucleotide."
