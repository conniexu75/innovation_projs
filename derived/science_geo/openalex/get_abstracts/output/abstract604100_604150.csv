https://openalex.org/W2785291766,"Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are abundant and heterogeneous stromal cells in tumor microenvironment that are critically involved in cancer progression. Here, we demonstrate that two cell-surface molecules, CD10 and GPR77, specifically define a CAF subset correlated with chemoresistance and poor survival in multiple cohorts of breast and lung cancer patients. CD10+GPR77+ CAFs promote tumor formation and chemoresistance by providing a survival niche for cancer stem cells (CSCs). Mechanistically, CD10+GPR77+ CAFs are driven by persistent NF-κB activation via p65 phosphorylation and acetylation, which is maintained by complement signaling via GPR77, a C5a receptor. Furthermore, CD10+GPR77+ CAFs promote successful engraftment of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), and targeting these CAFs with a neutralizing anti-GPR77 antibody abolishes tumor formation and restores tumor chemosensitivity. Our study reveals a functional CAF subset that can be defined and isolated by specific cell-surface markers and suggests that targeting the CD10+GPR77+ CAF subset could be an effective therapeutic strategy against CSC-driven solid tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2784970793,"Type I interferon (IFN) is produced when host sensors detect foreign nucleic acids, but how sensors differentiate self from nonself nucleic acids, such as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), is incompletely understood. Mutations in ADAR1, an adenosine-to-inosine editing enzyme of dsRNA, cause Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome, an autoinflammatory disorder associated with spontaneous interferon production and neurologic sequelae. We generated ADAR1 knockout human cells to explore ADAR1 substrates and function. ADAR1 primarily edited Alu elements in RNA polymerase II (pol II)-transcribed mRNAs, but not putative pol III-transcribed Alus. During the IFN response, ADAR1 blocked translational shutdown by inhibiting hyperactivation of PKR, a dsRNA sensor. ADAR1 dsRNA binding and catalytic activities were required to fully prevent endogenous RNA from activating PKR. Remarkably, ADAR1 knockout neuronal progenitor cells exhibited MDA5 (dsRNA sensor)-dependent spontaneous interferon production, PKR activation, and cell death. Thus, human ADAR1 regulates sensing of self versus nonself RNA, allowing pathogen detection while avoiding autoinflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2784999778,"Aberrant activation of innate immune receptors can cause a spectrum of immune disorders, such as Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome (AGS). One such receptor is MDA5, a viral dsRNA sensor that induces antiviral immune response. Using a newly developed RNase-protection/RNA-seq approach, we demonstrate here that constitutive activation of MDA5 in AGS results from the loss of tolerance to cellular dsRNAs formed by Alu retroelements. While wild-type MDA5 cannot efficiently recognize Alu-dsRNAs because of its limited filament formation on imperfect duplexes, AGS variants of MDA5 display reduced sensitivity to duplex structural irregularities, assembling signaling-competent filaments on Alu-dsRNAs. Moreover, we identified an unexpected role of an RNA-rich cellular environment in suppressing aberrant MDA5 oligomerization, highlighting context dependence of self versus non-self discrimination. Overall, our work demonstrates that the increased efficiency of MDA5 in recognizing dsRNA comes at a cost of self-recognition and implicates a unique role of Alu-dsRNAs as virus-like elements that shape the primate immune system."

Mammalian cell proliferation requires adequate supply of energy and cellular building blocks, including phospholipids and cholesterol—two major components of cellular membranes (Boroughs and DeBerardinis, 2015Boroughs L.K.

In addition to their roles as biomass components, phospholipids and cholesterol play regulatory roles as signaling molecules that engage specific receptors and transcription factors (Repa and Mangelsdorf, 2000Repa J.J.

It has also become clear that dynamic changes in phospholipid and cholesterol metabolism can impact membrane composition and alter membrane biophysical properties, thereby influencing a variety of cell processes (Holzer et al., 2011Holzer R.G. Park E.J. Li N. Tran H. Chen M. Choi C. Solinas G. Karin M.

In normal tissues, tissue-restricted adult stem cells undergo rapid self-renewal and differentiation to maintain tissue homeostasis. Whether changes in phospholipid or cholesterol metabolism or membrane composition may affect stem cell function is not well understood. The small intestine is an excellent model system to study adult stem cell biology. Vigorous self-renewal of the intestinal epithelium is essential for optimal gut function. A small number of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in the crypts continuously divide to produce daughter stem cells and highly proliferative progenitor cells called transit-amplifying (TA) cells (Barker, 2014Barker N. Adult intestinal stem cells: Critical drivers of epithelial homeostasis and regeneration.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2014; 15: 19-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). The latter migrate from the crypt and differentiate into all of the cell types in the intestinal villi, including absorptive enterocytes, secretory goblet cells, enteroendocrine cells, and Paneth cells. Proper balance between ISC self-renewal and differentiation is crucial to preserve the integrity of the intestinal epithelium and maintain its homeostasis (Simons and Clevers, 2011Simons B.D. Clevers H. Strategies for homeostatic stem cell self-renewal in adult tissues.Cell. 2011; 145: 851-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Dysregulation of intestinal homeostasis is known to cause severe intestinal pathologies, including cancer. ISCs have been shown to be the cells of origin for the intestinal tumors that develop in mice carrying mutations in tumor suppressor gene adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) (Barker et al., 2009Barker N.

Prior studies have suggested links between phospholipid metabolism and intestinal tumorigenesis, although the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. Polymorphisms in the secretory phospholipase A2 (Pla2g2a) gene, which encodes an enzyme catalyzing the deacylation of sn-2 fatty acids during phospholipid remodeling, influences the incidence of intestinal tumors in Apc multiple intestinal neoplasia (Min) mice (Dietrich et al., 1993Dietrich W.F. Lander E.S. Smith J.S. Moser A.R. Gould K.A. Luongo C. Borenstein N. Dove W.

Loss of Pla2g2a function increases Apcmin-induced tumor number (Kennedy et al., 1995Kennedy B.P. Payette P. Mudgett J. Vadas P. Pruzanski W. Kwan M. Tang C. Rancourt D.E. Cromlish W.A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22378-22385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), whereas overexpression of Pla2g2a reduces tumor multiplicity and size (Cormier et al., 1997Cormier R.T. Hong K.H. Halberg R.B. Hawkins T.L. Richardson P. Mulherkar R. Dove W.F. Lander E.S. Secretory phospholipase Pla2g2a confers resistance to intestinal tumorigenesis.Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In contrast, deletion of another phospholipase A2 member, cytosolic phospholipase A2 (Pla2g4) has been reported to suppress Apcmin-induced tumorigenesis (Hong et al., 2001Hong K.H. Bonventre J.C. O’Leary E. Bonventre J.V. Lander E.S. Deletion of cytosolic phospholipase A(2) suppresses Apc(Min)-induced tumorigenesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 3935-3939Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Although it is still unknown how these phospholipases affect tumor initiation and growth, such studies suggest that phospholipid remodeling may be involved in intestinal tumorigenesis. Similarly, cholesterol consumption has long been associated with increased gastrointestinal cancer risk in epidemiological studies (Järvinen et al., 2001Järvinen R. Knekt P. Hakulinen T. Rissanen H. Heliövaara M. Dietary fat, cholesterol and colorectal cancer in a prospective study.Br. J. Cancer. 2001; 85: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar); however, the causal mechanisms have been largely unexplored. Given that ISCs are the cells of origin of intestinal tumors, it is reasonable to speculate that phospholipid remodeling and cholesterol availability may contribute to tumorigenesis by modulating ISC function. In this study, we investigated whether and how phospholipid and cholesterol metabolism regulate the proliferation of ISC and progenitor cells. We recently identified the phospholipid- remodeling enzyme, lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (Lpcat3), as a critical determinant of membrane phospholipid composition (Rong et al., 2013Rong X. Albert C.J. Hong C. Duerr M.A. Chamberlain B.T. Tarling E.J. Ito A. Gao J. Wang B. Edwards P.A. et al.LXRs regulate ER stress and inflammation through dynamic modulation of membrane phospholipid composition.Cell Metab. 2013; 18: 685-697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Lpcat3 catalyzes the incorporation of polyunsaturated fatty acids at the sn-2 site of lysophospholipids, giving rise to polyunsaturated phospholipids. Loss of Lpcat3 selectively reduces polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholine (PC) in membranes, resulting in decreased membrane fluidity (Rong et al., 2015Rong X. Wang B. Dunham M.M. Hedde P.N. Wong J.S. Gratton E. Young S.G. Ford D.A. Tontonoz P. Lpcat3-dependent production of arachidonoyl phospholipids is a key determinant of triglyceride secretion.eLife. 2015; 4 (Published online March 25, 2015)https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06557Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar, Wang et al., 2016Wang B. Rong X. Duerr M.A. Hermanson D.J. Hedde P.N. Wong J.S. Vallim T.Q. Cravatt B.F. Gratton E. Ford D.A. Tontonoz P. Intestinal phospholipid remodeling is required for dietary-lipid uptake and survival on a high-fat diet.Cell Metab. 2016; 23: 492-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Here, we show that Lpcat3 deficiency in intestine enhances ISC proliferation through induction of cholesterol biosynthesis. We demonstrate that cholesterol acts as a mitogen for ISCs and that increasing cellular cholesterol content is sufficient to drive stem cell proliferation both in vivo and ex vivo. Finally, we show that loss of Lpcat3 or activation of SREBP-2 in Apcmin mice markedly promote intestinal tumor formation. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized link between phospholipid remodeling and cholesterol metabolism that modulates ISC homeostasis and tumorigenesis. In the course of characterizing intestine-specific Lpcat3-deficient mice (Lpcat3F/F, CreVil) (Wang et al., 2016Wang B. Rong X. Duerr M.A. Hermanson D.J. Hedde P.N. Wong J.S. Vallim T.Q. Cravatt B.F. Gratton E. Ford D.A. Tontonoz P. Intestinal phospholipid remodeling is required for dietary-lipid uptake and survival on a high-fat diet.Cell Metab. 2016; 23: 492-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), we noted mucosal hypertrophy in the duodenum and jejunum with profound lengthening of villi and longer small intestines. Since hypertrophy of villi is often observed as a compensatory enlargement of the absorptive surface in response to malabsorption, we conducted further studies to investigate whether this phenotype was a direct or indirect consequence of Lpcat3 deletion in intestinal epithelium. To circumvent the problem of developmental compensation, we crossed Lpcat3-floxed mice with inducible villin-Cre mice (el Marjou et al., 2004el Marjou F. Janssen K.P. Chang B.H. Li M. Hindie V. Chan L. Louvard D. Chambon P. Metzger D. Robine S. Tissue-specific and inducible Cre-mediated recombination in the gut epithelium.Genesis. 2004; 39: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar) to generate tamoxifen-inducible intestine-specific knockout mice (Lpcat3F/F, CreERT2). At 8 weeks of age, we treated Lpcat3F/F and Lpcat3F/F, CreERT2 mice with tamoxifen to activate Cre recombinase activity. Real-time PCR confirmed >90% reduction in Lpcat3 mRNA in knockout intestines 3 weeks after tamoxifen injection (Figure S1A). Lpcat3 expression remained very low in Lpcat3F/F, CreERT2 mice, even 14 weeks post-injection (Figure S1G), indicating that Cre recombinase was also activated in the ISC population (considering the rapid turnover of intestinal epithelium). Acute Lpcat3 inactivation induced a rapid loss of body weight (up to 10%), but the mice regained body weight after 2∼3 weeks (Figure S1B). Similar to constitutive Lpcat3F/Fl, CreVil mice, the length and diameter of Lpcat3F/F, CreERT2 intestines were longer and wider than those of control intestines (Figures S1C and S1D). Although histological analysis did not show multiple branched villi, acute loss of Lpcat3 induced expanded crypt height, indicating hyperproliferation of crypts (Figure 1A). Quantification revealed an approximate 2-fold increase in crypt height and a slight increase in villus length in Lpcat3F/F, CreERT2 mice compared to floxed littermate controls (Figure 1B). There was no change in crypt density (Figure S1E). Similar phenotypes were observed in female mice and male mice even 14 weeks after tamoxifen injection (Figures S1F and S1G–S1I). The fact that these changes appeared after tamoxifen treatment in adult Lpcat3F/F, CreERT2 mice fed a low-fat chow diet suggested that they were unlikely to be secondary to altered lipid absorption. To further investigate potential intrinsic effects of Lpcat3 activity on crypt proliferation and epithelial turnover, we examined the incorporation and migration of ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU)-labeled cells at 2, 24, and 48 hr after EdU pulse labeling (Figure 1C). As shown in Figure 1C, there was ∼3-fold increase in EdU-positive proliferating cells in crypts of Lpcat3F/F, CreERT2 mice, and these proliferative cells migrated much higher along the villus than they did in their control counterparts. Specifically, at 24 hr EdU-labeled cells migrated to the tip of villi in Lpcat3F/F, CreERT2 intestines, while they reached only 1/3 of the villus height in control intestines. To assess the impact of Lpcat3 deficiency on ISC frequency and differentiation, we performed immunostaining for several cell markers in tamoxifen-treated control and Lpcat3F/F, CreERT2 mice. Immunohistochemistry analysis for Olfactomedin 4 (Olfm4), a marker of Lgr5+ ISCs (van der Flier et al., 2009van der Flier L.G. Haegebarth A. Stange D.E. van de Wetering M. Clevers H. OLFM4 is a robust marker for stem cells in human intestine and marks a subset of colorectal cancer cells.Gastroenterology. 2009; 137: 15-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), showed an ∼53% increase in Olfm4+ cells in Lpcat3F/F, CreERT2 jejunum compared to those in Lpcat3F/F controls (Figure 1D). Similarly, immunostaining for Id1, a marker of both stem cells and progenitor cells (Zhang et al., 2014Zhang N. Yantiss R.K. Nam H.S. Chin Y. Zhou X.K. Scherl E.J. Bosworth B.P. Subbaramaiah K. Dannenberg A.J. Benezra R. ID1 is a functional marker for intestinal stem and progenitor cells required for normal response to injury.Stem Cell Reports. 2014; 3: 716-724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), revealed an ∼2-fold increase in Id1+ cells in Lpcat3-deficient intestines compared to controls (Figure 1E), suggesting that both ISCs and progenitor cells were hyperproliferative. Increased numbers of Id1+ cells were also observed in Lpcat3F/F, CreERT2 colon (Figure S1J). By contrast, loss of Lpcat3 reduced the frequency of Lysozyme+ Paneth cells and PAS+ goblet cells by 52% and 35%, respectively (Figures S2A and S2B), whereas the frequency of chromogranin A1 (ChgA)+ enteroendocrine cells were not affected (Figure S2C). We did not observe a change in inflammatory cytokine expression in enterocytes of Lpcat3-deficient mice (Figure S2D). To further investigate the effect of Lpcat3 deficiency on the proliferation of ISCs, we employed an ex vivo culture system to assess the ability of isolated intestinal crypts to form organoids in 3-D culture as described previously (Sato et al., 2009Sato T. Vries R.G. Snippert H.J. van de Wetering M. Barker N. Stange D.E. van Es J.H. Abo A. Kujala P. Peters P.J. Clevers H. Single Lgr5 stem cells build crypt-villus structures in vitro without a mesenchymal niche.Nature. 2009; 459: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (4122) Google Scholar). Consistent with crypt hyperproliferation in vivo, loss of Lpcat3 led to an increase in size, number, and complexity (higher number of buds) of organoids (Figures 2A–2D). Thus, loss of Lpcat3 enhanced ISC proliferation both in vivo and ex vivo, demonstrating that the effects were intrinsic to the ISCs. To gain insight into how the enzymatic activity of Lpcat3 was linked to ISC proliferation, we performed lipidomic analyses on isolated crypts. Consistent with our previous observations in enterocytes, Lpcat3 deficiency in crypts selectively decreased polyunsaturated (18:2- and 20:4-containing) PC, concomitant with an increase in saturated and monosaturated PC (Figure S3A). Total PC content was not altered by Lpcat3 deficiency (Figure S3B). Arachidonic acid (AA) is a substrate for prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) biosynthesis catalyzed by cyclooxygenases (Cox-1 and Cox-2). Prior studies have demonstrated that PGE2 augments ISC function to facilitate regeneration after injury (Cohn et al., 1997Cohn S.M. Schloemann S. Tessner T. Seibert K. Stenson W.F. Crypt stem cell survival in the mouse intestinal epithelium is regulated by prostaglandins synthesized through cyclooxygenase-1.J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1367-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, Houchen et al., 2000Houchen C.W. Stenson W.F. Cohn S.M.

Prostaglandin E2 promotes intestinal repair through an adaptive cellular response of the epithelium.EMBO J. 2017; 36: 5-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Given that loss of Lpcat3 might lead to an accumulation of AA, we considered the possibility that increased PGE2 production could be involved in Lpcat3 deficiency-induced ISC proliferation. However, the expression of the PGE2 biosynthetic enzymes Cox-1 and Cox-2 was not altered by Lpcat3 deficiency (Figure S3C), and PGE2 levels were decreased rather than increased in Lpcat3-deficient intestines (Figure S3D). Thus, Lpcat3-dependent ISC hyperproliferation was unlikely to be mediated by PGE2. The above findings suggested that the change in ISC proliferation in Lpcat3F/F, CreERT2 mice was caused by the change in membrane phospholipid composition per se. We therefore assessed the effects of different PC species on crypt organoid growth. We treated crypt cultures with liposomes containing saturated (16:0/18:0) or polyunsaturated (16:0/20:4) PC. Treatment with liposomes containing 16:0/20:4 PC significantly reduced the size, complexity, and colony formation efficiency in organoids derived from Lpcat3-deficient crypts (Figures 2E–2H). Interestingly, compared to treatment with PBS control, saturated 16:0/18:0 PC treatment increased organoid size, without affecting their structure or number. We next assessed the effect of different PC species on the self-renewal capacity of ISCs by passaging the primary organoids in the presence of PC treatment. As shown in Figure 2I, Lpcat3-deficient primary organoids generated more secondary organoids than wild-type (WT) primary organoids. Moreover, exposure of the cells to 16:0/20:4 PC liposomes reduced secondary organoid formation in Lpcat3-deficient organoids. By contrast, neither saturated nor polyunsaturated PC affected the growth or self-renewal of organoids from WT crypts (Figures 2E–2I). These findings are consistent with the expectation that active Lpcat3 in WT cells continuously remodels phospholipids to maintain their composition. Together, these data directly implicate membrane phospholipid composition as a determinant of ISC proliferation and self-renewal. To begin to explore mechanisms underlying crypt hyperproliferation in the absence of Lpcat3, we analyzed the expression of genes involved in several signaling pathways known to promote ISC proliferation, including Wnt, Notch, and Yap pathways (Fevr et al., 2007Fevr T. Robine S. Louvard D. Huelsken J. Wnt/beta-catenin is essential for intestinal homeostasis and maintenance of intestinal stem cells.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 7551-7559Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, Gregorieff et al., 2015Gregorieff A. Liu Y. Inanlou M.R. Khomchuk Y. Wrana J.L.

Carulli A.J. Keeley T.M. Patel S.R. Puthoff B.J. Magness S.T. Tran I.T. Maillard I. Siebel C. Kolterud Å. et al.Notch signaling modulates proliferation and differentiation of intestinal crypt base columnar stem cells.Development. 2012; 139: 488-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Expression of mRNAs encoding mediators in these pathways was not altered in Lpcat3-deficient crypts compared to controls (Figures S4A and S4B). The PPARδ pathway has recently been implicated in regulating ISC proliferation during high-fat diet feeding (Beyaz et al., 2016Beyaz S. Mana M.D. Roper J. Kedrin D. Saadatpour A. Hong S.J. Bauer-Rowe K.E. Xifaras M.E. Akkad A. Arias E. et al.High-fat diet enhances stemness and tumorigenicity of intestinal progenitors.Nature. 2016; 531: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). We found no change in the expression of PPARδ target genes between Lpcat3-deficient and control crypts (Figure S4C). These data collectively suggested that alternative mechanisms were likely to be driving proliferation in the absence of Lpcat3. To uncover such mechanisms and to determine the consequence of loss of Lpcat3 activity for intestinal cell gene expression, we profiled gene expression in crypts isolated from WT and Lpcat3-deficient mice. Strikingly, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed strong enrichment for genes involved in sterol biosynthetic processes in the absence of Lpcat3 (Figure 3A). Expression of the majority of the genes in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway was increased by ∼1.5- to ∼2.6 fold (Figure 3B). These changes were validated by real-time PCR (Figure 3C). Similarly, expression of several cholesterol biosynthetic genes was also upregulated in Lpcat3-deficient colons (Figure S4D). Western blot analysis revealed a marked increase in nuclear SREBP-2 in Lpcat3-deficient crypts (Figure 3D), suggesting that post-transcriptional activation of SREBP-2 likely drive the enhanced expression of cholesterol biosynthesis. Interestingly, the effect of Lpcat3 deficiency was selective for SREBP-2 compared to SREBP-1 target genes. There was only a slight increase in Srebf1c and Fasn expression, while the expression of other SREBP-1 target genes was not altered (Figure S4E). In agreement with the augmented cholesterol biosynthetic gene expression, free cholesterol content was increased by ∼25% in Lpcat3-deficient crypts compared to controls (Figure 3E). To exclude the possibility that augmented cholesterol biosynthesis was secondary to chronic metabolic changes as a result of higher proliferation, we tested the consequences of acute suppression of Lpcat3 expression ex vivo. We isolated crypts from Lpcat3F/F and Lpcat3F/F, CreERT2 mice and induced Cre recombinase activity in the presence of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT). 4-OHT treatment in organoids from Lpcat3F/F, CreERT2 crypts increased expression of a battery of cholesterol biosynthetic genes compared to those treated with DMSO control (Figure 3F). As expected, 4-OHT treatment had no effect in organoids from Lpcat3F/F crypts. Consistent with our observations in vivo, Srebf1 target genes were negligibly affected by acute loss of Lpcat3 ex vivo (Figure S4F). These data suggest that cholesterol biosynthesis is directly coupled with phospholipid remodeling in the intestine. To determine whether there might be a functional relationship between cholesterol biosynthesis and crypt hyperproliferation, we first tested whether blocking cholesterol biosynthesis could rescue the phenotype. Indeed, suppression of cholesterol biosynthesis by low dose simvastatin (an Hmgcr inhibitor; 1 μM) or Ro 48-8071 (an Lss inhibitor, 1 μM) treatment inhibited the growth of Lpcat3F/F, CreERT2 crypts (Figure 4A). Supplementation of the cultures with mevalonate at levels sufficient to permit protein prenylation but not sterol synthesis (Rowell et al., 1997Rowell C.A. Kowalczyk J.J. Lewis M.D. Garcia A.M. Direct demonstration of geranylgeranylation and farnesylation of Ki-Ras in vivo.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14093-14097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) did not rescue the inhibition by either Simvastatin or Ro 48-8071. By contrast, administration of cholesterol, but not epicholesterol, fully rescued organoid growth (Figures 4A and S5A), confirming that sterol synthesis is required for crypt proliferation ex vivo. Next, we examined whether inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis could normalize crypt hyperproliferation in vivo. We gavaged tamoxifen-injected Lpcat3F/F and Lpcat3F/F, CreERT2 mice with Ro 48-8071, which has previously been shown to suppress cholesterol biosynthesis in intestine (Chuang et al., 2014Chuang J.C. Valasek M.A. Lopez A.M. Posey K.S. Repa J.J. Turley S.D. Sustained and selective suppression of intestinal cholesterol synthesis by Ro 48-8071, an inhibitor of 2,3-oxidosqualene:lanosterol cyclase, in the BALB/c mouse.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2014; 88: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Histological analysis revealed an appreciable decrease in crypt height in Lpcat3F/F, CreERT2 mice treated with Ro 48-8071 compared to those treated with vehicle control (Figure 4B). Quantification showed an ∼15% decrease in crypt height, while villus length was not affected by Ro 48-8071 treatment (Figures 4B and S5B). In contrast to Lpcat3F/F, CreERT2 mice, no overt histological differences were observed in Lpcat3F/F control mice treated with Ro 48-8071 and vehicle. EdU-labeling analysis demonstrated an even more pronounced effect of Ro 48-8071 on ISC and progenitor cell proliferation. There was an ∼45% decrease in EdU-positive proliferating cells in Lpcat3-deficient mice treated with Ro 48-8071 compared to those treated with vehicle (Figure 4C). Again, no difference was observed in Lpcat3F/F control mice between Ro 48-8071 and vehicle treatment. More importantly, Ro 48-8071 treatment reduced the number of Olfm4+ and Id1+ ISCs and progenitor cells in Lpcat3F/F, CreERT2 intestines but had no effect in Lpcat3F/F control intestines (Figures 4D, S5C, and S5G). The frequency of Paneth cells and goblet cells was not affected by Ro 48-8071 treatment (Figures S5D and S5E). Furthermore, the inhibition of crypt proliferation by Ro 48-8071 was not secondary to increased cell apoptosis, because there was no difference in cleaved caspase-3 immunostaining between groups (Figure S5F). Thus, inhibition of endogenous cholesterol synthesis partially rescued the hyperproliferation observed in the setting of Lpcat3 deficiency, consistent with the hypothesis that excess cholesterol synthesis was driving proliferation in this context. Importantly, however, inhibition of cholesterol synthesis did not impair normal crypt proliferation in control mice, likely due to the availability of sufficient exogenous cholesterol to support the normal rate of proliferation. We next tested whether increasing cellular cholesterol content per se was sufficient to promote crypt proliferation. We cultured crypts isolated from C57BL/6 mice in the presence of cyclodextrin-cholesterol complexes to forcibly load the cells with excess cholesterol (Christian et al., 1997Christian A.E.

From this early work, it was inferred that the adult brain retains a population of neural stem cells (NSCs) with long-term self-renewal properties. NSCs have been identified in two regions of the adult mammalian brain, the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) in the walls of the lateral ventricles and in the subgranular zone (SGZ) next to the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus (for reviews, see Gage, 2002Gage F.H.

Both regions, which significantly differ in their organization and types of neurons they produce, sustain the generation of young neurons throughout life in mice. NSCs in the adult V-SVZ are derived from radial glia (RG) during mid-embryonic development (Fuentealba et al., 2015Fuentealba L.C. Rompani S.B. Parraguez J.I. Obernier K. Romero R. Cepko C.L.

V-SVZ NSCs correspond to a subpopulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)+ astroglial cells (B1 cells; Doetsch et al., 1999Doetsch F. Caillé I. Lim D.A. García-Verdugo J.M. Alvarez-Buylla A.

The mechanism of NSC retention is key to understanding how neurogenesis is sustained for extended periods of time. Somatic stem cells can be maintained and generate progeny through asymmetric divisions or by symmetric self-renewal and symmetric differentiation (Morrison and Kimble, 2006Morrison S.J. Kimble J.

Recent data suggest that the majority of NSCs in the adult SGZ (Bonaguidi et al., 2011Bonaguidi M.A. Wheeler M.A. Shapiro J.S. Stadel R.P. Sun G.J. Ming G.-L. Song H.

Michel J. Baumgart E.V. Theis F. Götz M. Ninkovic J. Fast clonal expansion and limited neural stem cell self-renewal in the adult subependymal zone.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 490-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) undergo asymmetric cell division—similar to embryonic RG (Noctor et al., 2004Noctor S.C. Martínez-Cerdeño V. Ivic L. Kriegstein A.R. Cortical neurons arise in symmetric and asymmetric division zones and migrate through specific phases.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar), yet direct evidence for the division mode of adult NSCs is missing. Here, we used short-term and long-term lineage-tracing methods and show that NSC retention in the adult mouse V-SVZ and sustained production of OB neurons are mainly achieved through symmetric divisions. The majority of NSCs become consumed by the symmetric generation of C cells; a smaller fraction of NSCs symmetrically divides to self-renew, a mode of division directly shown by ex vivo live imaging. After their self-renewal, NSCs can remain in the V-SVZ for up to 16 weeks (and beyond) before they symmetrically generate C cells and become consumed. Thus, V-SVZ/OB neurogenesis is mainly sustained by population asymmetry of bona fide NSCs. To investigate whether NSCs touching the LV (B1 cells) self-renew, we stereotaxically injected replication-incompetent ASLV long terminal repeat with a splice acceptor (RCAS) retrovirus expressing GFP (RCAS-GFP) into the LV of postnatal (postnatal day 21 [P21]–P30) hGFAP::Tva mice (Doetsch et al., 1999Doetsch F.

USA. 1998; 95: 1218-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar; Figure 1A; note: one daughter cell will express GFP as RCAS integrates during M phase). Two to seven days (d2–d7) after injection, we analyzed the entire V-SVZ in whole-mount preparations. On average, we found 6 ± 2.7 clones/whole mount (5.6 ± 0.4 mm2), indicating sparse clonal labeling (Table S2; Figures S1A–S1C). We found clones consisting of single GFP+ cells or discrete and tightly packed cell clusters (Figure 1; neuroblasts that had migrated away were not included in our analysis). The majority of clones contained only C cells (137/171 clones in n = 32 whole mounts; d2–d7; Figures 1D–1F), suggesting that the majority of dividing NSCs had undergone lineage progression. As expected (Ponti et al., 2013Ponti G. Obernier K. Guinto C. Jose L. Bonfanti L. Alvarez-Buylla A. Cell cycle and lineage progression of neural progenitors in the ventricular-subventricular zones of adult mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: E1045-E1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), C cells divided about once a day, increasing the size of C cell clusters over the first four days (Figure 1C). Consistent with the progression of C cells to neuroblasts, we observed a rapid accumulation of GFP+ neuroblasts after four days, increasing the total number of GFP+ cells (Figures 1B, 1F, and S1E). We also identified clones consisting only of NSCs, indicating self-renewal of B1 cells (33/171 clones; Figures 2B and 2C ). The majority were single NSCs (secondary NSCs), and 5 out of 33 NSC clones consisted of pairs of (tertiary) NSCs (Figure 2D). Interestingly, four of these pairs were found at later time points (d4–d7: 4/15 NSC clones in pairs) and one on d2–d3 (1/18 NSC clones in pairs). This suggests that, within a week, a subpopulation of secondary NSCs underwent symmetric self-renewal. We also found one mixed clone containing an NSC and C cells on d5 (1/171 clones; Figure S1G). We next estimated the proportion of self-renewing versus C-cell-generating divisions on d2–d3 before the peak in neuroblast generation. We found 18 GFP+ NSC clones and 56 GFP+ C cell clusters, accounting for ∼25% and ∼75% of all divisions, respectively (n = 16 mice; Tables S1 and S2). We also injected RCAS at P60 and analyzed whole mounts on d3 (n = 3). We found one secondary GFP+ NSC and 20 clusters containing only GFP+ C cells. To determine whether self-renewing cells are bona fide NSCs and can divide again to generate progeny or self-renew, we analyzed the V-SVZ two or four weeks after RCAS injection at P21. In addition to 27 secondary NSCs, we found six pairs of tertiary NSCs and one triplet (also see below; Figure S5C; Table S1). This suggests that secondary NSCs, produced at the time of RCAS injection, continued to divide and self-renewed symmetrically for up to a month, generating pairs of tertiary NSCs. We also found 16 clusters of C cells. As C cells rapidly differentiate into neuroblasts that leave the V-SVZ within a few days, clusters found two or four weeks after RCAS injection originated from reactivated secondary or tertiary NSCs. Strikingly, the majority of C cell clusters were devoid of NSCs (∼75%; 12/16 clusters; Figures 2E and 2F). Four clusters were mixed (Figure S5B) and could either be derived from asymmetric cell division of secondary NSCs or asynchronous reactivation of pairs of tertiary NSCs. These data suggest that the majority of dividing NSCs generate C cells and a smaller number self-renew. However, due to RCAS labeling only one daughter cell, it is unclear whether clones observed at short survivals resulted from symmetric or asymmetric divisions. To label both daughter cells, we used sparse CRE/loxP labeling (Bonaguidi et al., 2011Bonaguidi M.A. Wheeler M.A. Shapiro J.S. Stadel R.P. Sun G.J. Ming G.-L. Song H.

First, to ensure that clusters of C cells were the result of lineage-traced NSCs (and not C cells), we labeled their embryonic predecessor, NESTIN+ RG (Fuentealba et al., 2015Fuentealba L.C.

At both ages, we observed pairs of NSCs (not shown); however, their origin is unclear as they could be derived from symmetric divisions of RG (Fuentealba et al., 2015Fuentealba L.C. Rompani S.B.

The majority of clusters of tdTOMATO (tdT)+ C cells were devoid of NSCs (∼60%–70%; P21: 8/11; P60: 8/13; Figures 3B, S2B, and S2C). Thus, long-term lineage tracing suggests that the vast majority of NSCs divide symmetrically. Asymmetric cell division is rare or does not occur: mixed clusters with longer survivals could be derived from asynchronous reactivation of sister NSCs around the time of analysis. We next induced sparse expression of the reporter tdT in GFAP+ cells at P21 in hGFAP::CreERT2;Ai14 mice (Casper et al., 2007Casper K.B. Jones K. McCarthy K.D. Characterization of astrocyte-specific conditional knockouts.Genesis. 2007; 45: 292-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To further ensure clonal events were derived from dividing progenitors, mice received 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) in the drinking water for three days prior to analysis (Figure 3C). Only samples with less than six tdT+BrdU+ clusters per whole-mount were included in the analysis (Figure 3D’; Table S3). On d3, we found 15 tdT+BrdU+ clusters of C cells, and none contained NSCs (Table S3). Consistent with CREERT2-induced recombination labeling both daughter cells, tdT+BrdU+ C cell clusters contained on average ∼2-fold more cells than those in our RCAS experiment (Figure 3D). This suggests that C cells were produced by consuming divisions of NSCs. In a separate experiment, we further lowered Tx concentration to obtain labeling of less than one clonal event per hemisphere (Table S4). In mice analyzed on d1, d3, or d7, we found 21 C cell clusters, all devoid of NSCs (Figures S2G–S2J; Table S4; n = 35 hemispheres from 26 mice). The percentage of tdT+BrdU+ C cell clusters over the total number of (quiescent, BrdU−) tdT+ NSCs increased ∼3-fold from d1–d3 to d7 (Figure S2K; Table S4). The number of C cell clusters/hemisphere does not significantly change during this period (Figure S2K; Table S4), indicating that C cell clusters must arise from recombined NSCs, which continuously undergo activation and consumption. C cell clusters were also devoid of NSCs when Tx and 3d BrdU were given at P21 to hGFAP::CreERT2;confetti mice (Snippert et al., 2010Snippert H.J. van der Flier L.G. Sato T. van Es J.H. van den Born M. Kroon-Veenboer C. Barker N. Klein A.M. van Rheenen J. Simons B.D. Clevers H. Intestinal crypt homeostasis results from neutral competition between symmetrically dividing Lgr5 stem cells.Cell. 2010; 143: 134-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar; 12 C cell clusters; Figures 3H–3J) or to hGFAP::CreERT2;Ai14 mice at P60 or P180 (15 C cell clusters and 8 C cell clusters, respectively; Figures 3E and 3F). The level of cell death among NSCs was extremely low (∼one CLEAVED-CASPASE-3+GFP+ NSC per lateral wall in GFAP::GFP mice; Figure S2L). It is therefore unlikely that elimination of cells would mask asymmetric cell divisions. Altogether, these data indicate that, in the juvenile, adult, and aged V-SVZ, the majority—if not all—of C cells are generated at the expense of NSCs. Whole-mounts of hGFAP::CreERT2;Ai14 mice three days after Tx and BrdU administration at P21, P60, or P180 also contained pairs of double-labeled NSCs (three NSC pairs at P21, two at P60, and one pair at P180; Figures 3K and 3L; Table S3). This indicates that a subpopulation of NSCs (at P21: ∼17%) divided symmetrically, possibly a mechanism of self-renewal, and is consistent with pairs of tertiary NSCs in our RCAS experiment above (Figure 2D). Thus, our data indicate that the majority of GFAP+ NSCs—if not all—divide symmetrically: most are consumed by the generation of C cells and about 1/5 symmetrically self-renews. Given their complex morphology, how can NSCs divide symmetrically to generate two NSCs? To directly observe the behavior of NSCs within their niche, we performed ex vivo time-lapse imaging on organotypic whole-mount cultures from hGFAP::CreERT2;Ai14 or hGFAP::CreERT2;Ai14;FucciS/G2/M mice (Sakaue-Sawano et al., 2008Sakaue-Sawano A. Kurokawa H. Morimura T. Hanyu A. Hama H. Osawa H. Kashiwagi S. Fukami K. Miyata T. Miyoshi H. et al.Visualizing spatiotemporal dynamics of multicellular cell-cycle progression.Cell. 2008; 132: 487-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar) for four days (Figures 4A, S3A, and S3D). NSCs frequently extended and retracted lateral processes and occasionally shifted the position of their basal endfoot along the vascular surface (Figure 4D’). Similar to in vivo (Figures S3G and S3H), we observed that NSCs had cell-cell interactions with neighboring dividing (Fucci+) cells (green arrowheads in Figures 4C and 4D”). We recorded 23 dividing tdT+ NSCs, which maintained their basal processes and generated GFAP+ASCL1− daughter cells that outgrew a new basal process (Figures 4B, 4C, and 4E; Movies S1 and S2). None of these cells divided any further within up to 65 hr after the initial division. We also recorded lineage progression of C cells (Figure S3E; data not shown). C cells divided on average every 17.2 ± 6.7 hr, three or four times before giving rise to A cells, which is consistent with the above in vivo data and previous findings (Ponti et al., 2013Ponti G. Obernier K. Guinto C. Jose L. Bonfanti L. Alvarez-Buylla A. Cell cycle and lineage progression of neural progenitors in the ventricular-subventricular zones of adult mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: E1045-E1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Interestingly, initiation of lineages can occur after a lag phase of about two days (Figure S3E) and the cells on top of the lineages lacked a basal process typical for NSCs. Surprisingly, we observed six NSCs retracting their basal processes; two of these cells divided ∼2 days later at the end of the imaging period, generating cells that lacked basal processes (Figure S3F). NSCs primed to generate progeny may lose the basal process before symmetrically generating C cells, whereas NSCs undergoing symmetric self-renewal maintain the basal process as they divide. Taken together, ex vivo imaging demonstrates that a subpopulation of NSCs divides symmetrically, generating daughter cells that can inherit/grow a basal process. This is consistent with our in vivo findings of pairs of NSCs, indicating that a subpopulation of NSCs undergoes symmetric self-renewal. We hypothesize that the preponderance of consuming divisions reduces the number of NSCs over time. We counted the numbers of apical contacts of B1 cells in whole-mounts at different ages (P21, P60, P180, and P360; Figures 5A and 5B ). The overall density of B1 cells was ∼4-fold higher at P21 compared to P60 (Figures 5A, 5B, and 5D). Similar results were obtained when comparing P60 to P360, consistent with previous reports (Shook et al., 2012Shook B.A. Manz D.H. Peters J.J. Kang S. Conover J.C. Spatiotemporal changes to the subventricular zone stem cell pool through aging.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 6947-6956Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We used the B1 cell numbers obtained experimentally (Figure 5D) and mathematically modeled their decline from P21 to P60 with symmetric divisions using coupled ordinary differentiation equations (see STAR Methods). The model predicts that, in order to attain the decline in B1 cell numbers seen in vivo, the probability of consumption (pc) must exceed the probability of symmetric self-renewal (ps) with pc − ps = 0.4. With ps = 0.3 and pc = 0.7, the level of consuming divisions (∼70%) is similar to our short-term lineage tracings (Table S1), indicating that dynamics within the B1 cell population can be explained by symmetric divisions. Interestingly, whereas B1 cells drastically decline over time, the generation of newborn neurons was less affected by the age of the mouse. Mice received BrdU in their drinking water for one week at different ages (P21, P49, P77, P105, P116, P180, and P360), and the densities of newborn neurons in the OB granule cell layer were quantified four weeks later. The number of newborn neurons decreased dramatically over time (Figures 5C and 5D). However, this decline did not follow the same dynamics than the decline in B1 cells (Figure 5D; also see Figure S4A and Discussion). For example, compared to P21, the density of B1 cells at P180 declined by 95.6% ± 2.8% whereas the density of BrdU+ granule neurons generated around this age declined by 65.5% ± 4.7% (Figure 5D). We conclude that the preponderance of consuming divisions in the V-SVZ leads to a drastic decline in B1 cells as the organism ages. Neurogenesis also declines with age but at a slower rate compared to the decline in B1 cells. Our data indicate that NSCs can self-renew symmetrically. To investigate whether the daughter cells correspond to B1 cells, we studied the apical surface of GFP+ NSCs three days, two weeks, or four weeks after RCAS injection at P21 (Figure 6A). On d3, we found 10 GFP+ secondary NSCs with a small apical ending in the center of a pinwheel, indicating self-renewal of B1 cells (Figure 6B). However, we also found two GFP+ NSCs that had a long basal process contacting blood vessels but lacked contact with the LV. Surprisingly, two and four weeks after virus injection, only half of the GFP+ NSCs with long basal processes contacted the LV (5/8 cells at two weeks and 17/32 cells at four weeks; Figures 6C and 6D). Non-apical GFP+ NSCs were sometimes located in the SVZ below the layer of neuroblasts (Figure 6C’). These cells had astrocytic properties with basal processes, and about half were GFAP+ (5/11; Figure S5E). Interestingly, besides pairs of B1 cells, we found pairs of non-apical NSCs (Figure S5D) and a triplet consisting of one B1 cell and a pair of non-apical NSCs in close proximity (Figure S5C). Our data suggest that GFP+ B1 cells give rise to non-apical NSCs. The apical process of B1 cells can be very thin, which could challenge their detection using confocal microscopy. We therefore used electron microscopy (EM) and serial 3D reconstruction to study label-retaining cells (LRCs) four weeks after 3H-thymidine injections at P21 or P60 (Figures 6E, 6F, and S5F). Ultrastructural analysis confirmed the presence of apical B1 cells (Figure S5G) and astrocytic non-apical LRCs (Figures 6I” and 6I”) expressing GFAP (Figure 6N). Non-apical LRCs had lateral and basal processes (Figures 6G–6I) and occasionally contacted BVs (Figure 6I) and fractones (Kerever et al., 2007Kerever A. Schnack J. Vellinga D. Ichikawa N. Moon C.

https://openalex.org/W2786107072,"The mechanisms instructing genesis of neuronal subtypes from mammalian neural precursors are not well understood. To address this issue, we have characterized the transcriptional landscape of radial glial precursors (RPs) in the embryonic murine cortex. We show that individual RPs express mRNA, but not protein, for transcriptional specifiers of both deep and superficial layer cortical neurons. Some of these mRNAs, including the superficial versus deep layer neuron transcriptional regulators Brn1 and Tle4, are translationally repressed by their association with the RNA-binding protein Pumilio2 (Pum2) and the 4E-T protein. Disruption of these repressive complexes in RPs mid-neurogenesis by knocking down 4E-T or Pum2 causes aberrant co-expression of deep layer neuron specification proteins in newborn superficial layer neurons. Thus, cortical RPs are transcriptionally primed to generate diverse types of neurons, and a Pum2/4E-T complex represses translation of some of these neuronal identity mRNAs to ensure appropriate temporal specification of daughter neurons."

When listening to a sound of interest, we frequently look at the source. However, how auditory and visual information are integrated to form a coherent perceptual object is unknown. The temporal properties of a visual stimulus can be exploited to detect correspondence between auditory and visual streams (Crosse et al., 2015Crosse M.J. Butler J.S. Lalor E.C.

Auditory selective attention is enhanced by a task-irrelevant temporally coherent visual stimulus in human listeners.eLife. 2015; 4: e04995Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Together, these behavioral results suggest that temporal coherence between auditory and visual stimuli can promote binding of cross-modal features to enable the formation of an auditory-visual (AV) object (Bizley et al., 2016bBizley J.K.

USA. 2015; 112: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), but the contribution that visual activity in auditory cortex makes to auditory function remains unclear. One possibility is that the integration of cross-sensory information in early sensory cortex provides a bottom-up substrate for the binding of multisensory stimulus features into a single perceptual object (Bizley et al., 2016bBizley J.K. Maddox R.K. Lee A.K. Defining auditory-visual objects: Behavioral tests and physiological mechanisms.Trends Neurosci. 2016; 39: 74-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We have recently argued that binding is a distinct form of multisensory integration that underpins perceptual object formation. We hypothesize that binding is associated with a modification of the sensory representation and can be identified by demonstrating a benefit in the behavioral or neural discrimination of a stimulus feature orthogonal to the features that link crossmodal stimuli (Figure 1A). Therefore, in order to demonstrate binding, an appropriate crossmodal stimulus should not only elicit enhanced neural encoding of the stimulus features that bind auditory and visual streams (the “binding features”), but there should be enhancement in the representation of other stimulus features (“non-binding features” associated with the source (Figure 1C). Here, we test the hypothesis that the incorporation of visual information into auditory cortex can determine the neuronal representation of an auditory scene through multisensory binding (Figure 1). We demonstrate that when visual luminance changes coherently with the amplitude of one sound in a mixture, auditory cortex is biased toward representing the temporally coherent sound. Consistent with these effects reflecting cross-modal binding, the encoding of sound timbre, a non-binding stimulus feature, is subsequently enhanced in the temporally coherent auditory stream. Finally, we demonstrate that the site of multisensory convergence is in auditory cortex and that visual information is conveyed via the local field potential directly from visual cortex. We recorded neuronal responses in the auditory cortex of awake passively listening ferrets (n = 9 ferrets, 221 single units, 311 multi-units) in response to naturalistic time-varying auditory and visual stimuli adapted from Maddox et al., 2015Maddox R.K.

Auditory selective attention is enhanced by a task-irrelevant temporally coherent visual stimulus in human listeners.eLife. 2015; 4: e04995Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar. The stimuli are designed to share properties with natural speech; they are modulated at approximately syllable rate and, like competing voices, can be separated on the basis of their fundamental frequency (F0, the physical determinant of pitch). These sounds are devoid of any linguistic content permitting the separation of general sensory processing mechanisms from language-specific ones for human listeners. Maddox et al., 2015Maddox R.K. Atilgan H. Bizley J.K. Lee A.K. Auditory selective attention is enhanced by a task-irrelevant temporally coherent visual stimulus in human listeners.eLife. 2015; 4: e04995Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar used both pure tones and synthetic vowels as stimuli; here, we used synthetic vowels as these robustly drive auditory cortical responses in the ferret, in neurons with a wide range of characteristic frequencies (Bizley et al., 2009Bizley J.K.

(2017). Neural correlates of perceptual constancy in Auditory Cortex. BioXriv https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/15/102889.Google Scholar). We additionally recorded neural responses in medetomidine-ketamine anesthetized ferrets (n = 5 ferrets, 426 single units, 772 multi-units), which allowed us to entirely eliminate attentional effects and limit the impact of top-down processing on sensory responses. These experiments also permitted longer recording durations for additional control stimuli and enabled simultaneous characterization of neural activity across cortical laminae. In a subset of these animals, we were able to reversibly silence visual cortex during recording, in order to determine the origin of visual-stimulus elicited neural changes. Recordings were made in awake freely moving animals while they held their head at a drinking spout but were not engaged in a behavioral task and allowed us to measure neural activity free from any confounds associated with pharmacological manipulation and in the absence of task-directed attention, which would likely engage additional neural circuits. The stimuli were two auditory streams each comprised of a vowel with distinct pitch and timbre (denoted A1: [u], F0 = 175 Hz and A2: [a], F0 = 195 Hz, Figure 1) and independently amplitude modulated with a low-pass (<7 Hz) envelope (Figure 1D). A full-field visual stimulus accompanied the auditory stimuli, the luminance of which was temporally modulated with the modulation envelope from one of the two auditory streams (Figure 1E). We tested stimulus conditions in which both auditory streams were presented (“dual-stream”) and the visual stimulus was temporally coherent with one or other of the auditory streams (A12V1 or A12V2, Figure 1E). We also tested conditions in which a single auditory-visual stimulus pair was presented (“single-stream” stimuli), where the auditory and visual streams could be temporally coherent (A1V1, A2V2) or independent (A1V2, A2V1), as well as no-visual control conditions (A1, A2). We first asked whether the temporal dynamics of a visual stimulus could selectively enhance the representation of one sound in a mixture. We therefore recorded responses to auditory scenes composed of two sounds (A1 and A2), presented simultaneously, with a visual stimulus that was temporally coherent with one or other auditory stream (A12V1 or A12V2). It is known that a visual stimulus can enhance the representation of the amplitude envelope of an attended speech stream in auditory cortex (Zion Golumbic et al., 2013Zion Golumbic E. Cogan G.B.

To test whether we could observe a similar phenomenon in single neurons in the absence of selective attention, we used neural responses to temporally coherent single-stream stimuli (i.e., A1V1 and A2V2) to determine the extent to which the neural response to the sound mixture was specific to one or other sound stream. Figure 2 illustrates this approach for a single unit: responses to the temporally coherent single-stream auditory-visual stimuli (Figure 2A) formed templates that were used to decode the responses to the dual-stream stimuli (Figure 2B) using a Euclidean distance-based spike pattern classifier. Such an approach is ideally suited for classifying neural responses to time-varying stimuli. Auditory cortical responses to the dual-stream stimuli (A12V1 or A12V2) were more commonly decoded as A1V1 when the visual stimulus was V1, and A2V2 when the visual stimulus was V2. Performing this analysis for each neuron in our recorded population yielded similar observations: the coherent auditory stimulus representation was enhanced (Figures 2C, 2D, 2F, and 2G) such that auditory cortical responses to dual-stream stimuli most closely resembled responses to the single-stream stimulus with the shared visual component. To quantify whether the responses of individual units were significantly influenced by the visual stimulus identity, we first calculated a visual preference index (VPI) as the difference between the percentage of A12V1 trials classified as A1 and the percentage of A12V2 trials classified as A1. Units that were fully influenced by the identity of the visual stimulus would have a VPI score of 100, while those in which the visual stimulus did not influence the response at all would have a score of 0 (Figures 2E and 2H). We assessed the significance of observed VPI scores using a permutation test (p < 0.05) to reveal that 33.6% of driven units recorded in awake animals (91/271 units) and 52.9% of units in the anesthetized dataset (175/331 units) had responses to dual-stream stimuli significantly influenced by the visual stimulus. Modulation of dual-stream responses by visual stimulus identity was not simply a consequence of the shared visual component of single-stream and dual-stream stimuli and was observed in neurons in which visual or auditory identity could be decoded (example response from a unit in which only auditory stimulus identity could be decoded: Figure S2). If this effect was only apparent in visual neurons in auditory cortex, then eliminating the visual element of the single-stream stimuli should prohibit successful decoding for the dual-stream stimuli. Additional control experiments (n = 89 driven units, from 4 awake animals) demonstrated that this was not the case: the enhancement of the temporally coherent sound in the sound mixture was evident whether dual-stream stimuli (A12V1 and A12V2) were decoded using responses to auditory-only stimuli (A1 or A2) or auditory-visual stimuli (A1V1, A2V2 etc.). Within this control data (example unit: Figures 3A and 3B , population data Figures 3C–3H), 32 units (36%) had a significant VPI scores when dual-stream responses were decoded from an auditory-only single-stream templates and 31 units (35%) when decoded with auditory-visual templates. Furthermore, the distribution of VPI values was statistically indistinguishable for decoding dual-stream responses with A-only or auditory-visual templates (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test: all units, p = 0.9016; units with visual preference scores significantly >0, p > 0.9998), and the distribution of values in Figure 3D was statistically indistinguishable from that in Figure 2E (p = 0.0864). We also determined that removing the visual stimulus from the dual-stream condition eliminated any decoding difference in responses observed (Figure 3H). A two-way repeated-measures ANOVA on decoded responses with factors of visual stream (V1, V2, no visual) and template type (auditory-visual or A) demonstrated a significant effect of visual stream identity on dual-stream decoding (F(2, 528) = 19.320, p < 0.001), but there was no effect of template type (F(1,528) = 0.073, p = 0.787) or interaction between factors (F(2,528) = 0.599, p = 0.550). Post hoc comparisons revealed that without visual stimulation, there was no tendency to respond preferentially to either stream, but that visual stream identity significantly influenced the classification of dual-stream responses. Analysis of recording site locations demonstrated that, in the awake animal, recordings in the posterior ectosylvian gyrus (PEG, which contains two tonotopic secondary fields) were most strongly influenced by the visual stimulus (Figure S3B). In anesthetized animals, the magnitude of the visual preference scores was similar to that observed in the primary fields of awake animals but was not significantly different across cortical areas (Figure S3E). In both awake and anesthetized animals, units that were classified as “visual discriminating” (see Figure 5; STAR Methods) or “auditory discriminating” were influenced by the visual stimulus, with the magnitude of the effects being greatest in the visual-discriminating units. In anesthetized animals, we confirmed using noise bursts and light flashes that a substantial proportion of both visual-discriminating and auditory-discriminating units were auditory-visual (of 136 visual discriminating units with a significant VPI, 19 were categorized as auditory, 39 as visual, and 78 as auditory-visual; of 39 auditory-discriminating units with significant VPI values, 21 were auditory, 2 were visual, and 16 were auditory-visual Figure S3I). The ability of auditory-visual temporal coherence to enhance one sound in a mixture was observed across all cortical layers (anesthetized dataset; layers defined by current source density analysis, see STAR Methods, Figure S3F) but was strongest in the supra-granular layers (Figure S3G). Finally, we observed these effects in both single and multi-units (Figures S4A and S4B). A hallmark of an object-based rather than feature-based representation is that all stimulus features are bound into a unitary perceptual construct, including those features that do not directly mediate binding (Desimone and Duncan, 1995Desimone R. Duncan J. Neural mechanisms of selective visual attention.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1995; 18: 193-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (5970) Google Scholar). We predicted that binding across modalities would be promoted via synchronous changes in auditory intensity and visual luminance (Figures 1B and S1) and observed that the temporal dynamics of the visual stimulus enhanced the representation of temporally coherent auditory streams (Figures 2C–2H and 3D–3F). To determine whether temporal synchrony of visual and auditory stimulus components also enhanced the representation of orthogonal stimulus features and thus fulfill a key prediction of binding (Bizley et al., 2016bBizley J.K. Maddox R.K. Lee A.K. Defining auditory-visual objects: Behavioral tests and physiological mechanisms.Trends Neurosci. 2016; 39: 74-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we introduced brief timbre perturbations into our acoustic stimuli (two in each of the A1 and A2 streams). Each deviant lasted for 200 ms during which the spectral timbre smoothly transitioned to the identity of another vowel and back to the original. It is important to note that neither the amplitude of the auditory envelope nor the visual luminance were informative about whether, or when, a change in sound timbre occurred (Figure S1). Such timbre deviants could be detected by human listeners and were better detected when embedded in an auditory stream that was temporally coherent with an accompanying visual stimulus (Maddox et al., 2015Maddox R.K. Atilgan H. Bizley J.K. Lee A.K. Auditory selective attention is enhanced by a task-irrelevant temporally coherent visual stimulus in human listeners.eLife. 2015; 4: e04995Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that a temporally coherent visual stimulus would enhance the representation of timbre deviants in the responses of auditory cortical neurons. To isolate neural responses to the timbre change from those elicited by the on-going amplitude modulation, we extracted 200-ms epochs of the neuronal response during the timbre deviant and compared these to epochs from stimuli without deviants that were otherwise identical (Figure S1). We observed that the spiking activity of many units differed between deviant and no-deviant trials (e.g., Figures 4A and S6), and we were able to discriminate deviant from no-deviant trials with a spike pattern classifier. For each neuron, our classifier reported both the number of deviants that could be detected (i.e., discriminated better than chance as assessed with a permutation test, the maximum is 4, two per auditory stream), and a classification score (where 100% implies perfect discrimination, and 50% chance discrimination, averaged across all deviants for any unit in which at least one deviant was successfully detected). We first considered the influence of temporal coherence between auditory and visual stimuli on the representation of timbre deviants in the single-stream condition (A1V1, A1V2 etc.). We found that a greater proportion of units detected at least one deviant when the auditory stream in which deviants occurred was temporally coherent with the visual stimulus, relative to the temporally independent condition. This was true both for awake (Figure 4B; Pearson chi-square statistic, χ2 = 322.617, p < 0.001) and anesthetized animals (Figure 4E; χ2 = 288.731, p < 0.001). For units that detected at least one deviant, discrimination scores were significantly higher when accompanied by a temporally coherent visual stimulus (Figure 4C, awake dataset, pairwise t test t300 = 3.599 p < 0.001; Figure 4F, anesthetized data t262 = 4.444 p < 0.001). We also observed an enhancement in the representation of timbre changes in the context of a sound scene (Figures 4D and 4G): timbre changes were more reliably encoded when the sound stream in which they were embedded was accompanied by a temporally coherent visual stimulus. We performed a two-way repeated-measures ANOVA on deviant discrimination performance with visual condition (V1/V2) and the auditory stream in which the deviants occurred (A1/A2) as factors. We anticipated that enhancement of the representation of timbre deviants in the temporally coherent auditory stream would be revealed as a significant interaction term in the dual-stream data. Significant interaction terms were seen in both the awake (Figure 4D, F(1,600) = 29.138, p < 0.001) and anesthetized datasets (Figure 4G, F(1,524) = 16.652, p < 0.001). We also observed significant main effects of auditory and visual conditions in awake (main effect of auditory stream, F(1,600) = 4.565, p = 0.033; main effect of visual condition, F(1,600) = 2.650, p = 0.010) but not anesthetized animals (main effect of auditory stream, F(1,524) = 0.004, p = 0.948; main effect of visual condition, F(1,524) = 1.355, p = 0.245). Finally, to determine whether a temporally coherent visual stimulus enhanced the representation of non-binding features relative to auditory-alone stimuli, we collected additional control data (3 animals, 39 driven units) in which single-stream stimuli were presented with, or without a temporally coherent visual stimulus. These data (Figures S6A–S6C) confirmed that the presence of a visual stimulus enhanced the encoding of timbre deviants relative to the auditory-only condition. The magnitude of the influence of auditory-visual temporal coherence on timbre deviant encoding was equivalent in single and multi-units (Figures S4C and S4D). Together these data demonstrate the predicted enhancement in the neural representation of both binding (i.e., auditory amplitude) and non-binding features (here auditory timbre) that are orthogonal to those that promote binding between auditory and visual streams, meaning the effects we observe in auditory cortex fulfill our definition of multisensory binding. Next, we turn to the question of how these effects are mediated and whether they emerge within or outside of auditory cortex. We used the responses to single-stream stimuli to classify neurons according to whether they were dominantly modulated by auditory or visual temporal dynamics. To determine whether the auditory amplitude envelope reliably modulated spiking, we used a spike-pattern classifier to decode the auditory stream identity, collapsed across visual stimulus (i.e., we decoded auditory stream identity from the combined responses to A1V1 and A1V2 stimuli and the combination of A2V1 and A2V2 responses). An identical approach was taken to determine whether neuronal responses reliably distinguished visual modulation (i.e., we decoded visual identity from the combined responses to A1V1 and A2V1 stimuli and the combined responses elicited by A1V2 and A2V2). Neuronal responses that were informative about auditory or visual stimulus identity at a level better than chance (estimated with a bootstrap resampling) were classified as auditory discriminating (Figures 5A and 5B ) and/or visual discriminating (Figures 5C and 5D), respectively. In awake animals, 39.5% (210/532) of driven units were auditory discriminating, 11.1% (59/532) were visual discriminating, and only 0.4% (2/532) discriminated both auditory and visual stimuli. Overall a smaller proportion of units represented the identity of auditory or visual streams in the anesthetized dataset: 20.2% (242/1198) were auditory discriminating, 6.8% (82/1198) were visual discriminating, and 0.6% (7/1198) discriminated both. Using simple noise bursts and light flashes in anesthetized animals revealed that the classification of units as visual/auditory discriminating based on the single-stream stimuli selected a subset of light and/or sound driven units and that the proportions of auditory, visual, and auditory-visual units recorded in our sample were in line with previous studies from ferret auditory cortex (65.1% [328/504] of units were driven by noise bursts, 16.1% [81/504] by light flashes and 14.1% [71/504] by both). When considering the units that were classified as auditory or visual discriminating based on single-stream stimuli, and for which we recorded responses to noise bursts and light flashes, 53% (160/307) were classified as auditory, 17% (53/307) as visual and 31% (94/307) as auditory-visual when classified with simple stimuli (see also Figure S3I). We hypothesized that the effects we observed in the dual-stream condition might be a consequence of temporal coherence between auditory and visual stimuli enhancing the discriminability of neural responses. We confirmed this prediction by using the same spike pattern decoder to compare our ability to discriminate temporally coherent (A1V1 versus A2V2) and temporally independent (A1V2 versus A2V1) stimuli (Figures 5E and 5F): temporally coherent auditory-visual stimuli produced more discriminable spike patterns than those elicited by temporally independent ones in both awake (Figure 5E, pairwise t test, auditory discriminating t418 = 11.872, p < 0.001; visual discriminating t116 = 6.338, p < 0.001; All t540 = 13.610, p < 0.001) and anesthetized recordings (Figure 5F, auditory discriminating t482 = 17.754, p < 0.001; visual discriminating t162 = 8.186, p < 0.001; all t664 = 19.461, p < 0.001). We further determined that neither the mean nor maximum evoked spike rates were different between trials in response to temporally coherent and temporally independent auditory visual stimuli (Figure S5). We also observed that the impact of auditory-visual temporal coherence was stronger in single units than multi-units in the awake dataset (Figure S4E). Therefore, the improved discrimination ability observed in response to temporally coherent auditory-visual stimuli is most likely to arise due to an increase in the reliability with which a spiking response occurred. Temporal coherence between auditory and visual stimulus streams results in more discriminable spike trains in the single-stream condition and an enhancement of the representation of the temporally coherent sound when that sound forms part of an auditory scene. What might underlie the increased discriminability observed for temporally coherent cross-modal stimuli? The phase of on-going oscillations determines the excitability of the surrounding cortical tissue (Azouz and"
https://openalex.org/W2786871799,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neuroinflammatory condition of the central nervous system (CNS). It is a major cause of neurological disability in young adults, particularly women. What triggers the destruction of myelin sheaths covering nerve fibres is unknown. Both genetic and infectious agents have been implicated. Of the infectious agents, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a common herpesvirus, has the strongest epidemiological and serological evidence. However, the presence of EBV in the CNS and demonstration of the underlying mechanism(s) linking EBV to the pathogenesis of MS remain to be elucidated. We aimed at understanding the contribution of EBV infection in the pathology of MS. We examined 1055 specimens (440 DNA samples and 615 brain tissues) from 101 MS and 21 non-MS cases for the presence of EBV using PCR and EBER-in situ hybridization (EBER-ISH). EBV was detected by PCR and/or EBER-ISH in 91/101 (90%) of MS cases compared to only 5/21 (24%) of non-MS cases with other neuropathologies. None of the samples were PCR positive for other common herpesviruses (HSV-1, CMV, HHV-6). By quantitative PCR, EBV viral load in MS brain was mainly low to moderate in most cases. However, in 18/101 (18%) of MS cases, widespread but scattered presence of EBV infected cells was noted in the affected tissues by EBER-ISH. Immunohistochemical analysis of EBV gene expression in the 18 heavily infected cases, revealed that the EBV latent protein EBNA1, and to a lesser extent the early lytic protein BZLF1 were expressed. Furthermore, using double-staining we show for the first time that astrocytes and microglia, in addition to B-cells can also be infected. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive study demonstrating that EBV is present and transcriptionally active in the brain of most cases of MS and supports a role for the virus in MS pathogenesis. Further studies are required to address the mechanism of EBV involvement in MS pathology."

We explored the neural basis of abstraction by recording from multi-electrode arrays in prefrontal cortex (PFC) while monkeys performed a dot-pattern categorization task. Category abstraction was varied by the degree of exemplar distortion from the prototype pattern. Different dynamics in different PFC regions processed different levels of category abstraction. Bottom-up dynamics (stimulus-locked gamma power and spiking) in the ventral PFC processed more low-level abstractions, whereas top-down dynamics (beta power and beta spike-LFP coherence) in the dorsal PFC processed more high-level abstractions. Our results suggest a two-stage, rhythm-based model for abstracting categories."
https://openalex.org/W2784894177,"The axon initial segment (AIS) is the site of action potential generation and a locus of activity-dependent homeostatic plasticity. A multimeric complex of sodium channels, linked via a cytoskeletal scaffold of ankyrin G and beta IV spectrin to submembranous actin rings, mediates these functions. The mechanisms that specify the AIS complex to the proximal axon and underlie its plasticity remain poorly understood. Here we show phosphorylated myosin light chain (pMLC), an activator of contractile myosin II, is highly enriched in the assembling and mature AIS, where it associates with actin rings. MLC phosphorylation and myosin II contractile activity are required for AIS assembly, and they regulate the distribution of AIS components along the axon. pMLC is rapidly lost during depolarization, destabilizing actin and thereby providing a mechanism for activity-dependent structural plasticity of the AIS. Together, these results identify pMLC/myosin II activity as a common link between AIS assembly and plasticity."

The in vitro assays demonstrated that the antioxidant activities of inulin, including the DPPH radical scavenging activity, ABTS scavenging activity and ferric reducing power, were weak and significantly lower than those of Vitamin C (P < 0.05). The influence of dietary supplementation with inulin on the antioxidant status of laying hens was evaluated with in vivo antioxidant assays. The results indicated that inulin supplementation quadratically improved the egg production rate of the laying hens (P < 0.01). The antioxidant enzyme activities in the serum, including SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px, and the total antioxidant capacity increased quadratically as inulin levels increased (P < 0.001). The levels of MDA in the serum decreased quadratically as inulin levels increased (P < 0.001). These findings suggest that inulin has the potential to improve the antioxidant status of laying hens."

Our experience of the world depends on integrating signals through multiple senses.

In the present study, we linked the psychophysical and neurophysiological approaches by measuring the efficiency of multisensory integration through a behavioral test, while simultaneously examining neuronal processing in the PPC. As a psychophysical gauge of integration, we measured the capacity of rats to judge the orientation of an object by the visual sensory channel, by the tactile sensory channel, and by both channels together. The results show that the same functional knowledge of object orientation could be evoked under varying sensory conditions, yet the most reliable judgment arose from the two channels operating together. Next, as a neurophysiological gauge of multisensory integration, we measured the degree to which the activity of PPC neurons recorded during the behavioral task could account for the rats’ supramodal recognition of object orientation. We designed a visual-tactile categorization task that involves a solid object. The discriminandum, pictured in Figure 1A, had a circular boundary (98 mm diameter) and raised parallel bars (width and depth of 3.5 mm), alternately colored white and black. It was thus accessible as both a visual and a tactile square wave grating. Rats were trained to encounter the object to judge its orientation on each trial, categorizing orientations in the range of 0°–45° as horizontal, and orientations in the range of 45°–90° as vertical (Figure 1B; also see STAR Methods and Figure S1). Figure 1C illustrates in a schematic manner the sequence of events in the behavioral task. Each trial started with a head poke that triggered the opening of an opaque gate, followed by either a tactile (T) trial (in complete darkness, with the animal allowed to touch the object with its snout and whiskers), a visual (V) trial (under illumination but with a transparent panel in front of the object to prevent contact), or a visual-tactile (VT) trial (with the object illuminated and accessible by touch). After sampling the stimulus, the rat turned its head toward one spout (L or R) and licked. The boundary angle, 45°, was rewarded randomly on left or right. The three stimulus conditions (V, T, and VT) were randomly interleaved with 32% likelihood per trial. The remaining 4% were control trials (neither visual nor tactile access to the stimulus). As a first step, we characterized the rats’ performance on V and T (unimodal) trials and compared the performance to that on VT trials. Next, we analyzed their accuracy in these three conditions to determine whether they merged or else kept separate the visual and tactile sensory information on visual-tactile trials. Finally, we explored the neuronal correlates of the convergence of sensory channels. To quantify rats’ performance, we used a cumulative Gaussian function to fit psychometric curves to the choice data of each rat in each modality (see STAR Methods). Figure 2A reveals that rats differed in their modality-specific acuity: rat 3 performed better in the T condition (left), while rats 12 and 1 performed better in the V condition (middle and right). All three example rats performed better in the VT condition than in V or T alone (in this figure, and throughout the report, green traces correspond to the T condition, blue to V, and red to VT). The boost in performance in the VT condition indicates that, when both modalities were available, rats did not select and rely upon the single, preferred channel; instead, they benefited from the access to both channels of sensory input (Figure S2B). Figure 2B shows the psychometric fits for 12 rats (pale curves, colored according to modality). The average performance across rats is illustrated by the thick curves. Rats showed, on average, good orientation acuity using their whiskers and snout (T) and slightly better performance using vision (V). Performance was markedly superior in the VT condition, indicating multisensory enhancement, consistent with Figure 2A. The standard deviation, σ, of the cumulative Gaussian function underlying the psychometric curve is a robust measure of acuity, with a small σ implying a steep psychometric curve slope and high acuity. Individual rats performed best on bimodal trials, independently of the individual’s preferred modality: the decrease in σ in the VT versus V and T conditions was significant for all rats (Figures S2A and S2B, bootstrap test, p < 0.001). In the VT condition, rats also showed reduced lapse rates compared to V and T (i.e., fewer errors on “easy” trials, those near the 0° and 90° orientations, p = 0.000 for all conditions in average curve; Figure S2A, bootstrap test) and a more accurate detection of the horizontal and vertical boundary, assessed by the point of subjective equality (PSE closer to 45°, p < 0.02 for V and T in average curve compared to VT; Figure S2A, bootstrap test). The inset in Figure 2B highlights the improved performance in the bimodal condition versus each of the unimodal conditions, averaged across rats. Overall, VT benefit was greater versus T than versus V, an outcome of the better V versus T unimodal performance. Benefit varied with stimulus orientation. At 45°, performance can be no better than chance; thus, multisensory integration provided no benefit. At the cardinal orientations, 0° and 90°, performance in V and T conditions was high, so that multisensory integration could offer limited benefit. At the intermediate orientations, 20°–35° and 55°–70°, the benefit obtained by combining information from the two modalities was greatest. Did rats learn reward contingencies specific to the stimulus orientations upon which they were trained, or did they execute the task by spontaneously sorting any encountered stimulus, whether familiar or novel, into the categories of horizontal and vertical? To distinguish between the possibilities, in ten rats who were well trained with stimuli in the range of 0°–90°, we introduced trials with stimulus orientations ranging from 90°–135° and −45° to 0° (Figure 1B, stippled sectors) interleaved with the familiar 0°–90° trials in the same session. In the first such session, each rat performed equally well on the new versus the familiar stimuli (bootstrap test, all rats p > 0.29; Figure S2C). Thus, rats seemed to solve the task by measuring the difference between the encountered orientation and the cardinal orientations of “horizontal” and “vertical.” They were able to generalize this categorization rule to new stimuli upon the first instance, consistent with the ability of rats to generalize visual object recognition to novel views (Tafazoli et al., 2012Tafazoli S. Di Filippo A. Zoccolan D. Transformation-tolerant object recognition in rats revealed by visual priming.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 21-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In further behavioral sessions, we included the full range of stimulus orientations. For the purpose of analysis, stimuli in the ranges of 90°–135° and −45° to 0° were reflected about the vertical and horizontal axes, respectively, allowing all orientations to be treated as 0°–90°. We next compared the performance observed in bimodal trials to that predicted by the optimal combination of two unimodal channels. Optimal performance was defined as the linear combination of the two independent signals, based on a framework of Bayesian decision theory (Ernst and Banks, 2002Ernst M.O. Banks M.S. Humans integrate visual and haptic information in a statistically optimal fashion.Nature. 2002; 415: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (3064) Google Scholar, Fetsch et al., 2013Fetsch C.R. DeAngelis G.C.

Landy M.S. Sensory Cue Integration. Oxford University Press, 2011: 5-29Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Specifically, we fit the psychometric data with a cumulative Gaussian function yielding two parameters: the point of subjective equality (the orientation aligned to the mean of the best-fitting cumulative Gaussian function) and the threshold (the Gaussian function standard deviation, σ). In the Bayesian framework, the standard deviation in the VT condition is related to the standard deviations of the unimodal conditions as follows:1σvt2=1σv2+1σt2. Solving the equation for σVT gives the optimal combined threshold from single-modality estimates. Lower σ corresponds to better accuracy. Single-rat psychometric curves based on this model of optimality are represented by the black traces in Figure 2A. To illustrate all rats together, Figure 2C plots the measured threshold on VT trials versus the threshold predicted by linear combination of V and T signals: 9 out of 12 rats combined V and T signals in a supralinear manner (similar to rat 1 in Figure 2A), 2 in a linear manner (similar to rat 3 in Figure 2A), and 1 sublinearly (rat 12 in Figure 2A). As an additional approach to comparing observed performance with that predicted by a linear model, we treated V and T as two channels that provide the rat with streams of information. We then compared the total amount of information possessed by the rat on VT trials with the sum of the information possessed, separately, on V and T trials. This approach assumes that the information present within the sensory channels is converted directly into a choice (Adibi et al., 2012Adibi M. Diamond M.E. Arabzadeh E. Behavioral study of whisker-mediated vibration sensation in rats.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 971-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and allows us to quantify this information according to the rat’s behavior (e.g., 1.0 bits of information supports 100% accuracy, 0 bits supports 50% accuracy). In practice, we computed the mutual information (MI; see STAR Methods) between stimulus category (horizontal or vertical) and the rat’s behavioral choice (left or right reward spout) in each modality separately as well as in the combined condition. Then we computed the quantities predicted by the linear combination of V and T signals. In theory, the observed merging of V and T information could be exactly linear, reflecting the optimal combination of two independent signals: sublinear, reflecting redundancy between the two signals, or supralinear, reflecting synergy. If the summated quantities of V plus T information were to exceed 1.0 bits, then the rat would possess more information than it could express by its choices and the model would break down; this case never occurred. Figure 2D shows that 8 out of 12 rats combined V and T signals in a strongly supralinear manner, 2 rats close to supralinear (one error bar overlies the diagonal), 1 in a linear manner (both error bars overlie the diagonal), and 1 in a sublinear manner. In summary, two analyses—Bayesian prediction of underlying threshold and MI—both suggest that in the majority of rats the signals carried by the two sensory channels were not merged independently but were combined in a synergistic manner (the two measures are correlated, linear regression R = 0.6; Figure S2D). The availability of two channels not only improved the performance but also allowed rats to more reliably detect the horizontal and vertical boundary. Figure 2E plots their boundary detection (PSE, the stimulus orientation at which left and right choices were equally likely) along with performance (estimated by maximum psychometric curve slope). In the VT condition, the distribution of PSE was closer to the 45° line and curve slope was greater; average values are in the black circles. In standard testing, V, T, and VT trials were randomly interleaved. It could be argued that supralinear performance on VT trials occurred because rats’ motivation was higher: inasmuch as unimodal trials were more difficult, rats might have spent fewer attentional resources on them, with the knowledge that an easier bimodal trial would soon follow. However, in a different set of experiments, we tested a group of trained rats (rats 2–7) on a block design where seven unimodal-only sessions were followed by seven bimodal-only sessions. This configuration would be expected to minimize any loss in motivation on unimodal trials, since the rat could not choose to attend preferentially to bimodal trials. For this block design, measured σVT values remained close to or better than Bayesian optimal estimates (Figure 2F), indicating that supralinear summation in the interleaved sessions was not well explained by enhanced motivation on VT trials. Response times were measured as the time from first possible sensory access to the object (opening of the opaque panel) until the first lick. Considering all sensory conditions and stimulus orientations, response times were 435–734 ms (interquartile range; Figure S2E). With trials sorted according to stimulus orientation, it becomes apparent that response times were longer for orientations close to the category boundary, 45° (Figure 2G). Thus, rather than undersampling the difficult orientation due to reduced reward likelihood, the rats in fact seemed to try to acquire additional evidence. The distributions differed little according to trial modality condition (Figures S2F and S2G). We recorded neuronal activity in the left PPC of trained rats (Figure 3A) after they reached a stable level of performance in the behavioral task. For most recording sessions, the set of stimulus orientations was reduced to angles between 0° and 90° in 15° steps (hence seven orientations) to allow a greater number of trials (and therefore neuronal samples) at each orientation. Rats usually completed 300–500 trials per recording session. In Figure 3B, the action potential waveform and interspike interval histogram (ISI) of a single unit is illustrated (upper plots; ISIs for a large set of sampled neurons are given in Figure S3C). The raster plot shows the unit’s firing on 250 (randomly selected out of a session of 524) trials, with trial sequence conserved. Modality conditions (V, T, and VT) are labeled by color and were randomly interleaved. Firing rate, computed in a window of 1 ms and smoothed with a Gaussian (σ = 50 ms), is plotted with the same color code. The neuron had a stable firing rate of about 2 spikes/s as the rat awaited the trial onset. About 200 ms after trial onset, the neuron’s firing rate ramped upward and remained at about 8 spikes/s until 1 s after trial onset. Similar temporal profiles characterized V, T, and VT trials. We examined the encoding of stimulus orientation and stimulus category (the horizontal category versus the vertical one) by grouping trials with the same orientation together. Figure 3C shows raster plots (left plots) and peri-event time histograms (PETHs, middle plots) of two example PPC neurons, with responses in all modality conditions combined. Neuronal data are aligned to the trial onset (defined as the onset of the opening of opaque panel). Error trials and trials with 45° orientation are excluded in these plots. The angular tuning curves (right plots, separated by modality, based on neuronal data in a 300 ms window preceding the reward spout lick) highlight that the two neurons’ firing rates were modulated by stimulus orientation, the first firing at a progressively higher rate as angle increased from 0° to 90°, and the second firing at a progressively lower rate from 0° to 90°. By contrast, Figure 3D shows two neurons that carried a large signal about stimulus category: firing rates deviated according to the upcoming action (left or right). The angular tuning curves indicate that they were poorly modulated by stimulus orientation within a choice category. The orientation and category information carried by these neurons is shown in Figure 5. The tuning curves of Figure 3C and 3D suggest that, while neuronal firing could vary according to orientation (first pair of neurons) or category (second pair of neurons), it was largely invariant to differences in modality (in right plots, compare green, blue, and red curves). For the first quantitative test of modality invariance, we merged the data across all stimulus orientations. In Figure 4A, each point represents the average firing rates of one neuron (total, 622 neurons) in a 300 ms window preceding the reward spout lick in V, T, and VT trials, separately. The proximity of nearly all points to the diagonal line attests to the supramodal character of these neurons: a given neuron’s overall engagement in the task was nearly equal under the three modality conditions. Next, we separated the data according to orientation to find out whether invariance to modality persisted across all orientations. Figure 4B illustrates the firing rate of all neurons, again in the 300 ms window preceding the reward spout lick, in T (abscissa) versus V (ordinate) trials. The independence of firing rate on modality held across the six stimulus orientations; the Pearson linear correlation coefficient, R, between firing rate on V and T trials ranged from 0.96 to 0.99. To obtain a population summary, for each neuron we considered the firing rates on V and T trials as two coordinates and plotted the resulting response values (again, in the 300 ms window preceding the reward spout lick) for each of the six tested orientations, as illustrated for two neurons in the upper plots of Figure 4C. The left plot shows a neuron whose response is modulated by stimulus orientation and the right plot shows a neuron whose response is modulated by the choice category associated with stimulus orientation. For all neurons, we computed the strength and slope of the V versus T linear regression through the six points. A neuron can yield linear regression with coefficient R = 1 and regression slope also 1 only if it satisfies two conditions: variation in firing rate according to stimulus orientation and/or category, and equivalent firing rate for the two modalities. The histograms in Figure 4C (lower plots) are the distributions of the regression coefficients (left) and slopes of the statistically significant coefficients (right); both distributions show a peak near 1, highlighting the similarity in response in the two sensory modalities. The nearly equal responses of neurons on V, T, and VT trials imply that the studied population did not inform the brain about the modality in which the object was presented, though modality selectivity of many PPC neurons has been reported in recent work (Raposo et al., 2014Raposo D. Kaufman M.T. Churchland A.K. A category-free neural population supports evolving demands during decision-making.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 1784-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). We further examined the problem by comparing stimulus modality selectivity to stimulus category selectivity in the same population. To carry out the comparison, we employed a selectivity measure (Feierstein et al., 2006Feierstein C.E. Quirk M.C. Uchida N. Sosulski D.L. Mainen Z.F. Representation of spatial goals in rat orbitofrontal cortex.Neuron. 2006; 51: 495-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) based on receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis. The measure defines how well the firing rate of a given neuron can be used to classify the modality of the stimulus (visual versus tactile) as well as the rat’s categorization of the stimulus (measured by its choice, right versus left). The metric is proportional to the area under the ROC curve, which is scaled from −1 to 1. Figure 4D, upper histogram, shows the distribution of modality selectivity for the population of 622 PPC neurons. Just 5% (30 out of 622) were selective (p < 0.01; permutation test) for stimulus modality, and the analysis does not point to an overall preference for either modality among these 30 neurons. To test whether modality preference was modulated by the rat’s upcoming choice, we did the same analysis with right-choice and left-choice trials separated, doubling the number of tests (2 per neuron). In the 1,244 tests, the same 5% proportion was selective. Figure 4D, lower histogram, shows the distribution of category selectivity for the same population of neurons; over 50% of neurons (318 out of 622) were significantly selective (p < 0.01; permutation test) for the upcoming choice of the rat. A greater number of neurons (219 out of 318 neurons) was selective for turns to the right (index < 0) than to the left (index > 0), suggesting overall opposite-side preference in left PPC. In sum, this population of neurons did not appear to be informative about the modality of the stimulus but instead generated a robust signal about stimulus properties—orientation and the choice category associated with that orientation—irrespective of modality (also see Figure S4). While Figures 4C and 4D considered the category and modality signal separately in single neurons, it was of interest to know how the properties of stimulus orientation and category were carried jointly. Two alternative coding schemes might hold: (1) the properties of stimul"
https://openalex.org/W2784441275,"In contrast with numerous studies of glutamate receptor-associated proteins and their involvement in the modulation of excitatory synapses, much less is known about mechanisms controlling postsynaptic GABAA receptor (GABAAR) numbers. Using tandem affinity purification from tagged GABAAR γ2 subunit transgenic mice and proteomic analysis, we isolated several GABAAR-associated proteins, including Cleft lip and palate transmembrane protein 1 (Clptm1). Clptm1 interacted with all GABAAR subunits tested and promoted GABAAR trapping in the endoplasmic reticulum. Overexpression of Clptm1 reduced GABAAR-mediated currents in a recombinant system, in cultured hippocampal neurons, and in brain, with no effect on glycine or AMPA receptor-mediated currents. Conversely, knockdown of Clptm1 increased phasic and tonic inhibitory transmission with no effect on excitatory synaptic transmission. Furthermore, altering the expression level of Clptm1 mimicked activity-induced inhibitory synaptic scaling. Thus, in complement to other GABAAR-associated proteins that promote receptor surface expression, Clptm1 limits GABAAR forward trafficking and regulates inhibitory homeostatic plasticity."

Mature piRNA-PIWI complexes regulate the expression of transposable elements, protein-coding genes, and foreign nucleic acids, through diverse modes of action. Target repression by piRNAs involves both transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) and post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) in flies and mice (Czech and Hannon, 2016Czech B. Hannon G.J.

The nuclear factor PRDE-1 (piRNA-dependent silencing defective) promotes transcription of type I piRNA precursors (Weick et al., 2014Weick E.M. Sarkies P. Silva N. Chen R.A. Moss S.M. Cording A.C.

It is not yet known if piRNA-mediated PTGS occurs in C. elegans. Here, we report that the piRNA pathway represses C. elegans axonal regeneration after injury, based on four lines of evidence. First, loss of function in select genes of the piRNA pathway results in enhanced axon regrowth, independent of piRNA-mediated nuclear silencing. Second, two essential piRNA factors, PRDE-1 and PRG-1/PIWI, act in a cell-autonomous and gonad-independent manner to inhibit axonal regrowth after injury. Third, prde-1 and prg-1 transcripts are expressed in multiple somatic cells including neurons. Fourth, the slicer domain of PRG-1/PIWI is required for its inhibitory effect on axon regrowth. We conclude that a neuronal piRNA-based mechanism inhibits axon regeneration after injury. We tested whether piRNA pathway genes were involved in C. elegans adult sensory axon regeneration. We screened genetic null mutants for factors in piRNA expression and function: (1) piRNA transcription, (2) piRNA maturation (3′ and 5′ end processing), (3) secondary amplification that generates 22G-endo siRNAs, and (4) nuclear RNAi and target gene silencing (Figure 1) (Weick and Miska, 2014Weick E.M. Miska E.A. piRNAs: from biogenesis to function.Development. 2014; 141: 3458-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). By comparing regrowth length of the posterior lateral microtubule (PLM) mechanosensory neuron (also called touch receptor neuron, TRN) 24 hr after laser axotomy, we found that a subset of components in the piRNA pathway, specifically those regulating piRNA transcription, maturation, and secondary amplification, inhibited PLM axon regeneration (Figures 1A and 1B). We observed increased PLM regrowth in homozygous mutants propagated for several generations, such as animals lacking PRDE-1, TOFU-3, and PRG-1, as well as in homozygous mutants produced from heterozygous mothers (maternal+ zygotic−), such as animals lacking TOFU-5, TOFU-7, EKL-1, DRH-3, and EGO-1 (Figure 1A; Table S1). These mutants were grossly normal in growth rate and body size, arguing that the enhanced axon regrowth is not due to altered organismal growth (Figure S1A; data not shown). The RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) EGO-1 and RRF-1 function redundantly in the generation of secondary 22G-RNAs and the piRNA sensor silencing (Bagijn et al., 2012Bagijn M.P. Goldstein L.D. Sapetschnig A. Weick E.M. Bouasker S. Lehrbach N.J. Simard M.J. Miska E.A. Function, targets, and evolution of Caenorhabditis elegans piRNAs.Science. 2012; 337: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, Sapetschnig et al., 2015Sapetschnig A. Sarkies P. Lehrbach N.J. Miska E.A. Tertiary siRNAs mediate paramutation in C. elegans.PLoS Genet. 2015; 11: e1005078Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar); interestingly, EGO-1, but not RRF-1, affects axon regeneration (Figure 1A). Some, but not all, factors involved in piRNA transcription and maturation also affect axon regeneration. For example, at the piRNA maturation step, PRG-1 and TOFU-7 repressed axon regrowth, while HENN-1 and PARN-1 showed no effect. We tested whether genes acting at the same step might function redundantly. We found that double mutants of parn-1 and henn-1 showed increased axon regrowth, compared to wild-type or either single mutant (Figure 1A). These data suggest that regulators of piRNA transcription and maturation generally inhibit PLM axon regeneration. Strikingly, animals deficient in nuclear transcriptional silencing, such as mutants lacking the nuclear Argonaute HRDE-1, the putative histone methyltransferases SET-25 and SET-32, and the HP1 ortholog HPL-2 (Ashe et al., 2012Ashe A.

Moreover, double mutants of hrde-1 and nrde-3, which encode Argonaute proteins acting in germline and somatic nuclear RNAi (Bagijn et al., 2012Bagijn M.P. Goldstein L.D. Sapetschnig A. Weick E.M.

An Argonaute transports siRNAs from the cytoplasm to the nucleus.Science. 2008; 321: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), respectively, also showed normal axon regrowth (Figure 1A). Together, these results reveal a previously unknown role for the piRNA pathway in axon regeneration, likely independent of nuclear transcriptional silencing. We next focused on PRDE-1 and PRG-1, the two essential components for piRNA expression. PRDE-1 acts in the nucleus and is essential for piRNA biogenesis, as mutants lacking PRDE-1 do not express canonical type I piRNAs (Weick et al., 2014Weick E.M. Sarkies P. Silva N. Chen R.A. Moss S.M. Cording A.C. Ahringer J. Martinez-Perez E. Miska E.A. PRDE-1 is a nuclear factor essential for the biogenesis of Ruby motif-dependent piRNAs in C. elegans.Genes Dev. 2014; 28: 783-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We tested two independent alleles of prde-1: the missense mutant mj207 (Weick et al., 2014Weick E.M. Sarkies P. Silva N. Chen R.A. Moss S.M. Cording A.C. Ahringer J. Martinez-Perez E. Miska E.A. PRDE-1 is a nuclear factor essential for the biogenesis of Ruby motif-dependent piRNAs in C. elegans.Genes Dev. 2014; 28: 783-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and a 5′ deletion mutant ju1509 (Figure S1B). Both mutants displayed normal morphology of PLM neurons but showed enhanced axon regrowth of injured PLM over 24 hr, compared to wild-type controls (Figure 2A). Under our laser axotomy conditions, PLM axons initiate regrowth approximately 6 hr post injury, showing filopodia and growth cones (Wu et al., 2007Wu Z. Ghosh-Roy A. Yanik M.F. Zhang J.Z. Jin Y. Chisholm A.D. Caenorhabditis elegans neuronal regeneration is influenced by life stage, ephrin signaling, and synaptic branching.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 15132-15137Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). prde-1(mj207) mutants displayed axon regrowth at 6 hr, with regenerative growth cones formed at frequencies similar to wild-type controls (Figures S1C and S1D). This analysis suggests that the piRNA pathway likely acts at later phases of axon regeneration. A neuronal role for PRDE-1 was unexpected, as PRDE-1 function has been thought to be restricted to the germline, where it is required for fertility (Weick et al., 2014Weick E.M. Sarkies P. Silva N. Chen R.A. Moss S.M. Cording A.C. Ahringer J. Martinez-Perez E. Miska E.A. PRDE-1 is a nuclear factor essential for the biogenesis of Ruby motif-dependent piRNAs in C. elegans.Genes Dev. 2014; 28: 783-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We next asked whether the enhanced regeneration of prde-1 mutants reflected a non-autonomous effect of the gonad by ablating the somatic gonad and germline precursor cells. Specifically, we ablated all four gonadal precursor cells (Z1–Z4) in L1 stage larvae (Figure 2B, left panel), then cut PLM axons in the same animals at the L4 stage and measured regrowth at 24 hr post-axotomy. We found that gonad ablation in either wild-type animals or prde-1(0) mutants had no effect on axon regrowth when compared to the mock or unablated controls (Figure 2B, middle and right panels). We conclude that PRDE-1 inhibits axon regeneration independent of its function in the gonad. Transcriptional profiling of adult PLM neurons has detected expression of several genes in the piRNA pathway, including prde-1 and prg-1 (Kaletsky et al., 2016Kaletsky R. Lakhina V. Arey R.

Thus, we asked whether prde-1 mRNAs could be visualized in PLM neurons using smFISH (single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization), which allows detection of single mRNAs in cells (Raj et al., 2008Raj A. van den Bogaard P. Rifkin S.A. van Oudenaarden A. Tyagi S. Imaging individual mRNA molecules using multiple singly labeled probes.Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 877-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). We detected prde-1 mRNAs in PLM neurons (Figure 3A) as well as in germ cells. Intriguingly, prde-1 expression in PLM neurons was detectable primarily in adult animals. We next examined endogenous PRDE-1 protein expression by generating a gfp knockin (KI) allele (ju1534) at the prde-1 locus using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing (Figures 3B and S2A). prde-1(ju1534) KI animals produced a full-length PRDE-1 protein tagged at its N terminus (GFP-PRDE-1) (Figure S2B) and were indistinguishable from wild-type animals in development, fertility, and PLM axon regrowth length (Figure S2C). We observed GFP fluorescence as puncta in the germline nuclei of adult hermaphrodites (Figure 3C), consistent with reported antibody staining for PRDE-1 (Weick et al., 2014Weick E.M. Sarkies P. Silva N. Chen R.A. Moss S.M. Cording A.C. Ahringer J. Martinez-Perez E. Miska E.A. PRDE-1 is a nuclear factor essential for the biogenesis of Ruby motif-dependent piRNAs in C. elegans.Genes Dev. 2014; 28: 783-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We were not able to detect GFP-PRDE-1 fluorescence in somatic tissues by live imaging or by antibody staining with anti-GFP antibodies. In regenerating PLM neurons after axonal injury, GFP-PRDE-1 fluorescence remained below visible detection. When we overexpressed PRDE-1 in mechanosensory neurons, we detected PRDE-1-GFP predominantly in the nuclei of mechanosensory neurons (Figure S2D), consistent with its function in piRNA precursor transcription; the pattern and levels of overexpressed PRDE-1-GFP were not discernably different in regenerating PLM. We hypothesized that even low levels of PRDE-1 expression in neurons could be functionally significant. To test this, we took advantage of a tissue-specific protein knockdown method that relies on GFP-DEGRON (GFP nanobody-ZIF-1 fusion) to target and degrade GFP-tagged proteins (Armenti et al., 2014Armenti S.T. Lohmer L.L. Sherwood D.R. Nance J. Repurposing an endogenous degradation system for rapid and targeted depletion of C. elegans proteins.Development. 2014; 141: 4640-4647Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, Wang et al., 2017Wang S. Tang N.H. Lara-Gonzalez P. Zhao Z. Cheerambathur D.K. Prevo B. Chisholm A.D. Desai A. Oegema K. A toolkit for GFP-mediated tissue-specific protein degradation in C. elegans.Development. 2017; 144: 2694-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) (Figure 3D). We expressed the GFP-DEGRON in mechanosensory neurons (trnDEGRON) and confirmed that it eliminated GFP fluorescence (Figure S3) and also did not alter axon morphology. We then tested the effect of trnDEGRON in the prde-1 gfp KI (ju1534) animals. We found that, compared to control animals, depletion of GFP-PRDE-1 in mechanosensory neurons resulted in enhanced axon regrowth (Figure 3E). This analysis indicates that PRDE-1 functions cell-autonomously in axonal regrowth. To further support this conclusion, we transgenically expressed PRDE-1 in prde-1(0) mutants. We observed that the enhanced axon regrowth was rescued by cell-type-specific transgenic expression of PRDE-1 from a mechanosensory-neuron-specific promoter (Pmec-4), but not from a motor-neuron-specific promoter (Punc-25) or a muscle-specific promoter (Pmyo-3) (Figure 3F). Together, these data support a specific role of PRDE-1 in mechanosensory neurons to inhibit axon regrowth. Once piRNA precursors are generated, PRG-1/PIWI is required for normal expression of mature piRNAs (Bagijn et al., 2012Bagijn M.P. Goldstein L.D. Sapetschnig A. Weick E.M. Bouasker S. Lehrbach N.J.

We found that both prg-1(n4357) and prg-1(tm872) null mutants displayed enhanced PLM regrowth (Figures 4A and 4B ), resembling that of prde-1 mutants. Moreover, PLM regeneration defects in prg-1 mutants were rescued by transgenic expression of PRG-1 with its own promoter, as well as by expression of PRG-1 from a mechanosensory-neuron-specific promoter (Pmec-4), but not from a motor-neuron-specific promoter (Punc-25) (Figure 4C). These data support a conclusion that PRG-1 can also act cell-autonomously to inhibit axonal regrowth. In the germline, PRG-1 is localized to the cytoplasm (Batista et al., 2008Batista P.J. Ruby J.G. Claycomb J.M. Chiang R. Fahlgren N. Kasschau K.D. Chaves D.A. Gu W. Vasale J.J. Duan S. et al.PRG-1 and 21U-RNAs interact to form the piRNA complex required for fertility in C. elegans.Mol. Cell. 2008; 31: 67-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). We found that in neurons, overexpressed GFP-PRG-1 showed predominantly cytoplasmic localization (Figure 4D), consistent with its function in cytosolic piRNA maturation. We then asked whether prg-1 mRNAs might be present in somatic cells. First, we examined germline-less animals caused by a temperature-sensitive mutation of glp-1 grown at restrictive temperature (Austin and Kimble, 1987Austin J. Kimble J. glp-1 is required in the germ line for regulation of the decision between mitosis and meiosis in C. elegans.Cell. 1987; 51: 589-599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). By quantitative RT-PCR, we detected a significant amount of prg-1 mRNA levels in germline-less animals, although the total levels were lower than those in wild-type animals (Figure S4A; 30% compared to wild-type at 20°C). Interestingly, we detected little prde-1 mRNA expression in somatic cells in the same germline-less animals (Figure S4A), consistent with its selective expression in PLM neurons (Figure 3A). We further performed prg-1 smFISH and found specific fluorescent signals outside of the germ cells, comparing to control (Figure S4B). However, the seemingly widespread smFISH signals precluded us to discern specific expression of prg-1 in PLM neurons. All together, these data indicate that prg-1 mRNA is present in somatic cells and that its endogenous steady-state expression is much lower than in germ cells. Our findings above suggest that inhibition of axon regeneration by piRNAs does not involve nuclear silencing (Figure 1). We next hypothesized that the piRNA pathway might repress axon regeneration via PTGS rather than TGS. PTGS requires the slicer activity of PIWI (De Fazio et al., 2011De Fazio S. Bartonicek N.

To test whether the slicer activity of PRG-1/PIWI is required for axon regeneration, we performed genome editing at the slicer catalytic site in the endogenous prg-1 locus. In the resulting prg-1(ju1574) animals, the first conserved aspartate of the catalytic triad (D-D-H motif) was mutated to alanine (D583A), creating an A-D-H motif (Figure 4A). Mutations in the corresponding aspartate in other Argonaute proteins abolish slicer activity (Liu et al., 2004Liu J. Carmell M.A. Rivas F.V. Marsden C.G. Thomson J.M. Song J.J. Hammond S.M.

The prg-1(ju1574) A-D-H mutants expressed mRNA levels of prg-1 comparable to wild-type (Figure S4C). prg-1(ju1574) mutant animals became sterile at the fifth generation grown at 25°C (Figure 4E), a progressive sterility phenotype seen in other prg-1 loss-of-function mutants (Bagijn et al., 2012Bagijn M.P.

We studied patient and provider factors associated with clinical stage at diagnosis among women diagnosed at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital in Soweto, Johannesburg in 2015-2016.From face-to-face interviewer-administered questionnaires we compared self-reported socioeconomics, demographics, comorbidities, risk factors, personal and health system barriers, and from patient clinical records, clinical staging, receptor subtype, and tumor grade among 499 consecutive women newly diagnosed with advanced stage (III/IV) breast cancer versus those diagnosed early (stage 0/I/II). Logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with advanced stage at diagnosis.Among the women, 243 (49%) were diagnosed at early and 256 (51%) at advanced stages. In the multiple logistic regression adjusted model, completion of high school or beyond (odds ratio (OR) 0.59, and greater breast cancer knowledge and awareness (OR 0.86) were associated with lower stage of breast cancer at presentation. Advanced stage was associated with Luminal B (OR 2.25) and triple-negative subtypes (OR 3.17) compared to luminal A, with delays >3 months from first breast symptoms to accessing the health system (OR 2.79) and with having more than 1 visit within the referral health system (OR 3.19) for 2 visits; OR 2.73 for ≥3 visits).Limited patient education, breast cancer knowledge and awareness, and health system inefficiencies were associated with advanced stage at diagnosis. Sustained community and healthcare worker education may down-stage disease and improve cancer outcomes."

To overcome this limitation, a deeper understanding of the mechanisms regulating the transition between activated, proliferating MuSCs and differentiation-primed, poorly engrafting progenitors is needed. Here, we show that methyltransferase Setd7 facilitates such transition by regulating the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin in proliferating MuSCs. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Setd7 promotes in vitro expansion of MuSCs and increases the yield of primary myogenic cell cultures. Upon transplantation, both mouse and human MuSCs expanded with a Setd7 small-molecule inhibitor are better able to repopulate the satellite cell niche, and treated mouse MuSCs show enhanced therapeutic potential in preclinical models of muscular dystrophy.

Thus, Setd7 inhibition may help bypass a key obstacle in the translation of cell therapy for muscle disease. The functional unit of skeletal muscle is the myofiber, a large syncytial structure containing hundreds of nuclei generated by fusion of myogenic progenitors with each other. Gene products are able to diffuse freely within these structures, and it has been estimated that replacing a fraction of nuclei in a fiber would be enough to restore sufficient expression of genes mutated in congenital diseases. Thus, skeletal muscle is an ideal target for cell therapy, and this notion fuelled the characterization of adult myogenic progenitors (skeletal muscle stem cells [MuSCs]) which are today among the best understood adult stem cells. Defects in MuSC function have been shown to contribute to the etiology of muscle diseases (Morgan and Zammit, 2010Morgan J.E. Zammit P.S. Direct effects of the pathogenic mutation on satellite cell function in muscular dystrophy.Exp. Cell Res. 2010; 316: 3100-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Age-related declines in muscle mass (sarcopenia) and regenerative potential are associated with MuSC senescence (García-Prat et al., 2016García-Prat L. Martínez-Vicente M. Perdiguero E. Ortet L.

Med. 2015; 21: 1455-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to the use of myogenic cells as gene delivery vehicles to myofibers, the rejuvenation of the stem cell population by transplantation of expanded MuSCs also represents a promising therapeutic avenue (Marg et al., 2014Marg A. Escobar H. Gloy S. Kufeld M. Zacher J. Spuler A. Birchmeier C. Izsvák Z. Spuler S. Human satellite cells have regenerative capacity and are genetically manipulable.J. Clin. Invest. 2014; 124: 4257-4265Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, the translation of the field’s findings into an efficient cellular therapy has been hampered by our inability to mimic the environment that supports MuSC self-renewal, making in vitro cultivation of “transplantable” MuSCs that retain their potency following in vivo engraftment a significant hurdle (Montarras et al., 2005Montarras D.

MuSCs, also called satellite cells, are identified by the expression of transcription factor Pax7 (Seale et al., 2000Seale P. Sabourin L.A. Girgis-Gabardo A. Mansouri A. Gruss P.

Satellite cell of skeletal muscle fibers.J. Biophys. Biochem. Cytol. 1961; 9: 493-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (2697) Google Scholar). In response to tissue injury, MuSCs progress along a stepwise process to generate MyoD-positive proliferating myoblasts and eventually differentiation-committed myocytes. Myocytes “donate” their nuclei by fusing into damaged myofibers, thus playing an essential role in restoring myofiber function. As a population, MuSCs are capable of returning to their niche and replenishing the stem cell pool, although following damage-induced activation most of their progeny lose this potential and eventually commit to differentiation (Kuang et al., 2007Kuang S.

Loss of self-renewal potential is thought to take place shortly following activation, consistent with asymmetric division playing an early role in the maintenance of MuSCs (Dumont et al., 2015aDumont N.A.

Recent efforts to provide sufficient numbers of cells for successful therapy have focused on optimizing in vitro conditions that permit propagation of MuSCs while maintaining an undifferentiated state. Strategies aimed at “rejuvenating” aged myogenic MuSCs have included culturing cells on substrates that mimic the in vivo muscle niche (Gilbert et al., 2010Gilbert P.M. Havenstrite K.L.

However, even young MuSCs cannot be expanded efficiently enough for use in cellular therapies under current conditions. Progress toward this goal has been recently obtained by mimicking the inflammatory milieu present in regenerating skeletal muscle (Fu et al., 2015Fu X. Xiao J. Wei Y. Li S. Liu Y. Yin J. Sun K.

Although these studies have provided encouraging results, the identification of druggable targets that can be manipulated to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of expanded MuSCs while favoring their expansion remains an important goal in the development of stem cell therapies for muscle. Although conventionally known for their role in chromatin remodeling, methyltransferases can hold much broader substrate specificity to include receptors, signaling molecules, and transcription factors (Del Rizzo and Trievel, 2011Del Rizzo P.A.

The su(var)3-9, enhancer-of-zeste, trithorax (SET) domain-containing protein 7 (Setd7), a lysine methyltransferase, provides one of the best examples of the wide-ranging targets such enzymes can have. Studies have found Setd7 can methylate an array of non-histone proteins, including ERα (Subramanian et al., 2008Subramanian K. Jia D. Kapoor-Vazirani P. Powell D.R. Collins R.E. Sharma D. Peng J.

To date, however, little is known about the role of Setd7 in skeletal muscle biology. Data from the C2C12 myoblast cell line suggested a role for Setd7 in regulating myogenesis in vitro, and in particular in modulating differentiation (Tao et al., 2011Tao Y. Neppl R.L. Huang Z.-P.

Cell Biol. 2011; 194: 551-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In this paper, we explore the role of Setd7 in MuSC biology, finding that its expression is critical for effective skeletal muscle regeneration, and for modulating MuSC cell fate both in vitro and in vivo. We identify the underlying mechanism, showing that Setd7 binds to β-catenin and primes its nuclear translocation and interaction with transcription factor BCL-9 (Brack et al., 2009Brack A.S. Murphy-Seiler F. Hanifi J. Deka J. Eyckerman S. Keller C. Aguet M. Rando T.A. BCL9 is an essential component of canonical Wnt signaling that mediates the differentiation of myogenic progenitors during muscle regeneration.Dev. Biol. 2009; 335: 93-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), which is required for progression along the myogenic differentiation cascade (Jones et al., 2015Jones A.E. Price F.D. Le Grand F.

Le Grand F. β-Catenin activation in muscle progenitor cells regulates tissue repair.Cell Rep. 2016; 15: 1277-1290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Finally, we validate that Setd7 can be targeted pharmacologically to expand immature murine and human MuSCs (hMuSCs) in culture leading to enhanced engraftment, self-renewal, and ultimately therapeutic efficiency following transplantation. To examine the expression of Setd7 in myogenesis, we cultured isolated myofibers from Pax7-Cre/yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) mice. No Setd7 expression was detected in Pax7+ quiescent MuSCs upon isolation (Figure 1A, top panel). However, robust expression of Setd7 protein was detected in >90% of MyoD+ cells after 48 and 72 hr in culture, concomitantly with progression along the myogenic continuum (Figure 1A, bottom panel; quantified in Figure 1B). In agreement with these ex vivo findings, analysis of Setd7 transcript levels from MuSCs isolated over a time course of skeletal muscle regeneration in vivo shows an elevation of Setd7 mRNA between day 3–5 after notexin (NTX) damage (Figure 1C). Finally, we found that Setd7 protein increased during induction of primary myoblast differentiation into myotubes (Figures 1D and S1A). In summary, Setd7 expression is upregulated with progression of myogenesis. The elevation of Setd7 observed during myogenic differentiation suggests this event may be important for skeletal muscle development and/or regeneration in vivo. To test this, we generated a mouse model that allows deletion of Setd7 in the myogenic lineage by crossing mice harboring a MyoD-iCre (Chen et al., 2005Chen J.C.J. Mortimer J. Marley J. Goldhamer D.J. MyoD-cre transgenic mice: a model for conditional mutagenesis and lineage tracing of skeletal muscle.Genesis. 2005; 41: 116-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) allele with Setd7-floxed (Lehnertz et al., 2011Lehnertz B. Rogalski J.C. Schulze F.M. Yi L. Lin S. Kast J. Rossi F.M.V. p53-dependent transcription and tumor suppression are not affected in Set7/9-deficient mice.Mol. Cell. 2011; 43: 673-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) mice (Setd7 mKO). In this strain, Setd7 is deleted in both skeletal muscle fibers (Figure 1E) and MuSCs (Figure 2A). These mice had no overt developmental phenotype. Loss of Setd7 had no effect on adult quiescent MuSC numbers (Figure 1F) or on whole-body growth rates (Figure 1G). Finally, adult skeletal muscles from Setd7 mKO and control mice (MyoDiCre/Setd7WT) were histologically similar (Figure S1B) and not significantly different in weight (Figure 1H) or myofiber cross-sectional area (CSA) (Figure S1C). Thus, Setd7 does not appear to be a critical factor for muscle development, although thorough analysis of discrete developmental stages would be required to rule out possible compensatory mechanisms at play. We next tested whether Setd7 is involved in adult skeletal muscle regeneration. Compared to control mice, Setd7 mKO mice showed an increase in Evans Blue dye incorporation over controls 5 days after acute injury (Figure 1I), a sign of reduced myofiber integrity (Hamer et al., 2002Hamer P.W. McGeachie J.M. Davies M.J. Grounds M.D. Evans Blue Dye as an in vivo marker of myofibre damage: optimising parameters for detecting initial myofibre membrane permeability.J. Anat. 2002; 200: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). These findings were supported by histological analysis 14 and 21 days after damage, showing signs of fibrofatty degeneration and an increased frequency of small regenerating myofibers in Setd7 mKO animals (Figure 1J). Together, these findings indicate that depletion of Setd7 in the myogenic lineage leads to an impaired regenerative response. Impairment in the regenerative capacity of Setd7 mKO mice suggests a defect in MuSC function. As expected, we observed deletion of >90% of Setd7 loci in fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-isolated MuSCs from Setd7 mKO mice (Figure 2A). We assessed the proliferation and differentiation potential of MuSCs in vitro in single myofibers cultured for 72 hr (Figure 2B). We found an increase in cells expressing stem/progenitor marker Pax7 and a reduction in differentiating, Myogenin+ (MyoG)+ cells on Setd7 mKO fibers (Figure 2C), suggesting a delay in myogenic progression. Consistent with this finding, after 72 hr in differentiation conditions, myoblast cultures from Setd7 mKO mice contained fewer MyoG+ cells and nuclei within myosin heavy chain+ (MHC) structures, but more Pax7+ cells than controls (Figures 2D and 2E). Consistent with a higher frequency of immature cells, Setd7mKO cultures also expanded at a greater rate. Indeed, the absolute number of MyoD+ cells on cultured fibers was nearly double in Setd7 mKO samples compared to controls, with an increase in the frequency of KO cells incorporating EdU (Figures 2F and 2G). Together, these results show that deletion of Setd7 affects MuSC cell fate by impairing maturation along the myogenic lineage. To gain further insight into the effects of Setd7 deletion, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on cultured MuSCs from Setd7 mKO mice. We identified 1,789 transcripts differentially expressed (768 upregulated and 1,021 downregulated) between Setd7 KO and controls (Figure 2H). Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed a reduction in gene sets linked with muscle differentiation, development, and sarcomere assembly and an enrichment of transcripts related to cell proliferation, cell division, and mitosis in mKO cells (Figure 2I). In agreement with our in vitro assays, Setd7 KO myoblasts appeared to maintain higher expression levels of early MuSC markers such as Myf5 (Crist et al., 2012Crist C.G. Montarras D. Buckingham M. Muscle satellite cells are primed for myogenesis but maintain quiescence with sequestration of Myf5 mRNA targeted by microRNA-31 in mRNP granules.Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 11: 118-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), CD34 (Beauchamp et al., 2000Beauchamp J.R. Heslop L. Yu D.S. Tajbakhsh S. Kelly R.G. Wernig A. Buckingham M.E. Partridge T.A. Zammit P.S. Expression of CD34 and Myf5 defines the majority of quiescent adult skeletal muscle satellite cells.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1221-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar), and Calcitonin receptor (Yamaguchi et al., 2015Yamaguchi M. Watanabe Y. Ohtani T. Uezumi A. Mikami N. Nakamura M. Sato T. Ikawa M. Hoshino M. Tsuchida K. et al.Calcitonin receptor signaling inhibits muscle stem cells from escaping the quiescent state and the niche.Cell Rep. 2015; 13: 302-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) as well as of cell-cycle genes such as CyclinD1 and Cdk6 (Figure 2J). In addition, Setd7 mKO myoblasts had lower expression levels of myogenic regulatory factors MRF4 (Myf6), MyoG, and Mef2c as well as of markers of myofibril assembly such as MyHC, Troponin, and Actin genes (Figure 2J). These transcriptomic data provide further evidence that Setd7 is necessary for progression of MuSCs toward differentiation. The MyoDiCre driver acts early in development, raising the possibility that compensation mechanisms may be activated mitigating the Setd7 KO phenotype. To address this concern, we conditionally deleted Setd7 in adult MuSCs. To this end, we bred mice carrying a Pax7-CreERT2 allele (Lepper et al., 2009Lepper C. Conway S.J. Fan C.-M. Adult satellite cells and embryonic muscle progenitors have distinct genetic requirements.Nature. 2009; 460: 627-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), a CRE-inducible YFP and Setd7FL/– or Setd7+/+ (control) alleles, leading to deletion of Setd7 and expression of YFP in >80% of MuSCs upon tamoxifen administration (Figure S2A). This strain closely recapitulated the phenotype observed in the developmental KO animals. Myofiber cultures from induced Pax7CrERT2/YFP/Setd7FL/− mice displayed a lower frequency of MyoG+/YFP+ cells and an increase in Pax7+/YFP+ MuSCs compared to controls (Figures 3A–3C). In addition, the total number of YFP+ cells per fiber increased, consistent with Setd7 deletion imparting a proliferative advantage (Figure 3C). In these mice, impairment in the regenerative response to damage was similar to that observed in Setd7 mKO mice, including an increase in Evans Blue incorporation at 3 and 5 days post-NTX injury (Figures S2B and S2C) and in the number of eMYH+ myofibers 10 days post-injury (Figures 3D and 3E). Finally, quantification of myofiber CSA 14 days post-damage revealed an increase in the frequency of small regenerating myofibers in Pax7CrERT2/ Setd7FL/− mice over controls, indicating a delayed/impaired regenerative process (Figures 3F and 3G). Thus, Setd7 expression in MuSCs is required for effective myogenic progression for regeneration following acute damage. We next investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying regulation of MuSC behavior by Setd7. Previous data from immortalized C2C12 myoblasts suggest Setd7 binds MyoD and regulates transcription of myogenic genes by catalyzing the formation of H3K4me1 on target promoters (Tao et al., 2011Tao Y. Neppl R.L. Huang Z.-P. Chen J. Tang R.-H. Cao R. Zhang Y. Jin S.-W. Wang D.-Z. The histone methyltransferase Set7/9 promotes myoblast differentiation and myofibril assembly.J. Cell Biol. 2011; 194: 551-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, our experiments do not support this mechanism in primary MuSCs. Instead, immunostaining (Figure 4A) and protein fractionation (Figure 4B) revealed that Setd7 is predominantly localized to the cytoplasm in MuSCs cultured on isolated fibers (Figure 1A), bulk myoblast cultures (Figure 4A), and differentiated myotubes (Figure S3C), suggesting a major role in chromatin regulation is unlikely. In addition, no changes in total H3K4me1 status were observed between WT and Setd7 mKO myoblasts (Figure 4C) or following acute inhibition of Setd7 by PFI-2 (Figures 4D and S3A), a selective and potent small-molecule inhibitor of the catalytic activity of Setd7 (Barsyte-Lovejoy et al., 2014Barsyte-Lovejoy D. Li F. Oudhoff M.J. Tatlock J.H. Dong A. Zeng H. Wu H. Freeman S.A. Schapira M. Senisterra G.A. et al.(R)-PFI-2 is a potent and selective inhibitor of SETD7 methyltransferase activity in cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 12853-12858Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To examine whether Setd7 could be acting on a limited subset of specific genomic loci, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) with a H3K4me1 antibody on primary myoblasts treated with PFI-2 in vitro. This analysis revealed a robust correlation (R = 0.978) in H3K4me1 distribution between vehicle and PFI-2-treated myoblasts (Figure 4E), indicating no major alterations in the status of this mark at the whole-genome level. As previously reported, we observed enrichment of H3K4me1 in genomic areas immediately flanking transcriptional start sites (TSS). However, no noticeable differences in mean peak density were seen between treated myoblast and controls (Figures 4F–4H). Recent reports that H3K4me1 can also mark distal regulatory elements (Blum et al., 2012Blum R. Vethantham V. Bowman C. Rudnicki M. Dynlacht B.D. Genome-wide identification of enhancers in skeletal muscle: the role of MyoD1.Genes Dev. 2012; 26: 2763-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) led us to investigate H3K4me1 content in myoblast and myotube enhancers, identified through a published dataset (Blum et al., 2012Blum R. Vethantham V. Bowman C. Rudnicki M. Dynlacht B.D. Genome-wide identification of enhancers in skeletal muscle: the role of MyoD1.Genes Dev. 2012; 26: 2763-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Again, inhibition of Setd7 failed to produce significant changes in peak density at these annotated enhancer regions (Figure 4I). Finally, using the same workflow, we again failed to observe any significant differences in H3K4me1 status between WT and mKO MuSCs (Figures S3E–S3I). We next examined the relationship between Setd7 and MyoD in primary myoblasts and myotubes. We found little evidence of their co-localization by immunofluorescence (Figure 4J), and we observed them to partition in different subcellular fractions (Figures 4K and S3B). Immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments also failed to demonstrate a physical interaction between MyoD and endogenous Setd7 (Figure 4L), or between MyoD and Myc-tagged Setd7 overexpressed in primary myoblasts and myotubes (Figure S3D). Finally, we found no major alterations in H3K4me1 density at the TSS of known MyoD target genes (MyoG, Myh1, and Mly1) (Blum et al., 2012Blum R. Vethantham V. Bowman C. Rudnicki M. Dynlacht B.D.

Although pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) is a key mediator of glycolysis in cancer cells, lack of selective agents that target PKM2 remains a challenge in exploiting metabolic pathways for cancer therapy. We report that unlike its structural analog shikonin, a known inhibitor of PKM2, lapachol failed to induce non-apoptotic cell death ferroxitosis in hypoxia. However, melanoma cells treated with lapachol showed a dose-dependent inhibition of glycolysis and a corresponding increase in oxygen consumption. Accordingly, in silico studies revealed a high affinity-binding pocket for lapachol on PKM2 structure. Lapachol inhibited PKM2 activity of purified enzyme as well as in melanoma cell extracts. Blockade of glycolysis by lapachol in melanoma cells led to decreased ATP levels and inhibition of cell proliferation. Furthermore, perturbation of glycolysis in melanoma cells with lapachol sensitized cells to mitochondrial protonophore and promoted apoptosis. These results present lapachol as an inhibitor of PKM2 to interrogate metabolic plasticity in tumor cells."

However, utilization of FFP comes with the significant burden of shipping and storage of frozen blood products. Dried or lyophilized plasma (LP) can be stored at room temperature, transported easily, reconstituted rapidly with ready availability in remote and austere environments. We have previously demonstrated that FFP mitigates the endothelial injury that ensues after hemorrhagic shock (HS). In the current study, we sought to determine whether LP has similar properties to FFP in its ability to modulate endothelial dysfunction in vitro and in vivo. Single donor LP was compared to single donor FFP using the following measures of endothelial cell (EC) function in vitro: permeability and transendothelial monolayer resistance; adherens junction preservation; and leukocyte-EC adhesion. In vivo, using a model of murine HS, LP and FFP were compared in measures of HS- induced pulmonary vascular inflammation and edema. Both in vitro and in vivo in all measures of EC function, LP demonstrated similar effects to FFP. Both FFP and LP similarly reduced EC permeability, increased transendothelial resistance, decreased leukocyte-EC binding and persevered adherens junctions. In vivo, LP and FFP both comparably reduced pulmonary injury, inflammation and vascular leak. Both FFP and LP have similar potent protective effects on the vascular endothelium in vitro and in lung function in vivo following hemorrhagic shock. These data support the further development of LP as an effective plasma product for human use after trauma and hemorrhagic shock."
https://openalex.org/W2789100434,"The net amounts of carotenoids accumulating in plant tissues are determined by the rates of biosynthesis and degradation. While biosynthesis is rate-limited by the activity of PHYTOENE SYNTHASE (PSY), carotenoid losses are caused by catabolic enzymatic and non-enzymatic degradation. We established a system based on non-green Arabidopsis callus which allowed investigating major determinants for high steady-state levels of β-carotene. Wild-type callus development was characterized by strong carotenoid degradation which was only marginally caused by the activity of carotenoid cleavage oxygenases. In contrast, carotenoid degradation occurred mostly non-enzymatically and selectively affected carotenoids in a molecule-dependent manner. Using carotenogenic pathway mutants, we found that linear carotenes such as phytoene, phytofluene and pro-lycopene resisted degradation and accumulated while β-carotene was highly susceptible towards degradation. Moderately increased pathway activity through PSY overexpression was compensated by degradation revealing no net increase in β-carotene. However, higher pathway activities outcompeted carotenoid degradation and efficiently increased steady-state β-carotene amounts to up to 500 μg g-1 dry mass. Furthermore, we identified oxidative β-carotene degradation products which correlated with pathway activities, yielding β-apocarotenals of different chain length and various apocarotene-dialdehydes. The latter included methylglyoxal and glyoxal as putative oxidative end products suggesting a potential recovery of carotenoid-derived carbon for primary metabolic pathways. Moreover, we investigated the site of β-carotene sequestration by co-localization experiments which revealed that β-carotene accumulated as intra-plastid crystals which was confirmed by electron microscopy with carotenoid-accumulating roots. The results are discussed in the context of using the non-green calli carotenoid assay system for approaches targeting high steady-state β-carotene levels prior to their application in crops."

Among all motor functions of C. elegans, egg laying is probably the simplest and best-characterized behavior (Schafer, 2005Schafer W.R.

The C. elegans egg-laying circuit comprises a three-component system: vulval muscles (vm1 and vm2) and hermaphrodite-specific HSN and VC (particularly VC4 and VC5) motor neurons (Schafer, 2006Schafer W.F.

Among them, HSN neurons play a central role in driving egg laying by directly stimulating vulval muscles through the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) (Schafer, 2006Schafer W.F.

Previous studies have shown that the membrane excitability of both presynaptic motor neurons (via an anion channel CLH-3) and postsynaptic vulval muscles (via an ERG potassium channel UNC-103) is important for normal egg laying (Branicky et al., 2014Branicky R.

However, as both CLH-3 and UNC-103 mediate hyperpolarizing events, the depolarizing background conductance in the egg-laying circuit remains little known. Transmembrane channel-like (TMC) proteins are a novel family of channel-like proteins conserved from C. elegans to humans (Keresztes et al., 2003Keresztes G. Mutai H. Heller S.

In C. elegans, two tmc genes (tmc-1 and tmc-2) have been cloned, among which tmc-1 is required for the ASH nociceptive neuron-mediated alkaline and salt chemosensation, while the expression and function of tmc-2 remain uncharacterized (Chatzigeorgiou et al., 2013Chatzigeorgiou M.

Commun. 2015; 6: 6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that the C. elegans TMC-1 is expressed in both neurons and muscle cells, while TMC-2 is exclusively expressed in muscle cells. The disruption of TMC proteins hyperpolarizes membrane potential and reduces the rhythmic calcium activities of neurons and muscles involved in egg laying, thereby suppressing the C. elegans egg-laying behavior. Importantly, this egg-laying defect can be rescued by transgenic expression of TMC-1 and TMC-2 as well as mammalian TMC homologs. Furthermore, we revealed that TMC-1 and TMC-2 modulate neuronal and muscular excitability through a depolarizing background leak conductance. Taken together, our results demonstrate a novel role of TMC proteins in setting membrane potential and excitability in both neurons and muscle cells. Moreover, our studies establish TMC proteins as key components of muscular background leak conductances. TMC proteins are evolutionarily conserved and function as putative ion channels involved in hearing, proprioception, and chemosensation (Chatzigeorgiou et al., 2013Chatzigeorgiou M. Bang S.

To investigate the functions of C. elegans TMC proteins, we analyzed the phenotypes of two loss-of-function alleles tmc-1(ok1859) and tmc-2(ok1302). Adult worms lacking either TMC-1 or TMC-2 accumulated more eggs in the uterus and had significantly less progenies (Figures 1A–1C). A more severely defective egg-laying phenotype was observed in tmc-1(ok1859);tmc-2(ok1302) double mutant worms, which retained about 3-fold more eggs compared to wild-type worms (Figures 1A and 1C). Importantly, expression of tmc-1 and tmc-2 driven by their endogenous promoters in tmc-1(ok1859);tmc-2(ok1302) double mutant background fully rescued the egg-laying defect (Figure 1C), strongly supporting that TMC proteins are required for normal egg-laying behavior in C. elegans. We also noticed many late-stage embryos inside tmc mutants but not wild-type worms (Figures 1A and S1). As a result, most tmc-1(ok1859);tmc-2(ok1302) double mutant worms died from internal hatching by day 5 of adulthood (data not shown). After confirming the important roles of TMC proteins in C. elegans egg laying, we next set to identify the expression patterns of TMC-1 and TMC-2. It has been previously reported that TMC-1 is widely expressed in the nervous system as well as muscle cells (Chatzigeorgiou et al., 2013Chatzigeorgiou M. Bang S. Hwang S.W. Schafer W.R. tmc-1 encodes a sodium-sensitive channel required for salt chemosensation in C. elegans.Nature. 2013; 494: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, Zhang et al., 2015Zhang L. Gualberto D.G. Guo X. Correa P. Jee C. Garcia L.R. TMC-1 attenuates C. elegans development and sexual behaviour in a chemically defined food environment.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, it was unclear whether TMC-1 is expressed in HSN neurons and vulval muscles. To confirm the expression of TMC-1 in the egg-laying circuit, we generated a transgenic line expressing a fluorescent reporter protein mCherry driven by a 4.3 kb tmc-1 promoter. Consistent with previous reports (Chatzigeorgiou et al., 2013Chatzigeorgiou M. Bang S. Hwang S.W. Schafer W.R. tmc-1 encodes a sodium-sensitive channel required for salt chemosensation in C. elegans.Nature. 2013; 494: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, Zhang et al., 2015Zhang L. Gualberto D.G. Guo X. Correa P. Jee C. Garcia L.R. TMC-1 attenuates C. elegans development and sexual behaviour in a chemically defined food environment.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we detected the expression of TMC-1 in a wide range of amphid and phasmid neurons as well as body wall muscle cells (Figure 2A). Importantly, TMC-1 is also expressed in HSN neurons as indicated by the co-localization of Ptmc-1::mCherry and Pegl-6::GFP, which has been previously reported to label HSN neurons (Figure 2B) (Ringstad and Horvitz, 2008Ringstad N. Horvitz H.R. FMRFamide neuropeptides and acetylcholine synergistically inhibit egg-laying by C. elegans.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 1168-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, no TMC-1 expression was detected in vulval muscles using our TMC-1 transcriptional reporter line. To rule out the possibility of incomplete expression pattern due to our selected tmc-1 promoter element, we inserted an in-frame gfp cassette into the endogenous tmc-1 locus using the CRISPR/Cas9 knockin method (Li et al., 2015Li W. Yi P. Ou G. Somatic CRISPR-Cas9-induced mutations reveal roles of embryonically essential dynein chains in Caenorhabditis elegans cilia.J. Cell Biol. 2015; 208: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Using this approach, we observed TMC-1 expression in vulval muscles as well as several head neurons and body wall muscles (Figure 2C). As the GFP signal is relatively weak in our single copy GFP insertion tmc-1::GFP line, we performed GFP staining to investigate the subcellular localization of TMC-1 protein. Our staining results suggested that a large portion of TMC-1 proteins might be expressed on the plasma membrane (Figure 2D). In contrast to TMC-1, the expression pattern of TMC-2 was previously unknown. Thus, we constructed a transgenic line expressing GFP driven by a 3.4 kb tmc-2 promoter. This transcriptional reporter line suggested that TMC-2 is expressed in both body wall muscles and vulval muscles, but not neurons (Figure 2E). To further investigate the subcellular localization of TMC-2, we generated a translational reporter line Ptmc-2::TMC-2::GFP in which GFP is fused in-frame with the C terminus of TMC-2. The co-localization of TMC-2::GFP with a plasma membrane marker mCD8::mCherry (Lee and Luo, 1999Lee T. Luo L. Mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker for studies of gene function in neuronal morphogenesis.Neuron. 1999; 22: 451-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar) suggested that TMC-2 is also expressed on the plasma membrane (Figure 2F). Thus, both TMC-1 and TMC-2 are endogenously expressed in the egg-laying circuit and their expression patterns correlate well with their functions in egg laying. Since TMC proteins are also expressed in body wall muscle cells, we wondered whether locomotion behaviors are impaired in the tmc mutants. Wild-type worms crawl on an agar plate with continuous and rhythmic movements of sinusoidal body bends (Xie et al., 2013Xie L. Gao S. Alcaire S.M. Aoyagi K. Wang Y. Griffin J.K. Stagljar I. Nagamatsu S. Zhen M. NLF-1 delivers a sodium leak channel to regulate neuronal excitability and modulate rhythmic locomotion.Neuron. 2013; 77: 1069-1082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Interestingly, tmc mutant worms exhibited normal locomotion speed (Figure S2A). Furthermore, we applied levamisole, an ionotropic acetylcholine receptor agonist that can induce paralysis in C. elegans due to muscle hypercontraction (Rand, 2007Rand J.B. Acetylcholine.WormBook. 2007; (Published online January 30, 2007)https://doi.org/10.1895/wormbook.1.131.1Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), to wild-type and tmc mutant worms. Again, there was no difference between wild-type and tmc-1(ok1859);tmc-2(ok1302) double mutant in the levamisole-induced paralysis assay (Figure S2B). Thus, TMC proteins appear not to have a major role in the normal functions of body wall muscle. To identify the precise action site(s) of TMC proteins in the egg-laying circuit (Figure 3A), we performed a serial of rescue experiments using tissue-specific promoters to drive the expression of tmc-1 and tmc-2 in distinct mutant background. In tmc-1(ok1859) mutant background, the egg-laying defect was largely rescued by expressing TMC-1 driven by its own promoter or by the clh-3 promoter (in HSN neurons) or by the myo-3 promoter (in muscle cells) (Figure 3B). Since TMC-1 is expressed in both HSN neurons and vulval muscles while TMC-2 is only expressed in vulval muscles, when TMC-1 is overexpressed in HSN neurons of tmc-1(ok1859) mutant, TMC-1 in HSN neurons and endogenous TMC-2 in vulval muscles rescued the egg-laying phenotype. On the other hand, when TMC-1 was overexpressed in vulval muscles, vulval muscle cells were activated because TMC-1 became gain of functional. Thus, the overexpression of TMC-1 in either muscles or neurons can rescue the egg-laying phenotype. In tmc-2(ok1302) mutant background, the egg-laying defect was rescued by expressing TMC-2 in muscle cells (Figure 3C). Lastly, in tmc-1(ok1859);tmc-2(ok1302) double mutant, tissue-specific expression of TMC-1 in HSN neurons, HSN + VC4/5 motor neurons (driven by the cat-1 promoter), or muscle cells and TMC-2 in muscle cells all rescued the egg-laying defect (Figure 3D). Thus, TMC-1 and TMC-2 could function redundantly in both neurons and muscle cells to promote egg laying. To further investigate the functions of TMC proteins in the egg-laying circuit, we generated a transgenic line expressing Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), a blue light-activated cation channel, in HSN neurons driven by the clh-3 promoter (Branicky et al., 2014Branicky R. Miyazaki H. Strange K. Schafer W.R. The voltage-gated anion channels encoded by clh-3 regulate egg laying in C. elegans by modulating motor neuron excitability.J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 764-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, Yang et al., 2015Yang X. Wang S. Sheng Y. Zhang M. Zou W. Wu L. Kang L. Rizo J. Zhang R. Xu T. Ma C. Syntaxin opening by the MUN domain underlies the function of Munc13 in synaptic-vesicle priming.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In wild-type transgenic worms, ChR2 activation by blue light (0.1 mW/mm2) robustly stimulated egg laying (Figures 3E and 3F) and calcium influx (Figures S3A–S3C), and these responses were completely dependent on all-trans retinal (ATR), a cofactor of ChR2 (Branicky et al., 2014Branicky R. Miyazaki H. Strange K. Schafer W.R. The voltage-gated anion channels encoded by clh-3 regulate egg laying in C. elegans by modulating motor neuron excitability.J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 764-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, Yang et al., 2015Yang X. Wang S. Sheng Y. Zhang M. Zou W. Wu L. Kang L. Rizo J. Zhang R. Xu T. Ma C. Syntaxin opening by the MUN domain underlies the function of Munc13 in synaptic-vesicle priming.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, tmc mutants laid significantly fewer eggs upon light stimulation (Figures 3E and 3F), although HSN neurons were stimulated to a similar extent between wild-type and tmc mutant worms (Figures S3A–S3C). On the other hand, as vulval muscle is the effector in the C. elegans egg-laying circuit, optogenetic activation of vulval muscle should bypass HSN neurons and trigger egg laying. To test it, we expressed CoChR, a blue light-activated cation channel Chloromonas oogama Channelrhodopsin (Schild and Glauser, 2015Schild L.C. Glauser D.A. Dual Color Neural Activation and Behavior Control with Chrimson and CoChR in Caenorhabditis elegans.Genetics. 2015; 200: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), in vulval muscles of wild-type and tmc mutant worms and stimulated these worms with blue light (0.02 mW/mm2). As we expected, optogenetic activation of vulval muscles triggered robust egg laying (Figures 3G and 3H) and calcium influx (Figures S3D–S3F) and no difference was observed between wild-type and tmc mutant worms. How do TMC proteins act in the egg-laying circuit? HSN neurons release serotonin to stimulate vulval muscles and promote egg laying (Figure 3A). In wild-type worms, egg laying is inhibited by hypertonic salt solutions such as M9 buffer and promoted by exogenous 5-HT (Branicky et al., 2014Branicky R. Miyazaki H. Strange K. Schafer W.R. The voltage-gated anion channels encoded by clh-3 regulate egg laying in C. elegans by modulating motor neuron excitability.J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 764-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, Schafer, 2006Schafer W.F. Genetics of egg-laying in worms.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2006; 40: 487-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) (Figures 3I–3K). Thus, the serotonin reuptake inhibitors fluoxetine and imipramine can promote egg laying by increasing synaptic 5-HT availability (Branicky et al., 2014Branicky R. Miyazaki H. Strange K. Schafer W.R. The voltage-gated anion channels encoded by clh-3 regulate egg laying in C. elegans by modulating motor neuron excitability.J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 764-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, Schafer, 2006Schafer W.F. Genetics of egg-laying in worms.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2006; 40: 487-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We added 5-HT (7.5 mg/mL), fluoxetine (0.5 mg/mL), and imipramine (0.75 mg/mL) in M9 buffer and then examined the egg-laying behaviors in wild-type and tmc mutant worms. Upon 5-HT or fluoxetine stimulation, tmc mutants laid significantly fewer eggs than wild-type animals, supporting the important roles of TMC proteins in the serotonin-mediated egg laying (Figures 3K and 3L). Surprisingly, imipramine treatment slightly increased laid eggs in tmc mutants compared to wild-type worms, indicating that imipramine may promote egg laying of tmc mutants through a serotonin-independent pathway (Figure 3M). As a negative control, we found that egl-30(ad806) mutant, which is defective in the Gq signaling of HSN neurons and has significantly more unlaid eggs, was resistant to these drugs as previously reported (Dempsey et al., 2005Dempsey C.M. Mackenzie S.M. Gargus A. Blanco G. Sze J.Y. Serotonin (5HT), fluoxetine, imipramine and dopamine target distinct 5HT receptor signaling to modulate Caenorhabditis elegans egg-laying behavior.Genetics. 2005; 169: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) (Figures 3I–3N). Puzzled by the distinct effect of imipramine on the egg-laying behavior of tmc mutants, it then came to our attention that imipramine could promote egg laying not only by potentiating serotonin neurotransmission in HSN neurons, but also by directly blocking the hyperpolarizing ether-a-go-go (EAG) K+ channels"
https://openalex.org/W2793223856,"A laboratory study was conducted to study the effects of liming and different biochar amendments on N2O and CO2 emissions from acidic tea field soil. The first experiment was done with three different rates of N treatment; N 300 (300 kg N ha-1), N 600 (600 kg N ha-1) and N 900 (900 kg N ha-1) and four different rates of bamboo biochar amendment; 0%, 0.5%, 1% and 2% biochar. The second experiment was done with three different biochars at a rate of 2% (rice husk, sawdust, and bamboo) and a control and lime treatment (dolomite) and control at two moisture levels (50% and 90% water filled pore space (WFPS)). The results showed that dolomite and biochar amendment significantly increased soil pH. However, only biochar amendment showed a significant increase in total carbon (C), C/N (the ratio of total carbon and total nitrogen), and C/IN ratio (the ratio of total carbon and inorganic nitrogen) at the end of incubation. Reduction in soil NO3--N concentration was observed under different biochar amendments. Bamboo biochar with the rates of 0.5, 1 and 2% reduced cumulative N2O emission by 38%, 48% and 61%, respectively, compare to the control soil in experiment 1. Dolomite and biochar, either alone or combined significantly reduced cumulative N2O emission by 4.6% to 32.7% in experiment 2. Reduction in N2O production under biochar amendment was due to increases in soil pH and decreases in the magnitude of mineral-N in soil. Although, both dolomite and biochar increased cumulative CO2 emission, only biochar amendment had a significant effect. The present study suggests that application of dolomite and biochar to acidic tea field soil can mitigate N2O emissions."

In this study, we inactivated one of the T6SS components vgrG (valine-glycine repeat G) gene in A. baumannii ATCC 19606 and constructed a complementation strain. BEAS-2b human alveolar epithelial cells was adopted to assess bacterial adhesion, and wild female BALB/c mice were used for in vivo experiments to assess the bacterial killing ability to host. Upon deletion of the vgrG gene, increased antimicrobial resistance to ampicillin/sulbactam, but reduced resistance to chloramphenicol were observed. The vgrG mutant strain showed lower growth rate, reduced eukaryotic cell adherence and impaired lethality in mice. However, the vgrG mutant strain is not implicated in biofilm formation. Our study suggests that the Type VI Secretion System core component VgrG contributes to both virulence and antimicrobial resistance in A. baumannii ATCC 19606."

Forty patients (20 AD and 20 MCI) and 21 cognitively normal (CN) controls with a similar age range (± 5 yrs) were recruited. A retinal function imager (RFI) was used to measure BFRs and BFVs of arterioles and venules in the macular region. The thickness of the ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) was measured using Zeiss Cirrus optical coherence tomography. Macular BFRs in AD group were 2.64 ± 0.20 nl/s (mean ± standard deviation) in arterioles and 2.23 ± 0.19 nl/s in venules, which were significantly lower than in MCI and CN groups (P < 0.05). In addition, BFRs in MCI were lower than in CN in both arterioles and venules (P < 0.05). The BFV of the arterioles was 3.20 ± 1.07 mm/s in AD patients, which was significantly lower than in CN controls (3.91 ± 0.77 mm/s, P = 0.01). The thicknesses of GCIPL in patients with AD and MCI were significantly lower than in CN controls (P < 0.05). Neither BFV nor BFR in arterioles and venules was related to age, GCIPL thickness, mini mental state examination (MMSE) score and disease duration in patients with AD and MCI (P > 0.05). The lower BFR in both arterioles and venules in AD and MCI patients together with the loss of GCIPL were evident, indicating the impairment of the two components in the neurovascular-hemodynamic system, which may play a role in disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W2787389701,"Objectives An interrelationship between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and periodontitis has been suggested due to their common pathogenic mechanisms. Protein carbamylation and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation have been shown to be related to autoimmune conditions, including RA, but their association with periodontitis has not been elucidated. Therefore, we assessed whether or not circulating levels of carbamylated protein (CarP) and NETs are associated with periodontitis severity and influenced by periodontal treatment. Methods We conducted a retrospective case-control study that included 40 patients with RA and periodontitis, 30 patients with periodontitis, and 43 systemically and periodontally healthy controls to assess the circulating levels of CarP and NETs and rheumatologic and periodontal conditions. The same assessments were also performed in 22 patients with RA and periodontitis after 2 months of periodontal treatment, including oral hygiene instruction and full-mouth supragingival scaling. Results Patients with RA and periodontitis showed significantly higher serum levels of CarP and NETs than the control group (P = 0.04 and P < 0.001, respectively). The serum levels of CarP and NETs were significantly correlated positively with the mean values of probing depth (P = 0.01 and P = 0.007, respectively) and clinical attachment level (P = 0.007 and P = 0.001, respectively) in the 40 patients with RA and periodontitis. Multiple logistic regression analyses also revealed significantly positive associations between the serum levels of CarP and NETs and moderate to severe periodontitis (P = 0.03 and P = 0.001, respectively). Furthermore, periodontal treatment significantly decreased the serum levels of CarP and NETs in patients with RA and periodontitis (P = 0.03 and P = 0.02). Conclusion The circulating levels of CarP and NETs are associated with periodontitis severity and influenced by periodontal treatment in patients with RA."
https://openalex.org/W2786002077,"Background and purpose Increasing evidence suggests that the omega-3 polyunsaturated acids (n-3 PUFA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), are beneficial to cardiovascular health, promoting relaxation of vascular smooth muscle cells and vasodilation. Numerous studies have attempted to study these responses, but to date there has not been a systematic characterisation of both DHA and EPA mediated vasodilation in conduit and resistance arteries. Therefore, we aimed to fully characterise the n-3 PUFA-induced vasodilation pathways in rat aorta and mesenteric artery. Methods Wire myography was used to measure the vasomotor responses of freshly dissected rat mesenteric artery and aorta. Arteries were pre-constricted with U46619 and cumulative concentrations of either DHA or EPA (10 nM-30 μM) were added. The mechanisms by which n-3 PUFA relaxed arteries were investigated using inhibitors of vasodilator pathways, which include: nitric oxide synthase (NOS; L-NAME), cycloxygenase (COX; indomethacin), cytochrome P450 epoxygenase (CYP450; clotrimazole); and calcium-activated potassium channels (KCa), SKCa (apamin), IKCa (TRAM-34) and BKCa (paxilline). Results Both DHA- and EPA-induced relaxations were partially inhibited following endothelium removal in rat mesenteric arteries. Similarly, in aorta EPA-induced relaxation was partially suppressed due to endothelium removal. CYP450 also contributed to EPA-induced relaxation in mesenteric artery. Inhibition of IKCa partially attenuated DHA-induced relaxation in aorta and mesenteric artery along with EPA-induced relaxation in mesenteric artery. Furthermore, this inhibition of DHA- and EPA-induced relaxation was increased following the additional blockade of BKCa in these arteries. Conclusions This study provides evidence of heterogeneity in the vasodilation mechanisms of DHA and EPA in different vascular beds. Our data also demonstrates that endothelium removal has little effect on relaxations produced by either PUFA. We demonstrate IKCa and BKCa are involved in DHA-induced relaxation in rat aorta and mesenteric artery; and EPA-induced relaxation in rat mesenteric artery only. CYP450 derived metabolites of EPA may also be involved in BKCa dependent relaxation. To our knowledge this is the first study indicating the involvement of IKCa in n-3 PUFA mediated relaxation."
https://openalex.org/W2794056214,"Analyzing massive user-generated microblogs is very crucial in many fields, attracting many researchers to study. However, it is very challenging to process such noisy and short microblogs. Most prior works only use texts to identify sentiment polarity and assume that microblogs are independent and identically distributed, which ignore microblogs are networked data. Therefore, their performance is not usually satisfactory. Inspired by two sociological theories (sentimental consistency and emotional contagion), in this paper, we propose a new method combining social context and topic context to analyze microblog sentiment. In particular, different from previous work using direct user relations, we introduce structure similarity context into social contexts and propose a method to measure structure similarity. In addition, we also introduce topic context to model the semantic relations between microblogs. Social context and topic context are combined by the Laplacian matrix of the graph built by these contexts and Laplacian regularization are added into the microblog sentiment analysis model. Experimental results on two real Twitter datasets demonstrate that our proposed model can outperform baseline methods consistently and significantly."
https://openalex.org/W2786889979,"In vertebrates and invertebrates, neurons and glia are generated in a stereotyped manner from neural stem cells, but the purpose of invariant lineages is not understood. We show that two stem cells that produce leg motor neurons in Drosophila also generate neuropil glia, which wrap and send processes into the neuropil where motor neuron dendrites arborize. The development of the neuropil glia and leg motor neurons is highly coordinated. However, although motor neurons have a stereotyped birth order and transcription factor code, the number and individual morphologies of the glia born from these lineages are highly plastic, yet the final structure they contribute to is highly stereotyped. We suggest that the shared lineages of these two cell types facilitate the assembly of complex neural circuits and that the two birth order strategies—hardwired for motor neurons and flexible for glia—are important for robust nervous system development, homeostasis, and evolution."

Subfoveal (SF) choroidal thickness, and choroidal thickness at 500-μm intervals up to 2500 μm nasal and temporal from the fovea were measured using the SS-OCT. Choroidal thicknesses were compared between groups using Student's t-test. Additionally, Pearson correlations were calculated between diabetes duration, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, and choroidal thickness.Mean diabetes duration was 16.6±9.5 years, while mean glycosylated hemoglobin was 7.7±1.3%. Overall, the choroid was significantly thinner in T2D patients. Individuals with DME had reduced choroidal thickness in all measurements, except at 2000 and 2500-μm nasal positions, compared to healthy controls. There was a moderate correlation between choroidal thickness and HbA1c levels in DME patients (SF: r = 0.342; p = 0.017). Diabetes duration did not correlate significantly with choroidal thickness.SS-OCT measurements revealed that the choroid was significantly thinner in T2D patients, moderate non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy patients, and DME patients than in healthy individuals. Further studies are needed to clarify the effect of diabetes on this layer and the relationship between choroidal thickness and DME."
https://openalex.org/W2792396695,"Myb is a key regulator of hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation and has emerged as a potential target for the treatment of acute leukemia. Using a myeloid cell line with a stably integrated Myb-inducible reporter gene as a screening tool we have previously identified Celastrol, a natural compound with anti-tumor activity, as a potent Myb inhibitor that disrupts the interaction of Myb with the co-activator p300. We showed that Celastrol inhibits the proliferation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and prolongs the survival of mice in an in vivo model of AML, demonstrating that targeting Myb with a small-molecule inhibitor is feasible and might have potential as a therapeutic approach against AML. Recently we became aware that the reporter system used for Myb inhibitor screening also responds to inhibition of C/EBPβ, a transcription factor known to cooperate with Myb in myeloid cells. By re-investigating the inhibitory potential of Celastrol we have found that Celastrol also strongly inhibits the activity of C/EBPβ by disrupting its interaction with the Taz2 domain of p300. Together with previous studies our work reveals that Celastrol independently targets Myb and C/EBPβ by disrupting the interaction of both transcription factors with p300. Myb, C/EBPβ and p300 cooperate in myeloid-specific gene expression and, as shown recently, are associated with so-called super-enhancers in AML cells that have been implicated in the maintenance of the leukemia. We hypothesize that the ability of Celastrol to disrupt the activity of a transcriptional Myb-C/EBPβ-p300 module might explain its promising anti-leukemic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2793669200,"Rapid identification of mycobacteria is important for timely treatment and the implementation of public health measures. The MGIT system ensures rapid detection of mycobacteria, but identification is usually delayed by days to weeks due to further subculture on solid medium. Matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was demonstrated to effectively identify mycobacteria isolates subcultured from solid or liquid media. Reports of identification directly from MGIT broths of both sterile and non-sterile clinical specimens, omitting the subculture step, were limited and not satisfactory before. Our identification method dramatically shortened delay from detection to identification of mycobacteria.We assessed the performance of the Vitek MS IVD version 3.0 for direct identification of NTM and M.tuberculosis from primary MGIT cultures, and assessed two sample preparation methods.Direct identification of NTM from positive MGIT broths, using MALDI-TOF VITEK MS with IVD v.3.0, generated high rates of acceptable results reaching 96.4% (80/83), and up to 100% (83/83) for sample preparations including a 0.1% SDS washing step. The sensitivity of VITEK MS to identify M.tuberculosis from MGIT tubes was 58/72 (80.6%), when using immunochromatography (ICA) test as gold standard. A characteristic colony clumping, wool-like appearance was observed in 48, and all 58 (100%) were correctly identified as M.tuberculosis using MALDI-TOF. The detection rate of M.tuberculosis complex was low (10/24, 41.6%) in the 24 MGIT tubes that was polymicrobial. Our method significantly reduced both the reagent cost and turnaround time.Based on a simplified protocol, we showed that MALDI-TOF MS can be used for rapid identification of NTM directly from primary MGIT cultures within the routine clinical laboratory workflow. However, we recommend an initial ICA test to screen for M.tuberculosis complex, due to a low identification rate of M. tuberculosis in the presence of polymicrobial cultures using MALDI-TOF."
https://openalex.org/W2793018336,"With increasing awareness of reduction of energy and CO2 footprint, more waste is considered recyclable for generating value-added products. Here we reported the negatively-valued iron mud, a waste from groundwater treatment plant, was successfully converted into magnetic adsorbent. Comparing with the conventional calcination method under the high temperature and pressure, the synthesis of the magnetic particles (MPs) by Fe2+/Fe3+ coprecipitation was conducted at environment-friendly condition using ascorbic acid (H2A) as reduction reagent and nitric acid (or acid wastewater) as leaching solution. The MPs with major component of Fe3O4 were synthesized at the molar ratio (called ratio subsequently) of H2A to Fe3+ of iron mud ≥ 0.1; while amorphous ferrihydrite phase was formed at the ratio ≤ 0.05, which were confirmed by vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). With the ratio increased, the crystalline size and the crystallization degree of MPs increased, and thus the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface and the cation-exchange capacity (CEC) decreased. MPs-3 prepared with H2A to Fe3+ ratio of 0.1 demonstrated the highest methylene blue (MB) adsorption of 87.3 mg/g and good magnetic response. The adsorption of MB onto MPs agreed well with the non-linear Langmuir isotherm model and the pseudo-second-order model. Pilot-scale experiment showed that 99% of MB was removed by adding 10 g/L of MPs-3. After five adsorption-desorption cycles, MPs-3 still showed 62% removal efficiency for MB adsorption. When nitric acid was replaced by acid wastewater from a propylene plant, the synthesized MPs-3w showed 3.7 emu/g of saturation magnetization (Ms) and 56.7 mg/g of MB adsorption capacity, 2.8 times of the widely used commercial adsorbent of granular active carbon (GAC). The major mechanism of MPs adsorption for MB was electrostatic attraction and cation exchange. This study synthesized a magnetic adsorbent from the negatively-valued iron mud waste by using an environment-friendly coprecipitation method, which had a potential for treatment of dye wastewater."
https://openalex.org/W2791541461,"Field-scale studies that examine the potential for adverse effects of Bt crop technology on non-target arthropods may supplement data from laboratory studies to support an environmental risk assessment. A three year field study was conducted in Brazil to evaluate potential for adverse effects of cultivating soybean event DAS-81419-2 that produces the Cry1Ac and Cry1F proteins. To do so, we examined the diversity and abundance of non-target arthropods (NTAs) in Bt soybean in comparison with its non-Bt near isoline, with and without conventional insecticide applications, in three Brazilian soybean producing regions. Non-target arthropod abundance was surveyed using Moericke traps (yellow pan) and pitfall trapping. Total abundance (N), richness (S), Shannon-Wiener (H'), Simpson's (D) and Pielou's evenness (J) values for arthropod samples were calculated for each treatment and sampling period (soybean growth stages). A faunistic analysis was used to select the most representative NTAs which were used to describe the NTA community structure associated with soybean, and to test for effects due to the treatments effects via application of the Principal Response Curve (PRC) method. Across all years and sites, a total of 254,054 individuals from 190 taxa were collected by Moericke traps, while 29,813 individuals from 100 taxa were collected using pitfall traps. Across sites and sampling dates, the abundance and diversity measurements of representative NTAs were not significantly affected by Bt soybean as compared with non-sprayed non-Bt soybean. Similarly, community analyses and repeated measures ANOVA, when applicable, indicated that neither Bt soybean nor insecticide sprays altered the structure of the NTA communities under study. These results support the conclusion that transgenic soybean event DAS-81419-2 producing Cry1Ac and Cry1F toxins does not adversely affect the NTA community associated with soybean."
https://openalex.org/W2786767029,"Candida albicans, one of the most common fungal pathogens, is responsible for several yeast infections in human hosts, being resistant to classically used antifungal drugs, such as azole drugs. Multifactorial and multistep alterations are involved in the azole resistance in Candida albicans. In this study, a FCZ-resistant C. albicans strain was obtained by serial cultures of a FCZ-susceptible C. albicans strain in incrementally increasing concentrations of FCZ. We performed an integrated profile of different classes of molecules related to azole resistance in C. albicans by combining several mass-spectrometry based methodologies. The comparative metabolomic study was performed with the sensitive and resistant strains of C.albicans to identify metabolites altered during the development of resistance to fluconazole, while the intervention strains and non-intervention strains of C.albicans to identify metabolites altered involved in cross-resistant to azole drugs. Our analysis of the different metabolites identified molecules mainly involved in metabolic processes such as amino acid metabolism, tricarboxylic acid cycle and phospholipid metabolism. We also compared the phospholipid composition of each group, revealing that the relative content of phospholipids significantly changed during the development of resistance to azole drugs. According with these results, we hypothesized that the metabolism shift might contribute to azole drugs resistance in C.albicans from multifactorial alterations. Our result paves the way to understand processes underlying the resistance to azole drugs in C. albicans, providing the basis for developing new antifungal drugs."

https://openalex.org/W2792267498,"Polycomb group (PcG) proteinB lymphoma Mo-MLV insertion region 1 homolog (BMI1) is a transcriptional repressor that plays an important role in human carcinogenesis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAsthat implicate a negative regulation on gene expression. Deregulation of the expression of miRNAs has been implicated in tumorigenesis. Here, we have shown that knock-down ofBMI1increases theexpression of tumor-suppressivemiRNAs. Elevated levels of expression of miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-15a, miR-429, miR-203were observed upon knock-down of BMI1. Up-regulation of these miRNAsleads to down-regulation ofPRC1 group of proteins i.e. BMI1, RING1A, RING1B and Ub-H2A. Interestingly, overexpression of miR-200a, miR-200b and miR-15aalso produced decreased BMI1 and Ub-H2A protein expression in the CD44+ Cancer Stem Cellpopulation of MDAMB-231cells. Also,elevating the levels of BMI1 regulated miRNAspromoted Mesenchymal to Epithelial transition by regulating the expression of N-Cadherin, Vimentin, β-Catenin, Zeb, Snail thereby resulting in decreased invasion, migration and proliferation.

https://openalex.org/W2949292213,"Neurodevelopmental insults leading to malformations of cortical development (MCD) are a common cause of psychiatric disorders, learning impairments and epilepsy. In the methylazoxymethanol (MAM) model of MCDs, animals have impairments in spatial cognition that, remarkably, are improved by post-weaning environmental enrichment (EE). To establish how EE impacts network-level mechanisms of spatial cognition, hippocampal in vivo single unit recordings were performed in freely moving animals in an open arena. We took a generalized linear modeling approach to extract fine spike timing (FST) characteristics and related these to place cell fidelity used as a surrogate of spatial cognition. We find that MAM disrupts FST and place-modulated rate coding in hippocampal CA1 and that EE improves many FST parameters towards normal. Moreover, FST parameters predict spatial coherence of neurons, suggesting that mechanisms determining altered FST are responsible for impaired cognition in MCDs. This suggests that FST parameters could represent a therapeutic target to improve cognition even in the context of a brain that develops with a structural abnormality."
https://openalex.org/W2786417414,"Chalcone isomerase (CHI) is an important enzyme for flavonoid biosynthesis that catalyzes the intramolecular cyclization of chalcones into (S)-flavanones. CHIs have been classified into two types based on their substrate specificity. Type I CHIs use naringenin chalcone as a substrate and are found in most of plants besides legumes, whereas type II CHIs in leguminous plants can also utilize isoliquiritigenin. In this study, we found that the CHI from the Antarctic plant Deschampsia antarctica (DaCHI1) is of type I based on sequence homology but can use type II CHI substrates. To clarify the enzymatic mechanism of DaCHI1 at the molecular level, the crystal structures of unliganded DaCHI1 and isoliquiritigenin-bound DaCHI1 were determined at 2.7 and 2.1 Å resolutions, respectively. The structures revealed that isoliquiritigenin binds to the active site of DaCHI1 and induces conformational changes. Additionally, the activity assay showed that while DaCHI1 exhibits substrate preference for naringenin chalcone, it can also utilize isoliquiritigenin although the catalytic activity was relatively low. Based on these results, we propose that DaCHI1 uses various substrates to produce antioxidant flavonoids as an adaptation to oxidative stresses associated with harsh environmental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2784817159,"Although a hair bundle is normally deflected by mechanical stimuli, we found that irradiation of a hair cell from the bullfrog's sacculus with ultraviolet light causes rapid motion of the hair bundle toward its tall edge. This movement is associated with opening of mechanotransduction channels and disappears when tip links are disrupted. We localized the absorptive element responsible for the motion to the region directly below the hair bundle and measured an action spectrum similar to the absorption spectra of mitochondrial constituents. Temperature measurements revealed heating around the site of absorption; direct heating of the hair bundle confirmed that the response to light is mediated through heat. Although mechanical offsets of the hair bundle revealed that heat softens gating springs, it also acts directly to open transduction channels. This study identifies an unconventional method of hair-cell stimulation and clarifies the previously unexplained sensitivity of auditory organs to thermal stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2963984280,"Identifying hierarchies and rankings of nodes in directed graphs is fundamental in many applications such as social network analysis, biology, economics, and finance. A recently proposed method identifies the hierarchy by finding the ordered partition of nodes which minimises a score function, termed agony. This function penalises the links violating the hierarchy in a way depending on the strength of the violation. To investigate the resolution of ranking hierarchies we introduce an ensemble of random graphs, the Ranked Stochastic Block Model. We find that agony may fail to identify hierarchies when the structure is not strong enough and the size of the classes is small with respect to the whole network. We analytically characterise the resolution threshold and we show that an iterated version of agony can partly overcome this resolution limit."
https://openalex.org/W2785755459,"The impact of the 24-h ultramarathon race on homocysteine (Hcy) and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) levels, two well-recognized cardiovascular risk factors, has not been deeply investigated. Similarly, no information exists on paraoxonase 1 (PON1), an antioxidant enzyme associated with high-density lipoproteins, which may detoxify oxLDL and Hcy-thiolactone, hence preventing their proatherogenic action. Taking this into account, a competitive 24-h ultramarathon race was organized in Reggio-Emilia (Italy) recruiting professional runners (n = 14) from the Italian Ultramarathon and Trail Association. Blood samples were collected from each participant before, during (14 h), and immediately after (24 h) the competition, thus to monitor the serum changes in Hcy, oxLDL, and PON1 levels, as well as other oxidative stress-related parameters, namely reactive oxygen metabolites (ROM) and total antioxidant capacity (PAT). As a result, a significant PON1 increase was recorded after 14 h of racing that persisted until the end of the performance. The same trend was observed for PAT values, which positively correlated to PON1 levels (R = 0.643, P<0.001). Hcy, oxLDL, and ROM remained almost unchanged throughout the competition. In conclusion, the present study suggested a protective role of PON1 in sustaining the antioxidant defense system and contrasting lipoprotein oxidative modifications over the 24-h race, and did not specifically evidence either Hcy or oxLDL accumulation in such challenging sporting events."
https://openalex.org/W2785533113,"Objective Fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) has been proposed to be a potential predictive factor of gestational hypertension or preeclampsia (GH/PE) because of its integrating metabolic and inflammatory responses. Women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are more likely to develop both GH/PE, than the normal population. The aim of our study was to examine the relationship between plasma FABP4 in the second trimester of pregnancy and the risk of GH/PE in women with GDM. Methods This was a nested case-control study conducted within a large on-going prospective cohort study conducted at Peking University First Hospital. A total of 1344 women, who were diagnosed with GDM, according to a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test, participated in the GDM One-Day Clinic at Peking University First Hospital from February 24, 2016 to February 9, 2017. Of the 748 GDM women who agreed to the blood sample collection, 637 were followed until their delivery. The cases included GDM patients who developed gestational hypertension or preeclampsia (GDM-GH/PE group, n = 41). Another 41 matched GDM women without major complications were selected as the control group (GDM group). Results The incidence of GH/PE was 6.44% and 3.30% for preeclampsia. The level of the second trimester plasma FABP4 in the GDM-GH/PE group was significantly higher than the GDM group (17.53±11.35 vs. 12.79±6.04 ng/ml, P = 0.020). The AUC ROC for the second trimester plasma FABP4 predicted GH/PE in the GDM patients alone was 0.647 (95%CI 0.529–0.766). Multivariate analysis showed that the elevated second trimester FABP4 level was independently associated with GH/PE in the GDM patients (OR 1.136 [95% CI 1.003–1.286], P = 0.045). Conclusions Increased second trimester plasma FABP4 independently predicted GH/PE in GDM patients."

In the present study, we evaluated its antitumor efficacy and the possible mechanism. By MTT assay, IMB5043 inhibited the proliferation of various human cancer cells lines, especially hepatocarcinoma SMMC-7721 cells. IMB5043 blocked cell cycle with G2/M arrest, induced cell apoptosis, and inhibited the migration and invasion of SMMC-7721 cells. As verified by comet assay and γ-H2AX foci formation, IMB5043 caused DNA damage and activated ATM, Chk2 and p53 through phosphorylation. As shown by Gene microarray analysis, the differentially expressed genes in SMMC-7721 cells treated with IMB5043 were highly related to cell death and apoptosis. IMB5043 suppressed the growth of hepatocarcinoma SMMC-7721 xenograft in athymic mice. By histopathological examination, no lesions were found in bone marrow and various organs of the treated mice. Our findings reveal that IMB5043 as an active compound consisting of both pyridazinone and thiophene moieties exerts antitumor efficacy through activation of ATM-Chk2 pathway. IMB5043 may serve as a promising leading compound for the development of antitumor drugs."

https://openalex.org/W2787456186,"Background Metastasis is a major cause of mortality in cancer. Identifying prognostic factors that distinguish patients who will experience metastasis in the short-term and those that will be free of metastasis in the long-term is of particular interest in current medical research. The objective of this study was to examine if select genetic polymorphisms can differentiate colorectal cancer patients based on timing and long-term risk of metastasis. Methods The patient cohort consisted of 402 stage I-III colorectal cancer patients with microsatellite instability (MSI)-low (MSI-L) or microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors. We applied multivariable mixture cure model, which is the proper model when there is a substantial group of patients who remain free of metastasis in the long-term, to 26 polymorphisms. Time-dependent receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to determine the change in discriminatory accuracy of the models when the significant SNPs were included. Results After adjusting for significant baseline characteristics, two polymorphisms were significantly associated with time-to-metastasis: TT and TC genotypes of the XRCC3 Thr241Met (p = 0.042) and the 3R/3R genotype of TYMS 5’-UTR variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) (p = 0.009) were associated with decreased time-to-metastasis. ROC curves showed that the discriminatory accuracy of the model is increased slightly when these polymorphisms were added to the significant baseline characteristics. Conclusions Our results indicate XRCC3 Thr241Met and TYMS 5’-UTR VNTR polymorphisms are associated with time-to-metastasis, and may have potential biological roles in expediting the metastatic process. Once replicated, these associations could contribute to the development of precision medicine for colorectal cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2785650729,"The selection of seismic attributes is a key process in reservoir prediction because the prediction accuracy relies on the reliability and credibility of the seismic attributes. However, effective selection method for useful seismic attributes is still a challenge. This paper presents a novel selection method of seismic attributes for reservoir prediction based on the gray relational degree (GRD) and support vector machine (SVM). The proposed method has a two-hierarchical structure. In the first hierarchy, the primary selection of seismic attributes is achieved by calculating the GRD between seismic attributes and reservoir parameters, and the GRD between the seismic attributes. The principle of the primary selection is that these seismic attributes with higher GRD to the reservoir parameters will have smaller GRD between themselves as compared to those with lower GRD to the reservoir parameters. Then the SVM is employed in the second hierarchy to perform an interactive error verification using training samples for the purpose of determining the final seismic attributes. A real-world case study was conducted to evaluate the proposed GRD-SVM method. Reliable seismic attributes were selected to predict the coalbed methane (CBM) content in southern Qinshui basin, China. In the analysis, the instantaneous amplitude, instantaneous bandwidth, instantaneous frequency, and minimum negative curvature were selected, and the predicted CBM content was fundamentally consistent with the measured CBM content. This real-world case study demonstrates that the proposed method is able to effectively select seismic attributes, and improve the prediction accuracy. Thus, the proposed GRD-SVM method can be used for the selection of seismic attributes in practice."

The study enrolled individuals who tested negative on rapid HIV tests performed at five HIV counseling and testing (HCT) clinics, which included four antenatal clinics and one general HCT clinic.The study enrolled 9547 predominantly black participants (96.6%) with a median age of 27 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 23-31). There were 1661 non-pregnant and 7886 pregnant participants largely enrolled from the general and antenatal HCT clinics, respectively. NAAT detected HIV infection in 61 participants (0.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.4-0.8) in the whole study. A high proportion of study participants, 62.8% and 63.0%, were unaware of their partner's HIV status; and also had high prevalence, 88.5% and 99.5%, of recent unprotected sex in the general and pregnant population, respectively. Consistent use of condoms was associated with protection against HIV infection in the general population. Trends of higher odds for HIV infection were observed with most demographic and HIV risk factors at univariate analysis, however, multivariate analysis did not show statistical significance for almost all these factors. A significantly lower risk of HIV infection was observed in circumcised men (p <0.001).These data show that a large segment of sexually active people in the Tshwane district of SA have high risk exposure to HIV. The detection of newly diagnosed HIV infections in all study clinics reflects a wide distribution of individuals who are capable of sustaining HIV transmission in the setting where HIV risk behaviour is highly prevalent. A questionnaire that captures HIV risk behaviour would be useful during HIV counselling and testing to ensure that there is a systematic way of identifying HIV risk factors and that counselling is optimised for each individual. HIV risk behaviour surveillance could be used to inform relevant HIV prevention interventions that could be implemented at a community or population level."
https://openalex.org/W2789460292,"The policy positions parties choose are central to both attracting voters and forming coalition governments. How then should parties choose positions to best represent voters? Laver and Sergenti show that in an agent-based model with boundedly rational actors a decision rule (Aggregator) that takes the mean policy position of its supporters is the best rule to achieve high congruence between voter preferences and party positions. But this result only pertains to representation by the legislature, not representation by the government. To evaluate this we add a coalition formation procedure with boundedly rational parties to the Laver and Sergenti model of party competition. We also add two new decision rules that are sensitive to government formation outcomes rather than voter positions. We develop two simulations: a single-rule one in which parties with the same rule compete and an evolutionary simulation in which parties with different rules compete. In these simulations we analyze party behavior under a large number of different parameters that describe real-world variance in political parties’ motives and party system characteristics. Our most important conclusion is that Aggregators also produce the best match between government policy and voter preferences. Moreover, even though citizens often frown upon politicians’ interest in the prestige and rents that come with winning political office (office pay-offs), we find that citizens actually receive better representation by the government if politicians are motivated by these office pay-offs in contrast to politicians with ideological motivations (policy pay-offs). Finally, we show that while more parties are linked to better political representation, how parties choose policy positions affects political representation as well. Overall, we conclude that to understand variation in the quality of political representation scholars should look beyond electoral systems and take into account variation in party behavior as well."
