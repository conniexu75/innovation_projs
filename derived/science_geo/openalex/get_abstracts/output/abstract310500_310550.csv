https://openalex.org/W2002897543,"Holocene and glacial carbon isotope data of benthic foraminifera from shallow to mid-depth cores from the northeastern subpolar Atlantic show that this region was strongly stratified, with carbon-13-enriched glacial North Atlantic intermediate water (GNAIW) overlying carbon-13-depleted Southern Ocean water (SOW). The data suggest that GNAIW originated north of the polar front and define GNAIW end-member carbon isotope values for studies of water-mass mixing in the open Atlantic. Identical carbon isotope values in the core of GNAIW and below the subtropical thermocline are consistent with rapid cycling of GNAIW through the northern Atlantic. The high carbon isotope values below the thermocline indicate that enhanced nutrient leakage in response to increased ventilation may have extended into intermediate waters. Geochemical box models show that the atmospheric carbon dioxide response to nutrient leakage that results from an increase in ventilation rate may be greater than the response to nutrient redistribution by conversion of North Atlantic deep water into GNAIW. These results underscore the potential rule of Atlantic Ocean circulation changes in influencing past atmospheric carbon dioxide values."
https://openalex.org/W1977026092,"Isotopic analyses of nickel in samples from the differentiated meteorite Chervony Kut revealed the presence of relative excesses of (60)Ni ranging from 2.4 up to 50 parts per 10(4). These isotopic excesses are from the decay of the now extinct short-lived nuclide (60)Fe and provide clear evidence for the existence of (60)Fe over large scales in the early solar system. Not only was (60)Fe present at the time of melting and differentiation (that is, Fe-Ni fractionation) of the parent body of Chervony Kut but also later at the time when basaltic magma solidified at or near the surface of the planetesimal. The inferred abundance of (60)Fe suggests that its decay alone could have provided sufficient heat to melt small (diameters of several hundred kilometers) planetary bodies shortly after their accretion."
https://openalex.org/W1967700738,"Evidence is presented that the lattice vibrations of compacted C(60)/C(70) fullerite microcrystals consist predominantly of localized modes. Vibrational motions of the rigid molecules (""buckyballs"") have been identified as well as their internal vibrations. Debye waves play only a relatively minor role, except below approximately 4 kelvin. By comparison with other crystalline materials, for these materials the Einstein model of the specific heat and thermal conductivity of solids, which is based on the assumption of atoms (in this case, buckyballs) vibrating with random phases, is in much better agreement with the measurements than the Debye model, which is based on collective excitations."

https://openalex.org/W1969504029,"High-resolution Raman spectroscopy of polycrystalline films of C(60) deposited under ultrahigh-vacuum conditions show that the spectrum below 244 +/- 3 kelvin consists of a superposition of two components whose relative contributions are temperature-dependent. The spectrum of the more intense of the two components is similar to that obtained for air- or oxygen-exposed samples of C(60) at room temperature, whereas the spectrum above 244 +/- 3 kelvin corresponds to one previously reported for oxygen-free samples of C(60). The results may indicate an order-disorder phase transition involving the percolation of a cluster of C(60) molecules engaged in coherent Raman scattering."

The conditions and assumptions under which all resistances can be determined independently are discussed, and preliminary experiments are reported. The effect of a monomolecular layer upon the transport of vapor is thus measured on a wind-swept surface, and its effect upon heat transport in the water is indicated."
https://openalex.org/W2011122301,"The light transmission of different soil materials was measured in a Beckman spectrophotometer. The relative energy transmission was greatest at the red end of the spectrum. A seed sensitive to red light will have the capacity to germinate at nearly the maximum depth of penetration by visible light, where the risk of early desiccation is diminished."

https://openalex.org/W2085398579,"Particle physicists are learning to their discomfiture that for one country to plan a multibillion-dollar accelerator, then ask other countries to help build it, is a recipe for frustration. That's the lesson emerging from the struggles to build the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC), the mammoth accelerator that is now in limbo as officials wait to see whether Japan and other nations will pitch in. But a group of laboratory directors who are already planning the next-generation accelerator - a large linear collider that will address physics the SSC can't probe - is taking steps to ensure that it will be an international collaboration from day one. The machine would be a linear accelerator tens of kilometers long with an energy limit of 1 TeV, and would collide electrons and positrons. Two international collaborations are studying designs for radiofreqency cavities that would generate powerful accelerating gradients. A third international group is working on learning how to focus electron and positron beams down to 60 nm in diameter. The proposed accelerator would likely cost $2 to $3 billion, and one possible location is the big island of Hawaii."

Also, the designation ""Engineers"" should have read, ""Engineers, total."" Labeled correctly, the graph would indicate, for example, that among all employed white scientists and engineers in 1988, about 50% were scientists and 50% were engineers. Of employed black scientists and engineers, about 70% were scientists and only about 30% were engineers. Among Hispanics, the breakdown was about 45% scientists and 55% engineers."
