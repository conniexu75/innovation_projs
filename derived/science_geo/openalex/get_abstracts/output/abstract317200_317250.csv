https://openalex.org/W2029131085,"Lactate dehydrogenase from beef tissues may be resolved electrophoretically into five isozymes each of which is a tetramer. These tetramers can be dissociated into monomers by freezing in 1M sodium chloride. On thawing, reassociation into functional tetramers occurs. On the basis of charge and amino acid composition there are two kinds of monomers. Lactate dehydrogenase-1 contains one kind of monomer and lactate dehydrogenase-5 the other kind. A mixture of equal quantities of these two isozymes, after dissociation and reassociation, leads to the production of all five isozymes in the expected proportions of 1:4:6:4:1."

https://openalex.org/W2057220353,"I have often discussed this and related subjects but I still find it difficult to call attention to all the relevant points — points which we all should remember. Actually, in the first part of the discussion, I would prefer to replace in the title, so kindly suggested by Dr. Zichichi, the “Events” by “Initial Conditions”."
https://openalex.org/W1972224256,"Volcanic rocks dredged from seamounts, fault ridges, and other major geological features of the northeast Pacific Ocean include a wide variety of basalts. Most of these are vesicular, porphyritic types with near analogues in the Hawaiian and other oceanic islands. In addition, aluminous basalts and diabasic theoleiites impoverished in potassium also occur. There is no simple correlation of composition, degree of oxidation, vesiculation, or hydration of these basalts with texture, or depth of dredge site. Most samples appear to have been extruded at much shallower depths than those now pertaining at the dredge site. The distribution of these basalts suggests that the andesite line coincides with or lies on the continent side of the foot of the continental slope."
https://openalex.org/W1970537757,"Phase transformation curves for HfO(2) and ZrO(2) have been made. Transformation hysteresis is discussed. The transformation of monoclinic to tetragonal as temperature increases occurs over the range 1000 degrees to 1200 degrees C in ZrO(2), and 1500 degrees to 1600 degrees C in HfO(2). With decreasing temperature the transition back to monoclinic occurs from 970 degrees to 750 degrees C in ZrO(2) and 1550 degrees to 1450 degrees C in HfO(2). These transformations have been visually observed in ZrO(2), but not in HfO(2)."
https://openalex.org/W1979999822,"Rust growth in the bean leaf was accompanied by the appearance of one new malate dehydrogenase isozyme and continuation of one otherwise lost during the development of the healthy leaf. The new isozyme was contributed by the fungus, the other by the leaf. Both enzymes were cytoplasmic proteins. Rusting caused the loss of a mitochondrial isozyme."

https://openalex.org/W2028086561,"The sequential constraints of pairs of letters were computed for a series of graded readers. Information in single letters is about the same for all texts. Redundancy decreases with increasing grade in a regular way, while mean word length increases. A third reader has about the same redundancy as simple adult text. The constraints in a first reader are considerable, whereas those in a fifth reader approach those in average adult text."

https://openalex.org/W1975472330,Well-formed single crystals of plutonium dioxide were precipitated from a silicate glass and examined as an inclusion in a glass fiber drawn from the parent material. Excellent atomic scattering factors for Pu(+4) may be obtained with these specimens.

A theory is offered to explain the results."

https://openalex.org/W2020360607,"Results are summarized from a variety of surveys of natural radioactivity in northern New England. These include a radiogeological survey of bedrock radioactivity in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont; a personnelmonitoring survey of population exposure to external gamma radiation in selected areas of high and low bedrock radioactivity; and a survey of the concentration of Ra/sup 226/, R/sup 224/, and Posup 210/ in teeth extracted from life- or long-time residents of these same areas. The possibility that chronic exposure to low doses of ionizing radiation is of etiologic significance in the genesis of certain human diseases is discussed. Difficulties inherent in measurements of population exposure from natural radioactivity are evaluated. Results of the survey showed no significant relationship between equivalent uranium concentration and the level of Ra/sup 226/ and Po/sup 210/ in teeth. While the geological data suggested considerable intercategory variation in terrestrial sources of radioactivity, dosimetric evaluation of population exposure revealed relatively small differences with respect to external gamma radiation.

https://openalex.org/W2063612308,"Two deep-sea cores containing Cretaceous, Paleocene, and Pleistocene sediments from an oceanic rise approximately 500 miles southeast of Cape Town contained well-preserved fossil foraminiferal ooze made up of about 97 percent planktonic forms, including species of Guembelina and Hedbergella. High percentages of particles less than 53 micro in diameter in the Cretaceous and Paleocene sediments indicate a deep-water open-ocean depositional environment. These sediments are the oldest recovered so far from the Indian Ocean."
https://openalex.org/W1975984530,"A classical mechanical system is considered to demonstrate the nature of the problem. The difficulty of using a physical experiment to distinguish the different directions of time flow is illustrated. Experiments on the beta decay of neutrons, nonleptonic decay of the LAMBDA hyperon, and K deg decay that might reveal time variance and CPT-variance are discussed. In CPT-invariance, violation of which would permit determination of time flow, C stands for the interchange of matter and antimatter; P, for the interchange of left and right (handedness); and T, for the interchange of past and future.

https://openalex.org/W2004182547,"Samples of graphite, partly converted to diamond by shock, and meteoritic graphite were studied by transmission electron microscopy. The shocked graphite remained in the form of single crystals and was mildly deformed while the diamond which had formed was anhedral and polycrystalline. The meteoritic graphite contained minor amounts of troilite (FeS) and elemental sulfur but no detectable carbon phase other than graphite."

https://openalex.org/W1999667219,"Hydrodynamic, topographic, and geologic factors control flow of groundwater toward an effluent stream. Features of such flow are illustrated by a hydraulic model that simulates the stream and surrounding consolidated rocks. Colored ink in the flow system marks progress toward the stream. Visual analysis shows that groundwater moves into the effluent stream along curvilineal flow lines. The total head of groundwater beneath the stream increases with depth."

https://openalex.org/W1978859475,"New fields have been devised, for a double-row edge-punched card, which require only three edge holes per field in place of the customary four. The new fields record every digit and no digit appears more than once. Any letter of the alphabet can be readily punched into a single field. Sorting of the new fields (compared to sorting of existing fields) requires fewer needle passes for both alphabetical and numerical searching, if a single search is made; this does not apply in arranging the cards in sequence."
