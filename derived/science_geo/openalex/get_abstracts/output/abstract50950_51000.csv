https://openalex.org/W1897055678,"Abstract Fetuin isolated from fetal calf serum was shown to contain 3 carbohydrate units which are attached to serine and threonine residues on the peptide chain and are distinct from the 3 asparagine-linked heteropolysaccharides previously reported to occur in this protein. The O-glycosidically linked saccharide units were obtained as reduced oligosaccharides after alkaline borohydride treatment of fetuin and as glycopeptides subsequent to pronase digestion of this protein. Gel filtration and Dowex 1 chromatography of the oligosaccharides resulted in the isolation of a tri- and a tetrasaccharide which were made up of sialic acid, galactose, and N-acetylgalactosaminitol residues and could be converted after selective removal of the sialic acid to the same disaccharide (galactosyl-N-acetylgalactosaminitol). Studies employing periodate oxidation and glycosidase digestion indicated that the structure of the tetrasaccharide was N-acetylneuraminyl-(2 →3)-β-d-galactopyranosyl-(1 →3)[N-acetylneuraminyl-(2 →6)]-N-acetylgalactosaminitol and that the trisaccharide differed only by the absence of the sialyl residue linked to the N-acetylgalactosaminitol. Glycopeptides containing the alkali-labile carbohydrate units were purified on Sephadex and diethylaminoethylcellulose columns. In this manner peptides distinguished by a high proline content and containing 1 tetrasaccharide, 1 trisaccharide, or 2 trisaccharides were obtained. Alkaline sulfite treatment of these glycopeptides indicated that 2 serine and 1 threonine residue in each fetuin molecule is involved in the attachment of carbohydrate units. The tetrasaccharide was found to be linked only to serine while attachment of trisaccharide units involved a serine and a threonine residue which were located in close proximity in the peptide chain. Smith periodate degradation of sialic acid-free glycopeptides resulted in removal of the galactose and yielded a product from which complete release of N-acetylgalactosamine was accomplished by digestion with α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase although no cleavage of this sugar was effected by the action of β-N-acetylhexosaminidase. This indicated that the alkali-labile units of fetuin are attached to the peptide chain by α-D-N-acetylgalactosaminyl-(1 →3)-serine (threonine) bonds. Of the total carbohydrate of fetuin 21%, including all three of the galactosamine residues, was shown to be located in the O-glycosidically linked units with the remainder occurring in the more alkali-stable N-glycosidically bound form. The alkaline sulfite treatment employed in this investigation produced in good yield the sulfonyl derivatives of the amino acids and amino sugar involved in the glycopeptide linkage. Since the cysteic acid and α-amino-β-hydroxybutyric acid obtained in this manner do not separate on the amino acid analyzer, a chromatographic procedure employing Dowex 1 was developed which permitted resolution of these two components."

https://openalex.org/W2083310651,"The bromodeoxyuridine; sensitivity of 33258 Hoechst fluorescence allows microfluorometric analysis of sister chromatid exchanges in human metaphase chromosomes. The frequency of sister chromatid exchanges among chromosomes correlates with chromosome length. Exchanges appear to occur predominantly in interband regions, as defined by quinacrine fluorescence, or very near band-interband junctions. A few regions are involved unusually frequently."
https://openalex.org/W1543246454,"Abstract Erythropoiesis in the chick involves the synthesis of multiple hemoglobins. The hemoglobins found in the late embryo and in the adult chicken are called hemoglobins A and D, and the hemoglobins found in the early chick embryo are called hemoglobins E, P, and M. We have determined the peptide chain composition of the embryonic hemoglobins E and P. During the chromatographic separation of hemoglobins E and P from the red cell lysate of a 5-day embryo, a previously unsuspected hemoglobin (M) was discovered which appears to be present also in 7-day embryos. Using rabbit antisera against hemoglobins A and D, it was found that hemoglobin E was very similar antigenically to A and that hemoglobins M and D were also related, although not as closely as hemoglobins E and A. Comparison of peptide maps of the S-aminoethylated globins of A, D, E, P, and M confirmed these relationships. Hemoglobin E appears to contain the αa chain of hemoglobin A, while the peptide map of the other (e) chain bears some resemblance to that of the β chain of adult hemoglobin A. An amino acid analysis of A globin and its individual chains and of E globin and its individual chains confirmed that the α chains of hemoglobins A and E are very similar, if not identical, while the e and β chains of these two hemoglobins differ. Hemoglobin P is composed of two closely related α-like chains, π and π', and a β-like chain, ρ. The ρ and the e chain share many common peptides on their peptide maps. Hemoglobin M contains the αd chain found in hemoglobin D, while the β-like chain of hemoglobin M resembles the e chain of hemoglobin E."

https://openalex.org/W1484294447,"Abstract We have studied the accuracy of DNA synthesis in vitro by purified avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase) using synthetic polynucleotide templates. The enzyme catalyzes the incorporation of an exceptionally large number of incorrectly paired bases when copying ribopolynucleotide and deoxyribopolynucleotide templates. The frequency of error is approximately 1 in 600 when copying homopolymer templates and 1 in 6000 when copying alternating copolymer templates. The product of the reaction, using a template of polyriboadenylic acid of 2500 nucleotides long hybridized to an initiator of oligodeoxythymidylate of 12 to 18 nucleotides long was analyzed by velocity sedimentation and equilibrium density gradient centrifugation. The results indicate that: (a) the entire length of the given template is copied; (b) the incorrectly base-paired nucleotides are an integral part of the polynucleotide product; and (c) these errors are randomly distributed. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis of the purified polymerase showed two subunits, α and β. The incorporation of the correct and incorrect nucleotides catalyzed by the active α subunit appears to be not influenced by the inactive β subunit. The purified polymerase has no detectable exoor endodeoxyribonuclease activity. AMV DNA polymerase exhibits identical requirements for the incorporation of the correct and incorrect nucleotides. The error rate is not a function of the number of initiator termini, Mg2+ concentration, time of incubation, or the amount of enzyme. The error rate is, however, dependent on the type of the template and on the ratio of correct to incorrect nucleotides in the reaction mixture. If this DNA polymerase from avian myeloblastosis virus makes similar errors in vivo this enzyme may be mutagenic."
https://openalex.org/W1588135440,"Abstract The membrane-bound enzyme nitrate reductase from Escherichia coli has been solubilized and purified 112-fold. The purified enzyme appeared homogeneous by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and in the analytical ultracentrifuge. The molecular weight of the enzyme, as measured on an agarose column, was 720,000 and, as measured in the ultracentrifuge, was 773,600. The s0 value was determined by sedimentation analysis to be 23.0 S. Electron micrographs showed the enzyme to be spherical which was in agreement with the intrinsic viscosity as measured in the magnetic visco-densimeter. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that the enzyme is composed of two different subunits with molecular weights of 142,000 and 58,000 and that these are present in roughly equal amounts. As determined by activation analysis, the enzyme contained 3.2 ± 0.5 moles of molybdenum per mole of enzyme. These data are consistent with a structure composed of four large polypeptides, four small polypeptides, and four molecules of molybdenum per molecule of enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1546565444,"Abstract R-DNA polymerase activity in HeLa cells is found in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. Extensive purification of the enzyme activity in the cytoplasm shows it to be separable into two distinct activities, I and II. Comparable purification of the nuclear R-DNA polymerase yields one main enzymatic activity which is apparently similar to cytoplasmic R-DNA polymerase II. R-DNA polymerase I copies poly(A) templates but not poly(C), poly(I), or poly(U) homopolymers, whereas Form II of the enzyme can copy all of the homopolymers. The two forms of the enzyme show different inhibition patterns in the presence of salt or ethanol. Both R-DNA polymerases are 110,000 daltons as measured by sedimentation studies and show Km values for deoxynucleoside triphosphates (approximately 5 x 10-7 m) that are one order of magnitude or more lower than the Km values of the DNA dependent-DNA polymerases of HeLa cells. Neither HeLa cell R-DNA polymerase I nor II is inhibited by antisera prepared against the reverse transcriptase obtained from either the Mason-Pfizer monkey virus, the Woolly monkey virus, or the Rauscher murine leukemia virus."

https://openalex.org/W2025887596,"Abstract Four new type C viruses were isolated from putatively virus-negative baboon lung, kidney, and testicular cells by cocultivation with several permissive host cell lines. The baboon type C viruses are infectious for cells from various mammalian species, but do not replicate in any baboon cell lines so far tested. These viruses can be distinguished from other major classes of mammalian type C viruses, including previous isolates from primates, but are most closely related to endogenous feline viruses of the RD-114/CCC group. By immunologic criteria, viral host range, and nucleic acid hybridization studies, the baboon type C viruses are highly related to one another and represent a distinct new class of endogenous primate type C viruses."
https://openalex.org/W1487223647,"Abstract Native sodium and potassium ion-activated adenosine triphosphatase ((Na+ + K+)-ATPase) and the larger polypeptide chain of this enzyme have been used as antigens to obtain specific antibodies. It is demonstrated that these antibodies bind to the native enzyme only at sites on one or the other of the two polypeptide subunits. The locations of the antigen-antibody complexes were determined with the electron microscope using ferritin conjugated γ-globulins. These experiments demonstrate that the antigenic sites on the large subunit, recognized by the anti-large chain antibody, are located only on the inner surface of the plasma membrane in the intact cell. The γ-globulins studied in these experiments do not inhibit (Na+ + K+)-ATPase when they are bound to the enzyme at saturating concentrations. These results rule out any mechanisms for this enzyme which require large movements of the protein through the plane of the bilayer, and therefore rule out any diffusional carrier mechanism for the active transport of alkali metal ions."

https://openalex.org/W2023777713,"Specific immunologic unresponsiveness is induced by injecting adult or neonatal mice with antibody against antigen-specific receptor (antireceptor antibody). Suppression in mice treated as adults lasts several weeks, and cells from these suppressed mice respond normally in culture. In contrast, unresponsiveness induced in neonatal mice is long-lasting; cells from these mice do not respond in culture and do not affect the response of normal cells. Evidently, antireceptor antibody reversibly blocks antigen receptors in adult animals, but induces unresponsiveness in neonatal mice by depleting the clone of receptor-bearing cells."
https://openalex.org/W2019542468,"Protein studies have uncovered an apparent case of convergent evolution among North American tree frogs. The species Hyla eximia and Hyla regilla are so similar in external morphology that the ""wrightorum"" subspecies is assigned by some authorities to H. eximia and by others to H. regilla. Yet microcomplement fixation experiments show that ""wrightorum"" albumin, though virtually indistinguishable from authentic H. eximia albumin, differs as much from H. regilla albumin as from albumins of species outside the genus Hyla, such as Acris crepitans. The morphological resemblance of ""wrightorum"" to H. regilla is thus probably due to convergence."
https://openalex.org/W1992139176,"When N,N'-didansyl cystine binds to the cell membranes of vertebrate rods and cones its fluorescence efficiency increases about 20-fold. The entire outer segments of living cones become brilliantly fluorescent. Stained live rods, as well as most freshly detached outer segments, are only weakly fluorescent, but they become brightly fluorescent within a few seconds if their plasma membranes are osmotically ruptured. The difference in staining of rod and cones suggests that disk membranes of rods are not continuous with the plasma membranes are osmotically ruptured. The difference in staining of rod and cones plasma membrane on outer segments of photoreceptors in electrophysiological and biochemical experiments, and to study the infolding pattern of rod and cone disks."
https://openalex.org/W1480740682,"Abstract The 25,000 Mr fragment obtained by thrombin digestion of normal prothrombin has been further compared with the corresponding fragment from dicoumarol-induced prothrombin. In contrast with the fragment from normal prothrombin, the one from dicoumarol-induced prothrombin does not bind calcium (Stenflo, J. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 6325). After cyanogen bromide degradation of this material, a fragment with approximately 75 amino acid residues constituting the NH2-terminal part of prothrombin was isolated by gel filtration. The fragment from normal prothrombin bound calcium, while the fragment from the dicoumarolinduced prothrombin did not. The fragments from the two prothrombins did not contain N-acetylglucosamine and had identical amino acid compositions. From tryptic digests of the completely reduced and S-carboxymethylated fragment from normal prothrombin two peptides were isolated which differed from the corresponding peptides in digests of the abnormal prothrombin. One peptide from normal prothrombin, which contained residues 4 to 10, had an anodal electrophoretic mobility too high to be consistent with the amino acid composition, thereby indicating a prosthetic group with a charge of at least -3. The corresponding peptide from abnormal prothrombin had an electrophoretic mobility consistent with the amino acid composition. The other peptide in normal prothrombin contained residues 12 to approximately 34. It had arginine residues inaccessible to trypsin. In abnormal prothrombin, this peptide was replaced by smaller peptides. Both peptides from normal prothrombin bound calcium. The properties of the two peptides from normal prothrombin, together with the comparison with the corresponding peptides from abnormal prothrombin, provide strong evidence for the presence of prosthetic groups in the peptides from normal prothrombin. Since there is no evidence of prosthetic groups in the peptides from dicoumarol-induced prothrombin these must have been attached to the prothrombin polypeptide chain by the action of vitamin K."

https://openalex.org/W1996402970,"Particles with the morphology of type C virus have been identified from primate placentas by electron microscopy. A reverse transcriptase (RNA-dependent DNA polymerase) was isolated and purified from microsomal pellets of two fresh placentas of rhesus monkeys in the early stages of gestation. This enzyme was biochemically similar yet immunologically distinct from the reverse transcriptases of known tumorigenic type C RNA viruses isolated from primates, but was immunologically related to a reverse transcriptase isolated from a type C virus obtained from normal baboon placenta. These particles may represent endogenous viruses and may function in the transfer of genetic information during embryogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1973188629,A fluorescent staining technique has demonstrated a contralateral arrangement of fluorescent spots in the centromeric region of mouse metacentric chromosomes which have resulted from centric fusion. The results suggest that centric fusion involves the maintenance of DNA polaritv through the centromere and that the thymidine-rich chain of satellite DNA in the centromeric region is associated with the same DNA chain in every mouse autosome.
https://openalex.org/W2065709425,"Specific unresponsiveness can be induced in neonatal and adult BALB/c mice by antibody against antigen-specific receptor (antireceptor antibody). When heterologous antireceptor antibody is used in the indirect fluorescence technique, the number of fluorescent cells in these animals is significantly lower than in normal animals. Fluorescent cells appear after a relatively brief incubation of cells from adult-suppressed animals, whereas no fluorescent cells are detected when cells from neonatally treated animals are incubated briefly. Evidently, treating neonatal mice with antireceptor antibody specifically depletes the antigen-responsive clone. In contrast, antireceptor antibody causes reversible blockade of responsive cells in adult-suppressed animals."

https://openalex.org/W2000170181,Gramicidin A' is believed to form transmembrane channels in lipid bilayers and biological membranes. The first Raman spectroscopic study of gramicidin A' is presented. Evidence is found for two types of conformation. One type is found in the powder and has a Raman spectrum similar to that of model polypeptides with beta hydrogen bonding. The second type is found when gramicidin A' is dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide.

https://openalex.org/W1487327802,"Abstract Kynurenine formamidase activity found in the livers of chicks 2 days after hatching is 6- to 8-fold higher than enzyme levels found just before hatching. In order to study this phenomenon, the enzyme was purified from adult chicken livers. Certain properties of the purified enzyme were studied: (a) formamidase is optimally active between pH 6.0 and 8.5, (b) its Km for formylkynurenine was determined to be 1.4 x 10-4 m, (c) its activity is not inhibited by sulfhydryl reagents but is strongly inhibited by Ag+, Hg2+, Cu2+, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, p-nitrophenyldiethyl phosphoric acid, and 1 m urea, (d) its molecular weight as determined by Sephadex G-100 column chromatography was estimated to be 59,000, and as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to be 30,000. Homogeneous antibody was prepared and the enzymes from crude liver homogenates of 19-day-old embryos, 2-day-old chicks, and adult chickens were compared by equivalence point determinations and by Ouchterlony double diffusion analysis. The formamidase in newly hatched chicks was found to be immunologically identical to the adult enzyme, whereas the enzyme in chick embryos is not immunologically related to the enzyme from newly hatched chick or adult chickens, i.e. it was not inactivated by antibody to the adult enzyme nor was it visibly precipitated by the antibody. Kynurenine formamidase activity in extracts of chick livers could also be distinguished from the activity present in extracts of embryo livers on the basis of precipitation by different concentrations of ammonium sulfate. It is concluded, therefore, that the activity measured in embryo liver extracts is due to an enzyme different from the one present in adult chicken and newly hatched chick liver extracts."

https://openalex.org/W1525724840,"Abstract A1 proteins prepared from myelin of many animal species including human, monkey, bovine, rabbit, guinea pig, horse, sheep, dog, rat, chicken, and turtle were tested in the guinea pig for encephalitogenic activity. The mammalian A1 proteins were equally encephalitogenic producing marked clinical and histologic signs at 10 to 100 µg. The turtle A1 protein was inactive (100- to 1000-fold less active than the mammalian proteins). The chicken A1 protein, which was also much less active, failed to elicit clinical signs of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis but in 6 of 20 animals produced a small number of histologic lesions (perivascular cuffing of mononuclear cells). These results were correlated with the amino acid sequence in the tryptophan region of the A1 molecule, the only significant encephalitogenic site active in the guinea pig. For the mammalian proteins, the essential requirements of Trp-X-X-X-X-Gln-Lys(Arg) were preserved and account, therefore, for the encephalitogenic activity of these proteins. The rat and human proteins contain arginine rather than lysine at position 122 of the A1 sequence, an acceptable substitution. Thus the amino acid sequences of mammalian A1 proteins in the tryptophan region appear virtually identical. The sequence was inferred from analysis of the tryptophan-containing peptides obtained by peptide mapping of both the tryptic and chymotryptic digests. The amino acid sequence of the tryptophan region of the chicken A1 protein was established by Edman degradation using Peptide T obtained by BNPS-skatole (a bromine adduct of 2-(2-nitrophenylsulfenyl)-3-methyl-indole) cleavage of the COOH-tryptophanyl bond: Phe-Ser-Trp-Gly-Gly-Glu-Gly-His-Lys. We concluded that the inactivity of the chicken protein was primarily due to replacement of the critical glutamine residue 121 with histidine. The replacement of alanine residue 118 by glycine is probably inconsequential. The data reveal, therefore, that structure-activity relationship established with synthetic polypeptides for the disease-inducing site correlates well with the activities of A1 proteins from the various animal species. The amino acid sequence of chicken Peptide T (residues 117 to 170) was inferred by comparison of the analyses of the derived tryptic peptides obtained from peptide mapping. Comparison with bovine Peptide T revealed only eight substitutions within this 53-residue segment of the chicken and bovine A1 proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1553659694,"Abstract Secretory component is found either covalently linked to exocrine immunoglobulin A or in a free form unassociated with other protein. Previous work has demonstrated considerable similarities between the two forms in terms of size, composition, and antigenic determinants. The comparison has now been extended to the primary structure of bound and free secretory components obtained from human colostrum. Their tryptic peptide maps are similar; the amino acid sequences of the first 14 residues, as determined by an automated sequenator, are identical; and they show no structural homologies with any other proteins. The data support the concept that secretory component is a unique protein species, a fraction of which forms a complex specifically with immunoglobulin A."
