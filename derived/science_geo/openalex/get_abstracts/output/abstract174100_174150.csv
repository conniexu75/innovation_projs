https://openalex.org/W2145736817,"For over 50 years immunologists have based their thoughts, experiments, and clinical treatments on the idea that the immune system functions by making a distinction between self and nonself. Although this paradigm has often served us well, years of detailed examination have revealed a number of inherent problems. This Viewpoint outlines a model of immunity based on the idea that the immune system is more concerned with entities that do damage than with those that are foreign."

Of all these, thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) have the most complex structure and must operate in the most demanding high-temperature environment of aircraft and industrial gas-turbine engines. TBCs, which comprise metal and ceramic multilayers, insulate turbine and combustor engine components from the hot gas stream, and improve the durability and energy efficiency of these engines. Improvements in TBCs will require a better understanding of the complex changes in their structure and properties that occur under operating conditions that lead to their failure. The structure, properties, and failure mechanisms of TBCs are herein reviewed, together with a discussion of current limitations and future opportunities."

Mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) encodes an MHC-like protein (m157) that binds to an inhibitory NK cell receptor in certain MCMV-susceptible mice. In MCMV-resistant mice, this viral protein engages a related activating receptor (Ly49H) and confers host protection. These activating and inhibitory receptors are highly homologous, suggesting the possibility that one evolved from the other in response to selective pressure imposed by the pathogen."

Additionally, rin plants display enlarged sepals and loss of inflorescence determinacy. Positional cloning of the rin locus revealed two tandem MADS-box genes (LeMADS-RIN and LeMADS-MC), whose expression patterns suggested roles in fruit ripening and sepal development, respectively. The rin mutation alters expression of both genes. Gene repression and mutant complementation demonstrate that LeMADS-RIN regulates ripening, whereas LeMADS-MC affects sepal development and inflorescence determinacy. LeMADS-RIN demonstrates an agriculturally important function of plant MADS-box genes and provides molecular insight into nonhormonal (developmental) regulation of ripening."

To investigate this adaptive process, we generated transgenic mice that selectively express in skeletal muscle a constitutively active form of calcium/calmodulin–dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV*). Skeletal muscles from these mice showed augmented mitochondrial DNA replication and mitochondrial biogenesis, up-regulation of mitochondrial enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism and electron transport, and reduced susceptibility to fatigue during repetitive contractions. CaMK induced expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1 (PGC-1), a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis in vivo, and activated the PGC-1 gene promoter in cultured myocytes. Thus, a calcium-regulated signaling pathway controls mitochondrial biogenesis in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2127903162,"One of the factors postulated to drive the aging process is the accumulation of DNA damage. Here, we provide strong support for this hypothesis by describing studies of mice with a mutation in XPD , a gene encoding a DNA helicase that functions in both repair and transcription and that is mutated in the human disorder trichothiodystrophy (TTD). TTD mice were found to exhibit many symptoms of premature aging, including osteoporosis and kyphosis, osteosclerosis, early greying, cachexia, infertility, and reduced life-span. TTD mice carrying an additional mutation in XPA , which enhances the DNA repair defect, showed a greatly accelerated aging phenotype, which correlated with an increased cellular sensitivity to oxidative DNA damage. We hypothesize that aging in TTD mice is caused by unrepaired DNA damage that compromises transcription, leading to functional inactivation of critical genes and enhanced apoptosis."

We reveal the genetic signatures of its origins, secondary movements, and differentiation through the study of 15 microsatellite loci in 50 indigenous cattle breeds spanning the present cattle distribution in Africa. The earliest cattle originated within the African continent, but Near East and European genetic influences are also identified. The initial expansion of African Bos taurus was likely from a single region of origin. It reached the southern part of the continent by following an eastern route rather than a western one. The B. indicus genetic influence shows a major entry point through the Horn and the East Coast of Africa and two modes of introgression into the continent."

https://openalex.org/W2040068538,"MDMX, an MDM2-related protein, has emerged as yet another essential negative regulator of p53 tumor suppressor, since loss of MDMX expression results in p53-dependent embryonic lethality in mice. However, it remains unknown why neither homologue can compensate for the loss of the other. In addition, results of biochemical studies have suggested that MDMX inhibits MDM2-mediated p53 degradation, thus contradicting its role as defined in gene knockout experiments. Using cells deficient in either MDM2 or MDMX, we demonstrated that these two p53 inhibitors are in fact functionally dependent on each other. In the absence of MDMX, MDM2 is largely ineffective in down-regulating p53 because of its extremely short half-life. MDMX renders MDM2 protein sufficiently stable to function at its full potential for p53 degradation. On the other hand, MDMX, which is a cytoplasmic protein, depends on MDM2 to redistribute into the nucleus and be able to inactivate p53. We also showed that MDMX, when exceedingly overexpressed, inhibits MDM2-mediated p53 degradation by competing with MDM2 for p53 binding. Our findings therefore provide a molecular basis for the nonoverlapping activities of these two p53 inhibitors previously revealed in genetic studies.

We also showed that MDMX, when exceedingly overexpressed, inhibits MDM2-mediated p53 degradation by competing with MDM2 for p53 binding. Our findings therefore provide a molecular basis for the nonoverlapping activities of these two p53 inhibitors previously revealed in genetic studies. The tumor suppressor gene p53 encodes a transcription factor that is activated in response to various forms of stress, leading to the induction of a number of genes whose products mediate either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (1Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6760) Google Scholar). Under most physiological conditions, p53 activity is tightly controlled, primarily through the ability of MDM2 to target p53 for degradation, which ensures cell survival. Current model of p53 activation suggests that diverse stress signals converge on a single regulatory node, namely the p53-MDM2 module, and interfere with the ability of MDM2 to target p53 for degradation (2Prives C. Cell. 1998; 95: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Analogous to MDM2, MDMX ablation is also associated with p53-dependent embryonic death in mice, placing MDMX in the category of essential p53 negative regulators (3Parant J. Chavez-Reyes A. Little N.A. Yan W. Reinke V. Jochemsen A.G. Lozano G. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). In contrast to MDM2, however, MDMX lacks ubiquitin E3 ligase activity and is unable to target p53 for ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent proteolysis (4Stad R. Little N.A. Xirodimas D.P. Frenk R. van der Eb A.J. Lane D.P. Saville M.K. Jochemsen A.G. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Moreover, MDMX was reported to inhibit MDM2-mediated p53 degradation (4Stad R. Little N.A. Xirodimas D.P. Frenk R. van der Eb A.J. Lane D.P. Saville M.K. Jochemsen A.G.

To resolve these conflicting results and gain better understanding of why neither gene product can compensate for the loss of the other, we generated MDMX-deficient cells using small interference RNA (siRNA) 1The abbreviations used are: siRNAsmall interference RNARTreverse transcriptasePBSphosphate-buffered salineDAPI4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindoleIPimmunoprecipitationGFPgreen fluorescent proteinNLSnuclear localization sequenceMEFmouse embryonic fibroblast and carried out biochemical analysis of MDM2 in these cells.

Lozano, University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center),p53−/− MEFs and p53−/−/MDM2−/− MEFs (Dr. Carl Maki, Harvard School of Public Health), were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. MDMX siRNA (AAAACUGCCGCUUUUGAAGAU) was generated by Dharmacon Research, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). Cells were transfected by LipofectAMINE method as described (7Gu J. Nie L. Wiederschain D. Yuan Z.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8533-8546Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was measured 24 h post-transfection using Lumat 9507 luminometer (EG&G Berthold) as described previously (7Gu J. Nie L. Wiederschain D. Yuan Z.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8533-8546Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted and purified from cells using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). RT-PCR was performed using Qiagen Onestep RT-PCR kit with the corresponding primers. Cells were transfected in 60-mm plates with 5 μg of DNA and harvested at 24-h post-transfection. Cells were lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors) by incubating on ice for 30 min, and the extracts were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min to remove cell debris. Protein concentrations were determined using Bio-Rad protein assay. After addition of 5× loading buffer, the samples were incubated at 95 °C for 5 min and resolved by SDS-PAGE. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were prepared in 0.5% Triton X-100 lysis buffer and incubated with the indicated antibody for 4 h followed by incubation with protein A/G beads (Oncogene Science, Cambridge, MA) for additional 4 h. Immune complexes and whole lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) and probed with the indicated antibody. Proteins were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cells were grown on Chamber Slides (Nunc, Naperville, IL) and transfected with the indicated vector. Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 24 h after transfection and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, cells were permeabilized with ice-cold 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 30 min, and then incubated with the indicated antibody for 1 h. The slides were incubated with secondary antibody (Texas Red X goat antimouse IgG, Molecular Probe) and DAPI (10 μg/ml, Sigma). Following PBS wash, the slides were mounted with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology Associates) containing 2.5 mg/ml n-propyl gallate (Sigma). Specimens were examined under a fluorescent microscope (Zeiss). Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were isolated as described previously (7Gu J. Nie L. Wiederschain D. Yuan Z.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8533-8546Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Gene knock-out experiments in mice have demonstrated a crucial role for both MDM2 and MDMX in functional inactivation of p53 and, interestingly, neither gene product can substitute for the loss of the other (3Parant J. Chavez-Reyes A. Little N.A. Yan W. Reinke V. Jochemsen A.G. Lozano G. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). To understand these nonoverlapping activities, we abrogated MDMX expression by siRNA (8Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8184) Google Scholar) in U2OS cells and then analyzed MDM2-mediated p53 inactivation. U2OS cells were chosen because they express detectable MDM2 and MDMX and have wild type p53. RT-PCR analysis showed a significantly lower amount of MDMX mRNA in cells that were transfected with siRNA when compared with the control cells (Fig. 1 a). This down-regulation of MDMX expression was confirmed at the protein level by IP-Western analysis using anti-MDMX antibody (Fig. 1 b). Interestingly, down-regulation of MDMX expression was associated with a significant increase of the p53 protein levels (Fig. 1 c). Unchanged levels of other cellular proteins, such as replication protein A or Cdc2, demonstrated that this effect on p53 was specific (Fig. 1 c). In light of the fact that MDMX lacks the ability to degrade p53 (4Stad R. Little N.A. Xirodimas D.P. Frenk R. van der Eb A.J. Lane D.P. Saville M.K. Jochemsen A.G. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 5Jackson M.W. Berberich S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), we asked whether this increase in p53 abundance resulted from altered MDM2 levels by measuring MDM2 levels in the MDMX siRNA-transfected cells. Significantly, the MDM2 protein levels in U2OS cells deficient in MDMX were indeed considerably lower than those in the control cells (Fig. 1 d, lanes 1 and 2). A similar result was obtained in H1299 cells (Fig. 1 d, lanes 3 and 4). To confirm this observation further, we used mouse embryonic fibroblast cells derived form MDMX and p53 double knock-out mice (p53−/−/MDMX−/− MEFs). While MDM2 expression was associated with a modest decrease of p53 levels in p53−/−/MDMX−/− MEFs (Fig. 1 e, lane 2), the ability of MDM2 to degrade p53 was substantially enhanced when MDMX was introduced back into these cells (Fig. 1 e, lane 5). Notably, the MDM2 levels were significantly elevated in the MEFs with restored MDMX expression (Fig. 1 e, lane 5, panel 2). To determine whether this effect of MDMX was truly mediated through MDM2, we generated the N-terminal deletion mutant of MDMX (MDMXdelN) that lacks the p53-binding domain but is proficient in MDM2 binding. Remarkably, MDMXdelN also induced an up-regulation of MDM2 levels and restored the efficiency of MDM2-mediated p53 degradation to the same extent as wild type MDMX (Fig. 1 e, lane 6). Coupled with the observation that MDMX or MDMXdelN alone was unable to affect p53 levels (Fig. 1 e, lane 3 or 4), it appears that MDMX enhances the efficiency of MDM2-targeted p53 degradation by up-regulating MDM2 levels. To examine whether elevated MDM2 levels in the MDMX-expressing cells could be due to increased stability of MDM2, the half-life of this protein was examined. MDMX indeed significantly stabilized MDM2, which otherwise was an extremely unstable protein (Fig. 1 f, lanes 1–4 versus lanes 5–8). The ability of MDMX to up-regulate MDM2 levels depended on the hetero-complex formation between the two proteins as MDMXdelRF mutant, which is deficient in binding to MDM2 (9Tanimura S. Ohtsuka S. Mitsui K. Shirouzu K. Yoshimura A. Ohtsubo M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), failed to prolong the half-life of MDM2 (Fig. 1 f, lanes 9–12). Our results therefore indicate that MDMX confers additional stability on MDM2 by prolonging its half-life and thereby enhances MDM2's ability to target p53 for degradation. While our findings are consistent with the results derived from genetic studies, they contradict recent reports that show MDMX acting to inhibit MDM2-mediated p53 degradation, even in the presence of up-regulated MDM2 protein levels (4Stad R. Little N.A. Xirodimas D.P. Frenk R. van der Eb A.J. Lane D.P. Saville M.K. Jochemsen A.G. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 5Jackson M.W. Berberich S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 6Sharp D.A. Kratowicz S.A. Sank M.J. George D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38189-38196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). To resolve this issue, we set out to investigate the effect of MDMX in more detail. When coexpressed with p53 in 293T cells, MDM2, but not MDMX, down-regulated p53 levels (Fig. 2 a, lanes 1–3 versus lanes 4–6). MDMX expression was in fact associated with a modest increase of p53 levels (Fig. 2 a, lane 4 versus lane 6), an observation consistent with the published data (3Parant J. Chavez-Reyes A. Little N.A. Yan W. Reinke V. Jochemsen A.G. Lozano G. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 4Stad R. Little N.A. Xirodimas D.P. Frenk R. van der Eb A.J. Lane D.P. Saville M.K. Jochemsen A.G. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). When MDM2 and MDMX were coexpressed along with p53, the MDM2 levels were elevated with increasing amount of MDMX, whereas the steady state levels of the p53 protein varied, depending on the ratio of MDMX/MDM2 plasmids used (Fig. 2 a, lanes 7–11). When the ratio of MDMX/MDM2 was less than 2:1, MDMX significantly enhanced the ability of MDM2 to degrade p53 (Fig. 2 a, lanes 9 and 10). Once the ratio was greater than 2:1, however, MDM2 was found to be completely inactive in p53 degradation, as evidenced by an increase rather than a decrease in p53 levels (Fig. 2 a, lane 11). A similar result was also obtained in U2OS cells (Fig. 2 a, bottom), indicating that this observation is not cell-type specific. To further understand this differential effect on p53 levels, cells expressing p53 along with MDMX and MDM2 were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-p53 antibody. Western analysis of the immunocomplexes with anti-MDMX or anti-MDM2 demonstrated that with the increasing ratio of MDMX over MDM2, MDMX almost completely replaced MDM2 as the protein bound to p53 (Fig. 2 b). Our results therefore demonstrate that MDMX can indeed enhance the ability of MDM2 to target p53 for degradation when the ratio of MDMX to MDM2 is close to 1:1. However, when the level of MDMX is significantly higher than that of MDM2, MDMX impedes on the MDM2-mediated p53 degradation by competing with MDM2 for p53 binding. The inefficiency of MDM2-mediated p53 degradation in the MDMX-null cells can also suggest an impaired ability of MDM2 to functionally inhibit p53. A transcriptional assay utilizing reporter construct containing the luciferase gene driven by the p53-responsive promoter was conducted to compare the inhibitory potential of MDM2 in p53−/−/MDMX−/− and p53−/− MEFs. As depicted in Fig. 2 c, MDM2 was indeed found less efficient in the inhibition of p53-mediated luciferase expression in p53−/−/MDMX−/− cells than that in p53−/− cells, consistent with the compromised MDM2-mediated p53 degradation in the MDMX-deficient cells. Since we found that the activity of MDM2 strongly depends on MDMX, we were interested in knowing how the function of MDMX can be affected by MDM2. First we examined the effect of MDM2 expression on MDMX subcellular distribution. Similar to recently published data (10Migliorini D. Danovi D. Colombo E. Carbone R. Pelicci P.G. Marine J.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7318-7323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), GFP-MDMX proteins, when expressed in U2OS cells, were found mainly localized in the cytoplasm, in sharp contrast with the predominantly nuclear distributed GFP-MDM2 (Fig. 3 a, top versus middle). Treatment of cells with leptomycin B, a nuclear export inhibitor, did not alter nuclear exclusion of MDMX (Fig. 3 a, bottom), indicating the inability of MDMX to be nuclear imported. Similar cytoplasmic localization of MDMX was observed when a non-tagged MDMX expression vector was transfected into U2OS cells or p53−/−/MDM2−/− MEFs (Fig. 3 b). To test whether results obtained from transfection truly reflect the distribution of endogenous MDMX, cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions isolated from p53−/−/MDM2−/− MEFs were subjected to IP-Western analysis with an anti-MDMX antibody. As shown in Fig. 3 c, the MDMX proteins were again detected only in the cytoplasmic, but not in the nuclear fraction, supporting the results obtained in transfection experiments. Since the NLS of MDM2 is not conserved in MDMX, it appears that in contrast to the mainly nuclear distributed MDM2, MDMX is a cytoplasmic protein. Cytoplasmic distribution of MDMX would be expected to translate into this protein's inability to functionally inactivate p53. Once again, luciferase-based functional assay was performed in p53−/−/MDM2−/− MEFs to test this possibility. Under the same conditions that allowed MDM2 to efficiently abrogate p53 transcriptional activity, MDMX exhibited very little effect (Fig. 3 d). Measurement of the protein levels demonstrated that inability of MDMX to efficiently block p53 transcriptional activity was not a consequence of lower levels of p53 protein expressed (Fig. 3 e, lane 4). Although failure of MDMX to inhibit p53 transcriptional activity is consistent with its cytoplasmic localization, this result seems to contradict the essential role of MDMX in functional inactivation of p53, as revealed in genetic studies. Since MDM2 and MDMX form a hetero-complex, we asked whether MDM2 could contribute to the inhibitory function of MDMX. We first examined whether MDM2/MDMX complex formation affects subcellular distribution of MDMX by cotransfecting vector encoding GFP-MDMX with a control or MDM2-expressing plasmid. Interestingly, examination of the green fluorescent proteins revealed that coexpression of MDM2 was associated with an induction of nuclear redistribution of the MDMX protein (Fig. 3 f, top panel 1 versus top panel 2). As predicted by the results of in vitro binding experiments, MDM2 colocalized with MDMX in the cells (Fig. 3 f, panel 2), indicative of complex formation between the two proteins. It has been shown that the Zn2+ finger and RING domains of MDM2 are responsible for binding of MDM2 to MDMX (9Tanimura S. Ohtsuka S. Mitsui K. Shirouzu K. Yoshimura A. Ohtsubo M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Corresponding mutants of MDM2 were then generated to test whether the MDM2/MDMX complex formation was necessary for nuclear redistribution of MDMX. Results of these experiments indeed support the requirement of hetero-complex formation for MDMX nuclear localization. As shown in Fig. 3 f, top panels 3 and 4, coexpression of MDM2 mutants which cannot bind to MDMX failed to induce nuclear relocalization of MDMX, even though MDM2 mutant proteins remained predominantly nuclear localized (Fig. 3 f, middle panels 3 and 4). In contrast, the p53-binding mutant of MDM2, MDM2/G58A, retained the ability to induce MDMX nuclear distribution (Fig. 3 f, top panel 7). Additionally, the MDMX deletion mutant lacking its RING domain, which is required for binding to MDM2, was found no longer redistributing into the nucleus along with MDM2 (Fig. 3 f, top panel 5). Since MDMX does not have its own NLS, the NLS of MDM2 would likely be contributing to nuclear distribution of the MDM2/MDMX complexes. MDM2 NLS deletion mutant was then prepared to test this possibility. As expected, removal of the NLS resulted in an exclusively cytoplasmic distribution of the MDM2 mutant proteins (Fig. 3 f, middle panel 6). Interestingly, when coexpressed with MDMX, both proteins were found to colocalize in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3 f, top panel 6). Taken together, our data show that nuclear redistribution of MDMX requires both the MDM2/MDMX hetero-complex formation and the NLS of MDM2. We next asked whether coexpression of MDM2 would render MDMX capable of inactivating p53. The MDM2 mutant that was defective in binding to p53 but competent in directing MDMX into the nucleus was used to test this possibility in a functional assay. As shown in Fig. 3 g, while this MDM2 mutant (column 4) and MDMX (column 7) were inactive when transfected alone, coexpression of the two proteins was associated with a significant inhibition of p53-induced luciferase activity (Fig. 3 g, column 9). In contrast, coexpression of MDM2/G58AdelNLS (Fig. 3 g, column 10) or MDM2/G58AdelRF (Fig. 3 g, column 11) with MDMX did not have any effect, consistent with the requirement of the MDM2/MDMX hetero-complex formation and the NLS of MDM2 for MDMX's nuclear redistribution and its ability to functionally inhibit p53. Lack of MDMXdelNT's (Fig. 3 g, column 12) inhibitory effect toward p53-driven transcription indicated that the observed functional p53 inhibition was mediated through the interaction between MDMX and p53. Together, our results clearly demonstrate that MDM2-depedent nuclear relocalization of MDMX is essential for its functional inhibition of p53. We demonstrate here that in the absence of MDM2, MDMX is a cytoplasmic protein that is incompetent in its functional inactivation of p53. Formation of MDM2/MDMX hetero-complex, however, induces nuclear redistribution of MDMX and renders MDMX fully capable of inhibiting p53, indicating that the presence of MDM2 is required for the MDMX-mediated p53 inactivation. MDM2, on the other hand, is inefficient in its functional inhibition of p53 in the absence of MDMX, largely due to its rapid self-ubiquitination and degradation. MDMX stabilizes the MDM2 protein and thus ensures that MDM2 can function at its full capacity. MDMX does so by binding to MDM2 to form hetero-complexes that impede on MDM2 self-ubiquitination without affecting its ability to target p53 for degradation. The substantially prolonged half-life of MDM2 and its enhanced efficiency in p53 degradation in the presence of MDMX support this notion. Moreover, the finding that binding affinity between MDMX and MDM2 is greater than that between their respective homo-complexes (8Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8184) Google Scholar) implies important biological role of MDMX in the regulation of MDM2-targeted p53 degradation. In conclusion, our results provide multiple lines of evidence to highlight the mutual dependence of the two homologues in their functional inactivation of p53 and explain the nonoverlapping activities elicited by MDMX and MDM2 in the cell. In our view, MDMX occupies a unique and very critical position in the regulation of p53-MDM2 module that acts as a major integrator of signals induced by genotoxic and oncogenic stress. We are grateful to Dr. Carl Maki, Harvard School of Public Health, for p53−/− and p53−/−/MDM2−/− MEFs."
https://openalex.org/W2028846971,"Bet v 1 is a 17-kDa protein abundantly present in the pollen of the White birch tree and is the primary cause of birch pollen allergy in humans. Its three-dimensional structure is remarkable in that a solvent-accessible cavity traverses the core of the molecule. The biological function of Bet v 1 is unknown, although it is homologous to a family of pathogenesis-related proteins in plants. In this study we first show that Bet v 1 in the native state is able to bind the fluorescent probe 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS). ANS binds to Bet v 1 with 1:1 stoichiometry, and NMR data indicate that binding takes place in the cavity. Using an ANS displacement assay, we then identify a range of physiologically relevant ligands, including fatty acids, flavonoids, and cytokinins, which generally bind with low micromolar affinity. The ability of these ligands to displace ANS suggests that they also bind in the cavity, although the exact binding sites seem to vary among different ligands. The cytokinins, for example, seem to bind at a separate site close to ANS, because they increase the fluorescence of the ANS·Bet v 1 complex. Also, the fluorescent sterol dehydroergosterol binds to Bet v 1 as demonstrated by direct titrations. This study provides the first qualitative and quantitative data on the ligand binding properties of this important pollen allergen.

It shows a considerable degree of heterogeneity when analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting using rabbit antiserum raised against purified Bet v 1, because pollen from a single birch tree exhibits between 5 and 10 spots, whereas a pollen extract reveals 24 spots (1Larsen J.N. ACI News. 1995; 7 (, 160): 141-146Google Scholar). Approximately 50 isoforms have been cloned and sequenced, displaying a primary amino acid sequence identity in the range of 99–72%. Both the solution and crystal structure of Bet v 1 have been determined (2Gajhede M. Osmark P. Poulsen F.M. Ipsen H. Larsen J.N. van Neerven R.J.J. Schou C. Løwenstein H. Spangfort M.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 1040-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The main feature of the structure is a seven-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet that wraps around a 25-residue-long C-terminal α-helix. The β-sheet and the C-terminal part of the long helix are separated by two small consecutive helices. A most unusual feature of the structure is a large forked solvent-accessible cavity penetrating the core of the molecule (2Gajhede M. Osmark P. Poulsen F.M. Ipsen H. Larsen J.N. van Neerven R.J.J. Schou C. Løwenstein H. Spangfort M.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 1040-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Moreover, the structure of Bet v 1 contains a P-loop motif, a structural element found in nucleotide binding proteins, where it is responsible for binding nucleotides (3Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar). Bet v 1 is a major cause of tree pollen allergy in humans (4Ipsen H. Løwenstein H.

FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2045-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Despite the immunological interest in Bet v 1, little is known about its biological function. It is homologous to a group of pathogenesis-related proteins, the PR-10 proteins, that are expressed during disease and in stress situations (6van Loon L.C. van Strien E.A. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 1999; 55: 85-97Crossref Scopus (1504) Google Scholar) and that seem to be ubiquitous in plants (7Breiteneder H. Ebner C. J. Allergy Clin.

Bet v 1 homologues present in various fruits and vegetables, particularly apple (11Vanek-Krebitz M. Hoffmann-Sommergruber K. Laimer da Camara Machado M. Susani M. Ebner C. Kraft D. Scheiner O.

Pastorello E. Bigi A. Ansaloni R. Ann. Allergy. 1988; 61: 47-52PubMed Google Scholar). The identity percentages to these homologues are in the range of 65–56%. Several more distantly related PR-10 proteins from a variety of plant species have been described. These proteins are not serologically cross-reactive, and homology percentages range between 54 and 33%. In addition, homology between the PR-10 proteins and a group of proteins termed the major latex proteins (15Osmark P. Boyle B. Brisson N. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 1243-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), including members from opium poppy (16Nessler C.L. Vonder Haar R.A. Planta. 1990; 180: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and bell pepper (17Pozueta-Romero J. Klein M. Houlne G. Schantz M.L. Meyer B. Schantz R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 28: 1011-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), has been described. Finally, Bet v 1 shows remarkable structural similarity to the 200-amino acid START domain of MLN64 (18Tsujishita Y. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), a protein involved in the mobilization of cholesterol in human placenta and brain (19Watari H. Arakane F. Moog-Lutz C. Kallen C.B. Tomasetto C. Gerton G.L. Rio M.-C. Baker M.E. Strauss III, J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8462-8467Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), although there is no sequence homology. Little experimental data exist on the functional properties of the numerous Bet v 1 homologues, yet some activities have been reported. The START domain of MLN64 is capable of binding one molecule of cholesterol (18Tsujishita Y. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The PR-10 member from mung bean is a cytokinin-specific binding protein capable of binding cytokinins and cytokinin analogues with nanomolar affinity (20Fujimoto Y. Nagata R. Fukasawa H. Yano K. Azuma M. Iida A. Sugimoto S. Shudo K. Hashimoto Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 794-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Very recently, the major allergen from cherry, Pru av 1, whose backbone folding pattern is very similar to that of Bet v 1, was reported to bind the phytosteroid homocastasterone (21Neudecker P.

Furthermore, PR-10 members from ginseng (22Moiseyev G.P. Fedoreyeva L.I. Zhuravlev Y.N. Yasnetskaya E. Jekel P.A. Beintema J.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and white lupin (23Bantignies B. Séguin J. Muzac I. Dédaldéchamp F. Gulick P. Ibrahim R. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 42: 871-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) as well as Bet v 1 (24Bufe A. Spangfort M.D. Kahlert H. Schlaak M. Becker W.-M. Planta. 1996; 199: 413-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 25Swoboda I. Hoffmann-Sommergruber K. O'Riordain G. Scheiner O. Heberle-Bors E. Vicente O. Physiol. Plant. 1996; 96: 433-438Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar) have been reported to show RNase activity. It thus appears that PR-10 proteins display enzymatic activity as well as ligand binding activity, which is also reflected in the classification of the START domain superfamily, including both START domain proteins and PR-10 proteins among others (26Iyer L.M. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. Proteins. 2001; 43: 134-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). We show here that Bet v 1 is able to bind a wide range of both synthetic and naturally occurring compounds with moderate to high affinity and discuss the implications of the identified ligands for a possible biological function of Bet v 1. Lauric acid, stearic acid, and oleic acid were from Fluka (Busch, Germany); deuterium oxide, deuterated HCl, deuterated ethanol, and deuterated phosphate buffer were from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA). All other chemicals were from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). All chemicals were of analytical or biological grade. Bet v 1.2801 was produced and purified as described previously (27Spangfort M.D. Ipsen H. Sparholt S.H. Aasmul-Olsen S. Larsen M.R. Mørtz E. Roepstorff P. Larsen J.N. Protein Expr. Purif. 1996; 8: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using a molar extinction coefficient of 9735m−1 cm−1 at 280 nm as determined by the method of Gill and von Hippel (28Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). Non-linear least squares regression analysis was carried out with the program Kaleidagraph, version 3.5 (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Unless stated otherwise, the error mentioned throughout the text is the standard error of the mean. Where necessary, we corrected for inner filter effects using the equation (29Kirk W.R. Kurian E. Prendergast F.G. Biophys. J. 1996; 79: 69-83Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (102) Google Scholar),κ=ln(10)·α·δ10−α·d2−δ2−10−α·d2+δ2Equation 1 where κ is the inner filter effect correction factor, α is the product of the molar extinction coefficient and the concentration, δ is the emission slit width, and d is the cuvette path length. Cuvettes with low path lengths (3 mm) were used to reduce inner filter effects. All fluorescence experiments were performed on an RTC2000 spectrometer from Photon Technology International (Lawrenceville, NJ) equipped with a 75-watt xenon arc lamp and a temperature control unit. Excitation and emission band paths were 5 nm. ANS was dissolved in 1 ml Me2SO and diluted to 100 ml with MilliQ water. The concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using a molar extinction coefficient of 4990 m−1cm−1 at 350 nm in water (29Kirk W.R. Kurian E. Prendergast F.G. Biophys. J. 1996; 79: 69-83Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Excitation was performed at 350 nm corresponding to the maximum absorption wavelength. The dissociation constant (K d ) was determined at 25 °C at pH 7 and pH 4 in 10 and 50 mm buffer, respectively, using an ANS concentration of 12 and 2 μm, respectively. The stoichiometry of binding was determined at pH 7 and pH 4 in 10 and 50 mm buffer, respectively, using ANS concentrations of 192 and 50 μm, respectively. Titrations with increasing Bet v 1 concentration were performed by preparing aliquots for each data point. The contribution of buffer and protein to the measured ANS fluorescence was subtracted. Data were fitted to the equation, Fobs=FPL×−(Kd+LΣ+PΣ)±(Kd+LΣ+PΣ)2−4·LΣ·PΣ−2·LΣEquation 2 where F obs is the observed fluorescence,F PL is the fluorescence of the protein·ligand complex at saturation, K d is the dissociation constant, L ∑ is the total ligand concentration, and P ∑ is the total protein concentration. F PL and K d are fitted as free parameters by non-linear least squares regression analysis. Equation 2 is derived from a simple ligand binding model assuming that the observed fluorescence is due solely to bound ANS. This is a reasonable assumption, because the fluorescence emission intensity of ANS increases around 50-fold upon binding to Bet v 1 (see “Results”). The stoichiometry of binding was determined in a plot of ANS fluorescence as a function of [Bet v 1]/[ANS]. The value of the independent parameter corresponding to the break point of the curve indicates the number of protein molecules bound per ANS molecule. Due to the high ANS concentration used in these experiments the observed ANS fluorescence is corrected by a constant value calculated from Equation 1. At 20 and 200 μm, respectively, ANS was incubated with 2.5 μm Bet v 1 in 50 mm buffer, and the fluorescence of ANS and of Bet v 1 was recorded for each sample at 25 °C. Far-UV CD spectra of 10 μm Bet v 1 as a function of pH were recorded on a JASCO J-715 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Spectroscopic Co. Ltd., Hachioji City, Japan). The buffers used were as follows: pH 1, 0.1 m HCl; pH 2–3.5, glycine; pH 3.7–4.7, sodium acetate; pH 6, MES; pH 7, MOPS; pH 8–9, Tris; pH 10–11, glycine; pH 13, 0.1 m NaOH. The contributions of buffer and protein to the measured ANS fluorescence and of buffer to the measured ellipticity were subtracted. The use of “Good” buffers (29Kirk W.R. Kurian E. Prendergast F.G. Biophys. J. 1996; 79: 69-83Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (102) Google Scholar) had no effect on ANS binding to Bet v 1 (data not shown). NMR experiments were recorded on a Bruker DRX600 spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm xyz-grad TXI(H/C/N) probe. Initially, a NOESY spectrum of 1.45 mm Bet v 1 in 95%/5% (v/v)1H2O/2H2O in phosphate-buffered saline was recorded. ANS was then added to a final concentration of 1.4 mm, and a new NOESY spectrum was recorded. Additionally, a sample in pure 2H2O was employed. To facilitate exchange, Bet v 1 was unfolded by lowering the pH to 2.1, where unfolding is most extensive (data not shown), with deuterated HCl. After 20 h, pH was brought back to 7, and2H2O was exchanged with 10 mmdeuterated phosphate buffer, pH 7, by use of a Millipore (Bedford, MA) Centricon YM-10 centrifugation cell. The final Bet v 1 concentration was 850 μm. After acquisition of a NOESY spectrum, ANS dissolved in deuterated ethanol was added to a final concentration of 790 μm and a new NOESY spectrum was recorded. All NMR experiments were performed at 298 K. The free induction decays in the direct dimension were collected with 4096 points at 1.61 Hz/point resolution and in the indirect dimension with 1024 points at 6.45 Hz/point resolution. The maximum t 1 value was 77.4 ms, and the maximum t 2 was 309.7 ms. A Gaussian window function was used in both dimensions. Quadrature detection in the indirect dimension was achieved by the States-TPPI (time-proportional phase increment) protocol (30Marion D. Ikura M. Tschudin R. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 85: 393-399Google Scholar). The WATERGATE sequence was applied for water suppression (31Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenár V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3539) Google Scholar). The NMR data were processed with the Bruker XWinNMR version 2.5 software, and spectral analysis was performed with XEASY version 1.3.13 (32Bartels C. Xia T. Billeter M. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar). The assignments of Bet v 1 were obtained from the BioMagResBank, entry number 4417 (33Schweimer K. Sticht H. Nerkamp J. Boehm M. Breitenbach M. Vieths S. Rösch P. Appl. Magn. Reson. 1999; 17: 449-464Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar); some aromatic side-chain assignments were obtained from Osmark (34Osmark P. Structure and Function of Bet v 1, the Major Allergen from Birch Pollen, and Its Homologues.Ph.D. thesis. University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen1996Google Scholar). Peaks shifting in position upon addition of ANS were identified by comparing the NOESY spectra and assigned using the BBReader program (35Wimmer R. Müller N. Petersen S.B. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 9: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Typically, 10 μm Bet v 1 and 10 μm ANS in 50 mm phosphate, pH 7, at 25 °C was used in the ligand titration experiments. The concentrations of the Bet v 1 and ANS stock solutions were determined spectrophotometrically. ANS was excited at 350 nm. The contribution of buffer, Bet v 1, and ligand to the measured fluorescence was subtracted. Ligands with limited solubility in water were dissolved in absolute ethanol. The final ethanol concentration did not exceed 10% (v/v) ensuring that the decreased polarity of the solvent did not change the quantum yield of ANS (36Stryer L. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 13: 482-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). Far-UV CD spectra showed that, below 30% (v/v), the presence of ethanol in the samples had no denaturing effect on Bet v 1 (data not shown). bis-ANS was dissolved in 40 μl of Me2SO and diluted to 1 ml with MilliQ water. The concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using a molar extinction coefficient of 16,790 m−1cm−1 at 385 nm in water (37Wassenberg J.J. Reed R.C. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22806-22814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Excitation was performed at 383 nm corresponding to the maximum absorption wavelength. A simple rectangular hyperbolic binding model was employed to express the affinity of the ligand, Fobs=ΔF×1−IC50IC50+[L]+FbaselineEquation 3 where F obs is the observed fluorescence, ΔF is the fluorescence change,F baseline is the fluorescence at saturation, andL denotes ligand. This model yields the parameter IC50, which is a crude measure of the K d for the displacing ligand (38Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12330) Google Scholar). IC50, ΔF, andF baseline are fitted as free parameters by non-linear least squares regression analysis. In a few instances direct titrations were also performed by monitoring the intrinsic fluorescence of the protein with excitation at 278 nm. Dehydroergosterol (DHE) was dissolved in absolute ethanol. The concentration of DHE was determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient of 10.550m−1 cm−1 at 325 nm (39Smutzer G. Crawford B.F. Yeagle P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 862: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). 10 μm DHE was titrated with Bet v 1, and excitation was performed at 325 nm. The contribution of buffer to the measured DHE fluorescence was subtracted. The affinity of DHE for Bet v 1 was determined in the same manner as for ANS displacing ligands by use of Equation 3. The fluorescent probe ANS is traditionally used to detect molten globules, i.e. partly folded proteins that accumulate under mildly denaturing conditions. ANS is believed to bind to molten globules due to the presence of solvent-exposed hydrophobic patches, which are a particular characteristic of this protein state (40Engelhard M. Evans P.A. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1553-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Certain proteins also bind ANS in the native state, however, provided this conformation displays exposed hydrophobic sites (41Schönbrunn E. Eschenburg S. Luger K. Kabsch W. Armhein N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6345-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 42Ory J.J. Banaszak L.J. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 1107-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 43Slavik J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 694: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Because Bet v 1 contains a hydrophobic solvent-exposed cavity, we tested whether Bet v 1 in the native conformation is able to bind ANS specifically. Fluorescence emission spectra of ANS in the presence and absence of Bet v 1 are shown in Fig. 1. In water, ANS is essentially non-fluorescent and exhibits a maximum emission wavelength (λmax) of ∼515 nm. In the presence of Bet v 1 under native conditions (pH 7), ANS fluorescence displays a pronounced increase in intensity with a concomitant shift of λmax to 474 nm, both of which indicate transfer of ANS to a less polar environment. These data show that Bet v 1 binds ANS in the native state. The affinity of the interaction at pH 7 as well as pH 4 was examined by titration of ANS with Bet v 1 while following the ANS emission at 477 nm. The resulting binding curves, displayed in Fig.2, show that ANS binds to Bet v 1 in a saturable manner. Fitting the raw data to Equation 2 yieldsK d values of 18.5 ± 5.0 μm and 3.8 ± 0.3 μm at pH 7 and pH 4, respectively. Thus, binding is characterized by moderate affinity and is more favorable at low pH than at neutral pH, which is expected because ANS is negatively charged in the entire pH scale (29Kirk W.R. Kurian E. Prendergast F.G. Biophys. J. 1996; 79: 69-83Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (102) Google Scholar). A pH profile of 20 μm ANS mixed with 2.5 μm Bet v 1 (Fig.3) corroborates the result of the titration experiments as ANS fluorescence peaks at pH 3.6 while still being significant at pH 7. Higher ANS concentrations were found to stabilize Bet v 1 by shifting the acid pH denaturation to lower values (data not shown). Thermal scans monitored by far-UV CD spectroscopy confirmed the stabilizing effect of ANS as T m is raised from 45.3 ± 1.0 °C to 55.2 ± 0.5 °C when melting 10 μm Bet v 1 mixed with 100 μm ANS at pH 4 (data not shown). Fig. 3 also shows the unfolding profile of Bet v 1 as monitored by the intrinsic tyrosine fluorescence and far-UV CD spectroscopy. The two unfolding curves show that secondary and tertiary structure unfolds in parallel, which further supports the finding that ANS indeed binds to the native state of Bet v 1 and not to a partially unfolded state. Fig. 4 shows the titration of ANS with Bet v 1 at pH 7 under stoichiometric conditions. This experiment yields a binding stoichiometry of 0.9 ± 0.1, indicating that Bet v 1 possesses a specific binding site for ANS. The same experiment at pH 4 gives a stoichiometry of 1.1 ± 0.2 (data not shown). This finding supports the conclusion that higher affinity rather than an increase in the number of binding sites causes the increased ANS fluorescence at pH 4 compared with pH 7.Figure 3pH profile of ANS in complex with Bet v 1. Fluorescence of 20 μm ANS (●) as a function of pH in 50 mm buffer in the presence of 2.5 μmBet v 1 at 25 °C. ANS was excited at 350 nm; the emission at 477 nm is displayed. The contribution of ANS in buffer is subtracted. ANS fluorescence shows no intrinsic pH dependence (data not shown).

Although the overall appearance of the Bet v 1 NOESY spectrum did not change after addition of ANS, numerous protons with a change in chemical shift of more than 0.02 ppm could be identified. These are summarized in TableI, whereas in Fig.5 they are plotted on a molecular model of Bet v 1. One NOE could be found from a presumed ANS atom (8.33 ppm) to a protein atom at 0.75 ppm, presumably a methyl signal, but no assignment could be obtained. From a 2QF-COSY spectrum recorded in D2O, only three additional resonances were detected after addition of ANS (at 8.33, 7.32, and 7.82 ppm, where the proton at 7.32 ppm exhibits a cross peak to the two other protons). Looking at the distribution of the perturbed protein protons, they can be seen to form one large patch along the β-sheet and several distinct regions in the α-helices (see Fig. 5). Very few perturbed protons can be detected on the outer surface of the protein. Although these data do not unequivocally pinpoint an ANS binding site, they do suggest that ANS binds in the cavity of Bet v 1. This is further corroborated by the two NOEs vanishing between Tyr-83 Hε and Ile-102 Hγ1and Hγ13, respectively. Fig. 5 shows the position of the side chains of these residues in the cavity. The broad swathe of perturbed atoms indicates either that there is no specific binding site for ANS within the cavity or that ANS binding causes some minor structural rearrangements in the protein molecule.Table IBet v 1 protons affected by ANS bindingAtomResidueΔδAtomResidueΔδ [ppm] [ppm]HN30.03HG185−0.08HN50.03HN850.02HA80.04HG286−0.02HN90.05HG2980.05HB90.06HA98−0.03HN15−0.08HG2980.05HN22−0.02HN990.05HA220.03HA1000.03HB2250.03HA101−0.03HN260.09HA1050.06HN270.06HN1130.04HD21280.06QQD1140.05HN290.04HB116−0.05QD30−0.03HB3117−0.02QE30−0.05HN117−0.04HZ300.09HA117−0.03HB2300.03HB2118−0.02HN32−0.04HD22118−0.12HN330.04HA1180.07HN510.03HN118−0.03HA351−0.03HN119−0.06HN70−0.07HN128−0.04HB2/370−0.04HN1310.03HN71−0.06HN1320.03HG171−0.02HE211320.03HN72−0.02HN133−0.03HN74−0.03HG21330.02HA79−0.09HE22133−0.05QD790.03HN134−0.04HA82−0.03HB147−0.04HN83−0.04HN149−0.02Changes in chemical shift of Bet v 1 protons upon addition of ANS (Δδ = δBet v 1·ANS − δBet v 1).

Thiol protease inhibitors (leupeptin and<i>N</i>-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (ALLN)) increased ABCA1 and slowed its decay in the cells, whereas none of the proteosome-specific inhibitor lactacystin, other protease inhibitors, or the lysosomal inhibitor NH<sub>4</sub>Cl showed such effects. The effects of apoA-I and ALLN were additive for the increase of ABCA1, and the apoA-I-mediated cellular lipid release was enhanced by ALLN.

The MoFe protein folds as a heterotetramer containing two copies each of the homologous alpha and beta subunits. In this structure, one of the three alpha subunit domains exhibits a substantially changed conformation, whereas the rest of the protein remains essentially unchanged.

Arosio P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 161-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2278) Google Scholar). In mammals, nearly all of the ferritin is found in cytoplasm, where its expression is controlled translationally by iron through an iron regulatory element in the mRNA (2Cairo G. Pietrangelo A.

This ferritin is composed of two subunit types, H and L, with ∼50% sequence identity and very similar three-dimensional structures made of a bundle of four α-helices. H-ferritin shells have ferroxidase activity that results in the conversion of soluble ferrous ions into inert aggregates of ferric hydroxides (4Levi S. Santambrogio P. Cozzi A. Rovida E. Corsi B.

This ferroxidase activity is associated with di-iron binding sites coordinated by seven residues that are conserved in ferritins from animals, plants, and bacteria (1Harrison P.M. Arosio P. Biochim.

These sites catalyze Fe(II) oxidation, a rate-limiting step in iron incorporation, in a reaction that consumes one dioxygen molecule per two Fe(II) ions and produces hydrogen peroxide (1Harrison P.M.

The L-subunit lacks the ferroxidase center, and L-homopolymers do not incorporate iron in vivo. However, the L-subunit provides efficient sites for iron nucleation and mineralization and somehow increases turnover at the H-ferroxidase centers (4Levi S. Santambrogio P. Cozzi A. Rovida E.

Large increases in L-ferritin levels occur as a result of mutations in the iron regulatory element. These increases cause cataracts but no apparent abnormalities in body iron metabolism (14Beaumont C. Leneuve P. Devaux I. Scoazec J.Y. Berthier M. Loiseau M.N. Grandchamp B. Bonneau D. Nat.

However, a mutation in the C-terminal sequence of the L-chain causes a neurological disorder with increased deposition of ferritin and iron in the basal ganglia of the brain (16Curtis A.R. Fey C. Morris C.M. Bindoff L.A. Ince P.G. Chinnery P.F. Coulthard A. Jackson M.J. Jackson A.P. McHale D.P. Hay D. Barker W.A. Markham A.F. Bates D. Curtis A. Burn J. Nat.

We have recently identified a new human ferritin, MtF,1 that is encoded by an intronless gene on chromosome 5q23.1 and a mouse ortholog (17Levi S. Corsi B. Bosisio M. Invernizzi R. Volz A. Sanford D. Arosio P. Drysdale J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24437-24440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Human MtF is synthesized as a 242-amino acid precursor with a long N-terminal sequence for mitochondrial import (17Levi S. Corsi B. Bosisio M. Invernizzi R. Volz A. Sanford D. Arosio P. Drysdale J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24437-24440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Experiments with transfectant cells showed that this precursor is efficiently targeted to mitochondria and processed into typical ferritin shells. The amino acid sequence of the predicted mature protein overlaps the H sequence with 77% identity and contains all the residues of the ferroxidase center. The mature protein produced in Escherichia coli incorporated iron in vitro, indicating that it has ferroxidase activity (17Levi S. Corsi B. Bosisio M. Invernizzi R. Volz A. Sanford D. Arosio P. Drysdale J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24437-24440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). As judged from mRNA levels, MtF is expressed at low levels in most cells except testis. MtF is present at a low level in normal erythroblasts, but this level increases dramatically in iron-loaded erythroblasts from patients with sideroblastic anemia (17Levi S. Corsi B. Bosisio M.

This increased expression does not appear to be due to the typical translational control since MtF mRNA lacks the classical stem-loop iron regulatory element. The function and regulation of this new ferritin have not been established. Mitochondria are exposed to a heavy traffic in iron for the synthesis of heme and Fe/S clusters. Mitochondria are also the major sites of reactive oxygen species production (18Lange H. Kispal G. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 279: 18989-18996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 19Ferreira G.C. Int J. Biochem.

Chem. 1993; 268: 8541-8546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and presumably must have efficient mechanisms to segregate Fe(II) from reactive oxygen species (particularly H2O2) to prevent the production of highly toxic hydroxyl radicals in Fenton-type reactions. Iron homeostasis in mitochondria also differs from that in the cytoplasm. Iron deprivation affects mitochondrial iron enzymes less than cytosolic iron enzymes (21Thompson C.H. Kemp G.J. Taylor D.J. Radda G.K. Rajagopalan B. J Intern. Med. 1993; 234: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). By contrast, excess iron is not usually deposited in mitochondria but is deposited in the cytosol as ferritin. Although iron does not normally accumulate in mitochondria, defects in its transport or utilization in mitochondria can result in mitochondrial iron loading. Visible granular iron deposits are formed inside the mitochondria of erythroblasts with defective heme synthesis as in subjects with sideroblastic anemia (22Bottomley S.S. Lee G.R. Lee G.R.

Iron also accumulates in the mitochondria of patients with Friedreich's ataxia resulting from defects in the synthesis of frataxin (24Babcock M. de Silva D. Oaks R. Davis-Kaplan S. Jirlerspong S. Momtermini L. Pandolfo M. Kaplan J Science. 1997; 276: 1709-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar) or in sideroblastic anemia with ataxia from defects in the Fe/S transporter ABC7 (25Allikmets R. Raskind W.H. Hutchinson A. Schueck N.D. Dean M. Koeller D.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The form of this iron is not known, but the iron overload is associated with a decrease in respiratory chain and aconitase activity, probably from iron-induced oxidative damage (26Lill R. Kispal G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 352-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Very little is yet known about how iron is delivered to mitochondria and whether it is normally accessible to MtF. It is also not known whether MtF responds to changes in cellular iron or whether its level affects the partitioning of cellular iron. This report explores some of these issues through analyses of different forms of MtF and H-ferritins transfected into HeLa cells. We show that MtF readily incorporates iron inside mitochondria by a process similar to that of H-ferritins. Unlike cytoplasmic ferritins, the levels of MtF are not increased by exogenous iron. However, when increased by transfection, MtF retains a high proportion of available iron, and cells show signs of iron deficiency. We conclude that iron is potentially as accessible to MtF as it is to cytosolic ferritin and that the control of MtF levels may offer a powerful method for regulating cellular iron homeostasis.

Clones expressing MtF and MtF222 were selected and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin, Sigma), 150 μg/ml hygromycin D (CLONTECH), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1 mm l-glutamine. In the presence of doxycycline (2 ng/ml, Sigma), the protein synthesis was repressed, whereas in its absence, the synthesis was induced. The levels of cytosolic ferritins were assayed in extracts of 106 cells with ELISA assays using the monoclonal antibody rH02 calibrated on the recombinant homopolymer (28Cozzi A. Levi S. Bazzigaluppi E. Ruggeri G. Arosio P. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1989; 184: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant MtF was not recognized by L-ferritin ELISA, but it gave a signal in the H-ferritin ELISA that corresponded to 1% of the ferritin content and was also recognized by this antibody in Western blots. Protein concentration was evaluated by the BCA method (Pierce) calibrated on bovine serum albumin. In immunoblot experiments, 30 μg of soluble proteins were separated by PAGE in 7% non-denaturing gels. Nitrocellulose filters from the blotted gel were incubated with rabbit anti-Δ9MtF antiserum (dilution 1:2,000) or rHO2 monoclonal antibody (dilution 1:1,000) followed by peroxidase-labeled antibody (Sigma). The bound peroxidase was revealed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). In experiments with transient transfectants, the cells (2 × 105) were transfected with 2 μg of DNA plasmid and grown for 30 h in complete medium. Stable transfectants were induced to express ferritin by omitting doxycycline for 7 days. The cells were then incubated for 18 h, or the indicated time, with 2 μCi/ml [55Fe]ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) (ratio 1:2), 200 μm ascorbic acid, or 1 μm55Fe-labeled transferrin in DMEM, 0.5% fetal calf serum, 0.5% bovine serum albumin. The cells were washed and lysed in 0.3 ml of lysis buffer. After centrifugation, 10 μl of the soluble fraction were mixed with 0.3 ml of Ultima Gold (Packard) and counted for 1 min in a scintillation counter (Packard). The soluble proteins were analyzed also by PAGE in 7% non-denaturing gels directly or after immunoprecipitation with anti-Δ9MtF or LF03 (13Cozzi A Corsi A. Levi S. Santambrogio P. Albertini A.

The intensity of ferritin subunit bands was quantified by densitometry in the linear range. Transfectant cells were grown for 18 h in the presence of 2 μCi/ml FAC (ratio 1:2), 200 μm ascorbic acid, and mitochondrial fraction enriched as described previously (31Fiskum G. Craig S.W. Decker G.L. Lehninger A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3430-3434Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed on the plate using 0.007% digitonin in 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.15% bovine serum albumin. Unbroken cells and nuclei were first cleared by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min, and the mitochondria were precipitated by a further centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cytosolic supernatants (post-mitochondrial fractions) and the mitochondrial pellet (mitochondrial fractions) were analyzed directly or heated at 75 °C for 10 min for ferritin enrichment. The heat-stable proteins were separated by PAGE in 7.5% non-denaturing gels and exposed to autoradiography. After transient transfection, the cells (5 × 105) were grown for 30 h, or the stable clones were grown for 7 days in the absence of doxycycline. Then, they were incubated for 1 h in DMEM, methionine, and cysteine-free (ICN) 0.5% fetal calf serum, 0.5% bovine serum albumin and were labeled for 18 h with 50 μCi/ml [35S]methionine, [35S]cysteine (ICN) in the same medium (13Cozzi A Corsi A.

The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed with 500 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm LiCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Total radioactivity associated with the soluble proteins was determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. For immunoprecipitation studies, 4 × 106 cpm of cytosolic lysates were precleared by incubation with 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose 50% v/v (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle shaking and centrifuged for 1 min at 14,000 rpm. Then, anti-ferritin L-chain monoclonal antibody (LF03) or mouse anti-MtF antibody was added, incubated for 1 h followed by protein A-Sepharose (30 μl). The samples were then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, and the precipitates were collected. The soluble fractions were further incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 30 μg of anti-ferritin H-chain antibody (rH02) and protein A-Sepharose (30 μl) and precipitated (13Cozzi A Corsi A. Levi S.

The immunobeads were washed, resuspended in SDS buffer, boiled for 10 min, and loaded on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gels were treated with autoradiography image enhancer (Amplify, Amersham Biosciences), dried, and exposed. Cells expressing MtF and its mutants were fixed and permeabilized (17Levi S. Corsi B.

The preparations were then overlaid with rH02 (0.5 μg/ml) antibody followed by rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and washed as described previously. Fluorescence was visualized on an Axiophot microscope (Zeiss) with a 554-nm filter for rhodamine. For immunoelectron microscopy, the cells were fixed for 15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.25% glutaraldehyde mixture, detached by scrubbing, and centrifuged. The pellets were infiltrated in 0.6m sucrose mixed with 7% polyvinylpyrrolidone and then brought to 1.86 m sucrose and 20% polyvinylpyrrolidone by successive increases of the infiltrating solution. Freezing was in a 3:1 mixture of propane and cyclopentane cooled with liquid nitrogen. Ultrathin cryosections (50–100 nm) were cut using an Ultracut ultramicrotome equipped with a Reichert FC4 cryosectioning apparatus and processed as described previously (32Villa A. Podini P. Nori A. Panzeri M.C. Martini A. Meldolesi J. Volpe P. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 209: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In brief, the cryosections were collected over nickel grids and covered with 2% gelatin. After treatment with 125 mm phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 100 mm glycine, the sections were exposed for 2 h at 37 °C to anti-Δ9MtF in phosphate-glycine buffer, then washed with the buffer, and finally labeled with anti-IgG-coated gold particles (6 nm, dilution 1:60 in the same buffer). Cryosections were then examined by electron microscopy. The cDNA for the human MtF precursor was subcloned into pcDNA3 vector to transiently transfect HeLa cells. MtF protein expression was first analyzed using anti-Δ9MtF antibodies by Western blot after separating cell extracts on non-denaturing PAGE. No MtF was detected in the untransfected HeLa cells, but high levels were found in the transfectants (Fig1 A, lanes 1 and2). The single band in the transfectants had a similar, but slightly slower, mobility than that of the cytoplasmic ferritin shown in Fig. 1 A (lane 3), indicating that MtF has a similar multimeric structure. To explore iron uptake into MtF, cells were incubated with the 55Fe label, supplied as FAC, for 18 h. Cells and organelles were lysed with 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and the proteins in supernatant fractions were separated on non-denaturing gels and then exposed to autoradiography. The untransfected parent cells gave a single radioactive band corresponding to the cytosolic ferritin and none in the position of MtF (Fig 1A, lane 3). The MtF transfectants showed uptake into cytosolic ferritin but also into a slower band in the position of MtF (Fig. 1 A, lane 6). To confirm the identity of the bands, cytosolic ferritin heteropolymers were first precipitated from the cell extracts with an excess of anti-L-chain LF03 antibody (13Cozzi A Corsi A. Levi S. Santambrogio P. Albertini A. Arosio P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25122-25126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). This treatment eliminated the band corresponding to the cytosolic ferritin but left the MtF band (Fig. 1 A, lanes 5and 8). In contrast, anti-Δ9MtF antibody essentially eliminated the upper band specific to the transfected cells but had no effect on the lower band (Fig. 1 A, lanes 4 and7). These results identify MtF and show that it is a homopolymer, as predicted from its compartmentalization, and that it actively incorporates iron in vivo. To confirm the cellular compartmentalization of the ferritins, the plasma membranes of the cells were lysed with digitonin, and the mitochondrial fractions of 55Fe-labeled cells were separated from the cytosolic fraction by differential centrifugation (31Fiskum G. Craig S.W. Decker G.L. Lehninger A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3430-3434Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Ferritin was partially purified from both fractions by heat extraction and identified by its electrophoretic mobility and the bound radioactive iron. Autoradiography showed that the MtF band was highly enriched in the mitochondrial fraction (Fig. 1 B,MF) of the transfected cells, whereas cytosolic ferritins were almost exclusively associated with the post-mitochondrial fractions (Fig. 1 B, PMF) of the control and transfected cells (Fig. 1 B). We conclude that MtF is restricted to mitochondria, where it assembles into ferritin-like structures that incorporate iron. To explore structural and functional elements for iron uptake into MtF, different constructs were expressed in HeLa cells. MtF222 has Glu-62 → Lys and His-65 → Gly (H-chain numbering), which inactivate the ferroxidase activity of human H-ferritin (13Cozzi A Corsi A. Levi S. Santambrogio P. Albertini A. Arosio P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25122-25126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). T-MtF represents the predicted mature protein lacking the mitochondrial targeting sequence and starting at position −2 (H-chain numbering). Finally, Mt-HF has the N-terminal MtF sequence (residues 1–60) fused to the H-chain and predicted to be cleaved at residue 58. Transfectant ferritins were identified wit"
https://openalex.org/W2092107676,"The brain's earliest self-representational capacities arose as evolution found neural network solutions for coordinating and regulating inner-body signals, thereby improving behavioral strategies. Additional flexibility in organizing coherent behavioral options emerges from neural models that represent some of the brain's inner states as states of its body, while representing other signals as perceptions of the external world. Brains manipulate inner models to predict the distinct consequences in the external world of distinct behavioral options. The self thus turns out to be identifiable not with a nonphysical soul, but rather with a set of representational capacities of the physical brain."
https://openalex.org/W1997995208,"Eucrites are a class of basaltic meteorites that share common mineralogical, isotopic, and chemical properties and are thought to have been derived from the same parent body, possibly asteroid 4 Vesta. The texture, mineralogy, and noble gas data of the recently recovered meteorite, Northwest Africa (NWA) 011, are similar to those of basaltic eucrites. However, the oxygen isotopic composition of NWA011 is different from that of other eucrites, indicating that NWA011 may be derived from a different parent body. The presence of basaltic meteorites with variable oxygen isotopic composition suggests the occurrence of multiple basaltic meteorite parent bodies, perhaps similar to 4 Vesta, in the early solar system."

Furthermore, oligomerization of Pma1p is linked to membrane lipid composition; Pma1p is rendered monomeric in cells depleted of ceramide, suggesting that association with lipid rafts may influence oligomerization. Surprisingly, monomeric Pma1p present in ceramide-deficient membranes can be exported from the ER in COPII vesicles in a reaction that is stimulated by Lst1p.

At steady state, it composes >25% of the total protein at the plasma membrane, where it generates a proton gradient that maintains the intracellular pH and drives the import of nutrients (1Serrano R.

Pma1p spans the lipid bilayer with 10 transmembrane segments and belongs to the family of P2-type ATPases, which includes the Na+,K+-ATPases and Ca2+-ATPases of the mammalian plasma membrane (2Morsomme P.

Chem. 2001; 276: 29613-29616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). As with other integral membrane proteins destined for the plasma membrane, Pma1p is translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 and travels through a series of transport vesicles to its final destination (4Holcomb C.L.

Exit out of the ER is mediated by COPII (coat protein complex II) vesicles, a universal mechanism in eukaryotes employing a set of cytoplasmic coat proteins (10Schekman R. Orci L. Science. 1996; 271: 1526-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Budding is regulated by the small G-protein Sar1p, which recruits two complexes, Sec23p-Sec24p and Sec13p-Sec31p (10Schekman R. Orci L.

On the ER membrane, Sar1p and Sec23p-Sec24p promote the capture of a number of cargo proteins, suggesting that Sec23p-Sec24p may function to selectively engage cargo proteins during coat assembly (13Kuehn M.J.

In yeast, the Sec24p homolog Lst1p was discovered in a screen for synthetic interactions with the sec13-1 allele (lethal with s ec-thirteen) (15Roberg K.J. Crotwell M. Espenshade P. Gimeno R. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 659-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). A null mutant of lst1 is viable, although sensitive to low pH resulting from a reduced flux of Pma1p out of the ER (15Roberg K.J. Crotwell M. Espenshade P. Gimeno R. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 659-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Efficient incorporation of Pma1p into COPII vesicles requires a combination of both Sec24p and Lst1p complexes, unlike other cargo proteins studied to date (16Pagano A. Letourneur F.

In addition to the enhancement of Pma1p packaging, Lst1p-positive vesicles are ∼15% larger than vesicles generated with standard COPII subunits (17Shimoni Y. Kurihara T. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M.

Both oligomeric and monomeric Pma1p are packaged into COPII vesicles, and both forms of Pma1p require Lst1p for efficient transport from the ER.

Membranes were first washed with buffer B (20 mm Hepes, 250 mm sorbitol, 150 mm KOAc, and 5 mmMg(OAc)2, pH 6.8); and unless otherwise noted, budding reactions contained 20 μg/ml Sar1p and Sec13p-Sec31p and either 20 μg/ml Sec23p-Sec24p or 10 μg/ml each Sec23p-Sec24p and Sec23p-Lst1p as well as the non-hydrolyzable GTP analog GMP-PMP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and an ATP regeneration system. Budding reactions for BN-PAGE used 100 μg of microsomes (125-μl reaction), and those for Fig. 3 B used 400 μg of microsomes (500-μl reaction). Budding from labeled semi-intact cells used cells atA 600 = 1.25 (125-μl reaction). For electron microscopy, vesicles were generated from 1.5 mg of microsomes washed to remove endogenous COPII proteins (2× buffer B + 2.5 murea, 2× buffer B + 1 mm GTP, and 3× buffer B). All reactions were performed for 30 min at 25 °C. The vesicle-enriched medium speed supernatant (MSS) was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min. The vesicle pellet was processed as described (12Antonny B. Madden D. Hamamoto S. Orci L. Schekman R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Vesicle diameter was measured from scanned negatives (×30,000) using the Photoshop measuring tool. A sample of 500 vesicles was measured for each condition. We used BN-PAGE to examine the oligomeric state of Pma1p in microsomal membranes. Membranes generated from a strain expressing a chromosomal HA-tagged form of Pma1p were solubilized with different detergents, and the proteins were separated by BN-PAGE (Fig.1 A). Pma1p migrated as a distinct high molecular mass complex of ∼1.8 MDa in extracts solubilized with Triton X-100, digitonin, or n-dodecyl maltoside. Pma1p solubilized with SDS migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 160 kDa, most likely corresponding to monomeric protein, which has a predicted molecular mass of ∼100 kDa. Interestingly, two bands of intermediate size were observed inn-dodecyl maltoside extracts; the apparent sizes of these intermediates corresponded closely to those of predicted trimeric and hexameric complexes of Pma1p (Fig. 1 B) and may represent partial dissociation of a more abundant dodecameric species. Although the size of the 1.8-MDa species is suggestive of a homo-oligomeric complex of 12 Pma1p molecules (possibly arranged as four trimers), we cannot yet rule out the presence of additional proteins in the complex. To determine whether the Pma1p multimer originates in the ER, we examined newly synthesized Pma1p in the sec18-1 strain, which is rapidly blocked in ER-to-Golgi transport at 37 °C. Cells were shifted to 37 °C for 5 min, and expression of epitope-tagged Pma1p was induced with galactose for 30 min. Oligomerization of the induced Pma1p was observed in both wild-type and sec18-1extracts (Fig. 1 C), whereas no protein was detected in the absence of galactose (data not shown). Although Pma1p in wild-type cells was found predominantly as the oligomeric species, imposition of a sec18 block resulted in approximately equal amounts of oligomeric and monomeric Pma1p. Thus, Pma1p can oligomerize in the ER, but oligomerization is somewhat impeded by a block in ER-to-Golgi transport. The observation that Pma1p associates with DIGs or lipid rafts (6Bagnat M. Keranen S. Shevchenko A. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3254-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar) prompted us to investigate whether oligomerization is correlated with sphingolipid biosynthesis. To deplete cell membranes of sphingolipids, we used the lcb1-100 strain, which has a temperature-sensitive mutation in a subunit of serine palmitoyltransferase and is unable to synthesize sphingoid base, ceramide, and sphingolipids (22Buede R. Rinker-Schaffer C. Pinto W.J. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4325-4332Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Bagnat et al. (6Bagnat M. Keranen S. Shevchenko A. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3254-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar) found that Pma1p isolated from lcb1-100 cells grown at restrictive temperature is no longer raft-associated. We examined the oligomeric state of Pma1p in wild-type and lcb1-100 cells grown either at 24 °C or after a 2-h shift to 37 °C. Unlike wild-type membranes, Pma1p isolated from lcb1-100 cells migrated almost exclusively as the monomeric form, regardless of the temperature at which the cells were grown (Fig.2 A). This is consistent with the observation that sphingolipid levels in lcb1-100 cells are considerably lower than those in wild-type cells even at 24 °C (23Zanolari B. Friant S. Funato K. Sutterlin C. Stevenson B.J. Riezman H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2824-2833Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). We investigated whether addition of exogenous sphingoid base in the form of phytosphingosine (PHS) could restore the levels of sphingolipid sufficiently to allow oligomerization of Pma1p. Both wild-type and lcb1-100 cells grown at 24 °C were supplemented with various levels of PHS for 2 h and analyzed by BN-PAGE (Fig. 2 B). Addition of 1–10 μm PHS tolcb1-100 cells promoted increased oligomerization of Pma1p. Interestingly, the proportion of oligomeric Pma1p in wild-type cells was also increased by addition of low levels of PHS, suggesting that oligomerization is intimately linked with sphingolipid levels in the cell. Depletion of sphingolipid levels can also be achieved by addition of drugs such as myriocin, which inhibits serine palmitoyltransferase activity (24Horvath A. Sutterlin C. Manning-Krieg U. Movva N.R. Riezman H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3687-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and aureobasidin A (AbA), which blocks synthesis of the sphingolipid inositol phosphorylceramide from ceramide (25Nagiec M.M. Nagiec E.E. Baltisberger J.A. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9809-9817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). To determine whether myriocin influences Pma1p oligomerization, we treated cells with up to 40 μg/ml myriocin for 2 h. Under these conditions, we were unable to observe a significant shift of the steady-state levels of oligomeric Pma1p to monomer (data not shown), suggesting either that depletion of sphingolipid was not sufficient during the 2-h treatment or that, once formed, Pma1p oligomers are resistant to a decrease in sphingolipid levels. To analyze the effects of myriocin and AbA on newly synthesized Pma1p, we used the galactose-inducible HA-tagged Pma1p plasmid described above. Wild-type cells expressing endogenous untagged Pma1p were grown in non-inducing medium at 24 °C and treated with myriocin or AbA for 15 min before induction of HA-tagged Pma1p. Unlike control cells, myriocin-treated cells showed a defect in the ability of newly synthesized Pma1p to oligomerize (Fig. 2 C). However, oligomerization was not prevented in cells treated with AbA (Fig. 2 C), suggesting that either ceramide or sphingoid base (but not sphingolipids per se) is required for Pma1p oligomerization. Under these conditions, AbA prevented the incorporation of 12-(N-methyl-N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl))ceramide into inositol phosphorylceramide as determined by TLC (26Levine T.P. Wiggins C.A. Munro S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2267-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). 2P. Malkus and R. Schekman, personal communication. We assessed the effect of ceramide depletion on the stability of Pma1p by a 35S pulse-chase analysis. In wild-type cells, Pma1p remained stable throughout the chase period (Fig. 2 D), consistent with its long half-life (5Chang A. Slayman C.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In both lcb1-100cells and myriocin-treated wild-type cells, however, Pma1p was markedly destabilized. Myriocin failed to induce degradation of Pma1p inpep4Δ cells, suggesting that monomeric Pma1p is permitted to exit the ER, but is subsequently rerouted to the vacuole. A block in ceramide synthesis by myriocin treatment or by growth oflcb1-100 cells at nonpermissive temperature prevents the ER-to-Golgi transport of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein Gas1p (24Horvath A. Sutterlin C. Manning-Krieg U. Movva N.R. Riezman H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3687-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 27Sutterlin C. Doering T.L. Schimmoller F. Schroder S. Riezman H. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2703-2714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which associates with DIGs before leaving the ER (6Bagnat M. Keranen S. Shevchenko A. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3254-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). To determine whether oligomerization of Pma1p in the ER coincides with its entry into Triton X-100-insoluble DIGs, we isolated DIGs from pulse-labeled sec18-1 cells. At permissive temperature, the proportion of Pma1p associated with DIGs increased markedly after prolonged chase (Fig.3 A). Gas1p displayed a similar pattern, with a proportion of both the ER form (2 min) and the Golgi-modified form (15 min) in the detergent-insoluble fraction (Fig.3 A). At 37 °C, the pool of DIG-associated Gas1p increased after extended chase, whereas Pma1p was no longer observed in DIGs (Fig. 3 A). This suggests that, unlike Gas1p, Pma1p does not associate with lipid rafts in the ER or, alternatively, that a block in ER export diminishes the stability of the association of Pma1p with lipid rafts. To distinguish between these possibilities, we analyzed the detergent solubility of Pma1p in ER-derived COPII vesicles. Microsomal membranes were used in a vesicle budding reaction using purified COPII proteins (Sar1p, Sec23p-Sec24p, and Sec13p-Sec31p) together with the Sec24p homolog Lst1p. The vesicle-enriched MSS was subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 × g to pellet vesicles, from which DIGs were isolated by flotation as described above. Vesicles generated in the presence of nucleotide showed efficient budding of Pma1p, whereas the ER resident Sec61p was not packaged into vesicles (Fig.3 B). A significant proportion of Pma1p in COPII vesicles was in a detergent-insoluble pool (fractions 5 and 6) (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, the SNARE proteins Sec22p, Bet1p, and Bos1p were efficiently incorporated into COPII vesicles, but were not DIG-associated (Fig. 3 B and data not shown). To confirm that the DIG-associated Pma1p observed in the in vitro budding reaction corresponded to newly synthesized protein from the ER, we performed a budding reaction using semi-intact cells generated after a brief period of radiolabeling. Vesicle DIGs were isolated by flotation, and Pma1p was immunoprecipitated from fractions representative of detergent-insoluble and detergent-soluble material. A significant fraction (11%) of Pma1p in COPII vesicles was DIG-associated (Fig. 3 C). Thus, Pma1p association with DIGs either is stabilized by entry into COPII vesicles or occurs initially in the ER, but is disrupted by the imposition of a secretion block. The dependence of Pma1p oligomerization on ceramide biosynthesis, together with the observation that Pma1p is associated with DIGs in COPII vesicles, prompted us to investigate the effect of ceramide depletion on the oligomeric state of Pma1p packaged into vesicles. COPII vesicles were generated from wild-type microsomes or microsomes derived fromlcb1-100 cells and analyzed by BN-PAGE. In vesicles generated from wild-type microsomes, Pma1p was packaged as the large oligomeric species (Fig. 4 A). Interestingly, COPII vesicles generated from lcb1-100microsomes packaged Pma1p, but the protein remained in the monomeric form (Fig. 4 A). We investigated whether oligomerization might enhance the uptake of Pma1p into vesicles, possibly by allowing more efficient recruitment of vesicle coat components to the ER membrane. We performed budding reactions with 35S-labeled cells grown in the presence of myriocin for 2 h, a treatment that renders Pma1p monomeric (see Fig. 2 C). lst1-null cells were used to allow an accurate titration of Pma1p budding by addition of increasing amounts of purified Lst1p and Sec24p complexes in the presence of constant levels of Sar1p and Sec13p-Sec31p. In both myriocin-treated and control membranes, Pma1p budding was stimulated by increasing concentrations of Sec24p and Lst1p complexes (Fig. 4 B). No significant differences in budding efficiency were observed between wild-type and myriocin-treated membranes, regardless of the concentration of COPII components provided. We next investigated more directly the relationship between the oligomeric state of Pma1p and the requirement for Lst1p in ER export. Shimoni et al. (17Shimoni Y. Kurihara T. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Orci L. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 973-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) proposed two possible mechanisms for the Lst1p-mediated stimulation of Pma1p budding. Lst1p may act as a “cargo-adapter,” binding directly to Pma1p to efficiently recruit it into a nascent vesicle. Alternatively, Lst1p may form larger vesicles with a lower membrane curvature and greater surface area, thus indirectly facilitating the packaging of oligomeric Pma1p. If so, the ability of high levels of Sec24p to overcome the requirement for Lst1p in Pma1p packaging (17Shimoni Y. Kurihara T. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Orci L. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 973-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) may reflect an increase in the incorporation of monomeric Pma1p into nascent vesicles. To address this issue, we compared the oligomeric state of Pma1p in vesicles that had been generated with either a combination of Sec24p and Lst1p complexes or with high levels of the Sec24p complex alone (Fig. 4 C). Analysis of vesicles by BN-PAGE revealed that the presence of Lst1p was not essential for packaging oligomeric Pma1p, which could be accommodated in Lst1p-negative vesicles given a sufficient quantity of coat proteins (Fig. 4 C). We next considered whether Pma1p rendered monomeric by ceramide depletion may bypass the requirement for Lst1p and be incorporated into the smaller vesicles generated with the standard COPII proteins. Membranes were isolated from lst1Δ cells treated with myriocin and incubated with low-to-intermediate concentrations of Sec24p and Lst1p complexes. Under these conditions, Pma1p was not significantly packaged when only the Sec24p complex was added (Fig.4 D); however, addition of equivalent amounts of both Sec24p and Lst1p complexes stimulated budding ∼3-fold in both myriocin-treated and control membranes. We conclude that the oligomeric state of Pma1p does not enhance budding and that both the oligomeric complex and the monomeric protein require Lst1p for efficient incorporation into COPII vesicles. The requirement for Lst1p to package both oligomeric and monomeric Pma1p suggests a function as a cargo-specific adapter, rather than an indirect role in accommodating large complexes. We considered the possibility that the larger size of COPII vesicles produced with the Lst1p complex was influenced by the incorporation of large DIG-associated Pma1p oligomers. Pma1p is a particularly abundant protein; thus, it is conceivable that its presence alone in Lst1p-positive vesicles may influence vesicle size. Large-scale budding reactions were performed using either wild-type or lcb1-100 microsomes prepared from cells grown at 24 °C and shifted to 37 °C for 1 h. Under these conditions, Pma1p appeared monomeric in lcb1-100 membranes (see Fig. 2 A). Microsomal membranes were washed to remove endogenous COPII components and then supplied with Sar1p, Sec13p-Sec31p, and either the Sec24p complex alone or a mixture of both Sec24p and Lst1p complexes, in addition to the non-hydrolyzable GTP analog GMP-PMP to preserve vesicle coats. The high speed vesicle pellet was analyzed by electron microscopy. Vesicles with a discernible coat were generated under all conditions, and no obvious differences in coat morphology were detected (data not shown). Lst1p-positive vesicles produced from wild-type andlcb1-100 membranes were of comparable size and were ∼10–15% larger in diameter than Lst1p-negative vesicles (TableI). Thus, incorporation of large Pma1p complexes into Lst1p-positive COPII vesicles does not explicitly determine the size of the vesicle produced.Table ILst1p generates larger COPII vesicles independently of Pma1p oligomerizationMembranes−Lst1p+Lst1p1-an = 500;p < 0.001. nm nmWild-type75 ± 1384 ± 14 lcb1–10077 ± 1485 ± 161-a n = 500;p < 0.001. Open table in a new tab Pma1p is a particularly abundant secretory protein that uniquely requires Lst1p for packaging into COPII vesicles for ER export. We have investigated the nature of this requirement with respect to the quaternary structure of Pma1p. We found that, upon BN-PAGE, Pma1p migrated as an oligomeric complex. Our estimate that this complex represents a homododecamer of Pma1p is consistent with observations in related yeast suggesting that H+-ATPases form higher order structures. Formation of a multimer of 8–10 monomers was reported for the Schizosaccharomyces pombe H+-ATPase (28Dufour J.P. Goffeau A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 105: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), whereas the Neurospora crassa H+-ATPase was observed as a hexamer upon gradient centrifugation and crystallization (29Chadwick C.C. Goormaghtigh E. Scarborough G.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 252: 348-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 30Auer M. Scarborough G.A. Kuhlbrandt W. Nature. 1998; 392: 840-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Oligomerization does not appear to be essential for activity, however, as monomeric protein isolated from N. crassa was reconstituted into proteoliposomes as fully active enzyme (31Goormaghtigh E. Chadwick C. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7466-7471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Bagnat et al. (7Bagnat M. Chang A. Simons K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 4129-4138Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) reported that a fraction ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae Pma1p behaves as an oligomer of ∼400 kDa on SDS/Triton X-100 velocity gradients. In contrast, we observed by BN-PAGE that the majority of Pma1p migrated as an ∼1.8-MDa complex under a variety of detergent conditions. However, a small proportion of Pma1p migrated at ∼490 kDa when membranes were solubilized with SDS (Fig. 1 A), which may correspond to the complex observed by Bagnat et al. (7Bagnat M. Chang A. Simons K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 4129-4138Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Interestingly, overexpression of a peripheral membrane protein (Ast1p) was found to substantially increase the proportion of the ∼400-kDa Pma1p complex, in addition to conferring increased raft association on a mutant Pma1p protein (7Bagnat M. Chang A. Simons K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 4129-4138Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Upon BN-PAGE, Ast1p did not co-migrate with the 1.8-MDa Pma1p complex and thus does not contribute to the increased size of the Pma1p oligomer we observed (data not shown). The association of Pma1p with lipid rafts and with Ast1p was proposed by Bagnat et al. (7Bagnat M. Chang A. Simons K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 4129-4138Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) to occur in the Golgi; however, our observation that raft-associated Pma1p oligomers can be isolated from COPII vesicles suggests that entry into rafts and oligomerization begin before arrival at the Golgi. The formation of an oligomeric Pma1p complex in the ER is consistent with the observation that expression of a number of dominant-negative mutants of Pma1p results in the retention of both the mutant and wild-type proteins in the ER (18Portillo F. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 32Harris S.L., Na, S. Zhu X. Seto-Young D. Perlin D.S. Teem J.H. Haber J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10531-10535Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Formation of mixed oligomers between the normal and mutant proteins could lead to the recognition of the entire complex as misfolded and subject to ER quality control. This model is supported by our observations that assembly of the multimeric Pma1p complex is dependent on the level of ceramide biosynthesis and that a block in this pathway relieves the dominant lethal phenotype of a Pma1p mutant. 3Q. Wang and A. Chang, personal communication. The association of Pma1p with DIGs suggests one possible mechanism for oligomerization whereby newly synthesized Pma1p preferentially partitions into lipid microdomains, creating a local concentration of protein sufficient to drive oligomerization. A decrease in the flux of ceramide through the ER may result in the fragmentation of these microdomains such that oligomerization is prevented. Alternatively, oligomerization may proceed concurrently but independently of the formation of nascent lipid rafts, requiring only a product of the ceramide biosynthesis pathway. We are currently examining the oligomeric state of Pma1p in membranes depleted of ergosterol. In contrast with the transport of Gas1p, which fails to reach the Golgi if ceramide biosynthesis is interrupted (24Horvath A. Sutterlin C. Manning-Krieg U. Movva N.R. Riezman H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3687-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 27Sutterlin C. Doering T.L. Schimmoller F. Schroder S. Riezman H. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2703-2714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), ER export of Pma1p is not dependent on the presence of ceramide or on its oligomeric state. However, the stability of Pma1p is dramatically altered by a disruption in the ceramide biosynthesis pathway, resulting in a rerouting to the vacuole for degradation. A consequence of the formation of large oligomeric cargo such as Pma1p may be the requirement for a more spacious transport vehicle (33Antonny B. Schekman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The observation that oligomeric Pma1p is packaged into COPII vesicles has allowed us to address the unique requirement for Lst1p in this process. Our finding that efficient export of Pma1p requires Lst1p regardless of cargo size suggests, however, that Lst1p functions to actively promote Pma1p packaging, possibly by direct recruitment of Pma1p during polymerization of the nascent vesicle coat. Once in COPII vesicles, Pma1p can be co-immunoprecipitated with both the Lst1p and Sec24p complexes (17Shimoni Y. Kurihara T. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Orci L. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 973-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar); however, to confirm a direct interaction, it will be necessary to reconstitute these associations in purified proteoliposomes. Such a system may help to explain the contribution of unique coat components such as Lst1p to vesicle formation. Our observation that Lst1p generates larger vesicles from membranes depleted of DIGs and oligomeric Pma1p and potentially other sphingolipid-dependent protein complexes suggests that the size of COPII vesicles is not driven by the nature of their cargo, but by the intrinsic properties of their coats.

In view of the evidence that flagellin responsiveness is subject to modulation, we explored the possibilities that a prior exposure to flagellin might result in a state of reduced flagellin responsiveness or tolerance and that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and flagellin may induce a state of cross-tolerance to each other. Our results demonstrate that a prior exposure to flagellin results in a subsequent state of flagellin tolerance in human monocytes, THP1 cells, Jurkat cells, and COS-1 cells. Tolerance occurs within 2 h after addition of flagellin and does not require protein synthesis. Flagellin did not induce tolerance to LPS in monocytes and THP1 cells; however, LPS treatment of monocytes and THP1 cells resulted in a state of flagellin cross-tolerance. Flagellin-induced self-tolerance is not the result of a decrease in the steady-state level of toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) or interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase (IRAK), but it is associated with a block in the release of IRAK from the TLR5 complex in flagellin-tolerant cells. Release is essential for IRAK activity because the TLR5-associated IRAK lacks kinase activity. LPS-induced cross-tolerance to flagellin is also associated with a block in IRAK release from TLR5.

The activation of IRAK by flagellin is a relatively rapid process; maximal activation of IRAK activity in human and murine monocytes occurs within 5–10 min after the addition of flagellin to the cells (5Moors M.A., Li, L. Mizel S.B. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 4424-4429Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In vitro studies with cultured monocytes and neutrophils as well as analysis of these cell types from patients with Gram-negative sepsis have established that prior exposure to LPS induces a transient state of cellular tolerance to subsequent stimulation by LPS (seee.g. Refs. 18McCall C.E.

LPS tolerance is present within hours after an initial exposure to LPS (21Wilson C.S. Seatter S.C. Rodriguez J.L. Bellingham J. Clair L. West M.A. J. Surg.

LPS tolerance may have evolved as a mechanism to limit the mediator storm that is induced by LPS and which is responsible for the pathologic events associated with LPS-induced septic shock. Because of the potential importance of LPS tolerance in the host response to Gram-negative infection, the underlying mechanism(s) that govern the induced state of LPS tolerance continues to be a subject of intense investigation. Although the mechanism for this effect has not been established definitively, evidence has been obtained and arguments made in favor of a role for a labile repressor (22LaRue K. McCall C.E. J. Exp.

Investigators have also analyzed the potential for LPS, lipoarabinomannan (from mycobacteria) and lipopeptides (from mycoplasma) to induce a state of cross-tolerance to each other. The available evidence indicates that LPS can induce tolerance to several unrelated inducers including lipoarabinomannan (28Riedel D.D. Kaufmann S.H. Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) mycoplasma lipopeptides (29Sato S. Nomura F. Kawai T. Takeuchi O. Muhlradt P.F. Takeda K. Akira S. J.

Nature. 2001; 410: 1099-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2835) Google Scholar), we explored the possibilities that a prior exposure to flagellin would result in a state of reduced flagellin responsiveness and that LPS and flagellin may induce a state of cross-tolerance to each other. THP1 cells were obtained from the American Type Tissue Culture Collection. Jurkat cells (a human T cell line) constitutively expressing the SV40 large T antigen were kindly provided by Dr. Amnon Altman, La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, San Diego. These cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 20 μg/ml gentamicin. COS-1 cells were obtained from Dr. Gregory Shelness, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and gentamicin. Human peripheral blood monocytes were prepared from the blood of healthy volunteers as described previously (2Ciacci-Woolwine F. McDermott P.F. Mizel S.B. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 5176-5185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purified, endotoxin-free recombinant flagellin was prepared as described previously (4McDermott P.F. Ciacci-Woolwine F. Snipes J.A. Mizel S.B. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5525-5529Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Rabbit antibodies against human TLR5 were prepared using two TLR5 peptides (residues 463–476 and 831–846) linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Serum was obtained from the rabbit before immunization for use as a control for antibody specificity. Affinity-purified goat anti-TLR5 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit anti-IRAK antibody was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Co. and anti-FLAG antibody from Sigma. A wild-type IRAK cDNA (pcDNA3-IRAK) was kindly provided by Glaxo Smith Kline. Because the human TLR5 gene does not contain any introns, the coding region was cloned by PCR using RPCI-11 human male BAC clone 18_A-_13 and appropriate primers. The resultant PCR product was cloned into the p3XFLAG-CMV-14 expression vector (Sigma). The pNF-κB-Luc reporter vector was purchased from Stratagene and the Renilla luciferase control vector, pRL-TK, from Promega. The human TNF-α enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit was obtained from PharMingen (San Diego) and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were incubated in the presence or absence of flagellin for 4 h; and then culture supernatants were collected, centrifuged to remove cells, and assayed for TNF-α content. IRAK activity was measured as described by Li et al. (27Li L. Cousart S., Hu, J. McCall C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23340-23345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) with modification. Cells (2.5–5 × 106/sample) were incubated with or without stimulation for varying periods before lysis in immunoprecipitation buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.4% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, 14 μm pepstatin A, 3 mm benzamidine, 1 × protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem), 5 μm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 μm microcystin-LR. The resultant lysates were centrifuged to remove particulate material and then incubated with anti-IRAK antibody and protein G-agarose (Invitrogen) for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed several times with immunoprecipitation buffer and then with the IRAK buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm Mg2Cl, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μm microcystin-LR, and 5 μm ATP. Myelin basic protein (2 μg/reaction) and 10 μCi of [32P]ATP were added, and the reactions were allowed to proceed for 30 min at 37 °C. The samples were then electrophoresed in 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and exposed to x-ray film. The level of IRAK protein was assessed using Western blots. Samples of the anti-IRAK immunoprecipitates were electrophoresed in a 7.5% SDS gel and transferred electrophoretically to an Immunoblot PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was incubated sequentially with the anti-IRAK antibody, an anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Jackson Immunochemicals), and a chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce Chemical Co.). Quantitative analysis of Western blots was done with the Alpha Innotec Imaging System. To assess the association of IRAK with TLR5, cell lysates were incubated with anti-FLAG antibody, and the resultant immunoprecipitates were electrophoresed and the proteins transferred to a PVDF membrane. The membrane was then probed with the anti-IRAK antibody. The blots were stripped with Restore Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce) and reprobed with anti-FLAG antibodies to verify the efficiency of immunoprecipitation in each sample. In those instances in which endogenous TLR5/IRAK association was being evaluated, anti-TLR5 antibodies were used to generate the immunoprecipitates. Jurkat or COS-1 cells (5 × 106cells/sample) were transiently transfected using the Effectene transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). NF-κB-dependent reporter assays involved transient transfection of the pNF-κB-Luc reporter vector (Stratagene) and the Renilla luciferase control vector, pRL-TK (Promega). In some experiments, the cells were also transfected with a wild-type IRAK expression vector and incubated overnight in the presence or absence of flagellin. Otherwise, the cells were rested overnight before a 4-h incubation in the presence or absence of flagellin. The cells were then harvested, and lysates were prepared using the lysis buffer provided with the Promega Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System.Renilla luciferase activity was used to correct for differences in transfection efficiency among the individual samples. Control and flagellin-tolerant Jurkat cells were washed with 2% fetal bovine serum in phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with anti-TLR5 antibody for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were then washed, incubated for an additional 30 min at 4 °C with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit antibody against goat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), washed, and fixed prior to analysis using a Becton-Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer. We began by determining whether a primary incubation of human monocytes or THP1 cells with flagellin would result in a subsequent state of flagellin tolerance. In addition, we evaluated the potential ability of flagellin and LPS to induce tolerance to each other. Human monocytes and THP1 cells were incubated with or without 10−9m flagellin or 100 ng/ml LPS for ∼18 h, washed, and then incubated for an additional 4 h in the presence or absence of flagellin or LPS. Culture supernatants were collected and analyzed for TNF-α content. As shown in TableI, unstimulated human monocytes and THP1 cells (0/0) did not produce detectable levels of TNF-α. As expected, both types of cell generated high levels of TNF-α in response to a single exposure to flagellin or LPS (0/F and 0/L, respectively). As expected, a primary exposure of cells to LPS resulted in a marked reduction in subsequent responsiveness to LPS (L/L). In addition, a primary exposure to LPS also dramatically reduced the response to flagellin (L/F). This result differs from our earlier observation that LPS-tolerant human monocytes retain some responsiveness to intact flagella (2Ciacci-Woolwine F. McDermott P.F. Mizel S.B. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 5176-5185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We believe that the difference in magnitude of the post-LPS response to purified flagellin versus intact flagella may be caused by the strength of signal provided by intact flagella as opposed to purified flagellin because intact flagella may possess the ability to cross-link a far greater number of receptors than flagellin. Like LPS, flagellin also induced a state of subsequent self-tolerance (F/F) in human monocytes and THP1 cells. However, flagellin did not markedly reduce the response to LPS (F/L). These findings raised the interesting possibility that flagellin and LPS may modulate TLR signaling potential by different mechanisms.Table IInduction of tolerance by flagellin and LPS in human monocytes and THP1 cellsIncubation conditions (primary/secondary)TNF-α productionPeripheral blood monocytesTHP1 cells pg/ml0 /0000 /L19,50015,900 ± 8000 /F1,893 ± 405,500 ± 300L /L212 ± 30200 ± 100L /F97 ± 70F /L15,300 ± 6012,100 ± 200F /F0200 ± 100Monocytes or THP1 cells (2 × 106) were incubated overnight in the absence (0) or presence of 10−9mflagellin (F) or 100 ng/ml LPS (L).

The cells were then washed and incubated in the absence or presence of flagellin or LPS for 4 h. The culture medium was then harvested, centrifuged to remove cells, and assayed for TNF-α content. The values represent the mean ± S.D. of triplicate samples. In view of these initial results with flagellin and the observation that LPS tolerance may be linked, at least in part, to a decrease in the level and activity of the IRAK (27Li L. Cousart S., Hu, J. McCall C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23340-23345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), we analyzed the effect of a primary exposure to flagellin or LPS on the subsequent activation of IRAK in THP1 cells. THP1 cells were incubated overnight with or without flagellin or LPS, washed, and then incubated in the presence or absence of flagellin for 10 min or LPS for 30 min. As expected, flagellin (Fig. 1 A,second lane, 0/F) (5Moors M.A., Li, L. Mizel S.B. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 4424-4429Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and LPS (third lane, 0/L) (27Li L.

Quantitative analysis of the kinase results are shown in Fig. 2 (black bars). In line with the TNF-α results presented in Table I, a prior exposure to flagellin almost completely inhibited the activation of IRAK (F/F) but had no effect on the response to LPS (F/L). As expected, a prior exposure to LPS blocked the subsequent response to flagellin (L/F).Figure 2Quantitative analysis of IRAK activity and protein level during tolerance in THP1 cells.

F, flagellin; N, no addition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In confirmation of the results of Li et al. (27Li L. Cousart S., Hu, J. McCall C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23340-23345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), a prior exposure to LPS resulted in a marked decrease in the level of the IRAK protein (Fig. 1 B, seventh lane, and Fig. 2,gray bars). Note that the lower prominent band in Fig. 1 B is the nonphosphorylated form of IRAK, whereas the upper band is the phosphorylated form of the protein. In contrast to the results with LPS, a prior exposure to flagellin (fourth lane, F/0) did not result in a decrease in IRAK protein levels. However, the combination of overnight exposure to flagellin and a 15-min incubation with LPS did result in a decrease in the level of nonphosphorylated IRAK (sixth lane, F/L). However, there was clearly sufficient IRAK in the cells to obtain a level of active IRAK which was similar to that obtained with cells receiving only a single exposure to flagellin or LPS (Fig.1 A, second and third lanes). Because the block in flagellin-induced IRAK activation occurs without any evident change in IRAK protein expression, it seemed likely that the level of IRAK protein is not a contributing factor in the induction of flagellin tolerance. In addition, we concluded from these experiments that LPS and flagellin tolerance may be mediated, at least in part, by distinct mechanisms. To determine whether flagellin tolerance is restricted to cells of the monocytic lineage, we determined whether this condition could be induced in Jurkat cells, a human T cell line. Using an NF-κB-Luc reporter construct, we established that Jurkat cells are highly responsive to flagellin, with 50% of the maximal response being achieved with ∼7 × 10−12m flagellin (data not shown). As with monocytic cells (5Moors M.A., Li, L. Mizel S.B. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 4424-4429Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), flagellin induced a marked increase in IRAK enzyme activity in Jurkat cells (Fig.1 C, 0/F). However, overnight incubation of these cells with flagellin completely blocked the subsequent ability of to induce IRAK activation (fourth lane, F/F). In addition to Jurkat cells, we have found that flagellin tolerance can be induced in COS-1 and HEK293 cells (data not shown). Thus the ability of flagellin to induce a subsequent state of nonresponsiveness to itself is not restricted to cells of the monocytic lineage but rather appears to be a general property of TLR5-positive, flagellin-responsive cells. To determine the minimal time required for the onset of flagellin tolerance, we stimulated Jurkat cells with flagellin for 4, 12, 18, and 24 h prior to a second 15-min exposure to flagellin. After the second incubation, the level of IRAK activity was assessed. Control cells were incubated with flagellin for a single 15-min period before the measurement of IRAK activity. As shown in Fig.3 A, flagellin tolerance was maximal within 4 h after an initial exposure to flagellin and was sustained over the ensuing 24 h. In view of the relatively rapid onset of flagellin tolerance, we next determined whether protein synthesis was required. Jurkat cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 10 μg/ml cycloheximide for 15 min before a subsequent 2- or 4-h incubation in the presence of flagellin. The cells were then washed and incubated with flagellin for 15 min before the measurement of IRAK activity. Control cells were incubated with or without flagellin for a single 15-min period. As presented in Fig.3 B, cycloheximide treatment did not block the onset of flagellin tolerance. Furthermore, these results also demonstrate that flagellin tolerance occurs as early as 2 h after an initial exposure to the protein. Although the results presented in Fig. 1 are consistent with the notion that flagellin tolerance is not caused by a decline in IRAK expression, we tested this hypothesis by transiently transfecting Jurkat cells with the NF-κB-Luc reporter construct and an IRAK cDNA under the transcriptional control of a constitutively active cytomegalovirus promoter. Because the Jurkat cells express the SV40 large T antigen and the IRAK expression vector contains an SV40 origin of replication, we expected that the transfected cells would constitutively express very high levels of IRAK. If flagellin tolerance is not linked to the level of IRAK, then flagellin should induce self-tolerance even though the cells express a relatively high level of IRAK protein. A representative experiment is presented in TableII. Because flagellin has a relatively rapid effect on the expression of luciferase, there was a significant level of residual luciferase activity in cells incubated overnight in the presence of flagellin (F/0). However, a second incubation with flagellin did not result in an increase in luciferase activity (F/F). This was the case whether or not the cells were transfected with the IRAK-FLAG expression plasmid. The elevated level of NF-κB-dependent luciferase expression in unstimulated cells transfected with an IRAK expression vector has been observed by other investigators (30Wesche H. Gao X., Li, X.

Using Western blots, we determined that flagellin had no effect on the level of IRAK protein expression in the transfected cells (data not shown). Taken together, the results presented in Figs. 1 and 2 and Table II establish that flagellin tolerance does not involve an effect on IRAK expression.Table IIEffect of constitutive IRAK expression on the induction of flagellin tolerance in Jurkat cellsIRAK transfectionIncubation conditions (primary/secondary)Luciferase activityTolerance RLU %No0 /0400 /F3,150F /01,205F /F1,25099Yes0 /01,0450 /F6,365F /03,485F /F3,80594Jurkat cells (5 × 106) were transfected with pNF-κB-Luc and pRL-TK.

https://openalex.org/W2153685985,"DNA damage causes cell cycle arrest in G1, S, or G2 to prevent replication on damaged DNA or to prevent aberrant mitosis. The G1 arrest requires the p53 tumor suppressor, yet the topoisomerase I inhibitor SN38 induces p53 after the G1 checkpoint such that the cells only arrest in S or G2. Hence, SN38 facilitates comparison of p53 wild-type and mutant cells with regard to the efficacy of drugs such as 7-hydroxystaurosporine (UCN-01) that abrogate S and G2 arrest. UCN-01 abrogated S and G2arrest in the p53 mutant breast tumor cell line MDA-MB-231 but not in the p53 wild-type breast line, MCF10a. This resistance to UCN-01 in the p53 wild-type cells correlated with suppression of cyclins A and B. In the p53 mutant cells, low concentrations of UCN-01 caused S phase cells to progress to G2 before undergoing mitosis and death, whereas high concentrations caused rapid premature mitosis and death of S phase cells. UCN-01 inhibits Chk1/2, which should activate the mitosis-inducing phosphatase Cdc25C, yet this phosphatase remained inactive during S phase progression induced by low concentrations of UCN-01, probably because Cdc25C is also inhibited by the constitutive kinase, C-TAK1. High concentrations of UCN-01 caused rapid activation of Cdc25C, which is attributed to inhibition of C-TAK1, as well as Chk1/2. Hence, UCN-01 has multiple effects depending on concentration and cell phenotype that must be considered when investigating mechanisms of checkpoint regulation. DNA damage causes cell cycle arrest in G1, S, or G2 to prevent replication on damaged DNA or to prevent aberrant mitosis. The G1 arrest requires the p53 tumor suppressor, yet the topoisomerase I inhibitor SN38 induces p53 after the G1 checkpoint such that the cells only arrest in S or G2. Hence, SN38 facilitates comparison of p53 wild-type and mutant cells with regard to the efficacy of drugs such as 7-hydroxystaurosporine (UCN-01) that abrogate S and G2 arrest. UCN-01 abrogated S and G2arrest in the p53 mutant breast tumor cell line MDA-MB-231 but not in the p53 wild-type breast line, MCF10a. This resistance to UCN-01 in the p53 wild-type cells correlated with suppression of cyclins A and B. In the p53 mutant cells, low concentrations of UCN-01 caused S phase cells to progress to G2 before undergoing mitosis and death, whereas high concentrations caused rapid premature mitosis and death of S phase cells. UCN-01 inhibits Chk1/2, which should activate the mitosis-inducing phosphatase Cdc25C, yet this phosphatase remained inactive during S phase progression induced by low concentrations of UCN-01, probably because Cdc25C is also inhibited by the constitutive kinase, C-TAK1. High concentrations of UCN-01 caused rapid activation of Cdc25C, which is attributed to inhibition of C-TAK1, as well as Chk1/2. Hence, UCN-01 has multiple effects depending on concentration and cell phenotype that must be considered when investigating mechanisms of checkpoint regulation. 7-hydroxystaurosporine cytosine arabinoside (cytarabine) ataxia telangiectasia-mutated ataxia telangiectasia-related protein Progression through the cell cycle is regulated carefully to avoid proliferation or mitosis when adverse conditions exist. For example, DNA damage causes cell cycle arrest in G1, S, or G2 to prevent replication on damaged DNA or to prevent aberrant mitosis. The regulatory mechanisms are known as checkpoints, and their function is to inhibit progression until the cell has adequately repaired the damage. The p53 tumor suppressor protein is required for the DNA damage-induced G1 arrest but not for arrest in S or G2. Hence, normal cells arrest primarily in G1 whereas p53-defective tumor cells arrest in S or G2. This observation has led to interest in developing pharmacological agents that can abrogate S and G2 arrest and that would thereby enhance toxicity selectively in the tumor. The first compound found to abrogate G2 arrest was caffeine (1Lau C.C. Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2942-2946Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar,2Schlegel R. Pardee A.B. Science. 1986; 232: 1264-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), but the concentrations required cannot be tolerated by a patient. An important additional observation was that any p53 wild-type cells that arrest in S or G2 remain resistant to caffeine-mediated abrogation (3Russell K.J. Wiens L.W. Demers G.W. Galloway D.A. Plon S.E. Groudine M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1639-1642PubMed Google Scholar, 4Powell S.N. DeFrank J.S. Connell P. Eogan M. Preffer F. Dombkowski D. Tang W. Friend S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1643-1648PubMed Google Scholar). This gave further support for the hypothesis that checkpoint abrogators could enhance selectively cytotoxic therapy in many tumors. We reported recently that 7-hydroxystaurosporine (UCN-01)1 is 100,000-fold more potent than caffeine, abrogates S and G2 arrest, and enhances cell killing selectively in p53-defective cells (5Bunch R.T. Eastman A. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 791-797PubMed Google Scholar, 6Wang Q. Fan S. Eastman A. Worland P.J. Sausville E.A. O'Connor P.M. J. Natl.

Subsequently, the mechanisms of checkpoint regulation have become better defined (8Rhind N. Russell P. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3889-3896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it appears that the target for UCN-01-mediated abrogation of G2 arrest is Chk1 (9Graves P.R., Yu, L. Schwarz J.K. Gales J. Sausville E.A. O'Connor P.M. Piwinica-Worms H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5600-5605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 10Busby E.C. Leistritz D.F. Abraham R.T. Karnitz L.M. Sarkaria J.N. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2108-2112PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of DNA damage, Chk1 is phosphorylated by ATM or ATR and activated. Chk1 then phosphorylates and inactivates the Cdc25C protein phosphatase thereby preventing activation of the cyclin B·Cdk1 mitotic kinase complex. A second checkpoint regulator, Chk2, is activated similarly by DNA damage and also phosphorylates Cdc25C. It was reported initially that UCN-01 did not inhibit Chk2 (9Graves P.R., Yu, L. Schwarz J.K. Gales J. Sausville E.A. O'Connor P.M. Piwinica-Worms H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5600-5605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 10Busby E.C. Leistritz D.F. Abraham R.T. Karnitz L.M. Sarkaria J.N. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2108-2112PubMed Google Scholar), raising the question of how Cdc25C can be activated if Chk2 remains active. However, a recent report has suggested that Chk2 is also inhibited by UCN-01 (11Yu Q. Rose J.H.L. Zhang H. Pommier Y. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 2001; 42: 800Google Scholar). There is a third kinase, C-TAK1, that phosphorylates and inhibits Cdc25C constitutively in the absence of DNA damage (12Peng C.-Y. Graves P.R. Ogg S. Thoma R.S. Byrnes M.J., Wu, Z. Stephenson M.T. Piwnica-Worms H. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 197-208PubMed Google Scholar), and this is also sensitive to UCN-01 (10Busby E.C. Leistritz D.F. Abraham R.T. Karnitz L.M. Sarkaria J.N. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2108-2112PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, Plk3 also appears to phosphorylate and inhibit Cdc25C when cells are damaged, but its sensitivity to UCN-01 is unknown (13Xie S., Wu, H. Wang Q. Cogswell J.P. Husain I. Conn C. Stambrook P. Jhanwar-Uniyal M. Dai W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43305-43312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In contrast, caffeine has been shown to abrogate arrest through inhibition of ATM and ATR (14Blasina A. Price B.D. Turenne G.A. McGowan C.H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1135-1138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 15Sarkaria J.N. Busby E.C. Tibbetts R.S. Roos P. Taya Y. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibition of Chk1/2 and activation of Cdc25C can explain the abrogation of G2 arrest by UCN-01, but the potential involvement of this pathway in abrogation of S phase arrest is more complex. The literature refers generally to a single S phase checkpoint following DNA damage while ignoring the fact that there are several possible consequences that may reflect different mechanisms. The S phase checkpoint has been referred to variously as the replication checkpoint, the intra-S phase checkpoint, or simply the S → M checkpoint to describe cells that undergo premature mitosis directly from S phase (16Zeng Y. Forbes K.C., Wu, Z. Moreno S. Piwnica-Worms H. Enoch T. Nature. 1998; 395: 507-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 17Santocanale C. Diffley J.F.X. Nature. 1998; 395: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 18Moser B.A. Brondello J.-M. Baber-Furnari B. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4288-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Yet in our previous work, we have shown that S phase-arrested cells progress to G2 before undergoing a lethal mitosis and furthermore, that inhibition of mitosis with nocodazole can delay cell death (7Bunch R.T. Eastman A. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 779-788PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lee S.I. Brown M.K. Eastman A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 1713-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The difference between these studies may relate to the specific agent used to arrest cells. Our studies have focused on DNA-damaging agents. In many other cases, S phase arrest has been induced by incubation with either antimetabolites such as hydroxyurea or cytarabine (araC) or the DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin. These cells are unable to progress through S when the checkpoint is inhibited and often enter directly into a premature mitosis. Many of the same proteins have been implicated in both pathways, and it is not clear what discriminates the mechanisms of these two phenotypically different forms of S phase checkpoint. Much of our previous work involved the DNA-damaging agent cisplatin, which causes arrest at different phases of the cell cycle depending on both p53 status and drug concentration (7Bunch R.T. Eastman A. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 779-788PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lee S.I. Brown M.K. Eastman A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 1713-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 20Sorenson C.M. Eastman A. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 6703-6707PubMed Google Scholar, 21Demarcq C. Bunch R.T. Creswell D. Eastman A. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 983-993PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, in p53 mutant cells, the predominant arrest at low concentrations of cisplatin is at G2, whereas increasing concentrations arrest cells at S or even G1. p53 wild-type cells show an additional arrest in G1 at all concentrations, which can confound analysis of the role of p53 in checkpoint abrogation. In continuing work presented here, we have found that cell cycle arrest induced by the topoisomerase I inhibitor SN38 appears to be independent of p53 status. This occurs, because the primary lesion results from a topoisomerase I-mediated cleavage event in S phase, which is beyond the G1checkpoint regulated by p53. Hence, both p53 wild-type and mutant cells arrest in G2 phase at low concentration of SN38 and then late, mid-, or early S phase as the concentration increases. This has provided an excellent model for analyzing the impact of checkpoint-targeted drugs on abrogation of S phase arrest. Using this model, we find that UCN-01 abrogates S and G2 arrest in the p53 mutant breast tumor cell line MDA-MB-231 but not in the immortalized p53 wild-type breast line, MCF10a. This resistance to UCN-01 in the p53 wild-type cells is associated with suppression of cyclins A and B. Furthermore, in the p53 mutant cells, we find a significant difference in response depending upon the concentration of UCN-01. Low concentrations of UCN-01 cause S phase cells to pass into G2 before undergoing mitosis, whereas higher concentrations cause a direct S → M progression. In contrast, cells arrested in early S phase with araC are unaffected by low concentrations of UCN-01 but undergo S → M progression at high concentrations. Evidence is presented that this dose response reflects the differential sensitivity to UCN-01 of the various protein kinases that normally inhibit Cdc25C. The breast cell lines used in this study were p53 wild-type, MCF10a and p53 mutant, MDA-MB-231 (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA). The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and fungizone (0.25 μg/ml). In addition, the MCF10a cells were maintained in 8 μg/ml insulin, 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, and 500 ng/ml hydrocortisone. SN38 was kindly provided by Dr. J. Patrick McGovren (Pharmacia Upjohn Inc., Kalamazoo, MI). UCN-01 was kindly provided by Dr. Edward Sausville (National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD). The protein kinase C inhibitors GF109203X, Go6976, and chelerythrine chloride were obtained from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). ICP-1 is a novel checkpoint inhibitor synthesized at Dartmouth and will be described in detail elsewhere. These drugs were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, with the exception of chelerythrine chloride, which was dissolved in water. araC was purchased from Sigma and dissolved in water. Caffeine (Sigma) was dissolved directly in culture medium. Cells were incubated with SN38 for 24 h, after which time the drug was removed, and the cells were incubated in fresh medium with or without the addition of UCN-01 for up to an additional 24 h. Incubations with araC were for 24 h before addition of UCN-01. The other protein kinase C and checkpoint inhibitors were substituted for UCN-01 as required. Nocodazole (Sigma) was dissolved in Me2SO and used at a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml. Aphidicolin was dissolved in ethanol and used at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. Okadaic acid (Sigma) was dissolved in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide and used at 30–1000 nm. Cell cycle analysis was performed according to a procedure described previously in which attached and detached cells are harvested, fixed in ethanol, incubated with ribonuclease, and stained with propidium iodide (21Demarcq C. Bunch R.T. Creswell D. Eastman A. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 983-993PubMed Google Scholar). DNA content was then determined on a BD PharMingen FACScan flow cytometer. Results are expressed as histograms, because modeling programs, although good for displaying the number of cells in G1, S, or G2, do not display adequately the progression through S phase (i.e. discriminate early S, mid-S, and late S phase). Furthermore, the binding of propidium iodide to DNA is dependent on chromatin structure (22Darzynkiewicz Z. Traganos F. Kapuscinski J. Staiano-Coico L. Melamed M.R. Cytometry. 1984; 5: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), and extensive DNA breakage as occurs upon incubation with SN38 leads to an apparent increase in DNA content, particularly of G2-arrested cells, and the modeling programs do not accommodate this situation. Expression of cyclin A, cyclin B, and p53 were assessed by incubating ethanol-fixed cells with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-cyclin A or B antibody (PharMingen, San Diego, CA), or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-p53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) prior to addition of ribonuclease and propidium iodide. For immunoblot analysis, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed by direct addition of Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were immediately boiled for 5 min and stored at −20 °C. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (8%) and transferred to either nitrocellulose (Chk1/2) or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Cdc25C). Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 and then probed with the appropriate antibody overnight at 4 °C (Cdc25C, neomarkers; phosphothreonine-48-Cdc25C, phosphothreonine-67-Cdc25C, phospho-Chk1, and phospho-Chk2, cell signaling). Membranes to be probed with the phosphothreonine-48-Cdc25C antibody were blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin rather than milk. Subsequently, membranes were washed in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (BioRad). Proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (AmershamBiosciences). A previous study showed that UCN-01 can abrogate S phase arrest and enhance cytotoxicity induced by the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin (23Shao R.-G. Cao C.-X. Shimizu T. O'Connor P.M. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4029-4035PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the cell cycle perturbation induced by another topoisomerase I inhibitor, SN38, the active metabolite of irinotecan. Both MDA-MB-231 and MCF10a cells were incubated with a range of concentrations of SN38 for 24 h. A G2 arrest was observed at low concentrations, a late S arrest at higher concentrations, and an early S arrest at the highest concentrations (Fig.1, A and B,left panels). It is important to note that SN38 action is preferential to S phase cells, hence there is little G1arrest even in the p53 wild-type cells; rather, concentrations can be selected in which most of the cells accumulate in S phase.Figure 1Cell cycle perturbation in two human breast cell lines following incubation with SN38. The MDA-MB-231 (A) and MCF10a (B) cell lines were incubated with the 0–30 ng/ml SN38 for 24 h (left panel). The drug was removed, and cells were incubated for an additional 24 h in media ± nocodazole (middle panels) or 50 nm UCN-01 ± nocodazole (noc) (right panels). Cells were harvested and analyzed for cell cycle distribution by flow cytometry.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) SN38 was removed at 24 h, and the S phase-arrested MDA-MB-231 cells progressed slowly toward G2 over the following 24 h in fresh media, whereas the arrested MCF10a cells showed little progression (Fig. 1, middle panels). Evidence of cell cycle progression was confirmed by inclusion of nocodazole during this period, which arrests cells in mitosis. At all concentrations of SN38, MDA-MB-231 but not MCF10a cells reached G2/M during this time frame. The addition of 50 nm UCN-01 at 24 h caused abrogation of S and G2 arrest in MDA-MB-231 cells with many cells now exhibiting sub-G1 DNA content (Fig. 1 A,right panels). This is particularly evident in cells that had been treated at or above 3 ng/ml SN38. Microscopic analysis showed that most of these cells remained attached to the culture dish at this time and also retained viability as judged by exclusion of trypan blue, yet they exhibited a very heterogeneous size with most appearing far smaller than a normal cell. After an additional 24-h incubation, most of these cell fragments had detached from the culture dish and no longer excluded trypan blue (see below). The inclusion of nocodazole between 24 and 48 h confirmed that the UCN-01-treated cells progressed to G2/M during this period, but nocodazole prevented much of the cell fragmentation. These observations are consistent with previous reports that passage through mitosis enhances cell death induced by cisplatin (19Lee S.I. Brown M.K. Eastman A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 1713-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 21Demarcq C. Bunch R.T. Creswell D. Eastman A. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 983-993PubMed Google Scholar); further experiments addressing this point are presented below. In contrast, MCF10a cells were unaffected by the addition of UCN-01 (Fig. 1 B,right panels). This result is consistent with previous observations that checkpoint abrogation can be prevented by wild-type p53 (6Wang Q. Fan S. Eastman A. Worland P.J. Sausville E.A. O'Connor P.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1996; 88: 956-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 24Sugiyama K. Shimizu M. Akiyama T. Tamaoki T. Yamaguchi K. Takahashi R. Eastman A. Akinaga S. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 85: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). There is an additional observation in these flow cytometry profiles that requires a comment. As the concentration of SN38 increases, the peak of G2-arrested cells exhibits an apparent increase in DNA content (the peak moves from 400 to ∼480). The addition of the DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin did not prevent this increase demonstrating that it is not because of reduplication of DNA (see the following section, and data not shown). For analysis of DNA content, the DNA was stained with propidium iodide. The amount of dye that binds is not an absolute reflection of the amount of DNA in a cell but rather is dependent on the condensation state of DNA (22Darzynkiewicz Z. Traganos F. Kapuscinski J. Staiano-Coico L. Melamed M.R. Cytometry. 1984; 5: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In these cells, extensive DNA breakage caused by SN38 is thought to open up the chromatin and facilitate increased binding of the dye, and this is responsible for the apparent increase in DNA content. A 24-h incubation with 10 ng/ml SN38 caused predominantly an S phase arrest in both cell lines and was therefore used for subsequent studies. After removal of SN38 at 24 h, a range of UCN-01 concentrations was added. Cells were then harvested and analyzed for cell cycle distribution after an additional 6 or 24 h. For MDA-MB-231 cells, concentrations of UCN-01 as low as 2 nmcaused significant abrogation of S phase arrest, with most of the cells reaching G2 within 6 h (Fig.2). Above 7.5 nm UCN-01, the majority of cells had also abrogated G2 arrest by 24 h and were detected as cells with sub-G1 DNA content. Interestingly, at the highest concentration of UCN-01 (500 nm), the majority of the cells exhibit sub-G1DNA content within 6 h. To further quantify the toxicity resulting from the combination of SN38 and UCN-01, MDA-MB-231 cells were harvested and scored for viability on the basis of trypan blue exclusion. Cells incubated with 15 or 500 nm UCN-01 for 24 h in the absence of SN38 showed a slight delay in cell growth but no obvious death (Fig. 2 B). Incubation with 10 ng/ml SN38 alone caused stasis as a result of protracted G2 arrest. The addition of UCN-01 to these arrested cells caused a dramatic loss in viable cell number. However, after incubation with 15 nm UCN-01 (the 48-h time point), there was an initial increase in viable cell number. As discussed above, many of these cells were small particles resulting presumably from a lethal mitosis, and after an additional 24 h, the majority of these fragmented cells lost viability. At the higher concentration of UCN-01, this rate of death was much more rapid. The MCF10a cells were completely refractory to the effects of UCN-01 at all concentrations and remained arrested predominantly in S phase throughout the experiment. These cells remained arrested but viable for at least another 2 days (Fig. 1 B and data not shown). We have shown previously that passage through mitosis is necessary for UCN-01-mediated enhancement of cisplatin-induced cell killing (19Lee S.I. Brown M.K. Eastman A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 1713-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Results in Fig. 1 suggest that passage through mitosis also enhances cell killing induced by SN38. We performed additional experiments here to determine whether mitosis is a prerequisite for cell death after treatment of cells with SN38. Specifically, MDA-MB-231 cells were first arrested in S phase with SN38 and then at the time of addition of UCN-01, nocodazole was also added. UCN-01 (15 nm) caused significant cell death after an additional 24 h in the absence of nocodazole, but in the presence of nocodazole, the cells accumulated in G2/M (Fig.3, left panel). Hence it appears that passage through mitosis is also required for death from the combination of SN38 and low concentrations of UCN-01. The requirement for cell cycle progression was also supported by experiments in which the DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin was added. In this case, aphidicolin appeared to prevent death of cells arrested in S phase, with the dead cells resulting presumably from cells that were already in G2. Nocodazole also prevented this cell death in the presence of aphidicolin demonstrating the importance of passage through both S phase and mitosis for cell killing by UCN-01. Similar experiments were performed in MDA-MB-231 cells incubated with SN38 and 500 nm UCN-01 (Fig. 3, right panel). This drug combination induced cell death in 6 h, and this was also prevented by the addition of nocodazole. However, it should be noted that this inhibition was only transient, and most of the cells still died by 12 h in the presence of nocodazole (data not shown). We also observed that, in the presence of nocodazole, cells incubated with 500 nm UCN-01 still progressed to G2. We therefore asked whether progression through S phase was required for cell death. Incubation with aphidicolin failed to prevent cell death. When cells were incubated with both aphidicolin and nocodazole, the cells remained alive but arrested in S phase. Hence it appears that cells incubated with 500 nm UCN-01 do not need to progress to G2 prior to dying but can undergo premature mitosis directly from S phase, which leads to cell death. It has been shown previously that ML-1 leukemia cells incubated with nucleoside analogs such as gemcitabine or araC will also die without progression through the cell cycle when UCN-01 is added (25Shi Z. Azuma A. Sampath D., Li, Y.-X. Huang P. Plunkett W. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1065-1072PubMed Google Scholar). As such, this model may represent abrogation of an S → M checkpoint. We therefore investigated the effects of araC and UCN-01 in our breast cell lines. Results for MDA-MB-231 cells are shown in Fig. 4. A-24 h incubation with araC caused a dose-dependent arrest of the cells, with 1 μm arresting cells in G2, 3 μm arresting cells in S, and 10 μm arresting cells in early S/G1. This arrest was only transient as, even in the continued presence of 1 and 3 μm araC, the cells continued cycling between 24 and 30 h (probably because of inactivation of residual drug). However cells incubated in 10 μm araC remained arrested in early S/G1. UCN-01 was added at 24 h without removing araC. At 3 μm araC, 50 nm UCN-01 appeared to drive some of the G2 cells through mitosis; this is supported by the ability of nocodazole to hold the cells in G2/M. However, 50 nm UCN-01 was unable to abrogate the S/G1 arrest induced by 10 μm araC. In contrast to low concentrations, 500 nm UCN-01 caused a marked increase in death of cells incubated with 3 and 10 μm araC. This was evident within 6 h and was also inhibited by nocodazole. It is particularly evident in this experiment that the cells incubated with 10 μm araC underwent premature mitosis and died upon addition of UCN-01 without any progression through the cell cycle. Parallel experiments were performed with the MCF10a cells, but UCN-01 was ineffective at abrogating arrest or enhancing cell death (data not shown). To further explore the rapid induction of cell death, we determined the concentration of UCN-01 that, when combined with araC, was effective at killing the cells. MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with 10 μm araC for 24 h and then a range of UCN-01 concentrations was added for an additional 6 h. UCN-01 at concentrations of >125 nm caused a significant increase in cell death (Fig. 5, left panel). These concentrations are similar to those required to enhance death rapidly following incubation with SN38. Hence it is likely that a common mechanism is involved. UCN-01 was developed originally as a protein kinase C inhibitor (26Takahashi I. Asano K. Kawamoto I. Nakano H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1989; 42: 564-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar,27Takahashi I. Saitoh Y. Yoshida M. Sano H. Nakano H. Morimoto M. Tamaoki T. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1989; 42: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). To further investigate the potential role of protein kinase C in the abrogation of arrest and cell killing, we investigated the action of other protein kinase C inhibitors. We tested Go6976 up to 500 nm, GF109203X up to 5 μm, and chelerythrine chloride up to 2 μm, but there was no effect on cell cycle abrogation or cell death (Fig. 5, right panel). In addition, we tested caffeine, another well known checkpoint inhibitor. Whereas 0.5 mm caffeine abrogated S phase arrest induced by SN38 (data not shown), we found that caffeine did not abrogate araC-induced S phase arrest or induce a rapid cell death up to 5 mm. We have also synthesized a novel indolocarbazole checkpoint inhibitor, ICP-1, that abrogates SN38-induced S phase arrest at 250 nm (to be described in detail elsewhere), but it also was ineffective at abrogating araC-mediated arrest or inducing cell death up to 2.5 μm. Furthermore, none of these drugs induced rapid death after incubation of cells with SN38 (data not shown). Hence, we have not found any drug other than UCN-01 with the ability to induce rapidly death of S phase-arrested cells. The ability of UCN-01 to abrogate cell cycle arrest is thought to be mediated via its inhibition of Chk1 (9Graves P.R., Yu, L. Schwarz J.K. Gales J. Sausville E.A. O'Connor P.M. Piwinica-Worms H. J.

Translocation of Raf to membranes has been proposed to be facilitated by Ras proteins in their GTP-bound state. In this study we provide evidence that both purified B- and C-Raf kinases possess lipophilic properties and associate with phospholipid membranes. In the presence of phosphatidylserine and lipid second messengers such as phosphatidic acid and ceramides these associations were very specific with affinity constants (K D ) in the range of 0.5–50 nm. Raf association with liposomes was accompanied by displacement of 14-3-3 proteins and inhibition of Raf kinase activities. Interactions of Raf with cholesterol are of particular interest, since cholesterol has been shown to be involved, together with sphingomyelin and glycerophospholipids in the formation of specialized lipid microdomains called rafts. We demonstrate here that purified Raf proteins have moderate binding affinity for cholesterol. However, under conditions of lipid raft formation, Raf association with cholesterol (or rafts) increased dramatically. Since ceramides also support formation of rafts and interact with Raf we propose that Raf may be present at the plasma membrane in two distinct microdomains: in raft regions via association with cholesterol and ceramides and in non-raft regions due to interaction with phosphatidylserine and phosphatidic acid. At either location Raf kinase activity was inhibited by lipid binding in the absence or presence of Ras. Ras-Raf interactions with full-length C-Raf were studied both in solution and in phospholipid environment. Ras association with Raf was GTP dependent as previously demonstrated for C-Raf-RBD fragments. In the presence of liposomes the recruitment of C-Raf by reconstituted Ras-farnesyl was only marginal, since almost 70% of added C-Raf was bound by the lipids alone. Thus Ras-Raf binding in response to activation of Ras-coupled receptors may utilize Raf protein that is already present at the membrane.

The CR3 region represents the C-terminal catalytic domain, whereas CR1 contains Ras-binding domain (RBD)1 and a zinc-binding domain called cysteine reach domain (CRD). While C-Raf is a ubiquitously expressed protein with an apparent molecular weight (M r) of 72,000–74,000, B-Raf (M r 95,000) was found to be expressed preferentially in neuronal tissues and testis (3Stephens R.M.

A-Raf, the smallest member with a M r of 68,000, is limited in expression mainly to urogenital tissue. Cytosolic C-Raf exists as a 300–500 kDa large complex including heat shock and 14-3-3 proteins (5Force T. Bonventre J.V. Heidecker G. Rapp U. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 6695-6701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon stimulation of cell surface receptors, C-Raf undergoes a series of activation events at the inner side of plasma membrane mediated by Ras and 14-3-3 proteins, including dephosphorylation and phosphorylation events (1Daum G.

Cell Res. 1999; 253: 34-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar).Although Ras proteins play a crucial role in the activation of Raf the exact mechanism of Ras-Raf coupling is not completely understood. The RBD of C-Raf comprises residues 51–131 and binds directly to the so-called switch-I region of the activated Ras-GTP (8Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Scherer A. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1995; 375: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). A single point mutation in the Raf-RBD (R89L) abrogates Ras binding and blocks Raf activation (9Fabian J.R. Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Morrison D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5982-5986Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). But not only RBD is involved in the Ras-Raf binding process. The CRD of C-Raf encompassing residues 139–184 also appears to be involved, although with lower binding affinity. Moreover, the interactions between CRD and fully processed Ras proteins have been proposed to be crucial for effective C-Raf activation (10Luo Z. Diaz B. Marshall M.S. Avruch J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 11Roy S. Lane A. Yan J. McPherson R. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20139-20145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Besides the ability to interact with processed Ras proteins, C-Raf-CRD was reported to possess binding sites for 14-3-3 proteins (12Clark G.J. Drugan J.K. Rossman K.L. Carpenter J.W.

The C-Raf-CRD was further proposed to bind to phospholipids at the plasma membrane. The first evidence that C-Raf-CRD interacts with phosphatidylserine (PS) (15Ghosh S. Xie W.Q. Quest A.F.

Biochem. 1999; 198: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) was not unexpected, since C-Raf-CRD exhibits a structure very similar to the C1-domain of protein kinase C family proteins (17Hurley J.H. Misra S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 49-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 18Mott H.R. Carpenter J.W. Zhong S. Ghosh S. Bell R.M. Campbell S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8312-8317Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), although C-Raf-CRD does not bind tumor promoting phorbol esters and binds only weakly diacylglycerol (5Force T. Bonventre J.V. Heidecker G. Rapp U. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1270-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Taken together, C-Raf-CRD appears to have a complex and multifunctional role in the regulation of C-Raf kinase activity. Further investigations revealed (19Ghosh S. Strum J.C. Sciorra V.A. Daniel L. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8472-8480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) that the C-Raf kinase interacts not only with PS but also with phosphatidic acid (PA). In contrast to PS, the interaction sites for PA have been localized within the CR3 region of C-Raf kinase. Whereas the agonist-induced hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) results in PA production, the cleavage of sphingomyelin (SM) leads to generation of ceramides. Both PA and ceramide are considered to act as intracellular lipid second messengers. Interactions between ceramides and C-Raf kinases have been observed (20Huwiler A. Brunner J. Hummel R.

Doppler H. Pfizenmaier K. Mischak H. Philipp A. Kaiser C. Kolch W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 732-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).In the current study a quantitative approach for Raf associations with lipids has been performed using Biomolecular Interaction Analysis, a technology based on surface plasmon resonance, which allows monitoring of biomolecular interactions in real time. The newly developed L1-sensor chip permits capturing of intact lipid vesicles by hydrophobic residues localized on the chip surface (22Cooper M.A. Hansson A. Lofas S. Williams D.H. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 277: 196-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The vesicles captured in this way provide a chemically and physically stable environment which resembles cellular membranes.The interactions of a number of signaling molecules with the plasma membrane depend not only on their association with particular lipids: a special architecture of some lipid microdomains called rafts plays an important role in the transduction of signals. Such lipid rafts form liquid-ordered phases in the lipid bilayer and are dispersed in the bulk of a liquid–disordered phase of the plasma membrane (23Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8019) Google Scholar, 24Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2542) Google Scholar, 25Smart E.J.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5111) Google Scholar). These microdomains have been found to be highly enriched in cholesterol and sphingomyelin, making them resistant to solubilization with non-ionic detergents (for example, Triton X-100) thus yielding detergent-resistant membrane fractions (26Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5111) Google Scholar). The special features of rafts are probably due to the tight packing of highly saturated fatty acid residues in sphingolipids with cholesterol. In contrast to rafts, the non-raft regions are composed mainly of glycerophospholipids (GPLs). Depending on cell type, detergent-resistant membranes may contain caveolin, a 21–24-kDa structural protein, which appears to mediate the formation of 60–100 nm flask-shaped invaginations (caveolae), which are distinct from the much larger (250–300 nm) clathrin-coated pits (25Smart E.J. Graf G.A. McNiven M.A. Sessa W.C. Engelman J.A. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7289-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 27Anderson R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar) and may thus represent a subclass of rafts. Several other structural/integral proteins have been found to be associated with rafts, such as flotillins/reggies (28Bickel P.E. Scherer P.E. Schnitzer J.E., Oh, P. Lisanti M.P. Lodish H.F. J. Biol.

Additionally, rafts (and caveolae) are highly enriched in components that mediate signal transduction and therefore are thought to increase the efficiency and specificity of signal transduction processes. Besides glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins that associate with rafts at the extracellular side of the plasma membrane, several acylated (and non-acylated) proteins such as heterotrimeric and small G-proteins, Src kinases, eNOS, Shc, Nck, and MAPK have been found to be attached to the rafts/caveolae microdomains at the cytosolic side (25Smart E.J.

Moreover, several transmembrane receptors (tyrosine kinase receptors, heptahelical receptors, and T-cell antigen receptors) have been reported to be enriched in lipid rafts (26Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5111) Google Scholar, 33Liu P. Ying Y., Ko, Y.G. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10299-10303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Less is known about the precise association of Raf kinases with lipid rafts. Although interactions of C-Raf with raft/caveolae fractions have been observed (35Prior I.A. Harding A. Yan J. Sluimer J. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 38Mineo C. James G.L. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11930-11935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) it is still unclear whether these interactions take place with lipid components or with caveolin, which is normally present in such preparations. Because of the small size (50 nm in average) and their flat structure, the visualization of rafts, in contrast to caveolae, is very difficult and was successfully performed only by fluorescence labeling, cross-linking (clustering) of raft proteins by antibodies and photonic force microscopy measurements (26Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5111) Google Scholar, 39Pralle A. Keller P. Florin E.L. Simons K. Horber J.K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 997-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). Taken together, raft microdomains have been characterized as membrane regions consisting of a unique lipid environment and are believed to function in cellular signaling by forming platforms for individual receptor signaling complexes.In this study we examined the associations of purified and functional full-length B- and C-Raf kinases with membrane lipids, particularly with phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), PS, phosphatidylinositol (PI), PA, SM, ceramides, and cholesterol using reconstitution techniques and biosensor measurements. We report here that purified C-Raf binds tightly and specifically to PA, PS, ceramides, and cholesterol. In contrast, the association with PC, PE, PI, and SM was much less pronounced. Purified B-Raf exhibited binding properties similar to C-Raf. The interactions of C-Raf with cholesterol were examined under conditions which allow the formation of raft microdomains. In this case we monitored a significant increase of Raf association with cholesterol, indicating that raft formation potentiates Raf binding to cholesterol. In general, binding of active Raf kinases to liposomes led to a considerable decrease of kinase activity and displacement of 14-3-3 proteins. Ras-Raf interaction studies revealed that association of Raf with phospholipid vesicles containing farnesylated Ras was only marginally increased compared with vesicles without Ras. Based on these results we discuss an alternative model for Raf activation in which Raf recruitment by Ras involves primarily diffusion in the plane of the membrane.DISCUSSIONIn this report we provide evidence that purified B- and C-Raf kinases possess a high tendency for associations with phospholipid vesicles and that Raf translocation to membranes may occur by direct association with phospholipids, lipid second messengers, and cholesterol. Specific interactions have been observed with lipid vesicles containing PS, PA, or ceramides, even in the absence of activated Ras proteins, but the most effective Raf associations with liposomes were observed with cholesterol under the conditions where lipid raft formation is favored. In all instances, lipid association of Raf was accompanied by inhibition of kinase activity.Interactions of Ras Proteins with Raf KinasesThe binding of processed Ras-GTP to C-Raf occurs through two relatively independent interactions (8Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Scherer A. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1995; 375: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Whereas the coupling mechanism of Ras to Raf-RBD are understood in great detail, numerous reports have provided conflicting data with regard to the interactions of Raf-CRD with Ras. Initial studies (49Zhang X.F. Settleman J. Kyriakis J.M. Takeuchi-Suzuki E. Elledge S.J. Marshall M.S. Bruder J.T. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1993; 364: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 58Bruder J.T. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) demonstrated a considerably decreased interaction of Ras with the N-terminal part of Raf when a zinc binding cysteine at position 168 was mutated to serine. These findings have been further confirmed with full-length C-Raf expressed in mammalian cells (10Luo Z. Diaz B. Marshall M.S. Avruch J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 11Roy S. Lane A. Yan J. McPherson R. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20139-20145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) showing that Raf-CRD is not required for membrane recruitment by Ras but is critical for Raf activation.In the study presented here we compared the Ras-Raf binding properties in solution and in lipid environment. The full-length C-Raf kinase tested in solution associated with purified Ras proteins in a GTP-dependent manner, as already observed for C-Raf fragments containing RBD (43Herrmann C. Martin G.A. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2901-2905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 49Zhang X.F. Settleman J. Kyriakis J.M. Takeuchi-Suzuki E. Elledge S.J.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), but did not discriminate between farnesylated and non-farnesylated Ras and between H- and K-Ras (Fig. 2). The same was true for the interactions of the isolated RBD region of C-Raf with farnesylated and non-modified H-Ras (data not shown). The binding of Ras to C-Raf in the lipid vesicle environment was also GTP-dependent (Figs. 3 and 4), but with significantly lower binding efficacy (10–20% compared with 60–70% of coupling efficacy measured in solution). A plausible explanation for this finding might be the fact that lipids (preferentially PS and PA) bind simultaneously with Ras to Raf and compete for the same or neighboring domains, thus reducing the apparent Ras-Raf binding affinity. As shown in Fig. 4, even in the absence of Ras, C-Raf shows high binding tendency for the liposomes consisting of PC, PE, and SM. Using vesicles containing additionally PS and PA, thus mimicking the lipid composition of the inner side of native plasma membrane, C-Raf recruitment by Ras was not detectable, since almost 70% of Raf was bound to lipids in the absence of Ras. These results suggested strongly that Raf kinases might translocate to membranes in the absence of Ras and that Raf possesses a high tendency to associate with lipid environment. Therefore we investigated in more detail, using the reconstitution technique, the putative interactions of Raf kinases with lipids.Specific Associations of B- and C-Raf Kinase with PS, PA, and CeramidesEvidence that fragments of Raf proteins, particularly C-Raf-CRD, interact with phospholipids have been presented (15Ghosh S.

The amino acids in C-Raf-CRD interacting with PS have been mapped as Arg-143, Lys-144, and Lys-148, since substitution of all three basic residues to alanine resulted in a C-Raf variant that failed to interact with PS. Additionally, further interactions between Raf and membranes might occur by insertions of hydrophobic residues of C-Raf-CRD into the lipid bilayer. A similar mechanism for membrane attachment has been proposed for Rabphilin-3A, which is an effector of the Ras-related small GTPase Rab3A (17Hurley J.H. Misra S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 49-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 60Ostermeier C. Brunger A.T. Cell. 1999; 96: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Based on x-ray crystal structure, the zinc finger of Rabphilin-3A, which is closely related to the FYVE domain (a zinc-containing membrane-binding motif), was shown to penetrate the lipid membrane which might result in the optimal conformation for coupling to G-proteins (61Kerkhoff E. Rapp U.R. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2001; 41: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).PA has also been shown to interact with C-Raf (19Ghosh S. Strum J.C. Sciorra V.A. Daniel L. Bell R.M. J.

Deletion mutagenesis of C-Raf revealed that the PA-binding sites are positioned between residues 389 and 423 (19Ghosh S. Strum J.C. Sciorra V.A. Daniel L. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8472-8480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). This region contains a positively charged tetrapeptide sequence RKTR (residues 398–401), which seems to be involved in an initial electrostatic interaction with PA. Additional interactions such as association with the hydrophobic segment ILLFM (residues 405–409) might then stabilize this interaction. In vivo experiments (62Rizzo M.A. Shome K. Watkins S.C. Romero G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23911-23918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) confirmed these preliminary in vitro results. Using mutational analysis it was demonstrated that a single mutation in the putative PA-binding region of C-Raf (R398A) prevented the translocation of C-Raf to endosomal membranes, whereas disruption of Ras-Raf interaction by C-Raf mutant (R89L) did not affect agonist-dependent translocation (62Rizzo M.A. Shome K.

These results are in agreement with our findings demonstrating that both B- and C-Raf interact with PA, and support a model in which agonist-induced C-Raf recruitment to the membranes could be mediated solely by lipids such as PA and PS. With regard to Raf localization and linkage to other signaling pathways, several observations were reported recently that support the view that Raf might be associated also with intracellular vesicles and activated by alternative mechanisms. In the course of the activation and internalization of G-protein-coupled receptors, C-Raf was found to be complexed with β-arrestin and to be attached to the endosomal vesicles via clathrin-coated pits (63Daaka Y.

Interactions of ceramides with C-Raf kinase have been described (20Huwiler A. Brunner J. Hummel R. Vervoordeldonk M. Stabel S. van den Bosch H. Pfeilschifter J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Our results obtained with purified Raf kinases reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles enriched with ceramides support the findings that ceramides bind to Raf kinases. But contrary to results of Müller et al. (21Muller G. Storz P. Bourteele S. Doppler H. Pfizenmaier K. Mischak H. Philipp A. Kaiser C. Kolch W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 732-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), we observed that ceramides bind to the regulatory domain of Raf (presumably to CRD) since the BXB form of C-Raf, which corresponds to the catalytic domain, did not exhibit any binding to ceramides (Fig. 5). Taken together, our results with respect to lipid binding performed with purified and functional full-length C-Raf kinases using in vitroreconstitution assay are consistent with observations previously reported (15Ghosh S.

Secretory diarrhea may be caused by binding of heat-stable enterotoxins to the intestinal receptor guanylyl cyclase C (GCC). Activation of GCC catalyzes the formation of cGMP, initiating a signaling cascade that opens the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator chloride channel at the apical cell surface. To identify proteins that regulate the trafficking or function of GCC, we used the unique COOH terminus of GCC as the “bait” to screen a human intestinal yeast two-hybrid library. We identified a novel protein, IKEPP (intestinal andkidney-enriched PDZprotein) that associates with the COOH terminus of GCC in biochemical assays and by co-immunoprecipitation. IKEPP is expressed in the intestinal epithelium, where it is preferentially accumulated at the apical surface. The GCC-IKEPP interaction is not required for the efficient targeting of GCC to the apical cell surface. Rather, the association with IKEPP significantly inhibits heat-stable enterotoxin-mediated activation of GCC. Our findings are the first to identify a regulatory protein that associates with GCC to modulate the catalytic activity of the enzyme and provides new insights in mechanisms that regulate GCC activity in response to bacterial toxin.

STa binding to GCC increases intracellular cGMP and initiates a signaling cascade, leading to the phosphorylation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) at the apical surface of gastrointestinal epithelial cells. Phosphorylation of CFTR opens the channel, resulting in the net efflux of ions and water into the intestinal lumen. The endogenous ligands for GCC include guanylin, uroguanylin, and lymphoguanylin, which are thought to regulate ion transport in epithelial tissues (1Currie M.G. Fok K.F. Kato J. Moore R.J.

GCC is a member of a family of transmembrane proteins that includes receptors for natriuretic peptides and egg-activating peptides as well as several orphan receptors (4Wedel B. Garbers D.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 215-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). All receptor GCs with a single transmembrane domain share a common topology. There is an NH2-terminal extracellular ligand-binding domain and a large cytosolic domain composed of a kinase homology domain and a catalytic domain. Following the catalytic domain, GCC contains an extended COOH terminus of 63 amino acids (COOH-terminal extensionpeptide (CTEP)) that is not found in the natriuretic peptide receptors (5Schulz S. Green C.K. Yuen P.S. Garbers D.L. Cell. 1990; 63: 941-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The CTEP is well conserved and contains a consensus protein kinase C phosphorylation site that potentiates cGMP-mediated signaling by phorbol esters (6Wada A. Hasegawa M. Matsumoto K. Niidome T. Kawano Y. Hidaka Y. Padilla P.I. Kurazono H. Shimonishi Y. Hirayama T. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). GCC proteins lacking the 63-amino acid CTEP lose the ability to respond to STa (6Wada A. Hasegawa M. Matsumoto K. Niidome T. Kawano Y. Hidaka Y. Padilla P.I. Kurazono H. Shimonishi Y. Hirayama T.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12921-12929Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), suggesting that this unique sequence plays a role in GCC activation. Since GCC is the only receptor guanylyl cyclase localized predominately at the apical membrane of epithelial cells, CTEP may also play a role targeting the receptor to the apical cell surface. To determine whether the COOH terminus of GCC participates in protein-protein interactions that may regulate its targeting or function, we screened a human intestinal epithelial enriched yeast two-hybrid library using CTEP as “bait.” We found that GCC associates via its COOH terminus with a novel protein containing four PDZ domains. Based on its domain organization and restricted mRNA distribution, we named this protein IKEPP (intestinal andkidney enriched PDZProtein). IKEPP is accumulated at the apical membrane of human intestinal epithelial cells and associates with GCC in a cellular context. Mutagenesis studies indicate that association with PDZ proteins is not required for efficient targeting of GCC to the apical surface. Rather, the interaction of IKEPP and GCC inhibits receptor activation by STa. Thus, GCC activity may be modulated by interaction with accessory proteins, thereby providing additional means to regulate signaling via guanylyl cyclase receptors. All cDNA inserts were generated by PCR, cloned into complementary restriction endonuclease sites of the appropriate plasmids, and verified by sequencing; specific details are available upon request. A human intestinal epithelial enriched cDNA library was generated by cloning poly(dT)-primed cDNA into the HybriZAP bacteriophage λ vector followed by amplification and in vivo mass excision to generate a two-hybrid library in pAD-GAL4 (Stratagene). The yeast binding domain (BD) plasmid pPC86BD was generated by digesting the parental vectors, pPC97 (GAL4BD and LEU2) and pPC86 (GAL4AD and TRP1) (8Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), with ApaI andBamHI. These fragments were then ligated into the opposite backbone vector to give pPC86BD and pPC97AD. cDNA encoding full-length CTEP was amplified by PCR using pBS.GCC as template; the PCR products were inserted in frame to the corresponding sites in pPC86BD. The yeast strain AH109 was sequentially transformed with pPC86BD.CTEP and 20 μg of a human intestinal cDNA library as described (9Smith F.D. Oxford G.S. Milgram S.L. J. Bio. l Chem. 1999; 274: 19894-19900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). A ∼2.2-kb cDNA clone encoding a novel protein was isolated twice in the screen. After sequencing and Northern blot analysis, this clone was named IKEPP (intestinal and kidney enrichedPDZ protein). To obtain upstream coding sequences we performed 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends using Marathon-Ready Human Kidney cDNA (CLONTECH); products were cloned into pTAdv (CLONTECH) and sequenced. Human multiple tissue northern blots and a multiple expression array blot (CLONTECH) were probed with32P-labeled random-primed cDNA probe corresponding to the IKEPP 3′-untranslated region (nucleotides 1565–2120) as described (10Trotter K.W. Fraser I.D. Scott G.K. Stutts M.J. Scott J.D. Milgram S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1481-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Rabbit antisera directed against the COOH terminus of human IKEPP were generated in rabbits using residues 484–505 of IKEPP coupled with keyhole limpet cyanin as immunogen. Rabbit polyclonal antisera were also generated using His-IKEPP fusion protein as immunogen. The pET.IKEPP plasmid was transformed into BL21(DE3, pLysS) Escherichia coli and grown to the appropriate cell density at 37 °C. IKEPP expression was induced by the addition of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C and purified from the insoluble fraction. To prepare cell lysates, cultured cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (50 mm NaPO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) and isolated by scraping in ice-cold homogenization buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin. The homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h to generate soluble and particulate fractions. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce); samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore Corp.). Western blots were performed using rabbit anti-IKEPP IgG (NC368 or NC369; 1:2000) and visualized using ECL. In vitro binding assays and co-immunoprecipitations were performed as described (11Mohler P.J. Kreda S.M. Boucher R.C. Sudol M. Stutts M.J. Milgram S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 879-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation of overexpressed HA-GCC and IKEPP, COS7 cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding IKEPP and HA-GCC or HA-GCCΔ4 with FuGENE6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After 48 h, the cells were lysed in TBS (100 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mmNaCl, pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors. Mouse anti-HA or purified normal mouse IgG (2 μg) was added to the cell lysate and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected on protein G-agarose and washed extensively in TBS buffer plus 0.1% Triton X-100. Bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with HA or IKEPP antisera. Stable MCDK type II cell lines expressing HA-GCC or HA-GCCΔ4 were generated as described (10Trotter K.W. Fraser I.D. Scott G.K. Stutts M.J. Scott J.D. Milgram S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1481-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). MDCK or Caco2 cells were grown on Transwell filters (Costar) until confluent monolayers were observed, and transepithelial resistances, with filter subtraction, were greater than 1000 ohms·cm2 or 400 ohms·cm2, respectively. Immunofluorescent staining was performed as described (10Trotter K.W. Fraser I.D. Scott G.K. Stutts M.J. Scott J.D. Milgram S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1481-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 11Mohler P.J. Kreda S.M. Boucher R.C. Sudol M. Stutts M.J. Milgram S.L. J.

Sections were prepared as described previously (12Pucilowska J.B. McNaughton K.K. Mohapatra N.K. Hoyt E.C. Zimmermann E.M. Sartor R.B. Lund P.K. Am. J. Physioll. 2000; 279: G1307-G1322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), stained with rabbit anti-IKEPP IgG (NC369; diluted 1:1500), and processed using the Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Inc.); sections were counterstained with methyl green to label nuclei. COS7 cells, plated on six-well culture dishes at a density of 4 × 105 24 h prior to transfection, were incubated in FuGENE 6 as described in the instruction manual. After 48 h, the culture medium was removed, the cells were incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 100 μm isobutylmethylxanthine for 15 min, and 25 units/ml STa (Sigma) was added to each well for 20 min. The cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in 0.1 m HCl for 20 min, and collected by centrifugation at 4 °C. For dose-response curves, cells were handled as described except that 2 × 105 cells were seeded in 12-well culture dishes 24 h prior to transfection. Following transfection, STa was added to the cells at various concentrations for 30 min in the presence of 100 μm isobutylmethylxanthine. Cells were harvested, and cGMP production was measured in both the cell lysate and culture medium using a Correlate-EIA Direct Cyclic GMP Enzyme Immunoassay Kit (Assay Designs, Inc.). In an attempt to isolate GCC-interacting proteins, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify proteins that interact with the CTEP of GCC. Screening of a human epithelial enriched intestinal cDNA library yielded several potential interactors that were His+, and we further analyzed two clones that exhibited robust β-galactosidase activity. The specificity of the interaction in yeast was verified by transforming the activation domain plasmid along with the original bait, an empty bait vector, or a plasmid encoding an unrelated bait (data not shown). Sequence analysis revealed that the cDNA inserts were ∼2.4 kb and contained identical cDNA sequence with an open reading frame of 1503 nucleotides. A protein pattern search using Pfam indicated that the open reading frame encoded a protein containing four PDZ domains. The gene was mapped to a region of chromosome 11q23 when searched against the human genome draft data base. The full-length cDNA with an open reading frame of 1518 nucleotides was predicted from genomic DNA and confirmed by 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends using human kidney cDNA as template. The open reading frame predicts a protein of 505 amino acids with a theoretical molecular mass of 54.2 kilodaltons and a pI of 5.46. On Northern blots, we detected ∼2.3- and 2.5-kb messages in human kidney (Fig. 1 A), although prolonged exposures of the blots revealed that the mRNAs were also expressed in the small intestine and colon. Since GCC mRNA is abundantly expressed in the intestine (5Schulz S. Green C.K. Yuen P.S. Garbers D.L. Cell. 1990; 63: 941-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), we also probed a human expression array containing poly(A)+ RNA prepared from multiple gastrointestinal tissues. We found that mRNA was easily detected in the kidney and along the entire gastrointestinal tract, from the duodenum to the colon (Fig. 1 B). The mRNA was not detected in any other human tissue including brain, heart, skeletal muscle, or cells of hematopoietic origin (data not shown). Based on the relatively restricted distribution of the mRNA and the domain structure of the predicted protein, we named this novel protein IKEPP. A BLAST search of the nonredundant GenBankTM data base with the IKEPP protein sequence revealed that IKEPP is most closely related to PDZK1 (PDZ domain containing protein-1; also called CAP70), a protein with four PDZ domains (13Kocher O. Comella N. Gilchrist A. Pal R. Tognazzi K. Brown L.F. Knoll J.H. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 1161-1170PubMed Google Scholar, 14Wang S. Yue H. Derin R.B. Guggino W.B. Li M. Cell. 2000; 103: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). IKEPP and PDZK1 are closely related to two other human epithelial PDZ proteins, EBP50 (ezrin-radixin-moesin-bindingphosphoprotein-50; also called NHERF1) and E3KARP (NHE3kinase Aregulatory protein; also called NHERF2), which each contain two PDZ domains (Fig. 1 C) followed by a COOH-terminal domain that associates with the NH2 terminus of ezrin, radixin, and moesin to link these proteins to the actin cytoskeleton (15Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). An analysis of the sequence identity between the individual IKEPP PDZ domains and the PDZ domains of EBP50, E3KARP, and PDZK1 indicates that PDZ1 and PDZ4 of IKEPP are most unique, whereas PDZ2 and PDZ3 of IKEPP share between 30 and 50% identity with the PDZ domains of these related proteins (Fig. 1 D). Furthermore, IKEPP is probably the human orthologue of the mouse type IIa sodium/inorganic phosphate cotransporter-associated protein (Na/Pi-Cap2), since both proteins contain four tandem PDZ domains, share 77% sequence identity, and are expressed in the kidney and intestine (16Gisler S.M. Staglijar I. Traebert M. Bacic D. Biber J. Murer H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9206-9213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). PDZ domains are composed of six β sheets (βA–βF), capped by two α helices (αA and αB), which form a peptide-binding groove that interacts with, at least, the last four C-terminal amino acids of interacting proteins (17Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). In general, PDZ domains recognize peptide sequences that contain a hydrophobic residue at the extreme COOH terminus through a conserved carboxylate-binding pocket most often formed by the sequence Arg/Lys-X-X-X-Φ-Gly-Phe (where Φ represents a hydrophobic amino acid) (18Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). The carboxylate loop of PDZ domains in IKEPP, PDZK1, EBP50, and E3KARP contain the general consensus, Arg/Lys-X-X-Tyr/Phe-Gly-Phe, with the exception of IKEPP PDZ4, which possesses a Pro residue rather than the Arg/Lys (Fig. 1 D). In the carboxylate-binding pocket, the Arg/Lys residue is responsible for ordering a water molecule that interacts with the terminal carboxylate of the ligand (17Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). Therefore, the C-terminal residue(s) of proteins that associate with IKEPP PDZ4 will probably differ from the ligands recognized by PDZK1, EBP50, E3KARP, and IKEPP PDZ domains 1–3. The −2-position of the preferred peptide ligand is used to categorize the PDZ domains as class I (−2 Ser/Thr), class II (−2 hydrophobic), and a lesser defined class III, which deviate from class I and II (18Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar, 19Harris B.Z. Lim W.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3219-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Songyang Z.

The specificity of the −2 interaction is coordinated by the first residue of the second α helix of the PDZ domain (αB1) (18Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). At the αB1 position, class I PDZ domains contain a conserved His residue (17Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar, 21Karthikeyan S. Teil L. Ladias J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19683-19686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), whereas class II domains possess a hydrophobic residue (22Daniels D.L. Cohen A.R. Anderson J.M. Brünger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). To the best of our knowledge, all of the published binding partners of PDZK1, EBP50, and E3KARP, as well as the binding partners our laboratory has identified for IKEPP, contain a Ser/Thr at the −2-position of the PDZ binding motif. Based on this structural similarity, we predict that IKEPP is a member of the superfamily of class I PDZ proteins. Sequence analysis of the individual PDZ domains of IKEPP, however, reveals that IKEPP PDZ1 and PDZ4 lack the conserved His residue characteristic of class I PDZ domains. In the αB1 position, a Tyr residue (IKEPP PDZ1) has been shown to prefer ligands containing a −2 Asp residue, whereas an Asp residue (IKEPP PDZ4) interacts with peptides with a −2 Tyr (20Songyang Z. Fanning A.S., Fu, C., Xu, J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar, 23Stricker N.L.

To evaluate the subcellular distribution of IKEPP, we generated rabbit polyclonal antisera directed against the COOH-terminal 15 amino acids of human IKEPP or the recombinant full-length protein. These antisera were first tested by Western blot analysis using full-length human IKEPP generated by coupled in vitrotranscription/translation. Whereas preimmune sera did not detect proteins in the reticulocyte lysates, both antibodies reliably detected full-length IKEPP (Fig. 2 A). We further tested the specificity of our IKEPP antisera by Western blot analysis of EBP50, E3KARP, and PDZK1 and found that both IKEPP antisera specifically recognize recombinant IKEPP and do not cross-react with these related proteins (Fig. 2 A). Recombinant E3KARP contains fewer methionine residues than IKEPP, PDZK1, and EBP50 and was visualized with prolonged exposure to the PhosphorImager screen. We first examined the expression of IKEPP in cultured human cell lines and found that the protein was expressed in whole cell lysates of two intestinal epithelial cell lines, T84 and Caco2 (Fig. 2 B); much less protein was detected in an airway epithelial cell line (16HBE14o−) or in hEK293 cells. A significant fraction of the IKEPP protein was found in the particulate fraction of Caco2 and T84 cells (Fig. 2 C). We next examined the localization of IKEPP in Caco2 cells grown to confluence on Transwell filters and found IKEPP preferentially accumulated in the subapical compartment and at the apical membrane (Fig.3 A); similar results were obtained with colonic T84 cells (data not shown). In normal human ileum and colon, IKEPP was preferentially accumulated at the apical surface and was visualized in cells of the crypt and villus (Fig.3 B). GCC is also expressed at the apical surface of intestinal epithelial cells (24Nandi A. Bhandari R. Visweswariah S.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 66: 500-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, the distribution of IKEPP in human intestine is consistent with the possibility that the GCC and IKEPP associate in vivo. We further characterized the interaction between GCC and IKEPP. Since GCC terminates with the amino acid sequence STYF, a type I PDZ binding motif, we tested whether the COOH-terminal four amino acids of CTEP mediated the interaction with IKEPP. We immobilized GST, GST-CTEP full-length, or GST-CTEPΔ4 fusion proteins on glutathione-agarose beads and incubated the affinity resins with radiolabeled IKEPP. We found that IKEPP bound GST-CTEP but not GST or GST-CTEPΔ4 (Fig.4 A). We obtained similar results in overlay assays (data not shown), indicating that the last four amino acid residues (SYTF) of GCC are required for the direct association with IKEPP. IKEPP has four PDZ domains that probably bind different ligands. Therefore, we determined which IKEPP PDZ domains are capable of associating with CTEP. To do this, we generated histidine-tagged fusion proteins consisting of PDZ1, PDZ2, PDZ3, or PDZ4 of IKEPP and tested which of the radiolabeled fusion proteins associated with full-length GST-CTEP immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads. We found that radiolabeled PDZ3 bound specifically to full-length GST-CTEP, but not GST or GST-CTEPΔ4. This interaction was not detected for PDZ1, PDZ2, and PDZ4 (Fig. 4 B). Since IKEPP shares homology with EBP50, E3KARP, and PDZK1, we immobilized GST-CTEP and GST-CTEPΔ4 on glutathione-agarose beads and tested whether radiolabeled PDZK1, EBP50, or E3KARP could associate with CTEP. We found that PDZK1, but not EBP50 or E3KARP, associates with GST-CTEP in pull-down assays (Fig. 4 C). To determine whether full-length IKEPP could associate with full-length GCC, we incubated GST or GST-IKEPP with whole cell lysates prepared from cells overexpressing HA-tagged GCC (HA-GCC). HA-GCC associated with GST-IKEPP but not with GST (Fig. 4 D). GCC may be tightly associated with the subapical cytoskeleton in the intestinal epithelium (25Waldman S.A. Kuno T. Kamisaki Y. Chang L.Y. Gariepy J. O'Hanley P. Schoolnik G. Murad F. Infect. Immun. 1986; 51: 320-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is not easily solubilized from cell membranes in buffers compatible with maintaining protein-protein interactions. Therefore we used an overexpression strategy to study the association of GCC and IKEPP in nonepithelial cells. COS7 cells were transiently transfected with cDNAs encoding IKEPP plus HA-GCC or IKEPP plus HA-GCCΔ4. Cell lysates were prepared in buffers containing 1% Triton X-100, which is known to remove GCC from cell membranes in COS7 cells (5Schulz S. Green C.K. Yuen P.S. Garbers D.L. Cell. 1990; 63: 941-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), and the cell lysates were incubated with control IgG or HA antibody. We found that IKEPP was not associated with control IgG but was easily detected in HA-GCC immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4 E). Moreover, IKEPP was not found in HA immunoprecipitates from cells co-expressing HA-GCCΔ4 plus IKEPP (Fig. 4 E). Thus, we conclude that GCC and IKEPP associate in cells and that the association requires an intact GCC COOH terminus. Interaction with PDZ proteins may be involved in selectively targeting proteins to apical or basolateral cell surfaces in epithelial cells (26Kim S.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 27Brown D. Stow J.L. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 245-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 28Straight S.W. Chen L. Karnak D. Margolis B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1329-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether the COOH-terminal STYF sequence in GCC was involved in targeting the receptor to the apical cell surface. We generated stable MDCK cell lines expressing HA-GCC or HA-GCCΔ4, lacking the STYF residues that mediate interaction with PDZ proteins. Full-length HA-GCC was targeted to the apical cell surface and was not detected at the basolateral membrane (Fig.5 A). Likewise, HA-GCCΔ4 was preferentially accumulated at the apical cell surface of polarized MDCK cells (Fig. 5 A). HA-GCC and HA-GCCΔ4 were visualized at the apical membrane in nonpermeabilized cells, further suggesting that the HA-GCC and HA-GCCΔ4 proteins were on the cell surface (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that interaction with apical membrane PDZ proteins does not play a significant role in the targeting of GCC to the apical cell surface in MDCK cells. Bakre et al. recently compared the STa-induced desenstitization of GCC in intestinal epithelial cells and in transfected fibroblasts and suggested that GCC catalytic activity might be regulated by interaction with proteins selectively expressed in epithelial cells (29Bakre M.M. Ghanekar Y. Visweswariah S.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether IKEPP modulated STa-mediated activation of GCC in transfected COS7 cells that do not express significant amounts of endogenous IKEPP. Treatment of COS7 cells expressing HA-GCC with 25 units/ml STa for 20 min significantly increased intracellular cGMP, whereas cGMP was undetected in mock-transfected cells (data not shown). In cells co-expressing GCC and IKEPP, 25 units/ml STa also increased intracellular cGMP above background. cGMP levels, however, were reduced by ∼1.7-fold in cells co-expressing HA-GCC and IKEPP compared with cells transfected with HA-GCC and empty vector (Fig. 5 B). In similar experiments, intracellular cGMP levels were decreased in COS7 cells expressing GCC and IKEPP by 1.5–2.5-fold compared with cells expressing HA-GCC and empty vector following incubation with 25 units/ml STa for 10–30 min (data not shown). This cannot be explained by changes in the expression of HA-GCC in the co-transfected cells, since the receptor was easily detected in membrane fractions prepared from these cells (Fig.5 B). Since the COOH terminus of GCC mediates the interaction with IKEPP, we tested whether IKEPP expression also inhibited STa-mediated activation of HA-GCCΔ4. We observed similar levels of STa-mediated cGMP in HA-GCCΔ4 cells in the absence or presence of co-expressed IKEPP (Fig. 5 B). Therefore, we conclude that IKEPP binding may inhibit the catalytic activity of GCC and that the inhibition requires a physical interaction between the receptor and IKEPP. To begin to understand the mechanism of this inhibition, we transfected COS7 cells with HA-GCC with or without IKEPP and assayed cGMP accumulation over a range of STa concentrations. Application of STa resulted in a concentration-dependent accumulation of cGMP in cells expressing HA-GCC plus vector or HA-GCC plus IKEPP (Fig.5 C). Although we found no change in theV max of the enzyme in the presence or absence of co-expressed IKEPP, we found that IKEPP"

Evidence is accumulating to suggest that blocking NF-κB will be an effective means to treat inflammatory diseases such as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and Crohn's disease. Modulation of inflammatory diseases by blocking the action of NF-κB-dependent inflammatory mediators has been demonstrated with anti-TNFα therapies. Etanercept and Infliximab are efficacious for both rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease (2Moreland L.W. Schiff M.H. Baumgarter S.W. Tindall E.A. Fleischmann R.M. Bulpitt K.J. Weaver A.L.

NF-κB has also been shown to be important for osteoclast differentiation, leading to the suggestion that inhibitors of NF-κB may hold therapeutic potential in the treatment of osteoporosis and other bone diseases (10Iotsova V. Caamano J. Loy J. Yang Y. Lewin A. Bravo R. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1285-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation by NF-κB requires translocation of NF-κB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (1Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2929) Google Scholar, 11Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5573) Google Scholar, 12Karin M.

The translocation into the nucleus is controlled by IκBα. IκBα binds to NF-κB in the cytoplasm and masks the NF-κB nuclear localization signal. NF-κB activation is initiated by many extracellular molecules, including LPS, TNFα, and IL-1β, through binding to their respective cell surface receptors. The binding initiates a signaling cascade that leads to the activation of the IκB kinase complex containing IKKα and IKKβ. Activation of the IKK complex requires phosphorylation of two serine residues located in the “activation loop” within the kinase domain of IKKα or IKKβ. Certain mitogen-activated protein 3-kinases (MEKK1, MEKK2, MEKK3, and NF-κB inducing kinase) are capable of phosphorylating these serines in vitro and activating NF-κB in transfection experiments. The activated IKK complex phosphorylates IκBα at serines 32 and 36. The phosphorylated IκBα is subsequently polyubiquitinated at lysine 21 or 22 and degraded by the proteasome. NF-κB is then released to translocate to the nucleus and promote gene expression. The goal of our work was to block NF-κB-dependent gene expression via stabilization of the endogenous NF-κB·IκBα complex. Stabilization has been achieved in cells with mutations that prevent the phosphorylation at serines 32 and 36 (14–16), in cells with mutations that prevent the ubiquitination at lysines 21 or 22 (17, 18), or by inhibition of IκBα degradation by the proteasome (19Palombella V.J.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6896-6909Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Our approach was to target the ubiquitination of IκBα. Ubiquitination in general requires three enzymes: the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), one of the multiple E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, and a ubiquitin E3 ligase (21Hershko A. Ciechanover A.

The work described in this report was initiated prior to the identification of IKK as the IκBα kinase or SCFβTRCP as the IκBα ubiquitin ligase. Our approach utilized a phosphomimetic substrate of IκBα in which serines 32 and 36 were mutated to glutamic acid (IκBαee). We measured IκBαee ubiquitination activity to identify an active fraction in Jurkat cell lysates. The reconstituted fraction catalyzed IκBαee ubiquitination with the appropriate substrate selectivity and was used to identify inhibitors of IκBαee ubiquitination. The screening paradigm identified a number of inhibitors including Ro106-9920 that demonstrated the functional activity expected for an inhibitor of IκBα ubiquitination. With the subsequent discovery of the SCFβTRCP E3 ligase, we were able to compare its reported properties with those associated with IκBαee ubiquitination. The properties of the IκBαee E3 ubiquitin ligase in our fractions were not consistent with those of SCFβTRCP. We conclude that Ro106-9920 inhibits an uncharacterized E3 ligase activity essential for TNFα- and LPS-induced IκBα degradation and NF-κB activation. The IκBα coding sequence was cloned into the BamHI site of both the pET11 vector and the pET30 vector with an N-terminal His6 tag (NOVAGEN, Madison, WI). The pET11 IκBα was mutagenized following the USE mutagenesis method (Amersham Biosciences). The mutagenesis of serine 32 and 36 into glutamic acid (IκBαee) was obtained with the mutagenic primer 5′-C CTC GTC TTT CAT ctc GTC CAG GCC ttc GTC GTG GCG GTC GTC CAG TAG-3′ in the reverse, noncoding orientation. The mutated plasmid DNA was used as template in the PCR reaction to introduce flanking restriction sites. The resulting amplicon was digested with BspHI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and ligated to the NcoI sites of vector pET30a (Novagen). The subsequent mutagenesis of lysine 21 and 22 to arginine (IκBαeerr) was accomplished similarly with the mutagenic primer 5′-G TAG CCG CTC CcT CcT CAG CCC GTC cCG GGG GCC CTC C-3′ also in the reverse, noncoding orientation. UBCH5a and UBCH7 were PCR-amplified from a human leukemia Jurkat cell 5′ stretch cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) with the respective forward and reverse primers for UBCH5a (5′-CTA TGG ATC CCC ATG GCG CTG AAG AGG ATT C-3′ and 5′-CGC GGA TCC GGT TAC ATT GCA TAT TTC TG-3′) and UBCH7 (5′-CTA TGG ATC CCC ATG GCG GCC AGC AGG AGG CTG-3′ and 5′-AAG CGA CCT GTG GAC TAA CCG GAT CCG GCA-3′). Both E2s were cloned into theNcoI site of pET30 vector. UBCH7 was also cloned into aNcoI site of the pET11. The resulting plasmids were transformed into BL21 (DE3) competent Escherichia coli cells (Novagen) for protein expression. E. coli expressing His6-tagged proteins were lysed with a Gaulin homogenizer (APV Gaulin, Everett, MA) in 20 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol with 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mg/ml Pefabloc (Centerchem, Stamford, CT), and supernatant was filtered through a 0.2-μm filter. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA) (200 ml) were washed three times with lysis buffer minus glycerol prior to adding supernatant. After adding the supernatant to the beads, they were rocked at room temperature for 3 h, washed twice with 5 × 20 mm Tris pH 6.8, 50 mm NaCl, and centrifuged at 700 × g for 7 min. The beads were then washed with 0.1 m imidazole at room temperature for 2 h to remove contaminants. The two washing steps were repeated three times. Purified IκBαee was eluted with lysis buffer and 0.5m imidazole at 4 °C overnight and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol at 4 °C. The yield for IκBαee was 20–25 mg/liter of culture. The E3 was fractionated from Jurkat cells activated with 20 ng/ml TNFα for 5 min. The cell pellet was collected, rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 2 × 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 2 mmDTT, 1.2% IGEPAL CA-630, 5% glycerol, and protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cells were incubated on ice for 30 min and then broken by sonication. The S-100 supernatant was prepared, filtered, and bound in batch to DE52 resin (Whatman), and the protein was eluted with successive washes of 100, 250, and 500 mmKCl in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm DTT and 5% glycerol. The fractions were collected and measured for IκBαee ubiquitination activity. The active fractions were pooled, dialyzed, and loaded onto a 21.5-mm × 15-cm, 13-μm TSK gel DEAE-5PW anion exchange column (TosoHaas) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 0.05 mm DTT. The protein was eluted with a 375-ml linear KCl gradient (0–0.5m) at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. The fractions (7.5 ml) were collected and assayed for activity. Western transfer and immunoblotting to identify fractions containing E1 was performed with E1A/E1B C-terminal IgG (Calbiochem). The active fractions, excluding any fractions containing E1 enzyme, were pooled. The pooled fractions were precipitated with 40% ammonium sulfate. The pellet was resuspended and dialyzed against 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.05 mm DTT and stored at −80 °C. Neither E1 nor E2 was detected in this fraction as determined by thioester assays, and Western blots showed the absence of endogenous IκBα (data not shown). Further attempts to purify the pooled material resulted in a complete loss of activity. E. coli-expressing untagged E2 UBCH7 were sonicated in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 50 mm DTT containing 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.5 mg/ml Pefabloc and precipitated with 90% ammonium sulfate. The pellet was resolubilized in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 50 mm DTT and dialyzed to remove the ammonium sulfate. Following filtration this was loaded onto a 70-ml Q-Sepharose HP column, and E2 UBCH7 was eluted with a 0–100% 1 m NaCl gradient. The E3 fractions (20 μg) were incubated at 4 °C with purified antibody (or rabbit serum) (2 μg) and 30 μl of prewashed protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). After 24 h, the reactions were spun down at 1,500 rpm in a Sorvall H6000. The cleared E3 lysate was removed. The Sepharose beads were washed with 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline and spun again. Fifty μl of wash supernatant were removed and pooled with the corresponding cleared E3 lysate for use as E3 ligase in IκBαee ubiquitination assays. IκΒαee ubiquitination was assayed in 10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mmATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.125 μCi of 5 μm125I-ubiquitin (Amersham Biosciences), 0.2–1.0 μg of E1, 0.5–3.0 μg of E2 UBCH7, 0.5–2.0 μg of E3, and 2 μm IκBαee in 50 μl of total volume. Typically E1 and E2 were precharged with ubiquitin, ATP, and MgCl2for 20 min at 37 °C. The E3 fraction and IκBαee were added to the precharged mix to initiate the reaction. The reaction was stopped after 1 h by adding 50 μl of 25 mm DTT to cleave thioester bonds. After 10 min the reaction was diluted with 1 ml of binding buffer and a mixture of urea and iodoacetamide to a final concentration of 5.3 m and 50 mm, respectively. Suspension of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (100 μl) in 5 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, was added to the sample and shaken for 1 h at room temperature. The supernatant was removed after centrifugation, and the beads were washed (four times) with 1 ml of 1% Nonidet P-40 in 60 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9. The product was eluted with 200 μl of 1m imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, and the amount of125I-ubiquitin-IκBαee was determined in γ counter. The time resolved fluorescence assay was conducted as reported by Gan et al. 2Q.-F. Gan, C. S. Ramesha, A. Y. Mak, and D. C. Swinney, submitted for publication. Black, high binding, 96-well plates (Greiner) were coated with IκBαee (6 μg/ml, 100 μl/well) in 50 mm NaHCO3 pH 9.0, blocked with 200 μl of 1% BSA in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, washed twice with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and washed once with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5. Typically for IC50 determinations each well contained 0.2 μg of E1, 1.0 μg of E2 UBCH7, 2 μg of E3, and 9.2 μmeuropium-labeled ubiquitin in 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmDTT, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, and 1 milliunit creatine phosphokinase. The 1-h incubation at 37 °C was initiated with E3, stopped by aspiration, and washed with DELFIA wash buffer four times (EG & G Wallac). The europium signal was measured using a Victor 1420 Multilabel Counter (EG & G Wallac) following the addition of 100 μl of the enhancement solution (EG & G Wallac). The reactions were preincubated for 15 min at room temperature in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 0.8 μg of E1, 5 μg of His6-tagged E2 UBCH7, 2 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 unit of pyrophosphatase, and test compound in a final volume of 50 μl. The reactions were started with 0.125 μCi of125I-ubiquitin and 4 μm ubiquitin and stopped after 20 min with 7.5 m urea (50 μl). The125I-ubiquitin-(E2-His6)-thioesters were bound to nickel beads, washed, and counted as above. Nonspecific ubiquitination was measured as the formation of ubiquitin conjugates from the S-100 fraction of Jurkat cell lysate. Jurkat S100 lysate (5 μg) was combined with 0.8 μg of E1, 5 μg of E2 UBCH7, 2 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 unit of pyrophosphatase in a total volume of 50 μl of 10 mmHepes buffer, pH 7.5, and preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The assay was then started by the addition of 4 μm, 0.125 μCi of 125I-ubiquitin. Following 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped with 50 μl of Laemmli SDS sample buffer, and the samples were electrophoresed on 10% Tris-Glycine gels (Novex) and visualized with autoradiography. Mononuclear cells were isolated from the fresh venous blood of human volunteers. The cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended at 1–1.5 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin G and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. The cells were plated at 1 ml/well in 12-well plates and allowed to adhere for 90 min at 37 °C. The wells were then washed twice to remove nonadherent cells, before the addition of 1.5 ml of medium (RPMI 1640 containing 100 units/ml penicillin G and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate and 10% fetal calf serum) with or without various concentrations of the test compounds or solvent control (Me2SO). After 30 min, LPS was added to a final concentration of 1 ng/ml, and the cultures were incubated for an additional 3 h. The medium was then collected and frozen at −70 °C. Cytokine levels in the medium were subsequently measured using ELISA kits from PharMingen (San Diego, CA) (human TNFα and IL-6) and R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) (human IL-1β and IL-1ra). Compound cytotoxicity was assessed in parallel cultures, plated in 96-well dishes (100 μl/well), by the addition of 100 μl of a solution of 4 μm propidium iodide (Molecular Probes) in phosphate-buffered saline to the cells at the end of the assay. The culture plates were read in a fluorescence plate reader; increases in the signal correlated with propidium-DNA interactions, an indication that the cytoplasmic membrane was no longer intact. MM6 cells (1.5 × 106) were preincubated for 30 min with the inhibitor at 37 °C. The reaction was started by the addition of 10 μg/ml cycloheximide in Me2SO and 20 ng/ml TNFα (Promega). Following a 1-h incubation the cells were separated from the medium, resuspended in RIPA buffer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and broken by freezing and thawing three times at −80 °C. After centrifugation the supernatants were electrophoresed on 10% Tris-glycine gels, and the proteins were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose paper. The Western blots were probed with a mouse antibody to IκBα (C-21, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and detected with rabbit anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate. Jurkat cells were incubated at 37 °C with inhibitors for 24 h and then were washed, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and complete protease inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)), frozen, and thawed three times, and the supernatant was analyzed for β-catenin by ELISA. β-Catenin was captured with a mouse anti-β-catenin antibody diluted 1:400 (Zymed Lab, 13–8400) and detected with a rabbit anti-β-catenin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-7199) diluted 1:1250, coupled to streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (PharMingen). Hanover Wistar rats (Charles River Laboratories, Hollister, CA) were acclimated for 1 week prior to the initiation of experiments, at which time they weighed ∼165–205 g (males) or 90–120 g (females). Ro106-9920 was suspended in vehicle containing 0.9% NaCl, 0.5% sodium carboxylmethylcellulose (type 7L; Aqualon, Wilmington, DE), 0.4% polysorbate 80, and 0.9% benzyl alcohol. Carrageenan air pouches were created by the subcutaneous injection of air as described (29Edwards J.C.W. Sedgwick A.D. Willoughby D.A. J. Pathol. 1981; 134: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), with slight modifications. Briefly, male rats were anesthetized with a 60:40 mixture of CO2:O2, and 20 ml of sterile air was injected into the intracapsular area of the back on day −6. On day −3, the pouches were reinjected with 10 ml of sterile air to maintain the integrity of the pouch without inducing further tissue damage. Inflammation was induced on day 0 with 5 ml of 0.5% carrageenan (Type IV Lambda; Sigma) reconstituted and diluted in sterile, pyrogen-free 0.9% NaCl administered directly into the pouch. Vehicle or Ro106-9920 was orally administered at the time of the induction of inflammation. The rats were euthanized 3 h after induction of inflammation. Individual pouches were lavaged with 10 ml of solution containing 5.4 mm EDTA and 10 μg/ml indomethacin in 0.9% sterile saline, 0.1% Me2SO. The cells in the exudate were pelleted by centrifugation. The supernatants were frozen at −80 °C until analysis with ELISA kits from BIOSOURCE International (Camarillo, CA) for rat TNFα or PerSeptive Biosystems, Inc. (Framingham, MA) for prostaglandin E2. Female rats were challenged intraperitoneally with 50 μg/kg E. coli LPS (L3129, Sigma) to induce systemic inflammation and euthanized 1.5 h later. Vehicle or Ro106-9920 was orally administered 30 min prior to LPS challenge. After euthanasia, the blood was harvested via cardiocentesis, and the serum was isolated using serum separator tubes. The serum was stored frozen at −80 °C until ELISA analysis. E1 was purified from rabbit liver according to the method of Haas and Bright (30Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13258-13267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylated peptide was synthesized by reported procedures (31Kitas E.A. Knorr R. Trzeciak A. Bannwarth W. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1991; 74: 1314-1328Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 32Bannwarth W. Küng E. Vorherr T. Bioorganic Med. Chem. Lett. 1996; 6: 2141-2146Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (Pierce). The antibodies used in this work were NEMO (sc-8330), SKP-1 (sc-7163), cIAP2 (sc-7944), IKKβ (sc-7607), and βTRCP (sc-8862) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); cullin-1 (rb-042) from Neomarkers (Fremont, CA); cdc34 from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA); and nedd8 (210–194-R200) and sentrin (210–174-R200) from Alexis (San Diego, CA). Anti-rabbit βTRCP was custom prepared by Multiple Peptide Systems (San Diego, CA) to a peptide from the middle of the protein (CYDDQKIVSGLRDNTIKIWD). The first step in efforts to discover inhibitors of IκBα ubiquitination was to develop a screening assay suitable to identify leads. IκBα ubiquitination requires phosphorylation of serines 32 and 36 and ubiquitination at lysine 21 or 22 (17, 18, 33). To circumvent the need for phosphorylation, we engineered a protein in which serines 32 and 36 were mutated to glutamic acid. This protein was expressed with an N-terminal His6 tag, purified from E. coli and used in the presence of ATP, ubiquitin, rabbit E1, and human E2UBCH7 to screen protein fractions for an activity that would catalyze the formation of IκBαee-ubiquitin conjugates. Jurkat cells were treated with TNFα for 5 min to degrade endogenous IκBα and lysed, and the S100 supernatant was fractionated over DE52 and DEAE. The activity eluted from the DEAE column in a sharp peak at ∼0.22 m KCl (Fig.1), immediately following E1. Western blots were run prior to pooling to ensure that E1 did not contaminate the fractions containing the E3 activity. The fractions from each peak were pooled and precipitated with 40% ammonium sulfate. Thioester assays showed that there were no detectable E1 or E2s in the final E3 fraction. Western blots showed the absence of endogenous IκBα (data not shown). Further attempts to purify the pooled activity resulted in a complete loss of activity. Validation of an IκBα ubiquitination enzyme assay requires a dependence upon phosphorylation of serines 32 and 36, ubiquitination at lysine 21 or 22, and the formation of polyubiquitin chains (17Baldi L.

Neither wtIκBα nor IκBαeerr were as efficient ubiquitination substrates for this system as IκBαee (Table I). However, both wtIκBα and IκBαeerr were inhibitors of IκBαee ubiquitination with IC50 values of 3.0 and 0.6 μm, respectively.Table ISubstrate specificitySubstrateRate of formation1-aThe rate of formation of ubiquitinated products in the nickel bead assay following 1 h of incubation at 37 °C.IC501-bInhibition of IκBαee ubiquitination.2 μm substrate5 μm substrate nmol/mg/h μmIκBαee24.130.9wtIκBα5.17.63.0IκBαeerr5.43.00.6No substrate1.21-a The rate of formation of ubiquitinated products in the nickel bead assay following 1 h of incubation at 37 °C.1-b Inhibition of IκBαee ubiquitination.

Using the murine mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-Wnt-1 transgenic model of mammary carcinoma, we have identified an unvarying association between β-catenin and epidermal growth factor receptor/c-Neu (ErbB1/ErbB2) heterodimers in mammary gland tumors, indicating a requirement for ErbB signaling in Wnt-mediated tumorigenesis. Expansion of these observations to a second transgenic model, MMTV-c-Neu, demonstrated similar tumor-specific interactions, including an ErbB1 ligand-inducible phosphorylation of both β-catenin and c-Neu. Direct relevance of these findings to human breast cancer was established upon examination of a set of human infiltrating ductal breast adenocarcinoma and lymph node metastasis tissues taken at surgery. These data revealed increased levels of β-catenin in tumors and metastases versus normal breast as well as an association between β-catenin and c-Neu that measurably occurs only in neoplasia, most strongly in metastatic lesions. These studies have identified a seemingly indispensable interaction between β-catenin and epidermal growth factor receptor/c-Neu heterodimers in Wnt-1-mediated breast tumorigenesis that may indicate a fundamental signaling event in human metastatic progression.

Neoplasia. 1997; 2: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The ErbB receptors are activated by the binding of cognate ligands, resulting in homo- and heterodimer receptor formation and subsequent phosphorylation of a wide variety of cellular substrates (i.e.mitogen-activated protein kinase, signal transducers and activators of transcription, phospholipase Cγ, c-src, etc. (4Alroy I. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar)), most often leading to increased cellular mitogenesis.

Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3915-3927PubMed Google Scholar). One such study utilized insertional mutagenesis of the WAP-transforming growth factor α (TGFα) model to identify genes able to synergize with EGFR activation in tumor progression (9Schroeder J.A. Troyer K.L. Lee D.C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3193-3199Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These studies resulted in the observation that Wnt-1 and Wnt-3 are up-regulated in this model of ErbB-induced tumorigenesis, indicating that these pathways may cooperate during transformation. The Wnts are a family of secreted proteins whose overexpression results in the accumulation of β-catenin, a protein involved in both cellular adhesion (as a critical component of the E-cadherin-actin complex found at adherens junctions) and oncogenesis (10Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ben-Ze'ev A. Shtutman M. Zhurinsky J. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Binding of the soluble Wnt protein to the Frizzled receptor results in the inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β, which normally phosphorylates excess β-catenin and causes its ubiquitination and degradation (10Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,12Papkoff J. Rubinfeld B. Schryver B. Polakis P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2128-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Wnt signaling-induced inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β results in the loss of this regulating mechanism, causing an accumulation of β-catenin. This increased pool of β-catenin can translocate to the nucleus, where it functions as a transcriptional coactivator of LEF/TCF transcription factors, resulting in the transcription of the protooncogenes c-myc and cyclin D1, among others (13He T.C.

Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (3253) Google Scholar). Importantly, in vitro studies have shown that the ErbB receptors can induce a tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin (16Hazan R.B. Norton L. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1996; 13: 883-889PubMed Google Scholar), which can prevent the binding of β-catenin to E-cadherin, potentially shifting β-catenin to the oncogenic pathway (18Piedra J. Martinez D.

In fact, tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin can result in enhanced invasion and metastasis in breast cancer and melanoma cell lines (16Hazan R.B. Norton L. J. Biol.

Leder P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5093-5099Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) transgenic mice resulted in similar phenotypes, including the stochastic development of unifocal, nonmetastatic mammary gland adenocarcinomas. Additionally, MMTV-β-cateninΔN transgenics display increased expression of c-myc and cyclin D1 (21Michaelson J.S. Leder P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5093-5099Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that the mechanism of Wnt-induced mammary carcinoma is indeed through the accumulation of β-catenin. Recent evidence suggests that β-catenin may play a pivotal role in the development and diagnosis of human breast cancer (22Lin S.Y. Xia W. Wang J.C. Kwong K.Y. Spohn B. Wen Y. Pestell R.G. Hung M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4262-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Translocation of β-catenin from the adherens junction to the cytoplasm and nucleus correlates significantly with poor patient outcome (22Lin S.Y. Xia W. Wang J.C. Kwong K.Y. Spohn B. Wen Y.

EGFR-induced tumor formation in the mammary gland is promoted by cooperative events with Wnt-mediated signaling, since both Wnt-1 and Wnt-3 were found to be up-regulated in tumor samples from WAP-TGFα transgenic animals (9Schroeder J.A. Troyer K.L. Lee D.C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3193-3199Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To directly examine the role of EGFR signaling in Wnt-1-mediated tumorigenesis, we utilized the MMTV-Wnt-1 transgenic mouse (19Tsukamoto A.S. Grosschedl R. Guzman R.C. Parslow T. Varmus H.E. Cell. 1988; 55: 619-625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). In this transgenic model, overexpression of the soluble Wnt-1 glycoprotein results in the accumulation of β-catenin in the mammary gland, leading to hyperplasia and the stochastic formation of nonmetastatic, unifocal adenocarcinoma (20Li Y. Hively W.P. Varmus H.E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1002-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Separate studies have demonstrated that the transforming event is probably due solely to this accumulation of β-catenin (21Michaelson J.S. Leder P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5093-5099Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Analysis of the β-catenin protein in the hyperplastic mammary glands (all nontumor mammary glands in this model are hyperplastic but will hereafter be referred to as normal) and corresponding tumors of MMTV-Wnt-1 mice revealed two species of β-catenin protein in the normal mammary gland lysates of ∼95 and 97 kDa, respectively. Interestingly, mainly the larger form (with retarded mobility in the SDS-PAGE) was observed in the tumors (Fig.1 A). To determine the tyrosine phosphorylation status of β-catenin, we analyzed a set of tumor and mammary gland lysates using an enhanced anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (RC20-HRP; see “Materials and Methods”) and a highly sensitive chemiluminescent substrate (West Dura extended duration; see “Materials and Methods”), capable of detecting the low level of endogenous phosphorylation present in whole tissue lysates. We detected a single phosphoprotein that comigrated with the larger form of β-catenin in both the tumor and mammary gland (Fig. 1 B, closed arrow). Since the major species identified in the tumors was the larger phosphorylated form, this indicated that a kinase was preferentially associated with β-catenin in the tumors, as opposed to the normal gland. Interestingly, we detected a phosphoprotein of ∼180 kDa coimmunoprecipitating with β-catenin (Fig. 1 B,arrowhead), which is the size range of the ErbB receptor kinases. Previous studies have demonstrated a functional relationship between β-catenin and EGFR in tumor progression (9Schroeder J.A. Troyer K.L. Lee D.C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3193-3199Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 16Hazan R.B. Norton L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9078-9084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed our tumor and mammary gland samples to determine if the 180-kDa kinase we had detected immunoprecipitating with β-catenin (Fig. 1) was in fact EGFR. Upon analysis of more than 25 independent mammary gland tumors from MMTV-Wnt-1 transgenics, we found that EGFR and β-catenin interacted in 100% of the tumors (Fig.2). Conversely, we detected minimal amounts of β-catenin coimmunoprecipitating with EGFR in the normal mammary glands taken from the same animal as the tumor (Fig. 2). Through analysis of the endogenous kinase activity of EGFR as determined by EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, we detected variable phosphorylation of the EGFR in tumors where EGFR and β-catenin were interacting (Fig. 2 B, top panel). This indicated that β-catenin phosphorylation (Fig. 1 B) was not due solely to EGFR kinase activity and may be the result of an interaction with one or more of the other ErbB members. We investigated the interaction between β-catenin and c-Neu (ErbB2/Her2) in MMTV-Wnt-1 transgenics, since in vitro studies have shown that c-Neu and β-catenin associate in stomach adenocarcinoma cell lines (24Bonvini P., An, W.G.

Hirohashi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 1067-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Similar to that observed with EGFR, we found a complete concordance of c-Neu interacting with β-catenin in all tumors. In contrast, c-Neu/β-catenin associations could not be detected in the normal MMTV-Wnt-1 mammary glands (Fig.3 A). Importantly, almost no c-Neu expression was detected in the normal glands, indicating a dramatic up-regulation of c-Neu in the tumors.Figure 3β-Catenin-EGFR-c-Neu complex formation in MMTV-Wnt-1 and MMTV-c-Neu tumors. A, MMTV-Wnt-1 protein lysates (1 mg) from both normal (N) and mammary gland tumors (T) were immunoprecipitated (IP) with either anti-c-Neu antibody (top three panels) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or goat-anti-β-catenin (bottom panel). Membranes were immunoblotted (IB) with either rabbit anti-β-catenin (top and bottom panels), anti-c-Neu antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (middle top panel), or anti-phosphotyrosine (RC20-HRP) (middle bottom panel). B, immunoprecipitations (1 mg) and immunoblotting for MMTV-c-Neu transgenic animals were performed as described for A. Endogenous phosphorylation was detected using West Dura extended duration chemiluminescent substrate and exposed for 30 s and 1 min, respectively. Normal mammary glands and tumors from a single animal are bracketed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the interaction between the ErbB receptors and β-catenin is a common mechanism or unique to the MMTV-Wnt-1 model, we investigated a second established model of mammary carcinoma, MMTV-c-Neu (5Guy C.T. Webster M.A. Schaller M. Parsons T.J. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10578-10582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). In this model, overexpression of unactivated rat ErbB2/c-Neu protein results in the stochastic formation of metastatic (pulmonary), unifocal mammary gland adenocarcinomas (5Guy C.T. Webster M.A. Schaller M. Parsons T.J. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10578-10582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). Analysis of this model revealed that while complex formation occurred between phosphorylated c-Neu and phosphorylated β-catenin in MMTV-c-Neu tumors, only ∼50% of the samples displayed the interaction (5 of 11) (Fig. 3 B and data not shown). Therefore, whereas Wnt-1/β-catenin-mediated tumorigenesis always appears to involve ErbB receptors, ErbB-induced tumorigenesis apparently does not always involve β-catenin. Interestingly, all five of the MMTV-c-Neu mice displaying β-catenin-c-Neu complexes in the tumors also had pulmonary metastases, while only two of six of the negative tumors did. This may indicate a correlation between β-catenin-ErbB complex formation and metastasis. We also detected interactions between ErbB3 and ErbB4 and β-catenin in the MMTV-Wnt-1 mammary glands but only in those tumors where exceptionally high levels of β-catenin were present, since overall levels of both ErbB3 and ErbB4 were low in both the tumors and the normal glands (data not shown). Perhaps the interaction between β-catenin and the ErbB receptors is hierarchical in nature, and the preferred interaction is with EGFR/c-Neu heterodimers and next with ErbB3 and ErbB4, as has been previously proposed regarding receptor heterodimerization (27Graus-Porta D. Beerli R.R. Daly J.M. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1647-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar, 28Schroeder J.A. Lee D.C. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 451-464PubMed Google Scholar). To verify that the tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin was due to EGFR kinase activity, we injected tumor-bearing mice with the following EGFR-specific ligands: receptor grade epidermal growth factor (EGF), TGFα, or amphiregulin. It has been previously shown that EGF injection into mice induces EGFR kinase activation as well as transphosphorylation of dimerizing ErbB partners and subsequent phosphorylation of interacting proteins (25Schroeder J.A. Thompson M.C. Gardner M.M. Gendler S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13057-13064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 28Schroeder J.A. Lee D.C. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 451-464PubMed Google Scholar). All three ligands induced tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin in tumors from both MMTV-Wnt-1 and MMTV-c-Neu transgenic animals (Fig.4 A). In contrast, only minimal phosphorylation was observed in the normal gland during exogenous ligand stimulation. It should be noted that the analysis of protein phosphorylation from animals injected with EGFR ligands was performed with West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (see “Materials and Methods”), a detection method not sensitive enough to detect endogenous phosphorylation (as it was utilized in these studies). This dramatic induction of β-catenin phosphorylation detected in tumors from both MMTV-Wnt-1 and MMTV-c-Neu transgenic animals provides further evidence that the interaction between EGFR/c-Neu and β-catenin is tumor-specific. To determine whether the phosphorylation of c-Neu and its association with β-catenin was due to a heterodimer formation with EGFR, similar transphosphorylation experiments were performed using EGF injections in both MMTV-Wnt-1 and MMTV-c-Neu mice. Injection of the cognate ligand for EGFR resulted in the phosphorylation of c-Neu in addition to EGFR, indicating heterodimer formation between these two receptor kinases (Fig. 4 B). Note that treatment with EGF resulted in greatly increased phosphorylation of both EGFR and c-Neu receptor compared with endogenous phosphorylation of these receptors, since endogenous phosphorylation was undetectable using the Pico chemiluminescent substrate (see Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). Collectively, these data demonstrate that an EGFR/c-Neu heterodimer induces β-catenin phosphorylation specifically in tumors. Despite the fact that MMTV-Wnt-1 normal mammary glands are hyperplastic, EGF-induced phosphorylation of β-catenin is difficult to detect in those tissues, suggesting this signaling complex is important primarily in carcinoma. Furthermore, these findings indicate that EGFR and c-Neu are constitutive components of Wnt-1-mediated tumorigenesis. To determine the frequency of these interactions in human breast cancer, we analyzed normal breast, breast-infiltrating ductal adenocarcinomas, and axillary lymph node metastases for overall β-catenin expression and the frequency of interactions occurring between β-catenin and members of the ErbB receptor family. Tissues were prepared directly after surgery from surgical pathology samples obtained during lumpectomy or mastectomy, and lysates were produced. Immunoblot analysis revealed increasing amounts of β-catenin protein with advancing levels of invasiveness, although in two of four samples analyzed, levels were similar in both the tumor and metastasis (Fig.5, A and B,bottom panels). Our attempts to determine levels of β-catenin phosphorylation levels were unsuccessful, largely due to nonspecific contamination that masked proteins around 97 kDa in size, including β-catenin (although different anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies were attempted). Fortunately, we were able to detect tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of ∼180 kDa coimmunoprecipitating with β-catenin in the metastatic samples (Fig. 5 B,fourth panel, and data not shown). Analysis of EGFR-β-catenin coimmunoprecipitation complexes revealed that interactions between the two proteins occur in all samples, with variable increases in the tumors and metastases (Fig. 5 A, and data not shown; total samples analyzed: metastases,n = 4; tumors, n = 5; and normal,n = 5). Since the expression of EGFR itself was highly variable from patient to patient and was frequently highest in the normal breast (data not shown), it is difficult to ascertain whether interactions between β-catenin and EGFR were higher in one tissue type over another. Upon examination of c-Neu protein, we commonly observed an increase in expression in the primary and metastatic tumor versus the normal breast (Fig. 5, B and C). Examination of c-Neu immunoprecipitations revealed β-catenin association in the primary tumor and metastasis, with the strongest interaction occurring in the metastatic lesion (Fig. 5 B, total samples analyzed: metastases, n = 5; tumors, n = 8; and normal, n = 10). This observation was true even in patients where c-Neu and β-catenin expression levels were equal in both tumor and lymph node (Fig. 5, B and C, samples HB014 and HB006 and data not shown). These data indicate that c-Neu is the ErbB kinase specifically complexed with β-catenin in invasive human breast cancer. As the interaction between c-Neu and β-catenin in the MMTV-c-Neu mice occurs only in those animals with pulmonary metastases (see above section), a compelling argument can be made for these protein interactions correlating with invasive disease. It is interesting to note also that the majority of our patient samples (9 of 10) were graded pathologically as HER2/Neu-negative (TableI). The primary tumors from each patient were graded using the DAKO HercepTest and graded 0 or 1+ (only 2+ or 3+ is considered positive for HER2/Neu expression), whereas immunoprecipitation of c-Neu and immunoblotting allowed for readily detectable HER2/Neu protein expression in most (5 of 9) of these samples (Fig. 5 C and data not shown). Importantly, analysis of endogenous phosphorylation of the c-Neu protein present in these tumors demonstrated activated receptor, indicating that the protein present is in fact functional (Fig. 5 C, top panel). Further, in each clinically HER2/Neu-negative case with an associated lymph node metastasis (n = 4), the c-Neu in the metastatic lesion is hyperphosphorylated compared with the primary tumor, as can be ascertained by the increased retardation of the phosphorylated species in the acrylamide gel (Fig. 5 C,top panel, LN). This may indicate an increased activity in the metastasis versus the primary tumor. It is interesting to note that in our single HER2/Neu clinically positive patient (HB014), both the primary tumor and the lymph node metastasis were hyperphosphorylated.Table IPatient characteristicsID no.Stage at diagnosisStage at surgeryPatient age at surgeryModified Bloom-RichardsonTypeHER2/neuEstrogen receptor/ progesterone receptorLymph nodes obtained for studyMetastatic carcinomaHB0011-aSee Fig. 6.22B413Infiltrating ductal carcinomaNegativePositive/negativeYes8 of 23 lymph nodesHB00233513Infiltrating ductal carcinomaNegativeNegativeYes7 of 7 lymph nodesHB0031-bLymph node not available for study.22851Infiltrating ductal carcinomaNegativePositiveNo1 of 14 lymph nodesHB0051-cMolecular data not shown.44543Infiltrating ductal carcinomaNegativeNegativeYes7 of 7 lymph nodes lung, liverHB00622582Infiltrating ductal carcinomaNegativePositiveYes1 of 14 lymph nodesHB00711693Infiltrating ductal carcinomaNegativeNegativeNoNegativeHB00822703Infiltrating ductal carcinomaNegativePositiveYes4 of 16 lymph nodesHB0091-cMolecular data not shown.22522Infiltrating ductal carcinomaNegativeNegativeNo0 of 21 lymph nodesHB0101-dNo β-catenin expression in lymph node.44683Infiltrating lobular carcinomaNegativePositive/negativeYes9 of 16 lymph nodesHB01122592Infiltrating lobular carcinomaNegativePositiveNo0 of 13 lymph nodesHB01433a773Infiltrating ductal carcinomaPositivePositive/negativeYes8 of 16 lymph nodes1-a See Fig. 6.1-b Lymph node not available for study.1-c Molecular data not shown.1-d No β-catenin expression in lymph node. Open table in a new tab Previous reports suggest that cytoplasmic/nuclear β-catenin expression is an “activated” phenotype and correlates with a poor patient prognosis (22Lin S.Y. Xia W. Wang J.C.

To determine the site of β-catenin/ErbB interactions in our patient samples, we used confocal microscopy to analyze both tumors and normal glands. In human and MMTV-Wnt-1 breast tumors, β-catenin was detected in the membrane and cytoplasm, indicating a similarity between the transgenic model and human disease. Substantial colocalization of the ErbB receptors with β-catenin was observed in human, MMTV-Wnt-1, and MMTV-c-Neu primary tumors and human lymph node metastases. Colocalization of both EGFR and c-Neu with β-catenin in the tumor samples from MMTV-c-Neu appeared to occur in close proximity to the membrane (Fig. 6, F andH), whereas human and MMTV-Wnt-1 colocalization was present throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 6, A, B, andD). In contrast, very limited colocalization was detected in the normal mammary glands (Fig. 6, C and G), with the exception of EGFR/β-catenin in MMTV-c-Neu, where colocalization was observed in some of the normal glands (Fig. 6 E). These data demonstrate that interactions between β-catenin and EGFR and c-Neu do occur in the cytoplasm, similar to where β-catenin is found to be localized in the activated phenotype observed by other groups (22Lin S.Y. Xia W. Wang J.C. Kwong K.Y. Spohn B. Wen Y. Pestell R.G. Hung M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4262-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). We have discovered a strikingly common association between EGFR/c-Neu and β-catenin that is highly restricted to tumors of the mouse mammary gland and results in the tumor-specific phosphorylation of β-catenin. Remarkably, these results correspond closely with human breast cancer, since c-Neu and β-catenin form a complex in invasive breast cancer. Numerous reports indicate that under certain growth conditions, both a normal mammary gland cell line (29Takahashi K. Suzuki K. Tsukatani Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and carcinoma cell lines (16Hazan R.B. Norton L. J. Biol.

This interaction can result in a loss of adherens junction formation and an increase in cellular invasion. This is the first report to demonstrate that these interactions occur in vivo and are unique to the transformed breast. Importantly, through analysis of these multiple models, we can hypothesize a paradigm of ErbB-induced β-catenin phosphorylation that results in β-catenin deregulation and progression to invasive breast cancer. The MMTV-Wnt-1 transgenic model induces the overexpression/accumulation of β-catenin in the mouse mammary gland, resulting in the formation of unifocal, stochastic adenocarcinomas (19Tsukamoto A.S. Grosschedl R. Guzman R.C. Parslow T. Varmus H.E. Cell. 1988; 55: 619-625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 20Li Y. Hively W.P. Varmus H.E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1002-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). One primary reported mechanism of β-catenin-induced tumorigenesis is translocation to the nucleus wherein β-catenin functions as a transcriptional co-factor and increases the production of such oncogenes as c-myc and cyclin D1 (13He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H. Zawel L. da Costa L.T. Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1998; 281: 1509-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (4075) Google Scholar, 14Shtutman M. Zhurinsky J.

Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (3253) Google Scholar). In the four patients and the MMTV-c-Neu transgenic animals analyzed for β-catenin/c-Neu colocalization, β-catenin was not observed in the nucleus. No colocalization of β-catenin with EGFR or c-Neu was seen in the nucleus of the MMTV-Wnt-1 transgenics either but instead was observed in the cytoplasm and at the cell membrane. One previously reported result of the association of β-catenin with the ErbB transmembrane kinases is to induce a separation of β-catenin from E-cadherin (16Hazan R.B. Norton L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9078-9084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Analysis of the soluble fraction of tumor and normal lysates demonstrated no disruption of β-catenin/E-cadherin association in the MMTV-Wnt-1 transgenic tumors (data not shown). Therefore, these interactions may be occurring in the presence of intact β-catenin/E-cadherin binding, a phenomenon previously demonstrated in inflammatory breast carcinoma wherein the invasive cell line MARY-X has intact E-cadherin/β-catenin binding at the adherens junctions (30Tomlinson J.S. Alpaugh M.L. Barsky S.H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5231-5241PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, the β-catenin-ErbB complex may include other, as yet unidentified, proteins, which promote tumorigenesis through β-catenin relocalization and interaction. Preliminary data in our laboratory indicate that at least one other protein may be involved in the complex, the tumor antigen MUC1 (data not shown), and these interactions are currently being pursued. In addition, the actin-bundling protein fascin both is up-regulated by ErbB2 expression and interacts with β-catenin at the cell membrane, since its overexpression can result in the induction of cell motility (31Yamashiro S. Yamakita Y. Ono S. Matsumura F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 993-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 32Tao Y.S. Edwards R.A. Tubb B. Wang S. Bryan J. McCrea P.D. J.

Cancer. 2000; 83: 870-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Therefore, fascin may also be a potential candidate for interacting with alternatively regulated β-catenin, and these possible interactions are currently being investigated. Interestingly, clinical analysis using the HercepTest has graded eight of nine of the primary tumors in this study HER2/Neu-negative for the purposes of adjuvant therapy (Table I; Dako HercepTest score of 0 or 1+). Conversely, immunoblot and immunofluorescent analysis revealed readily detectable levels of HER2/Neu in most (five of nine) of these same tumors, indicating that our methodology is more sensitive than what is performed clinically. Anti-HER2/Neu therapy (Trastuzumab and Herceptin, Genentech, San Francisco, CA) is focused on treating those patients whose biopsies indicate HER2/Neu overexpression. Our data may indicate that it is not merely the level of HER2/Neu or EGFR expression that is pertinent to cancer progression but also the appropriation of the function of proteins responsible for cell adhesion, such as β-catenin. Whereas most of the tumors in this study were clinically classified as Her2/Neu-negative, the c-Neu receptor in these tumor samples is clearly expressed and engaged in a potentially oncogenic activity through its heightened phosphorylation and interaction with β-catenin. It is interesting to note that treatment of a low c-Neu-expressing cell line (MCF-7) with 4D5 (the nonhumanized precursor to Trastuzumab) resulted in the inhibition of motility and invasion, encouraging the authors to speculate on a role for anti-c-Neu therapy in treatment of breast cancer with low receptor expression (35Adam L.

Vadlamudi R. Semin. Oncol. 2000; 27: 84-100PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas ∼20–30% of patients with metastatic breast cancer clinically overexpress Her2/Neu (37Simon R. Nocito A. Hubscher T. Bucher C. Torhorst J. Schraml P. Bubendorf L. Mihatsch M.M. Moch H. Wilber K. Schotzau A. Kononen J. Sauter G. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2001; 93: 1141-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), the treatment group potentially benefited by Herceptin therapy may be much larger. The targeting of c-Neu in those cancers where expression is low (and regarded as negative by standard clinical testing) could prevent ErbB-induced phosphorylation of β-catenin and the subsequent signaling events that occur in invasive disease.

This modular structure well fits the docking groove on MAPKs that we have previously identified and may contribute to regulating the docking specificity of the MKP family. The position, number, and species of charged amino acids in each module including the central hydrophobic subregion are important factors in regulation of docking to specific MAPKs.

The signal must be transduced with high efficiency and specificity. The molecular basis for this accurate signal transduction has been addressed in recent years.

The complex formation is distinct from a transient enzyme-substrate interaction through the active center. For example, a complex formation between MEK1 (an MAPK-activated protein kinase specific for ERK) and ERK is achieved through an N-terminal portion of MEK1 outside its catalytic domain (12Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1901-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). A C-terminal portion outside the catalytic domain of RSK (a MAPK-activated protein kinase specific for ERK) is required for a complex formation with ERK2 (16Gavin A.C. Nebreda A.R. Curr.

Such a complex formation is called a docking interaction and is thought to regulate the enzymatic efficiency and specificity in the MAPK pathways. Recent studies provided clues to understand the molecular nature of the docking interaction. We and others identified a conserved MAPK-docking motif in the primary sequences of MAPK-interacting molecules (11Bardwell L. Thorner J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 373-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 14Pulido R. Zuniga A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7337-7350Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 15Xia Y.

Chem. 2001; 276: 16491-16500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have identified a docking site on MAPKs that is located on the opposite side from the active center of the molecules in the steric structure and in the C-terminal portion of MAPKs in the primary sequence (22Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Because this site is commonly used in the docking interactions with activators, substrates, and inactivators, we named it the common docking (CD) domain. These docking interactions through the CD domain might regulate the serial signal transduction of the MAPK cascade reactions. The CD domain alone, however, does not determine the docking specificity (22Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 23Tanoue T. Maeda R. Adachi M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 466-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In search of another site on MAPKs that might regulate the docking specificity, we then identified a site near the CD domain in the steric structure on MAPKs and called it the ED site (23Tanoue T. Maeda R. Adachi M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 466-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). When both the CD domain and the ED site of ERK2 are engineered to mimic those of p38, the docking specificity is converted to the p38 type in the case of docking to some MAPK-activated protein kinases. We thus proposed a concept of a docking groove, which is composed of the CD domain, the ED site, and the surrounding amino acids. Although the CD domain is commonly important for every docking interaction, the ED site is differently utilized (23Tanoue T. Maeda R. Adachi M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 466-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The next open question is then which region on the MAPK-interacting molecules corresponds to the docking groove of MAPKs. MKPs belong to a family of dual specificity phosphatases and specifically dephosphorylate both threonine and tyrosine residues in the P-loop of MAPKs. They share sequence homology and are highly specific for MAPKs but differ in the substrate specificity, tissue distribution, subcellular localization, and inducibility by extracellular stimuli (34Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 35Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 36Zhan X.L. Wishart M.J. Guan K.L. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2477-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). MKPs have been shown to play important roles in regulating the function of the MAPK family (37Martin-Blanco E. Gampel A. Ring J. Virdee K. Kirov N. Tolkovsky A.M. Martinez-Arias A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 557-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 38Berset T. Hoier E.F. Battu G. Canevascini S. Hajna A. Science. 2001; 291: 1055-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In mammals, 10 members of MKPs have been reported, and they must be precisely regulated in their substrate specificity to avoid unexpected inactivation of MAPKs. MKPs are mainly composed of two domains, an N-terminal rhodanese-fold and a C-terminal catalytic domain. The former is responsible for their selective docking to members of the MAPK family. Because the catalytic domain alone does not show strict selectivity toward the members of MAPK family (13Muda M. Theodosiou A. Gillieron C. Smith A. Chabert C. Camps M. Boschert U. Rodrigues N. Davies K. Ashworth A. Arkinstall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9323-9329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 31Tanoue T. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19949-19956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), the N-terminal domain of MKPs plays a major role in regulating their enzymatic specificity in vivo through docking interaction with MAPKs. MKP is unique in this point among MAPK-interacting molecules. For example, even high concentrations of MEK1 (a MAPKK specific for ERK) cannot activate p38 or JNK/SAPK. Therefore, there must be a fine regulatory mechanism for the docking of MKPs to MAPKs. In the N-terminal domain of all the known MKPs exists a cluster of positively charged amino acids that has been proposed to be a site corresponding to the CD domain (22Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 24Tanoue T. Yamamoto T. Maeda R. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26629-26639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, whether the docking interaction of MKPs is regulated solely by this cluster alone has not been investigated yet. Here we have identified a novel region in the N-terminal domain of MKPs that encompasses the cluster and regulates the docking efficiency and specificity. The region (docking surface) can be subdivided into three subdomains. Each subdomain fits each corresponding subregion of the docking groove on MAPKs. Notably, charged residues in each subdomain play an essential role in recognition of each specific MAPK. This modular structure of the docking surface of MKPs proposed here may be a molecular basis explaining the specificity of the action of MKPs toward the MAPK family. The expression vector used for human CL100/MKP-1 (39Keyse S.M. Emslie E.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 644-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), human MKP-7 (24Tanoue T. Yamamoto T. Maeda R. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26629-26639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and rat MKP-3 (30Groom L.A. Sneddon A.A. Alessi D.R. Dowd S. Keyse S.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) is pDL-SRα-3XMyc. For ERK2 (Xenopus), JNK2 (rat), and p38α (human), pDL-SRα-HA was used. The mutants used were constructed by PCR-based mutagenesis. PCR was performed using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). A DpnI restriction enzyme (Stratagene)-treated PCR product was transformed into Escherichia coli. Positive clones were picked up, and mutagenesis was verified by sequencing. C2C12 cells or COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 15 or 10% fetal calf serum, respectively. The cells were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The cells were split on a 35- or 60-mm dish at 2 × 105 or 5 × 105cells/dish, respectively. After 19 h, the cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were lysed in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin. The tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates (about 3 × 106 cells in each sample) by incubation with 5 μg of anti-c-Myc antibody (9E10) (Santa Cruz) or 5 μg of anti-HA antibody (12CA5) and protein A-Sepharose beads (25 μl) (Amersham Biosciences) for 2–12 h at 4 °C. The precipitates were then washed twice with lysis buffer. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. The cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 12 mm 2-glycerophosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin). The tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates (about 1 × 106cells in each sample) by incubation with 2 μg of appropriate antibody and protein A-Sepharose beads (15 μl) (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C. Each precipitate was washed twice with Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5m NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin) and then washed with Tris buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5). The washed beads were mixed with substrates in a kinase reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 100 μm ATP (2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP)) and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli's sample buffer. Substrate phosphorylation was detected by autoradiography and BAS 2500 (Fuji Film) after SDS-PAGE. We previously demonstrated that both the CD domain and the ED site of p38 and ERK MAPKs are important for their interactions with MKP-3 (an MKP specific for ERK) and MKP-5 (an MKP specific for p38 and JNK/SAPK) (23Tanoue T. Maeda R. Adachi M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 466-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Here, we extended our analysis to other MKPs, CL100/MKP-1 (also known as 3CH134) (39Keyse S.M. Emslie E.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 644-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 40Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar) and MKP-7, which we have recently identified (24Tanoue T. Yamamoto T. Maeda R. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26629-26639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). CL100 is thought to act preferentially on JNK/SAPK and p38 and weakly on ERK. In contrast, like MKP-5, MKP-7 acts specifically on JNK/SAPK and p38 and not on ERK. We used three mutant forms of ERK2: ERK2 SD in which a serine residue in the CD domain (Ser323) was replaced by aspartic acid to mimic the CD domain of p38; ERK2 TETD in which the ED site (Thr162and Thr163) was converted to that of p38; p38-like ERK2 in which both the CD domain and the ED site were converted to those of p38 (Fig. 1 A; see also Ref. 23Tanoue T. Maeda R. Adachi M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 466-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 B, although wild-type ERK2 or ERK2 SD did not bind to CL100, ERK2 TETD slightly bound to CL100, and p38-like ERK2 bound to it more strongly. In contrast, none of the ERK2 constructs were able to bind to MKP-7. As expected, wild-type p38 bound to CL100 strongly, and p38 CDm, in which three aspartic acids of the CD domain (Asp313, Asp315, and Asp316) were replaced by asparagine, did not. As reported previously (24Tanoue T. Yamamoto T. Maeda R. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26629-26639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), wild-type p38 but not p38 CDm bound to MKP-7 (data not shown). Next, we examined the enzymatic activity of CL100. When co-expressed in the cells, p38-like ERK2 was inactivated by CL100 much more efficiently than was wild-type ERK2 (Fig. 1 C). These results clearly show that both the CD domain and the ED site regulate the docking specificity of MAPKs toward CL100. Examining the primary sequence of CL100, we noticed another site near the previously identified site (residues 50–58) presumably interacting with the CD domain (22Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar) that is composed of two positively charged amino acids and surrounding hydrophobic amino acids (residues 71–75 of CL100 (human); Fig.2 A). We hypothesized that this site corresponds to the ED site, because the ED site of p38 is composed of two negatively charged amino acids. To test this hypothesis, we created a mutant form of CL100 (CL100LMGML), in which two arginine residues (Arg72 and Arg74) were replaced by methionines (Fig. 2 A). Although wild-type CL100/MKP-1 bound to p38-like ERK2, CL100LMGML scarcely bound (Fig. 2, B andC). These results suggest the possible interaction of the ED site with Arg72 and Arg73 of CL100. Next, we tested whether Arg72 and Arg74 of CL100/MKP-1 are important for the interaction with the MAPK family members (ERK2, p38, and JNK/SAPK). As shown in Fig.3 B, CL100LMGML showed an ability to bind to p38α, JNK2, or p38-like ERK2 that was significantly weaker than that of wild-type CL100. These results show that Arg72 and Arg74 are utilized in the docking interaction between CL100 and MAPKs. Neither the wild-type nor the LMGML mutant CL100 bound to ERK2. To confirm that the Arg53, Arg54, and Arg55 of CL100, which are suggested to constitute the site corresponding to the CD domain of MAPKs, are essential for docking, we created mutants, in which two or three of these arginines were replaced by methionines (Fig. 3 A). Although wild-type CL100 strongly bound to p38α, CL100MMR or CL100MMM did not (Fig. 3 C). The docking ability of the both mutants to JNK2 was also reduced compared with wild-type CL100, but the mutants still bound to JNK2 significantly (Fig. 3 C). These results show that Arg53, Arg54, and Arg55 of CL100/MKP-1 are important for docking to both p38 and JNK, but their contribution is less for JNK than p38. CL100MMR or CL100MMM did not bind to p38-like ERK2, implying that the docking mode of p38-like ERK2 is similar to that of p38. Comparing the primary sequences of the known MKPs, we noticed that the region corresponding to residues 51–81 of CL100 is relatively well conserved (Fig. 4 A) and that the region can be divided into three subregions (modules). In the first, N-terminal region, a cluster of positively charged residues exists to which the negatively charged amino acids of the CD domain of MAPKs might bind; in the second central region, hydrophobic residues such as leucine, isoleucine, and valine are abundant and conserved; and in the third, C-terminal region, positively charged residues and often surrounding hydrophobic residues exist. The third subregion is most diverse in the amino acid composition. We hypothesized that this modular structure of an assumed docking surface of MKPs fits the docking groove of MAPKs and regulates the docking specificity toward MAPKs (Fig. 4 B). To examine whether the residues in each subregion (module) are utilized in the docking interaction, we created several mutant forms of CL100 in which some of conserved or nonconserved residues in each subregion were replaced by alanines or methionines (Fig. 5 A). As shown in Fig. 5 B, both the hydrophobic amino acids (Ile51 and Val52) and the positively charged amino acids in the first subregion of CL100 are essential for its docking interaction with p38. Although three amino acids seem to be involved in the docking interaction with JNK2 to the same extent, their contribution was small as compared with the case of p38 (Fig. 5 B, compare lane wt with lanes MMR, MMM, and AARRR). The hydrophobic amino acids of the second subregion are crucially important for the docking interaction with p38 and JNK2 (Fig. 5 B, lanes MLAA and IVAA). The positively charged amino acids (Arg72 and Arg74) and the surrounding hydrophobic amino acids (Leu71 and Leu75) in the third subregion are important for docking to both p38 and JNK2; these amino acids, however, are differently utilized in each docking interaction (Fig. 5 B, lanes LRGML,LMGRL, LMGML, ARGRL, LRGRA, and ARGRA). Generally, the mutations in the third subregion had more severe effects on the interaction with JNK2 than that with p38. For example, although CL100LMGRL bound to p38 as efficiently as wild-type CL100 did, it bound to JNK2 much more weakly than wild-type CL100 did. Next, we mutated arginines in the first and third subregions to lysines. The Arg to Lys mutation is supposed to scarcely induce gross conformational changes in the protein, as is the case with the Lys to Arg mutation that is routinely used to produce a kinase-dead form of protein kinases in general. As shown in Fig. 5 C, although the first subregion mutants, CL100KKR and CL100KKK, showed a reduced ability to bind to p38, they bound to JNK2 as efficiently as wild-type CL100 did. In contrast, although the third subregion mutant CL100LKGKL bound to p38 as efficiently as wild-type CL100 did, it showed a reduced ability to bind to JNK2. These results suggest that our results obtained here reflect local changes in the direct docking surface of the protein. Our results indicate that each subregion in the docking region of CL100 are differently utilized in docking interaction with each member of the MAPK family. The first subregion is essential for the docking interaction with p38 but not with JNK; the second subregion is essential for the docking to both p38 and JNK; and the third subregion is essential for the docking to JNK but less important for p38. Thus, this region comprising the three subregions (residues 51–81 of CL100/MKP-1) is utilized in the docking interaction. We call this region a docking surface.Figure 5The positively charged amino acids and hydrophobic amino acids in the docking surface are both important for the docking interaction of CL100/MKP-1.

Three modules are indicated by underlining. B andC, the binding between several mutant forms of CL100/MKP-1 and p38 (versus p38) or JNK/SAPK (versus JNK2) was examined. Lysates of C2C12 cells each transfected with HA-p38 or HA-JNK2 were mixed with the lysates of C2C12 cells transfected with Myc-CL100/MKP-1, and the mixture was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody. The lysates of C2C12 cells (nine plates of 60-mm dish) transfected with HA-p38 or HA-JNK2 were divided equally into 18 samples (150 μl each) and then mixed with the lysates (½ of a 60-mm dish) of C2C12 cells expressing Myc-CL100/MKP-1 (½ of a 60-mm dish). Co-immunoprecipitated Myc-CL100/MKP-1 was detected (αMyc (IP:α HA )).

IκB kinase-mediated phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of p105 recruits the SCFβ-TrCP ubiquitin ligase, resulting in rapid ubiquitination and subsequent processing/degradation of p105. NEDD8 is known to activate SCF ligases following modification of their cullin component. Here we show that NEDDylation is required for conjugation and processing of p105 by SCFβ-TrCP following phosphorylation of the molecule. In a crude extract, a dominant negative E2 enzyme, UBC12, inhibits both conjugation and processing of p105, and inhibition is alleviated by an excess of WT- UBC12. In a reconstituted cell-free system, ubiquitination of p105 was stimulated only in the presence of all three components of the NEDD8 pathway, E1, E2, and NEDD8. A Cul-1 mutant that cannot be NEDDylated could not stimulate ubiquitination and processing of p105. Similar findings were observed also in cells. It should be noted that NEDDylation is required only for the stimulated but not for basal processing of p105. Although the mechanisms that underlie processing of p105 are largely obscure, it is clear that NEDDylation and the coordinated activity of SCFβ-TrCP on both p105 and IκBα serve as an important regulatory mechanism controlling NF-κB activity.

NF-κB is a dimeric complex composed in many cases of p50 or p52 and p65 subunits. p50 and p52 are synthesized as inactive precursors, p105 and p100, respectively, which undergo ubiquitin-mediated limited processing that removes the C-terminal ankyrin repeat-containing domain of the molecule to yield the p50 or p52 N-terminal active subunit (2Fan C.M.

Intracellular localization plays an important role in NF-κB regulation, with the inactive proteins retained in the cytosol. Regulation is achieved via two major pathways: 1) control of p105/p100 processing and 2) interaction of the p50/p65 heterodimer with inhibitory molecules, IκBs. Processing of p105 occurs under both basal and activated conditions. Several studies suggested that all the motifs that are required for basal processing or processing that may occur co-translationally are contained within the N-terminal ∼550 amino residues (6Lin L. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2248-2254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Lin L. DeMartino G.N. Greene W.C.

In quiescent cells, the active heterodimeric complex is retained in the cytosol bound to a member of the IκB family of inhibitory proteins. Following stimulation, specific IκB kinases (IKKs) are activated, leading to phosphorylation of the inhibitor on serine residues 32 and 36, its rapid ubiquitination by the SCFβ-TrCP ubiquitin ligase, and its subsequent degradation by the 26 S proteasome. Following degradation of IκB, the NF-κB active p50/p52·p65 heterodimeric complex translocates into the nucleus and activates target genes (for a recent review, see Ref. 13Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4045) Google Scholar).The ubiquitin proteolytic pathway plays key roles in regulating the levels of many proteins involved in diverse cellular processes. Proteins targeted for degradation are first tagged by a polyubiquitin chain in a three-step cascade reaction involving ubiquitin activation (catalyzed by the ubiquitin activation enzyme, E1), ubiquitin transfer (catalyzed by a ubiquitin carrier protein, E2), and ubiquitin ligation (catalyzed by a ubiquitin-protein ligase, E3). Tagged proteins are then degraded by the 26 S proteasome complex (for recent reviews on the ubiquitin pathway, see for example Refs. 14Kornitzer D. Ciechanover A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar and 15Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). There are four major classes of ubiquitin ligases classified according to a common motif shared by one of the enzyme components. HECT (homologous to E6-AP carboxylterminus) domain proteins are represented by E6-AP (E6-associated protein) and contain within the HECT domain a conserved cysteine residue to which the activated ubiquitin is transferred from E2. The other three groups, the U-box-containing ligases (16Jiang J. Ballinger C.A., Wu, Y. Dai Q. Cyr D.M. Höhfeld J. Patterson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42938-42944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), the PHD domain-containing ligases (17Coscoy L. Sanchez D.J. Ganem D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), and the RING finger-containing E3s function differently and serve as scaffolds that position the substrate and the E2 optimally for direct ubiquitin transfer. The SCFβ-TrCP involved in p105 processing (see below) belongs to the RING finger-containing ligases. It is a complex that contains three commonly shared subunits, Skp1, Cullin-1, and the RING finger protein Rbx1-Roc1-Hrt1, and an F-box protein which is a variable substrate-binding subunit involved in recognition of phosphorylated target proteins (18Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). The F-box protein β-TrCP recognizes the common motif DpSGψDpS, where pS is phosphoserine and ψ is a hydrophobic residue, that is found in IκBs, β-catenin, and HIV-Vpu, for example (13Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4045) Google Scholar).Processing/degradation of p105 is mediated by two distinct structural motifs. The first resides adjacent to the glycine-rich region and contains two lysine residues that serve as ubiquitin anchors and a downstream acidic domain that may serve as an E3-binding site. This motif is probably involved in basal/constitutive and/or co-translational processing/degradation of p105, providing resting cells with the low amount of p50 required for their activity under non-stimulated conditions (8Orian A. Schwartz A.L. Israël A. Whiteside S. Kahana C. Ciechanover A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3664-3673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second motif is involved in signal-induced processing/degradation of p105 and is dependent upon IKK-mediated phosphorylation, SCFβ-TrCP-mediated ubiquitination, and limited processing/degradation of the molecule (10Heissmeyer V. Krappmann D. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4766-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 11Orian A. Gonen H. Bercovich B. Fajerman I. Eytan E. Israël A. Mercurio F. Iwai K.

Biol. 2001; 21: 1024-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In addition, the C-terminal domain of p105 contains seven ankyrin repeats between the glycine-rich region and the IKK/TrCP recognition domain. These repeats bind free p50 subunits that inhibit processing of the precursor (19Hatada E.N. Nieters A. Wulczyn F.G. Naumann M. Meyer R. Nucifora G. McKeithan T.W. Scheidereit C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2489-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 20Rice N.R. MacKichan M.L. Israël A.

A. 1994; 91: 1346-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Following stimulation, inhibition is alleviated via phosphorylation and ubiquitination of the C-terminal domain that lead to rapid processing/degradation of p105. The released free p50 subunits are then translocated into the nucleus (22Cohen S. Orian A. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26769-26776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).NEDD8 is a mammalian member of ubiquitin-like (UbL) proteins, which modify proteins in a manner similar to ubiquitination, except that in most cases it is a single moiety of the modifying protein that is attached to the substrate (reviewed recently in Ref. 23Hochstrasser M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E153-E157Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). NEDDylation requires the coordinated action of APP-BPI/Uba3 (a heterodimeric E1-like enzyme) and UBC12 (an E2-like enzyme) (24Oska F. Kawasaki H. Aida N. Saeki M. Chiba T. Kawashima S. Tanaka K. Kato S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2263-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 25Gong L. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12036-12042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). A possible role for an E3-like enzyme has been demonstrated recently for SUMO conjugation in yeast (26Johnson E.S. Gupta A.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 735-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), although it is not clear whether a ligase is required in all reactions involving UbL protein modification. NEDD8 has been shown to modify members of the cullin/cdc53 family (23Hochstrasser M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E153-E157Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), which are the only known substrates of the pathway. Some of the cullins are members of ubiquitin ligase complexes; Cul-1 serves as a core subunit in the SCF ubiquitin ligase family, whereas Cul-2 and Cul-5 assemble with Elongin B and C to form similar ligase complexes (27Iwai K. Yamanaka K. Kamura T. Minato N. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Klausner R.D. Pause A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12436-12441Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 28Kamura T.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3475-3484Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), but under basal conditions it is dispensable in the budding yeast (30Lammer D. Mathias N. Laplaza J.M. Jiang W. Liu Y.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2208-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the NEDD8 pathway is essential for cell cycle progression and morphogenesis (32Tateishi K. Omata M. Tanaka K. Chiba T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). NEDD8 is conjugated to Cul-1 at lysine residue 720 (Ref. 33Wu K. Chen A. Pan Z.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32317-32324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar; see also below), and this modification stimulates the ubiquitin ligase activity of SCFβ-TrCPtoward IκBα (see, for example, Ref. 34Read M.A. Brownell J.E. Gladysheva T.B. Hottelet M. Parent L.A. Coggins M.B. Pierce J.W. Podust V.N. Luo R.S. Chau V. Palombella V.J. Mol. Cell.

Commun. 2000; 270: 1093-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 36Podust V.N. Brownell J.E. Gladysheva T.B. Luo R.S. Wang C. Coggins M.B. Pierce J.W. Lightcap E.S. Chau V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4579-4584Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, it appears that NEDD8 up-regulates the SCF complex activity through a conformational change of Cul-1 that may promote efficient formation of an E2-E3 complex (37Kawakami T. Chiba T. Suzuki T. Iwai K. Yamanaka K. Minato N. Suzuki H. Shimbara N. Hidaka Y. Osaka F. Omata M. Tanaka K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4003-4012Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 38Wu K. Chen A. Tan P. Pan Z.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 516-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Taken together, it seems that Cul-1 modification by NEDD8 is a universal regulated mechanism that has a profound effect on the ubiquitin ligase activity of SCF complexes and probably of other related cullin-containing complexes, thus affecting the levels of key cellular proteins.Although it is recognized that NEDD8 modification stimulates the activity of SCF ubiquitin ligases, a role for the NEDD8 pathway in p105 ubiquitination that affects NF-κB activation has not been established. Here we show that NEDD8 modification is required for efficient SCFβ-TrCP-mediated ubiquitination and processing of p105 following phosphorylation of the molecule by IKKβ. Thus, NEDD8 modification serves as an additional regulatory mechanism controlling NF-κB transcriptional activity, linking together the ubiquitin and NEDD8 pathways with signal-induced NF-κB activation.DISCUSSIONWe have recently identified SCFβ-TrCP as the ubiquitin ligase complex mediating phosphorylation-dependent p105 processing (11Orian A. Gonen H. Bercovich B. Fajerman I. Eytan E. Israël A. Mercurio F. Iwai K. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2580-2591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study we show that NEDD8 modification of the Cul-1 component of the SCF complex is required for efficient ubiquitination and processing of p105 by the SCFβ-TrCP following phosphorylation of the precursor by IKKβ. Several lines of evidence support our conclusion. We show that in a cell-free system, the addition of all three NEDD8 pathway components is required to reconstitute p105 ubiquitination (Figs. 1 and 3). Not surprisingly, the NEDD8 pathway could not support conjugation of p105 that was not phosphorylated (Fig. 3) or lacks the IKKβ and β-TrCP recognition site (Fig. 4 C). These findings strongly support the notion that NEDDylation is required specifically for p105 processing which is dependent on IKK-mediated phosphorylation followed by SCFβ-TrCP-catalyzed ubiquitination. Consistent with these results, a mutant Cul-1(K696R)-containing the SCFβ-TrCPcomplex that cannot be modified by NEDD8 is completely inactive and cannot catalyze ubiquitination (Figs. 2 and 3). Furthermore, a catalytic site mutant UBC12(C111S) inhibited, in a cell-free assay, p105 ubiquitination (Fig. 4) and subsequent processing (Fig. 5). Finally, our findings have been corroborated in vivo: inhibition of the NEDD8 pathway, either by using a DN-UBC12 or a mutant Cul-1, blocked completely phosphorylation-mediated p105 processing (Fig. 6). Here too, inhibition was limited to the IKKβ-stimulated processing (and the phosphorylated precursor) and not to the basal processing.We have previously reported that p105 is targeted for ubiquitination and processing by two distinct, basal/constitutive (8Orian A. Schwartz A.L. Israël A. Whiteside S. Kahana C. Ciechanover A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3664-3673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and signal-induced (11Orian A. Gonen H. Bercovich B. Fajerman I.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2580-2591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), recognition motifs that are utilized under different physiological conditions. The two motifs are probably recognized by distinct E2 and E3 enzymes (11Orian A. Gonen H. Bercovich B. Fajerman I. Eytan E. Israël A. Mercurio F. Iwai K. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2580-2591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). According to our proposed model (8Orian A. Schwartz A.L. Israël A. Whiteside S. Kahana C. Ciechanover A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3664-3673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Orian A. Gonen H. Bercovich B. Fajerman I. Eytan E. Israël A. Mercurio F. Iwai K. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A.

DeMartino G.N. Greene W.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 819-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), using the basal/constitutive recognition motif. The p50 subunits generated during this process dock to the emerging ankyrin repeat domain at the C-terminal half of p105 and inhibit processing of these precursors (22Cohen S. Orian A. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26769-26776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The completely synthesized p105 with the docked p50 subunits serves as an inactive storage by sequestering these subunits in the cytosol and inhibiting their translocation into the nucleus. Following stimulation, the SCFβ-TrCP ubiquitin ligase is recruited to the IKK-mediated phosphorylation motif at the C-terminal domain, leading to rapid polyubiquitination and subsequent processing/degradation of p105 with release of the docked p50 molecules and an additional p50 subunit released from processed p105 (11Orian A. Gonen H. Bercovich B. Fajerman I. Eytan E. Israël A. Mercurio F. Iwai K. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2580-2591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Heissmeyer V. Krappmann D.

Our results further support this model by underscoring the role of SCFβ-TrCP as the ligase involved in phosphorylated p105 processing.NEDDYlation clearly adds an additional layer of control to an already tightly regulated, signal-induced pathway. It is a complex cycle involving control of the extent of NEDD8 modification (34Read M.A. Brownell J.E. Gladysheva T.B. Hottelet M. Parent L.A. Coggins M.B. Pierce J.W. Podust V.N. Luo R.S. Chau V.

An interesting question in this context is why p105 processing requires such an elaborate mechanism. Processing of p105 is mostly constitutive and is stimulated ∼2.0-fold following stimulation. This is due, most probably, to the presence of two sites of recognition in p105, one operating under non-stimulated conditions and the other following signaling (see above). Even this site was found to be partially phosphorylated in resting cells. In contrast, processing of p100 to yield p52 is mostly signal-induced (49Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G. Greten F.R. Krähn G.

Cell. 2001; 19: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (670) Google Scholar), although, we know little on this process. Because the two molecules are homologous, it is possible that the evolution of the cumbersome regulatory mechanism that involves signaling, IKK activation, IKK-mediated phosphorylation, NEDDylation of the Cul-1 component of the SCF complex, and ubiquitination of p105 at the second, signal-induced site, was not directed toward p105 but rather at p100. p52, which is derived from p100, is required for lymphoid tissue development for example (see Ref. 49Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G. Greten F.R. Krähn G. Bonizzi G. Chen Y., Hu, Y. Fong A. Sun S.C. Karin M. Science. 2001; 293: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar) and cannot be replaced by p50. p105 that provides the cell with the NF-κB transcriptional activator required for many of its basic needs, some independent on one another, had to evolve additional motifs acting under basal conditions that allows the molecule to be relieved from its tight signaling control and processed mostly in a constitutive manner. NF-κB1 is a member of the Rel family of transcription factors that are known to regulate basic processes, such as the immune and proinflammatory responses, development and differentiation, malignant transformation, and apoptosis (for a recent review, see Ref. 1Foo S.Y. Nolan G.P. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 229-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). NF-κB is a dimeric complex composed in many cases of p50 or p52 and p65 subunits. p50 and p52 are synthesized as inactive precursors, p105 and p100, respectively, which undergo ubiquitin-mediated limited processing that removes the C-terminal ankyrin repeat-containing domain of the molecule to yield the p50 or p52 N-terminal active subunit (2Fan C.M.

Intracellular localization plays an important role in NF-κB regulation, with the inactive proteins retained in the cytosol. Regulation is achieved via two major pathways: 1) control of p105/p100 processing and 2) interaction of the p50/p65 heterodimer with inhibitory molecules, IκBs. Processing of p105 occurs under both basal and activated conditions. Several studies suggested that all the motifs that are required for basal processing or processing that may occur co-translationally are contained within the N-terminal ∼550 amino residues (6Lin L.

In quiescent cells, the active heterodimeric complex is retained in the cytosol bound to a member of the IκB family of inhibitory proteins. Following stimulation, specific IκB kinases (IKKs) are activated, leading to phosphorylation of the inhibitor on serine residues 32 and 36, its rapid ubiquitination by the SCFβ-TrCP ubiquitin ligase, and its subsequent degradation by the 26 S proteasome. Following degradation of IκB, the NF-κB active p50/p52·p65 heterodimeric complex translocates into the nucleus and activates target genes (for a recent review, see Ref. 13Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4045) Google Scholar). The ubiquitin proteolytic pathway plays key roles in regulating the levels of many proteins involved in diverse cellular processes. Proteins targeted for degradation are first tagged by a polyubiquitin chain in a three-step cascade reaction involving ubiquitin activation (catalyzed by the ubiquitin activation enzyme, E1), ubiquitin transfer (catalyzed by a ubiquitin carrier protein, E2), and ubiquitin ligation (catalyzed by a ubiquitin-protein ligase, E3). Tagged proteins are then degraded by the 26 S proteasome complex (for recent reviews on the ubiquitin pathway, see for example Refs. 14Kornitzer D. Ciechanover A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar and 15Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). There are four major classes of ubiquitin ligases classified according to a common motif shared by one of the enzyme components. HECT (homologous to E6-AP carboxylterminus) domain proteins are represented by E6-AP (E6-associated protein) and contain within the HECT domain a conserved cysteine residue to which the activated ubiquitin is transferred from E2. The other three groups, the U-box-containing ligases (16Jiang J. Ballinger C.A., Wu, Y. Dai Q. Cyr D.M. Höhfeld J. Patterson C. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), and the RING finger-containing E3s function differently and serve as scaffolds that position the substrate and the E2 optimally for direct ubiquitin transfer. The SCFβ-TrCP involved in p105 processing (see below) belongs to the RING finger-containing ligases. It is a complex that contains three commonly shared subunits, Skp1, Cullin-1, and the RING finger protein Rbx1-Roc1-Hrt1, and an F-box protein which is a variable substrate-binding subunit involved in recognition of phosphorylated target proteins (18Deshaies R.J.

https://openalex.org/W2006755544,"Social insects show multiple levels of self identity. Most individuals are sterile workers who selflessly labor for their colony, which is often viewed as a superorganism. The superorganism protects itself with colony recognition systems based on learned odors, typically cuticular hydrocarbons. Transfer of these odors within the colony obscures separate clan identities. Residual individual interests do appear to cause conflicts within colonies over sex ratio, male production, caste, and reproductive dominance. However, genomic imprinting theory predicts that the individual's maternal and paternal genes will evolve separate infraorganismal identities, perhaps leaving virtually no coherent individual identity."

The beneficial effect of high density lipoprotein (HDL) in protecting against the development of cardiovascular disease is thought to be mediated predominately through its induction of cellular cholesterol efflux and “reverse cholesterol transport” from peripheral tissues to the liver. We tested the hypothesis that HDL could inhibit cellular lipid accumulation by modulating expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ)-responsive genes. To this end, we evaluated expression of two PPARγ-responsive genes, CD36, a receptor for oxidized low density lipoprotein, and aP2, a fatty acid-binding protein. HDL decreased expression of macrophage CD36 and aP2 in a dose-dependent manner. HDL also decreased aP2 expression in fibroblasts, reduced accumulation of lipid, and slowed differentiation of fibroblasts into adipocytes. HDL stimulated mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activity, and inhibition of CD36 expression was blocked by co-incubation with a MAP kinase inhibitor. HDL increased expression of PPARγ mRNA and protein, induced translocation of PPARγ from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, and increased PPARγ phosphorylation.

In addition, we evaluated the effect of HDL on PPARγ-mediated fibroblast to adipocyte differentiation and lipid accumulation. We provide evidence for the first time that HDL inhibits cellular lipid accumulation by modulating the expression of CD36 and aP2. Macrophages (RAW264.7) and fibroblasts (3T3) were cultured in RPMI 1640 and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, respectively, containing 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin, and 2 mmglutamine. Macrophages were switched to serum-free medium for 3–5 h when the confluence was about 85% and then received treatments in serum-free medium. Fibroblasts were treated in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at the first day of confluence. HDL (1.063–1.210 g/ml) was isolated from normal human plasma by sequential ultracentrifugation after removal of very low density lipoprotein (<1.019 g/ml) and LDL (1.019–1.063 g/ml). HDL was dialyzed against PBS containing 0.3 mmEDTA, sterilized by filtration through a 0.22-μm filter, and stored under N2 gas at 4 °C. The protein content was determined by the methods of Lowry et al. (45Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in RNAzolTM B (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX) and chloroform-extracted, and total RNA was precipitated in isopropanol. After washing with 80 and 100% ethanol, the dried pellet of total RNA was dissolved in distilled water and quantified. The poly(A+) RNA was isolated from about 80 μg of total RNA by using the PolyATtract® mRNA Isolation System III (Promega, Madison, WI). Total RNA or poly(A+) RNA was loaded on a 1% formaldehyde agarose gel. After electrophoresis, RNA was transferred to a Zeta-probe® GT Genomic Tested Blotting Membrane (Bio-Rad) in 10× SSC by capillary force overnight. The blot was UV cross-linked for 2 min and then prehybridized with HybrisolTM I (Oncor, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) for 30 min before addition of 32P randomly primed labeling probe for mouse PPARγ, CD36, aP2, or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. After overnight hybridization, the membrane was washed for 2 × 20 min with 2× SSC plus 0.2% SDS and then for 2 × 20 min with 0.2× SSC plus 0.2% SDS at 55 °C. The blot was then autoradiographed by exposure to x-ray film (X-OmatTM AR, Kodak). Autoradiograms were assessed by densitometric scanning using a UMAX (Santa Clara, CA) UC630 flatbed scanner attached to a Macintosh IIci (Apple Computer, Cupertino, CA) running NIH Image software (Bethesda, MD). Template DNA for PPARγ and aP2 were generated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction based on the published sequences. The 5′- and 3′-sequences of oligonucleotides used for PPARγ were TCGGCGTTGTCATGATCCTC (nucleotides 121–141) and GGTTCATAAAAGCACGCTGG (nucleotides 551–571), respectively. The 5′- and 3′-sequences of oligonucleotides used for aP2 were GATGCCTTTGTGGGAACC (nucleotides 307–325) and AACTCTTGTGGAAGTCACG (nucleotides 665–684), respectively. After treatment, the cells were washed twice with cold PBS and then scraped and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholic acid, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, and 50 μg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were sonicated for 20 cycles and then microcentrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were transferred to a new test tube. Protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nylon-enhanced nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with a solution of 0.1% Tween 20/PBS (PBS-T) containing 5% fat-free milk for 1 h and then incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-PPARγ (1:2000) or polyclonal anti-phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase antibodies for 2 h at room temperature followed by washing for 3 × 10 min with PBS-T buffer. The blot was reblocked with PBS-T containing 5% milk followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG for another hour at room temperature. After washing 3 × 10 min with PBS-T, the membrane was incubated for 1 min in a mixture of equal volumes of Western blot chemiluminescence reagents 1 and 2 (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was then exposed to film before development. After treatment, cells were removed with trypsin and washed three times with PBS. About 2 × 106 cells were suspended in 300 μl of PBS containing 5% mouse serum and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with shaking. After incubation with 10 μl of polyclonal anti-CD36 antibody conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate isomer 1 (Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA) for 2 h at room temperature, the cells were washed three times with PBS and subjected to flow cytometric evaluation (Coulter FACScan). 3T3 cells were cultured in multichamber wells and processed for indirect immunofluorescence as follows. Cells were fixed in chilled acetone for 20 min. Affinity-purified rabbit anti-mouse PPARγ antibody (in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 2% bovine serum albumin, and 2% nonfat dry milk) was applied at a dilution of 1:50 at 4 °C overnight followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate isomer 1-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG diluted 1:80 for 45 min. After washing three times with buffer, cells were shielded with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA), observed, and photographed using a Nikon Labphot2 fluorescent microscope. Confluent fibroblasts were stimulated to differentiate by addition of insulin, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and dexamethasone for 2 days followed by insulin alone for 2 days and complete medium for two more days. HDL or MAP kinase inhibitor PD98059 was added at the 1st day of stimulation. For the Oil Red O staining, cells were washed with PBS twice and then fixed with prechilled methanol for 3 min at −20 °C followed by washing with cold PBS briefly. Cells were stained with Oil Red O solution (6 parts Oil Red O solution and 4 parts water, Oil Red O stock solution is 0.5% Oil Red O in isopropanol) for 2 h at room temperature. After removing the stain, cells were washed with PBS twice, ethanol once, and water twice and then photographed. We first evaluated the effect of HDL on two PPARγ-responsive genes, CD36 and aP2, in RAW264.7 cells, a murine macrophages cell line. HDL decreased CD36 (Fig. 1 a) and aP2 (Fig.1 b) mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner. Approximately 50–75 μg of HDL caused a 50% decrease of CD36 expression. The decrease in CD36 mRNA was associated with decreased CD36 surface protein as detected by FACS (Fig. 1 c). To determine the mechanism by which HDL decreased expression of CD36 and aP2 we next evaluated the effect of HDL on PPARγ expression. RAW macrophages and NIH-3T3 cells were treated with various concentrations of HDL for 10 h. HDL increased PPARγ mRNA in both cell types in a non-dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2). PPARγ is primarily located within the cytosol and moves to the nucleus following ligand binding and activation. We also evaluated expression and cellular localization of PPARγ by immunocytochemistry. Incubation of NIH-3T3 cells with HDL (50 μg/ml) for 16 h increased the amount of PPARγ and caused the translocation of PPARγ from a cytoplasmic to a nuclear location (Fig. 3). The amount of PPARγ in RAW cells was low and difficult to detect by immunocytochemistry (data not shown).Figure 3Immunofluorescent evaluation PPAR γ cellular localization in response to HDL in fibroblasts. Fibroblasts were incubated with HDL (50 μg/ml) for 16 h. Cellular localization of PPARγ was evaluated by immunohistochemistry as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To address the mechanism(s) and apparent paradox of decreased expression of PPARγ-responsive genes coupled with increased expression and nuclear translocation of PPARγ in response to HDL, we next evaluated the phosphorylation state of PPARγ. PPARγ protein levels and PPARγ phosphorylation were evaluated by Western blot in both HDL-treated macrophages and fibroblasts. Consistent with the Northern blot and immunohistochemistry, HDL significantly increased PPARγ protein in both cell types (Fig. 4). In RAW cells, HDL increased expression of both the non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of PPARγ. At the highest concentrations of HDL evaluated (75 μg/ml), only phosphorylated PPARγ was observed (Fig.4 A, top panel). In NIH-3T3 cells, an increase in only the phosphorylated form was seen in cells incubated with HDL (Fig.4 B, top panel). Others (and we) have previously demonstrated that PPARγ is phosphorylated by MAP kinase (12Han J. Hajjar D.P. Tauras J.M. Feng J. Gotto A.M. Nicholson A.C. J. Biol.

Science. 1996; 274: 2100-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). Addition of a specific MAP kinase inhibitor, UO126, blocked MAP kinase activity and prevented phosphorylation of PPARγ (Fig. 4). To determine the effect of HDL on MAP kinase activity, we evaluated phosphorylation of MAP kinase by Western blot. HDL stimulated phosphorylation of both p42 and p44 isoforms of MAP kinase in RAW cells and NIH-3T3 fibroblasts (Fig.5). To determine the impact of MAP kinase inhibition and PPARγ phosphorylation on PPARγ-responsive expression we evaluated expression of CD36 in RAW cells incubated with HDL and UO126. In the presence of the MAP kinase inhibitor, the negative regulatory effect of HDL on CD36 mRNA (Fig.6 A) expression and cell surface protein (Fig. 6 B) was abolished. Adipogenesis is regulated by a number of factors and hormones. Activation of PPARγ occurs early during the differentiation process, and ligands of PPARγ induce adipocyte differentiation. To determine the effect of HDL on adipocyte differentiation, we used a well characterized system of differentiating fibroblasts into adipocytes using insulin, dexamethasone, and isobutylmethylxanthine. We evaluated the effect of HDL on lipid accumulation with a neutral lipid stain, Oil Red O. Fibroblasts incubated with insulin, dexamethasone, and isobutylmethylxanthine accumulated abundant neutral lipid (Fig.7, panel 1). Lipid accumulation was greatly diminished in cells incubated with HDL plus insulin, dexamethasone, and isobutylmethylxanthine (Fig. 7, panel 2). However, when fibroblasts were incubated with insulin, dexamethasone, isobutylmethylxanthine, and HDL in the presence of a MAP kinase inhibitor, lipid accumulated in amounts similar to the control (Fig. 7, panel 4). Incubation with a MAP kinase inhibitor alone did not impair lipid accumulation (Fig. 7, panel 3). Finally aP2 expression in NIH-3T3 cells was evaluated by Northern blot-ting. aP2 was significantly reduced in cells incubated with HDL (Fig. 8).Figure 8HDL inhibits expression of aP2 in fibroblasts. NIH- 3T3 cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations of HDL for 24 h. Total RNA was extracted and analyzed for aP2 expression by Northern blot.

Our data show that HDL increases the expression, translocation, and phosphorylation of PPARγ and that the effects of HDL on PPARγ-mediated signaling are inhibited by blocking MAP kinase phosphorylation of PPARγ. These data also suggest new beneficial effects of HDL and one that may potentially play a role in the ability of HDL to prevent lipid accumulation leading to the development of cardiovascular disease. Although the mechanism(s) by which HDL can alter cell signaling events remains undefined, several pieces of evidence suggest that it is likely that HDL may activate MAP kinase signaling and PPARγ phosphorylation and inhibit CD36 expression by stimulating cholesterol efflux. We have previously demonstrated that when macrophages are incubated with either bovine serum albumin or cyclodextrin (cholesterol acceptor particles), expression of CD36 is decreased (27Han J. Hajjar D.P. Febbraio M. Nicholson A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21654-21659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 34Han J. Hajjar D.P. Tauras J.M. Nicholson A.C. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 830-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which this occurred were not identified. To determine whether a cholesterol acceptor particle could modulate MAP kinase activity and PPARγ phosphorylation, we incubated J774 macrophages with cyclodextrin and evaluated p42/p44 MAP kinase and PPARγ by Western blot. Both p42/p44 MAP kinase and PPARγ were phosphorylated in response to incubation with cyclodextrin (data not shown), supporting the concept that the removal of cholesterol, not the addition of lipid or lipoprotein, is causing these signaling events. HDL has been shown previously to activate MAP kinase activity in human skin fibroblasts and in vascular smooth muscle cells (11Xue J.C. Schwarz E.J. Chawla A. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1567-1575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Lin K.H. Ashizawa K. Cheng S.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7737-7741Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In fibroblasts, but not smooth muscle cells, activation of MAP kinase by HDL is mediated by protein kinase C (11Xue J.C. Schwarz E.J. Chawla A. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell.

Lipid-free apolipoproteins A-I and A-II had no effect on MAP kinase activation (35Lin K.H. Ashizawa K. Cheng S.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7737-7741Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Inhibition of CD36 expression has been demonstrated to reduce the development of atherosclerosis in atherosclerosis-prone apoE-null mice (30Febbraio M. Podrez E.A. Smith J.D. Hajjar D.P. Hazen S.L. Hoff H.F. Sharma K. Silverstein R.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 1049-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). However, the role that HDL might play in the regulation of PPARγ signaling in vivo and its subsequent effects on lipid metabolism are likely to be complicated. For example, in two murine models of atherosclerosis, the LDL receptor-null and apoE-null, treatment with PPARγ agonists protected against the development of atherosclerosis (36Li A.C. Brown K.K.

Biol. 2001; 21: 372-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In apoE-null mice, there was reduced lesion notwithstanding an increase in CD36 mRNA expression in aortic macrophages (36Li A.C. Brown K.K. Silvestre M.J. Willson T.M. Palinski W. Glass C.K. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). The reason for this apparent contradiction is that there is a second target of PPARγ activation, liver X receptor α (39Chinetti G. Lestavel S. Bocher V. Remaley A.T. Neve B. Torra I.P. Teissier E. Minnich A. Jaye M. Duverger N. Brewer H.B. Fruchart J.C. Clavey V. Staels B. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). This transcription factor has been shown to regulate expression of the cellular cholesterol/phospholipid efflux protein ABC-A1 (37Chawla A. Boisvert W.A. Lee C.H. Laffitte B.A. Barak Y. Josep S.B. Liao D. Nagy L. Edwards P.A. Curtiss L.K. Evans R.M. Tontonoz P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 161-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). Mutations in ABC-A1 are the cause of Tangier disease, a condition characterized by lack of HDL, massive storage of cholesteryl esters in macrophages, and premature atherosclerosis (40Francis G.A. Knopp R.H. Oram J.F. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 96: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 41Lawn R.M. Wade D.P. Garvin M.R. Wang X. Schwartz K. Porter J.G. Seilhamer J.J. Vaughan A.M. Oram J.F. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). The role of aP2 in the development of atherosclerosis has also been recently addressed. In apoE-null mice crossed with Ap2-null mice, development of atherosclerosis was markedly reduced. Similarly when bone marrow of aP2-null/apoE-null mice is transplanted to recipient aP2 wild-type/apoE-null mice, lack of expression of aP2 by macrophages protected against the development of atherosclerosis (42Makowski L. Boord J.B. Maeda K. Babaev V.R. Uysal K.T. Morgan M.A. Parker R.A. Suttles J. Fazio S. Hotamisligil G.S. Linton M.F. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). aP2 is a member of the intracellular fatty acid-binding protein family and is expressed in adipose tissue. Its expression is highly regulated during differentiation of adipocytes and is transcriptionally controlled by fatty acids (43Amri E.Z. Bertrand B. Ailhaud G. Grimaldi P. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 1449-1456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Macrophages express aP2, and its expression suggests overlapping functional roles of adipocytes and macrophages. Genes that are critical in adipocytes, including those encoding transcription factors, cytokines, inflammatory molecules, fatty acid transporters, and scavenger receptors, are also expressed in macrophages and have an important role in their biology (44Cousin B. Munoz O. Andre M. Fontanilles A.M. Dani C. Cousin J.L. Laharrague P. Casteilla L. Pénicaud L. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The precise role of aP2 in modulating lipid metabolism of macrophages is unknown; it is likely that it functions in the mobilization and trafficking of intracellular fatty acids. Cholesterol-loaded THP-1 macrophages express aP2, and its expression is stimulated by oxidized low density lipoprotein (31Fu Y. Luo N. Lopes-Virella M.F. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 2017-2023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This expression is thought to be regulated by saturated fatty acids present in oxidized LDL either directly or indirectly through activation of PPARγ (32Pelton P.D. Zhou L. Demarest K.T. Burris T.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In summary, HDL inhibits the expression of two PPARγ-responsive genes, CD36 and aP2. This effect of HDL is novel and suggests a role of HDL in inhibiting the uptake of oxidized lipids in macrophage and in modulating the trafficking of fatty acids. These effects are likely to enhance the protective role of HDL in preventing lipid accumulation during atherosclerosis."

The behavior of the whole enzyme molecule (whMMP-8), displaying both the catalytic domain and the hemopexin-like domain, has been compared under the same experimental conditions with that of the catalytic domain only. The main observation is that whMMP-8 cleaves bovine collagen I only at a single specific site, as already reported by many others (Mallya, S. K., Mookhtiar, K. A., Gao, Y., Brew, K., Dioszegi, M., Birkedal-Hansen, H., and van Wart, H. E. (1990)<i>Biochemistry</i> 29, 10628–10634; Knäuper, V., Osthues, A., DeClerk, Y. A., Langley, K.

Chem.</i> 275, 18657–18663), whereas the catalytic domain lacks this specificity and cleaves the collagen molecule at multiple sites. Furthermore, a meaningful difference is observed for the cleavage features displayed by two forms of the catalytic domain, which differ for the N terminus resulting from the activation process (<i>i.e.</i> the former Met<sup>80</sup> of the proenzyme (MetMMP-8) and the former Phe<sup>79</sup> of the proenzyme (PheMMP-8)). Thus, the PheMMP-8 species is characterized by a much faster<i>k</i> <sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i> <sub>m</sub> , fully attributable to a lower <i>K</i> <sub>m</sub> , suggesting that the conformation of the catalytic domain, induced by the insertion of this N-terminal residue in a specific pocket (Reinemer, P., Grams, F., Huber, R., Kleine, T., Schnierer, S., Piper, M., Tschesche, H., and Bode, W. (1994) <i>FEBS Lett.</i> 338, 227–233), brings about a better, although less discriminatory, recognition process of cleavage site(s) on bovine collagen I."
https://openalex.org/W1996503280,"Human glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) exists in two isoforms encoded by the GLUD1 and GLUD2 genes, respectively. Although the two enzymes share in their mature form all but 15 of their 505 amino acids, they differ markedly in their allosteric regulation. To identify the structural basis for these allosteric characteristics, we performed site-directed mutagenesis on the human GLUD1 gene at sites that differ from theGLUD2 gene using a cloned GLUD1 cDNA. Results showed that substitution of Ala for Gly-456, but not substitution of His for Arg-470 or Ser for Asn-498, renders the enzyme markedly resistant to GTP inhibition (IC50 = 2.80 μm) as compared with the wild typeGLUD1-derived GDH (IC50 = 0.19 μm). The G456A mutation abolished the cooperative behavior of the enzyme, as revealed by the GTP inhibitory curves. The catalytic and kinetic properties of the G456A mutant and its activation by ADP were comparable with those of the wild type GDH. Gly-456 lies in a very tightly packed region of the GDH molecule, and its replacement by Ala may lead to steric clashes with neighboring amino acids.

Austin B.M. Blumenthal K.M. Nyc J.F. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1975: 293-367Google Scholar). The mature GDH protein is composed of six identical subunits consisting of 505 amino acids each. The enzyme is thought to play a key role in cellular metabolism and energy homeostasis (2Hudson R.C. Daniel R.M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1993; 106: 767-792Crossref Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In the pancreatic β cells, GDH is thought to be involved in insulin secretion mechanisms, whereas in the nervous system the enzyme may play a role in the metabolism of neurotransmitter glutamate and in neurodegenerative processes (3Plaitakis A. Zaganas I. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 66: 899-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar,4Plaitakis A. Berl S. Yahr M.D. Ann. Neurol. 1984; 15: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). GDH in humans exists in two different isoforms: a housekeeping and a nerve tissue-specific isoenzyme encoded by the GLUD1 and theGLUD2 gene, respectively (5Mavrothalassitis G. Tzimagiorgis G.

Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1804-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). GLUD1 contains 13 exons and is located on the 10th chromosome, whereas theGLUD2 gene lacks introns and is X-linked. Mammalian GDH is shown to be allosterically regulated by diverse compounds, such as purine nucleotides, steroid hormones, etc (1Smith E.L. Austin B.M. Blumenthal K.M. Nyc J.F. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1975: 293-367Google Scholar). GDH regulation is of particular biological importance as exemplified by observations showing that regulatory mutations of the GLUD1 GDH are associated with clinical manifestations in children (9Stanley C.A. Lieu Y.K. Hsu B.Y. Burlina A.B. Greenberg C.R. Hopwood N.J. Perlman K. Rich B.H. Zammarchi E. Poncz M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 1352-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Although the two GDH isoenzymes are highly homologous (showing a 97% amino acid identity), they differ markedly in their regulatory properties (8Shashidharan P. Clarke D.D. Ahmed N. Moschonas N. Plaitakis A. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1804-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 10Plaitakis A. Metaxari M. Shashidharan P. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1862-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Thus, while the GLUD1-derived GDH is sensitive to GTP inhibition, the GLUD2 GDH is resistant to this compound. In contrast, the GLUD2 GDH is much more sensitive to allosteric activation by ADP or l-leucine than the GLUD1-derived enzyme (10Plaitakis A. Metaxari M. Shashidharan P. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1862-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In addition, there are significant differences between the two isoforms with respect to theK m values for the substrates of the enzyme. Because the GLUD1- and GLUD2-derived polypeptides share in their mature form all but 15 of their 505 amino acids, these functional differences must arise from amino acid residues that are not common between the two isoenzymes. Our objective is to identify by mutagenesis of the GLUD1 gene these critical residues. In this study, we selected three such residues (Gly-456, Arg-470, and Asn-498) located in the C-terminal region, which is thought to be part of the regulatory domain of mammalian GDH (11Peterson P. Smith T.J. Structure. 1999; 7: 769-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Using site-directed mutagenesis, we created three GLUD1 mutants, each containing one of these amino substitutions. In each of these sites, the amino acid residue present in the GLUD2 GDH replaced the corresponding amino acid of the GLUD1 enzyme. The mutated cDNAs were expressed in Sf21 cells, and the obtained mutant GDH isoproteins were purified to homogeneity and studied with respect to their kinetic and regulatory characteristics. Results showed that substitution of Ala for Gly at position 456 (but not substitution of His for Arg-470 or Ser for Asn-498) of the GLUD1 GDH markedly attenuated GTP inhibition and abolished the cooperative behavior of the enzyme. The G456A substitution did not affect the allosteric activation of the mutant GDH by ADP or its kinetic properties as determined in the absence of allosteric inhibitors. The structural, functional, and evolutionary implications of these findings are discussed. Sf21 cells and the baculovirus expression vectors were obtained from Invitrogen. The media for the Sf21 insect cells and fetal calf serum were obtained from Invitrogen. Modified baculovirus (BaculoGold) was obtained from BD PharMingen (San Diego, CA). NADPH, ADP, GTP (lithium salt), and bovine liver glutamate dehydrogenase were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). Glutamic acid (monosodium salt) was from Sigma. Phenyl-Sepharose high performance was from Amersham Biosciences and hydroxyapatite Bio-Gel HT was from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA). AGLUD1 cDNA, cloned in pBSKII+ vector, was mutagenized at specific sites (Fig. 1) using the Gene Editor Mutagenesis system according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega, Madison, WI). Mutagenic oligonucleotides (25–30 bp in length) were phosphorylated and annealed to the GLUD1template by heating the reaction mixture at 75 °C and then by slowly cooling it (1.5 °C/min) to 37 °C. The annealing reaction also contained primers (provided by the manufacturer) designed to mutate the β-lactamase gene of the pBSKII+ vector. The plasmid was then amplified by T4 DNA polymerase (nicks were ligated by T4 DNA ligase) and used to transform the BMH 71–18 mutS strain ofEscherichia coli (to prevent repair of the newly synthesized strand by the microorganism). The cells were grown in the presence of an appropriate antibiotic selection mix; plasmid DNA was isolated and used to transform the JM109 strain of E. Coli.Clones containing plasmids with the desired mutations were selected by restriction digestion analysis and by DNA sequencing. The mutated GLUD1 cDNA was cleaved from the pBSKII+ vector using BamHI andPstI restriction endonucleases and ligated to the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1393. The ligation products were used to transform the JM109 strain of E. coli. The proper orientation of the insert was verified by sequencing. The subcloned mutated GLUD1 gene was bidirectionally sequenced in its entire length to confirm the presence of the desired mutation and exclude incidental DNA alterations induced during the above mutagenesis steps. DNA sequencing was carried out using the LI-COR 4200 system (LI-COR, Lincoln, Nebraska). Mutated GLUD1cDNAs, along with the wild type GLUD1 cDNA (used here as a control for protein expression and enzymatic analysis), were expressed in Sf21 cells using the baculovirus expression system as previously described (7Shashidharan P.

Cells of the insect Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf21) were co-transfected with the plasmid DNA (pVL1393 vector containing the GLUD1 insert) and modified baculovirus DNA (BaculoGold; BD PharMingen) and incubated at 27 °C for 4–5 days. The virus was amplified by two to three rounds of infection. The cultured cells were harvested 5 days postinfection and used for extracting the recombinant GDH proteins. For this, the cultured cells were homogenized in a buffer containing 0.05m Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 m NaCl. The resulting whole homogenate was centrifuged at 7000 g at 4 °C for 10 min, and the supernatant was used for studies employing crude extracts. Protein determination was done using the Lowry method (12Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Far A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant baculovirus-containing media were used for isolating the viral DNA. Segments of this DNA, containing the corresponding insert were PCR-amplified and sequenced to verify that the desired mutation was present. GDH was purified from Sf21 cell extracts and from human liver obtained at autopsy. About 1 g of liver tissue and 200 × 106 infected Sf21 cells were used for enzyme purification, which was carried out by modification of our previously published method (13Hussain M.M. Zannis V. Plaitakis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20730-20735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The tissues were subjected to two to three cycles of freeze thaw and homogenized (5–10% w/v) in 10 mm Tris-HCI, pH 7.4, buffer containing 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. A 30–55% ammonium sulfate (AS) cut obtained from these extracts was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCI, pH 6.0, buffer containing 15% AS, loaded on a hydrophobic interaction column packed with phenyl-Sepharose high performance (Amersham Biosciences), and equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was eluted with a double gradient of decreasing concentration of AS (15–0%) and increasing concentration of ethylene glycol (0–90%). Eluted GDH was precipitated with 60% AS and passed again through the same phenyl-Sepharose column. Because the G456A mutant has decreased affinity for GTP, we did not employ a GTP binding column (13Hussain M.M. Zannis V. Plaitakis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20730-20735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Instead, we used hydroxyapatite chromatography as previously described (14Colon A.D. Plaitakis A. Perakis A. Berl S. Clarke D.D. J. Neurochem. 1986; 46: 1811-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). For this, fractions from the hydrophobic interaction column containing GDH activity were dialyzed (at 4 °C) against several changes of 100 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm KCl, pH 7.15, buffer and loaded into the hydroxyapatite column (14Colon A.D. Plaitakis A. Perakis A. Berl S. Clarke D.D. J. Neurochem. 1986; 46: 1811-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The column was eluted with a gradient of 10–400 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Purified GDH was used for enzyme assays and for studying its electrophoretic mobility by SDS-PAGE. The latter was done using the Laemmli procedure (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was assayed spectrophotometrically (at 340 nm) in the direction of reductive amination of α-ketoglutarate (10Plaitakis A. Metaxari M. Shashidharan P. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1862-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture of 1 ml contained 50 mmtriethanolamine buffer, pH 8.0, 100 mm ammonium acetate, 100 μm NADPH, and 2.6 mm EDTA. NADH was used instead of NADPH only to test the activity of the endogenous insect cell GDH. Enzyme reaction was initiated by adding α-ketoglutarate to 8 mm (except as indicated). Initial rates (enzyme velocity during the first 30 s after initiation of the reaction) were recorded. Wild type and mutant GLUD1 proteins were studied in parallel. Kinetic analyses were performed to determine the Michaelis-Menten constant (K m ) for α-ketoglutarate and NADPH. Several sets of experiments were performed for each purified enzyme. In each of these experiments, α-ketoglutarate varied from 0.4 to 8.0 mm, while ADP concentration was kept constant at 0 (base line), 25, or 250 μm. NADPH varied from 10 to 100 μm in the absence of ADP. Regulation of the human recombinant GDHs by GTP was studied essentially as previously described (10Plaitakis A. Metaxari M. Shashidharan P. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1862-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) by adding this compound to the reaction mixture at various concentrations (0.025–1000 μm, final concentrations) while keeping the other substrates constant. Also, GTP inhibition was studied in the presence of ADP (0.1 or 1 mm, final concentrations). To study the allosteric activation of recombinant GDHs by ADP, this compound was added to the reaction mixture at various concentrations (varying from 0.01 to 1 mm), while the concentration of the other substrates was kept constant as indicated above. All statistical analyses on the obtained data and plotting were performed by the use of the Origin Program (MicroCal Software, Northampton, MA). K m andV max values were calculated by application of the weighted hyperbolic fit method in the Hyper program (Dr. J. S. Easterby, Dept. of Biochemistry, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK). Differences in kinetic and allosteric behavior were evaluated using Student's t test. IC50 and SC50 values were determined graphically. The Hill plot coefficients for GTP inhibition were calculated according to the method discussed by Cornish-Bowden (16Cornish-Bowden A. Fundamentals of Enzyme Kinetics. Butterworth, London1979: 147-176Crossref Google Scholar). Results were confirmed by the use of the Leonora program (17Cornish-Bowden A. Analysis of Enzyme Kinetic Data. Oxford University Press, New York1995: 133-189Google Scholar). Studies of the structural models of bovine GDH were performed with the use of the RasMol© (version 2.7.1.1, R. Sayle), Swiss-PDBviewer© (version 3.7.b2, N. Guex) and Quanta (Accelerys Inc.) programs. Expression of the G456A, R470H, and N498S GLUD1mutants and the wild type GLUD1 gene in Sf21 cells produced GDH proteins capable of catalyzing the reversible intercoversion of glutamate to α-ketoglutarate in the presence of either NAD(H) or NADP(H). The expressed proteins were about 5-fold enriched over the endogenous insect cell GDH (data not shown). Baculovirus DNA was isolated from culture media of infected cell cultures and sequenced. Results confirmed that the desired mutation for the corresponding mutant GDHs was present in the virus shed by the infected cells. Enzyme assays, carried out with the use of either NADH or NADPH as cofactors, revealed that the non-infected host insect cells contained endogenous GDH showing an absolute specificity for NADH in accordance with results of previous studies (7Shashidharan P. Michaelides T.M. Robakis N.K. Kretsovali A. Papamatheakis J. Plaitakis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16971-16976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the mammalian-expressed enzymes are capable of using both cofactors. Because non-infected insect cells showed zero GDH activity when assayed with the use of NADPH, all enzyme assays of extracts of Sf21 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus were done in the presence of NADPH. This permitted the study of the recombinant human enzymes in crude extracts without the interference of the endogenous insect GDH. Study of the allosteric properties of the produced mutant GDHs (G456A, R470H, and N498S mutants), carried out in crude tissue extracts, revealed that only the G456A mutant exhibited a marked resistance to GTP inhibition (Fig. 2). Under baseline conditions, the IC50 for GTP inhibition was about 15-fold higher for the mutant protein (2.8 μm) as compared with the wild type GLUD1GDH (0.19 μm) (Table I and Fig.3 A). Similar results were obtained when GTP inhibition was studied using reaction mixtures of different pH values (7.0–8.0) (data not shown). Also, the differences in GTP sensitivity between the G456A mutant and the normalGLUD1-derived GDH persisted when GTP inhibition was studied in the presence of ADP (0.1 and 1.0 mm, final concentrations) (Table I and Figs. 2 and 3 B). In addition, the G456A mutation abolished the cooperative behavior of the enzyme either in the presence or absence of ADP. As shown in Figs. 2 and 3, the GTP inhibition of the G456A mutant lacked the characteristic sigmoidal curve of the wild type GLUD1 GDH. Hill plot analysis of the data showed that the Hill coefficient (HC) for GTP inhibition, which for the wild type GLUD1 was 2.09 ± 0.11 − 2.51 ± 0.14, changed to values indicative of non-cooperative behavior for the G456A mutant GDH (HC = 1.07 ± 0.04 − 1.30 ± 0.07) (Table I).Table IAllosteric inhibition of mutant and wild type GLUD1-derived GDHs by GTP in crude extractsIC50Hill coefficient(μm )G456AR470HN498SGLUD1G456AR470HN498SGLUD1No activators2.80 ± 0.151-aIndicates that the IC50 and Hill coefficient values for the G456A mutant are significantly different (p < 0.001) as compared to those of the wild type GLUD1-derived GDH, the R470H mutant, and the N498S mutant.0.17 ± 0.010.20 ± 0.010.19 ± 0.011.12 ± 0.061-aIndicates that the IC50 and Hill coefficient values for the G456A mutant are significantly different (p < 0.001) as compared to those of the wild type GLUD1-derived GDH, the R470H mutant, and the N498S mutant.2.03 ± 0.132.04 ± 0.152.09 ± 0.110.1 mmADP8.98 ± 0.251-aIndicates that the IC50 and Hill coefficient values for the G456A mutant are significantly different (p < 0.001) as compared to those of the wild type GLUD1-derived GDH, the R470H mutant, and the N498S mutant.0.85 ± 0.090.93 ± 0.041.02 ± 0.031.30 ± 0.071-aIndicates that the IC50 and Hill coefficient values for the G456A mutant are significantly different (p < 0.001) as compared to those of the wild type GLUD1-derived GDH, the R470H mutant, and the N498S mutant.2.18 ± 0.112.25 ± 0.112.43 ± 0.131 mmADP79.55 ± 3.671-aIndicates that the IC50 and Hill coefficient values for the G456A mutant are significantly different (p < 0.001) as compared to those of the wild type GLUD1-derived GDH, the R470H mutant, and the N498S mutant.10.48 ± 0.3211.81 ± 0.3912.23 ± 0.541.07 ± 0.041-aIndicates that the IC50 and Hill coefficient values for the G456A mutant are significantly different (p < 0.001) as compared to those of the wild type GLUD1-derived GDH, the R470H mutant, and the N498S mutant.2.65 ± 0.212.37 ± 0.172.51 ± 0.14IC50 values (± S.E.) were determined graphically from the composite inhibitory curve based on at least two independent experiments for each recombinant enzyme.

Fundamentals of Enzyme Kinetics. Butterworth, London1979: 147-176Crossref Google Scholar). In contrast to the G456A mutation, substitution of His for Arg-470 or Ser for Asn-498 did not affect the allosteric regulation of the enzyme by GTP. The IC50 for GTP inhibition for the two mutant GDHs was comparable with that of the wild type GLUD1-derived GDH (Table I, Fig. 3). In addition, the GTP inhibitory curve for both mutants was as sigmoidal as that of the wild typeGLUD1-derived GDH (Fig. 3). Hill plot analyses confirmed that GTP cooperative binding for the R470H and N498S mutants was similar to that for the GLUD1 GDH (Table I and Fig. 3). Substitution of Ala for Gly-456 did not alter the activation pattern of mutant GDHs by ADP. The SC50 values (± S.E.) for the G456A mutant (25.42 ± 2.6 μm) were similar to that of the wild type GLUD1 GDH (24.27 ± 4.12 μm). Comparable SC50 values were also obtained for the R470H (24.66 ± 2.69 μm) and for the N498S mutant (23.41 ± 2.63 μm). The G456A mutant and the wild type recombinant GLUD1 human GDH were studied further after they were purified from cell extracts. As an additional control we used the endogenous human enzyme purified from human liver. Consistent with results of our previous studies (13Hussain M.M. Zannis V. Plaitakis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20730-20735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), about 40–50% of the GDH activity present in the crude tissue extracts was recovered in the purified fractions. SDS-PAGE analysis of GDH-positive fractions eluted from the hydroxyapatite column revealed that the enzyme was more than 95% pure (Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 4, the molecular mass of the G456A mutant was identical to that of the recombinant wild type GLUD1-derived GDH and that of the endogenous mature human liver enzyme. Human liver is known to express the GLUD1 gene only (7Shashidharan P. Michaelides T.M. Robakis N.K. Kretsovali A. Papamatheakis J. Plaitakis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16971-16976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified human GDHs were slightly larger than the commercially available bovine liver GDH used as a marker (Fig. 4). This is consistent with sequencing data showing the bovine liver enzyme is four amino acids shorter than the human GDHs (18Moon K. Smith E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3082-3088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Julliard J.H. Smith E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3427-3438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The GDH-specific activity (measured at 8.0 mmα-ketoglutarate and in the presence of 1 mm ADP) of the purified G456A mutant (133.97 μmol of NADPH oxidized·min−1·mg protein−1) was comparable with that of the recombinant wild typeGLUD1-derived GDH (130.50 μmol of NADPH oxidized·min−1·mg protein−1). Also, the endogenous human liver GDH gave a similar GDH-specific activity (124.56 μmol of NADPH oxidized·min−1·mg protein−1). Kinetic analyses revealed that the K m values for α-ketoglutarate and for NADPH for the purified G456A mutant were similar to those for the purified recombinant wild typeGLUD1 GDH and for the purified endogenous human liver enzyme (Table II). In addition, the maximum velocities (V max) of the three purified human GDHs were comparable (Table II).Table IIKinetic properties of purified mutant and wild type GLUD1-derived GDHs V max2-aV max for the purified enzymes was determined in the presence of 250 μm ADP.

Open table in a new tab GTP inhibition studies performed with the use of the three purified enzymes confirmed the above described data on crude extracts by showing that the purified G456A mutant was markedly resistant to GTP inhibition (IC50 ± S.E. = 121.35 ± 14.89 μm GTP determined in the presence of 1 mm ADP) as compared with the wild type recombinant GLUD1 enzyme (IC50 = 12.95 ± 0.46 μm GTP). The endogenous human liver GDH was as sensitive to GTP inhibition (IC50 = 15.57 ± 0.57) as the recombinant normal GLUD1 enzyme. Hill analyses also confirmed that GTP inhibition of the purified G456A mutant lacked the cooperativity (HC ± S.E. = 0.99 ± 0.07) shown by the purified recombinant wild type GLUD1 GDH (HC = 2.15 ± 0.16) and the purified human liver enzyme (HC = 2.17 ± 0.06) Study of the structure of mammalian GDH based on x-ray crystallography of bovine liver GDH (11Peterson P. Smith T.J. Structure. 1999; 7: 769-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) suggests that Gly-456 of the human GLUD1 enzyme (corresponds to Gly-452 of the bovine protein) lies in a tightly packed region of the molecule (Figs. 5 and 6). Modeling of the introduced Ala-456 side chain suggests that this chain may be in steric clash with the side chain of Phe-387 of the mutant enzyme (corresponds to Phe-383 of the bovine enzyme) (Fig. 5). The estimated distance between Ala-456 and Phe-387 is ∼2.8 Å. This is short enough to indicate a steric clash that may alter the conformation of the Phe-387 side chain, which in turn may affect the nearby Leu-401 (corresponds to Leu-397 of the bovine GDH) side chain from a neighboring subunit. Another steric clash (2.3 Å) apparent from this model is between the Cβ of Ala-456 and the carbonyl oxygen of residue 452 in the human enzyme (corresponds to residue 448 in the bovine sequence). This clash occurs assuming that the main chain angles do not change after replacement of Gly-456 with Ala. The proximity of these residues to the GTP binding site is shown in Fig. 5.Figure 6Location of the introduced mutations. Shown is a cartoon diagram of the C-terminal region of the three subunits of one of the two trimers that compose the GDH hexamer based on x-ray crystallographic data from bovine liver GDH (11Peterson P.

The amino acid numbering of the bovine enzyme (11Peterson P. Smith T.J. Structure. 1999; 7: 769-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) is retained. Each of the three subunits is painted in a different color (green, blue, and light green, respectively). Gly-452 (corresponds to Gly-456 in the human) is shown in red, Arg-466 (corresponds to Arg-470 in the human) is shown in purple, and Asn-494 (corresponds to Asn-498 in the human) is shown in orange, irrespectively of the subunit they belong to. The three bound GTP molecules (one for each subunit) are depicted as ball and stick models in yellow. In the center (asterisk) is shown the interaction of the hinge GTP binding α-helix of one subunit (blue) with the antenna region of the other subunit (green). Gly-452 (corresponds to Gly-456 in the human GLUD1 GDH) lies at this point of interaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To study structure-function relationships in human glutamate dehydrogenase, we performed site-directed mutagenesis in the C-terminal region of the GLUD1 gene. Three residues (Gly-456, Arg-470, and Ser-498) that are different in the GLUD1 as compared with the GLUD2 gene were selected for these studies (Fig.1). Results showed that replacement of Gly by Ala at site 456 markedly attenuates GTP inhibition and abolishes the cooperative behavior of the enzyme without affecting its kinetic properties (in the absence of allosteric inhibitors). In contrast, substitution of His for Arg-470 or substitution of Ser for Asn-498 did not alter significantly either the allosteric regulation or the catalytic properties of the enzyme. Our recombinant human GDHs are processed in the cultured insect cells in a manner similar to that of the mammalian GDH, which involves removal of the 53-amino acid-long leader sequence predicted by theGLUD1 cDNA (5Mavrothalassitis G.

The Gly-456 site studied here lies about a one-and-a-half-α-helix turn away from Lys-450, with the side chain of the former amino acid residue protruding out of the α-helix in the opposite direction than the side chain of the latter according to the proposed structural models (11Peterson P. Smith T.J. Structure. 1999; 7: 769-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Studies based on chemical modification of bovine brain GDH have indicated that Gly-456 of the human GLUD1 GDH (corresponds to Gly-452 of bovine sequence) lies in the vicinity of the GTP binding domain (22Cho S.W. Ahn J.Y. Lee J. Choi S.Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13907-13913Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Structural models of mammalian GDH derived from x-ray crystallographic studies, have suggested that Gly-456 belongs to the α-helix of the GDH protein that comes into direct contact with GTP (11Peterson P. Smith T.J. Structure. 1999; 7: 769-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 23Peterson P. Pierce J. Smith T.J. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 120: 73-77Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 24Smith T.J. Peterson P. Schmidt T. Fang J. Stanley C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 707-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Specifically, Gly-456 is located at the base (“hinge region”) of an “antenna-like” region of GDH, which is thought to be important for the interaction between the subunits of the catalytically active enzyme (11Peterson P. Smith T.J. Structure. 1999; 7: 769-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In its tertiary form, GDH is a hexameric molecule composed of two trimers. Each of the three polypeptide chains of the trimer includes an α-helix to which GTP binds, as noted above. Gly-456 lies exactly at the point where the GTP-binding α-helix of one subunit comes in direct contact with the antenna-like region of the other (Figs. 5 and6). As described under “Results,” introduction of Ala-456 side chain occurs in a tightly packed region of the molecule, and this may lead to steric clashes with other side chains (Fig. 5). These disturbances may impair the ability of the antenna to facilitate intersubunit communication, a process that may be essential for GTP inhibition and cooperative effects (11Peterson P. Smith T.J. Structure. 1999; 7: 769-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In contrast to the G456A mutation, substitution of His for Arg-470 or of Ser for Asn-498 did not affect the properties of theGLUD1-derived GDH. Arg-470 is located on the surface of the protein (Fig. 6) where it does not appear to interact with other amino acids. Also, Asn-498 is not located in a tightly packed region of the GDH molecule; its only possible interaction is with Arg-48 (corresponds to Arg-44 in the bovine) (Fig. 5), and as such, the present results suggest that this interaction may not be essential for enzymatic function.

GTP inhibition of the mutant proteins, expressed in COS cells or in cultured patient lymphoblasts, was found to be attenuated (the IC50 increased 2–6-fold). The Gly-456 residue studied here, lies immediately downstream of the amino acid residues encoded by the 11th and 12th exons of the GLUD1 gene and which are altered by these spontaneous mutations. There is evidence that in the human the GLUD1 gene (located on the 10th chromosome) has been retro-posed to the X chromosome, where it gave rise to the GLUD2 gene through random mutations and natural selection. Previous functional analyses of the two GDH-specific genes have suggested that the GLUD2 gene might have adapted to particular needs of the nervous system where it is specifically expressed (3Plaitakis A. Zaganas I. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 66: 899-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The nerve tissue-specific GDH (GLUD2-derived) that is resistant to GTP inhibition differs at its C-terminal region in three positions (amino acid residues 456, 470, and 498) from theGLUD1 GDH, which is GTP-sensitive (Fig. 1). Our functional analysis showed that only substitution of Ala for Gly-456 is sufficient to confer resistance to GTP. This resistance may permit the nerve tissue-specific GDH to function in the GTP-rich environment that prevails in the nervous tissue. The present data, however, indicate that the presence of Ala instead of Gly at position 456 in the GLUD2 GDH is not sufficient to explain other functional differences that exist between this and theGLUD1 GDH. These include: a diminished catalytic activity ofGLUD2 isoenzyme in the absence of allosteric activators and a marked sensitivity of this isoenzyme to ADP and tol-leucine activation (8Shashidharan P.

First, cloning would undermine our sense of individuality or uniqueness. But it could only undermine our genetic uniqueness, not our full individuality. Second, cloning would undermine the value or worth of human beings. But it would not make individuals replaceable or of any less moral worth. Third, a clone's freedom or autonomy to construct his or her own life would be undermined by the presence of an earlier twin.

The general structure of these membrane proteins includes two membrane spanning domains, each consisting of six transmembrane segments, and two nucleotide binding folds (NBF1 and NBF2).

However, unlike the other members of this family, CFTR contains a unique regulatory (R) domain, and encodes a cAMP-regulated chloride channel (6Bear C.E., Li, C. Kartner N. Bridges R.J. Jensen T.J.

Thus, electrostatic and/or allosteric changes mediated by phosphorylation are likely responsible for interactions between the R domain and other CFTR domains that regulate channel function (15Ma J.

The open probability of ΔR-CFTR is one-third that of the wild type (wt) CFTR channel and does not increase upon PKA phosphorylation, although other biophysical properties of the channel (i.e. conductance and anion selectivity) are similar to wt-CFTR (18Ma J.

These data suggest that deletion of the R domain removes both inhibitory and stimulatory effects conferred by the R domain on CFTR chloride channel function. In support of this suggestion, addition of exogenous unphosphorylated R domain protein (amino acids 588–858) to wt-CFTR blocks the chloride channel (20Ma J. Tasch J.E. Tao T. Zhao J. Xie J.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), and the block is relieved if the R domain becomes phosphorylated, indicating that the unphosphorylated R domain is inhibitory. Conversely, exogenous phosphorylated R domain protein (amino acids 588–855 or 645–834) stimulates the ΔR-CFTR channel, suggesting that the phosphorylated R domain is stimulatory (18Ma J. Zhao J.

Nature. 1997; 389: 294-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears that the phosphorylation state of the R domain determines whether it functions to stimulate or inhibit chloride channel activity.In this work we identify a stretch of negatively charged amino acids at the carboxyl terminus of the R domain (817–838, NEG2), with a net charge of −9, which appears to be involved in both the stimulatory and inhibitory functions of the R domain on chloride channel activity. Furthermore, by modifying the sequence of this peptide, we were able to separate its stimulatory and inhibitory functions.DISCUSSIONThe R domain of CFTR contains two negatively charged regions, amino acids 725–733 (NEG1) and amino acids 817–838 (NEG2) which reside in close proximity to two PKA phosphorylation sites, Ser737 and Ser813, that are used in vivo (9Rich D.P.

One amino acid substitution, noted in a patient with CF, is reported in the CF Mutation Consortium data base in the NEG1 region (E725K). Three mutations are reported in the NEG2 region (E822K, E826K, and D836Y), two of which were obtained from patients with cystic fibrosis (E822K and D836Y). Single channel studies of E822K and E826K indicate that both mutations result in reducedP o compared with wt-CFTR (34Vankeerberghen A. Wei L. Jaspers M. Cassiman J.-J. Nilius B. Cuppens H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1761-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Moreover, Cotten and Welsh (35Cotten J.F. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25617-25622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) showed that N-ethylmaleimide modification of a cysteine residue in the NEG2 region (C832) produced irreversible stimulation of PKA-phosphorylated CFTR channel activity. The NEG2 region is highly conserved among species. Taken together, these data indicate the importance of this portion of the R domain for the regulation of the CFTR channel. Our data demonstrate that the NEG2 region of CFTR can both stimulate and inhibit chloride channel function. When this region is deleted from CFTR, the resultant channel opens without PKA, indicating loss of inhibitory function, but theP o never achieves that of wt-CFTR, and does not increase when phosphorylated with PKA, indicating a loss of stimulatory function. In support of a dual action for the NEG2 sequence, addition of the NEG2 sequence as a synthetic peptide to the intracellular side of the CFTR channel results in stimulation of channel openings at lower concentrations, but inhibition of channel activity at higher concentrations.Stimulatory and inhibitory activities can be separated by sequence modifications. Inhibition alone is evident with peptides designed to retain the negative charge but disrupt the helical tendencies. Conversely, stimulation occurs with a peptide designed to retain and enhance the helical structure of the sequence, but to reduce the negative charge. Molecular modeling reveals an amphipathic feature of the NEG2 sequence, i.e. the negatively charged residues mostly line up as a barber-pole stripe on the α-helix. The surrounding residues are mostly hydrophobic. We speculate that the NEG2 sequence, presented in different ways, could interact with CFTR at different sites to either stimulate or inhibit channel openings. Which function the NEG2 sequence performs might be determined by how it is presented in the context of the intact molecule, which could be entrained, at least in part, by the phosphorylation state of the R domain. In this model, phosphorylated R domain favors presentation of the hydrophobic stripe of the helical conformation of NEG2 to the stimulatory site, whereas the unphosphorylated R domain favors access of the negative charge in NEG2 to an inhibitory site. Since the mechanism of increasing channel activity appears to be, both for NEG2 and for h-NEG2i, mainly by increasing the number of channel openings, we speculate that the stimulatory activity might result from peptide binding increasing either binding or hydrolysis of ATP, probably at the first nucleotide-binding domain, which is often assigned the role of channel opening (36Carson M.R. Travis S.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1711-1717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar).When the exogenous NEG2 peptide is added to the intracellular side of the wt-CFTR channel, it could interact with either the stimulatory site or the inhibitory site, and it may compete with the endogenous sequence for access to these sites. The degree and duration of stimulation or inhibition by exogenous peptide will depend on the on and off rates at the stimulatory site and the inhibitory site, the effective concentration of the relevant structural form of the peptide, and competition from endogenous sequences (either the NEG2 sequence itself, or sequences at other sites) at those two sites. When the channel is closed, as it is most of the time even in the phosphorylated state (since the P o is only about 30%), the endogenous site for inhibition may often be occupied by the endogenous NEG2 sequence, and thus binding of the exogenous peptide is favored at the stimulatory site. However, as stimulation increases, the inhibitory site may become more available, and eventually binding occurs at this site, and the channel is inhibited.Naren and co-workers (37Naren A.P. Cormet-Boyaka E., Fu, J. Villain M. Blalock J.E. Quick M.W. Kirk K.L. Science. 1999; 286: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) reported that a sequence in the NH2 terminus of CFTR interacts with sequences in the proximal end of the R domain to increase CFTR channel activity. This work, taken together with the work reported here, is consistent with our earlier studies of segments of the R domain which inhibit channel function (21Tasch J.E. Zerhusen B. Zhao J., Ma, J. Davis P.B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Two segments, one containing amino acids 588–805 and the other, amino acids 672–855, proved inhibitory. The first segment may inhibit channel activity by interacting with the stimulatory NH2-terminal sequence in CFTR, preventing it from interacting with its target in the R domain, thereby preventing channel stimulation. The second inhibitory segment contains the NEG2 sequence, and probably inhibits channel openings by presenting NEG2 to its inhibitory site. It is intriguing that the binding portion of the NH2 terminus, which stimulates channel activity, appears to be a helical segment of the protein with one negatively charged face, and its activity is abrogated by reducing the negative charges in this segment (38Fu J., Ji, H-L. Naren A.P. Kirk K.L. J. Physiol. 2001; 536: 459-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This observation reinforces the concept that negatively charged sequences may exert profound regulatory influence on channel activity.A recent study by Baldursson et al. (39Baldursson O. Ostedgaard L.S. Rokhlina T. Cotton J.F. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1904-1910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) found that deletion of amino acids 760–783 in the R domain resulted in CFTR channel activity in the absence of PKA phosphorylation; however, deletion of amino acids 784 to 835, which includes most of the NEG2 sequence, did not allow the channel to open without phosphorylation. It may be that the two deletion mutants delete the NEG2 sequence in whole or in part, ours (ΔNEG2(817–838)-CFTR) and that of Baldursson et al.(39Baldursson O. Ostedgaard L.S. Rokhlina T. Cotton J.F.

Chem. 2001; 276: 1904-1910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) (Δ(784–835)-CFTR), assume different conformations compared with the native CFTR molecule and thus may behave differently in channel function. Baldursson's (39Baldursson O. Ostedgaard L.S. Rokhlina T. Cotton J.F. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1904-1910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) construct deletes 33 more amino acids (amino acids 783–816, including a putative PKC-phosphorylation site (Ser790)) than our ΔNEG2-CFTR construct. Since PKC phosphorylation has an essential role in PKA phosphorylation-dependent regulation of the CFTR channel (40Jia Y. Mathew C.J. Hanrahan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4978-4984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), removal of this site may alter channel regulation. The potential role of PKC phosphorylation on the Δ(784–835)-CFTR and Δ(817–838)-CFTR remains to be studied. It is also possible that the R domain contains more than one inhibitory site, or both identified segments of R domain sequences (760–783 and 817–838) could act together to inhibit the unphosphorylated CFTR channel, and the lack of either one disrupts the inhibitory function of the R domain. King and Sorscher (41King S.A. Sorscher E.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9869-9875Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar) also identify the COOH-terminal portion of the R domain (amino acids 723–836, which includes both the putative inhibitory sequences) as crucial in conferring PKA regulation on the channel.Future studies to identify the sites of NEG2 interaction within the CFTR molecule should provide new insights into the regulation of the CFTR channel. Particularly, understanding the stimulatory interaction of NEG2 may facilitate the design of therapeutics to stimulate the CFTR opening to treat patients whose mutant forms of CFTR reach the cell surface.

When this region is deleted from CFTR, the resultant channel opens without PKA, indicating loss of inhibitory function, but theP o never achieves that of wt-CFTR, and does not increase when phosphorylated with PKA, indicating a loss of stimulatory function. In support of a dual action for the NEG2 sequence, addition of the NEG2 sequence as a synthetic peptide to the intracellular side of the CFTR channel results in stimulation of channel openings at lower concentrations, but inhibition of channel activity at higher concentrations.Stimulatory and inhibitory activities can be separated by sequence modifications. Inhibition alone is evident with peptides designed to retain the negative charge but disrupt the helical tendencies. Conversely, stimulation occurs with a peptide designed to retain and enhance the helical structure of the sequence, but to reduce the negative charge. Molecular modeling reveals an amphipathic feature of the NEG2 sequence, i.e. the negatively charged residues mostly line up as a barber-pole stripe on the α-helix. The surrounding residues are mostly hydrophobic. We speculate that the NEG2 sequence, presented in different ways, could interact with CFTR at different sites to either stimulate or inhibit channel openings. Which function the NEG2 sequence performs might be determined by how it is presented in the context of the intact molecule, which could be entrained, at least in part, by the phosphorylation state of the R domain. In this model, phosphorylated R domain favors presentation of the hydrophobic stripe of the helical conformation of NEG2 to the stimulatory site, whereas the unphosphorylated R domain favors access of the negative charge in NEG2 to an inhibitory site. Since the mechanism of increasing channel activity appears to be, both for NEG2 and for h-NEG2i, mainly by increasing the number of channel openings, we speculate that the stimulatory activity might result from peptide binding increasing either binding or hydrolysis of ATP, probably at the first nucleotide-binding domain, which is often assigned the role of channel opening (36Carson M.R. Travis S.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1711-1717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar).When the exogenous NEG2 peptide is added to the intracellular side of the wt-CFTR channel, it could interact with either the stimulatory site or the inhibitory site, and it may compete with the endogenous sequence for access to these sites. The degree and duration of stimulation or inhibition by exogenous peptide will depend on the on and off rates at the stimulatory site and the inhibitory site, the effective concentration of the relevant structural form of the peptide, and competition from endogenous sequences (either the NEG2 sequence itself, or sequences at other sites) at those two sites. When the channel is closed, as it is most of the time even in the phosphorylated state (since the P o is only about 30%), the endogenous site for inhibition may often be occupied by the endogenous NEG2 sequence, and thus binding of the exogenous peptide is favored at the stimulatory site. However, as stimulation increases, the inhibitory site may become more available, and eventually binding occurs at this site, and the channel is inhibited.Naren and co-workers (37Naren A.P.

Science. 1999; 286: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) reported that a sequence in the NH2 terminus of CFTR interacts with sequences in the proximal end of the R domain to increase CFTR channel activity. This work, taken together with the work reported here, is consistent with our earlier studies of segments of the R domain which inhibit channel function (21Tasch J.E. Zerhusen B. Zhao J., Ma, J. Davis P.B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Two segments, one containing amino acids 588–805 and the other, amino acids 672–855, proved inhibitory. The first segment may inhibit channel activity by interacting with the stimulatory NH2-terminal sequence in CFTR, preventing it from interacting with its target in the R domain, thereby preventing channel stimulation. The second inhibitory segment contains the NEG2 sequence, and probably inhibits channel openings by presenting NEG2 to its inhibitory site. It is intriguing that the binding portion of the NH2 terminus, which stimulates channel activity, appears to be a helical segment of the protein with one negatively charged face, and its activity is abrogated by reducing the negative charges in this segment (38Fu J., Ji, H-L. Naren A.P. Kirk K.L. J. Physiol. 2001; 536: 459-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This observation reinforces the concept that negatively charged sequences may exert profound regulatory influence on channel activity.A recent study by Baldursson et al. (39Baldursson O.

It may be that the two deletion mutants delete the NEG2 sequence in whole or in part, ours (ΔNEG2(817–838)-CFTR) and that of Baldursson et al.(39Baldursson O. Ostedgaard L.S. Rokhlina T. Cotton J.F.

Since PKC phosphorylation has an essential role in PKA phosphorylation-dependent regulation of the CFTR channel (40Jia Y. Mathew C.J. Hanrahan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4978-4984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), removal of this site may alter channel regulation. The potential role of PKC phosphorylation on the Δ(784–835)-CFTR and Δ(817–838)-CFTR remains to be studied. It is also possible that the R domain contains more than one inhibitory site, or both identified segments of R domain sequences (760–783 and 817–838) could act together to inhibit the unphosphorylated CFTR channel, and the lack of either one disrupts the inhibitory function of the R domain. King and Sorscher (41King S.A. Sorscher E.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9869-9875Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar) also identify the COOH-terminal portion of the R domain (amino acids 723–836, which includes both the putative inhibitory sequences) as crucial in conferring PKA regulation on the channel.Future studies to identify the sites of NEG2 interaction within the CFTR molecule should provide new insights into the regulation of the CFTR channel. Particularly, understanding the stimulatory interaction of NEG2 may facilitate the design of therapeutics to stimulate the CFTR opening to treat patients whose mutant forms of CFTR reach the cell surface. The R domain of CFTR contains two negatively charged regions, amino acids 725–733 (NEG1) and amino acids 817–838 (NEG2) which reside in close proximity to two PKA phosphorylation sites, Ser737 and Ser813, that are used in vivo (9Rich D.P.

One amino acid substitution, noted in a patient with CF, is reported in the CF Mutation Consortium data base in the NEG1 region (E725K). Three mutations are reported in the NEG2 region (E822K, E826K, and D836Y), two of which were obtained from patients with cystic fibrosis (E822K and D836Y). Single channel studies of E822K and E826K indicate that both mutations result in reducedP o compared with wt-CFTR (34Vankeerberghen A. Wei L. Jaspers M. Cassiman J.-J. Nilius B. Cuppens H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1761-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Moreover, Cotten and Welsh (35Cotten J.F. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25617-25622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) showed that N-ethylmaleimide modification of a cysteine residue in the NEG2 region (C832) produced irreversible stimulation of PKA-phosphorylated CFTR channel activity. The NEG2 region is highly conserved among species. Taken together, these data indicate the importance of this portion of the R domain for the regulation of the CFTR channel. Our data demonstrate that the NEG2 region of CFTR can both stimulate and inhibit chloride channel function. When this region is deleted from CFTR, the resultant channel opens without PKA, indicating loss of inhibitory function, but theP o never achieves that of wt-CFTR, and does not increase when phosphorylated with PKA, indicating a loss of stimulatory function.

Quick heme a reduction precedes the biphasic heme a3reduction, which is extremely slow in the K354M mutant (k 1 = 0.09 ± 0.01 s−1;k 2 = 0.005 ± 0.001 s−1) but much faster in the D124N aa 3(k 1 = 21 ± 6 s−1;k 2 = 2.2 ± 0.5 s−1). NO causes a very large increase (>100-fold) in the rate constant of heme a3 reduction in the K354M mutant but only a ∼5-fold increase in the D124N mutant. The K354M enzyme reacts rapidly with O2 when fully reduced but is essentially inactive in turnover; thus, it was proposed that impaired reduction of the active site is the cause of activity loss. Since at saturating [NO], heme a3 reduction is ∼100-fold faster than the extremely low turnover rate, we conclude that, contrary to O2, NO can react not only with the two-electron but also with the single-electron reduced active site. This mechanism would account for the efficient inhibition of cytochrome oxidase activity by NO in the wild-type enzyme, both from P. denitrificans and from beef heart.

Cytochrome c oxidase (CcOX)1 contains a bimetallic active site (heme a3-CuB) where O2is reduced to H2O. This exergonic reaction is coupled to an active translocation of protons, generating a proton-motive force used for ATP synthesis (see Refs. 1Michel H.

Complete reduction of the heme a3-CuB center, a prerequisite for the reaction with O2, occurs via intramolecular electron transfer from heme a, which in turn is reduced by CuA, the metal center accepting electrons from cytochrome c.

In the reductive part, two electrons are sequentially transferred to the fully oxidized heme a3-CuB center called O, yielding the two-electron reduced site R via a single-electron reduced intermediate E. In the oxidative part, upon reaction with O2, R restores the fully oxidized enzymeO, by populating the O2 intermediatesP and F (depending on the redox state of heme a, two different P intermediates are formed, calledPM andPR ). The idea that theO → R process is the rate-determining step in the overall catalytic cycle is gaining further support (6Malatesta F. Sarti P. Antonini G. Vallone B. Brunori M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

This reduction block is presumably due to an impaired H+ transfer in the K354M mutant, consistent with the loss of the millisecond phase in laser-triggered reverse electron transfer experiments observed with the analogous mutant of the R. sphaeroides enzyme (15Ädelroth P.

In contrast, Verkhovsky et al. (18Verkhovsky M.I. Tuukkanen A. Backgren C. Puustinen A. Wikström M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7077-7083Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) proposed that an H+ uptake through the K pathway controls the single-electron reduction of heme a3-CuB(O → E), impaired in the K354M mutant, whereas the formation of the two-electron reduced active site (E →R) would be coupled to an H+ uptake through the D pathway, as deduced from data on the inactive D124N mutant (17Wikström M. Jasaitis A. Backgren C. Puustinen A. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 514-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The first of the two protons taken upon reduction of the active site has been proposed to charge-compensate the reduction of CuB in the single-electron reduced active site via protonation of a putative OH− bound to this metal in the oxidized state (1Michel H.

As assessed by the flow-flash technique using the R. sphaeroides CcOX analogous to the K354M mutant, the fully reduced enzyme exposed to O2 becomes fully oxidized within ∼5 ms (15Ädelroth P. Gennis R.B. Brzezinski P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2470-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), although without the formation of PR (13Brändén M. Sigurdson H. Namslauer A. Gennis R.B.

The loss of oxidase activity associated to the K354M mutation has been therefore assigned to the extremely slow formation of R (9, 11, 14), which is a prerequisite for the reaction with O2.Differently from O2, NO has been suggested to bind not only to R (19) but also to a single-electron reduced intermediateE (20, 21). This hypothesis, raised to account for the very low apparent K i for NO inhibition, although consistent with computer simulations (20Torres J. Darley-Usmar V.M. Wilson M.T. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 21Giuffrè A. Sarti P. D'Itri E. Buse G. Soulimane T. Brunori M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33404-33408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), is not yet supported by direct experimental evidence. In this report, we provide evidence for the reaction of NO with E by studying the kinetics of reduction of the K354M and D124N mutants of P. denitrificansCcOX in the presence of NO.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDodecyl-β-d-maltoside was purchased from Biomol(Hamburg, Germany); ascorbate, glucose oxidase, and catalase were purchased from Sigma; and ruthenium(III) hexamine was purchased from Aldrich. Stock solutions of NO (Air Liquide, Paris, France) were prepared by equilibrating degassed water with the pure gas at 1 atm ([NO] = 2 mm at 20 °C).The K354M and D124N mutants of cytochrome c oxidase fromP. denitrificans were purified according to Ref. 22Hendler R.W. Pardhasaradhi K. Reynafarje B. Ludwig B. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 415-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar and stored at −80 °C. Before use, the enzymes were equilibrated by dialysis (at 4 °C for at least 5 h) with the buffer used in the experiments (100 mm K+/phosphate, pH 7.0, + 0.1% dodecyl maltoside or 35 mm K+/phosphate, pH 7.0, + 50 mm KCl + 0.1% dodecyl maltoside). Cytochrome oxidase concentration is expressed in terms of functional units (aa 3) using the extinction coefficient Δεred-ox, 444 = 156 mm−1cm−1.Stopped-flow experiments were carried out with a DX.17MV Applied Photophysics instrument equipped with a diode array (Leatherhead, UK). The mixing apparatus allows rapid mixing of equal volumes of solutions either in a simple or a sequential mode; in the latter mode, two solutions are premixed, and after a preset delay, they are mixed again with another solution. The instrument has a 1-cm light path and can acquire absorption spectra with an acquisition time of 2.5 ms. In a typical experiment, ascorbate (80 mm) and ruthenium hexamine (4 mm) are premixed with N2-equilibrated buffer (with or without NO), and the resulting solution is mixed after a 100-ms delay with degassed oxidized CcOX at 20 °C. This protocol prevents prolonged incubation of reductants with NO. Contaminant oxygen was scavenged with glucose and catalytic amounts of glucose oxidase and catalase. After the second mixing, absorption spectra were collected as a function of time according to a logarithmic scale. Data analysis was carried out using the software MATLAB (The MathWorks, South Natick, MA). Spectral smoothing and deconvolution were performed by using the singular value decomposition (SVD) algorithm according to Henry and Hofrichter (23Henry E.R. Hofrichter J. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 129-192Crossref Scopus (599) Google Scholar) or by the pseudoinverse algorithm.The stoichiometry of NO binding to the K354M CcOX has been measured according to Stubauer et al. (24Stubauer G. Giuffrè A. Brunori M. Sarti P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) by using a NO-selective Clark-type electrode (ISO-NO, World Precision Instruments). The electrode is calibrated using aliquots of NO-saturated water added to the degassed buffer and, after the addition of CcOX, the concentration of NO in solution is monitored.RESULTSIn the present investigation, we studied by stopped-flow spectrophotometry the kinetics of reduction of the K354M and the D124N mutants of the P. denitrificans CcOX both in the presence and in the absence of NO. As shown in Fig.1, the K354M mutation yields a dramatic decrease in the rate of heme a3 reduction, consistent with the literature (9Hosler J.P. Shapleigh J.P. Mitchell D.M. Kim Y. Pressler M.A. Georgiou C. Babcock G.T. Alben J.O. Ferguson-Miller S. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10776-10783Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 11Jünemann S. Meunier B. Gennis R.B.

Acta. 2000; 1459: 514-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Upon mixing anaerobically oxidized K354M CcOX with a large excess of ascorbate and ruthenium hexamine, heme a reduction is very fast (∼7 ms), whereas reduction of heme a3 is extremely slow (>500 s, Fig. 1 A). SVD analysis of the latter process shows a single significant optical component (corresponding to the reduced minus oxidized heme a3 spectrum), displaying a biphasic time course (Fig.1 C). Best fit of the time course yieldsk 1 = 0.09 ± 0.01 s−1 andk 2 = 0.005 ± 0.001 s−1 for the two phases, accounting for ∼30 and 70% of the total amplitude, respectively. We cannot exclude that the intrinsic reduction rate might be even slower than observed given that over the very long time scale explored (500 s), the high intensity light beam of the diode array instrument causes partial enzyme reduction even in the absence of reductants (data not shown). In agreement with others (5Pfitzner U. Odenwald A. Ostermann T. Weingard L. Ludwig B. Richter O.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 9Hosler J.P. Shapleigh J.P. Mitchell D.M. Kim Y. Pressler M.A. Georgiou C. Babcock G.T. Alben J.O. Ferguson-Miller S. Gennis R.B.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14456-14464Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), we conclude that the very slow heme a3 reduction may account for the extremely slow turnover observed with O2(∼0.02 mol of O2/mol of CcOX × s at 170 μm cytochrome c)A different scenario is observed when the reduction of the K354M CcOX is carried out in the presence of NO (Fig. 1 B). In these experiments, the stopped-flow apparatus was used in the sequential mixing mode to prevent the prolonged incubation of NO with the reductants in the stopped-flow syringe to avoid NO loss (see “Experimental Procedures”). At 500 μm NO (concentration after mixing), heme a reduction is again complete within a few milliseconds. In this case, however, the end point species (i.e. the fully reduced enzyme with NO bound to heme a3) is already populated after about 10 s, indicating a much faster internal electron transfer in the presence of NO. SVD analysis of the absorption spectra collected from 7 ms up to 10 s reveals only a single optical component corresponding to the [heme a32+-NO]-[heme a33+] difference spectrum, indicating that NO binding is rate-limited by (and thus, apparently synchronous with) heme a3 reduction. Analysis of the time course in Fig. 1 C shows that the time course of heme a32+-NO formation is biphasic with rate constants of k 1 = ∼8.9 s−1 andk 2 = ∼0.6 s−1, the two phases having similar amplitude. Thus, NO seems not to interfere with heme a reduction (very fast both with and without NO) but clearly drives heme a3 reduction, which occurs in the presence of NO at least 100-fold faster than in its absence (Fig. 1 C).The experiments reported above were extended to the D124N mutant (Fig. 2). In the latter mutant, similarly to the K354M mutant, the reduction of heme a is fast both in the presence and in the absence of NO, being complete within a few milliseconds after mixing with reductant (Fig. 2, A andB). In agreement with the literature (17Wikström M. Jasaitis A. Backgren C. Puustinen A. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 514-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), the enzyme is completely reduced within a few seconds even in the absence of NO (compare Figs. 1 A and 2 A), and thus, heme a3 reduction is much faster than in the case of the K354M mutant. Also, for the D124N mutant, heme a3 reduction is biphasic with k 1 = 21 ± 6 s−1and k 2 = 2.2 ± 0.5 s−1(relative amplitudes ∼70 and 30%, respectively). Complete reduction of the D124N mutant is accelerated in the presence of NO (Fig.2 B) and, for instance, at 500 μm NO, the formation of the heme a32+-NO complex proceeds at k 1 = 74 ± 11 s−1and k 2 = 3.6 ± 1.6 s−1(relative amplitudes ∼60 and 40%, respectively). Thus, we conclude that in both mutants, the addition of NO increases the rate of internal electron transfer; however, this increase corresponds to a factor of ∼5 for the D124N mutant and to >100-fold in the K354M mutant. This result is better visualized in Fig.3, in which the two observed rate constants of heme a3 reduction for both mutants are reported at different NO concentrations (from 0 to 500 μm). The data show that internal electron transfer in the D124N mutant is faster than in the K354M mutant. Moreover, in both mutants, the two rate constants (relative to the fast and the slow kinetic phases) depend on the NO concentration. Although the dependence is much less pronounced in the D124N mutant, all rate constants become essentially independent of [NO], reaching plateau values atk 1 = 13 ± 6 s−1 andk 2 = 0.7 ± 0.3 s−1 in the K354M mutant and k 1 = 110 ± 16 s−1 and k 2 = 3.5 ± 1.5 s−1 in the D124N mutant. All asymptotic values are independent of reductant concentration, as assessed by experiments at 500 μm NO and variable ruthenium hexamine concentration; at ruthenium hexamine concentrations above 1 mm (after mixing), the observed rate constants were independent of reductant concentration.Figure 2Reduction of the D124N aa3 and the effect of NO. The oxidized D124N mutant of the P. denitrificans cytochrome oxidase is anaerobically mixed with reductants in the absence (A) and in the presence of NO (B). Experimental conditions are as described in the legend for Fig. 1. A and B, similar to the K354Maa 3, heme a reduction is complete within a few milliseconds, independently of NO. Afterward, complete reduction of the enzyme is achieved within a few seconds in the absence of NO (A) and on an even shorter time scale in the presence of NO (B). C, time courses of heme a3reduction as obtained by the pseudoinverse analysis. In the absence of NO, heme a3 is reduced with rate constants ofk 1 = 15 s−1 (60% total amplitude) and k 2 = 2.7 s−1 (40% total amplitude). At 500 μm NO, heme a3 reduction is faster and proceeds with rate constants of k 1= 78 s−1 (60% total amplitude) andk 2 = 5.1 s−1 (40% total amplitude).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Effect of NO concentration. Rate constants of heme a3 reduction, relative to the fast (top) and the slow (bottom) phases, were measured at varying NO concentrations. Experimental conditions were as described in the legend for Fig. 1. Under all conditions, internal electron transfer in the D124N mutant is faster than in the K354M mutant. Both rate constants depend on the NO concentration, although the dependence is much less pronounced in the D124N mutant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It is worth noticing that the faster heme a3 reduction observed with both mutants in the presence of NO is not due to direct reduction of the oxidized binuclear center O by NO. As demonstrated with beef heart CcOX and confirmed with the P. denitrificans wild-type CcOX, the reaction of NO with Ooccurs rapidly with the chloride-free enzyme, yielding nitrite-bound heme a3 and reduced heme a (25Cooper C.E. Torres J. Sharpe M.A. Wilson M.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), but it is prevented with the chloride-bound oxidase (26Giuffrè A. Stubauer G. Brunori M. Sarti P. Torres J. Wilson M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32475-32478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Spectrophotometrically, we did not detect a reaction after mixing both oxidized mutants with NO (1 mm after mixing, not shown). Further in this respect, the reactivity of NO with the oxidized K354M oxidase was probed by amperometry by using a NO-selective Clark-type electrode (24Stubauer G. Giuffrè A. Brunori M. Sarti P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). If the oxidized enzyme is anaerobically added to a degassed NO-containing solution, a reaction would be detected as a decrease in the NO concentration. Upon the addition of oxidized K354M CcOX (0.4 μm) to a solution containing NO (1 μm), only a small decrease in the NO concentration (∼0.2 mol of NO/mol of oxidase) was detected; in contrast, a stoichiometric (1:1) NO binding was observed after the addition of the fully reduced enzyme, as shown for the mammalian CcOX (24Stubauer G. Giuffrè A. Brunori M. Sarti P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We therefore conclude that both theP. denitrificans mutants tested in this study are in the chloride-bound state, due to the presence of chloride in the buffers used during both the purification and the experiments.DISCUSSIONNO is a very efficient, yet reversible, inhibitor of cytochromec oxidase activity (27Brown G.C. Cooper C.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar, 28Cleeter M.W.J. Cooper J.M. Darley-Usmar V.M. Moncada S. Schapira A.H.V. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 50-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar), leading to the proposal that it may act as a physiological modulator of cell respiration (29Brown G.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 136-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Since both NO and O2 react with the fully reduced heme a3-CuB center R with high affinity and similar rates (19Gibson Q.H. Greenwood C. Biochem. J. 1963; 86: 541-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), the small inhibition constantK i determined with mitochondrial CcOX in turnover (K i = 270 nm NO at [O2] = 140 μm, (27Brown G.C. Cooper C.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar)) was somewhat puzzling. To account for this observation, it was proposed that NO can react with a single-electron reduced active site E (20–21), which is known to be unreactive toward O2. Such a hypothesis is consistent with computer simulations (20Torres J. Darley-Usmar V.M. Wilson M.T. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 21Giuffrè A. Sarti P.

The kinetics of reduction of the K354M mutant ofP. denitrificans in the presence of NO, reported above, provides evidence that this hypothesis is correct.The K354M mutation is associated with the loss of oxidase activity (5Pfitzner U. Odenwald A. Ostermann T. Weingard L. Ludwig B. Richter O.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 9Hosler J.P. Shapleigh J.P. Mitchell D.M. Kim Y.

Rich P.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14456-14464Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), although this mutant in the fully reduced state (R) is very quickly (∼5 ms) oxidized by O2, as reported for the R. sphaeroides CcOX (15, but see also Ref.13Brändén M. Sigurdson H. Namslauer A. Gennis R.B. Ädelroth P. Brzezinski P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5013-5018Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The same mutation has a dramatic effect on the reductive part of the catalytic cycle, and the extremely low rate of reduction of heme a3 was correlated to the marginal turnover rate (9Hosler J.P. Shapleigh J.P. Mitchell D.M. Kim Y. Pressler M.A. Georgiou C. Babcock G.T. Alben J.O. Ferguson-Miller S. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10776-10783Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 11Jünemann S. Meunier B. Gennis R.B. Rich P.R.

It was therefore assumed that in this mutant, the turnover with O2 is rate-limited by the extremely slow formation ofR, which is an obligatory intermediate in the catalytic cycle. This is consistent with the widely accepted idea that O2 can react exclusively with the two-electron reduced heme a3-CuB site, like CO.The novel result reported in this study on the K354M mutant of P. denitrificans CcOX is that, in the presence of NO, the reduction of heme a3 occurs at a rate much faster (>100-fold) than in its absence and much faster than the extremely low turnover rate of this mutant with O2 (Fig. 1). This effect depends on NO concentration and is maximal at [NO] >100 μm (Fig. 3), at which the reduction of heme a3 proceeds at rates (k 1 = 13 ± 6 s−1;k 2 = 0.7 ± 0.3 s−1) both remarkably larger than the turnover rate (∼0.02 mol of O2/mol of CcOX × s at [O2] > 250 μm). This finding is diagnostic of a different reactivity of O2 and NO with CcOX. It is indeed difficult to account for this result, assuming that NO, similarly to O2, can react exclusively with R, which combines with very high affinity and second order rate constants with both ligands. If this were the case, the formation of the reduced NO-bound heme a3 would be much slower, being rate-limited by the formation of R, which in turn accounts for the extremely low oxidase activity. Therefore this result implies that NO can react not only with the two-electron reduced heme a3-CuBsite R (19) but also with the single-electron reduced siteE, whose occurrence in this mutant was already documented (11Jünemann S. Meunier B. Gennis R.B. Rich P.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14456-14464Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We do not have a valid explanation for the observed heterogeneity in the reduction of heme a3, but we notice that a similar biphasic behavior was reported also for the beef heart enzyme (7Verkhovsky M.I.

Nature has, indeed, evolved a variety of molecular folds to accommodate nucleotides such as ATP, and biochemists are now in the process of understanding these motifs on a detailed three-dimensional level. To date, the most commonly known and clearly the best-characterized ATP-binding motif is the “P-loop,” which was first observed in the β-subunit of F1-ATPase (1Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4252) Google Scholar, 2Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biol. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar). This particular motif is characterized by a signature sequence Gly-X-X-X-X-Gly-Lys-Thr/Ser. Whereas proteins and enzymes containing this moiety are involved in a variety of biochemical processes, the three-dimensional structures of their respective P-loops are remarkably similar (3Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1590-1602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In all cases, the glycine-rich P-loop links a strand of β-sheet to an α-helix, and it is this connection that provides side chain and backbone atoms for binding both the β- and γ-phosphates of the adenosine nucleotides. Within recent years, another ATP-binding moiety, the so-called ATP-grasp motif, has been subjected to detailed structural/functional analyses (4Murzin A.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 386-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 5Galperin M.Y. Koonin E.V. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2639-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Enzymes harboring this type of ATP-binding motif are found in such metabolic pathways as ribosome biogenesis, glutathione biosynthesis, peptidoglycan biosynthesis, purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis, and fatty acid synthesis, among others. The catalytic mechanisms for all of the enzymes belonging to the ATP-grasp superfamily are believed to proceed through acylphosphate intermediates. From high-resolution x-ray diffraction analyses, it is known that enzymes belonging to the ATP-grasp superfamily adopt similar molecular folds with three major motifs referred to as the A-, B-, and C-domains. The adenosine nucleotide ligands are invariably wedged between the B- and C-domains. PurT-encoded glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase fromEscherichia coli, the focus of this study, belongs to the ATP-grasp superfamily. This dimeric enzyme, referred to hereafter as PurT transformylase, functions in purine synthesis by catalyzing the formylation of glycinamide ribonucleotide or GAR1 as outlined in SchemeFS1. The catalytic mechanism of PurT transformylase is believed to proceed through a formyl phosphate intermediate, in a manner analogous to enzymes employing the more common carboxyphosphate entity (6Marolewski A. Mattia K.M. Warren M.S. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6709-6716Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). From high-resolution x-ray crystallographic investigations, the three-dimensional structure of PurT transformylase in a ternary complex with Mg2+AMPPNP and GAR is now known (7Thoden J.B. Firestine S. Nixon A. Benkovic S.J. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8791-8802Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A ribbon representation of PurT transformylase with these ligands is displayed in Fig.1. As can be seen, the GAR substrate is nestled at the C-terminal end of the five-stranded parallel β-sheet of the A-domain, whereas the AMPPNP moiety sits between the B- and C-domains. A close-up view of the active site region for PurT transformylase is shown in Fig. 2. The amino group of GAR that is formylated during the reaction lies at ∼2.8 Å from the γ-phosphate of AMPPNP. It has been postulated that breakage of the β−γ phosphate bond of ATP during the formation of the formyl phosphate intermediate leads to a shift of the resulting Mg2+-formyl phosphate toward the amine group of GAR. Asp-268 has been postulated to function as a general base to deprotonate the amine group of GAR, which then reacts with the carbonyl group of the acylphosphate intermediate (7Thoden J.B. Firestine S. Nixon A. Benkovic S.J. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8791-8802Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).

The ADP·aluminum fluoride complex is thought to specifically mimic the transition state for ATP hydrolysis (9Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I.

Here we describe and compare the high-resolution x-ray structures of PurT transformylase complexed with Mg2+ATP/GAR, Mg2+ATP, Mg2+AMPPCP, Mg2+ATPγS, or Mg2+ADP to address the subtle changes in protein structure that occur upon adenosine nucleotide analog binding. PurT transformylase was chosen as the subject for this investigation because crystals of the enzyme diffract to at least 1.75 Å resolution and, in one case, to 1.05 Å resolution. The studies presented here demonstrate that the conformations of the polypeptide chain between Lys-155 to Gln-165 and Gln-225 to Tyr-230 in PurT transformylase are dependent upon the identity of the nucleotide analog located within the active site. Because this research represents the first systematic analysis of nucleotide analog binding within the ATP-grasp fold, the concepts gleaned from this study may be directly applicable to other members of the enzyme superfamily. Recombinant PurT transformylase was expressed in an E. coli overproducing strain BL21(DE3), pLysS, carrying the PurT gene on a pET-22b plasmid and purified as described previously (7Thoden J.B. Firestine S. Nixon A. Benkovic S.J. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8791-8802Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Crystals of the Mg2+ATP, Mg2+ATPγS, and Mg2+AMPPCP complexes were grown by macroseeding into batch setups at 4 °C. The protein stock solutions, at 22 mg/ml were adjusted with ATP (or ATPγS or AMPPCP), MgCl2, and NaCl such that the final concentrations were 5, 10, and 250 mm, respectively, and the protein concentrations were 20 mg/ml. For each enzyme:nucleotide complex crystallization trial, the protein solution was mixed 1:1 with precipitant solutions containing 16–24% (w/v) methylether poly(ethylene glycol) 5000, 100 mm MOPS (pH 6.7), and 100 mm MgCl2. The resulting solutions were spun in a microfuge to clarify them, and 25-μl aliquots were placed onto Plexiglas depression trays. A single crystalline seed was introduced into each drop, which was then subsequently sealed with a coverslip to prevent evaporation. Crystals with overall dimensions of 1.0 × 0.6 × 0.5 mm were obtained within 2–3 weeks. The crystals belonged to the space group P21212 with typical unit cell dimensions of a = 62.3 Å,b = 179.5 Å, and c = 75.7 Å and one dimer per asymmetric unit. Each subunit contains 392 amino acid residues. Preparation and crystallization of the protein complex with ADP were similar to those of the ATP analogs. For preparation of the PurT transformylase ternary complex with Mg2+ATP and GAR, crystals were first grown in the presence of Mg2+ATP and subsequently transferred to a solution containing 20% (w/v) methylether poly(ethylene glycol) 5000, 50 mm MgCl2, 350 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm ATP, 100 mm MOPS (pH 6.7), and 1 mm GAR and allowed to soak for ∼12 h. All x-ray data sets were collected on flash-frozen crystals that had been transferred to cryoprotectant solutions containing 2.5 mm ATP (or other relevant nucleotide analogs), 500 mm NaCl, 25% (w/v) methylether poly(ethylene glycol) 5000, 50 mmMgCl2, 100 mm MOPS (pH 6.7), and 15% (v/v) ethylene glycol. With the exception of the enzyme/Mg2+ADP complex, all x-ray data sets were collected with a HiStar (Bruker AXS) area detector system using CuKa radiation generated from a Rigaku RU200 rotating anode generator operated at 50 kV and 90 mA and equipped with Göbel focusing optics. The x-ray data sets were processed with SAINT (Bruker AXS, Inc.) and internally scaled with XSCALIBRE. 2G. Wesenberg and I. Rayment, unpublished results. X-ray data from the crystals of the PurT transformylase·Mg2+ADP complex to 1.05 Å resolution were collected at Argonne Advanced Photon Source, Structural Biology Center line 19-ID. These data were processed with HKL2000 and scaled with SCALEPACK (13Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38570) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab rflns, reflections. The quality of the models, as judged from Table II, is excellent with regard to both conventionalR-factors and overall geometrical constraints. Ramachandran plots for all of the models reveal that ∼95% of the non-glycinyl residues fall well within the allowed regions. In each model, the only significant outlier in the Ramachandran plot is Leu-8. The electron density for this residue is unambiguous. The quality of the electron density for the solvent is especially revealing. Fig.3 shows the observed electron density corresponding to a bound MOPS buffer molecule. This molecule is positioned within the subunit:subunit interface of the physiological dimer. The morpholino ring of the buffer is located in a pocket that includes the side chain of Leu-8, whereas the sulfonic acid moiety forms a hydrogen bond with the peptidic NH group of Ser-56. In all of the structures reported here, the electron density corresponding to Subunit I in the asymmetric unit was somewhat better ordered than that for Subunit II. Hence the following discussions refer only to Subunit I of the dimer. The work described here unequivocally demonstrates that in the ATP-grasp proteins, the conformation of the binding loop, which in this study is referred to as the “T-loop,” is highly dependent upon both the presence or absence of nucleotide and the nature of the moiety occupying the γ-phosphate position. This is in sharp contrast to the P-loop enzymes, in which the conformation of the nucleotide binding motif is essentially insensitive to the presence or absence of ligands. Also, unlike that observed for the P-loop motif, there is not a characteristic signature sequence in the primary structure of the T-loops. In all cases, however, the T-loop begins with either a lysine residue, as in PurT transformylase (7Thoden J.B. Firestine S. Nixon A. Benkovic S.J. Holden H.M.

Superpositions of the T-loops in PurT transformylase, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (19Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), glutathione synthetase (15Hara T. Kato H. Katsube Y. Oda J.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2531-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) are displayed in Fig.4. The T-loops, which connect the second and third β-strands of the B-domains, typically contain either Type I′ or Type III′ turns that participate in hydrogen bonding interactions with the β- and γ-phosphoryl oxygens. As can be seen in the case of the PurT transformylase·Mg2+ADP complex, residues Ser-160 to Gly-162 are disordered but adopt a Type I′ turn (Ser-160 to Lys-163) conformation upon Mg2+ATP binding. The first structure of PurT transformylase to be solved was that of the enzyme complexed with Mg2+AMPPNP and GAR (7Thoden J.B. Firestine S. Nixon A. Benkovic S.J. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8791-8802Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For the sake of subsequent comparisons, a close-up view of the electron density corresponding to the AMPPNP and a portion of the T-loop is shown in Fig. 5 a, whereas a cartoon of the observed hydrogen bonding pattern between the protein and the ligand is given in Fig. 5 b. Note that the electron density for the side chain of Ser-161 is weak, whereas it is clear that the side chain of Ser-160 is oriented toward the nucleotide. Indeed, Oγ of Ser-160 lies within 2.6 Å of the γ-phosphoryl oxygen, which in turn is coordinated to a Mg2+ ion. The side chain nitrogen of Gln-165 is positioned at 3.6 Å from the α,β-bridging oxygen of the AMPPNP ligand. The adenine ring of the nucleotide is anchored to the protein via electrostatic interactions with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Gly-196 and with the peptidic NH group of Val-198, a feature conserved in members of the ATP-grasp superfamily with known three-dimensional structures. In addition to these backbone atoms, Oε1 of Glu-195 also interacts with the adenine ring of the nucleotide. In some cases, such as carbamoyl phosphate synthetase or glutathione synthetase, this glutamate is replaced with an aspartate or glutamine, respectively. Both Lys-155 and Arg-114 provide key electrostatic interactions with the α- and β-phosphoryl oxygens, respectively. The position occupied by Arg-114 in PurT transformylase is typically an arginine or lysine residue in other members of the ATP-grasp superfamily. The two observed Mg2+ ions are octahedrally coordinated and bridged together by the carboxylate side chain of Glu-279, which is strictly conserved among ATP-grasp proteins of known structure. Glu-267 in PurT transformylase serves as a bidentate ligand to one of the Mg2+ ions. In some members of the ATP-grasp superfamily, this residue is replaced with a glutamine (as in carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (19Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar)) or an aspartate (as in glutathione synthetase or D:alanine D:alanine ligase (15Hara T. Kato H. Katsube Y. Oda J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11967-11974Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 16Fan C. Park I.-S. Walsh C.T. Knox J.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2531-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar)). Glu-203 in PurT transformylase hydrogen bonds to both the 2′- and 3′-hydroxyl groups of the nucleotide ribose, which adopts the C3′-endo conformation. This 2′- and 3′-hydroxyl-bridging glutamate is conserved in most of the ATP-grasp family members including carbamoyl phosphate synthetase, where it also functions as a ligand to the bound potassium ion (19Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in glutathione synthetase or biotin carboxylase, this glutamate is replaced with an aspartate or a histidine, respectively (15Hara T. Kato H. Katsube Y. Oda J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11967-11974Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 17Thoden J.B. Blanchard C.Z. Holden H.M. Waldrop G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16183-16190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In PurT transformylase, a water molecule lies within hydrogen bonding distance to the nitrogen bridging the β- and γ-phosphates of the AMPPNP. It is widely accepted that Mg2+AMPPNP serves as an excellent mimic of Mg2+ATP (8Yount R.G. Babcock D. Ballantyne W. Ojala D. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 2484-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Fig.6 a shows the electron density corresponding to the Mg2+ATP and the T-loop in the Mg2+ATP·GAR complex of PurT transformylase. A cartoon of the hydrogen bonding pattern between the protein and Mg2+ATP is given in Fig. 6 b. Although the electron density for Ser-160 is weak, it is clear, by comparing Figs. 5 a and 6 a, that the side chain of Ser-160 has moved out of the binding pocket such that it no longer forms a hydrogen bond with a γ-phosphoryl oxygen of the nucleotide. A second major difference between these two adenosine nucleotide·GAR complexes of PurT transformylase occurs at Gln-165. In the Mg2+ATP·GAR·protein complex, the carboxamide nitrogen of Gln-165 lies at 2.9 Å from the bridging α,β-phosphorus oxygen. This corresponding distance in the Mg2+AMPPNP·GAR·protein complex is 3.6 Å. In addition to the changes in side chain conformations for Ser-160 and Gln-165, the loop delineated by Gln-225 to Tyr-230 also varies depending upon the nature of the nucleotide present in the active site. A distance of 5.5 Å is observed between the α-carbon of Gly-228 and C-5 of the AMPPNP ribose. Upon Mg2+ATP binding, however, the loop closes down such that the observed distance is 4.2 Å. Strikingly, the electron density corresponding to Ser-160 and Ser-161 in the PurT transformylase·Mg2+ATP complex is very well ordered, as seen in Fig. 7 a. In the absence of the GAR substrate, a third magnesium ion is observed in the active site. As indicated in the hydrogen bonding cartoon in Fig. 7 b, this magnesium ion is coordinated by the carboxylate side chain of Asp-286, one of the γ-phosphoryl oxygens of the nucleotide, and four water molecules. Note that in the complexes of PurT transformylase with GAR, the carboxylate side chain of Asp-286 lies within hydrogen bonding distance of the amino group of GAR, and it is this residue that is thought to function as the active site base in the reaction mechanism (7Thoden J.B. Firestine S. Nixon A. Benkovic S.J. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8791-8802Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). As indicated in Fig. 7 b, an ethylene glycol molecule is coordinated to the magnesium ion that bridges the β- and γ-phosphates of the ATP. This position is occupied by a water molecule in all of the other structures presented here. The next structure to be solved in this investigation was that of PurT transformylase complexed with Mg2+AMPPCP. As can be seen from the electron density in Fig.8 a, replacement of the bridging β,γ-oxygen with a methylene group resulted in a disordering of the T-loop. The third magnesium site observed in the PurT transformylase·Mg2+ATP structure is not present. Other than this change, however, the overall hydrogen bonding pattern exhibited between the Mg2+AMPPCP ligand and the protein is similar to that observed for the Mg2+ATP·protein complex. In myosin subfragment-1, as in other P-loop enzymes, the binding of Mg2+ATPγS results in little perturbation of the protein structure (21Gulick A.M. Bauer C.B. Thoden J.B. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11619-11628Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). When complexed with PurT transformylase, however, this sulfur-containing nucleotide analog, like Mg2+AMPPCP, disrupts the conformation of the T-loop, as can be seen in Fig.8 b. Note that the sulfur group of the nucleotide was modeled into the electron density map as indicated in Fig. 8 b in light of the larger lobe of electron density observed in the map at this position and also taking into account the general ligation preference of magnesium ions for oxygen rather than sulfur atoms. The difference in the quality of the electron density for the T-loop with bound Mg2+ATP (Fig. 7 a) versusMg2+ATPγS (Fig. 8 b) strikingly emphasizes that in the ATP-grasp enzymes, the chemical nature of the terminal phosphate is critical for the polypeptide chain conformation, and, at least in the case of PurT transformylase, the Mg2+ATPγS is not an acceptable nucleotide analog. The final structure solved in this study was that of the enzyme complexed with Mg2+ADP. Due to the high quality of the crystals, it was possible to determine the structure of this complex to a nominal resolution of 1.05 Å. Electron density corresponding to the nucleotide diphosphate is shown in Fig.9 a, and a cartoon of the hydrogen bonding pattern between the ligand and the protein is given in Fig. 9 b. In this case, the electron density corresponding to the T-loop is completely disordered. The sole magnesium ion is coordinated by oxygen-containing ligands in a nearly exact octahedral ligation sphere. The ligand:metal:ligand bond angles range from 85.8o to 94.7o, with an average value of 90.0o. Bond distances between the magnesium ion and the α- and β-phosphoryl oxygens are 1.8 Å, whereas the distances between the cation and the two waters are 1.7 Å and 1.9 Å, respectively. In the nucleotide triphosphate·protein complexes, the carboxylate side chain of Glu-267 functions as a bidentate ligand to the magnesium ion, with each of its carboxylate oxygens lying with 2.1 Å of the magnesium ion. Upon Mg2+ADP binding in the active site, however, the side chain of Glu-267 swings away such that only Oε2 of the carboxylate group ligates the cation (1.8 Å), whereas Oε1 is located at 3.2 Å from the magnesium ion. In addition to these changes, in the Mg2+ADP/protein model, Nε2 of Gln-165 no longer participates in hydrogen bonds with the nucleotide. A superposition of the Mg2+ATP and Mg2+ADP complexes of PurT transformylase near the active site region is displayed in Fig. 10. In addition to the ordering of the T-loop upon nucleotide triphosphate binding, the polypeptide chain delineated by Gln-225 to Tyr-230 also adopts a different conformation such that the α-carbon of Gly-228, for example, moves by ∼3.0 Å. It can be speculated that the observed changes in polypeptide chain conformation may be required to facilitate both the binding of Mg2+ATP and the removal of Mg2+ADP after the reaction.Figure 10Differences in the polypeptide chain conformation of PurT transformylase upon Mg2+ATP hydrolysis. Upon Mg2+ATP hydrolysis, the T-loop becomes disordered, and the second loop, delineated by Gln-225 to Tyr-230, moves away from the nucleotide binding pocket.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) One of several key questions remaining with regard to the ATP-grasp enzymes is the chemical nature of the acylphosphate intermediate binding pocket. In the past, x-ray analyses of the binding modes for nucleotide analogs such as ADP/beryllium fluoride and ADP/aluminum fluoride in the P-loop enzymes have effectively addressed important structural questions regarding the catalytic mechanisms of these enzymes. With this in mind, intense efforts were put forth in this study on PurT transformylase to study the binding of ADP/beryllium fluoride and ADP/aluminum fluoride compounds to the enzyme in an effort to address the issue of the acylphosphate binding site. As stated previously, ADP/aluminum fluoride is thought to mimic the transition state of ATP hydrolysis and thus might help to identify the location of the acylphosphate intermediate in PurT transformylase. When the enzyme was crystallized in the presence of 5 mmMg2+ADP/aluminum fluoride, however, only Mg2+ADP was observed in the active site. The same results occurred when the enzyme was crystallized in the presence of Mg2+ADP/beryllium fluoride or Mg2+ADP/vanadate. Interestingly, similar attempts to bind these ATP analogs to carbamoyl phosphate synthetase, another member of the ATP-grasp superfamily, also resulted in only Mg2+ADP being observed in the active site. 3J. B. Thoden, F. M. Raushel, and H. M. Holden, unpublished data. In retrospect, the results with both PurT transformylase and carbamoyl phosphate synthetase are not surprising. As demonstrated here, the T-loop is exquisitely sensitive to the composition of the nucleotide and most likely is disordered in the presence of analogs such as Mg2+ADP/beryllium fluoride. Additional attempts to locate the formyl phosphate binding pocket in PurT transformylase have included crystallization experiments with phosphonoacetic acid or phosphonoformic acid (Scheme FS2) and Mg2+ADP. Again, the resulting electron density maps clearly indicated the presence of only Mg2+ADP and GAR in the active site. Crystallization of PurT transformylase in the presence of ADP and acetyl phosphate (in the presence of either magnesium or manganese) resulted in the appearance of ATP in the active site, whereas crystallization of the protein in the presence of ADPβS and acetyl phosphate resulted in only ADPβS being observed in the active site. One of the more interesting results from these high-resolution x-ray analyses of PurT transformylase is the difference in the side chain conformation of Ser-160 in the presence of Mg2+AMPPNPversus Mg2+ATP, both with bound GAR. In the former case, the side chain of Ser-160 swings in toward the γ-phosphate of the nucleotide and is located within 2.6 Å of a γ-phosphoryl oxygen. In the case of bound Mg2+ATP, however, the side chain of Ser-160 moves out toward the solvent such that Oγ is ∼4.8 Å away from the same γ-phosphoryl oxygen. Given the relative orientation of Ser-160 in relationship to both the Mg2+ATP and the GAR (or Mg2+AMPPNP as indicated in Fig. 2), it might be speculated that it is involved in the positioning of formate. When the proper nucleotide, i.e.Mg2+ATP, is bound in the active site, the side chain of Ser-160 moves toward the solvent to allow formate to enter the binding region. Although there have been no site-directed mutagenesis analyses thus far targeting Ser-160, interestingly, when Gly-162 is changed to an isoleucine, there is a 317-fold reduction ink cat, with a 2-fold increase inK m for ATP and GAR. More importantly, however, the G162I mutant protein exhibited a 180-fold increase inK m for formate, suggesting a direct effect on the formate binding pocket (6Marolewski A. Mattia K.M. Warren M.S. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6709-6716Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, this mutation allowed the detection of formyl phosphate, indicating that in this mutant protein, the formyl phosphate was not held as tightly to the enzyme. Coupled with the x-ray structural data presented here, it seems likely that conformational changes in the T-loops of the ATP-grasp superfamily play critical roles in the formation and trapping of key reactive intermediates. In light of these recent biochemical and x-ray crystallographic studies, site-directed mutagenesis experiments directed at Ser-160 are presently under way. An additional target for study is Asp-286. This residue has been postulated to function as the active site base for the deprotonation of the amine of GAR, which subsequently reacts with the carbonyl group of formyl phosphate. By changing this residue to an asparagine, for example, it may be possible to trap the reaction in the crystalline lattice at the stage of Mg2+ADP, formyl phosphate and GAR. Again, these experiments are presently under way. We thank Dr. Frank M. Raushel for helpful discussions.

We have previously reported that protein hydrolysates (i.e. peptones), which are representative of the protein fraction in the lumen, increased cholecystokinin(CCK) gene transcription in the STC-1 enteroendocrine cell line. In the present work, we examined the intracellular events evoked by peptones to stimulate CCK gene transcription. In STC-1 cells, peptones stimulated cyclic AMP production and protein kinase A (PKA) activity. This was associated with a nuclear translocation of the PKA catalytic subunit and with a PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the CRE-binding protein (CREB) at Ser133. Using transient transfection experiments and reporter luciferase assays, we show that peptone-stimulated transcriptional activity of the CCK gene promoter was significantly decreased when the PKA pathway was inhibited. Furthermore, the intracellular calcium chelator 1,2-bis-(O-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid-tetra(acetoxymethyl)ester completely inhibited peptone-induced stimulation of the CCK gene promoter activity, phosphorylation of CREB, and PKA activity. Peptones increased, in a calcium-dependent manner, the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and the MEK inhibitor PD98059 decreased the peptone-induced stimulation ofCCK gene promoter activity. This stimulation was also reduced by 30% in the presence of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) inhibitor KN-93. Total inhibition was obtained when the PKA, ERK, and CaMK pathways were simultaneously blocked with appropriate inhibitors to these pathways. These results demonstrate the simultaneous involvement of cAMP- and calcium-dependent protein kinases in the stimulation of intestinal CCK gene transcription by protein-derived nutrients.

Intestinal genes, expressed by epithelial cells of which the apical pole is in direct contact with the luminal contents, are potential targets for a nutritional control of transcription. Thus, expression of hormone genes such as those of glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide, proglucagon, andcholecystokinin(CCK)1 has been shown to be up-regulated in the intestine of rodents by glucose, dietary fibers, or protein hydrolysates (1Tseng C.C.

CCK, produced by intestinal endocrine I-cells regulates several key digestive functions such as gallbladder contraction or pancreatic enzyme secretion (4Walsh J.H. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. Raven Press, New York1994: 49-67Google Scholar). Food intake is the most potent stimulant of CCK release and there is a correlation between diet-induced CCK gene expression and peptide secretion in rat (5Liddle R.A. Carter J.D. McDonald A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 2015-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and man (6Bentouimou N. Leray V. Zerbib F. Blottiere H.M. Galmiche J.P. Bruley des Varannes S. Gastroenterol. Clin. Biol. 1995; 19: 659-663PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these studies were based on in vivo dietary manipulations and, for that reason, did not permit identification of the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved. Few data are available on the signaling pathways connecting dietary changes to alterations in gene expression. Most of the current knowledge concerns the effects of fatty acids and glucose in the transcriptional control of genes encoding proteins that play significant roles in lipid and glucose transport or metabolism in hepatocytes, adipocytes, or pancreatic beta cells (7Duplus E. Glorian M. Forest C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30749-30752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 8Vaulont S. Vasseur-Cognet M. Kahn A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31555-31558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The mechanisms involved were elucidated in some cases, and DNA response elements, binding transcription factors, and transduction cascades were identified. For instance, a large part of the transcriptional effects of fatty acid can be assigned to the direct activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (9Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar). Alternatively, protein kinase C (PKC) and calcium are involved in the transcriptional induction of early response genes by palmitate and oleate in pancreatic INS-1 cells (10Roche E. Buteau J. Aniento I. Reig J.A. Soria B. Prentki M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2007-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The transcriptional effect of glucose has been shown to be mediated by an AMP-activated protein kinase pathway to modulate the L-type pyruvate kinase gene (11da Silva Xavier G. Leclerc I. Salt I.P.

A. 2000; 97: 4023-4028Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) or by a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/p38MAPK pathway to stimulate the insulin gene (12Macfarlane W.M. McKinnon C.M.

Much less is known about the effect of protein metabolites, and one of the few detailed studies in this field demonstrated that leucine starvation induced the stimulation of the C/EBP homologous protein promoter activity in cells of different origins. This occurred through an amino acid response element that bound the activating transcription factor 2 (13Bruhat A. Jousse C. Carraro V. Reimold A.M. Ferrara M. Fafournoux P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7192-7204Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We recently observed that protein hydrolysates (i.e.peptones), which have been reported as a representative model of the intestinal luminal dietary protein content (14Cuber J.C. Bernard G. Fushiki T. Bernard C. Yamanishi R. Sugimoto E. Chayvialle J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: G191-G197PubMed Google Scholar), stimulatedCCK gene transcription in the STC-1 enteroendocrine cell line, whereas intact proteins or free amino acids had no effect (15Cordier-Bussat M. Bernard C. Haouche S. Roche C. Abello J. Chayvialle J.A. Cuber J.C. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1137-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The in vitro model allowed us to identify, in theCCK gene promoter, a DNA cis-element that was required for the transcriptional response to protein hydrolysates (16Bernard C. Sutter A. Vinson C. Ratineau C. Chayvialle J. Cordier-Bussat M. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This PepRE sequence binds transcription factors of the CREB family which are phosphorylated after cell treatment with protein hydrolysates. Nevertheless, the intracellular signaling involved was unknown and remained to be elucidated. In the present work, we investigated the transduction mechanisms leading to the peptone-induced increase of CCK gene transcription in the intestinal endocrine STC-1 cells. We demonstrate that the transcriptional effect of protein hydrolysates is mediated by the concomitant participation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) pathways, and that intracellular calcium plays an essential role in this regulation. Forskolin, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), peptones (enzymatic hydrolysate from meat, type I), and the Escort lipofection reagent were purchased from Sigma (Saint Quentin Fallavier, France). The peptide molecular weight distribution of peptones was previously determined and showed a majority (75%) of peptides with molecular size comprised between 120 and 1,200 Da and 5% of peptides with molecular size over 5,000 Da; the rest (20%) were free amino acids (14Cuber J.C.

Cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen (Cergy Pontoise, France). PKA inhibitor H-89 (N-[2-((p-bromocinnamyl)amino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide), BAPTA-AM (1,2-bis-(O-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid-tetra(acetoxymethyl)ester), MAP/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD98059 (2′-amino-3′-methoxyflavone), and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) inhibitor KN-93 (2-[N-(2-hydroxyethyl)]-N-(4-methoxybenzenesulfonyl)]amino-N-(4-chlorocinnamyl)-N-methylbenzylamine)) were from Calbiochem (Meudon, France). The mouse monoclonal anti-human PKAC antibody was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (BD PharMingen, Le Pont de Claix, France). Phosphorylation-specific and phosphorylation state-independent rabbit polyclonal p42/44MAPK (ERK1/2) antibodies were from Cell Signaling (Ozyme, Saint Quentin-en-Yvelines, France). Phosphorylation-specific and phosphorylation state-independent rabbit polyclonal CREB antibodies were from Cell Signaling and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Tebu, Le Perray-en-Yvelines, France), respectively. [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 10 mCi/ml) was from Amersham Biosciences (Les Ulis, France). CCK gene promoter constructs have been previously described (16Bernard C. Sutter A. Vinson C. Ratineau C. Chayvialle J. Cordier-Bussat M. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, aCCK gene promoter fragment containing ∼800 bp of the ratCCK gene 5′-flanking region (position +40 to −765 (17Haun R.S. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15455-15463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) was subcloned into pGL3basic vector (Promega, Charbonnieres, France) upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene. The pGL3b/CCK-765 was deleted in 5′ of the CCK gene promoter fragment to generate pGL3b/CCK −93 and −70 constructs. Six bases of the PepRE site were mutated in pGL3b/CCK −93 to generate the −93M4 construct. The expression plasmid MT-REV(AB), encoding a dominant negative form of the PKA regulatory subunit mutated in the cAMP-binding domains (18Correll L.A. Woodford T.A. Corbin J.D. Mellon P.L. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16672-16678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was a kind gift of Dr. G. S. McKnight (Seattle, WA). STC-1 cells (gift from Dr. A. Leiter, Boston, MA) were derived from an intestinal endocrine tumor developed in a double transgenic mouse expressing the simian virus 40 large T antigen and the polyoma virus small t antigen under the control of the ratinsulin promoter (19Rindi G. Grant S.G. Yiangou Y. Ghatei M.A. Bloom S.R. Bautch V.L. Solcia E. Polak J.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 136: 1349-1363PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mmglutamine and antibiotics (100 IU penicillin/ml and 50 μmstreptomycin) in a humidified CO2:air (5:95%) incubator at 37 °C. Transfection experiments were performed using the Escort lipofection reagent, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 2 days before transfection, STC-1 cells were seeded into 24-well plates at a density of 80,000 cells/well. For each well, 250 ng of CCK reporter plasmid were mixed with 0.5 μl of Escort reagent in 100 μl of serum-free RPMI medium. In all transfection experiments, a plasmid with a renilla reporter gene under the control of a thymidine kinase promoter (pRL-TK, 12.5 ng/well, Promega) was used as an internal control. In co-transfection experiments with MT-REV(AB) plasmid, the empty vector pUC13 (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany) was added to each set of transfections to ensure that each well received the same amount of DNA, and the DNA:Escort ratio was maintained constant (500 ng:1 μl). Cells were incubated with the Escort/plasmid DNA mixture for 6 h at 37 °C, then replaced in fresh complete medium for an additional 24-h period before treatment. RPMI complete medium was then replaced with RPMI without fetal calf serum but containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin in the presence or absence of the tested agents. After a 16-h incubation at 37 °C, cells were harvested in lysis buffer, and luciferase and renilla activities were measured using the Dual Luciferase Reporter assay system (Promega) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Subconfluent (80%) STC-1 cells in 6-well plates were serum-deprived for 24 h, and washed once with serum-free RPMI medium before stimulation with various agents for the indicated times. Cells were lysed in cold solubilization buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mmHepes, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmNa3VO4, 100 mm NaF, 100 IU aprotinin/ml, 20 μm leupeptin, and 0.2 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5. Cell extracts were then clarified (14,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). For nuclear extract preparation, serum-deprived STC-1 cells in 100-mm dishes were incubated at 37 °C with the tested agents for various times. Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated in buffer B (10 mm Hepes, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μm leupeptin, 100 IU aprotinin/ml, pH 7.9) for 15 min on ice before lysis with 0.6% Nonidet P-40. After centrifugation (700 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), supernatants were removed and nuclear proteins were extracted from the pellets by continuous shaking for 30 min in buffer C (20 mm Hepes, 400 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.2 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μm leupeptin, 100 IU aprotinin/ml, pH 7.9). Soluble nuclear extracts were obtained by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). Cellular and nuclear extracts were diluted in 4 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer (62 mmTris-HCl, 8% SDS, 40% glycerol, 20% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.16% bromphenol blue), boiled for 5 min, and resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked using 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, and exposed to antibodies overnight at 4 °C in the same buffer. After incubation with appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, immunoreactivity was detected using the ECL method (Pierce, Rockford, IL). For cAMP production assays, STC-1 cells were grown into 12-well plates, and serum deprived 24 h prior to stimulation. Incubations were performed for 30 min at 37 °C in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm IBMX, 2% bovine serum albumin, and 10 IU aprotinin/ml in the presence or absence of agonists. The reaction was stopped by addition of chilled 1 n perchloric acid. Cyclic AMP cell content was determined using a cAMP radioimmunoassay kit (New England Nuclear, Zaventem, Belgium) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To determine PKA activity, STC-1 cells were seeded into 60-mm dishes, and serum-starved for 24 h before stimulation. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for various times in RPMI medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin with or without agonists in the presence of 0.5 mm IBMX. The reaction was stopped on ice, and cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline before scrapping in 0.2 ml of extraction buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 20 μm leupeptin, 100 IU aprotinin, pH 7.4). After homogenization with a Potter homogenizer, the lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. PKA activity was measured with the SignaTECT cAMP-dependent protein kinase assay system (Promega). Briefly, 5 μl of cell extract were incubated in a total volume of 25 μl containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mm biotinylated kemptide as a specific PKA substrate, 0.1 mm ATP and 20 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP for 5 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 12.5 μl of 7.5 m guanidine hydrochloride, and samples were spotted onto streptavidin-coated membranes. The membranes were washed 4 times in 2 m NaCl, 4 times in 2 m NaCl in 1% H3PO4, and twice in water, and radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. Total PKA activity was determined in the presence of 5 μm cAMP. All results were calculated as the mean ± S.E. Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post-hoc comparison of Fisher or Student'st test as appropriate. Differences between two means with ap value < 0.05 were regarded as significant. The ability of protein hydrolysates to phosphorylate CREB has been recently demonstrated (16Bernard C. Sutter A. Vinson C. Ratineau C. Chayvialle J. Cordier-Bussat M. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Since this transcription factor can be activated by several protein kinases including PKA, we examined whether cell treatment with peptones could directly activate the cAMP/PKA pathway components and whether this pathway was effectively responsible for peptone-induced CREB stimulation. First, we determined the effect of peptones on intracellular cAMP production and PKA enzyme activity. Fig.1 A shows that peptones induced a significant increase of the cAMP concentration in STC-1 cells (2.81 ± 0.29 versus 1.19 ± 0.08 pmol/well,p < 0.05). Similarly, PKA activity (picomole of ATP/min/μg of protein) was significantly increased when cells were incubated with peptones from 5 min (0.395 ± 0.037versus 0.243 ± 0.029, p < 0.05) to 15 min (0.613 ± 0.049 versus 0.273 ± 0.041,p < 0.05) (Fig. 1 B). Stimulation of PKA activity remained sustained at 30 min (0.548 ± 0.107versus 0.229 ± 0.037, p < 0.05). In an inactive state, PKA catalytic subunits (PKAC) are complexed with PKA regulatory subunits (PKAR) to form a holoenzyme found free in the cytosol or associated with subcellular structures through anchoring proteins (20Colledge M. Scott J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 216-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Under stimulation, PKAC dissociate from PKAR and then can translocate to the nucleus, while PKAR remain in the cytoplasm (21Meinkoth J.L., Ji, Y. Taylor S.S. Feramisco J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9595-9599Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed whether peptone treatment was able to induce a nuclear translocation of PKAC in STC-1 cells, by determining the level of PKAC protein in nuclear extracts by Western blotting. A representative result is shown in Fig.1 C. Treatment of cells with 2% peptones for 30 min increased the amount of PKAC in the nuclear fraction, as compared with control conditions. As a positive control, treatment of cells with forskolin/IBMX (10 μm/0.5 mm) induced a comparable increase of PKAC immunoreactivity in the nucleus. Finally, we evaluated the contribution of the peptone-stimulated PKA pathway in CREB activation. For this purpose, STC-1 cells were incubated for 45 min with peptones in the presence or absence of the selective PKA inhibitor H-89 (22Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the phosphorylation level of CREB was measured by Western blotting using an antibody raised against the Ser133-phosphorylated form of CREB. Results shown in Fig. 1 D demonstrated that H-89 treatment (10 μm) led to a significant decrease in peptone-induced phosphorylation of CREB, indicating a role for PKA in mediating the peptone effect on this transcription factor. To directly establish the functional link between the peptone-induced cAMP/PKA signaling pathway activation and the peptone-induced stimulation of CCK gene promoter activity, pharmacological and molecular approaches were both used. On the one hand, STC-1 cells were transiently transfected with the −765 bp CCK gene promoter construct, and treated for 16 h with peptones or forskolin/IBMX in the presence of increasing concentrations of the selective PKA inhibitor H-89 (Fig.2 A). H-89 (1–10 μm) produced a dose-dependent inhibition of the peptone-stimulated CCK gene promoter activity that reached 51.1 ± 2.9% at the highest tested concentration. A similar inhibitory effect of H-89 was registered for the stimulation ofCCK gene promoter activity induced by forskolin/IBMX (Fig.2 A). Furthermore, extended exposure to agents that increase cAMP cell content has been shown to desensitize the cAMP-dependent pathway in cells of different origin, by down-regulating the PKAC (23Hemmings B.A. FEBS Lett. 1986; 196: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 24Garrel G.

In STC-1 cells transfected with the −765-bp CCK gene promoter, pretreatment with 10 μm forskolin for 24 h before a 16-h incubation period in the presence of forskolin/IBMX strongly decreased the stimulation of CCK gene promoter activity (Fig. 2 B), suggesting an effective down-regulation of PKAC in our model. In these conditions, exposure of forskolin-pretreated cells to peptones reduced CCK gene promoter activity to 52.9 ± 7.0% of the maximal stimulation (p < 0.05). In contrast to forskolin-induced desensitization, pretreatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 24 h did not significantly modify CCK gene promoter responsiveness to peptones or forskolin/IBMX. On the other hand, we transiently overexpressed a dominant negative mutant of PKAR (18Correll L.A. Woodford T.A. Corbin J.D. Mellon P.L. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16672-16678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in STC-1 cells, and we evaluated the incidence of this expression on peptone-induced stimulation of −765-bpCCK gene promoter activity (Fig.3 A). Overexpression of the PKAR mutant MT-REV(AB) dose dependently inhibited the peptone-induced stimulation of the CCK gene promoter activity, and 50% inhibition was attained with 500 ng of MT-REV(AB) expression plasmid. No further inhibition was observed at higher plasmid concentrations (not shown). As a simultaneous control, the transcriptional response to forskolin/IBMX was dose dependently abolished with a complete inhibition of stimulation using 500 ng of MT-REV(AB) plasmid. Previous studies have identified a peptone-response element (PepRE) located between −93 and −70 bp upstream the transcription start site of the CCK gene promoter in STC-1 cells (16Bernard C. Sutter A. Vinson C. Ratineau C. Chayvialle J. Cordier-Bussat M. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To determine whether this sequence is directly involved in the PKA-dependent activation of CCK gene promoter by peptones, different CCK gene promoter constructs, containing or lacking the PepRE, were co-transfected in STC-1 cells together with the MT-REV(AB) plasmid, before cell incubation with or without peptones (Fig. 3 B). Overexpression of the dominant-negative PKAR protein significantly reduced the peptone stimulated activity of the −765- and −93-bp CCK gene promoter fragments without altering the basal transcription. By contrast, no effect of the dominant-negative PKAR protein was observed on the residual luciferase activity when CCK gene promoter constructs −93M4 (containing a −75/−82 bp mutated sequence) and −70 were transiently transfected in STC-1 cells. Thus, altogether these data support the functional relevance of PKA in the peptone-induced transcriptional effect, and identify the PepRE sequence as the target of the PKA-dependent component of the peptone response. Intracellular Ca2+ was reported to be involved in the secretory response of STC-1 cells to peptones (26Nemoz-Gaillard E. Bernard C. Abello J. Cordier-Bussat M. Chayvialle J.A. Cuber J.C. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 932-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This observation prompted us to investigate the Ca2+requirement in the peptone-induced stimulation of CCK gene promoter activity. In STC-1 cells transfected with the −765-bp promoter fragment, treatment with the intracellular Ca2+chelator BAPTA-AM (20 μm) for 16 h completely abolished the peptone-induced stimulation of the CCK gene promoter activity (Fig. 4 A). To exclude a toxic effect of BAPTA/AM, we assessed cell viability using the trypan blue exclusion test. No significant difference was observed between treated and untreated cells for the percentage of living cells (81 ± 3 and 85 ± 1% of the total cell number, respectively). We next investigated the implication of intracellular Ca2+in peptone-induced phosphorylation of CREB. Incubation of STC-1 cells with peptones for 45 min in the presence of 20 μmBAPTA/AM completely inhibited the peptone-stimulated phosphorylation of CREB (Fig. 4 B), the quantity of CREB proteins being constant in all conditions. Similarly, PKA activity stimulated by a 15-min peptone treatment was significantly reduced in the presence of BAPTA/AM (Fig. 4 C). BAPTA/AM at the concentration of 50 μm led to an almost complete inhibition in these experimental conditions. Together, these findings demonstrate the requirement of intracellular Ca2+ in peptone-inducedCCK gene transcription, as well as in cellular events leading to CREB activation. Since PKA inhibition resulted in a significant but only partial decrease of the peptone-induced stimulation of CCKgene promoter activity, we searched for other calcium-dependent protein kinases responsible for the remaining peptone stimulation. In PC12 cells, the MAP kinase cascade is known to be induced by a rise of intracellular calcium (27Barsacchi R. Heider H. Girault J. Meldolesi J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and therefore was a candidate to mediate the peptone signal in STC-1 cells. Incubation of cells for increasing periods of time with 2% peptones induced a marked increase of ERK1/2 phosphorylation on Thr202/Tyr204 from 5 to 30 min, as demonstrated by Western blotting (Fig. 5 A). The activation of ERKs progressively decreased at longer times of exposure. ERK1/2 phosphorylation was totally impaired when cells were pretreated with 50 μm BAPTA/AM, indicating the requirement of calcium in the peptone-induced activation of ERKs in STC-1 cells (Fig. 5 A). To determine the relevance of this MAPK pathway in the stimulation of CCK gene promoter activity, the MEK inhibitor PD98059 was used with cells transfected with the −765-bp CCK gene promoter construct. Treatment with 30 μm PD98059 led to a 60% decrease of peptone-induced stimulation of the CCK gene promoter activity (Fig. 5 B). This inhibition was comparable to that obtained with the expression of the dominant-negative mutant of PKA. Simultaneous treatment with PD98059 and transfection with MT-REV(AB) inhibited 80% of the peptone-induced stimulation of promoter activity (Fig. 5 B). Finally, to explain the residual peptone-induced stimulation of CCK gene promoter activity observed after blocking the PKA and ERK pathways, several inhibitors specific for different signaling pathways were tested: p38MAPK(SB203580),"

The crystal structure of human γ-glutamyl hydrolase, determined at 1.6-Å resolution, reveals that the protein is a homodimer. The overall structure of human γ-glutamyl hydrolase contains 11 α-helices and 14 β-strands, with a fold in which a central eight-stranded β-sheet is sandwiched by three and five α-helices on each side. The topology is very similar to that of the class I glutamine amidotransferase domains, with the only major differences consisting of extensions in four loops and at the C terminus. These insertions are important for defining the substrate binding cleft and/or the dimer interface. Two sequence motifs are found in common between human γ-glutamyl hydrolase and the class I glutamine amidotransferase family and include the catalytically essential residues, Cys-110 and His-220. These residues are located in the center of a largel-shaped cleft that is closed at one end and open at the other. Several conserved residues, including Glu-114, His-171, Gln-218, and Lys-223, may be important for substrate binding. Modeling of a methotrexate thioester intermediate, based on the corresponding complex of the glutamate thioester intermediate of Escherichia coli carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase, indicates that the substrate binds in an orientation with the pteroyl group toward the open end of the cleft. γ-Glutamyl hydrolase catalyzes the cleavage of the γ-glutamyl chain of folylpoly-γ-glutamyl substrates and is a central enzyme in folyl and antifolyl poly-γ-glutamate metabolism.

Coward J.K. Blakely R.L. Benkovic S.L. Folates and Pterins. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., NY1984: 135-190Google Scholar). Folate is required as a cofactor by several enzymes in the de novo biosynthesis of DNA precursors and of several amino acids and is essential for normal cell growth and replication. Antifolates such as methotrexate (MTX) have been the traditional treatment for many cancers over almost four decades (2Chabner B.A. Allegra C.J. Curt G.A. Clendeninn N.J. Baram J. Koizumi S. Drake J.C. Jolivet J. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 907-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). When folates or antifolates are transported into the cell, they are converted to folylpoly-γ-glutamates or antifolylpoly-γ-glutamates through the sequential addition of glutamates by folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) (EC 6.3.2.17). These poly-γ-glutamates are retained intracellularly and are generally better substrates or inhibitors than the corresponding monoglutamates for most of the folate-dependent enzymes (3Galivan J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1980; 17: 105-110PubMed Google Scholar, 4Schirch V. Strong W.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 269: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 5Rhee M.S. Lindau-Shepard B. Chave K.J. Galivan J. Ryan T.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 1040-1046PubMed Google Scholar). GH catalyzes the removal of the γ-linked polyglutamate chain, converting its substrates to folyl- or antifolyl-mono-γ-glutamates, which are less well retained, and thus resulting in a reduction in the overall effectiveness of folates and antifolates. The roles of FPGS and GH activities in the regulation of the extent of polyglutamylation of folates or antifolate drugs are well demonstrated. Increased GH activity (6Rhee M.S. Wang Y. Nair M.G.

The balance between the intracellular activities of FPGS and GH is therefore important not only in the maintenance and in the metabolism of folic acid but also in the antitumor efficacy of antifolate drugs.The crystal structure of FPGS has been determined, and the molecular mechanism of folate and antifolate glutamylation has been characterized in detail (13Sun X.

This implies that PKC-dependent association with the Golgi complex is a prerequisite for PI-TPβ to express its effect on sphingomyelin metabolism. phosphatidylinositol transfer protein wild-type PI-TP phosphatidylinositol phosphatidylcholine inositol sphingomyelin protein kinase C phosphatidic acid phosphatidylserine trinitrophenyl phosphatidylethanolamine goat anti-rabbit peroxidase bacterial sphingomyelinase phosphate-buffered saline 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid phospholipase A2 pyrene guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone Eukaryotic phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins (PI-TPs)1 belong to a family of highly conserved proteins that are able to transfer phospholipids between membranes or from membrane to enzyme (1Wirtz K.W.A.

Similar to PI-TPα, PI-TPβ is able to transfer PI and PC but is also able to transfer sphingomyelin (SM) (8de Vries K.J. Heinrichs A.A. Cunningham E. Brunink F. Westerman J. Somerharju P.J. Cockcroft S. Wirtz K.W.A. Snoek G.T. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). PI-TPβ is mainly associated with the Golgi apparatus (7de Vries K.J. Westerman J.

The primary sequences of PI-TPα and PI-TPβ are very similar, with an identity of 77% and a similarity of 94% (9Tanaka S. Hosaka K. J. Biochem.

In a cell-free system containing trans-Golgi membranes, both PI-TPα and PI-TPβ stimulated the formation of constitutive secretory vesicles and immature granules (10Ohashi M. de Vries K.J. Frank R.

In permeabilized, cytosol-depleted HL60 cells, both isoforms restored GTPγS-stimulated protein secretion and phospholipase C-mediated inositol lipid signaling (11Fensome A. Cunningham E. Prosser S.

In these assays, PI-TPα and PI-TPβ were found to function equally well despite their different biochemical properties and cellular localizations. On the other hand, NIH3T3 cells with increased expression of either PI-TPα or PI-TPβ demonstrated remarkable differences in lipid metabolic pathways. Cells overexpressing PI-TPα (SPIα cells) showed an enhanced PLA2-mediated PI degradation resulting in increased levels of lyso-PI, glycerophosphoinositol, Ins(1)P, and Ins(2)P (13Snoek G.T. Berrie C.P. Geijtenbeek T.B.H. van der Helm H.A. Cadee J.A. Iurisci C. Corda D. Wirtz K.W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35393-35399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This was not observed in cells overexpressing PI-TPβ (SPIβ cells). However, in SPIβ cells (but not in SPIα cells) it was shown that under conditions in which plasma membrane SM was hydrolyzed to ceramide by exogenous sphingomyelinase, PI-TPβ was involved in maintaining the steady-state levels of SM (14van Tiel C.M. Luberto C. Snoek G.T. Hannun Y.A. Wirtz K.W.A. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It was recently postulated that PI-TPβ plays a key role in SM metabolism, making it a potential regulator of pathways for diacylglycerol production and consumption in the mammalian trans-Golgi network (15Bankaitis V.A. Science. 2002; 295: 290-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Disruption of the PI-TPβ gene in mice leads to early failure in embryonic development (16Alb J.G. Phillips S.E. Rostand K.

Cell. 2002; 13: 739-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).In search of mechanisms by which PI-TP activity is regulated, PI-TPα was shown to be phosphorylated by protein kinase C in vitroas well as in vivo (17Snoek G.T. Westerman J. Wouters F.S. Wirtz K.W.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 18van Tiel C.M. Westerman J. Paasman M. Wirtz K.W.A. Snoek G.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21532-21538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). PI-TPα was exclusively phosphorylated on Ser166, with the PC-carrying form of PI-TPα more readily phosphorylated than the PI-carrying form (18van Tiel C.M. Westerman J. Paasman M. Wirtz K.W.A. Snoek G.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21532-21538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in NIH3T3 cells, PI-TPα was translocated from the cytosol to the Golgi membranes upon phosphorylation after stimulation with phorbol ester. This relocalization of PI-TPα coincided with an increased level of intracellular lyso-PI, indicating the activation of a PI-specific PLA2 (17Snoek G.T. Westerman J. Wouters F.S. Wirtz K.W.A. Biochem.

Chem. 2000; 275: 21532-21538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, a model was proposed for the regulation of PI-TPα by PKC-dependent phosphorylation. In contrast to PI-TPα, PI-TPβ purified from bovine or rat brain could not be phosphorylated despite the fact that it contains the same serine residue (Ser165) and an additional putative PKC phosphorylation site (Ser262) not present in PI-TPα (8de Vries K.J. Heinrichs A.A. Cunningham E. Brunink F. Westerman J. Somerharju P.J. Cockcroft S. Wirtz K.W.A. Snoek G.T. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 17Snoek G.T.

Wirtz K.W.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1213: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).In this study, we report that murine PI-TPβ can be phosphorylated by PKC in vitro as well as in situ. The major site of phosphorylation was Ser262, whereas Ser165was a minor site. By site-directed mutagenesis we have shown that Ser165 is essential for the lipid transfer activity of the protein, whereas phosphorylation of Ser262 is required for the association of PI-TPβ with the Golgi membranes. This latter residue is also essential for the ability of PI-TPβ to maintain steady-state levels of SM in the plasma membrane.DISCUSSIONIn this study we have shown that PI-TPβ is a substrate for PKC. By mutation analysis we could establish that Ser262 was the main phosphorylation site. However, Ser165, which is analogous to Ser166 in PI-TPα, was also phosphorylated although to a very limited extent. In a previous study we had shown that the PKC-dependent phosphorylation of PI-TPα was restricted to Ser166 (18van Tiel C.M. Westerman J. Paasman M. Wirtz K.W.A. Snoek G.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21532-21538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The PI-TPα isoform, which is highly homologous to PI-TPβ (similarity of 94%), lacks Ser262 (9Tanaka S. Hosaka K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 981-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Assuming that phosphorylation of the PI-TP isoforms is important for the regulation of their function, we were interested to establish the role of Ser262 in the function of PI-TPβ.The peptide maps of wtPI-TPβ and PI-TPβ(S165A) show three major spots, which are absent from the map of PI-TPβ(S262A) (Fig. 3). This indicates that these three spots represent peptides containing phosphorylated Ser262. The formation of these peptides is probably due to the presence of multiple tryptic cleavage sites in the amino acid sequence of the peptide Met-Arg-Lys-Lys-Gly-Ser262-Val-Arg. Partial digestion would yield the peptides Lys-Lys-Gly-Ser-Val-Arg, Lys-Gly-Ser-Val-Arg, and Gly-Ser-Val-Arg. According to the method described in Ref. 22Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar, we could assign Lys-Lys-Gly-Ser-Val-Arg to spot 1, Lys-Gly-Ser-Val-Arg to spot 2, and Gly-Ser-Val-Arg to spot 3. The tryptic map of PI-TPβ(S262A) showed one spot representing a peptide containing phosphorylated Ser165. This spot was barely visible in the peptide map of wtPI-TPβ, indicating that phosphorylation was almost exclusively restricted to Ser262.Replacement of Ser165 with Ala yielded PI-TPβ(S165A) and the double mutated PI-TPβ(S165A/S262A), both of which in vitro completely lacked PI, PC, and SM transfer activity. On the other hand, PI-TPβ(S262A) was fully active. Mutation of the corresponding serine (Ser166) in PI-TPα also yielded an inactive protein (18van Tiel C.M. Westerman J. Paasman M. Wirtz K.W.A. Snoek G.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21532-21538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). From the three-dimensional structure it can be inferred that Ser166 is exposed at the surface as part of the regulatory loop of PI-TPα (26Yoder M.D., T.L.M. Tremblay J.M. Oliver R.L. Yarbrough L.R. Helmkamp Jr G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9246-9252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Hence it is possible that the loss of transfer activity is due to the inability of PI-TPα(S166A) to properly interact with the membrane interface. However, at this stage we cannot exclude the possibility that replacement of Ser166 with Ala affects the proper folding of the protein during synthesis in E. coli. The same explanations may hold for the lack of transfer activity observed in PI-TPβ(S165A) and PI-TPβ(S165A/S262A). After PKC-dependent phosphorylation, the phospholipid transfer activity of PI-TPβ was unchanged, indicating that phosphorylation of Ser262 had no effect (Fig. 4).The lysates from SPIβ cells contained two forms of PI-TPβ that could be separated by isoelectric focusing. From densitometric analysis it was estimated that 85% of the PI-TPβ collected at pH 6.2 and 15% at pH 6.5. Treatment of the cells with the PKC inhibitor GF 109203X shifted PI-TPβ to pH 6.5, strongly suggesting that the spot at pH 6.2 represented the phosphorylated form of PI-TPβ. Because the lysate from the SPIβ(S262A) cells contained predominantly PI-TPβ at pH 6.5, we conclude that in situ PI-TPβ is constitutively phosphorylated at Ser262. Given that GF 109203X inhibits conventional and novel type PKCs (27Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L.

Grunicke H.H. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), we do not know which PKC isoform is involved in the phosphorylation of PI-TPβ. Because it is unlikely that PKC is constitutively active in these cells, it appears that phosphorylated PI-TPβ in association with the Golgi is a poor substrate for protein phosphatase. In a previous study PI-TPβ isolated from bovine brain could not be phosphorylated by PKC (8de Vries K.J. Heinrichs A.A. Cunningham E. Brunink F. Westerman J. Somerharju P.J. Cockcroft S. Wirtz K.W.A. Snoek G.T. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Because bovine brain protein is 99% identical to murine PI-TPβ, we consider it likely that in this case also PI-TPβ is mainly present in its phosphorylated form.It has previously been reported that in Swiss mouse 3T3 fibroblasts, PI-TPβ was predominantly associated with the Golgi (8de Vries K.J. Heinrichs A.A. Cunningham E. Brunink F. Westerman J. Somerharju P.J. Cockcroft S. Wirtz K.W.A. Snoek G.T. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In the present study we have confirmed that PI-TPβ was associated with the Golgi complex in the SPIβ cells (Fig. 6, panel A). By incubating SPIβ cells with GF 109203X, a relocation of PI-TPβ from the Golgi to the cytoplasm was observed (panel B). A similar distribution throughout the cytoplasm was observed for PI-TPβ(S262A) expressed in NIH3T3 cells (panel C). These observations indicate that Ser262 has to be phosphorylated for PI-TPβ to be associated with the Golgi system. It is to be noted that the phosphorylation site Ser262 is only present in PI-TPβ, whereas the phosphorylation site Ser165/166 is conserved in all PI-TPs identified so far, with the exception of PI-TP fromCaenorhabditis elegans (26Yoder M.D., T.L.M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 9246-9252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).In contrast to wtPI-TPβ, PI-TPβ(S262A) that is overexpressed in mouse fibroblasts is not able to stimulate the resynthesis of SM after the breakdown of this lipid by sphingomyelinase. Because the mutant protein expresses full lipid transfer activity in vitro, we infer that the association of PI-TPβ with the Golgi is a prerequisite for PI-TPβ to stimulate rapid SM replenishment. SM and cholesterol regulation in the Golgi has also been linked to the Golgi localization and phosphorylation of the oxysterol-binding protein (29Ridgway N.D. Lagace T.A. Cook H.W. Byers D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31621-31628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Similar to its yeast analog Sec14p, PI-TPβ may play a role in the budding of SM-containing vesicles from the Golgi (10Ohashi M. de Vries K.J. Frank R. Snoek G.T. Bankaitis V. Wirtz K.W.A.

Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1271-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). It has been well established that the intracellular transport of SM is linked to the assembly and dynamics of lipid rafts (31Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5091) Google Scholar). We are currently investigating whether PI-TPβ is involved in this process. Eukaryotic phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins (PI-TPs)1 belong to a family of highly conserved proteins that are able to transfer phospholipids between membranes or from membrane to enzyme (1Wirtz K.W.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In mammalian tissues at least two isoforms, PI-TPα and PI-TPβ, are found.

Assuming that phosphorylation of the PI-TP isoforms is important for the regulation of their function, we were interested to establish the role of Ser262 in the function of PI-TPβ.The peptide maps of wtPI-TPβ and PI-TPβ(S165A) show three major spots, which are absent from the map of PI-TPβ(S262A) (Fig. 3). This indicates that these three spots represent peptides containing phosphorylated Ser262. The formation of these peptides is probably due to the presence of multiple tryptic cleavage sites in the amino acid sequence of the peptide Met-Arg-Lys-Lys-Gly-Ser262-Val-Arg. Partial digestion would yield the peptides Lys-Lys-Gly-Ser-Val-Arg, Lys-Gly-Ser-Val-Arg, and Gly-Ser-Val-Arg. According to the method described in Ref. 22Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar, we could assign Lys-Lys-Gly-Ser-Val-Arg to spot 1, Lys-Gly-Ser-Val-Arg to spot 2, and Gly-Ser-Val-Arg to spot 3. The tryptic map of PI-TPβ(S262A) showed one spot representing a peptide containing phosphorylated Ser165. This spot was barely visible in the peptide map of wtPI-TPβ, indicating that phosphorylation was almost exclusively restricted to Ser262.Replacement of Ser165 with Ala yielded PI-TPβ(S165A) and the double mutated PI-TPβ(S165A/S262A), both of which in vitro completely lacked PI, PC, and SM transfer activity. On the other hand, PI-TPβ(S262A) was fully active. Mutation of the corresponding serine (Ser166) in PI-TPα also yielded an inactive protein (18van Tiel C.M. Westerman J. Paasman M. Wirtz K.W.A. Snoek G.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21532-21538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). From the three-dimensional structure it can be inferred that Ser166 is exposed at the surface as part of the regulatory loop of PI-TPα (26Yoder M.D., T.L.M. Tremblay J.M. Oliver R.L. Yarbrough L.R. Helmkamp Jr G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9246-9252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Hence it is possible that the loss of transfer activity is due to the inability of PI-TPα(S166A) to properly interact with the membrane interface. However, at this stage we cannot exclude the possibility that replacement of Ser166 with Ala affects the proper folding of the protein during synthesis in E. coli. The same explanations may hold for the lack of transfer activity observed in PI-TPβ(S165A) and PI-TPβ(S165A/S262A). After PKC-dependent phosphorylation, the phospholipid transfer activity of PI-TPβ was unchanged, indicating that phosphorylation of Ser262 had no effect (Fig. 4).The lysates from SPIβ cells contained two forms of PI-TPβ that could be separated by isoelectric focusing. From densitometric analysis it was estimated that 85% of the PI-TPβ collected at pH 6.2 and 15% at pH 6.5. Treatment of the cells with the PKC inhibitor GF 109203X shifted PI-TPβ to pH 6.5, strongly suggesting that the spot at pH 6.2 represented the phosphorylated form of PI-TPβ. Because the lysate from the SPIβ(S262A) cells contained predominantly PI-TPβ at pH 6.5, we conclude that in situ PI-TPβ is constitutively phosphorylated at Ser262. Given that GF 109203X inhibits conventional and novel type PKCs (27Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L.

Because it is unlikely that PKC is constitutively active in these cells, it appears that phosphorylated PI-TPβ in association with the Golgi is a poor substrate for protein phosphatase. In a previous study PI-TPβ isolated from bovine brain could not be phosphorylated by PKC (8de Vries K.J. Heinrichs A.A. Cunningham E. Brunink F. Westerman J. Somerharju P.J. Cockcroft S. Wirtz K.W.A. Snoek G.T. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Because bovine brain protein is 99% identical to murine PI-TPβ, we consider it likely that in this case also PI-TPβ is mainly present in its phosphorylated form.It has previously been reported that in Swiss mouse 3T3 fibroblasts, PI-TPβ was predominantly associated with the Golgi (8de Vries K.J. Heinrichs A.A. Cunningham E. Brunink F. Westerman J. Somerharju P.J. Cockcroft S. Wirtz K.W.A. Snoek G.T. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In the present study we have confirmed that PI-TPβ was associated with the Golgi complex in the SPIβ cells (Fig. 6, panel A). By incubating SPIβ cells with GF 109203X, a relocation of PI-TPβ from the Golgi to the cytoplasm was observed (panel B). A similar distribution throughout the cytoplasm was observed for PI-TPβ(S262A) expressed in NIH3T3 cells (panel C). These observations indicate that Ser262 has to be phosphorylated for PI-TPβ to be associated with the Golgi system. It is to be noted that the phosphorylation site Ser262 is only present in PI-TPβ, whereas the phosphorylation site Ser165/166 is conserved in all PI-TPs identified so far, with the exception of PI-TP fromCaenorhabditis elegans (26Yoder M.D., T.L.M.

Because the mutant protein expresses full lipid transfer activity in vitro, we infer that the association of PI-TPβ with the Golgi is a prerequisite for PI-TPβ to stimulate rapid SM replenishment. SM and cholesterol regulation in the Golgi has also been linked to the Golgi localization and phosphorylation of the oxysterol-binding protein (29Ridgway N.D. Lagace T.A. Cook H.W. Byers D.M. J.

In this study we have shown that PI-TPβ is a substrate for PKC. By mutation analysis we could establish that Ser262 was the main phosphorylation site. However, Ser165, which is analogous to Ser166 in PI-TPα, was also phosphorylated although to a very limited extent. In a previous study we had shown that the PKC-dependent phosphorylation of PI-TPα was restricted to Ser166 (18van Tiel C.M. Westerman J. Paasman M. Wirtz K.W.A. Snoek G.T. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1488878727,"One of the most fascinating aspects of virology is that distantly related viruses often use common strategies and host cell machinery to replicate themselves. Evidence has been accumulating that a diverse group of enveloped viruses use small regions of the cellular plasma membrane known as lipid “rafts” both to assemble new virus particles and to enter susceptible host cells. In a recent issue of the Journal of Experimental Medicine, Bavari et al.

This is a particular concern with many membrane-associated proteins where the sites of action and consequences are compartmentalized. To address this problem, we have sought to develop the means of detecting activity/activation of membrane-associated proteins in a spatially resolved manner. The enzyme phospholipase D (PLD)1 has a well described catalytic activity and has been assigned numerous cellular functions (2Liscovitch M. Czarny M. Fiucci G. Tang X. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 401-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 3Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The various isoforms have been described in a number of disparate membranous cellular locations (2Liscovitch M. Czarny M. Fiucci G. Tang X. Biochem.

Although these distributions reflect the steady state situation, the predicted involvement of PLD in membrane traffic demands that the critical issue of function relates to where PLD becomes activated. This typifies the compartmentation problem and serves here as the model for developing the means to resolve it. PLD catalyzes the hydrolysis of the principal membrane lipid phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) to phosphatidic acid (PtdOH) and choline. In mammalian cells, two PLD genes have been cloned, which in human cells consist of PLD1, with four possible splice variants (4Hammond S.M. Jenco J.M. Nakashima S. Cadwallader K., Gu, Q. Cook S.

Such activity changes have been readily characterized as PLDs exhibit the unique ability to transphosphatidylate primary alcohols producing phosphatidylalcohol (2Liscovitch M. Czarny M. Fiucci G. Tang X. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 401-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar).

Western blots using anti-PRK1/PKN (Transduction Labs) and Rab5B (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were carried out as above except that incubation with the primary antibody (1/1000) was carried out at room temperature for 1 h. For detection of antigen by chemiluminescence, membranes were washed (1× PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 5 min; 1× PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.5m NaCl, 5 min; 1× PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 5 min), and an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody (AmershamBiosciences) second layer was employed for 1 h before visualization with ECL (Amersham Biosciences). For labeling cells, liposomes containing 20 μm PtdCho (dipalmitoyl, Sigma) and 20 μmfluorescent phospholipid, labeled on the acyl chain (BODIPY 530/550 C5 HPtdCho or 530/550 C12 human phosphatidylethanolamine (HPtdEtn), Molecular Probes), were prepared on resuspension in PBS by probe sonication (MSE Microsonicator) for 3 × 10-s cycles at 20 watts.

Lifetime, <τ>, is presented as the average phase shift and relative modulation depth ((τm + τp)/2), and the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiency is defined by EFF = 1 − τda/<τd>, where τda is the lifetime map of the donor in the presence of the acceptor, and <τd> is the average lifetime of the donor in the absence of the acceptor (26Gadella T.W.J.

For each experiment, the average GFP lifetime without acceptor (<τd>) was calculated from eight cells, and the average GFP lifetime with acceptor (<τda>) was deduced from six cells. Each experiment was repeated three times. The GFP lifetime measurements from vesicles were calculated from four different experiments. The cumulative lifetimes of GFP-PLD1 alone and that measured with acceptor fluorophore are plotted on two-dimensional histograms. The population variation, a concomitant decrease in τp and τm, indicates a reduction in GFP lifetime due to FRET. All images were taken using a Zeiss Plan-APOCHROMAT ×100/1.4NA phase 3 oil objective with images recorded at a modulation frequency of 80.218 MHz. The donor (GFP-PLD1) was excited using the 488-nm line of an argon/krypton laser, and the resultant fluorescence was separated using a combination of dichroic beam splitter (Q 505 LP; Chroma Technology Corp.) and narrow band emitter filter (BP514/10; Lys and Optik). Acceptor images (BODIPY-PtdCho and BODIPY-PtdEtn) were taken using a 100-watt Mercury arc lamp (Zeiss Attoarc 2) as a source of sample illumination combined with a high Q Cy3 filter set (exciter, HQ 535/50; dichroic, Q 565 LP; emitter, HQ 610/75 LP; Chroma Technology Corp.). Phospholipase D activity was assessed by prelabeling cells with 2 μCi/ml myristic acid ([9,10-3H(N)], PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 7 h and then adding ethanol to a final concentration of 2% with or without EGF (100 ng/ml) for 30 min. Cells were fractionated (see above), and lipids extracted as below for phospholipid analysis.

This was added to cell fractions in 2% (final) ethanol with or without 100 μmGTPγS or myristoylated human ARF1 (produced from bacteria containing human ARF1 and N-myristoyltransferase using a method based on that previously described (32Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1337-1341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar)). Assays were terminated by phospholipid extraction using chloroform:methanol:aqueous (8:4:3) before separation by thin layer chromatography and quantitation as described (5Hughes W.E. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 727-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that EGF could activate endosomal PLD1, we sought to detect PLD-substrate interactions in vivo and whether this changed on EGF treatment (i.e. activating conditions). Recently, we have successfully detected specific interactions between proteins in vivo by using FLIM (1Ng T. Squire A. Hansra G. Bornancin F. Prevostel C. Hanby A. Harris W. Barnes D. Schmidt S.

This technique allows the detection of FRET, which is a photophysical phenomenon whereby under the appropriate conditions, energy is transferred non-radiatively between fluorophores and typically occurs only at distances of between 1 and 10 nm (1Ng T. Squire A. Hansra G. Bornancin F. Prevostel C. Hanby A. Harris W. Barnes D. Schmidt S. Mellor H. Bastiaens P.I. Parker P.J.

Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 203-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Although we had used FLIM to detect interactions between proteins in vivo by using GFP fusion proteins and fluorophore-labeled antibodies, we postulated that it may be possible to detect FRET between PLD and its lipid substrate using GFP-PLD1b (where the GFP acts as the donor) and PtdCho substrate, labeled with a fluorescent BODIPY moiety on an acyl chain (acting as the acceptor). We therefore separated and purified PLD1-containing vesicular fractions from untreated and EGF-treated HeLa cells and determined that endogenous PLD1 co-fractionated with the endosomal markers, Rab5B, Rab7, PRK1/PKN, and only after EGF treatment, EGF-R (Fig. 1). These data confirm our microscopic identification of PLD1 in endosomal vesicles (and are consistent with our observations that PLD isoforms do not change localization upon EGF stimulation) but also indicated that it should be possible to isolate GFP-PLD1-containing endosomal vesicles to use in FLIM analysis. Indeed, similarly characterized endosomal fractions from transfected HEK-293 cells (which readily express GFP-PLD1b) were pooled and demonstrated, by Western blot, to contain full-length GFP-PLD1b and endosomal markers. Additionally, these fractions exhibited considerably higher levels of PLD activity relative to fractions from untransfected cells when assayed in the presence of GTPγS and exogenously added ARF1 (data not shown; see below). PtdCho, the substrate for PLD, or a fluorescently labeled PtdCho, BODIPY-PtdCho, was introduced into samples of the GFP-PLD1b-containing endosomal fractions by incubation with liposomes. After examination by confocal microscopy, it was clear that incubation with the BODIPY-PtdCho liposomes labeled the vesicles in the preparation, as significant overlap between GFP-PLD1b and BODIPY-PtdCho could be seen on vesicular structures (data not shown). This provided the context in which to assess interactions between GFP-PLD1b and its fluorescently labeled substrate. By fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), the lifetime measured for GFP from GFP-PLD1b in untreated endosomal vesicles or those treated with unlabeled PtdCho liposomes was unchanged (Fig.2 A). However, in endosomal vesicles that had incorporated BODIPY-PtdCho, the measured lifetime of GFP decreased, as indicated by an increase in red, shorter lifetime, pixels (Fig. 2 A). This suggests that the GFP and BODIPY fluorophores are closely interacting to allow energy transfer (FRET) and reduction in measured lifetime. This is confirmed as the images showing pseudocolor scales for FRET efficiency (a relationship between the average donor lifetime in the absence of acceptor and the donor in the presence of the acceptor) also demonstrate that FRET efficiency is higher in the presence of the labeled phospholipid. To confirm that the FRET observed could only be detected when labeled substrate for PLD was added to cells, we assessed GFP-PLD1b lifetime in experiments using BODIPY-PtdEtn, representing a phospholipid for which PLD1 has no catalytic activity (4Hammond S.M. Jenco J.M. Nakashima S. Cadwallader K., Gu, Q. Cook S. Nozawa Y. Prestwich G.D. Frohman A.M. Morris A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3860-3868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). This was also introduced into purified vesicles, and as shown in Fig. 2 A, the lifetime of GFP-PLD remains unchanged in the presence of BODIPY-PtdEtn, indicating that the two fluorophores are not in close proximity despite colocalization in the vesicular membrane. The data collected from four independent experiments with PtdCho, labeled PtdCho, or labeled PtdEtn are shown in the two-dimensional histograms in Fig. 2 B. These represent the cumulative lifetimes of all pixels recorded for GFP-PLD1b alone and in the presence of BODIPY-PtdCho or BODIPY-PtdEtn. The figure shows the lifetimes measured by both parameters assessed using the FLIM apparatus, phase and modulation, and a concomitant decrease in both indicates a reduction in GFP lifetime due to FRET; this is only observed with BODIPY-PtdCho. The variation in the lifetime populations shown is representative of that seen in the images of Fig.2 A and is indicative of a reduction of average GFP-PLD1b lifetime from 2.1 to 1.85 ns due to FRET with BODIPY-PtdCho. The cumulative FRET efficiencies at each pixel, measured in all experiments, is shown in Fig. 2 C, indicating the number of pixel counts versus FRET efficiency and these results again demonstrate that efficient FRET is only seen between GFP-PLD1b and BODIPY-PtdCho. Having characterized this technique in vitro using isolated endosomal GFP-PLD1b-containing vesicles, we examined whether we could detect these specific interactions in vivo using HeLa cells transfected with GFP-PLD1b. Examination by confocal microscopy indicated that BODIPY-phospholipid-containing liposomes could be used to label whole cells and that colocalization between BODIPY-PtdCho and GFP-PLD1b on endosomal vesicles could be detected (see below). Similar lipid loading approaches have been used recently to label cellular phospholipids and study the transport of PtdCho itself in HepG2 cells (33Wustner D. Mukherjee S. Maxfield F.R. Muller P. Herrmann A. Traffic. 2001; 2: 277-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In transfected cells, GFP-PLD1b is seen on vesicular structures, and the lifetime of GFP is unchanged in untreated cells (data not shown) and in cells incubated with unlabeled PtdCho (Fig.3 A). However, in cells incubated with BODIPY-PtdCho, the lifetime of GFP decreases apparently on vesicular structures within the cell, coincident with the detected GFP-PLD1b. We also measured the average lifetime of GFP within defined regions of the cell. Regions representative of GFP-PLD1 vesicles showed an average lifetime of 1.98 ± 0.13 ns; however, in the presence of BODIPY-PtdCho, similar vesicular regions show a reduction in average lifetime to 1.71 ± 0.08 ns. These data confirm that a reduction of GFP lifetime occurs in the presence of the BODIPY-PtdCho on vesicular structures and that FRET is occurring between the fluorophores. In parallel experiments, the lifetime measure for GFP-PLD1b in the presence of BODIPY-PtdEtn remains unchanged, confirming the specificity of the FRET detected between GFP-PLD1b and BODIPY-PtdCho (Fig. 3). The cumulative data for all experiments for variation in the lifetime populations (Fig. 3 B, indicative of a reduction of average GFP-PLD1b lifetime from 2.1 to 1.85 ns) and the cumulative FRET efficiencies (Fig. 3 C) confirm that efficient FRET is only seen between GFP-PLD1b and BODIPY-PtdCho. These data indicate that using FLIM, it is possible to detect, in vivo, specific interactions between vesicular PLD1b and PtdCho. It is likely that in these experiments, the FRET detected between the GFP and BODIPY moieties may be representative of either substrate, BODIPY-PtdCho, or product, BODIPY-PtdOH, interacting with the catalytic site of GFP-PLD1b. Therefore we speculated that catalytically inactive point mutants of GFP-PLD1b used in similar experiments would result in the loss of detected FRET (or at least reduced FRET). To test this hypothesis, we transfected HeLa cells with catalytically inactive PLD mutants GFP-PLD1b-K466E and GFP-PLD1b-K860E, which, while exhibiting no catalytic activity, continue to localize to endosomal vesicles (5Hughes W.E. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 727-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cells were analyzed for FRET between the mutants and BODIPY-PtdCho. The lifetime of catalytically inactive mutants GFP-PLD1b-K466E or GFP-PLD1b-K860E is unchanged in the presence of BODIPY-PtdCho, indicating that the two fluorophores are not interacting; in control experiments, GFP-PLD1b showed lifetime decreases, and an increase in FRET efficiency is observed (Fig.4 A). The cumulative data for all experiments for variation in the lifetime populations (Fig.4 B) and the cumulative FRET efficiencies (Fig.4 C) confirm that no FRET is seen with the two catalytically inactive PLD mutants. Similar results were obtained for isolated endosomal fractions containing catalytically inactive PLD1 isoforms (data not shown). Thus, the FRET detected for GFP-PLD1b is not only specific for PtdCho but is also specific for active PLD1. Whether this distinction reflects the loss of interaction between the inactive point mutants and BODIPY-PtdCho, a change in conformation that reduces FRET (e.g. via a distancing of the acceptor-donor couple) or implies that it is principally a product (BODIPY-PtdOH)-based effect, cannot be resolved at present. However, we would emphasize that the mutant PLDs remain localized to the same vesicular compartment as the wild-type protein (5Hughes W.E. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 727-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), suggesting that these mutations do not provoke gross misfolding. As it appeared that FRET was dependent on PLD activity, we investigated whether the stimulation of cells resulted in increases in localized FRET between the GFP and BODIPY moieties. To address this, we chose initially to activate GFP-PLD1b in vivo by the addition of TPA, a potent activator of protein kinase C isoforms. TPA has been shown to activate cellular PLD in many cells types including HeLa cells, and in vitro protein kinase C isoforms are potent activators of recombinant PLD1b (2Liscovitch M. Czarny M. Fiucci G. Tang X. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 401-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 3Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Therefore we measured the fluorescent lifetime of GFP-PLD1b and catalytically inactive PLD1b-K860E in cells pretreated with BODIPY-PtdCho liposomes that were then left untreated or further treated with TPA. The data (Fig.5) indicated that TPA caused a significant additional increase in FRET between GFP-PLD1b and BODIPY-PtdCho on vesicular structures and had no effect on the lack of FRET detected for the catalytically inactive mutant. Thus, it appears that further decreases in GFP lifetime in the presence of BODIPY-PtdCho and PLD1 activators correlate with PLD activity changes. We then investigated the response of PLD1b to the growth factor EGF. The results indicate that EGF treatment caused an increase in detected FRET on GFP-PLD1b vesicles in transfected, BODIPY-PtdCho-loaded cells and that FRET could not be detected in cells transfected with catalytically inactive GFP-PLD1b-K860E (Fig.6). The average lifetimes measured within specific regions of the cell indicated that EGF could induce a further drop in lifetime from 1.75 ± 0.10 to 1.60 ± 0.10 ns in vesicular regions of the cell. The cumulative data shown in Fig. 6,B and C, confirm that significant FRET is seen in GFP-PLD1b-transfected cells treated with EGF. It is important to note that we did not observe FRET between GFP-PLD1b and BODIPY-PtdCho at the plasma membrane. Thus it appears that endosomal PLD1b can indeed be regulated by EGF/EGF-R in that compartment. To confirm these observations, we returned to endosomal fractionation and assessed the levels of PLD activity in the fractions by measuring ethanol-dependent [3H]phosphatidylethanol (PtdEtOH) production from [3H]PtdCho added to the fractions in PtdIns(4,5)P 2-containing liposomes. The results (Fig. 7 A) indicate that PLD activity in all fractions is very low but that in those fractions containing endosomal markers (Fig. 1, fractions 5–8), a PLD activity stimulated by GTPγS is apparent. The catalytic activity of PLD2 is dependent on PtdIns(4,5)P 2 in vitro but is not GTPγS-stimulated, whereas PLD1 isoforms display a dependence on GTP-bound forms of ARF and Rho family small GTPases, some of which would co-fractionate with endosomal vesicles. Furthermore, when purified recombinant myristoylated ARF1 was added to the assays, PLD activity increased further, confirming the presence of PLD1-like activity in these fractions (data not shown). These results suggested that the predominant PLD in these endosomal fractions is likely to be a PLD1 isoform. The fractionation procedure was then applied to extracts from cells prelabeled with [3H]myristic acid (to label endogenous cellular phospholipids, including PtdCho) and subsequently treated with ethanol or ethanol and EGF. In this way, we were able to monitor the compartment(s) in which PLD was activated by EGF. The data indicate that EGF induces an increase in PtdEtOH production in fractions 5–8 (Fig. 6 B), those identified as containing PLD1 and endosomal proteins (Figs. 1 and 7 A), and therefore confirmed that EGF activates PLD in this compartment, leading to the accumulation of this poorly metabolized product. These studies demonstrate that PLD1 is not simply localized in endosomes in HeLa cells but that it is activated in these endosomal compartments after treatment with EGF. This is demonstrated by subcellular fractionation and analysis of the distribution of the accumulated, stable product PtdEtOH and also by exploiting fluorescent probes labeling proteins and lipids. Using these reagents, we were able to analyze protein-phospholipid interactions by measuring FRET through FLIM. The ability to explore protein-lipid interactions through such techniques will provide unrivalled opportunities in unraveling the controls operating in membrane subcompartments."

This process is simulated numerically under an assumption that the density and velocity distributions around the RSG are anisotropic owing to the existence of toroidal magnetic field and coronal holes.

IFNs also down-regulate c-myc expression, activate tumor suppressor pRb, and inhibit transcription factor E2F to inhibit cell cycle progression in human cell lines (10Kimchi A. J. Cell.

Although a great deal is known about IFN signaling pathways and the transcription factors involved, very little is known about the gene products that mediate the tumor-suppressive pathways employed by IFNs. Additionally, despite their beneficial therapeutic effects in certain leukemias, IFNs are marginally active in the therapy of solid tumors (13Gutterman J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1198-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 14Lindner D.J. Kalvakolanu D.V. Borden E.C. Semin. Oncol. 1997; 24: S9-99-S99-104Google Scholar). Clinical and experimental models have shown that the combination of IFNs with retinoids, a class of vitamin A derivatives, yields a highly effective growth-suppressive effect in several solid tumors (15Moore D.M.

All-trans-retinoic acid (RA), a vitamin metabolite, inhibits the growth of promyelocytic leukemias, and teratocarcinomas in vitro (18Love J.M. Gudas L.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Two structurally similar but genetically distinct classes of transcription factors, the retinoic acid receptor and the retinoid X receptor, mediate retinoid-induced growth suppression (19Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2837) Google Scholar). One such receptor, retinoic acid receptor β, appears to be a tumor suppressor (20Faria T.N.

Zhang X.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, the identity of retinoid-regulated growth-inhibitory gene products is unknown. Our earlier studies showed that the combination of IFN-β and RA, but not the single agents, causes cell death in vitro and suppresses tumor growth in vivo (17Lindner D.J. Borden E.C. Kalvakolanu D.V. Clin. Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 931-937PubMed Google Scholar). Using a genetic technique, we have recently identified several genes associated with retinoid-IFN-induced mortality (22Hofmann E.R.

Human thioredoxin reductase (TR) 1, a redox regulatory enzyme (23Arner E.S. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6102-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (2000) Google Scholar, 24Mustacich D. Powis G. Biochem. J. 2000; 346, Part 1: 1-8Crossref Google Scholar), was identified as one of the genes associated with retinoid-IFN-induced mortality (22Hofmann E.R. Boyanapalli M. Lindner D.J. Weihua X. Hassel B.A. Jagus R. Gutierrez P.L. Kalvakolanu D.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6493-6504Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have shown that TR and its substrate, Trx, activate cell death by modulating the activity of caspase-8 and tumor suppressor p53 (25Ma X. Karra S. Lindner D.J., Hu, J. Reddy S.P.

Kalvakolanu D.V. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4235-4248Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To further understand the structure-function relationship of TR to these processes, we have performed a mutational analysis. A comparative analysis of the primary structure of this enzyme with other redox enzymes led to the assignment of three major modules, the FAD, NBD, and ID (23Arner E.S. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6102-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (2000) Google Scholar, 24Mustacich D. Powis G. Biochem. J. 2000; 346, Part 1: 1-8Crossref Google Scholar). Whereas the FAD and NBD are critical for redox function and are well conserved among the TRs from all sources, the ID is unique to mammalian TR. ID has been suggested to act as a dimerization surface to generate functional TR (23Arner E.S. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6102-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (2000) Google Scholar, 24Mustacich D. Powis G. Biochem. J. 2000; 346, Part 1: 1-8Crossref Google Scholar). However, the functional significance of ID has not been fully appreciated. Here we show that removal of ID enhances death-stimulatory activity of TR and p53-dependent gene expression. Restriction and DNA-modifying enzymes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences); G418 sulfate, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen); nylon membranes, ECL reagents, and horseradish peroxidase coupled to anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies (AmershamBiosciences); human IFN-βser (Berlex Inc.); and mouse monoclonal antibodies against actin, FLAG epitope (Sigma), p53 (Oncogene Science Inc.), and myc-epitope (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) were employed in these studies. Rabbit polyclonal antibody against the C-terminal peptide of TR1 was described previously (22Hofmann E.R. Boyanapalli M. Lindner D.J. Weihua X. Hassel B.A. Jagus R. Gutierrez P.L. Kalvakolanu D.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6493-6504Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Fresh stocks of all-trans-retinoic acid (Sigma) were prepared in ethanol and added to cultures under subdued light. MCF-7 cells were cultured in phenol red-free Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum and 10−11m estradiol during treatment with IFN-β and RA. MCF-7 cells stably transfected with wild-type and mutant forms of Trx have been described previously (25Ma X. Karra S. Lindner D.J., Hu, J. Reddy S.P. Kimchi A. Yodoi J. Kalvakolanu D.V. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3703-3715Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The mutant Trx bears serine residues in the place of cysteines at positions 32 and 35 (28). MCF-7 cells stably transfected with mammalian expression vector pCMV-neo (MCF-7 neo) or the same vector with the E6 gene of human papilloma virus type-16 (MCF-7 E6) were provided by A. J. Fornace Jr. (National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD) (29Fan S. Smith M.L. Rivet D.J. Duba D. Zhan Q. Kohn K.W. Fornace A.J. O'Connor P.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1649-1654PubMed Google Scholar). The loss of p53 function in MCF-7 E6 cells has been demonstrated previously (29Fan S. Smith M.L. Rivet D.J. Duba D. Zhan Q. Kohn K.W. Fornace A.J. O'Connor P.M.

DLD human carcinoma cells, which lack endogenous p53, were a gift from Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University Oncology Center, Baltimore, MD). Mammalian expression vector pCMV-FLAG bears a FLAG epitope sequence in its multiple cloning region. An in-frame insertion of any cDNA lacking the N-terminal methionine into this vector generates the protein with a FLAG epitope tag at the N terminus. Mammalian expression vector pCXN2-myc carries a C-terminal myc epitope tag. Cloning of an insert without a “stop” codon between the 5′EcoRI and 3′ KpnI sites of this vector permits the addition of a myc tag to the expressed protein. The p53-Luc reporter carries eight copies of the p53 binding element cloned upstream of the SV40 early promoter in the pGL3 basic vector (Promega) was described earlier. Wild-type and mutant p53 (R175H) cloned in the pCMV expression vector have been described elsewhere (31Baker S.J. Markowitz S. Fearon E.R. Willson J.K. Vogelstein B. Science. 1990; 249: 912-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar, 32Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Seymour A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1992; 256: 827-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). A luciferase reporter driven by human Bax promoter, Bax-Luc, was provided by Carol Prives (Columbia University, New York, NY) (33Gaiddon C. Moorthy N.C. Prives C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5609-5621Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Gene-specific primers bearing specific restriction enzyme-cutting sites (for facilitating subcloning) and AmpliTaq gold enzyme (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were employed in PCR for generating TR mutants. All primers used in this study are listed in Table I. Two separate sets of primers were used to generate myc- and FLAG epitope-tagged constructs. Construction of a myc-tagged full-length TR was described in our earlier publication (26Ma X. Karra S. Guo W. Lindner D.J., Hu, J. Angell J.E. Hofmann E.R. Reddy S.P. Kalvakolanu D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24843-24854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). At first, the myc-tagged mutants were generated, which served as templates for generating FLAG-tagged mutants. Twelve cycles of PCR were performed to avoid the emergence of unwanted mutants due to polymerase errors. Mutants were sequenced to verify their identity.Table IPrimers used in this study Open table in a new tab Mutant Δ-FAD was amplified using myc primers 2 and 3 with wild-type TR cDNA as template. Δ-ID was generated using myc primers 1 and 4. To generate the Δ-NBD mutant, four primers were used. The myc primer 1 and Δ-NBD primer 1 were used to amplify the FAD domain. The myc primer 2 and Δ-NBD primer 2 were used to amplify the ID region. Oligonucleotides used for amplification of the FAD and ID regions have a BamHI site at their 3′ and 5′ ends, respectively. The myc primers 1 and 2 bore EcoRI and KpnI sites. The FAD product was digested with EcoRI and BamHI, and the ID product was digested with BamHI andKpnI and then purified. The products were combined with pCXN2-myc vector predigested with EcoRI and KpnI in a three-way ligation reaction. The final Δ-NBD construct has two non-template-derived amino acids, a glycine and a serine, at the junction of FAD and ID, due to a BamHI site present in the amplifying primers. Constructs f-TR and f-Δ-NBD were generated using FLAG primers 1 and 2, with the corresponding myc-tagged constructs as templates. The f-Δ-ID and f-Δ-FAD mutants were generated using FLAG primers 1 and 4 and FLAG primers 3 and 2, respectively. f-tagged truncated mutants of Δ-ID were generated using the indicated reverse primers and FLAG primer 1, with wild-type TR as template. Point mutants were generated using Δ-ID80 as a template. For example, to generate the T193A mutant, a reverse primer and a forward primer bearing the same mutation were used in a three-step PCR. FLAG primer 1 and reverse primer (mutagenic) were used in the first PCR reaction. Forward primer (mutagenic) and Δ-ID80 R primer were used for the second PCR. Purified PCR products from the first and second PCR were mixed, denatured, and annealed. This mixture now served as template for FLAG primer 1 and Δ-ID80 R primer to generate the final product. The final PCR product was digested with EcoRI and KpnI and ligated to pCMV-FLAG. The other mutants were generated in a very similar manner, using appropriate mutant primers. Cells (2000 cells/well) were seeded into 96-well plates. Drugs were added, and growth was monitored using a colorimetric assay (34Skehan P. Storeng R. Scudiero D. Monks A. McMahon J. Vistica D. Warren J.T. Bokesch H. Kenney S. Boyd M.R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (8869) Google Scholar). Each group of treatments had eight replicates. Cells were fixed with 10% trichloroacetic acid at the end of the experiment and stained with 0.4% sulforhodamine B (Sigma). The bound dye was eluted with 100 μl of Tris-HCl (pH 10.5), and absorbance was monitored at 570 nm. One plate was fixed with trichloroacetic acid, 10 h after plating. Absorbance obtained with this plate was considered as 0% growth. Absorbance obtained with untreated cells was considered as 100% growth. An increase and decrease ofA 570 values in the experimental wells relative to the 0% value indicate cell growth and death, respectively. Cell death was determined using annexin-V binding assays. After treatment with IFN/RA, cells were stained using a commercially available kit (Trevigen Inc.) per the manufacturer's recommendation. FITC-positive cells were considered apoptotic and quantified using flow cytometry. Transfection, β-galactosidase and luciferase assays, SDS-PAGE, and electrophoretic mobility shift analyses (EMSAs) were performed as described in our previous publications (25Ma X. Karra S.

The total amount of transfected DNA (1.0 μg) was kept constant by adding corresponding empty expression vector DNA, where required. In general, 0.2 μg of luciferase and 0.2 μg of TR mutant were co-transfected. CMV β-galactosidase reporter (0.1 μg) was used as an internal control for normalizing variations in transfection efficiency. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay with p53 oligonucleotides was performed as described previously (25Ma X. Karra S. Lindner D.J., Hu, J. Reddy S.P. Kimchi A. Yodoi J. Kalvakolanu D.V.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4235-4248Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Equal quantities of cell extracts were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE and Western blotted onto nylon membranes. Specific first antibodies were incubated with the blots as described in our previous publication (22Hofmann E.R. Boyanapalli M. Lindner D.J. Weihua X. Hassel B.A. Jagus R. Gutierrez P.L. Kalvakolanu D.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6493-6504Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These blots were washed and incubated with an appropriate second antibody tagged with horseradish peroxidase. Protein bands were visualized using a commercially available enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL; AmershamBiosciences). We have shown previously that overexpression of a catalytically inactive TR1 or a redox inactive Trx1 in human tumor cell lines imparts resistance to IFN/RA-induced cell death (25Ma X. Karra S. Lindner D.J., Hu, J. Reddy S.P. Kimchi A. Yodoi J. Kalvakolanu D.V. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3703-3715Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 26Ma X. Karra S. Guo W. Lindner D.J., Hu, J. Angell J.E.

In contrast, a wild-type TR1 and Trx1 promoted cell death under the same conditions. However, the role of other TR domains in cell growth control is unknown. To understand the relationship between structural domains of TR and cell death regulation, we have generated new TR mutants. Using PCR we generated three mutants, Δ-FAD, Δ-NBD, and Δ-ID, which lacked the FAD binding domain, the NADPH binding domain, and the interface domain, respectively. Because no domain-specific antibodies are available for TR1, we have cloned the PCR products into mammalian expression vectors, pCMV-FLAG or pCXN2-myc. Proteins expressed from pCMV-FLAG and pCXN2-myc will bear an N-terminal FLAG- and a C-terminal myc epitope tag, respectively. Wild-type TR produces a polypeptide with a theoretical molecular mass of 54.7 kDa. However, it migrates as a ∼58-kDa protein on SDS-PAGE due to posttranslational modifications. The Δ-FAD, Δ-NBD, and Δ-ID constructs are expected to yield 40.1-, 33.2-, and 27.6-kDa peptides, respectively. The mutants were transiently transfected into human breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7 to check for the production of proteins of proper size. Cell lysates were prepared and Western blotted using either FLAG- or myc epitope-specific monoclonal antibodies. Indeed, all mutants can be expressed to a comparable level upon transfection (Fig. 1, B andC). Both tags were used only to demonstrate that either N-terminal or C-terminal tags have no effect on protein function. Furthermore, pCXN2-myc has a G418 resistance marker (G418r) for selecting stably transfected cells, which is absent from pCMV-FLAG. The FLAG tag is shorter than the myc tag by about 8 amino acids. To test the effect of TR mutants on cell growth, we first generated cell lines that stably express them. Because the pCXN2-myc vector also carries a G418r marker that permits the selection of stable transfectants, we have used the myc-tagged constructs for this purpose. As observed earlier, transfection of a wild-type TR resulted in the formation of fewer colonies than the vector. The Δ-FAD construct gave rise to marginally more colonies than the control vector-transfected cultures, indicating its inhibitory effect on cell death. The Δ-NBD mutant and vector produced a comparable number of colonies. Interestingly, the Δ-ID mutant yielded 75% and 50% fewer G418r colonies than the vector- and TR-transfected cultures, respectively (Fig.2 A). The G418rcolonies in each group were pooled and used in the experiments described below to avoid a clonal bias. In the next experiment, the effect of TR mutants on cell growth was determined using a colorimetric assay (34Skehan P. Storeng R. Scudiero D. Monks A. McMahon J. Vistica D. Warren J.T. Bokesch H. Kenney S. Boyd M.R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (8869) Google Scholar), where cell growth was quantified on the basis of the amount of sulforhodamine B dye bound to cells (Fig. 2 B). This method correlates well with Coulter counting and determination of cell number. Whereas the Δ-FAD-expressing cells grew slightly faster than the vector-transfected cultures, the TR and Δ-ID transfectants grew relatively slower. Expression of Δ-ID caused significantly slower growth compared with TR. Growth of Δ-NBD transfectants was comparable to that of vector transfectants. These observations suggest that removal of ID converts TR into a significantly more potent inhibitor of cell growth. Similar results were obtained with f-tagged TR mutants (data not shown). To demonstrate that these differential effects on cell growth were due to the expression of mutants in the stable transfectants, cell lysates were examined for the expression of transgenes by Western blot analysis with myc tag-specific antibodies (Fig. 2 C). Although all mutants were expressed in the transfectants, wild-type TR and Δ-ID were expressed to a lesser extent. In fact, the expression of Δ-ID was lost with further passages of the transfectants (data not shown), indicating its strong anticellular effects. To demonstrate a functional relationship between cell death and mutant expression, the stable transfectants were exposed to the IFN/RA combination (IFN/RA) and then stained with FITC-labeled annexin-V, a maker for apoptotic death (35van Engeland M. Ramaekers F.C. Schutte B. Reutelingsperger C.P. Cytometry. 1996; 24: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). A higher FITC-positive staining indicates higher apoptosis. FITC-positive cells were quantified using flow cytometry (Fig.2 D). The TR and ID transfectants exhibited a significantly higher sensitivity to IFN/RA-induced cell death compared with the other mutants. The Δ-ID-expressing cells became FITC-positive 2–2.5-fold higher than TR-expressing ones. The FAD mutant acted as an inhibitor of apoptosis because cells expressing it were less FITC-positive than the vector-expressing ones. Together, these data indicate that ID of TR attenuates its proapoptotic effects. To rule out the possibility that the expression of TR or Δ-ID somehow altered the endogenous TR levels to mediate these differential effects, we next determined the levels of endogenous TR protein by Western blotting with antibodies specific for TR. Because only Δ-ID exhibited hyper-death-stimulatory effects, we have selected it for additional studies and compared its effects to full-length TR. As shown in Fig. 3 A, neither the Δ-ID nor wild-type TR had an effect on endogenous TR because its level was comparable between the vector- and mutant-transfected cells. In wild-type TR-transfected cells, a slow migrating band above the TR band was detected. It corresponds to the TR protein derived from the transgene and migrates slower because of the presence of an epitope tag. This band is absent in the vector- or Δ-ID-expressing cells. Because the TR antibody was directed against a peptide in the C terminus, Δ-ID could not be detected. We have shown previously that the cell death effects of TR were due in part to its ability to modulate tumor suppressor p53-dependent responses (25Ma X. Karra S. Lindner D.J., Hu, J. Reddy S.P.

Kalvakolanu D.V. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4235-4248Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the possibility that a rise in endogenous p53 levels of mutant transfectants relative to vector-expressing cells occurred. Expression of Δ-ID or wild-type TR did not significantly affect p53 levels as revealed by a Western blot analysis with an antibody that specifically detects a wild-type p53 protein (Fig. 3 B). We have reported previously that TR modulates p53-dependent cell death via an up-regulation of gene expression (27Hu J., Ma, X. Lindner D.J. Karra S. Hofmann E.R. Reddy S.P. Kalvakolanu D.V. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4235-4248Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To test the influence of TR mutants on p53-stimulated gene expression, we have performed the following experiments. First, we wanted to know whether Δ-ID induces the expression a reporter gene driven by p53 response element. MCF-7 cells were transfected with a p53RE-Luc reporter. Along with the reporter pCMV-FLAG, wild-type f-TR or f-Δ-ID mutant was co-transfected (Fig.4 A). Because the FLAG tag is shorter and yielded a slightly better expression in transient assays, we used the FLAG-tagged mutants for the following studies. Nevertheless, the myc-tagged mutants exhibited properties similar to those of the FLAG-tagged ones (data not shown). After transfection, cells were treated with IFN/RA, and luciferase activity was measured. IFN/RA induced luciferase expression in the vector transfectants. In TR transfectants, basal luciferase activity was elevated, and it was further strongly induced by IFN/RA. Δ-ID co-expression strongly enhanced luciferase expression, and it was only slightly but significantly stimulated further by IFN/RA. Δ-ID induced slightly higher luciferase expression than the IFN/RA-treated, TR co-expressed control. Previously, we have shown that Bax, a p53-responsive mRNA, and its protein are induced in the presence of wild-type TR and inhibited in the presence of a catalytically inactive mutant. Because p53-Luc used in this experiment contained a synthetic promoter, we next explored whether Δ-ID exerted a similar effect on a native promoter. A luciferase reporter driven by human Bax has been shown to respond to p53 (33Gaiddon C. Moorthy N.C. Prives C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5609-5621Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 36Miyashita T.

https://openalex.org/W2615223907,"The 14-3-3 protein is a family of highly conserved acidic proteins found in a wide range of eukaryotes from yeast to mammals. 14-3-3 acts as an adapter protein and interacts with signaling molecules including protein kinase C (PKC). Although 14-3-3 ζ was originally characterized as an endogenous PKC inhibitor, it was reported to activate PKC in vitro, but the in vivo regulation of PKC by 14-3-3 is still not well understood. To examine the regulation of PKC by 14-3-3 in the cell, we have generated a sub-cell line, PC12-B3, that stably expresses FLAG epitope-tagged 14-3-3 ζ isoform in PC12 cells. Here we show that PKC-α and PKC-ε become associated with 14-3-3 ζ when the cells are neuronally differentiated by nerve growth factor. We found that the immunoprecipitate by anti-FLAG antibody contains constitutive and autonomous Ca2+-independent non-classical PKC activity. In contrast, the FLAG immunoprecipitate has no Ca2+-dependent classical PKC activity despite the fact that PKC-α is present in the FLAG immunoprecipitate from differentiated PC12-B3 cells. Our results show that the association with 14-3-3 ζ has distinct effects on classical PKC and non-classical PKC activity. The 14-3-3 protein is a family of highly conserved acidic proteins found in a wide range of eukaryotes from yeast to mammals. 14-3-3 acts as an adapter protein and interacts with signaling molecules including protein kinase C (PKC). Although 14-3-3 ζ was originally characterized as an endogenous PKC inhibitor, it was reported to activate PKC in vitro, but the in vivo regulation of PKC by 14-3-3 is still not well understood. To examine the regulation of PKC by 14-3-3 in the cell, we have generated a sub-cell line, PC12-B3, that stably expresses FLAG epitope-tagged 14-3-3 ζ isoform in PC12 cells. Here we show that PKC-α and PKC-ε become associated with 14-3-3 ζ when the cells are neuronally differentiated by nerve growth factor. We found that the immunoprecipitate by anti-FLAG antibody contains constitutive and autonomous Ca2+-independent non-classical PKC activity. In contrast, the FLAG immunoprecipitate has no Ca2+-dependent classical PKC activity despite the fact that PKC-α is present in the FLAG immunoprecipitate from differentiated PC12-B3 cells.

It is estimated that ∼1% of the total cytosolic proteins expressed in the mammalian brain is 14-3-3 (2Aitken A. Amess B. Howell S. Jones D. Martin H. Patel Y. Robinson K. Toker A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1992; 20: 607-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). 14-3-3 acts as an adapter protein and interacts with signaling molecules to mediate a wide variety of cellular events such as cell cycle regulation, cell growth and differentiation, anti-apoptosis, and synaptic transmission (For review, see Refs. 3Russell P.

In the brain cytosol, seven 14-3-3 subspecies (α, β, γ, δ, ε, η, and ζ) were chromatographically separated, and of these, α and δ were found to be phosphorylated forms of β and ζ, respectively (6Aitken A. Howell S. Jones D. Madrazo J. Patel Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5706-5709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In addition, the θ isoform was also found in the rat brain (7Watanabe M. Isobe T. Ichimura T. Kuwano R. Takahashi Y. Kondo H. Inoue Y. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 25: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and was originally discovered in the T cell line as 14-3-3 τ (8Nielsen P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1088: 425-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, at least six 14-3-3 isoforms are present in the mammalian brain. leonardo, a Drosophila gene homologue of the vertebrate 14-3-3 ζ, is expressed in abundance in mushroom bodies, and mutants with low levels of expression of leonardo show deficiency in olfactory learning (9Skoulakis E.M. Davis R.L. Neuron. 1996; 17: 931-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The Leonardo protein is also highly enriched in the presynaptic boutons in the fly neuromuscular junction (10Broadie K. Rushton E. Skoulakis E.M. Davis R.L. Neuron. 1997; 19: 391-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Significant reduction of glutamate synaptic transmission has been observed at the neuromuscular junctions ofleonardo (−/−) null mutant larvae, and this effect is attributed to a presynaptic mechanism (10Broadie K. Rushton E. Skoulakis E.M. Davis R.L. Neuron. 1997; 19: 391-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, the Leonardo protein was recently shown inDrosophila neuromuscular junction to form a complex with the Ca 2+ -dependent K+channel, Slowpoke, at the presynaptic nerve terminals (11Zhou Y. Schopperle W.M. Murrey H. Jaramillo A. Dagan D. Griffith L.C. Levitan I.B. Neuron. 1999; 22: 809-818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Although very little is known regarding the function of vertebrate 14-3-3 ζ in neuronal cells, several lines of evidence indicate that it plays a role in synaptic function in vertebrates as well. Immunological and biochemical studies show that mammalian 14-3-3 ζ localizes in synapses in the rat brain (12Martin H. Rostas J. Patel Y. Aitken A. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 2259-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The 14-3-3 protein was involved in exocytosis; it stimulates Ca 2+ -dependent catecholamine release from digitonin-permeabilized adrenal chromaffin cells (13Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. Nature. 1992; 355: 833-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 14Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 807-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 15Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A.

Burgoyne R.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). One of the target molecules of 14-3-3 is protein kinase C (PKC).1 14-3-3, originally discovered as an activator protein for tyrosine hydroxylase and tryptophan hydroxylase (17Yamauchi T. Nakata H. Fujisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5404-5409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was isolated as an endogenouskinase Cinhibitoryprotein (KCIP) (18Toker A. Ellis C.A. Sellers L.A. Aitken A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). It was later found that KCIP was identical to the 14-3-3 protein (19Toker A. Sellers L.A. Amess B. Patel Y. Harris A. Aitken A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, it has been reported that 14-3-3 ζ activates rather than inhibits PKC in vitro(20Isobe T. Hiyane Y. Ichimura T. Okuyama T. Takahashi N. Nakajo S. Nakaya K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 308: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 21Tanji M. Horwitz R. Rosenfeld G. Waymire J.C. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1908-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, although 14-3-3 was initially characterized as a PKC inhibitor, its effect on PKC is still not clear. Because PKC is critical for neuronal differentiation in PC12 cells (22Hundle B. McMahon T. Dadgar J. Messing R.O. J. Biol.

Lazarovici P. Petrovics G. Anderson W.B. Blumberg P.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 183-191PubMed Google Scholar), we have investigated whether the interaction between PKC and 14-3-3 ζ takes place and how it affects the PKC activity in neuronal cells. For this purpose, we have established a sub-cell line of PC12 cells (PC12-B3 cells) that stably express FLAG epitope-tagged 14-3-3 ζ. Here we show the selective association of 14-3-3 ζ with PKC-α and PKC-ε in NGF- differentiated PC12-B3 cells. Furthermore, we found that the 14-3-3 ζ immunoprecipitate by anti-FLAG antibody from the NGF-differentiated cells contains Ca2+-independent non-classical PKC (nPKC) activity. This nPKC is constitutively active and does not require any addition of PKC activators. Such constitutive activation of nPKC in the 14-3-3 ζ complex might play an important role in neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells by NGF. 14-3-3 ζ cDNA isolated from rat hippocampal cDNA library (pB5BN7, Ref. 27Murakami K. Situ S.Y. Eshete F. Gene. 1996; 179: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and subcloned in mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (clone pc14ζ12) was used for the study. FLAG epitope (Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys) was tagged at the C terminus of 14-3-3 ζ and subcloned at NotI andHindIII sites of pcDNA3 as follows. FLAG-tagged 14-3-3 ζ cDNA was amplified by PCR using pc14ζ12 as a template with a FLAG-tagging primer containing NotI overhang (ATAGTTTAGCGGCCGCTTACTTGTCATCG TCGTCCTTGTAGTCATTTTCCCCTCCTTCTCC) and T7 primer (AATACGACTCACTATAGGG) with Pfu DNA polymerase (CLONTECH). The amplified cDNA was digested byHindIII and NotI and subcloned in pcDNA3 at these sites (clone pC14ζ-FLAG). Fidelity of the amplified cDNA was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Rat 14-3-3 ζ has three protein variant forms (Met88-Ala109, Thr88-Ala109, and Thr88-Arg109) (27Murakami K. Situ S.Y. Eshete F. Gene. 1996; 179: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). To determine which 14-3-3 ζ variant is expressed in PC12 cells, we performed reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA from PC12 cells was isolated using RNA isolation kit (Ambion) and reverse-transcribed for cDNA synthesis by avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase using oligo-dT primer. Endogenous 14-3-3 ζ cDNA was amplified by PCR and sequenced. PC12 cells were cultured in collagen–coated dishes containing 15 ml of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum in a humidified incubator (95% air, 5% CO2) at 37 °C (28Greene L.A. Sobeih M.M. Teng K.K. Banker G. Goslin K. Culturing Nerve Cells. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1991: 207-226Google Scholar). The medium was changed every 2 days and split once a week. Parental PC12 cells and its sub-cell line PC12-B3, which expresses FLAG epitope-tagged 14-3-3 ζ, were differentiated by 50 ng/ml NGF. For transfection, 1.4 × 105 cells were plated in a 60-mm collagen-coated dish and grown in the serum containing RPMI 1640 media overnight. Before transfection, cells were washed three times with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in 5 ml of OptiMEM (Invitrogen) for 45 min. After the incubation, 2.5 ml of the medium was removed and replaced with the same amount of OptiMEM containing 30 μg of pC14ζ-FLAG and 60 μl of Lipofectin (Invitrogen) and incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. OptiMEM was then added for a final volume of 10 ml and further incubated for 30 h. After this transfection, the medium was replaced with RPMI 1640 with 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum, and the cells were maintained for 1 week. PC12 sub-cell lines that stably express FLAG epitope-tagged 14-3-3 ζ were selected based on the neomycin resistance. The transfected cells were grown in the presence of 500 μg/ml G418 for 6 days, and the surviving single cells were removed and expanded in a collagen-coated 12-well plate in serum-containing preconditioned RPMI 1640 media. Immunoblot analysis was carried out by a standard procedure (29Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 471-510Google Scholar). Anti-FLAG (Eastman Kodak Co, Sigma), anti-14-3-3 ζ (Santa Cruz), and isoform-specific anti PKC antibodies (Transduction Laboratories, Santa Cruz) were used for the study. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse (Amresco, Santa Cruz) or anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) were employed as the secondary antibody, and the blot was visualized using the ECL method (Amersham Biosciences). In some experiments that required quantification, we directly measured chemiluminescence using FluorS Multi-imager (Bio-Rad) and analyzed by Quantity 1 program. The following immunoprecipitation procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Cells grown on 100-mm collagen-coated dishes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline twice before lysis. RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors (20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml chymostatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) were added for cell lysis and incubated for 30 min. The cell lysate was collected, triturated, and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. To preclear the cell lysate, the supernatant was mixed with 20 μl of protein A beads (Invitrogen), incubated for 30 min while rocking, and centrifuged for 15 min at 1000 × g. Precleared samples were incubated with a primary antibody for 2 h with rocking, and then protein A beads were added, incubated for 1 h, and centrifuged at 1000 × g. The immunoprecipitates were collected and washed three times with RIPA buffer. The activity of PKC of the immunoprecipitates with FLAG antibody from differentiated or undifferentiated cells was measured using two PKC assay systems that were optimized for Ca2+-dependent cPKC activity and for Ca2+-independent non-classical novel and atypical PKC activities (hereafter cPKC and nPKC assay, respectively). The FLAG immunoprecipitates for PKC assay were prepared from cell culture grown in 100-mm collagen-coated dish. The immunoprecipitated samples were washed 3 times with ice-cold dilution buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4), centrifuged at 12,000 × g, and then diluted to 250 μl with ice-cold dilution buffer. Ten μl of the aliquot was assayed to measure PKC activity in the presence of 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with the appropriate concentrations of Ca 2+ , PKC substrate, and PKC activators or inhibitors as specified below or in the figure legends. For Ca2+-dependent cPKC assay, 400 μg/ml lysine-rich histone (Type IIIS: Sigma) was used for the assay at 500 μm free Ca 2+ . nPKC assay was performed in the absence of Ca 2+ using 100 μg/ml peptide-ε (Bacham) as a PKC substrate in the presence of 1 mm EGTA. The selection of PKC substrates was based on the difference in specificity between cPKCs and nPKCs; lysine-rich histone is a good substrate of PKC-α, -β, and -γ and can be readily phosphorylated by these cPKCs, but it is a poor substrate for Ca 2+ -independent PKCs (30Olivier A.R. Kiley S.C. Pears C. Schaap D. Jaken S. Parker P.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1992; 20: 603-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In contrast, nPKC activity is poor toward histone, but it effectively phosphorylates peptide-ε (30Olivier A.R. Kiley S.C. Pears C. Schaap D. Jaken S. Parker P.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1992; 20: 603-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). For calcium dependence experiments, total Ca 2+ concentrations to achieve appropriate free Ca 2+ concentrations were controlled by taking account of multiple equilibria with EGTA, ATP, and Mg2+(31Brooks S.P.J. Storey K.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). A phosphorylation reaction was initiated by adding [γ-32P]ATP (final concentration, 75 μm; 150–200 cpm/pmol) to a reaction tube in a total volume of 50 μl. After a 20 min incubation at 30 °C, protein A-Sepharose beads in the reaction mixture was centrifuged by pulse spin, 30 μl of the supernatant was spotted onto phosphocellulose paper, and the radioactivity was counted after the wash. Our previous study showed that there are several variants of 14-3-3 ζ cloned from mammalian brain. These variations are composed of the amino acids Met ↔ Thr at position 88, Ala ↔ Arg at 109, and Pro ↔ Ala at 112. In the rat brain, Met ↔ Thr and Ala ↔ Arg 14-3-3 ζ variants are present (27Murakami K. Situ S.Y. Eshete F. Gene. 1996; 179: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Because the 14-3-3 protein binds to a variety of signaling molecules and acts as an adapter/scaffold protein, these variations may have effects on partner proteins for the interaction. To avoid the ambiguity due to the 14-3-3 ζ protein variants, we have identified the endogenous 14-3-3 ζ in PC12 cells by reverse transcription-PCR. This analysis showed that endogenous 14-3-3 ζ contains Met, Ala, and Pro at the respective positions. We have added a FLAG epitope tag to this variant 14-3-3 ζ and expressed the variant in PC12 cells. To establish PC12 sub-cell lines that stably express the FLAG-14-3-3 ζ, transfected cells were initially selected with G418, and the surviving cells were individually picked and expanded. To determine whether these clones express the epitope-tagged 14-3-3 ζ, they were screened by Western blot using antibodies against FLAG epitope and 14-3-3 ζ. 14-3-3 ζ antibody recognized 30- and 31-kDa doublet bands, whereas the anti-FLAG antibody only recognized the 31-kDa band in positive clones that express FLAG epitope-tagged 14-3-3 ζ (data not shown). This indicates that the 30-kDa protein is the endogenous 14-3-3 ζ, whereas 31-kDa protein is the recombinant 14-3-3 ζ with the size increase due to the addition of a FLAG tag. There was no apparent difference in B3, one of the expanded clonal sub-cell line, in morphology and the sensitivity to NGF from the parent PC12 cells. We therefore used PC12-B3 as a PC12 sub cell-line that stably expresses epitope-tagged 14-3-3 ζ. To investigate the interaction between 14-3-3 ζ and PKC, we first determined the PKC isoforms that are expressed in PC12-B3 cells and its parent PC12 cell line. Significant immunoreactivity against PKC-α, -δ, -ε, -ζ, -λ(ι), and -μ were found, but we could not detect immunoreactivity against PKC-β, -γ, and -θ in PC12-B3 or in the parent PC12 cell line (see TableI). Because PKC has been shown to play a role in neuronal as well as NGF-induced PC12 cell differentiation, we have attempted to determine whether the 14-3-3 ζ association with PKC is different in differentiated cells when compared with undifferentiated cells. We first examined PKC-ε since it is among the PKC isoforms critical for PC12 cell differentiation (22Hundle B. McMahon T. Dadgar J. Messing R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30134-30140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 23Hundle B. McMahon T. Dadgar J. Chen C.H. Mochly-Rosen D. Messing R.O. J. Biol.

As shown in Fig 1, PKC-ε co-immunoprecipitates with FLAG-14-3-3 ζ in differentiated PC12-B3 cells but not in undifferentiated cells. The anti-PKC-ε antibody immunoprecipitated sample contains FLAG-14-3-3 ζ (Fig.1 A), whereas the anti-FLAG antibody immunoprecipitate contains PKC-ε (Fig. 1 B) in the differentiated cells. In contrast, co-immunoprecipitation of PKC-ε and FLAG-14-3-3 ζ cannot be detected from undifferentiated cells, even though both are present in these cells, and the levels of expression of 14-3-3 ζ and PKC-ε remain constant during differentiation.Table IPresence of PKC subtypes in PC12-B3 cells and their association with 14-3-3 ζ in undifferentiated and differentiated stagesPKC subtypesPresence in PC12-B3 cellsCo-immunoprecipitation with 14-3-3 ζUndifferentiatedDifferentiatedα+−+β−−−γ−−−δ+++ε+−+ζ+++λ (ι)+−−μ+++θ−−− Open table in a new tab To examine whether PKC-ε associates not only with the recombinant 14-3-3 ζ but also with the endogenous 14-3-3 ζ in a manner dependent on neuronal differentiation, we prepared immunoprecipitation samples using anti-14-3-3 ζ antibody from undifferentiated and NGF-differentiated PC12 cells. As shown in Fig.2, endogenous 14-3-3 ζ co-immunoprecipitates with PKC-ε only from NGF-differentiated cells, but the co-immunoprecipitation is not detected from undifferentiated PC12 cells. Thus, PKC-ε interacts with both the recombinant FLAG-14-3-3 ζ as well as with the endogenous 14-3-3 ζ in neuronally differentiated PC12 cells but not in undifferentiated cells. One of the key questions regarding the association of PKC-ε with 14-3-3 ζ is whether this complex formation is acutely induced by the receptor activation by NGF or if it is a reflection of the differentiated state of PC12 cells. To determine this, we measured the time course of the complex formation of PKC-ε and 14-3-3 ζ by examining FLAG immunoprecipitates from PC12 B-3 cells treated with NGF with a time course of 5 min to 8 days. Co-immunoprecipitation of PKC-ε and FLAG 14-3-3 ζ can be seen only after 5 days of NGF treatment, as shown in Fig. 3. This slow onset of the association indicates that the complex formation is not due to the acute effect of stimulation of NGF receptors, but it is associated at the final differentiation stage of PC12 cells. We have tested whether the PKC-ε/14-3-3 ζ interaction is specific to this PKC isoform. Among the immunoreactivity found in this sub-cell line, we have found that PKC-α, δ, -ζ, and -μ isoforms also associate with FLAG-14-3-3, as shown in Fig. 4. However, the interaction of these PKC isoforms with 14-3-3 ζ is different with respect to differentiation. PKC-ζ and -μ isoforms were immunoprecipitated with FLAG antibody regardless of differentiation, suggesting that they interact with 14-3-3 ζ constitutively. PKC-δ is also present in the FLAG immunoprecipitates from both undifferentiated and differentiated cells. However, the association of PKC-δ with FLAG-14-3-3 ζ shows a consistent increase during differentiation (n = 3), suggesting that the interaction of this PKC isoform with 14-3-3 ζ could also be sensitive to NGF-induced neuronal differentiation. Contrary to the PKC-ζ, -μ, and -δ isoforms, co-immunoprecipitation of PKC-α with 14-3-3 ζ can be detected only when the cells were neuronally differentiated. We could not detect PKC-α immunoreactivity, however, in the FLAG immunoprecipitate prepared from undifferentiated cells, indicating that either this isoform is not present in the immunoprecipitate or the level is too low for detection. Thus, the interaction between PKC-α and 14-3-3 ζ in PC12-B3 cells depends on the state of differentiation. These experiments show that PKC isoforms bind to 14-3-3 ζ in a differentiation-dependent as well as -independent manner. The results are summarized in Table I. The FLAG immunoprecipitate contains several PKC isoforms, Ca 2+ -dependent PKC-α and Ca 2+ -independent PKC-δ, -ε, -ζ, and -μ in NGF-differentiated PC12-B3 cells. To distinguish Ca 2+ -dependent and Ca 2+ -independent PKC activities, we developed assays that detect these PKC activities in the FLAG immunoprecipitates as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Using these assays, we measured the PKC activity in the FLAG immunoprecipitates from differentiated and undifferentiated PC12 B-3 cells. Parent PC12 cells that do not express FLAG epitope-tagged 14-3-3 ζ was used as a negative control. As shown in Fig. 5, significant Ca 2+ -independent PKC activity was detected in the immunoprecipitate from NGF-differentiated cells, even in the absence of PKC activators. This activity can be further stimulated by TPA but inhibited to the basal level by a serine/threonine kinase inhibitor H7 or by GF109203X, a PKC-specific inhibitor (see Fig. 8). In contrast, the immunoprecipitate from undifferentiated cells has no detectable Ca 2+ -independent PKC activity. These results show that 14-3-3 ζ-PKC complex in differentiated cells has constitutive and autonomous Ca 2+ -independent nPKC activity, whereas the complex in undifferentiated cells does not have detectable activity of nPKC.Figure 8Sensitivity to Ca2+ and arachidonic acid of the nPKC activity in FLAG immunoprecipitate from NGF-differentiated PC12-B3 cells.

Measurement of nPKC activity and control of free Ca2+ concentrations are described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) PKC-α, a Ca 2+ -dependent cPKC, becomes associated with 14-3-3 ζ during neuronal differentiation induced by NGF. However, there was no detectable Ca2+-dependent PKC activity in the immunoprecipitate regardless of differentiation as shown in Fig.6. Furthermore, TPA has no effect on the PKC activity. The lack of activity in the tested samples is not due to a failure of the detection of cPKC activity, since purified PKC-α can be activated in this cPKC assay system as shown in theinset. Because PKC-β or -γ isoforms are not present in the FLAG immunoprecipitate, these results suggest that PKC-α associated with 14-3-3 ζ in differentiated cells is inactive and insensitive to PKC activators. However, it is possible that the lack of cPKC activity could be simply due to an amount of PKC-α present in the immunoprecipitate that was too small for detection. To examine this, we have done parallel experiments in which we measure the amount of PKC-α in the immunoprecipitate by comparing with known quantities of purified PKC-α to determine the amount of the enzyme and cPKC kinase activity in the immunoprecipitate. As shown in Fig.7, the immunoprecipitate used for cPKC assay (lanes 1 and 2 shown in duplicate) emitted chemiluminescence of 289 ± 142 (arbitrary unit), whereas there was no chemiluminescence observed for purified PKC-α up to 5 ng. The detection of purified PKC-α requires at least 5–10 ng of the enzyme (Fig. 7 B). Based on these analyses, the amount of PKC-α in the immunoprecipitated sample used for cPKC assay was estimated to be ∼6 ng/reaction tube. The activity of purified PKC-α could be clearly detected as low as 0.2 ng in the cPKC activity used for the study (data not shown). On the contrary, the 14-3-3 ζ immunoprecipitate visualized in Fig. 7 A is only at the background level (Table II). Based on these analyses, we conclude that the PKC-α is inactive in the immunoprecipitate from differentiated PC12 cells.Figure 7Quantification of PKC -α in the 14-3-3 ζ immunoprecipitate by chemiluminescence. A, to quantify the amount of PKC-α in the immunoprecipitate (IP) sample from differentiated PC12 cells, immunoprecipitate samples and different amounts of purified PKC-α used for cPKC assay were analyzed by Western blot followed by chemiluminescent measurements. Lanes 1 and 2, IP samples diluted 1:10 for cPKC assay shown in Table II. Lanes 3 and 4, undiluted immunoprecipitate samples from differentiated PC12 cells prepared in separate experiments. Lanes 5–8, different quantities (5–0.04 ng) of purified PKC-α. Lane 9, hippocampal lysate used for a positive control. B, chemiluminescence at higher quantities (50–0.4 ng) of purified PKC-α measured under the same conditions as in A.

 discusses the question of stem cell import in the context of the more fundamental debate about the moral status of the early human embryo. He criticizes the draft law for avoiding any clear decision and predicts that it will soon need to be amended."
