https://openalex.org/W1965388358,"A unique mRNA produced in leukemic cells from a t(15;17) acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patient encodes a fusion protein between the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR alpha) and a myeloid gene product called PML. PML contains a cysteine-rich region present in a new family of apparent DNA-binding proteins that includes a regulator of the interleukin-2 receptor gene (Rpt-1) and the recombination-activating gene product (RAG-1). Accordingly, PML may represent a novel transcription factor or recombinase. The aberrant PML-RAR fusion product, while typically retinoic acid responsive, displays both cell type- and promoter-specific differences from the wild-type RAR alpha. Because patients with APL can be induced into remission with high dose RA therapy, we propose that the nonliganded PML-RAR protein is a new class of dominant negative oncogene product. Treatment with RA would not only relieve this inhibition, but the activated PML-RAR protein may actually promote myelocyte differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2063083122,"We have previously shown that the t(15;17) translocation specifically associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) fuses the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR alpha) locus to an as yet unknown gene, initially called myl and now renamed PML. We report here that this gene product contains a novel zinc finger motif common to several DNA-binding proteins. The PML-RAR alpha mRNA encodes a predicted 106 kd chimeric protein containing most of the PML sequences fused to a large part of RAR alpha, including its DNA- and hormone-binding domains. In transient expression assays, the hybrid protein exhibits altered transactivating properties if compared with the wild-type RAR alpha progenitor. Identical PML-RAR alpha fusion points are found in several patients. These observations suggest that in APL, the t(15;17) translocation generates an RAR mutant that could contribute to leukemogenesis through interference with promyelocytic differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2098089372,The 3 angstrom resolution crystal structure of the Escherichia coli catabolite gene activator protein (CAP) complexed with a 30-base pair DNA sequence shows that the DNA is bent by 90°. This bend results almost entirely from two 40° kinks that occur between TG/CA base pairs at positions 5 and 6 on each side of the dyad axis of the complex. DNA sequence discrimination by CAP derives both from sequence-dependent distortion of the DNA helix and from direct hydrogen-bonding interactions between three protein side chains and the exposed edges of three base pairs in the major groove of the DNA. The structure of this transcription factor—DNA complex provides insights into possible mechanisms of transcription activation.
https://openalex.org/W2090872672,"The neurotransmitter glutamate mediates excitatory synaptic transmission throughout the brain. A family of genes encoding subunits of the non- N -methyl-D-aspartate (non-NMDA) type of glutamate receptor has been cloned. Some combinations of these subunits assemble into receptors with a substantial permeability to calcium, whereas others do not. To investigate the structural features that control ion permeation through these ligand-gated channels, mutant receptor subunits with single-amino acid changes were constructed. Mutation of a certain amino acid that results in a net charge change (from glutamine to arginine or vice versa) alters both the current-voltage relation and the calcium permeability of non-NMDA receptors. A site has thus been identified that regulates the permeation properties of these glutamate receptors."

https://openalex.org/W2019894624,"The intracellular localization of the S. cerevisiae transcription factor SWI5 is cell cycle dependent. The protein is nuclear in G1 cells but cytoplasmic in S, G2, and M phase cells. We have identified SWI5's nuclear localization signal (NLS) and show that it can confer cell cycle-dependent nuclear entry to a heterologous protein. Located within or close to the NLS are three serine residues, mutation of which results in constitutive nuclear entry. These residues are phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner in vivo, being phosphorylated when SWI5 is in the cytoplasm and dephosphorylated when it is in the nucleus. As all three serines are phosphorylated by purified CDC28-dependent H1 kinase activity in vitro, we propose a model in which the CDC28 kinase acts directly to control nuclear entry of SWI5."
https://openalex.org/W1973461983,"Xenopus eggs contain two distinct cdc2 homologs of 34 and 32 kd. We show that the 32 kd cdc2 protein, like the 34 kd protein, is a kinase. However, unlike the 34 kd homolog, the 32 kd cdc2 kinase activity does not decrease dramatically at the end of mitosis. The 32 kd protein does not associate with mitotic cyclins B1 and B2 but does associate with cyclin A and a novel doublet of proteins of 54 kd that may regulate its activity. We also show that depletion of the 32 kd cdc2 homolog from a Xenopus extract blocks DNA replication, but does not inhibit entry into mltosis. By contrast, depletion of the 34 kd cdc2 homolog or absence of mitotic cyclins from an extract does not inhibit replication, but does block entry into mitosis. Our results indicate that in higher eukaryotes, DNA replication (G1-S) and mitosis (G2-M) may be controlled by distinctly different cdc2 proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1965769301,"Transposable elements of the P family in Drosophila are thought to transpose by a cut-and-paste process that leaves a double-strand gap. The repair of such gaps resulted in the transfer of up to several kilobase pairs of information from a homologous template sequence to the site of P element excision by a process similar to gene conversion. The template was an in vitro-modified sequence that was tested at various genomic positions. Characterization of 123 conversion tracts provided a detailed description of their length and distribution. Most events were continuous conversion tracts that overlapped the P insertion site without concomitant conversion of the template. The average conversion tract was 1379 base pairs, and the distribution of tract lengths fit a simple model of gap enlargement. The conversion events occurred at sufficiently high frequencies to form the basis of an efficient means of directed gene replacement."
https://openalex.org/W1546229037,"The complete structure of the human gene for 92-kDa type IV collagenase was determined. Two overlapping genomic clones spanning 26 kilobases (kb) of genomic DNA were shown to contain the entire 7.7-kb structural gene together with 15 and 3.5 kb of 5'-end and 3'-end flanking regions, respectively. The 92-kDa type IV collagenase gene contains 13 exons as does the 72-kDa type IV collagenase gene. All intron locations of the 92-kDa enzyme gene coincided with intron locations in the 72-kDa enzyme gene. Exons 5, 6, and 7 which were 174, 174, and 177 base pairs long, respectively, each encoded one complete internal repeat which resembles the collagen-binding domains of fibronectin. The sequence coding for a unique 48-residue segment in the 92-kDa type IV collagenase that has no counterpart in other metalloproteinases was not present in a separate exon, but was contained in exon 9 which also codes for sequences with homology to the other metalloproteinases. The initiation site for transcription was determined by primer extension analysis. Sequencing analysis of 599 base pairs of the 5'-end flanking region showed that the promoter does not have a TATA motif, but a TTAAA sequence at position -29 to -25. A CAAT motif was not observed but there was one GC box. Two putative 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) response elements, that might serve as binding sites for the transcription factor AP-1 and a consensus sequence of a transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) inhibitory element were found in the promoter region. Gelatinase assay of enzyme secreted by cultured human fibrosarcoma cells (HT-1080) revealed only low levels of 92-kDa type IV collagenase activity, whereas considerable activity of the 72-kDa enzyme was present. Northern hybridization analysis confirmed these findings. Treatment of the HT-1080 cells with TPA resulted in induction of the secretion of 92-kDa type IV collagenase activity. This induction could not be significantly inhibited by concomitant incubation with TGF-beta 1. TPA and TGF-beta 1 did not markedly affect the activities of the 72-kDa enzyme. The activities of the secreted 92- and 72-kDa enzymes by HT-1080 cells correlated with the amounts of mRNA as estimated by Northern analyses."
https://openalex.org/W1542081345,"A derivative of ubiquitin in which amino groups were blocked by reductive methylation was used to study the possible role of the ubiquitin pathway in the cell cycle-programmed degradation of cyclin. It was shown previously that methylated ubiquitin can be efficiently ligated to protein substrates, but cannot form polyubiquitin chains. In the well-characterized ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic system from reticulocytes, it was found that rates of protein breakdown obtained with methylated ubiquitin are generally slower than those with ubiquitin; and thus, this derivative can be used, in some cases, as an inhibitor of ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation. The addition of methylated ubiquitin to a cell-free system from fertilized clam oocytes inhibited the degradation of both cyclins A and B. That this was due to specific interference with ubiquitin function was indicated by the observation that the supplementation of excess ubiquitin completely overcame the inhibitory action of methylated ubiquitin on cyclin degradation. These findings suggest that polyubiquitin chain formation is required for cyclin degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2012768706,"The subcellular localization of the mouse Ltk transmembrane protein tyrosine kinase was studied in transfected COS cells, a mature B lymphocyte line, and a low expressing transfected lymphocyte clone. Indirect immunofluorescence and immunogold staining of COS transfectants and endoglycosidase analysis of both COS transfectants and lymphocytes indicate the unusual localization of Ltk to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Ltk resembles a receptor tyrosine kinase; it has a short, glycosylated, and cysteine-rich N-terminal domain. Yet, it appears to function in a ligand-independent mechanism: its in vivo catalytic activity is markedly enhanced by alkylating and thioloxidizing agents, and the active fraction of the protein occurs as disulfide-linked multimers. The catalytic activity of Ltk in the ER may be regulated via changes in the cellular redox potential, a novel mechanism for regulating protein tyrosine kinases. The ability to respond to redox changes in the cell may, however, be shared with certain receptor kinases during their passage through the ER."
https://openalex.org/W2047466377,"Pit-1, a tissue-specific POU domain transcription factor, is required for the activation of the prolactin, growth hormone, and Pit-1 promoters that confer regulation by epidermal growth factor, adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP), and phorbol esters. Pit-1 is phosphorylated in pituitary cells at two distinct sites in response to phorbol esters and cAMP. Phosphorylation of Pit-1 modifies its conformation on DNA recognition elements and results in increased binding at certain sites and decreased binding at other sites, dependent on DNA sequences adjacent to the core Pit-1 binding motif. One residue (Thr220), located in the POU homeodomain within a sequence conserved throughout the POU-domain family, confers these responses."
https://openalex.org/W1556248806,"Cellular retinoic acid binding protein (CRABP) has been expressed efficiently in Escherichia coli from the cDNA of bovine adrenal CRABP and characterized, especially with respect to affinity for endogenous retinoids and a role for it in retinoic acid metabolism. The purified E. coli-expressed CRABP was similar to authentic mammalian CRABP in molecular weight (approximately 14,700), isoelectric point (4.76), absorbance maxima (apo-CRABP, 280 nm; holo-CRABP, 350 and 280 nm with the ratio A350/A280 = 1.8), and in fluorescence excitation (350 nm) and emission spectra (475 nm). The equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd, of E. coli-derived CRABP and all-trans-retinoic acid was 10 +/- 1 nM (mean +/- S.D., n = 4) by retinoid fluorescence and 7 +/- 1 nM (mean +/- S.D., n = 3) by quenching of protein fluorescence, but neither retinol nor retinal bound in concentrations as high as 7 microM. All-trans-cyclohexyl ring derivatives of retinoic acid (3,4-didehydro-, 4-hydroxy-, 4-oxo-, 16-hydroxy-4-oxo-, 18-hydroxy-) had affinities similar to that of all-trans-retinoic acid, whereas 13-cis-retinoic acid and 4-oxo-13-cis-retinoic acid had approximately 25-fold lower affinity. Holo-CRABP was a substrate for retinoic acid catabolism in rat testes microsomes by three criteria: 1) the rate of retinoic acid metabolism with CRABP in excess of retinoic acid exceeded the rate supported by the free retinoic acid; 2) increasing the apo-CRABP did not decrease the rate as predicted if free retinoic acid were the only substrate; and 3) holo-CRABP had a lower Michaelis constant (1.8 nM) for retinoic acid elimination than did free retinoic acid (49 nM). These data indicate a direct role for CRABP in retinoic acid metabolism and suggest a mechanism for discriminating metabolically between all-trans- and 13-cis-retinoids."
https://openalex.org/W1534154320,"Glioma cells in culture express platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) A- and B-chains and secrete PDGF-like activity that is mainly PDGF-AA. In this work, we show that the PDGF alpha- and beta-receptors are independently expressed in human malignant glioma cells. We also define three different receptor phenotypes that are related to the morphology of glioma cells: cells with only alpha-receptors, only beta-receptors, or with both types of receptors. By the help of Northern blot analyses, 125I-PDGF-binding experiments, and immunoprecipitations the receptors are shown to be structurally normal PDGF receptors, except for minor variations in size that probably are due to differences in glycosylation. PDGF-BB induces DNA synthesis in cells of all three receptor phenotypes, whereas PDGF-AA or PDGF-AB has this effect only on cells with alpha- or with alpha- and beta-receptors. 125I-PDGF-AB binds with high affinity and down-regulates beta-receptors only in cells where alpha-receptors are present in addition to beta-receptors. Thus, the different functional capacities of PDGF isoforms on glioma cells fit with their known receptor-binding specificities and are compatible with the hypothesis that the isoforms act by inducing dimeric receptor complexes. When data on PDGF A- and B-chains, as well as alpha- and beta-receptor expression are compiled and the pattern of receptor binding specificity is taken into account, the majority of glioma cell lines are found to have a phenotype that makes autocrine stimulation possible."

https://openalex.org/W1482095088,"Abstract The mechanisms which control the production of erythropoietin (Epo) remain enigmatic. Recent data suggest that the half-time of Epo messenger RNA (mRNA) is increased by hypoxia in Hep 3B cells, a human hepatoma line. The post-transcriptional regulation of other rapidly degraded mRNAs is mediated by sequence-specific mRNA binding proteins. In order to determine if Epo mRNA specific binding proteins exist, we probed cytosolic lysates from Hep 3B cells and mouse tissues with radiolabeled Epo RNA. A cytosolic protein that binds specifically to Epo RNA was identified in the Epo-producing, hepatoblastoma Hep 3B cell line by gel mobility shift assay. This protein was identified in both normoxic and hypoxic cells and bound specifically to a 120-base fragment of the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of Epo mRNA. Binding was completed with unlabeled Epo RNA, but not with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor RNA. Ultraviolet light cross-linked Epo RNA-protein complexes migrated as two bands of 70 and 135-140 kD on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Binding activity was markedly increased in brain and spleen lysates from mice subjected to 24 h of hypoxia. Therefore, the post-transcriptional regulation of Epo expression in response to hypoxia may in part be due to the interaction of Epo RNA with its specific binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W1666105298,"The dioxin receptor stimulates transcription of the cytochrome P-450IA1 gene in response to dioxin. Exposure of the intracellular dioxin receptor to dioxin leads to a rapid conversion of the receptor from a latent form to a DNA binding species which specifically recognizes dioxin-responsive positive control elements in vitro. In this report, we show that treatment of in vivo or in vitro ligand-activated receptor with potato acid phosphatase significantly reduced or abolished its specific DNA binding activity. This effect was inhibited in the presence of sodium phosphate. In control experiments, the ligand-activated glucocorticoid receptor was not inactivated by phosphatase treatment. Moreover, phosphatase treatment did not induce any detectable degradation of covalently labeled dioxin receptor, arguing against protease contamination as a cause for receptor inactivation. Finally, phosphatase-inactivated dioxin receptor exhibited bona fide levels of ligand binding activity. Taken together, these data suggest that phosphorylation may regulate the DNA binding activity of the ligand-occupied dioxin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1552009840,"We have previously shown that a 50-kDa protein is one component of a heteromeric complex immunoprecipitated by the 90-kDa heat shock protein (hsp90) monoclonal antibodies 8D3 and 3G3 (Perdew, G. H., and Whitelaw, M. L. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 6708-6713). In this report, we compare the 50-kDa protein with that found in pp60v-src-hsp90-p50 complexes immunoprecipitated from Rous sarcoma virus-transformed cells with antibodies to pp60v-src. 35S- and 32P-labeled p50 proteins from each system were identical in their mobilities by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacryl-amide gel electrophoresis. The profile of N-chlorosuccinimide cleavage products derived from each 32P-labeled p50 protein were also identical when resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. We have developed a mouse monoclonal antibody, 3M/1B5p50, capable of detecting p50 on Western blots. This antibody detected the 50-kDa protein which co-purified with the pa104 pp60v-src mutant of the avian sarcoma virus oncoprotein in 44A rat fibroblasts. We did not detect p50 in association with native glucocorticoid receptor in L cells or with the overexpressed glucocorticoid receptor in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Two experiments utilizing immunochemical staining implied that essentially all cytosolic p50 is associated with hsp90. Firstly, immunoprecipitating hsp90 from Hepa 1 cytosol with monoclonal antibody 3G3 left the cytosol depleted of p50. Secondly, cytosol fractionated by sucrose gradient revealed that p50 cosedimented with hsp90, confirming the existence of p50 only in association with hsp90."

Single-strand (ss) but not double-strand (ds) DNA breaks were formed in MCF-7 cells treated with 3,4-EQ. The ss DNA breaks formed in MCF-7 cells were partially repaired after incubation of cells in 3,4-EQ-free media for 2 and 4 h (i.e. 33 and 23% repair, respectively, as compared to the ss DNA breaks in cells after a 1-h exposure to 3,4-EQ without a recovery period). The formation of interstrand DNA cross-links was demonstrated in MCF-7 cells exposed to the bifunctional alkylating agent, mitomycin C, but not in those exposed to 3,4-EQ. Protein-linked DNA breaks were detected in MCF-7 cells after exposure to camptothecin and etoposide but not 3,4-EQ, suggesting that the ss DNA breaks induced by 3,4-EQ are unlikely to be mediated via topoisomerases. The induction of ss DNA breaks was detected in the estrogen receptor-negative cell line, BT-20, after exposure to 3,4-EQ. Furthermore, excess estradiol in culture media did not prevent 3,4-EQ-induced ss DNA breaks, suggesting that the DNA damage was not mediated via the estrogen receptor. Evaluation of the newly synthesized quinone analogue, 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-1-2-naphthoquinone, in the ss DNA breakage assay revealed that the A and B ring moiety of 3,4-EQ is sufficient to produce ss DNA breaks in MCF-7 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1608292591,"A site- and strand-specific nick, introduced in the F plasmid origin of transfer, initiates conjugal DNA transfer during bacterial conjugation. Recently, molecular genetic studies have suggested that DNA helicase I, which is known to be encoded on the F plasmid, may be involved in this nicking reaction (Traxler, B. A., and Minkley, E. G., Jr. (1988) J. Mol. Biol. 204, 205-209). We have demonstrated this site- and strand-specific nicking event using purified helicase I in an in vitro reaction. The nicking reaction requires a superhelical DNA substrate containing the F plasmid origin of transfer, Mg2+ and helicase I. The reaction is protein concentration-dependent but, under the conditions used, only 50-70% of the input DNA substrate is converted to the nicked species. Genetic data (Everett, R., and Willetts, N. (1980) J. Mol. Biol. 136, 129-150) have also suggested the involvement of a second F-encoded protein, the TraY protein, in the oriT nicking reaction. Unexpectedly, the in vitro nicking reaction does not require the product of the F plasmid traY gene. The implications of this result are discussed. The phosphodiester bond interrupted by helicase I has been shown to correspond exactly to the site nicked in vivo suggesting that helicase I is the site- and strand-specific nicking enzyme that initiates conjugal DNA transfer. Thus, helicase I is a bifunctional protein which catalyzes site- and strand-strand specific nicking of the F plasmid in addition to the previously characterized duplex DNA unwinding (helicase) reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1530022924,"Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a phospholipid (1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) with diverse physiological effects. It has been implicated as a mediator of inflammation, allergy, shock, and thrombosis. Plasma contains an enzyme, PAF acetylhydrolase, that catalyzes the degradation of PAF, and the level of this enzyme may regulate the concentration of PAF in the blood and extracellular spaces under some conditions. Thus, the cellular source(s) of this enzyme and the factors that regulate its synthesis and secretion are issues that may have important physiological and pathological implications. We found that cultures of Hep G2, a human hepatocarcinoma line, secreted PAF acetylhydrolase activity. Optimal secretion occurred in medium that contained serum, and the newly secreted PAF acetylhydrolase was associated with high density and low density lipoproteins (LDL and HDL, respectively), just as the enzyme is in plasma. In the absence of serum. PAF acetylhydrolase was secreted with a particle that had a density similar to HDL. Apolipoproteins B and E were found in the same fractions. We tested the effects of a variety of hormones on the secretion of PAF acetylhydrolase and found that secretion was inhibited by 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol with a maximal effect at 30 microM. This may account for the observation of others that estrogens reduce the activity of PAF acetylhydrolase in the plasma. The PAF acetylhydrolase secreted by Hep G2 cells appeared to be identical to the enzyme in human plasma based on substrate specificity, association with LDL and HDL, response to inhibitors, and reactivity with antibodies against the plasma PAF acetylhydrolase. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that hepatocytes in culture secrete a PAF acetylhydrolase that is apparently identical to the plasma form. The secretion is constitutive but may also be regulated in response to hormonal stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W1967708711,"Learning in the marine mollusk Aplysia has been associated with enhanced sensory function, expressed in mechanosensory neurons as (i) decreases in action potential threshold, accommodation, and afterhyperpolarization, and (ii) increases in action potential duration, afterdischarge, and synaptic transmission. These alterations also occur, with a delay, after sensory axons are injured under conditions in which synaptic transmission is severely reduced. The latency and specificity of injury-induced alterations indicate that induction signals are generated at the site of injury and conveyed centrally by axonal transport. Similarities in neuronal modifications support the hypothesis that some memory mechanisms evolved from mechanisms of injury-induced sensory compensation and repair."
https://openalex.org/W1573303387,"Endothelin receptor was purified from bovine lung by a rapid and simple two-step procedure: 1) solubilization with the detergent 3[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate and digitonin and 2) affinity chromatography using biotinylated endothelin and avidin-agarose. Starting from 3.5 kg of bovine lung, about 200 micrograms of pure receptor were obtained. Microsequencing of tryptic fragments of the purified protein revealed a high sequence similarity with the rat endothelin ETB receptor that has very recently been cloned by expression cloning and shown to be nonselective in terms of the ligand specificity. Purification of the receptor in the presence of low (1 mM) and high (50 mM) concentrations of EDTA yielded, as a major form, 34- and 52-kDa species, respectively, indicating that the lower Mr species (34 kDa) is a proteolytic product of the 52-kDa species. Interestingly, this metal proteinase-mediated limited proteolysis did not affect the ligand binding properties of the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1980940284,"THE α1 and α2 domains of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules function in the binding and presentation of foreign peptides to the T-cell antigen receptor and control both negative and positive selection of the T-cell repertoire1–3. Although the α3 domain of class I is not involved in peptide binding, it does interact with the T-cell accessory molecule, CDS (refs 4, 5). CDS is important in the selection of T cells as anti-CDS antibody injected into perinatal mice interfers with this process6. We previously used a hybrid class I molecule with the α1/α2 domains from Ld and the α3 domain from Q7b and showed that this molecule binds an Ld-restricted peptide but does not interact with CD8-dependent cytotoxic T lymphocytes7. Expression of this molecule in transgenic mice fails to negatively select a subpopulation of anti-Ld cytotoxic T lymphocytes. In addition, positive selection of virus-specific Ld-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes does not occur. We conclude that besides the α1/α2 domains of class I, the α3 domain plays an important part in both positive and negative selection of antigen-specific cells."
https://openalex.org/W1627554898,"We have constructed mutants of the alpha subunit of Gs in an attempt to identify sites in the protein that are important for its interaction with adenylylcyclase. Some residues specific for those G proteins that activate adenylylcyclase were replaced with residues characteristic of Gi alpha. Mutant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli, and two of these were purified to homogeneity and characterized in detail. Mutation of trp263, leu268, or arg269 caused a significant loss of the capacity of Gs alpha to stimulate adenylylcyclase, and the triple mutant had less than 1% of the ability of wild type Gs alpha to activate the enzyme. Guanine nucleotide binding and GTP hydrolysis by the mutant proteins were unaltered, as was guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate-induced enhancement of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Mutant proteins also appeared to have a reduced affinity for the G protein beta gamma subunit complex. Secondary structure analysis and comparison with the structure of p21ras suggests that the region of Gs alpha that we have identified is part of a loop that may be involved in interaction of the protein with adenylylcyclase. Although these residues are essential for activation of adenylylcyclase, they are not sufficient to do this when placed in the context of another G protein alpha subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1519616830,"Dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channels from skeletal muscle are multisubunit proteins and are regulated by protein phosphorylation. The purpose of this study was to determine: 1) which subunits are the preferential targets of various protein kinases when the channels are phosphorylated in vitro in their native membrane-bound state and 2) the consequences of these phosphorylations in functional assays. Using as substrates channels present in purified transverse (T) tubule membranes, cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), protein kinase C (PKC), and a multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM protein kinase) preferentially phosphorylated the 165-kDa alpha 1 subunit to an extent that was 2-5-fold greater than the 52-kDa beta subunit. A protein kinase endogenous to the skeletal muscle membranes preferentially phosphorylated the beta peptide and showed little activity toward the alpha 1 subunit; however, the extent of phosphorylation was low. Reconstitution of partially purified channels into liposomes was used to determine the functional consequences of phosphorylation by these kinases. Phosphorylation of channels by PKA or PKC resulted in an activation of the channels that was observed as increases in both the rate and extent of Ca2+ influx. However, phosphorylation of channels by either the CaM protein kinase or the endogenous kinase in T-tubule membranes was without effect. Phosphorylation did not affect the sensitivities of the channels toward the dihydropyridines. Taken together, the results demonstrate that the alpha 1 subunit is the preferred substrate of PKA, PKC, and CaM protein kinase when the channels are phosphorylated in the membrane-bound state and that phosphorylation of the channels by PKA and PKC, but not by CaM protein kinase or an endogenous T-tubule membrane protein kinase, results in activation of the dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channels from skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1484360204,"Hepatic inositol (1,3,4,5)-tetrakisphosphate 3-phosphatase activity was detected in a 100,000 x g soluble fraction and a detergent-solubilized particulate fraction. Activity in both fractions increased up to 40-fold after anion-exchange chromatography due to removal of endogenous inhibitors (Hodgson, M.E., and Shears, S.B. (1990) Biochem. J. 267, 831-834); at this stage the detergent-solubilized particulate activity comprised over 90% of total activity. The particulate phosphatase was further purified by affinity chromatography using heparin-agarose and red-agarose. The latter column resolved two peaks of enzyme activity (designated 1 and 2 by their order of elution from the column). Their proportions varied between experiments, but peak 2 generally predominated and so this was further purified by hydroxylapatite chromatography. The final preparation was typically 38,000-fold purified with a 7% yield. The apparent molecular mass of this enzyme was 66 kDa, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel filtration. The enzyme had little or no affinity for the following: inositol (1,3,4,6)-tetrakisphosphate, inositol (1,3,4)-trisphosphate, inositol (1,3)-bisphosphate, inositol (3,4)-bisphosphate, and para-nitrophenylphosphate. At pH 7.4 the Km for inositol (1,3,4,5)-tetrakisphosphate was 130 nM and the Vmax was 4250 nmol/mg protein/min. The purified enzyme also dephosphorylated inositol (1,3,4,5,6)-pentakisphosphate to inositol (1,4,5,6)-tetrakisphosphate (Km = 40 nM, Vmax = 211 nmol/mg protein/min), and inositol hexakisphosphate to at least five isomers of inositol pentakisphosphate (Km = 0.3 nM, Vmax = 12 nmol/mg protein/min). The latter affinity is the highest yet defined for an enzyme involved in inositol phosphate metabolism. Determinations of IC50 values, and Dixon plots, revealed that with the (1,3,4,5)-tetrakisphosphate as substrate, the pentakis- and hexakisphosphates were potent competitive inhibitors; the Ki values (25 and 0.5 nM, respectively) were similar to their substrate Km values. The kinetic properties of this enzyme, as well as estimates of the cellular levels of its potential substrates, indicate that inositol pentakisphosphate and inositol hexakisphosphate are likely to be the preferred substrates in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1542145035,Growth factor regulation of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) metabolism during the G1 stage of the cell cycle was investigated in the colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1)-dependent murine macrophage cell-line BAC1.2F5. The transient removal of CSF-1 arrested the cells in G1. Incorporation of [3H]choline into PtdCho was stimulated significantly 1 h after growth factor addition to quiescent cells. Metabolic labeling experiments pointed to CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT) as the rate-controlling enzyme for PtdCho biosynthesis in BAC1.2F5 cells. The amount of CT mRNA increased 4-fold within 15 min of CSF-1 addition and remained elevated for 2 h. The rise in CT mRNA levels was accompanied by a 50% increase in total CT specific activity in cell extracts within 4 h after the addition of CSF-1. CSF-1-dependent elevation of CT mRNA content was neither attenuated nor superinduced by the inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide. The rate of CT mRNA turnover decreased in the presence of CSF-1 indicating that message stabilization was a key factor in determining the levels of CT mRNA. These data point to increased CT mRNA abundance as a component in growth factor-stimulated PtdCho synthesis.
https://openalex.org/W1563570838,"The functional significance of the oxidation/reduction state of sulfhydryl groups of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGMP kinase) was studied at 30 degrees C using different metal ions as oxidizing agents. Mn2+, Zn2+, Fe2+, Ni2+, and Co2+ failed to activate cGMP kinase, whereas Cu2+, Cu+, Fe3+, Hg2+, and Ag+ activated cGMP kinase by oxidation with an activity ratio (-cGMP/+cGMP) of about 0.7. The activation was not caused by degradation of the enzyme to a cGMP-independent constitutively active form. Reduction of the Cu(2+)-activated and gel-filtered enzyme with dithiothreitol lowered the activity ratio in the absence of cGMP to 0.17. Oxidation did not change the kinetic and binding parameters of cGMP kinase significantly but reduced the number of titratable sulfhydryl groups from 9.5 +/- 0.7 to 6.0 +/- 0.4 cysteines/75-kDa subunit. The free cysteinyl residues of the native and Cu(2+)-oxidized cGMP kinase were labeled with 4-dimethylaminoazobenzene-4'-iodoacetamide or N-(7-dimethylamino-4-methyl-3-coumarinyl)maleimide. Tryptic peptides of the labeled proteins were isolated and sequenced. The cysteinyl residues oxidized by Cu2+ were identified as disulfide bonds between Cys-117 and Cys-195 and Cys-312 and Cys-518, respectively. Cu2+ activation of cGMP kinase was prevented by mild carboxymethylation of the reduced enzyme with iodoacetamide, which apparently modified these four cysteinyl groups. The results show that cGMP kinase is activated by the formation of at least one intrachain disulfide bridge."
https://openalex.org/W1482508730,"The involvement of platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa complex in calcium channel activity on the plasma membrane was investigated using an electrophysiological approach. Plasma membrane vesicles were prepared from thrombin-stimulated platelets and incorporated into planar lipid bilayers. Voltage-independent Ca2+ channel currents with a conductance of about 10 pS (in 53 mM Ba2+) were observed, in membranes derived from thrombin-stimulated, but not unstimulated platelet membranes. These channel activities were markedly reduced by exposure of membranes to EGTA at 37 degrees C. This reduction was specifically related to the dissociation of the GPIIb-IIIa complex since preincubation of the membranes with a monoclonal antibody to the GPIIb-IIIa complex (AP-2) could protect the channel activities from the effect of EGTA. Thrombasthenic platelets, which lack the GPIIb-IIIa complex, showed impaired channel activities characterized by decreased open probability and lowered conductance states. Furthermore, when platelets were stimulated by thrombin in the presence of EGTA, AP2, or the synthetic peptide RGDS, to prevent fibrinogen binding to the GPIIb-IIIa complex, open probabilities of the channel currents in these membrane vesicles were also decreased. These results suggest that the GPIIb-IIIa complex is involved in platelet Ca2+ channel activation and that ligand binding to the complex during platelet activation may modify the activation of Ca2+ channels."
https://openalex.org/W1586527248,"Wild-type and mutants with alpha-subunits truncated at the N terminus of Na+/K+ pumps of Torpedo electroplax were expressed in Xenopus oocytes by injection of cRNAs encoding for one of the alpha-subunits and for the beta-subunit. Currents generated by the pump were investigated under voltage clamp in Na(+)-free solution, a condition where stimulation by external [K+] is the only voltage-dependent and rate-determining step in the pump cycle (Rakowski, R. F., Vasilets, L. A., LaTona, J., and Schwarz, W. (1991) J. Membr. Biol. 121, 177-187). Voltage dependence of the apparent Km value for pump stimulation and of maximum transport activity was investigated. Truncation of the intracellular N-terminal end of the alpha-subunit at the trypsin-accessible site (alpha delta K37, leaving Lys37) leads to nearly complete inhibition of pump current at physiological potentials, whereas ouabain binding capacity is retained indicating an essential involvement of the N-terminal end in the process of ion translocation. Truncation at the N-terminal end leaving Lys28 (alpha delta K28) or Thr29 (alpha delta T29) leads to removal of 6 or 7 lysine residues, respectively, and has no effect on maximum transport activity. On the other hand, the mutated pumps with alpha delta K28 or alpha delta T29 exhibit more pronounced voltage dependences for stimulation of pump current by external [K+] compared with the wild-type Torpedo pump. In particular, a pronounced increase in voltage dependence of the apparent affinity of pump stimulation is obtained by the removal of the Lys28. The results support the view that the lysine-rich region in the N-terminal end affects the cation binding to the pump molecule and that Lys28 is important."
https://openalex.org/W2010709173,"A noninvasive method for monitoring communications on DNA was developed from the specificity of resolvase for the arrangement of its recombinational sites. Constraints in DNA structure, caused by interactions between distant sites, can be detected by resolvase as they arise. The method was used to follow the formation and decay of synaptic intermediates during site-specific recombination by resolvase. Synaptic complexes were formed very rapidly, at a rate limited by the initial association of the protein with DNA rather than the physical motion of DNA segments. The recombinational sites seem to encounter each other by an ordered motion, perhaps dictated by DNA supercoiling instead of random collisions, so that the first encounter produces the active complex."
https://openalex.org/W1580418149,"Renin gene expression in the mouse kidney and submandibular gland (SMG) are differentially regulated by cAMP. In this study, we examined the potential molecular mechanism responsible for this tissue-specific regulation. 32P end-labeled synthetic oligonucleotide containing mouse renin cAMP-responsive element (CRE) was incubated with kidney nuclear extracts from either control or cAMP-treated mice and analyzed by gel mobility shift assay. Our results demonstrated that cAMP induced a nuclear protein which complexed with the CRE oligonucleotide in a specific manner. This nuclear protein-DNA binding was competed effectively by the oligonucleotide containing human chorionic gonadotropin alpha-subunit CRE but not by the mouse renin DNA fragment from which the CRE was deleted by site-directed mutagenesis. In contrast, no DNA-protein complex formation could be detected when this [32P]CRE oligonucleotide was incubated with the SMG nuclear extract from control or cAMP-treated mice. However, CRE-binding protein complex formation was demonstrated in the SMG nuclear extract when the incubation was performed in the presence of 0.8% sodium deoxycholate and 1.2% Nonidet P-40, detergents that dissociate protein-protein complexes. Furthermore, in the absence of deoxycholate, we observed that SMG nuclear extract attenuated the binding of the kidney CRE-binding protein to mouse renin CRE in a dose-dependent manner and this inhibitory effect of SMG nuclear extract disappeared in the presence of sodium deoxycholate. This inhibitory nuclear protein in SMG is specific for CRE-binding protein since it does not affect nuclear protein binding to synthetic DNA oligonucleotides of human collagenase AP-1 and human metallothionein AP-2. Our data further suggest that inhibitory nuclear protein is present in lower quantities in other extrarenal tissues, i.e. testes, liver, brain, heart, but is not detectable in the kidney. Taken together, these results suggest that the SMG and certain extrarenal tissues contain nuclear trans-acting factor(s) that interact with CRE-binding protein, thereby interfering with its binding to mouse renin CRE. The presence of this inhibitory protein in the mouse SMG nucleus may contribute to the tissue-specific regulation of the renin gene expression by cAMP."
https://openalex.org/W1514215032,"A full-length cDNA corresponding to the Dictyostelium myosin light chain kinase gene has been isolated and characterized. Sequence analysis of the cDNA confirms conserved protein kinase subdomains and reveals that the Dictyostelium sequence is highly homologous to those of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, including myosin light chain kinases from higher eukaryotes. Despite the high homologies to calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, there is no recognizable calmodulin-binding domain within the Dictyostelium sequence. However, the Dictyostelium myosin light chain kinase possesses a putative auto-inhibitory domain near its carboxyl terminus. To further characterize this domain, the full-length enzyme as well as a truncated form lacking this domain were expressed in bacterial cells and purified. The full-length enzyme expressed in bacteria exhibits essentially the same biochemical characteristics as the enzyme isolated from Dictyostelium. The truncated form however exhibits a Vmax that is approximately ten times greater than that of the native enzyme. In addition, unlike the native kinase and the full-length kinase expressed in bacteria, the truncated enzyme does not undergo autophosphorylation. These results suggest that the Dictyostelium enzyme, like myosin light chain kinases from higher eukaryotes, is regulated by an autoinhibitory domain but that the specific molecular signals necessary for activation of the Dictyostelium enzyme are entirely distinct."
https://openalex.org/W1599821923,"Previous work (Gandino, L., Di Renzo, M. F., Giordano, S., Bussolino, F., and Comoglio, P.M. (1990) Oncogene 5, 721-725) has shown that the tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor encoded by the MET protooncogene is negatively modulated by protein kinase C (PKC). We now show that an increase of intracellular Ca2+ has a similar inhibitory effect in vivo, via a PKC-independent mechanism. In GTL-16 cells the p145MET kinase is overexpressed and constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine. A rapid and reversible decrease of p145MET tyrosine phosphorylation was induced by treatment with the calcium ionophores A23187 or ionomycin. Experiments performed with the ionophores in absence of extracellular calcium showed that a rise in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration to 450 nM (due to release from intracellular stores) resulted in a similar effect. These Ca2+ concentrations had no effect on p145MET autophosphorylation in an in vitro kinase assay. This suggests that the effect of Ca2+ on p145MET tyrosine phosphorylation is not direct but may be mediated by Ca(2+)-activated proteins(s). Involvement of Ca(2+)-dependent tyrosine phosphatases was ruled out by experiments carried out in presence of Na2VO4. In vivo labeling with [32P]orthophosphate showed that the rise of intracellular Ca2+ induces serine phosphorylation of p145MET on a specific phosphopeptide. This suggests that Ca2+ negatively modulates p145MET kinase through the phosphorylation of a critical serine residue by a Ca(2+)-activated serine kinase distinct from PKC."
https://openalex.org/W1503444337,"Arachidonate activation of the NADPH-oxidase in intact neutrophils and in a cell-free O2- generation system was compared to synergistic activation in response to arachidonate and agents that effect protein phosphorylation. In intact neutrophils, suboptimal doses of retinal which increase protein phosphorylation, or 4B-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) an activator of protein kinase C, induced minimal O2- release, but primed neutrophils to release enhanced amounts of O2- in response to 2.5 microM arachidonate. In contrast to retinal or PMA, okadaic acid, a specific inhibitor of serine/threonine protein phosphatases, did not induce any release of O2-, but significantly increased the maximal rate and duration of O2- release in response to arachidonate. In the cell-free system, only arachidonate induced O2- generation. Consistent with previous findings, activation of the cell-free system was dependent of the presence of light membranes, cytosol, NADPH, Mg2+, and 82 microM arachidonate. Pretreatment of neutrophils with suboptimal doses of PMA or retinal had little effect on the arachidonate-stimulated release of O2- in cell-free preparations of these cells. However, cytosol (but not light membranes) from PMA or retinal-primed neutrophils was more effective in completing resting membrane NADPH-oxidase activity when compared to cytosol from resting cells. The addition of protein kinase C inhibitors staurosporine and 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine decreased the effectiveness of PMA-primed cytosol to complete the cell-free system, but had little effect on cytosol obtained from cells primed with retinal. The addition of protein phosphatase inhibitors, p-nitrophenyl phosphate or okadaic acid to neutrophil cavitates increased 3-fold the release of O2- in cell-free preparations of these cells. Okadaic acid and p-nitrophenyl phosphate also increased the effectiveness of both cytosol and light membranes to complete the cell-free system when combined with cytosol or light membranes from resting neutrophils, respectively, indicating that both fractions are affected by the inhibition of protein phosphatase activity. These data indicate that increases in protein phosphorylation alone do not lead to the activation of the NADPH-oxidase, but in addition to the requirement of an anionic amphiphile, the release of O2- from intact neutrophils or in the cell-free system is increased by stimulus activation of protein kinase C or more impressively by inhibition of protein phosphatase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1545480741,"Pyrophosphate-dependent 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PPi-PFK) from Propionibacterium freudenreichii is a non-allosteric enzyme with properties dissimilar to those of other described phosphofructokinases. The enzyme was cloned into pBluescript, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli at levels 15 times higher than those observed in Propionibacterium. The gene consists of 1215 bases which code for a protein of 404 amino acids and a mass of 43,243 daltons. High G + C in the codon usage (66%) of the gene is consistent with the classification of Propionibacterium in the High-G + C subdivision of the Gram-positive bacteria. While showing no sequence identity to the non-allosteric ATP-dependent phosphofructokinase of E. coli, alignments of the amino acid sequence with other PFKs reveal degrees of identities among the amino halves of the proteins, from 26% between the Propionibacterium and potato PPi-PFKs, and 29% between Propionibacterium and E. coli ATP-PFKs. These levels of identities indicate that the amino halves of these proteins are homologous. Identities between the carboxyl half of Propionibacterium PFK and carboxyl halves of other sequences are below 20%, suggesting that the carboxyl half is not homologous. Despite the poor conservation, most of the residues that take part in the binding of fructose-6-P or Mg-PPi could be readily identified by analogy to the structure of the E. coli PFK. Both the fructose-6-P and ATP-binding sites are conserved, indicating that PPi binds to the homologous site of the E. coli ATP-binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1530132125,"We have developed a more efficient in vitro replication system for the plasmid R6K with the objective of dissecting the mechanism of activation of replication origins at a distance. Using this in vitro system we have shown that the activation of replication origin gamma of R6K is absolutely dependent on two exogenously added initiator proteins: namely the host-encoded DnaA and the plasmid-encoded Pi proteins. Replication was inhibited by novobiocin, suggesting a requirement for DNA gyrase. Surprisingly, rifampicin stimulated in vitro replication significantly, and this stimulation was manifested in the quantitative enhancement of replication without any noticeable qualitative change in the reaction products. This result suggests that transcription at or near the gamma origin keeps it repressed. Replication intermediates that were allowed to accumulate by dideoxynucleoside triphosphate incorporation were analyzed both by restriction enzyme digestion and by electron microscopy, and both sets of analyses revealed initiation from the gamma origin resulting in theta-type replication intermediates. Further development of this system should help us to understand how DNA-protein interaction at the gamma origin/enhancer activates the distal origins alpha and beta."
https://openalex.org/W1768320209,"SV40 chromosomes prepared from infected CV-1 cells were replicated with the purified proteins of SV40 T antigen, HeLa DNA polymerase alpha-primase complex, single-stranded DNA-binding protein, and topoisomerases I and II, all of which have been shown to be essential for SV40 DNA replication in vitro. Replication started near the origin and proceeded bidirectionally. The maximum speed of replication fork movement was 200-300 nucleotides/min, which was similar to the rate of SV40 DNA replication with the same set of proteins. When replication products were digested with micrococcal nuclease, DNA fragments of 160-180 base pairs, which is the typical size of mononucleosomal DNA, were protected. This result indicates that replicated DNA was reconstructed into the nucleosome structure, complexed with parental histones."
https://openalex.org/W1513801804,"The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is phosphorylated to a high stoichiometry on tyrosine residues both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, tyrosine phosphorylation has been shown to regulate the functional properties of the receptor. We report here the purification and characterization of a protein tyrosine phosphatase that dephosphorylates tyrosine-phosphorylated nAChR from Torpedo electroplax, a tissue highly enriched in the nAChR. The 32P-labeled tyrosine phosphorylated nAChR was used as a substrate to monitor the enzyme activity during purification. The protein tyrosine phosphatase activity was purified using three consecutive cation-exchange columns (phosphocellulose, S Sepharose Fast Flow, Bio-Rex 70), followed by two affinity matrices (p-aminobenzylphosphonic acid-agarose and thiophosphotyrosyl nAChR-Sepharose 4B). The enzyme activity was purified to homogeneity, with an overall purification of 25,000-fold and a yield of 20%. The purified enzyme had an apparent molecular mass of 43 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and migrated as a monomer during Superose 12 chromatography. It had a neutral pH optimum and a specific activity of 18 mumol/mg of protein/min, with a Km of 4.7 microM for tyrosine-phosphorylated nAChR. The phosphatase was specific for tyrosine phosphorylated nAChR; it showed no activity towards the nAChR phosphorylated on serine residues by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The enzyme also dephosphorylated 32P-labeled poly(Glu-Tyr) (4:1). However, it did not dephosphorylate p-nitrophenylphosphate. The tyrosine phosphatase was inhibited by ammonium molybdate (IC50 of 2 microM), sodium vanadate (IC50 of 150 microM) and the divalent cations Mg2+, Mn2+, and Ca2+ at millimolar concentrations, but not by 100 microM ZnCl or 10 mM NaF. Poly-(Glu, Tyr) (4:1) and heparin inhibited the enzyme activity at micromolar concentrations. These unique properties of the purified enzyme suggest that it may be a novel protein tyrosine phosphatase that specifically dephosphorylates the nAChR."
https://openalex.org/W1500041303,"The cDNAs encoding the alpha and beta subunits of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) were ligated into the bacterial expression vector pET and expressed in Escherichia coli. The bacterially expressed alpha and beta subunits exhibited Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent activity and were easily purified to apparent homogeneity from cell extracts. To determine the minimum size required for catalytic activity and the properties of the calmodulin-binding domain, mutated CaM kinase II cDNAs were expressed in E. coli and the enzymatic property of expressed proteins was examined. The replacement of Thr-286 of the alpha subunit with the negatively charged amino acid Asp or that of Arg-283 with the neutral amino acid Gly induced the partially Ca2+ independent activity. The mutant enzymes alpha-I(delta 283-478) and alpha-II(delta 359-478), which truncated the C-terminal region of the alpha subunit, exhibited CaM kinase II activity and the activities of alpha-I(delta 283-478) and alpha-II(delta 359-478) were completely independent of and partially dependent on Ca2+ and calmodulin, respectively. However, the truncated protein alpha(delta 250-478), which was only 33 amino acids shorter than the alpha-I(delta 283-478) protein had no enzymatic activity, indicating that alpha-I(delta 283-478) was close to the minimum size of the active form. The mutant enzyme alpha(delta 291-315), which lacked the calmodulin-binding domain exhibited Ca2+ independent activity. The molecular mass was, however, smaller than that expected from the amino acid sequence. The mutant enzyme alpha(delta 304-315), which lacked the C-terminal half of the calmodulin-binding domain of the alpha subunit, however, exhibited Ca(2+)-independent activity without a reduction in molecular size, indicating that residues 304-315 of the alpha subunit constituted the core calmodulin-binding domain."
https://openalex.org/W1497651795,"Phagocyte superoxide (O2-) response is primed by a variety of physiologic compounds including the neutrophil secretory proteases cathepsin G and elastase. To study whether protease priming of neutrophil O2- response is related to changes in membrane physical state, we examined enzyme effects on the order and lateral mobility of lipid probes in intact neutrophil membranes. Exposure to cathepsin G (5 micrograms/ml) or elastase (10 micrograms/ml) caused a significant decrease in fluorescence anisotropy of the probe trimethylammonium diphenylhexatriene in neutrophil plasma membranes (0.279 to 0.256 for cathepsin G, 0.274 to 0.256 for elastase, p less than 0.02 for both), indicating a decrease in phospholipid chain order in the surface membrane bilayer. Cathepsin G and elastase also caused significant increases in membrane lipid lateral mobility as measured by excimer formation of the fluorescent probe 1-pyrenedecanoic acid (for cathepsin G, a 107% increase, and for elastase, a 44% increase in excimer/monomer fluorescence ratio, p less than 0.001). Enzyme effects on membrane structure were dependent on intact proteolytic activity, and were cell specific; the proteases had no effect on lipid order or lateral mobility in liposomes. In corollary studies, the possible association between the physical state of the polymorphonuclear leukocyte membrane and O2- generation was analyzed with the membrane modifying compounds, linoleic acid, ethanol, and cholesterol. Cell exposure to linoleic acid (1 microM) caused a significant decrease in lipid order and an increase in lipid lateral mobility along with increased O2- production to N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) (191%) and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) (39%), p less than 0.02 for each. 3 mM ethanol also augmented O2- response to fMLP (31%) and PMA (48%) and caused a significant decrease in lipid order, but did not affect lipid lateral mobility. Treatment with cholesteryl hemisuccinate (100 micrograms/ml) resulted in increased lipid order and decreased lipid lateral mobility, as well as decreased neutrophil superoxide response to fMLP (-61%, p less than 0.001) and PMA (-50%, p less than 0.02). We then examined whether modulation of membrane physical state may explain the mechanism of action of a known priming agent by studying the effects of low concentrations of a diacylglycerol. Cells treated with 10 microM 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol had a greater than 8-fold increase in superoxide response to fMLP (p less than 0.001) while demonstrating a significant decrease in lipid order (0.289 to 0.281, p less than 0.01) and a 50% increase in lipid lateral mobility (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Using deletional analysis and site-directed mutagenesis of T kininogen-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase fusion constructs transfected into HepG2 hepatoma cells, we have identified two similar interleukin-6 response elements within 250 base pairs of the transcription start site. These two response elements are functionally interdependent. The sequences of these two elements match the consensus sequence for the previously described Type B interleukin-6 response element. Interleukin-6 signal transduction via two Type B elements has not been observed previously in vivo. A DNA fragment encompassing these response elements forms the same protein complex with nuclear extracts from both untreated and interleukin-6-treated cells."
https://openalex.org/W1511897506,"Retinal rod outer segment phosphodiesterase (PDE) consists of two similar catalytic subunits (alpha and beta) and two identical inhibitory subunits (gamma 2). A trypsin-activated soluble PDE exhibiting the ability to be reinhibited by PDE gamma was shown by peptide antisera to retain both N and C termini. Synthetic peptides corresponding to residues 16-30, 78-90, 389-403, and 535-563 of PDE alpha used in a PDE activity assay with trypsin-activated PDE partially prevented inhibition by exogenous PDE gamma; however, only competitions by peptides 16-30 and 78-90 (corresponding to PDE alpha 16-30 and 78-90) were concentration-dependent below 100 nmol of peptide. Binding studies using radio-immunoassays and PDE alpha peptides confirmed that peptides 16-30 and 78-90 (corresponding to PDE alpha 16-30 and 78-90, respectively) were able to bind PDE gamma. Additionally, peptides corresponding to the PDE alpha region 453-534 bound PDE gamma in the binding assay. This suggests that several regions on PDE alpha interact with the PDE gamma inhibitor. While some regions may be involved in binding to PDE gamma, other sites may be involved in PDE gamma inhibition of catalytic activity. Our results suggest that the major regions of PDE alpha that interact with PDE gamma reside within the N terminus (16-30 and 78-90), with weaker interaction regions within or near the hypothesized catalytic domain (453-563). Sequence analysis of three retinal phosphodiesterases (rod outer segment alpha, beta, and cone outer segment alpha') revealed the highest region of dissimilarity in the N and C termini."
https://openalex.org/W1510292819,"The inactivation of sulfite oxidase, a molybdoenzyme containing the Mo cofactor, by arsenite and periodate was investigated. In contrast to ferricyanide (Gardlik, S., and Rajagopalan, K.V. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 4889-4895), neither of these reagents causes oxidation of the pterin ring of the Mo cofactor. Instead, inactivation by these reagents appears to involve attack on sulfhydryl groups at the active site of the enzyme. The inactivation of sulfite oxidase by arsenite was shown to be dependent on the presence of O2 and on the enzymatic oxidation of arsenite to arsenate. The inactivation was preventable by the presence of sulfite, or by the use of cytochrome c as the electron acceptor instead of O2. It is concluded that inactivation by arsenite is the result of arsenite displacement of Mo during enzymatic oxidation of arsenite to arsenate, when Mo transiently breaks its bond to protein or molybdopterin sulfhydryl(s) in order to provide a site for transfer of electrons to O2. Data indicate that arsenite is properly oriented to displace Mo only once every 20,800 turnovers, thus accounting for the slow rate of inactivation by this reagent. Inactivation of sulfite oxidase by periodate is believed to occur as the result of direct attack of periodate on the thiolate ligands of Mo, either those of the protein and/or molybdopterin, leading to Mo loss. Treatment of enzyme with even low levels of periodate resulted in loss of Mo and both sulfite:cytochrome c and sulfite:O2 activities. Molybdopterin of periodate-inactivated enzyme retained the ability to reconstitute nitrate reductase apoprotein in nit-1 extracts and the ability to reduce dichlorophenolindophenol, indicating that the pterin ring had not been oxidized."
https://openalex.org/W1518078621,"The assembly of the iron-sulfur protein into the cytochrome bc1 complex after import and processing of the precursor form into mitochondria in vitro was investigated by immunoprecipitation of the radiolabeled iron-sulfur protein from detergent-solubilized mitochondria with specific antisera. After import in vitro, the labeled mature form of the iron-sulfur protein was immunoprecipitated by antisera against both the iron-sulfur protein and the entire bc1 complex from mitochondria solubilized with either Triton X-100 or dodecyl maltoside. After sodium dodecyl sulfate solubilization of mitochondria, however, the antiserum against the iron-sulfur protein, but not that against the bc1 complex, immunoprecipitated the radiolabeled iron-sulfur protein. These results suggest that in mitochondria the mature form of the iron-sulfur protein is assembled with other subunits of the bc1 complex that are recognized by the antiserum against the bc1 complex. By contrast, the intermediate and precursor forms of the iron-sulfur protein that accumulated in the matrix when proteolytic processing was blocked with EDTA and o-phenanthroline were not efficiently assembled into the bc1 complex. The import and processing of the iron-sulfur protein also occurred in mitochondria lacking either cytochrome b (W-267) or the iron-sulfur protein (JPJ1). The mature form of the iron-sulfur protein was immunoprecipitated by antisera against the bc1 complex or core protein I after import in vitro into these mitochondria, suggesting that the mature form is associated with other subunits of the bc1 complex in these strains."
