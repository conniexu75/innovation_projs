https://openalex.org/W2256016639,"Large-scale reference data sets of human genetic variation are critical for the medical and functional interpretation of DNA sequence changes. Here we describe the aggregation and analysis of high-quality exome (protein-coding region) DNA sequence data for 60,706 individuals of diverse ancestries generated as part of the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC). This catalogue of human genetic diversity contains an average of one variant every eight bases of the exome, and provides direct evidence for the presence of widespread mutational recurrence. We have used this catalogue to calculate objective metrics of pathogenicity for sequence variants, and to identify genes subject to strong selection against various classes of mutation; identifying 3,230 genes with near-complete depletion of predicted protein-truncating variants, with 72% of these genes having no currently established human disease phenotype. Finally, we demonstrate that these data can be used for the efficient filtering of candidate disease-causing variants, and for the discovery of human 'knockout' variants in protein-coding genes."
https://openalex.org/W2514983714,"Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on Earth, but challenges in detecting, isolating, and classifying unknown viruses have prevented exhaustive surveys of the global virome. Here we analysed over 5 Tb of metagenomic sequence data from 3,042 geographically diverse samples to assess the global distribution, phylogenetic diversity, and host specificity of viruses. We discovered over 125,000 partial DNA viral genomes, including the largest phage yet identified, and increased the number of known viral genes by 16-fold. Half of the predicted partial viral genomes were clustered into genetically distinct groups, most of which included genes unrelated to those in known viruses. Using CRISPR spacers and transfer RNA matches to link viral groups to microbial host(s), we doubled the number of microbial phyla known to be infected by viruses, and identified viruses that can infect organisms from different phyla. Analysis of viral distribution across diverse ecosystems revealed strong habitat-type specificity for the vast majority of viruses, but also identified some cosmopolitan groups. Our results highlight an extensive global viral diversity and provide detailed insight into viral habitat distribution and host–virus interactions. An integrated computational approach that explores the viral content of more than 3,000 metagenomic samples collected globally highlights the existing global viral diversity, increases the known number of viral genes by an order of magnitude, and provides detailed insights into viral distribution across diverse ecosystems and into virus–host interactions. Viruses influence virtually all of the biogeochemical processes occurring on our planet, but they remain enigmatic because it has proved difficult to detect, isolate and classify them in large-scale studies. However, in recent years a vast amount of metagenomic data have been collected, and now Nikos Kyrpides and colleagues have developed a computational approach to extract more detail from that dataset and create the first global map of viral biogeography. They explore the viral content of more than 3,000 metagenomic samples collected globally, identify 125,000 partial DNA viral genomes — including the largest known phage — and increase the number of known viral genes 16-fold."
https://openalex.org/W2512819857,"Morphine is an alkaloid from the opium poppy used to treat pain. The potentially lethal side effects of morphine and related opioids—which include fatal respiratory depression—are thought to be mediated by μ-opioid-receptor (μOR) signalling through the β-arrestin pathway or by actions at other receptors. Conversely, G-protein μOR signalling is thought to confer analgesia. Here we computationally dock over 3 million molecules against the μOR structure and identify new scaffolds unrelated to known opioids. Structure-based optimization yields PZM21—a potent Gi activator with exceptional selectivity for μOR and minimal β-arrestin-2 recruitment. Unlike morphine, PZM21 is more efficacious for the affective component of analgesia versus the reflexive component and is devoid of both respiratory depression and morphine-like reinforcing activity in mice at equi-analgesic doses. PZM21 thus serves as both a probe to disentangle μOR signalling and a therapeutic lead that is devoid of many of the side effects of current opioids. Computational docking to the the μ-opioid-receptor identifies PZM21, a novel selective biased agonist that generates substantial affective analgesia in mice without altering respiration or inducing drug reinforcement. Morphine and other alkaloids from the opium poppy are μ-opioid receptor agonists that have been used to treat pain for many centuries. These authors used a computational approach to dock over three million small molecules to the μ-opioid receptor. Structure-based optimization of the most promising structures led to the identification of a potent agonist, PZM21, with exceptional subtype selectivity for the μ-opioid receptor. In mice, PZM21 generates substantial analgesia, which is fully ablated in μ-opioid receptor knockout animals. This small molecule seems to reduce the affective component of pain, without detectably altering reflexive behaviours, and has little effect on respiration."
https://openalex.org/W2510136745,"Both a high number of species and abundance in multiple trophic levels are required for ecosystems to continue to provide the services humans require of them. Numerous experiments have shown that the loss of biodiversity within single trophic groups — groups of organisms consuming resources from a similar level in the food chain — reduces the ability of ecosystems to deliver the services on which humans depend. How the loss of biodiversity in natural ecosystems consisting of multiple interacting trophic groups affects ecosystem functioning has remained unclear. Santiago Soliveres et al. have compiled data on the richness and abundance of 4,600 microbial, plant and animal taxa in 150 grasslands in Germany, together with information on 14 ecosystem services. Their analysis of the data demonstrates that biodiversity across multiple trophic groups is as important for the functioning of ecosystems as land-use intensity or environmental conditions. They conclude that the preservation of high levels of richness and diversity within a wide range of taxa will be key to ensuring that ecosystems continue to deliver the services on which humans rely. The findings also inform conservation and ecosystem management strategies by highlighting the most functionally relevant organisms, which include plants, soil bacteria and herbivorous insects. Many experiments have shown that loss of biodiversity reduces the capacity of ecosystems to provide the multiple services on which humans depend1,2. However, experiments necessarily simplify the complexity of natural ecosystems and will normally control for other important drivers of ecosystem functioning, such as the environment or land use. In addition, existing studies typically focus on the diversity of single trophic groups, neglecting the fact that biodiversity loss occurs across many taxa3,4 and that the functional effects of any trophic group may depend on the abundance and diversity of others5,6. Here we report analysis of the relationships between the species richness and abundance of nine trophic groups, including 4,600 above- and below-ground taxa, and 14 ecosystem services and functions and with their simultaneous provision (or multifunctionality) in 150 grasslands. We show that high species richness in multiple trophic groups (multitrophic richness) had stronger positive effects on ecosystem services than richness in any individual trophic group; this includes plant species richness, the most widely used measure of biodiversity. On average, three trophic groups influenced each ecosystem service, with each trophic group influencing at least one service. Multitrophic richness was particularly beneficial for ‘regulating’ and ‘cultural’ services, and for multifunctionality, whereas a change in the total abundance of species or biomass in multiple trophic groups (the multitrophic abundance) positively affected supporting services. Multitrophic richness and abundance drove ecosystem functioning as strongly as abiotic conditions and land-use intensity, extending previous experimental results7,8 to real-world ecosystems. Primary producers, herbivorous insects and microbial decomposers seem to be particularly important drivers of ecosystem functioning, as shown by the strong and frequent positive associations of their richness or abundance with multiple ecosystem services. Our results show that multitrophic richness and abundance support ecosystem functioning, and demonstrate that a focus on single groups has led to researchers to greatly underestimate the functional importance of biodiversity."
https://openalex.org/W2517374546,"Hypermethylation of the promoters of tumour suppressor genes represses transcription of these genes, conferring growth advantages to cancer cells. How these changes arise is poorly understood. Here we show that the activity of oxygen-dependent ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes is reduced by tumour hypoxia in human and mouse cells. TET enzymes catalyse DNA demethylation through 5-methylcytosine oxidation. This reduction in activity occurs independently of hypoxia-associated alterations in TET expression, proliferation, metabolism, hypoxia-inducible factor activity or reactive oxygen species, and depends directly on oxygen shortage. Hypoxia-induced loss of TET activity increases hypermethylation at gene promoters in vitro. In patients, tumour suppressor gene promoters are markedly more methylated in hypoxic tumour tissue, independent of proliferation, stromal cell infiltration and tumour characteristics. Our data suggest that up to half of hypermethylation events are due to hypoxia, with these events conferring a selective advantage. Accordingly, increased hypoxia in mouse breast tumours increases hypermethylation, while restoration of tumour oxygenation abrogates this effect. Tumour hypoxia therefore acts as a novel regulator of DNA methylation. Tumours are epigenetically distinct from their tissue of origin, frequently showing increased DNA methylation of tumour suppressor gene promoters, but how these changes arise is poorly understood. Here, Diether Lambrechts and colleagues report that tumour hypoxia, pervasive in many solid tumours, reduces the activity of the oxygen-dependent ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes, which catalyse DNA demethylation through 5-methylcytosine oxidation. They show that oxygen is an important co-factor for TET activity, and hypoxia-induced loss of TET activity increases hypermethylation at gene promoters in vitro and at tumour suppressor genes in hypoxic tumours. The authors propose that tumour hypoxia directly reduces TET activity, leading to changes in DNA methylation and silencing gene expression. Countering hypermethylation by inhibiting DNA methylation or by normalizing tumour blood supply may therefore be of therapeutic benefit."
https://openalex.org/W2508142674,"In the past 50 years, cross-coupling reactions mediated by transition metals have changed the way in which complex organic molecules are synthesized. The predictable and chemoselective nature of these transformations has led to their widespread adoption across many areas of chemical research. However, the construction of a bond between two sp(3)-hybridized carbon atoms, a fundamental unit of organic chemistry, remains an important yet elusive objective for engineering cross-coupling reactions. In comparison to related procedures with sp(2)-hybridized species, the development of methods for sp(3)-sp(3) bond formation via transition metal catalysis has been hampered historically by deleterious side-reactions, such as β-hydride elimination with palladium catalysis or the reluctance of alkyl halides to undergo oxidative addition. To address this issue, nickel-catalysed cross-coupling processes can be used to form sp(3)-sp(3) bonds that utilize organometallic nucleophiles and alkyl electrophiles. In particular, the coupling of alkyl halides with pre-generated organozinc, Grignard and organoborane species has been used to furnish diverse molecular structures. However, the manipulations required to produce these activated structures is inefficient, leading to poor step- and atom-economies. Moreover, the operational difficulties associated with making and using these reactive coupling partners, and preserving them through a synthetic sequence, has hindered their widespread adoption. A generically useful sp(3)-sp(3) coupling technology that uses bench-stable, native organic functional groups, without the need for pre-functionalization or substrate derivatization, would therefore be valuable. Here we demonstrate that the synergistic merger of photoredox and nickel catalysis enables the direct formation of sp(3)-sp(3) bonds using only simple carboxylic acids and alkyl halides as the nucleophilic and electrophilic coupling partners, respectively. This metallaphotoredox protocol is suitable for many primary and secondary carboxylic acids. The merit of this coupling strategy is illustrated by the synthesis of the pharmaceutical tirofiban in four steps from commercially available starting materials."

https://openalex.org/W2509148007,"The physics of underdoped copper oxide superconductors, including the pseudogap, spin and charge ordering and their relation to superconductivity, is intensely debated. The overdoped copper oxides are perceived as simpler, with strongly correlated fermion physics evolving smoothly into the conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer behaviour. Pioneering studies on a few overdoped samples indicated that the superfluid density was much lower than expected, but this was attributed to pair-breaking, disorder and phase separation. Here we report the way in which the magnetic penetration depth and the phase stiffness depend on temperature and doping by investigating the entire overdoped side of the La2-xSrxCuO4 phase diagram. We measured the absolute values of the magnetic penetration depth and the phase stiffness to an accuracy of one per cent in thousands of samples; the large statistics reveal clear trends and intrinsic properties. The films are homogeneous; variations in the critical superconducting temperature within a film are very small (less than one kelvin). At every level of doping the phase stiffness decreases linearly with temperature. The dependence of the zero-temperature phase stiffness on the critical superconducting temperature is generally linear, but with an offset; however, close to the origin this dependence becomes parabolic. This scaling law is incompatible with the standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer description."
https://openalex.org/W2515569504,"Thermally activated ion channels are known to detect the entire thermal range from extreme heat (TRPV2), painful heat (TRPV1, TRPM3 and ANO1), non-painful warmth (TRPV3 and TRPV4) and non-painful coolness (TRPM8) through to painful cold (TRPA1)1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Genetic deletion of each of these ion channels, however, has only modest effects on thermal behaviour in mice6,7,8,9,10,11,12, with the exception of TRPM8, the deletion of which has marked effects on the perception of moderate coolness in the range 10–25 °C13. The molecular mechanism responsible for detecting non-painful warmth, in particular, is unresolved. Here we used calcium imaging to identify a population of thermally sensitive somatosensory neurons which do not express any of the known thermally activated TRP channels. We then used a combination of calcium imaging, electrophysiology and RNA sequencing to show that the ion channel generating heat sensitivity in these neurons is TRPM2. Autonomic neurons, usually thought of as exclusively motor, also express TRPM2 and respond directly to heat. Mice in which TRPM2 had been genetically deleted showed a striking deficit in their sensation of non-noxious warm temperatures, consistent with the idea that TRPM2 initiates a ‘warm’ signal which drives cool-seeking behaviour. The neuronal mechanism for the detection of non-painful warm stimuli has remained unclear; mammalian TRPM2 ion channel is shown to be required for warmth detection in the non-noxious range of 33–38 °C, and surprisingly to mediate responses to warmth in the autonomic nervous system. Despite the identification of several members of the TRP family of ion channels as heat-sensitive, the neuronal mechanism for the detection of non-painful warm stimuli has remained unclear, because genetic deletion of obvious candidates, such as TRPV3 and TRPV4, has had no effect on thermosensation. Rather than working with cloned channels, as is commonly done, Chun-Hsiang Tan and Peter McNaughton studied the responses of actual sensory neurons to thermal stimuli, then used an RNA-sequencing strategy to identify TRPM2 as genetically required for warmth detection in the non-noxious range of 33–38 °C, and, surprisingly, to mediate warm sensations in the autonomic nervous system."

Little research has been conducted on predicting fluctuations in the price and number of transactions of a variety of cryptocurrencies. Moreover, the few methods proposed to predict fluctuation in currency prices are inefficient because they fail to take into account the differences in attributes between real currencies and cryptocurrencies. This paper analyzes user comments in online cryptocurrency communities to predict fluctuations in the prices of cryptocurrencies and the number of transactions. By focusing on three cryptocurrencies, each with a large market size and user base, this paper attempts to predict such fluctuations by using a simple and efficient method."
https://openalex.org/W2512464499,"Copy number variation (CNV) affecting protein-coding genes contributes substantially to human diversity and disease. Here we characterized the rates and properties of rare genic CNVs (<0.5% frequency) in exome sequencing data from nearly 60,000 individuals in the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) database. On average, individuals possessed 0.81 deleted and 1.75 duplicated genes, and most (70%) carried at least one rare genic CNV. For every gene, we empirically estimated an index of relative intolerance to CNVs that demonstrated moderate correlation with measures of genic constraint based on single-nucleotide variation (SNV) and was independently correlated with measures of evolutionary conservation. For individuals with schizophrenia, genes affected by CNVs were more intolerant than in controls. The ExAC CNV data constitute a critical component of an integrated database spanning the spectrum of human genetic variation, aiding in the interpretation of personal genomes as well as population-based disease studies. These data are freely available for download and visualization online."
https://openalex.org/W2517649533,"The purpose of this study was to identify personality factor-associated predictors of smartphone addiction predisposition (SAP). Participants were 2,573 men and 2,281 women (n = 4,854) aged 20-49 years (Mean ± SD: 33.47 ± 7.52); participants completed the following questionnaires: the Korean Smartphone Addiction Proneness Scale (K-SAPS) for adults, the Behavioral Inhibition System/Behavioral Activation System questionnaire (BIS/BAS), the Dickman Dysfunctional Impulsivity Instrument (DDII), and the Brief Self-Control Scale (BSCS). In addition, participants reported their demographic information and smartphone usage pattern (weekday or weekend average usage hours and main use). We analyzed the data in three steps: (1) identifying predictors with logistic regression, (2) deriving causal relationships between SAP and its predictors using a Bayesian belief network (BN), and (3) computing optimal cut-off points for the identified predictors using the Youden index. Identified predictors of SAP were as follows: gender (female), weekend average usage hours, and scores on BAS-Drive, BAS-Reward Responsiveness, DDII, and BSCS. Female gender and scores on BAS-Drive and BSCS directly increased SAP. BAS-Reward Responsiveness and DDII indirectly increased SAP. We found that SAP was defined with maximal sensitivity as follows: weekend average usage hours > 4.45, BAS-Drive > 10.0, BAS-Reward Responsiveness > 13.8, DDII > 4.5, and BSCS > 37.4. This study raises the possibility that personality factors contribute to SAP. And, we calculated cut-off points for key predictors. These findings may assist clinicians screening for SAP using cut-off points, and further the understanding of SA risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W2510426428,"Understanding the evolutionary transformation of fish fins into tetrapod limbs is a fundamental problem in biology. The search for antecedents of tetrapod digits in fish has remained controversial because the distal skeletons of limbs and fins differ structurally, developmentally, and histologically. Moreover, comparisons of fins with limbs have been limited by a relative paucity of data on the cellular and molecular processes underlying the development of the fin skeleton. Here, we provide a functional analysis, using CRISPR/Cas9 and fate mapping, of 5' hox genes and enhancers in zebrafish that are indispensable for the development of the wrists and digits of tetrapods. We show that cells marked by the activity of an autopodial hoxa13 enhancer exclusively form elements of the fin fold, including the osteoblasts of the dermal rays. In hox13 knockout fish, we find that a marked reduction and loss of fin rays is associated with an increased number of endochondral distal radials. These discoveries reveal a cellular and genetic connection between the fin rays of fish and the digits of tetrapods and suggest that digits originated via the transition of distal cellular fates."
https://openalex.org/W2513116751,"Objectives A survey of a population-based sample of U.S adults was conducted to measure their attitudes about, and inform the design of the Precision Medicine Initiative’s planned national cohort study. Methods An online survey was conducted by GfK between May and June of 2015. The influence of different consent models on willingness to share data was examined by randomizing participants to one of eight consent scenarios. Results Of 4,777 people invited to take the survey, 2,706 responded and 2,601 (54% response rate) provided valid responses. Most respondents (79%) supported the proposed study, and 54% said they would definitely or probably participate if asked. Support for and willingness to participate in the study varied little among demographic groups; younger respondents, LGBT respondents, and those with more years of education were significantly more likely to take part if asked. The most important study incentive that the survey asked about was learning about one’s own health information. Willingness to share data and samples under broad, study-by-study, menu and dynamic consent models was similar when a statement about transparency was included in the consent scenarios. Respondents were generally interested in taking part in several governance functions of the cohort study. Conclusions A large majority of the U.S. adults who responded to the survey supported a large national cohort study. Levels of support for the study and willingness to participate were both consistent across most demographic groups. The opportunity to learn health information about one’s self from the study appears to be a strong motivation to participate."
https://openalex.org/W2509164853,"Background Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is an emerging enterovirus-induced infectious disease for which the environmental risk factors promoting disease circulation remain inconclusive. This study aims to quantify the association of daily weather variation with hospitalizations for HFMD in Hong Kong, a subtropical city in China. Methods A time series of daily counts of HFMD public hospital admissions from 2008 through 2011 in Hong Kong was regressed on daily mean temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, solar radiation and total rainfall, using a combination of negative binomial generalized additive models and distributed lag non-linear models, adjusting for trend, season, and day of week. Results There was a positive association between temperature and HFMD, with increasing trends from 8 to 20°C and above 25°C with a plateau in between. A hockey-stick relationship of relative humidity with HFMD was found, with markedly increasing risks over 80%. Moderate rainfall and stronger wind and solar radiation were also found to be associated with more admissions. Conclusions The present study provides quantitative evidence that short-term meteorological variations could be used as early indicators for potential HFMD outbreaks. Climate change is likely to lead to a substantial increase in severe HFMD cases in this subtropical city in the absence of further interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2511000289,"A wide range of species can be sown as cover crops during fallow periods to provide various ecosystem services. Plant establishment is a key stage, especially when sowing occurs in summer with high soil temperatures and low water availability. The aim of this study was to determine the response of germination to temperature and water potential for diverse cover crop species. Based on these characteristics, we developed contrasting functional groups that group species with the same germination ability, which may be useful to adapt species choice to climatic sowing conditions. Germination of 36 different species from six botanical families was measured in the laboratory at eight temperatures ranging from 4.5–43°C and at four water potentials. Final germination percentages, germination rate, cardinal temperatures, base temperature and base water potential were calculated for each species. Optimal temperatures varied from 21.3–37.2°C, maximum temperatures at which the species could germinate varied from 27.7–43.0°C and base water potentials varied from -0.1 to -2.6 MPa. Most cover crops were adapted to summer sowing with a relatively high mean optimal temperature for germination, but some Fabaceae species were more sensitive to high temperatures. Species mainly from Poaceae and Brassicaceae were the most resistant to water deficit and germinated under a low base water potential. Species were classified, independent of family, according to their ability to germinate under a range of temperatures and according to their base water potential in order to group species by functional germination groups. These groups may help in choosing the most adapted cover crop species to sow based on climatic conditions in order to favor plant establishment and the services provided by cover crops during fallow periods. Our data can also be useful as germination parameters in crop models to simulate the emergence of cover crops under different pedoclimatic conditions and crop management practices."

https://openalex.org/W2508043536,"This paper presents the results of a mixed-methods study examining adaptation strategies that property owners in low-income, rapidly urbanizing areas in Malawi adopt to address the limitations of pit latrines, the most common method of disposing human excreta. A particular challenge is lack of space for constructing new latrines as population density increases: traditional practice has been to cap full pits and simply move to a new site, but increasing demands on space require new approaches to extend the service life of latrines. In this context, we collected data on sanitation technology choices from January to September 2013 through 48 in-depth interviews and a stated preference survey targeting 1,300 property owners from 27 low-income urban areas. Results showed that property owners with concern about space for replacing pit latrines were 1.8 times more likely to select pit emptying service over the construction of new pit latrines with a slab floor (p = 0.02) but there was no significant association between concern about space for replacing pit latrines and intention to adopt locally promoted, novel sanitation technology known as ecological sanitation (ecosan). Property owners preferred to adapt existing, known technology by constructing replacement pit latrines on old pit latrine locations, reducing the frequency of replacing pit latrines, or via emptying pit latrines when full. This study highlights potential challenges to adoption of wholly new sanitation technologies, even when they present clear advantages to end users. To scale, alternative sanitation technologies for rapidly urbanising cities should offer clear advantages, be affordable, be easy to use when shared among multiple households, and their design should be informed by existing adaptation strategies and local knowledge."
https://openalex.org/W2512492485,"Voltage-dependent CaV1.2 L-type Ca2+ channels (LTCC) are the main route for calcium entry in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Several studies have also determined the relevant role of store-operated Ca2+ channels (SOCC) in vascular tone regulation. Nevertheless, the role of Orai1- and TRPC1-dependent SOCC in vascular tone regulation and their possible interaction with CaV1.2 are still unknown. The current study sought to characterize the co-activation of SOCC and LTCC upon stimulation by agonists, and to determine the possible crosstalk between Orai1, TRPC1, and CaV1.2. Aorta rings and isolated VSMC obtained from wild type or smooth muscle-selective conditional CaV1.2 knock-out (CaV1.2KO) mice were used to study vascular contractility, intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, and distribution of ion channels. We found that serotonin (5-HT) or store depletion with thapsigargin (TG) enhanced intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and stimulated aorta contraction. These responses were sensitive to LTCC and SOCC inhibitors. Also, 5-HT- and TG-induced responses were significantly attenuated in CaV1.2KO mice. Furthermore, hyperpolarization induced with cromakalim or valinomycin significantly reduced both 5-HT and TG responses, whereas these responses were enhanced with LTCC agonist Bay-K-8644. Interestingly, in situ proximity ligation assay revealed that CaV1.2 interacts with Orai1 and TRPC1 in untreated VSMC. These interactions enhanced significantly after stimulation of cells with 5-HT and TG. Therefore, these data indicate for the first time a functional interaction between Orai1, TRPC1, and CaV1.2 channels in VSMC, confirming that upon agonist stimulation, vessel contraction involves Ca2+ entry due to co-activation of Orai1- and TRPC1-dependent SOCC and LTCC."

https://openalex.org/W2514196292,"In eukaryotes the bimetallic Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes play important roles in the biology of reactive oxygen species by disproportionating superoxide anion. Recently, we reported that the fungal pathogen Candida albicans expresses a novel copper-only SOD, known as SOD5, that lacks the zinc cofactor and electrostatic loop (ESL) domain of Cu/Zn-SODs for substrate guidance. Despite these abnormalities, C. albicans SOD5 can disproportionate superoxide at rates limited only by diffusion. Here we demonstrate that this curious copper-only SOD occurs throughout the fungal kingdom as well as in phylogenetically distant oomycetes or “pseudofungi” species. It is the only form of extracellular SOD in fungi and oomycetes, in stark contrast to the extracellular Cu/Zn-SODs of plants and animals. Through structural biology and biochemical approaches we demonstrate that these copper-only SODs have evolved with a specialized active site consisting of two highly conserved residues equivalent to SOD5 Glu-110 and Asp-113. The equivalent positions are zinc binding ligands in Cu/Zn-SODs and have evolved in copper-only SODs to control catalysis and copper binding in lieu of zinc and the ESL. Similar to the zinc ion in Cu/Zn-SODs, SOD5 Glu-110 helps orient a key copper-coordinating histidine and extends the pH range of enzyme catalysis. SOD5 Asp-113 connects to the active site in a manner similar to that of the ESL in Cu/Zn-SODs and assists in copper cofactor binding. Copper-only SODs are virulence factors for certain fungal pathogens; thus this unique active site may be a target for future anti-fungal strategies."

The area under the curve of glycemia as well as sucrase activity in the small intestine were lowered after inulin treatment. Pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene confirmed important changes in gut microbiota (mostly in favor of Blautia genus) due to inulin extract supplementation. Interestingly, the suppressive effect of inulin extract on postprandial glycemia also occurred when inulin was directly added to the sucrose solution, suggesting that the effect on sucrose digestion did not require chronic inulin administration. In vitro tests confirmed a direct inhibition of sucrase enzyme by the inulin extract, thereby suggesting that native chicory inulin, in addition to its well-known prebiotic effect, is also able to decrease the digestibility of carbohydrates, a phenomenon that can contribute in the control of post prandial glycemia. We may not exclude that the sucrose escaping the digestion could also contribute to the changes in the gut microbiota after a chronic treatment with inulin."

Laboratory-confirmed, hospitalized AdV pneumonia adults were prospectively enrolled in Beijing Chao-Yang hospital from March to June 2013. Clinical data and serial whole blood and respiratory tract secretions from such patients were collected. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to quantify the viral load. A total of 14 AdV pneumonia cases were consecutively enrolled, and four of them were fatal. Ten cases were caused by AdV-55, three by AdV-7 and one by AdV-3. There were no differences in age, gender or underlying diseases between the patients in the fatal cases and surviving cases. At admission (on day 5-7 after illness onset), the patients in fatal cases presented higher initial viral loads in respiratory tract secretions (8.578 ± 2.115 vs 6.263 ± 1.225 Log10 copies/ml, p = 0.023). All patients in fatal cases presented with viremia on day 12-14 (100% vs 66.7%, p = 0.017). A higher initial viral load in the respiratory tract and sustained viremia (more than 2 weeks) may be predictors for fatal clinical outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2514979974,"The tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib has resulted in excellent responses in the majority of Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia (CML) patients; however, resistance is observed in 20–30% of patients. More recently, resistance to the second generation TKIs, nilotinib and dasatinib, has also been observed albeit at a lower incidence. ABCB1 has previously been implicated in TKI export and its overexpression linked to TKI resistance. In this study the dynamics of nilotinib resistance was studied in CML cell lines with particular focus on ABCB1 expression levels during development of resistance. Results revealed ABCB1 overexpression is likely an important initiator of nilotinib resistance in vitro. ABCB1 overexpression was also observed in cell lines as an intermediate step during development of resistance to imatinib and dasatinib in vitro. We conclude that ABCB1 overexpression may provide an initial platform to facilitate development of additional mechanisms for resistance to TKIs. This provides a rationale for investigating this phenomenon in patients undergoing TKI therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2516622264,"Cataclysmic variable stars (CVs) are close binary systems consisting of a white dwarf (primary) that is accreting matter from a low-mass companion star (secondary). From time to time such systems undergo large-amplitude brightenings. The most spectacular eruptions, over $10^4$ times in brightness, occur in classical novae and are caused by a thermonuclear runaway on the surface of the white dwarf. Such eruptions are thought to recur on timescales of $10^4-10^6$. In between, the system's properties depend primarily on the mass-transfer rate: if it is lower than a $10^{-9} M_{\odot}$/year, the accretion becomes unstable and the matter is dumped onto the white dwarf during quasi-periodic dwarf nova outbursts. The hibernation hypothesis predicts that nova eruptions strongly affect the mass-transfer rate, keeping it high for centuries after the event. Subsequently, the mass-transfer rate should significantly decrease for $10^3-10^6$ years, starting the hibernation phase. After that the nova awakes again - with accretion returning to the pre-eruption level and leading to a new nova explosion. The hibernation model predicts cyclical evolution of CVs through phases of high and low mass-transfer. The theory gained some support from the discovery of ancient nova shells around dwarf novae Z Cam and AT Cnc, but direct evidence for considerable mass-transfer changes prior, during and after nova eruptions has not hitherto been found. Here we report long-term observations of the classical nova V1213 Cen (Nova Cen 2009) covering its pre- and post-eruption phases. Within the six years before the explosion, the system revealed dwarf nova outbursts indicative of a low mass-transfer rate. The post-nova is two orders of magnitude brighter than the pre-nova at minimum light with no trace of dwarf nova behavior, implying that the mass-transfer rate increased considerably as a result of the nova explosion."
https://openalex.org/W2517110431,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are capable of multipotent differentiation into connective tissues and as such are an attractive source for autologous cell-based regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. Epigenetic mechanisms, like DNA methylation, contribute to the changes in gene expression in ageing. However there was a lack of sufficient knowledge of the role that differential methylation plays during chondrogenic, osteogenic and tenogenic differentiation from ageing MSCs. This study undertook genome level determination of the effects of DNA methylation on expression in engineered tissues from chronologically aged MSCs. We compiled unique DNA methylation signatures from chondrogenic, osteogenic, and tenogenic engineered tissues derived from young; n = 4 (21.8 years ± 2.4 SD) and old; n = 4 (65.5 years±8.3SD) human MSCs donors using the Illumina HumanMethylation 450 Beadchip arrays and compared these to gene expression by RNA sequencing. Unique and common signatures of global DNA methylation were identified. There were 201, 67 and 32 chondrogenic, osteogenic and tenogenic age-related DE protein-coding genes respectively. Findings inferred the nature of the transcript networks was predominantly for ‘cell death and survival’, ‘cell morphology’, and ‘cell growth and proliferation’. Further studies are required to validate if this gene expression effect translates to cell events. Alternative splicing (AS) was dysregulated in ageing with 119, 21 and 9 differential splicing events identified in chondrogenic, osteogenic and tenogenic respectively, and enrichment in genes associated principally with metabolic processes. Gene ontology analysis of differentially methylated loci indicated age-related enrichment for all engineered tissue types in ‘skeletal system morphogenesis’, ‘regulation of cell proliferation’ and ‘regulation of transcription’ suggesting that dynamic epigenetic modifications may occur in genes associated with shared and distinct pathways dependent upon engineered tissue type. An altered phenotype in engineered tissues was observed with ageing at numerous levels. These changes represent novel insights into the ageing process, with implications for stem cell therapies in older patients. In addition we have identified a number of tissue-dependant pathways, which warrant further studies."
https://openalex.org/W2507749905,"While influenza A viruses comprise a heterogeneous group of clinically relevant influenza viruses, influenza B viruses form a more homogeneous cluster, divided mainly into two lineages: Victoria and Yamagata. This divergence has complicated seasonal influenza vaccine design, which traditionally contained two seasonal influenza A virus strains and one influenza B virus strain. We examined the distribution of the two influenza B virus lineages in Israel, between 2011-2014, in hospitalized and in non-hospitalized (community) influenza B virus-infected patients. We showed that influenza B virus infections can lead to hospitalization and demonstrated that during some winter seasons, both influenza B virus lineages circulated simultaneously in Israel. We further show that the influenza B virus Yamagata lineage was dominant, circulating in the county in the last few years of the study period, consistent with the anti-Yamagata influenza B virus antibodies detected in the serum samples of affected individuals residing in Israel in the year 2014. Interestingly, we found that elderly people were particularly vulnerable to Yamagata lineage influenza B virus infections."
https://openalex.org/W2507928487,"Commercial fisheries may impact marine ecosystems and affect populations of predators like seabirds. In the Southern Ocean, there is an extensive fishery for Antarctic krill Euphausia superba that is projected to increase further. Comparing distribution and prey selection of fishing operations versus predators is needed to predict fishery-related impacts on krill-dependent predators. In this context, it is important to consider not only predators breeding near the fishing grounds but also the ones breeding far away and that disperse during the non-breeding season where they may interact with fisheries. In this study, we first quantified the overlap between the distribution of the Antarctic krill fisheries and the distribution of a krill dependent seabird, the Antarctic petrel Thalassoica antarctica, during both the breeding and non-breeding season. We tracked birds from the world biggest Antarctic petrel colony (Svarthamaren, Dronning Maud Land), located >1000 km from the main fishing areas, during three consecutive seasons. The overall spatial overlap between krill fisheries and Antarctic petrels was limited but varied greatly among and within years, and was high in some periods during the non-breeding season. In a second step, we described the length frequency distribution of Antarctic krill consumed by Antarctic petrels, and compared this with results from fisheries, as well as from diet studies in other krill predators. Krill taken by Antarctic petrels did not differ in size from that taken by trawls or from krill taken by most Antarctic krill predators. Selectivity for specific Antarctic krill stages seems generally low in Antarctic predators. Overall, our results show that competition between Antarctic petrels and krill fisheries is currently likely negligible. However, if krill fisheries are to increase in the future, competition with the Antarctic petrel may occur, even with birds breeding thousands of kilometers away."

In all known LPS structures, Kdo residues possess α-anomeric configurations, and the corresponding inverting α-Kdo transferases are well characterized. Recently, it has been shown that a large group of capsular polysaccharides from Gram-negative bacteria, produced by ATP-binding cassette transporter-dependent pathways, are also attached to a lipid anchor through a conserved Kdo oligosaccharide. In the study reported here, the structure of this Kdo linker was determined by NMR spectroscopy, revealing alternating β-(2→4)- and β-(2→7)-linked Kdo residues. KpsC contains two retaining β-Kdo glycosyltransferase domains belonging to family GT99 that are responsible for polymerizing the β-Kdo linker on its glycolipid acceptor.

The Kdo transferase activities of these proteins were determined in vitro using synthetic acceptors, and the reaction products were characterized using TLC, mass spectrometry, and NMR spectroscopy. The N- and C-terminal domains were found to catalyze formation of β-(2→4) and β-(2→7) linkages, respectively.

Pathogenic bacteria are often covered by a protective layer of polysaccharide known as the capsule. Capsules are important virulence determinants because, depending on the pathogen, they can protect bacteria against phagocytosis and complement-mediated killing, as well as helping in adherence to host cells (1Willis L.M.

Biochem. 2006; 75: 39-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter-dependent system is the focus of this study. In the nomenclature of Escherichia coli, these systems generate “group 2” capsules (1Willis L.M. Whitfield C.

Biochem. 2006; 75: 39-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). In group 2 CPS assembly, biosynthesis is initiated by KpsS, which transfers a single 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo) residue from its precursor (CMP-β-Kdo) to (lyso)phosphatidylglycerol, in a reaction located at the cytoplasm-membrane interface (1Willis L.M. Whitfield C. Structure, biosynthesis, and function of bacterial capsular polysaccharides synthesized by ABC transporter-dependent pathways.Carbohydr. Res. 2013; 378: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The KpsS product is then extended by KpsC to form the β-Kdo linker, which typically consists of five to nine Kdo residues (3Willis L.M. Stupak J. Richards M.R. Lowary T.L. Li J. Whitfield C. Conserved glycolipid termini in capsular polysaccharides synthesized by ATP-binding cassette transporter-dependent pathways in Gram-negative pathogens.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 7868-7873Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The serotype-specific glycosyltransferases (GTs) extend this linker to complete polymerization of CPS in the cytoplasm before it is exported by the pathway-defining ABC transporter and then translocated to the cell surface (1Willis L.M.

Biochem. 2006; 75: 39-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). The native lipid-linked β-Kdo-oligosaccharides were isolated from E. coli K1 and K5 and Neisseria meningitidis group B by enzymatic depolymerization of high molecular mass CPS, followed by isolation of the hydrophobic glycolipid components (3Willis L.M. Stupak J. Richards M.R. Lowary T.L. Li J. Whitfield C.

U.S.A. 2013; 110: 7868-7873Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). GC-MS analysis of partially methylated 3-deoxyoctitol acetates derived from the methylated β-Kdo-oligosaccharide showed the presence of →4)- and →7)-substituted Kdop in roughly equal amounts. This finding suggested a linear structure with alternating (2→4) and (2→7) linkages, although other glycosylation patterns (e.g. a tetrasaccharide repeat unit) were not excluded. Structural analysis of E. coli K1 and K5 β-Kdo-oligosaccharides by NMR spectroscopy identified the β-anomeric configuration of Kdo residues, but the inherent heterogeneity of the samples, and significant signal overlap, precluded the complete assignment of NMR spectra. Polymerizing KpsC β-Kdo transferases from E. coli and N. meningitidis are functionally exchangeable in vivo. Both are composed of two GT domains, which may correlate with the predicted β-(2→4)- and β-(2→7)-linkages in the oligosaccharide linker. The domains share 35–36% sequence identity and possess similar predicted secondary structures. Functional activity was observed in vivo when the domains were expressed as separate polypeptides, suggesting they fold independently, but neither domain alone was sufficient to reconstitute CPS synthesis in vivo (4Willis L.M. Whitfield C. KpsC and KpsS are retaining 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo) transferases involved in synthesis of bacterial capsules.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The oligosaccharides synthesized in vitro by N. meningitidis KpsS and KpsC on a lipid acceptor have been characterized by LC-MS, but due to a small amount of obtained products, their precise structure has never been elucidated (4Willis L.M.

However, the β-Kdo GT structure showed extensive insertions, deletions, and structural rearrangements, compared with the canonical fold, which led to WbbB becoming the first example of a new GT99 family in the CAZy database (8Lombard V.

Bioinformatic analyses identified several other putative β-Kdo GTs genes in bacterial strains that produce β-Kdo-containing CPS and/or lipopolysaccharide O-antigens (5Ovchinnikova O.G. Mallette E.

U.S.A. 2016; 113: E3120-E3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Despite extremely low sequence similarity shared with the WbbB prototype, multiple sequence alignment revealed two motifs within the enzyme active site, which are invariant across all identified β-Kdo transferases, including KpsC. The HP motif is located within the donor substrate binding pocket and involved in coordinating the cytosine ring of CMP-Kdo, similar to the coordination of CMP-sialic acid by some bacterial sialyltransferases. The QXXXD motif is unique to β-Kdo GTs and is located in a Kdo binding pocket. The Asp residue of this motif is essential for WbbB activity and is considered as a potential catalytic nucleophile. ABC transporter-dependent pathways involving synthesis of a β-Kdo linker are found in prominent human pathogens, including E. coli, N. meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae (1Willis L.M.

The distribution in human pathogens, and the importance of the capsule layers in the virulence of those bacteria, makes the KpsS and KpsC β-Kdo GTs attractive targets for small molecule inhibitors in anti-virulence strategies, where unmasked bacteria would be susceptible to host defenses. In this work, we extend our current understanding of capsule assembly pathways and β-Kdo GT function by characterizing the precise catalytic activities of the dual E. coli K1 KpsC domains and determining the unequivocal structure of its β-Kdo oligosaccharide product. E. coli K1 KpsC (GenBankTM accession number KIE82100) is a protein containing 675 amino acids with two domains corresponding to residues 38–299 and 379–623, respectively, based on Conserved Domain Database search (Fig. 1A). We aimed to examine the function of each KpsC domain by either expressing them as separate polypeptides or, in a complementary approach, by generating constructs with one of the domains catalytically inactivated. Regions corresponding to amino acids 2–675, 2–352, 303–675, and 353–675 of the protein were cloned into the pET28a(+) vector generating proteins with C-terminal His6 tags. The prototype WbbB β-Kdo GT99 enzyme contained conserved HP and QXXXD motifs that are essential for its catalytic activity (5Ovchinnikova O.G. Mallette E. Koizumi A. Lowary T.L. Kimber M.S. Whitfield C. Bacterial β-Kdo glycosyltransferases represent a new glycosyltransferase family (GT99).Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2016; 113: E3120-E3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of each KpsC domain with WbbB identified His-194, Pro-195, and Asp-160 in the N-terminal domain and His-522, Pro-523, and Asp-488 in the C-terminal domain as residues in these essential motifs. Using site-directed mutagenesis, the HP residues in each domain of KpsC(2–675) were replaced with two alanine residues, and an additional construct was made with both domains mutated in this way. Independently, the predicted catalytic nucleophilic Asp was changed to Ala in both domains, separately and in tandem. The generated plasmids (Table 1) were overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) to examine the solubility and enzymatic activity of KpsC constructs. Full-length KpsC and its N-terminal domain were expressed in amounts of soluble protein sufficient for purification and analysis. In contrast, the KpsC(353–675) protein and all of the site-directed mutants containing one inactivated domain were mostly found in the membrane fraction.TABLE 1Plasmid summaryPlasmidDescriptionRef./sourcepET28a(+)Protein expression vector under control of T7 promoter; KnrNovagenpWQ879pET28a(+) derivative expressing KpsC (2–675)This studypWQ880pET28a(+) derivative expressing KpsC (2–352)This studypWQ881pET28a(+) derivative expressing KpsC (303–675)This studypWQ882pET28a(+) derivative expressing KpsC (353–675)This studypWQ883pET28a(+) derivative expressing KpsC (2–675) H194A/P195AThis studypWQ884pET28a(+) derivative expressing KpsC (2–675) H522A/P523AThis studypWQ885pET28a(+) derivative expressing KpsC (2–675) H194A/P195A/H522A/P523AThis studypWQ886pET28a(+) derivative expressing KpsC (2–675) D160AThis studypWQ887pET28a(+) derivative expressing KpsC (2–675) D488AThis studypWQ888pET28a(+) derivative expressing KpsC (2–675) D160A/D488AThis studypJKB72pCB20 derivative expressing E. coli K-12 KdsB-His618Gronow S.

The activated sugar donor, CMP-β-Kdo, is inherently unstable (11Lin C.H. Murray B.W. Ollmann I.R. Wong C.H. Why is CMP-ketodeoxyoctonate highly unstable?.Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 780-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and was generated in situ using CTP, Kdo, and purified CMP-Kdo synthetase (KdsB). Reaction products were analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) (Fig. 1C). As expected, lysates containing KpsC(2–675) converted the acceptor to a product that was retained at the origin, consistent with addition of multiple Kdo residues. As negative controls, lysates from cells transformed with the empty vector, or lysates containing mutant proteins with both β-Kdo GT domains inactivated (KpsC(2–675) H194A/P195A/H522A/P523A, and KpsC(2–675) D160A/D488A), were all completely inactive in reactions with acceptor 1. Mutations affecting only the C-terminal domain (KpsC(2–675) H522A/P523A, KpsC(2–675) D488A) also resulted in inactivity, whereas mutations to only the N-terminal domain (KpsC(2–675) H194A/P195A and KpsC(2–675) D160A) resulted in enzymes capable of full conversion of acceptor 1 to a product that migrates slower on TLC. Attempts to create active constructs containing only the C-terminal domain met with mixed success; KpsC(353–675) was inactive, but a slightly larger construct (KpsC(303–675)) showed partial conversion of substrate to a product co-migrating with those obtained with mutationally inactivated N-terminal domains. When both KpsC(2–675) H194A/P195A and KpsC(2–675) H522A/P523A (or KpsC(2–675) D160A and KpsC(2–675) D488A) were added together in a single reaction mixture, a new product was observed that mostly remains at the origin of TLC plate. This finding showed that constructs with inactive C-terminal domains retain their ability to contribute to polymerization despite their inability to use the acceptor 1 when examined in isolation. The same was true for N-terminal domain KpsC(2–352), which, on its own, was inactive in reaction with 1 but contributed to polymerization when KpsC(2–675) D160A was also present in the reaction. Based on the solubility and the observed activity in these whole cell lysate assays, the WT KpsC(2–675), its N-terminal domain KpsC(2–352), and a mutant with catalytically inactivated N-terminal domain KpsC(2–675) D160A (hereafter referred as KpsC, KpsC-N, and KpsC-C, Fig. 2A) were chosen for protein purification and detailed structural characterization of their reaction products. To up-scale the enzymatic reactions and to produce sufficient amounts of products for NMR analysis, we moved away from disaccharide acceptor 1 to a more readily obtainable acceptor 2, comprising one Kdo residue linked, through an eight-carbon chain, to a p-methoxybenzamide tag (Fig. 2B). The change of tag overcame (photo)degradation problems we routinely experience with fluorescein-tagged acceptors. The activities of purified KpsC-N and KpsC toward substrate 2 were confirmed in vitro using a coupled assay, as described above. Switching to an acceptor with a single Kdo residue potentially imposes more structural constraints for catalysis with respect to proximity of the acceptor tag and the alkyl linker to the active site(s), as these differ from the native acceptor structure (the KpsS product). As anticipated, significantly lower conversion was observed for both KpsC-N and KpsC in reaction with acceptor 2, following incubation times that were sufficient for complete conversion of 1 by KpsC under the same conditions. A similar decrease in activity was observed when a single Kdo attached to fluorescein tag was used (data not shown), which excluded the possibility that the lower reactivity arises from the p-methoxybenzamide tag itself. Instead, it appears that the enzyme prefers to have acceptors containing at least two Kdo residues. Increasing incubation times (longer than 1 h) did not significantly improve the conversion. This was likely because of instability of both KpsC constructs, which precipitated over time in the reaction mixture, and/or the instability of in situ generated CMP-β-Kdo, which undergoes rapid hydrolysis to CMP and Kdo (11Lin C.H. Murray B.W. Ollmann I.R. Wong C.H. Why is CMP-ketodeoxyoctonate highly unstable?.Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 780-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To overcome the low conversion issues, an excess of KpsC-N was included in the reaction, and this facilitated complete conversion of 2 to product 3 within 1 h. The product 3 was purified and fully characterized via NMR spectroscopy and ESI MS, as described below, and then used as an acceptor to analyze activities of KpsC and KpsC-C (Fig. 2C). Product 3 from a scaled-up reaction was purified using a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge followed by gel permeation chromatography on Sephadex G-25 and analyzed by NMR spectroscopy. The complete assignment of 1H and 13C NMR signals of 3 was performed using a combination of 1H NMR, proton-coupled 13C NMR, two-dimensional 1H,1H correlation spectroscopy (COSY), total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY), rotating-frame Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (ROESY), 1H,13C heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC), and heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC) experiments. The HSQC spectrum of product 3 (Fig. 3) showed two pairs of methylene signals at δC 35.0 and 36.4, characteristic of Kdop C-3 (12Lenter M. Jann B. Jann K. Structure of the K16 antigen from Escherichia coli O-7: K16: H-, a Kdo-containing capsular polysaccharide.Carbohydr. Res. 1990; 197: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), indicating the presence of two Kdo residues (labeled A and B). Correlations from H-3 to H-5 were traced in the COSY and TOCSY spectra, and the signals for corresponding carbons were assigned by HSQC. A small 3J5,6 coupling constant impeded coherence transfer after H-5, and the remaining assignment was completed using ROESY and HMBC data. The NMR chemical shifts for the carbohydrate moiety of acceptor 2 and product 3 are given in Table 2. As judged by 3JC-1, H-3ax coupling constants (13Unger F.M. Stix D. Schulz G. The anomeric configurations of the two ammonium (methyl 3-deoxy-d-manno-2-octulopyranosid)onate salts (methyl α- and β-ketopyranosides of KDO).Carbohydr.

Res. 1990; 197: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), both Kdo residues are β-linked. The 13C NMR chemical shifts of residue B were indicative of its terminal position, whereas residue A C-4 signal at δ 73.3 was shifted downfield compared with its position at δ 68.7 in acceptor 2, because of the α-glycosylation effect. Based on 13C NMR data and the correlation with 1H signals in HMBC spectrum, i.e. C-2/O-CH2-C at δ 102.3/3.39 and 102.3/3.66 (Fig. 3), residue A was recognized as the Kdo moiety attached to the alkyl linker. Finally, the (2→4)-linkage between Kdo residues was unambiguously confirmed by the correlation in the HMBC spectrum between the anomeric carbon and proton at the substitution position B C-2/A H-4 at δ 103.4/3.83.TABLE 21H and 13C NMR data for the carbohydrate moiety of acceptor 2 and products 3–5 (δ, ppm)Sugar residueC-1C-2H-3ax C-3H-3eqH-4 C-4H-5 C-5H-6 C-6H-7 C-7H-8a C-8H-8bAcceptor 2aData were from the HSQC experiment.β-Kdop-(2→1.782.403.753.943.603.903.743.8536.068.766.674.870.465.3Product 3→4)-β-Kdop-(2→A1.812.353.834.183.603.883.733.84175.0102.335.073.366.674.070.265.5β-Kdop-(2→B1.862.453.733.963.623.913.733.86174.8103.436.468.566.674.670.265.4Product 4→4)-β-Kdop-(2→A1.812.323.824.163.573.873.733.84175.1102.434.973.766.774.470.465.6→7)-β-Kdop-(2→B1.872.463.724.023.594.403.703.80174.7103.636.668.866.373.772.463.7β-Kdop-(2→C1.852.443.773.953.463.943.783.95175.5101.935.668.966.874.870.665.5Product 5→4)-β-Kdop-(2→A1.942.313.884.153.423.903.793.86175.0101.834.073.666.774.670.565.4→7)-β-Kdop-(2→B1.882.453.713.993.594.373.703.80174.7103.636.568.866.273.772.364.0a Data were from the HSQC experiment. Open table in a new tab The structure of product 3 was further confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI MS). The ESI mass spectrum of 3 in negative ion mode contained the major peak [M − H]− at m/z 718.30, which showed a gain of 220 atomic mass units compared with acceptor 2, corresponding to one added Kdo residue (Fig. 4A). Thus, the reaction product of N-terminal KpsC domain has structure 3 shown in Fig. 2C. The fully characterized product 3 was used as a substrate in a scaled-up reaction with KpsC-C. The reaction product 4 was purified and analyzed essentially as described for 3. The 1H and HSQC spectra showed the presence of three Kdop residues (labeled A, B, and C) (Fig. 3), and the signals within each spin system were assigned using homo- and heteronuclear NMR experiments, as described above (Table 2). The β-anomeric configuration was inferred based on the difference between chemical shifts of H-3ax and H-3eq of Δ 0.51 ppm (A) and 0.59 ppm (B and C), by comparing published data (12Lenter M. Jann B. Jann K. Structure of the K16 antigen from Escherichia coli O-7: K16: H-, a Kdo-containing capsular polysaccharide.Carbohydr. Res. 1990; 197: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) for the methyl esters of methyl α- and β-glycosides of Kdop (i.e. Δδ 0.27 and 0.64 ppm, respectively). The signals for residue A were close to those for the →4)-substituted Kdo residue A in product 3, whereas the signals for residue C are indicative of its terminal position. The substitution of residue B in 4 at position O-7 was inferred from a positive α-glycosylation effect on C-7 and the negative β-glycosylation effect on neighboring carbons in residue B (C-6 and C-8) compared with 13C NMR signals of the terminal Kdo residue in 3. The HMBC spectrum showed the correlation between residue C C-2 and residue B H-7 at δ 101.9/4.40, which, taking in consideration the substitution positions, determined the sequence of Kdo residue as follows: C(2→7)B(2→4)A. Thus, the C-terminal domain of KpsC catalyzed the addition of a single Kdo residue at position O-7 of →4)-linked Kdo residue. The ESI MS spectrum of 4 showed a predominant ion peak [M − H]− at m/z 938.36, which corresponded to a trisaccharide (Fig. 4B). The spectrum also contained a peak at m/z 718.30, which could be explained by traces of contaminating unreacted substrate 3, slow degradation of 4 during sample handling, and/or cleavage of (2→7) linkage because of in-source fragmentation of parent ion. Similar in-source fragmentation resulted in loss of terminal Kdo residue was reported earlier for a Kdo-(2→3)-Rha-(1→3)-GlcNAc trisaccharide derivative (5Ovchinnikova O.G. Mallette E. Koizumi A. Lowary T.L. Kimber M.S. Whitfield C. Bacterial β-Kdo glycosyltransferases represent a new glycosyltransferase family (GT99).Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2016; 113: E3120-E3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). TLC analysis of product 4 left over after ESI MS analysis confirmed that the amount of contaminating 3 (if present) is very low (Fig. 4C). The acceptor substrate specificity of the N- and C-terminal domains and the structural data for the products 3 and 4 suggested that they together generate an alternating linkage pattern in the native linker oligosaccharide. To confirm unequivocally this proposal and to elucidate the structure of Kdo linker, the products 3 and 4 were used as acceptors in reactions with purified KpsC and a 20-fold molar excess of donor substrate. The obtained products 5 and 6 were purified and characterized by NMR spectroscopy. The 1H NMR spectra of 5 and 6 were essentially identical (Fig. 5); therefore, the 2D NMR experiments were performed only on product 5. The 13C HSQC spectrum of 5 (Fig. 6) demonstrated the presence of a disaccharide repeat unit. Downfield displacement of the signals for residue A C-4 and residue B C-7 because of the α-glycosylation effect indicated the positions"

Here we show that, in cultured breast tumor and non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cells, TRIM29 is up-regulated in response to hypoxic stress but not DNA damage. Hypoxia-induced up-regulation of TRIM29 is dependent upon ATM and HIF1α and occurs through increased transcription of the TRIM29 gene. Basal expression of TRIM29 is also down-regulated in cells expressing diminished levels of ATM, and findings suggest that this occurs through basal NF-κB activity as knockdown of the NF-κB subunit RelA suppresses TRIM29 abundance. We have previously shown that the activity of the TWIST1 oncogene is antagonized by TRIM29 and now show that TRIM29 is necessary to block the up-regulation of TWIST1 that occurs in response to hypoxic stress.

This study establishes TRIM29 as a hypoxia-induced tumor suppressor gene and provides a novel molecular mechanism for ATM-dependent breast cancer suppression. The ATM gene product is a high molecular weight protein kinase that is catalytically activated in response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). 4The abbreviations used are: DSB, double-strand break; HMEC, human mammary epithelial cell; Q-PCR, quantitative RT-PCR; NAC, N-acetylcysteine; ROS, reactive oxygen species. Upon activation, ATM phosphorylates numerous downstream substrates that activate a range of cellular responses to genotoxic stress such as cell cycle checkpoints, apoptosis, and DNA repair (1Shiloh Y. ATM and related protein kinases: safeguarding genome integrity.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2155) Google Scholar). Because of its critical role in DNA damage response signaling and maintenance of genomic integrity, as well as the highly tumor-prone nature of both humans and mice with germ line disruption of the ATM gene (2Xu Y. Ashley T. Brainerd E.E. Bronson R.T. Meyn M.S. Baltimore D.

Although germ line loss of ATM principally results in tumors of hematolological origin (lymphoma and leukemia) (4Taylor A.M. Metcalfe J.A. Thick J. Mak Y.F. Leukemia and lymphoma in ataxia telangiectasia.Blood. 1996; 87: 423-438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), multiple studies have confirmed that female ATM heterozygotes possess an elevated breast cancer risk (5Renwick A.

Presently, it remains unresolved which facet(s) of ATM function are critical in breast cancer suppression. ATM has been shown to respond to other forms of cellular stress such as redox imbalance (8Guo Z. Kozlov S. Lavin M.F. Person M.D. Paull T.T. ATM activation by oxidative stress.Science. 2010; 330: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar) and hypoxic stress. Several studies documented that, in response to culture under low oxygen conditions, cells activate ATM-dependent signal transduction, resulting in activation of the kinase Chk2 (9Gibson S.L. Bindra R.S. Glazer P.M.

More recently, ATM has been mechanistically linked to hypoxic response by directly phosphorylating the HIF1α protein (11Cam H. Easton J.B. High A. Houghton P.J. mTORC1 signaling under hypoxic conditions is controlled by ATM-dependent phosphorylation of HIF-1α.Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 509-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), a subunit of the HIF1 transcriptional complex required to transactivate a spectrum of genes important in response to low oxygen conditions (12Semenza G.L. Defining the role of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 in cancer biology and therapeutics.Oncogene. 2010; 29: 625-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). Although evidence indicates that ATM is activated during hypoxic response through a mechanism independent from the mechanism that controls ATM activity in response to DNA DSBs (13Bencokova Z. Kaufmann M.R. Pires I.M. Lecane P.S. Giaccia A.J. Hammond E.M. ATM activation and signaling under hypoxic conditions.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 526-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), the impact of ATM-dependent signal transduction during response to this particular form of cellular stress remains unclear. This last point is also potentially paradoxical because hypoxic response, and activation of HIF1 in particular, is widely viewed as principally oncogenic in nature (12Semenza G.L. Defining the role of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 in cancer biology and therapeutics.Oncogene. 2010; 29: 625-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar, 14Chan D.A. Giaccia A.J.

TRIM29, a member of the TRIM family of proteins (16Hatakeyama S. TRIM proteins and cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2011; 11: 792-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar), has proven to be an enigmatic protein in regards to its function in differing cancer types. Examination of TRIM29 expression in various tumor types has uncovered that increased expression of TRIM29 is associated with more aggressive forms of disease including bladder (17Fristrup N.

In pancreatic cancer cells, investigators found that overexpression of TRIM29 promoted cell growth in vitro and metastatic activity in vivo (23Wang L. Heidt D.G. Lee C.J. Yang H. Logsdon C.D. Zhang L. Fearon E.R. Ljungman M. Simeone D.M. Oncogenic function of ATDC in pancreatic cancer through Wnt pathway activation and β-catenin stabilization.Cancer Cell. 2009; 15: 207-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). This property of TRIM29 stems from its ability to stimulate Wnt/β-catenin/TCF signaling by binding to Dvl-2, a Wnt activator downstream of the Frizzled receptor. More recently, TRIM29 was found to bind to many molecular components of DNA damage response and to act as an important factor in response to genotoxic stress (24Masuda Y. Takahashi H. Sato S. Tomomori-Sato C. Saraf A. Washburn M.P. Florens L. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Hatakeyama S. TRIM29 regulates the assembly of DNA repair proteins into damaged chromatin.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 7299Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In breast cancer, a clearly contrasting view as to how TRIM29 impacts oncogenesis has emerged. The first report on this subject showed that TRIM29 was not commonly expressed in a small panel of breast cancer lines and that expression of recombinant TRIM29 in the breast cancer line BT-549 resulted in reduced growth and colony forming ability in soft agar (25Hosoi Y. Kapp L.N. Murnane J.P. Matsumoto Y. Enomoto A. Ono T. Miyagawa K. Suppression of anchorage-independent growth by expression of the ataxia-telangiectasia group D complementing gene, ATDC.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 348: 728-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Later, Liu et al. (26Liu J. Welm B. Boucher K.M. Ebbert M.T. Bernard P.S. TRIM29 functions as a tumor suppressor in nontumorigenic breast cells and invasive ER+ breast cancer.Am. J. Pathol. 2012; 180: 839-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) observed that knockdown of TRIM29 in the non-tumorigenic MCF-10A line resulted in an increased growth rate and anchorage-independent growth, increased cell motility and invasiveness, and disrupted three-dimensional acinar formation in vitro. In the MCF7 tumor line, which expresses low levels of TRIM29, expression of recombinant human TRIM29 had the opposite effect, namely, a slowing of growth and reduction in anchorage-independent growth. These findings led this group to conclude that TRIM29 was functioning in a growth suppressive role in MCF7 and MCF-10A cells, although the underlying mechanism(s) for this effect were not reported. Our group (27Ai L. Kim W.J. Alpay M. Tang M. Pardo C.E. Hatakeyama S. May W.S. Kladde M.P. Heldermon C.D. Siegel E.M. Brown K.D. TRIM29 suppresses TWIST1 and invasive breast cancer behavior.Cancer Res. 2014; 74: 4875-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) showed that TRIM29 knockdown in breast cancer and non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial lines resulted in increased cell motility, invasiveness, and altered gene expression patterns consistent with activation of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition. The molecular basis for this effect appears to be due, at least in part, to a mutually antagonistic relationship that TRIM29 has with the oncogenic transcription factor TWIST1 (27Ai L. Kim W.J. Alpay M. Tang M. Pardo C.E. Hatakeyama S. May W.S. Kladde M.P. Heldermon C.D. Siegel E.M. Brown K.D. TRIM29 suppresses TWIST1 and invasive breast cancer behavior.Cancer Res. 2014; 74: 4875-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We now show that TRIM29 expression is induced by hypoxia in an ATM and HIF1α-dependent manner and that TRIM29 is necessary to block hypoxia-inducible TWIST1 expression. We initially uncovered the TRIM29 gene in an expression microarray screen for genes that were down-regulated in breast cancer lines with knocked down (RNAi) ATM expression. To confirm these findings, we knocked down ATM in two breast cancer cell lines that express TRIM29 (SKBr3 and MDA-MB-468) and an immortalized human mammary epithelial cell line (HMEC). As judged by RT-PCR on total RNA harvested from these lines transduced with control lentivirus or virus encoding two independent ATM-specific shRNA constructs (clones shATM-1 and shATM-2), diminished ATM expression resulted in a sharp drop in TRIM29 transcript abundance (Fig. 1A). Consistent with the established role that TRIM29 plays in restricting TWIST1 expression (27Ai L. Kim W.J. Alpay M. Tang M. Pardo C.E. Hatakeyama S. May W.S. Kladde M.P. Heldermon C.D. Siegel E.M. Brown K.D. TRIM29 suppresses TWIST1 and invasive breast cancer behavior.Cancer Res. 2014; 74: 4875-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we observed in each line that ATM knockdown resulted in increased TWIST1 transcript abundance. When quantitative RT-PCR (Q-PCR) was used to measure relative ATM and TRIM29 transcript abundance in these cells, we scored a >2-fold decrease in both ATM and TRIM29 mRNA in SKBr3, MDA-MB-468, and HMEC cells with ATM knockdown compared with control virus transduced cells. When immunoblotting was used to examine TRIM29 protein expression in these lines, we again observed a clear decrease in TRIM29 in cells with ATM knockdown (Fig. 1C). In contrast, immunoblotting with anti-TWIST1 showed a notable increase in TWIST1 protein in ATM knockdown cells. ATM is critical in the activation of cellular response to DNA DSBs. Because TRIM29 expression is controlled in an ATM-dependent manner, we sought to determine whether genotoxic stress impacts TRIM29 abundance. To test this, we subjected SKBr3, MDA-MB-468, and HMEC cells 10 Gy of γ-radiation, prepared extracts, and immunoblotted with anti-TRIM29 and anti-γH2AX. We observed no change in TRIM29 expression 18 h after γ-radiation exposure (Fig. 1D). In contrast, abundant phosphorylation of the histone variant H2AX (γH2AX) was observable in these extracts consistent with a robust DNA DSB response (32Pilch D.R. Sedelnikova O.A. Redon C. Celeste A. Nussenzweig A. Bonner W.M. Characteristics of gamma-H2AX foci at DNA double-strand breaks sites.Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 81: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). These results indicate that TRIM29 expression is not responsive to DNA damage, consistent with other recent studies (24Masuda Y. Takahashi H. Sato S. Tomomori-Sato C. Saraf A. Washburn M.P. Florens L. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Hatakeyama S. TRIM29 regulates the assembly of DNA repair proteins into damaged chromatin.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 7299Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Bencokova et al. (13Bencokova Z. Kaufmann M.R. Pires I.M. Lecane P.S. Giaccia A.J. Hammond E.M. ATM activation and signaling under hypoxic conditions.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 526-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) observed that ATM is activated in response to hypoxia but that ATM activation under these conditions occurred independent of the MRN complex, a required component for ATM activation in response to DNA DSBs (33Lee J.H. Paull T.T. ATM activation by DNA double-strand breaks through the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex.Science. 2005; 308: 551-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). This led these investigators to conclude that hypoxic stress activates ATM through a mechanism independent from that governing ATM activation in response to genotoxic stress. To test the effects of low oxygen conditions on TRIM29 abundance, we cultured SKBr3, MDA-MB-468, and HMEC cells in a 1.0% O2 atmosphere for 18 h. Subsequently, these cells, as well as those cultured under normoxic conditions were harvested and total RNA isolated. RT-PCR indicated a sharp increase in TRIM29 transcript abundance in cells cultured under hypoxic conditions (Fig. 2A). Consistent with activation of a robust hypoxic response, we observed increased levels of the hypoxia-inducible CAIX transcript. When Q-PCR was used to measure relative transcript abundance, we observed a multi-fold increase in TRIM29 transcript in each cell line cultured under hypoxic conditions (Fig. 2B). Immunoblotting of extracts created from these cells indicated a measurable increase in TRIM29 protein abundance in each line upon culture under low oxygen conditions (Fig. 2C). Again, consistent with hypoxic response in these cells, sharp increases in both HIF1α and CAIX proteins were observed. Following the discovery that TRIM29 expression is up-regulated following hypoxia, we sought to understand the signaling responsible for this response. Hypoxia activates ATM (9Gibson S.L. Bindra R.S. Glazer P.M. Hypoxia-induced phosphorylation of Chk2 in an ataxia telangiectasia mutated-dependent manner.Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10734-10741Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 10Freiberg R.A. Hammond E.M. Dorie M.J. Welford S.M. Giaccia A.J. DNA damage during reoxygenation elicits a Chk2-dependent checkpoint response.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1598-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and more recently it was discovered that ATM directly phosphorylates HIF1α during hypoxic stress response (11Cam H. Easton J.B. High A. Houghton P.J. mTORC1 signaling under hypoxic conditions is controlled by ATM-dependent phosphorylation of HIF-1α.Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 509-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Given these facts, we examined hypoxic response in ATM knockdown SKBr3 and MDA-MB-468 cells. As judged by Q-PCR, we measured ∼4.5-fold increase in TRIM29 mRNA in control SKBr3 cells but no significant increase in TRIM29 transcript in ATM knockdown SKBRr3 cells following hypoxia (Fig. 3A). Similarly, in the MDA-MB-468 line, we measured that ATM knockdown abrogated the ∼3.6-fold increase in TRIM29 mRNA observed in control cells (Fig. 3A). When immunoblotting was used to judge protein abundance in ATM knockdown SKBr3 and MDA-MB-468 lines (Fig. 3B), we observed either abrogated or notably blunted up-regulation of TRIM29 in response to hypoxia. Consistent with previous studies suggesting that phosphorylation of HIF1α by ATM may stabilize HIF1α in response to hypoxia (11Cam H. Easton J.B. High A. Houghton P.J. mTORC1 signaling under hypoxic conditions is controlled by ATM-dependent phosphorylation of HIF-1α.Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 509-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), we also observed either absent or severely limited increases in HIF1α protein in these ATM knockdown lines in response to hypoxia. To assess a role for HIF1α in the hypoxia-induced TRIM29 up-regulation, we knocked down HIF1α in SKBr3 and MDA-MB-468 cells and measured a >3-fold decrease in HIF1α transcript in each line transduced with either of two independent shRNA-encoding lentivirus (Fig. 4A). RT-PCR indicated that knockdown of HIF1α in either SKBr3 or MDA-MB-468 resulted in a coordinate reduction in basal TRIM29 transcript levels (Fig. 4B). When these lines were examined for TRIM29 mRNA abundance in response to hypoxia, Q-PCR indicated a blunted up-regulation of the TRIM29 transcript in HIF1α knockdown lines. Specifically, in this set of experiments, controls showed a 3.6-fold increase in TRIM29 mRNA in SKBr3 and 2.8-fold in MDA-MB-468 in response to hypoxia (Fig. 4C). HIF1α knockdown blunted the hypoxia-induced up-regulation of TRIM29 in SKBr3 (2.1- and 1.7-fold in shHIF1α-2 and shHIF1α-3, respectively) and MDA-MB-468 shHIF1α-3 cells (1.8-fold) where MDA-MB-468 shHIF1α-2 cells showed no significant increase in TRIM29 mRNA in response to hypoxia. Rises in TRIM29 mRNA measured in lines with knocked down HIF1α may be attributable to residual HIF1α expression in these cells or may suggest an additional HIF1α-independent mechanism(s) that drive increased TRIM29 mRNA levels in response to hypoxia. Results obtained by immunoblotting paralleled Q-PCR results showing that HIF1α knockdown reduced the steady-state levels of TRIM29 and blocked the increase in TRIM29 protein in response to hypoxia in both SKBr3 and MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig. 4D). Of note, we have been unable to demonstrate that the TRIM29 gene is directly regulated by HIF1, and therefore, we cannot rule out that this gene is indirectly controlled through another HIF1-dependent mechanism. Under normoxic conditions, prolyl hydroxylases (primarily prolyl hydroxylase 2) use ambient oxygen to hydroxylate proline residues within HIF1α that subsequently promote association with the VHL protein (pVHL) (34Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α is mediated by an O2-dependent degradation domain via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Targeting of HIF-α to the von Hippel-Lindau ubiquitylation complex by O2-regulated prolyl hydroxylation.Science. 2001; 292: 468-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (4442) Google Scholar). pVHL itself is a subunit of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that drives proteosomal degradation resulting in low steady-state levels of HIF1α (36Iwai K.

Identification of the von Hippel-lindau tumor-suppressor protein as part of an active E3 ubiquitin ligase complex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Given this, we knocked down VHL in SKBr3 cells using RNAi to determine whether stabilization HIF1α under normoxic conditions would result in increased TRIM29 abundance. SKBr3 cells transduced with VHL-specific shRNA-encoding lentivirus displayed marked reduction in VHL mRNA abundance as determined by RT-PCR (Fig. 4E), and by Q-PCR we measured ∼3-fold reduced levels of VHL transcript in these cells compared with controls (data not shown). When these cells were immunoblotted, we also observed that the shRNA expression produced a marked reduction in VHL protein abundance in SKBr3 (Fig. 4F). Of note, immunoblotting revealed a detectable increase in HIF1α and TRIM29 in VHL knockdown cells, leading us to conclude that stabilization of the HIF1α under normoxic conditions results in increased TRIM29 abundance. HIF1 activity is primarily controlled post-translationally through the stabilization of the labile HIF1α protein. To test whether nascent transcription or translation is required for the hypoxia inducibility of TRIM29, we treated SKBr3 or MDA-MB-468 cells with either the RNA polymerase II inhibitor actinomycin D or the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide prior to culturing these cells for 18 h under 1% oxygen conditions. We observed that either cycloheximide or actinomycin D ablated the hypoxia-induced up-regulation of TRIM29 in both lines (Fig. 4G). In contrast, actinomycin D had no marked effect on the up-regulation of HIF1α during hypoxic response, but inhibition of nascent protein synthesis by cycloheximide fully ablated HIF1α up-regulation in both SKBr3 and MDA-MB-468 cells. From these experiments we conclude that, unlike HIF1α, the up-regulation of TRIM29 during hypoxic response is principally controlled at the transcriptional level. In addition to observing the effects of ATM or HIF1α knockdown on hypoxia responsiveness of TRIM29, we also observed that knockdown of either of these genes resulted in markedly reduced basal expression of TRIM29 in both SKBr3 and MDA-MB-468 cells. Further, we measured reduced steady-state levels of HIF1α transcript in ATM knockdown SKBr3 and MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig. 5A). Transcription of the HIF1α gene has been demonstrated to be under the control of the NF-κB transcriptional complex (38Belaiba R.S. Bonello S. Zähringer C. Schmidt S. Hess J. Kietzmann T. Görlach A.

Oxidative stress shapes breast cancer phenotype through chronic activation of ATM-dependent signaling.Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2015; 151: 75-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To test a role for NF-κB in supporting basal expression of TRIM29, we knocked down the NF-κB subunit RelA (i.e. p65). Using two independent shRNA constructs in both SKBr3 and MDA-MB-468 cells, RT-PCR indicated not only the predicted decrease in RelA and HIF1α mRNA, but clear diminishment in TRIM29 mRNA as well (Fig. 5B). When this was measured using Q-PCR, we observed significant multi-fold decreases in each transcript following RelA knockdown (Fig. 5C). Similarly, we observed a clear decrease in basal TRIM29 protein abundance in both SKBr3 and MDA-MB-468 cells in response to RelA knockdown (Fig. 5D). These findings clearly indicate that RelA is necessary for the basal expression of TRIM29 in cultured breast cancer lines. To determine whether increased RelA expression is sufficient to drive TRIM29 expression, SKBr3 cells were transduced with adenovirus encoding full-length human RelA (Ad-p65) or a control (Ad-GFP) adenovirus as previously outlined (28Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Analysis of relative gene expression data using real-time quantitative PCR and the 2−ΔΔC(T) method.Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124206) Google Scholar). As judged by RT-PCR, infection of SKBr3 cells with Ad-p65 resulted in a dramatic increase in RelA mRNA abundance, as well as increased abundance of SOD2 mRNA, a known NF-κB target gene (41Pahl H.L. Activators and target genes of Rel/NF-κB transcription factors.Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3445) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5E). In contrast, no increase in either HIF1α or TRIM29 mRNA was observed in SKBr3 infected with Ad-p65. Q-PCR indicated that infection of cells with Ad-GFP did not significantly alter the transcript abundance of HIF1α, TRIM29, or SOD2 when compared with uninfected cells. We observed a slight rise in both TRIM29 and HIF1α mRNA levels after Ad-p65 infection, but these increases failed to reach statistical significance when compared cells infected with Ad-GFP."

However, the signaling pathway(s) utilized by insulin to directly modulate β-cells is unclear.

Although these observations are consistent with a role for insulin in the regulation of β-cell biology (reviewed in Ref. 3Goldfine A.B. Kulkarni R.N. Modulation of β-cell function: a translational journey from the bench to the bedside.Diabetes Obes. Metab. 2012; 14: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), it is still unclear how physiological changes in the levels of circulating (systemic) insulin directly impact downstream insulin signaling proteins in vivo. This lack of clarity is, in part, related to the difficulty in interpreting data on potential independent effects of exogenous insulin versus endogenous insulin on β-cell biology in cultured β-cells and/or isolated islets due to continuous secretion of the hormone via the regulated and/or constitutive pathways. Furthermore, the lack of a suitable model precludes accurate estimates of local concentrations of insulin in close proximity to β-cells to assess its effects in the islet in a living organism. Whereas we and others have focused efforts to investigate the relevance of exogenous insulin on β-cell secretion in humans (10Halperin F. Lopez X. Manning R. Kahn C.R. Kulkarni R.N. Goldfine A.B.

To reverse this state of ignorance we designed two independent experiments to simulate physiological states, in order to specifically examine the signaling effects of exogenous versus endogenous insulin on β-cells in vivo in mice: 1) a glucose gavage to simulate a physiological example of glucose-induced endogenous insulin secretion, and 2) a hyperinsulinemic i.v. infusion to examine the endocrine effects of mildly elevated circulating insulin on β-cells. Both protocols were performed in control mice and compared with mice lacking insulin receptors in β-cells (βIRKO) to dissect the role of the insulin receptor-mediated pathway in the regulation of downstream proteins. We report that, in the models we used, insulin acts in an endocrine manner to modulate β-cell signaling proteins in vivo in the normal state. Our results also indicate that, in β-cells lacking insulin receptors, insulin and glucose minimally activate the Akt pathway in β-cells, while ERK phosphorylation and nuclear export of FoxO1 occur independent of insulin signaling. We first investigated the effects of a physiological stimulus by a glucose gavage (Fig. 1A). Fasting glucose and insulin concentrations at time 0, as well as glycemia and insulin levels achieved 15 min after the gavages were comparable in control and βIRKO mice (Fig. 1, B and C). As expected, glucose levels were significantly increased in the glucose gavage groups compared with respective controls receiving saline gavage (p < 0.01 for both groups versus respective controls; Fig. 1B). Similarly, circulating insulin levels were elevated, and in the upper physiological range (13Goren H.J. Kulkarni R.N. Kahn C.R.

To examine the effects of secreted insulin on the insulin signaling pathway in β-cells, we used immunohistochemistry to analyze pancreas sections collected immediately after the end of the glucose or saline gavage. The % of β-cells that were positive for pAKT in the basal state were significantly lower in the βIRKOs compared with controls (p < 0.01, Fig. 2, A and B). We observed an increased % of β-cells that co-immunostained for pAKT in control mice after glucose gavage compared with controls with a saline gavage (p = 0.03, Fig. 2, A and B); in contrast to lack of significant changes in the βIRKOs (p = 0.30, Fig. 2, A and B). Similarly, there was an increased % of β-cells that co-immunostained for p-p70S6K in control mice that underwent glucose gavage compared with controls (p = 0.04, Fig. 2, C and D), while no changes were detected in % of β-cells that co-immunostained for p-p70S6K in βIRKO mice (p = 0.364, Fig. 2, C and D). Interestingly, the % of β-cells that co-immunostained for pERK was enhanced in both control and βIRKO mice that underwent glucose gavage compared with saline-gavaged controls (p = 0.04 and p = 0.02 respectively, Fig. 3, A and B). Consistently, we observed increased nuclear export of FoxO1 in both control and βIRKO mice that underwent glucose gavage compared with their respective controls, although the magnitude of change was much lower in the βIRKOs (p < 0.01 for both comparisons, Fig. 3, C and D).FIGURE 3.Alterations pERK and nuclear versus cytosolic localization of FoxO1 in control or βIRKO mice following saline or glucose gavage.

Fasting glucose and insulin concentrations, as well as glycemia and insulin levels achieved 15 min after saline or insulin infusion, were comparable in the two groups (time 0, Fig. 4, B and C). As expected, glucose levels were decreased in insulin infusion groups compared with those undergoing saline infusions (time 15, p < 0.05 for both groups versus respective controls; Fig. 4B). Furthermore, circulating insulin levels were significantly raised after insulin infusion compared with saline infusion in both control and βIRKO groups (p < 0.01 for both groups versus respective control; Fig. 4C). To examine whether exogenous insulin modulates the insulin signaling pathway of β-cells in an endocrine manner, we undertook immunohistochemistry of sections of pancreas harvested immediately after the end of the saline or insulin infusions. Similar to our observations in the gavage studies the % β-cells that were positive for pAKT in the basal state were significantly lower in the βIRKOs (p < 0.001, Fig. 5, A and B). The number of β-cells that co-immunostained for pAKT in control mice that underwent insulin infusion was significantly higher compared with those undergoing saline infusion (p = 0.03, Fig. 5, A and B), while no significant differences were evident between the two treatments in the βIRKO group (p = 0.30, Fig. 5, A and B). Control mice that underwent an insulin infusion showed increased % of β-cells that co-immunostained for p-p70S6K (p = 0.04, Fig. 5, C and D), compared with a lack of significant change in βIRKOs (p = 0.364, Fig. 5, C and D). Both control and βIRKO groups exhibited an increase in β-cells that co-immunostained for pERK after the insulin infusion (p = 0.04 and p = 0.02, respectively, Fig. 6, A and B), and the magnitude of change was somewhat greater in the βIRKOs.FIGURE 6.Alterations in pERK and localization of FoxO1 in control or βIRKO mice following saline or insulin infusion.

To examine the independent effects of hyperglycemia versus insulin signaling directly on the localization of FoxO1, we stimulated control or βIRKO β-cell lines either with glucose or exogenous insulin. After starvation, βIRKO cells demonstrated a trend toward reduced proportion of nuclear FoxO1 compared with control cells in the basal unstimulated condition (vehicle, Fig. 7, A and B). This difference reached statistical significance between groups in the presence of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (p = 0.03, LY294002, Fig. 7, A and B). Stimulation with 22.2 mm glucose for 30 min led to FoxO1 exclusion from the nucleus in βIRKO cells, but showed little effect in control cells (p < 0.01, High Glucose in Fig. 7, A and B). In contrast, and as expected, insulin (10 nm) stimulation for 30 min exported FoxO1 from the nucleus into the cytosol in controls, but had virtually no effect in β-cells lacking insulin receptors (βIRKO) (p < 0.01, Insulin, Fig. 7, A and B). These results indicate that glucose stimulation is sufficient to exclude FoxO1 from the nucleus in insulin receptor-deficient β-cells, while an insulin-mediated signal is necessary for a similar effect of glucose in controls. It is also possible that in this in vitro cell culture model the secreted insulin accumulated in the media acts via IGF-1 receptors to activate downstream signaling proteins that are common to the two ligands. To assess the involvement of insulin receptor-mediated signals in the regulation of FoxO1 localization in βIRKO cells, we next examined the effects of multiple inhibitors individually including: 1) the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002; 2) the insulin/IGF-1 receptor dual inhibitor, OSI-906; 3), the Akt1/2 inhibitor, MK-2206; or 4) the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126, on nuclear export of FoxO1 induced by a combination of glucose and insulin stimulation. The combination of glucose (22.2 mm) and insulin (10 nm) stimulation significantly reduced the proportion of nuclear FoxO1 in both control and βIRKO β-cells (Fig. 8, A and B). While the % of cells with nuclear FoxO1 localization was elevated in both groups the change was lower in βIRKO β-cells as compared with control β-cells treated with the PI3K inhibitor (LY294002), the dual insulin/IGF-1 receptor inhibitor (OSI-906), or its downstream Akt inhibitor (MK-2206), respectively (Fig. 8, A and B, LY294002, OSI-906, MK-2206). However, blocking ERK1/2 signaling with a Mek1/2 inhibitor (U0126) had virtually no effect on FoxO1 nuclear export in control β-cells (compared with vehicle), in contrast to significantly attenuated FoxO1-nuclear export in βIRKO cells (p < 0.01, U0126, Fig. 8, A and B). These data suggest that ERK-mediated FoxO1 nuclear export occurs partly independent of insulin signaling in βIRKO β-cells. We confirmed the phosphorylation state of Akt and ERK in the presence of inhibitors described above. Stimulation of the cells with glucose or insulin promoted phosphorylation of Akt in both control and βIRKO cells, with the latter exhibiting reduced Akt phosphorylation both before and after stimulation (Fig. 8C and supplemental Fig. S1). This Akt phosphorylation was blunted when the stimulation with both glucose and insulin was performed independently in the presence of the PI3K inhibitor, the dual insulin/IGF-1 receptor inhibitor, or the Akt inhibitor, but not the MEK1/2 inhibitor. ERK was activated in the basal state in βIRKO cells, while the increase in the ratio of ERK phosphorylation to total ERK level was smaller in βIRKO cells (Fig. 8C and supplemental Fig. S1). The presence of the MEK1/2 inhibitor completely blocked ERK phosphorylation when the cells were stimulated with glucose and insulin in both control and βIRKO cells (Fig. 8C and supplemental Fig. S1). To investigate the roles of insulin receptor and IGF-1 receptor-mediated signaling in FoxO1 localization in control and βIRKO cells, we used the dual insulin/IGF-1 receptor inhibitor (OSI-906). The presence of the dual inhibitor led to nuclear accumulation of FoxO1 after stimulation with insulin or glucose in control cells (Fig. 9, A and B). Notably, FoxO1-nuclear export was significantly reduced by the blockade of both insulin and IGF-1 receptor in βIRKO cells in basal, insulin stimulated, or glucose-stimulated conditions (Fig. 9, A and B). These results suggest that in β-cells lacking insulin receptors the nuclear export of FoxO1 induced by glucose is secondary to IGF-1R-mediated signaling. We validated that the inhibitor, OSI-906, completely blocked phosphorylation of insulin and IGF-1 receptor evoked by insulin or glucose stimulation in both control and βIRKO cells (Fig. 9C and supplemental Fig. S2). Phosphorylation of Akt and ERK were also attenuated by the simultaneous inhibition of insulin and IGF-1 receptors in control cells. In βIRKO cells, treatment with OSI-906 significantly reduced phosphorylation levels of ERK in the basal state as well as stimulated conditions (Fig. 9C and supplemental Fig. S2). Together, these data indicate that in addition to the effects of insulin receptor activation, IGF-1 receptor-mediated signaling, contributes to ERK phosphorylation and FoxO1 localization in β-cells. In this study, we designed in vivo experiments to directly investigate the ability of insulin to modulate proteins in the growth factor (insulin/IGF-1) signaling pathway in β-cells. We report that signaling proteins downstream of the insulin/IGF-1 receptors are activated by circulating insulin levels and support a potential endocrine role for the hormone in regulating β-cell biology. We also observed that β-cells in mice with conditional disruption of functional insulin receptors (e.g. βIRKO) exhibit minimal activation of AKT pathways in response to glucose or insulin stimulation, in contrast to ERK and FoxO1 proteins, which were phosphorylated independently of insulin receptor signaling. The effects of glucose and insulin to regulate signaling proteins to regulate β-cell secretion and/or proliferation continues to be a significant area of research because of the technical difficulties in evaluating the direct effects of ambient insulin in a cell type that also secretes the hormone. While we and several other investigators have developed in vitro models (15Assmann A. Ueki K. Winnay J.N. Kadowaki T. Kulkarni R.N.

This is in contrast to signaling effects easily discernible in homogeneous tissues such as skeletal muscle, liver, or adipose each of which can be rapidly isolated (minutes) after injection of stimuli in vivo. Studies in cultured islets are also not entirely physiological because they do not maintain their normal anatomical blood supply. Using an in vivo glucose infusion model, Alonso et al. (17Stamateris R.E. Sharma R.B. Kong Y. Ebrahimpour P. Panday D. Ranganath P. Zou B. Levitt H. Parambil N.A. O'Donnell C.P. Garcia-Ocana A. Alonso L.C. Glucose induces mouse beta cell proliferation via IRS2, mTOR and cyclin D2 but not the insulin receptor.Diabetes. 2016; 65: 981-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) recently reported that, surprisingly, the effects of glucose on β-cell proliferation do not require the insulin receptor. In contrast, Martinez et al. (18Martinez S.C. Cras-Méneur C. Bernal-Mizrachi E. Permutt M.A. Glucose regulates Foxo1 through insulin receptor signaling in the pancreatic islet beta-cell.Diabetes. 2006; 55: 1581-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), also using a knockdown (80% decrease in insulin receptors) approach, reported that glucose effects on β-cells are mediated primarily through insulin acting upon its own receptor. Our own studies, using a β-cell line with a knock-out of the insulin receptor, clearly indicate that glucose effects on signaling proteins in β-cells require functional insulin receptors (15Assmann A. Ueki K. Winnay J.N. Kadowaki T. Kulkarni R.N. Glucose effects on beta-cell growth and survival require activation of insulin receptors and insulin receptor substrate 2.Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 29: 3219-3228Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In addition to the limitations of using isolated islets/cell lines discussed above an additional confounding factor contributing to the divergent conclusions of the different studies could be because Alonso and colleagues used β-cells with an incomplete (50%) knockdown of the insulin receptor in contrast to a “knock-out” model used in our studies and a higher KD (80%) in the studies by Martinez et al. To clarify these issues, we carefully designed experiments in this study to capture the alterations in signaling proteins in β-cells in response to changes in circulating levels of glucose and/or insulin in vivo by harvesting the pancreas immediately after ending the stimulus for immunohistochemical analyses. To evaluate insulin effects in vivo, we used glucose gavage as a physiological stimulus to increase insulin secretion. After gavage, both groups of animals showed a significant increase in blood glucose levels (16.6–19.4 mmol/liter) and circulating levels of insulin, albeit, elevated to a relatively physiological range (∼0.17 nmol/liter). In controls, the enhanced phosphorylation of Akt, ERK and p70S6K and nuclear exclusion of FoxO1 could be ascribed to the combined effects of elevated glucose and insulin. In the βIRKOs, the lack of phosphorylation of Akt and p70S6K suggests that the effects in the controls are solely due to glucose, and are dependent on insulin and not IGF-1 receptors. In the basal state, however, the increase in phosphorylation of p70S6K in the βIRKO islets may reflect altered mTORC1 activity due to changes in protein translation (19Liew C.W. Assmann A.

On the other hand, a persistent phosphorylation of ERK, and a small but significant effect on nuclear exclusion of FoxO1 even in mice lacking insulin receptors in β-cells indicate that these effects of glucose in the βIRKOs occur independent"

https://openalex.org/W2509124953,"NuA4 is the only essential lysine acetyltransferase complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where it has been shown to stimulate transcription initiation and elongation. Interaction with nucleosomes is stimulated by histone H3 Lys-4 and Lys-36 methylation, but the mechanism of this interaction is unknown. Eaf3, Eaf5, and Eaf7 form a subcomplex within NuA4 that may also function independently of the lysine acetyltransferase complex. The Eaf3/5/7 complex and the Rpd3C(S) histone deacetylase complex have both been shown to bind di- and trimethylated histone H3 Lys-36 stimulated by Eaf3. We investigated the role of the Eaf3/5/7 subcomplex in NuA4 binding to nucleosomes. Different phenotypes of eaf3/5/7Δ mutants support functions for the complex as both part of and independent of NuA4. Further evidence for Eaf3/5/7 within NuA4 came from mutations in the subcomplex leading to ∼40% reductions in H4 acetylation in bulk histones, probably caused by binding defects to both nucleosomes and RNA polymerase II. In vitro binding assays showed that Eaf3/5/7 specifically stimulates NuA4 binding to di- and trimethylated histone H3 Lys-36 and that this binding is important for NuA4 occupancy in transcribed ORFs. Consistent with the role of NuA4 in stimulating transcription elongation, loss of EAF5 or EAF7 resulted in a processivity defect. Overall, these results reveal the function of Eaf3/5/7 within NuA4 to be important for both NuA4 and RNA polymerase II binding."

For this, an appropriate, reliable animal model is essential to gain insight into mechanisms of tumor growth for use in response monitoring of (new) agents. Several animal models have been described in previous studies, but so far success has been hampered due to the absence of imaging methods to follow tumor growth non-invasively over time. Recent developments of multimodal imaging methods for use in animal research have substantially strengthened these options of in vivo visualization of tumor growth. In the present study, a multimodal imaging approach was addressed to investigate bladder tumor proliferation longitudinally. The complementary abilities of Bioluminescence, High Resolution Ultrasound and Photo-acoustic Imaging permit a better understanding of bladder tumor development. Hybrid imaging modalities allow the integration of individual strengths to enable sensitive and improved quantification and understanding of tumor biology, and ultimately, can aid in the discovery and development of new therapeutics."

To determine what hospital-associated factors drove the outbreak of this particular strain we performed a case-control study.Cases (n = 79), diagnosed with CDI due to C. difficile ribotype 027 were matched for age and treating medical specialty to four control patients (n = 316). Patients diagnosed with CDI due to other ribotypes were included as a second control group. A random selection of C. difficile ribotype 027 strains (n = 10) was genotyped by Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS).WGS showed the outbreak was likely caused by a single strain of C. difficile (two or less single-nucleotide variants between isolates). Ninety-five percent of cases had used antibiotics, compared to 56% of controls. Previous admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) (OR: 2.4, 95% CI 1.0-5.6), longer length of stay (LOS), and recent hospital admission were associated with CDI ribotype 027. Cases were less likely to have been admitted to a ward with a known isolated CDI patient (OR: 0.2, 95% CI 0.1-0.6). Analysis of patients who stayed at the ICU (35 cases; 51 controls), indicated that the use of selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD) and a longer LOS in the ICU were associated with CDI risk.In this large outbreak, any antibiotic use, including SDD use, appeared as a prerequisite for acquisition of the outbreak strain. The role of use of SDD and prolonged stay on the ICU could not be disentangled, but both factors can play a biologically plausible role in C. difficile acquisition and infection."

To identify α-null-related transcriptional changes, the gene expressions of cgy-2-NIL and its recurrent parent DN47 were compared using Illumina high-throughput RNA-sequencing of samples at 25, 35, 50, and 55 days after flowering (DAF). Seeds at 18 DAF served as the control. Comparison of the transcript profiles identified 3,543 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two genotypes, with 2,193 genes downregulated and 1,350 genes upregulated. The largest numbers of DEGs were identified at 55 DAF. The DEGs identified at 25 DAF represented a unique pattern of GO category distributions. KEGG pathway analyses identified 541 altered metabolic pathways in cgy-2-NIL. At 18DAF, 12 DEGs were involved in arginine and proline metabolism. The cgy-2 allele in the homozygous form modified the expression of several Cupin allergen genes.

https://openalex.org/W2513081868,"Our previous studies show reduced abundance of the β-subunit of mitochondrial H+-ATP synthase (β-F1-ATPase) in skeletal muscle of obese individuals. The β-F1-ATPase forms the catalytic core of the ATP synthase, and it is critical for ATP production in muscle. The mechanism(s) impairing β-F1-ATPase metabolism in obesity, however, are not completely understood. First, we studied total muscle protein synthesis and the translation efficiency of β-F1-ATPase in obese (BMI, 36±1 kg/m2) and lean (BMI, 22±1 kg/m2) subjects. Both total protein synthesis (0.044±0.006 vs 0.066±0.006%·h-1) and translation efficiency of β-F1-ATPase (0.0031±0.0007 vs 0.0073±0.0004) were lower in muscle from the obese subjects when compared to the lean controls (P<0.05). We then evaluated these same responses in a primary cell culture model, and tested the specific hypothesis that circulating non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) in obesity play a role in the responses observed in humans. The findings on total protein synthesis and translation efficiency of β-F1-ATPase in primary myotubes cultured from a lean subject, and after exposure to NEFA extracted from serum of an obese subject, were similar to those obtained in humans. Among candidate microRNAs (i.e., non-coding RNAs regulating gene expression), we identified miR-127-5p in preventing the production of β-F1-ATPase. Muscle expression of miR-127-5p negatively correlated with β-F1-ATPase protein translation efficiency in humans (r = – 0.6744; P<0.01), and could be modeled in vitro by prolonged exposure of primary myotubes derived from the lean subject to NEFA extracted from the obese subject. On the other hand, locked nucleic acid inhibitor synthesized to target miR-127-5p significantly increased β-F1-ATPase translation efficiency in myotubes (0.6±0.1 vs 1.3±0.3, in control vs exposure to 50 nM inhibitor; P<0.05). Our experiments implicate circulating NEFA in obesity in suppressing muscle protein metabolism, and establish impaired β-F1-ATPase translation as an important consequence of obesity."

This was undertaken in the context of continuous child health promotion activities conducted by government and non-government organizations throughout Kenya. It was the aim of such activities to increase the prevalence of health promoting childcare practices; to what extent have there been changes in optimal childcare practices in Kenya during the 11-year period under study? Methods Cross-sectional data were obtained from the Kenya Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in 2003, 2008–9 and 2014. Women 15–49 years old with children 0–59 months were interviewed about a range of childcare practices. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine changes in, and correlates of, optimal childcare practices using the 2003, 2008–9 and 2014 data. Samples of 5949, 6079 and 20964 women interviewed in 2003, 2008–9 and 2014 respectively were used in the analysis. Results Between 2003 and 2014, there were increases in all health facility-based childcare practices with major increases observed in seeking medical treatment for diarrhoea and complete child vaccination. Mixed results were observed in home-based care where increases were noted in the use of insecticide treated bed nets, sanitary stool disposal and use of oral rehydration solutions, while decreases were observed in the prevalence of urging more fluid/food during diarrhoea and consumption of a minimum acceptable diet. Logit models showed that area of residence (region), household wealth, maternal education, parity, mother's age, child’s age and pregnancy history were significant determinants of optimal childcare practices across the three surveys. Conclusions The study observed variation in the uptake of the recommended optimal childcare practices in Kenya. National, regional and local child health promotion activities, coupled with changes in society and in living conditions between 2003 and 2014, could have influenced uptake of certain recommended childcare practices in Kenya. Decreases in the prevalence of children who were offered same/more fluid/food when they had diarrhea and children who consumed the minimum acceptable diet is alarming and perhaps a red flag to stakeholders who may have focused more on health facility-based care at the expense of home-based care. Concerted efforts are needed to address the consistent inequities in the uptake of the recommended childcare practices. Such efforts should be cognizant of the underlying factors that affect childcare in Kenya, herein defined as region, household wealth, maternal education, parity, mother's age, child’s age and pregnancy history."

Patients were traced back to determine the presence of premotor symptoms, including rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD), depression, and constipation. Cox's regression analysis was used to detect the risks between the occurrence of premotor symptoms and the outcome (including death, psychosis, accidental injury, dementia and aspiration pneumonia). In addition, the association between premotor symptoms and levodopa equivalent dosage (LED) was examined.Higher occurrence of death, dementia and aspiration pneumonia were identified in PD patients with premotor symptoms than without premotor symptoms (HR 1·69, 95% CI 1·34-2·14, p <0·001 for death; HR 1·63, 95% CI 1·20-2·22, p = 0·002 for dementia; HR 2·45, 95% CI 1·42-4·21, p = 0·001 for aspiration pneumonia). In a comorbidities-stratified analysis, PD patients with premotor symptoms showed significantly high risks of mortality and morbidity (dementia and aspiration pneumonia), especially in the absence of comorbidities. Independent predictors of mortality in PD were found to be higher age, male sex, constipation, RBD, RBD with constipation and depression, and diabetes. Furthermore, no significant differences of LED and subsequent accidental injury were noted between PD patient with or without premotor symptoms.Premotor symptoms seem to be not merely risk factors, but also prognostic factors of PD."
https://openalex.org/W2510580618,"In the past decades, the sex pheromone composition in female moths has been analyzed by different methods, ranging from volatile collections to gland extractions, which all have some disadvantage: volatile collections can generally only be conducted on (small) groups of females to detect the minor pheromone compounds, whereas gland extractions are destructive. Direct-contact SPME overcomes some of these disadvantages, but is expensive, the SPME fiber coating can be damaged due to repeated usage, and samples need to be analyzed relatively quickly after sampling. In this study, we assessed the suitability of cheap and disposable fused silica optical fibers coated with 100 μm polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) by sampling the pheromone of two noctuid moths, Heliothis virescens and Heliothis subflexa. By rubbing the disposable PDMS fibers over the pheromone glands of females that had called for at least 15 minutes and subsequently extracting the PDMS fibers in hexane, we collected all known pheromone compounds, and we found a strong positive correlation for most pheromone compounds between the disposable PDMS fiber rubs and the corresponding gland extracts of the same females. When comparing this method to volatile collections and the corresponding gland extracts, we generally found comparable percentages between the three techniques, with some differences that likely stem from the chemical properties of the individual pheromone compounds. Hexane extraction of cheap, disposable, PDMS coated fused silica optical fibers allows for sampling large quantities of individual females in a short time, eliminates the need for immediate sample analysis, and enables to use the same sample for multiple chemical analyses."

https://openalex.org/W2508045067,"String-pulling is one of the most popular tests in animal cognition because of its apparent complexity, and of its potential to be applied to very different taxa. In birds, the basic procedure involves a food reward, suspended from a perch by a string, which can be reached by a series of coordinated pulling actions with the beak and holding actions of the pulled lengths of string with the foot. The taxonomic distribution of species that pass the test includes several corvids, parrots and parids, but in other families, data are much spottier and the number of individuals per species that succeed is often low. To date, the association between string-pulling ability and other cognitive traits was never tested. It is generally assumed that string-pulling is a complex form of problem-solving, suggesting that performance on string-pulling and other problem-solving tasks should be correlated. Here, we show that individuals of two innovative species from Barbados, the bullfinch Loxigilla barbadensis and the Carib grackle Quiscalus lugubris fortirostris, pass the string-pulling test. Eighteen of the 42 bullfinches tested succeeded, allowing us to correlate performance on this test to that on several other behavioral measurements. Surprisingly, string-pulling in bullfinches was unrelated to shyness, neophobia, problem-solving, discrimination and reversal learning performance. Only two of 31 grackles tested succeeded, precluding correlational analyses with other measures but still, the two successful birds largely differed in their other behavioral traits."

We further confirmed that IL1R1, BCAR3, KCNH2, PIR, and ZDHHC23 were differentially expressed in a larger cohort of ETV6-RUNX1-negative BP-ALL patient samples. Statistical analysis demonstrated that expression levels of these genes could accurately categorize high and low WBC count subjects using two independent patient sets, representing positive and negative ETV6-RUNX1 cases.

Development of the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) nature reserve network in China was initiated in the 1960s, though the effort to create new reserves boomed considerably after the year 2000. Given this rapid development of protected areas in panda habitats, and the potential conflicting interests between conservation administrations and local economic development, it is essential to assess the role of new nature reserves in the overall giant panda conservation effort and reserve network. We utilized data from national giant panda surveys conducted in 2000 and 2012 to compare the size, spatial use, and distribution of panda populations, as well as the habitat suitability and connectivity in the Northern Qionglai Mountains between the two survey years. Our results show that although the total giant panda population in the study area did not change remarkably, local changes did occur. Most notably, the population in Wolong Nature Reserve declined by 27.3% (N = 39) and the population in Caopo Nature Reserve increased by 71.4% (N = 29) over the 12-year study period. We also found habitat suitability and availability decreased in both Wolong (12.4%) and Caopo (7.4%), but that the relative density of giant pandas declined (19.2%) and increased (84.6%) at each site, respectively. The distance between centers of high IUA were more distant in 2012 (14.1±1.9km) than that in 2000 (6.1±0.9km; t = -7.4, df = 5, p = 0.001), showing a scattered spatial pattern. Habitat availability decreased by 42% within the corridor between the two reserves, however panda occurrences in the corridor increased 24.6%. Compared to the total number of encounters, the proportion of the corridor increased 45.76%. Our results show the importance and success of the newly established Caopo to the conservation of giant pandas, and how crucial it is to identify and repair reserve corridors. Furthermore, we propose criteria for future nature reserve network management and investment, which is applicable for other endangered species conservation practices."

These animals are used in preclinical studies for a variety of human diseases such as infections with nematodes, bacteria and papillomaviruses, especially regarding cutaneous manifestations such as non-melanoma skin cancer. Here we characterize the cells in terms of their origin and cytogenetic features. Searching for genomic signatures, a spontaneous mutation in the splicing donor sequence of Trp53 (G to A transition at the first position of intron 7) could be detected. This point mutation leads to alternative splicing and to a premature stop codon, resulting in a truncated and, in turn, undetectable form of p53, probably contributing to the process of immortalization. Mastomys coucha-derived skin keratinocytes can be used as an in vitro system to investigate molecular and immunological aspects of infectious agent interactions with their host cells."
https://openalex.org/W2512170746,"Alveolar bone loss is a result of an aggressive form of periodontal disease (PD) associated with Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) infection. PD is often observed with other systemic inflammatory conditions, including arthritis. Melanocortin peptides activate specific receptors to exert antiarthritic properties, avoiding excessing inflammation and modulating macrophage function. Recent work has indicated that melanocortin can control osteoclast development and function, butwhether such protection takes place in infection-induced alveolar bone loss has not been investigated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of melanocortin in Aainduced PD. Mice were orally infected with Aa and treated with the melanocortin analog DTrp8-γMSH or vehicle daily for 30 d. Then, periodontal tissue was collected and analyzed. Aα-infected mice treated with DTrp8-γMSH presented decreased alveolar bone loss and a lower degree of neutrophil infiltration in the periodontium than vehicle-treated animals; these actions were associated with reduced periodontal levels of TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-17A. In vitro experiments with cells differentiated into osteoclasts showed that osteoclast formation and resorptive activity were attenuated after treatment with DTrp8-γMSH. Thus, melanocortin agonism could represent an innovative way to tame over exuberant inflammation and, at the same time, preserve bone physiology, as seen after Aa infection.—Madeira, M. F.

Early health problems as determinants of disability retirement have received little attention. The objective was to study, whether interrupting compulsory military service is an early indicator of disability retirement among Finnish men and whether seeking medical advice during military service increases the risk of all-cause disability retirement and disability retirement due to mental disorders and musculoskeletal diseases. We also looked at secular trends in these associations. We examined a nationally representative sample of 2069 men, who had entered military service during 1967-1996. We linked military service health records with cause-specific register data on disability retirement from 1968 to 2008. Secular trends were explored in three service time strata. We used the Cox regression model to estimate proportional hazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals. During the follow-up time altogether 140 (6.8%) men retired due to disability, mental disorders being the most common cause. The men who interrupted service had a remarkably higher cumulative incidence of disability retirement (18.9%). The associations between seeking medical advice during military service and all-cause disability retirement were similar across the three service time cohorts (overall hazard ratio 1.40 per one standard deviation of the number of visits; 95% confidence interval 1.26-1.56). Visits due to mental problems predicted disability retirement due to mental disorders in the men who served between 1987 and 1996 and a tendency for a similar cause-specific association was seen for musculoskeletal diseases in the men who served in 1967-1976. In conclusion, health problems-in particular mental problems-during late adolescence are strong determinants of disability retirement. Call-up examinations and military service provide access to the entire age cohort of men, where persons at risk for work disability can be identified and early preventive measures initiated."

https://openalex.org/W2518432768,"One of the prevailing applications of machine learning is the use of predictive modelling in clinical survival analysis. In this work, we present our view of the current situation of computer tools for survival analysis, stressing the need of transferring the latest results in the field of machine learning to biomedical researchers. We propose a web based software for survival analysis called OSA (Online Survival Analysis), which has been developed as an open access and user friendly option to obtain discrete time, predictive survival models at individual level using machine learning techniques, and to perform standard survival analysis. OSA employs an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based method to produce the predictive survival models. Additionally, the software can easily generate survival and hazard curves with multiple options to personalise the plots, obtain contingency tables from the uploaded data to perform different tests, and fit a Cox regression model from a number of predictor variables. In the Materials and Methods section, we depict the general architecture of the application and introduce the mathematical background of each of the implemented methods. The study concludes with examples of use showing the results obtained with public datasets."
