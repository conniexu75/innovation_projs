https://openalex.org/W1501069255,"The hypothesis that the GLUT-1 glucose transporter isoform is expressed selectively in brain at the capillary endothelium, i.e. the blood-brain barrier (BBB), was tested by using quantitative Western blotting, cytochalasin B binding, and in situ hybridization in bovine brain cortex. Purified human red cell glucose transporter was used as the standard for quantitative Western blots, because the mobility of the human erythrocyte and BBB glucose transporters in electrophoretic gels was identical. The concentration of immunoreactive glucose transporter in bovine BBB plasma membranes was 10.8 +/- 0.9 pmol/mgp (mean +/- S.E., n = 6). This value was not statistically different from the estimate of the maximal binding sites of D-glucose-displaceable [3H]cytochalasin B binding in the BBB membrane preparations, 11.7 +/- 3.5 pmol/mgp. In situ hybridization experiments using 35S-labeled antisense and sense riboprobes corresponding to nucleotides 385-932 of the GLUT-1 cDNA showed prominent hybridization of the antisense probe over brain microvascular endothelium, but no hybridization over neuropil greater than that found with the 35S-labeled sense probe. These studies are consistent with the following conclusion: (a) essentially 100% of the glucose transporter binding sites at the BBB can be accounted for by the GLUT-1 isoform; (b) in situ hybridization studies confirm previous Northern blot analysis and indicate the GLUT-1 gene is expressed selectively in microvascular endothelium in brain with minimal, if any, expression of this gene in neurons or glial cells in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1625152287,"A new impermeant photoaffinity label has been used for identifying cell surface glucose transporters in isolated rat adipose cells. This compound is 2-N-4(1-azi-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)benzoyl-1,3-bis(D-mannos-4- yloxy)-2- propylamine. We have used this reagent in combination with immunoprecipitation by specific antibodies against the GLUT4 and GLUT1 glucose transporter isoforms to estimate the relative abundance of these two transporters on the surface of the intact adipose cell following stimulation by insulin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). In the basal state, GLUT4 and GLUT1 are both present at the cell surface but GLUT4 is more abundant than GLUT1. In response to insulin, GLUT4 increases 15-20-fold and GLUT1 increases approximately 5-fold while 3-O-methyl-D-glucose transport is stimulated 20-30-fold. By contrast, PMA only induces a approximately 4-fold increase in GLUT4 while GLUT1 increases approximately 5-fold to the same level as seen with insulin. In addition, PMA stimulates 3-O-methyl-D-glucose transport approximately 3-fold to only 13% of the insulin-stimulated state. Thus GLUT4 is the major glucose transporter isoform under all conditions, and it is selectively and markedly enriched in response to insulin but not PMA which increases GLUT1 and GLUT4 equally. Furthermore, stimulation of glucose transport activity correlates closely with the appearance of GLUT4 on the cell surface in response to both insulin and PMA but does not correlate with the sum of GLUT1 and GLUT4 appearance. These results suggest that GLUT4 may be inherently more active than GLUT1 due to a higher TK (turnover/Km)."
https://openalex.org/W1595121326,"Dermatan sulfate increases the rate of inhibition of thrombin by heparin cofactor II (HCII) approximately 1000-fold by providing a catalytic template to which both the inhibitor and the protease bind. Dermatan sulfate is a linear polymer of D-glucuronic acid (GlcA) or L-iduronic acid (IdoA) alternating with N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (GalNAc) residues. Heterogeneity in dermatan sulfate results from varying degrees of O-sulfation and from the presence of the two types of uronic acid residues. To characterize the HCII-binding site in dermatan sulfate, we isolated the smallest fragment of dermatan sulfate that bound to HCII with high affinity. Dermatan sulfate was partially N-deacetylated by hydrazinolysis, cleaved with nitrous acid at pH 4, and reduced with [3H]NaBH4. The resulting fragments, containing an even number of monosaccharide units with the reducing terminal GalNAc converted to [3H]2,5-anhydro-D-talitol (ATalR), were size-fractionated and then chromatographed on an HCII-Sepharose column. The smallest HCII-binding fragments were hexasaccharides, of which approximately 6% bound. Based on ion-exchange chromatography, the bound material appeared to comprise a heterogeneous mixture of molecules possessing four, five, or six sulfate groups per hexasaccharide. Subsequently, hexasaccharides with the highest affinity for HCII were isolated by overloading the HCII-Sepharose column. The high-affinity hexasaccharides were fractionated by strong anion-exchange chromatography, and one major peak representing approximately 2% of the starting hexasaccharides was isolated. The high-affinity hexasaccharide was cleaved to disaccharides that were analyzed by anion-exchange chromatography, paper electrophoresis, and paper chromatography. A single disulfated disaccharide, IdoA(2-SO4)—-ATalR(4-SO4) was observed, indicating that the hexasaccharide has the following structure: IdoA(2-SO4)—-GalNAc(4-SO4)—-IdoA(2-SO4)—- GalNAc(4-SO4)—-IdoA(2-SO4)—-ATalR(4-SO4). Since IdoA(2-SO4)—-GalNAc(4-SO4) comprises only approximately 5% of the disaccharides present in intact dermatan sulfate, clustering of these disaccharides must occur during biosynthesis to form the high-affinity binding site for HCII."
https://openalex.org/W1593430977,"Peptides containing alpha-aminoboronic acids with neutral side chains are highly effective reaction intermediate analog inhibitors of the serine proteases leukocyte elastase, pancreatic elastase, and chymotrypsin. A protocol has been developed for the synthesis of peptides containing alpha-aminoboronic acids with a basic, 3-guanidinopropyl side chain (boroArg) to extend the range of these compounds to trypsin-like proteases. Ac-(D)Phe-Pro-boroArg-OH, Boc-(D)Phe-Pro-boroArg-OH, and H-(D)Phe-Pro-boroArg-OH were prepared as inhibitors of thrombin based on earlier observations that it has a high affinity for this sequence. All three boronic acids are highly effective, slow-binding inhibitors of thrombin, inhibiting it with final inhibition constants and association rates of: 41 pM, 5.5 x 10(6) M-1 s-1; 3.6 pM, 9.3 x 10(6) M-1 s-1; less than 1 pM, 8.0 x 10(6) M-1 s-1, respectively. Comparison of their binding at equilibrium to thrombin, plasma kallikrein, factor Xa, plasmin, and two-chain tissue plasminogen activator has shown that all three inhibitors have at least 2 orders of magnitude greater affinity for thrombin, with the exception of the acetyl derivative which has a 40-fold greater affinity for thrombin than kallikrein. The boroarginine peptides are effective in inhibiting the action of thrombin in rabbit plasma against its physiological substrates. Activated partial thromboplastin time was significantly prolonged in vitro by all of the inhibitors at concentrations of 50-200 nM. Prolongations of activated partial thromboplastin time were also observed in rabbits after intravenous (40-80 micrograms/kg or subcutaneous (0.20-2 mg/kg) injections of Ac-(D)Phe-Pro-boroArg-OH. Results indicate that this new class of synthetic thrombin inhibitors may be clinically useful as antithrombotic agents."
https://openalex.org/W1482481751,"The long-posed question of the nature of the link between the mycolylarabinogalactan and the underlying peptidoglycan of the cell walls of Mycobacterium sp. has been addressed. The insoluble cell wall matrix of Mycobacterium leprae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Mycobacterium bovis was partially hydrolyzed with acid either before or after per-O-methylation and the resulting oligosaccharides further derivatized and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The structures of fragments arising from the reducing end of arabinogalactan demonstrated the existence of the terminal sequence—-5)-D-Galf-(1—-4)-L-Rhap-(1—3)-D-GlcNAc. Other analyses confirmed the presence of muramyl-6-P within the peptidoglycan of these mycobacteria. Based on the acid lability of the 3-linked GlcNAc unit, the presence of about equimolar amounts of Rhap-(1—-3)-D-GlcNAc and muramyl-6-P in an isolated cell wall fragment, and 31P NMR analysis, it was concluded that the GlcNAc residue of the terminal triglycosyl unit of arabinogalactan is joined by 1-O-phosphoryl linkage to the 6-position of some muramyl residues within the peptidoglycan. Thus, it is reasoned that the massive mycolylarabinogalactan of mycobacteria, responsible for aspects of disease pathogenesis and much of the antibody response in infections, is attached to the peptidoglycan framework by the actinomycete-specific diglycosylphosphoryl bridge, L-Rhap-(1—-3)-D-GlcNAc-(1—-P, perhaps thereby providing a unique target for site-directed chemotherapy of mycobacterial infections."
https://openalex.org/W1585941903,"Treatment of a variety of cells and tissues with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), an activator of protein kinase C (PKC) results in the inhibition of receptor-coupled inositol phospholipid-specific phospholipase C (PLC) activity. To determine whether or not the targets of TPA-activated PKC include one or more isozymes of PLC, studies were carried out with PC12, C6Bu1, and NIH 3T3 cells, which contain at least three PLC isozymes, PLC-beta, PLC-gamma, and PLC-delta. Treatment of the cells with TPA stimulated the phosphorylation of serine residues in PLC-beta, but the phosphorylation state of PLC-gamma and PLC-delta was not changed significantly. Phosphorylation of bovine brain PLC-beta by PKC in vitro resulted in a stoichiometric incorporation of phosphate at serine 887, without any concomitant effect on PLC-beta activity. We propose, therefore, that rather than having a direct effect on enzyme activity, the phosphorylation of PLC-beta by PKC may alter its interaction with a putative guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein and thereby prevent its activation."
https://openalex.org/W1537948347,"Selenoprotein P is the second plasma selenoprotein to be purified. It is a glycoprotein and has been shown to be distinct from plasma glutathione peroxidase. This study characterizes selenoprotein P further. Deglycosylation of the protein shifts its migration on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis from Mr 57,000 to Mr 43,000, indicating it has a substantial carbohydrate component. Measurement of selenium indicates a selenium content of 7.5 +/- 1.0 atoms/molecule based on a polypeptide weight of 43,000. Amino acid analysis accounts for all the selenium as selenocysteine. The protein is also rich in cysteine (17 residues) and histidine (23 residues). Fragmentation of selenoprotein P by trypsin and by cyanogen bromide produces peptides with varying selenium content. This indicates that selenium-rich regions of the protein exist. The concentration of selenoprotein P determined by radioimmunoassay in serum from control rats is 26.3 +/- 4.5 micrograms/ml and in serum from selenium-deficient rats it is 2.7 +/- 0.8 micrograms/ml. Depletion of selenoprotein P from control serum using an immunoaffinity column indicates that over 60% of serum selenium in the rat is contained in this protein. These results demonstrate that selenoprotein P is the major form of selenium in rat serum. It is the first selenoprotein described which has more than one selenium atom/polypeptide chain."
https://openalex.org/W1503496924,"The formate-hydrogen lyase complex of Escherichia coli decomposes formic acid to hydrogen and carbon dioxide under anaerobic conditions in the absence of exogenous electron acceptors. The complex consists of two separable enzymatic activities: a formate dehydrogenase and a hydrogenase. The formate dehydrogenase component (FDHH) of the formate-hydrogen lyase complex was purified to near homogeneity in two column chromatographic steps. The purified enzyme was composed of a single polypeptide of molecular weight 80,000 as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Metal analysis showed each mole of enzyme contained 3.3 g atoms of iron. Denaturation of FDHH released a compound which, when oxidized, displayed a fluorescence spectrum similar to that of the molybdopterin cofactor found in certain other enzymes. The enzyme contained selenium in the form of selenocysteine as determined by radioactive labeling of the enzyme with 75Se and amino acid analysis. FDHH activity was maximal between pH 7.5 and 8.5; however, the enzyme was maximally stable at pH 5.3-6.4 and highly unstable above pH 7.5. Nitrate and nitrite salts caused a drastic reduction in activity. Although azide inhibited FDHH activity, it also protected the enzyme from inactivation by oxygen."
https://openalex.org/W1504802106,"Vascular permeability factor (VPF) is mitogenic for bovine aortic endothelial (BAE) cells, whereas tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is cytostatic and was found to completely block the mitogenic response to VPF. In contrast to the apparently antagonistic mitogenic effects that these two factors elicit, chronic exposure of BAE cells to either VPF of TNF resulted in significant (about 3-fold) increases in the rates of hexose transport. The concentrations required for half-maximal stimulation were 2 ng/ml (40 pM) for TNF and 4 ng/ml (100 pM) for VPF. Exposure to both factors simultaneously resulted in a greater stimulation of transport (about 7-fold) than exposure to either factor alone. Northern blot analysis indicated that the amount of message for the GLUT-1/erythrocyte form of the glucose transporter was specifically increased by treatment with VPF (5-fold), TNF (25-fold), or to both cytokines together (35-fold). Expression of mRNAs for the insulin-sensitive muscle/adipose transporter (GLUT-4), brain/fetal skeletal muscle transporter (GLUT-3), or the hepatic transporter (GLUT-2) were not detected in either control or treated cells. Acute or chronic exposure to insulin (10(-9) to 10(-6) M) did not activate hexose transport in BAE cells. Thus, glucose transport in aortic endothelial cells can be up-regulated by either VPF, a growth stimulator, or by TNF, a growth inhibitor, but not by insulin. The additive effect of the two cytokines together may be important in the control of increased glucose metabolism at sites of inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W1549431764,"Previous work by Browning et al. (Browning, K. S., Lax, S. R., Humphreys, J., Ravel, J. M., Jobling, S. A., and Gehrke, L. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 9630-9634) indicated that wheat germ extracts do not contain sufficient amounts of some of the protein synthesis initiation factors to obtain optimal translation of all mRNAs. In this investigation, a quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine the amounts of eukaryotic initiation factors (eIF) 2, 3, 4A, 4F, and (iso)4F as well as the amounts of 40 S ribosomal subunits and elongation factors (EF) 1 alpha and 2 present in wheat germ extracts. EF-1 alpha is present in the highest amount (approximately 5% of the total protein), and eIF-4F is present in the lowest amount (approximately 0.03% of the total protein). The micromolar amounts of the factors and ribosomes are as follows: EF-1 alpha, 34; EF-2, 5.2; eIF-2, 1.5; eIF-3, 0.7; eIF-4A, 3.0, eIF-4F, 0.09; eIF-(iso)4F, 0.8; and 40 S ribosomal subunits, 3.2. The molar ratios of the factors to 40 S ribosomal subunits are approximately 11:1 for EF-1 alpha, 1.6:1 for EF-2, 0.45:1 for eIF-2, 0.2:1 for eIF-3, 0.9:1 for eIF-4A, 0.03:1 for eIF-4F, and 0.25:1 for eIF-(iso)4F. These findings strongly suggest that the concentrations of the initiation factors, particularly those factors required for the binding of mRNA to ribosomes, may play a major role in regulating the translation of mRNAs within the cell."

NB-598 inhibited cholesterol synthesis from [14C]acetate dose dependently in Hep G2 cells and increased the intracellular radioactivity of squalene. A single oral administration of NB-598 inhibited cholesterol synthesis from [14C]acetate in rats. Moreover, multiple oral administration of NB-598 to dogs decreased serum total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and increased serum squalene levels. After termination of treatment, the reduced serum cholesterol and increased squalene levels returned to their control values."
https://openalex.org/W1588926274,"Tick anticoagulant peptide (TAP) is a potent, highly selective inhibitor of blood coagulation factor Xa (Waxman, L., Smith, D. E., Arcuri, K. E., and Vlasuk, G. P. (1990) Science, 248, 593-596). Further detailed studies pertaining to the in vitro and in vivo evaluation of TAP require quantities of the inhibitor which cannot be isolated from ticks. To overcome this limitation we describe here the characterization of recombinant TAP (rTAP) secreted by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Expression of rTAP was obtained using a chimeric gene containing a fusion between sequences encoding the secretory preproleader of the yeast mating pheromone alpha-factor and a synthetic sequence encoding the 60-amino acid inhibitor under the transcriptional control of a galactose-inducible promoter. Recombinant S. cerevisiae were found to secrete biologically active rTAP into the extracellular medium at levels of 0.1-0.15 g/liter. The secreted inhibitor was purified to homogeneity and found to be indistinguishable from the native inhibitor with respect to several criteria, including primary structure, amino acid composition, and electrophoretic mobility. In addition, purified rTAP and native TAP exhibited similar stoichiometric inhibition of factor Xa in vitro. The in vivo efficacy of rTAP was demonstrated using a model of low grade disseminated intravascular coagulation where the purified inhibitor was shown to significantly inhibit thromboplastin-induced fibrinopeptide A generation following an infusion into conscious rhesus monkeys. The availability of rTAP will allow a detailed evaluation of the in vitro and in vivo properties of this highly specific and potent factor Xa inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W1589636116,"Rat gastric mucin undergoes extensive modifications during biosynthesis, including oligomerization, N- and O-glycosylation, and sulfation. We characterized the events in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and Golgi complex and studied how these steps are interrelated, using specific inhibitors of cellular processes. The mucin precursors oligomerize in the RER by forming intermolecular disulfide bonds. The oligomers comprise a mixture of predominantly di- and trimers of molar ratio 3:2. The oligomerized precursors are transported to the Golgi complex to form mature, oligomeric mucin by extensive O-glycosylation, and sulfation. N-Glycosylation of the precursor is required for efficient oligomerization. Brefeldin A, which inhibits protein transport between RER and Golgi complex, allows oligomerization and concomitantly induces initial O-glycosylation. Oligomerization and egrees from the RER precedes initial O-glycosylation and are therefore independent of the latter process."
https://openalex.org/W1562169645,"This study reports the isolation and characterization of a variant of the human CCRF-CEM leukemia cell line that overproduces the carrier protein responsible for the uptake of reduced folates and the folate analogue methotrexate. The variant was obtained by adapting CCRF-CEM cells for prolonged times to stepwise decreasing concentrations of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate as the sole folate source in the cell culture medium. From cells that were grown on less than 1 nM 5-formyl-tetrahydrofolate, a variant (CEM-7A) was isolated exhibiting a 95-fold increased Vmax for [3H]methotrexate influx compared to parental CCRF-CEM cells. The values for influx Km, efflux t0.5, and Ki for inhibition by other folate (analogue) compounds were unchanged. Affinity labeling of the carrier with an N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of [3H]methotrexate demonstrate an approximately 30-fold increased incorporation of [3H] methotrexate in CEM-7A cells. This suggests that the up-regulation of [3H]methotrexate influx is not only due to an increased amount of carrier protein, but also to an increased rate of carrier translocation or an improved cooperativity between carrier protein molecules. Incubation for 1 h at 37 degrees C of CEM-7A cells with a concentration of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate or 5-methyltetrahydrofolate in the physiological range (25 nM) resulted in a 7-fold decline in [3H]methotrexate influx. This down-regulation during incubations with 5-formyltetrahydrofolate or 5-methyltetrahydrofolate could be prevented by either the addition of 10-25 nM of the lipophilic antifolate trimetrexate or by preincubating CEM-7A cells with 25 nM methotrexate. The down-regulatory effect was specifically induced by reduced folates since incubation of CEM-7A cells with 25 nM of either methotrexate, 10-ethyl-10-deazaaminopterin, aminopterin, or folic acid, or a mixture of purines and thymidine, had no effect on [3H]methotrexate influx. Similarly, these down-regulatory effects on [3H]methotrexate transport by 5-formyltetrahydrofolate, and its reversal by trimetrexate or methotrexate, were also observed, though to a lower extent, for parental CCRF-CEM cells grown in folate-depleted medium rather than in standard medium containing high folate concentrations. These results indicate that mediation of reduced folate/methotrexate transport can occur at reduced folate concentrations in the physiological range, and suggest that the intracellular folate content may be a critical determinant in the regulation of methotrexate transport."
https://openalex.org/W1491429261,"Hormonal activation of the phosphatidylinositol (PI) signaling system initiates a biochemical pathway that bifurcates to increase cellular levels of diacylglycerol and of inositol trisphosphate/Ca2+. Both Diacylglycerol and Ca2+ are known to activate protein kinase C, a primary mediator of the PI signaling system. We now find that the two limbs of the PI pathway utilize distinct multifunctional protein kinases to mediate their cellular effects. An important consequence of Ca2+ elevated by the PI signaling system, when PC12 cells are treated with bradykinin, is the activation of multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. This activation stimulates autophosphorylation of CaM kinase at its regulatory domain and converts it to an active, Ca2(+)-independent species that may be a basis for potentiation of Ca2+ transients."
https://openalex.org/W1928900179,"Chemotaxis is an important step in monocyte recruitment in inflammation, wound healing, and tumor growth. We reported previously that monocyte chemotactic activity secreted by malignant cells and normal smooth muscle cells is associated with a protein or family of proteins that are related to the monocyte-specific smooth muscle cell-derived chemotactic factor (SMC-CF) (Graves, D. T., Jiang, Y. L., Williamson, M. J., and Valente, A. J. (1989) Science 245, 1490-1493). Similar monocyte chemotactic proteins (MCP-1) produced by U-105MG human glioma cells have also been identified (Yoshimura, T., Robinson, E. A., Tanaka, S., Appella, E., Kuratsu, J., and Leonard, E. J. (1989) J. Exp. Med. 169, 1449-1459). We now report that the MCP-1 gene is expressed in MG-63 human osteosarcoma and vascular smooth muscle cells and that SMC-CF antiserum specifically immunoprecipitates proteins synthesized by U-105MG glioma cells. Experiments were undertaken to elucidate the processing pathway of MCP-1/SMC-CF-like proteins in each of these cell types. These experiments demonstrate that larger MCP-1/SMC-CF-like proteins are derived from a Mr = 9000 precursor. Post-translational modification involves the addition of O-linked carbohydrates and sialic acid residues. Differences in carbohydrate processing account for the heterogeneity in MCP-1/SMC-CF-like proteins produced by different cell types. Secretion of these proteins occurs rapidly following processing events in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi compartment."
https://openalex.org/W1581914543,"In order to gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of the attenuated heat shock response in aging diploid fibroblasts (Liu, A. Y.-C., Lin, Z., Choi, H.-S., Sorhage, F., and Li, B. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 12037-12045), we examined the regulation of a heat-inducible, heat shock element (HSE) sequence-specific binding protein in IMR-90 diploid fibroblasts. Using gel retardation assay, we showed that the HSE binding activity in extracts of IMR-90 cells was very dependent on heat shock of the cells; that the induction was transient with a maximal increase observed at 1 h of heat shock. Significantly, the level of this heat-inducible HSE-binding activity was age-dependent, being high in young cells and low in old cells. By Scatchard analysis, we determined that this difference in HSE binding in young and old cells was not due to a change in the affinity of the binding, rather the level of the heat-inducible HSE-binding activity was different. The equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) were estimated to be 30, 25, and 31 pM for cells with population-doubling levels of 22, 35, and 45, respectively; the corresponding Bmax values were 0.087, 0.042, and 0.0059 pmol of 32P-HSE bound per mg of whole cell extract protein. The decreased 32P-HSE-binding activity in the old cells was not a reflection of global alteration of many transcription factors; assay of the DNA binding activity of activating transcription factor showed little difference as a function of age. Experiments of mixing extracts from young and old cells provided evidence of a dominant inhibitor of the HSE-binding activity in old cells. Probing of protein blots with 32P-HSE showed that the subunit molecular weight of the HSE-binding protein was 83,000 in both young and old cells. The pattern of regulation of this HSE-binding protein upon heat shock and cell aging as well as the identity, in DNA sequence specificity and subunit molecular weight, of this protein with that of the human heat shock gene transcription factor suggest that the HSE-binding protein is involved in the transcriptional activation of hsp genes in IMR-90 cells. We concluded that there was an age-associated decrease in the heat shock gene transcription factor DNA-binding activity and that this could account for the attenuated heat shock gene expression in aging diploid cells."
https://openalex.org/W1530233803,"We describe herein the high resolution refined x-ray structure of a trisaccharide, which is a part of the N-acetyllactosamine type glycan found in the majority of the N-glycosyl-proteins, complexed to the isolectin I. According to the potentials used by Imberty et al. (Imburty, A., Gerber, S., Tran, V., and Perez, S. (1990) Glycoconjugate J. 7, 27-54) the trisaccharide is in a low-energy state. Only one mannose moiety establishes direct hydrogen bonds with the lectin, as it is the case for monosaccharide-lectin complexes. The comparison of our trisaccharide with the one determined in solution by Warin et al. (Warin, V., Baert, F., Fouret, R., Strecker, G., Fournet, B., and Montreuil, J. (1979) Carbohydr. Res. 76, 11-22) shows that both adopt roughly the same conformation. The differences in these two sugar structures allow us to assign the role of water molecules present in the vicinity of our trisaccharide for the stabilization of this sugar-lectin complex."
https://openalex.org/W1516164364,"The metabolism of the molecular species of phosphatidylethanolamine derived from [3H]ethanolamine and molecular species of phosphatidylcholine derived from [3H]ethanolamine or [methyl-3H]choline has been studied in rat hepatocytes. After an initial pulse of radioactivity for 1 h and a chase for up to 24 h, the cells were harvested and the incorporation of label into the various molecular species of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine was determined. The incorporation and metabolism of choline- and ethanolamine-labeled phosphatidylcholine was consistent with deacylation of some species of phosphatidylcholine and reacylation to form molecular species of phosphatidylcholine with different fatty acyl components. In contrast, such remodeling of ethanolamine-labeled phosphatidylethanolamine was not evident. Radioactivity disappeared from all molecular species of phosphatidylethanolamine without an increase in any of the species of phosphatidylethanolamine. This radioactivity was recovered in water-soluble metabolites in the cells and medium. Phosphatidylethanolamine (16:0-22:6) had an initial turnover rate (5.8 nmol/h) which was two or more times that of any of the other major molecular species of phosphatidylethanolamine. The molecular species of phosphatidylethanolamine displayed biphasic turnover profiles. The second rate of decay of radioactivity between 12 and 24 h was 2-4 times slower than the initial decay rate. During the first 2 h of the chase period, phosphatidylcholine was a major metabolite of labeled phosphatidylethanolamine. Subsequently, there was minimal conversion of phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine which suggests that only newly made phosphatidylethanolamine is available as a substrate for methylation to phosphatidylcholine."

https://openalex.org/W1526436403,"Protein B23 is an abundant RNA-associated nucleolar phosphoprotein involved in the ribosome assembly process. Previous studies showed that two forms of the protein (B23.1 and B23.2) are generated from a single gene via alternative splicing of 3' exons at the mRNA level (Chang, J. H., and Olson, M. O. J. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 11732-11737). We now report the structure of the complete B23 gene which spans 11-kilobases of DNA and contains 12 exons coding for the 294 amino acid residues. B23.1 mRNA is encoded by exons 1-9, 11, and 12, whereas exons 1-10 code for the B23.2 mRNA. Each exon codes for a relatively short segment of the protein (2-40 amino acid residues). The exons, which are distributed unevenly over the length of the gene, are separated by introns varying in size between 122 base pairs and 2.2 kilobases. Southern blot analyses using a probe derived from the untranslated segment of exon 10 suggests that a single expressed gene is present in the rat genome. Additional genomic clones contained apparent processed pseudogenes for protein B23. Primer extension studies and comparison with a processed pseudogene reveal a probable transcription initiation site at position -96 from the first ATG. The 5' region of the gene contains several possible regulatory elements. Three GC boxes which are potential binding sites for transcription factor Sp1 were found, including one within the first intron. A segment of about 1500 base pairs in the 5' region is unusually rich in the dinucleotide CpG. Although no CCAAT box was found a well-defined TATA box is present at position -126. The latter feature suggests that the B23 gene has some properties of tissue-specific genes in addition to the predominant characteristics of housekeeping genes."
https://openalex.org/W1487347701,"Hepatic expression of the beta-galactoside alpha 2,6-sialyltransferase is at least in part specified by circulatory glucocorticoids. In this report we use the glucocorticoid agonist, RU362, and the antagonist, RU486, to demonstrate the participation of the glucocorticoid receptor pathway in beta-galactoside alpha 2,6-sialyltransferase regulation. The existing pool of sialyltransferase mRNA is turned over with an approximate half-life of 13 h, and presence of dexamethasone does not alter this rate of degradation. By means of nuclear run-off assays and measurement of nuclear unprocessed transcripts we demonstrate that dexamethasone induction of beta-galactoside alpha 2,6-sialyltransferase mRNA in rat Reuber H35 cells is mediated by a transcriptional enhancement mechanism. The same initiation site is utilized for sialyltransferase transcription in both basal- and hormone-stimulated synthesis. Sialyltransferase sequences residing upstream of this transcriptional initiation point are used to control chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression in fusion constructs following transient transfection into H35 cells to demonstrate the presence of a functional promoter. Although no element with similarity to the known GRE consensus sequence resides within this promoter region, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression under the control of the sialyltransferase promoter is subject to a low (1.6-fold) but reproducible induction in response to dexamethasone. Implications of this observation to glucocorticoid regulation are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1508973909,"We have investigated the molecular structure, phospholipid binding, and lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase catalytic activity of pure apoA-IV-2, a basic variant isoform of apoA-IV which is inherited as a classical Mendelian allele with a gene frequency of 0.09. Circular dichroism spectroscopy established that the alpha-helical content of apoA-IV-2 was 75% in the native state (versus 56% for apoA-IV-1), and increased to 88% in the presence of phospholipid. Fluorescence titration established that apoA-IV-2 bound to egg phospholipid vesicles with a Ka of 3.3 x 10(6) liter/mol, 2.4-fold greater than the affinity of apoA-IV-1. Fluorescence quenching studies revealed that, unlike apoA-IV-1, binding of apoA-IV-2 to phospholipid vesicles induced strong shielding of the amino-terminal tryptophan against iodide quenching. Enzyme kinetic studies using both saturated and unsaturated phospholipid substrates demonstrated that apoA-IV-2 was 36-71% more efficient in activating lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase than apoA-IV-1. We conclude that apoA-IV-2 has more alpha-helical structure, is more stable in solution, and is more hydrophobic than apoA-IV-1, and that these distinctive structural features are associated with a higher affinity for phospholipid surfaces and an increased catalytic efficiency of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase activation. The biophysical basis for this latter characteristic may be the ability of apoA-IV-2 to penetrate phospholipid surfaces to a greater depth than apoA-IV-1. These molecular properties may be responsible for the increased levels of high density lipoproteins which have been observed in apoA-IV-2 heterozygotes."
https://openalex.org/W1532263586,"Lysine 2,3-aminomutase, which catalyzes the interconversion of L-lysine and L-beta-lysine, is S-adenosyl-methionine-dependent, and the adenosyl-C-5' methylene group of this coenzyme mediates the transfer of hydrogen from C-3 of lysine to C-2 of beta-lysine. We here report experiments that address the mechanism by which S-adenosylmethionine activates lysine 2,3-aminomutase. We also describe an updated and improved purification procedure that produces enzyme with a specific activity substantially higher than that previously reported. Activation of the enzyme by less than 1 mol of S-adenosyl[1-14C]methionine/mol of subunits in the presence of lysine leads to the production of [14C] methionine in a kinetically biphasic process. After 1.8 min at 30 degrees C, 10% of the 14C is reisolated as [14C] methionine, and the cleavage increases to 19% after 10 min and to 51% after 40 min. Similar experiments with S-[8-14C]adenosylmethionine produce 5'-deoxy[14C]adenosine in amounts similar to the formation of methionine. The major radioactive products isolated in each case are [14C]methionine or 5'-deoxy[14C]adenosine, respectively, and unchanged 14C-labeled S-adenosylmethionine. These experiments support the hypothesis that activation of lysine 2,3-aminomutase involves a transfer of the 5'-deoxyadenosyl moiety from S-adenosylmethionine to another species associated with the enzyme, presumably another cofactor, to form an adenosyl cofactor that functions as the proximal, hydrogen abstracting species in the mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1494575458,"Insulin receptor-specific polyclonal antipeptide serum was generated against a synthetic pentadecapeptide (residues 657-670) of the deduced amino acid sequence of human insulin proreceptor cDNA for use in the analysis of insulin receptors in the retina. The affinity-purified antibodies recognized peptide antigen but not keyhole limpet hemocyanin as determined by dot blot analysis and solid phase radioimmunoassay. Addition of either synthetic peptide or the affinity-purified serum had no effect on 125I-insulin binding to placental membranes or to cells in culture. alpha-Subunits of approximately 125 kDa from human placental membranes and liver membranes were labeled by immunoblot analysis with this antiserum. In membranes isolated from human retina and brain, two classes of alpha-subunits of approximately 125 and 115 kDa were detectable. The 115-kDa subunit was neuraminidase resistant whereas the 125-kDa subunit was digested to a band of 115 kDa, indicating that these bands represent peripheral and neuronal receptors, respectively. Analysis of human retinas obtained from type I diabetic donors revealed an increased level of neuronal receptor as compared with normal retinas. These data indicate that human retina expresses neuronal insulin receptor subtypes that are up-regulated in diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W1540396179,"Treatment of intact human erythrocytes with bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate converted band 3 to two species with lower electrophoretic mobility in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The presence of the noncovalent anion transport inhibitor, 4,4'-dinitrostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate, promoted the lowest mobility form, while a closely related analogue, 4,4'-diisothiocyano-2,2'-stilbenedisulfonate, did not. Ferguson analysis of the electrophoretic behavior of the two slowly migrating bands strongly suggested that they represented dimers and tetramers of band 3. Increasing the temperature of the SDS solution to greater than 60 degrees C quantitatively converted the tetrameric species to the dimeric form. We conclude that band 3 can be intermonomerically cross-linked by bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate as covalent dimers within two alternate quaternary forms in a manner modulated by the ligand occupying the intramonomeric stilbenedisulfonate site. In one form, band 3 covalent dimers are noncovalently associated as a SDS-resistant tetramer, while in the other form, covalent dimers are not so associated. There is no obvious relationship between ligand stereochemistry and the resulting quaternary form, suggesting that the two forms reflect alternate allosterically modulated porter quaternary structures. The significance of these two quaternary states to the transport or the ankyrin binding functions of band 3 is unknown."
https://openalex.org/W1545962383,"Abstract Although small in size (20 kDa), the vaccinia virus (VV) thymidine kinase protein (EC 2.7.1.21 TK) is a relatively complex enzyme which must contain domains involved in binding both substrates (ATP and thymidine) and a feedback inhibitor (dTTP), as well as sequences directing the association of individual protein monomers into a functional tetrameric enzyme. Alignment of predicted amino acid sequences of the thymidine kinase genes from a variety of sources was used to identify highly conserved regions as a first step toward locating potential regions housing essential domains. A conserved domain (domain I) near the amino terminus of VV TK protein had characteristics consistent with a nucleotide-binding site. Analysis of the nucleotide substrate specificity of VV TK indicated that ATP acts as the major phosphate donor for thymidine phosphorylation while GTP, CTP, and UTP were inefficient substrates. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on domain I to generate 11 mutant enzymes. Comparison of the wild-type and mutant proteins with regard to enzyme activity revealed that two of the mutant enzymes, T18 and S19, exhibited enhanced enzyme activity (3.73-fold and 1.35-fold, respectively) relative to the control. The other mutations introduced led to greatly reduced levels of enzyme activity which correlated with a reduced or altered ability of the mutant enzymes to bind ATP as determined by ATP-agarose affinity chromatography. Wild-type VV TK bound to an ATP affinity column could also be eluted with dTTP. Glycerol gradient separation of wild-type TK in the presence or absence of dTTP indicated that dissociation of the tetrameric complex was not the means by which enzymatic inhibition was achieved. Taken together, these results suggest that (i) domain I (amino acids 11-22) of the VV TK corresponds to the ATP-binding site, and (ii) that dTTP is able to interfere with ATP binding, either directly or indirectly, and thereby inhibit enzymatic activity without dissociating the native enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1516538245,"Pertussis toxin is a protein containing five noncovalently linked subunits which are assembled into the monomer A (containing the subunit S1) and the oligomer B (containing subunits S2, S3, S4, and S5 in a 1:1:2:1 ratio). Each of the five subunits is synthesized as a precursor containing a secretory leader peptide and is secreted into the periplasm of Bordetella pertussis where the five subunits are assembled into the oligomeric structure and then released into the culture medium. In the absence of subunit S3 the remaining subunits are not secreted into the medium, thus suggesting that the assembled structure is necessary for the release of the toxin into the supernatant. In this study we describe four B. pertussis mutants which secrete into the medium low amounts of the B oligomer of pertussis toxin. These mutants have single or multiple changes in the gene encoding the S1 subunit and synthesize S1 proteins with altered conformation which are not assembled into the holotoxin and are apparently degraded in the periplasm. These data indicate that while the B oligomer alone has the structural information necessary for the extracellular export of pertussis toxin, the S1 subunit is required for its efficient release into the medium."
https://openalex.org/W1652043423,"Wild type Dictyostelium discoideum actin (42 kDa) and a truncated form of actin were expressed in Escherichia coli. Amino-terminal sequencing indicated that the truncated species was composed of two peptides, which were the result of internal translation initiation at Met-119 and Met-123. After sonication or French press lysis, all of the actin was present in highly insoluble aggregates. When bacteria were lysed directly into Sarkosyl detergent, most of the actin was soluble, and greater than 50% remained soluble after Sarkosyl was removed. Full-length wild type actin was purified using DNase I affinity chromatography and gel filtration. This species was able both to polymerize and to bind myosin in an ATP-sensitive manner, indicating it was native. Affinity chromatography demonstrated that the truncated form of actin bound DNase I to the same extent as actin synthesized in eukaryotes, indicating the applicability of this approach to mutant forms of actin. Thus, lysis procedures utilizing Sarkosyl may prove useful in isolating some of the other proteins which are normally soluble but become insoluble after bacterial expression."
https://openalex.org/W1565399287,"Newborn combined lipase-deficient (cld) mice have severe hypertriglyceridemia associated with a marked decrease of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic lipase (HL) activities. Since the cld mutation and lipase genes reside on separate chromosomes, combined lipase deficiency cannot result from defects occurring within the LPL or HL structural genes. To elucidate the biochemical basis of this trans-acting defect, cld mice were compared to unaffected littermates for changes in lipase mRNA levels, rates of synthesis, and posttranslational processing and secretion. LPL and HL mRNA levels in cld liver and LPL in cld heart were comparable to controls; corresponding lipase synthetic rates were modestly decreased by about 30%. However, these reduced synthetic rates were not lipase-specific, since the rates of apolipoprotein (apo) A-I and apoA-II synthesis in cld liver were similarly decreased. Despite LPL synthetic rates that were 70% of controls, LPL mass in cld postheparin plasma was markedly reduced to only 7% of control values, suggesting that the majority of LPL is not secreted but remains intracellular. Consistent with a lipase secretory defect, neither the LPL nor HL oligomannosyl forms were converted to their respective complex forms in cld tissues, indicating that the lipases had failed to move from the endoplasmic reticulum/cis-Golgi to the medial/trans-Golgi network. In addition, the majority of intracellular LPL was catalytically inactive, since LPL specific activity (units/mg LPL protein) in cld heart, kidney, and brain was reduced 80-97%. In contrast to the severe impairment of lipase posttranslational processing and secretion, cld mouse plasma contained normal levels of another secretory N-linked glycoprotein, adipsin, with its oligosaccharide chains fully processed to the complex form. Thus, the cld mutation appears not to globally disrupt the secretion of all N-linked glycoproteins, but rather selectively impairs LPL and HL at points essential to their normal intracellular transport and secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1588115564,"In the accompanying paper (Altman, E., Bankaitis, V.A., and Emr, S.D. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 18148-18153) a putative SecB binding site was identified in the mature LamB protein. The export of wild-type LamB was unperturbed when this region was removed, however, suggesting the presence of a second site of interaction between SecB and LamB. In this paper we show that the interference caused by export-defective LamB proteins is influenced by the amount of signal sequence that is present. If a large portion of the signal sequence is deleted then the interference levels are significantly reduced. This result suggests that a region of the signal sequence contributes to the interaction of SecB with the LamB protein. Using anti-SecB affinity chromatography, we demonstrated directly that the association of SecB protein with precursor LamB is dependent on the presence of both the LamB signal sequence and the interfering region which maps to amino acids 320-380 of mature LamB. Although the interfering region is not necessary for the export of wild-type LamB under normal conditions, when the signal sequence is mutationally altered the interfering region is required to promote the efficient export of LamB protein. Also, deletion of the interfering region eliminates the ability of wild-type LamB precursor to be maintained in an export competent conformation in vivo. Collectively, our results indicate that efficient export of the LamB protein is achieved by an interaction with SecB that involves both the LamB signal sequence and the interfering region in mature LamB."
https://openalex.org/W3023360178,"Altered membrane proteins have been previously described in beta thalassemia and are thought to play an important role in the shortened erythrocyte survival. To investigate the mechanism by which these changes occur, purified heme-containing alpha-hemoglobin chains were entrapped within normal erythrocytes by reversible osmotic lysis. These resealed cells exhibited normal hemoglobin concentration, cell volume, deformability, and no substantial modifications of membrane proteins. Incubation (37 degrees C; up to 20 h) of the alpha-chain-loaded cells resulted in increasing amounts of membrane-associated alpha-chains. This was associated with concurrent decreases in the protein concentrations and reactive thiol groups of spectrin, ankyrin, and actin as determined by gel electrophoresis. The decreases in membrane protein concentration and reactive thiol groups after 20 h of incubation were closely correlated (R2 = 0.947) in the alpha-chain-loaded cells. Indicative of increased oxidant stress within the alpha-chain-loaded erythrocytes, methemoglobin generation was also significantly increased in the alpha-chain-loaded erythrocytes. In addition, entrapment of alpha-chains led to a progressive and significant decrease in erythrocyte deformability. Thus, the entrapment of purified alpha-chains in normal erythrocytes resulted in structural and functional abnormalities very similar to that observed in beta-thalassemic erythrocytes in vivo. The model described provides a means by which the fate of excess alpha-chains, their pathophysiological effects, as well as possible therapeutic approaches to thalassemias can be examined."
https://openalex.org/W1599810052,"Abstract Sulfate transport was examined using membrane vesicles (pH 7.0 inside) prepared from rat liver lysosomes. Sulfate uptake was dependent upon external pH with increased uptake at lower buffer pH. The Km for uptake was 160 microM at pH 5.0 while at pH 7.0, a lower affinity system with a Km of 1.4 mM was present. The protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone increased uptake at pH 5.0 while valinomycin/KCl had no effect. In contrast, at pH 7.0, valinomycin-induced changes in membrane potential stimulated uptake. Countertransport of sulfate at pH 7.0 was inhibited by 4,4'-diisothiocyano-2,2'-disulfonic acid stilbene, N-(4-azido-2-nitrophenyl)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid, and a variety of anions: SO4(2-) greater than MoO4(2-) greater than Cl- greater than HPO4- greater than HCO3-. Trans-stimulation of sulfate uptake at pH 7.0 was observed with MoO4(2-) and, to a lesser extent, with S2O3(2-) while Cl-, HPO4-, and HCO3- had little effect. However, chloride loading of vesicles resulted in marked stimulation of sulfate uptake at pH 5.0. It appears that sulfate and protons exit lysosomes in exchange for chloride by a specific, pH-regulated anion transport system."
https://openalex.org/W2137585149,"A nitrocellulose filter-binding assay has been developed to study the interaction of Xenopus transcription factor IIIA (TFIIIA) with its specific binding site on the 5 S RNA gene. The protein binds to a DNA restriction fragment containing a Xenopus oocyte 5 S RNA gene (5 S DNA) with an apparent association constant of 1.90 x 10(9) M-1 in 0.1 M salt, pH 7.5, at 22 degrees C. Under these assay conditions, the protein has approximately a 100-fold lower binding affinity for DNA fragments that do not contain a 5 S RNA gene. Analysis of the temperature dependence of the binding of TFIIIA to 5 S DNA indicates that the interaction is largely enthalpy driven at temperatures above 19 degrees C, while it is largely entropy driven at lower temperatures. One molecule of TFIIIA binds per 5 S RNA gene, and this bimolecular complex dissociates with first order kinetics, having a half-life of 15.6 min. The DNA binding activity of the protein exhibits a broad pH optimum from 6.0 to 8.0, and is optimal at 5 mM MgCl2 decreasing rapidly at higher divalent ion concentrations. The specific binding of TFIIIA to 5 S DNA is insensitive to the identity of the monovalent cation present in the binding buffer. In comparison, the anion effects on DNA binding are dramatic, with a 100-fold decrease in binding affinity observed to follow the lyotropic series. This result suggests that there are several specific anion-binding sites on TFIIIA. Determination of the monovalent salt dependence of the association constant revealed that as many as 8 lysine-phosphate type ionic bonds are formed in the TFIIIA-DNA complex."
https://openalex.org/W1485459937,"A protein of approximately 40 kDa was the major Ca2(+)-binding protein purified by Ca2(+)-dependent hydrophobic affinity chromatography from the cell lysates and conditioned media of RAW macrophages. Other Ca2(+)-binding proteins, including several annexins (calelectrins), S100-like proteins, and calmodulin, were less abundant and preferentially found in the cell lysates. Amino acid sequences of tryptic fragments from the purified 40-kDa protein revealed its identity to gCap39, an actin-binding protein encoded by a cDNA isolated on the basis of its homology with gelsolin. When an expression vector containing the gCap39 coding region was transfected into COS cells, high levels of gCap39 were found in both the cells and conditioned media, whereas annexins were only present in the cells. gCap39 could also be purified from human plasma where it appeared to be a minor component. No signal sequence was detected in the primary structure of gCap39 and the secreted and intracellular forms of gCap39 are of identical size, suggesting that unlike gelsolin, the mechanism of gCap39 secretion may not depend on a signal sequence. The high concentration of gCap39 in macrophages and its constitutive secretion as well as intracellular retention suggest that this protein may have a dual role in macrophage function, namely that of a Ca2(+)- and polyphosphoinositide-regulated intracellular modulator of the cytoskeleton as well as that of a secreted protein involved in the clearance of actin from the extracellular environment."
https://openalex.org/W1953978055,"The cytosolic form of NADP+:isocitrate dehydrogenase, a primary source of the NADPH required for de novo fatty acid synthesis in lactating bovine mammary gland, was studied to determine possible mechanisms of regulation by metabolites. Stopped flow kinetics showed a distinct lag time, followed by attainment of an apparently linear final velocity. Direct nonlinear regression analyses of the reaction progress curves allowed for the calculation of the rate constant (kappa) for the transition of the enzyme from an inactive to an active form; this transition is best catalyzed by its metal-substrate complex. Preincubation with metal-substrate or metal-citrate nearly abolished the lag by increasing kappa 10-fold. In steady state experiments, analyses of velocity versus metal-citrate complex as a binding isotherm, following the assumptions of Wyman's theory of thermodynamic linkage, showed that binding of metal-citrate complex could both activate and inhibit the enzyme. This analysis suggested: (a) activation by binding to sites with an average dissociation constant of 0.25 mM; (b) inhibition by binding to sites with an average dissociation constant of 3.83 mM; and (c) modulation (reactivation) by binding to sites with an average dissociation constant of 1.54 mM. Concentration ranges observed for these transitions are compatible with physiological conditions, suggesting that complexes of metal-citrate and metal-isocitrate serve to modulate the activity of NADP+:isocitrate dehydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W1534647523,"It has been shown that the synthesis of an export-defective protein can interfere with the normal export process in Escherichia coli by limiting the availability of SecB protein, a component of the export apparatus (Collier, D.N., Bankaitis, V.A., Weiss, J.B., and Bassford, P.J. (1988) Cell 53, 273-283). Consistent with this observation, we find that the interference elicited by an export-defective LamB protein is a titratable response resulting from the limitation of a single ligand. We have mapped the interfering region in LamB to between amino acids 320 and 380 of the mature protein. Expression of this sequence in the form of a LacZ-LamB-LacZ fusion protein elicits the export interference phenotype. Deletion of the sequence from an export-defective LamB protein eliminates the ability of this protein to interfere with the export of other secreted proteins. Together, these findings show that this sequence is both necessary and sufficient to cause export interference. Surprisingly, deletion of this sequence from an otherwise wild-type LamB protein does not cause the mutant LamB product to exhibit any obvious export defect. Based on our results, we propose that SecB interacts with both amino acids 320-380 of mature LamB and the LamB signal sequence during initiation of the export process."
https://openalex.org/W1535144635,"We have recently described the existence of two sets of genes encoding ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rbu-P2 carboxylase), rbcA-rbcB and rbcL-rbcS, in the photosynthetic purple sulfur bacterium Chromatium vinosum (Viale, A.M., Kobayashi, H., and Akazawa, T. (1989) J. Bacteriol. 171, 2391-2400). These genes were cloned in plasmid vectors, and their expression was studied in Escherichia coli. Expression of rbcA-rbcB in E. coli was obtained under the control of its own promoter. On the other hand, expression of rbcL-rbcS in this host was not observed unless these genes were cloned under the control of the tac promoter. Purified rbcA-rbcB and rbcL-rbcS products from E. coli consisted of large and small subunits in equimolar ratios. They also showed very close elution profiles to Rbu-P2 carboxylase isolated from C. vinosum in size-exclusion chromatography columns, thus suggesting hexadecameric (L8S8) structures. Vmax of Rbu-P2 carboxylase were very similar for both enzymes, but the Km values for CO2 and ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate showed some differences. Immunochemical and N-terminal amino acid sequence analyses of the large and small subunits encoded by rbcA-rbcB and rbcL-rbcS also differed, especially at the level of the small subunits. The comparisons described above as well as the analysis of C. vinosum crude extracts by anion-exchange chromatography indicated that Rbu-P2 carboxylase encoded by rbcA-rbcB was the only species detected in the photosynthetic bacterium."
https://openalex.org/W1586898557,"Using the combination of a subtracted library and differential hybridization, a 409-base pair cDNA was identified that corresponds to a mRNA that is induced 2-3-fold when rat Fao hepatoma cells are subjected to amino acid starvation for 12 h. While this mRNA species was induced during starvation, others such as beta-actin, Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase, glyceraldehyde-3-P, and histone H4 were decreased in abundance to 25-50% of their original levels. The induction of the amino acid starvation-induced (ASI) mRNA was repressed when starved cells were returned to a medium supplemented with amino acids. Tissue distribution analysis showed the ASI mRNA, approximately 650 base pairs in length, to be present in every rat tissue tested. The cDNA clone has been sequenced and appears to correspond to the 3'-most end of the mRNA. The cDNA sequence includes the poly(A) tail, two potential polyadenylation signal sequences, and an open reading frame that we presume to be a portion of the coding sequence. The ASI cDNA will be used to investigate the molecular mechanisms for amino acid-dependent regulation of protein expression by mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W1598927263,"Primary cultures of rat renal proximal tubular epithelial cells were used to characterize the biosynthesis and processing of the mitochondrial glutaminase. When the cells were labeled with [35S]methionine in the presence of 20 microM carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, only a 72-kDa peptide, which co-migrates with the primary translation product of the glutaminase mRNA, was immunoprecipitated. At lower concentrations of carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, the 68- and 65-kDa peptides that are characteristic of the mature glutaminase and a 71-kDa peptide were synthesized. Pulse-chase experiments suggest that the 72-kDa cytosolic precursor could be quantitatively chased to generate the mature mitochondrial species. The observed kinetics indicate that the 71-kDa species is an intermediate in the import pathway. In addition, the 65-kDa glutaminase peptide was synthesized more rapidly than the 68-kDa peptide, and the two peptides were produced in a final ratio of 3:1, respectively. These results suggest that one subunit of the tetrameric glutaminase may be subject to covalent modification. In vitro processing was also characterized by incubating isolated rat liver mitochondria with the glutaminase precursor that was produced by in vitro translation of acidotic rat renal poly(A+) RNA. This system produced an identical sequence of processing reactions. The in vitro formation of the 71-kDa intermediate required a transmembrane potential. Both the intermediate and the mature forms of the glutaminase were recovered in the mitochondria and were resistant to trypsin digestion. Thus, the glutaminase precursor is rapidly translocated across the inner mitochondrial membrane and initially processed to yield an intermediate. The intermediate is subsequently processed to yield the two peptides that constitute the mature enzyme."

A c1 inactivator gene, coi, was defined by mutations in immC that suppress the virulence of the P1virC mutation. The exact location of the coi gene was not known (Scott, J.R. (1980) Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 90, 49-65). When a variety of P1 immC fragments were inserted into an expression vector, a gene product was inducible for the open reading frame 4 only. We identify this product as the c1 inactivator protein, coi by the following criteria: (a) expression of coi from a recombinant plasmid induces the P1 prophage and inhibits lysogenization of sensitive bacteria by P1; (b) all c1-controlled operator-promoter elements tested in vivo are derepressed by coi; (c) a partially purified coi protein (apparent molecular weight = 4800) interacts with c1 repressor and inhibits its binding to the operator in vitro. Based on these results we refine a model for the regulation of those genes and elements within immC which participate in the decision of P1 to enter the lytic or lysogenic pathway."

The cDNA encoding the full length alpha-AE protein was modified to terminate translation at a site preceding the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, thereby enabling functional enzyme to be secreted into the medium. Purification of recombinant alpha-AE to homogeneity indicated that the enzyme was synthesized and secreted as two proteins of 75-77 kDA. The observed heterogeneity was due to inefficient glycosylation at Asn660, as demonstrated by glycopeptidase F digestion. Using the synthetic peptide, dansyl-Tyr-Val-Gly, the specific activity of the recombinant enzyme at pH 7.0 was found to be 1.4 mumol/min/mg and the Km of the enzyme was determined to be 3 microM. The purified recombinant enzyme has maximal activity at pH 4.5-5.5; however, a rapid inactivation of the enzyme occurs in acidic solutions in vitro. This inactivation is diminished when activity is measured at pH 7.0-10.0. The availability of large amounts of readily purified, active recombinant alpha-AE should allow detailed probing of reaction mechanism, copper coordination chemistry, and turn-over-based inactivation events."

These particles contained mutant L2 protein exclusively, completely lacked L16, and had reduced amounts of L28, L33, and L34. They did not reassociate with 30 S ribosomal subunits and were inactive in polyphenylalanine synthesis.

The secondary structure of isocitrate dehydrogenase, as monitored by CD spectra in the far-UV region, is unaltered by enzyme-ligand interactions; in contrast, dramatic changes occur in the near-UV region (270-290 nm) assigned to tyrosine and/or solvent-exposed tryptophan residues. Both the coenzyme analog, 2‘-phosphoadenosine 5‘-diphosphoribose, and NADPH have an effect on the CD spectrum which is opposite to that produced by metal complexes of either isocitrate or citrate. A CD band at 292 nm assigned to approximately 2 tryptophan residues in a hydrophobic environment is unchanged by binding of substrate or coenzyme. Approximately 30% of the intrinsic fluorescence of isocitrate dehydrogenase, corresponding to approximately 2 tryptophan residues, is not quenched by acrylamide in the absence of 6.3 M guanidine hydrochloride and remains unquenched in the enzyme-substrate complex. The constancy in the proportion of buried and exposed tryptophan residues implicates tyrosine in the observed near-UV CD spectral changes. Since binding of ligands does not influence quaternary structure (Seery, V.L., and Farrell, H. M., Jr. (1989) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 274, 453-462), activation of isocitrate dehydrogenase may be related to a substrate-induced conformational transition."

https://openalex.org/W1516283201,"Turnover of the nitrogen moiety from free amino acid pools in two thermophilic methanogens, Methanobacterium thermautotrophicum delta H and Methanococcus thermolithotrophicus SN1, has been monitored with 15N NMR spectroscopy. In cells growing exponentially on 15NH4Cl, glutamate was the major soluble 15N-labeled species in both organisms. When the Mb. thermoautotrophicum cells were harvested, washed, and resuspended into medium containing 14NH4Cl, the resonance for [15N]glutamate decreased with a half-life of 0.5 h. This is considerably faster than the turnover rate for the carbon side chain of glutamate (7 h) obtained when a 13CO2 pulse followed by a 12CO2 chase was incorporated into the 15N/14N-labeling experiment. Such behavior is consistent with recycling of the glutamate carbon skeleton via alpha-ketoglutarate after transamination reactions remove the 15N for biosynthesis of other amino acids, nucleic acids, etc. When the cells were in stationary phase, 15N turnover was considerably slower indicating that transaminase activity had also decreased. Mc. thermolithotrophicus has a much more fragile cell wall and easily lyses. To avoid cell loss in the 15N/14N experiment, 15NH+4 growth followed by 14NH4+ dilution was used. In this organism the glutamate-labeled nitrogen turns over quite rapidly (t1/2 approximately 9 min), at a rate comparable to that for the carbon skeleton (t1/2 approximately 10 min). Beta-Glutamate, the second major carbon and nitrogen pool in this organism, turns over its 15N label very slowly. Therefore, this beta-amino acid does not appear to serve as a nitrogen donor in Mc. thermolithotrophicus."
https://openalex.org/W1543616867,"Regulation of co-expression of three neuropeptide genes, i.e. genes encoding enkephalin, cholecystokinin, and gastrin-releasing peptide, was studied in human neuroepithelioma cells. In nondifferentiated state, the continuous cell line SK-N-MC displayed an equally high level of expression of the enkephalin, cholecystokinin, and gastrin-releasing peptide genes. By culturing in medium containing endothelial cell growth supplement the SK-N-MC cells differentiated morphologically into a cell type with neurite-like processes. After 3 days the expression of the enkephalin gene in endothelial cell growth supplement-differentiated cells was significantly reduced by 75% as compared to the nondifferentiated cells, while there was no change in the expression of the cholecystokinin and gastrin-releasing peptide genes during differentiation. The results show that the enkephalin gene is selectively down-regulated during differentiation of neuroepithelioma cells. It is suggested that the down-regulation is related to the transient expression of the enkephalin gene in developing brain and other organs. Thus the neuroepithelioma cell line may provide a cellular model to study the underlying molecular mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1520904860,"DNA ligases play obligatory roles during replication, repair, and recombination. Multiple forms of DNA ligase have been reported in mammalian cells including DNA ligase I, the high molecular mass species which functions during replication, and DNA ligase II, the low molecular mass species which is associated with repair. In addition, alterations in DNA ligase activities have been reported in acute lymphocytic leukemia cells, Bloom's syndrome cells, and cells undergoing differentiation and development. To better distinguish the biochemical and molecular properties of the various DNA ligases from human cells, we have developed a method of purifying multiple species of DNA ligase from HeLa cells by chromatography through DEAE-Bio-Gel, CM-Bio-Gel, hydroxylapatite, Sephacryl S-300, Mono P, and DNA-cellulose. DNA-cellulose chromatography of the partially purified enzymes resolved multiple species of DNA ligase after labeling the enzyme with [alpha-32P]ATP to form the ligase-[32P]AMP adduct. The early eluting enzyme activity (0.25 M NaCl) contained a major 67-kDa-labeled protein, while the late eluting activity (0.48 M NaCl) contained two major labeled proteins of 90 and 78 kDa. Neutralization experiments with antiligase I antibodies indicated that the early and late eluting activity peaks were DNA ligase II and I, respectively. The three major ligase-[32P]AMP polypeptides (90, 78, and 67 kDa) were subsequently purified to near homogeneity by elution from preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. All three polypeptides retained DNA ligase activities after gel elution and renaturation. To further reveal the relationship between these enzymes, partial digestion by V8-protease was performed. All three purified polypeptides gave rise to a common 22-kDa-labeled fragment for their AMP-binding domains, indicating that the catalytic sites of ligase I and II are quite similar, if not identical. Similar findings were obtained from the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of their AMP-binding domains in the trypsin-digested protein fragments. The results also suggested that these isozymes have been derived from the same primordial DNA sequence or from the same precursor protein. The purification scheme and the data obtained will be instrumental for the further elucidation of the biological roles of various DNA ligases from human cells."
https://openalex.org/W1579553689,"When 5-methylphenazinium methylsulfate and a reductant (ascorbate or NADH) are added together to a suspension of resealed chromaffin-vesicle membranes, the pH gradient (inside acidic) and the membrane potential (inside positive) established by the H(+)-translocating adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) are rapidly dissipated. Dissipation of the pH gradient may be observed using either the optical probe acridine orange or the weak base methylamine. Dissipation of the membrane potential may be observed using the potential-dependent dye oxonol VI. A reductant and 5-methylphenazinium methylsulfate added in combination will also abolish a K+ diffusion potential across chromaffin-vesicle membranes but not across liposome membranes. 5-Methylphenazinium methylsulfate oxidizes cytochrome b561 in chromaffin-vesicle ghosts. Ascorbate readily reduces cytochrome b561, but reduction of cytochrome b561 by NADH is greatly enhanced in the presence of 5-methylphenazinium methylsulfate. These results are consistent with a mechanism in which proton gradient dissipation (a net efflux of H+) is caused by an influx of electrons through the membrane-protein cytochrome b561 coupled with an efflux of H carried by the reduced species 5-methyl-10-hydrophenazine. Although 5-methylphenazinium has been thought to accumulate within acidic vesicles as a weak base, this accounts for neither proton gradient dissipation nor for intravesicular accumulation of the compound."
https://openalex.org/W1504337634,"By means of an in situ colony autoradiographic assay for the incorporation of [14C]inositol into the trichloroacetic acid-insoluble fraction, we have isolated a mutant of cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells defective in inositol transport, named mutant 648. Through comparison of the inositol uptake activity of 648 cells with that of the parental cells with various concentrations of inositol and sodium, it has been demonstrated that Chinese hamster ovary cells possess a sodium-dependent transport system for inositol, and that 648 cells lack this system. The sodium-dependent uptake is inhibited by 2,4-dinitrophenol and ouabain, and the intracellular concentration of inositol exceeds the extracellular concentration during the uptake period, indicating that it is active transport, at least partially driven by the sodium gradient generated by Na+,K(+)-ATPase. The apparent Km for inositol has been estimated to be 12.0 microM. It is inhibited by hyperglycemic concentration of D-glucose in a competitive fashion."
