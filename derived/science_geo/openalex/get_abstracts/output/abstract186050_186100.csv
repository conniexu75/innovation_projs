https://openalex.org/W2066073101,"We found that repeated slow slip events observed on the deeper interface of the northern Cascadia subduction zone, which were at first thought to be silent, have unique nonearthquake seismic signatures. Tremorlike seismic signals were found to correlate temporally and spatially with slip events identified from crustal motion data spanning the past 6 years. During the period between slips, tremor activity is minor or nonexistent. We call this associated tremor and slip phenomenon episodic tremor and slip (ETS) and propose that ETS activity can be used as a real-time indicator of stress loading of the Cascadia megathrust earthquake zone."

Here we report the structure of the entire prokaryotic Kir channel assembly, in the closed state, refined to a resolution of 3.65 angstroms. We identify the main activation gate and structural elements involved in gating. On the basis of structural evidence presented here, we suggest that gating involves coupling between the intracellular and membrane domains. This further suggests that initiation of gating by membrane or intracellular signals represents different entry points to a common mechanistic pathway."

Catalytic epoxidation of olefins affords an interesting production technology. We found a widely usable green route to the production of epoxides: A silicotungstate compound, [gamma-SiW10O34(H2O)2]4-, is synthesized by protonation of a divacant, lacunary, Keggin-type polyoxometalate of [gamma-SiW10O36]8- and exhibits high catalytic performance for the epoxidation of various olefins, including propylene, with a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) oxidant at 305 kelvin. The effectiveness of this catalyst is evidenced by >/=99% selectivity to epoxide, >/=99% efficiency of H2O2 utilization, high stereospecificity, and easy recovery of the catalyst from the homogeneous reaction mixture."
https://openalex.org/W2021080256,"The extraordinary abundance of ants in tropical rainforest canopies has led to speculation that numerous arboreal ant taxa feed principally as “herbivores” of plant and insect exudates. Based on nitrogen (N) isotope ratios of plants, known herbivores, arthropod predators, and ants from Amazonia and Borneo, we find that many arboreal ant species obtain little N through predation and scavenging. Microsymbionts of ants and their hemipteran trophobionts might play key roles in the nutrition of taxa specializing on N-poor exudates. For plants, the combined costs of biotic defenses and herbivory by ants and tended Hemiptera are substantial, and forest losses to insect herbivores vastly exceed current estimates."
https://openalex.org/W2171519564,"We have performed an in situ test of the iron limitation hypothesis in the subarctic North Pacific Ocean. A single enrichment of dissolved iron caused a large increase in phytoplankton standing stock and decreases in macronutrients and dissolved carbon dioxide. The dominant phytoplankton species shifted after the iron addition from pennate diatoms to a centric diatom, Chaetoceros debilis, that showed a very high growth rate, 2.6 doublings per day. We conclude that the bioavailability of iron regulates the magnitude of the phytoplankton biomass and the key phytoplankton species that determine the biogeochemical sensitivity to iron supply of high-nitrate, low-chlorophyll waters."

Yet high-resolution structures of ligand transporter complexes have previously been unavailable. We obtained x-ray crystallographic structures of the trimeric AcrB pump from Escherichia coli with four structurally diverse ligands. The structures show that three molecules of ligands bind simultaneously to the extremely large central cavity of 5000 cubic angstroms, primarily by hydrophobic, aromatic stacking and van der Waals interactions. Each ligand uses a slightly different subset of AcrB residues for binding. The bound ligand molecules often interact with each other, stabilizing the binding."
https://openalex.org/W2077672936,"Activation of the serine-threonine kinase Akt by cytokines, chemokines, and bacterial products delays constitutive neutrophil apoptosis, resulting in a prolonged inflammatory response. We showed previously that Akt exists in a signaling complex with p38 MAPK, MAPK-activated protein kinase-2 (MAPKAPK-2), and heat shock protein-27 (Hsp27); and Hsp27 dissociates from the complex upon neutrophil activation. To better understand the regulation of this signaling module, the hypothesis that Akt phosphorylation of Hsp27 regulates its interaction with Akt was tested. The present study shows that Akt phosphorylated Hsp27 on Ser-82 in vitro and in intact cells, and phosphorylation of Hsp27 resulted in its dissociation from Akt. Additionally, the interaction between Hsp27 and Akt was necessary for activation of Akt in intact neutrophils. Constitutive neutrophil apoptosis was accelerated by sequestration of Hsp27 from Akt, and this enhanced rate of apoptosis was reversed by introduction of constitutively active recombinant Akt. Our results define a new mechanism by which Hsp27 regulates apoptosis, through control of Akt activity.

Neutrophils are constitutively committed to apoptosis from the time they enter the circulation (1Lee A. Whyte M.K. Haslett C. J.

The rate at which they undergo apoptosis is delayed by inflammatory products such as lipopolysaccharide, interleukin-8, leukotriene B4, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (4Klein J.B.

This delay of neutrophil apoptosis results in enhanced host defense; however, inappropriate delay of neutrophil apoptosis is associated with generalized inflammation and multiorgan failure of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (6Keel M.

The serine/threonine kinase, Akt, is a major target of PI-3K. Akt is present in the cytosol of unstimulated cells in a low activity conformation. Activation of PI-3K generates 3′-phosphorylated phosphoinositides that induce translocation of Akt to the plasma membrane (8Marte B.M. Downward J. Trends Biochem.

We reported previously that the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) substrate, MAPK-activated protein kinase-2 (MAPKAPK-2), phosphorylates and activates Akt and that Akt forms a signaling module containing p38 MAPK, MAPKAPK-2, and Hsp27 in human neutrophils (21Rane M.J.

Upon cellular stimulation Hsp27 dissociates from this module. A number of Akt substrates, including BAD, caspase 9, Iκα kinase, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (Ask1), and the forkhead transcription factors FKHR, FKHRL1, and AFX play a role in cell survival (22Datta S.R.

Lavoie J.N. Lambert H. Landry J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 20: 7602-7612Crossref Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Based on these data, Hsp27 was postulated to inhibit apoptosis through its activity as a molecular chaperone. Our previous report showing physical association and dissociation of Hsp27 and the Akt signaling module in human neutrophils suggested the hypothesis that Hsp27 modulates neutrophil apoptosis by control of Akt activation. In the present study we identify Hsp27 as an Akt substrate that dissociates from Akt upon phosphorylation. We demonstrate that disruption of the interaction between Hsp27 and Akt impairs Akt activation, leading to an enhanced rate of constitutive neutrophil apoptosis. These data provide evidence for a novel role of Hsp27 in the control of neutrophil apoptosis through regulation of Akt activity. fMLP and histone H2B were obtained from Sigma.

Isolation of Neutrophils and Culture Conditions—Neutrophils were isolated from venous blood obtained from healthy volunteers as described previously (5Klein J.B. Buridi A. Coxon P.Y. Rane M.J. Manning T. Kettritz R. McLeish K.R. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Neutrophil preparations routinely contained >95% neutrophils, as determined by morphology, and were >97% viable by trypan blue dye exclusion. Neutrophils were suspended in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin and incubated for the indicated times at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Western Blotting—Neutrophils were lysed in buffer containing 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 as described previously (21Rane M.J.

Introduction of Antibodies into Neutrophils—We used the method of Tezel and Wax (37Tezel G. Wax M.B. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3552-3562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to introduce antibodies into human neutrophils. Briefly, 2 × 107 neutrophils/200 μl of RPMI 1640 were prewarmed for 5 min at 37 °C and subjected to anti-Hsp27 antibody (20 μg) or isotype control antibody (20 μg) and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The neutrophils were washed three times and then resuspended in 1 ml of Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer containing 5.5 mm dextrose, pH 7.4 (KRPD). Measurement of Akt Kinase Activity—Akt kinase activity was measured by the ability of the immunoprecipitated enzyme to phosphorylate histone H2B, as described previously (21Rane M.J. Coxon P.Y.

After incubation with the indicated reagents, neutrophils were washed with KRPD and resuspended in 1 ml of KRPD and stimulated with 0.3 μm fMLP for 2 min. Neutrophils were then centrifuged at 2500 × g, and cells were lysed in buffer containing 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and cleared supernatants were incubated with 5 μl of anti-Akt antiserum, while rotating continuously for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by addition of 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose for an additional 1 h. Protein A-Sepharose beads were then washed once each in lysis buffer and kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2) and incubated in a 30-μl reaction mixture containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 85.7 μg/ml histone H2B, and kinase buffer. Following incubations at 25 °C for 30 min, the reactions were terminated by the addition of 6 μlof6× Laemmli buffer. The samples were boiled for 3 min, proteins separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and 32P incorporation visualized by autoradiography. Recombinant Active Kinase Phosphorylation of Hsp27—Active recombinant Akt (400 ng) or active recombinant MAPKAPK-2 (40 ng) was incubated in 30 μl of reaction mixture containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, recombinant Hsp27 (1 μg), and kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2). The reaction was terminated by adding 6 μl of 6× Laemmli buffer. For in vitro kinase reactions performed in the absence of radiolabeled ATP, active recombinant Akt (400 ng) was incubated in a 30-μl reaction mixture containing 1 μm ATP, 1 μg of recombinant Hsp27, 20 mm HEPES, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2. The reaction was terminated by boiling. This in vitro phosphorylated recombinant Hsp27 (25 ng) was added to 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose-coupled GST or GST-AKT to perform GST pull-down assays. Subcloning Hsp27 and Akt into GST Fusion Vectors—To create GST fusion proteins, Akt-wt was excised from pUSEAktwt (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) with restriction enzymes BamHI/PmeI and ligated into BamHI/SmaI sites of pGEX-4T-2 (Amersham Biosciences). Hsp27 was excised from pcDNA3.1Hsp27wt with restriction enzymes EcoRI/XhoI and ligated into EcoRI/XhoI sites of pGEX-5X-2 (Amersham Biosciences). All positive clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Preparation of GST, GST-Hsp27, and GST-Akt-Sepharose—GST-pGEX-4T-2, GST-Hsp27pGEX-4T-2, and GST-AktpGEX-5X-2 cDNAs were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)PlysS, and the expression and purification of GST and GST-Hsp27 were performed, as described previously (21Rane M.J.

GST Pull-down Assay—Neutrophils (2 × 107) were lysed with 200 μlof lysis buffer containing 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. GST or GST-Akt-Sepharose (20 μl) was added to the lysates and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with shaking. The beads were washed three times with Krebs+ buffer. The proteins were eluted from the beads by adding 40 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer. The samples were boiled for 3 min, and proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose and immunoblotted for Hsp27 and Akt, as described above. GST Pull-down Assay of Recombinant Proteins—GST, GST-Akt, or GST-Hsp27-Sepharose (20 μl) were added to 25 ng of recombinant protein and 50 μl of Krebs+ in a 0.5-ml Eppendorf tube. The samples were incubated with shaking at 4 °C for 1 h. Sepharose beads were precipitated by centrifugation and washed 6 times with Krebs+ buffer. Forty μl of 2× Laemmli buffer were added to each tube, the samples boiled for 3 min, and proteins separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose and immunoblotted for Hsp27 and Akt, as described above. FITC Conjugation of Anti-Hsp27—Two hundred μg of anti-Hsp27 dissolved in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline were mixed dropwise with 25 μl of N-hydroxysuccinimide-fluorescein (Pierce) from a 2 mm stock solution in Me2SO. The reaction vials were left on ice for 2 h. Unreacted fluorescein was removed by gel filtration using gel columns equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay. The fluorescein-labeled antibody was stored at 4 °C after adding 0.1% NaN3. Trypan Blue Quenching—Neutrophils (1 × 106) were suspended in 200 μl of Krebs+. FITC-conjugated anti-monoclonal Hsp27 and mouse isotype control antibodies were incubated with neutrophils at 37 °C for 4 h. The cells were then incubated with or without 200 μl of 0.02% trypan blue (TB) in 0.02 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.8, at room temperature (38Weersink A.J. Van Kessel K.P. Torensma R. Van Strijp J.A. Verhoef J. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 318-324PubMed Google Scholar). Following incubation, cells were pelleted by centrifugation. The supernatant was discarded, and cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1% sodium azide and 0.2% bovine serum albumin. The cells were resuspended in 0.02 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.8, and mixed gently by vortexing. Cells were filtered through a cheesecloth, and the cells were transferred into 12 × 75 mm polypropylene tubes. The percentage of FITC antibody inside the cell was determined by flow cytometry and calculated using Equation 1, &x0025;ofFITCantibodyinsidethecell=(A-bgr/B-bgr)×100&x0025;(Eq. 1) where A is the mean fluorescence after trypan blue quenching; B is the mean fluorescence measured in 0.02 m sodium acetate buffer, and bgr is the background fluorescence of control neutrophils (38Weersink A.J.

Introduction of Recombinant Akt and Anti-Hsp27 into Neutrophils— Protein transfection reagent BioPORTER was used to transfect constitutively active recombinant Akt and anti-Hsp27 antibody according to the manufacturer's protocol. BioPORTER reagent was dissolved in 250 μl of methanol. Five μl of BioPORTER suspension was aliquoted and allowed to air-dry for 3–4 h in the laminar flow hood. Anti-Hsp27 antibody alone (14.5 μg) or anti-Hsp27 antibody and constitutively active recombinant Akt (1 μg) were added to the dried BioPORTER. This mixture was incubated for 5 min at room temperature. The tubes were vortexed gently for 3–5 s at low speed. Neutrophils (1.6 × 106/100 μl in KRPD) were added and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C with shaking. After 4 h, the neutrophils were pelleted and transferred to Eppendorf tubes and washed in cold Krebs+. The cells were washed and resuspended in 300 μl of binding buffer (10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2) and assayed for annexin V binding assay. Annexin V Binding—Neutrophils were incubated with 10 μl of FITC-labeled ApopNexin at room temperature for 15 min in the dark. Cells were washed twice with binding buffer by centrifugation at 400 × g and then resuspended in binding buffer at a concentration of 1 × 106/ml. Two hundred μl of neutrophil cell suspension were placed in an 8-well confocal chamber and viewed by confocal microscopy or were transferred into 12 × 75 mm polypropylene tubes, and fluorescence was determined by flow cytometry. Akt Interacts Directly with Hsp27—We reported previously (21Rane M.J. Coxon P.Y. Powell D.W. Webster R. Klein J.B. Ping P. Pierce W. McLeish K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3517-3523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) that several members of the p38 MAPK signal transduction pathway, including p38 MAPK, MAPKAPK-2, and heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27), co-immunoprecipitated with Akt from neutrophil lysates. Stimulation by chemoattractants resulted in dissociation of Hsp27 from this complex. Hsp27 is known to associate with and be phosphorylated by MAPKAPK-2 (40Stokoe D. Engel K. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Gaestel M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that Hsp27 association with the Akt signaling module resulted from direct interaction with MAPKAPK-2, not with Akt. To define the protein-protein interactions within the module, the ability of recombinant Hsp27 to bind Akt directly was determined by GST pull-down assays. Recombinant Hsp27 was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose coupled to GST or GST-Akt. Fig. 1A shows an immunoblot of this precipitate for Hsp27 demonstrating that recombinant Hsp27 bound to GST-Akt (lane 2) but not to GST alone (lane 1). To confirm this interaction, recombinant Akt was precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose coupled to GST or GST-Hsp27. Fig. 1B shows that recombinant Akt bound to GST-Hsp27 (lane 2) but not GST alone (lane 1). In each case equivalent amounts of recombinant protein were added, as shown in lane 3. These results indicate a direct in vitro interaction between Hsp27 and Akt. Akt Phosphorylates Hsp27—The ability of Akt to interact directly with Hsp27 suggested the possibility that Akt phosphorylated Hsp27. A manual search of the Hsp27 amino acid sequence failed to identify a consensus RXRXX(S/T) Akt phosphorylation motif. On the other hand, a web-based motif analysis software (SCANSITE) predicted low stringency Akt phosphorylation sites on Hsp27 at Ser-9, Ser-15, Ser-78, and Ser-82 and a high stringency site at Thr-143 (41Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Lai J. Obata T. Volinia S. Cantley L.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, the ability of active recombinant Akt to phosphorylate recombinant Hsp27 in the presence or absence of an Akt inhibitory peptide or a scrambled peptide was examined in an in vitro kinase assay. The Akt inhibitory peptide (Aktide-2T) was described previously by Obata et al. (36Obata T. Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Piro E.T. Maegawa H. Kashiwagi A. Kikkawa R. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36108-36115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) and mimics the optimal phosphorylation sequence of Akt. Fig. 2A shows that Akt phosphorylated Hsp27 (lane 2), and this phosphorylation was inhibited by addition of 20 μm Akt inhibitory peptide (lane 4) but not 20 μm scrambled peptide (lane 3). Equal loading of recombinant Hsp27 was demonstrated by Coomassie Blue staining of the gels. MAPKAPK-2 was shown previously to phosphorylate Hsp27 on Ser-15, Ser-78, and Ser-82 (40Stokoe D. Engel K. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Gaestel M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). To determine whether Akt and MAPKAPK-2 share phosphorylation sites, an in vitro kinase assay with recombinant Hsp27 and active recombinant MAPKAPK-2 or active recombinant Akt was performed. The samples were subjected to immunoblot analysis with phosphospecific Hsp27 antibodies. Separate gels were used to measure anti-Ser(P)-82 (Fig. 2B, gel 1), anti-Ser(P)-78 (gel 2), and anti-Ser(P)-15 (gel 3)-Hsp27 antibody binding. Fig. 2B demonstrates that MAPKAPK-2 phosphorylates Ser-82 (panel 1, lane 4), Ser-78 (panel 3, lane 4), and Ser-15 (panel 5, lane 4), whereas Akt phosphorylates only Ser-82 (panel 1, lane 2). Each gel was stripped and reprobed for total Hsp27 to ensure equal loading of recombinant Hsp27 (Fig. 2B, panels 2, 4, and 6). To determine whether Akt phosphorylates Hsp27 in intact cells, HEK-293 cells were co-transfected with pUSE and pcDNA3.0 vectors or with c-Myc-tagged constitutively active myristoylated-Akt (pUSEAkt-CA) and wild type Hsp27 (pcDNAHsp27-WT). Post-transfection cells were lysed and subjected to immunoblot analysis with phospho-specific Hsp27 antibodies. Separate gels were used for anti-Ser(P)-82 (gel 1), anti-Ser(P)-78 (gel 2), and anti-Ser(P)-15 (gel 3)-Hsp27 antibodies (Fig. 3). As MAPKAPK-2 phosphorylates Hsp27 on Ser-15, Ser-78, and Ser-82, recombinant Hsp27 phosphorylated in vitro by active recombinant MAPKAPK-2 was included on each gel as a positive control (Fig. 3, lane 3). Cells co-transfected with Akt-CA and Hsp27-wt exhibited phosphorylation of Hsp27 on Ser-82 but not on Ser-78 or Ser-15. No phosphorylation was detected in vector-transfected cells. Active recombinant MAPKAPK-2 phosphorylated recombinant Hsp27 on Ser-82, Ser-78, and Ser-15 as expected (Fig. 3, lane 3). Each gel was stripped and reprobed with anti-Hsp27 and anti-c-Myc antibodies to confirm overexpression of AktCA and Hsp27 (Fig. 3, panels 1 and 2). These findings indicate that Akt phosphorylates Hsp27 on Ser-82 but not on Ser-15 or Ser-78, both in intact cells and in vitro. The absence of phosphorylation of Ser-15 and Ser-78 shows that MAPKAPK-2 was not active in these transfected cells. Phosphorylation of Hsp27 Regulates Association with the Akt Signal Module—We showed previously that Hsp27 dissociated from the Akt complex following neutrophil stimulation with chemoattractants (21Rane M.J. Coxon P.Y. Powell D.W. Webster R. Klein J.B. Ping P. Pierce W. McLeish K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3517-3523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), suggesting that Hsp27 phosphorylation might regulate interaction with Akt. To test this hypothesis, HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1-Hsp27 constructs containing wild type (Hsp27-wt), Hsp27-3A in which Ser-15, -78, and -82 were mutated to alanines, or Hsp27-3D in which all three serine residues were mutated to aspartic acid. Hsp27-3A acts as a phosphorylationdead mutant, whereas Hsp27-3D acts as a phosphorylation-mimicking mutant. At 24 h cells were lysed, and the lysate was subjected to a GST-Akt pull-down assay. The precipitated proteins were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-Hsp27 antibody (Fig. 4A, panel 2). Increased Hsp27 binding to GST-Akt was observed in cell lysates from Hsp27-wt and Hsp27-3A-transfected cells. The similar amounts of Hsp27 precipitated by GST-Akt in vector and Hsp27-3D-transfected cells were attributed to endogenous Hsp27. Precipitated proteins were also subjected to immunoblot analysis for Akt to ensure that equal amounts of GST-Akt-Sepharose beads were added to each lysate (Fig. 4A,"

We studied a system of forested lake islands in the boreal zone of Sweden for which fire frequency increases with increasing island size. Large islands supported higher plant productivity and litter decomposition rates than did smaller ones, and, with increasing time since fire, litter decomposition rates were suppressed sooner than was ecosystem productivity. This contributes to greater carbon storage with increasing time since fire; for every century without a major fire, an additional 0.5 kilograms per square meter of carbon becomes stored in the humus."

When early passage hMSCs are plated or replated at low density, the cultures display a lag phase of 3–5 days, a phase of rapid exponential growth, and then enter a stationary phase without the cultures reaching confluence. We found that as the cultures leave the lag phase, they secrete high levels of dickkopf-1 (Dkk-1), an inhibitor of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. The addition of recombinant Dkk-1 toward the end of the lag period increased proliferation and decreased the cellular concentration of β-catenin. The addition of antibodies to Dkk-1 in the early log phase decreased proliferation. Also, expression of Dkk-1 in hMSCs decreased during cell cycle arrest induced by serum starvation. The results indicated that high levels of Dkk-1 allow the cells to reenter the cell cycle by inhibiting the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Since antibodies to Dkk-1 also increased the lag phase of an osteosarcoma line that expressed the gene, Dkk-1 may have a similar role in some other cell systems.

Although some of the in vitro growth characteristics of hMSCs have been documented, the molecular mechanisms by which hMSCs regulate their own growth in culture are poorly understood. In particular, there is no apparent explanation for the observation that when early passage hMSCs are replated at low density, they display a lag period of 3–5 days, followed by a phase of rapid exponential growth, and then enter a stationary phase without reaching confluence (8Sekiya I.

Ph.D. thesis, Tulane University, New Orleans, LAGoogle Scholar) suggested to us that conditioned medium from cultures of hMSCs increased the rate of proliferation when added to freshly plated cultures of hMSCs. In the experiments described here, we demonstrate that hMSCs in the early log phase of growth synthesize and secrete dickkopf-1 (Dkk-1), an inhibitor of the canonical Wnt pathway (16Glinka A Wu W.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar). The signaling can occur by at least three different pathways (20Huelsken J. Birchmeier W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). In the canonical pathway, Wnt ligands bind to the transmembrane receptor frizzled and the co-receptor lipoprotein-related proteins 5 and 6 (LRP-5/6). Activation of frizzled recruits the cytoplasmic bridging molecule, disheveled, so as to inhibit glycogen synthetase kinase 3. Inhibition of glycogen synthetase kinase 3 decreases phosphorylation of β-catenin, preventing its degradation by the ubiquitin-mediated pathway (20Huelsken J. Birchmeier W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 21Kikuchi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The stabilized β-catenin translocates to the nucleus, where it complexes with transcription factors that promote either differentiation or proliferation (22Van Noort M. Clevers H. Dev. Biol. 2002; 244: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 23Pandur P. Maurus D. Kuhl M. Bioessays. 2002; 24: 881-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Also, the β-catenin stabilizes adherens junctions (24Nagafuchi A. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 2001; 13: 600-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The binding of Dkk-1 to LRP-5/6 and to the associated protein kremen dissociates LRP-5/6 from frizzled and thereby prevents the formation of a functional Wnt receptor complex (25Mao J. Wang J. Liu B.

The effects of Wnt signaling, however, are complex in part because some members of the family of Wnt ligands can trigger signaling through noncanonical pathways involving Jun/Jun kinase (JNK) or calcium ion regulation (20Huelsken J. Birchmeier W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). For example, alternative signaling through the canonical Wnt/β-catenin and the noncanonical Wnt/Ca2+ pathways in Xenopus produced antagonistic regulation of covergent extension movements during gastrulation. Also, alternative signaling through Wnt and two different frizzled receptors in Drosophila drove either epithelial planar polarity or morphogenesis by activating different regions of the same disheveled bridging molecule (39Boutros M. Paricio N. Strutt D.I. Mlodzik M. Cell. 1998; 94: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). In addition, a second dickkopf-2 (Dkk-2) activated instead of inhibited Wnt/β-catenin signaling in Xenopus (40Wu W. Glinka A. Delius H. Niehrs C. Curr.

The results presented here demonstrate that after stationary phase, when hMSCs are replated at clonal densities, synthesis of the Wnt inhibitor Dkk-1 allows cells to reenter the cell cycle by inhibiting the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Tissue Culture—Bone marrow aspirates of about 2 ml were drawn from healthy donors ranging in age from 19 to 49 years under an Institutional Review Board-approved protocol. Plastic adherent nucleated cells were separated from the aspirate and cultured as previously described (8Sekiya I. Vuoristo J.T. Larson B.L. Prockop D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

After 14 days in culture, adherent cells were recovered from the monolayer by incubation with 0.25% (w/v) trypsin and 1 mm EDTA (Fisher) for 5–7 min at 37 °C and replated at a density of 100 cells/cm2. The cells were then cultured for various times with changes of medium every 2–3 days. Cells were radiolabeled at the indicated intervals by the addition of new medium containing 5 μCi of ml–1 35S-labeled methionine (Amersham Biosciences). The cultures were allowed to incorporate the label for 48 h, followed by recovery of the cells and media. The labeling and inhibitor experiments were repeated with hMSCs from three donors. Nordihydroguatiaretic acid was purchased from Sigma. Cell lines MG-63, SAOS, JAR, and JEG-3 were acquired from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were expanded in accordance with their protocols. For experiments, the cells were cultured in hMSC complete medium (α-minimal essential medium, 20% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 units ml–1 penicillin, 100 μg ml–1 streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine). Preparation of Labeled Media and Cell Extracts—To remove unwanted cells and debris, the media were filtered through a 0.22-μm2 pore size membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). To remove unincorporated [35S]methionine, the medium was diafiltered against 10 volumes of PBS (Sigma) using a tangential flow filtration system fitted with 150-cm2 polyvinylidene difluoride 5-kDa filters (Millipore). Cells were counted with a hemacytometer, followed by lysis in PBS containing 0.01% (w/v) SDS (Sigma). The cell lysates were dialyzed against 1000 volumes of 1× PBS for 24 h using 3500-Da limiting dialysis cassettes (Pierce). Radioactivity was assayed by liquid scintillation counting using 30% scintillant (Scintisafe; Fisher). Electrophoretic Analysis and Western Blotting—Unless otherwise stated, electrophoresis was carried out using commercial reagents and systems (Novex; Invitrogen). Two μl of medium were added to 5 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and 1 μl of 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). The samples were heated at 100 °C for 2 min and electrophoresed on a 4–12% NuPage bis-Tris gel using the MES buffering system. In some experiments, samples were loaded in triplicate and at different dilutions to assess aberrant migration due to the presence of excessive serum albumin. Gels were either silver-stained (Silver Quest Staining Kit; Invitrogen) or blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride filters for autoradiography and immunoblotting. For autoradiographic analysis, filters were air-dried and exposed to autoradiography film (Kodak Biomax MR; Sigma). After a 2-day exposure, the film was automatically developed using a commercial instrument and reagents (AGFA Corp.). For immunoblotting, filters were blocked in PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (Sigma) for 1 h. For detection of β-catenin, blots were probed with an anti-β-catenin monoclonal antibody at a dilution of 1:1000 (clone 5H10; Chemicon International, Temecula, CA). For detection of Dkk-1, blots were probed in 1 μgml–1 of anti-Dkk-1 polyclonal antibody (see below) followed by an anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal antibody (clone RG 96; Sigma). For detection of the polyhistidine tag, blots were probed with a peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal antibody at a dilution of 1:1000 (clone his-10; Sigma). For detection of Jun and phospho-Jun polyclonal antibodies, SC 45 and SC 16312 were used (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at a 1:100 dilution. VCAM was detected with the monoclonal antibody (clone MAB2143; Chemicon International). For detection of actin, blots were probed with a monoclonal antibody at a dilution of 1:1000 (clone AC-10; Sigma). For detection of GAPDH, blots were probed with a monoclonal antibody at a dilution of 1:1000 (clone 6C5; Chemicon International). All unconjugated monoclonal antibodies were detected with an anti-mouse horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit serum (Sigma), and unless otherwise stated, polyclonal antisera were detected by either goat anti-rabbit or rabbit anti-goat horseradish peroxidase conjugates (Sigma). Positive bands were detected by chemiluminescence in accordance with a previously described procedure (42Spees J.L. Chang S.A. Snyder M.J. Chang E.S. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2002; 7: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) using an imaging system to detect and quantify the signal (Typhoon Imaging System; Amersham Biosciences). Equal sample loading for Western blots was confirmed by Bradford protein assay (Sigma) and measuring cell number. Equal transfer to the membrane was confirmed by Ponceau S staining (Sigma). Western blots and autoradiographic analyses were repeated using hMSCs from at least two donors. Blots were stripped using the Blot Restore kit (Chemicon International). Electroelution and Tryptic Fingerprinting of Bands—200 μl of 5-fold concentrated radiolabeled medium were separated by electrophoresis on a 4–20% polyacrylamide Tris-glycine preparative gel (Invitrogen). 15 fractions were laterally electroeluted into 1 ml of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0) using a whole gel eluter system (Bio-Rad). The fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by 10-fold concentration by rotary evaporation (Savant AES 2010 Rotary Evaporation System; Savant Inc., Holbrook, NY). Samples were proteolytically digested in 50-μl reactions containing 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0) in the presence of 5 ng of agarose-coupled trypsin (Sigma). The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 16 h followed by removal of the trypsin by centrifugation. Analysis by mass spectrometry was carried out using commercial instruments and reagents (Ciphergen Biosystems Inc., Freemont, CA). Aliquots (2 μl) of digested samples were mixed with 2 μl of a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in acetonitrile. The mixture was air-dried onto silica-coated aluminum mass spectrometry chips and analyzed using a PBS II SELDI-TOF chip reader. The program PeptIdent (43Wilkins M.R. Williams K.L. J. Theor. Biol. 1997; 186: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) was used to analyze triplicate data sets and appropriate controls with settings for the detection of acrylcisteinyl groups and oxidized methionine residues. Both the Swiss Prot and TREMBL databases were searched. Data were reproduced using samples from three donors. Antibody Production and Purification—A 15-residue peptide corresponding to a sequence in the second cysteine-rich domain of Dkk-1 (17Fedi P. Bafico A. Nieto S. Burgess W.H. Miki T. Bottaro D.P. Kraus M.K. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19465-19472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), ARHFWSKICKPVLKE, was synthesized and conjugated to key-hole limpet hemocyanin (Sigma). The conjugated peptide was used to immunize two New Zealand White rabbits. Antibodies were purified from 20-ml aliquots of postimmune serum by affinity chromatography against the immunizing peptide. Briefly, 5 mg of peptide at a concentration of 1 mg ml–1 in 100 mm sodium bicarbonate (pH 8.2) was cycled through a 1-ml N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) for 16 h at a flow rate of 1 ml min–1. The column was then blocked with 500 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and washed with PBS. For antibody purification, 50 ml of a 5 mg ml–1 solution of postimmune rabbit serum was cycled through the peptide-coupled column for 5 h. The column was then washed with 50 ml of PBS following elution of the polyclonal antibodies in 0.5-ml fractions with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.0. The fractions were adjusted to pH 7.4 with 100 mm Tris-HCl and then visualized by SDS-PAGE prior to use. Using a similar protocol, Dkk-1 was immunoaffinity-purified from 50 ml of conditioned medium by affinity chromatography using antibody-coupled N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose. Production of Recombinant Dkk-1—The cDNA encoding human Dkk-1 (17Fedi P. Bafico A. Nieto S. Burgess W.H. Miki T. Bottaro D.P. Kraus M.K. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19465-19472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) was prepared by RT-PCR using mRNA from hMSCs (see below). The cDNA was cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pET 16b using standard protocols and reagents (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The construct was transformed into BL 21 (λDE3) Escherichia coli. Unless otherwise stated, all biochemical reagents for the production of recombinant Dkk-1 were acquired from Fisher. A saturated culture of the transformed bacteria was prepared in 50 ml of LB broth containing 100 μg ml–1 ampicillin. The overnight culture was added to 1 liter of fresh LB medium with ampicillin and allowed to grow to an optical density (600 nm) of 0.6. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.4 mm to induce expression of Dkk-1. After 4 h, the cells were harvested, resuspended in wash buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% (w/v) deoxycholic acid, and 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and then lysed by sonication. Inclusion bodies were washed three times by centrifugation in wash buffer and sonicated into 50 ml of 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 6 m urea, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. The inclusion body solution was added to 4 liters of refolding solution (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 2% (w/v) N-lauryl sarcosine, 8% (v/v) glycerol, 100 μm NiCl2, 0.001% (v/v) H2O2) and incubated for 48 h at 4 °C with vigorous stirring. The sample was filtered through a 0.22-μm2 membrane and concentrated to 200 ml by diafiltration using a tangential flow filtration system fitted with 150-cm2 polyvinylidene difluoride 5-kDa filters (Millipore Corp.). The sample was diafiltered against 40 volumes of 100 mm l-arginine HCl (pH 8.7). Histidine-tagged recombinant Dkk-1 was purified by metal ion affinity chromatography as described elsewhere (44Gregory, C. A. (1999) Structural and Functional Studies on Recombinant Human Non-collagenous Carboxyl Terminal (NC1) Domain of Human Type X Collagen. Ph.D. thesis, University of Manchester, UKGoogle Scholar) and then dialyzed into 20 mm ammonium carbonate at pH 8.7. The pure, dialyzed protein was dried by rotary evaporation (Savant AES 2010 Rotary Evaporation System) in 10-μg aliquots and stored at –80 °C. For tissue culture studies, each aliquot was resuspended in 1 ml of α-minimal essential medium containing 10% (v/v) FCS. Analysis of Colony Size and Proliferation—hMSCs were plated at about 0.6 cells/cm2 and incubated in complete medium for 17 days. For direct visualization of colonies, a 5% (w/v) solution of crystal violet in methanol (Sigma) was added to tissue culture dishes previously washed twice with PBS. After 20 min, the plates were washed with distilled water and air-dried. Stained colonies with diameters of 2 mm or greater were counted. For assay of proliferation, cells were also quantified by fluorescent labeling of nucleic acids (CyQuant dye; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). hMSCs were plated at 100 cells/cm2 into 10-cm2 wells and allowed to grow for 4 days. The cells were washed with PBS, and medium was added containing the appropriate concentration of Dkk-1 and FCS. The cells were recovered by trypsinization as described above. Fluorescence analysis was carried out using a microplate fluorescence reader (FLX800; Bio-Tek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT) set to 480-nm excitation and 520-nm emission. Data were statistically analyzed using the two-tailed Student's t test. Experiments were repeated using hMSCs from two donors. Quantitative RT-PCR Analysis—Extraction of total mRNA was carried out from 1 million cells (High Pure; Roche Diagnostics). A one-tube RT-PCR (Titan; Roche Diagnostics) was employed for the synthesis of cDNA and PCR amplification. The following primers were designed for amplification: ccttctcatatgatggctctgggcgcagcggga (sense) and cctggaggtttagtgtctctgacaagtgtggaa (antisense) (for Dkk-1); catatggccgcgttgatgcggagcaaggat (sense) and cctaggtcaaattttctgacacacatggag (antisense) (for Dkk-2); agccatatgcagcggcttggggccacc (sense) and cctaggctaaatctcttcccctcccag (antisense) (for Dkk-3); tgacatatggtggcggccgtcctgctg (sense) and cctaggtttatagcttttctattttttggc (antisense) (for Dkk-4); and ccccttcattgacctcaact (sense) and cgaccgtaacgggagttgct (antisense) (for GAPDH). Reactions were carried out on a thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems 9700; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to the following parameters: initial cDNA synthesis, 50 °C for 45 min; denaturation, 95 °C for 1 min; annealing, 52 °C for 1 min; and extension, 72 °C for 1 min for 28 cycles. Positive controls were total RNA extracted from human neuronal progenitor cells for Dkk-3 (Clonexpress, Gaithersburg, MD) and human placental RNA for other Dkk cDNAs (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The primers gtgcaatgtcttccaagttctt (sense) and atgagccggacaccccatggca (antisense) were used to amplify Wnt-5a under identical conditions to those used to amplify Dkk cDNA. Amplification of LRP-6 was achieved using the following primers: ccacaggccaccaatacagtt (sense) and tccggaggagtctgtacagggaga (antisense). Reactions were carried out to the following parameters on a thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems 9700): initial cDNA synthesis, 57 °C for 55 min; denaturation, 95 °C for 2 min; annealing, 55 °C for 1 min; and extension, 72 °C for 1 min for 30 cycles. For LRP cDNAs, control mRNA was prepared from JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells. Samples were analyzed by Tris borate EDTA-PAGE using commercial systems and reagents (Novex; Invitrogen) followed by ethidium bromide staining (Sigma). VCAM-1 mRNA was detected by RT-PCR using a similar one-tube protocol to the one described above. The following amplimers were used: primer A, tgggaacgaacactcttacc (sense); primer B, aatccacgtggagatctact (sense); primer C, ttctcaaaactcacagggct (antisense); and primer D, tggattcccttttccagt (antisense). Combinations of the amplimers were used to amplify VCAM-1 cDNA to the following parameters on a thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems 9700): initial cDNA synthesis, 50 °C for 45 min; denaturation, 95 °C for 1 min; annealing, 50 °C for 1 min; and extension, 72 °C for 1 min for 30 cycles. The expected products are 869, 809, 929, and 869 bp for amplimer combinations AC, BC, AD, and BD, respectively. A previously described hybridization ELISA assay (45Gregory C.A. Rigg G.P. Illidge C.M. Matthews R.C. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) was employed to compare the expression of Dkk-1, Wnt-5a, LRP-6, and VCAM-1 over time in culture. Where equal ratios of sample/GAPDH signal were achieved for different multiple different amounts of RNA template, the RT-PCR ELISA measurements were considered linear. The following biotinylated oligonucleotides were designed for the ELISA: Dkk-1, biotin-atagcaccttggatgggtatt; GAPDH, biotin-catgccatcactgccacccag; Wnt-5a, biotin-tcttggtggtcgctaggtat; LRP-6, biotin-gtgcctcttggttatgtgccact; and VCAM-1, biotin-cagggagggtctaccagctc. Similar results were generated using hMSCs from three donors. Microarray Transcript Analysis—Experimental procedures for GeneChip microarray were performed according to the Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). In brief, 8 μg of total RNA was used to synthesize double-stranded DNA (Superscript Choice System; Invitrogen). The DNA was purified by"
https://openalex.org/W2003183940,"Radio-frequency techniques were used to study ultracold fermions. We observed the absence of mean-field ""clock"" shifts, the dominant source of systematic error in current atomic clocks based on bosonic atoms. This absence is a direct consequence of fermionic antisymmetry. Resonance shifts proportional to interaction strengths were observed in a three-level system. However, in the strongly interacting regime, these shifts became very small, reflecting the quantum unitarity limit and many-body effects. This insight into an interacting Fermi gas is relevant for the quest to observe superfluidity in this system."
https://openalex.org/W2066040214,"The splicing factor SF3b is a multiprotein complex essential for the accurate excision of introns from pre-messenger RNA. As an integral component of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) and the U11/U12 di-snRNP, SF3b is involved in the recognition of the pre-messenger RNA's branch site within the major and minor spliceosomes. We have determined the three-dimensional structure of the human SF3b complex by single-particle electron cryomicroscopy at a resolution of less than 10 angstroms, allowing identification of protein domains with known structural folds. The best fit of a modeled RNA-recognition motif indicates that the protein p14 is located in the central cavity of the complex. The 22 tandem helical repeats of the protein SF3b155 are located in the outer shell of the complex enclosing p14."
https://openalex.org/W1973469920,"Although the phosphorylation-dependent activation of the Na-K-Cl cotransporter (NKCC1) has been previously well documented, the identity of the kinase(s) responsible for this regulation has proven elusive. Recently, Piechotta et al. (Piechotta, K., Lu, J., and Delpire, E. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 50812–50819) reported the binding of PASK (also referred as SPAK (STE20/SPS1-related proline-alanine-rich kinase)) and OSR1 (oxidative stress response kinase) to cation-chloride cotransporters KCC3, NKCC1, and NKCC2. In this report, we show that overexpression of a kinase inactive, dominant negative (DN) PASK mutant drastically reduces both shark (60 ± 5%) and human (80 ± 3%) NKCC1 activation. Overexpression of wild type PASK causes a small (sNKCC1 22 ± 8% p < 0.05, hNKCC1 12 ± 3% p < 0.01) but significant increase in shark and human cotransporter activity in HEK cells. Importantly, DNPASK also inhibits the phosphorylation of two threonines, contained in the previously described N-terminal regulatory domain. We additionally show the near complete restoration of NKCC1 activity in the presence of the protein phosphatase type 1 inhibitor calyculin A, demonstrating that DNPASK inhibition results from an alteration in kinase/phosphatase dynamics rather than from a decrease in functional cotransporter expression. Coimmunoprecipitation assays confirm PASK binding to NKCC1 in transfected HEK cells and further suggest that this binding is not a regulated event; neither PASK nor NKCC1 activity affects the association. In cells preloaded with 32Pi, the phosphorylation of PASK, but not DNPASK, coincides with that of NKCC1 and increases 5.5 ± 0.36-fold in low [Cl]e. These data conclusively link PASK with the phosphorylation and activation of NKCC1.

Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25438-25443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kurihara K. Moore-Hoon M.L. Saitoh M. Turner R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C1184-C1193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our current model suggests a low intracellular chloride concentration and/or a reduction in cell volume as the principle stimulus for NKCC1 activation. The kinase(s) mediating this activation, however, has remained obscure. Our laboratory has previously identified three threonines on the N terminus of the Na-K-Cl cotransporter that modulate activity, highlighting Thr189 (numbering in shark) as essential for cotransporter function (3Darman R.B. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37542-37550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). A phosphospecific antibody specifically recognizes two of these phosphothreonines (Thr184, Thr189) and has proven to be a powerful tool in discerning the activation state of NKCC1 in cells and tissue (4Flemmer A.W. Gimenez I. Dowd B.F. Darman R.B. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37551-37558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). This regulatory domain resides in one of three highly conserved regions on the N terminus and was shown to mediate the activation of NKCC1 in species ranging from shark to human (4Flemmer A.W. Gimenez I. Dowd B.F. Darman R.B. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37551-37558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Another of these N-terminal conserved regions has recently been identified by our laboratory as a protein phosphatase type 1 binding site (RVXFXD) (5Darman R.B. Flemmer A. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34359-34362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Mutation of this site to either enhance or disrupt protein phosphatase type 1 binding significantly alters the activation profile of NKCC1. Recently, the significance of the third conserved domain in the NKCC1 N terminus was suggested by studies of Piechotta et al. (6Piechotta K. Lu J. Delpire E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50812-50819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). This 10-amino acid region contains an (R/K)FX(V/I) sequence that was found to bind the proline alanine-rich STE20-related kinase (PASK) and the highly homologous (67% identical) oxidative stress response kinase (OSR1) in yeast two-hybrid and GST pull-down assays. An additional binding motif is found 54 residues downstream (6Piechotta K. Lu J. Delpire E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50812-50819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), overlapping the previously described protein phosphatase type 1 binding site (5Darman R.B. Flemmer A. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34359-34362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To date no functional effect of PASK upon NKCC1 has been identified. The direct binding of this kinase, possibly with the resultant disruption of its regulatory phosphatase, made PASK an attractive candidate for NKCC regulation. In addition, the high expression of PASK in solute-transporting epithelia (7Ushiro H. Tsutsumi T. Suzuki K. Kayahara T. Nakano K. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) parallels that of NKCC1. A number of protein kinases have been previously discussed in conjunction with NKCC1 activation. Human NKCC1 contains known consensus phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C, casein kinase II, and protein kinase A, but none of these has been directly linked to NKCC1 activation. The inhibition of myosin light chain kinase has been shown to inhibit NKCC1 function, but it does not affect NKCC1 phosphorylation and has been proposed to act indirectly through cytoskeletal disruption (8Klein J.D. O'Neill W.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1524-C1531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Serum- and glucocorticoid-dependent kinase has been suggested to mediate an increase in NKCC1 activity via an increase of cotransporter insertion into the cell membrane but has not been shown to directly activate functional NKCC1 (9Fillon S. Warntges S. Matskevitch J. Moschen I. Setiawan I. Gamper N. Feng Y.X. Stegen C. Friedrich B. Waldegger S. Broer S. Wagner C.A. Huber S.M. Klingel K. Vereninov A. Lang F. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A.

Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). First isolated from rat brain, PASK was found to be heavily expressed in epithelial cells active in ion transport and to associate with the cytoskeleton (7Ushiro H. Tsutsumi T. Suzuki K. Kayahara T.

The only demonstrated biological function for this kinase was reported for Fray, the Drosophila PASK homologue, which was shown to be expressed in glial cells and required for the proper ensheathing neighboring axons (13Leiserson W.M.

In this report, we describe the regulation of NKCC1 by PASK in transfected HEK cells. We show that overexpression of PASK causes a small but significant increase in NKCC1 activity. We also show that a dominant-negative PASK mutant drastically inhibits shark and human NKCC1 activation. This inhibition is via a decrease in NKCC1 regulatory phosphorylation, not a decrease in number of functional cotransporter molecules or a down-regulation in expression. We also show that PASK phosphorylation parallels that of NKCC1 in low [Cl]e and that binding of the kinase does not appear to be regulated by or dependent upon the activation state of PASK or NKCC1. cDNA Constructs and the Production of Stable Cell Lines—The rat PASK clone was HA-tagged on the N terminus and subcloned into the pIRES puro3 vector (Invitrogen) using PCR. Briefly, a forward primer (p1) containing the HA antigen and EcoR1 site (ggaattccatgtacccatacgacgtcccagactacgctATGGCGGAGCCGAGCGGCTCG) (the PASK sequence is in uppercase) and reverse primer (p2) containing a stop codon and BamH1 site (cgggatccTCAGCTCACACTCAACTGGGCGAAC) were used in a PCR reaction with pGST-PASK as a template (a kind gift of William Leiserson) (7Ushiro H. Tsutsumi T. Suzuki K. Kayahara T. Nakano K. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The PCR product was then subcloned into the pIRES puro3 vector using EcoR1 and BamH1. The dominant negative, kinase inactive K101R PASK was created using a two-step PCR approach. First, an internal primer (p3) (CGCGTAGCCATAAgGCGGATCAACTTG) and its reverse complement (p4) (CAAGTTGATCCGCcTTATGGCTACGCG) were created containing a single nucleotide substitution to produce the K101R mutation (mutation in lowercase). PCR reactions were completed using p1/p4 and p2/p3 primer combinations. After gel purification of the two products, equal amounts were subjected to five cycles of PCR with Pfu polymerase but without primers (for extension). The p1 and p2 primers were then added to amplify the full-length mutant. Subcloning into pIRES puro3 (Clontech) was completed as described above. Sequence verification was completed by the Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory DNA Sequencing Center. For most experiments a shark protein kinase (sMST1/2) 3Accession number AY242842. This protein contains 83 and 79% identity to human MST1 and MST2 respectively. with significant homology to mammalian MST1 (accession number AAA83254) and MST2 (accession number 2204254A) was used as a control in addition to vector-transfected cells. We identified MST1/2 in an expression screen of a λ phage shark kidney library. This kinase identification assay was adapted from a method previously described by Matsuo et al. (14Matsuo R. Ochiai W. Nakashima K. Taga T. J. Immunol. Methods. 2001; 247: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Using the previously described phosphospecific Thr184/Thr189 NKCC antibody (R5) (4Flemmer A.W. Gimenez I. Dowd B.F. Darman R.B. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37551-37558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) candidates were selected for their ability to phosphorylate a 15-amino acid GST fusion tandem-repeat protein containing the Thr184/Thr189 residues residing within the previously described N-terminal regulatory domain of NKCC1 (GST-YYLRTFGHNTMDAVP YYLRTFGHNTMDAVP; the Thr residues in shown bold are at positions 184, 189, 184, and 189, respectively). MST1/2 was identified in this screen, but subsequent experiments failed to support an important role for the kinase in NKCC1 regulation, and we have utilized it as a control enzyme in the current study. Interestingly, like PASK, MST1/2 is a member of the germinal center kinase family of STE20 kinases. In addition, the kinase domain of MST1/2 retains a high homology (40%) to PASK, and both kinases contain putative caspase 3 cleavage sites and nuclear localization signals (11Johnston A.M. Naselli G.

IRES puro3 vector (Clontech) containing PASK, dominant negative mutant (DNPASK), or shark MST1/2 were transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) into various HEK stable clonal cell lines, all carrying the Geneticin resistance marker and previously described (15Xu J.C.

Cells were selected and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 μg/ml puromycin (Clontech), and 0.8 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). With the use of the IRES vector, clonal selection was not needed in isolation of stable lines. The IRES vector is herein referred to as “vector 2,” whereas the pJB20 vector used for sNKCC1 and hNKCC1 expression is referred to as “vector 1.” 86Rb + Influx Assays—Influx assays to assess NKCC1 cotransport activity were performed as previously described using an automated 96-well plate flux machine (3Darman R.B. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37542-37550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). For calyculin A time courses, the compound was dissolved in Me2SO and diluted into the appropriate preincubation media with a final concentration of ∼500 nm at specific time points before the flux assay. The flux time was 2 min for exogenously expressed cell lines (sNKCC1 and hNKCC1) and 8 min for the measurement of endogenous NKCC1 activity. 32P Incorporation and Coimmunoprecipitation Experiments—Near confluent 10-cm dishes were rinsed with phosphate-free isotonic media (135 mm NaCl, 5 mm RbCl, 1 mm CaCl2/MgCl2, and 15 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.4) and incubated with 250 μCi of 32Pi for 20 min. Cells were then rinsed 2× with either phosphate-free isotonic or phosphate-free 3 mm Cl– with gluconate replacement (135 mm sodium gluconate, 5 mm potassium gluconate, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm NaSO4) media for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were lysed on ice in 1 ml of lysis buffer (300 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5 μm calyculin A, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) and centrifuged to remove debris. Bovine serum albumin (0.25% final concentration) and 5 μg of antibody were added before a 2-h incubation at 4 °C. Protein G beads (Pierce) were blocked in 5% milk/phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, washed in lysis buffer, added to lysate, and incubated at 4 °C for an additional hour. Immunocomplexed beads were washed 3× in ice-cold wash buffer (lysis buffer without calyculin A and protease inhibitors) and 1× in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Sample buffer with 2-mercaptoethanol was added before boiling. Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE using a 10% acrylamide gel. Western blotting was completed as previously described (4Flemmer A.W. Gimenez I. Dowd B.F. Darman R.B. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37551-37558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). For protein determinations of 96-well flux plates, cells were solubilized with 1% SDS after being exposed to phosphorimaging plates, and the DC-BCA kit (Pierce) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. In the post-lysis binding experiment, immunoprecipitation was conducted as described above except for the following changes; after lysis and centrifugation, 200 μl of HEK cell lysate was added to 200 μl of vector 1/PASK, sNKCC1/vector 2, or sNKCC1/PASK. In a fourth tube, 200 μl of lysate from vector 1/PASK and sNKCC1/vector 2 were combined before the immunoprecipitation step. Regulatory Phosphorylation Time Course—Transfected HEK cells were grown to confluence in a 96-well polylysine-treated plate. Wells were rinsed with incubation media for specific time points, and the reaction was terminated with the addition of 1 n H3PO4, 1% SDS. Samples were neutralized with 3 m Tris, 1 n NaOH and loaded in duplicate onto two separate gels. SDS-PAGE with Western analysis using the phosphospecific R5 and J3 antibodies was completed in parallel. Comparison of parallel blots was necessary due to selective loss of signal on stripping. Antibodies—The sNKCC1-specific J3 antibody and R5 phospho-specific NKCC have been previously described (1Lytle C. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25438-25443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Flemmer A.W. Gimenez I. Dowd B.F. Darman R.B. Forbush B. J. Biol.

General—All incubations were carried out at room temperature (21–24 °C) unless otherwise noted. Data are presented as the means ± S.E. from replicate experiments except as noted (Fig. 1). Statistical significance was determined for summary data by the paired t test (data related to Figs. 1 and 2) or Wilcoxon paired rank test (data related to Fig. 4).Fig. 2The effect of PASK and DNPASK on NKCC1 regulatory phosphorylation.

This previously described PASK mutation (7Ushiro H. Tsutsumi T. Suzuki K. Kayahara T. Nakano K. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 11Johnston A.M.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4290-4297Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), consisting of a single amino acid substitution (K101R), involves an essential lysine residue found within the catalytic domain of most kinases and has been shown to abolish the positioning of the terminal phosphate of ATP (17Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2281) Google Scholar). sNKCC1 cells were also transfected with the shark homologue of MST1/2 or with a MST1/2 kinase inactive mutant created via a Thr → Ala mutation in the activation loop of its catalytic domain. This mutation has been previously described to suppress the catalytic activity of MST (18Lee K.K. Yonehara S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12351-12358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We identified sMST1/2 in a screen for NKCC1-specific phosphorylation activity, but this kinase does not appear to be significantly involved in NKCC1 regulation (see “Experimental Procedures”); it was used here as a kinase control. The expression of DNPASK results in a dramatic inhibition of NKCC1 activation in HEK cells. Fig. 1 illustrates the results of several experiments in which 86Rb influx activity was examined in NKCC1-expressing HEK cells transfected with DNPASK, PASK, or vector 2 alone. In these experiments, cotransport activity was activated by preincubation in media of various Cl– concentrations, as previously described (5Darman R.B. Flemmer A. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34359-34362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). As shown here, DNPASK expression produced a dramatic decrease in the level of NKCC1 activity for both human (Fig. 1, A and B) and shark (Fig. 1C) cotransporters. Under conditions of maximal activation by preincubation in 3 mm Cl–, DNPASK decreased the activity of hNKCC1 by 80 ± 3% in 14 experiments including those of Fig. 1, and it decreased sNKCC1 activity by 60 ± 5% in 6 experiments. This high level of inhibition mediated by the DN mutant strongly suggests that PASK activity is essential for the activation of NKCC1 in HEK cells. As seen in Fig. 1, overexpression of PASK causes an increase in the activity of NKCC1. Under conditions of maximal activation, the differences were not statistically significant when all of the experiments were analyzed, but at intermediate activation levels the differences were larger. For instance, in the 14 experiments with hNKCC1 and 6 with sNKCC1, after preincubation in 30 mm Cl–, the PASK-induced increase in NKCC1 activity was 12 ± 3% (p < 0.01) and 22 ± 8% (p < 0.05), respectively, after each curve was normalized to the maximal activity in 1.5 mm Cl– hypotonic conditions. These results are consistent with a situation in which there is sufficient endogenous PASK to fully regulate NKCC1 but in which overexpression of PASK creates a shift toward higher activation at intermediate levels of stimulation. The present data are the first to directly link PASK with the regulation of NKCC1 activity, complementing an earlier study in which PASK binding to NKCC was demonstrated (6Piechotta K. Lu J. Delpire E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50812-50819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Previous work in our laboratory has identified an N-terminal regulatory domain in which the phosphorylation state of two threonines (Thr184/Thr189 in shark) correlates with NKCC1 activation (3Darman R.B. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37542-37550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). To determine whether DNPASK-mediated NKCC1 inhibition also causes a reduction in regulatory phosphorylation, we used the previously described, phosphospecific antibody (R5) raised against two of these phosphorylated threonines (4Flemmer A.W. Gimenez I. Dowd B.F. Darman R.B. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37551-37558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, overexpression of DNPASK causes a dramatic reduction in the Thr184/Thr189 phosphorylation of sNKCC1 throughout the activation time course; in the four experiments summarized in Fig. 2B, the reduction is 75 ± 8% at the 10-min time point. This result is consistent with the results of 86Rb+ influx assays and it links PASK to both the activation and phosphorylation of NKCC1. As in the 86Rb influx assays, any effect of PASK under conditions of maximal stimulation is small, and statistical significance is achieved in these four experiments only at the 10-min time point (14% increase). The experiments of Fig. 2 rule out nonspecific interactions like that of the myosin light chain kinase inhibitor ML-7, where inhibition of NKCC1 did not alter the level of NKCC1 phosphorylation (8Klein J.D. O'Neill W.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1524-C1531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, DNPASK-mediated inhibition of NKCC1 is not due to a decrease in cotransporter expression levels, as shown using the shark-specific sNKCC1 antibody, J3. These data are also consistent with the decrease of sNKCC1 32P incorporation under low [Cl]e conditions (see Fig. 4) and indicate that the action of DNPASK is to prevent phosphorylation of NKCC1. To further test the action of DNPASK in affecting the NKCC1 phosphorylation state, we measured 86Rb+ influx in the presence of the protein phosphatase type 1 inhibitor calyculin A. We have previously shown that this compound causes a rapid and dramatic increase in NKCC1 activity via the inhibition of"

Our predicted spectrum for the face-centered cubic δ phase agrees well with experiments in the elastic limit and explains unusually large shear anisotropy of this material. The spectrum of the body-centered cubic phase shows an instability at zero temperature over a broad region of the wave vectors, indicating that this phase is highly anharmonic and can be stabilized at high temperatures by its phonon entropy."

Giguere V. Adv. Pharmacol. 2000; 47: 23-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).

Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 27: 11-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). This syndrome is characterized by insufficient insulin secretion (3Yamagata K. Furuta H. Oda N. Kaisaki P.J. Menzel S.

Surprisingly, there is not a major deficit in liver function, despite the important role of HNF4α in hepatic gene expression (5Lindner T. Gragnoli C. Furuta H. Cockburn B.N. Petzold C. Rietzsch H. Weiss U. Schulze J. Bell G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1400-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that HNF4α regulates pancreatic genes involved in glucose sensing and/or insulin production. This hypothesis is supported by experiments demonstrating that HNF4α regulates expression of genes encoding enzymes of glucose metabolism and insulin secretion (6Stoffel M. Duncan S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13209-13214Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 7Duncan S.A. Navas M.A. Dufort D. Rossant J. Stoffel M.

Because MODY1 patients have a single null allele that does not produce a dominant-negative acting protein (9Sladek F.M. Dallas-Yang Q. Nepomuceno L. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 985-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the physiological abnormalities in these patients must be caused by a relatively mild (∼50%) decrease in the amount of HNF4α protein. Taken together, these observations raise the possibility that any modification of HNF4α that causes a reduction in its transcriptional activity could have significant effects on pancreatic function. HNF4α has also been shown recently to play an important role in the regulation of hepatic glucose output, a key component of the maintenance of plasma glucose levels. Yoon et al. (10Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J. Wu Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M.

These findings suggest that HNF4α may play a role in the transcriptional response of the liver to metabolic hormones and that factors regulating the activity of HNF4α could have an effect on hepatic glucose output. AMPK is the mammalian homolog of the yeast SNF1 protein kinase (11Woods A. Munday M.R. Scott J. Yang X. Carlson M. Carling D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19509-19515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In yeast, the SNF1 complex is a nuclear protein that regulates expression of genes involved in glucose metabolism and is activated by phosphorylation when glucose is removed from the growth medium (12Woods A. Azzout-Marniche D. Foretz M. Stein S.C. Lemarchand P. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Carling D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6704-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, AMPK acts as a fuel sensor that monitors AMP and ATP levels. It is activated by high AMP:ATP ratios during states of low energy charge. Once activated, the enzyme reduces the activity of ATP-consuming anabolic pathways and increases the activity of catabolic ATP-producing pathways, acting to reestablish normal cellular energy balance (for review see Ref. 13Hardie D.G.

Kinase activity is regulated allosterically by AMP binding and also by direct phosphorylation mediated by an uncharacterized AMP-sensitive protein kinase. A potential role of AMPK in the nucleus is suggested by several observations. The first is the similarity of the mammalian kinase to the yeast SNF1 transcriptional regulator, as described above. Second, AMPK heterotrimers containing the α2 subunit isoform are preferentially found in the nucleus (31Salt I. Celler J.W. Hawley S.A. Prescott A. Woods A. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). In addition, AMPK has been shown to phosphorylate the transcriptional coactivator p300 and to regulate its ability to mediate nuclear receptor transcriptional activity (32Yang W. Hong Y.H. Shen X.Q. Frankowski C. Camp H.S. Leff T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38341-38344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). It has been reported previously (33Leclerc I. Lenzner C. Gourdon L. Vaulont S. Kahn A. Viollet B. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1515-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) that AMPK activation reduces HNF4α target gene transcription. These findings, together with the fact that both proteins participate in the regulation of similar metabolic pathways, raise the possibility that HNF4α is directly regulated by AMPK. The experiments described here examine the possibility that AMPK phosphorylates HNF4α and regulates its transcriptional activity. Plasmid Construction—The HNF4α expression construct pH4c-WT contains a C-terminal FLAG-tagged full-length human HNF4α cDNA sequence cloned into the CMV promoter-based vector pCDNA3.1. The S304A and S304D mutants were introduced into pH4c-WT using the Quik-Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and confirmed by DNA sequencing, to produce the plasmids pH4c-304A and pH4c-304D. The pH4c series plasmids were used in experiments presented in Figs. 1, 2B, 3A,3D,4A, and 5. For experiments designed to examine HNF4α protein stability (Fig. 4, B and C), full-length N-terminal FLAG-tagged wild-type, 304A, and 304D cDNA sequences were cloned into the tetracycline-regulated vector, pTRE-shuttle2 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), to form pH4i-WT, pH4i-304A, and pH4i-304D. GFP-HNF4α protein was expressed from a pCDNA3.1 vector containing an N-terminal fusion of the EGFP coding sequences (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) fused to the full-length HNF4α cDNA. GST-HNF4α protein was produced from a pET23a vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) containing an N-terminal fusion of glutathione S-transferase sequences and the full-length HNF4α cDNA. The pET.HNF4/A–D plasmids contain PCR-amplified subfragments of HNF4α (Fig. 1C) as His and T7 tag N-terminal fusions in the pET28a vector. The same subfragments were also cloned into the pCMV-Tag2b plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for expression in eukaryotic cells. The HNF4α-responsive reporter plasmid pL854 contains promoter sequences from the human apoCIII gene (–854 to +22) linked to luciferase in the pGL3-basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The β-galactosidase plasmid contains a CMV-driven β-galactosidase gene.Fig. 2AMPK phosphorylates HNF4α at serine 304. A, autoradiogram of the HNF4α C fragment phosphorylated in vitro by AMPK. Wild-type and Ser-304 mutant C fragments of HNF4α produced in an in vitro transcription/translation system were incubated with purified rat liver AMPK and [γ-32P]ATP, in the presence or absence of AMP as indicated. Lower panels are Western blots (WB) showing total protein amounts in the reactions. B, phosphorylation of full-length wild-type and Ser-304 mutant HNF4α by AMPK in vitro as in A. Numbers below each lane indicate the degree of phosphorylation relative to the wild-type protein in the absence of kinase and AMP. The degree of phosphorylation was calculated from quantified autoradiograph and Western blot bands as the ratio of phosphorylated to total protein. C, in vivo phosphorylation of the HNF4α C fragment by AMPK. BHK cells were transfected with either vector (Vec) alone or constructions producing FLAG-tagged wild-type or S304A mutant HNF4α C protein. Transfected cells were treated with the AMPK activator AICAR as indicated and [32P]orthophosphate. HNF4α C fragment protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies and subjected to electrophoresis, transfer to nitrocellulose, and autoradiography (upper panel) or Western analysis (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3Phosphorylation at Ser-304 blocks dimerization and DNA binding. A, the phosphomimetic HNF4α S304D mutation is defective in its ability to bind DNA. In vitro transcription/translation reactions were programmed with plasmids producing full-length wild-type, S304A, or S304D HNF4α proteins (pH4c series plasmids) or with empty vector (Vec). The DNA binding activities of the three HNF4α proteins were analyzed in a gel mobility shift assay using the proximal HNF4α-binding site of the apoCIII promoter as labeled probe. The lower panel is a Western blot showing the input amount of HNF4α protein used in the DNA binding reactions. B, the S304D mutant HNF4α protein is defective in its ability to form HNF4α homodimers. A GST pull-down assay was performed with in vitro produced GST-HNF4α fusion protein (wild-type, full-length). The plasmid producing the 78-kDa GST fusion protein was co-translated with plasmids producing 52 kDa wild-type, S304A, or S304D as indicated in the presence of [35S]methionine. Lanes 1–3 were subjected to GST pull-down procedure using glutathione beads, whereas lanes 4–6 were loaded directly on the gel without pull-down. Lanes 7 and 8 are translations of the two input plasmids alone. C, gel mobility shift assay showing that the phosphomimetic HNF4α S304D mutation is defective in forming functional dimers.

Cells were treated with doxycycline 18 h post-transfection to shut off expression of HNF4α protein and harvested at the indicated times thereafter. Western analysis was performed using an anti-FLAG antibody to detect HNF4α and reprobed with anti-GFP antibody to detect the amount of EGFP protein produced from a co-transfected pEGFP-N1 reference plasmid.

Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were used in transfection for transcription assays and nuclear extract preparation. CHO cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All transfections were carried out with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Transfections for reporter assays were conducted in 24-well plates in triplicate for each condition. Cells were harvested at 20 h post-transfection using lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI), and the lysates were analyzed with Tropix Dual Light Luciferase and β-galactosidase assay kit (Tropix, Inc., Bedford, MA) using an EG&G Berthold Microlumat 96P luminometer. In Vitro and in Vivo Phosphorylation—In vitro phosphorylation assays were conducted with in vitro translated proteins produced using the TnT Quick-Coupled transcription/translation system (Promega, Madison, WI). TnT reactions were carried out for 60 min at 30 °C and then immunoprecipitated by anti-FLAG (Sigma) or anti-T7 (Novagen Inc., Madison, WI) antibodies, and protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). After washing five times with HNTG buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1% Triton, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA), the purified beads were subjected to an in vitro phosphorylation reaction using 100 milliunits of purified rat liver AMPK (Upstate Inc., Lake Placid, NY) per reaction. Reactions were carried out in a buffer containing 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 7.5 mm MgCl2,50 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and a mixture of protein kinase C/protein kinase A inhibitors, with or without of 300 μm AMP, and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reactions were stopped by washing the beads three times with HNTG buffer and adding 30 μl of 2× SDS loading buffer (Invitrogen). The protein products were separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were then subjected to autoradiography and Western blot analysis using an anti-FLAG antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Sigma), and detected with the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent system (Pierce). In vivo phosphorylation labeling was conducted in BHK cells. Wild-type pCMV.HNF4/C and pCMV.HNF/C.S304A mutant, along with the control vector, were transfected in 100-mm plates. Each plate was split into two 60-mm plates 16 h post-transfection. In vivo labeling was conducted with 1 mCi (37 MBq) of [32P]orthophosphate per plate for 1 h at 40 h post-transfection, with or without of 500 μm 5′-aminoimidazol-4-carboxoxamide 1-β-d-ribofuranoside (AICAR). Cells were harvested in 600 μl of HNTG buffer and mixed for 30 min at 4 °C. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma) and 50 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed five times with same buffer. Bound proteins were eluted in 30 μl of 2× SDS loading buffer at 95 °C for 5 min, separated on 4–12% gradient SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and detected by autoradiography or Western blot using anti-FLAG antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase as described above. Gel Mobility Shift and Pull-down Assays—CHO cells transfected with full-length, wild-type, or mutant HNF4α were harvested at 20 h post-transfection, with or without 12 h treatment of AICAR. Nuclear extracts were prepared essentially as described (34Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar). The recombinant HNF4α proteins were produced in vitro using TnT Quik-Coupled transcription/translation system as described by the manufacturer (Promega, Madison, WI). For dimerization experiments, where different HNF4α proteins were produced from two plasmids, templates producing wild-type or mutant HNF4α proteins were used in the co-translation reactions at ratios determined in pilot translations to produce equal amounts of protein. For GST pull-down assays, 25 μl of translation reactions were incubated with 15 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) in BC-150 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics)) for 30 min at room temperature on a rotary platform. The beads were washed five times with BC-150 buffer, boiled in 25 μl of SDS sample buffer, and resolved on 4–20% gradient gels (Invitrogen). Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, incubated in Amplify (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min, dried, and fluorographed. The synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides used in DNA binding reaction were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Rediprime-II random labeling system (Amersham Biosciences). The double-stranded DNA binding probe contains the proximal HNF4-binding site from the human apoCIII gene (35Reddy S. Yang W. Taylor D.G. Shen X. Oxender D. Kust G. Leff T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33050-33056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). DNA binding reactions were carried out in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 3% Ficoll, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.06% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg of double-stranded poly(dI-dC), with 20,000 cpm of labeled probe (∼0.25 ng), and either with 2–5 μg of nuclear extract or 1 μl of TnT reaction. Reactions were incubated for 20 min at room temperature and then analyzed on precast 6% DNA retardation gels (Invitrogen) in 0.5× TBE at 125 V for 45 min at room temperature. Protein Stability Experiments—For the experiments shown in Fig. 4, B and C, CHO cells were transfected in 12-well plates as described above but using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) with 1 ng of the tetracycline-regulated HNF4α expressing plasmids (pH4i-WT, pH4i-304A, and pH4i-304D) together with 20 ng of pTET-OFF and 40 ng of pEGFP-N1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) per well. 18 h after transfection doxycycline was added (1 μg/ml) to the culture media to stop transcription of recombinant HNF4α and cells were harvested 2, 4, 6, and 8 h later by lysis in HNTG buffer. Gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis to detect FLAG-HNF4α and GFP protein were carried out as described above. Activation of AMPK in cultured hepatocytes with the AMP analog AICAR caused a decrease in the activity of HNF4α target gene expression and a reduction in the amount of HNF4α (33Leclerc I. Lenzner C. Gourdon L. Vaulont S. Kahn A. Viollet B. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1515-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To explore the possibility that these effects are due to direct regulation of HNF4α by AMPK, we tested whether AMPK could phosphorylate HNF4α. An in vitro phosphorylation assay containing full-length HNF4α and partially purified AMPK was carried out. The results (Fig. 1A) demonstrate that HNF4α was efficiently phosphorylated by AMPK, showing approximately the same degree of phosphorylation as a similar amount of the well characterized AMPK substrate hormone-sensitive lipase. Mapping AMPK Phosphorylation Site on HNF4α—When the HNF4α amino acid sequence was screened for the consensus target sequence for AMPK phosphorylation, three potential sites were found (Fig. 1B) with the best match to a site surrounding serine 304. To determine whether any of these sites were targets for AMPK phosphorylation, they were each mutated to alanine and examined in an in vitro phosphorylation assay. None of the mutants abolished phosphorylation by AMPK (data not shown), indicating that there are multiple AMPK phosphorylation sites on HNF4. To examine phosphorylation of individual segments of the protein independently, four overlapping fragments of HNF4α were generated from subclones of the HNF4α cDNA (Fig. 1C). When in vitro AMPK assays were conducted, all four subfragments were phosphorylated to some degree (Fig. 1D) and showed the expected enhancement of phosphorylation in the presence of AMP (an allosteric activator of the kinase). However, when the results were normalized to the total amount of protein in the assay, the HNF4/C fragment (containing the Ser-304 site) showed the highest degree of AMP-dependent phosphorylation (data not shown). A significant amount of phosphorylation was also observed with the HNF4/A fragment. The HNF4/A fragment contains one of the three potential consensus sites for AMPK (Fig. 1B). However, mutation of threonine 15 to alanine in this sequence did not reduce the phosphorylation of the HNF4/A fragment, suggesting the presence of one or more cryptic AMPK sites in this part of the protein. To determine whether the C fragment is phosphorylated at the Ser-304 residue, the S304A mutant was transferred to the C fragment and examined in an in vitro phosphorylation assay. As presented in Fig. 2A, mutation of serine 304 completely abolished phosphorylation of the C fragment. Although the Ser-304 site is also present in the"

TGF-β family-induced changes in gene expression are mediated by serine/threonine kinase receptors at the cell surface and Smads as intracellular effectors. Receptor-activated Smads combine with a common Smad4 to translocate into the nucleus where they cooperate with other transcription factors to activate or repress transcription. The activities of the receptor-activated Smads are controlled by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitylation. Here we show that Smad4 is modified by sumoylation. Sumoylation of Smad4 was enhanced by the conjugating enzyme Ubc9 and members of the PIAS family of SUMO ligases. A major sumoylation site in Smad4 was localized to Lys-159 in its linker segment with an additional site at Lys-113 in the MH-1 domain. Increased sumoylation in the presence of the PIASy E3 ligase correlated with targeting of Smad4 to subnuclear speckles that contain SUMO-1 and PIASy. Replacement of lysines 159 and 113 by arginines or increased sumoylation enhanced the stability of Smad4, and transcription in mammalian cells and Xenopus embryos. These observations suggest a role for Smad4 sumoylation in the regulation of TGF-β signaling through Smads.

Cellular processes, like cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, are elaborated by intracellular proteins that are regulated by signaling pathways (1Pawson T. Saxton T.M. Cell. 1999; 97: 675-678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Individual mediators often respond to multiple pathways and participate in multiprotein complexes of varying composition, thus requiring an exquisitely sensitive, versatile and often rapid regulation of protein function, beyond the control at the level of gene expression (2Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar). Intracellular signaling mediators, including those that participate in transcription, are often subject to post-translational modifications that alter the activity and specificity, subcellular localization, stability, and/or interactions with other macromolecules, and are major determinants of a function of the protein (3Parekh R.B. Rohlff C. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 718-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 4Brivanlou A.H. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 2002; 295: 813-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). One class of modifications involves addition of a small chemical group to amino acids, e.g. through phosphorylation, acetylation, ADP-ribosylation, or methylation, whereas the second class involves attachment of larger macromolecules, such as polypeptides in the case of ubiquitylation and sumoylation, or polysaccharides. A variety of enzymes mediate polypeptide modifications and thereby often display substrate specificity, whereas complementary enzyme sets remove these modifications, thus illustrating the reversible nature of post-translational modification processes (5Yeh E.T. Gong L. Kamitani T. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 248: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). This dynamic nature and the observations that a single signaling mediator is often subject to multiple types of modification illustrate the plasticity and the combinatorial control that regulates the functions of the signaling effectors. Ubiquitylation results in attachment of one or several 76-amino acid long ubiquitin polypeptides to Lys residues of target proteins (6Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). This process requires the sequential actions of a ubiquitin-activating E1 1The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; SUMO-1, small ubiquitin-related modifier-1; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; aa, amino acid(s); HA, hemagglutinin; bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. enzyme, conjugating E2 enzyme, and E3 ligase. Ubiquitin is activated by the E1 enzyme in an ATP-dependent manner and transferred as a thiol ester intermediate to one of several E2-conjugating enzymes. Covalent attachment of ubiquitin to a target protein is then mediated by one of the many E3 ligases that define substrate specificity. Polyubiquitylated proteins are usually targeted for proteasomal degradation (6Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). Sumoylation involves the covalent attachment of SUMO, a ubiquitin-related polypeptide, to a Lys residue (7Hay R.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 332-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However, unlike ubiquitylation, sumoylation has not been reported to target a substrate for degradation. As with ubiquitylation, sequential activities of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes are involved in sumoylation, but the identities of the enzymes are different. The SUMO activating enzyme E1, a heterodimer of Aos1 and Uba2, transfers activated SUMO to the E2-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 that directly catalyzes the isopeptide bond formation between the C-terminal glycine residue of the activated SUMO to Lys residue of the target. PIAS family members have been implicated as E3 SUMO ligases, although their roles in the sumoylation of the diverse substrates need to be further defined (8Jackson P.K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3053-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). For example, RanBP2 can serve as E3 ligase for the HDAC4 deacetylase and Sp100 (9Kirsh O. Seeler J.S. Pichler A. Gast A.

Melchior F. Cell. 2002; 108: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), whereas ARIP3 is involved in sumoylation of the androgen receptor (11Kotaja N. Karvonen U. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5222-5234Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 12Nishida T. Yasuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41311-41317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). As with other post-translational modifications, sumoylation is thought to be a reversible and dynamic process. Sumoylation can regulate the function of a protein by changing its subcellular localization, protein-protein interactions, and/or stability, depending on the identity of the protein. For example, SUMO-1 modification targets the PML protein to nuclear bodies (13Muller S. Matunis M.J. Dejean A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), and the homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 into nuclear speckles (14Kim Y.H. Choi C.Y. Kim Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12350-12355Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Sumoylation negatively impacts the transcription activities of the transcription factors Sp3 (15Sapetschnig A. Rischitor G. Braun H. Doll A. Schergaut M. Melchior F. Suske G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5206-5215Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), LEF-1 (16Sachdev S. Bruhn L. Sieber H. Pichler A. Melchior F. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3088-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), and androgen receptor (12Nishida T. Yasuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41311-41317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and may also affect their subnuclear distribution, whereas other studies indicate a positive effect of sumoylation on transcription factor activity such as heat shock transcription factor-1 (17Hong Y. Rogers R. Matunis M.J. Mayhew C.N. Goodson M.L. Park-Sarge O.K. Sarge K.D. Goodson M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40263-40267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Signaling from the cell surface can also be directly impacted by sumoylation, as illustrated in the case of IκB, which sequesters NFκB in the cytoplasm. Tumor necrosis factor-α-induced phosphorylation of IκB allows for its ubiquitination, thus targeting it for proteasomal degradation and enabling nuclear translocation of NFκB, whereas sumoylation of the same Lys in IκB stabilizes it against degradation (18Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). This dynamic balance between sumoylation and ubiquitination of IκB can then regulate the gene expression of the cell response mediated by NFκB. Taken together, the effects of sumoylation on the function of the protein appear to depend on the substrate and, unlike ubiquitylation, which frequently targets substrate for proteasomal degradation, are not predictable. TGF-β and TGF-β-related proteins are key regulators of cell proliferation and differentiation. They regulate development from nematodes and flies to mammals (6Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar), and play important roles in tumor progression (19Derynck R. Akhurst R.J. Balmain A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar). The central signaling pathway from TGF-β-activated cell surface receptors to alterations in gene expression involves a small class of signaling effectors, the Smads, as key mediators of a response of the cell to TGF-β (20Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Science. 2002; 296: 1646-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). Thus, following ligand binding to type II/type I receptor complexes, the activated type I receptors phosphorylate the C-terminal two serines of receptor-activated Smads, e.g. Smad2 and Smad3 in response to TGF-β and Smad1, -5, and -8 upon stimulation by bone morphogenetic proteins. The phosphorylated Smads are then released from the receptors to form a heterotrimeric complex with Smad4 as a common component of all Smad signaling pathways, activated by TGF-β family members (20Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Science. 2002; 296: 1646-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). The Smad complexes enter the nucleus where they interact at the promoter with other transcription factors and co-regulators to regulate gene expression. In this pathway, Smad4 acts as a central coactivator of all receptor-activated Smads, presumably through its ability to stabilize the interaction of receptor-activated Smads with the essential coactivator cAMP-response element-binding protein/p300 (21Feng X.H. Zhang Y. Wu R.Y. Derynck R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) and its ability to recruit yet another coactivator, SMIF1 (22Bai R.Y. Koester C. Ouyang T. Hahn S.A. Hammerschmidt M. Peschel C. Duyster J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In addition to C-terminal phosphorylation, the activation of the receptor-activated Smads is also regulated by other phosphorylations, e.g. in response to mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling (23Blanchette F. Rivard N. Rudd P. Grondin F. Attisano L. Dubois C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33986-33994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and is counteracted by inhibitory Smad6 and -7 (24Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Nature. 1997; 389: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar, 25Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.E. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar). Whereas phosphorylation plays a central role in the activation of the Smad pathway, recent studies have revealed an additional level of regulation of Smad signaling through ubiquitylation. Smurf1 and Smurf2, two Hect family E3 ubiquitin ligases, target receptor-activated Smads for ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation, thus decreasing their availability (26Zhu H. Kavsak P. Abdollah S. Wrana J.L. Thomsen G.H. Nature. 1999; 400: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 27Zhang Y. Chang C. Gehling D.J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Derynck R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 974-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). In addition, ubiquitylation and consequent degradation of ligandactivated Smad2 and Smad3 in the nucleus may be involved in the termination of their functions in transcriptional regulation (28Lo R.S. Massague J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 472-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In contrast to the receptor-activated Smads, Smad4 levels are not regulated through ubiquitin-mediated degradation. However, some mutations, found in human tumors, destabilize Smad4 via ubiquitylation and consequent degradation (29Xu J. Attisano L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4820-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 30Maurice D. Pierreux C.E. Howell M. Wilentz R.E. Owen M.J. Hill C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43175-43181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The role of Smad4 as the central mediator of signaling by all receptor-activated Smads in response to all TGF-β family members, and its shuttling between cytoplasm and nucleus (31Pierreux C.E. Nicolas F.J. Hill C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9041-9054Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) suggests that some mechanism may be in place to allow for stabilization and re-utilization during signaling. In this report, we show that among the Smads known to be involved in TGF-β signaling, Smad4 is the only one that is preferentially subjected to sumoylation. We identified two sumoylation sites in Smad4, and sumoylation was enhanced in the presence of the conjugating enzyme Ubc9 and PIAS family E3 ligases. Sumoylation by the PIASy E3 ligase resulted in redistribution of Smad4 to subnuclear speckles that colocalized with SUMO-1 and PIASy. Replacement of the sumoylation target lysines with arginine, or increased sumoylation, enhanced the protein stability and increased transcription in mammalian cells and in Xenopus embryos. These results suggest a role for Smad4 sumoylation in the regulation of TGF-β family signaling through Smads. Plasmids—Expression plasmids for N-terminal FLAG-tagged Smad1, -2, -3, -4, -6, and -7 have been described (32Zhang Y. Musci T. Derynck R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 270-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 33Choy L. Skillington J. Derynck R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 667-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Additionally, plasmids encoding Smad4 truncation mutants, i.e. pRK5F-Smad4N (aa 1–140), Smad4NL (aa 1–300), and Smad4C (aa 294–552) have also been described (32Zhang Y. Musci T. Derynck R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 270-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding Smad4 with amino acid substitutions were constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and mutations were confirmed by nucleic acid sequencing.

Cell Culture, Transfections, and Reporter Assays—COS-1, HeLa, and MDA-MB-468 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 100 units/ml penicillin G. COS-1 and HeLa cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) and MDA-MB-468 cells were transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In transcription reporter assays, MDA-MB-468 cells were seeded onto 6-well culture dishes and 2 μg of DNA, including 0.5 μg of (SBE)4-luc luciferase reporter plasmid, 0.1 μg of pRK5-β-gal, and other expression plasmids, as required, were used for each transfection. The total amount of DNA was kept constant by addition of pRK5 DNA. 12–16 h after transfection, cells were treated with or without 10 ng/ml TGF-β in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2% fetal bovine serum for 20 h. At the end of stimulation, cells were washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline and processed for luciferase or β-galactosidase enzyme assays as described (37Qing J. Zhang Y. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38802-38812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Cell Lysis, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting Analysis— Cells were washed four times in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0), supplemented with 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide (Calbiochem, 34115), protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma, P8340), and 5% glycerol. In co-immunoprecipitation experiments cells were lysed in RIPA buffer without the ionic detergents. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma, A2220) overnight at 4 °C. The agarose beads were washed five times in lysis buffer and the bound proteins were eluted in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western transfer and immunoblotting as described (38Lee P.S. Wang Y. Dominguez M.G. Yeung Y.G. Murphy M.A. Bowtell D.D. Stanley E.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3616-3628Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma, F3165), anti-Myc tag 9E10 antibody (Covance, MMS-150P), anti-HA tag HA11 antibody (Covance, MMS-101R), anti-GMP-1 (SUMO-1) antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and rabbit polyclonal anti-Smad4 antibody H-552 (Santa Cruz, sc-7154) were used at 1 μg/ml in Western blotting. Peroxidase-linked anti-mouse (NA931) and anti-rabbit (NA9340) secondary antibodies and ECL detection reagents (RPN2106) were purchased and used according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Pulse-Chase Analysis of Smad4 Stability—Transfected COS cells were starved in methionine- and cysteine-free medium containing 0.2% dialyzed fetal bovine serum for 2 h. The cells were then labeled with 0.25 μCi/ml [35S]EXPRESS protein labeling mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, NEG072) in the same medium for 1 h. At the end of the labeling, the cells were washed three times in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum before incubating in the same medium for various times, as needed. Where indicated, lactacystin (Calbiochem, number 426100) was used at 30 μm during the pulse-chase. Cells were harvested and processed as above. The cell lysates were subjected to anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation for isolation of exogenous Smad4, and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Smad4 was visualized by autoradiography and analyzed by densitometry. Immunofluorescence—HeLa cells were grown on coverslips and transfected with the indicated plasmid DNA. 24 h after transfection cells were kept in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2% fetal bovine serum for 3 h and subsequently treated with 5 ng/ml TGF-β for 40 min. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in CSK buffer (10 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA) for 2 min on ice, and fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in CSK buffer for 5 min at 37 °C (39Carvalho T. Seeler J.S. Ohman K. Jordan P. Pettersson U. Akusjarvi G. Carmo-Fonseca M. Dejean A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Cells were rinsed twice in TBS (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl) and then blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin in TBS containing 0.03% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation with a primary antibody in blocking solution, the cells were washed in blocking solution five times before incubating with 1:500 diluted secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (A11029) and Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse IgG (A-11034) from Molecular Probes) for 1 h. After washings cells were stained in 300 nm 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma, 32670) in TBS for 5 min, followed by brief washes in TBS. The samples were finally mounted in FluorSave Reagent (Calbiochem, 345789) and examined by fluorescence microscopy. Mesoderm Marker Induction in Xenopus Embryos—cRNAs encoding Smad4 (wild-type and mutants) and SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 and β-catenin were synthesized in vitro, using Ambion mMessage Machine kit. Capped RNAs were injected into both animal poles of two-cell stage embryos. The doses of cRNAs used were indicated in the legend to Fig. 7. The ectodermal explants (animal caps) of injected embryos were dissected at blastula stages (stage 9), and total RNA was extracted from these caps at gastrula stages (stage 11). For treatment with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), the animal caps were dissected at stage 9 and incubated in buffer containing 100 ng/ml bFGF. The caps were harvested at stage 11 as other samples. Reverse transcription-PCR was performed using the primers as described previously (40Chang C. Wilson P.A. Mathews L.S. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Development. 1997; 124: 827-837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Smad4 Is Sumoylated—Proteins that are substrates of ubiquitin modification are often modified by sumoylation, raising the possibility that the TGF-β Smads could be targeted for sumoylation. Furthermore, in a yeast two-hybrid screen for interaction proteins we found that Smad4, but not Smad3, had an affinity for SUMO-1 (data not shown). We therefore evaluated whether Smad3 and Smad4, expressed in transfected cells, were sumoylated. In the presence of coexpressed Myctagged SUMO-1, but not in its absence, a fraction of Smad4 reacted in Western blotting with the anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 1A, top panel). Its apparent size was compatible with the addition of a single SUMO-1 polypeptide to Smad4, and corresponded to the upper edge of the total Smad4 band, detected by Western blotting (Fig. 1B, lower panel). Smad3 did not display reactivity for Myc-tagged SUMO-1 under these conditions. Although many gene expression responses of TGF-β are mediated by Smad3 and Smad4 (41Itoh S. Itoh F. Goumans M.J. Ten Dijke P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6954-6967Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), Smad2 and Smad1 can also be activated by TGF-β (42Macias-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 43Goumans M.J. Valdimarsdottir G. Itoh S. Rosendahl A. Sideras P. ten Dijke P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1743-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar), and Smad6 and Smad7 act as inhibitory Smads for the TGF-β response (25Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.E. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar, 41Itoh S. Itoh F. Goumans M.J. Ten Dijke P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6954-6967Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). We therefore evaluated whether any of these Smads are targeted by sumoylation. As shown in Fig. 1B, only Smad4, and not the other Smads tested, was sumoylated under this condition. Lysines 159 and 113 Are Major Sumoylation Sites in Smad4 —To localize the site of sumoylation within Smad4, we expressed several Smad4 segments, either in the presence or absence of coexpressed SUMO-1. Immunoprecipitation followed by Western detection of SUMO-1 indicated that the NL segment, corresponding to amino acids 1–300 and containing the MH1 domain and linker segment, was sumoylated (Fig. 2A). Smad4C, i.e. amino acids 266–552 containing the MH2 domain, was not detectably sumoylated. Smad4N, i.e. amino acids 1–140 corresponding to the MH1 domain, showed only a minimal level of immunoreactivity for Myc-SUMO-1 (Fig. 2A). Direct Western blotting of the cell lysates for Smad4 detected small fractions of Smad4, Smad4N, and Smad4NL (Fig. 2A, lower panel) with the same mobilities as the sumoylated forms that were detected using the anti-Myc antibody for SUMO-1 (Fig. 2A, upper panel). SUMO conjugation occurs on lysine (K) residues within a general minimal consensus sequence ψKXE, in which ψ is a large hydrophobic residue (7Hay R.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 332-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Only 1 lysine within such sequence context, i.e. Lys-159 within the VKDE sequence, is present in Smad4 and is located within the Smad4NL, but not the Smad4N segment. Within the Smad4NL sequence are two other lysines, i.e. Lys-51 and Lys-106, that are located within a KXE sequence that lack a preceding hydrophobic residue. To examine which lysine is sumoylated, we individually replaced each of these three lysines within Smad4NL by an arginine (R). As shown in Fig. 2B, the K51R and K106R mutants were sumoylated to a similar extent as the normal Smad4NL. In contrast, the K159R mutation strongly reduced, yet did not abolish the sumoylation. This result suggests that Lys-159 is a major sumoylation site. The triple mutation of Smad4NL, resulting in replacement of all three lysines with arginines further reduced the reactivity in Western blotting for SUMO to background level. This result suggests that Lys-51 and/or Lys-106 can serve as targets for sumoylation enzymes, albeit with a much lower efficiency than Lys-159. We also tested the effect of these lysine mutations on sumoylation of full-length Smad4 (Fig. 2C). These results confirmed Lys-159 as the major sumoylation site, because the K159R mutation nearly abolished sumoylation. In contrast, mutation of Lys-106 exerted only a minor decrease, and mutation of Lys-51 had no effect. We also replaced Lys-392, which is located within the CKGE sequence in the carboxyl MH2 domain of Smad4, by Arg. This mutation also had only a minimal, if any, effect on Smad4 sumoylation (Fig. 2C), consistent with the lack of detectable sumoylation of Smad4C (Fig. 2A). Finally, an alternate, less common sumoylation target sequence, ψKXD, has also been described (44Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Lys-122, within an LKCD sequence, was therefore mutated and the effect on Smad4 sumoylation was assessed. As shown in Fig. 2C, the K122R mutation did not detectably decrease the level of Smad4 sumoylation. We also examined the sumoylation status of double lysine mutants, K51R/L159R and K122R/L159R and found that they had a low level of sumoylation like K159R (Fig. 2C). While this paper was under review, Lin et al. (45Lin X. Liang M. Liang Y.Y. Brunicardi F.C. Melchior F. Feng X.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18714-18719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) reported that Smad4 is sumoylated on Lys-113, in addition to Lys-159. We therefore verified the possible sumoylation of this site (Fig. 2D). As evaluated in the presence of SUMO-1, mutation of Lys-113 to Arg reduced sumoylation of Smad4."

Importin α contains 10 armadillo (arm) repeats, of which the N-terminal arm repeats 2–4 have been considered as the “major” NLS binding site. Interferon-activated, dimerized signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT1 and STAT2) directly bind to importin α5 via a dimeric nonclassical NLS. Here we show by site-directed mutagenesis that the very C-terminal arm repeats 8 and 9 of importin α5 form a unique binding site for STAT1 homodimers and STAT1-STAT2 heterodimers. Influenza A virus nucleoprotein also contains a nonclassical NLS that is recognized by the C-terminal NLS binding site of importin α5, comprising arm repeats 7–9. Binding of influenza A virus nucleoprotein to importin α3 also occurs via the C-terminal arm repeats. Simian virus 40 large T antigen instead binds to the major N-terminal arm repeats of importin α3, indicating that one importin α molecule is able to use either its N- or C-terminal arm repeats for binding various NLS containing proteins.

Regulated import of molecules into the nucleus through the nuclear pores is a vital event in eukaryotic cells. Importins (also known as karyopherins) are the major cargo carriers from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. Large molecules (>40 kDa) that cannot passively diffuse through the nuclear pores use a signal-mediated transport system. The importin α/importin β-mediated import pathway was the first one to be discovered, and it is also referred to as the classical pathway. Proteins transported into the nucleus contain nuclear location signals (NLSs) 1The abbreviations used are: NLSs, nuclear localization signals; NP, nucleoprotein; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; IFN, interferon; GST, glutathione S-transferase; BSA, bovine serum albumin. that are recognized by importin α/importin β heterodimers. Importin α recognizes and binds the NLS, and importin β docks the complex to the nuclear pore and translocates it into the nucleus (1Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar, 2Macara I.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. 2001; 65: 570-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar, 3Weis K.

Six different human importin α molecules have been identified: importin α1 (Rch1, hSRP1α), importin α3 (Qip1), importin α4 (hSRP1γ), importin α5 (hSRP1, NPI-1), importin α6, and importin α7 (4Cuomo C.A.

Biol. 1999; 19: 7782-7791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importin α proteins have remained structurally and functionally conserved throughout evolution. The six human importin α proteins show over 60% sequence similarity. The crystal structures of two importin α molecules, yeast importin α (10Conti E. Uy M. Leighton L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar) and mouse importin α2 (11Fontes M.R.M. Teh T. Kobe B. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), have been determined. Importin α is composed of a large central domain that consist of 10 tandemly repeated armadillo (arm) motifs, which are organized in a superhelix flanked by small N- and C-terminal domains. The 10 arm repeats generate an array of binding pockets that are situated within a long helical surface groove. One binding pocket typically includes a tryptophan residue, followed by an asparagine residue 4 residues downstream. The arm repeats are variable within one protein, but they are remarkably conserved in sequence and order when homologous proteins from yeast to humans are compared. The N-terminal importin β binding domain of importin α mediates binding to importin β (12Görlich D. Henklein P. Laskey R.A. Hartmann E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1810-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 13Weis K. Ryder U. Lamond A.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7120-7128Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In the absence of cargo and importin β, the importin β binding domain blocks the NLS binding site of importin α (14Kobe B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 15Harreman M.T. Hodel M.R. Fanara P. Hodel A.E. Corbett A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5854-5863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of importin α mediates interactions with the export receptor CAS (16Herold A. Truant R. Wiegand H. Cullen B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 17Moroianu J. Blobel G. Radu A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7059-7062Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The NLS used by the classical nuclear import pathway is a short stretch of positively charged amino acids, arginines and lysines, that lack strict consensus sequence (18Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar). A monopartite NLS, like that of simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen, is composed of a cluster of five to seven basic amino acids (19Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar, 20Lanford R.E. Butel J.S. Cell. 1984; 37: 801-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). A typical bipartite NLS contains two clusters of basic amino acids separated by a linker of 10–11 amino acids (21Dingwall C. Sharnick S.V. Laskey R.A. Cell. 1982; 30: 449-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Monopartite NLSs have been shown to bind to the “major” binding site of importin α, which is formed by arm repeats 2–4 (10Conti E. Uy M. Leighton L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). The downstream cluster of the bipartite NLS is also recognized by these arm repeats, whereas the upstream cluster is recognized by arm repeats 7 and 8, also called the “minor” binding site (11Fontes M.R.M. Teh T. Kobe B. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) are latent cytoplasmic transcription factors that regulate the expression of a number of genes involved in host defense and growth (22Levy D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar). Binding of interferon (IFN) to its specific cell-surface receptor leads to the activation of receptor-associated Janus (Jak) tyrosine kinases, which phosphorylate STATs. This leads to dimerization and translocation of STATs into the nucleus. Dimerization is an essential and sufficient step for nuclear import (23Milocco L.H. Haslam J.A. Rosen J. Seidel H.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2913-2920Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Although bound by importin α5, STATs do not contain a classical NLS (24Sekimoto T. Imamoto N. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Yoneda Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7067-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Instead, it is supposed that both STAT1 and STAT2 contain in the DNA binding domain a nonclassical NLS that seems to become operative in STAT dimers (25Melén K. Kinnunen L. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16447-16455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 26Fagerlund R. Melén K. Kinnunen L. Julkunen I. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 344-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In response to IFN-γ stimulation, STAT1 homodimers are formed, whereas IFN-α stimulation results in the formation of STAT1-STAT2 heterodimers. Both STAT1 homodimers and STAT1-STAT2 heterodimers are specifically bound to importin α5 (24Sekimoto T. Imamoto N. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Yoneda Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7067-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 26Fagerlund R. Melén K. Kinnunen L. Julkunen I. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1754-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The STAT1-binding site of importin α5 has been suggested to be located in the very C-terminal end of STAT1 apart from the arm repeat domain (24Sekimoto T. Imamoto N. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Yoneda Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7067-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Also other regions or completely different mechanisms have been suspected to affect the nuclear translocation of STATs. Strehlow and Schindler (29Strehlow I. Schindler C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28049-28056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) suggested that the most N-terminal amino acids (the first 129 residues) regulate the nuclear import of STAT molecules. Subramaniam et al. (30Subramaniam P.S. Larkin III, J. Mujtaba M.G. Walter M.R. Johnson H.M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2771-2781PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that the C-terminal nuclear localization sequence of IFN-γ regulates STAT1α nuclear import, and Bild et al. (31Bild A.H. Turkson J. Jove R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3255-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) showed that receptor-mediated endocytosis is necessary for STAT3 nuclear import. Influenza A virus nucleoprotein (NP) and SV40 large T antigen have functioned as important model molecules for analyzing the nuclear import machinery. Influenza A virus NP encapsidates the viral genome and is essential for viral transcription, replication, and packaging. NP interacts with viral RNA, NP, and other viral proteins as well as cellular proteins including importins α1 and α5 (32O'Neill R.E. Palese P. Virology. 1995; 206: 116-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 33Görlich D. Prehn S. Laskey R.A. Hartmann E. Cell. 1994; 79: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Two NLSs have been identified in this protein, an unusual NLS at the N terminus (34Wang P. Palese P. O'Neill R.E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1850-1856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a classical bipartite NLS in the middle of the molecule (35Weber F. Kochs G. Gruber S. Haller O. Virology. 1998; 250: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Apparently, the N-terminal NLS mediates NP interaction with importins (34Wang P. Palese P. O'Neill R.E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1850-1856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Neumann G. Castrucci M.R. Kawaoka Y. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9690-9700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SV40 large T antigen has a monopartite NLS that interacts with importin α (19Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar, 20Lanford R.E. Butel J.S. Cell. 1984; 37: 801-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 37Conti E. Kuriyan J. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 329-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Here we show by site-directed mutagenesis that importin α5 recognizes the nonclassical STAT1, STAT2, and influenza A virus NP NLSs by its arm repeat domain. The binding site for STAT NLS is composed of arm repeats 8 and 9 and for influenza A virus NP of arm repeats 7–9. Both binding sites differ from the previously described major and minor classical NLS binding sites of importin α. We also show that influenza A virus NP binds to the C terminus and SV40 large T antigen to the N-terminal NLS binding site of importin α3, indicating that one importin α molecule is able to use different binding sites for various NLSs. Cells—Monolayers and suspension cultures of Spodoptera frugiperda Sf 9 cells were maintained in TNM-FH medium and used for baculovirus expression as described (38Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Tex. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1986; 1555: 1-57Google Scholar). Human NK-92 cell line was maintained in continuous culture in minimum Eagle's medium-α (Invitrogen) supplemented with 12% horse serum (Invitrogen), 12% fetal calf serum, 0.2 mm inositol, 20 mm folic acid, 40 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm l-glutamine, antibiotics, and 100 IU/ml of human recombinant interleukin-2 (Chiron, Emeryville, CA). Interferons and Other Reagents—Human leukocyte IFN-α (6 × 106 IU/ml) was kindly provided by Dr. Kari Cantell at our Institute (39Cantell K. Hirvonen S. Kauppinen H.-L. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 119: 54-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). 35S-Labeled PRO-MIX (>1000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Antibodies—In Western blot analysis rabbit anti-STAT1 (c-24; 1:10,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), rabbit anti-STAT2 (c-20; 1:2000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and mouse monoclonal anti-SV40 large T antigen (sc-147; 1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) immunoglobulins were used as suggested by the manufacturer. Influenza A NP antibodies (40Ronni T. Sareneva T. Pirhonen J. Julkunen I. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2764-2774PubMed Google Scholar) were used at a 1:500 dilution. In Western blotting secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:2000; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) or anti-mouse immunoglobulins (1:5000; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) were used. Plasmids and DNA Manipulations—The importin α1 and α3 gene constructs encoding C-terminal His-tagged proteins have been described previously (9Köhler M. Speck C. Christiansen M. Bischoff F.R. Prehn S. Haller H. Görlich D. Hartmann E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7782-7791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). His tags were replaced by GST tags from pFA6aGST-HIS3Mx6 via BamHI/HindIII using PCR mutagenesis. Importin β and α5 cDNAs in GST expression vectors were kindly provided by Drs. D. Görlich and M. Malim, respectively. To create N- and C-terminal point mutations to GST-importin α5, we used QuikChange™ Site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The primers used are 5′-CAC TGC AGT TTG AAT CAG CTG CGG TAC TGG CAG CTA TTG CTT CAG GAA ATT CTC (arm 2), 5′-GAT GTC CAG GAA CAG GCA GTC GCG GCT CTT GGC GCC ATT GCT GGA GAT AGT ACC ATG (arm 3), 5′-CGG AAT GCA GTA GCG GCT TTG TCT AAT C (arm 4), 5′-GAA TCT ATC AAA AAG GAA GCA TGT GCG ACG ATA GCT GCT ATT ACA GCT GGA AAT AGG GC (arm 7), 5′-CGG ACA AGA AAA GAA GCA GCT GCG GCC ATC ACG GCT GCA ACT TCT GGA GGA TCA GCT G (arm 8), and 5′-GAT TGT ACA GGT TGC CCT AGC CGG CTT GGA AGC TAT CCT GAG GCT TGG AGA AC (arm 9). To create arm repeat mutations to GST-importin α3, we used QuikChange™ Site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The primers used are 5′-GTC TGT GAG CAA GCA GTG GCG GCA TTG GGA GCT ATC ATA GGT GAT GGG CCC CAG (arm 3) and 5′-GGC ACT CAA AAA GAA GCT GCT GCC GCC ATA AGT GCC TTA ACA ATT AGT GGA AGG (arm 8). Human importin α7 gene (9Köhler M. Speck C. Christiansen M. Bischoff F.R. Prehn S. Haller H. Görlich D. Hartmann E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7782-7791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (GenBank™ accession number AF060543) was PCR-modified with oligonucleotides GAG CGG ATC CAC CAT GGA GAC CAT GGC GAG CCC (5′ oligonucleotide, initiation codon underlined) and TTC TTA GGA TCC CTA TTA TAG CTG GAA GCC CTC (3′ oligonucleotide) to create BamHI cloning sites (in boldface) on both sides of the gene coding region. After BamHI digestion the insert was cloned into the pGEX-2T GST fusion vector (Amersham Biosciences). Baculovirus expression constructs of SV40 large T antigen and influenza A virus NP have been described previously (26Fagerlund R. Melén K. Kinnunen L. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30072-30078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 41Cantalupo P. Saenz-Robles M.T. Pipas J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 306: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). All DNA manipulations were performed according to standard protocols, and the newly created gene constructs were partially sequenced. Baculovirus Expression—Human Tyk2 cDNA in the baculovirus expression plasmid pVL1392 and SV40 large T antigen cDNA in the baculovirus expression plasmid were kindly provided by Dr. Sandra Pellegrini (Institute Pasteur, Paris) and Dr. J. M. Pipas (University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh (41Cantalupo P. Saenz-Robles M.T. Pipas J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 306: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar)), respectively. Wt STAT1 and STAT2 baculovirus constructs were as described (25Melén K. Kinnunen L. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16447-16455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Influenza A (PR8) virus NP gene was inserted into the BamHI site of the pAcYM1 expression plasmid, and recombinant viruses were obtained by plaque purification as described (38Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Tex. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1986; 1555: 1-57Google Scholar). For protein production Sf 9 cells were coinfected with Tyk2 and STAT protein-expressing baculoviruses for 42 h. Influenza A NP and SV40 large T antigen were produced without coinfection with Tyk2. Virus-infected Sf 9 cells were collected, and the whole cell extracts were prepared by disrupting the cells in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100 (immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer) on ice for 30 min. The cells were disrupted with a syringe. Cell extracts were clarified by Eppendorf centrifugation (13,000 rpm, 10 min). Importin Binding Assay, SDS-PAGE, and Western Blotting—Human importins β, α1, α3, α5, and α7 as well as mutants in the arm repeats 2, 3, 2 + 3, 2 + 4, 3 + 4, 2 + 3 + 4, 2 + 3 + 7, 2 + 3 + 8, 7, 8, and 9 of importin α5 and mutants in the arm repeats 3 and 8 of importin α3 were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells as GST fusion proteins under isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction. Bacteria were lysed in IP buffer with 5 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma) at room temperature for 30 min, briefly sonicated, and clarified by Eppendorf centrifugation (13,000 rpm, 5 min). From 0.1 to 1.0 ml of bacterial cell extracts containing GST-importin proteins were allowed to bind to 25 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (Amersham Biosciences) in IP buffer with agitation at +4 °C for 60 min, followed by washing twice with the buffer. From 0.1 to 1.0 ml of baculovirus cell extracts containing STATs, influenza A NP, or SV40 large T antigen as well as 50 μl of in vitro translated influenza A virus NP protein (TnT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate Systems, Promega, Madison, WI) were allowed to bind in IP buffer to Sepharose-immobilized GST-importins α3 and α5 or GST-importin β at +4 °C for 2 h, followed by washing 3 times with the buffer. Sepharose beads were dissolved in 50 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer, and the proteins were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (polyvinylidine difluoride; Millipore, Bedford, MA), followed by staining with primary and secondary antibodies and visualization of the proteins with the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences) as recommended by the manufacturer. 35S-Labeled protein samples were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE. The gels were stained and treated with Amplify reagent (Amersham Biosciences) as recommended and autoradiographed. Structural Features of the Conserved Importin α Molecules— Importin α molecules are evolutionarily conserved and can be found in eukaryotes from yeast to humans. In humans, six importin α isoforms have been identified (Fig. 1A). Yeast cells contain only one importin α isoform that shows over 55% sequence similarity with the human importins. The similarity of the six human importins is between 56 and 89% (Fig. 1A). The central domain of importin α is composed of 10 arm repeats (Fig. 1B). The well conserved tryptophan and asparagine residues in arm repeats 2–4 and 7–9 in the helical surface groove of the importin α molecule are thought to be crucial for NLS binding (10Conti E. Uy M. Leighton L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 11Fontes M.R.M. Teh T. Kobe B. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, B and C). An alignment of the central domain of human importin α molecules is shown in Fig. 1C. Typical arm repeats contain a tryptophan-asparagine pair at analogous positions. A tryptophan-asparagine pair was found in arm repeats 2–4 and 7–8. Arm repeats 5 and 6, which do not contain this pair, have not been shown to participate directly in NLS binding. Arm repeat 9 contains the conserved asparagine residue, but the tryptophan residue is replaced either by an aspartic acid (importins α1, α3, and α4) or an asparagine (importins α5, α6, and α7). Based on published crystal structures (10Conti E. Uy M. Leighton L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 11Fontes M.R.M. Teh T. Kobe B. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) and the alignment in Fig. 1C, series of mutations were created to analyze the interactions between importin α and various NLSs. Arm repeat 9 was included in our analysis, because the two asparagine residues appeared as part of a possible NLS binding pocket (Fig. 1C). IFN-stimulated STAT Dimers Bind Specifically to Importin α5—At present, STAT1 homodimers and STAT1-STAT2 heterodimers are the only STAT dimers that have been shown to interact with importin α molecules (24Sekimoto T. Imamoto N. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Yoneda Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7067-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 26Fagerlund R. Melén K. Kinnunen L. Julkunen I. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1754-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Recent mutational analyses suppose that leucine 407 and lysines 410 and 413 within the DNA binding domain of STAT1 function as an NLS and mediate binding to importin α5 (25Melén K. Kinnunen L. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16447-16455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 26Fagerlund R. Melén K. Kinnunen L. Julkunen I. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1754-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). To determine the possible interactions of STAT1-STAT2 dimers with other importin isoforms than α5, we stimulated the human NK-92 cell line with 1000 IU/ml of IFN-α for 30 min. Cell extracts were prepared, and the cellular proteins were allowed to bind to Sepharose-immobilized GST-importins α1, α3, α5, or α7 at +4 °C for 2 h, followed by an analysis of the bound STAT proteins by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 2, STAT1-STAT2 heterodimers were readily bound to importin α5, whereas no binding to importins α1, α3, or α7 in IFN-α-stimulated cells was detected. Clearly, binding of STAT1-STAT2 dimers to importin α5 is highly specific. Tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT Dimers, Influenza A NP, and SV40 Large T Antigen Bind to Different Importin α Isoforms—To characterize further STAT binding to different importin α isoforms, we used a baculovirus expression system to reconstitute STAT activation (26Fagerlund R. Melén K. Kinnunen L. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30072-30078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Coinfection of Sf 9 cells with recombinant Tyk2 and STAT protein expressing baculoviruses resulted in an efficient expression and tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 proteins. Tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 formed dimers, which enabled us to analyze the potential interactions of dimeric STAT complexes with importins (25Melén K. Kinnunen L. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16447-16455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 26Fagerlund R. Melén K. Kinnunen L. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30072-30078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, baculovirus-expressed STAT1 homodimers or STAT1-STAT2 heterodimers bound specifically to Sepharose-immobilized GST-importin α5 but not to importin α1, α3, or α7 isoforms. These results, together with those shown in Fig. 2 using natural IFN-α-stimulated cells, show that the reconstituted STAT activation in the baculovirus expression system is a reliable method to study STAT-importin α interactions. We also analyzed interactions of Sepharose-immobilized GST-importins α1, α3, α5, or α7 with baculovirus-expressed influenza A NP and SV40 large T antigen. Two NLSs have been identified in influenza A virus NP, a nonclassical NLS at the N terminus (34Wang P. Palese P. O'Neill R.E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1850-1856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a classical bipartite NLS in the middle of the molecule (35Weber F. Kochs G. Gruber S. Haller O. Virology. 1998; 250: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the N-terminal NLS of NP is involved in the interaction with importins (34Wang P. Palese P. O'Neill R.E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1850-1856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Neumann G. Castrucci M.R. Kawaoka Y. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9690-9700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we show that influenza A virus NP bound strongly to importins α1 and α5 and to a lesser extent to importin α3, whereas no marked binding to importin α7 isoform was detected (Fig. 3C). Importins α1 and α5 have been shown to bind efficiently SV40 large T antigen NLS peptide or T antigen NLS conjugated to BSA (24Sekimoto T. Imamoto N. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Yoneda Y.

Instead, our binding experiments of SV40 large T antigen with Sepharose-immobilized GST-importins revealed that full-length T antigen bound strongly to importin α3 and to a lesser extent to importin α1 but not to importin α5 or α7 isoforms (Fig. 3D), indicating that the natural context of an NLS can greatly affect its accessibility to importins. A C-terminal Unique NLS Binding Site, Including Arm Repeats 8 and 9 of Importin α5, Binds STATs—Because STAT NLS is formed by a cluster of basic amino acids within the DNA binding domain of STAT1 and STAT2 (25Melén K.

To analyze the role of arm repeats in STAT-importin α5 interaction, we created several mutations in the binding pockets of arm repeats 2–4 and 7–9 of importin α5 (Figs. 1 and 4).

Both proteins have phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2)-binding domains in their N termini, but these domains are structurally and functionally different. To understand the basis of their distinct properties, we measured the PtdIns(4,5)P2-dependent membrane binding of the epsin N-terminal homology (ENTH) domain and the AP180 N-terminal homology (ANTH) domain by means of surface plasmon resonance and monolayer penetration techniques and also calculated the effect of PtdIns(4,5)P2 on the electrostatic potential of these domains. PtdIns(4,5)P2 enhances the electrostatic membrane association of both domains; however, PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding exerts distinct effects on their membrane dissociation. Specifically, PtdIns(4,5)P2 induces the membrane penetration of the N-terminal α-helix of the ENTH domain, which slows the membrane dissociation of the domain and triggers the membrane deformation.

Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is an energetically demanding process that is necessary for a diverse number of cellular processes, such as nutrient uptake, removal of receptors from the cell surface, and synaptic vesicle recycling (1Marsh M. McMahon H.T. Science. 1999; 285: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 2Schmid S.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 511-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 3Brodsky F.M. Chen C.Y. Knuehl C. Towler M.C. Wakeham D.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 517-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). This process involves cooperation of clathrin, the AP-2 adaptor complex and a number of other accessory proteins, including epsin. The process of endocytosis occurs through four general steps including bud initiation, bud formation, bud constriction, and vesicle scission (2Schmid S.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 511-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 3Brodsky F.M. Chen C.Y. Knuehl C. Towler M.C. Wakeham D.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 517-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Initiation of the bud site is thought to occur by the membrane association of AP180 and epsin as well as the adaptor complex AP-2. These proteins recruit clathrin to the membrane. The bud then forms and constricts, while the activities of amphiphysin and endophilin remodel the membrane at the bud neck. Finally, the GTPase activity of dynamin is required for the release of the vesicle into the cytoplasm (4Hinshaw J.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 483-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Recently, the importance of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) 1The abbreviations used are: PtdIns(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; ANTH, AP180 N-terminal homology; ENTH, epsin N-terminal homology; Ins(1,4,5)P3, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate; POPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; POPE, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoehthanolamine; POPS, 1-palmitoyl2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; CHAPS, 3-[3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. in clathrin-mediated endocytosis has come to light (5Cremona O. De Camilli P. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1041-1052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, epsin and AP180, which are necessary for the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles, bind PtdIns(4,5)P2 through their conserved N-terminal domains (6Itoh T. Koshiba S. Kigawa T.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) is a highly conserved domain of ∼140 amino acids that has been identified in all epsins and binds PtdIns(4,5)P2 with high affinity and specificity (6Itoh T. Koshiba S. Kigawa T. Kikuchi A. Yokoyama S. Takenawa T. Science. 2001; 291: 1047-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 7Ford M.G. Pearse B.M. Higgins M.K. Vallis Y. Owen D.J. Gibson A.

Nature. 2002; 419: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). The ENTH domain is made of a superhelix of 7 α-helices with an eighth α-helix misaligned with the superhelical axis, which is structurally similar to the superhelical VHS domain (14Lohi O. Poussu A. Mao Y. Quiocho F. Lehto V.P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The AP180/CALM and HIP1/HIP1R protein families contain an N-terminal domain that is homologous to the ENTH domain and binds PtdIns(4,5)P2 (13De Camilli P. Chen H. Hyman J. Panepucci E. Bateman A. Brunger A.T. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). X-ray structural analysis of the AP180 N-terminal homology (ANTH) domains of AP180/CALM (7Ford M.G. Pearse B.M. Higgins M.K. Vallis Y. Owen D.J. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Science. 2001; 291: 1051-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar) showed that the ANTH domain is extended by one or more α-helices when compared with the ENTH domain. Both the AP180 ANTH domain and the epsin ENTH domain bind PtdIns(4,5)P2 with high specificity, but structurally in a different manner. The ANTH domain binds PtdIns(4,5)P2 via solvent-exposed Lys and His side chains on one side of the domain, and only the lipid headgroup is contacted by the protein (7Ford M.G. Pearse B.M. Higgins M.K. Vallis Y. Owen D.J. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Science. 2001; 291: 1051-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). The ENTH domain binds PtdIns(4,5)P2 in a pocket and makes extensive contacts with both the headgroup and glycerol backbone (8Ford M.G. Mills I.G. Peter B.J. Vallis Y. Praefcke G.J. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Nature. 2002; 419: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). On binding the PtdIns(4,5)P2 headgroup, residues 3–15 of the ENTH domain adopt an α-helical structure which makes up one side of the PtdIns(4,5)P2-binding pocket and provides ionic interactions. The outer surface of this amphipathic helix, termed helix 0, was proposed to lie in the plane of the lipid bilayer with the Leu6, Met10, and Ile13 residues buried into the hydrophobic phase. This insertion of helix 0 was proposed to displace the lipid headgroups thus driving membrane curvature (8Ford M.G. Mills I.G. Peter B.J. Vallis Y. Praefcke G.J. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Nature. 2002; 419: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). A number of mutations of the hydrophobic residues were used to advance this hypothesis; however, biophysical evidence for membrane insertion of the epsin ENTH domain has not been shown. In this study, we investigated the effect of PtdIns(4,5)P2 on the membrane binding of the epsin ENTH and the AP180 ANTH domains by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and monolayer analyses. Results from these measurements as well as the calculation of their electrostatic potential in the absence and presence of PtdIns(4,5)P2 indicate that the ENTH and ANTH domains have distinctly different modes of membrane interaction. Materials—1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-phosphoethanolamine (POPE), and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine (POPS) were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). 1,2-Dipalmitoyl derivatives of phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate, and PtdIns(4,5)P2 were a kind gift from Dr. Karol Bruzik. Phospholipid concentrations were determined by phosphate analysis (15Kates M. Techniques of Lipidology. 2nd Ed. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1986: 114-115Google Scholar). Restriction endonucleases and other enzymes for molecular biology were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). CHAPS and octyl glucoside were from Sigma and Fisher Scientific, respectively. The liposofast microextruder and 100-nm polycarbonate filters were from Avestin (Ottawa, Ontario). Pioneer L1 sensor chip was from Biacore AB (Piscataway, NJ). Mutagenesis and Protein Expression—The R114A mutant of epsin ENTH was prepared by the overlap extension polymerase chain reaction method (16Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar), and all other mutants were prepared as described previously (8Ford M.G. Mills I.G. Peter B.J. Vallis Y. Praefcke G.J. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Nature. 2002; 419: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Each construct was subcloned into the pGEX-4T-1 vector containing a N-terminal glutathione S-transferase fusion and transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α cells for plasmid isolation. After verifying the DNA sequence, the plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21 cells for protein expression. One liter of 2× YT medium (16 g of tryptone, 10 g of yeast extract, and 5 g of NaCl in 1 liter of H2O) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin was inoculated with BL21 cells harboring each construct and grown at 37 °C until absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.4. At this time, 20 mg of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added, and cells were then incubated at 25 °C for 16 h. Cells were harvested for 10 min at 4,000 × g, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.16 m NaCl, 50 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The solution was then sonicated for 8 min using a 30-s sonication followed by 30-s cooling on ice. This was followed by centrifugation at 48,000 × g to separate the soluble and insoluble fractions. The supernatant was filtered into a 50-ml tube, and 1 ml of GST·Tag™ resin (Novagen, Madison, WI) was added. The mixture was incubated on ice with gentle stirring (80 rpm) for 30 min. After this time, the mixture was poured onto a column, which was washed with 20 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.16 m NaCl. The column was then sealed and 1 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.16 m NaCl and 0.25 mm CaCl2 along with 2 units of thrombin were added to cleave the glutathione S-transferase tag. After 6 h at 25 °C, the protein was eluted from the column in 5 fractions using 1 ml of 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 0.16 m NaCl. Purity was checked on an 18% polyacrylamide gel, and samples were pooled and concentrated to 1 ml. Protein concentration was then determined using the BCA method (Pierce). The AP180 ANTH domain was purified as described previously (8Ford M.G. Mills I.G. Peter B.J. Vallis Y. Praefcke G.J. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Nature. 2002; 419: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Monolayer Penetration Experiments—The penetration of ENTH and ANTH domains into the phospholipid monolayer was measured at 23 °C by monitoring the change in surface pressure (π) at constant surface area using a circular Teflon trough (4-cm diameter and 1-cm depth) and Wilhelmy plate connected to a Cahn microbalance as described previously (17Bittova L. Sumandea M. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9665-9672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). A lipid monolayer containing various combinations of phospholipids was spread onto the subphase composed of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 0.16 m NaCl until the desired initial surface pressure (π0) was reached. After the signal stabilized (∼5 min), 50 μg of proteins were injected to the subphase through the hole in the wall of the trough, and the change in surface pressure (Δπ) was monitored for 45 min while stirring the subphase at 60 rpm. Typically, the Δπ value reached a maximum after 20 min. It has been shown empirically that Δπ caused by protein is mainly due to the penetration of the protein into the lipid monolayer. For example, in the case of the C2 domain of group IVA cytosolic phospholipase A2, excellent agreement was found between large Δπ caused by several residues in the calcium-binding loops (17Bittova L. Sumandea M. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9665-9672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and their actual membrane penetration measured by fluorescence (18Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17642-17650Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and electron spin resonance studies (19Ball A. Nielsen R. Gelb M.H. Robinson B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6282-6292Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The maximal Δπ value depended on the protein concentration and reached a saturation value (e.g. [epsin ENTH] ≥ 3.0 μg/ml); therefore, protein concentration in the subphase was maintained above such values to ensure that the observed Δπ represented a maximum value. The resulting Δπ was plotted versus π0 from which the critical surface pressure (πc) was determined as the x intercept (21Verger R. Pattus F. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1982; 30: 189-227Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 22Cho W. Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Kinetic and Equilibrium SPR Experiments—All SPR binding measurements were performed at 23 °C. The coating of the L1 sensor chip has been described in detail previously (23Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4218-4226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 24Stahelin R.V. Cho W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4672-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The sensor chip surface was washed and then coated by injecting 90 μl of vesicles containing various phospholipids (see “Results”) at 5 μl/min to give a response of 6,000 resonance units. Similarly, a control surface was coated with vesicles, typically without phosphoinositide of interest, to give the same resonance unit response as the active binding surface. Under our experimental conditions, no binding was detected to this control surface beyond the refractive index change for the ENTH and ANTH domains. Each lipid layer was stabilized by injecting 10 μl of 50 mm NaOH three times at 100 μl/min. Typically, no decrease in lipid signal was seen after the first injection. Kinetic SPR measurements were done at the flow rate of 30 μl/min. 30 μl of protein in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 0.16 m KCl was injected to give an association time of 60 s, while the dissociation was monitored for 400 s at which time the protein had completely dissociated. The lipid surface was washed with 10 μl of 50 mm NaOH before the next protein injection. After sensorgrams were obtained for five different concentrations of each protein within a 10-fold range of K d, each of the sensorgrams was corrected for refractive index change by subtracting the control surface response from it. The association and dissociation phases of all sensorgrams were globally fit to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model: protein + (protein-binding site on the vesicle) ↔ (complex) using BIAevalutation 3.0 software (Biacore) as described previously (24Stahelin R.V. Cho W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4672-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 25Stahelin R.V. Cho W. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 26Stahelin R.V.

The dissociation constant (K d) was then calculated from the equation, K d = k d/k a. Mass transport (27Myszka D.G. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 28Schuck P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1997; 26: 541-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) was not a limiting factor in our experiments, as change in flow rate (5 μl/min to 60 μl/min) did not affect kinetics of association and dissociation. After curve fitting, residual plots and χ2 values were checked to verify the validity of the binding model. Each data set was repeated three times to calculate a standard deviation. Also, K d values were separately determined from equilibrium SPR measurements. For these measurements, the flow rate was reduced to 2 μl/min to allow sufficient time for the association phase, which in turn allows resonance unit values to reach saturating response values (R eq). R eq values were then plotted versus protein concentrations (C), and the K d value was determined by a non-linear least squares analysis of the binding isotherm using an equation, R eq = R max/(1 + K d /C), where R max is a maximal R eq value. K d values obtained by both kinetic and equilibrium analysis for epsin ENTH and AP180 ANTH were in agreement (data not shown), thus validating the kinetic analysis. It should be noted that in our SPR analysis K d is defined in terms of not the molarity of phospholipids but the molarity of protein-binding sites on the vesicle. Thus, if each protein-binding site on the vesicle is composed of n lipids, nK d is the dissociation constant in terms of molarity of lipid monomer (22Cho W. Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Due to difficulty involved in accurate determination of the concentration of lipids coated on the sensor chip, only K d was determined in our SPR analysis and the relative affinity was calculated as a ratio of K d values assuming that n values are similar for wild type and mutants. This assumption is based on our finding that R max values, which are proportional to [total lipid]/n (22Cho W. Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), were similar (within 10%) for all proteins under our experimental conditions in which the sensor chip was coated with the same amount of lipids. Electrostatic Potential Computation—The electrostatic potentials of ENTH and ANTH domains with and without inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) were calculated with a modified version of the program DelPhi and visualized in the program GRASP (29Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5316) Google Scholar), as described previously (30Honig B. Nicholls A. Science. 1995; 268: 1144-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (2537) Google Scholar). In the panels of Fig. 3, the electrostatic potentials are represented by two-dimensional equipotential contours in 0.1 m KCl, with red and blue indicating negative and positive potentials, respectively. The electrostatic calculations performed used partial charges taken from the CHARMM27 (31Brooks B. Bruccoleri R. Olafson B. States D. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comp.

To see if PtdIns(4,5)P2 can also elicit the membrane penetration of ENTH and ANTH domains, we measured the interactions of epsin ENTH and AP180 ANTH domains with phospholipid monolayers in the presence and absence of PtdIns(4,5)P2. Phospholipid monolayers at the air-water interface serve as a highly sensitive tool to measure the membrane penetrating ability of protein (22Cho W. Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 34Lichtenbergova L. Yoon E.T. Cho W.

In these studies, POPC/POPE (80:20) or POPC/POPE/PtdIns(4,5)P2 (77:20:3) monolayers of a given initial surface pressure (π0) were spread at constant area and the change in surface pressure (Δπ) was monitored after the injection of the protein into the subphase. In general, Δπ is inversely proportional to π0 of the phospholipid monolayer and an extrapolation of the Δπ versus π0 plot yields the critical surface pressure (πc), which specifies an upper limit of π0 of a monolayer that a protein can penetrate into (21Verger R. Pattus F. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1982; 30: 189-227Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 22Cho W. Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Since the surface pressure of cell membranes and large unilamellar vesicles has been estimated to be in the range of 30–35 dyne/cm (37Blume A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 557: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 38Demel R.A. Geurts van Kessel W.S. Zwaal R.F. Roelofsen B. van Deenen L.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 406: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 39Marsh D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 183-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar), for a protein to penetrate these bilayer membranes its πc value should be above 30 dyne/cm. Fig. 1 shows that toward the POPC/POPE (80:20) monolayer both epsin ENTH and AP180 ANTH domains have low intrinsic penetrating ability with πc values of 21 and 24 dyne/cm, respectively. However, the addition of 3 mol % PtdIns(4,5)P2 to the monolayer (i.e. POPC/POPE/PtdIns(4,5)P2 (77:20:3)) increased the πc value of the epsin ENTH domain to 32 dyne/cm, suggesting that PtdIns(4,5)P2 might allow penetration of the domain into cell membranes and large unilamellar vesicles. The specific nature of PtdIns(4,5)P2 activation was evidenced by a much smaller effect of 3 mol % phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (Fig. 1) on the πc value for the epsin ENTH domain. Furthermore, neither 3 mol % phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate nor 30 mol % POPS had a significant effect (data not shown). Interestingly, the incorporation of 3 mol% PtdIns(4,5)P2 into the POPC/POPE (80:20) monolayer did not significantly change the πc value of the AP180 ANTH domain, showing that PtdIns(4,5)P2 does not induce the membrane penetration of the AP180 ANTH domain. This also suggests that the ANTH domain cannot effectively penetrate compactly packed lipid bilayers, including cell membranes, even in the presence of PtdIns(4,5)P2. Surface Plasmon Resonance Measurements of Membrane Binding of ENTH and ANTH Domains—The lipid headgroup specificity of the epsin ENTH domain and the AP180 ANTH domain has been determined using soluble inositol lipids. For instance, the epsin ENTH domain binds monomeric Ins(1,4,5)P3 (K d = 3.6 μm) 33 times more strongly than monomeric inositol 1,3,5-triphosphate (8Ford M.G. Mills I.G. Peter B.J. Vallis Y. Praefcke G.J. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Nature. 2002; 419: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Also, the epsin ENTH domain has 8-fold higher affinity for Ins(1,4,5)P3 than the AP180 ANTH domain (8Ford M.G. Mills I.G. Peter B.J. Vallis Y. Praefcke G.J. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Nature. 2002; 419: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). However, their specificity and affinity for membrane-incorporated phosphoinositides has not been fully investigated. We first measured the affinity of the epsin ENTH domain for various phosphoinositide-containing vesicles (i.e. POPC/POPE/phosphoinositide (77:20:3)) using POPC/POPE (80:20) vesicles as a control. As listed in Table I, the epsin ENTH domain showed high affinity for POPC/POPE/PtdIns(4,5)P2 (77:20:3) vesicles (K d = 23 ± 7 nm). It should be noted that for our SPR vesicle binding analysis K d is defined as the dissociation constant for vesicle binding (not for phosphoinositide binding) in terms of the molarity of protein-binding sites on the vesicle, which is composed of n lipids (22Cho W. Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) (see “Experimental Procedures”). Thus, the large difference between the K d for monomeric Ins(1,4,5)P3 and the K d for POPC/POPE/PtdIns(4,5)P2 (77:20:3) vesicles does not reflect the different affinities of the domain for monomeric and membrane-incorporated PtdIns(4,5)P2. When compared with POPC/POPE/PtdIns(4,5)P2 (77:20:3) vesicles, the epsin ENTH domain had much lower affinity for POPC/POPE/phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (77:20:3) and POPC/POPE/phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (77:20:3) vesicles. Lower estimates of K d for these vesicles assessed from the protein concentrations employed for the SPR measurements were 10 μm, indicating that the epsin ENTH domain prefers membrane-incorporated PtdIns(4,5)P2 to other phosphoinositides by more than two orders of magnitude.Table IBinding parameters for epsin-ENTH, AP180-ANTH, and epsin ENTH mutants determined from SPR analysisProteinskakdkdFold increase in Kd aIncrease in Kd relative to binding POPC/POPE/PtdIns(4,5)P2 (77:20:3) vesicles.m-1 s-1s-1mPOPC/POPE/PtdIns(4,5)P2(77:20:3)ENTH(1.3 ± 0.3) × 106(3.0 ± 0.6) × 10-2(2.3 ± 0.7) × 10-81ENTH L6Q(4.3 ± 0.5) × 105(1.2 ± 0.4) × 10-1(2.8 ± 1.0) × 10-712ENTH M10Q(2.4 ± 0.3) × 105(2.1 ± 0.6) × 10-1(8.8 ± 2.7) × 10-738ENTH R63L/H73LNMbNot measurable.NMNMENTH R114A(2.2 ± 0.5) × 105(2.3 ± 0.4) × 10-2(1.0 ± 0.4) × 10-74ANTH(4.8 ± 0.6) × 105(1.3 ± 0.4) × 10-1(2.7 ± 0.9) × 10-712POPC/POPE/PtdIns(4,5)P2(79.5:20:0.5)ENTH(2.4 ± 0.5) × 105(6.1 ± 0.7) × 10-2(2.5 ± 0.6) × 10-711ANTH(5.3 ± 0.7) × 104(1.8 ± 0.5) × 10-1(3.4 ± 1.0) × 10-6148POPC/POPE/PtdIns(4,5)P2(77:20:3) with 0.5 m KClENTH(2.9 ± 0.5) × 104(9.7 ± 0.8) × 10-3(3.3 ± 0.6) × 10-714ANTHNMNMNMa Increase in Kd relative to binding POPC/POPE/PtdIns(4,5)P2 (77:20:3) vesicles.b Not measurable.

For the same POPC/POPE/PtdIns(4,5)P2 (77:20:3) vesicles; however, the AP180 ANTH domain showed 12-fold lower affinity than the epsin ENTH domain. This difference in K d is due to a 2.7-fold larger k a and a 4.3-fold smaller k d for the ENTH domain. The membrane association of peripheral proteins can be accelerated by long range electrostatic interactions (24Stahelin R.V. Cho W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4672-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and the larger k a for the ENTH domain is consistent with its more positive electrostatic potential, especially around the PtdIns(4,5)P2-binding site when compared with the ANTH domain (6Itoh T.

However, macrophages have also been shown to express a constitutive NOS isoform, the function of which remains obscure. Herein, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMOs) from wild-type and endothelial NOS (eNOS) knock-out (KO) mice have been used to assess the role of this constitutive NOS isoform in the regulation of macrophage activation. BMDMOs from eNOS KO animals exhibited reduced nuclear factor-kappaB activity, iNOS expression, and NO production after exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as compared with cells derived from wild-type mice. Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) was identified in BMDMOs at a mRNA and protein level, and activation of cells with LPS resulted in accumulation of cyclic GMP. Moreover, the novel non-NO-based sGC activator, BAY 41-2272, enhanced BMDMO activation in response to LPS, and the sGC inhibitor 1H-(1,2,4)oxadiazolo(4,3-a)quinoxalin-1-one attenuated activation. These observations provide the first demonstration of a pathophysiological role for macrophage eNOS in regulating cellular activation and suggest that NO derived from this constitutive NOS isoform, in part via activation of sGC, is likely to play a pivotal role in the initiation of an inflammatory response."

We show that in addition to pleiotropic effects on plant development, this mutation also leads to the production of terminal flowers. The flowers show homeotic transformations of petals into stamens and sepals into filamentous structures and produce ectopic carpels.

The organization of chromatin structure provides a major barrier to gene transcription. In eukaryotic cells, there exist enzymatic activities to modify chromatin structure to control DNA accessibility. These activities include ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes, represented by the Swi/Snf complexes (1Peterson C.L. Workman J.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), and the histone acetyltransferases (HAT) 1The abbreviations used are: HAT, histone acetyltransferase; RT, reverse transcription.1The abbreviations used are: HAT, histone acetyltransferase; RT, reverse transcription. and histone deacetylases (2Brown C.E.

Sci. 2000; 25: 121-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). HATs and histone deacetylases can be targeted to promoters to activate or repress gene transcription; many regulated genes employ HATs to achieve transcriptional activation (4Pollard K.J. Peterson C.L. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 771-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Although an exact mechanism of how acetylation of histones contributes to transcriptional activation has not been known, it has been thought that acetylation of nucleosomal histones leads to relaxation of chromatin structure in such a way that transcription factors can gain access to chromosomal DNA (5Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1546) Google Scholar). However, there are cases where increased histone acetylation correlates with repression (6Deckert J. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2726-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 7Sheldon L.A. Becker M. Smith C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32423-32426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition, acetylation of non-histone factors might have activating or repressing effects on transcription (8Munshi N. Merika M. Yie J. Senger K. Chen G. Thanos D. Mol.

A variety of HATs have been discovered (11Lusser A. Kolle D. Loidl P. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 59-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Many of them are related to yeast Gcn5, a member of two transcription regulatory complexes, SAGA and ADA, within which Gcn5 serves as a nucleosomal HAT, capable of acetylating histone H3 in nucleosomes (12Grant P.A. Duggan L. Cote J. Roberts S.M. Brownell J.E. Candau R. Ohba R. Owen-Hughes T. Allis C.D. Winston F. Berger S.L. Workman J.L.

In yeast and animal cells, Gcn5 family members and CBP/p300 also acetylate non-histone proteins such as transcription factors (14Sterner D.E. Berger S.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 435-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar, 9Munshi N. Agalioti T. Lomvardas S. Merika M. Chen G. Thanos D. Science. 2001; 293: 1133-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Most HATs have a bromodomain (15Winston F. Allis C.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 601-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), which is an acetyl-lysine binding motif found in a variety of chromatin-related proteins (16Zeng L. Zhou M.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Deletion mutations of GCN5 induce both up- and down-regulation of 4% of genes in yeast (17Lee T.I. Causton H.C. Holstege F.C. Shen W.C. Hannett N. Jennings E.G. Winston F. Green M.R. Young R.A. Nature. 2000; 405: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) and embryo growth defects in mice (18Yamauchi T. Yamauchi J. Kuwata T. Tamura T. Yamashita T. Bae N. Westphal H. Ozato K. Nakatani Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11303-11306Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The Arabidopsis GCN5 (AtGCN5) protein shows significant similarities to the HAT catalytic domains and bromodomains of previously described Gcn5 homologues (19Stockinger E.J. Mao Y. Regier M.K. Triezenberg S.J. Thomashow M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1524-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). It has been recently reported that a T-DNA insertion in AtGCN5 affects also about 5% of 8200 tested genes in vegetative tissues and produces pleiotropic effects on plant growth and development (20Vlachonasios E.K. Thomashow M.F. Trizenberg S.J. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 626-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). This suggests that the function of AtGCN5 in gene regulation may be similar to that proposed for the Gcn5 family members and that plant Gcn5 proteins may be involved in the control of specific developmental pathways. One of the plant characteristic developmental pathways is the floral organogenesis. Flowers contain four types of organs, sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels, that are arranged in four concentric whorls. The floral organ identity is specified combinatorially by three classes of homeotic genes, termed A, B, and C (21Bowman J.L. Smyth D.R. Meyerowitz E.M. Plant Cell. 1989; 1: 37-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). Each class of the genes is active in two adjacent whorls: class A in whorls one and two, B in whorls two and three, and C in whorls three and four. One well studied example is the C function gene AGAMOUS (AG), which not only specifies stamen and carpel identity but also limits regeneration of floral meristem cells (21Bowman J.L. Smyth D.R. Meyerowitz E.M. Plant Cell. 1989; 1: 37-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar, 22Bowman J.L. Drews G.N. Meyerowitz E.M. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 749-758PubMed Google Scholar). Proper temporal and spatial expression of AG is central to flower pattern formation. In wild-type plants, AG mRNA is expressed only in the central region of the floral meristem and in the inner two whorls of a developing flower (21Bowman J.L. Smyth D.R. Meyerowitz E.M. Plant Cell. 1989; 1: 37-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar, 22Bowman J.L. Drews G.N. Meyerowitz E.M. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 749-758PubMed Google Scholar). This spatial and temporal expression pattern is regulated by a number of positive and negative regulators. The major repressor of AG in the first and second whorls is APETALA2 (AP2). Loss of AP2 function results in AG ectopic expression in the outer whorls and the corresponding homeotic transformations of these organs to carpels and stamens (23Drews G.N. Bowman J.L. Meyerowitz E.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 991-1002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). WUSCHEL (WUS), a homeodomain protein that specifies stem cell identity and is expressed in a few cells in the center of shoot apical meristems (24Mayer K.F. Schoof H. Haecker A. Lenhard M. Jurgens G. Laux T. Cell. 1998; 95: 805-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar), induces AG expression in the center of developing flowers (25Lohmann J.U. Hong R.L. Hobe M. Busch M.A. Parcy F. Simon R. Weigel D. Cell. 2001; 105: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 26Lenhard M. Bohnert A. Jurgens G. Laux T. Cell. 2001; 105: 805-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). In mature flowers, AG in turn represses WUS in mature flowers to terminate floral meristems (25Lohmann J.U. Hong R.L. Hobe M. Busch M.A. Parcy F. Simon R. Weigel D. Cell. 2001; 105: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 26Lenhard M. Bohnert A. Jurgens G. Laux T. Cell. 2001; 105: 805-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). In this work we show a regulatory function of AtGCN5 in controlling floral meristem activity by characterizing a T-DNA insertion mutation of the gene. We show that in addition to pleiotropic effects on plant growth and development observed also in another mutation of the gene (20Vlachonasios E.K. Thomashow M.F. Trizenberg S.J. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 626-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), this mutation induces the production of terminal flowers on the inflorescence. Moreover, homeotic transformations of flower organs occur in the flowers. We show that the floral phenotypes correlate to alterations of the expression domains of WUS and AG within floral meristems. Our results suggest that AtGCN5 is involved in the regulation of the spatial expression of key regulatory genes required for floral meristem function. Plant Materials—Arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown in a greenhouse under long day conditions (16 h of light) at 19.5 °C (day) and 17.5 °C (night). T-DNA insertion mutant plants (DLX8 from the Versailles collection) were in the Ws background. The pAG-I:GUS and WUS:GUS transgenic lines were kindly provided respectively by L. Sieburth (27Deyholos M.K. Sieburth L.E. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1799-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and T. Laux (28Grob-Hardt R. Lenhard M. Laux T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1129-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and were crossed with Ws and DLX8 plants. Genomic DNA and Total RNA Extraction, PCR, RT-PCR, and Northern Blots—Arabidopsis leaves were used for genomic DNA extraction. PCR reactions were carried out by using the Promega TflI polymerase in the presence of 2% Me2SO. The primers used to check the T-DNA insertion in AtGCN5 were: 5′-CTGGTTGGACCCCAGATCAGTGGGGGC-3′, 5′-GGTATCGGGGAGTTGTAAGTTCTAC-3′, which were specific for AtGCN5, and 5′-CTACAAATTGCCTTTTCTTATCGA-3′, specific for the T-DNA sequence. Total RNA was isolated from the leaves or flowers with the TRIzol reagents (Invitrogen). First strand cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of total RNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). For semi-quantitative PCR analysis, 2 μl of the reverse transcription were used per PCR in a final volume of 20 μl. The primers were as follows: for the 5′ fragment of AtGCN5, 5′-CTGCTTCGATTGACTCTCACTCTTCCC-3′ (primer 1) and 5′-CGTGCATGTTGTTTCAAGTGGTTCATC-3′ (primer 2); for the 3′ fragment of AtGCN5, 5′-GCAATCACAGCAGATGAACAAG-3′ (primer 3) and 5′-CCATCTTCTTCTATTGAGATTTAGCACCAG-3′ (primer 4), as indicated in Fig. 1A; for SUPERMAN, 5′-GAGCTTGCACATATGGAGAG-3′ and 5′-CTGCCCTATATCTTGGTGAG-3′; for AGAMOUS, 5′-GTTGATTTGCATAACGATAACCAGA-3′ and 5′-CACTGATACAACATTCATCGGAT-3′; for APETALA1 (AP1), 5′-GCCGAGAGACAGCTTATTGC and 5′-AAGGATGCTGGATTTGATGC; for APETALA2 (AP2), 5′-AAGATATGCGGCTCAGGATG-3′ and 5′-TCTGCAGCCAATTTTGATGA-3′; for APETALA3 (AP3), 5′-tgtttgggccactcaatatg and 5′-ggttctggtggaaacgaaga; for WUSCHEL (WUS), 5′-gtctgaactagctcttacgccggt-3′ and 5′-tagccatgtctatggatctatgg-3′; for CLAVATA1 (CLV1), 5′-CGTGGAAGCTGCAAAGGCTTGTG and 5′-CCTGGGGTCAACAATCGCAACAAC; for SHOOT MERISTEMLESS1 (STM1), 5′-CTTTAAGCTCTCTATCCTCAGCTTG and 5′-GCCCATCATCACATCACATC; for actin 2, 5′-CTAAGCTCTCAAGATCAAAGGCTTA-3′ and 5′-TTAACATTGCAAAGAGTTTCAAGGT-3′. The PCR products were electrophoresed, blotted onto a Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and hybridized with 32P-labeled probes made by using the Random Primer kit (Appligene). For Northern blots, 10 μg of total RNA were separated by electrophoresis in a denaturing agarose gel, blotted, and hybridized with 32P-labeled PCR products. Atgcn5 Cloning and Complementation—Atgcn5 cDNA was amplified as two fragments by RT-PCR from Ws leaf mRNA by using the primer sets as described above. The PCR fragments were cloned into pGEM-T (Promega) and sequenced. The fragments were assembled by using a unique KpnI site present in the overlapping region of the fragments. The full-length cDNA was further cloned under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter (35S::AtGCN5) and introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens (HBA10S). DLX8 plants were transformed using the floral dip method (29Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Seeds from the T1 plants were selected on 0.5× Murashige and Skoog medium containing 50 mg/liter gentamycin. Gentamycin-resistant plantlets were transferred to soil and grown in the greenhouse under long day conditions. The presence of the 35S::AtGCN5 insertion was checked by PCR. Western Blotting—Nuclear proteins were isolated from rosette leaves, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and incubated first with a polyclonal rabbit anti-acetylated histone H3 antibody (Chemicon International) and then with a goat anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Bio-Rad). Detection of the target proteins was performed by chemiluminescence using ECL+ System (Amersham Biosciences). The bands were scanned, and their densities were quantified at >50 locations. GUS Staining—Inflorescence were prefixed in 90% acetone at room temperature for 20 min, rinsed in staining buffer without 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-glucoronic acid (X-Gluc), infiltrated with staining solution (100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 5 mm potassium-ferricyanide, 1 mm X-Gluc) under a vacuum for 15 min, and incubated at 37 °C for 14 h. After a progressive dehydration in a series ethanol concentrations up to 70%, samples were fixed and embedded in paraplast plus (Sherwood Medical Corp., St. Louis, MO). Eight-μm sections were performed and observed under a Zeiss light microscope. Scanning Electron Microscope Analyses—For scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S-3000) analysis, samples were slowly frozen at –18 °C under a partial vacuum on the Peltier stage before observation under the environmental secondary electron detector mode. Inactivation of AtGCN5 Results in Pleiotropic Effects on Plant Development—Searching for insertion mutations within Arabidopsis HAT genes led to the identification of a T-DNA insertion line, DLX8, from the Versailles collection. The insertion site was located in the 10th intron of AtGCN5, disrupting the bromodomain-coding region (Fig. 1A). This mutant line seemed to contain a single insertion due to offspring segregating three to one for kanamycin resistance. A third of kanamycin-resistant plants showed serious growth defects with a smaller plant size and loss of apical dominance during later growth stages (Fig. 2A). PCR results confirmed that plants showing this phenotype corresponded to homozygous T-DNA insertion mutants AtGCN5 (not shown). The wild-type phenotype was restored when the mutant plants were complemented by transformation with a 35S::GCN5 construct (not shown). High levels of AtGCN5 mRNA were detected in different organs of the wild-type plants (Ref. 19Stockinger E.J. Mao Y. Regier M.K. Triezenberg S.J. Thomashow M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1524-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar and data not shown). RT-PCR experiments with a primer set corresponding to the bromodomain region of the gene showed no AtGCN5 expression in the homozygous mutant plants. A weaker band was amplified from the same RNA samples when a primer pair corresponding to sequences before the T-DNA insertion was used (Fig. 1B). This suggests that a hybrid RNA with T-DNA sequences was produced but stably accumulated. The acetylation level of histone H3 was compared between the wild-type and the mutant plants by Western blots using antibodies against acetylated histone H3. The results showed a reduction of histone H3 acetylation in the mutant plants (Fig. 1C), indicating that AtGCN5 is involved in vivo in histone H3 acetylation and that other acetyltransferases are also implicated in the acetylation. The mutation strongly affected the leaf morphology. Rosette leaf expansion was reduced, leading to smaller and upward-curled rosette leaves with slight serrations of leaf margins (Fig. 2B). The first 10–12 flowers produced from an inflorescence had a disorganized structure, although the overall size of those flowers was not affected (Fig. 2B). In late-arising flowers, homeotic transformation of flower organs was observed (see Fig. 5 and next paragraph). The DLX8 plants were partially fertile, producing few and deformed siliques and seeds (Fig. 2B). AtGCN5 Is Required to Regulate the Floral Meristem Activity through the WUSCHEL/AGAMOUS Pathway—Careful examination of early produced mutant flowers found that the identity of sepals in whorl one, petals in whorl two, stamens in whorl three, and carpels in whorl four was not altered (Fig. 2B) except that an increase in stamen number per flower was observed (Table I). After the production of about 10–12 flowers, the inflorescence gave rise to flowers in which the sepals of whorl one were not present. The organs produced in this whorl either had a filamentous structure or aborted during growth (see Fig. 4A). Organs in whorl two were transformed into stamens, consequently producing supernumerary stamens (see Fig. 4A). Extra carpel-like organs were observed in some flowers (see Fig. 4, A and B). The aberrant terminal flowers appeared at apices of inflorescence branches, leading to termination of the inflorescence meristem (see Fig. 4, C and D). In addition, the growth of other flowers previously produced within the same inflorescence was inhibited or aborted (see Fig. 4A).Table IAverage stamen numbers per flowerDLX8Wild typeStamens/flower6.9 ± 0.95.7 ± 0.5 Open table in a new tab The terminal flower phenotypes were reminiscent of plants overexpressing AG under the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter (30Mizukami Y. Ma H. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 393-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the expression levels of AG in DLX8 flowers by RT-PCR and RNA blots and found that the expression levels of AG were increased in flowers of the mutant plants (Fig. 3). To examine whether the AG expression domain was altered or not, we crossed a pAG-I::GUS transgenic line (27Deyholos M.K. Sieburth L.E. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1799-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) with DLX8 and wild-type Ws ecotype plants. F2 inflorescence from the crosses were stained to detect GUS expression. The mutant flowers were more darkly stained than the wild-type transgenic flowers (see Fig. 5, A and B). GUS expression could be seen throughout the terminal flower in DLX8 (see Fig. 5C). In fact, the AG promoter activity was detectable in the primordia of the outer whorls of the terminal flower (see Fig. 5D), suggesting that AG was activated early during floral organogenesis in the mutant inflorescence. In the non-terminal flowers of the mutant, the AG promoter activity in the mutant was detected not only in whorls three and four as observed in the wild-type flowers (see Fig. 5E) but also in the base of sepals and petals (whorls one and two) (see Fig. 5F). The GUS expression domain was extended to the pedicel of the flowers (see Fig. 5F). These observations indicate that the expression domain of AG was enlarged in DLX8 plants. Because in wild-type plants WUS activates AG expression in the center of developing flowers and misexpression of WUS in developing flowers under the control of floral-stage-specific promoters induced similar but more severe phenotypes (25Lohmann J.U. Hong R.L. Hobe M. Busch M.A. Parcy F. Simon R. Weigel D. Cell. 2001; 105: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 26Lenhard M. Bohnert A. Jurgens G. Laux T. Cell. 2001; 105: 805-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), we therefore examined the expression of WUS in DLX8. Using RT-PCR, we detected a clear increase of WUS expression in the mutant flowers (Fig. 3). In wild-type plants, WUS is expressed in a few cells in the inner region of the shoot meristem. To examine the expression domain of WUS in the DLX8 plants, we crossed a WUS::GUS transgenic line (28Grob-Hardt R. Lenhard M. Laux T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1129-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) with DLX8 and wild-type Ws ecotype plants. F2 young inflorescence from the crosses were stained to detect GUS activity. In the wild-type background, the GUS activity was relatively weak and detected in a few cells within the floral meristems (see Fig. 5, G and I). In the DLX8 background, the GUS activity was higher than the wild type (compare Fig. 5, H and G) and was detected throughout the apical meristem from the primary inflorescence, even in the primordia of the first whorls of developing flowers (Fig. 5J). However, no GUS activity was detected in the mature flowers (not shown). This enlargement of the expression domain of the WUS promoter correlates to that of AG in DLX8 flowers, suggesting that the induction of AG expression in the floral outer whorls may be due to the expansion of WUS expression in the mutant. Because the major repressor of AG in the first and second whorls is AP2 that is expressed throughout the floral meristem (23Drews G.N. Bowman J.L. Meyerowitz E.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 991-1002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar), we therefore examined the expression level of AP2 in DLX8. We found that the mRNA level of AP2 as well as another A function gene APETALA 1 (AP1) (31Mandel A.M. Gustafson-Brown C. Savidge B. Yanofsky M.F. Nature. 1992; 360: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar) in DLX8 flowers was slightly reduced when compared with that in the wild-type plants (Fig. 3). The expression of a B-function gene APETALA3 (AP3) was not significantly changed (not shown). Inhibition of histone deacetylation by antisense expression of AtHD1 induces ectopic expression of SUPERMAN (SUP) (32Tian L. Chen Z.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), which controls floral whorl boundaries (33SaKai H. Medrano L.J. Meyerowitz E.M. Nature. 1995; 378: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). However, the mRNA level of SUP, was not affected in DLX8 (Fig. 3). To know whether AtGNC5 affects the expression of shoot apical meristem regulatory genes, we checked the mRNA levels of SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM) (34Long J.A. Moan E.I. Medford J.I. Barton M.K. Nature. 1996; 397: 66-69Crossref Scopus (1226) Google Scholar) and CLAVATA 1 (CLV1) (35Clark S.E. Williams R.W. Meyerowitz E.M. Cell. 1997; 89: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) in DLX8 plants. No significant change was detected when compared with wild-type plants (Fig. 3). This is consistent with the normal appearance of shoot apical meristems observed in DLX8 (not shown). The recessive nature of the DLX8 mutation and the complementation experiments indicate that this is a loss of function mutation. DLX8 plants may still produce a low level of a truncated AtGCN5 protein. However, without the bromodomain, this protein would be unable to bind to promoter nucleosomes. This is consistent with the lower levels of H3 acetylation in the mutant. In addition, a mutant allele of AtGCN5 showing pleiotropic phenotypes has been recently published (20Vlachonasios E.K. Thomashow M.F. Trizenberg S.J. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 626-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). It is, therefore, unlikely that the phenotype we observed is due to any dominant effect of the truncated protein, although it is not excluded that the truncated protein retains some function. The ubiquitous expression pattern of AtGCN5 and the pleiotropic effects of its mutation suggest that it functions in the regulation of many genes required for different biological processes. The mutation effects might be induced as a consequence of the reduction of histone H3 acetylation. Whether more dramatic reduction of histone acetylation levels induces severer phenotypes or affects more genes awaits the analysis of an allelic series of AtGCN5 mutants and a multiple knockout of several HAT genes. Histone acetylation/deacetylation appears to be a general regulatory mechanism responsible for controlling plant development. Blocking histone deacetylation by antisense expression of AtHD1 also induces pleiotropic effects in transgenic plants (32Tian L. Chen Z.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Gcn5 homologues in yeast and animal cells are usually recruited to promoters via protein interactions with promoter-specific transcription factors. In yeast this acetyltransferase is required for the expression of a subset (4%) of genes (17Lee T.I. Causton H.C. Holstege F.C. Shen W.C. Hannett N. Jennings E.G. Winston F. Green M.R. Young R.A. Nature. 2000; 405: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Recent analysis by DNA microarray shows that the mutation of AtGCN5 induces expression changes of about 5% of the tested 8200 genes in Arabidopsis aerial vegetative tissues, with 75% of the genes up-regulated and 25% down-regulated (20Vlachonasios E.K. Thomashow M.F. Trizenberg S.J. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 626-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Changes in gene expression induced by the mutation of AtGNC5 in other stages of development or organs such as the flower is not known. Similar approaches would be helpful to detect changes of gene expression in the floral meristem induced by the mutation of AtGCN5. We have shown that the DLX8 mutation induces the production of terminal flowers and floral organ homeotic transformations (Fig. 4). However, in the work reported by Vlachonasios et al. (20Vlachonasios E.K. Thomashow M.F. Trizenberg S.J. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 626-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), there is no description of any terminal flower or organ transformation in their mutant allele, although aberrant early formed flowers have been shown. One explanation might be that their T-DNA insertion is in the last exon of the gene, which may be less severe than the DLX8 insertion that disrupts the coding region of the bromodomain. Consistent with the floral phenotypes that we have observed in DLX8 plants, the expression domain of AG is expanded to the outer whorls of the floral organs. We have found that among a few known regulators of AG, WUS expression domain that is restricted normally to a few cells in the apical meristems is largely expanded in floral and inflorescence meristems. Therefore, it is likely that the induction of AG expression is a consequence of the expansion of the WUS expression domain in DLX8. Higher levels of AG in turn repress WUS to terminate the inflorescence meristems in DLX8. A slight reduction of A function gene (AP1 and AP2) expression may be a consequence of the increased expression of AG that is antagonistic to A function genes. This indicates that AtGCN5 is required to control floral meristem regulatory gene expression, which possibly restricts the WUS expression domain within the floral meristem. We noted that the misexpression of WUS and AG was detected not only in the terminal flowers but also in more precociously produced flowers (Fig. 5). It is not known why these flowers do not show homeotic transformation but show supernumerary stamens (Table I). One possibility may be that during the growth misexpressed WUS or AG protein accumulates to a threshold level, leading to homeotic phenotypes. Histone acetyltransferases are usually required for gene activation. However, direct repression of gene expression by Gcn5 family members has been documented (10Ricci A.R. Genereaux J. Brandl C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4033-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The observation that the two floral meristem genes show increased expression in the mutants indicates that AtGCN5 plays a negative role on the expression of the genes. Our results can not distinguish between the direct and indirect effect of AtGNC5 on the expression of the genes. One possibility is that the mutation of AtGCN5 reduced the expression of a repressor of WUS. Alternatively, AtGCN5 might act directly on the promoter of WUS, recruiting a repressor of WUS transcription. In summary, our results indicate that AtGCN5 is involved in the control of a specific plant development pathway by regulating the expression domains of WUS and AG in the floral meristem.

Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 1999; 23: 45-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), little is known regarding the functions of poly(P) and the effects of poly(P) on mammalian cells. Recently, the involvement of poly(P) in apoptosis and in modulation of the mineralization process in bone tissue (5Schröder H.C. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 1999; 23: 45-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 6Leyhausen G. Lorenz B. Zhu H. Geurtsen W. Bohnensack R. Muller W.E.G. Schröder H.C. J. Bone Miner.

Because there has been no report concerning the direct effect of poly(P) on mammalian cells and because poly(P) is widely distributed in mammalian tissues and plasma (5Schröder H.C. Prog. Mol.

Based on this idea, we first studied in this report the effect of poly(P) on mammalian cell growth or proliferation in vitro and revealed the novel poly(P) functions concerning the modulation of mitogenic activity of fibroblast growth factors (FGF) (8Marshall N.J.

Materials—Normal dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) isolated from adult human were purchased from BioWhittaker, Inc. Normal human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) isolated from adult human were provided by Dr. Nishimura (Osaka Dental University). Balb/c 3T3 cells were from Riken Cell Bank (Tsukuba, Japan). Poly(P) type 65 (sodium salts with average chain length of 65 phosphate residues) was purchased from Sigma. Concentrations of poly(P) are given in terms of phosphate residues. As the control of poly(P), NaPO4 buffer (orthophosphate) was used. The pH of the NaPO4 buffer was adjusted to 7.0 by mixing the same concentrations of Na2HPO4 and NaH2PO4 solution. MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxy-phenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) cell proliferation assay kit was from Promega. Human recombinant acidic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-1) and basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) were from Toyobo (Osaka, Japan). Anti FGF-2 antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Assay for Cell Proliferation—Cells were seeded to 96-multiwell plates at 5 × 103 cells/well (100 μl/well) and cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium (for NHDF) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal essential medium (D-MEM) (for Balb/c 3T3 and HGF) containing 10% FBS for 24 h. After cells had adhered, the medium was replaced with Eagle's minimal essential medium or D-MEM without FBS and cells were further incubated for 48 h. The medium was replaced again with an appropriate medium described under the following sections and figure legends. After incubation at 37 °C, cell number was directly counted using hematocytometer after trypsinization or was evaluated by MTS assay (8Marshall N.J. Goodwin C.J. Holt S.J. Growth Regul. 1995; 5: 69-84PubMed Google Scholar). For MTS assay, the medium was replaced with 100 μl of Eagle's minimal essential medium (without Phenol Red) and 25 μl of mixture of MTS (Promega) and phenazine methosulfate solution (2 μg/ml MTS, 0.92 μg/ml phenazine methosulfate) was added to each well. After incubation for 75 min at 37 °C, the absorbance at 490 nm of each well was measured. The cell number was quantified by means of the bioreduction activity of viable cells Preparation of Short Chain [32P]poly(P)—Long chain [32P]poly(P) was synthesized by using purified Escherichia coli polyphosphate kinase and purified as described previously (9Ahn K. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11734-11739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To prepare short chain [32P]poly(P) (average chain length of around 65 phosphate residues), the long chain [32P]poly(P) was hydrolyzed by 20 mm HCl for 2 min at 95 °C and the hydrolyzed poly(P) was separated by 15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis together with poly(P) type 65 as a maker. The conditions of gel electrophoresis were the same as those described in the legend of Fig. 3. The gel was stained by 0.05% toluidine blue containing 5% glycerol. The portion of the gel corresponding to the position of poly(P) type 65 was cut, and short chain [32P]poly(P) was isolated from the gel. Isolated gel was soaked in H2O and shaken at room temperature for 2 h. After brief centrifugation, the supernatant was collected and short chain [32P]poly(P) was recovered from the gel. Assay for Binding between FGF-2 and High Affinity Surface Receptors—The assay procedure was basically followed as described previously (10Fannon M. Nugent M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17949-17956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Confluent Balb/c 3T3 cells were plated onto 60-mm dishes at 35,000 cells/cm2 in D-MEM with 10% FBS at 37 °C. After 24 h, the medium was changed to D-MEM with 2% FBS with 50 mm sodium chlorate to remove heparin sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG). Cells were further incubated for 72 h at 37 °C and were then washed once with a binding buffer (D-MEM and 25 mm HEPES) at 4 °C. A fresh binding buffer was added (4 ml/well), and cells were incubated at 4 °C for 10 min. FGF-2 was added at the indicated concentrations, and cells were incubated at 4 °C for 2.5 h. At the end of the binding period, cells were placed on ice and washed three times with ice-cold binding buffer. Cell surface receptor-bound FGF-2 was extracted with two washes (one 5-min wash and one rapid wash, 0.5 ml each/dish) at room temperature using 2 m NaCl in 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0. Washed solutions (2 × 0.5 μl) containing the extracted cell surface receptor-bound FGF-2 were collected, and 5 ml of 8% bovine serum albumin was added to each sample as a carrier protein. Trichloroacetic acid was added to the final concentration of 5%, and precipitated proteins were pelleted by centrifugation. After removal of the supernatant, the protein pellet was neutralized by 1 n KOH and dissolved by SDS-PAGE sample buffer. FGF-2 was separated by 15% SDS-PAGE and visualized by Western blotting. Stimulation of Cell Growth by Adding Poly(P) into Culture Media—Intriguingly, poly(P) stimulated the proliferation of both NHDF and HGF cells in the absence of serum (Fig. 1, A and B). NHDF and HGF were grown continuously after 25–110 h of incubation with poly(P), whereas there was almost no growth of cells incubated with Na-PO4 buffer or with media only. To rule out the possibility that poly(P) enhances the reduction activity of mitochondria resulting in the higher value of absorbance as measured by the MTS method (8Marshall N.J. Goodwin C.J. Holt S.J. Growth Regul. 1995; 5: 69-84PubMed Google Scholar) regardless of the cell number, cell growth was monitored by counting the number of cells. The number of viable cells after 3 days of incubation is shown in Fig. 1C. In agreement with the result of measurement by the MTS method, the number of cells increased by ∼2.8-fold after 72 h of incubation with poly(P). However, no proliferation of cells incubated with medium containing NaPO4 buffer was observed. Enhancement of Mitogenic Activity of FGFs by Poly(P)—One possible mechanism of growth stimulation by poly(P) is that poly(P) enhances the activity of growth factors that were released into the culture medium from the cultured cells themselves. Therefore, in this study, we focused on the possibility of modulation of FGF activity by poly(P). Since FGFs have been implicated as autocrine growth factors (11Souttou B. Hamelin R. Crepin M. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 615-623PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that poly(P) somehow modulates the biological activity of FGFs. If poly(P) does in fact modulate the mitogenic activity of FGF, cell proliferation would be enhanced by co-treatment with poly(P) and FGF rather than by single treatment with poly(P) or FGF. To examine whether the co-treatment of poly(P) and FGF is effective in stimulating mitogenic activity of FGFs, Balb/c 3T3, NHDF, and HGF whose growth could be dependent on FGF were treated with FGF-1 or FGF-2 in combination with poly(P) (12Naski M.C. Ornitz D.M. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D781-D794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, cell growth was slightly stimulated by both FGF-1 and FGF-2, and moreover, the levels of growth stimulation by both FGFs became greater in the presence of poly(P). Cell growth in the medium containing FGF-1 and poly(P) was 1.6–1.9 times higher than that in the medium containing only FGF-1. Similarly, cell growth in the medium containing FGF-2 and poly(P) was 1.3–1.7 times higher than that in the medium containing only FGF-2. Because the levels of growth stimulation by co-treatment of poly(P) and FGFs are greater than the sum of stimulation levels of single treatment with poly(P) and FGFs in Balb/c 3T3 and NHDF, poly(P) seems to augment the mitogenic activities of FGFs. However, in HGF, the level of growth stimulation by co-treatment with FGF-2 and poly(P) is not greater than the sum of stimulation levels of single treatment with poly(P) and FGFs. From these results, it is difficult to rule out the possibility that poly(P) and FGFs independently function on cell growth stimulation. To show the direct evidence of FGF modulation by poly(P), the physical and functional interactions between poly(P) and FGFs have been examined. Physical Interaction Between FGF-2 and Poly(P)—Physical interaction between FGF-2 and poly(P) was examined by a gel shift assay as described in the legend of Fig. 3. When FGF-2 was incubated with short chain [32P]poly(P), FGF-2 bound to the poly(P) depending on its concentration, poly(P) formed a complex with FGF-2, and the complex almost remained at the origin of the gel (Fig. 3). This result shows that poly(P) does bind to FGF-2. Furthermore, it may possible to roughly estimate the stoichiometry between poly(P) and FGF-2. Since 8.93 pmol of FGF-2 completely trapped all of [32P]poly(P) (16.3 pmol, estimated in terms of phosphate residue, corresponds to 0.251 pmol of poly(P) calculated from the number of average chain length of [32P]poly(P) as 65) (Fig. 3, lane 3), one molecule of poly(P) can bind to <35.6 molecules of FGF-2. It still would be difficult to speculate the structures of poly(P)-FGF-2 complex only from this result because some FGF-2 molecules may not contribute to the formation of the complex under our experimental condition. However, it may also be possible that poly(P) somehow facilitates oligomer formation of FGF-2 as in the case of heparin-like glycosaminoglycans (13Venkataraman G. Sheiver Z. Davis J.C. Sasisekharan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1892-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and a FGF-2 oligomer requires only a few phosphate molecules of poly(P) for its binding. The modulation of mitogenic activity of FGF-2 may result from the oligomer formation of FGF-2 initiated by poly(P). Stabilization of FGF-2 by Poly(P)—To further examine the effect of poly(P) on FGF-2, the stability of FGF-2 with or without poly(P) was evaluated. Fig. 4A shows the degradation of FGF-2 in culture medium in the presence or absence of poly(P). Intact FGF-2 clearly remained after 24 h of incubation with poly(P) (Fig. 4A, lane 17), whereas intact FGF-2 was not observed after 24 h of incubation without poly(P) (Fig. 4A, lane 9) or with NaPO4 buffer (Fig. 4A, lane 25). The half-life of FGF-2, which was calculated from the intensity of the bands of Fig. 4A, was 13.7 h when FGF-2 was incubated with poly(P), whereas it was only 4.7 h when FGF-2 was incubated with NaPO4 buffer (Fig. 4B). Since FGF-2 was physically stabilized by poly(P), stability of the biological activity of FGF-2 was also examined using Balb/c 3T3 cells. Since FGF-2 almost loses its mitogenic activity within 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, the residual activity after preincubation (24 h at 37 °C) of FGF-2 was examined in the presence and absence of poly(P). As shown in Fig. 4C, cells cultured in a medium containing FGF-2 that has been preincubated with poly(P) (medium 2) maintained the same population levels as that of cells cultured in a medium containing FGF-2 without preincubation (medium 3). On the other hand, a medium containing FGF-2 that had been preincubated without poly(P) (medium 4) showed slight proliferation activity but the activity decreased to the same level as that of media without FGF-2 (media 5 and 6) after 83 h of incubation. This means that FGF-2 that had been preincubated at 37 °C was stabilized by poly(P) and maintained its proliferation activity at the same level as that of FGF-2 that had not been preincubated. In addition, the highest proliferation activity was observed in the medium containing FGF-2 and poly(P) without preincubation. This finding is consistent with the result shown in Fig. 2, indicating the enhancement of mitogenic activity of FGF-2 by poly(P). These results indicate that poly(P) stabilizes the biological activity of FGF-2. Facilitation of FGF-2 Binding to Its Receptors by Poly(P)—To further examine the effect of poly(P) as an FGF-2 modulator, we analyzed whether poly(P) not only stabilizes FGF-2 but facilitates FGF-2 binding to FGF receptors. The biological activity of FGF-2 is mediated by interaction with high affinity cell surface receptors (14Johnson D.E. William L.T. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar, 15Givol D. Yayon A. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3362-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 16Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Dionne C.A. Biochim. Biothys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). In addition to binding to receptors, FGF-2 binds to HSPG on the cell surface. Because many studies have indicated that the binding to HSPG facilitates FGF-2 receptor binding and activation (17Kiefer M.C. Baird A. Nguyen T. George-Nascimento C. Mason O.B. Boley L.J.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10229-10248Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), we removed the cell surface HSPG by sodium chlorate treatment in order to observe the direct effect of poly(P) on FGF-2 and its receptor binding (10Fannon M. Nugent M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17949-17956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Sodium chlorate-treated cells were incubated with FGF-2, and the receptor-bound FGF-2 was collected and analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 5A) and intensities of the bands were quantified and plotted in Fig. 5B. The amount of FGF-2 that bound to FGF receptors in the presence of poly(P) was more than twice that in the absence of poly(P). This clearly indicates that poly(P) facilitates the binding between FGF-2 and FGF receptors. Poly(P), FGF-2, and FGF receptors may form a trimolecular complex on the cell surface. There may also be direct interactions between poly(P) and FGF receptor that facilitate FGF-2 binding and receptor dimerization as in the case of heparin (17Kiefer M.C. Baird A. Nguyen T.

To rule out the possibility that stabilization of FGF-2 by poly(P) occur during incubation with binding buffer or elution buffer, stability of FGF-2 during binding assay was evaluated. FGF-2 was incubated with poly(P) or NaPO4 buffer in the binding buffer or in the elution buffer at 4 °C. The amount of FGF-2 remaining in the buffer was shown in Fig. 5C. Since almost the same amount of FGF-2 was detected in buffers with poly(P) or NaPO4 up to 5.5-h exposures of the binding buffer (Fig. 5C, lanes 1–4) and up to 30-min exposures of the elution buffer (Fig. 5C, lanes 5 and 6), there is no stabilization effect of poly(P) on FGF-2 during this binding assay. With regard to the mechanism of growth stimulation by poly(P), a similar effect has also been reported by adding heparin to culture media. Heparin and heparin-like glycosaminoglycans are well known potent modulators of FGF-1 and FGF-2, and they potentiate the mitogenic activity of both FGFs (12Naski M.C. Ornitz D.M. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D781-D794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kiefer M.C. Baird A. Nguyen T. George-Nascimento C. Mason O.B. Boley L.J. Valenzuela P. Barr P.J.

Heparin sulfate stabilizes FGFs and binds to a site on the receptor and at least one site on the growth factor. Several models propose an important role for heparin sulfate not only in facilitating FGF-2 binding to its receptor tyrosine kinase but also in promoting signaling via the formation of receptor dimers. Such dimers are capable of trans-phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor, leading to the generation of phosphotyrosine, that is an important initiator of the intracellular signaling pathway (17Kiefer M.C.

Poly(P) may also facilitate FGF-2 binding to its receptors and promote signaling through the same binding sites of heparin sulfate, FGF-2, and its receptors. However, poly(P) and heparin have completely different chemical structures, besides both molecules are negatively charged cellular polymers. It is probable that the mechanism for modulation of FGF activity by poly(P) is different from that of heparin. Based on our results, the level of growth stimulation by poly(P) is higher than that by heparin whose concentration is enough for maximum growth stimulation (Fig. 2) (21Gospodarowicz D. Cheng J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1986; 128: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). This also suggests that the binding sites between poly(P) and FGFs could be different. Further analyses are needed to elucidate the detailed mechanism of interaction between poly(P) and FGF-2. One hypothesis is that poly(P) has biological functions for controlling the activity of FGF in vivo. Since poly(P) is widely distributed in mammalian tissues (5Schröder H.C. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 1999; 23: 45-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), it is possible that degradation of FGF in tissues that have been injured is prevented if there was a mechanism for local regulation of poly(P) concentration. Furthermore, it is also possible that poly(P) interacts with other proteins or polypeptides, including growth factors, cytokines, hormones, and other physiologically active factors. Recently, Kuroda et al. (22Kuroda A. Nomura K. Ohtomo R. Kato J. Ikeda T. Takiguchi N. Ohtake H. Kornberg A. Science. 2001; 293: 705-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) showed that poly(P) modulate the activity of Lon protease in E. coli depending on its nutrient condition. This also supports the possibility that poly(P) is a protein modulator in a wide variety of organisms to regulate the functions of proteins after translation. Although there have been few reports describing the functions of poly(P) in eucaryotes, we believe that our present findings provide a key to elucidate the importance of poly(P) in higher organisms."

Recombinant antibodies specific to the guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound conformation of the small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Rab6, a regulator of membrane traffic, were generated and used to locate Rab6.GTP in fixed cells, and, after green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagging and intracellular expression, to follow Rab6.GTP in vivo. Rab6 was in its GTP-bound conformation on the Golgi apparatus and transport intermediates, and the geometry of transport intermediates was modulated by Rab6 activity. More generally, the same approach could be applied to other molecules that can be locked in a particular conformation in vitro."

To test this hypothesis, we disrupted the correlated activity of neighboring ganglion cells in the developing ferret retina through immunotoxin depletion of starburst amacrine cells. Despite the absence of this type of correlated activity, left and right eye inputs segregated normally in the DLGN. By contrast, when all spontaneous activity was blocked, the projections from the two eyes remained intermingled. Thus, certain features of normal neural activity patterns are not required for the formation of eye-specific projections to the DLGN."
https://openalex.org/W2024095574,"In higher eukaryotes, the S phase and M phase of the cell cycle are triggered by different cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). For example, in frog egg extracts, Cdk1–cyclin B catalyzes entry into mitosis but cannot trigger DNA replication. Two hypotheses can explain this observation: Either Cdk1–cyclin B fails to recognize the key substrates of its S-phase–promoting counterparts, or its activity is somehow regulated to prevent it from activating DNA synthesis. Here, we show that Cdk1–cyclin B1 has cryptic S-phase–promoting abilities that can be unmasked by relocating it from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and moderately stimulating its activity. Subcellular localization of vertebrate CDKs and the control of their activity are thus critical factors for determining their specificity."

Schulman B.A. Nature. 2003; 422: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In the activation of ubiquitin, Uba1 forms a ternary complex composed of 1 eq each of a tightly bound ubiquitin adenylate and a covalent Uba1-ubiquitin thiol ester to a conserved active site, Cys632 (28Haas A.L. Warms J.V. Hershko A. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2543-2548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Haas A.L. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10329-10337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), HsUba1a numbering. Early ATP:PPi exchange studies demonstrated that rabbit Uba1 catalyzes an absolutely ordered mechanism in which ATP binding precedes that of ubiquitin prior to the first catalytic step of ubiquitin adenylate formation (29Haas A.L. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10329-10337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activated ubiquitin moiety is subsequently transferred to the thiol ester site comprising Cys632 prior to formation of a second ubiquitin adenylate, to generate the final ternary complex (28Haas A.L. Warms J.V. Hershko A. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2543-2548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Haas A.L. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10329-10337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Marked conservation among the activating enzymes for ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins argues that they proceed by similar mechanisms. However, the apparently substoichiometric formation of the predicted Nedd8 adenylate intermediate catalyzed by the reconstituted plant ortholog of AppBp1-Uba3 suggests that the catalytic cycle for Nedd8 activation may exhibit some differences from that of ubiquitin (30del Pozo J.C. Estelle M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15342-15347Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The latter observation is significant because the presence of enzyme-bound ubiquitin adenylate is required for ubiquitin transthiolation from the E1 ternary complex to E2 carrier proteins, even though this intermediate is not the immediate donor of activated polypeptide (31Pickart C.M. Kasperek E.M. Beal R. Kim A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7115-7123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To date, the enzymes involved in the activation of ubiquitin-like proteins have not been mechanistically characterized in sufficient detail to resolve these and related questions. In the present studies, we have found that human erythrocytes represent an excellent source of active AppBp1-Uba3 heterodimer and have utilized covalent affinity purified AppBp1-Uba3 and recombinant human Ubc12 in the first mechanistic studies of Nedd8 activation. The results demonstrate marked conservation between the mechanisms for Nedd8 and ubiquitin activation and identify a critical specificity determinant for polypeptide recognition by their respective activating enzymes. Bovine ubiquitin was purchased from Sigma and purified to homogeneity as described previously (32Baboshina O.V. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2823-2831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Homogeneous wild-type ubiquitin, the recombinant ubiquitin mutant UbR72L (33Burch T.J. Haas A.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7300-7308Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and recombinant human Nedd8 were radiolabeled by the chloramine-T method using carrier-free Na125I obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (34Haas A.L. Rose I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6845-6848Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The [2,8-3H]ATP and Na4[32PPi] used in Nedd8 [3H]adenylate quantitation and ATP:32PPi exchange kinetics, respectively, were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Human Recombinant Nedd8 —Nedd8 was cloned from a HeLa cell cDNA library by PCR amplification using 5′ and 3′ primers flanking the coding sequence that contained NdeI or EcoRI restriction sites, respectively. The PCR product was ligated directly into pGEM-T (Promega) for amplification and purification. The resulting pGEM-Nedd8 construct was digested with NdeI/EcoRI and ligated into similarly restricted pPLhUb to yield pPLNedd8 (33Burch T.J. Haas A.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7300-7308Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The Nedd8 coding sequence was verified by sequencing the entire coding region by automated sequencing in The Protein and Nucleic Acid Core Facility at the Medical College of Wisconsin. The pPLNedd8 plasmid was transformed into AR58 Escherichia coli cells constitutively expressing a temperature-sensitive [lamda] repressor protein (35Ecker D.J. Khan M.I. Marsh J. Butt T.R. Crooke S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3524-3527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein expression was induced by rapidly increasing the cultures to the non-permissive temperature of 42 °C (32Baboshina O.V. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2823-2831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 33Burch T.J. Haas A.L.

Chem. 1987; 262: 3524-3527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 2 h of induction at 42 °C, cells from 2 liters of LB culture containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin were collected by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 15 min then lysed by passage through a French press. All subsequent steps were conducted at 4 °C. The lysate was centrifuged for 30 min at 30,000 × g. Recombinant Nedd8 protein occurred nearly quantitatively within bacterial inclusion bodies present in the 30,000 × g pellet but could be extracted and refolded using a modification of a protocol previously described for the isolation of unstable recombinant ubiquitin mutants (33Burch T.J. Haas A.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7300-7308Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The pellet containing the Nedd8-associated inclusion bodies was collected and resuspended to the original lysate volume in 50 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5) then centrifuged again. The resulting pellet was solubilized in 30 ml of Tris acetate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 6 m urea. The mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature for 30 min, then the urea was slowly removed by dialysis (3.5-kDa exclusion limit dialysis tubing) overnight against 2 × 4 liters of 50 mm Tris acetate buffer (pH 7.5). Insoluble protein was removed by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was batch adsorbed onto a 250-ml bed volume of DEAE cellulose (Whatman) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5). The unadsorbed fraction from the DEAE cellulose was collected and titrated to pH 4.5 with acetic acid before being applied to a 2.5 × 10-cm column of CM52 cellulose (Whatman) equilibrated with 25 mm ammonium acetate (pH 4.5) (36Haas A.L. Wilkinson K.D. Prep. Biochem. 1985; 15: 49-60PubMed Google Scholar). Bound protein was eluted stepwise with 50 mm ammonium acetate (pH 5.5). Fractions containing Nedd8 protein were pooled and dialyzed against distilled water. The pH of the dialyzed solution was adjusted to 4.5 with acetic acid before being applied to a Pharmacia Mono S 5/5 column equilibrated with 25 mm acetic acid titrated to pH 4.5 with ammonium acetate (36Haas A.L. Wilkinson K.D. Prep. Biochem. 1985; 15: 49-60PubMed Google Scholar). The bound protein was eluted with a linear 0–0.5 m NaCl gradient (10 mm/min) at 1 ml/min flow rate. This procedure generally yielded 2–5 mg of protein per liter of E. coli culture. The protein was greater than 99% homogeneous as assessed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining following resolution by 14% (w/v) polyacrylamide SDS-PAGE. Absolute protein concentration was determine spectrophotometrically using the empirical 280 nm ubiquitin extinction coefficient of 0.16 (mg/ml)–1 (36Haas A.L. Wilkinson K.D. Prep. Biochem. 1985; 15: 49-60PubMed Google Scholar). 2The identical aromatic amino acid content for ubiquitin and human Nedd8 allowed us to use the empirical extinction coefficient of the former polypeptide in this spectrophotometric assay. Cloning and Expression of Human AppBp1 and Uba3—The full-length coding sequence of Uba3 was cloned by PCR from human fetal brain expressed sequence tagged I.M.A.G.E. Consortium Clone 45573 (American Type Culture Collection). Flanking primers containing complimentary 5′ and 3′ coding sequences and either SalI or EcoRI restriction sites, respectively, were used to amplify the cDNA. The resulting PCR product was ligated into pGEM-T (Promega) to yield pGEMT-Uba3 for subsequent amplification, purification, and sequencing. The complete Uba3 coding sequence was then subcloned into pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) using SalI and EcoRI restriction sites to yield pGEX-Uba3. AppBp1 was cloned by PCR from a HeLa cDNA library using flanking primers that contained complimentary 5′ and 3′ coding sequences and either NdeI or EcoRI restriction sites, respectively. The PCR product was ligated directly into pGEM-T. The resulting pGEMT-AppBp1 clone was digested with NdeI and EcoRI, then subcloned into complimentary digested pGEX4T-1 to yield pGEX-AppBp1. The AppBp1 sequence was verified by sequencing the entire insert. The glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins GST-Uba3 and GST-AppBp1 were expressed in E. coli BL21 cultures and purified from refolded inclusion bodies by glutathione affinity chromatography. Briefly, bacteria were grown to an A 600 of 0.6 at 30 °C and induced by the addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 2 h of induction, the cells were collect by centrifugation and lysed by passage through a French press. The lysate was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting pellets were washed with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT, then resuspended to the original lysate volume in the same buffer containing 6 m urea. After being allowed to stand on ice for 30 min, the urea was removed by dialysis (3.5-kDa exclusion limit dialysis tubing) against 2× 4 liters of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm DTT. Insoluble protein was removed by centrifugation prior to applying the dialysate to a 5-ml glutathione-agarose column. Unbound protein was removed by washing the column with 5 bed volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Bound protein was eluted with 5 bed volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 20 mm glutathione, then concentrated with a Millipore Ultrafree BioMax-5K centrifugal filter. The resulting fusion protein was cleaved by digestion with 10 units of thrombin (Amersham Biosciences) per milligram of recombinant protein according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Processed AppBp1 or Uba3 were resolved from GST and thrombin by fast protein liquid chromatography using a Pharmacia Mono Q 5/5 column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm DTT. Both AppBp1 and Uba3 eluted between 0.31 and 0.35 m within a linear 0–0.5 m NaCl gradient (12.5 mm/min) at 1 ml/min flow rate. Recombinant AppBp1 and Uba3 proteins were greater than 80% pure, as assessed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of samples resolved by 10% (w/v) SDS-PAGE, and were used without further purification. Protein concentrations for AppBp1 and Uba3 were estimated densitometrically by comparing Coomassie-stained bands to bovine serum albumin standards. Cloning and Expression of HsUbc12—Human Ubc12 was cloned by PCR from a HeLa cell cDNA library using 5′ and 3′ primers immediately flanking the HsUbc12 coding sequences that contained SalI and EcoRI restriction sites, respectively. The PCR product was subsequently ligated into pGEM-T (Promega) for amplification and sequencing. The resulting construct was digested with SalI and EcoRI, then the HsUbc12 coding sequence was isolated and ligated into similarly restricted pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) to yield pGEX-Ubc12. The HsUbc12 coding sequence was verified by sequencing the entire insert. The GST-HsUbc12 fusion protein was expressed in E. coli BL21 cells and purified by glutathione affinity chromatography. Bacterial cells transformed with pGEX-Ubc12 were grown at 37 °C to an A 600 of 0.6, then protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. After 2 h of induction, cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT, then lysed by passage through a French press. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min and the resulting supernatant was applied to a glutathione-agarose column. Unbound protein was removed by washing the column with 5 bed volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT. Bound protein was eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 20 mm glutathione, then concentrated using a Millipore Ultrafree BioMax-5K centrifugal filter. Following processing of the fusion protein with thrombin (Amersham Biosciences) at 10 units per mg of fusion protein, free HsUbc12 was further purified by fast protein liquid chromatography using a Pharmacia Mono Q 5/5 column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) containing 1 mm DTT. The HsUbc12 protein was eluted at 0.26 m within a linear 0–0.5 m NaCl gradient (12.5 mm/min) at 1 ml/min. The protein was greater than 95% pure as assessed by Coomassie Blue Brilliant staining. The concentration of active protein was determined by an end point thiol ester assay using 125I-Nedd8 (about 10,000 cpm/pmol) and affinity purified AppBp1-Uba3 heterodimer (37Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13258-13267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified protein was flash frozen and stored at –80 °C for several months without loss of activity. Affinity Purification of Human AppBp1-Uba3 Heterodimer from Human Erythrocytes—The AppBp1-Uba3 complex was isolated from human red blood cell Fraction II using Nedd8 affinity chromatography by adapting earlier methods for the isolation of Uba1 (28Haas A.L.

Chem. 1988; 263: 13258-13267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant Nedd8 was coupled to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) at ∼0.5 mg of Nedd8/ml of resin for a final concentration of 60 μm Nedd8 (37Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13258-13267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Five units of outdated whole blood was obtained from the Blood Center of Southeastern Wisconsin and used to prepare Fraction II as described previously (37Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13258-13267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Erythrocyte Fraction II was supplemented with a final concentration of 2 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm creatine phosphate, and 1 IU/ml creatine phosphokinase, then applied to the Nedd8 affinity column (10 ml bed volume) previously equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm ATP, and 2 mm MgCl2. The column was washed successively with 2 bed volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 3 bed volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.25 m KCl, and 2 bed volumes of 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5). Bound protein was eluted with 2 bed volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 2 mm AMP and 2 mm PPi followed by 2 bed volumes of 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) containing 10 mm DTT. The latter eluate was adjusted to pH 7.5 immediately following elution. The proteins from the two elutions were separately concentrated using a Millipore Ultrafree BioMax-5K centrifugal filter then dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm DTT and used without further purification. The concentration of active AppBp1-Uba3 heterodimer was determined by measuring the stoichiometric formation of Uba3-125I-Nedd8 thiol ester (below). Stoichiometric Assays for Active AppBp1-Uba3 Heterodimer—The stoichiometric formation of covalent Nedd8 [3H]adenylate was measured directly using [2,8-3H]ATP as described previously for ubiquitin-activating enzyme (28Haas A.L. Warms J.V. Hershko A. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2543-2548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Haas A.L. Rose I.A. J. Biol.

Fifty-μl assays containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 μm Nedd8, 2 mg/ml carrier bovine serum albumin, 0.5 IU inorganic pyrophosphatase, 0.5 μm [2,8-3H]ATP (35,200 cpm/pmol), and about 1 pmol of AppBp1-Uba3 heterodimer were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. The reactions were quenched by the addition of 400 μl of 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid containing 4 mm ATP and allowed to stand on ice for 10 min. Precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min, then the resulting pellets were washed with 1 ml of 2% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The pellets were then resuspended in 0.1 ml of 0.2 m triethanolamine-HCl (pH 8.0). The amount of Nedd8 [3H]adenylate formed was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The stoichiometric formation of Uba3-125I-Nedd8 thiol ester was determined as previously described for Uba1 using radioiodinated protein (28Haas A.L. Warms J.V. Hershko A. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2543-2548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Haas A.L. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10329-10337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 25-μl reactions containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT, 5 μm125I-Nedd8 (about 10,000 cpm/pmol), 0.5 IU inorganic pyrophosphatase, and the indicated amounts of AppBp1-Uba3 were incubated at 37 °C for 3 min. The reactions were quenched by the addition of an equal volume of 4% SDS-sample buffer and the proteins were resolved by non-reducing SDS-PAGE on 12% (w/v) acrylamide gels. The gels were dried and the thiol esters were visualized by autoradiography, then excised and quantified by γ counting (28Haas A.L. Warms J.V. Hershko A. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2543-2548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Haas A.L. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10329-10337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATP:PP i Isotope Exchange Kinetic Assays—Initial rates of ATP:32PPi isotope exchange were measured as previously described for the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (29Haas A.L. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10329-10337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fifty-μl reactions contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm Na32PPi (25–50 cpm/pmol), 10 nm human erythrocyte AppBp1-Uba3 heterodimer, and the indicated concentrations of ATP, Nedd8, and 32PPi. After starting the reactions by addition of Nedd8, the assays were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min, then quenched by the addition of 0.5 ml of 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid containing 4 mm NaPPi followed by 300 μl of a 10% (w/v) charcoal slurry in 2% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The assays were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min, then the supernatant was removed by aspiration. The charcoal pellet was washed three times with 1 ml of 2% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid prior to quantitation of 32P radioactivity incorporated into ATP by Cerenkov radiation (29Haas A.L. Rose I.A. J.

Interestingly, stimulation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) can either enhance or depress synaptic transmission at CA1 hippocampal synapses. Here we report that co-activation of mGluR5, a member of the group I mGluR family, and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) potentiates NMDAR currents and induces a long lasting enhancement of excitatory synaptic transmission in primary cultured hippocampal neurons. Unexpectedly, activation of mGluR5 alone fails to enhance evoked NMDAR currents and synaptic α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate receptor (AMPAR) AMPAR currents. The observed potentiation requires an mGluR5-induced, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor-mediated mobilization of intracellular Ca2+, which acts in concert with a protein kinase C, calcium-activated tyrosine kinase cascade to induce a long lasting enhancement of NMDAR and AMPAR currents.

Neurobiol. Dis. 2000; 7: 515-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), synaptic plasticity (2Collingridge G.L. Bliss T.V. Trends.

Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 81-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). In the pyramidal cell synapses of the CA1 region of the hippocampus, the NMDAR is composed of at least one NR1 subunit as well as multiple NR2B or NR2A subunits (4Monyer H. Burnashev N. Laurie D.J. Sakmann B. Seeburg P.H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 529-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2840) Google Scholar). These postsynaptic NMDARs are associated with a complex of proteins (the “NMDAR complex”), which includes the scaffolding proteins PSD-95, Homer, Shank, and GKAP as well as a number of serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases and phosphatases (5Husi H. Ward M.A. Choudhary J.S. Blackstock W.P. Grant S.G. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). Furthermore, other receptors, including mGluR and IP3R are potentially linked to this complex (6Sheng M. Pak D.T. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 755-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The presence and activity of many of these proteins is integral for LTP and LTD, which are the leading cellular and molecular models for learning and memory (7Bliss T.V. Collingridge G.L. Nature. 1993; 361: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (9456) Google Scholar).Glutamate also activates postsynaptic mGluRs, which are coupled via G-protein activation to intracellular signaling cascades. Eight mGluRs have been cloned, and they are classified into three groups (I, II, and III) based upon sequence homology, similarities in signal transduction cascades, and pharmacological profiles (8Conn P.J. Pin J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 205-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (2705) Google Scholar). The group I metabotropic glutamate receptor, mGluR5, is positively coupled to phospholipase Cβ activity (9Hannan A.J. Blakemore C. Katsnelson A. Vitalis T. Huber K.M. Bear M. Roder J. Kim D.

Conquet F. Corti C. Grandes P. Kuhn R. Knopfel T. J. Comp Neurol. 1998; 400: 391-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Recent evidence demonstrates that mGluR1 and mGluR5 play separate functional roles, via activation of distinct intracellular signaling pathways in CA1 pyramidal neurons (13Marino M.J. Wittmann M. Bradley S.R. Hubert G.W. Smith Y. Conn P.J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7001-7012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Group I mGluRs can either enhance or depress excitatory synapses (14Snyder E.M.

The mechanisms by which group I mGluRs act to modulate synaptic performance are not entirely clear, but post-translational modifications (15Soderling T.R. Derkach V.A. Trends.

The role of mGluRs in the induction of LTP is highly controversial, and the exact role of group I mGluRs in modulating NMDARs and LTP is unclear (29Anwyl R. Brain Res. Brain Res.

Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In the present study we set out to delineate the mechanism by which group I mGluRs modulate NMDA channel activityMATERIALS AND METHODSCell Isolation and Whole-cell and Perforated Patch Recordings—CA1 neurons were isolated from hippocampal slices from postnatal rats (Wistar 10–20 days) using previously described procedures (55Wang L.Y. MacDonald J.F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 486: 83-95Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To control for variation in response, recordings from control and treated cells were made on the same day, unless otherwise indicated. The extracellular solution consisted of (in mm): 140 NaCl, 1.3 CaCl2, 5 KCl, 25 HEPES, 33 glucose, and 0.0005 tetrodotoxin, with pH 7.4 and osmolarity between 320 and 325 mosmol. Recordings were done at room temperature (20–22 °C). After formation of a whole-cell configuration, the recorded neurons were voltage-clamped at –60 mV and lifted into the stream of solution supplied by a computer-controlled, multibarreled perfusion system. Continuous perfusion was achieved by using a gravity-fed system. This system allows for a delay in the application of two different drugs from as little as <2 ms. To monitor access resistance, a voltage step of –10 mV was made before each application of NMDA. Recordings where series resistance varied by more than 10% were rejected. The intracellular solution contained (in mm): 140 CsF or CsCl2, 11 EGTA, 1 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 2 tetraethylammonium, and 2 K2ATP with pH 7.2 and osmolarity between 295 and 300 mosmol. Several recordings were also performed from HEK 293 cells expressing recombinant NMDARs under identical recording conditions. For these experiments, HEK cells were transiently transfected using a lipid transfer method (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with cDNAs encoding for the NMDA receptor subunits NR2a and a C-terminal truncated form of the NR1 subunit (NR1Stop838) previously demonstrated to abolish Ca2+-dependent inactivation of NMDARs (56Krupp J.J. Vissel B. Thomas C.G. Heinemann S.F. Westbrook G.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1165-1178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In perforated patch recordings, the antibiotic amphotericin B (0.5 μg/ml) was included in the patch electrode. Once the cell-attached configuration was established, the negative pressure was relieved and ∼10 min elapsed before electrical access to the cell was achieved. Some drugs were included in the patch pipette. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. and were analyzed using a two-way analysis of variance.Recordings of Miniature Postsynaptic Excitatory Currents—Procedures for the preparation of primary dissociated cultures of hippocampal neurons have been previously described (57MacDonald J.F. Mody I. Salter M.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1989; 414: 17-34Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Whole-cell recordings were made from these cultures 12–17 days after plating. Recordings were performed at room temperature (20–22 °C). Recordings from each neuron lasted from at least 45 to 75 min. The series resistance in these recordings varied between 6 and 8 megohms, and recordings where series resistance varied by more than 10% were rejected. No electronic compensation for series resistance was employed. The patch electrode solution contained the following (mm): 140 CsCl, 2.5 EGTA, or 20 BAPTA, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 2 tetraethylammonium, and 4 K2ATP (pH 7.3), and osmolarity was between 300 and 310 mosmol. The extracellular (perfusion or bathing) solution was of the following composition (mm): 140 NaCl, 1.3 CaCl2, 5 KCl, 25 HEPES, 33 glucose, 0.0005 tetrodotoxin, 0.001 strychnine, and 0.02 bicuculline methiodide (pH 7.4), and osmolarity was between 325 and 335 mosmol. Each cell was continuously superfused (1 ml/min) with this solution from a single barrel of a computer-controlled multibarreled perfusion system. mEPSCs were recorded using an Axopatch 1-B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc.), and records were filtered at 2 kHz, stored on tape, and subsequently acquired offline with an event detection program (Mini Analysis; Justin Lee). Cells that demonstrated a change in “leak” current of more than 10% (usually less than 10 pA) were rejected from the analysis. The trigger level for detection of events was set approximately three times higher than the baseline noise. Inspection of the raw data was used to eliminate any false events, and ∼300 mEPSCs were averaged for display purposes. The same number of events was used when averaged mEPSCs were compared. The AMPAR component of mEPSC was determined by selecting the area under the event from the start of the event to 8 ms after the start of the event. The NMDAR component was determined by selecting the area under the event from 8 ms onward. All population data were expressed as mean ± S.E. The Student's paired t test or the analysis of variance test (two-way) was employed when appropriate to examine the statistical significance of the differences between groups of data.In Vitro Phosphorylation Assays—CA1 tissue was treated with CHPG (20 min CHPG plus 5 min of extracellular fluid without CHPG), CHPG plus MPEP (25 min MPEP, 20 min CHPG plus MPEP), or no treatment (25 min in extracellular fluid). Three CA1 regions were pooled together. The tissue was homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer containing (in mm): 50 Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 NaCl, 2 EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 sodium orthovanadate, protease inhibitors pepstatin A (20 μg/ml), leupeptin (20 μg/ml), and aprotinin (20 μg/ml), and 1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The protein content of soluble material was determined by BCA protein assay. Soluble proteins (500 μg) were incubated overnight with 2 μl of either anti-CAKβ or anti-Src. Immune complexes were isolated by addition of 40 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads, followed by incubation for 1–2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed several times with SDS lysis buffer. Samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. Membranes were immunoblotted with a monoclonal antibody to phosphorylated tyrosine (1:1000 dilution). Signals were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) and developed on x-ray film. The membrane was then stripped and reprobed with anti-CAKβ or anti-Src (1:3000 and 1:5000 dilution, respectively). The film images were digitized and imported into Corel Draw for presentation purposes.RESULTSWe first assessed the role of mGluR5 in the regulation of excitatory synaptic transmission in primary hippocampal cultures. Applications of CHPG (100 μm), a selective mGluR5 agonist, but relatively insensitive for mGluR1 (31Doherty A.J. Palmer M.J. Henley J.M. Collingridge G.L. Jane D.E. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 265-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), enhanced miniature excitatory postsynaptic current mediated by NMDARs (mEPSCNMDA) but not the AMPA receptor component (mEPSCAMPA). The concentration of CHPG employed was chosen to match that used recently to study mGluR5-mediated responses in cultured retinal amacrine neurons (32Sosa R. Hoffpauir B. Rankin M.L. Bruch R.C. Gleason E.L. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 973-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The CHPG-induced enhancement of mEPSCNMDA was attenuated by co-application of the selective mGluR5 antagonist MPEP. The concentration of MPEP was just maximal (10 μm, Fig. 1a) for antagonism of mGluR5 with little or no effect on mGluR1 (33Gasparini F. Lingenhohl K. Stoehr N. Flor P.J. Heinrich M. Vranesic I. Biollaz M. Allgeier H. Heckendorn R. Urwyler S. Varney M.A. Johnson E.C. Hess S.D. Rao S.P. Sacaan A.I. Santori E.M. Velicelebi G. Kuhn R. Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 1493-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). In these recordings, and as previously described, intracellular Ca2+ was sufficiently buffered to prevent the secondary potentiation of mEPSCAMPA without preventing the Ca2+-dependent modulation of NMDARs (34Lu Y.M. Roder J.C. Davidow J. Salter M.W. Science. 1998; 279: 1363-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 35Huang Y.Q. Lu W.Y. Ali D.W. Pelkey K.A. Pitcher G.M. Lu Y.M. Aoto H. Roder J.C. Sasaki T. Salter M.W. MacDonald J.F. Neuron. 2001; 29: 485-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar).In acutely isolated CA1 pyramidal neurons, taken from young rat hippocampi, peak NMDAR-mediated whole-cell currents (Ip) recorded in response to rapid applications of NMDA (Fig. 1b) were similarly enhanced by CHPG. This enhancement was similar whether 100 or 500 μm CHPG was applied. This enhancement of peak currents was also antagonized by MPEP (Fig. 1, c 1 and c 2). We further demonstrated the absence of a CHPG-induced modulation of NMDAR-mediated currents in CA1 neurons taken from mGluR5 knockout mice even though cells from wild type littermates demonstrated the anticipated enhancement (Fig. 1, e 1 and e 2). The low yield of mGluR5 knockout mice prevented our evaluation of changes in excitatory synaptic transmission using primary hippocampal cultures that lacked mGluR5 expression.Note that during the period of simultaneous co-applications of CHPG, a rapid but reversible depression of NMDA-evoked currents was observed (e.g. Fig. 1, c 2, e 2, and f). This transient depression was not blocked by MPEP, and it was also seen in cells taken from mGluR5 knockout mice providing evidence that it is due to a direct interaction with NMDARs rather than through mGluR5 signaling. Such a direct effect of mGluR reagents has been previously reported (36Movsesyan V.A. O'Leary D.M. Fan L. Bao W. Mullins P.G. Knoblach S.M. Faden A.I. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 296: 41-47PubMed Google Scholar, 37O'Leary D.M. Movsesyan V. Vicini S. Faden A.I. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 131: 1429-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 38Contractor A. Gereau R.W. Green T. Heinemann S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8969-8974Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and reflects in part an interaction of these agents with the glycine binding site of the NMDA receptor (38Contractor A. Gereau R.W. Green T. Heinemann S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8969-8974Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Indeed, at the concentrations of NMDA and glycine used by us, CHPG inhibited recombinant NR1Stop838/NR2a currents in HEK293 cells by 60.9 ± 2.0% at 100 μm and 98.5 ± 0.8% at 1 mm (n = 4, Fig. 1, d 1 and d 2). For this reason the CPHG was not included in the NMDA barrel during perfusion of isolated cells. Thus, the limited depression of NMDA-induced currents simply reflected the rapid recovery of NMDA responses following the washout of CHPG. One should note that the CHPG-induced potentiation occurs long after (as much as 30 min) the application of CHPG, whereas the inhibition recovers in less than 1 s. NMDAR-mediated currents reversed at ∼0 mV before and after application of all agents demonstrating that there was no change in driving force associated with their use (data not shown).To permit intracellular Ca2+ to vary in the absence of any applied exogenous Ca2+ buffers, we also made a series of recordings from isolated CA1 neurons using the perforated patch technique. Under these conditions, and with sub-saturating concentrations of agonists (10 μm NMDA and 500 nm glycine), peak currents (Ip) also demonstrated a time-dependent enhancement following application of 1S,3R-ACPD (10 μm; trans-ACPD) but not following application of its inactive analogue, 1R,3S-ACPD (10 μm) or the mGluR5-selective agonist CHPG (not shown). In contrast when near saturating concentrations of agonists (300 μm NMDA and 3 μm glycine) were employed, a long lasting depression of steady-state currents (Iss) was also revealed following application of CHPG (Fig. 1f). In all subsequent experiments 100 μm CHPG was used to activate mGluR5 responses in isolated CA1 neurons.These results demonstrate that activation of mGluR5 can selectively enhance mEPSCNMDA and enhance peak currents as well as depress steady-state NMDA-evoked currents accentuating the apparent desensitization of evoked currents. The mGluR5-induced enhancement of NMDAR desensitization (e.g. reduced Iss/Ip) was directly dependent upon the concentration of extracellular glycine (data not shown) and is consistent with enhanced calcium-dependent inactivation of NMDAR-mediated currents (39Lu W.Y. Jackson M.F. Bai D. Orser B.A. MacDonald J.F. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4452-4461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, these results do not exclude the possibility that other forms of receptor desensitization occur. For instance, it is possible that there might be a change in the number and/or function of NMDAR subtypes.Many GPCRs activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade through the transactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases, such as epidermal growth factor receptors and platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs) (40Luttrell L.M. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). GPCR-mediated transactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases has been well documented in heterologous cell systems, and recently we demonstrated that, in CA1 pyramidal neurons, D2/D4 dopamine receptors (GPCRs) transactivate PDGFRs to depress NMDA-mediated synaptic transmission (41Kotecha S.A. Oak J.N. Jackson M.F. Perez Y. Orser B.A. Van Tol H.H.M. MacDonald J.F. Neuron. 2002; 35: 1111-1122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Moreover, in glial cells mGluR5-induced activation of MAPK is dependent upon epidermal growth factor receptor activity (42Peavy R.D. Chang M.S. Sanders-Bush E. Conn P.J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9619-9628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, inclusion of the PDGFR inhibitor tyrphostin A9 (2 μm) in the recording electrode solution, failed to block the CHPG-induced potentiation of NMDAR-mediated peak currents in isolated CA1 pyramidal neurons. In addition, applications of either epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml) failed to modulate NMDA-evoked currents in isolated CA1 pyramidal neurons (data not shown). Therefore, mGluR5 is unlikely to modulate NMDA responses via transactivation of these growth factor receptors.The simultaneous enhancement of Ip and depression of Iss in pyramidal neurons is reminiscent of what is seen following activation of protein kinase C (PKC) (43Lu W.Y. Xiong Z.G. Lei S. Orser B.A. Dudek E. Browning M.D. MacDonald J.F. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The enhancement results from stimulation of the calcium-activated kinase β (CAKβ) or proline rich kinase 2/Src cascade (35Huang Y.Q. Lu W.Y. Ali D.W. Pelkey K.A. Pitcher G.M. Lu Y.M. Aoto H. Roder J.C. Sasaki T. Salter M.W. MacDonald J.F. Neuron. 2001; 29: 485-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), whereas the depression results from a PKC-dependent facilitation of calcium-dependent inactivation (39Lu W.Y. Jackson M.F. Bai D. Orser B.A. MacDonald J.F. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4452-4461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CHPG-induced potentiation was also mediated via activation of PKC, because the response was blocked by the selective inhibitor, chelerythrine (10 μm, Fig. 2a) (45Hemmings H.C.J. in Regulatory Protein Modification: Techniques and Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1997: 147-148Google Scholar). In separate experiments, application of 4β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (4β-PMA) (100 nm) potentiated Ip as anticipated but also occluded the mGluR5-induced potentiation (Fig. 2a) whereas an inactive phorbol ester, 4α-PMA (100 nm), did neither (α-PMA: 95 ± 5%, n = 8; αPMA plus CHPG: 133 ± 12%, n = 8, p < 0.001). The serine/threonine phosphatases, PP1 and PP2A, depress NMDA-evoked currents (46Wang L.Y. Orser B.A. Brautigan D.L. MacDonald J.F. Nature. 1994; 369: 230-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), and appropriate inhibitors enhance and facilitate the PKC-mediated potentiation of Ip (43Lu W.Y. Xiong Z.G. Lei S. Orser B.A. Dudek E. Browning M.D. MacDonald J.F. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the ability of a phosphatase inhibitor to modulate the mGluR5-induced potentiation. Application okadaic acid (10 nm) slightly enhanced Ip but substantially accentuated the potentiation induced by CHPG (okadaic acid: 112 ± 10%, n = 5; okadaic acid plus CHPG: 168 ± 12%, p < 0.001; CHPG: 142 ± 8%; data taken at 25 min after application of drug, data not illustrated).Fig. 2mGluR5-induced enhancement of NMDAR currents is dependent upon PKC, CAKβ, and Src. a, the PKC inhibitor chelerythrine (10 μm) was included in the recording electrode solution and was found to block the CHPG-induced enhancement, whereas the active phorbol ester (β-PMA, 100 nm) occluded the CHPG effect (β-PMA: 133 ± 6%, n = 7, data obtained at 15 min; β-PMA plus CHPG: 129 ± 9%, n = 7, data obtained at 35 min; chelerythrine plus CHPG: 94 ± 5%, n = 8, p < 0.001, data obtained at 35 min). b, the functional dominant negative CAKβ-K457A blocked the CHPG-induced enhancement. Inclusion of recombinant CAKβ in the recording electrode solution enhanced NMDAR currents and occluded the CHPG response (CAKβ: 146 ± 13%, n = 6, data obtained at 12 min; CAKβ plus CHPG: 155 ± 18%, n = 6, data obtained at 30 min; CAKβ-K457A plus CHPG: 94 ± 8%, n = 7, data obtained at 30 min). c, recordings from primary cultured hippocampal neurons indicate that CHPG enhanced mEPSCNMDA, and this effect was attenuated with CAKβ-K457A in the patch electrode solution (CHPG: 21.1 ± 5.4%, n = 8; CHPG plus CAKβ-K457A: 7.52 ± 4.1%, n = 7, p < 0.001, data obtained after 25 min). In contrast, mEPSCAMPA was not affected in response to CHPG (CHPG: 3.8 ± 1.9%, n = 8; CHPG plus CAKβ-K457A: 2.4 ± 1.5%, n = 7, data obtained after 25 min). Inset, current traces illustrate that CHPG enhances mEPSCNMDA, but not mEPSCAMPA, and this effect is abrogated in the presence of CAKβ-K457A. d, inclusion of Src in the intracellular solution occluded the CHPG response, whereas inactive Src failed to do so (active Src: 123 ± 4.2%, n = 6, data obtained at 10 min; active Src plus CHPG: 126 ± 3.6%, n = 6, data obtained at 35 min; inactive Src: 110 ± 6%, n = 7; inactive Src plus CHPG: 123 ± 6%, n = 7, p < 0.001). e, the selective Src kinase peptide inhibitor Src40–58 blocked the CHPG response, but the scrambled peptide (inactive Src40–58) did not (CHPG plus Src40–58: 104 ± 8%, n = 6; CHPG plus sSrc40–58: 138 ± 8%, n = 6, p < 0.001, data obtained at 30 min). f, in vitro phosphorylation assays reveal that immunopurified CAKβ and Src become tyrosine-phosphorylated (immunoblotted with a phosphotyrosine antibody) in response to CHPG but not CHPG plus MPEP.

https://openalex.org/W2131100396,"A novel transport protein with the properties of voltage-driven organic anion transport was isolated from pig kidney cortex by expression cloning in Xenopus laevis oocytes. A cDNA library was constructed from size-fractionated poly(A)+ RNA and screened for p-aminohippurate (PAH) transport in high potassium medium. A 1856-base pair cDNA encoding a 467-amino acid peptide designated as OATV1 (voltage-driven organic anion transporter 1) was isolated. The predicted amino acid sequence of OATV1 exhibited 60–65% identity to those of human, rat, rabbit, and mouse sodium-dependent phosphate cotransporter type 1 (NPT1), although OATV1 did not transport phosphate. The homology of this transporter to known members of the organic anion transporter family (OAT family) was about 25–30%. OATV1-mediated PAH transport was affected by the changes in membrane potential. The transport was Na+-independent and enhanced at high concentrations of extracellular potassium and low concentrations of extracellular chloride. Under the voltage clamp condition, extracellularly applied PAH induced outward currents in oocytes expressing OATV1. The current showed steep voltage dependence, consistent with the voltage-driven transport of PAH by OATV1. The PAH transport was inhibited by various organic anions but not by organic cations, indicating the multispecific nature of OATV1 for anionic compounds. This transport protein is localized at the apical membrane of renal proximal tubule, consistent with the proposed localization of a voltage-driven organic anion transporter. Therefore, it is proposed that OATV1 plays an important role to excrete drugs, xenobiotics, and their metabolites driven by membrane voltage through the apical membrane of the tubular epithelial cells into the urine.

The predicted amino acid sequence of OATV1 exhibited 60–65% identity to those of human, rat, rabbit, and mouse sodium-dependent phosphate cotransporter type 1 (NPT1), although OATV1 did not transport phosphate. The homology of this transporter to known members of the organic anion transporter family (OAT family) was about 25–30%. OATV1-mediated PAH transport was affected by the changes in membrane potential. The transport was Na+-independent and enhanced at high concentrations of extracellular potassium and low concentrations of extracellular chloride. Under the voltage clamp condition, extracellularly applied PAH induced outward currents in oocytes expressing OATV1. The current showed steep voltage dependence, consistent with the voltage-driven transport of PAH by OATV1. The PAH transport was inhibited by various organic anions but not by organic cations, indicating the multispecific nature of OATV1 for anionic compounds. This transport protein is localized at the apical membrane of renal proximal tubule, consistent with the proposed localization of a voltage-driven organic anion transporter. Therefore, it is proposed that OATV1 plays an important role to excrete drugs, xenobiotics, and their metabolites driven by membrane voltage through the apical membrane of the tubular epithelial cells into the urine. In kidney, the secretion of organic anions takes place in the renal proximal tubular epithelial cells via at least two steps. The first is the transport of organic anions from the peritubular plasma across the basolateral membrane into the proximal tubular cells. p-Aminohippurate (PAH) 1The abbreviations used are: PAH, p-aminohippurate; OAT, organic anion transporter; OATV1, voltage-driven organic anion transporter 1; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. has been used as a prototypical substrate for the renal organic anion transport systems (1Moller J.V.

The transport of PAH across the basolateral membrane of proximal tubular cells against the electrochemical gradient (3Burg M.B. Orloff J. Am. J. Physiol. 1969; 217: F1064-F1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) occurs in exchange for intracellular dicarboxylates such as α-ketoglutarate (4Pritchard J.B. Am. J.

Physiol. 2003; 284: F763-F769Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), have been proposed to be responsible for this step. The second step is the exit of organic anions across the apical membrane at the tubular epithelial cells into the urine. Although this process is energetically downhill for organic anions, it has been believed that this process is also mediated by specific transporters. The luminal efflux system for PAH has been investigated mostly using brush border membrane vesicles. In dogs (10Aronson P.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 419-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 11Blomstedt J.W. Aronson P.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 65: 931-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 12Guggino S.E.

Weinman E.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 245: F151-F158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), anion exchange mechanisms have been demonstrated for the luminal efflux systems. They mediate probenecid-sensitive electroneutral exchange of anionic compounds including both organic (e.g. PAH, urate, and lactate) and inorganic (e.g. Cl–, HCO3- , OH–) anions. A distinct efflux system involving the voltage-driven transport was demonstrated in pig and rabbit (15Martinez F. Manganel M. Montrose-Rafizadeh C. Werner D. Roch-Ramel F. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: F1145-F1153PubMed Google Scholar, 16Werner D. Martinez F. Roch-Ramel F. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 252: 792-799PubMed Google Scholar, 17Krick W. Wolff N.A. Burckhardt G. Pflugers Arch. 2000; 441: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In bovine renal brush border membrane vesicles, a PAH/dicarboxylate exchange system was reported (18Schmitt C. Burckhardt G. Pflugers Arch. 1993; 423: 280-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). PAH transport at the apical membrane in the OK kidney epithelial cell line was shown to be mediated by a voltage-driven transport system but not by an anion exchange system (19Habu Y. Yano I. Hashimoto Y. Saito H. Inui K. Pharmacol. Res. 2002; 19: 1822-1826Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In the physiological condition, a major component of the exit path of organic anions from renal proximal tubular cells has been proposed to be the facilitated diffusion along the electrochemical potential gradient (2Pritchard J.B. Miller D.S. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 765-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 23Dantzler W.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1566: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Voltage-driven organic anion transport plays an important role for this step. However, the molecular nature and precise functional properties of these efflux systems are still unknown. MRP2, an ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporter, was suggested to be one of the exit paths of PAH in proximal tubular cells. Studies of membrane vesicles from MRP2-expressing HEK or Sf9 cells have indicated that MRP2 transports PAH (20Leier I. Hummel-Eisenbeiss J. Cui Y. Keppler D. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 1636-1642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 21Van Aubel R.A. Peters J.G. Masereeuw R. Van Os C.H. Russel F.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F713-F717PubMed Google Scholar) in an ATP-dependent manner. Recently, it was shown that the human sodium-dependent phosphate cotransporter type 1 (NPT1) present at the apical membrane of proximal tubules transports organic anions including PAH. The PAH transport by NPT1 expressed in HEK293 was Cl– sensitive (22Uchino H. Tamai I. Yamashita K. Minemoto Y. Sai Y. Yabuuchi H. Miyamoto K. Takeda E. Tsuji A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 254-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Although NPT1 is a candidate of the exit path for PAH at the apical membrane of proximal tubules, the reported properties of NPT1, in particular its K+-dependence, is not consistent with those of the voltage-driven PAH transporter at the apical membrane. In the present study, to identify the transporter responsible for the exit of PAH through the apical membrane, we have performed expression cloning using pig kidney cortex poly(A)+ RNA and identified a novel transporter present at the apical membrane of proximal tubules that mediates voltage-driven facilitated diffusion. Expression of Pig Kidney Cortex Poly(A) + RNA—Xenopus laevis oocyte expression studies and uptake measurements were performed as described elsewhere (24Kanai Y. Nussberger S. Romero M.F. Boron W.F.

Defolliculated oocytes were injected with poly(A)+ RNA (50 ng) obtained from kidney cortex of adult female pig (body weight 102 kg). Three days after injection and incubation of oocytes at 18 °C, the uptake experiments were performed in high potassium uptake solution (98 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 20 μm [14C]PAH (1 μCi/ml). Preparation of Size-fractionated Pig Kidney Poly(A) + RNA and Expression Cloning—Four hundred micrograms of pig kidney poly(A)+ RNA was size-fractionated using preparative gel electrophoresis (Bio-Rad, model 491 Prep cell) (6Sekine T.

The isolated poly(A)+ RNA fractions were examined for [14C]PAH (20 μm) transport activity by expression in X. laevis oocytes in the high potassium uptake solution. The positive fraction showing the greatest activity of [14C]PAH uptake was used to construct a directional cDNA library (27Kanai Y. Segawa H. Miyamoto K. Uchino H. Takeda E. Endou H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23629-23632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar, 28Kim D.K. Kanai Y. Chairoungdua A. Matsuo H. Cha S.H. Endou H. J. Biol.

Hediger M.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar). cRNA synthesized in vitro from pools of ∼500 clones was injected into Xenopus oocytes. A positive pool showing the [14C]PAH uptake activity in the high potassium uptake solution was sequentially subdivided and analyzed until a single clone (OATV1) was identified. The cDNA was sequenced in both directions by the dye terminator cycle sequencing method using an ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer (PE Biosystems). Functional Characterization—Twenty-five nanograms of OATV1 cRNA synthesized in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase from the OATV1 cDNA in pSPORT1 linearized with NotI were injected into defolliculated Xenopus oocytes. Two or 3 days after injection the uptake of radiolabeled substrates was measured in various uptake solutions (differing in ion composition) to examine its dependence on sodium or chloride. In sodium-free solution, LiCl or choline-Cl were used to replace NaCl in the standard uptake solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). For the high potassium uptake solution, NaCl in the standard uptake solution was replaced by KCl. For Cl–-free medium, sodium gluconate, potassium gluconate, calcium gluconate, and MgSO4 were used to replace NaCl, KCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2, respectively. To prepare the uptake solution at pH 5.5 and 6.5, MES was used instead of HEPES for the buffer system (30Segawa H. Fukasawa Y. Miyamoto K. Takada E. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19745-19751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The uptake measurements were performed for 60 min at room temperature (22–25 °C). The radioactivity was counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry, and the values are expressed as femtomole per oocyte per min. To examine the effects of the extracellular concentration of K+ and Cl– on the OATV1-mediated [14C]PAH uptake, the concentrations of K+ or Cl– were varied over the range of 0 to 100 mm (0, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 mm). The concentrations of K+ in the uptake solution were varied in Na+-free solution in which [KCl] plus [choline-Cl] was equal to 100 mm. The concentration of Cl– was varied in the high potassium uptake solution in which [KCl] plus [K-gluconate] was equal to 100 mm. Kinetic Study—Because the uptake of substrates in high potassium uptake solution was linear longer than 2 h, the uptake was measured for 30 min for kinetic studies. The concentrations of PAH, urate, and estrone sulfate were varied from 10 μm to 10 mm, from 10 μm to 5 mm, and from 1 to 500 μm, respectively. OATV1-mediated substrate uptake was calculated as the difference between the values of uptake into cRNA-injected oocytes and those of control oocytes (without cRNA injection). The K m values were determined with the Eadie-Hofstee equation. To measure the K i values for the transport, oocytes expressing OATV1 were incubated for 30 min in high potassium uptake solution with various concentrations of [14C]PAH with or without addition of inhibitors. The K i values were determined by double-reciprocal plot analysis in which 1/uptake rate of [14C]PAH was plotted against 1/[14C]PAH concentration. The K i values were calculated from the following equation when competitive inhibition was observed: K i = (K t[I])/(K a – K t), where K a, K t, and [I] are K m of PAH with inhibitor, K m of PAH without inhibitor, and concentration of inhibitor, respectively (31Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-State Enzyme Systems. Wiley-Interscience, New York1975Google Scholar). Efflux Measurement—Fifty nanoliters of [14C]PAH (2.5 nCi, ∼1 mm), [14C]urate (2.5 nCi, ∼1 mm), or [3H]estrone sulfate (25 nCi, ∼20 mm) was injected into oocytes with a fine-tipped glass micropipette as described elsewhere (32Fukasawa Y. Segawa H. Kim J.Y. Chairoungdua A. Kim D.K. Matsuo H. Cha S.H. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9690-9969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 33Kanai Y.

Chem. 2000; 275: 20787-20793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The individual oocytes were incubated in ice-cold standard uptake solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) for 5 min and then transferred to the standard uptake solution kept at room temperature and incubated at room temperature for 2, 5, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, or 150 min. Then, the incubation solution was collected to determine the efflux of substrates from the oocytes into bath solution at the end of the incubation period. The radioactivity remaining in the oocytes was also measured. The efflux value was expressed as % radioactivity calculated from the radioactivity in the bathing solution × 100%/(the radioactivity in oocyte plus the radioactivity in bathing solution). The dependence of [14C]PAH efflux on inorganic ions was determined by comparing the [14C]PAH uptake in the standard uptake solution and that in the solutions in which NaCl was replaced by KCl, sodium gluconate, potassium gluconate, LiCl, or choline-Cl as mentioned above. The pH dependence of [14C]PAH efflux was measured in the standard uptake solution with varied pH to 5.5, 6.5, 7.4, and 8.5. The efflux was measured for 15 min over which the linear efflux value was obtained. To examine the trans-stimulation of the efflux of PAH, [14C]PAH-injected oocytes were incubated in the standard uptake solution with or without non-radiolabeled PAH (0.01, 0.1, 1, 5, or 10 mm) for 15 min at room temperature. For the uptake and efflux measurements in the present study, 8–10 oocytes were used for each data point. The values are expressed as mean ± S.E. The reproducibility of the results was confirmed by three separate experiments with different batches of oocytes. The results from representative experiments are shown in figures. Electrophysiological Measurements—The electrical currents induced by 5 mm PAH in both control and OATV1-cRNA-injected X. laevis oocytes were recorded during voltage clamp at –60 to +40 mV in the standard uptake solution (24Kanai Y.

Furuta Y. Fukuda K. Igarashi T. Endou H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F298-F305PubMed Google Scholar). At each step (20 mV interval) of voltage clamp, the baseline electrical current was first determined and then 5 mm PAH was added to the bath medium for 2 min. The solution was then changed back to the standard uptake solution and the record was continued until the electrical current was returned to the baseline level. Northern Analysis—Poly(A)+ RNA (4 μg/lane) isolated from pig tissues was electrophoresed on 1% agarose, 2.2 m formaldehyde gel and transferred to nitrocellulose filter (Schleicher & Schuell). The filter was hybridized with 500-bp OATV1 cDNA labeled with [32P]dCTP at 42 °C overnight and washed finally in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C (25Utsunomiya-Tate N. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14883-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Anti-peptide Antibody—A rabbit polyclonal antibody against a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated synthetic peptide, EVQDWAKER-QNTYL, corresponding to 14 amino acid residues near the carboxyl terminus (454–467 of the amino acid sequence) of OATV1 was generated and affinity purified as described elsewhere (36Hisano S. Haga H. Miyamoto K. Takeda E. Fukui Y. Brain Res. 1996; 710: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 37Chairoungdua A. Segawa H. Kim J.Y. Miyamoto K. Haga H. Fukui Y. Mizoguchi K. Ito H. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28845-28848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Pig kidney epithelial membranes were prepared as described previously (38Thorens B. Sarkar H.K. Kaback H.R. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1988; 55: 281-290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar) and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (39Taketani Y. Segawa H. Chikamori M. Morita K. Tanaka K. Kido S. Yamamoto H. Iemori Y. Tatsumi S. Tsugawa N. Okano T. Kobayashi T. Miyamoto K. Takeda E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14575-14581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The separated proteins were transferred electrophoretically to a Hybond-P polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were treated with diluted affinity purified anti-OATV1 antibody (1:5,000) overnight at 4 °C. Thereafter, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG was used as the secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc). The signals were detected using the ECL Plus system (Amersham Biosciences). The specificity of immunoreaction was confirmed by an absorption experiment in the presence of antigen peptide (100 μg/ml). Immunohistochemistry—Three-micrometer paraffin sections of pig kidney were processed for light microscopic immunohistochemical analysis as described previously (36Hisano S. Haga H. Miyamoto K. Takeda E. Fukui Y. Brain Res. 1996; 710: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The kidney sections were incubated with affinity purified anti-OATV1 antibody (1:1,000) at 4 °C overnight and treated with Envision (+) rabbit peroxidase (DAKO) for 30 min. The immunoreactions were detected with diaminobenzidine (0.8 mm) (40Tojo A. Sekine T. Nakajima N. Hosoyamada M. Kanai Y. Kimura K. Endou H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 464-471PubMed Google Scholar). For absorption experiments, the serial kidney sections were treated with the primary antibody in the presence of antigen peptide (100 μg/ml). Screening of cDNA Library—Total poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from pig kidney cortex and size-fractionated. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, the fractions corresponding to ∼1.7 to 2.2 kilobases exhibited the peak activity of the uptake of 20 μm [14C]PAH in high potassium uptake solution: 1.5–2.0-fold of the uptake by control water-injected oocytes. These poly(A)+ RNA fractions were used as a template for construction of a cDNA library. The library was screened for [14C]PAH uptake by expression in Xenopus oocytes to isolate a 1,856-base pair cDNA clone that encodes a protein designated as OATV1 (voltage-driven organic anion transporter 1). The OATV1 cDNA contains an open reading frame encoding a putative 467-amino acid protein. Twelve transmembrane domains were predicted on the OATV1 amino acid sequence based on SOSUI algorithm (41Hirokawa T. Boon-Chieng S. Mitaku S. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 378-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of OATV1 exhibited the highest identity (60–65%) to that of sodium-dependent phosphate cotransporter type 1 (NPT1) of each species (rat, mouse, rabbit, and human). The homology to amino acid sequences of sodium-dependent phosphate cotransporter type 2 (NPT2) and other OATs is ∼25–30%. Tissue Distribution—The Northern blot using the OATV1 cDNA fragment as a probe showed a strong signal in pig kidney and liver (Fig. 1a). The OATV1 transcript was not detected in brain, lung, small intestine, and skeletal muscle. The major transcript detected in liver and kidney was ∼3.2 kb. In addition, a faint band at ∼1.8 kb was also detected in both kidney and liver. The 4.4-kb faint band was detected only in liver. In Western blot analysis, the antibody raised against the COOH terminus peptide of OATV1 recognized a band of 60 kDa in the membrane protein prepared from total pig kidney and the brush border membrane of pig kidney cortex (Fig. 1b). This band was consistent with a predicted molecular mass of OATV1 protein (51 kDa). The band disappeared in the presence of antigen peptide in the absorption test, confirming the specificity of the immunoreaction (Fig. 1b). Transport Activity of OAT V 1—Because the luminal facilitated transport system in pig and rabbit was reported to be markedly dependent on membrane potential (15Martinez F. Manganel M. Montrose-Rafizadeh C. Werner D. Roch-Ramel F. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: F1145-F1153PubMed Google Scholar, 16Werner D. Martinez F. Roch-Ramel F. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 252: 792-799PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the effect of raising external K+ on the OATV1-mediated transport. The elevation of external K+ depolarizes the plasma membrane of Xenopus oocyte (42Grundemann D. Gorboulev V. Gambaryan S. Veyhl M. Koepsell H. Nature. 1994; 372: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, the uptake values of [14C]PAH, [14C]urate, [3H]estrone sulfate, and [3H]estradiol-17β-glucuronide by OATV1 expressing oocytes were significantly higher in high potassium solution (98 mmK+) compared with those incubated in standard uptake solution (2 mm K+), whereas control oocytes showed no difference between these conditions, suggesting that OATV1-mediated transport is dependent on membrane voltage. The uptake of [14C]PAH was saturable and followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Fig. 3a) with a K m value of 4.38 ± 0.96 mm (mean ± S.E. of three separate experiments) (Fig. 3b). K m values for [14C]urate and [3H]estrone sulfate were >5 and 0.212 mm, respectively (data not shown).Fig. 3Concentration dependence of OATV1-mediated [14C]PAH uptake. a, OATV1-mediated [14C]PAH uptake by oocytes expressing OATV1 was measured in a high potassium uptake solution (98 mm K+) and plotted against PAH concentration. The PAH uptake was saturable and fit to the Michaelis-Menten curve. b, Eadie-Hofstee plot analysis was performed on the PAH uptake. K m and V max values were 4.40 mm and 18.38 pmol/oocyte/min, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Characteristic of OAT V 1-mediated Organic Anion Transport—The PAH uptake by OATV1-expressing oocytes was also measured in various uptake solutions with different ionic contents. Replacement of Na+ with Li+ or choline+ did not affect [14C]PAH uptake (Fig. 4a), indicating that OATV1-mediated [14C]PAH transport was not dependent on Na+ in the uptake solution. The replacement of Na+ with K+ or Rb+ increased the OATV1-mediated transport (Figs. 2 and 4a). Fig. 4b further shows the dependence of OATV1-mediated [14C]PAH uptake on K+ concentration, indicating that raising extracellular K+ increased PAH transport in a concentration-dependent manner. Fig. 4a also shows the effect of the replacement of Cl– with other anions. PAH uptake was higher in OATV1-expressing oocytes incubated in potassium gluconate solution than that in KCl uptake solution. PAH uptake was also higher in sodium gluconate, NaBr, or NaF solution than that in NaCl solution. As shown in Fig. 4c, PAH transport was dependent on Cl– concentration. In the chloride-free solution and the solution containing 5 mm chloride, OATV1 expressing oocytes showed a significant elevation of PAH uptake (Fig. 4c). The PAH uptake did not show any remarkable pH dependence within the pH range of 5.5 and 8.5 (Fig. 4d). We also found that urate transport by OATV1 showed the same properties as those of PAH transport (data not shown). Voltage-dependent PAH Transport— Fig. 4 showed that PAH uptake by OATV1-expressing oocytes was affected by the changes of K+ or Cl– concentration in the uptake solution. It seemed that PAH uptake is dependent on membrane voltage change generated by the alteration of K+ and Cl– concentrations. To confirm the voltage dependence of PAH transport by OATV1, we performed electrophysiological measurement of PAH-induced currents under the voltage clamp condition. PAH application to the bath medium induced outward current in the oocytes expressing OATV1, whereas no significant current was elicited by 5 mm PAH in the control oocytes. The PAH-induced current was dependent on membrane voltage (Fig. 5). The electric currents induced by 5 mm PAH were increased when the holding potential was elevated from –60 to +40 mV as shown in Fig. 5. Characteristic of OAT V 1-mediated PAH Efflux—According to the voltage-driven transport of PAH, in the physiological condition PAH is supposed to be transported from the intracellular compartment to the extracellular compartment along the electrical gradient. As shown in Fig. 6a, OATV1-expressing oocytes preloaded with [14C]PAH showed time-dependent efflux of radioactivity when incubated in the standard uptake solution. The voltage dependence of PAH transport was also observed for the efflux experiments. The OATV1-expressing oocytes showed a reduction of PAH efflux from the oocytes to the extracellular medium when the oocytes were incubated in high potassium uptake solution, which generates inside positive potential (Fig. 6b). The effect of pH on [14C]PAH efflux was examined in the standard upt"

These features ensure that those motors that have completed their power stroke dissociate rapidly enough to prevent them from interfering with those motors that are beginning theirs. However, in this study, we demonstrate that myosin IIB, a cytoplasmic myosin II particularly enriched in the central nervous system and cardiac tissue, has a number of features that it shares instead with “unconventional” myosin isoforms, including myosins V and VI. These include a high duty ratio, rate-limiting ADP release, and high ADP affinity. These features imply that myosin IIB serves a set of physiologic needs different from those served by its more conventional myosin II counterparts, and this work provides a plausible basis for explaining the physiologic role of this unconventionally conventional myosin.

The myosin superfamily currently consists of 17 classes of motors (1Hodge T. Cope M.J.T.V. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3353-3354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The class II myosins include those motors that compose the thick filaments of smooth, skeletal, and cardiac muscle. Because myosin II isoforms from these tissues were the first contractile proteins to be studied, members of this class have been referred to as “conventional” (2Sellers J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1496: 3-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). This term has set myosin II apart from the other classes of myosins, which in aggregate have been labeled “unconventional.” Structural and enzymatic features that have been thought to be typical of myosin II include the ability to form ordered arrays of thick filaments, the ability of individual motor domains to function independently, rate-limiting phosphate release, and low duty ratio (3Holmes K.C. Geeves M.A. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2000; 355: 419-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 4Geeves M.A. Holmes K.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 687-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). For myosin from contractile tissues like muscle, these features would be essential because they would ensure that the individual heads of a thick filament would spend only a brief time generating force and would not interfere with each other during periods of sustained contraction and shortening. However, vertebrate myosin II is in fact widely distributed and readily detectable in non-muscle cells as well (5Kawamoto S. Adelstein R.S. J.

Sequence studies reveal three classes of non-muscle myosin II isoforms named A, B, and C (9Pato M.D. Sellers J.R. Preston Y.A. Harvey E.V. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol.

Myosin II is necessary for cell motility, maintenance of normal cell-surface receptor distribution, and stress fiber formation (12Gillespie G.Y. Soroceanu L. Manning T. Gladson C.L. Rosenfeld S.S.

Nature. 1989; 341: 549-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Whereas myosin IIA is found in nearly all tissues, the distribution of myosin IIB appears to be more limited (8Kelley C.A.

Myosin IIB is required for normal development of the brain and heart (17Tullio A.N. Accili D. Ferrans V.J. Yu Z.X. Takeda K. Grinberg A. Westphal H. Preston Y.A. Adelstein R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12407-12412Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), and it also plays an essential role in directed growth cone motility (14Wylie S.R. Chantler P.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 18Bridgman P.C. Dave S. Asnes C.F. Tullio A.N. Adelstein R.S. J.

In particular, studies of cultured neurons from myosin IIB knockout mice have led to the suggestion that this motor is required for maintenance of cortical tension, a key component in directed cell motility (18Bridgman P.C. Dave S. Asnes C.F. Tullio A.N. Adelstein R.S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6159-6169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Non-muscle myosin II thick filaments are 20–30-fold smaller than their smooth or skeletal muscle counterparts, containing <28 myosin molecules (20Verkhovsky A.B. Borisy G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 637-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This is not surprising because the 1–2-μm long filaments of skeletal or smooth muscle would be far too large to effectively generate force in the presence of the tightly packed meshwork that characterizes the actin cytoskeleton (13Svitkina T.M. Verkhovsky A.B. McQuade K.M. Borisy G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 397-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Although the smaller size of non-muscle myosin II-containing thick filaments represents an adaptation to the demands of cytoplasmic contractility, it also presents a challenge for a motor designed to maintain cortical tension. Conventional myosins typically have duty ratios in the range of 3–4%. This low ratio ensures that myosin heads that have completed their power stroke do not resist those heads beginning theirs. For a large thick filament such as myosin II from smooth or skeletal muscle, this does not present a problem because the large number of heads within a thick filament would ensure that at least a few would be strongly attached at any given time, and they would prevent the thick filament from diffusing away. However, a low duty ratio for non-muscle myosin II would mean that there would be an appreciable chance that, at any given time, no heads would be strongly attached to actin. This could be problematic for a myosin designed to generate cortical tension because even brief loss of contact of a myosin IIB filament with actin would lead to immediate loss of tension and elastic recoil of the cytoskeleton. Given these considerations, we would therefore predict that myosin IIB has a high duty ratio, a feature generally thought to be more characteristic of the unconventional myosins (21De La Cruz E.M. Wells A. Rosenfeld S.S. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13726-13731Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 22De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32373-32381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). However, a high duty ratio for a filament-forming myosin such as myosin IIB would present another problem: the resistance of strongly bound heads to force generation by actively contracting heads, which has been discussed above. To get around this problem, we would therefore also predict that myosin IIB has an additional feature generally thought to be characteristic of unconventional myosins: a strain-dependent release mechanism (23Veigel C. Wang F. Bartoo M.L. Sellers J.R. Molloy J.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 29Coluccio L.M. Geeves M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21575-21580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In such a mechanism, release of a strongly bound head would occur only when it experienced strain induced by another actively contracting head. In this study, we have systematically examined the steps that constitute the myosin IIB mechanochemical cycle. This work establishes that, although myosin IIB resembles smooth muscle myosin II in some aspects of its enzymology, its kinetics also share features that have heretofore been thought to be characteristic of unconventional myosins such as myosins V and VI. This study also provides insight into how the physiologic demand for maintenance of cortical tension is translated into specific changes in the kinetics of the actomyosin ATPase cycle. Recombinant Myosin IIB Expression and Purification—To create single-headed, subfragment-1-like myosin IIB constructs, a chicken non-muscle myosin IIB heavy chain cDNA (B1 isoform of loop 1 with no loop 2 insertion; kindly provided by Dr. Robert Adelstein) was truncated at Leu845. A FLAG tag (encoding GDYKDDDDK) was inserted at the C terminus to facilitate purification (24Hopp T.P. Prickett K.S. Price V. Libby R.T. March C.J. Cerretti P. Urdal D.L. Conlon P.J. Biotechnology. 1988; 6: 1205-1210Crossref Scopus (752) Google Scholar). The recombinant heavy chain protein contains the motor domain and both the essential light chain- and regulatory light chain-binding sites (IQ motifs). Expression of recombinant myosin IIB subfragment-1 was accomplished via infection of Sf9 insect cells with a baculovirus expression vector capable of driving high level expression of foreign proteins. The Sf9 cells were co-infected with recombinant virus expressing the myosin IIB heavy chain and with recombinant viruses for the non-muscle essential and regulatory light chains. Details of the protein expression and purification have been published (25Sweeney H.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Brown F. Faust L. Smith J. Xing J. Stein L.A. Sellers J.R. J. Biol.

Myosin IIB was made nucleotide-free by incubation in 10 mm EDTA for 20 min at room temperature, followed by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 (PD-10, Amersham Biosciences). Fluorescence and Kinetic Methodologies—Steady-state and transient-state fluorescence measurements were made as previously described (25Sweeney H.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Brown F. Faust L. Smith J. Xing J.

Kinetic measurements were made using an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV stopped-flow spectrophotometer with an instrument dead time of 1.2 ms as described (21De La Cruz E.M. Wells A. Rosenfeld S.S.

Open table in a new tab ATP-induced Formation of a Weakly Bound State—ATP binding to actomyosin can be monitored by quenching of a pyrene fluorophore on actin. Formation of a weak binding state occurs as a two-step reaction, with initial formation of a collision complex followed by a first-order quenching of pyrene fluorescence: AM + T → AM(T) → A*M·T, where the asterisk refers to a state of enhanced pyrene fluorescence. Scheme 1 predicts a fluorescence rise that obeys a first-order process whose rate varies hyperbolically with ATP concentration. Fig. 1 confirms this and reveals a maximum rate of 409 ± 13 s–1 and a dissociation constant of 646 ± 41 μm (Table I). Similar results were obtained using the turbidity change at 350 nm as a measure of the dissociation step (data not shown). ATP Hydrolysis by Myosin IIB—ATP binding to myosin IIB produced an 11% enhancement of tryptophan fluorescence emission, whereas ADP binding produced a 4–5% enhancement (data not shown). Tryptophan fluorescence enhancement produced by ATP binding is characteristic of myosins, and the maximum rate of this process has been shown for both smooth and skeletal muscle myosin II, as well as myosin V, to be a measure of the hydrolysis step, k 3 + k –3 (21De La Cruz E.M. Wells A. Rosenfeld S.S. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13726-13731Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). As with these other myosins, the rate of this process for myosin IIB varied hyperbolically with ATP concentration (Fig. 2). This dependence defines a maximum rate of 16.7 ± 1.1 s–1 with an apparent ATP dissociation constant of 37 ± 9 μm (Table I). Phosphate Release—The kinetics of actin-activated phosphate release from myosin IIB were measured in a sequential mixing experiment. Nucleotide-free myosin IIB was mixed with a 10-fold molar excess of ATP. The complex was allowed to age for 500 ms to allow population of the myosin IIB·ADP·Pi state, and it was then mixed with varying concentrations of actin and 2 mm ADP. ADP was present in the final mixture to block further ATP binding and hydrolysis and to drive the myosin IIB into a strong binding state. Phosphate release was monitored by using MDCC 1The abbreviations used are: MDCC, N-[2-(1-maleimidyl)ethyl]-7-(diethylamino)coumarin 3-carboxamide; mant-, N-methylanthraniloyl-; 2′-dmD, 2′-deoxy-N-methylanthraniloyl-ADP.-labeled phosphate-binding protein at a 10-fold molar excess over active sites (21De La Cruz E.M. Wells A. Rosenfeld S.S. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13726-13731Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 22De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32373-32381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The resulting fluorescence enhancement, due to phosphate binding to MDCC-labeled phosphate-binding protein, fit a single exponential process. The rate of this process (k 4′) varied linearly over the range of actin concentrations examined (Fig. 3, closed triangles), and the slope of this curve (solid line) defines an apparent second-order rate constant of 0.0038 ± 0.0003 μm–1 s–1. Because phosphate release is rate-limiting for other myosin II isoforms (27Rosenfeld S.S. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11908-11919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we expected this to be the case for myosin IIB as well. To test this, we measured the rate of product release from actomyosin IIB as a function of actin concentration by performing the following experiment. Nucleotide-free myosin IIB was mixed with a 10-fold molar excess of 2′-deoxy-mant-ATP. The mixture was allowed to age for 500 ms and then mixed with varying concentrations of actin and 2 mm ADP. As shown in Fig. 3 (open squares), the rate of mant-ADP release also varied linearly with actin concentration (dashed line), but the apparent second-order rate constant is nearly 2.5-fold lower, at 0.0015 ± 0.0001 μm–1 s–1. This implies that another step, subsequent to phosphate release, at least partially limits the ATPase rate. Myosin IIB·ADP and Actomyosin IIB·ADP States—In our previous study of smooth muscle actomyosin, we utilized the fluorescent nucleotide 2′-dmD to examine the sequence of conformational changes that the active site undergoes as it releases ADP (26Rosenfeld S.S. Xing J. Whitaker M. Cheung H.C. Brown F. Wells A. Milligan R.A. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25418-25426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Our results could be interpreted in terms of Scheme 2, in which the affinity of ADP for actomyosin decreases from the AM·D1 to the AM·D2 state. Binding of smooth muscle myosin·ADP to actin favors formation of the AM·D2 state (26Rosenfeld S.S. Xing J. Whitaker M. Cheung H.C. Brown F. Wells A. Milligan R.A. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25418-25426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and we wished to see if a similar scheme applied to myosin IIB. We utilized the same approach that we employed in our previous study of smooth muscle myosin II: an examination of the fluorescence lifetimes of 2′-dmD bound to myosin IIB and actomyosin IIB. The fluorescence decay of myosin IIB·2′-dmD can be characterized by two lifetimes of 8.49 and 2.22 ns with fractional steady-state intensities of f 1 and f 2, respectively. The ratio of these fractional intensities (f 2/f 1) defines an equilibrium constant, where for myosin IIB·ADP, f 2/f 1 = [M·D2]/[M·D1], and for actomyosin IIB·ADP, f 2/f 1 = [AM·D2]/[AM·D1]. We measured f 2/f 1 as a function of temperature, and the resulting van't Hoff plots are depicted in Fig. 4 for myosin IIB·2′-dmD (open squares, solid line) and actomyosin IIB·2′-dmD (closed triangles, dashed line). This reveals ΔH 0 and ΔS 0 values of 10.8 kcal/mol and 36.5 cal/degree/mol, respectively, for myosin IIB and 8.4 kcal/mol and 24.8 cal/degree/mol, respectively, for actomyosin IIB.Fig. 4van't Hoff plot of myosin IIB·2′-dmD and actomyosin IIB·2′-dmD. The conditions were as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Open squares, myosin IIB·2′-dmD; closed triangles, actomyosin IIB·2′-dmD.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These results allow us to make a comparison with smooth muscle myosin and actomyosin. Whereas f 2/f 1 for smooth muscle myosin II·ADP is 0.075 at 20 °C, the corresponding value for myosin IIB·ADP is 0.58. Thus, a significantly greater fraction of myosin IIB·ADP is in a weak nucleotide binding state. Binding of smooth muscle myosin II·ADP to actin increases the value of f 2/f 1 by a factor of 8 (26Rosenfeld S.S. Xing J. Whitaker M. Cheung H.C. Brown F. Wells A. Milligan R.A. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25418-25426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the case of myosin IIB·ADP, just the opposite is seen: actin binding reduces f 2/f 1 from 0.58 to 0.12. Thus, whereas actin binding to smooth muscle myosin II·ADP drives the AM·D 1 ↔ AM·D 2 equilibrium to the right, enhancing ADP dissociation, it drives this equilibrium to the left for myosin IIB and, in doing so, would be expected to increase ADP affinity. Kinetics of Myosin IIB·ADP Binding to Actin—The fluorescence lifetime data indicate that myosin IIB·ADP and actomyosin IIB·ADP are distributed between two states that differ in their affinity for ADP. However, the data do not provide information on the actin binding affinities of these states. We therefore examined the effect of myosin IIB·ADP on the fluorescence of pyrene-labeled actin. We first mixed a complex of nucleotide-free myosin IIB·actin with 2 mm ADP; and, as in the case of smooth muscle myosin II, we saw no change in the pyrene fluorescence emission (data not shown). This means that both AM·D1 and AM·D2 are strong actin binding states. What are the actin affinities of the M·D1 and M·D2 states? To address this question, we mixed myosin IIB and 2 mm ADP with a 5–7-fold molar excess of pyrene-labeled actin and 2 mm ADP in the stopped-flow spectrometer. Formation of a strongly bound myosin IIB·ADP·actin complex will quench the fluorescence of a pyrenyl probe on actin, as noted above. The resulting fluorescence transient is shown in Fig. 5 (inset) and consists of fast and slow phases, with relative amplitudes of 0.35–0.4/0.65–0.60. The rates of both phases depend on actin concentration, but in different ways. The fast phase (closed squares) depends linearly on actin concentration (dashed line), and this dependence defines an apparent second-order rate constant of 1.40 ± 0.04 μm–1 s–1. This second-order rate constant also describes the kinetics produced by mixing nucleotide-free myosin IIB with pyrene-labeled actin (open triangles), and it is very similar to the second-order rate constant for binding of rigor smooth muscle myosin II to actin (1.24 μm–1 s–1) (30Cremo C.R. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1969-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Thus, the rapid phase is due to pyrene quenching by one or more strong myosin IIB·ADP binding states. By contrast, the slow phase demonstrates a hyperbolic dependence on actin concentration (open squares, solid line), defining a maximum rate of 6.4 ± 0.6 s–1 and an apparent dissociation constant of 5.9 ± 1.5 μm. These kinetics are to be expected for a two-step binding reaction, with formation of an initial weak actin binding complex followed by isomerization to a strong binding complex that quenches the pyrene fluorescence: A* + M·D ↔ A*M·D ↔ AM·D. Thus, in the absence of actin, myosin IIB·ADP is a mixture of strong and weak actin binding and strong and weak ADP binding states. However, actin binding shifts this distribution to produce a mixture of strong and weak ADP binding states that uniformly bind strongly to actin. A similar situation was found to apply to smooth muscle myosin II (26Rosenfeld S.S. Xing J. Whitaker M. Cheung H.C. Brown F. Wells A. Milligan R.A. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25418-25426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which could be explained by Scheme 3, where K a, K b, and K c are affinity constants for the various myosin IIB·ADP states for actin. This scheme allows us to integrate the fluorescence lifetime and pyrene kinetic studies. Because ADP does not quench the fluorescence of pyrene-labeled actomyosin IIB, we conclude that the AM·D 1 state is not populated (e.g. K 5′ » 1); and therefore, f 2/f 1 = [AM·D2 ]/[AM·D1 ] = K 6′. Furthermore, the presence of two phases in the pyrene fluorescence transient (Fig. 5) implies that, like smooth muscle myosin, an appreciable population of myosin IIB·ADP is in the M·D 1 state. Consequently, K 5′ » K 5, which in turn requires that K a « K b. This would be expected because, by definition, the actin affinity of the M·D 1 state should be much less than that of the M·D1 state. Kinetics of ADP Binding to and Release from Actomyosin IIB— Scheme 3 predicts that ADP dissociation from actomyosin should occur in two phases, reflecting the AM·D1 ↔ AM·D2 → AM transitions. This prediction is confirmed in Fig. 6A. Mixing myosin IIB·2′-dmD with actin and 4 mm ADP produced a biphasic fluorescence decrease. The rate of the faster phase shows a hyperbolic dependence on actin concentration, with an extrapolated value of 8.2 ± 1.9 s–1 and an apparent dissociation constant of 10.2 ± 4.9 μm, whereas that of the slower phase shows little actin concentration dependence (0.64 ± 0.06 s–1). The rates of these two phases depend on the values of k 6′, k –6′, and k 7′. To measure k 7′, we examined the kinetics of the fluorescence enhancement produced by mixing nucleotide-free actomyosin IIB with 2′-dmD. A plot of rate versus 2′-dmD concentration should be linear, and Fig. 6B confirms this. The slope defines an apparent second-order rate constant of 4.90 ± 0.05 μm–1 s–1; the y intercept defines a k 7′ value of 7.5 ± 1.4 s–1; and the ratio defines a K 7 value of 1.56 μm (Table I). ADP Affinity for Actomyosin IIB—When interpreted in the context of Scheme 3, our results indicate that K 6′ for actomyosin IIB is ∼11-fold lower than for smooth muscle actomyosin II (26Rosenfeld S.S. Xing J. Whitaker M. Cheung H.C. Brown F. Wells A. Milligan R.A. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25418-25426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This in turn implies that the ADP affinity for actomyosin IIB should be correspondingly higher. We measured the affinity of ADP for actomyosin IIB by incubating a complex of 300 nm nucleotide-free myosin IIB and 300 nm pyrene-labeled actin with varying concentrations of ADP and mixing in the stopped-flow spectrometer with 4 mm ATP. The resulting fluorescence decrease consisted of two phases: a rapid phase (rate of 250–350 s–1) due to ATP binding to nucleotide-free actomyosin IIB and a slow phase (rate of 0.71 ± 0.08 s–1) due to rate-limiting ADP release followed by ATP binding and dissociation (Fig. 7A). The total amplitude remained constant over the range of ADP concentrations tested, implying little ADP-induced dissociation (data not shown). However, the relative amplitudes of these two phases did vary with ADP concentration in a reciprocal manner and are plotted in Fig. 7B. Scheme 3 predicts that the fractional amplitude of the fast phase (θ) obeys the following relationship (Equation 1), θ=K6'·K7'K6'·K7'+[ADP]·(K6'+1)(Eq. 1) and fitting to this equation therefore allows us to independently test our model. This was accomplished by using the value of K 7′ determined from Fig. 6B, yielding a K 6′ value of 0.14 at 20 °C. This is in excellent agreement with the value of 0.12 that we had determined from the fluorescence lifetime data (Fig. 4). The midpoints of the curves in Fig. 7B define an apparent ADP dissociation constant of 154 nm (Table I). This compares with a value of 5 μm for smooth muscle actomyosin II (30Cremo C.R. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1969-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2008728162,"We report here for the first time the detection of the ribosomal p70S6 kinase (p70S6K) in a hematopoietic cell, the neutrophil, and the stimulation of its enzymatic activity by granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). GM-CSF modified the V max of the enzyme (from 7.2 to 20.5 pmol/min/mg) and induced a time- and dose-dependent phosphorylation on p70S6K residues Thr389 and Thr421/Ser424. The immunosuppressant macrolide rapamycin caused either a decrease in intensity of phospho-Thr389 bands in Western blots, or as a downshift in the relative mobility of phospho-Thr421/Ser424 bands (consistent with the loss of phosphate), but not both simultaneously. The immunosuppressant FK506 failed to inhibit p70S6K activation, but was able to rescue the rapamycin-induced downshift, pointing to a role for the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase. Rapamycin also caused an inhibition (IC50 0.2 nm) of the in vitro enzymatic activity of p70S6K. However, the inhibition of activity was not complete, but only a 40–50%, indicating that neutrophil p70S6K activity has a rapamycin-resistant component. This component was totally inhibited by pre-incubating the cells with the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD-98059 prior to treatment with rapamycin. This indicated that a kinase from the MEK/MAPK pathway also plays a role in p70S6K activation. Thus, GM-CSF causes the dual activation of a rapamycin-resistant, MAPK-related kinase, that targets Thr421/Ser424 S6K phosphorylation, and a rapamycin-sensitive, mTOR-related kinase, that targets Thr389, both of which are needed in cooperation to achieve full activation of neutrophil p70S6K.

Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (neutrophils) are recruited to sites of inflammation responding to chemoattractants that are secreted by several tissue cells in response to a physical or chemical insult, or by certain bacterial products in the case of a localized infection. The cytokine GM-CSF elicits the two components of cell migration in neutrophils: chemotaxis and chemokinesis. 2J. Gomez Cambronero, J. Horn, M. A. Baumann, and C. C. Paul, submitted manuscript. GM-CSF has a number of other functions on neutrophils and their bone marrow precursors, that involve the activation of two major signaling cascades: the JAK/STAT and Ras/MAPK pathways (reviewed in Ref. 33Gomez-Cambronero J. Veatch C. Life Sci. 1996; 59: 2099-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). GM-CSF-induced translocation of p42mapk (ERK2) to the cell nucleus and concomitant phosphorylation of the ribosomal kinase p90rsk is central in mitogenic events. Although it has been shown that G-CSF, a human hematopoietic factor related to GM-CSF, activates PI-3K/Akt(PKB) and promotes cell survival (34Hunter M.G. Avalos B.R. Blood. 2000; 95: 2132-2137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), little information exists regarding activation of other members of this cell signaling cascade, particularly p70S6K or whether GM-CSF will mediate its physiological effects (notably cell migration) through mTOR-S6K. We have previously demonstrated that MAPK activation in response to GM-CSF is up-regulated in mature cells such as the neutrophil and plays a role in chemotaxis (35Lehman J.A. Paul C.C. Baumann M.A. Gomez-Cambronero J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 280: 183-191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and that a molecular connection between the MAPK and the p70S6K pathways exists (36Lehman J.A. Gomez-Cambronero J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Here we report that p70S6K is present in neutrophils, that GM-CSF causes an increase in phosphorylation of Thr389 and Thr421/Ser424 concomitantly to an increase in its enzymatic activity. We also show for the first time that the mechanism by which GM-CSF activates ribosomal S6K is through a combination of activation of two signaling pathways: mTOR and MAPK.

(Lake Placid, NY). Cells—Peripheral blood neutrophils were isolated based on a protocol described by English and Andersen (37English D. Andersen B.R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1974; 5: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Between 50–55 ml of blood were collected from the antecubital vein of healthy individuals (who signed an Institutional Review Board-approved consent form) using sodium citrate as anticoagulant. Blood was mixed with 15 ml of 6% dextran, allowed to settle, and the plasma and buffy coat were removed and spun down at 800 × g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in 35 ml of saline and centrifuged again for 15 min at 10 °C in a Ficoll-Histopaque discontinuous gradient. Neutrophils were recovered and contaminating erythrocytes were lysed by hypotonic shock. Cells were washed and the purified neutrophil pellet was resuspended in Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS). Our experience has indicated that using this protocol, neutrophil aggregation (i.e. the hallmark for neutrophil activation) does not occur. Viability is usually >98 ± 2% as per trypan blue exclusion. Cells were resuspended at the concentration of 5 × 106 cells/ml in fresh Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) or in RPMI at 2 × 106 cells/ml at the time of the experiment, and used within 2–3 h after isolation. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting Analyses—The procedure was based on our previous report (38Joseph D.E. Paul C.C. Baumann M.A. Gomez-Cambronero J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13088-13093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) with some modifications, as follows. Neutrophils were resuspended in RPMI 1640 at 3 × 106 cells/ml density and were pretreated with rapamycin, FK506, or MEKi where appropriate and then stimulated with GM-CSF at 37 °C. Aliquots (1 ml) were taken, spun down (14,000 × g, 15 s) and pellets were resuspended in 0.2 ml of boiling SDS solution (1% SDS in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Samples were boiled in a heat block for 10 min with frequent vortexing to achieved complete dissolution, taken to an ice bucket and mixed with 0.3 ml cold ddH2O and 0.4 ml of cold, Triton X-100-based, lysis buffer (12 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.75 mm NaCl, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 μg/ml each of aprotinin, pepstatin A, and leupeptin, and 0.12% Triton X-100). The resulting 1 ml of total cell lysates were spun down (14,000 × g, 1 min, 4 °C) to remove any insoluble material and then used for immunoprecipitation. For this, the primary antibody (anti-p70S6K) was previously mixed at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml with anti-rabbit (IgG, whole molecule) antibody conjugated to agarose beads in lysis buffer for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were then thoroughly washed and mixed with total cell lysates prepared as indicated above at a ratio agarose beads/cell lysates 1:8 (v/v). After a 2-h incubation period at 4 °C, immune complexes were recovered by centrifugation (7,000 × g, 1 min, 4 °C). Pellets were washed twice with lysis buffer, twice with buffer A (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 400 mm LiCl) and twice with buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). Immune complex beads were resuspended in a final volume of 60 μl with lysis buffer and mixed with 2×-SDS sample buffer (1:1 v/v) for subsequent protein gel electrophoresis/immunoblotting. Resulting gels were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and used for immunoblotting. In several experiments, parallel blots were probed with the same antibody used for immunoprecipitation, to confirm that protein loading was similar (kept at <5% by measuring protein in samples by Bradford assay before loading) and that the small, unavoidable, differences in protein per lane can not account for differences in phosphorylation seen with the anti-phosphoantibodies. Immunocomplex p70S6 Kinase Assay—Ribosomal p70S6K enzymatic activity was quantified by using an immunocomplex kinase assay as reported previously (35Lehman J.A. Paul C.C. Baumann M.A. Gomez-Cambronero J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 280: 183-191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Lehman J.A. Gomez-Cambronero J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1996; 271: 13088-13093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) tailored to measure this particular kinase activity in human neutrophils. Neutrophils were resuspended in RPMI 1640 at 3 × 106 cells/ml density and were pretreated with rapamycin, FK506, or MEKi where appropriate and then stimulated with GM-CSF at 37 °C. Cells were spun down (14,000 × g, 15 s) and pellets were resuspended in 0.3 ml of ice-cold, TRIS-based, lysis buffer (see above for composition) and incubated on ice for 15 min with occasional vortexing. Lysates were obtained after centrifugation (7,000 × g, 1 min, 4 °C) in supernatants were mixed with the antibody conjugated to agarose beads as indicated above. Immune complex beads were resuspended in a final volume of 40 μl with of ice-cold lysis buffer (diluted 1:10) and used in an in vitro kinase assay. For this, the phosphoacceptor peptide substrate for this assay was 75 μm of the S6 kinase substrate peptide KKRNRTLTK in freshly prepared kinase buffer (13.4 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 25 mm MgCl2, 30 μm Na2VO3, 5 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 2 mm EGTA, 2 μm cAMP-dependent kinase inhibitor TTYADFIASGRTGRRNAIHD, 0.420 μCi [γ-32P]ATP (7 nm), and 68 μm unlabeled ATP). 1 μg of cAMP-dependent kinase inhibitor inhibits 2,000–6,000 phosphorylating units of PKA (equivalent to the transference of 2–6 nmol of phosphate from ATP). To initiate the phosphotransferase reaction, aliquots (20 μl) of kinase buffer containing the appropriate substrates were mixed 1:3 (v/v) with the cell lysates or immunocomplex beads. The reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 20 min in a rotator and terminated by blotting 40 μl of the reaction mixture onto P81 ion exchange chromatography cellulose phosphate papers. Filter squares were washed, dried, and counted for radioactivity. Controls were run in parallel with no S6 kinase substrate peptide. Counts were subtracted from samples. In some experiments, ribosomes were used as the natural p70S6K substrate following the in vitro kinase assay just indicated. Protein S6 is part of a multiprotein-rRNA complex that is multiphosphorylated on Ser residues in vitro in response to mitogenic stimulation. 40 S ribosomal subunits were prepared from Xenopus laevis at the concentration of 0.1–0.25 mg/ml following the procedure described in Ref. 11Price D.J. Grove J.R. Calvo V. Avruch J. Bierer B.E. Science. 1992; 257: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar. Alkaline Phosphatase Treatment—SDS-boiled samples as indicated in the immunoprecipitation and Western blotting analyses section above were diluted with 0.3 ml of cold H2O and 0.4 ml cold, Triton X-100-based, lysis buffer. The alkaline phosphatase enzyme (calf intestine-purified) was added in a 160 μl of total volume of freshly prepared, cold, alkaline phosphatase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm ZnCl2). To initiate the phosphate removal reaction, 48 μl of 3 m Tris-base, pH 12.5 were added to each sample to achieve a favorable reaction pH of 10.0 ± 0.5. Samples were lightly vortexed and incubated at 37 °C for 45 min with slight agitation. The reaction was stopped by placing the samples on an ice bucket and adding to each reaction tube a small volume of 10 m Tris-HCl, pH 3.0 in order to bring the reaction pH to 7.0. Samples were used immediately for immunoprecipitation using anti-p70S6K antibodies, as indicated above. F-actin Measurement by Flow Cytometry—Neutrophils were stained with phalloidin-FITC as described (39Egger G. Burda A. Glasner A. Virchows Arch. 2001; 438: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, F-actin polymerization was initiated in vivo by the addition of GM-CSF to a neutrophil cell suspension (5 × 106 cells/ml) for 5 min at 37 °C. After this, 0.2-ml aliquots were taken and mixed with 1 ml of pre-chilled fixing solution (two parts of double-concentrated phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, one part of 20% formaldehyde and one part of 75% glycerol in water). Samples were stored at –80 °C until ready for flow cytometry. At that time, samples were thawed and spun down for 5 min at 600 × g in a refrigerated Eppendorf microcentrifuge. Pellets were resuspended in freshly prepared F-actin staining solution (35 μlofa3.3 mg/ml methanol FITC-phalloidin stock plus 315 μl of H2O, and stained in the dark for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were centrifuged as above, and pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of FACS FLOW. They were then analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACSCAN Becton & Dickinson flow cytometer at 488 nm excitation wavelength. Data was analyzed using Cell Quest software and expressed as fluorescence intensity. Human Neutrophils Express p70S6K and GM-CSF Increases Its Activity and Phosphorylation Status—We demonstrate here that neutrophils express this protein in sufficient amounts to be clearly detected by immunoblotting using antibodies directed against the ribosomal p70S6K (Fig. 1A). A major band shows the predicted molecular weight for the mammalian S6K1 isoform. We were also able to detect its enzymatic activity in vitro in whole cell lysates and in anti-p70S6K immunoprecipitates. The detection of p70S6K activity is presented in Fig. 1B, with GM-CSF causing a significant and reproducible increase of total S6K activity. Accurate confirmation of ribosomal p70S6K activity is given by the fact that 32P incorporation into the substrate peptide KKRNRTLTK and ribosomal 40 S subunits (containing the natural substrate protein S6), was observed after anti-p70S6K immunoprecipitation. GM-CSF increased basal activity by ∼3-fold in immunocomplexes. The complete biochemical characterization of p70S6K in neutrophils is presented in Fig. 2, A–D. A ∼3-fold activation due to GM-CSF is consistently seen when activity is expressed as a function of time, protein concentration and substrate concentration (Fig. 2, A–C). Moreover, there is a considerable change in V max (from 7.2 to 20.5 pmol/min/mg protein) and also in the K m (from 26.1 to 15.4 μm) by GM-CSF stimulation (Fig. 2D) that makes GM-CSF a bona fide p70S6K physiological stimulator in neutrophils.Fig. 2Biochemical characterization of neutrophil p70S6K. Neutrophils were challenged with GM-CSF and treated as indicated above. The kinase assay was performed against the KKRNRTLTK (p70S6K peptide substrate). Activity was measured as a function of incubation time of the in vitro enzyme assay (A); protein concentration (B), and substrate concentration at 0.5–0.7 mg/ml protein (C). From C, a Lineweaver-Burk plot was derived (D) from which the V max and K m values were calculated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) After protein, activity and kinetic measurements, we next investigated whether GM-CSF was able to induce the phosphorylation of p70S6K in human neutrophils. As seen in Fig. 3A, GM-CSF induces a rapid (3 min) phosphorylation of p70S6K on Thr389, which is one of the residues critical for S6K activation. The migration of the phosphorylated band in SDS gels very well coincides with that of the 3T3 fibroblast controls. Also, GM-CSF induces phosphorylation of p70S6K on two other residues, Thr421/Ser424 (Fig. 3B), that are also key for conferring enzyme activity. The effect is dose-dependent, clearly noticeable with GM-CSF concentration as low as 0.5 nm. Fig. 4 shows that the increase in both phosphorylation and enzyme activity elicited by GM-CSF are time-dependent. A maximum phosphorylation at 3 min is seen for phospho-Thr421/Ser424 (Fig. 4A) as well as for phospho-Thr389 (Fig. 4B). Phosphorylation of Thr389 is seen as an increase in density of the immunoprecipitated p70 band. The Thr421/Ser424 dual phosphorylation is seen at 3–5 min post GM-CSF, and is demonstrated by both a robust increase in density of the immunoprecipitated p70 band and by an upward mobility shift (Fig. 4A). The figure also shows results of immunoprecipitation with anti-p70S6K antibody and immunoblotting with the same antibody to demonstrate equal loading (Fig. 4C). In vitro kinase activity experiments also reveal a time-dependent increase due to GM-CSF (Fig. 4D). Maximal activity is reached at 5 min and declines slightly thereafter, and as such, the biphasic pattern of phosphorylation seen in Fig. 4, A and B correlated with enzymatic activity. Thus, the results presented in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4 demonstrate that p70S6K is expressed in human neutrophils, that GM-CSF increased its enzymatic activity in a time and dose-dependent fashion, changes the V max for its peptide substrate, and that this cytokine induces robust phosphorylation in 3 key residues: Thr389, Thr421, and Ser424. mTOR Is Involved in GM-CSF-activated p70S6K in Neutrophils—The next series of experiments were aimed at investigating what the mechanism that accounts for the observed increases in both phosphorylation and activity, was. Our first approach was the use of the immunosuppressant drug rapamycin, a well known inhibitor of mTOR, one of the several upstream regulators of p70S6K (17Han J.W. Pearson R.B. Dennis P.B. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21396-21403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In neutrophils, rapamycin inhibited GM-CSF-stimulated p70S6K Thr389 phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). The intensity of phospho-Thr389 signal all but disappears at 10 nm. The effect of rapamycin on the dual phosphorylation Thr421/Ser424 was also very profound, but manifested itself differently and warranted close examination. Fig. 6A shows that rapamycin causes a dramatic downward mobility shift in the phospho-Thr421/Ser424 band observed in the presence of GM-CSF. In this study, for the sake of clarification, we have labeled the lower band in GM-CSF + rapamycin as a and the upper band in GM-CSF alone as b. A shift from the upper b to lower a band observed with rapamycin treatment, is consistent with p70S6K dephosphorylation, as a less phosphorylated species runs faster in SDS-PAGE. Also shown in Fig. 6A (to the right) is a representative Western blot of fibroblast lysates to provide yet one more relative mobility comparison. The upper b band in GM-CSF-treated neutrophils has a M r similar to that of serum-treated fibroblasts. Fig. 6A also shows that, in contrast to what was observed with phospho-Thr389 where the intensity signal disappeared with rapamycin + GM-CSF (Fig. 5A), a positive signal is still present to anti-phospho-Thr421/Ser424 antibodies, indicating that phosphorylation of Thr421/Ser424 was not completely affected by rapamycin. To ascertain if the signal to Thr421/Ser424 antibodies still remained simply because there was not enough rapamycin to inhibit it, we analyzed the status of this dual phosphorylation in response to GM-CSF with a range of rapamycin concentrations. Fig. 6B confirms that concentrations of rapamycin as low as 0.5 nm had already increased the mobility of p70S6K, and this ef"
https://openalex.org/W2052962301,"The glycan chain of the S-layer protein of Aneurinibacillus thermoaerophilus L420-91T (DSM 10154) consists of d-rhamnose and 3-acetamido-3,6-dideoxy-d-galactose (d-Fucp3NAc). Thymidine diphosphate-activated d-Fucp3NAc serves as precursor for the assembly of structural polysaccharides in Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. The biosynthesis of dTDP-3-acetamido-3,6-dideoxy-α-d-galactose (dTDP-d-Fucp3NAc) involves five enzymes. The first two steps of the reaction are catalyzed by enzymes that are part of the well studied dTDP-l-rhamnose biosynthetic pathway, namely d-glucose-1-phosphate thymidyltransferase (RmlA) and dTDP-d-glucose-4,6-dehydratase (RmlB). The enzymes catalyzing the last three synthesis reactions have not been characterized biochemically so far. These steps include an isomerase, a transaminase, and a transacetylase. We identified all five genes involved by chromosome walking in the Gram-positive organism A. thermoaerophilus L420-91T and overexpressed the three new enzymes heterologously in Escherichia coli. The activities of these enzymes were monitored by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, and the intermediate products formed were characterized by 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy analysis. Alignment of the newly identified proteins with known sequences revealed that the elucidated pathway in this Gram-positive organism may also be valid in the biosynthesis of the O-antigen of lipopolysaccharides of Gram-negative organisms. The key enzyme in the biosynthesis of dTDP-d-Fucp3NAc has been identified as an isomerase, which converts the 4-keto educt into the 3-keto product, with concomitant epimerization at C-4 to produce a 6-deoxy-d-xylo configuration. This is the first report of the functional characterization of the biosynthesis of dTDP-d-Fucp3NAc and description of a novel type of isomerase capable of synthesizing dTDP-6-deoxy-d-xylohex-3-ulose from dTDP-6-deoxy-d-xylohex-4-ulose.

Sleytr U.B. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 859-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 2Schäffer C. Messner P. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Structurally, S-layer glycoproteins from Gram-positive bacteria resemble O-antigens of LPS of Gram-negative organisms (3Schäffer C. Wugeditsch T. Neuninger C. Messner P. Microb. Drug Resist. 1996; 2: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Usually both macromolecules consist of a glycan chain containing identical repeating units, a core saccharide, and a linkage region, which is bound either to the S-layer protein or, as in LPS, to lipid A. Whereas the biosynthesis of LPS is well characterized (4Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3376) Google Scholar), the exact mechanisms involved in biosynthesis of glycans of bacterial S-layer glycoproteins are still unknown. There is, however, preliminary evidence that both systems follow comparable pathways. For formation of the glycan chains in the cytoplasm in both systems nucleotide-activated sugars serve as precursors in the glycosylation reaction (5Gronow S. Brade H. J. Endotoxin Res. 2001; 7: 3-23PubMed Google Scholar). It is proposed that the pre-assembled glycan chains are transported across the cytoplasmic membrane in a lipid-bound state, either linked to undecaprenol (LPS) (4Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3376) Google Scholar) or dolichol (glycoproteins) (6Hartmann E. Messner P. Allmeier G. König H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4515-4519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although experimentally not yet determined, final transfer of the glycan chains to the nascent S-layer polypeptide is assumed to take place on the outer side of the cytoplasmic membrane, comparable with archaeal S-layers (7Sumper M. Wieland F.T. Montreuil J. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Schachter H. Glycoproteins. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1995: 455-473Google Scholar).

The backbone of each repeating unit is built by four d-rhamnose units, and two of them are substituted by α-1,2-linked d-Fucp3NAc units (10Kosma P. Neuninger C. Christian R. Schulz G. Messner P. Glycoconj. J. 1995; 12: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 11Schäffer C. Müller N. Christian R. Graninger M. Wugeditsch T. Scheberl A. Messner P. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Both constituting sugars are well known components of the LPS of Gram-negative bacteria (12Knirel Y.A. Kochetkov N.K. Biokhimiya. 1994; 59: 1784-1851PubMed Google Scholar, 13Rocchetta H.L. Burrows L.L. Lam J.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 523-553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Vorhölter F.J. Niehaus K. Pühler A. Mol. Genet. Gen. 2001; 266: 79-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Derivatives of d-Fucp3N have also been found in the LPS of clinical strains of Vibrio cholerae (15Hermansson K. Jansson P.E. Holme T. Gustavsson B. Carbohydr. Res. 1993; 248: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and Acinetobacter baumannii (16Haseley S.R. Wilkinson S.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 899-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), where the acetyl group is replaced by modified amino acids and acyl residues, respectively. Recently, we were able to characterize the biosynthesis of the GDP-d-rhamnose, one of the sugar components of the glycan chain of A. thermoaerophilus L420-91T (17Kneidinger B. Graninger M. Adam G. Puchberger M. Kosma P. Zayni S. Messner P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5577-5583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The other constituent, d-Fucp3NAc, was first described in cell-free extracts of Xanthomonas campestris by Volk and Ashwell (18Volk W.A. Ashwell G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1963; 12: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). They proposed that d-glucose will eventually be converted into dTDP-d-Fucp3NAc by amidation with l-glutamate and pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP) as co-factor followed by acetylation with acetyl-CoA (18Volk W.A. Ashwell G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1963; 12: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This proposal was further substantiated by Shibaev (19Shibaev V.N. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1986; 44: 277-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), who proposed a model for the biosynthesis of nucleotide-activated d-Fucp3NAc. Two of the enzymes presumably involved in dTDP-d-Fucp3NAc biosynthesis were first identified in the dTDP-l-rhamnose pathway (for review, see Ref. 20Giraud M.-F. Naismith J.H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). These are glucose-1-phosphate thymidyltransferase (RmlA) and dTDP-d-glucose-4,6-dehydratase (RmlB), which catalyze the reaction of glucose 1-phosphate and thymidine triphosphate to dTDP-d-glucose and in the second step to dTDP-6-deoxy-d-xylohex-4-ulose. This latter compound serves as substrate for a series of reactions, including the formation of dTDP-d-Fucp3NAc (21Stein A. Kula M.R. Elling L. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Activities of RmlA and RmlB in crude extracts of A. thermoaerophilus L420-91T indicated a possible involvement of these two enzymes in the biosynthesis of dTDP-d-Fucp3NAc (22Graninger M. Kneidinger B. Bruno K. Scheberl A. Messner P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 3708-3715Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Recently, the gene cluster responsible for LPS biosynthesis of X. campestris has been identified (14Vorhölter F.J. Niehaus K. Pühler A. Mol. Genet. Gen. 2001; 266: 79-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Downstream of the dTDP-l-rhamnose genes the authors described a cluster of 15 genes to be involved in the biosynthesis of the LPS glycan chain of X. campestris. Two genes of the cluster, namely wxcM and wxcK, were assumed to code for enzymes that synthesize dTDP-d-Fucp3NAc. WxcM was proposed to be bifunctional and to catalyze both the isomerization and the transacetylation reaction. The second ORF, WxcK, was assumed to be responsible for the transamination reaction. So far none of the described genes has been functionally expressed nor have the gene products been biochemically characterized. This report is the first functional characterization of the biosynthesis pathway of dTDP-d-Fucp3NAc in the S-layer glycoprotein glycan of the Gram-positive thermophile A. thermoaerophilus L420-91T. We could show that five enzymes, including a novel type of isomerase, are involved in the biosynthesis of this nucleotide-activated precursor of d-Fucp3NAc. Materials—dTDP-d-glucose, l-glutamate, acetyl-CoA, SH-CoA, 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (Ellman′s reagent) were from Sigma. GSTrap, HiTrap chelating, Mono Q HR5/5, and Sephadex G-10 columns were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. All primers used in these studies were synthesized by Invitrogen. Glutathione (reduced form) and imidazole were purchased from ICN Chemicals (Eschwege, Germany). Bacterial Strains and Culture Conditions—A. thermoaerophilus L420-91T was grown in SVIII media at 55 °C (10Kosma P. Neuninger C. Christian R. Schulz G. Messner P. Glycoconj. J. 1995; 12: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli DH5α (K-12 F– Φ80d lacZΔM15 endA1 recA1 hsdR17 (r K– m K–) supE44 thi-1 gyrA96 relA1 Δ(lacZYA-argF) U169) (Invitrogen) was used for cloning purposes. Enzyme overexpression was performed in E. coli BL21(DE3) (F– ompT hsdS B (rB– mB–) gal dcm (DE3)). For selective growth ampicillin (Sigma) and kanamycin (Invitrogen) were used at a concentration of 50 μg/ml. DNA Manipulations, Polymerase Chain Reaction, and Gene Identification—All standard DNA manipulation and transformation procedures were performed according to the methods described by Sambrook and Russell (23Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) or according to the protocols recommended by the specific manufacturers. The gene cluster was identified by chromosome walking as described previously (24Kneidinger B. Graninger M. Messner P. Biotechniques. 2001; 30: 248-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, restriction cuts of chromosomal DNA of A. thermoaerophilus L420-91T were ligated into pBluescript II SK(+) from Stratagene (Amsterdam, The Netherlands), and PCR was performed with forward primers of the known sequences and reverse primers of the plasmid. Primers were designed with attB1 and attB2 sites for the insertion into the Gateway™ vector pDonr201 (Invitrogen). E. coli DH5α was transformed with the vectors by electroporation with a Gene Pulser apparatus (Bio-Rad). The vectors were prepared with a Miniprep kit of Qiagen (Hilden, Germany) and sequenced by AGOWA GmbH (Berlin, Germany). PCR was performed with a PCR Sprint thermocylcer from Hybaid (Ashford, UK). The nucleotide sequences were analyzed by the sequence analysis program OMIGA™ (Accelrys, Unterhaching-München, Germany). Homology searches and sequence aligments were performed with the BLAST tool at NCBI (25Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70663) Google Scholar) and Multialin (26Corpet F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10881-10890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4311) Google Scholar), respectively. Plasmid Construction—From the data obtained by DNA sequencing, the open reading frames of interest were amplified by PCR. The primers used in these reactions were designed with attB1 and attB2 for the insertion into the vectors of the GATEWAY™ system (Invitrogen). The following primers were employed: gFdtA_for1, 5′-attB1-GCATGGAAAATAAAGTTATTAACTTCAAGAA-3′; gFdtA_rev1, 5′-attB2-CTCTACAATTGCGTTAGGGTG-3′; gFdtB_for1, 5′-attB1-GCATGATTCCTTTTTTGGATTTA-3′; gFdtB_rev1, 5′-attB2-CAAATTTTGCAACCTTGG-3′; gFdtC_for1, 5′-attB1-GCATGTCTAGTTCTAGTGAAACTT-3′; gFdtC_ rev1, 5′-attB2-AAAAGGAATCATCATACCCCA-3′. PCR fragments flanked by the attB1 and attB2 sites can be directionally recombined into pDonr201 in one simple step and subsequently selected for. The positive clones obtained were used to insert the genes into the expression vectors pDest15 for GST fusions or pDest17 for (His)6 fusions. For plasmid propagation E. coli DH5α was used. The expression vectors gFdtA, gFdtB, and gFdtC were finally transformed by electroporation into E. coli BL21(DE3). The exact protocol for these procedures was obtained directly from the manufacturer. All plasmid constructs were sequenced for sequence verification. Overexpression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Cells carrying the plasmids gFdtA, gFdtB, and gFdtC were grown in 0.7 liters of culture volumes of Luria Bertani medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.6. Expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. The cells were harvested, washed in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and resuspended in 10 ml of the same buffer. Cells were lysed on ice by ultrasonication, and cell debris was removed by ultracentrifugation at 331,000 × g. Protein purification was performed as recommended by the manufacturer by applying the supernatant either to a HiTrap chelating column using Ni2+ as the metal ion or a GSTrap column, dependent on the tag used. After dialysis against 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.7, the enzymes were further purified by anion exchange chromatography on a Mono Q HR 5/5 column with 0.5 m KCl as the eluent. Fractions containing the enzymes, as determined by SDS-PAGE (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207180) Google Scholar), were concentrated with centrifugal filter devices Ultrafree-MC (cutoff 10,000 Da; Millipore, Vienna, Austria) and stored at 4 °C or –20 °C. In both cases 50% glycerol and 1 mm 1,4-dithio-dl-threitol were used as stabilizers. Protein concentrations were determined according to Bradford (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216261) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad). Enzyme Assays and Substrate Synthesis—All standard assays for the determination of enzyme functions contained either 50 nmol of dTDP-6-deoxy-d-xylohex-4-ulose or dTDP-d-Fucp3N and were performed in 50 mm K2HPO4 buffer, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm MgCl2. The assay for the conversion of dTDP-6-deoxy-d-xylohex-4-ulose to dTDP-d-Fucp3N contained 5 nmol of FdtB, 5 nmol PLP, and 50 nmol of l-glutamate and was performed with and without the addition of FdtA. To test the function of the transacetylase 5 nmol of FdtC was incubated with 50 nmol of acetyl-CoA and 50 nmol of dTDP-d-Fucp3N. All assays were performed at 37 °C and analyzed by reverse phase (RP)-HPLC with 0.5 m NaH2PO4 solution buffer, pH 6.0, as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min (29Tonetti M. Sturla L. Bisso A. Benatti U. De Flora A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27274-27279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The eluate was monitored with a UV detector at 254 nm. Approximately 50 mg of dTDP-6-deoxy-d-xylohex-4-ulose were synthesized as described previously (30Graninger M. Nidetzky B. Heinrichs D.E. Whitfield C. Messner P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25069-25077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To synthesize dTDP-d-Fucp3N, 20 μmol of dTDP-6-deoxy-d-xylohex-4-ulose, 1 μmol of PLP, 50 μmol of l-glutamate, 200 nmol of FdtA, and 200 nmol of FdtB were incubated in 5 ml of 50 mm K2HPO4 buffer, pH 7.4, and 5 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C for 1 h. The volume was reduced by vacuum evaporation to approximately 1 ml, and the material was purified by RP-HPLC with 0.2 m triethylammonium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, as the mobile phase. To remove the HPLC buffer the solution containing dTDP-d-Fucp3N was frozen and lyophilized. An overall yield of 80% of dTDP-d-Fucp3N could be achieved. Kinetic Measurements—To determine the kinetic constants of FdtC the reaction between the free sulfhydryl group of SH-CoA, a reaction product during the transacetylation, and Ellman's reagent (5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (31Bock A.K. Glasemacher J. Schmidt R. Schönheit P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1861-1867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was measured continuously as the increase in absorbance at 412 nm on a Hitachi U-2010 (Maidenhead, UK) spectrophotometer. The resulting enzymatic activities were calculated with a molar absorption coefficient of 14,150 m–1 cm–1 according to the instructions of the manufacturer. A standard assay was performed in a 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid, 25–200 μm dTDP-d-Fucp3N, 600 μm acetyl-CoA, and 3 nm FdtC. To determine kinetic constants for acetyl-CoA the same assay was used, but the acetyl-CoA concentration was varied from 25 to 200 μm, and the dTDP-d-Fucp3N concentration was kept constant at 600 μm. To obtain the apparent Michaelis constant, K m, kinetic data were fitted directly to the Michaelis-Menten equation by using the program Sigma Plot (SPSS Science, Chicago, IL). V max and the final enzyme concentration E were used to determine the turnover number k cat of the substrates employed (30Graninger M. Nidetzky B. Heinrichs D.E. Whitfield C. Messner P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25069-25077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). NMR Measurements—Spectra were recorded at 300 K at 300.13 MHz for 1H and at 75.47 MHz for 13C with a Bruker AVANCE 300 spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm quadrupole nuclear probe head with z gradients. Data acquisition and processing were performed with the standard XWINNMR software (Bruker). 1H spectra were referenced to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid (δ = 0), 13C spectra were referenced externally to 1,4-dioxane (δ = 67.40), and 31P spectra were recorded at 121.50 MHz and referenced externally to H3PO4 (δ = 0). 1H/13C and 1H/31P heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence spectra and 1H/13C heteronuclear multiple bond correlation spectra were recorded in the phase-sensitive mode using time-proportional phase increments and pulsed field gradients for coherence selection. Spectra resulted from a 256 × 4096 data matrix, with 1800 or 800 scans per t1 value, respectively. For in situ experiments of the isomerase reaction, two samples containing dTDP-6-deoxy-d-xylohex-4-ulose (9 mg) in 20 mm K2HPO4 buffer (in 0.6 ml of D2O, pH 7.4) were simultaneously prepared and kept at 310 K. After adding FdtA (0.113 mg) and mixing in the NMR vial, NMR measurements were immediately started and recorded at distinct time intervals. To disprove a bifunctional activity of FdtB, the same experiment was performed with the transaminase. Briefly, 0.1 mg of FdtB was incubated with dTDP-6-deoxy-d-xylohex-4-ulose (9 mg) in phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 310 K. Identification of the Genes Involved in the Biosynthesis of dTDP-d-Fucp3NAc—Previously we reported cloning and characterization of the two genes that are responsible for the formation of GDP-d-rhamnose from GDP-d-mannose in A. thermoaerophilus L420-91T (17Kneidinger B. Graninger M. Adam G. Puchberger M. Kosma P. Zayni S. Messner P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5577-5583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Assuming that the genes for the biosynthesis of the nucleotide-activated precursors of the glycan chain are clustered, we used chromosome walking to locate the genomic region for the biosynthesis of dTDP-d-Fucp3NAc (24Kneidinger B. Graninger M. Messner P. Biotechniques. 2001; 30: 248-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Approximately 9 kilobases downstream of the rmd gene, which encodes an enzyme involved in the formation of GDP-d-rhamnose (17Kneidinger B. Graninger M. Adam G. Puchberger M. Kosma P. Zayni S. Messner P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5577-5583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), two overlapping PCR fragments (2 and 3.5 kilobases) were obtained. Subsequent sequencing of both fragments revealed a genomic region containing seven ORFs (Fig. 1; GenBank™ accession number AY205257). Using BLAST searches, the first ORF of that region, consisting of 139 amino acids, showed homologies to a putative bifunctional enzyme of X. campestris, namely WxcM. Its C terminus is predicted to code for an isomerase and the N terminus for a transacetylase (14Vorhölter F.J. Niehaus K. Pühler A. Mol. Genet. Gen. 2001; 266: 79-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The putative isomerase presumably responsible for the conversion of dTDP-6-deoxy-d-xylohex-4-ulose into nucleotide-linked hex-3-ulose isomer showed in addition to homologies to the X. campestris gene (AF204145), homologies to genes from Campylobacter jejuni (AF343914), Thermosynechococcus elongatus (AP005373), Listonella anguillarum (AF025396), Leptospira interrogans (AF316500), Leptospira borgpetersenii (AF078135), Streptomyces fradiae (U08223), Bacteroides fragilis (AF125164) and E. coli O91 (AY035396). With the exception of X. campestris, the presence of d-Fucp3N (either acetylated or acylated) has not been reported in the LPS or lipooligosaccharides of the Gram-negative representatives. S. fradiae, however, is a Gram-positive organism without LPS in the cell envelope. Interestingly, for E. coli O91 as well as for S. fradiae, the gluco epimer of d-Fucp3N, 3-acetamido-3,6-dideoxy-d-glucose (d-Quip3N), was found to be part of either the repeating units of LPS O-antigens or of the antibiotic tylosin (32Merson-Davies L.A. Cundliffe E. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The second ORF (192 amino acids) was predicted to code for an acyl-/acetyltransferase. A BLAST search revealed high homologies to several acyl- and acetyltransferases that are involved in the metabolism of nucleotide-activated sugar precursors. The third ORF (363 amino acids) showed high similarities to genes of the DegT/DnrJ/EryC1/StrS family of aminotransferases. Highest homologies were achieved with sequences from organisms that possess genes similar to the putative isomerase FdtA (Table I). The presence of all three enzymes in these organisms would thus indicate the possible occurrence of modified d-Fucp3N residues in the cell envelope or metabolite glycan structures. Downstream of the transaminase two unidentified ORFs showed weak similarities to glycosyl transferases and a putative integral membrane protein. The role of these two genes was not the subject of this study. Sequence alignment of the last two ORFs of the gene cluster showed high similarity to glucose-1-phosphate thymidyltransferase (RmlA) and dTDP-d-glucose dehydratase (RmlB). These two enzymes are known to be involved in the well characterized biosynthesis of nucleotide-activated l-rhamnose of LPS (20Giraud M.-F. Naismith J.H. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 3708-3715Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). They synthesize the precursors for the biosynthesis of e.g. dTDP-d-fucose (34Yoshida Y. Nakano Y. Nezu T.

None of the encoded proteins possesses membrane-spanning domains or signal peptides for secretion, implying that the biosynthesis of this nucleotide-activated sugar occurs in the cytoplasm.Table IHomologs of putative proteins involved in biosynthesis of derivatives of dTDP-d-Fucp3N or dTDP-d-Quip3NOrganismaX., Xanthomonas; C., Campylobacter; T., Thermosynechococcus; Li., Listonella; Le., Leptospira; S., Streptomyces; B., Bacteroides; E., Escherichia.Identity/similarity (accession No.)FdtA (AAO06351)FdtB (AAO06353)FdtC (AAO06352)%X. campestris37/59 (AAK53472)41/56 (AAK53470)61/77 (AAK53472)C. jejuni55/73 (AAK12959)66/77 (AAK12954)62/78 (AAK12958)T. elongatus50/66 (BAC08895)58/74 (BAC08896)58/79 (BAC08894)Li. anguillarum57/74 (AAB81630)62/80 (AAB81632)59/74 (AAB81631)Le. interrogans50/67 (AAK19911)53/69 (AAD528182)Le. borgpetersenii48/66 (AAD12964)53/70 (AAD12965)S. fradiae35/52 (U08223)48/63 (Q54142)B. fragilis39/60 (AAD56739)58/72 (AAD56740)29/47 (AAD56747)E. coli50/67 (AAK60451)52/72 (AAK60453)a X., Xanthomonas; C., Campylobacter; T., Thermosynechococcus; Li., Listonella; Le., Leptospira; S., Streptomyces; B., Bacteroides; E., Escherichia.

To confirm the function proposed for the three enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of dTDP-d-Fucp3NAc they were heterologously overexpressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography and anion exchange chromatography. To overcome problems with protein stability, FdtA and FdtC were expressed with a GST tag and purified using GSTrap columns. In addition, FdtA was also expressed as N-terminal (His)6-tagged fusion protein as was FdtB. Both recombinant proteins could be highly purified on a HiTrap chelating column (Ni2+). To improve the purity of the enzymes an anion exchange chromatography step on a Mono Q column was applied subsequently. Expression and purification was monitored by SD"
https://openalex.org/W1972210156,"The acidic food vacuole of Plasmodium falciparum has been the subject of intense scientific investigation in the 40 years since its role in the digestion of host hemoglobin was first suggested. This proposed role has important implications for the complex host-parasite inter-relationship and also for the mode of action of several of the most effective antimalarial drugs. In addition, adaptive changes in the physiology of this organelle are implicated in drug resistance. Here we show that in addition to these functions, the digestive food vacuole of the malaria parasite is a dynamic internal store for free Ca2+, a role hitherto unsuspected. With the aid of live-cell laser scanning confocal imaging, spatiotemporal studies revealed that maintenance of elevated free Ca2+ in the digestive food vacuole (relative to cytosolic levels) is achieved by a thapsigargin (and cyclopiazonic acid)-sensitive Ca2+-pump in cooperation with a H+-dependent Ca2+ transporter. Redistribution of free cytosolic and vacuolar Ca2+ during parasite growth also suggests that vacuolar Ca2+ plays an essential role in parasite morphogenesis. These data imply that the digestive food vacuole of the malaria parasite is functionally akin to the vacuole of plants (tonoplast) and the small electron-dense granules of some parasites (acidocalcisomes) whereby H+-coupled Ca2+ transport is involved in ion transport, Ca2+ homeostasis, and signal transduction.

Malaria remains one of the largest global health (and economic) problems, resulting in more than a million deaths, mostly in young African children (1World Health OrganizationRoll Back Malaria. World Health Organization, Geneva2002Google Scholar). With this in mind, it is astonishing how little is known about the basic physiology of the intraerythrocytic malaria parasite and its organelles. The food vacuole is a major digestive organelle of the malaria parasite and a proven chemotherapeutic target. This organelle has a role in degradation of host-derived hemoglobin, is the site of action of important classes of antimalarials, and harbors transporters associated with drug resistance (2Rudzinska M.A. Bray R.S.

Hydrolysis of hemoglobin in the malaria parasite digestive food vacuole occurs by the integrated action of aspartic, cysteine, and metalloproteases (5Coombs G.H. Goldberg D.E. Klemba M. Berry C.

(6Francis S.E. Sullivan D.J. Goldberg D.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 97-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). The internal pH of the digestive food vacuole is lower than the parasite cytosol, although the precise pH value is under debate (7Spiller D.G. Bray P.G. Hughes R.H. Ward S.A. White M.R. Trends Parasitol. 2002; 10: 441-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In collaboration with Prof. Kiaran Kirk's laboratory (8Saliba K.J. Allen R.J. Zissis S. Bray P.G. Ward S.A. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5605-5612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), we have recently described the function of two H+-pumping mechanisms in the digestive food vacuole; one is a bafilomycin-sensitive V-type H+-ATPase, and the other is a NaF-sensitive H+-pyrophosphatase showing a partial dependence on K+. The combination of a H+-ATPase and a H+-pyrophosphatase acting in the digestive vacuole is analogous to the situation in acidic tonoplasts of plant cells (9Sze H. Li X. Palmgren M.G. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 677-690PubMed Google Scholar) and of the acidocalcisome of some protozoa (10Docampo R. Moreno S.N.J. Parasitol. Today. 1999; 15: 443-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). It should be noted that although there may be similarities with acidocalcisomes (which are small electron-dense granules/organelles that store Ca2+ as a phosphate precipitate) and the malarial parasite food vacuole, they are morphologically (and functionally, with regards to hemoglobin digestion) very distinct. Based on the known H+-coupled Ca2+ transport in these nonmalarial organelles, we hypothesized that an analogous coupled pathway would be present in the malaria parasite digestive food vacuole, thereby contributing to cellular Ca2+ trafficking and storage. By using live-cell confocal laser scanning microscopy and a judicious choice of Ca2+ probes, we have uncovered a novel function for this unique organelle. We show that the food vacuole of the malaria parasite is involved in dynamic Ca2+ storage. Evidence is presented showing that Ca2+ storage by the digestive food vacuole is linked directly to parasite cell signaling and asexual development. This novel discovery raises many new questions about the functions, physiology, and regulation of this critical malarial parasite organelle. As the target for the actions of a number of drugs, the requirement for tightly regulated Ca2+ movement and storage within this organelle may represent a new chemotherapeutic target. Parasite Culture—Plasmodium falciparum TM6 strain was kindly provided by Dr. P. Tan-Ariya (Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand) and maintained in continuous culture. Cultures contained a 2% suspension of O+ erythrocytes in RPMI 1640 (R8758) medium supplemented with 10% pooled human AB serum, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and 20 μm gentamicin sulfate (11Trager W. Jenson J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6040) Google Scholar). Effect of FPIX on the Fluorescence Quantum Yield of Ca2 + Indicators—Fluorescence emission spectra for pentapotassium salts (1 μm) of Fura-2 (excitation 340 nm) and Fluo-4 (excitation 488 nm) in 39 μm free Ca2+ buffer (10 mm CaEGTA in 100 mm KCl, 30 mm MOPS, pH 7.2) with 0, 10, 20, and 50 μm ferriprotoporphyrin IX was performed in a Shimadzu RF-5001PC spectrofluorophotometer. Real Time Ca2 + Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy—For experimentation, suspensions (1%) of infected erythrocytes in HEPES-buffered RPMI medium (no serum) were loaded with Fluo-4/AM (3 μm, Molecular Probes BV) for 20 min at 37 °C. For imaging, malaria parasite-infected erythrocytes were immobilized using polylysine-coated coverslips in a Bioptechs FCS2 perfusion chamber and maintained at 37 °C in growth medium (no serum). Inhibitors were added to the perfusate, and the Ca2+-dependent fluorescence responses were monitored in real time. Fluorescence signals from Fluo-4 were collected on a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope through a Plan-Apochromat 63× 1.4 N.A. oil objective using the “tracking mode.” Excitation of Fluo-4 was performed using an argon ion laser at 488 nm. Emitted light was reflected through a 505–550-nm band pass filter from a 540-nm dichroic mirror. Photobleaching (the irreversible damage of Fluo-4/AM producing a less fluorescent species) was assessed by continuous exposure (5 min) of loaded cells to laser illumination. For each experiment, the laser illumination setting that gave a minimal reduction in cytosolic and food vacuole fluorescence was used (this varied according to dye loading and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) settings). Data capture and extraction was carried out with LSM510 version 3 software (Zeiss). Cytosolic and vacuolar [Ca2+] was calibrated in situ by the addition of known amounts of [Ca2+]free in the presence of nigericin (0.8 μm) and the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (1 μm). Using Calcium Calibration Buffer Kit 1 solutions (Molecular Probes), the [Ca2+]free was calculated from the K d of EGTA for Ca2+ (107.9 nm at 37 °C (12Tsien R. Pozzan T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 230-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar)) using the equation [Ca2+]free = K dEGTA × [CaEGTA/K2EGTA]. Effect of FPIX on the Fluorescence Quantum Yield of Ca2 + Indicators—Heme (FPIX) is a major component of the digestive food vacuole of P. falciparum. As the fluorescence quantum yield of some food vacuole targeted probes can be reduced dramatically by heme (FPIX), we decided to test the effect of monomeric heme E on a number of Ca2+-specific UV- and visible light-excitable fluorescent probes. Titration of FPIX to solutions of Fura-2 or Fluo-4 resulted in a progressive reduction of fluorescence signal (Fig. 1). However, this reduction was more pronounced in the case of the UV-excitable probe (e.g. Fura-2) than for visible light-excitable probes (e.g. Fluo-4 and Fluo-3 (not shown)); Fluo-4 retained ∼60% of its fluorescent emission signal at FPIX levels, which eliminated the Fura-2 signal. Fluo-4 was therefore used as the probe of choice to measure cytosolic and food vacuole Ca2+ fluctuations. The Digestive Food Vacuole of P. falciparum Contains Elevated Free Ca2 + —With the use of CLSM and the cell-permeant AM ester of Fluo-4 to probe for Ca2+ in trophozoites of infected red blood cells, we observed a strong fluorescence signal deriving from the digestive food vacuole (e.g. Fig. 3e). Some Ca2+ indicators have a tendency to compartmentalize, and differences in apparent Ca2+ affinities in different compartments/organelles within a cell can sometimes lead to the formation of artifactual Ca2+ gradients (13Thomas D. Tovey S.C. Collins T.J. Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Cell Calcium. 2000; 28: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). To overcome these possible artifacts, free Ca2+ was calibrated independently in situ in both the parasite cytosolic and food vacuole compartments (Fig. 2). The differing slopes (and fluorescence quantum yields in response to Ca2+) of the parasite cytosol and food vacuole calibration curves revealed that there was a difference in the respective apparent Ca2+ binding affinities, probably resulting from differences in the Ca2+ buffering capacity of the different intracellular milieus and possibly from a degree of dye compartmentalization. However, taking into account the differences in Fluo-4 Ca2+ affinities (by using the respective in situ calibration curves), the digestive food vacuole was measured nevertheless as having elevated free Ca2+ relative to the cytosol, with levels ranging between 250 and 300 nm (n = 27), some 5 to 6 times higher than the cytosol (measured at ∼50 nm, n = 27).Fig. 2Cytosol (•) and digestive food vacuole (○) in situ free Ca2+ calibration of Fluo-4/AM-loaded P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes. Data points represent the mean ± S.E. of ≥19 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Intracellular Distribution of Free Ca2 + during the Intraerythrocytic Development of the Malaria Parasite—The distribution of free Ca2+ in the malaria parasite was observed to change during asexual development. As described, early trophozoites were observed as having a Ca2+ gradient between the digestive food vacuole and cytoplasmic compartments (Fig. 3e). However, as parasites underwent schizogony, free Ca2+ was observed to leave the digestive food vacuole and move to the intermembrane space surrounding each segment (Fig. 3, f and g). On rupture and release of merozoites from the erythrocytic host, there was a sustained elevation in free Ca2+; however the resolution of the CLSM did not allow us to determine the specific intracellular distribution of the signal (Fig. 3h). This increase was lost shortly after reinvasion of new red blood cells (i.e. the early ring stage), which may imply an important role for elevated merozoite free Ca2+ in the invasion process. Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Free Ca2 + in the Malaria Parasite and Digestive Food Vacuole—Fluo-4/AM is a BAPTA (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid)-based indicator with a large dynamic range (R f ≈ 50–200 (14Maravall M. Mainen Z.F. Sabatini B.L. Svoboda K. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2655-2667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar)), making it very suitable for the monitoring of both elementary and global Ca2+ signals (13Thomas D. Tovey S.C. Collins T.J. Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Cell Calcium. 2000; 28: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Using this indicator, we were able to determine spatiotemporal Ca2+ fluctuations in malaria parasite-infected erythrocytes that were immobilized using polylysine coated coverslips in a Bioptechs FCS2 perfusion chamber, in response to a variety of inhibitors and agents. As described, trophozoites were shown to posses elevated Ca2+ in the digestive vacuoles (Fig. 3e). The addition of thapsigargin (a plant sesquiterpene lactone that interacts irreversibly with sarcoplasmic reticulum-like Ca2+ ATPases (15Sagara Y. Wade J.B. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1286-1292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) to trophozoites caused a rapid depletion of vacuolar Ca2+ (Figs. 4A (and Fig. 4B, QuickTime movie) and 5A). The addition of cyclopiazonic acid, another known selective irreversible inhibitor of sarcoplasmic reticulum-like Ca2+-ATPases (16Goeger D.E. Riley R.T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 3995-4003Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), also caused a rapid reduction in vacuolar free Ca2+ (Figs. 4C (and Fig. 4D, QuickTime movie) and 5B). Unlike the case of thapsigargin, however, the reduction of food vacuolar Ca2+ upon addition of cyclopiazonic acid was accompanied by a conspicuous transient increase in cytosolic Ca2+. Maneuvers that caused a perturbation of the trans-vacuolar membrane pH gradient (the food vacuole is acidic relative to the cytosol), such as the addition of the selective V-type ATPase inhibitor, bafilomycin A1 (Fig. 5C), and of NH4Cl (QuickTime movie, Figs. 4E and 5C) to the perfusate, also caused a rapid reduction of vacuolar Ca2+. A transient rise in cytosolic Ca2+ was also evident upon addition of NH4Cl to the perfusate (Fig. 5C). The membrane integrity of the digestive food vacuole was maintained on the addition of the irreversible inhibitors thapsigargin, cyclopiazonic acid, and bafilomycin A1 (see QuickTime movies, Fig. 4, B, D, and E) and the malaria pigment crystals were observed to continue to move inside the vacuoles. Washing infected erythrocytes with HEPES-buffered RPMI (pH 7.4) or Ringer solution after treatment with NH4Cl restored the food vacuole Ca2+ gradient of the cells (data not shown).Fig. 5Effect of thapsigargin (1 μm) (A), cyclopiazonic acid (10 μm) (B), NH4Cl (80 mm) (C), and bafilomycin A1 (200 nm) (D) on the concentration of free Ca2+ in the malaria parasite cytosol (○) and digestive food vacuole (•).

(n ≥ 5).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As the digestive food vacuole of the malaria parasite contains a P-glycoprotein pump (PGH1), which can affect the compartmentalization of some fluorescence indicators, verapamil, a known PGH1 modulator (17Reed M.B. Saliba K.J. Caruana S.R. Kirk K. Cowman A.F. Nature. 2000; 403: 906-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar), was added to the perfusate of the single cell chamber system. Verapamil (10 μm) was not shown to effect any change in the fluorescence signal deriving from either the food vacuole or the cytoplasm, suggesting that there was no interference from PGH1 in our system. It has been suggested previously that the malaria parasite contains an acidic Ca2+ storage organelle (18Garcia C.R. Ann S.E. Tavares E.S. Dluzewski A.R. Mason W.T. Paiva F.B. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 19Marchesini N. Luo S. Rodrigues C.O. Moreno S.N. Docampo R. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 20Alleva L. Kirk K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 117: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, negative staining of the digestive vacuole by UV-excitable Ca2+ fluorescent probes precluded its involvement (20Alleva L. Kirk K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 117: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We have shown recently that FPIX can interact with fluorescent probes such as acridine orange, resulting in a dramatic reduction in fluorescent emission, probably occurring from the absorption by the FPIX Soret peak (21Bray P.G. Saliba K.J. Davies J.D. Spiller D.G. White M.R. Kirk K. Ward S.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 119: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether the fluorescent emission of previously used UV-excitable Ca2+-specific probes such as Fura2 (19Marchesini N. Luo S. Rodrigues C.O. Moreno S.N. Docampo R. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 20Alleva L. Kirk K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 117: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) as well as a range of visible light-excitable Ca2+ probes were also affected by FPIX. Titration of FPIX to solutions of Fura-2 or Fluo-4 resulted in a progressive reduction of fluorescence signal (Fig. 1). However, this reduction was more pronounced in the case of Fura-2 than Fluo-4, which retained ∼60% of its original fluorescent emission signal at FPIX levels that eliminated the Fura-2 signal. Importantly, the probe remained Ca2+-sensitive within this organelle, albeit with an altered apparent Ca2+ affinity (Fig. 2). FPIX is reported to achieve mm concentrations in the food vacuole (22Loria P. Miller S. Foley M. Tilley L. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), which would fully explain the lack of food vacuole-derived Fura-2 fluorescence reported by other investigators. With the use of CLSM and Fluo-4/AM (which is less susceptible to FPIX fluorescence quenching and has a good dynamic range) to probe for Ca2+ in mature trophozoites of infected red blood cells, we observed a free Ca2+ pool in the digestive food vacuole (Fig 3e) generating a Ca2+ gradient some 5–6-fold greater than that measured in the cytoplasm (at rest). It was clearly observed that the sequestration of free Ca2+ altered during the asexual intraerythrocytic development of the malaria parasite (Fig 3). For example, as parasites underwent schizogony, free Ca2+ was observed to leave the digestive food vacuole and move to the intermembrane space surrounding each segment (Fig. 3, f and g) producing “wagon wheel”-looking Ca2+ distributions. It has been accepted for more than 20 years that Ca2+ in the culture medium is essential for the complete asexual development of the malaria parasite in red blood cells in culture (23Wasserman M. Alarcon C. Mendoza P.M. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1982; 31: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The results presented here lend further support to a role for Ca2+-dependent processes in the asexual development of the parasite. Our findings showing Ca2+ storage by the digestive food vacuole have allowed us to shed light on a recent controversy relating to the pharmacology of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPases of P. falciparum. A recent study demonstrated that the malaria parasite contains an endoplasmic reticulum-like Ca2+ store that is controlled by a thapsigargin-insensitive but cyclopiazonic acid-sensitive Ca2+-pump (20Alleva L. Kirk K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 117: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), a finding that was at odds with previous studies indicating a thapsigargin-sensitive mechanism (19Marchesini N. Luo S. Rodrigues C.O. Moreno S.N. Docampo R. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 24Garcia C.R. Dluzewski A.R. Catalani L.H. Burting R. Hoyland J. Mason W.T. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 71: 409-413PubMed Google Scholar). It is now apparent that both of these studies adopted methods that were ineffective for the measurement of vacuolar Ca2+ and therefore that their fluorescence signals originated from cytosolic Ca2+ fluctuations. Using our live cell CLSM system to monitor Fluo-4-loaded infected red blood cells, we observed that upon addition of thapsigargin (1 μm) or cyclopiazonic acid (10 μm) to the perfusate, Ca2+ from the digestive food vacuole was rapidly (∼60 s) released (Fig. 4, A and C, and Fig. 5, A and B (QuickTime movies, Fig. 4, B and D)). In the case of cyclopiazonic acid (but undetectable for thapsigargin), the vacuolar release of Ca2+ was accompanied by a small transient increase in cytosolic Ca2+ (Figs. 4C and 5B). These results help explain previous observations of transient elevations of Ca2+ upon addition of cyclopiazonic acid (20Alleva L. Kirk K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 117: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In addition these results suggest the operation of more than one P-type Ca2+ ATPase, one that is sensitive to both thapsigargin and cyclopiazonic acid and one that is only sensitive to cyclopiazonic acid. Significantly, and in support of our findings, the recent functional characterization of P. falciparum transporters expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes have revealed the presence of both a cyclopiazonic-sensitive Ca2+-ATPase (PfATPase4 (25Krishna S. Woodrow C. Webb R. Penny J. Takeyasu K. Kimura M. East J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10782-10787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar)) and a thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+-ATPase (PfATPase6). 2S. Krishna, personal communication. At this early stage in the pharmacological analysis of intracellular Ca2+ signaling in the malaria parasite, however, it should be noted that thapsigargin and cyclopiazonic acid have previously been shown to have different additional nonselective effects on Ca2+ signaling pathway components, e.g. capacitative Ca2+ entry (26Taylor C.W. Broad L.S. Trends Pharmacol Sci. 1998; 19: 370-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, it is unlikely that capacitative Ca2+ entry is responsible for the observed increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ on treatment with cyclopiazonic acid, as this effect was observed by Alleva and Kirk (20Alleva L. Kirk K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 117: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) to occur in freed P. falciparum parasites suspended in Ca2+-free solutions. The generation of a H+-gradient across the parasite vacuolar membrane by the action of V-type H+ ATPases and H+-pumping pyrophosphatases (8Saliba K.J. Allen R.J. Zissis S. Bray P.G. Ward S.A. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5605-5612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) suggests that, as with plant tonoplasts and acidocalcisomes of some parasites, the digestive food vacuole of the malaria parasite may also drive Ca2+ accumulation by H+-coupled transport mechanisms. This hypothesis is supported by our findings that a collapse of the transmembrane H+ gradient by the addition of NH4 (Fig. 5C (QuickTime movie, Fig. 4E)) or bafilomycin A1 (a selective V-type H+-ATPase inhibitor; Fig. 5C) results in a rapid discharge of vacuolar Ca2+. Given the essential role of Ca2+ as a secondary messenger molecule and the fact that physiological studies in plants have established a role for vacuolar (tonoplast) H+/Ca2+ exchange activity in ion transport, Ca2+ homeostasis, and signal transduction (27Hirschi K. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 100-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), further elucidation of the analogous H+-dependent mechanisms underlying Ca2+ homeostasis in the malaria parasite will be of significant importance. Here we add another critical transport function to the malarial parasites repertoire of vacuolar transport mechanisms (Fig. 6). It will be important to determine how the interplay of Ca2+ transport and H+ transport via either the H+-pyrophosphatase or the V-type H+-ATPase contributes to organelle function. The rapid redistribution of vacuolar Ca2+ at schizogony (asexual multiplication) must implicate communication between the parasite nucleus and the food vacuole. In addition this organelle harbors transporters implicated in drug resistance (notably PfCRT and PGH1 (reviewed in Ref. 4Warhurst D.C. Craig J.C. Adagu I.S. Lancet. 2002; 360: 1527-1529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar)). The potential for proton-coupled Ca2+ transport to influence the function of these resistance transporters could have significant implications for malaria chemotherapy in the age of the quinoline-resistant parasite.

LPL is regulated by yet unknown post-translational events affecting the levels of active dimers. On co-expression of LPL with human molecular chaperones, we found that calreticulin had the most pronounced effects on LPL activity, but calnexin was also effective. Calreticulin caused a 9-fold increase in active LPL, amounting to about 50% of the expressed LPL protein. The total expression of LPL protein was increased less than 20%, and the secretion rates for active and inactive LPL were not significantly changed by the chaperone. Thus, the main effect was an increased specific activity of LPL both in cells and media. Chromatography on heparin-Sepharose and sucrose density gradient centrifugation demonstrated that most of the inactive LPL was monomeric and that calreticulin promoted formation of active dimers. Higher oligomers of inactive LPL were present in cell extracts, but only monomers and dimers were secreted to the medium. Interaction between LPL and calreticulin was demonstrated, and the effect of the chaperone was prevented by castanospermine, an inhibitor of N-glycan glucose trimming.

Lipidol. 2002; 13: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The enzyme is produced and secreted mainly by adipocytes and muscle cells, but it is also produced in other cells such as macrophages and certain neurons. LPL is transported by yet unclear mechanisms to the vascular endothelium, where it is attached to cell surfaces through interaction with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG). The products of lipolysis are taken up for storage or oxidation in adjacent tissues. In addition, LPL can mediate internalization of intact lipoproteins by bridging them to cell surface receptors like the LDL receptor-like protein or HSPG. LPL, along with pancreatic lipase, hepatic lipase (HL), and endothelial lipase, belongs to the gene family of mammalian triglyceride lipases (2Wong H. Schotz M.C. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 993-999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 4Hide W.A. Chan L. Li W.-H. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 167-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of LPL has not yet been determined. Based on homology with pancreatic lipase, it has been proposed that LPL has two structurally distinct regions, a larger N-terminal domain containing the active site and a smaller C-terminal domain with other important functions, such as binding to lipids, LDL receptorlike protein, and HSPG (5van Tilbeurgh H.

Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5606-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER), human LPL is co-translationally glycosylated at amino acid residues Asn43 and Asn359. Studies using site-directed mutagenesis and inhibitors of transport between ER and Golgi have shown that core glycosylation at residue Asn43 is necessary for activation and release of LPL from the ER, but glycosylation at Asn359 is not necessary (9Semenkovich C.F.

A number of studies have suggested that proper folding, dimerization, and activation of LPL occurs already in the ER (12Vannier C. Amri E.-Z. Etienne J. Negrel R. Ailhaud G. J. Biol.

Molecular chaperones are a group of proteins that interact transiently with unfolded and misfolded proteins, thus preventing improper protein-protein interactions until the new protein has found its native fold. When the correct three-dimensional structure has been reached, the molecular chaperones are released (19Ellis R.J. Vandervies S.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 321-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Hartl F.U. Martin J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 92-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). It has been pointed out that addition of N-linked carbohydrate is often a necessary step to maintain protein solubility in the ER (19Ellis R.J. Vandervies S.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 321-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Trimming of glucose residues is required for interaction of the nascent protein with the lectin-like ER chaperones calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (CRT) (21Hammond C. Helenius A. Science. 1994; 266: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 22Ora A. Helenius A. J. Biol.

In cells treated with tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation, or with castanospermine (CST), an inhibitor of ER glucosidases, mostly inactive LPL is formed, and the inactive LPL protein is retained within the cells (13Ben-Zeev O. Doolittle M.H. Davis R.C. Elovson J. Schotz M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6219-6227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Masuno H. Schultz C.J. Park J.W. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Mateo C.

Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1343-1349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that N-linked carbohydrate chains play important roles in the initial folding of LPL. Doolittle and co-workers (25Briquet-Laugier V. Ben-Zeev O. White A. Doolittle M.H. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 2044-2058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that the chaperone CNX is down-regulated in mice with functional LPL and HL deficiency due to the cld/cld mutation and more recently (18Ben-Zeev O. Mao H.Z. Doolittle M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10727-10738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) that ER chaperones may be involved in prevention of aggregation of newly synthesized LPL. In accordance, Boedeker et al. (26Boedeker J.C. Doolittle M.H. Santamarina-Fojo S. White A.L. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1627-1635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that CNX increased the efficiency of export of active human HL from the ER of transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells and also demonstrated interaction of HL with the chaperone. Thus a role for ER chaperones in LPL folding and activation is implicated but has as yet not been directly studied. The original purpose for our work was to produce sufficient amounts of pure human LPL for studies of the enzyme with biophysical methods. The baculovirus system had previously been used successfully for production of pancreatic lipase and hormone-sensitive lipase (27Thirstrup K. Carrière F. Hjort S. Rasmussen P.B. Wöldike H.

Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 12: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In our hands the insect cells produced and secreted mostly monomeric, inactive LPL. Based on the possible need of LPL for folding assistance, we speculated that one explanation for the low level of active LPL was that insect cells might lack the molecular chaperones or foldases that promote folding/dimerization of LPL in mammalian cells. To test this we co-infected the cells with LPL and a selection of folding assistant factors, including CNX, CRT, protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI), immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (BiP), and the foldase ERp57. Our results demonstrate that ER chaperones, especially CRT, enhance the specific activity of human LPL, whereas synthesis of LPL protein and its secretion to the culture medium were not much affected. By co-immunoprecipitation we demonstrated direct interaction between LPL and CRT, and this interaction was prevented by treatment of the cells with CST. Based on these findings we conclude that CRT is a potential candidate to assist folding of LPL in tissues. Materials—Heparin was from Leo Pharma AB, Malmö, Sweden.

The downstream primer encoded 18 nucleotides of the C terminus of LPL cDNA containing a stop codon, as well as a restriction site for HindIII. The resulting 1.45-kb fragment was digested with XbaI and HindIII and was subsequently ligated into the plasmid PFAsBacI, and a recombinant baculovirus was constructed exactly as described by the manufacturer. Recombinant viruses were isolated after several rounds of plaque purification and were amplified using standard techniques. Expression of Human LPL and the Molecular Chaperones in Insect Cells—Culture and infection of the insect cells (Sf21) were performed exactly as described by the manufacturer. The medium used in all experiments was SF 900II, supplemented with 5% bovine calf serum. To study the effect of the molecular chaperones on the expression of LPL, 1 × 106 cells/well (in 6-well plates, 1 ml of medium/well) were infected with recombinant baculoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of 1. Triplicate wells were used for each infection, and cultures were grown at 27 °C. Heparin, 10 IU/ml culture medium, was used throughout the expression to release LPL from the cells and to stabilize the enzyme in the medium. The virus titer was 1 × 108 plaque-forming units/ml in all experiments. In some experiments 1.8 × 107 cells/flask (150 cm2) was used, as indicated in the figure legends. Harvesting of Cells—The culture medium was removed, and the cells were usually harvested at 96 h after infection. The plates were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and cells were scraped in 1 ml of lysis buffer, pH 8.2, containing 10 IU heparin/ml, 0.025 m ammonia, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 2 tablets of protease inhibitors/100 ml. Following homogenization by sonication (MSE Soniprep 150), the homogenates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were used for measurements of LPL activity and mass. LPL Activity and LPL Mass Assay—LPL activity and LPL mass in cell lysate and medium were assayed as described previously (37Bergö M. Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μl of supernatant of cell homogenate or 20 μl of medium was incubated at 25 °Cin200 μl of a mixture that contained a phospholipid-stabilized emulsion of soybean triacylglycerols, with the same composition as Intralipid 10% (Fresenius-KABI), into which tri-[9,10-3H]oleoylglycerol had been incorporated at the manufactory. Heat-inactivated rat serum was used as the source of apolipoprotein CII and bovine serum albumin as fatty acid acceptor, and heparin was used to stabilize the lipase. One milliunit of lipase activity corresponded to the release of 1 nmol of fatty acid/min. Samples were assayed in triplicate. For measurement of LPL mass, affinity-purified immunoglobulins (IgY) from chicken, raised against bovine LPL, was used for capture of the antigen during an overnight incubation. Bound LPL was detected with the 5D2 monoclonal antibody raised against bovine LPL (a kind gift from Dr. John Brunzell, Seattle, WA), followed by peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG. LPL purified from bovine milk was used as standard for the immunoassay because pure human LPL was not available. Heparin-Sepharose Chromatography—Chromatography on heparin-Sepharose was carried out as described previously (37Bergö M. Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20-ml sample was loaded to the column (1 ml of gel) which had been equilibrated with buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 10% glycerol and 0.1% Triton X-100. After washing with the equilibration buffer, fractions (1 ml each) were eluted by a linear salt gradient in the same buffer (0.15–2.0 m NaCl). The salt concentrations in the fractions were determined manually by conductometry using standard solutions of NaCl made up in the same buffer. Sucrose Gradient Centrifugation—Duplicate samples of culture medium or cell extracts (200 μl) were applied to 3.6 ml of 5–20% linear sucrose density gradients made up in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, containing 2.0 m NaCl and 1 mg of bovine serum albumin/ml. Centrifugation was carried out in a Beckman Coulter SW60 rotor at 50,000 rpm for 18 h at 10 °C. Following centrifugation, fractions of 238 μl were collected by puncture of the bottom of the tube by a needle attached by tubing to a pump. To recover aggregated LPL that had sedimented to the bottom during the centrifugation, the tube was at the end vigorously shaken before the last fraction was manually aspirated by a pipette. Bovine LPL was run in separate tubes as standard. For this, some LPL was first dissociated to monomers by treatment with 1 m guanidinium chloride at 10 °C for several hours to be completely inactivated (8Osborne Jr., J.C. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Lee N.S. Olivecrona T. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5606-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The monomers (diluted 200-fold with buffer) were then mixed with the active, dimeric bovine LPL (500 ng of each), and duplicates of this mixture (200 μl each) were run on sucrose density gradients in parallel with samples from the insect cells. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—LPL in medium and cells was collected at 48, 72, and 96 h after infection. Immunoprecipitation was carried out by using affinity-purified chicken anti-bovine LPL IgY, previously digested by papain. The digestion caused complete disappearance of the IgY heavy chain and appearance of bands of ∼35 kDa representing the Fab and Fc fragments, as described (38Doolittle M.H. Ben-Zeev O. Briquet-Laugier V. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 934-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After mixing chicken IgY Fab with the samples and incubating them overnight at 4 °C, the LPL-Fab immune complexes were captured by a rabbit anti-chicken immunomatrix prepared from the lyophilized S. aureus as described (38Doolittle M.H. Ben-Zeev O. Briquet-Laugier V. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 934-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following centrifugation, the pellets were washed and suspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.7, containing 0.5% SDS, and the tubes were placed for 2 min in a boiling water bath. The samples were then centrifuged for 5 min at 12,000 × g, and the supernatants were mixed with sample buffer for SDS-PAGE and run on 12% polyacrylamide gels. Following electroblotting to a polyvinylidene difluoride filter, intact, affinity-purified chicken anti-bovine LPL immunoglobulins followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-chicken antibodies were used for detection of LPL. Endo H Digestion—Medium and cells were collected at 96 h after infection. Following immunoprecipitation, as described above, the samples were digested by Endo H for 20 h at 37 °C as described (39Park J.W. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Scow R.O. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). After SDS-PAGE, Western blotting was carried out as described above. Co-immunoprecipitation Analyses—Cells from expression of LPL, with or without co-expression of CRT, were collected at 96 h after infection. After homogenization and centrifugation, the supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation as described above. The recovered precipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with either a rabbit antibody to human CRT and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody or with the anti-LPL antibody, as described above. Statistics—Data are presented as means ± S.D. Statistical significance between groups was calculated by Student's t test. Glycosylated Human LPL Was Expressed in the Baculovirus System—Culture media and cells were collected at different times after infection (48, 72, and 96 h) and were analyzed for LPL by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting (Fig. 1A). A protein with similar mobility as purified human LPL was detected at all time points, both in media and in the cell homogenates, but was not present in non-infected cells (data not shown). The levels of the expressed LPL protein increased with time. The highest level was obtained at 96 h, while after 120 h it was decreased (data not shown). The decrease was probably due to the visible cell lysis that started to occur after 96 h of culture. To investigate whether the recombinant LPL protein was glycosylated, an experiment with Endo H digestion was performed (Fig. 1B). It was shown previously (40Sakayama K. Masuno H. Okumura H. Shibata T. Okuda H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1127: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) that LPL from human adipose tissue contains two types of subunits, one fully Endo H-sensitive and one partially Endo H-sensitive. The migration of the expressed LPL protein, both from media and cells, corresponded well to that of human LPL purified from plasma (Fig. 1B). After digestion with Endo H, the mobility was faster than for the undigested proteins. This demonstrated that LPL expressed by the insect cells, whether recovered from cells or from media, was glycosylated and Endo H-sensitive. Only one LPL band was seen after digestion, indicating that the expressed LPL contained only glycan chains of the high mannose type (fully Endo H-sensitive). The Expressed LPL Was Mostly Inactive, but This Was Not Due to Rapid Loss of Activity—Despite the presence of LPL protein both in cells and in media, only low levels of LPL activity were detected even after 72 and 96 h of culture (Table I). This activity was not present in non-infected cells (data not shown), and it was dependent on apolipoprotein CII in the assay, indicating that it corresponded to the recombinant LPL. No detectable LPL activity was present in culture media without heparin, but some activity appeared when the cells were treated with heparin for 1 h before harvesting (Table I). This indicated that some active LPL was associated with the surface of the insect cells in a heparin-releasable manner and/or that heparin was necessary to stabilize LPL after release to the medium.Table IThe effect of heparin on release of human LPL expressed by insect cellsConditionTime after infectionLPL activity in mediumhmilliunits/1 × 106 cellWith heparin7210 ± 3.59614 ± 6.7Without heparin720960Heparin for 1 h prior to collection of medium721.9 ± 0.6962.6 ± 0.7 Open table in a new tab To investigate whether the low level of LPL activity was due to rapid inactivation in the media during the long culture time (96 h), conditioned heparin-containing media were incubated without cells but under the same conditions as used with cells. The decline of LPL activity was followed by measurements at various time points. From these data, the half-life of LPL activity was estimated to be around 12 h (data not shown). The specific LPL activity was not higher in cells or media at shorter times after infection. LPL activity increased in parallel with the LPL protein up to 96 h (data not shown) indicating a constant relation between production and inactivation rates. The Expressed Inactive LPL Was Mostly Monomeric—It has been shown that inactive monomeric LPL has lower affinity for heparin than the active dimeric form. Therefore, chromatography on heparin-Sepharose is widely used to separate inactive forms of LPL from active dimers (18Ben-Zeev O. Mao H.Z. Doolittle M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10727-10738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 37Bergö M. Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The extended molecular shape of the LPL subunits precludes separation of monomers and dimers by gel permeation chromatography (7Iverius P.-H. Östlund-Lindqvist A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7791-7795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When culture media from infected insect cells were subjected to chromatography on heparin-Sepharose, a small amount of the LPL protein eluted late in the salt gradient (at 1.1 m NaCl), in the position expected for active dimers (Fig. 2). This peak was associated with lipase activity. The specific enzyme activity of the peak fractions amounted to 270–400 milliunits/μg, which is in the range expected for fully active LPL assayed under our conditions. Most of the LPL protein, about 90%, eluted earlier in the salt gradient (at around 0.5 m NaCl) and was catalytically inactive. A similar elution profile was obtained for LPL in cell extracts as for LPL secreted to medium (data not shown). With cell extracts even more (95%) of the LPL protein eluted in the early inactive peak. To verify that the inactive LPL that was produced by the insect cells was in fact monomeric, we performed sucrose gradient centrifugations and compared the sedimentation of LPL activity and mass to the behavior of purified bovine LPL that was partially dissociated to inactive monomers by treatment with 1 m guanidinium chloride (Fig. 3). On centrifugation of culture media, the low amount of LPL activity (Fig. 3B) sedimented as the active, dimeric bovine LPL (Fig. 3A). The main part of the LPL protein in the culture medium was inactive and sedimented more slowly (Fig. 3B), corresponding to the peak of inactive bovine LPL monomers (Fig. 3A). No LPL protein was recovered from the bottom of the centrifuge tubes, demonstrating that the inactive LPL in the medium was not aggregated to higher oligomers (Fig. 3B). In contrast, on centrifugation of cell extracts, about 30% of the LPL protein was recovered in the bottom of the tube (Fig. 3C). Most of the remaining LPL protein sedimented as monomers (Fig. 3C), whereas the small peak of LPL activity sedimented as the active bovine dimeric standard (compare Fig. 3, C and A). These results demonstrated that the cells secreted inactive LPL monomers to the culture medium, whereas aggregated LPL was only found in the cell extracts. Aggregates were retained in the cells and were not formed in the heparin-containing media during the extended culture time. The secretion of inactive, monomeric LPL to the medium indicated a lack of recognition of this form by the ER quality control system and furthermore a dysfunction of ER molecular chaperones to assist folding of LPL. Molecular Chaperones Increase Specific Activity of LPL—To study if mammalian molecular chaperones could promote formation of active dimers of LPL under the conditions used above, cDNA for CNX, CRT, BiP, PDI, and the foldase ERp57, all incorporated into separate baculovirus vectors under the control of the polyhedrin promoter, were used in co-expression experiments, as described previously (36Tate C.G.

https://openalex.org/W2136316545,"Heparan sulfate d-glucosaminyl 3-<i>O</i>-sulfotransferases (3-OSTs) catalyze the transfer of sulfate from 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) to position 3 of the glucosamine residue of heparan sulfate and heparin. A sixth member of the human 3-OST family, named 3-OST-5, was recently reported (Xia, G., Chen, J., Tiwari, V., Ju, W., Li, J.-P., Malmstrom, A., Shukla, D., and Liu, J. (2002) <i>J. Biol. Chem</i>. 277, 37912–37919). In the present study, we cloned putative catalytic domain of the human 3-OST-5 and expressed it in insect cells as a soluble enzyme. Recombinant 3-OST-5 only exhibited sulfotransferase activity toward heparan sulfate and heparin. When incubated heparan sulfate with [<sup>35</sup>S]PAPS, the highest incorporation of<sup>35</sup>S was observed, and digestion of the product with a mixture of heparin lyases yielded two major<sup>35</sup>S-labeled disaccharides, which were determined as ΔHexA-GlcN(NS,3S,6S) and ΔHexA(2S)-GlcN(NS,3S) by further digestion with 2-sulfatase and degradation with mercuric acetate. However, when used heparin as acceptor, we identified a highly sulfated disaccharide unit as a major product. This had a structure of ΔHexA(2S)-GlcN(NS,3S,6S). Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that 3-OST-5 was highly expressed in fetal brain, followed by adult brain and spinal cord, and at very low or undetectable levels in the other tissues. Finally, we detected a tetrasulfated disaccharide unit in bovine intestinal heparan sulfate. To our knowledge, this is the first report to describe not only the natural occurrence of tetrasulfated disaccharide unit but also the enzymatic formation of this novel structure."
https://openalex.org/W2090058279,"Histidines 107 and 109 in the glycine receptor (GlyR) α1 subunit have previously been identified as determinants of the inhibitory zinc-binding site. Based on modeling of the GlyR α1 subunit extracellular domain by homology to the acetylcholine-binding protein crystal structure, we hypothesized that inhibitory zinc is bound within the vestibule lumen at subunit interfaces, where it is ligated by His107 from one subunit and His109 from an adjacent subunit. This was tested by co-expressing α1 subunits containing the H107A mutation with α1 subunits containing the H109A mutation. Although sensitivity to zinc inhibition is markedly reduced when either mutation is individually incorporated into all five subunits, the GlyRs formed by the co-expression of H107A mutant subunits with H109A mutant subunits exhibited an inhibitory zinc sensitivity similar to that of the wild type α1 homomeric GlyR. This constitutes strong evidence that inhibitory zinc is coordinated at the interface between adjacent α1 subunits. No evidence was found for β subunit involvement in the coordination of inhibitory zinc, indicating that a maximum of two zinc-binding sites per α1β receptor is sufficient for maximal zinc inhibition. Our data also show that two zinc-binding sites are sufficient for significant inhibition of α1 homomers. The binding of zinc at the interface between adjacent α1 subunits could restrict intersubunit movements, providing a feasible mechanism for the inhibition of channel activation by zinc.

The binding of zinc at the interface between adjacent α1 subunits could restrict intersubunit movements, providing a feasible mechanism for the inhibition of channel activation by zinc. Zinc is concentrated into round, clear presynaptic vesicles in central nerve terminals and is released into the synaptic cleft by nerve stimulation (1Assaf S.Y. Chung S.H. Nature. 1984; 308: 734-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar, 2Howell G.A. Welch M.G. Frederickson C.J.

During synaptic stimulation, zinc is thought to reach a peak external concentration of more than 100 μm (1Assaf S.Y. Chung S.H. Nature. 1984; 308: 734-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar, 3Frederickson C.J. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1989; 31: 145-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar, 4Vogt K. Mellor J.

At such concentrations, zinc is potentially able to modulate a wide variety of pre- and postsynaptic ion channels (5Smart T.G. Xie X. Krishek B.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 1994; 42: 393-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that the glycine receptor chloride channel (GlyR), 1The abbreviations used are: GlyR, glycine receptor; LGIC, ligand-gated ion channel; AChBP, acetylcholine-binding protein; nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; 5HT3R, serotonin type 3 receptor; GABAAR, GABA type A receptor; GABACR, GABA type C receptor; I max, maximum (saturating) current magnitude; WT, wild type.1The abbreviations used are: GlyR, glycine receptor; LGIC, ligand-gated ion channel; AChBP, acetylcholine-binding protein; nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; 5HT3R, serotonin type 3 receptor; GABAAR, GABA type A receptor; GABACR, GABA type C receptor; I max, maximum (saturating) current magnitude; WT, wild type. which mediates inhibitory neurotransmission in the spinal cord and brainstem (6Legendre P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 760-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), may be a physiological target for zinc modulation. First, zinc exerts potent effects on the GlyR; low concentrations (0.01–10 μm) potentiate glycinergic currents by increasing the apparent glycine affinity, whereas higher concentrations (>10 μm) inhibit the current by reducing the apparent glycine affinity (7Laube B. Kuhse J. Rundstrom N. Kirsch J. Schmieden V. Betz H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 483: 613-619Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Second, an ultrastructural study has found evidence for zinc and glycine co-localization in individual presynaptic terminals in the spinal cord (8Birinyi A. Parker D. Antal M. Shupliakov O. J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 433: 208-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Third, at glycinergic synapses onto intact zebrafish hindbrain (Mauthner) neurons, zinc chelators decreased the amplitude, duration, and frequency of glycinergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents, whereas zinc application had the opposite effect (9Suwa H. Saint-Amant L. Triller A. Drapeau P. Legendre P. J. Neurophysiol. 2001; 85: 912-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The GlyR is a member of the ligand-gated ion channel (LGIC) receptor family, which includes the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor cation channel (nAChR), the γ-aminobutyric acid type-A and type-C receptor chloride channels (GABAAR and GABACR), the serotonin receptor cation channel (5HT3R), and a recently identified zinc-gated cation channel (10Davies P.A. Wang W. Hales T.G. Kirkness E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 712-717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) as well as invertebrate glutamate and histamine receptors (11Gisselmann G. Pusch H. Hovemann B.T. Hatt H. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 11-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These receptors are composed of five structurally similar subunits arranged in a ring to form a central ion-conducting pore (12Karlin A. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 102-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Adult GlyRs in vivo are composed of α and β subunits in a 3α/2β stoichiometry (13Langosch D. Thomas L. Betz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7394-7398Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Although α subunits readily form homomeric GlyRs in heterologous expression systems, β subunits form functional receptors only as heteromers with α subunits. The molecular mechanisms of zinc inhibition and potentiation have recently been investigated in several laboratories (7Laube B. Kuhse J. Rundstrom N. Kirsch J. Schmieden V. Betz H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 483: 613-619Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 14Lynch J.W. Jacques P. Pierce K.D. Schofield P.R. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2159-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 15Harvey R.J. Thomas P. James C.H. Wilderspin A. Smart T.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 520: 53-64Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 16Laube B. Kuhse J. Betz H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 522: 215-230Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Although the molecular basis of potentiation has so far proved elusive, a strong case has been advanced for a candidate inhibitory site. Harvey et al. (15Harvey R.J. Thomas P. James C.H. Wilderspin A. Smart T.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 520: 53-64Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar) showed that zinc inhibition of the recombinant α1 GlyR was selectively abolished by either reducing the pH or by pretreating receptors with a histidine-specific modifying agent. Since both treatments effectively reduce the ability of zinc to bind to histidine imidazole rings, this implicated histidines in the coordination of inhibitory zinc. Mutations of either His107 or His109 were subsequently shown to abolish zinc inhibition, strongly suggesting that these residues coordinate zinc at its inhibitory site (15Harvey R.J. Thomas P. James C.H. Wilderspin A. Smart T.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 520: 53-64Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For a pair of histidine side chains to coordinate a zinc ion, the α-carbon atoms need to be within 13 Å of each other (17Auld D.S. Biometals. 2001; 14: 271-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Since histidines 107 and 109 are separated by only one residue, it is certainly feasible that this pair could coordinate zinc ions within individual α subunits. Indeed, histidines with this spacing occur in many structurally defined zinc-binding sites (17Auld D.S. Biometals. 2001; 14: 271-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), including carbonic anhydrase II (Protein Data Bank code 1CA2) (18Lesburg C.A. Huang C. Christianson D.W. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15780-15791Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), which contains the same HFH tripeptide as GlyR α1 107–109, thereby providing a plausible model for zinc binding within individual GlyR α1 subunits (15Harvey R.J. Thomas P. James C.H. Wilderspin A. Smart T.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 520: 53-64Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The recently resolved crystal structure of a soluble acetylcholine-binding protein (AChBP) from the snail, Lymnaea stagnalis, has provided a structural model for the N-terminal ligand-binding domain of LGICs (19Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar). Modeling of the GlyR N-terminal domain, based on AChBP, places His107 and His109 near the lumen of the channel vestibule close to the axis of symmetry (20Cromer B.A. Morton C.J. Parker M.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 280-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In this position, His107 and His109 from adjacent α subunits could be close enough to coordinate zinc ions across the subunit interface, as recently predicted by Laube et al. (21Laube B. Maksay G. Schemm R. Betz H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 519-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to use a combination of homology modeling based on the AChBP crystal structure, coupled with functional analysis of GlyRs incorporating site-directed mutations in putative zinc-binding regions, to provide insights into the structure of the inhibitory zinc-binding site. Mutagenesis and Expression of GlyR cDNAs—The human GlyR α1 and β subunit cDNAs were subcloned into the pCIS2 and pIRES2-EGFP plasmid vectors (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and the successful incorporation of mutations was confirmed by sequencing the clones. HEK293 cells were transfected using a calcium phosphate precipitation protocol. When co-transfecting the GlyR α and β subunits, their respective cDNAs were combined in a ratio of 1:10 (22Pribilla I. Takagi T. Langosch D. Bormann J. Betz H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4305-4311Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). After exposure to transfection solution for 24 h, cells were washed twice using the culture medium and used for recording over the following 24–72 h. Electrophysiology—The cells were observed using a fluorescent microscope, and currents were measured using the whole cell patch clamp configuration. Cells were perfused by a control solution that contained 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, with the pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. Patch pipettes were fabricated from borosilicate hematocrit tubing (Vitrex, Modulohm, Denmark) and heat-polished. Pipettes had a tip resistance of 1.5–3 megaohms when filled with the standard pipette solution, which contained 145 mm CsCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, with the pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. After establishment of the whole cell configuration, cells were voltage-clamped at –40 mV, and membrane currents were recorded using an Axopatch 1D amplifier and pclamp6 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). The cells were perfused by a parallel array of microtubular barrels through which solutions were gravity-induced. Because the α subunit can efficiently assemble into functional GlyRs as either α homomers or αβ heteromers, it is necessary to confirm the incorporation of β subunits into functional receptors. This was achieved in two ways. First, green fluorescent protein expression was used to identify cells expressing GlyR β subunit protein. Second, picrotoxin sensitivity was used as a functional assay of the incorporation of β subunits into heteromeric GlyRs (22Pribilla I. Takagi T. Langosch D. Bormann J. Betz H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4305-4311Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). When co-expressed with α subunits in HEK293 cells, incorporation of β subunits increases the picrotoxin IC50 from around 25 to 500 μm in the presence of an EC50 glycine concentration (23Handford C.A. Lynch J.W. Baker E. Webb G.C. Ford J.H. Sutherland G.R. Schofield P.R. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 35: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the present study, we measured the effect of 1 mm picrotoxin on the magnitude of currents activated by an EC20 glycine concentration, and cells were assumed to express αβ heteromeric GlyRs if 1 mm picrotoxin inhibited the current by less than 50%. Data Analysis—The empirical Hill equation, fitted by a nonlinear least squares algorithm (Sigmaplot; Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA), was used to calculate the EC50, the IC50, and the Hill coefficients (n H) of excitatory and inhibitory dose-response curves. Statistical significance was determined by a one-way analysis of variance using the Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc test for unpaired data (Sigma Stat; Jandel Scientific), with p < 0.05 representing significance. Molecular Modeling—Models of the extracellular region of the human GlyR α1 subunit were constructed by homology modeling, using the crystal structure of AChBP from the snail Lymnaea stagnalis as a template (Protein Data Bank entry 1I9B) (19Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar). Sequence identity between LGICs and AChBP is only 15–24%, in the “twilight zone” for effective alignment and homology modeling (24Chothia C. Lesk A.M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 823-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1944) Google Scholar). To improve the reliability of the alignment, we used ClustalW (25Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54865) Google Scholar) to align AChBP with a large number of Cys loop LGICs, particularly those that are the most similar to AChBP, such as nAChRs, as described in Ref. 20Cromer B.A. Morton C.J. Parker M.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 280-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar. Secondary structure predictions using the PHD prediction algorithm (26Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2630) Google Scholar) assisted the alignment in regions of particularly low homology, such as the N-terminal α-helix. Swiss-Model (27Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9389) Google Scholar) was used to create independent monomer models for each alignment tested. Loop regions that correspond to gaps in the alignment were modeled by fitting structures from a loop data base and are the least reliable sections of the models. Acceptable monomer models were then assembled into pentamers using AChBP as a scaffold. The assembled pentamer was energy-minimized using INSIGHT II DISCOVER (Accelrys, San Diego, CA) to eliminate any obvious problems such as steric clashes. Ramachandran plots and Verify-3D scores (28Luthy R. Bowie J.U. Eisenberg D. Nature. 1992; 356: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2479) Google Scholar) were used to assess the quality of each model. For regions of a model that scored poorly, other possible alignments were tested. Four different alignments were tested in the region in the putative inhibitory zinc-binding region surrounding His107 and His109 (Fig. 1A). Excluding the inhibitory zinc-binding region, there are only three residues that fall in the disallowed region of a Ramachandran plot, Leu83 and His201, which are in loops corresponding with gaps in the alignment, and Lys33, which corresponds to Arg23 in AChBP, which also falls in the disallowed region. Total Verify-3D scores were above 64 for all models, which is quite acceptable for this type of model (28Luthy R. Bowie J.U. Eisenberg D. Nature. 1992; 356: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2479) Google Scholar). With a sliding window of 21 residues, there are no regions with a negative score, but there are three regions that score below 0.2. These are the N-terminal helix and the loop between the second and third β-strands, which are both likely to interact with residues 1–10, and the signature Cys loop, which is likely to interact with the membrane domain. Since our models do not include residues 1–10 or the membrane domain, they cannot fully represent the native environment for the three regions mentioned. Finally, a conserved N-glycosylation site at Asn38 is on the surface of the model, consistent with it being glycosylated, and the unique disulfide bond of GlyRs is present in our models. Homology Modeling Indicates That His107 and His109 Face the Vestibule Lumen—Based on earlier findings (14Lynch J.W. Jacques P. Pierce K.D. Schofield P.R. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2159-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 15Harvey R.J. Thomas P. James C.H. Wilderspin A. Smart T.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 520: 53-64Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 16Laube B. Kuhse J. Betz H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 522: 215-230Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar), we started with the premise that His107 and His109 coordinate zinc at the inhibitory site of α1 homomeric GlyRs. In an attempt to understand the structural basis for zinc inhibition, we built models of the GlyR α1 subunit extracellular region, based on homology to AChBP, as described in Cromer et al. (20Cromer B.A. Morton C.J. Parker M.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 280-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), using the alignments shown in Fig. 1A. Histidines 107 and 109 of the GlyR α1 subunit fall within a region from Lys104 to Asn115, which we have termed the “inhibitory zinc-binding region” (Fig. 1A), that shares little homology with AChBP but is flanked by sequences with strong homology. These flanking sequences anchor the zinc-binding region within the model such that it faces the lumen of the extracellular vestibule, near the axis of symmetry and subunit interfaces (Fig. 1B; see also Ref. 20Cromer B.A. Morton C.J. Parker M.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 280-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Although the detailed structure of the zinc-binding region cannot be reliably predicted, its location near the axis of symmetry immediately raises the possibility that His107 and His109 from adjacent subunits could be close enough to coordinate zinc in an intersubunit site, as recently suggested by others (21Laube B. Maksay G. Schemm R. Betz H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 519-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the possibility of an intrasubunit site with zinc coordinated by His107 and His109 from the same subunit, as proposed by Harvey et al. (15Harvey R.J. Thomas P. James C.H. Wilderspin A. Smart T.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 520: 53-64Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar), remains also feasible. Consequently, our first aim, experimentally, was to discriminate between these alternative models for inhibitory zinc binding. His107 and His109 from Adjacent Subunits Form the Inhibitory Zinc-binding Site—To discriminate experimentally between intrasubunit and intersubunit models for the inhibitory zinc-binding site, we examined the zinc sensitivity of GlyRs formed from co-expression of αH107A and αH109A subunits, each of which individually shows reduced zinc sensitivity. The rationale was that if the inhibitory zinc-binding site is formed within a subunit, then these mixed receptors should be zinc-insensitive, since each subunit contains only one of the two required histidine residues. Therefore, if the resultant recombinant receptors possess a high affinity zinc inhibitory site, then this site must be formed at the interface between subunits. It is important to note that this approach cannot address the question of whether zinc can also be coordinated within individual subunits. Hence, in all our experiments, it is necessary to eliminate at least one histidine (His107 or His109) per subunit to ensure that this does not confound the interpretation of our results. The mean glycine EC50, n H, and I max values for the WT and all mutant GlyRs employed in this study are shown in Table I. As demonstrated previously, the αWT GlyR is highly sensitive to zinc inhibition. As expected from previous studies employing mutations at these positions (7Laube B. Kuhse J. Rundstrom N. Kirsch J. Schmieden V. Betz H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 483: 613-619Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 15Harvey R.J. Thomas P. James C.H. Wilderspin A. Smart T.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 520: 53-64Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 16Laube B. Kuhse J. Betz H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 522: 215-230Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 29Han N.L. Haddrill J.L. Lynch J.W. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 636-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), none of these mutations had dramatic effects on the glycine EC50, n H, or I max values. The inhibitory zinc dose responses for the αH107A GlyR, the αH109A GlyR, the double mutant αH107A,H109A GlyR, and the co-expressed (αH107A + αH109A) GlyR were measured in the presence of an EC20 glycine concentration. Zinc inhibition was quantitated by measuring the steady-state level of the current following application of zinc and expressing this as a fraction of the peak magnitude of the zinc-potentiated current (14Lynch J.W. Jacques P. Pierce K.D. Schofield P.R. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2159-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Sample responses to increasing concentrations of zinc for each of these receptor constructs are shown in Fig. 2A. Averaged zinc inhibitory dose responses are plotted in Fig. 2B, and the mean zinc IC50 and n H values for these and all other recombinant constructs examined in this study are summarized in Table I. The H107A mutation reduced the inhibitory potency by a factor of 15, whereas the H109A mutation almost entirely abolished zinc inhibition (Table I), consistent with earlier results (15Harvey R.J. Thomas P. James C.H. Wilderspin A. Smart T.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 520: 53-64Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and the proposed role of these residues in zinc coordination. The difference in the magnitude of the effect of the two mutations indicates that the zinc coordination is not perfectly symmetric, consistent with the probable involvement of other residues (16Laube B. Kuhse J. Betz H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 522: 215-230Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). As expected, the double mutant αH107A,H109A GlyR was also insensitive to zinc inhibition (Fig. 2A).Table IFunctional properties of WT and mutant GlyRsTransfected subunitsGlycineZincEC50nHImaxnIC50nHnμ mnAαWT22 ± 53.1 ± 0.32.1 ± 1.0716 ± 8 μm0.6 ± 0.14αH107A26 ± 31.2 ± 0.11.4 ± 0.73247 ± 43 μm1.1 ± 0.36αH109A51 ± 62.0 ± 0.53.9 ± 1.93>1 mmNAaNA, not applicable.5αH107A,H109A60 ± 42.0 ± 0.36.1 ± 0.73>1 mmNA8αH107A + αH109A40 ± 11.8 ± 0.12.7 ± 1.0521 ± 5 μm0.6 ± 0.26αT112V43 ± 61.3 ± 0.22.2 ± 0.75>1 mmNA3αH107A,T112V15 ± 41.1 ± 0.11.5 ± 0.66>1 mmNA5αH109A,T112V15 ± 20.8 ± 0.10.7 ± 0.16>1 mmNA5αH107A + αT112V19 ± 21.1 ± 0.13.6 ± 1.63>1 mmNA3αH109A + αT112V19 ± 41.1 ± 0.31.4 ± 0.53>1 mmNA3αH107A + αH109A,T112V48 ± 131.0 ± 0.34.8 ± 2.14>1 mmNA3αWT + βWT25 ± 42.7 ± 0.72.6 ± 0.7816 ± 5 μm0.6 ± 0.15αH109A + βWT44 ± 22.2 ± 0.23.7 ± 0.93>1 mmNA3αH107A,H109A + βN130H60 ± 62.6 ± 0.62.6 ± 0.65>1 mmNA4αWT + βH132A41 ± 13.6 ± 0.12.6 ± 1.0311 ± 4 μm0.8 ± 0.33a NA, not applicable. Open table in a new tab When the two single mutant αH107A + αH109A subunits were co-expressed, high sensitivity zinc inhibition was observed (Fig. 2, A and B). The zinc sensitivity (21 ± 5 μm; Table I) was not significantly different from that of the αWT GlyR (16 ± 8 μm), consistent with it being due to the same zinc-binding site. This inhibition could not have been mediated by zinc ions binding within individual subunits, since each subunit contained only one of the two required histidine residues. Therefore, it must have been due to intersubunit coordination of zinc ions by His107 and His109 from different subunits, supporting the hypothesis of an intersubunit zinc site and the positioning of the inhibitory zinc-binding region in our initial model (Fig. 1). The two coordinating histidines almost certainly come from adjacent subunits, since the constraints imposed on the model by the conserved anchor points make it virtually impossible for His107 and His109 from nonadjacent subunits to get close enough to coordinate zinc across the vestibule lumen. The fact that the inhibition seen with the mixed αH107A + αH109A GlyRs was not seen in either of the single mutants alone indicates that His107 and His109 each occupy a specific subunit “face” (either + or –; see Fig. 1) and are not flexible to coordinate zinc at either face. Therefore, an intersubunit zinc site can only occur at one of the two possible +/–interfaces, either H107A/H109A or H109A/H107A. This limits the number of inhibitory zinc sites in a pentamer of mixed αH107A + αH109A subunits to a maximum of two (Table II), demonstrating that two such sites are sufficient for inhibition by zinc. The relatively low n H for zinc inhibition in WT GlyRs and our finding that it is unchanged in the mixed αH107A + αH109A GlyRs support the view that one or two bound zinc molecules may be sufficient for maximal zinc inhibition in the WT GlyR (Table II).Table IIPossible subunit arrangements resulting from the recombinant expression of α H107A and α H109A subunits Zinc inhibition of the mixed αH107A + αH109A GlyRs was incomplete (Fig. 1, A and B), however, inhibiting a maximum of 55 ± 5% (n = 6) of the glycine-activated current. In contrast, a saturating (1 mm) zinc concentration inhibits the αWT GlyR current by 100% (Fig. 1B; see also Refs. 7Laube B. Kuhse J. Rundstrom N. Kirsch J. Schmieden V. Betz H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 483: 613-619Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar and 14Lynch J.W. Jacques P. Pierce K.D. Schofield P.R. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2159-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The reduced extent of zinc inhibition is not unexpected, given that each receptor in the mixed population of mutant receptors contains zero, one, or two zinc-binding sites, relative to five sites in WT receptors. Assuming the αH109A and αH107A subunits recombine in a random binomial manner to form pentameric GlyRs, 6.2% of recombinant GlyRs should have no zinc-binding sites, 62.4% should have one inhibitory zinc-binding site, and 31.2% should contain two inhibitory zinc-binding sites per receptor (Table II). The 55% overall inhibition could be explained by GlyRs with two zinc sites being inhibited completely and those with one site being partially inhibited. Although this is a reasonable explanation, random recombination cannot be assumed, and other explanations are possible. In summary, the data above show that an intersubunit zinc-binding site can account for the zinc inhibition observed in WT α1 homomeric GlyRs but do not rule out an additional role for intrasubunit binding. Possible Involvement of Thr112 in Zinc Coordination—Laube et al. (16Laube B. Kuhse J. Betz H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 522: 215-230Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar) showed that a T112A mutation abolished inhibition by zinc and proposed that Thr112 is also involved in the coordination of zinc at its inhibitory site. If Thr112 directly coordinates zinc at an intersubunit inhibitory site, then co-expression of either the αH107A or αH109A subunits with the αT112A subunit should be able to restore zinc sensitivity, as observed for the two histidines above. To test this concept, we made the more conservative T112V mutation, which simply replaces the hydroxyl group of the threonine with a methyl group. As with the T112A mutation (16Laube B. Kuhse J. Betz H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 522: 215-230Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar), the T112V mutation had little effect on glycine sensitivity but completely eliminated sensitivity to zinc inhibition (Table I). As expected, the double mutant αH107A,T112V and αH109A,T112V GlyRs were also insensitive to zinc inhibition (Table I). However, these experiments provide no information as to"

The L-shaped complex I is composed of a peripheral arm extending into the bacterial cytoplasm (or the mitochondrial matrix) and a hydrophobic arm that is embedded in the membrane (14Grigorieff N. J.

In addition to the L-shaped conformation, a “horse-shoe-conformation” was observed for E. coli complex I, with two arms arranged side by side (15Böttcher B. Scheide D. Hesterberg M. Nagel-Steger L. Friedrich T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17970-17977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Upon purification, the peripheral and the membrane arm tend to dissociate (16Finel M. Skehel J.M. Albracht S.P.J. Fearnley I.M. Walker J.E.

Sequence comparisons indicate that the membrane-embedded part of complex I consists of seven conserved hydrophobic subunits with homologues found on bacterial or mitochondrial genomes and additional nuclear-encoded subunits in the case of eukaryotic complex I. One or several of these seven conserved subunits (NuoA, H, J, K, L, M, N, in the Na+-translocating complex I from E. coli, or the homologues ND3, 1, 6, 4L, 5, 4, 2 in the H+-translocating mitochondrial complex I) participate in Na+ (or H+) transport through complex I. So far, the cation-translocating subunit(s) of complex I have not been identified. A likely candidate is the NuoL subunit (ND5 according to bovine nomenclature), which is related to subunit A of bacterial multicomponent Na+ (or K+):H+ antiporters (19Hamamoto T. Hashimoto M. Hino M.

If necessary, 100 μg ml–1 ampicillin or 50 μg ml–1 kanamycin was added. Cells were harvested, washed once in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol and suspended in buffer. Inside-out membrane vesicles were obtained by French press cell rupture (26Reenstra W.W. Patel L. Rottenberg H. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Washed membrane vesicles used for Na+ transport measurements were prepared in the anaerobic chamber under an atmosphere of N2/H2 (95/5%) (11Gemperli A.C. Dimroth P. Steuber J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33811-33817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 m sucrose (24Pinner E. Kotler Y. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1729-1734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Construction of Plasmids—All plasmids are pISC1 derivatives, which contain a ColE1 origin of replication and the araC gene encoding the activator protein, which induces transcription in the presence of arabinose (27Hwang D.S. Thöny B. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2209-2213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PISC vectors confer ampicillin resistance. Plasmid pISC2 contains a unique NdeI site downstream of the para promoter. Vector pISC3 is a pISC2 derivative containing an XbaI/NdeI linker derived from vector pET-14b (Novagen), which replaces the unique NdeI site of pISC2 and introduces six histidine residues to the N terminus of the target protein (28Schulz H. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. Science. 1998; 281: 1197-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). A 1.1-kb DNA fragment encoding for the truncated NuoL subunit (amino acids 1–369; NuoLN) of complex I from E. coli was obtained by PCR using Pfu-DNA-polymerase (New England Biolabs). The primers used were 5′-TTCATATG AACATGCTTGCCTTAACC3-′ (forward) and 5′GCGAATTC TTAACGCAGACCGCCCATCTTG -3′ (reverse). Coding sequences of the nuoL gene are underlined. NdeI and EcoRI sites (bold letters) and a stop codon (italics) were introduced by PCR. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and EcoRI and cloned into pISC2, resulting in vector pECL3. An NdeI/EcoRI fragment containing the truncated nuoL gene was obtained from pECL3 and cloned into pISC3, resulting in vector pECL5. Vector pECL5 was subjected to double-strand sequencing (Microsynth, Balgach, Switzerland). The sequence obtained was identical to the nuoL sequence (accession number NP-416781) found on the E. coli genome (29Blattner F.R. Plunkett G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (5934) Google Scholar). Solubilization and Reconstitution—Washed membrane vesicles (40 mg protein, 1 ml) from E. coli DH5α transformed with pECL5 (NuoLN) or pISC3 (control) grown on Luria Bertani medium in the presence of 10 mm glucose were mixed with 9 ml buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH. 8.0, 300 mm KCl, 2 mm NaCl, 9% glycerol) containing 0.1 g dodecylmaltoside (Glykon) and stirred on ice (30 min). After ultracentrifugation, the supernatant containing the solubilized membrane proteins was added to 2.5 ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose resin (Qiagen) equilibrated with buffer. The slurry was gently shaken overnight at 4 °C. The resin was centrifuged and washed with 50 ml buffer containing 0.05% dodecylmaltoside. The resin was packed in a column, and bound NuoLN was eluted with 5 ml buffer containing 0.05% dodecylmaltoside and 50 mm imidazole. The enriched NuoLN protein (10 mg) was reconstituted into liposomes by a dilution method established for complex I from K. pneumoniae (11Gemperli A.C. Dimroth P. Steuber J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33811-33817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) using E. coli lipids (150 mg, Avanti). The lipids were mixed with NuoLN (4.5 ml eluate from the affinity column in 0.05% dodecylmaltoside), and the formation of proteoliposomes was achieved by drop-wise addition of 90 ml buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm KCl). The proteoliposomes were collected by ultracentrifugation and resuspended in buffer to a final concentration of 60–120 mg ml–1 lipid. Na + Transport—Na+ transport was followed under air at room temperature as described previously (11Gemperli A.C. Dimroth P. Steuber J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33811-33817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Incubation mixtures contained in 0.31 ml the reconstituted proteoliposomes (4.5 mg lipid) and 20 μm valinomycin (Sigma) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm KCl. If indicated, 0.1 mm EIPA 1The abbreviations used are: EIPA, 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride; ACMA, 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridin. (5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride (Sigma)) was added to the assay. The reaction was started by the addition of 5 mm NaCl (final concentration). At different times, samples of 70 μl (1.1 mg lipid) were applied to a 1-ml plastic syringe containing 0.6 ml Dowex 50 (K+). The proteoliposomes were immediately eluted with 0.8 ml deionized water. The eluate containing Na+ entrapped in the vesicles was analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy. In controls performed with 5 mm NaCl in buffer in the absence of vesicles, Na+ was completely absorbed to the Dowex columns. Blank values obtained with vesicles in buffer without NaCl added corresponded to the internal Na+ content of the liposomes (0.5–2.4 nmol Na+ per sample after passage through the Dowex column). Na+ transport into native membrane vesicles was followed in 0.3 ml 10 mm Tris-Mes, pH 8.0, 200 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2 (24Pinner E. Kotler Y. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1729-1734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The incubation mixture contained 2 mg of protein and 20 μm valinomycin. The internal Na+ content of the vesicles was 4 nmol Na+ mg–1 protein. The reaction was started by adding 5 mm NaCl, and at different times, aliquots of 70 μl were applied to the Dowex columns as described above. Other Methods—Oxidation of NADH or deaminoNADH (nicotinamide hypoxanthine dinucleotide) by membrane vesicles with O2 as electron acceptor was followed at 340 nm (ϵ340 = 6.22 mm–1 cm–1). NADH-induced proton uptake into native membrane vesicles was measured by the quenching of ACMA (9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridin) in 1.5 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm KCl at 25 °C (30Kaim G. Dimroth P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 937-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The residual Na+ concentration in the buffer was 0.13 mm. DeaminoNADH, NADH (potassium salt), and ACMA were obtained from Sigma. Protein was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method using the reagent obtained from Pierce. SDS-PAGE was performed with 10% polyacrylamide according to (31Schägger H. Jagow G.V. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10409) Google Scholar). The polypeptides were blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C Extra, Amersham Biosciences), and His-tagged proteins were identified by immunostaining using anti-His (4Walker J.E. Quart. Rev. Biophys. 1992; 25: 253-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar) antibodies (Qiagen). The C-terminally Truncated NuoL Subunit Increases the Na + Permeability of E. coli Membranes—Complex I (NDH I) from E. coli couples the oxidation of NADH with quinone to the translocation of Na+ (10Steuber J. Schmid C. Rufibach M. Dimroth P. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 428-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). An important goal is to identify the membranous complex I subunit(s) that participate in cation transport. A prime candidate is the hydrophobic NuoL subunit of complex I from E. coli (ND5 in Bos taurus, or Nqo12 in Paracoccus denitrificans) that exhibits striking sequence similarity to multicomponent Na+/H+ antiporters. A sequence alignment of the NuoL subunit from E. coli complex I with the MnhA subunit of the Na+/H+ antiporter from Staphylococcus aureus reveals 133 conserved amino acids in NuoL encompassing a total of 613 amino acid residues. Fig. 1 shows the putative topology of the NuoL subunit of E. coli complex I that is based on phylogenetic analyses and experimental data obtained for NuoL of Rhodobacter capsulatus complex I (32Mathiesen C. Hägerhäll C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The central region of the NuoL subunit encompassing transmembrane helices III to XIII exhibits the highest sequence similarity to Na+/H+ antiporters. The region from amino acid 1 to 369 encompasses 107 residues of the 133 amino acids that are fully conserved in the complete E. coli NuoL subunit and in the MnhA antiporter subunit from S. aureus. This portion of the NuoL subunit contains nine putative transmembrane helices (I-IX) and the amphipathic helices (X) and (XI) that are not assumed to traverse the membrane (32Mathiesen C. Hägerhäll C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Truncation of NuoL at R369 (Fig. 1) results in a shortened NuoL subunit that includes the conserved parts of the cytoplasmic loop between helices (XI) and XII. The gene fragment encoding for amino acid residues 1–369 was amplified by PCR and cloned into a low-copy expression vector that is repressed by glucose and derepressed by l-arabinose, resulting in vector pECL3. The truncated NuoL subunit (NuoLN) has a calculated molecular mass of 40,054 Da, compared with 66,440 Da of the NuoL subunit. In addition, a vector encoding for NuoLN encompassing an N-terminal Histag (His6-NuoLN) was constructed (pECL5). Detection of His6-NuoLN by immunostaining revealed that the protein was predominantly found in membranes of E. coli (Fig. 2). No signal was detected in cell-free extracts from E. coli in the absence of plasmid (not shown). Due to its hydrophobic nature, the truncated NuoL subunit showed an apparent molecular mass of only 33 kDa on SDS-PAGE.Fig. 2Localization of the C-terminally truncated NuoL subunit (His6-NuoLN) in E. coli membranes. His6-NuoLN was detected in cell fractions of E. coli DH5α after separation by SDS-PAGE and immunostaining using anti-His antibodies.

Cells were grown aerobically at 37 °C in phosphate-buffered Luria Bertani medium (pH 7.6) containing 10 mm glucose and 20, 110, or 140 mm KCl or NaCl. The optical density (OD) was followed at 600 nm for 24 h, and synthesis of the truncated NuoL subunit was induced by addition of 8 mm arabinose at A 0.5. A general trend observed with both E. coli strains was a decrease in final growth yield in pECL5 cells compared with the control cells at increasing salt concentrations (Table I). Both KCl and NaCl diminished the growth yield in the presence of His6-NuoLN, but NaCl showed a more drastic effect than KCl. In E. coli DH5α, growth in the presence of His6-NuoLN was impaired at 140 mm NaCl (final A 1.9, compared with A 8.8 with the control vector). This inhibition of growth was not accompanied by an apparent change in morphology. Growth of E. coli EP432 transformed with pECL5 encoding for His6-NuoLN was already inhibited at 110 mm NaCl (final A 1.0, compared with A 2.8 observed with the control vector). The increased toxicity of Na+ even in the absence of NuoLN observed with E. coli EP432 compared with E. coli DH5α is due to the lack of two Na+/H+ antiporters in strain EP432. In contrast to E. coli DH5α, Na+-induced growth inhibition of E. coli EP432 in the presence of His6-NuoLN was accompanied with an elongation and aggregation of cells. These morphological changes were not observed with E. coli EP432 growing in 140 mm KCl in the presence of NuoLN. A similar association of growth inhibition with cell elongation was observed with E. coli strain DK8 cells overproducing the truncated, membrane-bound subunit a of the proton-translocating F1F0 ATPase (33Eya S. Maeda M. Tomochika K. Kanemasa Y. Futai M. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6853-6858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Table IExpression of the C-terminally truncated NuoL subunit of complex I decreases the salt tolerance of E. coliNaCl or KClVectorE. coli strainSalt added20110140mMpISC3DH5αNaCl7.78.68.8KCl7.78.19.0EP432NaCl5.22.81.2KCl5.25.45.4pECL5DH5αNaCl3.33.21.9KCl3.03.22.8EP432NaCl3.01.0*0.6*KCl3.03.53.4 Open table in a new tab It is concluded that the NuoLN protein promotes ion leakage through the E. coli membranes, hereby dissipating electrochemical gradients across the cell membrane and diminishing the growth yield. The data indicate an increased permeability of the membranes for Na+ induced by the NuoLN protein. This was further investigated by following the Na+ influx into membrane vesicles from E. coli EP432 transformed with either pECL5 or pISC3. In the presence of NuoLN, the initial rate of Na+ uptake was 18 nmol mg–1 protein during the first 10 s, compared with 9 nmol Na+ mg–1 observed with the control membrane vesicles (Fig. 3). The addition of ubiquinone-1 (0.49 mm, oxidized form) to the assay did not stimulate the rate of Na+ transport by membrane vesicles containing the truncated NuoLN subunit. In six independent experiments, the uptake of Na+ was 2–4-fold higher in membrane vesicles containing NuoLN compared with the control (50–240 nmol Na+ min–1 mg–1, corrected for initial Na+ uptake by control vesicles), demonstrating that NuoLN enhances Na+ transport through native membranes with initial rates that are comparable with secondary Na+ transporters. For example, the purified, reconstituted Na+/H+ antiporter NhaA from E. coli has a specific activity of 600 nmol Na+ min–1 mg–1 (34Taglicht D. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11289-11294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An important question is whether the presence of the truncated NuoLN subunit in the cytoplasmic membrane of E. coli affects the assembly of complex I. The observed Na+ transport might be catalyzed by misassembled complex I containing the truncated NuoL subunit. The specific complex I activity of membrane vesicles was estimated from the oxidation of deaminoNADH with O2 as terminal electron acceptor. In contrast to NADH, which is oxidized both by complex I and the alternative, non-electrogenic NADH dehydrogenase (NDH II), deamino-NADH is preferentially oxidized by complex I and is used to distinguish between complex I and NDH II in E. coli membranes (35Friedrich T. Heek P.v. Leif H. Ohnishi T. Forche E. Kunze B. Jansen R. Trowitzsch-Kienast W. Höfle G. Reichenbach H. Weiss H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The rates of deaminoNADH oxidation by control membrane vesicles from E. coli EP432 (0.06 μmol min–1 mg–1) were comparable with the rates observed with membrane vesicles containing the truncated NuoL subunit (0.08 μmol min–1 mg–1). The rates of NADH oxidation by control membrane vesicles (0.36 μmol min–1 mg–1) were essentially identical to the rates observed with membrane vesicles containing NuoLN (0.38 μmol min–1 mg–1). The NuoLN protein did not diminish the activity of complex I in E. coli membranes, suggesting functional assembly of complex I despite the presence of its hydrophobic, truncated NuoL subunit. Na + -dependent Increase of Proton Permeability in Membranes Containing the C-terminally Truncated NuoL Subunit—Respiratory proton transport activity was studied in membrane vesicles from E. coli CP875 containing the His6-NuoLN protein that were energized by the addition of NADH as outlined above. E. coli contains two respiratory NADH:quinone oxidoreductases, the Na+-translocating NDH I or complex I (10Steuber J. Schmid C. Rufibach M. Dimroth P. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 428-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and the non-electrogenic NDH II. During aerobic growth, NADH is mainly oxidized by the NDH II (36Wackwitz B. Bongaerts J. Goodman S.D. Unden G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 262: 876-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and the quinol formed is oxidized by terminal oxidases under formation of an electrochemical proton gradient. E. coli membrane vesicles obtained by French press cell rupture are predominantly oriented inside-out (26Reenstra W.W. Patel L. Rottenberg H. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and the addition of NADH in the presence of oxygen results in the build-up of a proton motive force (inside positive). The NADH-driven proton transport into vesicles is followed by the quenching of ACMA fluorescence. Vesicles containing His6-NuoLN showed a strong, NADH-induced quench in the presence of KCl (20 mm), whereas the addition of NaCl (20 mm) prior to NADH diminished the quench signal by 30% (Fig. 4, upper panel). In contrast, the quenching of ACMA fluorescence was hardly affected by NaCl in membrane vesicles prepared from cells transformed with the control vector (Fig. 4, lower panel). The slight increase in proton permeability of the control membranes in the presence of Na+ was due to the activity of endogenous Na+/H+ antiporters from E. coli (24Pinner E. Kotler Y. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1729-1734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained with E. coli DH5α transformed with pECL3 encoding for the NuoLN protein (not shown). Note that the rates of NADH oxidation by membrane vesicles with O2 as terminal electron acceptor were not affected by NuoLN (0.34 μmol min–1 mg–1 in vesicles containing NuoLN, compared with 0.36 μmol min–1 mg–1 in control vesicles). The diminished proton gradient established during NADH oxidation by vesicles in the presence of NuoLN and Na+ ions provides a rationale for the Na+-dependent decrease in growth yield of E. coli cells producing the truncated NuoL subunit. Na + Transport by Reconstituted NuoL N and Inhibition by EIPA—The truncated, His-tagged NuoL subunit from E. coli complex I was solubilized, enriched by affinity chromatography (Fig. 2), and reconstituted into proteoliposomes. Addition of proteoliposomes containing His6-NuoLN to buffer in the presence of 5 mm NaCl resulted in a transient accumulation of Na+ inside the liposomes that was ∼6-fold higher compared with the control liposomes (Fig. 5). Internal Na+ concentrations were calculated assuming a liposome volume of 3–10 μl per mg lipid (37Boffelli D. Weber F.E. Compassi S. Werder M. Schulthess G. Hauser H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10784-10792Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). At the start of the reaction, the Na+ concentration in the lumen of the liposomes was 100–200 μm, corresponding to an initial chemical Na+ concentration gradient (ΔpNa+) of 80–100 mV (inside negative). The experiments were performed without respiratory substrates added, and the build-up of a transmembrane voltage, ΔΨ, was prevented by valinomycin/K+. The uptake of Na+ by reconstituted His6-NuoLN was driven by the chemical Na+ concentration gradient (ΔpNa+). After 30 s, the maximum Na+ concentration in the interior was 6–20 mm. This is in the range of the external Na+ concentration in the buffer and thus in accord with passive downhill transport of Na+ into the proteoliposomes mediated by His6-NuoLN. The initial uptake during the first 30 s was followed by an efflux of Na+ to the values observed with the control proteoliposomes (Fig. 5). Similar results were obtained with different preparations of NuoLN and different concentrations of proteoliposomes in the Na+ transport assay (not shown). The inhibition of the truncated NuoLN subunit by EIPA was investigated. EIPA is an amiloride analogue that inhibits eukaryotic Na+/H+ antiporters but not NhaA, the main Na+/H+ antiporter in E. coli (38Padan E. Schuldiner S. Konings W.N. Kaback H.R. Lolkema J.S. Handbook of Biological Physics. Elsevier, Amsterdam1996: 501-531Google Scholar). Na+ uptake by His6-NuoLN was drastically diminished in the presence of 100 μm EIPA, whereas the residual uptake of Na+ by the control proteoliposomes was not affected by EIPA (Fig. 5). This result suggests that the truncated NuoL subunit of complex I from E. coli shares features with Na+/H+ antiporters. Complex I is the largest redox-driven H+ pump in the respiratory chain. It is composed of a peripheral arm harboring one FMN and up to nine Fe/S clusters (5Yano T. Ohnishi T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and a membrane arm containing up to three ubiquinones (11Gemperli A.C. Dimroth P. Steuber J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33811-33817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 39Dröse S. Zwicker K. Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 40Nakashima Y. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Watanabe K. Naoki K. Hano N. Yoshikawa S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2002; 34: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Although the peripheral, NADH-oxidizing fragment of complex I has been studied intensively, the membrane part is a terra incognita that awaits its functional characterization. The dissection of the membranous fragment of complex I into functional units will be a prerequisite to identify the subunits and amino acid residues that contribute to H+ (or Na+) transport. The Na+-dependent complex I found in E. coli (10Steuber J. Schmid C. Rufibach M. Dimroth P. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 428-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and the related enterobacterium K. pneumoniae (11Gemperli A.C. Dimroth P. Steuber J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33811-33817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 12Gemperli A.C. Dimroth P. Steuber J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 839-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) serves as a model for the mitochondrial, H+-pumping enzyme. The high degree of similarity of the NuoL subunit (ND5 homologue) from complex I with subunit A from multicomponent cation/H+ antiporters has led to the speculation that NuoL provides (part of) a proton channel in complex I (19Hamamoto T. Hashimoto M. Hino M. Kitada M. Seto Y. Kudo T. Horikoshi K. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the observed sequence similarity contributes very little to the understanding of H+ (or Na+) transport by complex I, because the multicomponent cation/H+ antiporters are only poorly characterized with respect to function and catalytic activity. Evidence for Na+ transport by the C-terminally truncated NuoL subunit of complex I is presented here. The truncated NuoL subunit comprises most of the regions conserved between NuoL and the A subunit of the multicomponent antiporters belonging to the CPA3 family (22Saier M.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 354-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Because the truncated NuoL subunit was produced in E. coli in the presence of endogenous complex I, one cannot completely exclude that the observed Na+ transport was due to other complex I subunits copurified with His6-NuoLN on the affinity column. On the other hand, the solubilization of E. coli membranes with dodecylmaltoside under the applied conditions of pH and salt concentration cleaves and inactivates complex I (17Leif H. Sled V.D. Ohnishi T. Weiss H. Friedrich T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 538-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). It should also be noted that the specific complex I activity in native membranes was not affected by the presence of the truncated NuoL subunit. It is therefore considered very unlikely that the Na+ transport observed with reconstituted His6-NuoLN is catalyzed by misassembled complex I. The translocation of Na+ by the C-terminally truncated NuoL subunit of complex I from E. coli provides strong evidence for the participation of this subunit in cation transport through the membranous fragment of complex I. The Na+-translocating complex I from K. pneumoniae that exhibits high sequence similarity to E. coli complex I exclusively pumps Na+ at a ratio of 2 Na+/2 electrons (11Gemperli A.C. Dimroth P. Steuber J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33811-33817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Na+ transport by native complex I generates a transmembrane voltage that is not compensated by the counter-flow of protons (12Gemperli A.C. Dimroth P. Steuber J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 839-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Therefore, one would expect unidirectional transport of Na+ by NuoLN. On the other hand, the results presented herein suggest a Na+-dependent increase of proton permeability of membrane vesicles in the presence of NuoLN, which can be interpreted in terms of Na+/H+ antiport. Na+ uptake by reconstituted His6-NuoLN was followed by the extrusion of Na+, similar to results obtained with the reconstituted NhaA antiporter from E. coli (34Taglicht D. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11289-11294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Na+ transport by His-NuoLN was drastically diminished in the presence of EIPA, an amiloride derivative that acts as inhibitor against Na+/H+ antiporters. Note that EIPA also inhibits NADH oxidation by bovine complex I (41Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Sakamoto K. Matsuno-Yagi A. Miyoshi H. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It should be considered that the presence of NuoLN in E. coli host cells could result in an increase of the intracellular Na+ concentration, which in turn leads to the up-regulation of endogenous Na+/H+ antiporters (42Padan E. Venturi M. Gerchman Y. Dover N. Biochim. Biophs. Acta. 2001; 1505: 144-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). As a consequence, the Na+/H+ antiporter activity in membrane vesicles or enriched protein fractions could be higher in E. coli cells producing NuoLN compared with the control cells. Studies aimed at the determination of Na+ (or H+) transport stoichiometries using purified, reconstituted NuoLN are currently underway in this laboratory. Biochemical (18Sazanov L.A. Peak-Chew S.Y. Fearnley I.M. Walker J.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7229-7235Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and structural (43Sazanov L.A. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) studies with bovine complex I suggest that the large ND5 (NuoL) subunit might be situated at the distal end of the membrane-embedded arm of the L-shaped molecule together with the ND4 (NuoM) subunit. In complex I from E. coli, the N-terminal part of the NuoL subunit (helices I-XI) may be part of the Na+-translocating machinery, but electrogenic Na+ transport by the holo-complex probably requires the C-terminal NuoL domain (Fig. 6). Studies on site-directed mutants support a functional role of the C-terminal part of NuoL (helices XII-XVI) (Fig. 1). In human complex I, a substitution of glycine 465 (Gly-468 in E. coli complex I) in helix XIV with glutamate represents a primary mutation that causes Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (44Howell N. Halverson S. Burns J. McCullough D.A. Poulton J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1993; 53: 959-963PubMed Google Scholar). In the related Na+/H+ antiporter from Bacillus C-125, mutation of glycine 382 in helix XII to arginine results in an alkali-sensitive phenotype, indicating diminished activity of the Na+/H+ antiporter that confers alkali resistance in the wild type (19Hamamoto T. Hashimoto M. Hino M. Kitada M. Seto Y. Kudo T. Horikoshi K. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). A central question is how the endergonic transport of Na+ (or H+) by complex I is driven by the exergonic oxidation of NADH with quinone (Fig. 6). Two quinones (Q6 and Q8) were found in complex I from K. pneumoniae (11Gemperli A.C. Dimroth P. Steuber J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33811-33817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A quinone-binding site was identified in the vicinity of the NuoH (ND1), NuoB (PSST), and NuoD (49 kDa) subunits (45Dupuis A. Prieur I. Lunardi J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (bovine nomenclature in brackets). Based on comparisons of primary sequences and known high-resolution structures of Q-binding proteins, the binding of Q to the NuoL (ND5) subunit was postulated from a putative Q binding motif located in helix (XI) and the loop between helices XII and XIII (Fig. 1) (46Fisher N. Rich P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 1153-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Recently, Yagi and co-workers (41Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Sakamoto K. Matsuno-Yagi A. Miyoshi H. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) reported on the labeling of the ND5 subunit (NuoL homologue) of bovine complex I with a photoaffinity analogue of fenpyroximate, a specific inhibitor of complex I. Fenpyroximate is assumed to bind at or close to a quinone binding site. The labeling of complex I by the photoaffinity analogue of fenpyroximate was diminished by various complex I inhibitors including amiloride derivatives like EIPA. This result compares favorably with the observed inhibition of Na+ transport by the truncated NuoL subunit (ND5 homologue) of E. coli complex I in the presence of EIPA. Passive transport of Na+ by the truncated NuoL subunit was not stimulated by the addition of water-soluble ubiquinone-1 (oxidized form). It will now be important to analyze whether there is an endogenous quinone bound to the NuoL subunit of E. coli complex I, and whether it participates in redox-driven Na+ transport. E. coli strains were kindly provided by Etana Padan, Hebrew University of Jerusalem (E. coli EP432) and Alan Wolfe, Loyola University Chicago (E. coli CP875).

Tolerance of abyssal pressures by deep-sea fish is likely to depend in part on adaptive modifications of proteins. However, the types of structural modifications to proteins that allow function at high pressure have not been discovered. To elucidate the mechanisms of protein adaptation to high pressure, we cloned the α-skeletal actin cDNAs from two abyssal Coryphaenoides species, C. armatus and C. yaquinae, and identified three amino acid substitutions, V54A or L67P, Q137K, and A155S, that distinguish these abyssal actins from orthologs of α-actin from non-abyssal Coryphaenoides. These substitutions, Q137K and A155S, prevent the dissociation reactions of ATP and Ca2+ from being influenced by high pressure. In particular, the lysine residue at position 137 results in a much smaller apparent volume change in the Ca2+ dissociation reaction. The V54A or L67P substitution reduces the volume change associated with actin polymerization and has a role in maintaining the DNase I activity of actin at high pressure. Together, these results indicate that a few amino acid substitutions in key functional positions can adaptively alter the pressure sensitivity of a protein.

The deep-sea is typified by low temperature (1–4 °C), extremely high hydrostatic pressure, a lack of sunlight and a relatively low influx of utilizable organic material derived from primary production in surface waters. Among such environmental factors, hydrostatic pressure is thought to have the most influence on the vertical distribution of organisms and speciation in deep-sea (1France S.C. Mar. Biol. 1994; 118: 67-77Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 2France S.C. Kocher T.D. Mar. Biol. 1996; 126: 633-643Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 3Morita T. Mol. Phylogenet.

Fofonoff N.P. Deep-Sea. Res. 1976; 23: 109-111Google Scholar) and influences organism functions, especially those involving the formation of protein complexes, e.g. enzyme-substrate or protein-protein interaction (5Somero G.N.

Marine fish belonging to the genus Coryphaenoides known as rattails or grenadiers have been studied extensively as an excellent model in which to elucidate adaptation to the deep sea (5Somero G.N.

Developments in the Deep-Sea Biology. Blandford Press, London1979Google Scholar), because of their widespread bathymetric distribution up to a depth of about 6000 m (13Iwamoto T. Stein D.L. Occas. Pap. Calif. Acad. Sci. 1974; 111: 1-79Google Scholar). An important parameter to study in the context of pressure is the change in volume that accompanies such events as protein-ligand interactions and protein-protein interactions, for the sign and magnitude of the reaction volume change determine the reaction's sensitivity to pressure. Swezey and Somero (14Swezey R.R. Somero G.N. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 852-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) have investigated the volume change (δV) that is associated with the polymerization of G-actin to F-actin α-skeletal actin from C. armatus (abyssal species) and C. acrolepis (non-abyssal species). The δV of actin from C. armatus was much smaller, which is advantageous for a deep-sea habitat, than that from C. acrolepis (14Swezey R.R. Somero G.N. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 852-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Actin is the main component of the microfilament system in all eukaryotic cells and plays a central role in maintaining the cytoskeletal structure, cell motility, cell division, intracellular movements, and contractile processes (15Sheterline P. Clayton J. Sparrow J. Actin. 4th ed. Oxford University Press, New York1999Google Scholar, 16Pollard T.D. Blanchoin L. Mullins R.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 545-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). It is one of the most conserved proteins in eukaryotic cells, for example, α-skeletal actin proteins in carp and rat share 99.4% homology at the amino acid sequence level (17Watabe S. Hirayama Y. Imai J. Kikuchi K. Yamashita M. Fish. Sci. (Tokyo). 1995; 61: 998-1003Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 18Collins J.H. Elzinga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5915-5920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore surprising that differences in the δV of this highly conserved protein have been found between two species of Coryphaenoides that inhabit different niches. In this study, we have cloned and sequenced the α-skeletal actin cDNAs from two abyssal Coryphaenoides, C. armatus and C. yaquinae, of which C. yaquinae inhabits greater depths. These actins contain three unique amino acid substitutions compared with the previously sequenced α-skeletal actin from two non-abyssal Coryphaenoides, C. acrolepis and C. cinereus (19Morita T. Fish. Sci. (Tokyo). 2000; 66: 1150-1157Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Biochemical analyses of the α-actin molecules purified from the skeletal muscles of C. armatus, C. yaquinae, C. acrolepis, carp, and chicken show that these amino acid substitutions are responsible for the adaptation of α-actin to high pressures in abyssal species. Here we describe, for the first time, the mechanism of adaptation of deep-sea fishes to high pressures at the amino acid sequence level. Materials—C. acrolepis, C. armatus, and C. yaquinae were collected in large live-traps made from netting material by the R/V Soyo-maru of the National Research Institute of Fisheries Science. The sampling locations were 41–40.20′ N, 142–57.40′ E, 180 m for C. acrolepis (habitat depth, about 180–2000 m) and 44–00.70′ N, 145–22.20′ E, 3940 m for C. armatus (habitat depth, about 2700–5000 m), and 39–58.10′ N, 154–59.50′ E, 5600 m for C. yaquinae (habitat depth, about 4000–6400 m). Carp (Cyprinus carpio) and chicken samples were purchased from local stores. All samples were stored below –80 °C until use. Actin Protein—Actin was isolated from the skeletal muscle of each species according to Spudich and Watt (20Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and purified by gel-filtration chromatography over Sephadex G-200 in G buffer (0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, Tris-HCl, pH 7.8). Actins were converted into the Mg2+-G form as described previously (21Chen X. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11406-11414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 22Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2747-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Mg2+-G-actin was used immediately after its conversion from Ca2+-G-actin. Actins were stored in G buffer at 4 °C after purification and used within 3 days. The concentration of G-actin was determined spectrophotometrically using an absorption coefficient of 0.63 ml/mg at 290 nm. Polymerization, Critical Concentration, and δV Assembly—Polymerization of Mg2+-actin was initiated by adding KCl and MgCl2 to final concentrations of 50 and 2 mm, respectively. Polymerization was monitored by light scattering, with excitation and emission wavelengths both set at 400 nm at 4 °C in a high pressure cell with a high pressure pump (PCI-400 cell and TP-500 pump Teramecs Co. Ltd., Kyoto, Japan). The change in light scattering was recorded as a function of time. The critical concentration was determined as described previously (23Chen X. Cook R.K. Rubenstein P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1185-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 24Tobacman L.S. Brenner S.L. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8806-8812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The volume change (δV) in assembly of G-actin into F-actin was calculated by the method of Swezey and Somero (14Swezey R.R. Somero G.N. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 852-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Isolation of α-Skeletal Actin cDNAs from C. armatus and C. yaquinae—C. armatus and C. yaquinae muscle cDNA libraries were constructed, and α-skeletal actin cDNAs from each library were cloned as described previously (19Morita T. Fish. Sci. (Tokyo). 2000; 66: 1150-1157Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Structures of actin were prepared using the program MOLSCRIPT (25Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) with data from the Protein Data Bank (accession number 1ATN). Phylogenetic Analysis—A molecular phylogenetic tree was constructed from the sequences of the actin coding regions. The DNADIST and NEIGHBOR programs in the PHYLIP version 3.5 program package (26Felsenstein J. Cladistics. 1986; 5: 164-166Google Scholar) were used for neighbor joining (27Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 45: 406-425Google Scholar). Bootstrap analyses with 1000 replicates were performed to examine the confidence of nodes within the resultant topology. Molecular phylogenetic analysis showed that α-actin genes from the Coryphaenoides species were categorized into three types, actin 1, actin 2a, and actin 2b (see “Results”). The GenBank™ accession numbers of actin nucleotide sequences used in this study are give in parentheses: C. armatus 2a (AB086240), C. armatus 2b (AB086241), C. yaquinae 2a (AB086242), C. yaquinae 2b (AB086243), C. acrolepis 1 (AB021649), C. acrolepis 2a (AB021650), C. cinereus 1 (AB021651), C. cinereus 2a (AB021652); carp, C. carpio (D50025); medaka, Oryzias latipes (D87740); fugu 1, Fugu rubripes (U38850), fugu 2 (U38958); goldfish, Carassius auratus (D50029); tilapia, Oreochromis mossambicus (AB037866); zebrafish, Danio rerio (AF180887); chum salmon, Oncorhynchus keta (AB032464); Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar (AF304406); chicken, Gallus gallus (K02257); human, Homo sapiens (M20543); mouse, Mus musculus (M12234); rat, Rattus norvegicus (V01218); and bovine, Bos taurus (U02285). Medaka β-actin (D89627) was used as the outgroup gene. Quantification of Actin Isoforms—To identify the ratio of the α-actin isoforms, quantitative polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcription (RT-PCR) 1The abbreviations used are: RT, reverse transcription; δV, volume change; Quin 2, 8-amino-2-[(2-amino-5-methylphenoxy)methyl]-6-methoxyquinoline-N, N, N′, N′-tetraacetic acid; V #, activation volume; ϵ-ATP, 1,N 6-etheno-ATP. and two-dimensional electrophoresis were performed. These analyses were repeatedly done four times using total RNAs, and actin proteins were isolated from four individuals in each species. The conditions for RT-PCR were as described previously (19Morita T. Fish. Sci. (Tokyo). 2000; 66: 1150-1157Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar), except for the cycle number. The cycle number within a linear range of PCR amplification was determined to be 25 on the basis of the signal intensities of RT-PCR products with sequential cycles. The primer 5′-ATTGCTGACCGYATGCAGAA-3′ and NOT-1 d(T)18 primer amplified ∼480 bp and 680 bp, for actin 1 and actin 2b, respectively. RT-PCR products were subjected to 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. Two-dimensional electrophoresis was performed by Multiphor II electrophoresis unit with a pH range of 4.0–7.0 or 5.0–6.0 gel (24 cm) and 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel (Amersham Biosciences). The ratios of actin 2b to actin 2a, or actin 1 to actin 2a, were quantified using a computerized image analysis scanner STORM 860 (Amersham Bioscience). Quin 2 Assay—The dissociation rate constant of Ca2+ from actin was determined by assaying the fluorescence intensity increase of Quin 2 (8-amino-2-[(2-amino-5-methylphenoxy)methyl]-6-methoxyquinoline-N, N, N′, N′-tetraacetic acid) (28Kinosian H.J. Selden L.A. Estes J.E. Gershman L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8683-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+-actin (5 μm) prepared by dialysis against G-buffer (free CaCl2) was added to 100 μm Quin 2 and 0.2 mm MgCl2, and the fluorescence was measured at respective excitation and emission wavelengths of 340 and 500 nm at 4 °C in a high pressure cell. For reaction rates, the relevant thermodynamic equation is, δln k/δP = –δV #/RT, where k is the rate constant for the reaction, P is the pressure, V # is activation volume, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature (29Morild E. Adv. Protein Chem. 1981; 34: 93-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The apparent binding rate constant and the apparent volume change (δV #) of the Ca2+ dissociation reaction were determined as described previously (29Morild E. Adv. Protein Chem. 1981; 34: 93-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 30Waechter F. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 57: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Nucleotide Exchange Assay—The apparent binding rate constant of ϵ-ATP (1,N 6-etheno-ATP) on actin was determined by displacing bound ATP with a large molar excess of ϵ-ATP such that the back reaction, ATP binding to actin, became negligible (28Kinosian H.J. Selden L.A. Estes J.E. Gershman L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8683-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Actin (9 μm) prepared by dialysis against G-buffer (free ATP) was converted into Mg2+-G-actin and added to ϵ-ATP (0.1 mm), and the fluorescence was measured at respective excitation and emission wavelengths of 340 and 410 nm at 4 °C in a high pressure cell. The apparent binding constant and the apparent δV # in the ATP dissociation reaction were determined as described previously (29Morild E. Adv. Protein Chem. 1981; 34: 93-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 30Waechter F. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 57: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Intrinsic Tryptophan Fluorescence—The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectrum of Ca2+-G-actin at 6.25 μm was recorded using a high pressure cell at respective excitation and emission wavelengths of 290 and 320–360 nm at 4 °C (31Lehrer S.S. Kerwar G. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 1211-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). DNase I Inhibition Assay—The DNase I inhibition assay was performed as described previously (32Blikstad I. Markey F. Carlsson L. Persson T. Lindberg U. Cell. 1978; 15: 935-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). In brief, DNase I, either alone or combined with G-actin at various actin/DNase I ratios, was added to a control or salmon sperm DNA solution (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 4 mm MgSO4, 1.8 mm CaCl2), and the change in absorbance at 260 nm was recorded continuously at 20 °C in a high pressure cell. DNase I activity was calculated from the linear part of the plot of the increase in A 260 versus time. Actin Polymerization and Volume Change—We measured the polymerization kinetics of α-skeletal actin isolated from each species as a function of pressure at various actin concentrations by light scattering assay. Actins from all species except carp underwent polymerization at each pressure; carp actin polymerized only at pressures of 20 MPa or less. The half-time to steady state in polymerization and critical concentrations were determined from the polymerization kinetics (Fig. 1A). The half-times for all actins increased with high pressure, and at atmospheric pressure the polymerization half-time was shortest for carp. The half-times for chicken and non-abyssal actin species increased markedly above 20 MPa and, at 60 MPa were, respectively, about 5.6- and 7.3-fold higher than at atmospheric pressure. By contrast, the half-time of actin polymerization for the two abyssal species had increased only about 2.7-fold at 60 MPa (Fig. 1A). The critical concentrations of actin also increased with high pressure for each species (Fig. 1B). The critical concentrations of the two abyssal actin species were higher than those of other species at 20 MPa and lower pressures, and increased slightly from 0.1 to 60 MPa. The volume change (δV) associated with polymerization at each pressure was determined from the respective critical concentrations (Fig. 1C). The two abyssal actin species had a much smaller δV at each pressure than did the other species, in agreement with previous reports (14Swezey R.R. Somero G.N. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 852-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The δV of actins from chicken and non-abyssal species decreased at high pressure, whereas those from the abyssal species showed little variation. These observations indicated that, for chicken and non-abyssal species, the coefficient of compressibility for F-actin was larger than that for G-actin and that the space produced by actin-actin interactions was reduced by high pressure. Clearly, there was no such reduction in space in actins from the abyssal species. Unexpectedly, the δV of carp actin, unlike that of other species, increased with high pressure, which indicated that for carp the coefficient of compressibility for G-actin was larger than that for F-actin; in other words, carp G-actin is softer than the G-actin of the other species. Thus, this would explain why carp actin was able to polymerize at pressures of only 20 MPa or less. cDNA Cloning and Deduced Amino Acid Sequences—Two α-skeletal actin isoforms were cloned from each of the two abyssal species and compared with the two non-abyssal actin species reported previously (19Morita T. Fish. Sci. (Tokyo). 2000; 66: 1150-1157Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Molecular phylogenic analysis showed that these four α-actin genes from the abyssal species were all categorized as actin 2. These categorizations were supported with the comparatively high bootstrap value (72%) (Fig. 2A). Therefore, the isoform with an identical amino acid sequence to that of actin 2 of the non-abyssal species was designated actin 2a, and the other was designated aemactin 2b and yaqactin 2b for C. armatus and C. yaquinae, respectively. Consequently, the non-abyssal actin 2 was re-designated actin 2a. The amino acid sequences of actin 1 and 2a differ by one amino acid residue at position 155, which is Ala-155 in actin 1 and Ser-155 in actin 2a (19Morita T. Fish. Sci. (Tokyo). 2000; 66: 1150-1157Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The sequence of actin 2b differs from that of actin 2a by two amino acids (either V54A or L67P and Q137K) (Table I). The x-ray crystallography structure of rabbit skeletal muscle actin shows that residues 54 and 67 are located in a β-sheet of subdomain 2 (residues 33–69), whereas residues 137 and 155 are located in the Ca2+- and ATP-binding sites, respectively (Fig. 3, A and B) (33Kabsch W.

Quantitative RT-PCR was carried out with one primer set, which amplified different length products from the two isoforms, about 480 bp for actin 1 and actin 2b, and about 680 bp for actin 2a, owing to the different lengths of their 3′ non-coding regions (Fig. 2B). Direct sequencing confirmed that the RT-PCR products were the expected actin isoforms. The results showed that there was differential expression of the two isoforms in each species. The expression ratio of actin 2b to actin 2a, or actin 1 to actin 2a, was 4.3 ± 0.18 for C. yaquinae, 4.1 ± 0.083 for C. armatus, and 0.67 ± 0.034 for C. acrolepis, respectively. We examined further the ratio of protein isoforms using two-dimensional electrophoresis. The abundance ratio of actin 2b to actin 2a was 4.8 ± 0.087 for C. yaquinae (Fig. 2C) and 4.5 ± 0.18 for C. armatus (data not shown), respectively. The protein isoforms from C. acrolepis, which have the same isoelectric point estimated, could not be separated by this electrophoresis method (data not shown). These results of the electrophoresis were not affected by dephosphorylation using Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase (data not shown). These ratios reflect higher expression of the isoform that is more essential for the species habitat, as described below. Quin 2 and Nucleotide Exchange Assay—Sequence analysis showed that, although actin 2b from abyssal species has a lysine at position 137, the other isoform and all actins from the other species have a glutamine at this position, and all actin isoforms from abyssal species have a serine at residue 155. Actin binds ATP by sandwiching the ATP β- and γ-phosphates between two structurally equivalent β-hairpins (residues 11–18 and 154–161), which belong to homologous subdomains 1 and 3 (Fig. 3, A and B) (33Kabsch W. Mannherz H.G. Suck D. Pai E.F. Holmes K.C. Nature. 1990; 347: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar, 34Otterbein L.R. Graceffa P. Dominguez R. Science. 2001; 293: 708-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Actin also contains a tightly bound divalent cation (Ca2+ or Mg2+) in a deep hydrophilic pocket formed by the β- and γ-phosphates of the bound ATP and actin residues Asp-11, Gln-137, and Asp-154 (Fig. 3, A and B) (33Kabsch W. Mannherz H.G. Suck D. Pai E.F. Holmes K.C. Nature. 1990; 347: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar, 35Estes J.E. Selden L.A. Kinosian H.J. Gershman L.C. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1992; 13: 272-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Although actin has a higher affinity for Ca2+ than for Mg2+, the much higher cellular concentration of Mg2+ means that it will be the main occupant of the divalent cation site in vivo. We also investigated the effect of high pressures on the divalent cation and nucleotide binding of actin protein at various pressures (Fig. 4, A and B). Surprisingly, both dissociation rate constants of actin from abyssal species were much less affected by high pressures than those of the other actins, which increased rapidly at pressures greater than 20 MPa. The dissociation rate constant of Ca2+ in abyssal actins did not differ greatly from that of the other actins at atmospheric pressure, which means that the actins bind to Ca2+ with almost the same strength, whereas the differences in the dissociation rate constant of ATP suggest that Ser-155 actin binds ATP more tightly than Ala-155 actin, as pointed out previously (19Morita T. Fish. Sci. (Tokyo). 2000; 66: 1150-1157Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The apparent δV # value in the Ca2+ dissociation reaction at pressures greater than 20 MPa was estimated as –4.27 ± 1.86 cm3 mol–1 for abyssal species and –154.3 ± 0.583 cm3 mol–1 for the other species. The apparent δV # in the ATP dissociation reaction at more than 20 MPa was also determined to be –43.4 ± 0.47 cm3 mol–1 or more for abyssal actin, and as –80.4 ± 1.44, –90.0 ± 1.59, and –84.2 ± 0.995 cm3 mol–1 for chicken, carp, and non-abyssal actin, respectively. These results indicated that the smaller effect in both dissociation rate constants of pressure in abyssal actin results from Q137K and the differences in both constants among carp, chicken, and non-abyssal species from A155S. Effects of Pressure on Intrinsic Tryptophan Fluorescence Spectrum—Actin contains four tryptophan residues (at positions 74, 86, 340, and 356), which are all located in subdomain 1. The emission maximum of fluorescing tryptophan residues is 350 nm in a neutral water solution but shifts to shorter wavelengths in a hydrophobic environment, such as the interior of a folded protein (36Kuznetsova I.M. Yakusheva T.A. Turoverov K.K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To investigate effect of pressures on the actin structure, we measured the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectrum of Ca2+-G-actin at various pressures. Although the emission maximum did not shift, the fluorescence intensity of actins from chicken, carp, and non-abyssal species began to decrease at only 10 MPa (data not shown), and in particular the decrease for carp actin was larger than that for chicken and non-abyssal actin; by contrast, the fluorescence of the abyssal actins did not change even at 60 MPa (Fig. 5, A and B). Actin affinity for Ca2+ is greater than for Mg2+, but there were no differences in fluorescence intensity between the Ca2+- and Mg2+-G-actin forms for all actin species (data not shown). These results indicate that high pressure changes the environment of the tryptophan residues in actin; in other words, the structure of actin subdomain 1, which includes one of the β-hairpins that sandwiches the ATP β-and γ-phosphates and the Ca2+-binding sites. DNase I Inhibition Assay—Actin 2b of the two abyssal species contains either a V54A substitution or an L67P substitution (Table I). The x-ray crystallography structure shows that these residues are located in subdomain 2 (residues 33–69) (Fig. 3A). In actin-DNase I interactions, DNase I primarily contacts the DNase I-binding loop (residues 40–48) in subdomain 2 and interacts slightly with Thr-203 and Glu-207 in subdomain 4 (residues 181–269) (33Kabsch W.

We, therefore, sought to determine the generalized involvement of sphingolipids in the heat stress response by using microarray hybridization of RNA isolated from heat-stressed cultures of the mutant strain lcb1–100, which is unable to produce sphingolipids in response to heat. Approximately 70 genes showed differential regulation during the first 15 min of heat stress in the lcb1–100 strain compared with the wild type strain, indicating a requirement for de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis for proper regulation of these genes during heat stress. Grouping these genes into functional categories revealed several pathways, including some in which sphingolipids were previously suspected to play a role, such as stress response pathways and cell cycle regulation. Hierarchical clustering analysis revealed sphingolipid involvement in regulation of tRNA synthesis and metabolic genes and transporters. Additionally, the microarray results demonstrated novel sphingolipid involvement in transcriptional regulation of pathways of translation and cell wall organization and biogenesis. Our results demonstrate a broad-reaching effect of sphingolipids in the yeast heat stress response and suggest that the mechanism of sphingolipid involvement in several cellular pathways occurs via sphingolipid-mediated regulation of message levels.

Extensive research on the heat stress response (HSR) 1The abbreviations used are: HSR, heat stress response; ORF, open reading frame; wt, wild type; APC, anaphase promoting complex; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; STRE, stress response element. in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has revealed several pathways that are significantly altered in response to heat stress, such as pathways of carbohydrate metabolism, expression of chaperonins, cell cycle progression, and ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation (reviewed in Refs. 1Estruch F. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 24: 469-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 2Piper P. Hohmann S., and Mager, J.W. Yeast Stress Responses. Chapman and Hall, Austin1997Google Scholar). These adaptive changes occur rapidly in response to heat and are mediated both by post-translational enzyme modifications (e.g. phosphorylation and dephosphorylation) and transcriptional induction and/or repression (1Estruch F. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 24: 469-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Thevelein J. de Winde J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 904-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Although many of these changes are recognized as HSR subprograms, the mechanisms connecting a detection by cells of elevated temperature to these downstream changes in transcription remain largely undetermined. With the advent of genomic technology, yeast stress responses were among the first experimental targets (4Causton H.C. Ren B. Koh S.S. Harbison C.T. Kanin E. Jennings E.G. Lee T.I. True H.L. Lander E.S. Young R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 323-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar, 5Gasch A.P. Spellman P.T. Kao C.M. Carmel-Harel O. Eisen M.B. Storz G. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4241-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (3756) Google Scholar). These earlier studies demonstrated the full complement of gene regulatory events that take place during many types of stress. Specific microarray experiments aimed at detecting changes in transcript levels during heat stress revealed that nearly 1500 of the total 6000 yeast genes are regulated by heat, and the regulation of some of these genes is consistent with findings of earlier studies of yeast heat stress, such as the induction of transcription of genes encoding heat shock proteins (5Gasch A.P. Spellman P.T. Kao C.M. Carmel-Harel O. Eisen M.B. Storz G. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4241-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (3756) Google Scholar). Previous studies have additionally demonstrated that a key feature of the HSR in S. cerevisiae is the acute up-regulation of de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis (6Wells G.B. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7235-7243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 7Dickson R.C. Nagiec E.E. Wells G.B. Nagiec M.M. Lester R.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 32566-32572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Indeed, work in recent years has revealed the crucial role of sphingolipids in many eukaryotic cell stress responses (9Sawai H. Hannun Y.A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 102: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 10Mathias S. Pena L. Kolesnick R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 465-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 11Hannun Y.A. Luberto C. Argraves K.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4893-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Although many of these studies have been conducted in mammalian cell systems, the high degree of conservation of sphingolipid metabolic pathways from yeast to mammals allows yeast to be a useful model system for studying sphingolipid activities and, furthermore, underscores the fundamental importance of these pathways in eukaryotic cell biology. The first and rate-limiting step of sphingolipid biosynthesis, the generation of a sphingoid base from palmitoyl CoA and serine, is catalyzed by serine palmitoyltransferase. In yeast, this enzyme is composed of two subunits, Lcb1p and Lcb2p, which are both necessary for activity (12Nagiec M.M. Baltisberger J.A. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7899-7902Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Yeast strains without serine palmitoyltransferase activity are not viable; thus, the isolation of a temperature-sensitive mutant, lcb1–100, provided a critical tool for the study of sphingolipid function in yeast, particularly with respect to heat stress (13Munn A. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 373-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Thus, although under normal laboratory conditions, sphingolipid metabolism is similar in wild type (wt) and the lcb1–100 strain, upon heat stress, this mutation blocks de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis (14Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8574-8581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Consequently, this strain is an ideal tool for the dissection of the role(s) of sphingolipids in the HSR. To obtain a more complete view of sphingolipid involvement in the heat stress response and to identify sphingolipid-dependent HSR events, we evaluated gene expression over a time course of heat stress in wild type yeast and the lcb1–100 strain. Our results indicate that sphingolipid production broadly influences the expression of genes involved in diverse cellular pathways including regulation of translation machinery, amino acid metabolism, and cycle control. Furthermore, although microarrays have been used extensively to document stress responses in yeast, we demonstrate the use of microarray technology combined with yeast molecular genetics to specifically dissect the sphingolipid-dependent pathways and events of the HSR. Laboratory strain RH406 (MAT a leu2 trp1 ura3 bar1) and the lcb1–100 mutant (MAT a leu2 trp1 ura3 bar1 lcb1 temperature-sensitive) were a generous gift from Dr. Howard Riezman. Cultures were seeded at low density and grown at 30 °C to mid-log phase (A 600 = 0.5–0.7). Cultures were then transferred to 39 °C for the appropriate times, cells were centrifuged at 500 × g at 4 °C, and pellets were rinsed one time in ice-cold sterile water. Total RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy kit (Valencia, CA) and the enzymatic lysis protocol according to instructions from the manufacturer. Sample preparation for microarray hybridization was carried out essentially as described in the Affymetrix Expression Analysis Technical Manual. In brief, isolated total RNA was subjected to reverse transcription using the Superscript Choice system (Invitrogen), and the derived double-stranded cDNA was purified using phase-lock gel columns (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) followed by ethanol precipitation or the cDNA clean up columns provided by Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA). The purified cDNA was then subjected to in vitro transcription using biotinylated ribonucleotides in the BioArray™ HighYield™ RNA transcript labeling kit (Enzo Diagnostics, Farmingdale, NY). The biotinylated transcript was purified using the RNEasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and then fragmented using 0.2 m Tris acetate, pH 8.1, containing 0.5 m potassium acetate and 0.15 m magnesium acetate. Fragmentation was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis using ethidium bromide for visualization. Samples were then hybridized to the YG-S98 yeast genome chip (Affymetrix), stained with streptavidinphycoerythrin and washed in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station exactly as indicated in the Affymetrix Expression Analysis Technical Manual. Genechips were scanned using the Affymetrix scanner. Fluorescence values were statistically analyzed to yield gene expression signal values using Microarray Suite 5.0. Experimental integrity was confirmed by verification of expected values for internal control probe sets, including sets for “spikes” (BioA, BioB, BioC), ratios of signals between probe sets designed with 3′ or 5′ bias for ACT1 (β-actin), and absence of internal negative controls including murine genes. Absolute analysis was conducted for each time point with scaling to a target value of 2500 to facilitate comparison between experiments. Genechip data from 15-, 30-, and 60-min time points was analyzed by comparison to the non-stressed control (t = 0) by using the control data as a base line. For the 15-min time point data, the change call yielded by MAS 5.0 was used to identify genes that had a change call of either “I” (increase) or “D” (decrease) in wt, but either “NC” (no change) or the opposite change (i.e. I in wt but D in mutant or vice versa) in mutant, or either a significantly muted increase or decrease in mutant (i.e. 2-fold or greater difference) in both of two independent experiments. In all analyses, stringency was set using default values. Probe Selection—A subset of data returned by the MAS 5.0 program representing genes with differential expression in wt versus lcb1–100 were subjected to hierarchical clustering based on the ratio of lcb1–100 signal to wt signal at each time point. This subset was obtained by first selecting all probe sets which (a) had a signal p value from MAS 5.0 software representing a high degree of certainty of signal accuracy, and (b) had wild type signals over the entire time course, which were sufficiently different from the mutant signal values. The methods used to determine whether probe sets met these criteria are described below. Clustering Analysis—Cluster analysis of lcb1–100 signal to wt signal ratios over the time course was performed with selected probe sets using Euclidean distances and unweighted pair-group average linkage as implemented in Matlab Statistical Toolbox functions (Mathworks, Inc., version 6.5, release 13). Northern blotting was carried out using standard protocols. In brief, 5 μg of RNA was run on formaldehyde denaturing gel, transferred to Zeta-probe membrane (Bio-Rad) using capillary transfer in 20× SSC buffer, UV cross-linked, and prehybridized with ExpressHyb buffer (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). RNA-specific probes were derived from standard reverse transcription-PCR reactions using gene-specific primers to amplify cDNAs. Probes were random labeled with a [32P]dCTP using the Prime-It II kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Hybridization was performed at 68 °C for at least 3 h, and membranes were washed according to protocols suggested in the ExpressHyb product information. Membranes were autoradiographed at –80 °C prior to development of film. Heat stress in yeast leads to transcriptional regulation of genes involved in many biochemical pathways including those of carbohydrate metabolism, protein folding, and protein degradation. At time points early in heat stress (15–60 min), a dramatic increase of sphingolipids is observed, with sphingoid bases and their phosphates increasing first, followed by increases in ceramide (6Wells G.B. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7235-7243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 8Jenkins G.M. Richards A. Wahl T. Mao C. Obeid L. Hannun Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 8574-8581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Mutants deficient in sphingolipid biosynthesis are also deficient in several aspects of the heat stress response, including cell cycle arrest (14Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8574-8581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation (15Chung N. Jenkins G. Hannun Y.A. Heitman J. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17229-17232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Furthermore, treatment of yeast cells with exogenous sphingolipids induces cell cycle arrest and ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation (16Nickels J.T. Broach J.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 382-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 17Chung N. Mao C. Heitman J. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35614-35621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) as well as STRE-dependent transcription (18Dickson R.C. Nagiec E.E. Skrzypek M. Tillman P. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30196-30200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that sphingolipids generated de novo in response to heat lead to downstream events mediating changes in gene regulation. To develop this hypothesis, we used microarrays to investigate sphingolipid-dependent gene regulation. Because of a temperature-sensitive mutation in the LCB1 gene, which encodes a subunit of serine palmitoyltransferase, the yeast strain lcb1–100 does not demonstrate heat-induced de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis (14Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8574-8581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). By using gene chip data to compare the transcriptional response to heat of the lcb1–100 mutant strain with its wild type background strain, RH406, we were able to identify transcriptional responses to heat that require heat-induced sphingolipid biosynthesis. Most transcriptional adaptation to heat during the HSR in yeast takes place within 1 h of transfer of log-phase yeast cultures from normal to elevated temperature (5Gasch A.P. Spellman P.T. Kao C.M. Carmel-Harel O. Eisen M.B. Storz G. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4241-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (3756) Google Scholar). Cultures of lcb1–100 yeast and their background strain, RH406, were grown to mid-log phase at 30 °C, and then aliquots were transferred to 39 °C for 15, 30, or 60 min. One aliquot was not transferred and served as a control. RNA was isolated from these samples and subjected to microarray hybridization and analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The chip used for hybridization (YB-S98, Affymetrix) contained probes directed toward every known ORF in the yeast genome. Previous studies have demonstrated that, upon heat stress, the acute synthesis of sphingoid bases (C18 and C20 dihydrosphingosine and phytosphingosine) proceeds early, with peak levels reached by 15 min (6Wells G.B. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7235-7243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 8Jenkins G.M. Richards A. Wahl T. Mao C. Obeid L. Hannun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32566-32572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Significant production of phytoceramides via N-acylation of sphingoid bases occurs only after 20–60 min (6Wells G.B. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7235-7243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 8Jenkins G.M. Richards A. Wahl T. Mao C. Obeid L. Hannun Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 8574-8581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 18Dickson R.C. Nagiec E.E. Skrzypek M. Tillman P. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30196-30200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). It is likely that synthesis of complex sphingolipids from phytoceramides occurs at even later time points. We initially chose to focus our studies on the early time point of heat stress, 15 min, as those gene regulatory events are likely to depend specifically and directly on the initial generation of sphingoid bases and less on downstream metabolic products, including phytoceramides, or secondary transcriptional events. The data set of all genes regulated in response to heat in the wild type strain was obtained by performing a comparative analysis of all differences between the chip hybridized to RNA isolated from non-heat-stressed cells and the chip hybridized to RNA isolated from cells stressed for the various time periods. A similar analysis was then performed on RNA isolated from the lcb1–100 mutant. In a second level of analysis, the two data sets were compared, i.e. heat-regulated genes in the wt versus heat-regulated genes in the lcb1–100 strain. The differences were then tabulated such that any gene that changed in the wild type strain after heat stress but was significantly differently regulated in the lcb1–100 mutant in each of two independent experiments was considered. The heat stress, RNA isolation, and microarray hybridizations were performed twice for the 0- and 15-min time points, and only genes that showed similar change calls in the MAS 5.0 software in both experiments were considered for further analysis. A total of 70 genes demonstrated significantly altered regulation in the lcb1–100 in response to heat, based on the following criteria: 1) a change call from the Microarray Suite program of “increase” or “decrease” in wt and 2) at least 2-fold difference in change ratio between the lcb1–100 and the wt strain. The change ratio is the ratio of the expression signal at 15 min to the control (i.e. 0 min). This system isolated genes falling in one of the following two categories: 1) genes induced in wt but either not changed, repressed, or showing highly muted induction (at least 2-fold less) in the mutant; and 2) genes repressed in wt but either not changed, induced, or showing highly muted repression (at least 2-fold less) in the wt. To be included in the set of aberrantly regulated genes, reproducibility with respect to signals from each of two independent experiments as well as the relationship between mutant and wt expression changes with heat stress must be observed. Of the 70 genes with altered regulation in the lcb1–100 strain, 29 displayed either an absolute failure to induce, or, more often, much milder induction than that observed in the RH406 wt strain (see Table II). The remainder of the altered genes (41Martin M.P. Gerlach V.L. Brow D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6429-6439Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) were repressed upon heat stress in RH406 but not effectively repressed in lcb1–100 (Table I).

This suggests one of the following possibilities: 1) that early regulatory events precipitate large transcriptional changes evident at later time points, and/or 2) that lipid metabolites downstream of sphingoid base formation (i.e. phosphorylated sphingoid bases, ceramides, diacylglycerol, and complex sphingolipids) have their own effects on transcription, which are evident as these downstream species accumulate over the time course. It is likely that a combination of these two factors leads to dramatic gene misregulation over the time course; however, these factors complicate the interpretation of regulatory events occurring at later time points. To facilitate data interpretation, we therefore considered only the 15-min time point for manual analysis, and to obtain an idea of the broader effects of the lcb1–100 mutation on heat-mediated gene regulation, we used hierarchical clustering for time-course data (0-, 15-, 30-, and 60-min time points; see below). Next, functional information on each gene was obtained utilizing a variety of resources, including the Gene Ontology Consortium data base (www.geneontology.org), the Stanford Saccharomyces Genome Data Base (genome-www.stanford.edu/saccharomyces/), and literature searches. For the current analysis, only protein-encoding ORFs were considered, although there were many non-protein-encoding RNAs differentially expressed in the lcb1–100 mutant. Classification of protein-encoding genes based on function was performed for genes demonstrating failed induction in the lcb1–100 mutant (i.e. sphingolipid-dependent heat induction) and for genes demonstrating failed repression in the lcb1–100 mutant (i.e. sphingolipid dependent heat repression). Interestingly, most of the misregulated genes fell into discrete categories with respect to biochemical pathway and/or cellular function. Categories selected for discussion below showed marked changes, i.e. several genes in one pathway showing faulty regulation at the 15-min time point. Categorization into groups based on cellular function demonstrated that a variety of cell functions depend on sphingolipid biosynthesis for heat adaptation, including regulation of message for metabolic enzymes, proteins involved in cell cycle control, amino acid metabolism, and protein synthesis (Fig. 1). Although microarray studies have been utilized to investigate heat-induced gene regulation in yeast (4Causton H.C. Ren B. Koh S.S. Harbison C.T. Kanin E. Jennings E.G. Lee T.I. True H.L. Lander E.S.

Cell. 2000; 11: 4241-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (3756) Google Scholar), the breadth of transcriptional reprogramming in response to heat has not been specifically addressed. Indeed, the roles of many of these pathways in adaptation to heat remain to be investigated. A number of pathways for which genes were misregulated in the lcb1–100 strain are pathways in which previous studies have already demonstrated sphingolipid involvement. In most of these cases, very little mechanistic information is known. In addition to pathways with known sphingolipid involvement, the results demonstrate novel roles for sphingolipids in pathways for which there is no previous knowledge of sphingolipid involvement. Amino Acid Metabolism—In yeast, heat stress signals the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of several nutrient permeases (17Chung N. Mao C. Heitman J. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35614-35621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Previous work has demonstrated that heat-induced degradation of nutrient permeases is dependent on sphingolipid biosynthesis in response to heat, and furthermore, that in the absence of heat, exogenously applied sphingoid bases inhibit amino acid import and induce degradation of the uracil permease Fur4p and the general permease Gap1p, and that this activity is dependent upon ubiquitylation (15Chung N.

It is presently unknown whether the Ets family of transcription factors control p21WAF1/Cip1 gene expression. Ets-1 inhibits apoptosis in vascular smooth muscle cells as determined by both fluorescein isothiocyanate-linked annexin V/propidium iodide staining of cells and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis and quantitative cytoplasmic histone-associated internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. p21WAF1/Cip1 can play a mitogenic and anti-apoptotic role in smooth muscle cells. Using transient transfection and Western blot analysis, we determined that Ets-1 activates p21WAF1/Cip1 transcription and protein expression. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that Ets-1 interacts selectively with the –1350GGAA–1347 Ets element in the p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter. Mutation of this element reduced basal and Ets1-inducible p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter-dependent expression. In contrast, the –1577GGAT–1574 motif mediates basal but not Ets-1 activation of the p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter. Co-immunoprecipitation and co-transfection analysis showed that Ets-1 binds p300 and cooperatively activates p21WAF1/Cip1 transcription. The phenotypic importance of Ets-1 regulation of p21WAF1/Cip1 was demonstrated by the capacity of antisense p21WAF1/Cip1 strategies to block Ets-1-inhibition of apoptosis and inhibit Ets-1-induction of proliferation.

The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/Cip1 was first identified through its interaction with Cdk2 (1Harper J.W. Adami G. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5250) Google Scholar) and its regulation of wild-type p53 activity (2El-Deiry W. Tokino T. Velulescu V. Levy D. Parsons R. Trent J. Lin D. Mercer W. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7957) Google Scholar). The gene is located on human chromosome 6p21.2. An N-terminal domain in p21WAF1/Cip1 inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase activity, whereas a p21WAF1/Cip1 C-terminal domain inhibits proliferating cell nuclear antigen (3Waga S. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar). The transcriptional control of p21WAF1/Cip1 is poorly understood at the present time but is thought to involve the participation of multiple nuclear factors, including p53, Sp family proteins, AP2, E2Fs, signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β, Gax, and Runx2 (4Westendorf J.J.

The ETS family of transcription factors presently consists of ∼30 members and is defined by a conserved DNA-binding ETS domain spanning 85 amino acids that forms a winged helixturn-helix structural motif (6Li R. Pei H. Watson D.K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6514-6523Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). These transcription factors are involved in a diverse array of biological functions, including cellular growth and differentiation. Modulation of gene expression by ETS family members can involve combinatorial interactions with other transcription factors (7Verger A. Duterque-Coquillaud M. Bioessays. 2002; 24: 362-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Such factors include Sp1, AP-1, c-Myb, and the highly conserved nuclear phosphoprotein p300. Two regions of p300 between amino acid residues 328–596 and 1678–2370 independently interact with Ets-1 (8Jayaraman G. Srinivas R. Duggan C. Ferreira E. Swaminathan S. Somasundaram K. Williams J.

The present study demonstrates the capacity of Ets-1 to regulate p21WAF1/Cip1 gene transcription in a p300-independent and/or -dependent manner. It also demonstrates the phenotypic consequence of Ets-1 regulation of p21WAF1/Cip1 expression on smooth muscle cell proliferation and apoptosis. Cell Culture—WKY-12-22 smooth muscle cells were cultured in Waymouth's MB 752/1 medium (Invitrogen), pH 7.4, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10 units/ml penicillin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were passaged every 3 days into 75-cm2 flasks by rinsing twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 1The abbreviations used are: PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CMV, cytomegalovirus; Rb, retinoblastoma protein; FasL, Fas ligand; ERE, Ets-1-response element; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. pH 7.4, and incubation with 0.05% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA in balanced salts solution (ICN-Flow) for 3 min at 37 °C prior to resuspension in growth medium. Plasmid Constructs—0-Luc and 6-Luc (constructs bearing 2.3 and 0.3 kb of the p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter relative to the TATA box, respectively, linked to a luciferase reporter) were generous gifts from Dr. Wafik El-Deiry. In addition, fragments of the p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter were generated using the Erase-a-Base deletion system (Promega). Fragments were then subcloned into pGL3-basic (3*6, 5*2, 7*3, 9*6, 10*3, 11*7, 13*6, and 13*20). Transverse mutations of the Ets-response elements located at –1577/–1574 and –1350/–1347 were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and subsequently named 5*2 (–1577TTCG–1574) and 5*2 (–1350TTCC–1347). pKCR3-Ets-1 was a generous gift from Dr. Ian Cassidy. p300 (CMVbased expression vector) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. pGEX-Ets-1-DBD and pKCR3-DN-Ets-1 have been described previously (9Kavurma M.M. Bobryshev Y. Khachigian L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36244-36252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Plasmid and Oligonucleotide Transfection—Smooth muscle cells were seeded in 100-mm tissue culture plates. At ∼50–60% confluence, the cells were transiently transfected with 20 μg of pKCR3-Ets-1 or the internal control plasmid, pKCR3, using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Assessment of Luciferase Activity—Transient transfections were performed at 60% confluency in 6-well titer plates using FuGENE 6 transfecting agent with indicated constructs. The internal control plasmid, pRL-TK, was also used in transfections. Luciferase activity was determined 24 h following transfection using the Dual-Luciferase assay system (Promega) and normalized to data generated from pRL-TK. Generation of Recombinant Ets-1—Generation of pGEXEts-1-DBD has been described previously (9Kavurma M.M. Bobryshev Y. Khachigian L.M. J. Biol.

Briefly, transformants were stimulated with 0.1 m isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3–6 h following an OD of 0.6–0.8 at 600 nm. Bacteria were pelleted and sonicated in sonication buffer (50 mm Tris pH 8.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1.43 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.44 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5% Triton X-100). Samples were spun on high speed, and the supernatant was collected into a fresh tube. Glutathione S-transferase-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma) were incubated with the supernatant for 1–2 h at 4 °C on a rotary shaker. Following incubation, beads were washed in 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.43 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.44 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione (in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). Recombinant Ets-1 DNA-binding domain (DBD, residues Pro386 to Glu494) was used in electrophoretic mobility shift analysis (EMSA) where indicated. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Analysis—Recombinant Ets-1-DNA binding domain protein was incubated with indicated 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides. Reactions proceeded in a total volume of 20 μl (containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 1 μg of salmon sperm DNA, 5% sucrose, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 10–15 min at 4 °C. Samples were resolved by 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. Western Blot Analysis—Smooth muscle cells in 100-mm plates were transfected with 20 μg of pKCR3-Ets-1 or the backbone control plasmid pKCR3. In Western blotting studies detecting phosphorylated Rb, cells were co-transfected with 0.8 μm of either antisense (5′-GAC ATC ACC AGG ATC GGA CAT-3′) (10Weiss R.H. Joo A. Randour C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10285-10290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) or scrambled (5′-AAG CGT ACT ACG CTA GCA CGA-3′) p21WAF1/Cip1 oligonucleotide. Twenty four hours after transfection, the cells were washed in cold PBS, and total protein was extracted in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 1% Triton X-100 containing protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 mm EDTA, 1% aprotinin, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). In experiments evaluating the effect of antisense and scrambled p21WAF1/Cip1 on p21WAF1/Cip1 expression, smooth muscle cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 6 h at the confluence of 40–50% prior to transfection with either 0.8 μm antisense or scrambled p21WAF1/Cip1 using FuGENE 6. Eighteen hours after the initial transfection, cells were transfected a second time in the presence of 5% fetal bovine serum. Cells were harvested 24 h following the second transfection. Western blot analysis was performed as described elsewhere (11Taylor L.M. Khachigian L.M. J. Biol.

Proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence detection (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Immunoprecipitation Studies—Nuclear extracts of cells were precleared with 30 μl of 1:1 slurry of protein G-Sepharose™-radioimmune precipitation assay buffer for 1 h with bi-directional rotation at 4 °C. Ten μl of p300 rabbit polyclonal IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was incubated with the precleared lysates overnight at 4 °C with gentle shaking. Several washes were performed with centrifugation prior to Western blot analysis. Quantitative Assessment of Apoptosis—Smooth muscle cells were grown to 50–60% confluency in 100-mm plates and transfected with 20 μg of pKCR3-Ets-1 plasmid or pKCR3, with or without 0.8 μm of antisense or scrambled p21WAF1/Cip1. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were trypsinized and seeded into 96-well plates at 10,000 cells per well. Apoptosis was assayed another 24 h later using the Cell Death Detection ELISAPlus kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Results are expressed as total internucleosomal DNA fragmentation as a proportion of the cell population, determined by an automated Coulter Counter. For fluorescein isothiocyanate-linked annexin V/propidium iodide staining, smooth muscle cells (in 100-mm dishes) were transfected with pKCR3-Ets-1 or pKCR3 (20 μg). Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm CaCl2) at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml. Five μl of annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate and 10 μl of propidium iodide (50 μg/ml stock in PBS) was added to 100 μl of the cell suspension. Cells were gently mixed and incubated in the dark for 15 min. This was followed by the addition of 400 μl of binding buffer to each sample prior to analysis by flow cytometry within 1 h. Ets-1 Inhibits Apoptosis in Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells— Previously, we determined that the Fas ligand (FasL) promoter is under the positive regulatory influence of Ets-1 in WKY12-22 vascular smooth muscle cells (9Kavurma M.M. Bobryshev Y. Khachigian L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36244-36252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The effect of Ets-1 on smooth muscle cell apoptosis has not yet been investigated. Given its up-regulation of FasL expression in this cell type, we predicted that Ets-1 would induce apoptosis. WKY12-22 cells were transfected with pKCR3-Ets-1, an SV40-based expression vector encoding c-Ets-1, or its backbone control, and apoptosis was assessed 24 h subsequently by fluorescein isothiocyanatelinked annexin V/propidium iodide staining of cells and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis or quantitative cytoplasmic histone-associated internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Ets-1 inhibited spontaneous levels of both annexin V/propidium iodide staining (Fig. 1A) and DNA fragmentation (Fig. 1B) in this cell type. Western immunoblot analysis on the extracts of cells transfected with pKCR3-Ets-1 or its backbone counterpart demonstrated that Ets-1 was indeed expressed in this system (Fig. 1C), with no change in levels of Sp1, YY1, or the Ets family member PU.1 (Fig. 1C). Existence of Two Putative Ets-1 Elements in the p21WAF1/Cip1 Promoter—We and others have recently determined that p21WAF1/Cip1 plays a mitogenic and anti-apoptotic role in vascular smooth muscle cells 2Kavurma, M. M., and Khachigian, L. M. (2003) J. Biol. Chem., in press. (10Weiss R.H. Joo A. Randour C. J. Biol.

Using timed 5′-exonuclease digestion, we generated a nested series of Firefly luciferase constructs driven by 5′-deletions of the p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter (Fig. 2A). These constructs were transfected into WKY12-22 cells, and reporter activity was assessed after 24 h by luminometry and normalized for Renilla luciferase activity. Constructs 3*6 and 5*2, bearing 1975 and 1670 bp of the p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter, respectively, generated high basal luciferase activity (Fig. 2B). Fragments of the promoter of 1270-bp length (construct 7*3) or less, however, failed to support the high level of reporter expression observed. The 5′endpoints of p21WAF1/Cip1 constructs 5*2 and 7*3 span two putative cis-acting Ets motifs, 5′-GGAT-3′ and 5′-GGAA-3′, located at positions –1577/–1574 and –1350/–1347 (relative to the transcriptional start site), respectively (Fig. 2C). Ets-1 Activates p21WAF1/Cip1 Transcription and Protein Expression—To determine whether the –1670/–1270 region of the p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter comprised a functional Ets-1response element (ERE), we transfected WKY12-22 cells with increasing amounts of pKCR3-Ets-1 or its backbone. p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter-dependent luciferase activity in cells transfected with construct 5*2 was induced by the Ets-1 expression vector in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). In contrast, Ets-1 failed to activate reporter expression driven by construct 7*3 (Fig. 3A). Substitution of pKCR3-Ets-1 with pKCR3-DN-Ets-1, which bears the Ets-1 DNA-binding domain but not the activation domain, failed to activate the p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter (Fig. 3B). These findings reveal the existence of a functional ERE in the –1670/–1270 region of the p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter. Western analysis was performed to demonstrate that Ets-1 modulation of p21WAF1/Cip1 transcription is reflected in greater levels of the p21WAF1/Cip1 protein. p21WAF1/Cip1 immunoreactivity was higher in cells transfected with pKCR3-Ets-1 versus pKCR3 alone, indicating that Ets-1 activates endogenous p21WAF1/Cip1 (Fig. 4). In contrast, levels of the zinc finger transcription factor Sp1 were unaltered by Ets-1 overexpression (Fig. 4). Ets-1 Interacts Selectively with an Ets Element in the p21WAF1/Cip1 Promoter—To determine whether Ets-1 interacts with one or both putative EREs in the p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift analysis using 32Plabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides bearing wild type (Oligo –1370/–1334 (–1350GGAA–1347) or Oligo-1597/-1558 (–1577GGAT–1574)) or mutant (mOligo –1370/–1334 (–1350TTCC–1347) or mOligo –1597/–1558 (–1577TTCG–1574)) sequences, respectively. A separate oligonucleotide (32P-labeled Oligo FasL –381/–346), bearing the Fas ligand promoter ERE (–356GGAA–352) (9Kavurma M.M. Bobryshev Y. Khachigian L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36244-36252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) bound the Ets-1 protein, as expected (Fig. 5). 32P-Oligo –1370/–1334 (–1350GGAA–1347) also formed a nucleoprotein complex with Ets-1 (Fig. 5), which was abrogated if the probe was substituted with Oligo –1370/–1334 (–1350TTCC–1347) (Fig. 5). A nucleoprotein complex was not detected using 32P-mOligo –1597/–1558 (–1577GGAT–1574) or 32P-mOligo –1597/–1558 (–1577TTCG–1574) (Fig. 5). The p21WAF1/Cip1 Promoter Is Differentially Regulated by Ets Motif – 1350GGAA – 1347 and – 1577GGAT – 1574—To demonstrate the functional significance of either or both of these Ets motifs, we introduced these same mutations into p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter-reporter constructs and evaluated the effect of co-transfection with pKCR3-Ets-1 or pKCR3 alone. Ets-1 activated luciferase expression driven by 1670 bp of the p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter (Fig. 6). Basal expression was reduced in cells transfected with construct 5*2 (–1577TTCG–1574) in which the –1577GGAT–1574 motif had been mutated; however, Ets-1inducibility of the promoter was unchanged (Fig. 6). Mutation of the –1350GGAA–1347 element in construct 5*2 (–1350TTCC–1347) ablated both basal and Ets-1-inducible expression (Fig. 6). Thus, the –1577GGAT–1574 motif mediates basal but not Ets-1 activation of the p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter, whereas the –1350GGAA–1347 element mediates both basal and Ets-1 inducible p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter-dependent expression. Ets-1 Activation of p21WAF1/Cip1 Promoter Involves Cooperativity with p300 —Previous studies have demonstrated that the activity of the p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter is regulated by the transcriptional co-activator p300 (14Billon N. van Grunsven L.A. Rudkin B.B. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2047-2054PubMed Google Scholar). p300 modulation of p21WAF1/Cip1 transcription is mediated by cooperative interactions with a number of nuclear factors, including Sp1 (15Owen G.I. Richer J.K. Tung L. Takimoto G. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10696-10701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), Sp3 (16Xiao H. Hasegawa T. Isobe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1371-1376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and BRCA1 (17Chai Y.L. Cui J. Shao N. Shyam E. Reddy P. Rao V.N. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To determine whether Ets-1 modulation of p21WAF1/Cip1 transcription involves interplay with p300, we performed co-transfection experiments using expression vectors for p300 (CMV-based) or Ets-1 together with construct 5*2. p300 and Ets-1 each activated p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter-dependent luciferase expression (Fig. 7A). p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter activity was induced in a synergistic manner when Ets-1 and p300 were co-transfected (Fig. 7A). p300 failed to activate the p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter using construct 5*2 (–1577TTCG–1574) bearing the mutant –1577GGAT–1574 motif, whereas Ets-1 inducibility of this construct was not changed (Fig. 7A). Unlike wild-type construct 5*2, construct 5*2 (–1577TTCG–1574) was not activated by the presence of both p300 and Ets-1 beyond activation in the presence of Ets-1 alone (Fig. 7A). Construct 5*2 (–1350TTCC–1347), bearing the mutated –1350GGAA–1347 element, was refractory to induction by Ets-1 or p300, either alone or in combination (Fig, 7A). Similarly, neither transcription factor activated construct 7*3 (Fig. 7A), whose 5′ end point is 3′ to both of these Ets-1 motifs. Complementary pull-down experiments in which cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with p300 antibodies prior to Western blot analysis for Ets-1 revealed the formation of a physical complex between p300 and Ets-1 (Fig. 7B). Ets-1 Inhibition of Apoptosis Is Mediated by p21WAF1/Cip1— Because the preceding findings show that Ets-1 protects smooth muscle cells from apoptosis and exerts a positive regulatory influence on basal and inducible p21WAF1/Cip1 transcription via sequence-specific interactions with the p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter, we next explored whether Ets-1 inhibition of apoptosis is mediated via p21WAF1/Cip1. We and others have recently determined that p21WAF1/Cip1 can play a mitogenic and anti-apoptotic role in vascular smooth muscle cells2 (10Weiss R.H. Joo A. Randour C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10285-10290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 13Weiss R.H. Randour C.J. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that Ets-1 suppression of apoptosis might be rescued by strategies targeting p21WAF1/Cip1. Smooth muscle cell apoptosis, as expected, was reduced upon overexpression of Ets-1 (Fig. 8A). Apoptosis was reversed and, indeed, stimulated by antisense oligonucleotides targeting p21WAF1/Cip1 (Fig. 8A). In contrast, an identical concentration of scrambled oligonucleotide had no effect (Fig. 8A). The capacity of the p21WAF1/Cip1 antisense oligonucleotide, but not the scrambled counterpart, to inhibit endogenous p21WAF1/Cip1 expression is indicated by Western blot analysis in Fig. 8B. To provide additional evidence demonstrating the phenotypic relevance of the Ets-1/p21WAF1/Cip1 system, we quantitated the number of cells in each cohort using a Coulter counter. Cells transfected with pKCR3-Ets-1 grew faster than cells transfected with the backbone alone (Fig. 8C). This induction was abolished by antisense p21WAF1/Cip1, whereas the scrambled oligonucleotide, had no effect (Fig. 8C). Moreover, antisense p21WAF1/Cip1 abrogated phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Fig. 8D), a marker of G1 → S transition in vascular smooth muscle cells and other cell types (18Kintscher U. Wakino S. Kim S. Jackson S.M. Fleck E. Hsueh W.A. Law R.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1216-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These studies of apoptosis and proliferation provide complementary evidence that Ets-1 induction of p21WAF1/Cip1 has a profound influence on the smooth muscle cell phenotype. The present findings, collectively, demonstrate the existence of a functional ERE (–1350GGAA–1347) that binds Ets-1 and is required for basal expression of the p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter. A second Ets motif upstream of this site in the promoter (–1577GGAT–1574) failed to bind Ets-1 directly or serve as an ERE but was required for basal activity of the p21WAF1/Cip1 promoter. Ets-1 inhibition of smooth muscle cell apoptosis was rescued by inhibition of p21WAF1/Cip1. Conversely, Ets-1 stimulation of proliferation was reduced by p21WAF1/Cip1 inhibition, thus interconnecting the Ets-1/p21WAF1/Cip1 pathway in the regulation of the smooth muscle cell phenotype. The role of Ets-1 in apoptosis is somewhat controversial. For example, inactivation of Ets-1 increased T-cell apoptosis and terminal B-cell differentiation (19Bories J.C. Willerford D.M. Grevin D. Davidson L. Camus A. Martin P. Stehelin D. Alt F.W. Nature. 1995; 377: 635-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Similarly, Ets-1(–/–)-RAG-2(–/–) chimeric mice have reduced numbers of mature thymocytes and peripheral T cells. They also display a proliferative defect in response to different activation signals and have increased rates of spontaneous apoptosis (20Muthusamy N. Barton K. Leiden J.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In contrast, Ets-1 overexpression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells can stimulate apoptosis by modulating the expression of apoptotic genes (21Teruyama K. Abe M. Nakano T. Iwasaka-Yagi C. Takahashi S. Yamada S. Sato Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). By examining both proliferation and apoptosis in smooth muscle cells, the present study demonstrates the anti-apoptotic effect of Ets-1 via the p21WAF1/Cip1 pathway in this cell type.

A yeast two-hybrid screen for AKAP95 interaction partners identified the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) 2 protein, a component of the pre-replication complex. AKAP95-MCM2 interaction was mapped to residues 1–195 of AKAP95 and corroborated by glutathione S-transferase precipitation and immunoprecipitation from chromatin. Disruption of AKAP95-MCM2 interaction with an AKAP95-(1–195) peptide within HeLa cell nuclei abolishes initiation of DNA replication in G1 phase and the elongation phase of replication in vitro without affecting global nuclear organization or import. Disruption of the C-terminal zinc finger of AKAP95 reduces efficiency of replication initiation. Disruption of the PKA-binding domain does not impair replication in G1- or S-phase nuclei, whereas a PKA inhibitor affects the initiation but not the elongation phase of replication. Depleting AKAP95 from nuclei partially depletes MCM2 and abolishes replication. Recombinant AKAP95 restores intranuclear MCM2 and replication in a dose-dependent manner.

Our results suggest a role of AKAP95 in DNA replication by providing a scaffold for MCM2. Eukaryotic DNA replication involves at least 20 different proteins and is a process largely conserved from yeast to human (1Lei M. Tye B.K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1447-1454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A key player in the regulation of DNA replication is the hexameric minichromosome maintenance (MCM) 1The abbreviations used are: MCM, minichromosome maintenance; pre-RC, pre-replication complex; PKA, protein kinase A; PKI, PKA inhibitor; ORC, origin of recognition complex; mAb, monoclonal antibody; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethane-sulfonic acid; RII, regulatory subunit of PKA-type II.1The abbreviations used are: MCM, minichromosome maintenance; pre-RC, pre-replication complex; PKA, protein kinase A; PKI, PKA inhibitor; ORC, origin of recognition complex; mAb, monoclonal antibody; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethane-sulfonic acid; RII, regulatory subunit of PKA-type II. complex. MCMs are proteins identified initially for their role in plasmid maintenance and cell cycle progression (2Maine G.T. Sinha P. Tye B.K. Genetics. 1984; 106: 365-385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Six of the MCM proteins, including MCM2, are highly conserved and form a complex that plays a direct role in both initiation of replication and DNA chain elongation (1Lei M. Tye B.K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1447-1454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Kelly T.J. Brown G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 829-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The pre-replication complex (pre-RC) assembles during late M and G1 phases by sequential loading of Cdc6, Cdt1, and MCM proteins onto the origin of recognition complex (ORC) at specific chromosomal sites (1Lei M. Tye B.K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1447-1454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Kelly T.J. Brown G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 829-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 4Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). Once the MCM complex is assembled, S-phase cyclin-dependent kinase activity and the Cdc7-Dbf4 protein kinase (an MCM2-7 kinase) trigger firing of DNA synthesis (5Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Young M.R. Kihara M. Sugino A. Tye B.K. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3365-3374Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). After origin firing, the pre-RC is dissociated, and it is not reassembled until the next cell cycle. A proportion of MCM proteins are phosphorylated and believed to be released from chromatin, although a DNA unwinding or helicase function of MCM proteins has been shown during elongation (6Labib K. Diffley J.F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Moreover, depletion of MCMs after initiation of DNA replication irreversibly blocks progression of replication forks in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, indicating that MCM proteins are essential for elongation (7Labib K. Tercero J.A. Diffley J.F. Science. 2000; 288: 1643-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). We and others have cloned and characterized a 95-kDa protein kinase A (PKA, or cAMP-dependent kinase)-anchoring protein, AKAP95 (8Coghlan V.M. Langeberg L.K. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7658-7665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Eide T. Coghlan V. Orstavik S. Holsve C. Solberg R. Skålhegg B.S. Lamb N.J. Langeberg L. Fernandez A. Scott J.D. Jahnsen T. Tasken K. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). AKAP95 is a nuclear AKAP that in interphase primarily co-fractionates with the nuclear matrix, a nonionic detergent-, nuclease-, and salt-resistant structure, whereas a minor fraction associates with chromatin (8Coghlan V.M. Langeberg L.K. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7658-7665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Collas P. Le Guellec K. Tasken K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1167-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). At mitosis, and upon nuclear envelope breakdown in vitro, AKAP95 dissociates from the matrix and binds chromatin (10Collas P. Le Guellec K. Tasken K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1167-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 11Steen R.L. Cubizolles F. Le Guellec K. Collas P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), onto which it has been proposed to recruit the condensin complex and thereby play a role in chromosome condensation (11Steen R.L. Cubizolles F. Le Guellec K. Collas P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 12Eide T. Carlson C. Tasken K.A. Hirano T. Tasken K. Collas P. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 426-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Mapping of chromatin condensation and condensin targeting functions of AKAP95 has shown that these processes are independent of PKA binding but require both the ZF1 and ZF2 zinc finger motives in the C-terminal half of AKAP95 (12Eide T. Carlson C. Tasken K.A. Hirano T. Tasken K. Collas P. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 426-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A yeast two-hybrid screen has identified p68 RNA helicase as a binding partner for AKAP95, suggesting a putative scaffolding role of AKAP95 in the assembly of transcription complexes (13Akileswaran L. Taraska J.W. Sayer J.A. Gettemy J.M. Coghlan V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17448-17454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The c-Myc-binding protein, AMY-1, also binds AKAP95 near the PKA-RII-binding domain (14Furusawa M. Taira T. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Ariga H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50885-50892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). AMY-1 can form a ternary complex with AKAP95 and RII that prevents targeting of the PKA catalytic subunit (14Furusawa M. Taira T. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Ariga H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50885-50892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Any other putative function of AKAP95 in the interphase nucleus has remained unexplored. DNA replication has been connected to the nuclear matrix, based on indications that many DNA polymerases are immobilized on an insoluble intranuclear network in so-called replication factories (15Iborra F.J. Cook P.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 780-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 16Cook P.R. Science. 1999; 284: 1790-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Here, we present evidence for a direct interaction between AKAP95 and MCM2. Disruption of this interaction abolishes initiation and elongation phases of replication in vitro. Removing AKAP95 from nuclei also partially depletes MCM2 and abolishes replication. Recombinant AKAP95 restores intranuclear MCM2 and replication. Our results suggest a role of AKAP95 as an MCM2 anchor and an involvement of the AKAP95-MCM2 association in DNA synthesis. Antibodies and Peptides—Anti-AKAP95 polyclonal antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology (10Collas P. Le Guellec K. Tasken K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1167-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against AKAP95 and MCM2 (Bm28) were from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-GST, anti-Orc2, anti-Cdc6, and anti-MCM2 polyclonal antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. mAbs against Gal4AD or Gal4BD domains were from Clontech. Antibodies against lamina-associated polypeptide 2β and B-type lamins were from Dr. J.-C. Courvalin (17Buendia B. Courvalin J.-C. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 230: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Anti-HA95 antibodies were as described previously (18Orstavik S. Eide T. Collas P. Han I.O. Tasken K. Kieff E. Jahnsen T. Skålhegg B.S. Biol. Cell. 2000; 92: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Full-length AKAP95 was amplified by PCR using AKAP95 cDNA (9Eide T. Coghlan V. Orstavik S. Holsve C. Solberg R.

Cell Res. 1998; 238: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) as template to generate restriction sites for subcloning into pGEX-KG, expression from which yielded a GST-AKAP95-(1–692) fusion protein (9Eide T. Coghlan V. Orstavik S. Holsve C. Solberg R. Skålhegg B.S. Lamb N.J. Langeberg L. Fernandez A. Scott J.D. Jahnsen T. Tasken K. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This expression vector was used as template to generate deletion constructs and for site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange; Stratagene) (12Eide T. Carlson C. Tasken K.A. Hirano T. Tasken K. Collas P. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 426-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). GST-AKAP95 peptides produced were AKAP95-(1–692), AKAP95-(1–195), AKAP95-(387–692), AKAP95-(387–602), AKAP95-(387–569), AKAP95-(387–524), and AKAP95-(387–450) and peptides with a mutation in zinc fingers ZF1 and ZF2 or in the PKA-binding domain as described in “Results” (12Eide T. Carlson C. Tasken K.A. Hirano T. Tasken K. Collas P. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 426-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). MCM2-(398–543) was ligated into pGEX5X-3 (Amersham Biosciences) to produce a GST-MCM2-(398–543) protein. All constructs were sequenced. Expression and purification of GST-tagged proteins were done as described previously (19Solberg R. Tasken K. Wen W. Coghlan V.M. Meinkoth J.L. Scott J.D. Jahnsen T. Taylor S.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method. Cells—HeLa cells were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium/10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were synchronized in M phase with 1 μm nocodazole for 18 h (10Collas P. Le Guellec K. Tasken K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1167-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To allow cell cycle reentry, mitotic cells were harvested and replated at 2.5 × 106 cells/162-cm2 flask. G1- and S-phase cells were harvested 2 and 12 h, respectively, after release from mitotic arrest (20Martins S. Eikvar S. Furukawa K. Collas P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Nuclei and Chromatin—Intact nuclei were isolated from unsynchronized and G1- or S-phase HeLa cells, as indicated, by Dounce homogenization (21Martins S.B. Eide T. Steen R.L. Jahnsen T. Skålhegg B.S. Collas P. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3703-3713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and used for immunoprecipitation and replication assays, respectively. Concentration of nuclei was determined using an automated cell counter (Coulter). Purified S-phase nuclei were depleted of AKAP95 by loading anti-NuMA antibodies and subsequent exposure to a mitotic HeLa cell extract as described previously (11Steen R.L. Cubizolles F. Le Guellec K. Collas P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To reconstitute nuclear architecture, AKAP95-depleted chromatin masses were recovered from the extract by sedimentation through 1 m sucrose and incubated for 1.5 h in a nuclear reassembly extract containing cytosol, membrane vesicles, ATP-regenerating system, and GTP to promote nuclear envelope formation (20Martins S. Eikvar S. Furukawa K. Collas P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Reconstituted nuclei were sedimented at 1,000 × g through 1 m sucrose for analysis. To prepare chromatin, confluent interphase HeLa cells were harvested and suspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris, pH7.6, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture) containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Nuclei were sedimented, resuspended in CSK buffer (10 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture) containing 1% Triton X-100, and extracted at 4 °C for 15 min. The extract was centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 5 min. The pellet was digested in CSK buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 5 units/μl micrococcal nuclease at 37 °C for 15 min. The lysate was sedimented at 10,000 × g, and the supernatant constituted the chromatin fraction. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—As bait, a full-length AKAP95 was amplified by PCR (9Eide T. Coghlan V. Orstavik S. Holsve C. Solberg R. Skålhegg B.S. Lamb N.J. Langeberg L. Fernandez A. Scott J.D. Jahnsen T. Tasken K. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and subcloned into yeast vector pAS2-1 (Clontech) to produce a Gal4BD-AKAP95 fusion protein. The construct was transformed into yeast strain PJ69-2A containing Ade and His reporters. Yeasts expressing the bait were mated to yeasts containing a human HeLa Matchmaker cDNA pre-transformed library (5 × 106 independent clones in pGADGH, strain Y187; Clontech) to screen for interacting proteins. Growth on medium lacking Trp, His, Ade, and Leu (high stringency conditions) and β-galactosidase assays were used to isolate cDNAs encoding AKAP95-interacting candidates. 3-Amino-1,2,4-triazole (20 mm), a competitive inhibitor of the yeast His protein, was used to suppress background growth. Positive clones were isolated according to the YPH user manual (Clontech). To confirm protein-protein interactions, bait and prey were re-transformed into strains Y187 and PJ69-2A, respectively, and mated. Diploids were selected onto synthetic drop out minus Trp and Leu (double drop out) plates before re-streaking onto synthetic drop out minus Leu, Trp, Ade, and His (quadruple drop out) to select for interaction. Diploids were tested for β-galactosidase activity by colony-lift filter assay. Expression and Isolation of Proteins from Yeast—Yeasts were harvested in log phase. Cells were resuspended in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0), boiled, and lysed by vortexing with glass beads for 10 min at 4 °C. Proteins were boiled in SDS-loading buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In Vitro Transcription and Translation of MCM2 and AKAP95—The T7 promoter was incorporated by PCR upstream of MCM2 or AKAP95 using the Clontech Matchmaker Co-Immunoprecipitation kit. In vitro transcription and translation were performed using a TNT T7 Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega) and [35S]Met labeling (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Immunological Procedures—Immunoblotting analysis was performed as described previously (21Martins S.B. Eide T. Steen R.L. Jahnsen T. Skålhegg B.S. Collas P. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3703-3713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using antibodies against AKAP95 (polyclonal antibodies), MCM2 (monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies), Cdc6, and Orc2. Immunofluorescence analysis of purified nuclei was done as described previously (21Martins S.B. Eide T. Steen R.L. Jahnsen T. Skålhegg B.S. Collas P. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3703-3713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitations, HeLa cells (2 × 107) were sonicated and extracted in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and the lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 × g. The supernatant was pre-cleared with protein A/G-agarose beads, and AKAP95 was immunoprecipitated using anti-AKAP95 mAbs (0.25 μg/μl). Immune precipitates were eluted in SDS-loading buffer. Alternatively, AKAP95 was immunoprecipitated from HeLa nuclear extracts in immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors) using polyclonal antibodies (21Martins S.B. Eide T. Steen R.L. Jahnsen T. Skålhegg B.S. Collas P. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3703-3713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These AKAP95 immune precipitates were used in dissociation experiments. GST Precipitation—In vitro-translated [35S]Met-labeled MCM2 or AKAP95 peptides were incubated separately with 200 nm GST-AKAP95 or GST-MCM2-(398–543) peptides in GST binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100) for 30 min. Alternatively, pre-cleared radioimmune precipitation assay extracts from HeLa cells of HeLa nuclei (2 × 107) were incubated overnight with the indicated GST-AKAP95 peptide (400 nm) bound to glutathione-agarose beads. GST-proteins were precipitated, washed in GST binding buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography or immunoblotting. Loading of Nuclei with GST-AKAP95 Peptides—Peptide loading into isolated G1- or S-phase HeLa nuclei was performed as described previously (10Collas P. Le Guellec K. Tasken K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1167-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclei were mildly permeabilized with lysolecithin, excess lysolecithin was quenched with 3% bovine serum albumin for 5 min, and nuclei were incubated for 1 h with 100 μm of the indicated GST-AKAP95 peptides or GST alone. Nuclei were washed through sucrose and held on ice until use. Lysolecithin-treated nuclei supported import and DNA replication in vitro (21Martins S.B. Eide T. Steen R.L. Jahnsen T. Skålhegg B.S. Collas P. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3703-3713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (see “Results”). DNA Replication Assay—Replication extracts were prepared from S-phase HeLa cells collected 15 h after release from nocodazole-induced mitotic arrest. Cells were lysed by Dounce homogenization (20Martins S. Eikvar S. Furukawa K. Collas P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and briefly sonicated on ice to lyse nuclei and release soluble nuclear components. The lysate was sedimented at 15,000 × g for 15 min and then at 200,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein concentration of the extract was ∼18 mg/ml. Replication was assayed by incorporation of [α-32P]dCTP (20Martins S. Eikvar S. Furukawa K. Collas P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 22Stoeber K.

Cell. 1997; 88: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Purified G1- or S-phase nuclei, loaded with GST-AKAP95 peptides or GST alone as control, were incubated for 3 h at 5,000 nuclei/μl in 40 μl of replication extract containing an ATP-regenerating system (1.2 μl), 100 μm GTP (0.4 μl), buffered deoxynucleotide triphosphates (40 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 7 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm each of dATP, dGTP, dTTP, and dCTP; 2 μl), and [α-32P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol; Nycomed-Amersham) (20Martins S. Eikvar S. Furukawa K. Collas P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). At the end of incubation, samples were mixed with 1 volume of 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and digested for 2 h at 37 °C with 1 mg/ml proteinase K. Samples were mixed by pipetting, and aliquots were electrophoresed through 0.8% agarose. Gel loading was assessed by ethidium bromide staining. Signals were detected by autoradiography. Isolation of MCM2 as an AKAP95-binding Protein by Two-hybrid Screening—A full-length AKAP95 clone was fused to the C terminus of Gal4-DNA-BD (16 kDa), expressed in yeast and detected as a ∼120-kDa product (Fig. 1A). Screening of a pre-transformed HeLa cell library (5 × 106 clones) yielded 290 candidate clones after quadruple drop out and β-galactosidase selection, of which 7% were lacZ+, His+, and Ade+ in the absence of bait and eliminated. One hundred and twenty positive clones were sequenced. Whereas most clones were excluded as being false positives or artifacts because the open reading frame was out of frame or in the wrong orientation with respect to the fused Gal4 activation domain, nine clones appeared to be putative interaction partners. Of these, one represented the AKAP95-binding protein AMY-1 (14Furusawa M. Taira T. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Ariga H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50885-50892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and seven are currently subject to further investigation. One clone encoded residues 398–543 of MCM2, a component of the pre-RC, with a mobility of 30 kDa when fused to the 12-kDa Gal4AD domain (Fig. 1B). This clone was lacZ+, His+, and Ade+ only in presence of AKAP95, but not with Gal4-DNA-BD alone (Fig. 1C, left panel). AMY-1, detected in the screen, was used as positive control, and pGADGH was used as negative control (Fig. 1C). Interaction of MCM2 and AMY-1 with AKAP95 was confirmed by β-galactosidase assay (Fig. 1C). GST Precipitation of 35S-AKAP95 and MCM2 and Mapping of Interaction Domain—To verify the interaction between AKAP95 and MCM2, in vitro-translated [35S]Met-labeled AKAP95 was incubated with GST-MCM2 or GST alone, and GST-protein complexes were precipitated. 35S-AKAP95 co-precipitated with GST-MCM2, but not with GST alone (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, a GST-AKAP95-(1–692) fusion protein, but not GST alone, co-precipitated endogenous MCM2 from a HeLa cell extract, as shown by anti-MCM2 immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2B). This indicates that AKAP95 interacts directly with MCM2. We next mapped the MCM2 interaction domain of AKAP95. In vitro-translated [35S]Met-labeled MCM2 was incubated with GST-AKAP95 deletion peptides. GST precipitations show that AKAP95-(1–692) and AKAP95-(1–195) interacted with MCM2, whereas interaction was nearly abolished with AKAP95-(387–692) (Fig. 2C). This result was confirmed in a precipitation of GST-AKAP95 peptides from HeLa nuclear extracts. GST-AKAP95-(1–195) or GST-AKAP95-(1–692) co-precipitated endogenous MCM2, whereas GST-AKAP95-(397–692) (or shorter deletions thereof; data not shown) was ineffective (Fig. 2D). Notably, neither AKAP95 peptide co-precipitated Orc2 or Cdc6, two other components of the pre-RC (Fig. 2D), arguing toward specificity of the association between AKAP95-(1–195) and MCM2. Collectively, the data argue that the first 195 residues of AKAP95 are involved in the interaction with MCM2. AKAP95 Peptides Dissociate MCM2 from AKAP95 Immune Complexes—AKAP95 and MCM2 co-immunoprecipitated from HeLa cell extracts (Fig. 3A). Fractionation of purified HeLa nuclei further showed that AKAP95 co-fractionated with both nuclear matrix and chromatin, whereas MCM2 co-fractionated primarily with chromatin (Fig. 3B). AKAP95 and MCM2 co-immunoprecipitated from the chromatin fraction (data not shown), suggesting that both proteins reside in a same complex associated with chromatin. Whether GST-AKAP95 peptides would disrupt the interaction between AKAP95 and MCM2 was determined. Anti-AKAP95 immune precipitates from HeLa nuclei were incubated for 1 h with 100 μm GST-AKAP95 fragments, immune precipitates were sedimented, and dissociation of MCM2 from AKAP95 was monitored by immunoblotting. AKAP95-(1–195) dissociated most MCM2 from the AKAP95 immune precipitates, whereas AKAP95-(387–692), shorter C-terminal AKAP95 fragments (data not shown), or GST alone was ineffective (Fig. 3C). This result corroborates the interaction of AKAP95 with MCM2 via residues 1–195 and raises the possibility of disrupting this interaction in nuclei for functional studies. Disruption of the AKAP95-MCM2 Interaction in G 1 Inhibits Initiation and Elongation Phases of DNA Replication—To explore a putative role of the AKAP95-MCM2 interaction on DNA replication, dissociation of MCM2 from AKAP95 was elicited intranuclearly, and the effect of this disruption on replication in a cell-free system was investigated. GST-AKAP95 peptides or, as control, GST alone was introduced into nuclei isolated from G1-phase HeLa cells after gentle permeabilization of the nuclei with lysolecithin. Control and peptide-loaded nuclei were incubated for 3 h in a nuclear and cytosolic extract from S-phase HeLa cells containing [α-32P]dCTP, deoxynucleotide triphosphates, GTP, and an ATP-regenerating system to promote replication. In the absence of peptide or with GST alone, nuclei synthesized DNA, and replication was inhibited by 50 μm aphidicolin in the extract (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 2). AKAP95-(1–692) and AKAP95-(1–195) abolished replication, whereas AKAP95-(387–692), AKAP95-(387–602), AKAP95-(387–569), and AKAP95-(387–524) only partially, but significantly, affected replication (Fig. 4A, lanes 3–8). In contrast, AKAP95-(387–450) did not affect replication (Fig. 4A, lane 9). Disruption of AKAP95 zinc finger ZF1 in AKAP95-(387–692) by mutation of two of the zinc-chelating cysteines (C392S and C395S) or similarly mutating ZF1 in AKAP95-(387–450) did not alter the effect of these peptides on replication (Fig. 4A, ZF1*, lanes 11 and 13). In contrast, mutation of the C-terminal zinc finger ZF2 (C481S and C484S) in AKAP95-(387–692) restored a control level of DNA synthesis (Fig. 4A, ZF2*, lane 12), supporting an effect of a region containing ZF2 on replication. Disruption of the PKA-binding domain of AKAP95 by an I582P mutation did not alter the effect of AKAP95-(387–692) on replication efficiency (Fig. 4A, PKA*, lane 14). To provide evidence that 32P labeling in G1 nuclei was due to initiation of replication, we showed that replication was inhibited with 10 μm olomoucine, an inhibitor of the cyclin A-cyclin-dependent kinase 2 complex required for S phase entry (22Stoeber K. Mills A.D. Kubota Y. Krude T. Romanowski P. Marheineke K. Laskey R.A. Williams G.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7219-7229Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B). We also excluded the possibility that the DNA synthesis signal in G1 nuclei represented an elongation phase in already replicating nuclei because G1 nuclei incubated in a G0-phase extract did not replicate (data not shown). Furthermore, we showed that the localization of proteins of the inner nuclear membrane (lamina-associated polypeptide lamina-associated polypeptide 2β), nuclear lamina (B-type lamins), and endogenous AKAP95 was not altered in G1 nuclei containing GST-AKAP95 peptides (Fig. 4C). Lastly, G1 nuclei containing GST-AKAP95 peptides were capable of importing the replication factor Cdc6 in vitro (Fig. 4C). The results indicate that AKAP95 peptides containing the MCM2-binding domain abolish DNA replication in G1 nuclei in vitro without affecting global nuclear architecture or import. Partial inhibition of replication also occurs with AKAP95-(387–524) but not AKAP95-(387–450). This suggests that two regions of AKAP95 are implicated in replication, namely, amino acids 1–195 and a critical domain between residues 450 and 524 that includes ZF2. Whether the elongation phase of DNA replication was also affected by AKAP95 peptides was determined. Nuclei isolated from S-phase HeLa cells were loaded with GST-AKAP95 peptides and incubated in S-phase extract under conditions promoting replication. AKAP95-(1–195) largely inhibited DNA synthesis (Fig. 4D); however, in contrast to G1 nuclei, replication in S-phase nuclei was not affected by any other AKAP95 fragment including those bearing mutations in ZF1, ZF2, or the PKA-binding domain (data not shown). Note that some DNA synthesis occurred in S-phase nuclei incubated in extract from G0 cells, reflecting the replicating state of these nuclei (data not shown). We concluded that, as with initiation of DNA replication, elongation is inhibited by AKAP95-(1–195). However, C-terminal AKAP95 peptides have no effect on the elongation phase of DNA replication.

This dual role of the capsid in the viral life cycle must be tightly regulated to ensure efficient virus spread. Here, we used the duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) infection model to analyze the effects of capsid phosphorylation and hydrogen bond formation.

Hepadnaviruses are a group of small enveloped DNA viruses with a narrow host range and a relative tropism for the liver.

Lau J.Y. Lancet. 1993; 342: 1340-1344Abstract PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 2Seeger C. Mason W.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 51-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). Other members of the family include the duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) and the woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) (3Mason W.S. Seal G. Summers J. J. Virol. 1980; 36: 829-836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Summers J. Smolec J.M. Snyder R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4533-4537Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Similar to other viruses the hepadnaviral genome is protected by a nucleocapsid, which is formed by icosahedrally arranged core proteins. The C-terminal domain of the core protein is rich in basic residues and bears three conserved serine phosphorylation sites (5Yu M. Summers J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2965-2969Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Liao W. Ou J.H. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1025-1029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While dispensable for capsid assembly, this region is required for packaging of pregenomic RNA (7Gallina A. Bonelli F. Zentilin L. Rindi G. Muttini M. Milanesi G. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 4645-4652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Beames B. Lanford R.E. Virology. 1993; 194: 597-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 9Nassal M. J.

Virol. 1991; 65: 2511-2517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inside the capsid the viral polymerase converts pregenomic RNA into minus-strand DNA, which in turn is completed to a double-stranded, relaxed circular (rc) DNA molecule (12Nassal M. Schaller H. Trends Microbiol. 1993; 1: 221-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Newly assembled, mature hepadnaviral capsids containing rcDNA have two possible fates: they can either be enveloped by surface proteins and enter the secretory pathway or be redirected to the nucleus where repair of the rcDNA molecule results in the formation of covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA, the template for viral RNA synthesis. Nuclear translocation of viral rcDNA is also mediated by incoming capsids in newly infected cells. However, the precise mechanisms regulating capsid trafficking and uncoating in both settings are unknown. Earlier studies in the DHBV model have shown that capsids from infected livers are highly phosphorylated while serum-derived capsids and particles secreted from cultured cells are dephosphorylated (13Mabit H. Schaller H. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 11472-11478Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 14Pugh J. Zweidler A. Summers J. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 1371-1376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, binding of in vitro generated HBV capsids to the nucleus of digitonin-permeabilized hepatoma cells was previously found to depend on the phosphorylation status of the core protein (15Kann M. Sodeik B. Vlachou A. Gerlich W.H. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Hepadnaviral capsid phosphorylation, therefore, represents a candidate mechanism for the regulated nuclear targeting and release of viral rcDNA during natural infection. In the present report we used genetically engineered phosphorylation mutants of DHBV core protein to test this hypothesis. The duck model offers the advantage that primary duck hepatocytes (PDH) are readily available and that DHBV infection of PDH with supernatants from transfected cells is highly efficient and reproducible. Position 245 within the C terminus of DHBV core was selected for detailed analysis since this site serves as a phosphate acceptor in transfected cells (5Yu M. Summers J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2965-2969Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and an earlier study had revealed an apparent effect of phosphoserine 245 on plus-strand DNA elongation (16Yu M. Summers J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4341-4348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have previously shown that the phenotype of two C-terminal deletion mutants is compatible with a potential key role of this position in capsid stability (17Kock J. Wieland S. Blum H.E. von Weizsacker F. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9116-9120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the effect of ionic charge at this position we also analyzed the potential effect of hydrogen bond formation. Our data suggest that hydrogen bonding is required for the stabilization of newly assembled mature capsids while a negative ionic charge at position 245 of the DHBV core protein plays an essential role in nuclear capsid transport and infectivity. Based on these results we propose a model for multiple capsid functions based on the coordinated core protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, hydrogen bond formation as well as DNA maturation. Cloning and Transfection—Mutant S245A and mutant S245D were generated by cloning the 391-bp EcoRI/AvrII fragment of the corresponding core protein expression vectors described by Yu and Summers (11Yu M. Summers J. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2511-2517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Yu M. Summers J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4341-4348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) into the overlength DHBV genome plasmid pOL16 (18Schlicht H.J. Radziwill G. Schaller H. Cell. 1989; 56: 85-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Mutant S245N was generated by cloning a PCR amplification product, in which the serine 245-coding triplet TCC was substituted by the asparagine-coding triplet AAC. The digested PCR fragment was ligated into EcoRI/BglII-digested overlength DHBV genome plasmid pOL16. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. To eliminate expression of the large surface protein, the 809 bp AvrII/XhoI fragment from plasmid 1165A (19Summers J. Smith P.M. Horwich A.L. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2819-2824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was ligated into the mutants described above. Chicken hepatoma LMH cells were seeded in 10-cm dishes and transfected by the calcium phosphate method (20Condreay L.D. Aldrich C.E. Coates L. Mason W.S. Wu T.T. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3249-3258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were harvested on day 3 post-transfection as described below. Western Blot Analysis—Transfected cells were detached from the culture dish by treatment with trypsin and resuspended in culture medium containing 8% fetal calf serum. The cells were sedimented and dissolved in 0.4 ml of Läemmli loading buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol. To reduce viscosity, the lysate was passed through QIAshredder centrifugal devices (Qiagen) before loading on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) by electroblotting. Proteins were detected with a DHBV core-specific rabbit antiserum described by Schlicht et al. (21Schlicht H.J. Kuhn C. Guhr B. Mattaliano R.J. Schaller H. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 2280-2285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and visualized by ECLplus chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Extraction and Detection of Viral DNA—Transfected cells were harvested as described above. To disrupt plasma membranes, cells were resuspended in chilled 1 ml of isotonic buffer (140 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl [pH 8.0]) containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Nuclei were removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 1,000 × g, and the supernatant was cleared from cell debris by centrifugation for another 5 min at 14,000 × g. A 0.4-ml aliquot of cytoplasmic extract was digested with 300 units/ml micrococcal nuclease (Amersham Biosciences) for 5 h at 37 °C in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2. The precipitate formed during incubation was removed by centrifugation, followed by inactivation of the nuclease by EDTA (final concentration, 5 mm). Viral DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) including RNase A treatment as recommended by the manufacturer. From a second 0.4-ml aliquot of cytoplasmic extract, DNA was isolated directly without micrococcal nuclease treatment. Purified DNA was digested with restriction enzyme PstI, which has one recognition motif within the vector sequence but none in the DHBV genome. Samples were loaded onto 1.3% agarose gels with a 3.0-kbp linear DHBV fragment included as a size marker. DNA was blotted onto positively charged nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences) and probed with 32P-labeled full-length DHBV genome in QuickHyb hybridization solution (Stratagene). Extraction and Detection of Packed Pregenomic RNA—Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as described above and treated with 150 units/ml micrococcal nuclease for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2 followed by inactivation of the nuclease by EDTA. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Kit from Qiagen. The purified RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase (Roche Applied Science) and purified again using the RNeasy columns. From an aliquot of cytoplasmic extract, total RNA was isolated directly without micrococcal nuclease treatment. Purified RNA was resolved on MOPS-buffered 1% agarose gel containing 1% formaldehyde and transferred onto positively charged nylon membrane. Cellular RNA was visualized by staining the blotting membrane with methylene blue and viral RNA was detected by hybridization with the 32P-labeled DHBV genome. Nuclease Titration Assay and Immunoprecipitation Experiment— Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from transfected and non-transfected cells. The extract from the non-transfected cells was mixed with purified viral DNA, adjusted to 2 mm CaCl2 and incubated with serially diluted micrococcal nuclease (5–0.005 units/ml) for1hat37 °C. Extract from transfected cells was treated exactly the same way in a parallel approach. DNA was prepared after inactivating the nuclease with EDTA as described above and visualized by Southern blotting. The immunoprecipitation experiment was performed with DHBV core specific antibodies (21Schlicht H.J. Kuhn C. Guhr B. Mattaliano R.J. Schaller H. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 2280-2285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) coupled to protein A-Sepharose (Sigma). Serum from a non-vaccinated rabbit served as a mock control. Incubations were done at 4 °C and the Sepharose sediment was extensively washed with chilled buffer (140 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Viral DNA was isolated from the sediment after protease digestion in ATL lysis buffer (QIAamp DNA Mini Kit). Detection of Covalently Closed Circular DNA in the Nuclei of Transfected Cells—Transfected LMH cells were harvested as described above and resuspended in 1 ml of isotonic buffer (140 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The suspension was centrifuged for 5 min at 1,000 × g. The pellet containing cell nuclei was dissolved in 0.4 ml of ATL lysis buffer (QIAamp DNA Mini Kit) and digested with 1 mg/ml proteinase K at 56 °C for 2 h. After adding RNaseA (final concentration 0.2 mg/ml), the lysate was passed through QIAshredder centrifugal devices, and DNA was extracted by adsorption onto silica columns. Purified DNA was digested with restriction enzyme DpnI that cuts transfected plasmid DNA into small fragments but leaves non-methylated viral DNA intact. Gel electrophoresis, using a circular 3.0-kbp plasmid DNA size marker, followed by Southern blot analysis was performed as described above. With this protocol, rcDNA, cccDNA as well as transfected plasmid DNA could be clearly separated on a single gel. For quantitative comparisons, the x-ray film was scanned in transparent modus and analyzed with the BAS-1500 Bio-imaging computer program (Fujifilm). Immunofluorescence Staining of Intracellular Core Protein—HuH-7 cells were seeded on collagen-coated cover slips and transfected with the Tfx-20 reagent (Promega). Starting on day 1 post-transfection, the cells were kept in starving culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% fetal calf serum) for 4 days. Afterward, the cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature, followed by rinsing the cover slips with PBS. Cell membranes were permeabilized by 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, followed by two washes with PBS. Unspecific binding sites were blocked with blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin and 10% goat serum in PBS) at 37 °C for 30 min. For immunostaining, the cover slips were incubated for 90 min at 37 °C with blocking buffer containing 1:200 diluted rabbit anti-DHBV core serum (D69, kind gift from H. Schaller, ZMBH, Heidelberg, Germany). After four washes with PBS at room temperature, the second antibody (affinity-purified FITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit, H+L Dianova) was exposed to the cells for 40 min at 37 °C at a dilution of 1:200. All incubations at 37 °C were performed in a humidified box. After immunostaining, the cells were washed four times at room temperature with PBS, followed by 10 min of incubation with 10 μg/ml propidium iodide in PBS and four additional washes with PBS. Afterward, the cells were embedded in DABCO (Sigma) containing 50 mg/ml Moviol (Hoechst). Localization of core protein and cell nuclei was performed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (Leica DM IRBE microscope) using the TRITC- and FITC-fittings at a pinhole size of 1. Gradient Sedimentation of Cellular Nucleocapsids—Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as described above and sedimented through a 10–50% (w/v) Nycodenz (Nycomed Pharma AS) gradient. Nycodenz was dissolved in isotonic buffer (140 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Approximately 0.4 ml of cytoplasmic extract was loaded onto a 1-ml gradient in polycarbonate tubes. Samples were centrifuged at 55,000 rpm for 40 min at 20 °C in a TLS55 swing-out rotor (Beckman Instruments). Nine 0.15-ml fractions were harvested from the top of the gradient (the majority of cellular proteins floated on the top of the gradient, whereas viral nucleocapsids sediment into lower fractions). An aliquot of each fraction was mixed with Läemmli loading buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol and analyzed by Western blotting. A second aliquot was processed for DNA extraction. Purified DNA was digested with PstI before agarose gel electrophoresis and Southern blotting. Gradient Centrifugation of Extracellular Particles—Supernatant from LMH cells was collected on day 3 post-transfection and concentrated using the UltraFree Biomax 100K centrifugal filter devices (Millipore). From one cell culture dish, 5 ml of supernatant were concentrated to a final volume of 0.4 ml. Concentrated supernatant was loaded onto a preformed 1-ml gradient consisting of 112–560 mg/ml cesium chloride in 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Centrifugation was performed for 20 h at 55,000 rpm at 10 °C in a TLS55 swing-out rotor. Enveloped DHBV particles accumulate in the middle of the gradient at a density of 1.2 g/ml, while non-enveloped nucleocapsids sediment at a density of 1.3 g/ml (14Pugh J. Zweidler A. Summers J. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 1371-1376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Summers J. Smith P.M. Huang M.J. Yu M.S. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1310-1317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gradient fractions were harvested as described above and diluted with water to a final volume of 0.4 ml, followed by DNA extraction, PstI digestion, and Southern blotting. Infection of Primary Hepatocytes—Primary hepatocytes were prepared from DHBV negative ducklings by two-step collagenase liver-perfusion as described before (23Tuttleman J.S. Pugh J.C. Summers J.W. J. Virol. 1986; 58: 17-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were maintained in Williams E medium supplemented with 1 μm dexamethasone, 15 mm HEPES pH 7.3, 1 μm insulin, and 2 mm glutamine. Supernatants from transfected LMH cells were collected on day 3 post-transfection and concentrated using UltraFree Biomax 100K centrifugal devices (Millipore). Viral particles were added to primary hepatocytes on day 1 post-seeding. Supernatant from one 10-cm dish was transferred to three wells of a 6-well plate with primary hepatocytes. 4-h postincubation, the culture medium was exchanged, followed by daily medium changes. To harvest the cells, culture medium was removed, and hepatocytes were dissolved in 0.4 ml of ATL lysis buffer. DNA was extracted by adsorption onto QIAamp columns and digested with PstI before agarose gel electrophoresis and Southern blotting. Design and Replication Competence of DHBV Capsid Mutants—Three overlength constructs were generated in which serine 245 of the DHBV core protein was substituted by alanine (S245A), aspartic acid (S245D), or asparagine (S245N). Aspartic acid and alanine are generally accepted standard substitutions of serine to mimic the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated state, respectively. Asparagine, which is structurally similar to aspartic acid, was included to also assess the potential influence of hydrogen bonds formed by non-phosphorylated serine. The 3′-region the hepadnaviral core open reading frame, which encodes the C-terminal domain of core, overlaps with the 5′-region of the viral polymerase open reading frame. For this reason site-directed mutagenesis in mutants S245D and S245N resulted in a concomitant substitution of the polymerase proline 64 by threonine. In mutant S245A the polymerase protein was unchanged. First, we investigated the expression levels of the respective core protein mutants by Western blot analysis after transfection of LMH cells. As shown in Fig. 1, all mutants produced wild-type levels of core protein. Next we analyzed the replication competence of the respective mutants. As shown in Fig. 2A, left panel, all mutants were replication competent. The overall level of replication was reduced to different degrees, however. For mutants S245D and S245N this finding is most likely due to the altered polymerase sequence, as revealed by trans-complementation experiments with a core-deficient overlength construct (data not shown). In the case of S245A, however, a direct effect of the core protein must be assumed. Northern blot analysis of total and capsid-associated viral RNA showed that RNA encapsidation was not reduced (Fig. 2B) suggesting that a later step of replication and/or capsid stability was affected. Relaxed Circular DNA Associated with S245A and S245D Is Sensitive to Nuclease Treatment—We have previously shown that two deletion mutants of DHBV core protein encompassing serine 245 yield capsids in which mature viral DNA is nuclease-sensitive (17Kock J. Wieland S. Blum H.E. von Weizsacker F. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9116-9120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Prompted by this observation we tested the nuclease sensitivity of the respective S245 substitution mutants. Incubation of capsids with micrococcal nuclease for 5 h resulted in an up to 50% decrease of total viral DNA (Fig. 2A, right panel). Strikingly, however, capsid-associated rcDNA but not ssDNA was nuclease-sensitive in mutants S245D and S245A. By contrast, the relative abundance of the respective DNA species was unchanged for wild-type and S245N (compare right and left panel, Fig. 2A). Degradation of S245D-associated rcDNA was observed after prolonged nuclease treatment only, while S245A-associated rcDNA was degradable within one hour, suggesting that S245D capsids were more nuclease-resistant than S245A capsids. To address the question whether S245A capsids offer any protection of rcDNA a nuclease titration assay was performed. As shown in Fig. 2C, S245A-associated rcDNA was more nuclease-resistant than naked rcDNA but the difference was small. These observations indicate that mutations of serine 245 affect the stability of mature, rcDNA-containing DHBV capsids. Structural Properties of Mutant Capsids—It was unclear whether destabilized capsids completely disintegrate during viral plus strand DNA synthesis and become physically separate from rcDNA or whether rcDNA remains associated with core protein. To address this issue S245A capsids were further analyzed by immunoprecipitation and density gradient sedimentation. Fig. 3 shows that rcDNA specifically co-precipitated with wild-type as well as mutant core protein. When subjected to density gradient sedimentation, rcDNA co-localized with particulate core protein (Fig. 4). Furthermore, there was no evidence for an accumulation of monomeric/dimeric core protein relative to particulate core protein, as would have been expected in the case of complete capsid disintegration. Identical results were obtained for mutants S245D and S245N (data not illustrated). It should be noted, however, that empty or RNA-containing capsids cannot clearly be distinguished from rcDNA-containing capsids in this assay. Plasmid DNA also entered the gradient in this experimental setting, most likely as calcium phosphate complexes. Importantly, however, the rcDNA peak co-localized with the core protein but not with plasmid DNA, indicating that the sedimentation pattern of rcDNA was not due to a nonspecific mechanism. This interpretation is confirmed by the fact that purified rcDNA did not enter the gradient (data not shown).Fig. 4Gradient sedimentation of viral nucleocapsids. Cytoplasmic extracts from transfected LMH cells were loaded onto a 10–50% Nycodenz gradient and centrifuged for 40 min at 200,000 × g. Nine fractions were collected from the top of the gradient, and analyzed for viral DNA by Southern blotting (upper panel) and for core protein by Western blotting (lower panel), respectively. A, wild-type control; B, mutant S245A. Fractions 7, 8, and 9 contain the bulk of viral DNA as well as the bulk of core protein. The faint signals in fractions 2 and 3 represent non-specifically detected cellular proteins that are also present in the non-transfected control (see Fig. 1, nt). Note that viral DNA co-sediments with particulate core protein. Mutant S245D and mutant S245N yielded exactly the same sedimentation profile as the wild-type control (data not shown). For abbreviations, see legend to Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mutants S245A and S245N Are Defective in Nuclear Targeting and cccDNA Formation—Next we investigated the potential effect of DHBV core protein phosphorylation on intracellular trafficking and cccDNA formation. Preventing viral surface protein synthesis enhances capsid recycling to the nucleus and cccDNA formation (19Summers J. Smith P.M. Horwich A.L. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2819-2824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore introduced a stop codon within the surface open reading frame of the respective overlength constructs. The subcellular localization of core protein mutants was assessed by confocal immunofluorescence laserscan microscopy of transfected HuH-7 cells. Fig. 5 shows a representative panel of core-positive cells for each mutant. While the staining pattern was not strictly homogenous, blinded analysis of each individual mutant revealed that wild-type and mutant S245D reproducibly generated intranuclear as well as cytosolic core protein. By contrast, the subcellular localization of core was predominantly cytoplasmic for mutants S245A and S245N with individual cells displaying a moderate nuclear core staining. This observation may be due to impaired nuclear import or accelerated nuclear export of core protein (24Mabit H. Breiner K.M. Knaust A. Zachmann-Brand B. Schaller H. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1968-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Identical results were obtained in LMH cells (data not shown). To assess cccDNA formation in the presence and absence of large surface protein expression we analyzed nuclei from transfected LMH cells by Southern blotting. As expected, only the surface-negative variants yielded strong cccDNA signals (Fig. 6A). For wild-type and mutant S245D high levels of cccDNA were observed. By contrast, cccDNA formation remained at lower levels for S245A and S245N (Fig. 6A, right panel and Fig. 6B). This finding was confirmed in three independent experiments. All Mutants Produce Enveloped Particles—We then investigated the competence of mutant capsids to enter the secretory pathway. Culture media of transfected cells were centrifuged to equilibrium in a cesium chloride gradient and fractions were analyzed by Southern blotting. Fig. 7 shows that all mutants were enveloped. Compared with wild-type, however, the respective levels in virion production were reduced. In particular, enveloped S245A particles were only detectable after prolonged exposure of the Southern blot. This result is best explained by the reduced overall replication rate of mutant S245A and by its selective deficiency of mature, rcDNA containing capsids. Mutant S245N Is Not Infectious in Primary Hepatocytes— Finally, the respective mutants were tested for their ability to infect primary duck hepatocytes. Due to the low amounts of enveloped virions obtained with mutant S245A, this study was restricted to mutants S245D and S245N. Supernatants of transfected LMH cells were added to primary duck hepatocytes, and the cells were harvested at the time points indicated. Successful infection was demonstrated by the accumulation of cccDNA and newly synthesized replicative intermediates. Productive infection of primary duck hepatocytes (PDH) by wild-type virions is shown in Fig. 8, A and B, left panels. Mutant S245D was also infectious, but the efficiency of infection was reduced with a faint signal of cccDNA becoming visible on day 7 postinfection (Fig. 8A, right panel). S245N virions attached efficiently to primary duck hepatocytes (Fig. 8B, right panel). Nevertheless, cccDNA and newly synthesized replicative intermediates were not detectable in cells inoculated with this mutant virus, though rcDNA originating from the inoculating virus remained visible up to 9 days in culture. Thus, mutant S245N generated stable capsids, which were unable to initiate a productive infection in PDH. In addition, this result rules out that the generation of replicative intermediates observed for wild-type and mutant S245D originated from transfection of residual plasmid DNA present in the inoculum rather than from a true infection. Taken together our results indicate that serine at position 245 of the DHBV core protein plays a key role in regulating the structural integrity and intracellular trafficking of mature, rcDNA containing nucleocapsids during different stages of the viral life cycle, most likely via its phosphorylation status. Wild-type and S245N capsids were nuclease-resistant while encapsidated mature viral DNA generated by mutants S245D and S245A was nuclease-sensitive. Possible reasons accounting for this observation include differences in local protein structure preferred by alanine and aspartic acid compared with serine and asparagine and/or electrostatic repulsion of DNA by aspartic acid. Furthermore, hydrogen bonding mediated by non-phosphorylated serine as well as asparagine may contribute to the stabilization of the quarterny structure of mature DHBV capsids. The precise structural properties of mutant capsids that are associated with the nuclease-sensitivity of mature viral DNA remain to be further elucidated. We obtained no evidence for a complete disintegration of mature S245A capsids in immunoprecipitation experiments and the density gradient sedimentation assay. It should be noted, however that, partially dissociated S245A capsids may have reassembled after DNA release with rcDNA remaining attached to the outside of the capsid. Alternatively, the sensitivity of rcDNA may simply be based on an increased “breathing” of the capsid. This phenomenon involves the slow release of capsid subunits followed by a rapid reformation of the capsid integrity, as discussed previously for HBV capsids (25Zlotnick A. Johnson J.M. Wingfield P.W. Stahl S.J. Endres D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14644-14652Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The fact that only mature rcDNA but not ssDNA associated with mutant capsids S245D and S245A was accessible to nuclease action indicates that DNA maturation itself is an important trigger of capsid destabilization. Possibly, interactions of viral DNA with the C terminus of the core protein are of importance in this context (26Hatton T. Zhou S. Standring D.N. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5232-5241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results shed new light on previous data, which had implicated that the C-terminal domain of DHBV core protein is required for DNA maturation. Rather, this report and our previous study on deletion and insertion mutants of the DHBV core protein (17Kock J. Wieland S. Blum H.E. von Weizsacker F. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9116-9120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that the phenotype of several mutants is at least in part due to nuclease sensitivity of mature viral DNA. The fact that nuclease treatment is commonly used to remove plasmid DNA prior to extraction of nucleocapsid associated hepadnaviral DNA explains why fully mature DNA forms have not been observed earlier. Indeed, we found that nuclease sensitivity of rcDNA also accounts for the phenotype of a previously described P246G mutant of DHBV core (16Yu M. Summers J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4341-4348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2J. Köck and F. von Weizsäcker, unpublished data. It will be interesting to determine the relevance of these observations for HBV core protein mutants. Our data suggest that negative charges at position 245 as contributed by phosphorylated serine or aspartic acid support nuclear targeting of DHBV core protein, cccDNA formation and infectivity. The residual cccDNA formation by mutant S245N could be due to nuclear import of small amounts of core protein mediated by the remaining, unchanged phosphorylation sites. This may be difficult to detect by immunofluorescence since the polyclonal anti-DHBV core antibody may not react well with core protein dimers in fixed cells. Alternatively, capsids might become entrapped non-specifically within the nucleus of dividing cells and be degraded subsequently. Nevertheless, our infection experiments in PDH demonstrate that the residual cccDNA formation by S245N does not suffice to initiate productive infection. Collectively, our observations suggest the following model: maturation of rcDNA within the nucleocapsid is an important trigger of capsid destabilization, which ultimately results in DNA release. During viral assembly hydrogen bonds formed by non-phosphorylated serine 245 contribute to the stabilization of nucleocapsids thus preventing DNA liberation in the cytoplasm. During infection, phosphorylation of serine 245 directs the capsid to the nucleus. At the same time nucleocapsids are destabilized thus facilitating rcDNA release in the nucleus. These mechanisms would also apply to progeny capsids that are redirected to the nucleus for cccDNA amplification. How newly formed DHBV capsids are directed to the secretory pathway remains to be elucidated, however, since Mabit and Schaller (13Mabit H. Schaller H. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 11472-11478Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) have shown that dephosphorylation alone is not sufficient to confer membrane affinity. The suggested model is in line with the previous observation in the duck model that serum-derived nucleocapsids are non-phosphorylated whereas nucleocapsids from liver tissue are highly phosphorylated (14Pugh J. Zweidler A. Summers J. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 1371-1376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that incoming and recycling capsids are phosphorylated by a capsid-associated kinase activity of cellular origin, which has been described in the WHV and HBV system (27Albin C. Robinson W.S. J. Virol. 1980; 34: 297-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Daub H. Blencke S. Habenberger P. Kurtenbach A. Dennenmoser J. Wissing J. Ullrich A. Cotten M. J.

Suppl. 1993; 8: 53-62PubMed Google Scholar, 33Kau J.H. Ting L.P. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3796-3803Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present report demonstrates a central role of serine 245 in regulating DHBV capsid trafficking and stability. Clearly, however, the remaining phosphorylation sites within DHBV core may play an important role as well, since earlier reports indicate that serine 259 also affects viral infectivity (10Schlicht H.J. Bartenschlager R. Schaller H. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 2995-3000Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Yu M. Summers J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4341-4348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It remains to be elucidated which and how many residues of individual nucleocapsids are phosphorylated at a given time point and how core protein phosphorylation is orchestrated during capsid assembly and disassembly. Further studies in the HBV and WHV system will have to establish whether mammalian core protein phosphorylation is essential for infectivity as well. The recently described infection of primary tupaia hepatocytes (34Kock J. Nassal M. MacNelly S. Baumert T.F. Blum H.E. von Weizsacker F. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5084-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) might represent a suitable model to address this question. Interestingly, phosphorylation of capsid protein by capsid-associated kinase activities has also been suggested to play a key role during the early steps of HIV infection (35Cartier C. Sivard P. Tranchat C. Decimo D. Desgranges C. Boyer V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19434-19440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, phosphorylation might represent a general mechanism regulating the targeted genome release from viral capsids. We thank J. Summers for stimulating discussions and for providing expression vectors encoding mutant DHBV proteins. Furthermore, we thank H. J. Schlicht and H. Schaller for the core-specific antibodies.

Subsequent dimerization occurs extremely rapidly (within less than a minute). The incoming monomer dimerizes with monomeric endogenous AAC suggesting that the AAC dimer is very dynamic.

The ADP/ATP carrier (AAC) 1The abbreviations used are: AAC, ADP/ATP carrier; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol. is one of the most abundant proteins present in the inner mitochondrial membrane (1Klingenberg M. Martonosi A.N. Enzymes of Biological Membranes: Membrane Transport. Vol. 3. Plenum, New York and London1976: 383-438Google Scholar). It catalyzes the transmembrane exchange of cytosolic ADP3– for mitochondrial ATP4–, the latter generated by oxidative phosphorylation. This protein is composed of three homologous modules, where each module consists of two membrane-spanning domains connected by a large hydrophilic loop extending into the matrix. AAC is a member of the mitochondrial carrier family that contains at least 40 different polypeptides in yeast with distinct substrate specificities (2El Moualij B. Duyckaerts C. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Sluse F.E. Yeast. 1997; 13: 573-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Unlike the majority of proteins imported into mitochondria that contain N-terminal presequences, AAC is synthesized without a cleavable extension in most species (3Smagula C. Douglas M.D. J. Biol.

Stage II involves the binding of individual AAC modules to Tom 70, which is proposed to function as a specific receptor for carriers (10Hines V. Brandt A. Griffiths G. Horstmann H. Brutsch H.

The translocation of AAC through the general import pore of the outer mitochondrial membrane (stage IIIa) may be facilitated by the formation of loop structures (7Wiedemann N. Pfanner N. Ryan M.T.

Loop formation may enable interaction between receptors and internal targeting signals, which would be physically separated if AAC imported as a linear polypeptide. The TIM10 complex, composed of Tim9 and Tim10 proteins subsequently binds to AAC, mediating the passage of the hydrophobic carrier across the intermembrane space (13Sirrenberg C. Endres M. Folsch H.

This carrier-chaperone complex is then guided to Tim12, which is peripherally attached to the outer surface of the inner membrane (stage IIIb).

Insertion of AAC into the TIM22 channel requires a membrane potential (stage IV), and its assembly into a functional homodimer in the membrane is referred to as stage V. Although Tim22 has been shown to be the key component for insertion of AAC (24Kovermann P. Truscott K.N. Guiard B. Rehling P. Sepuri N.B. Muller H. Jensen R.E. Wagner R. Pfanner N. Mol Cell. 2002; 9: 363-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), the nature of the stage (IV) intermediate and the mechanism of dimerization have not yet been elucidated. The translocation function of the ADP/ATP carrier is dependent on the formation of a 12 transmembrane assembly, which, in the case of yeast AAC, is ensured by the formation of a dimer between two six transmembrane monomers. An alternative arrangement is exemplified by the adenylate nucleotide translocator of the obligate parasite Rickettsia prowazekii and plastids of Arabidopsis thaliana that exhibit a single polypeptide of 12 putative transmembrane domains (25Winkler H.H. Neuhaus H.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 64-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The presence of a twelve transmembrane assembly to mediate small molecule translocation across a membrane is quite common among other translocation systems (26Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev.

Biochem. 2000; 69: 881-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Previous work using purified metabolite carriers (32Bisaccia F. Zara V. Capobianco L. Iacobazzi V. Mazzeo M. Palmieri F. Biochim Biophys Acta. 1996; 1292: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) had suggested that a cross-linked dimer has the capacity to insert into an artificial lipid bilayer. However, it is unknown whether in vitro synthesized, nascent AAC inserts as a monomer and subsequently assembles into a functional homodimer, or whether it inserts in a “pre-assembled” dimeric form in the mitochondrion. Additionally, the presence of conserved cysteine residues in yeast AAC indicates that dimeric formation may be dependent on intermolecular disulfide bonds, and/or facilitated by other Cys-specific chemical interactions. These are important questions that underpin the recognition of AAC by the specific TIM translocases during the different stages of import in vivo. In the present study we report that the precursor of the stage IV intermediate is a monomer. Subsequently, we demonstrate that the incoming monomeric precursor forms a dimer with preinserted endogenous AAC very rapidly (less than a minute under our experimental conditions), hence suggesting that the endogenous dimer exists in a dynamic form. The dimeric, mature form of this protein is resistant to reducing agents indicating intermolecular disulfide bonds are absent from the final structure, but the dimerization process is affected in cysteine mutants. This implicates the importance of cysteine residues in the proper assembly of dimeric AAC. Construction of the His-tagged AAC1 Plasmid—To introduce an N-terminal His tag to AAC1, the open reading frame was amplified from the plasmid pSP64-AAC1 with Deep Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs) using the polymerase chain reaction with the primers AACF (CGC CAT ATG CAT CAC CAT CAC CAT CAC TCT CAC ACA GAA ACA CAG) and AACR (CGC GAA TTC TCA CTT GAA TTT TTT GCC AAA CAT TAT GAG TTG). The PCR product was ethanol-precipitated, digested with the restriction enzymes NdeI and EcoRI, gel-purified, and ligated into the pET21b vector (Novagen) previously cut with NdeI and EcoRI to create the clone pET AAC2.2. Construction of Cysteine Mutants of AAC1—All mutants were made using the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to introduce single base mutations to change cysteine to serine codons, with the pSP64-AAC1 plasmid as template. For mutating the cysteine residue at position 63 (CS63), and creating the clone pSP64-M2.1, the primers CS63+ (ACA AGG GAA TTT TAG ATT CCT TCA AGA GGA CTG CGA C) and CS63– (GTC GCA GTC CTC TTG AAG GAA TCT AAA ATT CCC TTG T) were used. For mutating the cysteine residue at position 262 (CS262), and creating the clone pSP64-C5.4, the primers CS262+ (ACG ACG GTG CTC TGG ACT CTT TGA GAA AGA TTG TTC A) and CS262– (TGA ACA ATC TTT CTC AAA GAG TCC AGA GCA CCG TCG T) were used. For mutating the cysteine residue at position 279 (CS279), and creating the clone pSP64-C2.1, the primers CS279+ (ATT CCT TGT TCA AGG GCT CTG GTG CCA ACA TAT TTA G) and CS279– (CTA AAT ATG TTG GCA CCA GAG CCC TTG AAC AAG GAA T) were used. Underlined nucleotides show the position of the mutation. To generate the triple cysteine mutant plasmid pSP64-muC3 (CS3X), two rounds of mutation were performed on the plasmid pSP64-M2.1 (CS63) using the primer pairs CS262+/CS262– and CS279+/CS279–. Construction of AAC2 Plasmids—Plasmid (AAC2p)2 was constructed by insertion of a 2.4-kb EcoR1-Sal fragment of KSDIM5′3′ (35Tokatlidis K. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 305-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) containing two repeats of the ANC2 open reading frame into pSP65 (Promega), digested with the same restriction enzymes. Plasmid AAC2p was constructed by amplifying yeast genomic DNA using the oligonucleotides, AAC2p+ (CCG GAA TTC ATG TCT TCC AAC GCC CAA GCT) and AAC2p– (GCG GGA TCC TTA TTT GAA CTT CTT ACC AAA C). Following EcoR1-BamH1 digestion, the PCR product was subcloned into pSP65, digested with the same restriction enzymes. In Vitro Synthesis of Precursor Radiolabeled Proteins and Import into Isolated Mitochondria—Mitochondria were purified from lactate-grown wild-type (D273-10B) or (JL1-3-(AAC2)2 Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells as described in Refs. 33Luciano P.

Proteins were synthesized in vitro from plasmid using a coupled transcription/translation system with rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. Protein was synthesized from the pET AAC2.2 clone using T7 RNA polymerase (Amersham Biosciences). For synthesis of cold protein, the [35S]methionine was replaced by 1 mm unlabeled methionine. For synthesis from plasmids pSP64-AAC1, pSP64-M2.1, pSP64-C5.4, pSP64-C2.1 and pSP64-muC3, SP6 RNA polymerase was used. Mitochondria were preincubated for 5 min at 25 or 30 °C prior to import of the precursor. Lysate containing the precursor at a final 5–10% concentration was incubated at 25 or 30 °C for 15 min with 0.1 mg of purified mitochondria in import buffer containing 0.6 m sorbitol, 2mm KH2PO4,50mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2,5mm l-methionine, 0.1% (w/v) fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, and 50 mm HEPES-KOH, (pH 7.1). To generate or dissipate the membrane potential across the inner mitochondrial membrane, 2.5 mm NADH or 2 μm valinomycin, in the presence of 2 mm ATP was added to import buffer, respectively. Nonimported precursor was removed by treatment with 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K for 15 min and inactivated with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) for 10 min at 0 °C. Where indicated, mitochondria were treated with 0.1 mg/ml trypsin for 30 min on ice, followed by incubation with soybean trypsin inhibitor at a concentration of 0.4–1.0 mg/ml for 15 min (35Tokatlidis K. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 305-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). To chase stage III intermediates, after trypsin treatment, de-energized mitochondria with arrested precursors were resuspended in 0.6 m sorbitol, 2 mm NaH2PO4, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm l-methionine, 0.1% (w/v) fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 50 mm HEPES-KOH, (pH 7.1), 5 mm NADH, 2 mm ATP and incubated for 2 min at 30 °C. The chase was stopped by adding 2 μm valinomycin, 50 mm KCl, and 5 μm FCCP and incubation on ice. To generate mitoplasts after import, mitochondria were resuspended at a final concentration of 0.01 mg/ml in 20 mm HEPES, (pH 7.4) for 30 min on ice. Mitoplasts were resuspended in import buffer for 15 min in the presence of 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K. The protease was inhibited with 2 mm PMSF for 10 min at 0 °C. For alkali extraction, pellets were resuspended at 0.1–0.5 mg/ml in 100 mm Na2CO3 and incubated for 30 min on ice. Mitochondrial membranes were pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Solubilized samples were separated by 12% (w/v) (SDS-PAGE) or by blue native gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE). BN-PAGE—Mitochondrial protein (1 mg/ml) was solubilized in 1.6 mg/ml n-dodecylmaltoside, 50 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, (pH 7.4), 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF for 30 min on ice. Following centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 20 min, solubilized protein complexes were size-separated on a 6–16% linear poly-acrylamide gradient gel (33Luciano P. Vial S. Vergnolle M.A. Dyall S.D.

Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar). Following electrophoresis, the gel was destained in 7.5% (v/v) glacial acetic acid and 20% (v/v) methanol for 30 min and dried before exposure. Ni-NTA Affinity Purification of His-tagged Proteins—After import, a total of 0.2 mg of mitochondrial protein was solubilized in 1.6 mg/ml n-dodecylmaltoside, 50 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, (pH 7.4), 2.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm imidazole, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF for 30 min on ice. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 25,000 × g and mixed with 40 μl of a 50% (w/v) Ni-NTA Sepharose bead suspension (Novagen) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with solubilization buffer and resuspended in Laemmli buffer for analysis by SDS-PAGE or in solubilization buffer for analysis by BN-PAGE. Miscellaneous Methods—After drying, both SDS-PAGE and BN-PAGE gels were exposed to a phosphorimager (FUJI Bas station version 1.3) to detect radiolabeled proteins, followed by quantification with AIDA software. The standard (Std) represents 10% of the amount of radiolabeled precursor added in each reaction. ECL Western blotting was performed according to Ref. 33Luciano P. Vial S. Vergnolle M.A. Dyall S.D.

Import and Localization of HyAAC1 Is Similar to yAAC1—In order to see whether the addition of a histidine tag fused to the N terminus of yAAC1 affected import and localization of this protein, precursor HyAAC1 (see “Experimental Procedures”) was incubated with gradient-purified S. cerevisiae mitochondria and compared with yAAC1 (Fig. 1, A and B). 35S-Labeled in vitro synthesized HyAAC1 was imported into intact mitochondria and appeared as a major band at ∼30 kDa, similar to yAAC1 (Fig. 1, A and B). Some minor additional bands seen for the HyAAC1 (panel B) compared with yAAC1 (panel A) are probably due to the fact that a different promoter (T7 instead of Sp6, see “Experimental Procedures”) was used hence leading to internal start sites. To determine the localization of the imported precursor, mitochondria were converted into mitoplasts and treated with proteinase K. By selectively opening the outer membrane, protease digests any exposed proteins present in the intermembrane space. However, both HyAAC1 and yAAC1 were largely protease protected and resistant to alkali extraction, indicating proper integration into the inner membrane (Fig. 1, A and B) (31Popot J.L. Engelman D.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 881-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 32Bisaccia F. Zara V. Capobianco L. Iacobazzi V. Mazzeo M. Palmieri F. Biochim Biophys Acta. 1996; 1292: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The slightly lower band that predominates this fraction (i.e. stage V AAC) arises from the digestion of both N and C termini protruding into the intermembrane space of fully inserted mature HyAAC1 and yAAC1 (Fig. 1, A and B). The proper assembly of oligomers was assayed by BN-PAGE (Fig. 1C). Both HyAAC1 and yAAC1 migrated as a major band of ∼67 kDa, indicating dimerization of the protein. Higher oligomers were also present but in minor amounts and were seen as diffuse material (probably due to their variable size) at higher molecular weights. When mitochondria were incubated with valinomycin to dissipate the membrane potential prior to import, the monomeric form of HyAAC1 and yAAC1 was predominant (results not shown). HyAAC1 and yAAC1 were unable to integrate into the inner mitochondrial membrane in the absence of a proton motive force confirming that proper assembly into the lipid bilayer is dependent on a membrane potential (37Wachter C. Schatz G. Glick B.S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4787-4794Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 38Wachter C. Schatz G. Glick B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Nascent AAC1 First Inserts as a Monomer and Then Dimerizes in the Membrane with Endogenous AAC—In order to investigate whether newly imported monomeric AAC1 assembles into a dimer with itself or with endogenous AAC, equal amounts of yAAC1 and HyAAC1 were imported into the mitochondria. (i) If AAC1 dimerizes with itself prior to import, by importing equal amounts of AAC1 and HyAAC1, dimers could form from: (a) two monomers of yAAC1, (b) one monomer of AAC1 and HyAAC1, or (c) two monomers of HyAAC1. Statistically one would then obtain 25% of a, 50% of b, and 25% of c. To discriminate between yAAC1 and HyAAC1 in this mixture, only the former was 35S-labeled. In this case the only radioactive dimers would be from a and b, and the only radioactive signal after nickel-affinity purification of detergent-solubilized mitochondria would come from b. It would be expected that roughly 50% of the total radioactivity imported would be recovered after Ni-affinity purification. (ii) In contrast, if newly imported AAC1 or HyAAC1 forms a dimer not with itself but rather with endogenous AAC, then no radioactive signal at all would be obtained after Ni-affinity isolation of detergent-solubilized mitochondria. The above strategy is outlined in Fig. 2. We performed import experiments for either 35S-labeled HyAAC1 alone (HyAAC1), or a mix of equal amounts of cold HyAAC1 and 35S-labeled AAC1 (mix), or 35S-labeled AAC1 alone (AAC1) (Fig. 3). The assembly of a dimeric species was seen in all three cases following import (hot HyAAC1, hot/cold mix, or 35S-labeled yAAC1 (Fig. 3, panel A, lanes 2, 6, and 10). However, after nickel-affinity purification of solubilized mitochondria, the only radioactive dimeric form recuperated was that from 35S-labeled HyAAC1 imported alone (Fig. 3, panel B, lane 2). Although large amounts of dimer were formed in the mix (Fig. 3, panel A, lane 6), none of it could be recovered by Ni-affinity purification (Fig. 3, panel B, lane 6). As a negative control, no Ni-affinity radioactive dimer was isolated when hot AAC1 alone was imported. These data (Figs. 2 and 3) indicate that newly imported AAC1 dimerizes with endogenous AAC and suggest that the endogenous AAC in the membrane must be in a dynamic state that allows dissociation into monomers that can dimerize with incoming nascent AAC1 monomers. It could be argued that during the time of import (20 min), newly imported AAC1 may have initially self-dimerized, inserted into the membrane as a dimer, and subsequently dissociated reforming a dimer with endogenous AAC. To investigate this possibility, precursors were arrested at stage III by dissipating the membrane potential for 20 min to have similar amounts of precursor accumulating as in energized mitochondria and then chased by restoring the membrane potential for only 2 min (Fig. 3, all panels, lanes 4, 8, and 12). A dimer formed in all three cases (Fig. 3, panel A, lanes 4, 8, and 12). In this case also, the only radioactive dimer that was isolated by Ni-affinity was that of imported HyAAC1 alone (Fig. 3, panel B, lane 4). No radioactivity was recovered, even upon overexposure (data not shown), in the mix, or after import and chase of AAC1 alone (Fig. 3, panels B and C, lanes 8 and 12). This demonstrates that AAC1 is forming a dimer with endogenous AAC within 2 min after insertion into the lipid bilayer. Monomeric AAC Inserts More Efficiently Than Dimeric AAC in Organello—To further investigate the native state of AAC at a stage IV form, monomeric (AAC2p), and covalent tandem dimer (AAC2p)2 of isoform 2 was in vitro synthesized and imported into wild-type mitochondria (Fig. 4). As expected, the amount of inserted AAC2p and (AAC2p)2 increased with time. After 20 min of import, the amount of AAC2p in the inner mitochondrial membrane was approximately three times higher than (AAC2p)2 (Fig. 4). The fact that in vivo the same number of active ATP translocation sites was detected for either the covalent tandem dimer (strain JL1–3-(AAC2)2) or the wild-type strain (34Trezeguet V. Le Saux A. David C. Gourdet C. Fiore C. Dianoux A. Brandolin G. Lauquin G.J. Biochim Biophys Acta. 2000; 1457: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) could be attributed to differences of maturation/stability of the dimer after insertion, or the possibility that some of the endogenous AAC remains in a monomeric state. An additional experiment was carried out to demonstrate the stage IV form of the adenine nucleotide carrier is monomeric, whereby nascent AAC2p was imported into (JL1–3-(AAC2)2 mitochondria containing only the tandem dimer (AAC2p)2 form (Fig. 5). The formation of dimer was reduced by ∼50% at 30 min when AAC2p imported into (JL1–3-(AAC2)2 in comparison to wild-type mitochondria (Fig. 5). To resolve whether the observed differences in the kinetics of import between the wild type and the JL1–3-(AAC2)2 was due to a difference in endogenous levels of components of the protein translocation machinery, we compared the protein profiles of the two types of mitochondria by Western analysis. (Fig. 6). The AAC2p antiserum detects mainly a polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 62 kDa in (JL1–3-(AAC2)2 mitochondria expressing the covalent tandem dimer (34Trezeguet V. Le Saux A. David C. Gourdet C. Fiore C. Dianoux A. Brandolin G. Lauquin G.J. Biochim Biophys Acta. 2000; 1457: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Some very weak band that would correspond to a monomeric AAC2 is also detected suggesting some degradation of the covalent dimer to a monomer. This could account for some of the dimerization with the incoming monomeric precursor. All other marker proteins tested were present in similar amounts (Fig. 6). Taken together, these data indicate that the difference in kinetics is most likely caused by the inability of the covalently linked dimer form of AAC2 to associate as such with incoming precursor. The Dimeric Form of yAAC1 Does Not Depend on Intermolecular Disulfide Bonds—There are three conserved cysteine residues in yAAC1 and AACs from other eukaryotes. These residues apparently affect ATP translocation of bovine AAC (39Hoffmann B. Stockl A. Schlame M. Beyer K. Klingenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1940-1944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but it is unknown whether they are also involved in insertion, or dimerization, or both. To test this, an experiment was carried out to see whether dimerization of yAAC1 was due to formation of disulfide bonds between monomers. Following import of yAAC1 into mitochondria, mitoplasts were produced in the presence of proteinase K and either extracted with alkali for SDS-PAGE (Fig. 7A) or detergent-solubilized for BN-PAGE (Fig. 7B). We found that only a minor proportion of the ∼60-kDa species was DTT-sensitive as shown on SDS-PAGE (between 5 and 10% of the total signal). Actually, this DTT-sensitive species proved to be an artifact of the carbonate extraction procedure (data not shown). The vast majority of dimer formed is not dependent on intermolecular disulfide bonds, can already be seen after 1 min of import and increases with time (Fig. 7B). These data, in support of our previous results shown in Fig. 3, indicate that dimer formation can occur very fast (less than 1 min shown by BN-PAGE). The assembled yAAC1 dimer does not contain intersubunit disulfide bonds. Specific Dimerization of yAAC1, but Not Insertion, Is Mediated by Cysteine Residues—To see whether the lack of cysteine residues affects import and dimerization of in vitro synthesized yAAC1, as opposed to just mediating intermolecular disulfide bonds in the dimer, cysteine mutants were constructed (see “Experimental Procedures”). All three conserved cysteine residues were mutated to serine residues to create single point mutations or a triple point mutation in yAAC1 (Fig. 8A). In Fig. 8, B and C, precursor proteins were initially imported into mitochondria, which were subsequently osmotically ruptured to form mitoplasts in the presence of proteinase K, followed by carbonate extraction (to generate stage V). In panel B, import kinetics of precursor C63S over a period of 10 min was similar to that observed with yAAC1 indicating that a single point mutation in the first matrix loop connecting the first two transmembrane domains does not significantly affect insertion into the mitochondrial inner membrane. In panel C, import kinetics of C262S, C279S, and C3XS were also comparable to C63S. Interestingly, C262S and C279"
https://openalex.org/W2034246810,"A tumor suppressor gene product, ARF, sensitizes cells to apoptosis in the presence of appropriate collateral signals. In this study, we analyzed the mechanism of ARF-dependent apoptosis and demonstrated that ARF induces mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in p53 wild-type, ARF/p16-null cells. We also found that ARF evokes cytochrome c release from mitochondria, decreases mitochondrial membrane potential, and activates pro-caspase-9 to induce apoptosis. Our findings suggest that this apoptotic cellular modulation is brought about by up-regulation of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins Bax and Bim and down-regulation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 in mitochondrial fractions. Additionally, ARF seems to down-regulate Bcl-2 in a p53-dependent manner while up-regulating Bax/Bim via a p53-independent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2070346524,"Blood-sucking arthropods possess a variety of anti-hemostatic factors in their salivary glands to maintain blood fluidity during feeding. In this work we demonstrate the anti-hemostatic properties of lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) isolated from the salivary glands of Rhodnius prolixus. First, we examined salivary glands of fourth and fifth instar nymphs for their phospholipid composition. The lumen displayed an accumulation of its phospholipid content, mainly phosphatidylcholine and lysoPC, with a 6-fold increase for the latter. To determine the presence of phospholipids in the saliva, fourth instar nymphs were fed with a32P-enriched blood meal. After 28 days their saliva was collected and subjected to lipid extraction, thin-layer chromatography, and autoradiography. The results showed the presence in the saliva of the same phospholipids present in the lumen. We then examined possible biological roles of these phospholipids when compared with other known effects of lysoPC. The luminal lipid extract and purified lysoPC from the lumen and saliva were tested for inhibition of washed rabbit platelets' aggregation induced by α-thrombin and platelet-activating factor. Both the luminal lipid extract and salivary lysoPC showed an increasing inhibition of aggregation, which correlated with the response of the platelets to standard lysoPC (up to 13 μg/ml). Next, salivary lysoPC was incubated with porcine arterial endothelial cells for 24 h. After incubation, culture medium was assayed for nitric oxide and showed increased nitric oxide production, similar to control cells exposed to standard lysoPC (up to 20 μg/ml). Together these data demonstrate the presence of lysoPC in the saliva of Rhodnius prolixus and its potential anti-hemostatic activities. Blood-sucking arthropods possess a variety of anti-hemostatic factors in their salivary glands to maintain blood fluidity during feeding. In this work we demonstrate the anti-hemostatic properties of lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) isolated from the salivary glands of Rhodnius prolixus. First, we examined salivary glands of fourth and fifth instar nymphs for their phospholipid composition. The lumen displayed an accumulation of its phospholipid content, mainly phosphatidylcholine and lysoPC, with a 6-fold increase for the latter. To determine the presence of phospholipids in the saliva, fourth instar nymphs were fed with a32P-enriched blood meal. After 28 days their saliva was collected and subjected to lipid extraction, thin-layer chromatography, and autoradiography. The results showed the presence in the saliva of the same phospholipids present in the lumen. We then examined possible biological roles of these phospholipids when compared with other known effects of lysoPC. The luminal lipid extract and purified lysoPC from the lumen and saliva were tested for inhibition of washed rabbit platelets' aggregation induced by α-thrombin and platelet-activating factor. Both the luminal lipid extract and salivary lysoPC showed an increasing inhibition of aggregation, which correlated with the response of the platelets to standard lysoPC (up to 13 μg/ml). Next, salivary lysoPC was incubated with porcine arterial endothelial cells for 24 h. After incubation, culture medium was assayed for nitric oxide and showed increased nitric oxide production, similar to control cells exposed to standard lysoPC (up to 20 μg/ml). Together these data demonstrate the presence of lysoPC in the saliva of Rhodnius prolixus and its potential anti-hemostatic activities. Hematophagous arthropods rely on a wide array of anti-hemostatic substances to counteract vertebrate responses to blood loss and to obtain their blood meal successfully (1Ribeiro J.M.C. Infect. Agents Dis. 1995; 4: 143-152PubMed Google Scholar). These salivary compounds show distinct properties and are generally involved with inhibition of coagulation, platelet aggregation, and vasoconstriction (2Stark K.R. James A.A. Parasitol. Today. 1996; 12: 430-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These molecules include peptides such as tachykinins (3Champagne D.E. Ribeiro J.M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Exp. Parasitol. 1992; 74: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The small lesions elicited by the mouthparts of the arthropod most likely evoke platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction by the vertebrate host. Therefore, the formation of the platelet plug is specifically inhibited by collagen inhibitors, apyrases, catechol oxidases, thrombin inhibitors, NO-releasing proteins, fibrinogen receptor agonists, and a specific platelet aggregation inhibitor (7Law J.H. Ribeiro J.M.C. Wells M.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 87-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 8Francischetti I.M.B. Ribeiro J.M.C. Champagne D. Andersen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12639-12650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The complexity of anti-hemostatic mechanisms has recently been addressed with the use of proteomic techniques (9Valenzuela J.G. Pham V.M. Garfield M.K. Francischetti I.M. Ribeiro J.M. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 1101-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 10Francischetti I.M.B. Valenzuela J.G. Pham V.M. Garfield M.K. Ribeiro J.M.C. J. Exp. Biol. 2002; 205: 2429-2451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hundreds of gene sequences were obtained, and most of them await future tests concerning the anti-hemostatic properties of the proteins they code for. Lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) is a component of oxidized low-density lipoprotein, which is involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and inflammation (11Berliner J.A. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Frank J.S. Demer L.L. Edwards P.A. Watson A.D. Lusis A.J. Circulation. 1995; 91: 2488-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar, 12Chisolm G.M. Steinberg D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1815-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Recently, great research efforts have been directed to understand and characterize lysoPC effects on cell biology (13Chisolm III, G.M. Chai Y. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1697-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The list is continuously growing and is quite diverse, including the induction of endothelial genes involved in early atherosclerosis, such as adhesion molecules and growth factors (14Kume N. Cybulsky M.I. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1138-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 15Kume N. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 907-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), and secretion of matrix metalloproteinase (16Inoue N. Takeshita S. Gao D. Ishida T. Kawashima S. Akita H. Tawa R. Sakurai H. Yokoyama M. Atherosclerosis. 2001; 155: 45-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Indeed, the lysoPC content of atherosclerotic arteries is higher than in normal vessels, and oxidized low-density lipoprotein displays a great proportion of lysoPC (17Parthasarathy S. Steinbrecher U.P. Barnett J. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3000-3004Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). LysoPC is able to increase the production of NO by endothelial cells by enhancing endothelial NO synthase (e-NOS) transcription (18Zembowicz A. Tang J. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17006-17010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 19Hirata K. Miki N. Kuroda Y. Sakoda T. Kawashima S. Yokoyama M. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 958-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), besides acting as an inhibitor of platelet aggregation (20Yuan Y. Jackson S.P. Newnham H.H. Mitchell C.A. Salem H.H. Blood. 1995; 86: 4166-4174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This evidence shows that lysoPC is potentially pro-atherogenic by inducing the production of several growth factors and the expression of chemoattractant genes (21Rong J.X. Berman J.W. Taubman M.B. Fisher E.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 1617-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). On the other hand, lysoPC also can display an important anti-atherogenic function because it increases the local synthesis of NO in the initial phases of the formation of atherosclerotic plaques, leading to vasodilation (22Cooke J.P. Tsao P.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 653-655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Gewaltig M.T. Kojda G. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 55: 250-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). To date, anti-hemostatic activities found in salivary secretions from blood-feeding arthropods are mainly of proteic nature or are gases such as NO (24Montfort W.R. Weichsel A. Andersen J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In the present study we demonstrate, for the first time, the presence of phospholipids in the saliva of a blood-sucking insect, Rhodnius prolixus. The dynamics of the accumulation of phospholipids in the growing salivary glands, as well as salivary lysoPC anti-hemostatic properties, are also described. Obtainment of Salivary Glands and Phospholipid Profile Analysis— Insects were reared and handled as described previously (25Golodne D.M. van Heusden M.C. Gondim K.C. Masuda H. Atella G.C. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 31: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Fourth and fifth instar nymphs of R. prolixus kept in our departmental colony at 28 °C, 70% humidity and fed at 28-day intervals were used in this study. Salivary glands were isolated in a drop of saline, cleaned of any adhering tissue, rinsed twice in saline, and gently punctured under a stereo-microscope by means of a fine syringe needle, while holding the gland with forceps. The emptied epithelium was removed from the drop and further rinsed, and the drop containing the luminal contents was recovered. Both samples were subjected to lipid extraction (26Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). The phospholipid profile of the salivary glands was examined after TLC on silica gel plates using a mixture of acetone:methanol:acetic acid:chloroform:water (15:13:12:40:8, v/v). After evaporation of the solvents the plate was immersed for 15 s in a charring solution consisting of 10% CuSO4, 8% H3PO4 and heated to 170 °C for 5–10 min (27Ruiz J.I. Ochoa B. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1482-1489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The charred TLC plate was then subjected to densitometric analysis. Each phospholipid spot was identified by comparing to phospholipid standards (Sigma) run in parallel. Salivary Gland Labeling— 32P-labeled salivary glands were obtained following a 32P-enriched blood meal offered to fourth instar nymphs, using established procedures (28Silva-Neto M.A. Atella G.C. Fialho E. Paes M.C. Zingali R.B. Petretski J.H. Alves E.W. Masuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30227-30232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). After 28–30 days, the molted fifth instar nymphs were dissected and their salivary glands removed and analyzed as above. Following TLC, the plate was subjected to autoradiography, and the corresponding 32P-phospholipids were scraped from the plate after coating with Strip-Mix (Alltech, Deerfield, IL) and subjected to liquid scintillation counting. Saliva Obtainment—Fifth instar nymphs were allowed to repeatedly probe a Parafilm membrane of an artificial feeder filled with deionized water for 2 min. After several collection cycles the contents of the artificial feeder were collected, and the Parafilm was cut and rinsed with methanol. Samples were combined and subjected to lipid extraction. To obtain 32P-labeled saliva, fourth instar nymphs were fed with a 32P-enriched blood meal as described above, and saliva was collected after 28–30 days. Lipid Extraction from TLC Plate—Purification of TLC-separated lipids was performed essentially as described by Yuan et al. (20Yuan Y. Jackson S.P. Newnham H.H. Mitchell C.A. Salem H.H. Blood. 1995; 86: 4166-4174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with modifications. Briefly, after staining with iodine, the target phospholipid spot was scraped into glass tubes and vortexed with 4 ml of an extraction solution consisting of methanol:iso-butanol:H2O (45.8:11.5: 42.7, v/v). Tubes were heated to 55 °C in a dry bath incubator for 20 min, centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 2 min, and the supernatant was collected. This procedure was repeated two more times, and to the combined supernatants (∼12 ml) 3 ml of chloroform were added. After intense vortexing and centrifugation (3000 rpm, 8 min), the lower organic phase was recovered and dried under a stream of N2. Purified lipids were then resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and used in the assays. Platelet Aggregation Assays—Washed rabbit platelets were obtained from blood anticoagulated with 5 mm EDTA. Platelets were isolated by centrifugation and washed twice according to Zingali et al. (29Zingali R.B. Jandrot-Perrus M. Guillin M.C. Bon C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10794-10802Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) with calcium-free Tyrode's buffer, pH 6.5, containing 0.1% glucose, 0.2% gelatin, 0.14 m NaCl, 0.3 m NaHCO3, 0.4 mm NaH2PO4, 0.4 mm MgCl2, 2.7 mm KCl, and 0.2 mm EGTA. Washed platelets were resuspended in a modified Tyrode's buffer, pH 7.4, containing 2 mm CaCl2 at 300,000–400,000 cells/μl. Assays were performed at 37 °C using a Chronolog Aggregometer (Havertown, PA). Aggregation in the volume of 300 μl was induced either by α-thrombin (5 μl of a 60-nm stock solution, 1 nm final concentration) or platelet-activating factor (PAF) (5 μl of a 100-nm stock solution, 1.67-nm final concentration). Molecules to be tested for inhibition of platelet aggregation were added 1 min before induction. The inhibition was calculated using the maximum peak height of each tracing, which was compared with control incubation values. Cell Culture and NO Production—Porcine aortas were obtained in a local slaughterhouse, and endothelial cells (PAEC) were isolated after dissection of the aortic artery. Arteries were cut open longitudinally, exposing the endothelium. After being rinsed several times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, a small amount of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was added, the surface was gently scrubbed with a cell scraper, and cells were recovered. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (for 3–4 passages) and seeded in 6-well plates. Twenty-four hours before each experiment, serum-free fresh medium was added. Incubations were carried out for 24 h with serum-free medium (1 ml), after which the culture medium was recovered. To determine the nitrite content, 50-μl aliquots were incubated with 10 μl of a solution containing 2,3-diaminonaphtalene (DAN, Calbiochem) for 10 min in a final volume of 100 μl according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reactions were terminated with 20 μl of 2.8 m NaOH, diluted to 1 ml with deionized water, and the fluorescent nitrite adduct was measured at 365 nm excitation and 450 nm emission. LysoPC Is Accumulated in Salivary Glands—After blood feeding, insects have to refill the contents of their salivary glands while preparing for a next blood meal. To characterize the phospholipid profile of R. prolixus salivary glands, we used fourth instar nymphs from day 7 post blood meal and nymphs from day 28 post blood meal (already molted to fifth instars). The luminal contents and the epithelium were separated and subjected to TLC. The results confirmed the presence of phospholipids in both compartments with an overall increase from day 7 to 28 (Fig. 1A). LysoPC content is specifically increased by ∼6-fold in the lumen of the gland after insect molting, which represents the greatest increase among all lipid classes analyzed. The epithelium displayed great amounts of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine, and to a lesser extent, sphingomyelin, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidic acid, and a non-determined lipid, with trace amounts of lysoPC (Fig. 1C). Most importantly, the profile of luminal phospholipids was quite different from that observed for the epithelium, consisting mainly of PC and lysoPC with minor amounts of sphingomyelin, phosphatidylinositol, and a non-determined lipid (Fig. 1B). The percentage of each phospholipid remained roughly constant in both compartments throughout development, with the exception of luminal lysoPC (increasing from 5% on day 7 to 13% on day 28) and PC (decreasing from 73% on day 7 to 60% on day 28). Therefore, on day 28 when the glands have already been refilled and the nymphs are ready for a new blood meal, the concentration of luminal lysoPC of a single salivary gland pair would be 75 μg/ml, as estimated with a standard lysoPC curve. Following a 32P-enriched blood meal, we verified the incorporation of label in the phospholipids present both in the lumen and epithelium of the salivary glands (Fig. 2) with a pattern similar to that observed with non-labeled phospholipids from the 28th day post blood meal. Next, we sought to determine whether the saliva also contained these phospholipids. After collection of saliva from 32P-labeled nymphs (Fig. 3) and lipid extraction followed by TLC (Fig. 3A), the autoradiograph confirmed the presence of labeled PC and lysoPC (Fig. 3B). The amount of label in each phospholipid present in the saliva was determined (Fig. 3C) and found to be similar to the profile previously observed for the luminal phospholipids. Therefore, these experiments linked blood feeding with the refilling of phospholipids (and other anti-hemostatic components) in the salivary glands: nymphs are able to use precursor molecules obtained from their meal to accumulate luminal phospholipids that could be used during the next feeding. The experiments also show that phospholipids, including lysoPC, are a component of R. prolixus saliva.Fig. 3Phospholipid composition of the saliva. Fourth instar insects (n = 200) were fed with a 32P-enriched blood meal (<1μCi of 32P per insect). After 28–32 days, molted insects were separated in small groups (20 each) and the saliva collected by means of an artificial feeder filled with deionized water. Samples were subjected to lipid extraction, followed by TLC (panel A, iodine-stained) and autoradiography (panel B). Radioactive spots were scraped and subjected to liquid scintillation counting (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Salivary LysoPC Shows Anti-hemostatic Properties—To clarify the possible roles of this lipid component present in the saliva we focused on lysoPC, a molecule with well documented effects in important aspects of hemostasis. The first possibility analyzed was that the presence of lysoPC in saliva injected into the vessel could inhibit platelet aggregation. When washed rabbit platelets were induced to aggregate by α-thrombin and PAF, addition of increasing amounts of standard lysoPC resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition (Fig. 4A). This inhibition was also verified when the assay was promoted in the presence of the luminal lipid extract; when using extract from 20 pairs of salivary glands, the final concentration of lysoPC in the assay corresponds to 10 μg/ml (Fig. 4B). This effect suggested lysoPC as an effective component of the luminal lipids in platelet aggregation inhibition. When lysoPC was purified from the luminal extract (Fig. 4C), addition of increasing amounts of this purified lysoPC to the platelet suspension led to a similar inhibition response (Fig. 4D). Control assays showed that either PC or lysophosphatidylethanolamine, respectively a lysoPC parent molecule and a related lysophospholipid, could not inhibit platelet aggregation (Fig. 4D, inset). PC purified from the lumen showed no inhibition of aggregation, similar to standard PC (data not shown). By adding excess inducers (9-fold for PAF and 140-fold for α-thrombin) in the presence of lysoPC, aggregation was readily restored, confirming platelet viability (data not shown). Moreover, lysoPC purified from the saliva elicited a marked inhibition on platelet aggregation induced by α-thrombin (Fig. 4E). Hence the lysoPC found in the lumen of the salivary glands and secreted into the vertebrate host as saliva acts as an inhibitor of platelet aggregation. Another important effect of lysoPC is increased NO production by endothelial cells. Using cultured PAEC we were able to test the effect of standard lysoPC or salivary lysoPC on the amount of NO end products released to the culture medium (Fig. 5). Cells incubated with increasing amounts of standard lysoPC showed an increase in NO production when compared with control cells, whereas standard PC was ineffective (Fig. 5, inset). When cells were exposed to the purified salivary lysoPC there was a correspondent increase in NO production similar to that observed for the standard lysoPC response; salivary PC did not elicit NO production in these cells. These data confirm that the lysoPC present in the saliva is able to increase NO production by the endothelial cells in culture. Hematophagous arthropods are able to effectively block the host's response that would lead to reduced blood ingestion. In R. prolixus the main anti-hemostatic activities can be assigned to a series of NO-releasing proteins denoted nitrophorins, which release NO when injected into the bloodstream of the host, leading to increased vasodilation and inhibition of platelet aggregation; to an apyrase, which upon cleavage of ADP also reduces platelet aggregation; and finally to an ADP-binding lipocalin termed RPAI-1 (R. prolixus aggregation inhibitor-1) (8Francischetti I.M.B. Ribeiro J.M.C. Champagne D. Andersen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12639-12650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Hence the formation of the platelet plug is the target for several molecules described in R. prolixus saliva, as well as other arthropods. The lipid profile of the salivary glands of blood-sucking arthropods has been examined in detail for the lone-star tick, Amblyomma americanum (30Shipley M.M. Dillwith J.W. Essenberg R.C. Howard R.W. Sauer J.R. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1993; 23: 37-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this case careful work has been undertaken in analyzing the arachidonic acid (AA) profile associated with each lipid present in the salivary glands of the tick, especially phospholipids, and in relating AA levels to the occurrence of salivary prostaglandins. One of the main aspects concerning the presence of these prostaglandins, besides immunosuppressive and vasodilatory activities, is platelet aggregation inhibition. Thus, ticks are able to produce prostaglandins from AA derived from dietary lipids, which is mobilized upon hydrolysis of phospholipids present in the epithelium of the salivary glands by phospholipase A2 (31Bowman A.S. Dillwith J.W. Sauer J.R. Parasitol. Today. 1996; 12: 388-396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, these studies focus on the neutral lipid and phospholipid profiles of whole salivary glands, using homogenized glands as the starting material. Also, the phospholipids present in the epithelium are considered mainly as a source of AA, which is subsequently converted to prostaglandins via the cyclooxygenase pathway and secreted into the lumen. The presence of salivary prostaglandins is, to date, the only demonstration of lipid-derived anti-hemostatic molecules in arthropods. The present work is the first to consider the presence of phospholipids in the salivary glands, besides the epithelium of the glands, where the presence of phospholipids is expected because of its membranous structure. We have examined the lumen of glands for their phospholipid content because it contains the salivary secretion to be injected into the host. The method used throughout this work, consisting of extrusion of the luminal contents followed by recovery and analysis of the separated “compartments,” unequivocally showed the presence of phospholipids in the lumen of the glands with a distinct composition when compared with the epithelium. This luminal phospholipid profile suggested to us that phospholipids are possibly being injected into the vertebrate bloodstream during feeding. To further demonstrate this and confirm their occurrence, we collected saliva from insects, and the analysis showed the main presence of PC and lysoPC. The presence of lysoPC in the saliva would suggest the possibility of increasing blood-feeding effectiveness by reducing anti-hemostatic responses. Accordingly, some of the diverse cellular responses to lysoPC are related to counteracting hemostasis, mainly by inhibiting platelet aggregation (20Yuan Y. Jackson S.P. Newnham H.H. Mitchell C.A. Salem H.H. Blood. 1995; 86: 4166-4174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and increasing the amount of e-NOS in endothelial cells (32Li H. Wallerath T. Förstermann U. Nitric Oxide. 2002; 7: 132-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The salivary lysoPC elicited an increased production of NO in PAEC. This effect is similar to the described response for lysoPC in other cultured endothelial cells. The role of lysoPC in the increased synthesis of e-NOS has been clarified in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and bovine arterial endothelial cells (18Zembowicz A. Tang J. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17006-17010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 19Hirata K. Miki N. Kuroda Y. Sakoda T. Kawashima S. Yokoyama M. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 958-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Treatment of endothelial cells with lysoPC resulted in an increased transcription of the e-NOS mRNA in these cells, followed by an increased amount of protein and the corresponding activity. The time span needed for this response (33Cieslik K. Zembowicz A. Tang J. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14885-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 34Cieslik K. Abrams C.S. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1211-1219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 18Zembowicz A. Tang J. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17006-17010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) in the case of injected saliva would preclude a significant role of lysoPC regarding the increase in local NO levels, because the feeding of R. prolixus is successfully accomplished in a few minutes (35Ribeiro J.M.C. Garcia E.S. J. Exp. Biol. 1981; 94: 219-230Google Scholar). Perhaps in ticks, which remain attached to the host on the same site for a greater period, this role of lysoPC would be more noticeable. Among the effects evoked by lysoPC, evidence shows that it has potent platelet inhibitory effects (20Yuan Y. Jackson S.P. Newnham H.H. Mitchell C.A. Salem H.H. Blood. 1995; 86: 4166-4174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is essential for the inhibition of aggregation by secretory phospholipase A2 (20Yuan Y. Jackson S.P. Newnham H.H. Mitchell C.A. Salem H.H. Blood. 1995; 86: 4166-4174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which uses circulating lipoproteins as a lipid substrate source. Inhibition was verified with a number of different agonists, involving inhibition of fibrinogen binding and platelet shape change (20Yuan Y. Jackson S.P. Newnham H.H. Mitchell C.A. Salem H.H. Blood. 1995; 86: 4166-4174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of this inhibition involves a stimulatory G-protein linked to the activation of adenylyl cyclase, which results in the accumulation of cytosolic cAMP, an event that down-regulates all signaling events required for activation (36Yuan Y. Schoenwaelder S.M. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27090-27098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The potent inhibition of platelet aggregation promoted by lysoPC purified from both the lumen and saliva confirms its role as an anti-hemostatic molecule. In this case, as opposed to the long-term response leading to increased NO, the inhibitory effect occurs in a more appropriate time span and seems to be a more important role for salivary lysoPC in R. prolixus. The actual concentration of lysoPC in the feeding site would amount to ∼15 μg/ml, which is close to the range capable of full inhibition of platelet aggregation in our assays. LysoPC has long been thought of as a pro-atherogenic molecule (17Parthasarathy S. Steinbrecher U.P. Barnett J. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3000-3004Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Only recently its anti-atherogenic profile has emerged, specifically by eliciting increased NO production by endothelial cells (32Li H. Wallerath T. Förstermann U. Nitric Oxide. 2002; 7: 132-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), increased thrombomodulin expression (36Yuan Y. Schoenwaelder S.M. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27090-27098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and reduced tissue-factor expression in human monocytes (37Engelmann B. Zieseniss S. Brand K. Page S. Lentschat A. Ulmer A.J. Gerlach E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, lysoPC would have a dual role in atherogenesis, with both pro- and anti-atherogenic effects. The finding of lysoPC in the saliva of R. prolixus further suggests an anti-hemostatic/anti-atherogenic character for this molecule, which would account for several controversies regarding the initial stages of atherosclerosis (38Libby P. J. Intern. Med. 2000; 247: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 12Chisolm G.M. Steinberg D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1815-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Finally, the data reported in the present work demonstrate the dual anti-hemostatic role of lysoPC (platelet-inhibitory and NO-inducer) in R. prolixus salivary secretions, including this lipid molecule as a novel anti-hemostatic compound found in the saliva of blood-sucking insects.

Migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a member of the thioredoxin family and has been classically defined as a cytokine. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and CD analysis, here we describe the binding to MIF of two peptides, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and insulin B (InsB) with high affinity for HLA class II allo-types, HLA-DP2 and HLA-DQ8, respectively.

MIF is widely expressed in different cell types but is produced mostly by activated macrophages and lymphocytes during inflammatory processes (7Lue H. Kleemann R. Calandra T. Roger T. Bernhagen J. Microbes Infect. 2002; 4: 449-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The full extent of its physiological role is not completely defined, although MIF has been implicated in several biological activities. First, MIF can function as a pro-inflammatory protein, as assessed by its inhibitory effect on dexamethasone-mediated TNF-α production (2Calandra T. Bucala R. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 17: 77-88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and its ability to sustain CD3-mediated T cell proliferation (8Bacher M. Metz C.N. Calandra T. Mayer K. Chesney J. Lohoff M. Gemsa D.

Spiegel L.A. Bacher M. Donnelly T. Cerami A. Bucala R. Nature. 1995; 377: 68-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). MIF also possesses enzymatic activities as a tautomerase/isomerase (10Rosengren E. Bucala R. Aman P. Jacobsson L. Odh G. Metz C.N. Rorsman H. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 143-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and thiol oxidoreductase (11Kleemann R. Kapurniotu A. Frank R.W. Gessner A. Mischke R. Flieger O. Juttner S. Brunner H. Bernhagen J. J. Mol.

However, the natural substrates for MIF catalytic activity are unknown even though its enzymatic activity has been characterized in detail using insulin and l-DOPA as models (11Kleemann R. Kapurniotu A. Frank R.W. Gessner A. Mischke R. Flieger O. Juttner S. Brunner H. Bernhagen J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 85-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 12Taylor A.B.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7444-7452Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).X-ray crystallographic analysis of both human and rat recombinant MIF molecules showed a homotrimeric structure (13Sun H.W.

Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, MIF is predominantly expressed as the monomer (44%) and dimer (33%), whereas only a smaller fraction (23%) is assembled to form a trimer (15Bendrat K. Al-Abed Y. Callaway D.J. Peng T. Calandra T. Metz C.N. Bucala R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15356-15362Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 16Mischke R. Kleemann R. Brunner H. Bernhagen J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Native MIF presumably possesses all three configurations of its recombinant forms. However, the relationship, if any, between configuration and biological activity is still to be defined.Antigen-presenting cells are able to internalize extracellular proteins within the acidic endosomal and lysosomal compartment to generate peptides for HLA class II loading. Antigen processing consists of protein denaturation and fragmentation. Several proteases have been described to be part of this system (17Villadangos J.A. Bryant R.A. Deussing J. Driessen C. Lennon-Dumenil A.M. Riese R.J. Roth W. Saftig P. Shi G.P. Chapman H.A. Peters C. Ploegh H.L. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 172: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Proteins that contain disulfide bonds require an additional processing step, the reduction of the cysteine residues to produce antigenic peptides (18Collins D.S. Unanue E.R. Harding C.V. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 4054-4059PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, modification of cysteine residues has been recently shown to regulate T cell responses to HLA class II-restricted epitopes (19Haque M.A. Hawes J.W. Blum J.S. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4543-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 20Haque M.A. Li P. Jackson S.K. Zarour H.M. Hawes J.W. Phan U.T. Maric M. Cresswell P. Blum J.S. J. Exp.

Within the endosomal pathway the γ-interferon-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase, the activity of which is restricted to acidic pH, has been found associated with antigen processing using reduction of cysteinylated peptides as the assay (22Maric M. Arunachalam B. Phan U.T. Dong C. Garrett W.S. Cannon K.S. Alfonso C. Karlsson L. Flavell R.A. Cresswell P. Science. 2001; 294: 1361-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar).Antigenic peptides can also be generated extracellularly by secretion of several proteases from professional antigen-presenting cells or stressed cells, such as virally infected and tumor cells (23Santambrogio L. Sato A.K. Carven G.J. Belyanskaya S.L. Strominger J.L. Stern L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15056-15061Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 24Monji T. Pious D. J.

Additionally exogenous antigens or already unfolded proteins can bind directly to surface HLA class II molecule for T cell presentation (26Accapezzato D. Nisini R. Paroli M. Bruno G. Bonino F. Houghton M. Barnaba V. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5262-5266PubMed Google Scholar, 27Vacchino J.F. McConnell H.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6680-6685Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).Here we describe the MIF peptide binding capacity and, more importantly, MIF thiol reductase activity at neutral pH on disulfide bonds in oxidized peptides. Because MIF is a secreted protein, particularly during inflammation, its thiol reductase activity could be associated with peptide modification in the extracellular milieu. Moreover, because MIF co-precipitated with HLA-DP2/15 molecules, a further role for MIF in HLA class II antigen presentation is suggested.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSynthetic Peptides—The following peptides were synthesized by Research Genetics (Waltham, MA): residues β 63–77 (KDILEEERAVPDRMA) of HLA-DP2 molecule; residues 306 –318 (PKYVKQNTLKLAT) of influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA); residues 14 –33 (VLQAGFFLLTRILTIPQSLD) of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg); residues 85–99 (ENPVVHFFKNIVTPR) of myelin basic protein and residues 9 –23 (SHLVEALYLVCGERG) from the insulin B chain (InsB).Cloning and Bacterial Expression of Human MIF—MIF was amplified from the cDNA of a human B cell line, NP-1, and cloned in an isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible expression vector (PGMT-7). PCR primers were designed as previously described with NdeI (5′-GCA TAT ACA TAT GCC GAT GTT CAT CGT A-3′) and BamHI (5′-TTG GAT CCT TAG GCG AAG GTG GAG TT-3′). MIF-PGMT-7 was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-(DE3) pLysS+ cells (Invitrogen). One liter of bacterial cell culture was grown at 37 °C until the optical density at 595 nm reached was 0.7–1 absorbance units, and then the cell culture was incubated with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for2hat30 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 5 ml/g BugBaster protein extraction Reagent (Novagen, Madison, WI) for 20–45 min in the presence of DNase and protease inhibitors. Cell debris were removed by centrifugation, and after filtration through 0.45-μm filters, the supernatant was applied to Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences) and an overnight dialysis at 4 °Cin20mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl. Because MIF is not retained by Mono Q resin, the flow-through was collected, and MIF was purified by gel filtration chromatography (Superdex 200, Pharmacia).ELISA and CD Spectrum Analysis—ELISA plates were coated overnight with 50 μm each peptide and then blocked for 1 h in 2% bovine serum albumin, phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature. Two micrograms of recombinant MIF (rMIF) were added and incubated overnight with the peptides. After washing, bound rMIF was detected in DuoSet ELISA (R&D, Minneapolis, MN). For CD spectrum analysis 25 μm rMIF was incubated overnight at room temperature with or without 2.5 μm each peptide. The incubation was performed in HSB (20 mm Hepes, 0.85% NaCl). The next day samples were diluted 10× in water, concentrated with MICRON10 (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and analyzed on a Jasco CD spectrometer. Secondary structure was analyzed on line by using the k2d program (www.emblheidelberg.de/~andrade/k2d).Thiol Reductase Activity of MIF—Insulin B, residues 9 –23, was oxidized as previously described. Briefly, peptide was incubated with 400 μm Cys-Hank's balanced salt solution for 3 h and then dialyzed for 48 h against 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0. 0.5 μg of oxidized peptide was incubated for 20 min with increasing amounts of rMIF, 100, 200, and 500 ng in 10 μl of 0.4 mm Cys-10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.0. Samples were purified by ZipTip (Millipore) and analyzed by mass spectrometry electrospray. Mass spectrometry electrospray analysis was carried out at the Chemistry Department at Harvard University.Immunoaffinity Columns—HLA-DRB1*0401 was purified from 10 g of B cell line pellet (PRIESS). HLA-DP2/15 was purified from 20 g of a heterozygous B cell line (NB-1) transformed and previously typed. Pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm NaCl, complete EDTA-free protease inhibitory mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science), and either 1% Nonidet P-40 or 0.5% CHAPS. After centrifugation protein extract was filtered through a 0.2-μm filter and put through a series of columns: POROS(r)20 AL-NMS, POROS(r)20 A, POROS(r)20 AL-LB3.1, POROS(r)20 AL-IVD12, and POROS(r)20 AL-B7/21 as previously described (35Malik P. Strominger J.L. J. Immunol. Methods. 2000; 234: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). After a protocol set up in this laboratory, immunoaffinity columns were washed with solution I (0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), solution II (0.5% CHAPS, 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.8), and solution III (0.1% CHAPS, 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). Elution was in 0.1% CHAPS, 50 mm glycine buffer, pH 11.5. Buffer exchange and protein concentration were performed on Centricon 10. Small scale protein purification was obtained using cell lysate from 5 g of B cell line. Native MIF was isolated using the monoclonal antibody anti-human MIF (R&D) conjugated to N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated resin (Amersham Biosciences). Second-step purification was performed using either B7/21 alone or a mix of HLA class II monoclonal antibodies, B7/21 and IVD12, conjugated to N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated column. PRIESS and NB-1 were both analyzed. Proteins were run on 12.5% SDS gels and analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining or Western blot. HLA class II isotypes were stained with a general anti-HLA class II rabbit serum, generously provided by Dr. N. Tanigaki. Human MIF was stained using polyclonal biotinylated antibody specific for human MIF (R&D).Analysis of the Inhibitory Effect of MIF on Dexamethasone Activity— MIF function was tested as previously described. Briefly, human monocytes were isolated from whole blood by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation and plated at 5 × 106 cells/ml in 24-well plates in RPMI, 10% human AB serum. The monocytes were purified by adherence and incubated for 1 h with dexamethasone (10–9m) plus 1–10 ng/ml of rMIF (R&D) or 1 ng of human MIF co-purified with HLA-DP2/15 from B7/21 column. LPS (Sigma) was added at the concentration of 0.5 μg/ml. Sixteen hours of conditioned medium was collected, and TNF-α secretion was quantified by ELISA (DuoSet R&D).Pulse-Chase and Immunoprecipitation—LB and Bg5 B cells lines were pulsed for 30 min with 1 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and then chased for 1 and 4 h in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with a 10-fold excess of cold methionine and cysteine. Cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 150 mm NaCl in 50 mm Tris containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and equivalent amounts of radioactive post-nuclear supernatant used for immunoprecipitation after preclearing with protein A- and G-Sepharose beads (Sigma). The immunoprecipitation was performed using a mouse anti-human MIF mAb (clone 12302.2) (R&D system). Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE boiled and non-boiled under non-reducing conditions.Peptide Affinity Column—A HiTrap N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated 1-ml column (Amersham Biosciences) was conjugated with 5 mg of solubilized peptide following the protocol provided by the company. Five grams of a transformed human B cell line were lysed in 25 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm NaCl, 0.5% CHAPS, and complete, EDTA-free, protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science). The affinity column was loaded overnight at 4 °C with cell lysate and then extensively washed in lysis buffer. Elution was completed with 100 mm glycine buffer, pH 3. Fractions corresponding to the elution peak were concentrated on Micron 10 (Millipore) and analyzed by Coomassie staining of 12.5% SDS-PAGE. The whole elution was trypsin-digested and sequenced by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectroscopy analysis. Tandem mass spectroscopy analysis was carried out at the Microchemistry Facility at Harvard University.RESULTSMIF Peptide Binding Analysis—Macrophage migration inhibitory factor functions as a tautomerase/isomerase and thiol reductase on small molecule substrates such as l-DOPA and insulin (11Kleemann R. Kapurniotu A. Frank R.W. Gessner A. Mischke R. Flieger O. Juttner S. Brunner H. Bernhagen J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 85-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 12Taylor A.B. Johnson Jr., W.H. Czerwinski R.M. Li H.S. Hackert M.L. Whitman C.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7444-7452Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Pro-1 and Cys-57–Cys-60 form the enzymatic catalytic sites. Thioreductase activity has an optimal pH ranging between 7.3 and 9 (11Kleemann R. Kapurniotu A. Frank R.W. Gessner A. Mischke R. Flieger O. Juttner S. Brunner H. Bernhagen J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 85-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). MIF is a soluble protein mostly secreted extracellularly. Because a number of different molecules with enzymatic properties have been found involved in extracellular protein fragmentation and processing (23Santambrogio L. Sato A.K. Carven G.J. Belyanskaya S.L. Strominger J.L. Stern L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15056-15061Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 24Monji T. Pious D. J.

Nature. 1988; 331: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) the possible interaction between MIF and immunologically relevant peptides was examined. Human rMIF was expressed and purified from E. coli BL21-(DE3) Lys+ cells as previously described (28Suzuki M. Murata E. Tanaka I. Nishihira J. Sakai M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1141-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Correct protein folding assessed by CD spectrum analysis (see Fig. 2) was identical to that previously published (29Mischke R. Gessner A. Kapurniotu A. Juttner S. Kleemann R. Brunner H. Bernhagen J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Several well known high affinity HLA class II peptides were selected and analyzed for their ability to interact with rMIF in an ELISA assay (Fig. 1) (30Chicz R.M. Urban R.G. Lane W.S. Gorga J.C. Stern L.J. Vignali D.A. Strominger J.L. Nature. 1992; 358: 764-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). The highest amount of rMIF was detected in plates coated with HBsAg14–33, a peptide derived from hepatitis B surface antigen, which showed a high binding affinity for HLA-DP2 (31Chicz R.M. Graziano D.F. Trucco M. Strominger J.L. Gorga J.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4935-4942PubMed Google Scholar). A fragment of insulin B (InsB9–23) known to bind HLA-DQ8 (32Lee K.H. Wucherpfennig K.W. Wiley D.C. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) also showed a significant binding capacity to rMIF, whereas little or no binding was observed for both myelin basic protein residues 85–99 and HA306–318, peptides, known for their high affinity binding to HLA-DR2 and HLA-DR1, respectively (33O'Sullivan D. Sidney J. Appella E. Walker L. Phillips L. Colon S.M. Miles C. Chesnut R.W. Sette A. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 1799-1808PubMed Google Scholar). Although ELISA is a well established method to determine HLA peptide binding, a better approach to examine protein-protein interaction is analyzing conformational changes by CD spectrum analysis. In agreement with what has been previously reported, the rMIF CD spectrum showed a positive ellipticity at 197 nm and broad negative ellipticity between 205 and 225 nm (Fig. 2) (29Mischke R. Gessner A. Kapurniotu A. Juttner S. Kleemann R. Brunner H. Bernhagen J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Under the conditions used, the secondary structure obtained with the K2d program was 37% α helix, 15% β sheet, and 48% random coil. Moreover, changes in the MIF CD spectrum were observed after an overnight incubation with HBsAg14–33 peptide (Fig. 2a). Secondary structure analysis by K2d revealed a consistent increase of β sheets and decrease of random coils, 41 and 31%, respectively. No modifications, either in CD spectrum or in secondary structure, were observed after an overnight incubation with HA306–318 or myelin basic protein residues 85–99 peptides (Fig. 2b). At the concentration used all of the peptides had only a very weak signal that coincided with the noise level (Fig. 2c). These observations suggest that rMIF has a flexible conformation, and major modifications of the secondary structure may occur upon complex formation with specific peptides.Fig. 1Analysis of peptide binding MIF. rMIF was added to ELISA plates previously coated with 50 μm HLA class II naturally processed peptides. The amount of bound protein was quantified using a biotinylated polyclonal antibody specific for human MIF followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated-Streptavidin. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm. The data shown represent a typical experiment where each sample is assayed in triplicate. The experiment was repeated three times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)MIF Thiol Reductase Activity—MIF enzymatic activity includes a thiol reductase function (11Kleemann R. Kapurniotu A. Frank R.W. Gessner A. Mischke R. Flieger O. Juttner S. Brunner H. Bernhagen J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 85-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutation analysis pointed to Cys-57 and Cys-60 as part of the MIF enzymatic catalytic site, determined in vitro using molecular models (11Kleemann R. Kapurniotu A. Frank R.W. Gessner A. Mischke R. Flieger O. Juttner S. Brunner H. Bernhagen J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 85-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Further analysis was conducted here to investigate whether the MIF thiol reductase activity could function on oxidized peptides. Among the synthetic peptides tested for their binding to rMIF (Fig. 1), InsB9–23, molecular mass 1645.8, possesses a cysteine residue in position 11. Cysteinylation of this residue in Cys-Hank's balanced salt solution changed the molecular mass to 1765, as shown by mass spectrometry electrospray analysis (Fig. 3, a–b). Peaks at 823 and at 883 are double-charged and correspond to m/z of reduced and oxidized peptide, respectively. After 20 min of incubation with rMIF at pH 7.2 a significant amount of InsB9–23 was reduced (Fig. 3c). The ratio peptide reduced/oxidized was dose-dependent as shown in Fig. 3d. Thus, rMIF can function directly to reduce cysteinylated forms of InsB 9–23. As expected, no modifications in the molecular mass of the cysteinylated peptide occurred without adding rMIF (Fig. 3b). Thus, peptides can be substrates of MIF thiol reductase, and as expected, this reaction occurs at neutral pHFig. 3MIF thiol reductase activity.

This technique was applied to purify HLA-DR (HLA-DRB1*0401) using mAb LB3.1 and HLA DP (HLA-DPB1*0201/*1501) using mAb B7/21 affinity columns. The isolated HLA molecules were analyzed on Western blot using a general HLA class II rabbit antiserum as the detection antibody (Fig. 4a, left). Interestingly, MIF was found associated with HLA-DP2/15 mainly as the dimer, as detected by Western blot analysis, but not with the HLA-DR4 preparation (Fig. 4a, right).Fig. 4Analysis of human MIF interaction with HLA class II molecules. a, Western blot analysis of immunoaffinity-purified HLADR4 and HLA-DP2/15 molecules and Western blot analysis of MIF co-precipitated with HLA class II molecules.

Bernhagen J. Metz C.N. Spiegel L.A. Bacher M. Donnelly T. Cerami A. Bucala R. Nature. 1995; 377: 68-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). This assay was, therefore, used to assess the biological activity of MIF found in association with HLA-DP2/15. First, sandwich ELISA was performed to detect the MIF concentration in the HLA-DP preparation (Fig. 4b). The HLA-DR preparation was also analyzed, and as expected, no MIF was found associated. As shown in Fig. 4c, MIF that had been co-purified with HLA-DP2/15 as well as purified recombinant MIF partially antagonized the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on TNF-α secretion to an extent similar to that previously reported (9Calandra T. Bernhagen J. Metz C.N. Spiegel L.A. Bacher M. Donnelly T. Cerami A. Bucala R. Nature. 1995; 377: 68-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar).Pulse-chase experiments were performed to investigate whether MIF could be found associated with HLA DP2/15 at any step of class II trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface. HLA class II heterodimers were chased up to 18 h; however, MIF could not be identified after precipitation of HLA-DP (data not shown). This result was not surprising since, besides the invariant chain, which associates with all nascent class II α/β heterodimers, all other proteins known to pair with HLA class II molecules (e.g. HLA-DM, HLA-DO (36Brocke P. Garbi N. Momburg F. Hammerling G.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 22-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), tetraspanin (37Engering A. Pieters J. Int.

HLA-DP-associated MIF was detected by first immunopurifying with the mAb specific for human MIF (Fig. 5a) followed by a second immunopurification step using mAb B7–21 specific for HLA-DP molecules (Fig. 5b). Interestingly, MIF is associated with peptide-loaded forms of HLA-DP, as indicated by the presence of an SDS stable class II α/β complex. In these experimental conditions, MIF dimers and monomers were purified using both anti-DP and anti-MIF column (Figs. 4a, 5a, and 6c) and the dimeric form of MIF became monomeric under reducing conditions (Fig. 5a). In pulse-chase experiments on two different B cell lines (LB, Bg5),"
https://openalex.org/W2061850853,"We have recently reported that the reverse transcriptase (RT) of SIVMNE 170 (170), which is a representative viral clone of the late symptomatic phase of infection with the parental strain, SIVMNE CL8 (CL8), has a largely increased fidelity, compared with the CL8 RT. In the present study, we analyzed the mechanistic alterations of the high fidelity 170 RT variant. First, we found that among several 170 RT mutations, only one, V148I, is solely responsible for the fidelity increase over the CL8 RT. This V148I mutation lies near the Gln-151 residue that we recently found is important to the low fidelity of RT and the binding of incoming dNTPs. Second, we compared dNTP binding affinity (K d) and catalysis (k pol) of the CL8 RT and the CL8-V148I RT using pre-steady state kinetic analysis. In this experiment, the high fidelity CL8-V148I RT has largely decreased binding to both correct and incorrect dNTP without altering k pol. The fidelity increase imparted by the V148I mutation is likely because of the major reduction seen in RT binding to dNTPs. This parallels our findings with the Q151N mutant. Third, site-directed mutagenesis targeting amino acid residue 148 has revealed that a valine amino acid at this position is essential to RT infidelity. Based on these findings, we discuss possible structural impacts of residue 148 (and mutations at this site) on the interaction of RT with incoming dNTPs and infer how alterations in these properties may relate to viral replication and fitness.

One of the most unique enzymatic properties of lentiviral DNA polymerases (i.e. human and simian immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1 1The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1; SIV, simian immunodeficiency virus; RT, reverse transcriptase; T/P, template-primer complex; AZTTP, 3′-Azido-3′-deoxythymidine 5′-triphosphate; DTT, dithiothreitol.1The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1; SIV, simian immunodeficiency virus; RT, reverse transcriptase; T/P, template-primer complex; AZTTP, 3′-Azido-3′-deoxythymidine 5′-triphosphate; DTT, dithiothreitol. and SIV) reverse transcriptases (RT)) is their highly error-prone mode of DNA synthesis (1Preston B.D.

The anti-viral immune selection drives the viral diversity that may result from the fast replication of lentiviruses (3Coffin J.M.

Immunol. 1992; 176: 165-180PubMed Google Scholar). As recently reported, it is increasingly apparent that infidelity of lentiviral RTs provides the raw material for the viral genomic hypermutation that allows lentiviruses to efficiently evolve and escape from various anti-viral selective pressures (6O'Neil P.K. Sun G. Yu H. Ron Y. Dougherty J.P. Preston B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38053-38061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Unlike DNA polymerases involved in the cellular genomic replication process, lentiviral RTs lack the 3′ to 5′ proofreading nuclease activity, which would normally help prevent mutagenic DNA synthesis. However, this is not the only factor contributing to the low fidelity of lentiviral RTs because RTs of onco-retroviruses lacking the proofreading exonuclease activity, such as murine leukemia virus and avian myeloblastosis virus, have 10–18-fold higher fidelity than lentiviral RTs (7Roberts J.D. Preston B.D. Johnston L.A. Soni A. Loeb L.A. Kunkel T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). This suggests that lentiviral RTs harbor DNA polymerase active sites with unique molecular characteristics responsible for their unfaithful DNA synthesis.Kinetic studies with DNA polymerases suggest that mutation synthesis, which generates a mismatch at the 3′ end of newly synthesized DNA, interrupts processive DNA polymerization (8Johnson K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 685-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). HIV-1 RT is highly efficient in the incorporation of incorrect dNTPs (misinsertion). In addition, compared with other known DNA polymerases involved in genomic replication, HIV-1 RT more efficiently extends the mismatched primer created by a misinsertion (9Yu H. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10888-10896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Possibly, the high capability of HIV-1 RT to extend a mismatched primer may compensate for the disruption of processive DNA synthesis caused by frequent misinsertion events during viral genomic replication by HIV-1 RT.The interaction of DNA polymerases with incoming dNTPs is one of the key elements that determines DNA polymerase fidelity. Mutations in the dNTP binding domain, O helix, of pol I DNA polymerase family members, such as the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase (10Kuchta R.D. Mizrahi V. Benkovic P.A.

Mutations in several dNTP-binding residues of HIV-1 RT were also found to affect RT fidelity. For example, alterations in the Arg-72 residue of HIV-1 RT, which interacts with the triphosphate moiety of incoming dNTPs, increase RT fidelity; however, these alterations can dramatically decrease RT activity (16Lewis D.A. Bebenek K. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32924-32930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In contrast, mutations in the Tyr-115 residue that interacts with base-sugar moieties of the incoming dNTP reduce RT fidelity (17Martin-Hernandez A.M. Gutierrez-Rivas M. Domingo E. Menendez-Arias L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1383-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 18Cases-Gonzalez C.E. Gutierrez-Rivas M. Menendez-Arias L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19759-19767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).Kinetic parameters indicating the dNTP binding affinity and chemical catalysis of DNA polymerases have been determined under reaction conditions where DNA polymerase molecules prebound to the template-primer complex (T/P), incorporate a single nucleotide; this is referred to as the pre-steady state condition (8Johnson K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 685-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). We recently reported a pre-steady state kinetic study with another high fidelity HIV-1 RT mutant, Q151N. The Gln-151 residue, encoded in the β8–αE loop of RT, directly interacts with the 3′ OH of the incoming dNTP. Molecular modeling suggested that the Q151N mutation disconnects the interaction of the RT with the 3′ OH of the incoming dNTP. Our pre-steady state kinetic study demonstrated that the Q151N mutant specifically slows down the binding step (K d) for all incoming dNTPs (correct and incorrect) but not the chemistry step (k pol). In fact, the binding of the Q151N mutant to incorrect dNTP was reduced to such an extent that we were not able to determine an accurate K d value (19Weiss K.K. Bambara R.A. Kim B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22662-22669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Therefore, this kinetic study suggests that the Gln-151 RT residue interacts with the 3′ OHs of both correct and incorrect incoming dNTPs, thereby providing support for the existence of a common mechanism involved in the binding of both correct and incorrect dNTPs.Met-184 RT mutations of HIV-1 RT, M184V and M184I, are the only in vivo lentiviral RT mutations previously found to have moderately increased fidelity. These mutations were initially isolated from virus strains that exhibited resistance to a nucleoside RT inhibitor, 3TC. HIV-1 RTs containing the M184V and M184I mutations showed 1.8- and 3.5-fold increased fidelities, respectively, compared with wild type HIV-1 RT, as determined by the M13 lacZα forward mutation assay (20Rezende L.F. Drosopoulos W.C. Prasad V.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3066-3072Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A pre-steady state kinetic study with M184V RT showed reduced binding affinity to both correct and incorrect dNTPs (21Feng J.Y. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9440-9448Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Structural studies have proposed that the β-branched side chain of the valine (or isoleucine) at position 184 in HIV-1 RT blocks the entry of incoming dNTP, including 3TCTP and incorrect dNTP, into the active site (22Sarafianos S.G. Das K. Clark Jr., A.D. Ding J. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10027-10032Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar).We found recently that an in vivo SIV RT variant, called SIVMNE 170 (170) RT, has an enhanced replication fidelity. SIVMNE 170 virus is a molecular clone isolated at the late stage of infection of a pig-tailed macaque (M87004) initially infected with a molecular clone of SIVMNE CL8 (CL8) (23Overbaugh J. Rudensey L.M. Papenhausen M.D. Benveniste R.E. Morton W.R. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 7025-7031Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Rudensey L.M. Kimata J.T. Benveniste R.E. Overbaugh J. Virology. 1995; 207: 528-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The 170 RT has ∼11-fold higher fidelity than the initial low fidelity CL8 RT. Sequence analysis revealed that the 170 high fidelity RT has six mutations in the DNA polymerase domain of RT, compared with the low fidelity CL8 RT. Identification of the 170 high fidelity variant suggests that RT fidelity may change during the course of viral infection. Indeed, the 170 RT is the first in vivo RT variant isolated during the course of natural infection (no antiretroviral drug treatment) with such an increase in fidelity (25Diamond T.L. Kimata J. Kim B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23624-23631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).In the present study, we investigated kinetic and structural properties of the high fidelity 170 RT protein. First, we identified a 170 RT mutation solely responsible for the fidelity increase of the 170 RT. Second, we determined the reaction step affected by the 170 high fidelity mutation by employing the pre-steady state kinetic assay. Third, we examined the effect of other types of mutations at the 148 residue of CL8 RT on RT fidelity. Finally, based on these kinetic and mechanistic analyses, we proposed a model for the structural impact made by the in vivo high fidelity 170 RT mutation.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmids, Strains, and Chemicals—E. coli DH5α (Invitrogen) was used for construction of plasmids and BL21 (Novagen, WI) for overexpression of SIVMNE RT proteins. SIVMNE CL8 and 170 RT proteins were previously purified from pBK90 and 125 (25Diamond T.L. Kimata J. Kim B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23624-23631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), respectively, which are pHis/NdeI plasmids (26Kim B. Methods (Orlando). 1997; 12: 318-324Google Scholar) encoding full-length RT genes, fused at the N terminus to six histidine residues. pBK33 (26Kim B. Methods (Orlando). 1997; 12: 318-324Google Scholar) was used for the bacterial expression of HIV-1 RT proteins. SIVMNE and HIV-1 RTs (p66/p66 homodimers) were purified from the pHis/NdeI plasmids cloned as noted below. All restriction endonucleases were obtained from New England Biolabs.Construction of SIVMNE CL8-V148I, 170-I148V RT Derivatives, and the V148I HIV-1 RT Mutant—In order to make a pHis/NdeI CL8-V148I RT clone, pBK90 expressing SIVMNE CL8 RT clone was amplified with 170V148I R primer (5′-TCCACCCCTGAGGCAGAATCTTATAAATGTATCG-3′) and 5′ HSG primer (5′-TATGTTGTGTGGAATTGT-3′) using Taq polymerase (New England Biolabs). The Bsu36I site is shown in boldface and the complement to the Ile-148 codon is underlined. NdeI and Bsu36I were used to insert the V148I fragment into the SIVMNE CL8 RT plasmid. Clones were sequenced using 5′ HSG (see above) and the ABI system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The pHis/NdeI 170-I148V RT clone was made similarly using CL8V148I R primer (5′-TCCACCCCTGAGGCAGAACCTTATAAATGTATCG-3′) and 5′ HSG (see above) to amplify from pBK125 expressing SIVMNE 170 RT and inserting the mutated fragment into pBK125 at the NdeI and Bsu36I sites. The Bsu36I site is shown in boldface, and the complement to the Val148 codon is underlined in the CL8V148I R primer. Clones were sequenced using the fmol DNA cycle sequencing system (Promega, WI) and SIV 111/112F primer (5′-TTTTTTCTTAAGGACGCATATTTCTCCATACC-3′) in order to identify the V148I mutation and with SIVseq280 primer (5′-AATACCACACCCTGCAGGAC-3′) in order to verify that the backbone is SIVMNE 170.For the construction of the HIV-1 RT V148I mutant, the V148I mutation was also created by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using a primer containing the V148I mutation (5′-TTTTAGATATCAGTACAATATCCTTCCACAGGGATGGAAAGG-3′; the V148I codon is shown in boldface, and the EcoRV restriction site is underlined) and the BamHI primer (5′-AAAGGATCCCCAGCAATATTCCAAAG-3′; the BamHI site is underlined). The wild type sequence of pBK33 (26Kim B. Methods (Orlando). 1997; 12: 318-324Google Scholar) between the unique EcoRV (near codon 144) and BamHI (near codon 155) sites was replaced with the EcoRV- and BamHI-digested PCR product made with these two primers.Random Site-directed Mutagenesis of Val-148 Residue—In order to generate CL8 RT with a variety of amino acids present at residue 148, pBK90 expressing SIVMNE CL8 RT clone was amplified with CL8 V148X R primer (5′-TCCACCCCTGAGGCAGSXXCTTATAAATGTATCG-3′; S refers to C or G, and X refers to G, A, T, or C) and 5′ HSG primer (5′-TATGTTGTGTGGAATTGT-3′) using Taq polymerase (New England Biolabs). The Bsu36I site is shown in boldface, and the complement to the random 148 codon is underlined. NdeI and Bsu36I were used to insert the V148X fragment into the SIVMNE CL8 RT plasmid. Clones were sequenced using the fmol DNA cycle sequencing system (Promega, WI) and SIV 111/112F primer (5′-TTTTTTCTTAAGGACGCATATTTCTCCATACC-3′) in order to identify the codon present at position 148 and verify the presence of the CL8 codon at position 173.Purification of SIVMNE and HIV-1 RT Proteins—Homodimeric (p66/p66) RT proteins were purified using a modification of our purification protocol for HIV-1 RT as described previously (26Kim B. Methods (Orlando). 1997; 12: 318-324Google Scholar). Expression of SIVMNE and HIV-1 RTs was induced by addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to log phase E. coli BL21 with the RT expression plasmids described above, grown in 2× YT to an A 600 of 0.5. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation, and the pellets were resuspended and frozen (–70 °C) with 10 ml of 1× binding buffer and lysozyme (200 μg/ml). All buffers and binding resin used in this work were purchased from Novagen (WI). Frozen cells were thawed and lysed on ice for ∼2 h. The lysed cells were centrifuged (27,000 × g), and after addition of 10 ml of fresh 1× binding buffer the supernatant was applied to a charged 5-ml His Bind column (1 × 5 cm). The resin was prepared by successive washes with deionized water (15 ml), 1× charge buffer (15 ml), and 1× binding buffer (15 ml). All chromatographic steps were carried out at 4 °C at a flow rate of 20 ml/h. Following application of the crude supernatant solution, the column was washed with 1× binding buffer (15 ml) and a mixture of 1× binding buffer and 1× wash buffer (7:3, 10 ml). RT proteins were eluted with 1× elute buffer (20 ml); 90% of the recovered RT protein was released from the resin in the first 8 ml. Fractions containing purified RT proteins were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide stacking gel. Fractions containing RT were dialyzed against 1× dialysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) for 16 h and 1× dialysis buffer with 1 mm DTT for 3 h. In this protocol the purity of the RT proteins was typically greater than 95%, as estimated by visual inspection of Coomassie Blue-stained gels.M13mp2 lacZα Forward Mutation Assay—The mutant frequencies for our SIVMNE RT proteins were measured essentially as described previously (27Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). M13mp2 DNA containing a 361-nucleotide single-stranded gap was prepared as specified. Gapped M13mp2 DNA (1 μg) was incubated with RT (250 nm) at 37 °C for 20 min under the conditions described above for the misincorporation assays. The extended gapped DNAs were analyzed by 0.7% agarose gel for verifying the production of double-stranded M13 DNA with filled gaps. The extended gapped DNAs were transformed to MC1016 cells, and the transformed cells were plated to M9 plates containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside with CSH50 lawn cells. The mutant frequency was determined as the ratio of mutant (pale blue and clear) plaques to mutant plus wild type (dark blue) plaques as described.Misincorporation Assay with DNA or RNA Templates—Procedures were modified from those of Preston et al. (1Preston B.D. Poiesz B.J. Loeb L.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1168-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). The RNA T/P was prepared by annealing a 40-mer RNA (5′-AAGCUUGGCUGCAGAAUAUUGCUAGCGGGAAUUCGGCGCG-3′, Dharmacon Research) to the 17-mer A primer (5′-CGCGCCGAATTCCCGCT-3′; template-primer, 2.5:1, Invitrogen) 32P-labeled at the 5′ end by T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). The DNA T/P was prepared by annealing a 40-mer DNA (5′-AAGCTTGGCTGCAGAATATTGCTAGCGGGAATTCGGCGCG-3′), which encodes the same sequence as the 40-mer RNA template, to the 17-mer used for DNA template-primer preparation. Assay mixtures (20 μl) contained 10 nm T/P, RT proteins as specified in figure legends, or exo– T7 DNA polymerase (Sequenase version 2.0 DNA polymerase, U. S. Biochemical Corp.), 3 or 4 dNTPs (250 μm each), 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 μm (dT)20, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (New England Biolabs). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min and terminated by 10 μlof40mm EDTA, 99% formamide. Reaction products were immediately denatured by incubating at 95 °C for 5 min and analyzed by electrophoresis in 14% polyacrylamide-urea gels.Extension of Mismatched Primers—To measure the capability of RT to extend mismatched primer, we used two different mismatched primers annealed to either the RNA or DNA template used in misincorporation assay. 32P-Labeled 16-mer G/T mismatched primer (5′-CGCGCCGAATTCCCGT-3′, mismatch underlined) or 19-mer C/A primer (5′-CGCGCCGAATTCCCGCTAA-3′, mismatch underlined) was annealed to the 40-mer RNA or DNA templates (see above), respectively. For control matched primer, we used 32P-labeled C primer (5′-CGCGCCGAATTCCCG-3′) annealed to the 40-mer RNA or DNA templates (see above). Extension conditions for this extension assay were the same as those used for the misincorporation assay above, except for the different T/Ps. The reactions were also analyzed by electrophoresis on a 14% denaturing sequencing gel.Pre-steady State Kinetic Assay—Pre-steady state burst and single-turnover experiments were employed to examine the transient kinetics associated with a single nucleotide incorporating onto the 3′ end of a 32P-labeled 17-mer A primer (see above) annealed to a 40-mer RNA template (see above). We used 20 μl of T/P pre-incubated with purified SIV RT protein and reaction buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 40 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). This mixture was injected into one sample tube of the rapid quench machine (Kintek). An equal volume of dNTP pre-incubated with Mg2+ (10 mm) was injected into the other sample tube. The polymerization reaction was initiated by rapidly mixing the two reactants and was terminated by adding 0.25 m EDTA at different time points.In the pre-steady state burst experiments, T/P (150 nm) was present in excess over active RT (∼50 or 150 nm purified protein), and the reaction was initiated by addition of 800 μm dATP (correct). These experiments were used to determine the active site concentrations of the RT proteins (see data analysis Refs. 8Johnson K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 685-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar and 28Johnson K.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 249: 38-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The pre-steady state single-turnover experiments were used to determine the dNTP concentration dependence of the purified SIV RT proteins. In the presence of varying dATP concentrations (in the range of 600 nm to2mm), active RT (100 nm) was used in slight excess of T/P (90 nm). In reactions involving incorrect dNTPs, the experiments were performed manually at longer time points and used a higher concentration of RT (700 nm) (10Kuchta R.D. Mizrahi V. Benkovic P.A.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 249: 38-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar).Product Analysis—The reactions were analyzed by 14% denaturing sequencing gel electrophoresis. The extended product in each reaction was quantified by the Cyclone PhosphorImager (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Data Analysis—Pre-steady state kinetic data was analyzed using nonlinear regression. Equations were generated with the program Kaleidagraph version 3.51 (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Data points obtained during the burst experiment were fit to the burst Equation 1, [product]=A(1-exp(-kobst)+ksst)(Eq. 1) The value A is the amplitude of the burst, which reflects the actual concentration of enzyme that is in active form. k obs is the observed first-order rate constant for dNTP incorporation, whereas k ss is the observed steady state rate constant (8Johnson K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 685-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 10Kuchta R.D. Mizrahi V. Benkovic P.A. Johnson K.A. Benkovic S.J. Kuchta M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8410-8417Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 28Johnson K.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 249: 38-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Data from single turnover experiments were fit to a single exponential equation that measures the rate of dNTP incorporation (k obs) per given dNTP concentration ([dNTP]). These results can then be used to determine K d, the dissociation constant for dNTP binding to the RT-T/P binary complex. This was done by fitting the data to the following hyperbolic Equation 2, kobs=kpol[dNTP]/(Kd+[dNTP])(Eq. 2) From this equation, we could then identify the following kinetic constants for each RT during pre-steady state kinetics: k pol, the maximum rate of dNTP incorporation, and K d, equilibrium dissociation constant for the interaction of dNTP with the E·DNA complex (8Johnson K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 685-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar).[dNTP] Dependence Assay for Primer Extension Capability—To measure the ability of RT to perform multiple rounds of DNA synthesis in the presence of low concentrations of dNTP, the RNA T/P (A primer/RNA; see above) was extended by identical activities of either CL8 or CL8-V148I RT with dNTP concentrations ranging from 25 nm to 100 μm. Other than dNTP concentrations, reactions were performed using the same conditions as described for the misincorporation assay above. Reactions were applied to a 14% polyacrylamide-urea gel for analysis.AZTTP Susceptibility Assay—The drug susceptibility assay performed was a modification of the drug susceptibility assay as described by Klarmann et al. (29Klarmann G.J. Smith R.A. Schinazi R.F. North T.W. Preston B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 359-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, the RNA T/P was prepared by annealing the 40-mer RNA template (see above) to the 17-mer primer A (see above) 32P-labeled at the 5′ end by T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). Assay mixtures (20 μl) contained 10 nm T/P, SIV RT proteins as specified in the figure legends, 4 dNTPs (see figure legend for concentrations), 0–200 μm AZTTP (see figure legend for specific concentrations), 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2,2 μm (dT)20, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (New England Biolabs). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and terminated by addition of 10 μlof40mm EDTA, 99% formamide. Reaction products were immediately denatured by incubating at 95 °C for 5 min and analyzed by electrophoresis in 14% polyacrylamide-urea gels.RESULTSIdentification of the 170 RT Mutation Responsible for the Fidelity Increase—Our previous study (25Diamond T.L. Kimata J. Kim B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23624-23631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) showed that the high fidelity 170 RT has six mutations at the DNA polymerase domain, compared with the sequence of the CL8 RT. We tested which of the six SIVMNE 170 RT mutations is (are) responsible for the fidelity increase of the SIVMNE 170 RT. Among the six SIVMNE 170 RT mutations, an SIVMNE CL8 RT derivative containing V148I (CL8-V148I) was initially constructed because this Val-148 residue lies near the active site of RT. After purification of the CL8-V148I RT protein, we measured the fidelity of the CL8 and CL8-V148I RTs by the M13 lacZα forward mutation assay. As shown in Table I, the CL8-V148I RT has about 8 times higher fidelity, compared with the SIVMNE CL8 RT, indicating that the V148I mutation increases the fidelity of SIVMNE CL8 RT. In addition, the CL8-V148I RT has similar high fidelity to the 170 RT containing all six mutations (Table I). These data suggest that the V148I mutation contributes to the fidelity increase observed in the 170 RT. In addition, the other five SIVMNE 170 RT mutations (I73M, K173R, S211G, Y303F, and N332S) are unlikely to be involved in the fidelity increase. The CL8 K173R mutant RT, for example, had identical fidelity to CL8 RT by misincorporation assay (data not shown).Table IFidelity of SIVMNE RT proteins determined by M13 lacZα forward mutation assaySIVMNE RT proteinsTotal plaquesaNumbers represent pooled totals from at least two independent fill-in reactions.Mutant plaquesaNumbers represent pooled totals from at least two independent fill-in reactions.Mutant frequencyaNumbers represent pooled totals from at least two independent fill-in reactions.

Open table in a new tab Next, we confirmed the effect of the V148I mutation on RT fidelity by testing whether reversion of the V148I mutation in the high fidelity SIVMNE 170 RT reduces its fidelity. We constructed and purified an SIVMNE 170 RT derivative containing five of the six SIVMNE 170 RT mutations except for the V148I mutation, called 170-I148V RT. As shown in Table I, the 170-I148V RT showed an ∼10-fold reduced fidelity, compared with the high fidelity 170 RT. In addition, similar low mutation frequencies were seen between the 170-I148V and CL8 RTs (Table I). Therefore, these results suggest that the V148I mutation is resp"
