However, responses triggered by programmable nucleases in HSPCs are poorly characterized and may negatively impact HSPC engraftment and long-term repopulation capacity. Here, we induced either one or several DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) with optimized zinc-finger and CRISPR/Cas9 nucleases and monitored DNA damage response (DDR) foci induction, cell-cycle progression, and transcriptional responses in HSPC subpopulations, with up to single-cell resolution. p53-mediated DDR pathway activation was the predominant response to even single-nuclease-induced DSBs across all HSPC subtypes analyzed. Excess DSB load and/or adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated delivery of DNA repair templates induced cumulative p53 pathway activation, constraining proliferation, yield, and engraftment of edited HSPCs. However, functional impairment was reversible when DDR burden was low and could be overcome by transient p53 inhibition.

These findings provide molecular and functional evidence for feasible and seamless gene editing in HSPCs. Targeted gene editing exploits programmable nucleases, such as zinc finger (ZFN) and RNA-based CRISPR/Cas9 nucleases, to induce a double-stranded break (DSB) into a pre-determined genomic sequence (Doudna and Charpentier, 2014Doudna J.A.

A guide to genome engineering with programmable nucleases.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2014; 15: 321-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). Depending on the DSB repair pathway engaged, the outcome may be inactivation of the targeted locus by insertions or deletions (“indels”) introduced by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) or insertion of a new sequence by homology-directed repair (HDR) from an exogenous DNA template. Prospective clinical application of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) gene editing includes acquired and primary immunodeficiencies, thalassemia, and sickle cell disease (Cornu et al., 2017Cornu T.I.

Porteus M.H. The changing landscape of gene editing in hematopoietic stem cells: a step towards Cas9 clinical translation.Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2017; 24: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Despite the advances in perfecting gene-editing platforms (Tsai and Joung, 2016Tsai S.Q. Joung J.K. Defining and improving the genome-wide specificities of CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2016; 17: 300-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), the functional consequences of the editing process in HSPCs have yet to be elucidated. A major challenge comes from the need to focus such studies on primitive hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), a small fraction of the cells harvested by CD34 immunoselection. Whereas HSCs are responsible for long-term hematopoietic repopulation in the recipient, their committed counterparts only support transient clonal output (Doulatov et al., 2012Doulatov S. Notta F. Laurenti E. Dick J.E. Hematopoiesis: a human perspective.Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 10: 120-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Nuclease-dependent gene editing generates DSBs, potentially toxic lesions that trigger DDR. HSPC function declines in response to multiple DSBs induced by irradiation and other genotoxic agents (Milyavsky et al., 2010Milyavsky M. Gan O.I. Trottier M. Komosa M. Tabach O. Notta F. Lechman E. Hermans K.G. Eppert K.

Whereas programmable nucleases are designed to recognize a single genomic target, the induction of additional DSBs at unintended off-target loci may increase the overall DDR burden and trigger apoptosis, differentiation, or replicative arrest, exacerbating the risk of exhaustion and limiting the long-term engraftment capacity of HSPCs. HDR-mediated gene editing is constrained in the most primitive HSPC subsets (De Ravin et al., 2016De Ravin S.S. Reik A. Liu P.Q. Li L. Wu X. Su L. Raley C. Theobald N. Choi U.

Biotechnol. 2015; 33: 1256-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), likely due to low expression of the HDR machinery, quiescence, limited uptake, and innate response to the exogenous DNA template. Thus, it is crucial to enhance the efficiency of HDR in HSCs while preserving long-term repopulating capacity for clinical applications in which a low yield of edited cells would not be therapeutically effective. Similarly, the impact of adeno-associated viral vector serotype 6 (AAV6) as preferred source of DNA template for HDR in HSPCs remains poorly investigated. Here, we interrogated up to the single-cell level the molecular processes underlying the response of different HSPC subsets to gene editing and devised a strategy to counteract potential adverse effects on HSPC function. To study the effects of nuclease-induced DNA DSBs in human cord blood (CB)-derived CD34+ HSPCs, we used a previously optimized protocol (Schiroli et al., 2017Schiroli G. Ferrari S. Conway A. Jacob A. Capo V. Albano L. Plati T. Castiello M.C. Sanvito F. Gennery A.R. et al.Preclinical modeling highlights the therapeutic potential of hematopoietic stem cell gene editing for correction of SCID-X1.Sci. Transl. Med. 2017; 9: eaan0820Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and utilized obligate heterodimeric ZFN or CRISPR/Cas9, delivered as purified and base-modified mRNAs or ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNP) of Cas9 with synthetic, base-modified guide RNA (gRNA) (Hendel et al., 2015Hendel A. Bak R.O. Clark J.T. Kennedy A.B. Ryan D.E. Roy S. Steinfeld I. Lunstad B.D. Kaiser R.J. Wilkens A.B. et al.Chemically modified guide RNAs enhance CRISPR-Cas genome editing in human primary cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar), respectively (Figure 1A). We employed as controls equimolar amounts of a single ZFN monomer (−DSB) or Cas9 unloaded (Cas9 only) or loaded with a gRNA with no predicted activity against the human genome (−DSB). The panel of nucleases was designed to target the same intronic region of IL2RG, a clinically relevant locus not essential for HSPC survival, and validated for robust activity at the on-target site (Table S1). The IL2RG 6-finger ZFN nuclease pair was optimized to reduce off-target activity to nearly undetectable levels in human cells (Schiroli et al., 2017Schiroli G. Ferrari S. Conway A. Jacob A. Capo V. Albano L. Plati T. Castiello M.C. Sanvito F. Gennery A.R. et al.Preclinical modeling highlights the therapeutic potential of hematopoietic stem cell gene editing for correction of SCID-X1.Sci. Transl. Med. 2017; 9: eaan0820Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), whereas gRNAs were designed with stringent or relaxed specificity (hereafter named high specificity [HS] or low specificity [LS], respectively) and tested by GUIDE-seq (Data S1A). Nuclease activity at the top gRNA off-target sites, none of which was located in transcribed regions, was investigated in HSPCs by heteroduplex cleavage assay. Whereas HS RNP showed significant activity at only one off-target site, which was cleaved with lower efficiency than IL2RG, two of the top 5 off-target sites tested for LS RNP were cleaved with similar efficiency as IL2RG (Table S2). Target DNA cleavage and repair, quantified by DSB-droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) (Rose et al., 2017Rose J.C. Stephany J.J. Valente W.J. Trevillian B.M. Dang H.V. Bielas J.H. Maly D.J. Fowler D.M. Rapidly inducible Cas9 and DSB-ddPCR to probe editing kinetics.Nat. Methods. 2017; 14: 891-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and indels detection, respectively, occurred mostly within 24 h from nuclease delivery for both nuclease platforms. Intriguingly, the rate of DSB disappearance appeared faster for the ZFN than RNP, despite the former being delivered by mRNA and the latter by protein (Figure 1B). DDR factors, recruited at site of DSBs, can be identified as microscopically visible subnuclear foci (Polo and Jackson, 2011Polo S.E. Jackson S.P. Dynamics of DNA damage response proteins at DNA breaks: a focus on protein modifications.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 409-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). We detected accumulation of the DDR sensor 53BP1 within 24 h post-electroporation with the majority of DDR-positive cells displaying one or two foci per nucleus, when highly specific nucleases were employed, compared to negative controls (Figure 1C). The percentage of foci-bearing cells decreased over time, consistently with the resolution of the DSBs. The number of 53BP1 foci per cell was significantly increased when using LS RNP, reflecting higher DDR burden (Figures 1C and 1D). LS-RNP-treated HSPCs still retained DNA DSB repair proficiency over time, as 53BP1 foci progressively disappeared with only slightly delayed kinetics over that of HS-RNP-treated cells (Figure 1D). To investigate the specific targeting of 53BP1 foci to IL2RG alleles, we performed immuno-DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (Chaumeil et al., 2013bChaumeil J. Micsinai M. Skok J.A. Combined immunofluorescence and DNA FISH on 3D-preserved interphase nuclei to study changes in 3D nuclear organization.J Vis Exp. 2013; 72: e50087PubMed Google Scholar) and found 60% of IL2RG alleles associated with a 53BP1 focus in HSPCs treated with ZFN or HS RNP (3 independent donors, 2 males, and 1 female; Figures 1E, 1F, and S1A). Of note, bi-allelic association was well represented in the female HSPCs. Conversely, none of the fewer 53BP1 foci detected in control treated cells associated with IL2RG. The IL2RG-53BP1 association in edited cells was specific, as we did not detect association between 53BP1 and the X-linked TLR7/TLR8 control loci, distal from the intended nuclease target site (Figure S1B). Furthermore, the percentage of 53BP1-positive cells within 24 h post-editing correlated with the fraction of NHEJ measured at the target locus among different experiments, although being generally lower for the former assay (Figure 1G). The majority of 53BP1 foci identified upon editing co-localized with the DDR marker γH2AX, even if more γH2AX foci per cell were identified in all conditions, including controls (Figure S1C). We next measured the expression level of the DDR downstream effector CDKN1A (hereafter named p21). p21 levels were transiently upregulated with both platforms early post-DSBs (Figures 1H and 1I), with more pronounced and prolonged response to LS than HS RNP (Figure 1I). Of note, some increase in p21 levels was also observed in response to the sole electroporation compared to untreated samples (Figure 1H). Accordingly, a modest proliferation delay was observed in response to highly specific nucleases although robust growth arrest was observed with the LS reagent (Figure 1J), accompanied by only a slightly increased apoptosis rate in the latter condition (Figure S1D). Whereas no treatment skewed culture composition over time (Figures S1E and S1F), significantly fewer colonies were generated in methylcellulose assays only from LS-treated HSPCs (Figure 1K). Overall, these data indicate that nuclease specificity and not the choice of platform is the major driver of DDR upon gene editing and that delivery of only one or few DNA DSBs in cultured HSPCs triggers a transient cellular response, which has minor impact on proliferation and clonogenic output. To study the transcriptional impact of gene editing in individual cells, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on HSPCs treated with IL2RG ZFN, HS, LS, or control RNP. To enhance representation of the more primitive cells, we sorted CD34+ CD133+ CD90+ cells (named “primitive”) and admixed them 1 to 1 to sorted CD34+ CD133+ CD90− committed progenitors (“progenitors”) for the sequencing analysis. We used male donor cells (which carry only one IL2RG allele), expecting that most cells treated with the more specific nucleases would experience only one on-target DSB, and analyzed cells 24 h after nuclease delivery, when most DSBs have occurred and been repaired. We also included cells treated with HS RNP and AAV6 delivering a GFP-expressing repair template and sorted for targeted integration (HS/AAV6 GFP+ versus HS/AAV6 GFP−). Using a droplet-based approach, we generated scRNA-seq data from 15,431 cells, detecting a median of 2,701 genes/cell (Figure S2A). To identify cell subpopulations and better enable comparison across datasets, we performed multi-set canonical correlation analysis and segregated cell clusters using the Louvain graph-based clustering approach. We computed the significant components using a supervised approach based on a list of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between HSCs and progenitors in culture (Fares et al., 2017Fares I. Chagraoui J. Lehnertz B. MacRae T. Mayotte N. Tomellini E. Aubert L. Roux P.P. Sauvageau G. EPCR expression marks UM171-expanded CD34+ cord blood stem cells.Blood. 2017; 129: 3344-3351Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar; Figures 2A and S2B; Data S1B). We identified 6 clusters, 2 of which were enriched for HSC and multipotent progenitors (MPP) marker genes and depleted of lineage-associated markers (hereafter named “HSC-enriched” clusters 1 and 2), with cluster 2 showing higher expression of cell cycle genes, despite clustering being performed with partial regression for cell cycle genes. These two subsets comprised the majority of cells expressing THY1 (CD90), PROCR (EPCR), and other genes previously reported to be upregulated in ex vivo cultured HSPCs endowed with repopulation potential (Figures 2B and S2C). The other clusters were enriched for different sets of lineage-associated genes and were hereafter named “myeloid-biased,” “monocytes/DC/preB-biased,” “neutrophil-biased,” and “erythroid-megakaryocyte-biased” progenitors, according to enrichment of previously reported gene signatures of purified HSPCs with distinct differentiation potential (Figures 2B, 2C, S2C, and S2D; Doulatov et al., 2013Doulatov S. Vo L.T. Chou S.S. Kim P.G. Arora N. Li H. Hadland B.K. Bernstein I.D. Collins J.J. Zon L.I. Daley G.Q.

Haas S.F. Raffel S. Blaszkiewicz S. Islam S. Hennig B.P. Hirche C. Lutz C. Buss E.C. Nowak D. et al.Human haematopoietic stem cell lineage commitment is a continuous process.Nat. Cell Biol. 2017; 19: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Consistently with published data on uncultured HSPCs, cells expressing the HSC and not any lineage bias gene signature reflected a continuum of transcriptional states gradually acquiring either myeloid or erythroid lineage signatures, as shown by the trajectories of ordered cells in pseudotime (Figures S2E and S2F). Each identified cluster comprised cells from all treatment conditions in similar ratios, except for a trend toward lower representation of the “HSC-enriched 2” cluster in the sample sorted for targeted integration (HS/AAV6 GFP+; Figure 2D). Similarly, the identifying gene signatures appeared expressed likewise across the different editing or control conditions (Figure S2B). Treatment type did not impact clustering across the samples, even when clustering was performed in an unsupervised manner (Figure S2G; Data S1B). Further subclustering of the HSC-enriched clusters 1 and 2 continued to segregate cells from the original cluster 2 separately from the other cells, which were further separated in 3 subclusters, with subcluster 1A cells showing the highest levels of the HSC gene signature (e.g., AVP, CRHBP, and MLLT3) and cells with increasing appearance of lineage-associated genes in subclusters 1B and 1C (Figures 2E and S2H–S2J). Analysis of genes expressed in different phases of the cell cycle predicted a substantially higher proportion of cells in S/G2/M phases in cluster 2 than in the others and the highest fraction of cells in G1 in subcluster 1A, suggesting that the former cells might be HSCs that have been activated (Figure 2F). Interestingly, cells in HSC-enriched subclusters 1A, 1B, and 1C, but not HSC-enriched cluster 2, expressed the lowest levels of HDR and NHEJ genes (Figures 2G and 2H). Even after increasing discrimination within the more primitive cell subset, we did not uncover an impact of the editing treatments on the distribution among subclusters. The transcriptional response to highly specific nucleases, either ZFN or RNP, was mild. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed significant upregulation of genes belonging to the p53 pathway and, to lesser extent, apoptosis and downregulation of c-MYC target genes in nearly all clusters (Figure 2I). In addition, significant upregulation of G2M checkpoint and mitotic spindle genes was observed in clusters comprising the most primitive cells. p53 pathway was also the only gene ontology (GO) term called across several clusters when overrepresentation analysis was performed on the top 100 upregulated genes (Figure S2K). A similar response, but more pervasive across all HSPC subpopulations, was elicited by LS RNP, which triggered higher p53 pathway activation with apoptosis and G2M checkpoint genes upregulation and stronger downregulation of c-MYC targets and oxidative phosphorylation genes. These changes were also revealed by computing the average overall expression of known p53 or c-MYC target genes (Fischer, 2017Fischer M. Census and evaluation of p53 target genes.Oncogene. 2017; 36: 3943-3956Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, Zeller et al., 2003Zeller K.I. Jegga A.G. Aronow B.J. O’Donnell K.A. Dang C.V. An integrated database of genes responsive to the Myc oncogenic transcription factor: identification of direct genomic targets.Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) per cell in each cluster (Figure 2J). Moreover, significant upregulation of inflammation gene categories was observed by GSEA in LS-RNP-treated cells. qPCR showed significant induction of CXCL8 (interleukin-8 [IL8]), IL6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) in response to LS RNP. No induction of IFN1β gene or type-I interferon (IFN) target genes was observed in the conditions tested (Figures 2K and S2L). Overall, these data indicate that p53 pathway activation and modulation of cell cycle genes are consistently observed upon nuclease treatment across different HSPC types and/or states, including the most primitive subset, as putatively identified in our single-cell analysis. This response is detectable but minor even after induction of a single DSB and substantially increases with lower nuclease specificity up to the activation of pro-inflammatory transcriptional programs. To increase the sensitivity of our analysis and extend it to another genomic locus, we performed whole transcriptomic analysis on sorted “primitive” and “progenitor” cells treated with the optimized IL2RG targeting ZFN pair or an early generation 4-finger ZFN pair targeting the AAVS1 safe harbor (Genovese et al., 2014Genovese P. Schiroli G. Escobar G. Tomaso T.D. Firrito C. Calabria A. Moi D. Mazzieri R. Bonini C.

Lo Riso P. et al.Site-specific integration and tailoring of cassette design for sustainable gene transfer.Nat. Methods. 2011; 8: 861-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). As control, we employed equimolar amount of IL2RG ZFN monomer. All edited samples displayed comparable high levels of target DNA cleavage and repair (Figure S3A). Upon IL2RG editing, we observed a very limited number of significant DEGs (adjusted p value < 0.05) in primitive (32 up and 3 down) and progenitor cells (35 up and 5 down), consistently with the contained response observed in single-cell analysis to this highly specific nuclease. The number of DEGs, although still limited, was higher in AAVS1-edited cells (103 up and 11 down in primitive; 85 up and 3 down in progenitors; Table S2). A high percentage of DEGs regulated upon IL2RG editing were contained within DEGs regulated upon AAVS1 editing in both subpopulations (Figures 3A and 3B ), indicating a shared transcriptional program between editing at the two loci, with additional transcriptional changes induced only in response to AAVS1 editing. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering, performed using the list of DEGs across conditions, retrieved 6 clusters of samples, grouped first by treatment (control monomers, DSB induced by IL2RG and AAVS1 ZFNs) as well as by cell populations. The gene regulation pattern was similar across all edited samples, with AAVS1-edited primitive cells clustering separately from the rest because of the stronger transcriptional response (Figure 3C; Data S1B). We next performed GSEA on gene lists ranked based on log2FC to identify the pathways modulated by nuclease-induced DSB and found positive and significantly high normalized enrichment score for genes belonging to categories involved in the DDR (p53 pathway, G2/M checkpoint, and UV-response-DN), cell cycle regulation (E2F targets and mitotic spindle), apoptosis, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and inflammation (TNF-α signaling via nuclear factor κB [NF-κB]; IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling; Figure 3D). We also observed negative enrichment for c-MYC target genes and genes involved in fatty-acid metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation. p53 pathway genes were highly enriched in all edited cells, and more gene categories were modulated in primitive versus progenitor cells with both editing reagents. When plotting the fold change of significant DEGs for each comparison, we found that nearly all top upregulated genes across HSPC subpopulations and editing conditions belonged to the p53 pathway (Figures 3E and 3F for primitive and Figures S3B and S3C for progenitors), with stronger modulation following AAVS1 editing in both subpopulations. Downregulated genes in IL2RG-edited cells were in proximity of the targeted locus and included IL2RG, MED12, SNX12, and OGT (Figure 3E; Figure S3B in green). Similarly, in AAVS1-edited cells, we identified PPP1R12C, the gene hosting AAVS1 (Figure 3F). These findings are consistent with previously reported transcriptional repression at DNA DSBs (Iannelli et al., 2017Iannelli F. Galbiati A. Capozzo I. Nguyen Q. Magnuson B. Michelini F. D’Alessandro G. Cabrini M. Roncador M. Francia S. et al.A damaged genome’s transcriptional landscape through multilayered expression profiling around in situ-mapped DNA double-strand breaks.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 15656Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), illustrate nucleases on-target activity, and validate the accuracy of our analyses. Consistent with the more robust transcriptional changes observed upon AAVS1 editing, we observed a more prolonged wave of 53BP1 foci accumulation (Figures S3D and S3E) and p21 level (Figure S3F) as compared to that observed in response to IL2RG editing (see Figures 1C, 1D, and 1H). In agreement with this, we observed reduced clonogenic output of edited cells compared to controls over time (Figure S3G), despite no significant changes in culture composition or apoptosis rate (Figures S3H and S3I). We next designed a gRNA against AAVS1 with high specificity within the same region targeted by our ZFN set (Table S1; Data S1A), and despite comparable levels of editing (Figure S3J), we observed a more rapid 53BP1 foci resolution (Figures S3K and S3L), transient p21 induction (Figure S3M), and no impact on clonogenic output, culture composition, or apoptosis rate of edited cells (Figures S3N–S3P). These observations indicate that the higher DDR burden observed in response to ZFN AAVS1 could be ascribed to lower specificity of these early generation reagents rather than the choice of the targeted locus. Overall, this in-depth transcriptomic analysis further indicates that the impact of one or few nuclease-induced DNA DSBs is minor and mainly limited to genes belonging to the p53 pathway. The same pathway was elicited by gene editing at two distinct genomic loci and was more pronounced in primitive versus progenitor cells. We then returned to analyze the transcriptional landscape of the HSPCs edited in the presence of an exogenous DNA template from the scRNA-seq experiment of Figure 2. Remarkably, the transcriptional changes observed in cells treated with HS RNP and AAV6 were more robust than those observed in cells treated only with HS RNP. By comparing gene-edited cells transduced with AAV6 and sorted for GFP expression (HS/AAV6 GFP+; enriched for HDR events) or not (HS/AAV6 GFP−) to control, we observed robust upregulation of genes mostly enriched in p53 pathway, apoptosis, and inflammatory response (Figures 4A and S4A). Significantly downregulated pathways included c-MYC targets and cell cycle genes. This pattern was observed throughout the different clusters, with higher normalized enrichment score (NES) for all HSC-enriched subclusters. When computing the average overall expression of known p53 or c-MYC target genes per cell in each cluster, we found that the extent of regulation was higher for cells treated with HS RNP/AAV6 compared to HS RNP alone and similar to cells treated with LS RNP alone (Figure 4B; see also Figure 2J). Indeed, the extent and pattern of DEGs versus control were similar among the AAV6-transduced cells to those observed in cells treated with LS RNP (Figure 4C). A good fraction of these upregulated genes in the AAV6-edited samples was shared with the LS-, but not HS-, RNP-treated cells, and was enriched in p53 pathway categories (Figures 4D and S4B). Among the few genes upregulated only upon AAV6 treatment, there were genes belonging to immune-related categories, including histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I genes (Figure 4D; see Figure 4B for average overall express"

https://openalex.org/W2924749043,"Summary The evolutionary expansion of the mammalian neocortex (Ncx) is thought to be linked to increased proliferative capacity of basal progenitors (BPs) and their neurogenic capacity. Here, by quantifying BP morphology in the developing Ncx of mouse, ferret, and human, we show that increased BP proliferative capacity is linked to an increase in BP process number. We identify human membrane-bound PALMDELPHIN (PALMD-Caax) as an underlying factor, and we show that it drives BP process growth and proliferation when expressed in developing mouse and ferret Ncx. Conversely, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated disruption of PALMD or its binding partner ADDUCIN-γ in fetal human Ncx reduces BP process numbers and proliferation.

To provide diagnostic clarity to all of these patients, however, there is a critical need for the field to develop and implement strategies to understand the mechanisms underlying all rare diseases and translate these to clinical care. The introduction of exome sequencing in the clinic has sparked tremendous optimism for the future of rare disease diagnosis, and there is exciting opportunity to further leverage these advances. To provide diagnostic clarity to all of these patients, however, there is a critical need for the field to develop and implement strategies to understand the mechanisms underlying all rare diseases and translate these to clinical care. Hundreds of millions of lives are affected by an estimated 10,000 unique genetically determined diseases. Individually, each disease affects a relatively small number of people, leading to their common label as rare genetic diseases (RDs); however, collectively, they represent an important public health opportunity. The vast majority of these patients experience long and grueling diagnostic odysseys and lack treatment. In 2011, recognition of both the longstanding inequity in care and the great opportunity for tractability due to technical developments led to the founding of the International Rare Diseases Research Consortium (IRDiRC), which aims to advance global cooperation among numerous stakeholders (Dawkins et al., 2018Dawkins H.J.S. Draghia-Akli R. Lasko P. Lau L.P.L. Jonker A.H. Cutillo C.M. Rath A. Boycott K.M. Baynam G. Lochmüller H. et al.International Rare Diseases Research Consortium (IRDiRC)Progress in Rare Diseases Research 2010-2016: An IRDiRC Perspective.Clin. Transl. Sci. 2018; 11: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The vision of IRDiRC is to enable all people living with a RD to receive an accurate diagnosis, care, and available therapy within 1 year of coming to medical attention (Austin et al., 2018Austin C.P. Cutillo C.M. Lau L.P.L. Jonker A.H. Rath A. Julkowska D. Thomson D. Terry S.F. de Montleau B. Ardigò D. et al.International Rare Diseases Research Consortium (IRDiRC)Future of Rare Diseases Research 2017-2027: An IRDiRC Perspective.Clin. Transl. Sci. 2018; 11: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Achieving an accurate and timely molecular diagnosis will largely depend on progress in the discovery of the genes and genetic mechanisms associated with RDs. While the exact number of RDs is debated (Hartley et al., 2018Hartley T. Balcı T.B. Rojas S.K. Eaton A. Canada C.R. Dyment D.A. Boycott K.M. The unsolved rare genetic disease atlas? An analysis of the unexplained phenotypic descriptions in OMIM®.Am. J. Med. Genet. C. Semin. Med. Genet. 2018; 178: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), it is estimated that thousands of RD genes and disease mechanisms remain undiscovered. Over the past 8 years, exome sequencing (ES) in both research and clinical settings has been a powerful tool for discovering new disease genes for RDs that were intractable to previous approaches. Most advances have been for highly recognizable clinical presentations associated with early age of onset and significant morbidity and mortality and caused by highly penetrant (typically protein-coding) variants (Boycott et al., 2017Boycott K.M. Rath A. Chong J.X. Hartley T. Alkuraya F.S. Baynam G. Brookes A.J. Brudno M. Carracedo A. den Dunnen J.T. et al.International Cooperation to Enable the Diagnosis of All Rare Genetic Diseases.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2017; 100: 695-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The diagnostic utility of ES has translated beautifully into the clinic, with a diagnostic yield in the range of 25%–30% among large and heterogeneous RD cohorts (Clark et al., 2018Clark M.M. Stark Z. Farnaes L. Tan T.Y. White S.M. Dimmock D. Kingsmore S.F. Meta-analysis of the diagnostic and clinical utility of genome and exome sequencing and chromosomal microarray in children with suspected genetic diseases.NPJ Genom. Med. 2018; 3: 16Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Here, we discuss the continued importance of ES in both the clinic and the research environment, the next wave of technologies on the horizon, and the next frontiers for RD discovery, moving toward the ultimate goal of diagnostic clarity for each and every family affected by a RD. The application of ES for RD patients represents a remarkable achievement in diagnostics, with a diagnostic yield far higher than other genetic tests (Clark et al., 2018Clark M.M. Stark Z. Farnaes L. Tan T.Y. White S.M. Dimmock D. Kingsmore S.F. Meta-analysis of the diagnostic and clinical utility of genome and exome sequencing and chromosomal microarray in children with suspected genetic diseases.NPJ Genom. Med. 2018; 3: 16Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, in >70% of patients in whom there was a high degree of pre-test suspicion for a monogenic RD, ES provides no molecular diagnosis. For the benefit of RD patients, it is imperative that we drive this diagnostic yield to as close to 100% as possible. While the theoretical yield of ES is unknown, in patient populations with specific presentations and a high degree of certainty that there is a genetic cause to the RD, the yield of the coding genome is likely well over 50% (Beaulieu et al., 2014Beaulieu C.L. Majewski J. Schwartzentruber J. Samuels M.E. Fernandez B.A. Bernier F.P. Brudno M. Knoppers B. Marcadier J.

Alkuraya F.S. Increasing the sensitivity of clinical exome sequencing through improved filtration strategy.Genet. Med. 2017; 19: 593-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Indeed, there remains substantial diagnostic potential in existing ES data. For starters, evidence is emerging that reanalysis of negative clinical ES data just 1 to 3 years later increases diagnostic yield by 10% (Wenger et al., 2017Wenger A.M. Guturu H. Bernstein J.A. Bejerano G. Systematic reanalysis of clinical exome data yields additional diagnoses: implications for providers.Genet. Med. 2017; 19: 209-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This is because at initial analysis, there was insufficient evidence for candidate variant or gene causality, but this evidence emerges upon reanalysis in light of the annual curation of >10,000 disease variants (ClinVar [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/] and HGMD [http://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk/ac/index.php]) and 250 novel disease-gene associations (OMIM [https://www.omim.org/] and Orphanet [https://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/index.php]). Even higher diagnostic yields can be achieved through reanalysis in collaboration with the referring physician, with estimates as high as 12% (Salmon et al., 2018Salmon L.B. Orenstein N. Markus-Bustani K. Ruhrman-Shahar N. Kilim Y. Magal N. Hubshman M.W. Bazak L. Improved diagnostics by exome sequencing following raw data reevaluation by clinical geneticists involved in the medical care of the individuals tested.Genet. Med. 2018; Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Collaboration with research laboratories can provide additional increases (Eldomery et al., 2017Eldomery M.K. Coban-Akdemir Z. Harel T. Rosenfeld J.A. Gambin T. Stray-Pedersen A. Küry S. Mercier S. Lessel D. Denecke J. et al.Lessons learned from additional research analyses of unsolved clinical exome cases.Genome Med. 2017; 9: 26Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) boosted by the application of novel computational tools, sequencing of additional family members, and gene-discovery efforts. These strategies have been bolstered by platforms that share genotype and phenotype information to identify patients with overlapping phenotypes and candidate genes, an approach called matchmaking (reviewed in Philippakis et al., 2015Philippakis A.A. Azzariti D.R. Beltran S. Brookes A.J. Brownstein C.A. Brudno M. Brunner H.G. Buske O.J. Carey K. Doll C. et al.The Matchmaker Exchange: a platform for rare disease gene discovery.Hum. Mutat. 2015; 36: 915-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar; www.matchmakerexchange.org). While technical limitations of ES are well recognized, in the last decade, capture kits have continued to enhance their coverage of the coding genome, with additional features to provide coverage of previously reported variants in promoters and deep intronic regions of known disease genes. In addition, computational tools continue to improve and facilitate the identification of variation. Given cost and other practical considerations, ES will continue to play a major role in RD variant diagnosis and discovery. Globally, thousands of clinical exomes are performed weekly, but unfortunately, the majority of these data are inaccessible for discovery and matchmaking. To realize the theoretical maximal diagnostic yield of ES will require a globally coordinated paradigm shift; every patient must have the opportunity to be a research patient. More international and less restrictive data sharing is critical to drive disease gene discovery, facilitate variant interpretation, enhance control datasets, and develop new computational tools. This will enable identification of RDs that are understood at a genetic level, while RDs that require further research can be studied as part of an “exome-negative” clinical infrastructure. Importantly, this paradigm shift will only be realized if, in parallel, we develop the appropriate computational architecture, ensure protection of participant privacy, and continue to promote the cultural shifts that will enable data sharing on a global scale. Importantly, aggregation of such data will contribute to the development of large datasets that can be used for as-yet undefined purposes as we explore new mechanisms for RD. Regardless of the ultimate capability of ES to provide diagnoses for RD patients, some disease mechanisms are difficult or impossible to detect using this approach (Table 1). For example, mosaicism of a pathogenic variant would not be routinely identified by current analytical approaches. Challenges for detection of mosaicism include the distribution of the causative genomic variation, which can be non-random and can exclude the most often-sampled tissue (blood) for genetic testing, the changing level of mosaicism over time, the difficulty in distinguishing pathogenic from benign or unrelated mosaic variation (signal to noise), and the high sequencing cost for the depth and breadth of coverage needed to detect low-level mosaic variants. New data-analysis tools are emerging to screen for mosaicism in unsolved exome datasets, and approaches that facilitate very deep sequencing of targeted regions in a cost-effective manner will improve detection of mosaicism in the near term.Table 1Mechanisms of RD that are Currently Intractable to Exome Sequencing and AnalysisMechanismDescriptionApproachesGeneral MechanismPerspective for SolutionsaHorizon: near-term (within 5 years); frontier: longer-term (5 years and beyond).Mechanism SubcategoryMosaicismhorizontissue-specific mosaicismmosaic manifestations of Mendelian disorders; disorders that manifest only as mosaicismdeep sequencing of multiple tissuesGenomic alterationshorizonsmall insertions/deletionssmall structural changes missed by ES and microarray (<50 bp)GSlarge insertions/deletionslarger structural changes missed by ES and microarray (>50bp)GSchromosomal rearrangementsinversions/translocations; multiple deletions/duplicationsGSrepeat expansionstriplet and other expansionslong-read GStransposable elements (retrotransposons)genomic sequences that copy and paste into locations throughout the genome (such as mobile element insertions)novel approaches to data analysisGene regulationhorizonsplicing mutationssynonymous or splice site or intronic mutationsGS, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)imprintingaltered parent-of-origin specific expression patternmethylation arraysnext frontierregulatory DNA mutationspromoter, enhancer, and other regulatory mutationsGS, RNA-seq, High-C, prediction toolsnoncoding RNA mutationsintronic, intergenic, and antisense RNAs (e.g., microRNAs, small nucleolar RNAs [snoRNAs])novel approaches to data analysismutations that alter post-transcriptional or post-translational modificationsaltered RNA or protein modifications that impact stability or catalytic functionnovel approaches to data analysisComplex inheritancehorizonunusual or less common inheritance patternssex-limited expression, paradoxical inheritance, necessary but not sufficient CNVs, uniparental disomynovel approaches to data analysisnext frontiergenetic modifiersallele from one gene reduces or exacerbates the penetrance or expressivity of phenotype associated with another genenovel approaches to data analysis; validation in model organismsgene-environment interactionrare susceptibility allele combined with environmental triggerenvironmental exposure data capture, validation in model organisms, metabolomicsmaternal effectsmutation in the mother results in altered fetal environmentenvironmental-exposure data capture; validation in model organismsdigenic, oligogenic, or polygenicinteraction of two or more genesnovel approaches to data analysis; validation in model organismsa Horizon: near-term (within 5 years); frontier: longer-term (5 years and beyond). Open table in a new tab Some pathogenic genomic variants are missed entirely by ES. Genome sequencing (GS) (short-read sequencing) outperforms ES for indels (small insertion-deletions), copy-number variations (CNVs), and chromosomal rearrangements, while long-read GS promises further improvements in detection of rearrangements and the ability to identify RDs secondary to pathogenic repeat expansions. GS also provides the opportunity to identify regulatory variants that lie outside the exome, such as in promoters, enhancers, deep intronic regions, or distant-acting regulatory sequences located in intergenic regions, though interpretation of such variants and proof of causality are challenging. Such advantages of GS are the basis for promoting this approach over ES, and while robust head-to-head comparisons of the two approaches are still lacking, we hypothesize that GS will increase the diagnostic yield of a genome-wide clinical test by at least 10% in the near term. As clinical GS data accumulate and understanding of intronic and intergenic variation improves, this yield will significantly increase over the years. Several emerging technologies offer value as adjunct diagnostic tools by providing an approach to assess the functional significance of variants. For example, transcriptome sequencing can evaluate the functional consequences of variants that may affect splicing or gene regulation (e.g., decreased, increased, or monoallelic gene expression). This approach has been suggested to increase the diagnostic yield by 10%–35% in known genes for certain clinical indications. Although promising, its broad applicability for RDs is unknown given challenges around the availability of relevant tissues, including those at critical stages of development. Similarly, methylation arrays are providing functional insight into imprinting disorders, which are caused by alterations of the expressed copy number of imprinted genes, through epigenetic error, uniparental disomy, or CNVs/single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) of the regulatory DNA or the expressed allele (Soellner et al., 2017Soellner L. Begemann M. Mackay D.J. Grønskov K. Tümer Z. Maher E.R. Temple I.K. Monk D. Riccio A. Linglart A. et al.Recent Advances in Imprinting Disorders.Clin. Genet. 2017; 91: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). More than 100 human germline-imprinted genes distributed across the genome have been identified, and it is likely that more remain to be found. In addition, arrays can detect specific DNA methylation epi-signatures for RDs associated with chromatin dysregulation; these syndrome-specific biomarkers complement standard clinical diagnostics (Aref-Eshghi et al., 2018Aref-Eshghi E. Rodenhiser D.I. Schenkel L.C. Lin H. Skinner C. Ainsworth P. Paré G. Hood R.L. Bulman D.E. Kernohan K.D. et al.Care4Rare Canada ConsortiumGenomic DNA Methylation Signatures Enable Concurrent Diagnosis and Clinical Genetic Variant Classification in Neurodevelopmental Syndromes.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2018; 102: 156-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The true prevalence and phenotypic spectra of imprinting disorders will only be determined by the coordinated implementation of genomic and epigenomic technologies and recognition that the right family member to analyze might not be the affected individual. Similarly, atypical inheritance patterns should be considered when analyzing genomic data of unsolved RD patients; this will require even more sophisticated approaches to data analysis that will identify such mechanisms in a diagnostic setting (Table 1). Finally, for all of these new technologies, diagnostic standards will need to be established before clinical implementation to facilitate diagnostic clarity for as many patients as possible. Despite the excitement around GS, few RD discoveries have been made outside of the protein-coding regions of the genome. Comprehensive analysis of the noncoding genome on a broader scale represents a significant frontier (Table 1). The opportunity lies in the interpretation of noncoding variation, which is exponentially more difficult given the unresolved complexity of how noncoding DNA regulates gene expression, lack of adequate control datasets, and computational tools to predict variant impact and the fact that each of these noncoding variants is likely affecting only a single patient or family, resulting in a high benchmark to establish pathogenicity. While confirming predicted splicing abnormalities is relatively straightforward, as highlighted in the previous section, estimating the impact of mechanisms such as long-range DNA regulation, aberrant DNA modifications (such as methylation), pathogenic alterations to non-coding RNA, and post-transcriptional and post-translational dysregulation on RD will require significantly greater understanding of the genome and major advances in functional analytical approaches. Initial successes will likely center on the use of large families with linkage data to narrow the search space and a focus on noncoding de novo alterations in parent-affected child studies. Alongside monogenic RDs, we will face the challenge of RDs of complex etiology, with a primary genetic driver but clinical presentations that are contextualized by additional factors and these RDs represent another significant frontier of study. The relative impact of genetic and environmental components on RDs will depend on the underlying mechanism of interaction (signal transduction pathway, unfolded protein response, epigenetic modifications, etc.) and in the case of embryogenesis, when during development the impact is elicited and which developing organs/tissues are most vulnerable to perturbation at a given time. Environmental exposures may be pre- or post-natal, and the challenge will be to capture such exposure information based on history as well as dynamic biological data. Recently, insight into the thousands of metabolic reactions occurring within the human body (e.g., the metabolome) has shown promise as a readout of genes and the environment at a particular point in time. Such studies will require integration of epidemiological and multi-omic data in exposed and non-exposed populations. Experimental support for such complex mechanisms will require the use of functional assays and model organisms to validate findings (Shi et al., 2017Shi H. Enriquez A. Rapadas M. Martin E.M.M.A. Wang R. Moreau J. Lim C.K. Szot J.O. Ip E. Hughes J.N. et al.NAD Deficiency, Congenital Malformations, and Niacin Supplementation.N. Engl. J. Med. 2017; 377: 544-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). By comparison, the investigation of digenic, oligogenic, and polygenic inheritance models may seem relatively straightforward, but one should not be deceived, and this represents yet another frontier. To perform such analyses and collect the evidence required for the statistical certainty needed to support an RD mechanism, a massive amount of harmonized phenotypic, genotypic, and family history data will be required. The establishment of such datasets reinforces the need to offer research access and broad data sharing to all RD patients and their families. Our ability to diagnose all RDs is limited by our incomplete understanding of the full mutational spectrum associated with all RDs and the sheer number of unique RDs that have yet to be defined. The way forward is readily recognized as multifaceted and will likely focus on specific subsets of patients from the unsolved RD cohort (Figure 1); each subset has significant utility for exploring RD mechanisms and optimizing approaches for clinical translation of novel diagnostic tests. Patients in the unsolved RD cohort can be considered in four groups, and while the approaches used to uncover the genetic mechanism for the respective RDs may be similar between groups, the knowledge gained for each will be unique. Patients in this group have had the appropriate genetic test that is highly sensitive for that particular RD but remain without a molecular diagnosis (e.g., single-gene disorders such as cystic fibrosis and neurofibromatosis type 1). In all likelihood, the causative variant(s) in these patients is/are not detected by the current testing methodologies, and therefore, this subset of patients represents a remarkable opportunity to explore novel diagnostic approaches, including new technologies and computational tools, to more comprehensively assess the spectrum of possible genetic causes of a given disease. The insights delivered will be directly relevant to these patients while also optimizing patient sampling, computational tools, and diagnostic algorithms based on emerging technologies. More broadly, such knowledge will contribute significantly to the mechanistic spectrum of other unsolved RDs. This type of exploratory focus represents a shift in the types of studies that our community traditionally values, and both funders and publishers will need to recognize the intermediate importance and long-term impacts of the resulting insights. Patients in this group have a clinically recognizable presentation associated with genetic heterogeneity (e.g., hereditary spastic paraplegia, myopathy, retinitis pigmentosa) but negative results for the appropriate testing and analysis, including most of the relevant disease genes. These patients have either a pathogenic variant in one of the known disease genes that was not detected using the current testing approach or a yet-to-be-discovered disease-associated gene. To diagnose these patients, we will need large datasets of patients that include detailed phenotypic and genomic information for data comparison and novel technologies and computational tools to identify cryptic variants. Besides GS, transcriptomic, metabolomic, epigenomic, and proteomic data may be necessary to identify the underlying genetic causes, particularly for simplex patients in which family-based analyses are not possible. This patient group represents an opportunity similar to the subset described above but is also enriched for novel disease-gene discovery and is likely one of the largest populations in the unsolved cohort. Patients in this group have a clinical diagnosis based on similarity to a previously described syndrome for which the underlying etiology is unknown (e.g., PHACE and Hallermann-Streiff syndromes, VACTERL association). With the efforts of the clinical and scientific communities and the increased use of ES, we now understand the genetic basis of most of the frequent and recognizable human malformation syndromes. However, some well-established syndromes (defined as reported in >10 unrelated patients and curated by OMIM and Orphanet) remain without an understood molecular etiology despite intensive investigation. Examples of such unsolved syndromes have been recently reviewed (Boycott et al., 2018Boycott K.M. Dyment D.A. Innes A.M. Unsolved recognizable patterns of human malformation: Challenges and opportunities.Am. J. Med. Genet. C. Semin. Med. Genet. 2018; 178: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) in a special issue on Unsolved Recognizable Patterns of Human Malformation: Challenges and Opportunities in the American Journal of Medical Genetics. Possible explanations for their current intractability include genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity, mosaicism, epigenetics, gene-environment interactions, and other non-Mendelian contributions. The way forward for this group of disorders will require the use of emerging and new technologies, global cooperation, and data sharing. The fourth group of patients present with a constellation of clinical symptoms and signs that are not recognizable as a previously described syndrome or condition, which may have non-specific clinical features, and fit into none of the above groups. Part of the challenge in the diagnosis of these patients is that the full extent of the clinical presentation may not yet have become manifest (as occurs in the evaluation of ill newborns). These patients are most suitable for genome-wide sequencing approaches and, for the foreseeable future, should undergo ES or GS as a first-line test followed by detailed genotypic and phenotypic data sharing for matchmaking purposes. Their diagnoses will likely include early presentations of recognized RDs, expanded phenotypes of previously recognized RDs, and novel RDs associated with new genes that will only be identified once RD datasets contain sufficient genotypic and phenotypic data to provide statistical confidence that an accurate diagnosis has been made and/or following validation in model organisms. We face a grand opportunity in precision public health: to understand the cause of each and every RD and provide a diagnosis for each individual RD patient. Clinical ES is transforming molecular diagnosis and will continue to have a remarkable impact on this area of medicine. For the patients that remain unsolved after genetic testing, the future remains optimistic. A large number of emerging technologies are on the horizon and will play an important role in RD diagnostics in the near term. Computational approaches that focus on large-scale data integration across patients and within the single patient (“systems diagnostics”), and from healthy individuals, will enable the next frontiers of RD discovery. As we work toward our goal of diagnostic clarity for all, we will gain important insights into the RD genome and the attendant knowledge about human biology that this will bring. Importantly, there are some cross-cutting requisites for the clinical and research community to enable this important work and reach not just the current horizons of RD diagnostics, but the next frontiers as well. To start, we need to provide all RD patients the ability to access clinical genome-wide testing and participate in research. At the health-systems level, we must implement the timely, prioritized, and sustainable clinical integration of proven innovative diagnostic approaches; this will scale the input side of the equation, serving patient needs and fueling translational research discovery. In facilitating research participation, we must include those that we do not typically consider, collecting data for those with molecular diagnoses, and the clinically diagnosed but causative-variant-negative patients, and support the necessary infrastructure. Going forward, we need to address the fundamental lack of RD researchers that study complex mechanisms by enabling an emerging new generation of scientists in this area with adequate funding and by contributing to comprehensive RD datasets that will provide the foundation for their work. Most critically, we must recognize that the future of RD diagnostics will depend on the international RD community working as one team toward an ambitious and important joint goal. We need to overcome a mindset limited to individual patients; individual researchers; individual genetic mechanisms; and even individual consortia, countries, or continents. The vision of IRDiRC, for each RD patient to receive a diagnosis within 1 year, is achievable only if we collectively take up this grand opportunity on a global scale."

https://openalex.org/W2981320635,"Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease for which there currently is no cure. Aggregation of the pre-synaptic protein α-synuclein (aSN) into oligomers (αSOs) is believed to play a key role in PD pathology, but little is known about αSO formation in vivo and how they induce neurodegeneration. Both the naturally occurring polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and the lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), strongly upregulated during ROS conditions, stimulate the formation of αSOs, highlighting a potential role in PD. Yet, insight into αSOs structure and biological effects is still limited as most oligomer preparations studied to date are heterogeneous in composition. Here we have aggregated aSN in the presence of HNE and DHA and purified the αSOs using size exclusion chromatography. Both compounds stimulate formation of spherical αSOs containing anti-parallel β-sheet structure which have the same shape as unmodified αSOs though ca. 2-fold larger. Furthermore, the yield and stabilities of these oligomers are significantly higher than for unmodified aSN. Both modified and unmodified αSOs permeabilize synthetic vesicles, show high co-localisation with glutamatergic synapses and decrease Long Term Potentiation (LTP), in line with the reported synaptotoxic effects of αSOs. We conclude that DHA- and HNE-αSOs are convenient models for pathogenic disease-associated αSOs in PD."

https://openalex.org/W2923523446,"Genomic alterations in cancer cells result in vulnerabilities that clinicians can exploit using molecularly targeted drugs, guided by knowledge of the tumour genotype. However, the selective activity of these drugs exerts an evolutionary pressure on cancers that can result in the outgrowth of resistant clones. Use of rational drug combinations can overcome resistance to targeted drugs, but resistance may eventually develop to combinatorial therapies. We selected MAPK- and PI3K-pathway inhibition in colorectal cancer as a model system to dissect out mechanisms of resistance. We focused on these signalling pathways because they are frequently activated in colorectal tumours, have well-characterised mutations and are clinically relevant. By treating a panel of 47 human colorectal cancer cell lines with a combination of MEK- and PI3K-inhibitors, we observe a synergistic inhibition of growth in almost all cell lines. Cells with KRAS mutations are less sensitive to PI3K inhibition, but are particularly sensitive to the combined treatment. Colorectal cancer cell lines with inherent or acquired resistance to monotherapy do not show a synergistic response to the combination treatment. Cells that acquire resistance to an MEK-PI3K inhibitor combination treatment still respond to an ERK-PI3K inhibitor regimen, but subsequently also acquire resistance to this combination treatment. Importantly, the mechanisms of resistance to MEK and PI3K inhibitors observed, MEK1/2 mutation or loss of PTEN, are similar to those detected in the clinic. ERK inhibitors may have clinical utility in overcoming resistance to MEK inhibitor regimes; however, we find a recurrent active site mutation of ERK2 that drives resistance to ERK inhibitors in mono- or combined regimens, suggesting that resistance will remain a hurdle. Importantly, we find that the addition of low concentrations of the BCL2-family inhibitor navitoclax to the MEK-PI3K inhibitor regimen improves the synergistic interaction and blocks the acquisition of resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2957031313,"Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) and type 2 (DM2) are autosomal dominant multisystemic disorders linked to two different genetic loci and characterized by several features including myotonia, muscle atrophy and insulin resistance. The aberrant alternative splicing of insulin receptor (IR) gene and post-receptor signalling abnormalities have been associated with insulin resistance, however the precise molecular defects that cause metabolic dysfunctions are still unknown. Thus, the aims of this study were to investigate in DM skeletal muscle biopsies if beyond INSR missplicing, altered IR protein expression could play a role in insulin resistance and to verify if the lack of insulin pathway activation could contribute to skeletal muscle wasting. Our analysis showed that DM skeletal muscle exhibits a lower expression of the insulin receptor in type 1 fibers which can contribute to the defective activation of the insulin pathway. Moreover, the aberrant insulin signalling activation leads to a lower activation of mTOR and to an increase in MuRF1 and Atrogin-1/MAFbx expression, possible explaining DM skeletal muscle fiber atrophy. Taken together our data indicate that the defective insulin signalling activation can contribute to skeletal muscle features in DM patients and are probably linked to an aberrant specific-fiber type expression of the insulin receptor."

Neurons are often preprogrammed to respond to multiple axon guidance signals because they use sequential guideposts along their pathways, but this necessitates a strict spatiotemporal regulation of intracellular signaling to ensure the cues are detected in the correct order. We performed a mouse mutagenesis screen and identified the Rho GTPase antagonist p190RhoGAP as a critical regulator of motor axon guidance. Rather than acting as a compulsory signal relay, p190RhoGAP uses a non-conventional GAP-independent mode to transiently suppress attraction to Netrin-1 while motor axons exit the spinal cord. Once in the periphery, a subset of axons requires p190RhoGAP-mediated inhibition of Rho signaling to target specific muscles. Thus, the multifunctional activity of p190RhoGAP emerges from its modular design.

Cellular communication is controlled by signaling processes that are inherently context dependent and temporally regulated. An extreme example of signaling complexity is manifested in the way axon growth is directed. During embryonic development, neurons build intricate connectivity networks through combinatorial, synergistic, and sequential activation of a conserved but remarkably limited set of ligand-receptor systems (Bonanomi et al., 2012Bonanomi D.

Although elegant, this design strategy risks introducing signaling noise due to the temporal and spatial overlap of competing guidance signals. Nevertheless, the intrinsic filters that sort potentially conflicting instructions within neurons are poorly understood. Axon trajectories are not simply defined by the complement of guidance systems within each neuronal population; rather, they also depend on tight control of receptor deployment through differential splicing, localized synthesis, trafficking, and proteolytic processing that enable neurons to adjust their sensitivity to directional cues at intermediate steps along their projection pathways (Bai and Pfaff, 2011Bai G.

Despite these multiple layers of control, growing axons are often equipped ahead of time with receptors that will be used at later steps of navigation, presumably to ensure timely activation of guidance responses (Dickson and Zou, 2010Dickson B.J.

The risk associated with this preparedness is accidental or premature detection of contradictory instructions from opposing guidance signals, leading to axon targeting errors. While many control mechanisms that operate at the receptor level have been documented, the degree to which intracellular components contribute to correct detection of guidance cues at specific times and places during pathfinding is less clear. A few signaling regulators preferentially associated with individual guidance receptors have been identified (Bashaw and Klein, 2010Bashaw G.J. Klein R. Signaling from axon guidance receptors.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2010; 2: a001941Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, O’Donnell et al., 2009O’Donnell M. Chance R.K. Bashaw G.J. Axon growth and guidance: receptor regulation and signal transduction.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 32: 383-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar); yet, for the most part the downstream nodes of axon guidance pathways appear to be relatively unspecialized compared to cell-surface receptors and ligands. Thus, a common view is that neuron-type-specific connectivity is primarily determined by the selective expression of receptor systems that impinge on a somewhat “generic” obligatory but non-instructive signal transduction machinery, shared among many cell types for the control of basic cell motility and chemotaxis. However, because there is remarkable conservation among the intrinsic components of signaling pathways it has been challenging to distinguish their roles as core effectors versus instructive regulators. We conducted a mouse ENU (N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea) mutagenesis screen designed to identify instructive determinants of axon guidance in spinal motor neurons (Lewcock et al., 2007Lewcock J.W. Genoud N. Lettieri K. Pfaff S.L. The ubiquitin ligase Phr1 regulates axon outgrowth through modulation of microtubule dynamics.Neuron. 2007; 56: 604-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The cell bodies of motor neurons reside in the ventral spinal cord, while their axons exit the CNS to connect with target muscles (Bonanomi, 2019Bonanomi D. Axon pathfinding for locomotion.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2019; 85: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, Jessell, 2000Jessell T.M. Neuronal specification in the spinal cord: inductive signals and transcriptional codes.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2000; 1: 20-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar). From our forward genetic mouse screen, we isolated the Cassin mutant, in which separate classes of motor neurons make guidance errors at multiple choice-points for axon turning. The Cassin mutation was mapped to the Arhgap35 gene, which encodes the GTPase-activating protein p190RhoGAP, a negative regulator of RhoA family GTPases required for tissue morphogenesis with evolutionarily conserved roles in axon branching and fasciculation (Billuart et al., 2001Billuart P.

We show that p190RhoGAP prevents inappropriate activation of Netrin-DCC signaling when motor axons navigate out of the spinal cord. Despite the classification of p190 as a RhoGAP, gating of Netrin-DCC signaling was independent of the control of Rho GTPases. Our findings identify an intracellular signaling regulator that imposes a context-dependent switch upon the timing of guidance receptor activation to ensure axons ignore incongruous directional signals that would divert their normal path causing miswiring of neural circuits. In order to identify recessive genes involved in the development of spinal motor neurons, we conducted a forward genetic screen in which mice expressing a motor neuron-specific farnesylated-GFP reporter (ISLMN::fGFP) were mutagenized with ENU, and the offspring were intercrossed to generate homozygous mutants (Lewcock et al., 2007Lewcock J.W. Genoud N. Lettieri K. Pfaff S.L. The ubiquitin ligase Phr1 regulates axon outgrowth through modulation of microtubule dynamics.Neuron. 2007; 56: 604-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). fGFP-labeled motor projections were visualized in whole embryo flat mounts, which were used to screen for defects in motor axon development (Figure 1A). To increase the probability of unmasking regulatory molecular switches of guidance pathways rather than structural or permissive components, we focused on mutants in which motor axons did not simply display abnormal morphogenesis (e.g., arrested growth, impaired branching) but were diverted from their normal trajectories. With these criteria, we identified a mutant line, named Cassin after the Italian mountaineering explorer, which displayed severe motor axon projection errors characterized by ectopic axon bundles at the pial surface (i.e., the boundary between the CNS and periphery) (Figures 1B, 1C, and S1A–S1F). Rather than leaving the spinal cord through the ventral root exit points, Cassin mutants formed aberrant motor fascicles that extended dorsally in close apposition to the limiting membrane of the spinal cord (Figures 1E–1H). Defects in motor axon exiting were highly penetrant, observed at every spinal cord level, and resulted in the corresponding depletion and disorganization of the ventral roots (Figures S1B, S1C, and S1F). In some instances, ectopic bundles grew in the interstitial space between the sensory dorsal root ganglia and the outer surface of the spinal cord, which is covered by meningeal membranes, but unlike EphA3/A4 mutants were never observed invading the sensory ganglia (Gallarda et al., 2008Gallarda B.W. Bonanomi D. Müller D. Brown A. Alaynick W.A. Andrews S.E. Lemke G. Pfaff S.L. Marquardt T. Segregation of axial motor and sensory pathways via heterotypic trans-axonal signaling.Science. 2008; 320: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Because motor axons were rerouted onto an ectopic path in Cassin embryos, we reasoned that the ENU mutation might have affected pathfinding rather than a more general aspect of axon growth. Defects in motor projection were not accompanied by a change in total motor neuron number or cell body positioning (Figures 1E–1H and S1H–S1J). Cassin mutants were born at the expected Mendelian ratio but died soon after birth with cyanosis and respiratory failure. Although a recessive mutation, occasionally heterozygous Cassin mutants had small ectopic motor axon bundles, and a minority of homozygous mutant embryos (<2%) displayed neural tube closure defects and exencephaly (Figures S1E, S1G, and 2N ). To visualize the aberrant intraspinal motor axons at higher resolution, we imaged spinal cord “open-book” preparations (Figure S1K). While in wild-type embryos ISLMN::fGFP exclusively labeled the bilateral columns of motor neuron cell bodies, in Cassin mutants numerous ectopic GFP+ axons bundles were found throughout the intermediate region of the spinal cord (Figures 1I–1J). These intraspinal fascicles were formed by axons that converged within each spinal segment (Figures 1K, S1N, and S1O). Although the majority of misprojecting axons remained inside the spinal cord, some were found in the surrounding meninges (Figures S1L and S1M). Thus, a unique hallmark of motor neurons—their ability to project axons through the basal boundary of the neuroepithelium and into the periphery—is severely affected in Cassin mutants (Figure 1L). In addition, Cassin mutants displayed discrete defects in distal projection of subsets of motor neurons. Specifically, thoracic intercostal nerves formed by hypaxial motor neurons were defasciculated (Figures S1P–S1R), and the hindlimb-innervating peroneal nerve displayed an aberrant proximal branch resulting in thinning or ablation of the main nerve tract (Figures S1S–S1U). Taken together, the Cassin mutation affects both proximal (axon exiting) and distal (muscle targeting) pathfinding decisions but does not appear to disrupt axon growth per se. To identify the Cassin mutation with single-base pair resolution, we performed deep sequencing of mRNAs extracted from the spinal cord and surrounding mesenchyme of mutant embryos and control littermates. SNP-discovery identified an A > T transversion in the first exon of the Arhgap35 gene that encodes the Rho GTPase-activating protein p190RhoGAP (hereafter p190). The novel SNP causes the amino acid substitution I602N, which alters a highly conserved residue and is predicted as “deleterious” by in silico tools (see STAR Methods) (Figures 1M–1O). All affected embryos, but none of the phenotypically normal littermates, were homozygous for the mutation. Compared to wild-type embryos, p190 protein levels were strongly reduced in Cassin (p190I602N/I602N) mutants (Figure 1P). When equal amounts of p190 were immunoprecipitated from mutant and control embryonic spinal cords using limiting antibody, p190I602N had lower stoichiometry of tyrosine-phosphorylation and impaired association with the binding partner p120RasGAP—both are indications of altered signaling competence (Figure 1Q) (Bouton et al., 1991Bouton A.H.

Inhibition of RhoGAP activity is sufficient for the induction of Rho-mediated actin reorganization.Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As expected, higher amounts of GTP-bound (active) RhoA were pulled down from the spinal cord of p190I602N/I602N embryos (Figure 1R). These results indicate that the Cassin mutation severely affects p190 protein levels and activity. To confirm that the motor axon guidance defects observed in Cassin mutants were due to p190 loss of function, we crossed the ISLMN::fGFP reporter into p190 knockout mice (Brouns et al., 2000Brouns M.R. Matheson S.F. Hu K.Q. Delalle I. Caviness V.S. Silver J. Bronson R.T. Settleman J. The adhesion signaling molecule p190 RhoGAP is required for morphogenetic processes in neural development.Development. 2000; 127: 4891-4903Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Embryos with a targeted disruption of p190 exhibited motor axon guidance phenotypes similar to Cassin mutants, including failure to exit the spinal cord (Figure 1D), aberrant “bridging” of intercostal nerves (Figure S2K), and limb innervation defects (Figure S2M). As observed for Cassin mutants, p190 knockout mice died at birth, and a subset exhibited neural tube closure defects (Brouns et al., 2000Brouns M.R. Matheson S.F. Hu K.Q. Delalle I. Caviness V.S. Silver J. Bronson R.T. Settleman J. The adhesion signaling molecule p190 RhoGAP is required for morphogenetic processes in neural development.Development. 2000; 127: 4891-4903Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Next, we crossed the Cassin and p190 knockout alleles to generate embryos heterozygous for both mutations. Compound Cassin and p190 hemizygotes displayed motor projection phenotypes virtually identical to homozygous mutants of the two alleles (Figures 2A–2G and 2N). Lack of complementation between the two recessive mutations demonstrates that the ENU mutant Cassin is a new loss-of-function allele of p190. These findings highlight the critical role of p190 for a discrete subset of motor axon guidance decisions. The specificity of these phenotypes is remarkable in light of the wholesale increase in RhoA activation observed in p190 mutants. p190 is expressed ubiquitously, with enrichment in the developing CNS (Brouns et al., 2000Brouns M.R. Matheson S.F. Hu K.Q. Delalle I. Caviness V.S. Silver J. Bronson R.T. Settleman J. The adhesion signaling molecule p190 RhoGAP is required for morphogenetic processes in neural development.Development. 2000; 127: 4891-4903Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Figures S2A and S2B). Despite the widespread distribution, the overall pattern of peripheral nerves comprising both sensory and motor axons appeared largely intact in mutant embryos (Figures S2C and S2D; data not shown). Thus, identification of the p190 mutant was likely only possible because of the motor neuron-specific GFP reporter employed in our screen. The broad expression of p190 raised the question of whether the motor phenotypes observed in mutant mice reflected a requirement in motor neurons or in other cells that may indirectly influence motor axon targeting. To distinguish between these possibilities, we generated a transgenic mouse line (p190-RFPLSL) that enables Cre-dependent expression of RFP-tagged p190 upon removal of a “floxable” STOP cassette (Figure 2H). Olig2MN::Cre (Dessaud et al., 2007Dessaud E. Yang L.L. Hill K. Cox B. Ulloa F. Ribeiro A. Mynett A. Novitch B.G. Briscoe J. Interpretation of the sonic hedgehog morphogen gradient by a temporal adaptation mechanism.Nature. 2007; 450: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) was used to achieve restricted expression of p190-RFP in motor neurons at levels ∼2.5-fold higher than endogenous p190 (Figures 2J, 2K, and S2E). Next, we combined p190-RFPLSL and Olig2MN::Cre with the p190 knockout allele and visualized motor projections in embryos that lack p190 in all tissues except motor neurons expressing exogenous p190-RFP (Figure 2I). Reestablishing p190 expression in motor neurons was sufficient to correct all motor axon guidance phenotypes of p190 mutants, including spinal cord exiting defects and abnormal projections of intercostal and limb nerves (Figures 2L–2N and S2F–S2N). Therefore, p190 functions intrinsically within motor neurons for proper axonal targeting. In Cassin mutants, p190 loss of function leads to an abnormal increase in active RhoA. To address whether the control of motor axon targeting by p190 was mediated by its inhibitory effect on Rho, we employed CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene targeting to generate mice harboring a point mutation in p190 that disrupts the catalytic arginine R1284 required for GAP activity (Li et al., 1997Li R. Zhang B. Zheng Y. Structural determinants required for the interaction between Rho GTPase and the GTPase-activating domain of p190.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32830-32835Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) (Figure 3A). The p190R1284A variant lacking GAP activity was expressed at levels comparable to the wild-type protein (Figure S3A). Embryos expressing exclusively p190R1284A (p190R1284A/−) were compared to p190+/− controls (see STAR Methods). As expected, loss of GAP activity resulted in a substantial increase in GTP-bound (active) RhoA in p190R1284A embryo spinal cords (Figure S3B). Strikingly, motor axon exiting and intercostal nerves were normal in p190R1284A mutants, whereas the peroneal nerve in the hindlimb was severely affected (Figures 3B–3I). We conclude that distinct motor axon pathways display differential dependence on the GAP activity of p190. These results argue for a non-canonical function of p190 in mediating motor axon exiting from the spinal cord. p190 contains additional signaling motifs besides the GAP domain, including an N-terminal GTP-binding domain (Foster et al., 1994Foster R. Hu K.Q. Shaywitz D.A. Settleman J. p190 RhoGAP, the major RasGAP-associated protein, binds GTP directly.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7173-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Knockin mice containing a point mutation (S36N) that impairs GTP binding display all three distinctive phenotypes of p190 mutants (defective axon exiting, intercostal bridging, and peroneal nerve mistargeting), albeit with reduced expressivity (Figures S3C, S3D, and S3G–S3K, cf. Figures 2N and 7P). Although p190S36N transcript levels were comparable to those of the wild-type allele, p190S36N protein levels were lower (Figures S3E and S3F). Because p190S36N is a hypomorphic mutant, it remains unclear whether GTP binding is required per se for motor pathfinding. Nevertheless, these results provide evidence that motor axons are sensitive to lowering of p190 levels beyond a critical threshold. The proximal projection phenotype of p190 mutants was reminiscent of the defects observed in knockout embryos for the chemokine receptor Cxcr4 (Lieberam et al., 2005Lieberam I. Agalliu D. Nagasawa T. Ericson J. Jessell T.M. A Cxcl12-CXCR4 chemokine signaling pathway defines the initial trajectory of mammalian motor axons.Neuron. 2005; 47: 667-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This similarity led us to hypothesize that p190 might mediate Cxcr4 signaling required for motor axon exiting. To study epistatic interactions, we generated an allelic series of compound p190/Cxcr4 mutants and visualized motor projections with ISLMN::fGFP (Figures 4A–4H and S4E–S4I). Cxcr4−/− embryos displayed ectopic motor axon fascicles at the spinal cord interface, which were more irregular and abundant compared to p190 knockouts, possibly reflecting guidance errors immediately past the exit points (Figures 4F, 4I, and S4A–S4C) (Lieberam et al., 2005Lieberam I. Agalliu D. Nagasawa T. Ericson J. Jessell T.M. A Cxcl12-CXCR4 chemokine signaling pathway defines the initial trajectory of mammalian motor axons.Neuron. 2005; 47: 667-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The number of ectopic axon bundles was markedly increased in embryos harboring a combination of p190 and Cxcr4 mutant alleles compared to single mutants (Figure 4I). Strikingly, with the removal of one or two p190 alleles from Cxcr4 knockouts (p190+/−;Cxcr4−/− or p190−/−;Cxcr4−/−) the vast majority of motor axons failed to reach the periphery (Figures 4G–4K′, S4D, and S4G–S4I). To further examine the relationship between p190 and Cxcr4 signaling, we used in vitro assays. Since the transient expression of Cxcr4 in motor neurons makes the use of primary cells impractical (Lieberam et al., 2005Lieberam I. Agalliu D. Nagasawa T. Ericson J. Jessell T.M. A Cxcl12-CXCR4 chemokine signaling pathway defines the initial trajectory of mammalian motor axons.Neuron. 2005; 47: 667-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), we differentiated motor neurons from either wild-type or p190 mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCMN). ESCMN expressed Cxcr4 and activated signaling in response to Cxcl12 (Figure S4J; data not shown). Cxcl12 treatment enhanced motor axon outgrowth in both wild-type and p190-null ESCMN neurospheres to a comparable extent (Figures 4L–4P). In addition, chemokine signaling was normal in p190−/− ESCMN (Figure S4J), and the levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated p190 did not change after Cxcl12 stimulation (Figure S4K). Thus, Cxcl12/Cxcr4 signaling promotes motor axon growth independently of p190. Counter to our initial hypothesis, these results indicate that p190 and Cxcr4 function in parallel pathways that synergize to instruct motor axon projection from the spinal cord (Figure S4L). p190 has been linked to semaphorin signaling in other systems, and mouse mutants with impaired Sema3A and/or Sema3F activity display intercostal nerve defasciculation similar to p190 mutants (Barberis et al., 2005Barberis D.

However, we found that motor axon exiting was normal in either Sema3A or Sema3F mutant embryos. In addition, the severity of the p190−/− phenotype was not significantly altered in p190/Sema3A and p190/Sema3F double knockouts, indicating that these semaphorins are dispensable for motor axon exiting and are not implicated in the defects observed in p190 mutants (Figure S4M) In order to gain insight into the signaling pathways that require p190 to control motor axon guidance, motor neurons isolated from p190−/− embryos were gene profiled using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). This analysis did not reveal gene expression changes that could underlie defects in motor neuron development (Figure S5A). Next, p190 was immunoprecipitated from the ventral spinal cord of e12.5 embryos, and the associated proteins were identified by tandem mass spectrometry. Bioinformatic analysis of p190-interacting proteins revealed enrichment in regulators of cell morphogenesis, cytoskeletal organization, and axon guidance (Figure S5B). Of particular interest was the identification of components of Netrin signaling, a conserved guidance pathway that influences motor neuron projection (Poliak et al., 2015Poliak S. Morales D. Croteau L.P. Krawchuk D. Palmesino E. Morton S. Cloutier J.F. Charron F. Dalva M.B.

These findings prompted us to examine whether p190 participates in Netrin-1/DCC signaling and whether this guidance system is required for motor axon exiting.

Several startups in the genetic testing space are aiming to empower individuals and build communities in order to boost research and, ultimately, public health. Millions of people have taken direct-to-consumer DNA tests, but not everyone is happy with the status quo. Several startups in the genetic testing space are aiming to empower individuals and build communities in order to boost research and, ultimately, public health. On Cyber Monday 2018, Veritas Genetics made a bold offer: the company would sequence a thousand customers’ entire genomes for $199 dollars, a fraction of the test’s usual $999 price tag. The $199 whole-genome sequences sold out in 6 hours, says Veritas’ Vice President of Clinical Affairs Birgit Funke. Sales of DNA kits have been growing exponentially since mid-2016. 2017 was a record-shattering year. Many companies have not released 2018 numbers yet, but 2018 likely broke records again. A February 2019 article in MIT Technology Review estimated that over 26 million people have taken home DNA tests. However, many are frustrated with the leading direct-to-consumer genetic testing companies. Just two companies, Ancestry and 23andMe, are responsible for the lion’s share of sales. Both have amassed vast troves of consumers’ genetic data, and both have drawn criticism for selling customers’ data to other companies. Critics have also raised concerns about data privacy. “I think the current environment is both an opportunity and a challenge,” says LunaPBC founder and president Dawn Barry. “It seems that almost every week, there’s a headline on data being sold or abused or just taken without explicit consent or awareness of individuals...it’s also important to recognize that the reason these challenges are happening is because that [genomic and health] data has value.” The market’s growth has launched a new wave of startups. Many of these newer companies work to create interfaces between clinics, researchers, and the individuals being sequenced. Others specialize in organizing data. In this Analysis, Cell speaks with leaders from relatively new companies about emerging trends in the field. One sticking point in DNA testing is the debate about who can and cannot profit from the data. Genetic data are immensely valuable to researchers in both academia and industry. But in most cases, when companies sell genetic data to third parties, the people who were sequenced receive no compensation. That state of affairs didn’t sit well with Barry, who was then a vice president at Illumina. “We spent a lot of time at Illumina making genomic data cheaper, faster, better, only to see it locked up in different siloes,” she says. Barry and several like-minded colleagues decided to form a new company and launch a data-sharing platform that compensates users. LunaPBC’s platform, called LunaDNA, entered its soft launch phase in December 2018. LunaDNA doesn’t offer sequencing or genotyping services, but it enables users to add their existing genetic and health data to a secure system. In exchange, LunaDNA’s “data sharers” receive stocks in LunaDNA as compensation. Establishing this system required special permission from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However, the company’s focus is on sharing data as a community for the public good. “LunaDNA was formed to really reshape research by putting individuals at the center and [giving] them a platform to empower sharing of health data [for discovery],” Barry says. Eventually, LunaDNA will include a portal that will allow researchers to search the aggregated, de-identified data on the platform. They will then be able to request permission to use the data from individual data sharers who have opted into receiving data-access requests. Startup Nebula Genomics also addresses the lack of compensation for data contributors. The company considers its users “data owners” and helps them interface with researchers. “We're giving people property rights, essentially, over their data,” says Nebula CEO and co-founder Kamal Obbad. Like LunaDNA, Nebula operates as an online platform. It also enables researchers to search for particular types of data and offer to pay individuals for data access. “People are able to approve or reject a request for data access,” says Obbad. “So, for example, if someone [like a researcher] wants to access data, they can say why they want to access it and how they want to use it. And how much they're willing to pay.” Managing data and access requests requires ledgers that track the data added to the system. “We need to have transparency, we need to give people control, and we need to obviously have a ledger system to keep track of what they’re bringing to the system and the value created and distributed in the system,” says Barry. Blockchain fit the bill. Though most famously used for cryptocurrency, blockchain is simply a digital ledger system that can be used in many contexts. It consists of digital data “blocks,” which each contain a unique identifying code, a snippet of data, and a time stamp. Once created, the blocks can’t be edited or overwritten, but new “blocks” can be added to the chain. Both Nebula Genomics and LunaDNA use blockchain to track data and access requests. Both companies de-identify and encrypt the data. In Nebula’s case, the blockchain doesn’t contain any of the genetic data itself. Instead, it points toward the virtual location where researchers can contact the individuals or biobanks who own the data. “If someone wants to access their genomic data we're collecting, the only way to do it is to go through this publicly readable blockchain,” Obbad explains. “Anyone who is storing data with Nebula can read and look at the blockchain to see when data requests are being sent.” Nebula launched its portal for data owners in 2018. Their current goal is growing their userbase. The company also allows biobanks, including for-profit biobanks seeking to monetize their data, to act as data owners on the platform. “Nebula is trying to provide a, create a community of stakeholders,” Obbad says. “I think a lot of people like the idea of making money off your genome, but also [they enjoy] actively participating in the research.” Though online portals for sharing and monetizing data are a relatively new development, some things never change. Obbad says that the most common question Nebula users ask is “I forgot my password. How do I change it?” While companies like Ancestry and 23andMe market their products directly to consumers, some newer companies are taking a more cautious approach. Veritas Genetics, a whole-genome sequencing company founded by prolific biotechnologist George Church (who also co-founded Nebula Genomics), allows healthy consumers to request DNA testing but requires physician approval. Funke calls this approach “direct-access testing” and says it’s distinct from direct-to-consumer testing. “Veritas is a traditional clinical laboratory...with one small difference, which is that we allow the consumer to initiate the order,” she says. Requiring physician approval allows Veritas to keep their customers’ doctors “in the loop” in accordance with guidelines for clinical tests. It also ensures that people being sequenced have guidance on how to interpret their results. Population health company Color’s approach is even more aligned with traditional clinical testing. Color allows large companies to offer DNA testing as a benefit to employees. Famous employers, such as NVIDIA and Levi Strauss, have signed on. Crucially, these companies cannot initiate tests and aren’t privy to the results. The employees can request the tests on their own, though doctors’ approval is required, or the clinicians may initiate the tests the way they would for any other clinical test. Color CEO and founder Othman Laraki sees Color not as a genetic testing company but as a population health company. “We're really not in the trying-to-sell-genetics business; we're in the population health business,” he says. “Genetics is a technology and a tool and a building block, but it's not the product or the service.” He launched Color in 2013 with the goal of making clinical-grade genomic data more affordable and more accessible. “What we've discovered is that inconvenience was equally as prohibitive as cost,” says Laraki. “Especially if you're an hourly wage worker...you're not going to go to five doctor's appointments to get tested.” Color found that when companies offer genetic testing as a benefit, employees often opt in. “It’s something that companies are very proud to do for their employees,” Laraki says. “And that, I think, ends up being worth more to them than the money saved.” In 2013, 23andMe got into hot water with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) over health claims in customers’ DNA reports. Many experts thought the science behind the claims was still too uncertain and worried that reporting disease risks might cause consumers to take drastic steps, such as unnecessary surgeries. In 2015, the FDA granted approval for 23andMe to include health risk assessments in its reports, but the 2013 “cease and desist” letter had a chilling effect on DNA startups. Many direct-to-consumer genotyping companies still focus on “infotainment” questions about ancestry and non-medical traits. However, many customers still have an appetite for more detailed and in-depth genetic information. “At this point, many people have played around with consumer genomic products, and I think that many of them are not satisfied with the limited content,” says Funke. Companies like Veritas are very selective about which genetic variants they report to customers. Variants in some genes strongly predispose carriers to certain diseases, but there are many more variants that only subtly increase the chances of getting the disease. Funke says that it’s crucial for genomics reports to be clear about which genes are which. Funke’s team makes judgement calls on what to report based on recommendations from professional medical organizations. As a clinically trained lab director herself, she applies the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG)’s guidelines on “secondary” findings. These guidelines highlight a set of genes that are strongly linked to treatable diseases. Because patients and clinicians can take action to address these diseases, the guidelines say these variants should be reported to the person carrying them, even if they’re not sick yet. Overall, the list of genes Veritas currently reports is relatively short, Funke says. But as new information about genetic risks becomes available, she hopes to implement regular updates to engage customers over time. Color’s strategy for choosing which genes to report is based on the CDC’s list of “tier 1” genomic conditions. Though Color’s tests include a low-pass whole-genome sequence, their reports to individuals focus on fewer than 100 genes, most of which are related to cancer or heart problems. “We put a lot of effort to make sure that we're being very rigorous and responsible about what is being covered [in the reports],” says Laraki. “I don't think it's one of these cases where more is always better.” The most popular genetic tests on the market today aren’t sequencing tests, but genotyping tests. These genotyping arrays catch specific versions of genes (called single-nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs) but may miss key mutations simply because they haven’t been seen before. “The SNP-focused tests by design can only look at variants that have already been reported. They’re known and they’re static,” Funke says. Genotyping companies can update and expand the array of genetic variants that they look for, but genome sequencing can record unknown variants. Those unknown variants can be revisited later. And as the cost of sequencing continues to fall, more and more companies are offering genome and exome sequencing to consumers. Laraki says that using whole-genome sequencing will enable accurate genetic risk estimates. He points out that most current risk scores are based on disproportionately Caucasian datasets. Estimates based on them may be less accurate for people of color. Laraki says there is “no silver bullet” for addressing this bias, but working with community partners and healthcare systems embedded in underserved populations is one key step. Startups entering a crowded market where several companies already have genetic data from millions of people sink or swim based on collaborations. Collaborations were key for Color early on, Laraki says. Initially, physicians were skeptical that a $250 genome sequence would be on par with the quality of a $2,000 clinical-grade test. But their collaboration with Mary-Claire King, the discoverer of the BRCA1’s role in cancer, gave them credibility. Color has continued to forge innovative collaborations. They’ve teamed with local institutions such as African American churches and medical schools to boost access to genetic testing. In 2019, they announced new “DNA10K” initiative in conjunction with major hospitals in Chicago and Philadelphia. Participants will learn about their genetic risk factors, and clinicians will use the data to personalize participants’ care. Color is also part of the NIH’s All of Us Research Program, which will sequence one million genomes. These projects use genomic data, but there are also many collaborations that leverage genotyping data. LunaDNA has teamed with an advocacy group called the Genetic Alliance that supports communities of people with genetic diseases and disabilities. The Genetic Alliance’s PEER platform, a repository of genetic and health data, will merge with LunaDNA in the coming months. It already includes data from almost 50,000 people. Barry says that LunaDNA combined with PEER will give communities a way to organize around research questions they’d like to see pursued. “We believe in the future that any community should be able to form under a research question,” Barry says. Though the companies Cell spoke to for this Analysis have distinctive strategies and philosophies, they share an emphasis on empowering individuals and building communities. This new wave of companies that organize and generate DNA data focuses on health and research questions rather than “infotainment” questions about ancestry and identity."

Forkhead-associated (FHA) and von Willebrand type A (vWA) domains are involved in several phosphorylation-dependent processes of multiprotein complex assemblies. Although well-studied in eukaryotes and bacteria, the structural and functional contexts of these domains are not yet understood in Archaea. Here, we report the structural base for such an interacting pair of FHA and vWA domain-containing proteins, ArnA and ArnB, in the thermoacidophilic archaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, where they act synergistically and negatively modulate motility. The structure of the FHA domain of ArnA at 1.75 Å resolution revealed that it belongs to the subclass of FHA domains, which recognizes double-pSer/pThr motifs. We also solved the 1.5 Å resolution crystal structure of the ArnB paralog vWA2, disclosing a complex topology comprising the vWA domain, a β-sandwich fold, and a C-terminal helix bundle. We further show that ArnA binds to the C terminus of ArnB, which harbors all the phosphorylation sites identified to date and is important for the function of ArnB in archaellum regulation. We also observed that expression levels of the archaellum components in response to changes in nutrient conditions are independent of changes in ArnA and ArnB levels and that a strong interaction between ArnA and ArnB observed during growth on rich medium sequentially diminishes after nutrient limitation. In summary, our findings unravel the structural features in ArnA and ArnB important for their interaction and functional archaellum expression and reveal how nutrient conditions affect this interaction.

https://openalex.org/W2923975245,"Current literature presents conflicting findings concerning the effect of religiosity on attitudes towards redistribution. This paper attempts to reconcile these findings by arguing that the belief and social behavior dimensions of religiosity affect support for redistribution via different mechanisms, and that these effects are moderated by state welfare generosity. Using multilevel path analysis models on data from the World Values Survey, we show that the effect of the religious belief on attitudes towards redistribution is mediated by competing personal orientations-prosocial values and conservative identification-while the religious social behavior dimension significantly decreases support for redistribution via increased levels of happiness. Lower levels of welfare generosity increase the positive effect of prosocial orientations and weaken the negative effect conservative identification, leading to positive or null indirect effect of religiosity. These findings show the importance of taking into account the multiple dimensions of religiosity and institutional context when studying the relationship between religion and redistribution attitudes."

Studying the correlations among multiple diseases provides an important avenue to better understand the common genetic background of diseases and to help develop new drugs that can treat multiple diseases. Meanwhile, network science has seen increasing applications on modeling complex biological systems, and can be a powerful tool to elucidate the correlations of multiple human diseases. In this article, known disease-gene associations were represented using a weighted bipartite network. We extracted a weighted human diseases network from such a bipartite network to show the correlations of diseases. Subsequently, we proposed a new centrality measurement for the weighted human disease network (WHDN) in order to quantify the importance of diseases. Using our centrality measurement to quantify the importance of vertices in WHDN, we were able to find a set of most central diseases. By investigating the 30 top diseases and their most correlated neighbors in the network, we identified disease linkages including known disease pairs and novel findings. Our research helps better understand the common genetic origin of human diseases and suggests top diseases that likely induce other related diseases."

An inorganic material has properties consistent with these predictions, revealing details about the nature of quantum matter. See Letter p.559 There are only a handful of candidate quantum spin liquids—exotic states of matter that are ideal for the study of the fundamental nature of quantum matter—so experimental observations of quantum spin liquid behaviour are scarce. Jun Zhao and colleagues use inelastic neutron scattering to study a single crystal of YbMgGaO4, which has a perfect triangular lattice. They find a spin excitation continuum across a large region of the Brillouin zone that persists at near-zero temperatures, providing evidence for a quantum spin liquid state with a spinon Fermi surface. The authors suggest that YbMgGaO4 fits the criteria for a perfect spin-1/2 triangular lattice antiferromagnet, as originally proposed by Philip Anderson in 1973."
https://openalex.org/W2564964002,"Cage-like structures can self-assemble from suitable metal ions and organic linkers, but the size of the assemblies was limited. The surprise discovery of a new series of cages opens up fresh horizons for self-assembly. See Letter p.563 Rational control of self-assembly remains a formidable challenge. It is thought to become increasingly difficult, even impossible, as the number of individual constituents increases. For example, no one has ever been able to design discrete molecules that self-assemble from more than 100 components. When exploring design principles appropriate for dealing with the self-assembly of large numbers of components, Daishi Fujita et al. discovered a spherical structure with a topology not previously reported at the molecular level. Using mathematics describing this class of structures, the authors then targeted and characterized an even larger structure containing 48 palladium ions coordinated by 96 bent organic ligands—by far the largest number of components observed in a self-assembled molecular structure to date. The structure has the topology of a tetravalent Goldberg polyhedron, a type of convex polyhedron made from squares and triangles—a twist on the original Goldberg polyhedra that were first described by Michael Goldberg in 1937."
