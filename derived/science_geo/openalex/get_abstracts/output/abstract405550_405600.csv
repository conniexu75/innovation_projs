Mitochondrial division is regulated by Dnm1/Drp1, a dynamin-related protein that forms helices around mitochondria to mediate fission. Little is known about what determines sites of mitochondrial fission within the mitochondrial network. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria exhibit tightly coupled dynamics and have extensive contacts. We tested whether ER plays a role in mitochondrial division. We found that mitochondrial division occurred at positions where ER tubules contacted mitochondria and mediated constriction before Drp1 recruitment. Thus, ER tubules may play an active role in defining the position of mitochondrial division sites."

The cells that compose the epithelial stem cell niche for skin homeostasis and regeneration are not well defined. Here, we identify adipose precursor cells within the skin and demonstrate that their dynamic regeneration parallels the activation of skin stem cells. Functional analysis of adipocyte lineage cells in mice with defects in adipogenesis and in transplantation experiments revealed that intradermal adipocyte lineage cells are necessary and sufficient to drive follicular stem cell activation. Furthermore, we implicate PDGF expression by immature adipocyte cells in the regulation of follicular stem cell activity. These data highlight adipogenic cells as skin niche cells that positively regulate skin stem cell activity, and suggest that adipocyte lineage cells may alter epithelial stem cell function clinically.

Resident skin adipocytes regenerate de novo in parallel with the hair cycle Immature adipocytes are necessary and sufficient for hair follicle regeneration Immature adipocytes express PDGF ligands to promote hair regeneration Tissue niches are essential for controlling stem cell self-renewal and differentiation (Voog and Jones, 2010Voog J. Jones D. Stem cells and the niche: a dynamic duo.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 6: 103-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Epithelial lineages in the skin are maintained by stem cells that exist in multiple tissue microenvironments (Blanpain and Fuchs, 2006Blanpain C. Fuchs E. Epidermal stem cells of the skin.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 339-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). In particular, the niche for hair follicle stem cells, which reside within the bulge region of the hair follicle, promotes continual and repetitive regeneration of the follicle during the hair cycle. Specialized mesenchymal cells, the dermal papillae (DP), that are associated with the hair follicle can specify epithelial identity, and are thought to control follicular stem cell activity by releasing signaling molecules (Blanpain and Fuchs, 2006Blanpain C.

Extrinsic signals, such as bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), platelet derived growth factors (PDGFs) and Wnts can activate stem cell activity in the hair follicle (Blanpain and Fuchs, 2006Blanpain C.

Yet, it remains unclear which cells establish the skin stem cell niche. Multiple changes within the skin occur during the hair follicle's regenerative cycle (Blanpain and Fuchs, 2006Blanpain C. Fuchs E. Epidermal stem cells of the skin.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 339-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Following hair follicle morphogenesis (growth phase, anagen), the active portion of the follicle regresses (death phase, catagen), leaving the bulge region with a small hair germ that remains dormant during the resting phase (telogen) (Greco et al., 2009Greco V. Chen T. Rendl M. Schober M. Pasolli H. Stokes N. Dela Cruz-Racelis J. Fuchs E. A two-step mechanism for stem cell activation during hair regeneration.Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 155-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Anagen induction in the next hair cycle is associated with bulge cell migration and proliferation in the hair germ to generate the highly proliferative cells at the base of the follicle (Greco et al., 2009Greco V. Chen T. Rendl M. Schober M. Pasolli H. Stokes N. Dela Cruz-Racelis J. Fuchs E.

The activated stem cells then differentiate to form the inner root sheath and hair shaft for the new hair follicle. During activation of hair growth, the expansion of the intradermal adipocyte layer in the skin doubles the skin's thickness (Butcher, 1934Butcher E.O. The hair cycles in the albino rat.Anat.

While adipocyte hypertrophy involves lipogenesis, adipogenesis requires the proliferation and specification of adipocyte precursor cells into preadipocytes, which exit from the cell cycle and differentiate into mature, lipid-laden adipocytes (Rodeheffer et al., 2008Rodeheffer M.

Adipogenesis requires the upregulation and transcriptional activity of the nuclear receptor, PPARÎ³ in preadipoctyes (Rosen and Spiegelman, 2000Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M.

Whether intradermal adipocytes undergo hypertrophy and/or adipogenesis during the hair cycle is unknown. Recent data shows that during the hair cycle, mature intradermal adipocytes express BMP2 mRNA (Plikus et al., 2008Plikus M. Mayer J. de la Cruz D. Baker R. Maini P. Maxson R. Chuong C. Cyclic dermal BMP signalling regulates stem cell activation during hair regeneration.Nature. 2008; 451: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), an inhibitory signal for bulge cell activity (Blanpain and Fuchs, 2006Blanpain C.

In addition, reduced intradermal adipose tissue in transgenic mice overexpressing human apolipoprotein C-I in the skin (Jong et al., 1998Jong M.C. Gijbels M.J. Dahlmans V.E. Gorp P.J. Koopman S.J. Ponec M. Hofker M.H. Havekes L.M. Hyperlipidemia and cutaneous abnormalities in transgenic mice overexpressing human apolipoprotein C1.J. Clin.

Lipopenia and skin barrier abnormalities in DGAT2-deficient mice.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11767-11776Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) results in abnormalities in skin structure and function such as hair loss, epidermal hyperplasia, and abnormal sebaceous gland function. While these data suggest a regulatory role for adipocytes in the skin, these mutations affect multiple cell types in the skin. Thus, the precise role of intradermal adipocytes in skin biology remains unclear. In this study, we analyze the role of intradermal adipocytes on follicular stem cell activity. Using histological and functional analysis of cell populations of the adipocyte lineage in the skin, we identify a dynamic process of adipogenesis that parallels the activation of hair follicle stem cells. Functional analysis of adipocyte lineage cells in mice with defects in adipogenesis and in transplantation experiments revealed that immature adipocyte cells are necessary and sufficient to drive follicular stem cell activation. Finally, we implicate PDGF signals produced by immature intradermal adipocyte lineage cells in controlling hair regeneration. These data define active roles for intradermal adipocytes in the regulation of the skin tissue microenvironment. To determine whether changes in individual adipocyte cell size contributes to growth of the intradermal adipocyte layer during the hair cycle (Butcher, 1934Butcher E.O. The hair cycles in the albino rat.Anat. Rec. 1934; 61: 5-19Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar, Chase et al., 1953Chase H. Montagna W. Malone J.

The influence of the hair cycle on the thickness of mouse skin.Anat. Rec. 1984; 210: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar; Figures S1A and S1B ), we analyzed individual adipocytes during the hair follicle cycle by immunostaining skin sections with antibodies against caveolin 1A, which is enriched on the cell surface of mature adipocytes (Le Lay et al., 2010Le Lay S. Briand N. Blouin C. Chateau D. Prado C. Lasnier F. Le Liepvre X. Hajduch E. Dugail I. The lipoatrophic caveolin-1 deficient mouse model reveals autophagy in mature adipocytes.Autophagy. 2010; 6: 754-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and a fluorescent neutral lipid dye, Lipidtox. Morphometric analyses of individual caveolin+, Lipidtox+ cells quantified the cross-sectional area (XSA) of intradermal adipocytes. Adipocytes progressively increased in size following morphogenesis of the hair follicle (P4âP15) (Figures 1A and Figure S1C). Following catagen, intradermal adipocyte XSA decreased to the area of adipocytes during morphogenesis. Thus, intradermal adipose tissue growth during follicle maturation occurs at least in part by hypertrophy of mature adipocytes.Figure 1Intradermal Adipocytes Regenerate via a Proliferative Precursor Cell during the Hair CycleShow full caption(A) Histogram plot of the size distribution of Lipidtox+/caveolin+ cells during the hair cycle. n = 80â100 cells from three to four mice for each hair cycle stage.

To determine whether anagen induction is associated with changes in intradermal adipocytes, we analyzed intradermal adipose tissue during the second hair cycle when anagen activation is slower than the first hair cycle. At P49 when the follicles are in the second telogen, small intradermal adipocytes exist below the dermis distant from the follicles (Figure 1B). At P56, activation of follicular stem cells is initiated in some follicles, as indicated by an enlarged hair germ. The activated follicles are in close proximity to small caveolin+, Lipidtox+ cells that extend from adipose layer toward the growing hair follicle (Figure 1B), suggesting that follicular stem cell activation is associated with changes in the intradermal adipocytes. To analyze if de novo formation of intradermal adipocytes occurs through a proliferative precursor cell during the hair cycle, we determined if proliferative cells expressing perilipin, which is specifically expressed on mature adipocytes (Greenberg et al., 1991Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A. Garty N.B. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Londos C. Perilipin, a major hormonally regulated adipocyte-specific phosphoprotein associated with the periphery of lipid storage droplets.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11341-11346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), exist in the skin during the hair cycle by pulsing mice for 3 days with BrdU during different stages of the hair cycle (Figure 1C). When mice were pulsed with BrdU before the first telogen (P18âP21), no BrdU positive nuclei were detected within perilipin+ adipocytes. In contrast, when mice were pulsed with BrdU following anagen induction from P21âP24, BrdU positive nuclei were located within perilipin+ cellular membranes (Figure 1C). We further analyzed de novo adipocyte formation by examining BrdU incorporation within the nuclei of mature adipocytes (Figure 1C), which were enriched from dermal tissue via enzymatic dissociation and differential centrifugation. Microscopic analysis of isolated cells and analysis of the expression of adipocyte specific mRNAs by real time PCR confirmed the enrichment of mature adipocytes using this isolation procedure (Figure S1D). FACS analysis of BrdU staining in isolated nuclei from mature adipocytes revealed that when 3 day BrdU pulses were performed during the initiation of anagen, 10% of mature adipocyte nuclei exhibited BrdU localization. In contrast, less than 2% of BrdU+ nuclei were detected when mice were pulsed before anagen induction (Figure 1C). Taken together, these data demonstrate that intradermal adipocytes regenerate through a proliferative precursor during anagen induction. Adipocyte precursor cells were recently identified in visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue depots (Rodeheffer et al., 2008Rodeheffer M. Birsoy K. Friedman J. Identification of white adipocyte progenitor cells in vivo.Cell. 2008; 135: 240-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar; Figure S2A ). To determine if adipocyte precursor cells exist in the skin, we isolated stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells from the skin dermis at P21, when anagen is induced during the first hair cycle. Similar to visceral adipose tissue, adipocyte precursor cells (Lin-, CD34+, CD29+, Sca1+) are present within skin tissue (Figure 2A and Figure S2A). To confirm skin-derived adipocyte precursor cells are functional, we cultured FACS-purified adipocyte precursor cells from the skin. After 3 days of culture, skin-derived adipocyte precursor cells form robust adipocytes, as seen by Oil Red O staining (Figure S2B). In addition, adipocyte precursor cells were able to form caveolin+, Lipidtox+ cells when injected into the intradermal muscle layer of syngeneic mice (Figure S2B). Thus, functional adipocyte precursor cells reside in the skin.Figure 2Resident Skin Adipocyte Precursor Cells Display Dynamic Activity Associated with the Hair CycleShow full caption(A) Representative FACS plots of Sca1+, CD24+/â adipogenic cells within the CD31/CD45 negative (Lin-), CD34+, and CD29+ gated cell populations in subcutaneous adipose tissue or P21 skin.(B) Representative FACS plots of adipocyte precursor cells from skin in catagen (P18) or early anagen (P22).(C) Graphs quantify the % of adipogenic cells and the % of BrdU+ adipogenic cells within the Lin-, CD29+, and CD34+ cell population at P18 (catagen), P22 (initial anagen) or P25 (mid-anagen).(D) Real-time PCR analysis of PPARÎ³ mRNA expression in P21 adipogenic cells and mature intradermal adipocytes compared to total isolated stromal vascular fraction (SVF) in the skin. n = three independently isolated cell populations.All data are Â± SEM, âp < 0.05.

All data are Â± SEM, âp < 0.05. See also Figure S2. To analyze the number and proliferation of adipocyte precursor cells during the hair cycle, we pulsed mice with BrdU for 3 days during catagen (P15âP18), anagen initiation (P19âP22) or mature anagen (P22âP25), and analyzed the percentage of adipocyte precursor cells. Few adipocyte precursor cells exist in the skin during catagen (Figures 2B and 2C). In contrast, the percentage of adipocyte precursor cells in the CD34+ SVF cell population increased â¼4-fold during anagen induction (Figures 2B and 2C) and returned to baseline during maturation of the hair follicle at P25. Therefore, adipocyte precursor cell number peaks in the skin during follicular stem cell activation. Analysis of BrdU incorporation within adipocyte precursor cells revealed that prior to anagen â¼50% of adipocyte precursor cells are proliferating. However, once anagen was initiated, the percentage of proliferative adipogenic cells was reduced to â¼25% (Figure 2C). Thus, adipocyte precursor cells are stimulated to proliferate during late catagen to generate an increased population of adipogenic cells during anagen induction. These data correlate with the timing of de novo adipocyte generation after anagen induction (Figure 1C). To further characterize adipocyte precursor cells in the skin, we analyzed the mRNA expression of the adipogenic transcription factor, PPARÎ³. We find that when compared to expression within SVF cells, PPARÎ³ is enriched in adipocyte precursors and expressed at â¼25% of the mRNA levels of mature intradermal adipocytes (Figure 2D). These data confirm the adipogenic nature of resident intradermal adipocyte precursor cells. To define the function of intradermal adipocyte lineage cells during hair follicle regeneration, we analyzed mouse skin prior to and during hair regeneration at P21 in two separate mouse models with genetic mutations that affect adipogenesis (Figure S3A ), or of wild-type mice after pharmacological treatments that affect adipocyte lineage cells (Figure S5). In one genetic model, mice lacking Early B cell factor 1 (Ebf1â/â) display a decrease in postnatal intradermal adipose tissue (Hesslein et al., 2009Hesslein D. Fretz J. Xi Y. Nelson T. Zhou S. Lorenzo J. Schatz D. Horowitz M. Ebf1-dependent control of the osteoblast and adipocyte lineages.Bone. 2009; 44: 537-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar; Figure S3A). Analysis of Ebf1 mRNA expression using in situ hybridization revealed that Ebf1 is expressed in the DP in mature, growing hair follicles at P4 (Rendl et al., 2005Rendl M. Lewis L. Fuchs E. Molecular dissection of mesenchymal-epithelial interactions in the hair follicle.PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e331Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar); however, bulge, hair germ, and DP cells lack Ebf1 expression during the initiation of a new anagen during the hair cycle (Figure S3B), when adipogenesis is active. This expression pattern was confirmed by real time PCR on isolated DP cells and epithelial cells (Figure S3C). In another genetic model, the lipoatrophic âfatlessâ Azip/F1 mouse, mature white adipocytes are lacking throughout the animal, including the skin (Figure S3A), due to the expression of a flag-epitope tagged, dominant-negative form of C/EBP under the control of the aP2 promoter, which normally drives expression of Fatty Acid Binding Protein-4 (FABP4) late in adipogenesis (Moitra et al., 1998Moitra J. Mason M. Olive M. Krylov D. Gavrilova O. Marcus-Samuels B. Feigenbaum L. Lee E. Aoyama T. Eckhaus M. et al.Life without white fat: a transgenic mouse.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3168-3181Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Immunostaining for the Flag epitope expressed within the Azip transgene detected expression of Flag+ cells within the immature subcutaneous adipose depot below the skin of Azip mice but not within the skin epithelium of Azip mice (Figure S3D). The lack of Flag+ cells in the intradermal adipose depot of Azip skin suggests that aborted mature adipocytes do not persist in the skin of Azip mice. While both Azip and Ebf1â/â mice displayed delayed hair coat formation (to be reported elsewhere), these defects are absent after P15, and catagen proceeded normally in both Azip and Ebf1â/â mice (Figure S4A ). Both Azip and Ebf1 null mice display normal epidermal and sebaceous gland proliferation at P21 (Figure S4B) and sebaceous gland size in Azip and Ebf1â/â skin was similar to WT at P21 (Figure S4C). Furthermore, Azip and Ebf1â/â mice displayed normal DP morphology and T cell numbers (Figures S4D and S4E). These data suggest that these mutant mice do not display any overt changes of nonadipocyte lineage cells within the skin prior to P21. We next examined the adipocyte lineage in these mutant mice. Using FACS, we find that adipocyte precursors are absent in Ebf1â/â skin but slightly elevated in Azip skin (Figure 3A ). To analyze adipocyte precursor activity in Azip and Ebf1 null mice, we defined proliferation within the intradermal adipocytes following 3 days of BrdU injections after P21 (Figure 3B). Due to the lack of mature adipocytes in Azip skin, we analyzed putative adipocytes in the dermis based on their elevated expression of caveolin 1A. Both WT and Azip mice displayed BrdU+, caveolin+ cells surrounding hair follicles (Figure 3B). However, Ebf1 null mice lacked proliferative, caveolin+ cells within the dermis. Similarly, the dermis of WT and Azip mice was filled with PPARÎ³+ cells, while the dermis of Ebf1â/â mice exhibited few PPARÎ³+ cells (Figure 3C). These data suggest that adipocyte precursor cells are able to proliferate and differentiate into highly expressing PPARÎ³+ preadipocytes in the dermis of WT and Azip mice, but these early adipogenic events are absent within the skin of Ebf1â/â mice. In addition to these genetic models that diminish adiposity in the skin, we treated mice with PPARÎ³ antagonists, bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) and GW9662 (Bendixen et al., 2001Bendixen A.C.

https://openalex.org/W2025159391,"Both obesity and being underweight have been associated with increased mortality. Underweight, defined as a body mass index (BMI) â¤ 18.5 kg per m(2) in adults and â¤ -2 standard deviations from the mean in children, is the main sign of a series of heterogeneous clinical conditions including failure to thrive, feeding and eating disorder and/or anorexia nervosa. In contrast to obesity, few genetic variants underlying these clinical conditions have been reported. We previously showed that hemizygosity of a â¼600-kilobase (kb) region on the short arm of chromosome 16 causes a highly penetrant form of obesity that is often associated with hyperphagia and intellectual disabilities. Here we show that the corresponding reciprocal duplication is associated with being underweight. We identified 138 duplication carriers (including 132 novel cases and 108 unrelated carriers) from individuals clinically referred for developmental or intellectual disabilities (DD/ID) or psychiatric disorders, or recruited from population-based cohorts. These carriers show significantly reduced postnatal weight and BMI. Half of the boys younger than five years are underweight with a probable diagnosis of failure to thrive, whereas adult duplication carriers have an 8.3-fold increased risk of being clinically underweight. We observe a trend towards increased severity in males, as well as a depletion of male carriers among non-medically ascertained cases. These features are associated with an unusually high frequency of selective and restrictive eating behaviours and a significant reduction in head circumference. Each of the observed phenotypes is the converse of one reported in carriers of deletions at this locus. The phenotypes correlate with changes in transcript levels for genes mapping within the duplication but not in flanking regions. The reciprocal impact of these 16p11.2 copy-number variants indicates that severe obesity and being underweight could have mirror aetiologies, possibly through contrasting effects on energy balance."

https://openalex.org/W2008223253,"Quiescence is required for the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Members of the Cip/Kip family of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors (p21, p27, p57) have been implicated in HSC quiescence, but loss of p21 or p27 in mice affects HSC quiescence or functionality only under conditions of stress. Although p57 is the most abundant family member in quiescent HSCs, its role has remained uncharacterized. Here we show a severe defect in the self-renewal capacity of p57-deficient HSCs and a reduction of the proportion of the cells in G(0) phase. Additional ablation of p21 in a p57-null background resulted in a further decrease in the colony-forming activity of HSCs. Moreover, the HSC abnormalities of p57-deficient mice were corrected by knocking in the p27 gene at the p57 locus. Our results therefore suggest that, among Cip/Kip family CDK inhibitors, p57 plays a predominant role in the quiescence and maintenance of adult HSCs."

We report that ÎF508-CFTR surface expression can be rescued in vitro and in vivo by directing it to an unconventional GRASP-dependent secretion pathway. An integrated molecular and physiological analysis indicates that mechanisms associated with ER stress induce cell surface trafficking of the ER core-glycosylated wild-type and ÎF508-CFTR via the GRASP-dependent pathway. Phosphorylation of a specific site of GRASP and the PDZ-based interaction between GRASP and CFTR are critical for this unconventional surface trafficking. Remarkably, transgenic expression of GRASP in ÎF508-CFTR mice restores CFTR function and rescues mouse survival without apparent toxicity. These findings provide insight into how unconventional protein secretion is activated, and offer a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cystic fibrosis and perhaps diseases stemming from other misfolded proteins."

In this study, we report that cell cycle entry proceeded normally in HSCs null for cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p57 due to compensatory upregulation of p27. HSCs null for both p57 and p27, however, were more proliferative and had reduced capacity to engraft in transplantation. We found that heat shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70) interacts with both p57 and p27 and that the subcellular localization of Hsc70 was critical to maintain HSC cell cycle kinetics. Combined deficiency of p57 and p27 in HSCs resulted in nuclear import of an Hsc70/cyclin D1 complex, concomitant with Rb phosphorylation, and elicited severe defects in maintaining HSC quiescence. Taken together, these data suggest that regulation of cytoplasmic localization of Hsc70/cyclin D1 complex by p57 and p27 is a key intracellular mechanism in controlling HSC dormancy."
https://openalex.org/W2104683328,"<h2>Summary</h2> AKT activation is associated with many malignancies, where AKT acts, in part, by inhibiting FOXO tumor suppressors. We show a converse role for AKT/FOXOs in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Rather than decreased FOXO activity, we observed that FOXOs are active in â¼40% of AML patient samples regardless of genetic subtype. We also observe this activity in human MLL-AF9 leukemia allele-induced AML in mice, where either activation of Akt or compound deletion of <i>FoxO1/3/4</i> reduced leukemic cell growth, with the latter markedly diminishing leukemia-initiating cell (LIC) function in vivo and improving animal survival. FOXO inhibition resulted in myeloid maturation and subsequent AML cell death. FOXO activation inversely correlated with JNK/c-JUN signaling, and leukemic cells resistant to FOXO inhibition responded to JNK inhibition. These data reveal a molecular role for AKT/FOXO and JNK/c-JUN in maintaining a differentiation blockade that can be targeted to inhibit leukemias with a range of genetic lesions. <h3>PaperClip</h3>"

We present the crystal structure of an autoinhibited full-length human CaMKII holoenzyme, revealing an unexpected compact arrangement of kinase domains docked against a central hub, with the calmodulin-binding sites completely inaccessible. We show that this compact docking is important for the autoinhibition of the kinase domains and for setting the calcium response of the holoenzyme. Comparison of CaMKII isoforms, which differ in the length of the linker between the kinase domain and the hub, demonstrates that these interactions can be strengthened or weakened by changes in linker length. This equilibrium between autoinhibited states provides a simple mechanism for tuning the calcium response without changes in either the hub or the kinase domains."

https://openalex.org/W2101367152,"Using mouse skin, where bountiful reservoirs of synchronized hair follicle stem cells (HF-SCs) fuel cycles of regeneration, we explore how adult SCs remodel chromatin in response to activating cues. By profiling global mRNA and chromatin changes in quiescent and activated HF-SCs and their committed, transit-amplifying (TA) progeny, we show that polycomb-group (PcG)-mediated H3K27-trimethylation features prominently in HF-lineage progression by mechanisms distinct from embryonic-SCs. In HF-SCs, PcG represses nonskin lineages and HF differentiation. In TA progeny, nonskin regulators remain PcG-repressed, HF-SC regulators acquire H3K27me3-marks, and HF-lineage regulators lose them. Interestingly, genes poised in embryonic stem cells, active in HF-SCs, and PcG-repressed in TA progeny encode not only key transcription factors, but also signaling regulators. We document their importance in balancing HF-SC quiescence, underscoring the power of chromatin mapping in dissecting SC behavior. Our findings explain how HF-SCs cycle through quiescent and activated states without losing stemness and define roles for PcG-mediated repression in governing a fate switch irreversibly."

All Class I PTPs contain an essential active site cysteinyl residue, which executes a nucleophilic attack on substrate phosphotyrosyl residues. The high reactivity of the catalytic cysteine also predisposes PTPs to oxidation by reactive oxygen species, such as H2O2. Reversible PTP oxidation is emerging as an important cellular regulatory mechanism and might contribute to diseases such as cancer. We exploited these unique features of PTP enzymology to develop proteomic methods, broadly applicable to cell and tissue samples, that enable the comprehensive identification and quantification of expressed classical PTPs (PTPome) and the oxidized subset of the PTPome (oxPTPome).

In this context, TAF3 is required for endoderm lineage differentiation and prevents premature specification of neuroectoderm and mesoderm. In addition to its role in the core promoter recognition complex TFIID, genome-wide binding studies reveal that TAF3 localizes to a subset of chromosomal regions bound by CTCF/cohesin that are selectively associated with genes upregulated by TAF3. Notably, CTCF directly recruits TAF3 to promoter distal sites and TAF3-dependent DNA looping is observed between the promoter distal sites and core promoters occupied by TAF3/CTCF/cohesin.

Using a joint experimental-theoretical approach, we unravel the mechanism underlying this shift of the phyA action peak from red to far-red light and show that it relies on specific molecular interactions rather than on intrinsic changes to phyA's spectral properties. According to our model, the dissociation rate of the phyA-FHY1/FHL nuclear import complex is a principle determinant of the phyA action peak.

Constitutively active phyA does not accumulate in the nucleus Cycling between the active and inactive state is essential for phyA signaling PhyA degradation is important for shifting responsiveness toward FR Response to FR requires coupling between two antagonistic photoconversion cycles Light is an abiotic factor, which is particularly important for plants. It is used as a source of energy but also provides information about the environment. To monitor the intensity, quality, and direction of incident light, plants employ different types of photoreceptors, such as the phototropins and cryptochromes, which are blue light (B) receptors, or the red (R)/far-red (FR) light-absorbing phytochromes (Devlin et al., 2007Devlin P.F. Christie J.M. Terry M.J. Many hands make light work.J. Exp. Bot. 2007; 58: 3071-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis, there are five phytochromes (phyA-phyE), among which phyA and phyB are most important. PhyB is the dominating phytochrome species in light-grown and adult plants and plays a role in the shade avoidance response, regulation of flowering, and de-etiolation in R. In contrast, the switch from skotomorphogenic (development in the dark) to photomorphogenic (development in light) growth in FR-enriched environments requires phyA, which accumulates to very high levels in etiolated seedlings but is rapidly degraded upon irradiation with light (Bae and Choi, 2008Bae G. Choi G. Decoding of light signals by plant phytochromes and their interacting proteins.Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2008; 59: 281-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Plant phytochromes are dimeric photoreceptors containing a covalently bound open-chain tetrapyrrole as chromophore (Rockwell et al., 2006Rockwell N.C. Su Y.S. Lagarias J.C. Phytochrome structure and signaling mechanisms.Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2006; 57: 837-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). They have a photocycle with Pr as the ground state and Pfr as a longer-lived intermediate. Pr is biologically inactive and exhibits maximal absorption in R, whereas Pfr has an absorption peak in FR and is considered the active form of phytochromes. By absorption of light, they can reversibly interconvert between Pr and Pfr via short-lived photochemical intermediates (Mancinelli, 1994Mancinelli A.L. The physiology of phytochrome action.in: Kendrick R.E. Kronenberg G.M.H. Photomorphogenesis in Plants. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht1994: 211-269Crossref Google Scholar, Rockwell et al., 2006Rockwell N.C. Su Y.S. Lagarias J.C. Phytochrome structure and signaling mechanisms.Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2006; 57: 837-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). Typically, phyB-mediated responses are induced by R and can be canceled by an FR pulse immediately following the R treatment (Casal et al., 2003Casal J.J. Luccioni L.G. Oliverio K.A. Boccalandro H.E. Light, phytochrome signalling and photomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis.Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2003; 2: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This mode of action, termed low fluence response (LFR), is consistent with a model in which phytochromes work as light switches that can be turned on and off by irradiation with R and FR. However, phyA-mediated responses are induced by very low amounts of light of any wavelength (very low fluence response [VLFR]) or by continuous irradiation with high fluence rate FR (high irradiance response [HIR]) and cannot be explained by a simple light switch (Casal et al., 2003Casal J.J. Luccioni L.G. Oliverio K.A. Boccalandro H.E. Light, phytochrome signalling and photomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis.Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2003; 2: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Although Pr and Pfr have absorption peaks at 667 nm (R) and 730 nm (FR), respectively, they absorb in FR and R as well. Thus, irradiation with either R or FR drives the conversion between Pr and Pfr in both directions. This results in continuous cycling between Pr and Pfr, which establishes the equilibrium between the two conformers depending on the wavelength, but not on the fluence rate (Mancinelli, 1994Mancinelli A.L. The physiology of phytochrome action.in: Kendrick R.E. Kronenberg G.M.H. Photomorphogenesis in Plants. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht1994: 211-269Crossref Google Scholar). PhyA localizes to the cytosol in the dark and accumulates in the nucleus in response to irradiation with FR (Bae and Choi, 2008Bae G. Choi G. Decoding of light signals by plant phytochromes and their interacting proteins.Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2008; 59: 281-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Translocation of phyA into the nucleus is indispensable for FR perception and depends on the two functional homologs FHY1 and FHL, which physically interact with phyA (Hiltbrunner et al., 2005Hiltbrunner A.

The amount of phyA accumulating in the nucleus of FR-treated seedlings exceeds the total level of FHY1 and FHL that is available in a cell by several-fold. Therefore, FHY1/FHL have been predicted to work as shuttle proteins that cycle between the cytosol and the nucleus (Genoud et al., 2008Genoud T. Schweizer F. Tscheuschler A. Debrieux D. Casal J.J. SchÃ¤fer E. Hiltbrunner A. Fankhauser C. FHY1 mediates nuclear import of the light-activated phytochrome A photoreceptor.PLoS Genet. 2008; 4: e1000143Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). PhyA is essential for de-etiolation in FR-rich environments, such as in canopy shade, and it may have provided an adaptive advantage to early angiosperms during colonization of habitats dominated by gymnosperms and ferns (Mathews, 2005Mathews S. Phytochrome evolution in green and nongreen plants.J. Hered. 2005; 96: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Although, as for any other phytochrome, the Pfr/Ptot ratio (Ptot = Pr + Pfr) is much higher in R than in FR, the action spectra for hypocotyl growth inhibition and other high irradiance responses (HIRs) exhibit a peak in the FR range of the spectrum (Figure S1 available online), which is absent in phyA mutant plants (Shinomura et al., 2000Shinomura T. Uchida K. Furuya M. Elementary processes of photoperception by phytochrome A for high-irradiance response of hypocotyl elongation in Arabidopsis.Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Several models have been proposed to explain why maximal photon efficiency is shifted toward FR despite the lower relative abundance of the active Pfr form, but none link the shift to defined components or molecular events (Hennig et al., 1999Hennig L.

Interestingly, both HIRs and efficient accumulation of phyA in the nucleus require continuous irradiation with high fluence rate FR; thus, phyA nuclear transport itself can be considered an HIR. In this work, we show that nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of FHY1/FHL plays a decisive role in phyA signaling and the HIR. Based on this finding, we develop a mathematical model for the HIR that integrates the current knowledge of phyA dynamics, nuclear transport, and interaction with FHY1/FHL. Our investigation shows that the dynamic model of the phyA interaction network intrinsically exhibits the typical features of the HIR and that the principle mechanism underlying the RâFR shift of the peak in the phyA action spectrum can be understood in simple, molecular terms. Finally, the model presented in this report also offers an explanation for the difference in spectral responsiveness of phyA and phyB despite the fact that they have identical photophysical properties. FHY1/FHL have been predicted to shuttle between the cytosol and the nucleus in order to transport more than only one phyA per FHY1/FHL (Genoud et al., 2008Genoud T. Schweizer F. Tscheuschler A. Debrieux D. Casal J.J. SchÃ¤fer E. Hiltbrunner A. Fankhauser C. FHY1 mediates nuclear import of the light-activated phytochrome A photoreceptor.PLoS Genet. 2008; 4: e1000143Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We tested this using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) assays to analyze the mobility of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-tagged FHY1 in etiolated Arabidopsis seedlings. These approaches showed that YFP-FHY1 is indeed highly mobile and moves in both directions between the cytosol and the nucleus (Figures 1A and 1B ). Interestingly, the mobility of YFP-FHY1 was strongly reduced in seedlings, which had been irradiated for 5 min with R to establish high levels of Pfr, whereas a 5 min R treatment did not affect the YFP-FHY1 mobility in the absence of phyA (Figures 1C and 1D). In FR (730 nm), only about 2% of the total phyA is in Pfr (Mancinelli, 1994Mancinelli A.L. The physiology of phytochrome action.in: Kendrick R.E. Kronenberg G.M.H. Photomorphogenesis in Plants. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht1994: 211-269Crossref Google Scholar). Nevertheless, under these conditions, seedlings accumulate high levels of phyA in the nucleus, which account for much more than only 2% of the total phyA. This suggests that, in seedlings grown in FR, the major part of phyA in the nucleus is in Pr. However, phyA C323A, which is unable to bind the chromophore and cannot be converted to Pfr (Rockwell et al., 2006Rockwell N.C. Su Y.S. Lagarias J.C. Phytochrome structure and signaling mechanisms.Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2006; 57: 837-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar) (see Supplemental Information), did not accumulate in the nucleus of phyA mutant seedlings, and in yeast two-hybrid assays, it did not interact with FHY1 (Figure 2A and Figure S2). Thus, we conclude that only Pfr can translocate from the cytosol into the nucleus and that all nuclear-localized Pr results from photoconversion of phyA, which has been transported as Pfr.Figure S2Pfr Is Essential for PhyA Nuclear Transport, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) The phyA C323A mutant is insensitive to FR.

Dark-grown seedlings expressing phyB Y276H exhibited a constitutively photomorphogenic (cop) phenotype and resembled de-etiolated wild-type seedlings at the transcriptome level (Hu et al., 2009Hu W.

PhyA Y242H-YFP contains a Y-to-H amino acid substitution at position 242, which corresponds to the amino acid change in the phyB Y276H mutant. Expression of phyA Y242H-YFP in wild-type background resulted in a cop phenotype as well, which was, however, much less pronounced than in seedlings expressing phyB Y276H (Su and Lagarias, 2007Su Y.S.

Interestingly, phyA Y242H-YFP still depends on FHY1/FHL for activity, as fhy1 fhl seedlings expressing phyA Y242H-YFP remained fully etiolated (Figure S3).Figure S3Cop Phenotype of PhyA Y242H-YFP-Expressing Seedlings, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A and B) Expression of phyA Y242H-YFP results in an FHY1/FHL-dependent cop phenotype.

A higher magnification of the dark grown seedlings is shown in (B). In FR, the expression of phyA Y242H-YFP resulted in a strong dominant-negative phenotype (Figures 3A and 3B), which is in agreement with data by Su and Lagarias, 2007Su Y.S. Lagarias J.C. Light-independent phytochrome signaling mediated by dominant GAF domain tyrosine mutants of Arabidopsis phytochromes in transgenic plants.Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 2124-2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar but is nevertheless not easy to reconcile with the idea that phyA Y242H-YFP is a constitutively active photoreceptor. Yet, consistent with this finding, phyA Y242H-YFP partially suppressed the upregulation of PRR9 and CAB2 in seedlings exposed to light (Figures 3C and 3D). An important prediction of the FHY1 shuttling model suggested by Genoud et al., 2008Genoud T. Schweizer F. Tscheuschler A. Debrieux D. Casal J.J. SchÃ¤fer E. Hiltbrunner A. Fankhauser C. FHY1 mediates nuclear import of the light-activated phytochrome A photoreceptor.PLoS Genet. 2008; 4: e1000143Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar is that any mutation that interferes with FHY1 recycling should interfere with nuclear transport of phyA and, as a consequence, result in reduced sensitivity to FR. The FRAP/FLIP experiments with YFP-FHY1 indicate that high levels of Pfr decrease the mobility of FHY1 (Figure 1). As phyA Y242H-YFP-expressing plants contain high amounts of âPfr,â nuclear transport of phyA Y242H-YFP may be reduced. Using fluorescence microscopy, we found that only very low levels of phyA Y242H-YFP accumulate in the nucleus, irrespective of whether or not the seedlings were exposed to light (Figure 3E). Moreover, in seedlings coexpressing phyA Y242H-YFP and cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)-tagged wild-type phyA, the âconstitutively activeâ phyA inhibited nuclear transport of phyA-CFP (Figure 3E). As phyA nuclear transport is required for FR signaling (Hiltbrunner et al., 2006Hiltbrunner A. Tscheuschler A. VicziÃ¡n A. Kunkel T. Kircher S. SchÃ¤fer E. FHY1 and FHL act together to mediate nuclear accumulation of the phytochrome A photoreceptor.Plant Cell Physiol. 2006; 47: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, RÃ¶sler et al., 2007RÃ¶sler J.

USA. 2007; 104: 10737-10742Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), these findings can explain the dominant-negative effect of phyA Y242H-YFP in FR. PhyA Y242H is predicted to be constitutively in Pfr (Su and Lagarias, 2007Su Y.S. Lagarias J.C. Light-independent phytochrome signaling mediated by dominant GAF domain tyrosine mutants of Arabidopsis phytochromes in transgenic plants.Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 2124-2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In yeast two-hybrid assays, binding of phyA to FHY1, FHL, PIF1, and PIF3 was dependent on light, i.e., on conditions establishing high levels of Pfr. In contrast, phyA Y242H did interact with FHY1, FHL, PIF1, and PIF3 in a light-independent manner, indicating that it is constitutively in Pfr or at least in a Pfr-like conformation (Figures 2A and 2B). Previously, it was shown that the phyA-FHY1/FHL complex rapidly dissociates when phyA is converted to Pr (Genoud et al., 2008Genoud T. Schweizer F. Tscheuschler A. Debrieux D. Casal J.J. SchÃ¤fer E. Hiltbrunner A. Fankhauser C. FHY1 mediates nuclear import of the light-activated phytochrome A photoreceptor.PLoS Genet. 2008; 4: e1000143Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, Sorokina et al., 2009Sorokina O. Kapus A.

Eng. 2009; 3: 15Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In contrast, in yeast two-hybrid assays, phyA Y242H-FHY1/FHL complexes were stable irrespective of the light conditions (Figure 2C). This further supports the notion that phyA Y242H is constitutively in Pfr and cannot be converted to Pr by any light treatment. Su and Lagarias, 2007Su Y.S. Lagarias J.C. Light-independent phytochrome signaling mediated by dominant GAF domain tyrosine mutants of Arabidopsis phytochromes in transgenic plants.Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 2124-2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar showed that phyB Y276H still depends on the chromophore for physiological activity. Consistent with this notion, we found that mutating cysteine 323 in phyA, which is essential for chromophore binding, to an alanine (C323A) abolished the interaction of phyA Y242H and FHY1 (Figure 2A). Although phyA Y242H-YFP is constitutively in Pfr, it is virtually inactive at the physiological level, and seedlings expressing phyA Y242H-YFP exhibit only a weak cop phenotype (Figure 3A and Figure S3) (Su and Lagarias, 2007Su Y.S. Lagarias J.C. Light-independent phytochrome signaling mediated by dominant GAF domain tyrosine mutants of Arabidopsis phytochromes in transgenic plants.Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 2124-2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus, not only PrâPfr but also PfrâPr conversion seems to be essential for proper phyA function. Based on these findings, we propose a model for light- and FHY1/FHL-dependent phyA nuclear transport, which consists of three overlapping cycles: two Pr/Pfr photoconversion cyclesâone in the cytosol and one in the nucleusâand one FHY1/FHL-Pr/Pfr complex association/dissociation cycle, which links the two photoconversion cycles (Figure 4A and Figure S4A ). In this model, FHY1/FHL continuously shuttle between the cytosol and the nucleus. They bind reversibly to phyA in the cytosol and transport it into the nucleus. After dissociation, FHY1/FHL are recycled back to the cytosol.Figure S4PhyA Model, Related to Figure 4 and Table S2Show full caption(A) Schematic representation of the model for phyA nuclear transport.(B) Model for phyA action including all parameter names, which is cast into a system of ordinary differential equations given in Eqs.

Due to the nonlinearity of the system shown in Figure 4A, which arises from the phyA-FHY1/FHL complex formation, the dynamics cannot be predicted without a more detailed mathematical analysis. As most of the biochemical parameters of the model depicted in Figure 4A are unknown and difficult to determine experimentally, a qualitative global network analysis was employed (Clodong et al., 2007Clodong S. DÃ¼hring U. Kronk L. Wilde A. Axmann I. Herzel H. Kollmann M. Functioning and robustness of a bacterial circadian clock.Mol. Syst.

The segment polarity network is a robust developmental module.Nature. 2000; 406: 188-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). The emerging reaction scheme is described by a system of coupled ordinary differential equations (see Supplemental Information). To study the qualitative behavior of the rescaled dynamic reaction scheme of Figure 4A and Figure S4B, we defined a list of input conditions, including the observations that FHY1/FHL protein levels positively correlate with the action of phyA and that expression of phyA Y242H-YFP reduces the hypocotyl length in dark-grown seedlings but interferes with hypocotyl growth inhibition in FR (Figure 4B). Although the list of input conditions includes the requirement that the simulated action spectrum exhibits a peak, we did not restrict its position to a specific wavelength. As output, we used the amount of nuclear-localized Pfr (= Pfrn). A systematic scan of the parameter space (Table S1) found those combinations, which reproduced all of the input conditions, defining the âadmissible parameter spaceâ of the problem posed. Among 106 randomly chosen parameter sets, we found 6050 admissible parameter combinations (â¼1 in 165), for each of which we simulated an action spectrum between 640 and 720 nm. Surprisingly, almost all admissible combinations resulted in an action spectrum with a peak in FR (Figures 5A and 5B ). Hence, the underlying structure of the dynamic model and the input conditions defined in Figure 4B result in an obligate shift of the action peak to FR as seen for the HIR (Hartmann, 1967Hartmann K.M. [An action spectrum of photomorphogenesis under high energy conditions and its interpretation on the basis of phytochrome (hypocotyl growth inhibition in Lactuca sativa L)].Z. Naturforsch.

Both stem cell states differ in their cell cycle profiles but must remain guarded from differentiation and senescence.

Interestingly, abrogating the polycomb activity of Cbx4 impairs its antisenescent function without affecting stem cell differentiation, indicating that differentiation and senescence are independent processes in human epidermis. Conversely, Cbx4 inhibits stem cell activation and differentiation through its SUMO ligase activity. Global transcriptome and chromatin occupancy analyses indicate that Cbx4 regulates modulators of epidermal homeostasis and represses factors such as Ezh2, Dnmt1, and Bmi1 to prevent the active stem cell state.

Human epidermal stem cells (epSCs) self-renew, locate at the basal layer, and harbor the potential to regenerate a long-term homeostatic stratified epithelium (Fuchs, 2009Fuchs E.

It is only when cellular replenishment is required that dormant epSCs become active, and the progeny undergo several rounds of proliferation before committing to differentiation (Klein et al., 2011Klein A.M.

However, the epigenetic mechanisms underlying the quiescent epSC state, and the dynamic interplay of chromatin remodeling factors required during the transition from dormancy to activation, have not yet been identified. Moreover, it is currently unclear how relatively quiescent human epSCs remain undifferentiated and protected from senescence. Here we have studied the role of the polycomb protein Cbx4/hPolycomb-2 (hereafter referred to as Cbx4) in regulating the slow cycling of human epSCs, as well as their differentiation and senescence. Polycomb proteins are transcriptional repressors essential for cell lineage choices during development, and are commonly deregulated in various human cancers (Morey and Helin, 2010Morey L. Helin K.

In mammals, several PcG proteins are found in at least two classes of complexes, termed Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2), which compact the chromatin, leading to transcriptional silencing.

Aside from their evolutionarily conserved chromodomain responsible for H3K27me3 recognition, Cbx proteins differ greatly in their sequences and structure (Kerppola, 2009Kerppola T.K.

For instance, Cbx4 is exclusive among Cbx proteins in that it exerts a SUMO E3-ligase activity on transcriptional repressors (Kagey et al., 2003Kagey M.H. Melhuish T.A. Wotton D.

In addition, Cbx4 enhances transcriptional repression by interacting with Dnmt3b and Jarid1b (Kim et al., 2008Kim S.H. Park J. Choi M.C. Park J.H. Kim H.P. Lee J.H. Oh D.Y. Im S.A. Bang Y.J. Kim T.Y.

At the cellular level, Cbx4 promotes proliferative arrest of immortalized cell lines through the Rb pathway (Dahiya et al., 2001Dahiya A. Wong S. Gonzalo S. Gavin M. Dean D.C. Linking the Rb and polycomb pathways.Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 557-569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, Satijn et al., 1997Satijn D.P. Olson D.J. van der Vlag J.

Interference with the expression of a novel human polycomb protein, hPc2, results in cellular transformation and apoptosis.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6076-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Here we show that Cbx4 exerts unique functions in human epSCs that are not shared with other PRC1-associated Cbx proteins. Our results indicate that Cbx4 promotes a slow cycling state and prevents differentiation and senescence of human epSCs. Interestingly, Cbx4 utilizes polycomb-dependent and -independent mechanisms to regulate the behavior of human epSCs. The transcript levels of Cbx4 were progressively reduced in the subpopulations of epidermal stem cells, transit amplifying cells, and terminally differentiated cells in primary cultures of human keratinocytes (FACS-purified according to the level of their surface expression of integrin Î±6; Î±6bright, Î±6dim, and Î±6low, respectively) (Figures 1A and 1B ) (Li et al., 1998Li A. Simmons P.J. Kaur P. Identification and isolation of candidate human keratinocyte stem cells based on cell surface phenotype.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 3902-3907Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). When plated at clonal density, the Î±6bright population give rise to a greater number of clones consisting of holoclones, meroclones, and paraclones compared to the Î±6low population, which formed fewer colonies, the majority of which were abortive paraclones, as an indication of their differentiated status (Figures S1A and S1B available online) (Barrandon and Green, 1987Barrandon Y. Green H. Three clonal types of keratinocyte with different capacities for multiplication.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1987; 84: 2302-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). The same trend of Cbx4 transcript levels was observed in interfollicular epidermal keratinocytes (Î±6bright, dim, low/CD34neg) sorted from adult mouse back skin (Figure S1C). Interestingly, none of the other PRC1-associated Cbx proteins showed a pattern similar to that of Cbx4 during differentiation: the levels of Cbx8 increased, while those of Cbx6 and Cbx7 did not significantly change (Figure 1A). In addition, the transcript levels of Cbx4 were comparatively the highest among Cbx proteins in keratinocytes (Figure S1D). We next studied the effect of perturbing the levels of endogenous Cbx4 in conditions that allow for keratinocyte stratification. Knockdown of Cbx4 (Figure S1E) did not prevent cell adhesion to the culture dishes (Figures S1F and S1G), but resulted in a reduction of the size and number of macroscopic colonies (Figure 1C, Figure S1H). Overexpression of an inducible form of Cbx4, whose C terminus was fused to a modified estrogen receptor (Cbx4-ER) and is only active upon treatment of cells with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT), led to a reduction in the size of the colonies compared to control cells (Figure 1D, Figure S1I). Similarly to knockdown of endogenous Cbx4, these effects were not due to the inability of Cbx4-ER expressing cells to adhere to the culture dishes (Figures S1J and S1K). Interestingly, 24 hr after plating them, Cbx4-ER overexpressing cells mostly remained as single cells, with few groups of two adjacent cells (one division), whereas a higher proportion of the control cells were doublets or triplets, an indication of active proliferation (Figures S1J and S1K). Although macroscopically the effects of knocking down and overexpressing Cbx4 were similar, microscopically the effects were completely different. Thus, whereas knockdown of Cbx4 resulted in colonies with terminally differentiated-like morphology, overexpressing Cbx4 led predominantly to small undifferentiated colonies (Figures 1C and 1D). In addition, using a construct that expressed GFP under a Cbx4-ER-IRES-GFP cassette, we observed that the few large colonies present in Cbx4-ER overexpressing cultures were in fact GFPdim low infectants (Figures S2A and S2B). Decreasing the proliferative potential was a feature unique to Cbx4, since overexpression of Cbx6, Cbx7, and Cbx8 did not lead to a reduction in the number or size of the colonies (Figures S2C and S2D). Immunostaining of integrin Î±6 and involucrin, which displays the undifferentiated and differentiated portions of the culture, respectively, as well as transcript levels of differentiation markers, confirmed that Cbx4 knockdown resulted in differentiation of the culture, whereas its overexpression maintained cells as undifferentiated (Figures 1Eâ1G). Interestingly, overexpression of Cbx4 also led to a decrease in the levels of Myc and ÎNp63 (Figure 1G). Although Cbx4-overexpressing cultures displayed reduced proliferation, they also showed a gradual increment in the long-term clonogenicity, compared to control cells, after 15 consecutive serial passages (Figures S2EâS2G). In accordance with a role of Cbx proteins in preventing senescence, depleting the endogenous expression of Cbx4 resulted in an increase in the transcript and protein levels of Cdkn2a/p16, as well as the activity of the senescence-associated SA-Î²-Galactosidase (Figures 1Gâ1I). Knockdown of Cbx4 also increased the granularity and cell size of the cells, as well as the percentage of cells positive for Annexin-V, all of which are indicative of keratinocyte replicative senescence (Gosselin et al., 2009Gosselin K. Deruy E. Martien S. Vercamer C. Bouali F. Dujardin T. Slomianny C. Houel-Renault L. Chelli F. De Launoit Y. Abbadie C. Senescent keratinocytes die by autophagic programmed cell death.Am. J. Pathol. 2009; 174: 423-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) (Figure S3). We next studied which of the cellular effects of Cbx4 depended on its Polycomb function. First we confirmed that endogenous Ring1b interacted with endogenous Cbx4, Cbx7, and Mel18, but not with the PRC2 member Suz12, indicating that Cbx4 is found within the PRC1 complex in human epidermal keratinocytes (Figure S4). To dissect the Polycomb-dependent functions of Cbx4 in epSCs, we introduced mutations in its chromodomain (creating Cbx4F11A, Cbx4W35L, or the double mutant Cbx4CDM, Figure 2A ). These mutations completely abrogate interaction with methylated H3 histone tails while maintaining the proper folding of the protein (Fischle et al., 2003Fischle W. Wang Y. Jacobs S.A. Kim Y. Allis C.D. Khorasanizadeh S. Molecular basis for the discrimination of repressive methyl-lysine marks in histone H3 by Polycomb and HP1 chromodomains.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1870-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Similar to the wild-type Cbx4, overexpression of any one of the 4OHT inducible chromodomain mutants of Cbx4 resulted in a severe reduction of the size of the colonies (as exemplified by the double mutant Cbx4CDM; Figures 2B and 2C, Figure S5A). However, when analyzed microscopically, the colonies resulting from Cbx4CDM expression displayed an abortive-like morphology, similar to that obtained following knockdown of endogenous Cbx4 (Figure 1C), suggesting that Cbx4CDM behaved like a dominant-negative mutant of Cbx4 (Figure 2D). We confirmed that wild-type and mutant Cbx4 were expressed at equal levels (Figures 2E and 2F), and that expression of their noninducible versions resulted in identical phenotypes to those of the inducible expression constructs (Figures S5A and S5B). Unexpectedly, although the morphology of Cbx4CDM colonies was abortive-like, the expression of epidermal progenitor and differentiation markers was virtually identical between Cbx4WT- and Cbx4CDM-expressing cells (Figures 2G and 2H). However, expression of Cbx4CDM, but not of Cbx4WT, resulted in an increase in the levels of Cdkn2a/p16 transcript, indicating that the repression of this locus is dependent on a functional chromodomain (Figure 2H). We thus hypothesized that the Polycomb function of Cbx4 is primarily required for protecting human keratinocytes from undergoing senescence but is dispensable for the effect of Cbx4 on epSC quiescence and differentiation. We tested this hypothesis by several means. First, we determined that the majority of Cbx4CDM, but not Cbx4WT or control colonies, contained high activity of SA-Î²-Galactosidase (Figure 3A ). Expression of Cbx4CDM also increased the cellular complexity, and percentage of Annexin-V-positive cells, as an indication of increased premature senescence (Figure S5C). Second, we compared whether the effects of Cbx4WT and Cbx4CDM were reversible or irreversible, based on the premise that cell cycle dormancy is a transitory process, while senescence is a predominantly irreversible cellular fate (Kuilman et al., 2010Kuilman T. Michaloglou C. Mooi W.J. Peeper D.S. The essence of senescence.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 2463-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar). To this end, our 4OHT inducible Cbx4 constructs allowed us to perform reversibility experiments. In the presence of 4OHT, Cbx4WT-ER or Cbx4CDM-ER cultures grew as small undifferentiated colonies or senescent-like colonies, respectively (Figures 3B and 3D, Figure S5A). However, Cbx4WT colonies resumed to a proliferative profile as early as 48 after withdrawal of 4OHT and were capable of long-term growth, indicating that its effect over epSCs is reversible and requires a constant activity of Cbx4 (Figures 3B and 3F). Conversely, Cbx4CDM cultures remained nonproliferative in the absence of 4OHT, denoting the irreversible nature of the effect of this mutant (Figures 3D and 3F). To further verify whether the chromodomain of Cbx4 is solely required for its antisenescence function, we performed a rescue experiment by knocking down endogenous Cdkn2a/p16 in Cbx4WT- or Cbx4CDM-expressing cells. Interestingly, reducing p16 to baseline levels in Cbx4CDM cells resulted in small, undifferentiated colonies that expressed low levels of terminal differentiation markers, which were virtually identical to the Cbx4WT colonies (Figure 3G, Figures S5D and S5E). Therefore, the Polycomb-deficient Cbx4 mutant induced epSC senescence in a p16-dependent manner, yet had no effect on their differentiation, suggesting that senescence and terminal differentiation can occur independently from each other in the epidermis. Underscoring this concept is the fact that stimulation of epSCs with calcium, to force them to undergo terminal differentiation, steadily increased the levels of involucrin and filaggrin, but reduced the levels of p16 and p19 (Figure S6A). As a control of PRC1 regulating the Ink4a locus in human keratinocytes, we verified that knockdown of the PRC1 subunits Bmi1 or Mel18 resulted in an increase in the transcript levels of Cdkn2a/p16, and accordingly reduced the clonogenic capacity of the cells (Figures S6BâS6G) (Dietrich et al., 2007Dietrich N. Bracken A.P. Trinh E. Schjerling C.K. Koseki H. Rappsilber J. Helin K. Hansen K.H.

We next compared the global transcriptomes of human keratinocytes expressing Cbx4WT or Cbx4CDM (the full list of genes can be found in Table S1, available online). As a control, we also performed microarray analysis on Cbx4-depleted (KD) human keratinocytes (Table S2). Knockdown of Cbx4 resulted in an increased expression of both a large number of genes pertaining to the epidermal terminal differentiation cluster and Cdkn2a/p16. Gene ontology analysis indicated that the global transcriptome changes that occurred upon knockdown of Cbx4 corresponded mainly to those genes associated with epidermal differentiation and morphogenesis (Figure 4A ). Interestingly, comparison of the Cbx4WT and Cbx4CDM transcriptomes revealed that they differed only in a very low number of genes (Figures 4Bâ4D; full list in Table S3). As expected, abrogation of the chromodomain induced the expression of Cdkn2a/p16, and a second senescence-associated gene, Cdkn1c/p57 (Figure 4D) (Kim et al., 2010Kim R.H. Lieberman M.B. Lee R.

Cell Res. 2010; 316: 2600-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, none of the genes involved in epSC proliferation, or onset and terminal differentiation, showed any differences between the wild-type and the chromodomain mutant Cbx4 cells (Figure 4B). A less stringent statistical analysis, focusing on differences between Cbx4WT and Cbx4CDM regardless of their fold-change with respect to the control cells, revealed that genes such as Bmp4, Lgr6, IGFBP3, and Runx3, all of which have been previously implicated in specific aspects of keratinocyte behavior, were derepressed in Cbx4CDM cells, suggesting that the chromodomain may contribute to some aspects of epidermal homeostasis (Table S4) (Gosselet et al., 2007Gosselet F.P.

https://openalex.org/W2103415764,"Etiology and pathogenesis of sarcopenia, the progressive decline in skeletal muscle mass and strength that occurs with aging, are still poorly understood. We recently found that overexpression of the neural serine protease neurotrypsin in motoneurons resulted in the degeneration of their neuromuscular junctions (NMJ) within days. Therefore, we wondered whether neurotrypsin-dependent NMJ degeneration also affected the structure and function of the skeletal muscles. Using histological and functional analyses of neurotrypsin-overexpressing and neurotrypsin-deficient mice, we found that overexpression of neurotrypsin in motoneurons installed the full sarcopenia phenotype in young adult mice. Characteristic muscular alterations included a reduced number of muscle fibers, increased heterogeneity of fiber thickness, more centralized nuclei, fiber-type grouping, and an increased proportion of type I fibers. As in age-dependent sarcopenia, excessive fragmentation of the NMJ accompanied the muscular alterations. These results suggested the destabilization of the NMJ through proteolytic cleavage of agrin at the onset of a pathogenic pathway ending in sarcopenia. Studies of neurotrypsin-deficient and agrin-overexpressing mice revealed that old-age sarcopenia also develops without neurotrypsin and is not prevented by elevated levels of agrin. Our results define neurotrypsin- and age-dependent sarcopenia as the common final outcome of 2 etiologically distinct entities.âBÃ¼tikofer, L., Zurlinden, A., Bolliger, M.

https://openalex.org/W2109398569,"BMI1 is required for the self-renewal of stem cells in many tissues including the lung epithelial stem cells, Bronchioalveolar Stem Cells (BASCs). Imprinted genes, which exhibit expression from only the maternally or paternally inherited allele, are known to regulate developmental processes, but what their role is in adult cells remains a fundamental question. Many imprinted genes were derepressed in Bmi1 knockout mice, and knockdown of Cdkn1c (p57) and other imprinted genes partially rescued the self-renewal defect of Bmi1 mutant lung cells. Expression of p57 and other imprinted genes was required for lung cell self-renewal in culture and correlated with repair of lung epithelial cell injury in vivo. Our data suggest that BMI1-dependent regulation of expressed alleles at imprinted loci, distinct from imprinting per se, is required for control of lung stem cells. We anticipate that the regulation and function of imprinted genes is crucial for self-renewal in diverse adult tissue-specific stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2003206984,"Although AMPK plays well-established roles in the modulation of energy balance, recent studies have shown that AMPK activation has potent anti-inflammatory effects. In the present experiments, we examined the role of AMPK in phagocytosis. We found that ingestion of Escherichia coli or apoptotic cells by macrophages increased AMPK activity. AMPK activation increased the ability of neutrophils or macrophages to ingest bacteria (by 46 Â± 7.8 or 85 Â± 26%, respectively, compared to control, P<0.05) and the ability of macrophages to ingest apoptotic cells (by 21 Â± 1.4%, P<0.05 compared to control). AMPK activation resulted in cytoskeletal reorganization, including enhanced formation of actin and microtubule networks. Activation of PAK1/2 and WAVE2, which are downstream effectors of Rac1, accompanied AMPK activation. AMPK activation also induced phosphorylation of CLIP-170, a protein that participates in microtubule synthesis. The increase in phagocytosis was reversible by the specific AMPK inhibitor compound C, siRNA to AMPKÎ±1, Rac1 inhibitors, or agents that disrupt actin or microtubule networks. In vivo, AMPK activation resulted in enhanced phagocytosis of bacteria in the lungs by 75 Â± 5% vs. control (P<0.05). These results demonstrate a novel function for AMPK in enhancing the phagocytic activity of neutrophils and macrophages."

Exploiting the magneto-electric coupling, we use an electric field to produce a single magnetic domain state, and a magnetic field to induce ionic displacements. Under these conditions, interference charge-magnetic X-ray scattering arises, encoding the amplitude and phase of the displacements.

https://openalex.org/W1522784853,"Pairs of massive black holes or quasars, separated by less than the diameter of a galaxy, are predicted by most models of galaxy formation and growth, but only a few examples have been found. Now an active black-hole pair has been detected in a Chandra X-ray image, separated by only about 130 parsecs (430 light years), in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 3393. The regular spiral morphology and predominantly old circumnuclear stellar population of this galaxy, and the closeness of the black holes embedded in the bulge, suggest that they are the result of a minor merger event. The current picture of galaxy evolution1 advocates co-evolution of galaxies and their nuclear massive black holes, through accretion and galactic merging. Pairs of quasars, each with a massive black hole at the centre of its galaxy, have separations of 6,000 to 300,000 light years (refs 2 and 3; 1 parsec = 3.26 light years) and exemplify the first stages of this gravitational interaction. The final stages of the black-hole merging process, through binary black holes and final collapse into a single black hole with gravitational wave emission, are consistent with the sub-light-year separation inferred from the optical spectra4 and light-variability5 of two such quasars. The double active nuclei of a few nearby galaxies with disrupted morphology and intense star formation (such as NGC 6240 with a separation6 of about 2,600 light years and Mrk 463 with a separation7 of about 13,000 light years between the nuclei) demonstrate the importance of major mergers of equal-mass spiral galaxies in this evolution; such mergers lead to an elliptical galaxy8, as in the case of the double-radio-nucleus elliptical galaxy 0402+379 (with a separation of about 24 light years between the nuclei)9. Minor mergers of a spiral galaxy with a smaller companion should be a more common occurrence, evolving into spiral galaxies with active massive black-hole pairs10, but have hitherto not been seen. Here we report the presence of two active massive black holes, separated by about 490 light years, in the Seyfert11 galaxy NGC 3393 (50 Mpc, about 160 million light years). The regular spiral morphology and predominantly old circum-nuclear stellar population12 of this galaxy, and the closeness of the black holes embedded in the bulge, provide a hitherto missing observational point to the study of galaxy/black hole evolution. Comparison of our observations with current theoretical models of mergers suggests that they are the result of minor merger evolution10."
https://openalex.org/W1965544877,"Upon virus infection, the innate immune response provides the first line of protection and rapidly induces type I interferons (IFNÎ±/Î²), which mediate potent antiviral effects. To maintain homeostasis and prevent autoimmunity, IFN production is tightly regulated; however, the mechanisms of negative regulation are poorly understood. Herein, we demonstrate that the A20 binding inhibitor of NF-ÎºB 1 (ABIN1) is a novel negative regulator of antiviral signaling. Overexpression of ABIN1 inhibited IFN-Î² promoter activation in response to virus infection or poly(I:C) transfection, whereas siRNA-mediated knockdown of ABIN1 enhanced IFN-Î² production upon virus infection. ABIN1 interacted with the A20 regulatory molecule TAX1BP1 and was essential for the recruitment of TAX1BP1 and A20 to the noncanonical IÎºB kinases TBK1 and IKKi in response to poly(I:C) transfection. ABIN1 and TAX1BP1 together disrupted the interactions between the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF3 and TBK1/IKKi to attenuate lysine 63-linked polyubiquitination of TBK1/IKKi. Finally, an intact ubiquitin binding domain of ABIN1 was essential for ABIN1 to interact with TBK1/IKKi and inhibit IFN-Î² production upon poly(I:C) transfection or virus infection. Together, these results suggest that ABIN1 requires its ubiquitin binding domain and cooperates with TAX1BP1 and A20 to restrict antiviral signaling."

Here we report that this pathway is indispensable for methylation of the only other known substrate of Set1, K233 in Dam1, at kinetochores. Deletion of RAD6, BRE1, or Paf1 complex members abolishes Dam1 methylation, as does mutation of H2BK123. Our results demonstrate that Set1-mediated methylation is regulated by a general pathway regardless of substrate that is composed of transcriptional regulatory factors functioning independently of transcription. Moreover, our data identify a node of regulatory crosstalk in trans between a histone modification and modification on a nonhistone protein, demonstrating that changing chromatin states can signal functional changes in other essential cellular proteins and machineries."
https://openalex.org/W2125727006,"The histaminergic and hypocretin/orexin (hcrt) neurotransmitter systems play crucial roles in alertness/wakefulness in rodents. We elucidated the role of histamine in wakefulness and the interaction of the histamine and hcrt systems in larval zebrafish. Translation inhibition of histidine decarboxylase (hdc) with morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) led to a behaviorally measurable decline in light-associated activity, which was partially rescued by hdc mRNA injections and mimicked by histamine receptor H1 (Hrh1) antagonist pyrilamine treatment. Histamine-immunoreactive fibers targeted the dorsal telencephalon, an area that expresses histamine receptors hrh1 and hrh3 and contains predominantly glutamatergic neurons. Tract tracing with DiI revealed that projections from dorsal telencephalon innervate the hcrt and histaminergic neurons. Translation inhibition of hdc decreased the number of hcrt neurons in a Hrh1-dependent manner. The reduction was rescued by overexpression of hdc mRNA. hdc mRNA injection alone led to an up-regulation of hcrt neuron numbers. These results suggest that histamine is essential for the development of a functional and intact hcrt system and that histamine has a bidirectional effect on the development of the hcrt neurons. In summary, our findings provide evidence that these two systems are linked both functionally and developmentally, which may have important implications in sleep disorders and narcolepsy. development via histamine receptor H1 in zebrafish."
https://openalex.org/W2116888004,"Inflammation is intimately linked with naturally occurring remodeling events in the endometrium. Lipoxins comprise a group of short-lived, nonclassic eicosanoids possessing potent anti-inflammatory and proresolution properties. In the present study, we investigated the role of lipoxin A(4) (LXA(4)) in the endometrium and demonstrated that 15-LOX-2, an enzyme necessary for LX biosynthesis, is expressed in this tissue. Our results establish that LXA(4) possesses robust estrogenic activity through its capacity to alter ERE transcriptional activity, as well as expression of estrogen-regulated genes, alkaline phosphatase activity, and proliferation in human endometrial epithelial cells. Interestingly, LXA(4) also demonstrated antiestrogenic potential, significantly attenuating E2-induced activity. This estrogenic activity was directly mediated through estrogen receptors (ERs). Subsequent investigations determined that the actions of LXA(4) are exclusively mediated through ERÎ± and closely mimic those of the potent estrogen 17Î²-estradiol (E2). In binding assays, LXA(4) competed with E2 for ER binding, with an IC(50) of 46 nM. Furthermore, LXA(4) exhibited estrogenic activity in vivo, increasing uterine wet weight and modulating E2-regulated gene expression. These findings reveal a previously unappreciated facet of LXA(4) bioactions, implicating this lipid mediator in novel immunoendocrine crosstalk mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1965965186,"Vitamin C and its degradation products participate in chemical modifications of proteins in vivo through non-enzymatic glycation (Maillard reaction) and formation of different products called advanced glycation end products. Vitamin C levels are particularly high in selected tissues, such as lens, brain and adrenal gland, and its degradation products can inflict substantial protein damage via formation of advanced glycation end products. However, the pathways of in vivo vitamin C degradation are poorly understood. Here we have determined the levels of vitamin C oxidation and degradation products dehydroascorbic acid, 2,3-diketogulonic acid, 3-deoxythreosone, xylosone, and threosone in the human lens using o-phenylenediamine to trap both free and protein-bound adducts. In the protein-free fraction and water-soluble proteins (WSP), all five listed degradation products were identified. Dehydroascorbic acid, 2,3-diketogulonic acid, and 3-deoxythreosone were the major products in the protein-free fraction, whereas in the WSP, 3-deoxythreosone was the most abundant measured dicarbonyl. In addition, 3-deoxythreosone in WSP showed positive linear correlation with age (p < 0.05). In water-insoluble proteins, only 3-deoxythreosone and threosone were detected, whereby the level of 3-deoxythreosone was â¼20 times higher than the level of threosone. The identification of 3-deoxythreosone as the major degradation product bound to human lens proteins provides in vivo evidence for the non-oxidative pathway of dehydroascorbate degradation into erythrulose as a major pathway for vitamin C degradation in vivo.

IntroductionThe Maillard reaction or nonenzymatic glycation is a complex series of reactions initiated by reducing carbohydrates and nucleophilic side chains of proteins. The result of this reaction is a plethora of structurally different compounds covalently bound to the proteins collectively called advanced glycation end products (AGEs). 3The abbreviations used are: AGEadvanced glycation end productASAascorbic acidDHAdehydroascorbic acid2,3-DKG2,3-diketogulonic acidESIelectron spray ionizationISinternal standardWIPwater-insoluble proteinsWSPwater-soluble proteinsRPreversed phaseOPDo-phenylenediamineOPDx2HClo-phenylenediamine hydrochloridePFFprotein-free fraction. Growing evidence has shown that ascorbic acid (ASA) can also contribute to nonenzymatic modification of proteins, especially in the lens, where its concentration can reach 3 mm and contribute to protein aggregation and cataractogenesis (1Varma S.D. Richards R.D. Ophthalmic Res. 1988; 20: 164-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The similarity between modifications of lens proteins by ASA and those in aged human lenses and cataract provides a solid basis for this concept (2Cheng R. Feng Q. Ortwerth B.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1762: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 3Argirov O.K. Lin B. Ortwerth B.J. J. Biol.

Biochimie. 1998; 80: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was further supported with a mouse model in which the human sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter 2 was overexpressed in lens, thereby increasing the influx of ASA that led to marked lens browning and AGE accumulation (5Fan X. Reneker L.W. Obrenovich M.E. Strauch C. Cheng R. Jarvis S.M. Ortwerth B.J. Monnier V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 16912-16917Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).The chemical pathways by which ASA generates glycating agents probably originate from its oxidized form (i.e. dehydroascorbic acid (DHA; 1)), which can react with nucleophiles directly or be rearranged into even more reactive forms. Major DHA degradation products identified are 2,3-diketogulonic acid (2,3-DKG), which further degrades into l-erythrulose and oxalate (6Simpson G.L. Ortwerth B.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1501: 12-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), l-threo-pentos-2-ulose (l-xylosone) (7Shin D.B. Feather M.S. Carbohydr.

Biotechnol Biochem. 2001; 65: 1707-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition, Lederer and co-workers (9Reihl O. Lederer M.O. Schwack W. Carbohydr. Res. 2004; 339: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) indirectly demonstrated 4-hydroxy-2-oxobutanal (3-deoxythreosone) as a possible dicarbonyl compound formed by DHA degradation (Scheme 1). Several AGEs were identified as a result of ASA or DHA reaction with proteins, such as CML (10Dunn J.A. Ahmed M.U. Murtiashaw M.H. Richardson J.M. Walla M.D. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W.

However, because other sugars and metabolites also contribute to their formation and specific probes for ascorbate-derived AGEs are not available, it has been a challenge to evaluate the relative role of ascorbic acid in AGE formation in vivo.Dicarbonyls are important intermediates of the Maillard reaction, which preferentially react with arginine residues. They can also react with other protein residues (e.g. lysine) to form more or less stable reversible products, and they can serve as precursors of AGEs or mediators of lysine oxidation into allysine (13Fan X. Zhang J. Theves M. Strauch C. Nemet I. Liu X. Qian J. Giblin F.J. Monnier V.M. J. Biol.

Food Chem. 2001; 49: 1493-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) showed that in the early stage of the reaction, only one reversible product could be identified (i.e. 5-(4,5-dihydroxy-2-imino-1-imidazolidinyl)norvaline) (16Lo T.W.

Despite these and several other studies on reversible binding of dicarbonyls to proteins (17Patthy L. Smith E.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1968; 243: 6171-6179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), little is known of the amounts of reversible products formed during reactions of dicarbonyls with proteins in vivo, many of which could play important roles in protein destabilization.Here we measured the level of dicarbonyl compounds formed by the major vitamin C oxidation product (DHA) and its subsequent degradation products 2,3-DKG, 3-deoxythreosone, xylosone, and threosone in human lenses as well as the amount of these dicarbonyls reversibly bound to water-soluble (WSP) and water insoluble proteins (WIP).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsReagents were obtained from Sigma unless indicated otherwise.

The amount of DHA-quinoxaline (6) formed was monitored by analyzing aliquots of the incubation mixtures at 30-min intervals for 12 h and after 24 h, using the LC-MS/MS method described below.Incubation of Crystallins with DHABovine lens crystallins (30 mg) were incubated with DHA (5 mm) for 7 days in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4, 100 mm, with 1 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid). After incubation, proteins were washed three times with ice-cold water through a 10-kDa cut-off filter. After washing, protein concentration was measured by a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce), and an equivalent of 2 mg of protein was dissolved in 400 Î¼l of HEPES buffer (pH 5.0 and 7.0), and 100 Î¼l of OPD (1 and 2% dissolved in HEPES, pH 5.0 and 7.0) was added. The samples were blanked with argon and incubated for 6, 10, and 12 h at room temperature in the dark with constant rotation. After incubation, ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (TCA) (40%, 25 Î¼l) was added to an aliquot of the incubation mixtures (100 Î¼l), and the samples were held on ice for 20 min and centrifuged (20,000 Ã g, 30 min, 4 Â°C) into 50 Î¼l of the supernatant, and 45 Î¼l of 0.1% TFA and 5 Î¼l of internal standard (IS) were added. From this 70 Î¼l was used for LC-MS/MS analysis. All analyses were done in duplicate.Incubation of Xylosone with/without CrystallinsPure water solution of xylosone (4) was prepared following the previously published procedure, and its concentration was determined by the titrimetric method after oxidation with hydrogen peroxide (24Vuorinen T. Serianni A.S. Carbohydr. Res. 1990; 207: 185-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Xylosone (4) at three different concentrations (1.0, 0.5, and 0.25 mm) was preincubated with and without proteins (10 mg/ml) in HEPES buffer (500 mm, pH 7.4, with 0.5 mm DTPH) at room temperature for 3 h. After pH adjustment to 5.0 and incubation with OPD, the level of 4 was measured in the incubation mixtures following the procedures described previously.Preparation of Lens Proteins and Protein-free FractionsA total of 17 human non-cataractous lenses were obtained from the National Disease Research Interchange (Philadelphia, PA) under an approved IRB protocol from University Hospitals of Cleveland. Lenses were stored at â80 Â°C until use. The lenses were homogenized in 5 mm Chelex-100-treated HEPES buffer (pH 5.0) with protease inhibitors added (Roche Applied Science) (2.0 ml/lens) in a Con-Torqueglass homogenizer (Eberbach, Ann Arbor, MI) for 3 min on ice. The homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 Ã g for 30 min at 4 Â°C. The supernatant and pellet were separated. The pellet (WIP) was further washed twice with 1.0 ml of water, and the supernatant was discarded after centrifugation. After washing, the pellet was resuspended in water (1 ml) and freeze-dried. The supernatant fractions that contained WSP were passed through 10-kDa cut-off filters (Pall, Ann Arbor, MI). The filtrate was separated as protein-free fraction (PFF), whereas WSP were washed twice with ice-cold water.Protein concentration in WSP was measured by the BCA protein assay kit, whereas WIP were weighed after freeze-drying. Ascorbylation using 5 mm DHA for 24 h did not impact on protein yield.Incubation of Lens Fractions with OPDInto 50 Î¼l of PFF were added 40 Î¼l of HEPES buffer (500 mm, pH 5.0) and 10 Î¼l of OPD (2% dissolved in HEPES, pH 5.0). After blanketing with argon to prevent oxidation during processing, the samples were incubated for 8 h in the dark at room temperature. After incubation, 45 Î¼l of 0.1% TFA and 5 Î¼l of IS were added into 50 Î¼l of the reaction mixture, and 70 Î¼l was injected into the LC-MS/MS mass spectrometer.An equivalent of 2 mg of WS or WI proteins was dissolved in up to 400 Î¼l of HEPES buffer (500 mm, pH 5.0), and 100 Î¼l of OPD (2% dissolved in HEPES buffer, pH 5.0) was added. The samples were blanketed with argon and incubated for 8 h at room temperature in the dark with constant rotation. After incubation, ice-cold TCA (40%, 25 Î¼l) was added to an aliquot of the incubation mixture (100 Î¼l), and the samples were held on ice for 20 min and centrifuged (20,000 Ã g for 30 min at 4 Â°C). To 50 Î¼l of the supernatant was added 45 Î¼l of 0.1% TFA and 5 Î¼l of IS. 70 Î¼l was injected for LC-MS/MS analysis.Quantitation by Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass SpectrometryLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis was performed with a Waters HPLC system consisting of a model 2695 separation module and a Micromass Ultima triple quadrupole mass spectrometric detector (Waters-Micromass, Manchester, UK). An Atlantis dC-18 column (2.1 Ã 50 mm; 3 Î¼m; Waters, Milford, MA) was used. Solvents for analysis of the incubation mixtures were 0.1% TFA in water (solvent D) and 90% acetonitrile in water (solvent E). A gradient was applied as follows: 0 min 100% D (0% E), 0â15 min 100% D (0% E) to 60% D (40%E), 15â16 min 60% D (40% E) to 20% D (80% E), 16â20 min 20% D (80% E). Flow rate was 0.2 ml/min. Electron spray positive ionization (ESI+)-mass spectrometric multiple-reaction-monitoring experiments were used for quinoxaline derivatives of DHA (6), 2,3-DKG (7), 3-deoxythreosone (8), xylosone (9), and threosone (10) in the human lenses. The ionization source temperature was 120 Â°C, and the desolvation gas temperature 300 Â°C. The cone gas and desolvation gas flow rates were 660 and 85 liters/h, respectively. The capillary voltage was 3.50 kV. Argon gas was in the collision cell. Programmed molecular ion and fragment ion masses were optimized to Â±0.1 Da for multiple-reaction-monitoring detection of analyte. Cone voltage was 50 V for all compounds.

(25Mittelmaier S. FÃ¼nfrocken M. Fenn D. Fichert T. Pischetsrieder M. J. Chromatogr. B Analyt. Technol. Biomed. Life Sci. 2010; 878: 877-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) to be a good medium for dicarbonyl derivatization by OPD. DHA (1), being the least reactive of the tested dicarbonyls, was used for optimization of incubation conditions. DHA (1) was incubated in HEPES buffer (500 mm, pH 5.0 and 7.0) with OPD (0.5â2.5%). All incubations were done in the dark at room temperature under argon. A reaction plateau was achieved after 5 h of incubation with OPD at 1% and above (data not shown). Potential de novo formation of examined dicarbonyls 1â5 during incubation was tested by incubating OPD with ASA (5 mm), DHA (5 mm), and fructosyl-lysine (5 mm) under the same incubation conditions. Only de novo formation of 2,3-DKG (2) was observed during incubation of DHA (1) with OPD at pH 7.0.For optimization of incubation conditions for dicarbonyls reversibly bound to bovine crystallins, the latter were incubated with 5 mm DHA for 7 days in sodium phosphate buffer (100 mm, 1 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, pH 7.4), and after washing through a 10-kDa filter, an equivalent of 2 mg was then incubated with OPD (1 and 2%) in the HEPES buffer at pH 5.0 and 7.0. As can be seen in Table 2, 3-deoxythreosone (3) and threosone (5) were detected in the tested proteins. A reaction plateau, at both pH values and OPD concentration, was achieved after 6 h, and the yield of 3 and 5 was not further increased by prolonging the incubation time. On the other hand, increasing the pH from 5.0 to 7.0 resulted in increased formation of 3 by a factor of 2, whereas the yield of 5 was not significantly changed. The same amount of 5 at both pH values suggests that pH 5.0 is sufficient for the trapping of dicarbonyls with OPD in the protein-rich fraction. The higher value of 3 at higher pH, on the other hand, suggests excess formation from other sources in addition to reversibly bound compound 3. Based on this analysis, an incubation time of 8 h, pH 5.0, and 2% OPD was chosen for all subsequent experiments.TABLE 2Ratio of peak areas of quinoxalines formed from protein-bound 3-deoxythreosone (3) and threosone (5) in a reaction with OPD to internal standard (IS) followed after protein incubation and modification with DHAOPDpHDerivatizing time6 h10 h12 h3/IS1%5.01.71.81.87.03.73.53.72%5.01.81.71.87.03.83.83.85/IS1%5.00.20.30.27.00.20.220.32%5.00.20.20.27.00.30.30.3 Open table in a new tab Efficiency of capture by OPD of dicarbonyls associated with the protein-fraction was tested with xylosone (4). The ratios between xylosone level at initial concentration of 1.0, 0.5, and 0.25 mm in the incubation mixtures preincubated with proteins and the incubation mixtures without proteins were 112 Â± 23, 82 Â± 4, and 86 Â± 2%, respectively. Relatively high recovery of xylosone from incubation mixtures with proteins showed very good capture of this dicarbonyl in the presence of different nucleophilic amino acid residues, where the lower recovery of xylosone (4) at some concentrations can be due to formation of irreversible adducts between 4 and proteins. In addition, all dicarbonyls were quantified as their OPD derivatives by quinoxaline addition with an assumption that the reaction between the dicarbonyls and OPD was quantitative. Comparison of values obtained for DHA and xylosone incubated with OPD with values obtained for their pure quinoxaline derivatives showed yields between 59 and 71% in the concentration range between 0.1 and 3.0 mm. This compares well with the recovery reported by Glomb and Tschirnich (26Glomb M.A. Tschirnich R. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2001; 49: 5543-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) for glyoxal and methylglyoxal (each about 60%), whereas that of the oxoaldehydes of glucose was above 90%.ASA Degradation Products in Human LensesHuman lens proteins were separated into three fractions: WSP, WIP, and PFF. All three fractions were incubated with OPD in HEPES buffer and then analyzed by LC-MS/MS for the presence of dicarbonyls 1â5 as OPD derivatives (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4). All five analyzed dicarbonyls were detected in the PFF of the tested lenses, whereby their concentrations were in a range of 0.5â9.1 pmol/mg lens (Fig. 2). The level of 3-deoxythreosone (3) was the highest, followed by 2,3-DKG (2), DHA (1), threosone (5), and xylosone (4) in a relative ratio of 18:17:10:1.6:1, respectively.FIGURE 2Level of free dicarbonyl quinoxalines from DHA (1), 2,3-DKG (2), 3-deoxythreosone (3), xylosone (4), and threosone (5) in human lenses measured as OPD derivatives.

Many pore-forming toxins use cholesterol, sphingolipids, or other raft components as receptors. However, the role of plasma membrane organization for toxin action is not well understood. In this study, we have investigated cellular dynamics during the attack of equinatoxin II, a pore-forming toxin from the sea anemone Actinia equina, by combining time lapse three-dimensional live cell imaging, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, FRET, and fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy. Our results show that membrane binding by equinatoxin II is accompanied by extensive plasma membrane reorganization into microscopic domains that resemble coalesced lipid rafts. Pore formation by the toxin induces Ca(2+) entry into the cytosol, which is accompanied by hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, plasma membrane blebbing, actin cytoskeleton reorganization, and inhibition of endocytosis. We propose that plasma membrane reorganization into stabilized raft domains is part of the killing strategy of equinatoxin II."

We monitored Homer expression and subcellular localization in human skeletal muscle biopsies following 60 d of bedrest [Second Berlin Bedrest Study (BBR2-2)]. Soleus (SOL) and vastus lateralis (VL) biopsies were taken at start (pre) and at end (end) of bedrest from healthy male volunteers of a control group without exercise (CTR; n=9), a resistive-only exercise group (RE; n=7), and a combined resistive/vibration exercise group (RVE; n=7). Confocal analysis showed Homer immunoreactivity at the postsynaptic microdomain of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) at bedrest start. After bedrest, Homer immunoreactivity decreased (CTR), remained unchanged (RE), or increased (RVE) at the NMJ. Homer2 mRNA and protein were differently regulated in a muscle-specific way. Activated NFATc1 translocates from cytoplasm to nucleus; increased amounts of NFATc1-immunopositive slow-type myonuclei were found in RVE myofibers of both muscles. Pulldown assays identified NFATc1 and Homer as molecular partners in skeletal muscle. A direct motor nerve control of Homer2 was confirmed in rat NMJs by in vivo denervation. Homer2 is localized at the NMJ and is part of the calcineurin-NFATc1 signaling pathway.

Here, we generated transgenic (Tg) mice expressing the A57G (alanine to glycine) mutation in the cardiac ELC known to cause familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC). The function of the ELC N-terminal extension was investigated with the Tg-Î43 mouse model, whose myocardium expresses a truncated ELC. Low-angle X-ray diffraction studies on papillary muscle fibers in rigor revealed a decreased interfilament spacing (â 1.5 nm) and no alterations in cross-bridge mass distribution in Tg-A57G mice compared to Tg-WT, expressing the full-length nonmutated ELC. The truncation mutation showed a 1.3-fold increase in I(1,1)/I(1,0), indicating a shift of cross-bridge mass from the thick filament backbone toward the thin filaments. Mechanical studies demonstrated increased stiffness in Tg-A57G muscle fibers compared to Tg-WT or Tg-Î43. The equilibrium constant for the cross-bridge force generation step was smallest in Tg-Î43. These results support an important role for the N-terminal ELC extension in prepositioning the cross-bridge for optimal force production. Subtle changes in the ELC sequence were sufficient to alter cross-bridge properties and lead to pathological phenotypes."

The reconstituted Na+-NQR or NqrA was eluted with 50 mm imidazole. Photoreactive azido-Qs possessing a biotin at the terminus of the side chain (see Fig. 1) were recently introduced for the specific labeling of a Q binding site in the alternative, non-electrogenic NADH dehydrogenase (Ndi1) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (12Murai M. Yamashita T. Senoh M. Mashimo Y. Kataoka M. Kosaka H. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Miyoshi H. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 2973-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The structures of 3-azido-2-methoxy-5-methyl-6-geranyl-1,4-benzoquinone (3-N3-Q2), 2-azido-3-methoxy-5-methyl-6-geranyl-1,4-benzoquinone (2-N3-Q2), and biotinylated 3-N3-Q2 (3-N3-Q-biotin) used in this work are shown in Fig. 1 (12Murai M. Yamashita T. Senoh M. Mashimo Y. Kataoka M. Kosaka H. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Miyoshi H. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 2973-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Na+-NQR or NqrA in 10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 8.0, 5% glycerol, 300 mm NaCl, 0.05% DDM was incubated with the quinone or the corresponding Q derivative for 30â60 min on ice in the dark. In a typical experiment, Na+-NQR (0.16 mg in 0.16 ml of buffer, or 4.8 Î¼m) was mixed with 1.5 Î¼l of the quinone stock solution (1 mm in ethanol; final concentration in the reaction mixture 9.4 Î¼m) in the darkroom. The sample was transferred to a quartz cuvette and illuminated with a 6-watt 365 nm UV lamp (Bachofer-LaboratoriumsgerÃ¤te) at 4 Â°C for the indicated times. Biotinylated proteins were detected by Western blot analysis using a Strep-Tactin horseradish peroxidase conjugate according to the procedures described by the supplier (IBA GmbH). The intensity of the NqrA band was quantified with the software Quantity One (Bio-Rad). NADH oxidation and quinone reduction by Na+-NQR were followed simultaneously under anoxic conditions at room temperature (4Tao M. Casutt M.S. Fritz G. Steuber J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of endogenous Q8 on enzymatic activity, NADH oxidation and Q reduction rates were determined with three preparations of the complex. An aliquot from each preparation was treated with LDAO, and the activities prior to and after removal of Q8 were compared. To study inactivation by modification with azido-quinones, Na+-NQR (3 Î¼m) was incubated with a 100-fold molar excess of 3-N3-Q2, 2-N3-Q2, or Q2 for 1 h at 0 Â°C in the dark under anoxic conditions. Modification was initiated by illumination at 365 nm (4 Â°C). At the indicated time points, aliquots were analyzed for enzymatic activity. Protein quantification, SDS-PAGE and immunochemical detection of His6-NqrA were performed as described (5Casutt M.S. Huber T. Brunisholz R. Tao M. Fritz G. Steuber J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 27088-27099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For MALDI-MS analyses of Na+-NQR subunits, the complex was precipitated by TCA and resuspended in hexafluoropropanol:formic acid (1:2). Aliquots were diluted 1:10 with matrix (saturated sinapinic acid in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 50% acetonitrile) and analyzed in linear mode on a Bruker Ultraflex II TOF-TOF instrument. Circular dichroism spectra were obtained at 25 Â°C with a JASCO 715 spectropolarimeter using quartz cuvettes (Hellma AG) with 1-mm path length. The CD spectra were recorded with 1-nm step width, 20 nm minâ1 scanning speed, 2-nm excitation bandwidth, and 4-s response time. Each spectrum was averaged at least twice, corrected by subtracting the spectrum of the buffer or ubiquinone-1 (Q1) in buffer, and further processed with the Savitzky-Golay filter. Q1 exhibited a weak CD signal in the region from 185 to 200 nm, which did not interfere with the effects observed upon the addition of Q1 to NqrA. Secondary structure fractions were calculated by deconvolution of the CD data at the DichroWeb server (13Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W668-W673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1953) Google Scholar, 14Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. Biopolymers. 2008; 89: 392-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar) using reference set 4 of the CDSSTR algorithm (15Compton L.A. Johnson Jr., W.C. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). SPR experiments were performed on a Biacore T100 instrument. NqrA was diluted in 10 mm acetate buffer at pH 5.4 to 1 Î¼m and coupled to the activated CM5 sensor chip surface (GE Healthcare) by standard procedures. This included blocking of the sensor surface with ethanolamine after immobilization of NqrA. The immobilization level was 16,500 RU. Q1 and 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide (HQNO) were diluted with PBS (10 mm Pi, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) from 20 mm stock solutions in DMSO to a concentration of 200 Î¼m, resulting in a final DMSO content of 1%. These solutions served as starting points of 1:1 dilution series leading to concentrations of 100.0, 50.0, 25.0, 12.5, 6.25, 3.13, 1.56, 0.78, 0.39, 0.20, and 0.098 Î¼m. Biosensor assays were carried out at 298 K, with 1% DMSO in PBS as running buffer, at a flow rate of 10 Î¼l/min and a data collection rate of 10 Hz. For each dilution, 85 Î¼l of Q1 or HQNO solution was injected, leading to an association time of 500 s. Dissociation was monitored for 500 s. After every injection, one regeneration injection was applied (1 m NaCl, 1% DMSO, 60 s). Sensorgrams were analyzed with Biacore T100 Control (v1.1), Biacore T100 Evaluation (v1.1), and Origin 8. This included reference cell and buffer subtraction. Each concentration was measured in duplicates from independent dilution series. Steady-state binding levels obtained from these dilution series were subjected to non-linear least squares fitting within Origin 8. Dissociation constants (KD) were determined by globally fitting all data points to one-site (RU(c) = RUmax Ã c/(KD+c)) and two-site (RU(c) = RUmax1 Ã c/(KD1+c) + RUmax2 Ã c/(KD2+c)) binding isotherms, respectively. In the latter case, RUmax1 of the high affinity interaction was optimized first. Subsequently, RUmax2 was set to the same value and kept fixed assuming the same maximum response when saturating one or the other binding site. Monomeric NqrA from gel filtration was transferred to D2O containing 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm NaN3 (PBS buffer) by repeated (at least 5-fold) ultrafiltration with Ultrafree-4 membranes (Millipore; molecular mass cut-off, 10 kDa). To 10 Î¼m NqrA, Q1, HQNO, or riboflavin was added from 20 mm stock solutions in DMSO-d6 to a final concentration of 100 Î¼m, and the sample was transferred to a 5-mm NMR tube. Controls were prepared with PBS buffer without NqrA. To assign the resonances of Q1, HQNO, and riboflavin, 1H, 1H-13C-HSQC, 1H-13C-HMBC, and two-dimensional-NOE spectroscopy NMR spectra were recorded at 300 K on a Bruker DRX 600-MHz spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm TXI-H/C/N-triple resonance probe. Spectra were referenced to the residual HDO signal at 4.707 ppm. Chemical shifts are given in supplemental Table S1. One-dimensional saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR spectra (16Mayer M. Meyer B. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1999; 38: 1784-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar) were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE III 600-MHz spectrometer equipped with a cryogenic 5-mm TCI-H/C/N triple resonance probe with actively shielded z-gradient. Water suppression was achieved by excitation sculpting (17Hwang T.L. Shaka A.J. J. Magn. Reson. Ser. A. 1995; 112: 275-279Crossref Scopus (1511) Google Scholar). Resonances of NqrA were saturated by applying a train of low power Gaussian-shaped pulses at 0.2 ppm with a total saturation time of 2 s. Off-resonance irradiation was set to 33 ppm. On- and off-resonance spectra were acquired in an interleaved manner and subtracted after processing. Up to 4096 transients were collected at a spectral width of 12 ppm. Spectra were processed and analyzed with the software TopSpin (Bruker; v2.1). The percentage of STD effects was determined within the multiple display mode by scaling the off-resonance spectrum down to superimpose with the signal of interest in the difference (off-on) spectrum. The interactions of the Na+-NQR with quinones and quinone derivatives (Fig. 1) were investigated. We first analyzed the quinone content of this membrane protein complex by HPLC. Na+-NQR purified in the presence of DDM contained 0.61 Â± 0.04 mol of Q8 molâ1 Na+-NQR (n = 3). A typical HPLC chromatogram is shown in supplemental Fig. S1. The identity of Q8 extracted from the Na+-NQR was confirmed by ESI-MS analysis (supplemental Fig. S2). Detergent exchange with LDAO completely removed Q8 from the complex (supplemental Fig. S1) without a significant effect on its Q reduction activity (23.5 Â± 3.8 units mgâ1 in the presence of enzyme-bound Q8 as compared with 19.1 Â± 0.2 units mgâ1 in the absence of enzyme-bound Q8; n = 3). Na+-NQR lacking Q8 showed a slight decrease in NADH oxidation rates (47.9 Â± 3.5 units mgâ1) as compared with complex containing Q8 (62.6 Â± 0.9 units mgâ1). This indicated that Q1 at a concentration of 100 Î¼m in the assay replaced Q8, most likely by binding to a Q site of the complex. To test the latter hypothesis, the Q8-depleted Na+-NQR, which was bound to a metal affinity column, was allowed to react with Q1 or Q2. Upon elution of the enzyme with buffer containing 0.1% DDM, these short-chain quinones were found to be associated with Na+-NQR at a molar ratio of 0.54, which was comparable with the initial amount of endogenous Q8 (supplemental Fig. S3, A and B). We also investigated the interaction of Q8-depleted Na+-NQR with the Q2 derivatives 2-N3-Q2 and 3-N3-Q2, which carry an azido group at the C-2 and C-3 carbon of the quinone head group, respectively, replacing the methoxy group (Fig. 1). Although 3-N3-Q2 was incorporated to a molar ratio (0.51) comparable with the one observed with Q1 and Q2, only 0.10 mol of 2-N3-Q2 was found per mol of Na+-NQR (supplemental Fig. S3C). We next used a biotinylated quinone derivative (3-N3-Q-biotin, Fig. 1) to identify a subunit of Na+-NQR interacting with quinones. Photocross-linking in the presence of 1â2 equivalents of 3-N3-Q-biotin resulted in the specific labeling of a protein with an approximate mass of 50 kDa (Fig. 2). It represented subunit NqrA, as confirmed by immunostaining using an antibody specific for the N-terminal polyhistidine tag. In addition, the biotinylated Î±-subunit of the oxaloacetate decarboxylase from V. cholerae with a mass of 65 kDa was detected (18Dahinden P. Auchli Y. Granjon T. Taralczak M. Wild M. Dimroth P. Arch. Microbiol. 2005; 183: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To test whether 3-N3-Q-biotin competes with Q8 for binding to NqrA, the photocross-linking of the Na+-NQR complexes purified in DDM (with stoichiometric Q8) and in LDAO (no Q8 present) was compared. Both the rate of modification and the final yield of biotin-modified NqrA were decreased with Q8-containing Na+-NQR by â¼50% (Fig. 2). This demonstrated that 3-N3-Q-biotin interacted with a specific Q binding site of subunit NqrA. Please note that the yield of photolabeling is less than 10% (12Murai M. Yamashita T. Senoh M. Mashimo Y. Kataoka M. Kosaka H. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Miyoshi H. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 2973-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Therefore, a major fraction of Q-sites occupied by 3-N3-Q-biotin will not undergo covalent modification. Na+-NQR, which had been illuminated in the presence of 3-N3-Q2, was analyzed by MALDI-MS, and its spectrum was compared with a spectrum of Na+-NQR, which was illuminated in the presence of Q1 (supplemental Fig. S4 and Table 1). Masses assigned to NqrE, NqrD, NqrC with its bound FMN, NqrB devoid of FMN, and NqrF lacking the 2Fe-2S cluster were detected in both samples. In the MS spectra of 3-N3-Q2-treated Na+-NQR, none of the signals was clearly shifted by 300 Da, as would be expected for covalent modification with azido-Q2 (19Matsumoto Y. Murai M. Fujita D. Sakamoto K. Miyoshi H. Yoshida M. Mogi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1905-1912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, peak j at 50,793 Da observed in Q1-treated Na+-NQR, which was assigned to NqrA (calculated mass, 50,660 Da), was not observed in 3-N3-Q2-treated Na+-NQR. On the other hand, peak k at 50,904 Da, which did not correspond to a calculated mass of any of the Nqr subunits, was shifted to higher m/z (51,020 Da) upon modification with 3-N3-Q2 (supplemental Fig. S4). These results suggested that some modification of NqrA by 3-N3-Q2 had occurred, in accord with the observed labeling of NqrA with biotinylated 3-N3-Q2. We did not detect a protein with the calculated mass of NqrA, m/z = 50,660 after the control reaction, which was performed in the presence of Q2. Obviously, NqrA experienced further chemical modifications either during photolabeling or during the MALDI ionization process. These modifications may very well be different for NqrA+Q1 as compared with NqrA+Azido-Q2. Nevertheless, the signals of â¼50,000 were the only ones affected by our photochemical labeling experiment, indicating that only NqrA was being labeled by the azido-quinone.TABLE 1Masses of protein species observed in Na+-NQR after labeling with 3-N3-Q2PeakMeasured massPredicted protein speciesCalculated massaCalculated mass of the predicted protein species.

Open table in a new tab To investigate the functional role of the quinone localized on subunit NqrA, we studied the effect of covalent modification of the Na+-NQR with azido-Q2 on enzymatic activity. The specific Q reductase activity of the Na+-NQR, which was allowed to react with 3-N3-Q2 for 60 min, decreased to 55% (9.1 Â± 0.2 Î¼mol minâ1 mgâ1) of the initial value (16.9 Â± 0.7 Î¼mol minâ1 mgâ1) (Fig. 3). Note that the difference in mean activity after a 60-min illumination of the 3-N3-Q2-treated NQR versus the untreated control was statistically significant, with p = 0.0046 (Student's t test, 95% confidence interval). Some minor inhibition (10%) was observed with Na+-NQR illuminated in the presence of Q2, which probably was caused by photolysis of flavins (20Penzer G.R. Radda G.K. Q. Rev. Chem. Soc. 1967; 21: 43-65Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar). HQNO (Fig. 1) is an inhibitor of Na+-NQR that prevents the binding of Q to the enzyme (21Pfenninger-Li X.D. Albracht S.P. van Belzen R. Dimroth P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6233-6242Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In a parallel reaction performed with a 100-fold molar excess of HQNO, Na+-NQR was inhibited by 45%. Interestingly, 2-N3-Q2 inactivated the Na+-NQR by only 20%, indicating that the azido group at the C-2 position of the quinone head group obstructed the binding of this Q derivative to NqrA. This is in accord with the observation that reconstitution of Q8-depleted Na+-NQR was significantly less efficient with 2-N3-Q2 (0.10 mol molâ1) than with 3-N3-Q2 (0.51 mol molâ1) (supplemental Fig. S3, A and B). We conclude that modification of NqrA with 3-N3-Q2 occurs at a site that, in the native enzyme, harbors at least one molecule of Q8 participating in electron transfer from NADH to Q1. We next investigated the interaction of NqrA with Q in the absence of other Nqr subunits. HPLC analyses of organic extracts of purified NqrA revealed only traces of endogenous Q8 (â¼0.01 mol of Q8 per mol of NqrA). This residual Q8 was removed by treatment with LDAO, and the protein was allowed to react with Q1 or Q2 as described for the Na+-NQR complex. Q1 and Q2 were incorporated into NqrA at molar ratios of 0.77 and 0.27 mol of quinone per mol of NqrA, respectively. The efficiency of reconstitution was clearly diminished with the more hydrophobic Q2. NqrA illuminated in the presence of 2 equivalents of 3-N3-Q-biotin was specifically labeled, as demonstrated by Western blot analysis. Binding of Q1 to NqrA was further confirmed by circular dichroism spectroscopy (Fig. 4). The addition of 15 Î¼m Q1 to NqrA led to an increase in ellipticity of â¼210 nm, which could indicate a decrease of the Î±-helical content from 15% in the absence of Q1 to 7% in the presence of Q1. As expected, Q1 (15 Î¼m) exhibited no features in the CD spectrum (Fig. 4). Note that the changes in the CD of â¼210 nm would also be consistent with a change in interhelical angles in NqrA upon binding of Q1 (22GagnÃ© S.M. Tsuda S. Li M.X. Chandra M. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1961-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). To support our results obtained by photochemical labeling and CD spectroscopy, we determined the affinity of the NqrA subunit toward ubiquinone Q1 and to the well known inhibitor HQNO by surface plasmon resonance (Biacore). For this purpose, NqrA was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip, and Q1 and HQNO served as soluble analytes. This assay setup allows for characterizing the interaction of chemically unmodified small molecule ligands with NqrA; however, for sensitivity reasons, very high immobilization levels of the"

https://openalex.org/W2001053819,"Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of histone proteins and methylation of DNA are major components of the epigenetic machinery that regulates the structure and dynamics of chromatin, gene transcription, DNA replication, DNA recombination, and DNA repair. The PTMs alter direct interactions between histones and DNA and serve as docking sites for epigenetic effectors. A number of PTMs have been identified in the flexible histone tails that protrude from the nucleosomal core and are readily accessible to histone acetyltransferases (HATs), histone deacetylases (HDACs), histone lysine methyltransferases (HKMTs), kinases, phosphatases, and other enzymes capable of depositing or removing PTMs. The list of PTMs is rapidly growing and includes acetylation, methylation, ubiquitination, and SUMOylation of lysine residues, methylation and citrullination of arginine residues, phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues, and ADP-ribosylation of glutamate and arginine residues.

The histone PTMs are recognized by protein modules, referred to as epigenetic effectors, histone-binding domains, or simply âreadersâ of PTMs. Binding of the effectors recruits or stabilizes various transcription factors, chromatin remodeling complexes, and other components of the transcriptional network at chromatin. Many chromatin-associating proteins contain multiple copies of an effector or several different effectors, often specific for distinct PTMs. This provides a multivalent mechanism for targeting to a particular genomic site and ensures the proper biological outcome. Furthermore, the effectors are commonly found in macromolecules that either possess catalytic activities or act as scaffolding proteins that tether multisubunit enzymatic complexes to chromatin. These, in turn, further modify the epigenetic landscape by âerasingâ PTMs, âwritingâ new epigenetic marks, or cleaving off the entire tail. This SnapShot shows the histone-binding effectors, their atomic-resolution structures, and the reported specificities for PTMs."
