https://openalex.org/W2076285924,"The tetraploid AABB genomic component of two varieties of common hexaploid wheat (AABBDD; 2n = 42) was reconstituted by a simple back-crossing technique in which known phylogenetic relationships between the hexaploid and tetraploid groups of Triticum were used. The reconstituted tetraploids do not closely resemble commonly described varieties of the present-day group of tetraploid species. The plants are dwarfed, lack vigor, and are partially or completely self-sterile, depending on the variety of the hexaploid source. Chromosome pairing is similar to that observed in a variety of durum wheat (AABB; 2n = 28). Synthetic hexaploids derived from hybrids between one of the reconstituted tetraploids and several strains of Aegilops squarrosa (D genome) are of normal growth and vigr and are highly fertile."
https://openalex.org/W1980688134,Thin plastic sieves with precisely controlled hole size and density can be made by irradiating plastic films with fission fragments and etching out the material traversed by the fragments. These filters may be used for the nondestructive separation of cells of closely similar sizes.

https://openalex.org/W2081679967,The use of a high-speed digital computer for investigation of neural firing patterns is described. The high sensitivity of the method permits detection of stimulus-response relations buried in a background of spontaneous activity.

https://openalex.org/W2111894652,"The fern Polypodium dispersum Evans (ined.) has a completely somatic alternation of generations. During sporogenesis the sporophyte exhibits 111 unpaired chromosomes, 16 spore mother cells, and 32 viable diplospores. The sporophyte arises by proliferation from a gametophyte lacking sex organs. This is the first completely documented report of this type of life cycle in the ferns."
https://openalex.org/W2117924456,"As an approximation based on various experiments reported in the literature, the least detectable difference in speed (delta w) varies in direct proportion to the speed (w) over a range from 0.1 to 20 degrees of visual angle per second. The constancy of the Weber ratio (deltaw/w) aids in understanding how men react to velocity in various situations."

https://openalex.org/W1994043498,"An acid of krypton is formed when krypton tetrafluoride is slowly hydrolyzed by ice at -30 degrees to -60 degrees C. The yield is 2 to 3 percent (mole). A barium salt of this acid, thermally stable at room temperature, is formed by the hydrolysis of krypton tetrafluoride with a 0.35N solution of barium hydroxide at O degrees to 5 degrees C in a yield of approximately 7 percent by weight."
https://openalex.org/W2040855798,"Field investigations in Ecuador have produced archeological evidence for the occupation of the northern Andes by early nomadic hunters. Surface collections and test excavations have demonstrated a complex of stone tools with typological relationships to level I at Fell's Cave in southern Chile, and technological relationships to the late Pleistocene ""fluted point"" complexes of North America. The date of these materials is estimated at 7000 to 8000 B.C."

https://openalex.org/W4239775862,"A natural, self-maintaining photoelectric cell, composed of a blue-green algal mat and bacteria as a layered ecosystem, was isolated from a shallow marine bay in Texas near Port Aransas. In daytime the open-circuit potential across the ecological membrane was about 0.43 volt. The efficiency of conversion of light energy to organic potential energy before maintenance was 1.62 percent and to external electrical energy at optimum power loading was 0.016 percent, a flow analogous to a consumer population."

https://openalex.org/W2060910103,"Data on the effectiveness of the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study course were obtained from several sources, including experimental use with 65,000 students. Any of the three versions of this biology course can be taught to average and above-average 10th-grade students. Achievement on the associated comprehensive test is more closely related to the ability and sex of the student, the salary of the teacher, the proportion of graduates of the school who go to college, the size of the class, and the adequacy of laboratory facilities than to the version of the course."

https://openalex.org/W2090756079,"Typical insect stretch receptors and receptor-like organs present in larvae of Sarcophaga bullata and other flies contain associated cells which are suspected of passing secretory products into ""target"" organs by way of strands of connective tissue. In the fly larva, such organs are attached to leg rudiments, tracheal discs, muscles, the genital disc and gonads, and may be concerned with the neuroendocrine control of metamorphosis of these structures."
