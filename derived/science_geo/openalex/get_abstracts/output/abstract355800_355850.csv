https://openalex.org/W2157464285,"Recently, activation-dependant structural brain plasticity in humans has been demonstrated in adults after three months of training a visio-motor skill. Learning three-ball cascade juggling was associated with a transient and highly selective increase in brain gray matter in the occipito-temporal cortex comprising the motion sensitive area hMT/V5 bilaterally. However, the exact time-scale of usage-dependant structural changes occur is still unknown. A better understanding of the temporal parameters may help to elucidate to what extent this type of cortical plasticity contributes to fast adapting cortical processes that may be relevant to learning.Using a 3 Tesla scanner and monitoring whole brain structure we repeated and extended our original study in 20 healthy adult volunteers, focussing on the temporal aspects of the structural changes and investigated whether these changes are performance or exercise dependant. The data confirmed our earlier observation using a mean effects analysis and in addition showed that learning to juggle can alter gray matter in the occipito-temporal cortex as early as after 7 days of training. Neither performance nor exercise alone could explain these changes.We suggest that the qualitative change (i.e. learning of a new task) is more critical for the brain to change its structure than continued training of an already-learned task."
https://openalex.org/W2101221243,"Greg Barsh and colleagues show that two loci for dark skin in mice result from mutations in Rps19 and Rps20, encoding the ribosomal proteins S19 and S20. They further show that the dark skin phenotype and other pleiotropic effects of these mutations, including reduced erythrocyte count and body size, are mediated through stabilization of p53. Mutations in genes encoding ribosomal proteins cause the Minute phenotype in Drosophila and mice, and Diamond-Blackfan syndrome in humans. Here we report two mouse dark skin (Dsk) loci caused by mutations in Rps19 (ribosomal protein S19) and Rps20 (ribosomal protein S20). We identify a common pathophysiologic program in which p53 stabilization stimulates Kit ligand expression, and, consequently, epidermal melanocytosis via a paracrine mechanism. Accumulation of p53 also causes reduced body size and erythrocyte count. These results provide a mechanistic explanation for the diverse collection of phenotypes that accompany reduced dosage of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, and have implications for understanding normal human variation and human disease."
https://openalex.org/W1966448483,"Acidification of the phagosome is a key mechanism thought to be used by macrophages against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The authors identify a previously undescribed gene that confers acid resistance to the bacterium and is essential for virulence ( pages 809–810 ). Acidification of the phagosome is considered to be a major mechanism used by macrophages against bacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Mtb blocks phagosome acidification1, but interferon-γ (IFN-γ) restores acidification and confers antimycobacterial activity2,3. Nonetheless, it remains unclear whether acid kills Mtb, whether the intrabacterial pH of any pathogen falls when it is in the phagosome and whether acid resistance is required for mycobacterial virulence. In vitro at pH 4.5, Mtb survived in a simple buffer and maintained intrabacterial pH. Therefore, Mtb resists phagolysosomal concentrations of acid. Mtb also maintained its intrabacterial pH and survived when phagocytosed by IFN-γ–activated macrophages. We used transposon mutagenesis to identify genes responsible for Mtb's acid resistance. A strain disrupted in Rv3671c, a previously uncharacterized gene encoding a membrane-associated protein, was sensitive to acid and failed to maintain intrabacterial pH in acid in vitro and in activated macrophages. Growth of the mutant was also severely attenuated in mice. Thus, Mtb is able to resist acid, owing in large part to Rv3671c, and this resistance is essential for virulence. Disruption of Mtb's acid resistance and intrabacterial pH maintenance systems is an attractive target for chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2064497209,"In horses, graying with age is an autosomal dominant trait associated with a high incidence of melanoma and vitiligo-like depigmentation. Here we show that the Gray phenotype is caused by a 4.6-kb duplication in intron 6 of STX17 (syntaxin-17) that constitutes a cis-acting regulatory mutation. Both STX17 and the neighboring NR4A3 gene are overexpressed in melanomas from Gray horses. Gray horses carrying a loss-of-function mutation in ASIP (agouti signaling protein) had a higher incidence of melanoma, implying that increased melanocortin-1 receptor signaling promotes melanoma development in Gray horses. The Gray horse provides a notable example of how humans have cherry-picked mutations with favorable phenotypic effects in domestic animals."
https://openalex.org/W2040882581,"The actin cytoskeleton has been implicated in restricting diffusion of plasma membrane components. Here, simultaneous observations of quantum dot-labelled FcɛRI motion and GFP-tagged actin dynamics provide direct evidence that actin filament bundles define micron-sized domains that confine mobile receptors. Dynamic reorganization of actin structures occurs over seconds, making the location and dimensions of actin-defined domains time-dependent. Multiple FcɛRI often maintain extended close proximity without detectable correlated motion, suggesting that they are co-confined within membrane domains. FcɛRI signalling is activated by crosslinking with multivalent antigen. We show that receptors become immobilized within seconds of crosslinking. Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton results in delayed immobilization kinetics and increased diffusion of crosslinked clusters. These results implicate actin in membrane partitioning that not only restricts diffusion of membrane proteins, but also dynamically influences their long-range mobility, sequestration and response to ligand binding."
https://openalex.org/W2170722828,"Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) is a highly conserved and ubiquitous protein that is reported to provide cytoprotection in various cell types and tissues. However, the importance of Hsp70 expression during skeletal muscle atrophy, when Hsp70 levels are significantly decreased, is not known. The current study aimed to determine whether plasmid-mediated overexpression of Hsp70, in the soleus muscle of rats, was sufficient to regulate specific atrophy signaling pathways and attenuate skeletal muscle disuse atrophy. We found that Hsp70 overexpression prevented disuse muscle fiber atrophy and inhibited the increased promoter activities of atrogin-1 and MuRF1. Importantly, the transcriptional activities of Foxo3a and NF-kappaB, which are implicated in the regulation of atrogin-1 and MuRF1, were abolished by Hsp70. These data suggest that Hsp70 may regulate key atrophy genes through inhibiting Foxo3a and NF-kappaB activities during disuse. Indeed, we show that specific inhibition of Foxo3a prevented the increases in both atrogin-1 and MuRF1 promoter activities during disuse. However, inhibition of NF-kappaB did not affect the activation of either promoter, suggesting its requirement for disuse atrophy is through its regulation of other atrophy genes. We conclude that overexpression of Hsp70 is sufficient to inhibit key atrophy signaling pathways and prevent skeletal muscle atrophy."

https://openalex.org/W2152705320,"The function of dopamine D(3) receptors present in the striatum has remained elusive. In the present study evidence is provided for the existence of dopamine D(1)-D(3) receptor heteromers and for an intramembrane D(1)-D(3) receptor cross-talk in living cells and in the striatum. The formation of D(1)-D(3) receptor heteromers was demonstrated by fluorescence resonance energy transfer and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer techniques in transfected mammalian cells. In membrane preparations from these cells, a synergistic D(1)-D(3) intramembrane receptor-receptor interaction was observed, by which D(3) receptor stimulation enhances D(1) receptor agonist affinity, indicating that the D(1)-D(3) intramembrane receptor-receptor interaction is a biochemical characteristic of the D(1)-D(3) receptor heteromer. The same biochemical characteristic was also observed in membrane preparations from brain striatum, demonstrating the striatal co-localization and heteromerization of D(1) and D(3) receptors. According to the synergistic D(1)-D(3) intramembrane receptor-receptor interaction, experiments in reserpinized mice showed that D(3) receptor stimulation potentiates D(1) receptor-mediated behavioral effects by a different mechanism than D(2) receptor stimulation. The present study shows that a main functional significance of the D(3) receptor is to obtain a stronger dopaminergic response in the striatal neurons that co-express the two receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2135369641,"Many plants and animals are defended from predation or herbivory by inhibitory secondary metabolites, which in the marine environment are very common among sessile organisms. Among bacteria, where there is the greatest metabolic potential, little is known about chemical defenses against bacterivorous consumers. An emerging hypothesis is that sessile bacterial communities organized as biofilms serve as bacterial refuge from predation. By testing growth and survival of two common bacterivorous nanoflagellates, we find evidence that chemically mediated resistance against protozoan predators is common among biofilm populations in a diverse set of marine bacteria. Using bioassay-guided chemical and genetic analysis, we identified one of the most effective antiprotozoal compounds as violacein, an alkaloid that we demonstrate is produced predominately within biofilm cells. Nanomolar concentrations of violacein inhibit protozoan feeding by inducing a conserved eukaryotic cell death program. Such biofilm-specific chemical defenses could contribute to the successful persistence of biofilm bacteria in various environments and provide the ecological and evolutionary context for a number of eukaryote-targeting bacterial metabolites."

https://openalex.org/W2029058626,"Most cell types acquire cholesterol by endocytosis of circulating low density lipoprotein, but little is known about the mechanisms of intra-endosomal cholesterol transport and about the primary cause of its aberrant accumulation in the cholesterol storage disorder Niemann-Pick type C (NPC). Here we report that lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA), an unconventional phospholipid that is only detected in late endosomes, regulates endosomal cholesterol levels under the control of Alix/AlP1, which is an LBPA-interacting protein involved in sorting into multivesicular endosomes. We find that Alix down-expression decreases both LBPA levels and the lumenal vesicle content of late endosomes. Cellular cholesterol levels are also decreased, presumably because the storage capacity of endosomes is affected and thus cholesterol clearance accelerated. Both lumenal membranes and cholesterol can be restored in Alix knockdown cells by exogenously added LBPA. Conversely, we also find that LBPA becomes limiting upon pathological cholesterol accumulation in NPC cells, because the addition of exogenous LBPA, but not of LBPA isoforms or analogues, partially reverts the NPC phenotype. We conclude that LBPA controls the cholesterol capacity of endosomes.

A hallmark of endosomes along this degradation pathway is their multivesicular appearance due to the accumulation of intralumenal vesicles. These incorporate down-regulated receptors (1Hurley J.H.

Stang E. Fang K.S. de Moerloose P. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nature. 1998; 392: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). In addition to their presence in intralumenal vesicles, LBPA and cholesterol have been linked functionally. Both are affected by sterol carrier protein-2 expression (6Gallegos A.M. Atshaves B.P. Storey S. Schoer J. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2002; 116: 19-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Moreover, LBPA plays a role in cholesterol transport (7Kobayashi T.

Some relationship between cholesterol and LBPA has also been revealed in the cholesterol storage disorder Niemann-Pick type C caused by mutations in NPC1 or NPC2, whose precise functions are not known (8Ikonen E.

In tissues from NPC patients, cholesterol accumulation is paralleled by the accumulation of LBPA and other lipids, in particular sphingolipids (8Ikonen E. Holtta-Vuori M. Semin. Cell Dev.

We previously found that LBPA functions may be controlled by Alix, which binds LBPA-containing bilayers (13Matsuo H. Chevallier J. Mayran N. Le Blanc I. Ferguson C. Faure J. Blanc N.S. Matile S. Dubochet J. Sadoul R. Parton R.G. Vilbois F. Gruenberg J. Science. 2004; 303: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Alix is involved in sorting into multivesicular endosomes (14Odorizzi G. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3025-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 15Dikic I.

Moreover, both Alix and LBPA also play a role in intralumenal vesicle fission from and fusion with the endosome limiting membrane (13Matsuo H. Chevallier J. Mayran N. Le Blanc I. Ferguson C. Faure J.

Here we report that Alix down-expression decreases both the lumenal membrane content of late endosomes and their LBPA level, whereas the cellular cholesterol level is reduced, presumably because the endosomal storage capacity is affected.

We conclude that LBPA controls the cholesterol storage capacity of endosomes. Cells and Reagents—Baby hamster kidney cells (BHK-21), HeLa cells, and NPC skin fibroblasts were maintained as described previously (7Kobayashi T. Beuchat M.H. Lindsay M. Frias S. Palmiter R.D.

Howell K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1301-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). We previously described the synthesis of enantiopure 2,2′- and 3,3′-dioleoyl-LBPA (13Matsuo H.

Lett. 2005; 7: 3837-3840Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Other lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. We also previously described the 6C4 monoclonal antibody against LBPA (5Kobayashi T. Stang E. Fang K.S. de Moerloose P. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nature. 1998; 392: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibodies against a cytoplasmic (P5D4) (21Kreis T.E. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 931-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) or exoplasmic (17.2.21.4) (22Gruenberg J. Howell K.E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 38: 312-321PubMed Google Scholar) VSV G-protein epitope were described, as well as the polyclonal antibody against G-protein (22Gruenberg J. Howell K.E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 38: 312-321PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-apolipoprotein A2 was purchased from Biodesign International (Saco, ME). Reagents were obtained from the following sources: anti-mouse Dynabeads from Dynal (Oslo, Norway); n-octylpolyoxyethylene from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland); silencer siRNA labeling kit Cy3 from Ambion, Inc. (Huntingdon, UK); fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies from Jackson ImmunoResearch; R18 from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR); TRIzol from Invitrogen; and U18666A (3-β-[2-(diethylamino)ethoxy]androst-5-en-17-one) from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Analysis of the Genomic Sequence of ALIX siRNA Target in Hamster Cells—RNA from BHK or HeLa cells was extracted with TRIzol according to the manufacturer's instructions. Then 0.5 μg of total RNA was used for reverse transcription with Superscript™RT (Invitrogen) using random hexamer. The transcribed DNA was subjected to TaqMan reverse transcription-PCR using two primers (forward primer, 5′ GGT GCA GCT GAA GAA GAC CT 3′; reverse primer, 5′ CAG GTT CTG CTC TGC AAT 3′). For TaqMan real time PCR, we used the ICycler.IQ™ (Bio-Rad). Specific PCR bands were excised and purified. The DNA was cloned into a TOPO vector, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). TOP10 bacteria were then transformed and grown; DNA was isolated and then sequenced for analysis by Fasteris SA (Geneva, Switzerland). Microscopy—The analysis of cholesterol distribution after filipin staining by fluorescence microscopy was described, as was the analysis of LBPA (7Kobayashi T. Beuchat M.H. Lindsay M. Frias S. Palmiter R.D. Sakuraba H. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) or other antigens (17Le Blanc I. Luyet P.-P. Pons V. Ferguson C.

To visualize the content of late endosomes by electron microscopy, HRP was endocytosed for 15 min at 37 °C and then chased for 30 min in marker-free medium (18Gruenberg J. Griffiths G. Howell K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1301-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Cells were then fixed, and HRP was revealed cytochemically with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as substrate and processed for plastic embedding (23Parton R.G. Schrotz P. Bucci C. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 335-348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Micrographs were taken at random across the monolayer, and then sets of micrographs were analyzed in a blind fashion by an independent observer. Proteoliposomes Containing VSV-G Protein and LBPA—The major LBPA (>90%) isoform in BHK is 2,2′-dioleoyl-LBPA (5Kobayashi T. Stang E. Fang K.S. de Moerloose P. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J.

Org. Lett. 2000; 2: 1859-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and used to prepare liposomes by reverse phase evaporation with a phospholipid composition (DOPC/DOPE/LBPA, 60:20:20 mol) similar to that of late endosomes, where LBPA normally resides (5Kobayashi T. Stang E. Fang K.S. de Moerloose P. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nature. 1998; 392: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Because living cells do not take up liposomes efficiently, the G-glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G) was incorporated into the liposomes, to increase cell surface binding and targeting to the endocytic pathway. Thus, liposome delivery was independent of the lipid composition. To prepare the G-protein, purified VSV (800 μg) was sedimented for 2 h at 4 °C in a TLA100.3 centrifuge at 90,000 rpm. The supernatant was carefully discarded. The white pellet was resuspended in 0.6 ml of 0.1% n-octylpolyoxyethylene in HBS (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl), by 6-8 passages through a yellow tip until the solution became clear. Then the tubes were gently mixed at room temperature on a rotary wheel (4 rpm) (in 0.6 ml) for 1 h to facilitate detergent extraction of the G-protein. The mixture was then centrifuged at 4 °C for 1 h at 50,000 rpm (TLA 100.3) to separate soluble and nonsoluble materials. The supernatants were collected, dialyzed six times against 250 ml of HBS at 4 °C to remove the detergent, and used to prepare proteoliposomes or aliquoted, flash-frozen in liquid N2, and stored at -90 °C. Lipsomes were prepared by reverse phase evaporation (13Matsuo H. Chevallier J. Mayran N. Le Blanc I. Ferguson C. Faure J. Blanc N.S. Matile S. Dubochet J. Sadoul R. Parton R.G. Vilbois F. Gruenberg J. Science. 2004; 303: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar), after dissolving lipids in CHCl3, and mixed at the following molar ratios: DOPC/DOPE (60:40 mol); DOPC/DOPE/cholesterol (60:20:20 mol); DOPC/DOPE/LBPA (60:20:20 mol); and DOPC/GM3 (70:30 mol). Lipids (total ≈10 mg) were then dried under reduced pressure and dissolved in 1.5 ml of water-saturated diethyl ether and 0.5 ml of HBS (aqueous phase) containing ≈50 μg of G-glycoprotein (equivalent to ≈200 μg of VSV with G = 26% of VSV mass). In some experiments, 10 μm R18, a lipophylic fluorescent dye, was added. The mixture was vortexed and then sonicated continuously for 3 min on ice with a probe-type sonicator (Sonifier 250, Branson) set on power 3. Diethyl ether was then evaporated slowly at 600 mbar for 30-60 min under nitrogen flux on a rotatory evaporator, until lipids become oily. Then 1 ml of HBS (containing the fluorescent dye, if necessary) was added, and the solution was evaporated twice for 30 min on a rotatory evaporator at a 500-mbar pressure and then at 300 mbar until no smell of ether was detected, indicating that full reversion had occurred. When needed, we quantified R18 (excitation 560 nm; emission 585 nm) incorporation into liposomes with a SPECTRAmax GEMINI XS spectrophotometer and SOFTmax Pro (Molecular Devices), as described previously (13Matsuo H. Chevallier J. Mayran N. Le Blanc I. Ferguson C. Faure J. Blanc N.S. Matile S. Dubochet J. Sadoul R. Parton R.G. Vilbois F. Gruenberg J. Science. 2004; 303: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). When living cells (grown in 6-cm diameter Petri dishes) were treated with liposomes, the growth medium was replaced by 3 ml of Glascow minimum essential medium containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin, which was then complemented with 100 μl of the desired liposome preparation (0.66 mg of total lipid). The same operation was then repeated every 2 h, until the end of the incubation (after 8 h). To quantify the incorporation of VSV-G and to determine its trans-bilayer orientation, proteoliposomes (prepared by reverse phase evaporation as above) were immunopurified using Dynabeads coated with antibodies against an exoplasmic (17.2.21.4) or cytoplasmic (P5D4) epitope of the G-protein (18Gruenberg J. Griffiths G. Howell K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1301-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Similarly, we analyzed the antigenicity of LBPA incorporated into liposomes by incubating 50 μl of the liposome preparation with 15 μl of anti-LBPA antibody in 135 μl of HBS for 3 h at 4 °C. Then the antibody bound to liposomes was separated from free antibody by floatation in a step sucrose gradient (17Le Blanc I. Luyet P.-P. Pons V. Ferguson C. Emans N. Petiot A. Mayran N. Demaurex N. Fauré J. Sadoul R. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In each case, samples were analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions, followed by Western blotting using a polyclonal antibody against VSV-G to detect the G-protein or anti-mouse antibodies to detect the anti-LBPA antibody. To determine the pH-dependent fusion properties of liposomes, we used the following: 1) as acceptor, DOPC/DOPE/LBPA (60:20:20) liposomes containing the G-protein; 2) as donor containing R18, liposomes were passed through a PD-10 Sephadex G-25 column (Amersham Biosciences) to remove the nonencapsulated dye R18. Then 100 μl of donor R18-liposomes were mixed at 4 °C with 50 μl of acceptor liposomes and 50 μl of HBS (neutral conditions) or 50 μl of Tris maleic acid, pH 5.6, in 150 mm NaCl (acidic conditions). The temperature was raised to 22 °C, and the emitted fluorescence (excitation, 560; emission 585) was measured over 90 min with a Photon Technology International fluorimeter (710 Photomultiplier system detection and LPS 220 lamp). Other Methods—SDS-gel electrophoresis (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and the quantification of LBPA by ELISA (5Kobayashi T. Stang E.

Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 1068-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were described. Down-regulation of Alix expression in BHK cells with siRNAs was as described in HeLa cells (13Matsuo H. Chevallier J. Mayran N. Le Blanc I. Ferguson C. Faure J. Blanc N.S. Matile S. Dubochet J. Sadoul R. Parton R.G. Vilbois F. Gruenberg J.

Gene expression was quantified from HeLa cells submitted or not to Alix siRNAs. For each condition, RNA was purified from two independent 10-cm dishes using the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen). Reverse transcription-PCR was performed using the Superscript II kit (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) primer (Promega). The following amplification was made on an i-cycler (Bio-Rad) with the Quantitect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen). The Quantitect Primers (Qiagen) for the following genes were used: SREBPF2, DHC7R, ACTB, HMGCR, SDHA, LDLR, and PDCD6IP (Alix). Formation of Intralumenal Membranes—To investigate LBPA functions in cholesterol storage and transport, we silenced Alix expression in BHK cells (supplemental Fig. S1A), because we had characterized LBPA in these cells. We had determined the atomic composition of the BHK major (>90%) LBPA isoform as 2,2′-dioleoyl-LBPA (supplemental Fig. S1B). We had also characterized the subcellular distribution and late endosomal content of LBPA (15 mol % of total phospholipids) in BHK cells (5Kobayashi T. Stang E. Fang K.S. de Moerloose P. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nature. 1998; 392: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 19Chevallier J. Sakai N. Robert F. Kobayashi T. Gruenberg J. Matile S. Org.

Chem. 2002; 277: 32157-32164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1C). Upon Alix knockdown (Fig. 1C, inset), the LBPA staining intensity was decreased (Fig. 1A), as observed by others (27Cabezas A. Bache K.G. Brech A. Stenmark H. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2625-2635Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and us (13Matsuo H. Chevallier J. Mayran N. Le Blanc I. Ferguson C. Faure J. Blanc N.S. Matile S. Dubochet J. Sadoul R. Parton R.G. Vilbois F. Gruenberg J. Science. 2004; 303: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar) in human cells, as was the LBPA content of late endosomal fractions (Fig. 1C). Because LBPA is a major phospholipid of late endosome lumenal membranes (5Kobayashi T. Stang E. Fang K.S. de Moerloose P. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nature. 1998; 392: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) and because it is decreased by Alix knockdown, we wondered whether the ultrastructure of late endosomes was affected in Alix knockdown cells. To this end, the lumen of late endosomes was labeled with endocytosed HRP pulsed for 15 min and then chased for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then processed for HRP cytochemistry and electron microscopy, and micrographs taken at random were analyzed in a blind fashion. In control, mock-treated cells, HRP-labeled late endosomes contained numerous lumenal inclusions and vesicles, exhibiting the characteristic multivesicular ultrastructure of this compartment in BHK cells (18Gruenberg J. Griffiths G. Howell K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1301-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D). By contrast, in Alix knockdown cells, HRP-positive endosomes appeared like empty vacuoles with a few internal vesicles (Fig. 1E), consistent with observations that LBPA levels are then reduced (Fig. 1, A-C). These data agree well with our previous findings that Alix knockdown in HeLa cells reduces LBPA levels and the number of multilamellar late endosomes that are typical for these cells (13Matsuo H. Chevallier J. Mayran N. Le Blanc I. Ferguson C. Faure J. Blanc N.S. Matile S. Dubochet J. Sadoul R. Parton R.G. Vilbois F. Gruenberg J. Science. 2004; 303: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Alix and Cholesterol—We then investigated whether cholesterol was affected in Alix knockdown cells, because LBPA and cholesterol are linked functionally (6Gallegos A.M. Atshaves B.P. Storey S. Schoer J. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2002; 116: 19-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 8Ikonen E. Holtta-Vuori M. Semin. Cell Dev.

Genet. 2003; 64: 269-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) and because LBPA and cholesterol are both present in intralumenal endosomal vesicles, although perhaps in different subpopulations (3Mobius W. van Donselaar E. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Shimada Y. Heijnen H.F. Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Traffic. 2003; 4: 222-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 28Sobo K. Chevallier J. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. van der Goot F.G. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e391Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Upon filipin staining of mock-treated control cells, cholesterol was mostly present at the plasma membrane by light microscopy but was also faintly detected in intracellular structures, presumably trans-Golgi network and endosomes (Fig. 1A), as expected (8Ikonen E. Holtta-Vuori M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 29Maxfield F.R. Tabas I. Nature. 2005; 438: 612-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). Strikingly, the overall cholesterol staining intensity decreased in Alix knockdown cells concomitantly with decreased LBPA staining (Fig. 1A), and biochemical quantification showed that, much like LBPA, the total cellular cholesterol was then reduced by ≈30% (Fig. 1B). We could rule out the possibility that decreased cholesterol levels were because of an inhibition of LDL endocytosis, because Alix knockdown does not affect endocytosis nor transport along the endocytic pathway toward late endosomes and lysosomes or lysosomal degradation (13Matsuo H. Chevallier J. Mayran N. Le Blanc I. Ferguson C. Faure J. Blanc N.S. Matile S. Dubochet J. Sadoul R. Parton R.G. Vilbois F. Gruenberg J.

Biol. 2004; 24: 8981-8993Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Similarly, Alix knockdown did not seem to affect de novo cholesterol synthesis, because the expression of genes involved in cholesterol synthesis and accumulation was unchanged (supplemental Fig. S2). Alternatively, Alix down-expression, with a concomitant depletion of LBPA (Fig. 1, A-C) and loss of lumenal membranes (Fig. 1E), may affect the capacity of multivesicular endosomes to store or retain cholesterol. This may affect NPC1 functions in cholesterol transport, because NPC1 is normally present both in intralumenal vesicles and on the limiting membrane of multivesicular endosomes (31Frolov A.

In turn, this may alter cellular cholesterol levels, because endosomal and cellular cholesterol levels are interdependent (29Maxfield F.R. Tabas I. Nature. 2005; 438: 612-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). Upon release from endosomes, perhaps via NPC1 and NPC2, as well as ABCA1 (32Neufeld E.B. Stonik J.A. Demosky Jr., S.J.

We could not measure cholesterol in the medium, because of the necessary presence of fetal calf serum in these RNA interference experiments. However, we hypothesized that in the absence of Alix and LBPA, cholesterol may be inefficiently retained in endosomes, and thus cellular clearance may be accelerated. Cholesterol Accumulation—To test whether Alix and LBPA may play a role in cholesterol clearance from endosomes, we made use of U18666A, a drug that mimics the NPC phenotype by causing acute accumulation of LDL-derived cholesterol in the late endosomes of cells with a nonpathological genetic background (7Kobayashi T. Beuchat M.H. Lindsay M. Frias S. Palmiter R.D. Sakuraba H. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 38Liscum L. Faust J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11796-11806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, A and B). Interestingly, LBPA and cholesterol levels changed concomitantly in U18666A-treated cells. Like cholesterol, LBPA increased in U18666A-treated cells incubated in the presence of serum (Fig. 2B). Conversely, cholesterol did not accumulate in U18666A-treated cells incubated in serum-free medium (Fig. 2B), as expected (38Liscum L. Faust J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11796-11806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LBPA similarly showed no increase in U18666A-treated cells incubated in serum-free medium (Fig. 2B), demonstrating that LBPA accumulation in U18666A-treated cells did not result from some effects of the drug on lipid neo-synthesis, and further confirm the notion that LB"

This study reveals that disrupting the expression of a gustatory receptor (Gr32a) causes flies to exhibit enhanced courtship behavior towards males and equivalent reactions to mated or virgin females, establishing Gr32a as a receptor for inhibitory courtship pheromones. In male Drosophila, chemosensory cues control many aspects of social behavior. We found that males with a mutated Gustatory receptor 32a gene (Gr32a) show high courtship toward males and mated females, indicating that GR32a functions as a pheromone receptor for a male inhibitory pheromone. Notably, we discovered that tarsal Gr32a-expressing neurons were essential for courtship suppression and projected to the ventrolateral protocerebrum, implying direct communication of chemosensory neurons with a higher-order brain structure."
https://openalex.org/W1975155714,"The lumen of endosomal organelles becomes increasingly acidic when going from the cell surface to lysosomes. Luminal pH thereby regulates important processes such as the release of internalized ligands from their receptor or the activation of lysosomal enzymes. The main player in endosomal acidification is the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase), a multi-subunit transmembrane complex that pumps protons from the cytoplasm to the lumen of organelles, or to the outside of the cell. The active V-ATPase is composed of two multi-subunit domains, the transmembrane V(0) and the cytoplasmic V(1). Here we found that the ratio of membrane associated V(1)/Vo varies along the endocytic pathway, the relative abundance of V(1) being higher on late endosomes than on early endosomes, providing an explanation for the higher acidity of late endosomes. We also found that all membrane-bound V-ATPase subunits were associated with detergent resistant membranes (DRM) isolated from late endosomes, raising the possibility that association with lipid-raft like domains also plays a role in regulating the activity of the proton pump. In support of this, we found that treatment of cells with U18666A, a drug that leads to the accumulation of cholesterol in late endosomes, affected acidification of late endosome. Altogether our findings indicate that the activity of the vATPase in the endocytic pathway is regulated both by reversible association/dissociation and the interaction with specific lipid environments."

Because SOCE was first proposed two decades ago, many studies have been devoted to the identification of the mechanisms that communicate the Ca2+ stores with the plasma membrane (PM) channels, as well as the nature of store-operated Ca2+ (SOC) channels. The first identified and best-characterized store-operated current is ICRAC, but a number of other SOC currents activated by Ca2+ store depletion have also been described (2Parekh A.B.

A. 2007; 104: 4682-4687Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar); however, it remains unclear whether hTRPC1 interacts directly with STIM1 or through Orai1 and whether the heteromeric Orai1-TRPC1 interaction forms a channel sensitive to store depletion independently of STIM1. In the present study we have investigated the interaction of endogenously expressed Orai1 with STIM1 and hTRPC1 at resting conditions and upon store depletion either by pharmacological tools or with the physiological agonist thrombin. In addition, we have investigated the role of the STIM1-Orai1 interaction on SOCE and the mode of activation of hTRPC1-forming channels. Our results indicate that Ca2+ store depletion stimulates rapid and transient interaction between Orai1 and both, STIM1 and hTRPC1. Electrotransjection with anti-Orai1 COOH terminus antibody or treatment with jasplakinolide (JP) prevented the interaction of STIM1 with Orai1 and hTRPC1, reduced SOCE, and changed the mode of activation of hTRPC1-forming channels.

Apyrase (grade VII), aspirin, thrombin, thapsigargin (TG), leupeptin, benzamidine, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, SDS, anti-actin antibody, rabbit anti-Orai antibody (COOH-terminal), and bovine serum albumin were from Sigma. Anti-STIM1 antibody was from BD Transduction Laboratories (Franklin Lakes, NJ). Ionomycin and 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG) were from Calbiochem (Madrid, Spain).

Enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents were from Pierce. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Platelet Preparation—Platelet suspensions were prepared as previously described (22López J.J. Camello-Almaraz C. Pariente J.A. Salido G.M. Rosado J.A. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) as approved by Local Ethical Committees and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Briefly, blood was obtained from healthy drug-free volunteers and mixed with one-sixth volume of acid/citrate dextrose anti-coagulant containing (in mm): 85 sodium citrate, 78 citric acid, and 111 d-glucose. Platelet-rich plasma was then prepared by centrifugation for 5 min at 700 × g and aspirin (100 μm) and apyrase (40 μg/ml) were added. Platelets were then collected by centrifugation at 350 × g for 20 min and resuspended in HEPES-buffered saline (HBS), pH 7.45, containing (in mm): 145 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 10 d-glucose, 5 KCl, 1 MgSO4 and supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 40 μg/ml apyrase. Cell viability was assessed using calcein and trypan blue. For calcein loading, platelets were incubated for 30 min with 5 μm calcein-AM at 37 °C, centrifuged, and the pellet was resuspended in fresh HBS. Fluorescence was recorded from 2-ml aliquots using a Cary Eclipse spectrophotometer (Varian Ltd., Madrid, Spain). Samples were excited at 494 nm and the resulting fluorescence was measured at 535 nm. The results obtained with calcein were confirmed using the trypan blue exclusion technique. 95% of platelets were viable in our preparations. Measurement of Intracellular Free Calcium Concentration ([Ca2+]i)—Human platelets were loaded with fura-2 by incubation with 2 μm fura-2/AM for 45 min at 37 °C. Fluorescence was recorded from 2-ml aliquots of magnetically stirred cellular suspension (2 × 108 platelets/ml) at 37 °C using a Cary Eclipse spectrophotometer (Varian Ltd.) with excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm and emission at 505 nm. Changes in [Ca2+]i were monitored using the fura-2 340/380 fluorescence ratio and calibrated according to a established method (23Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Ca2+ entry was estimated using the integral of the rise in [Ca2+]i for 2.5 min after addition of CaCl2 (22López J.J. Camello-Almaraz C. Pariente J.A. Salido G.M. Rosado J.A. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). OAG-induced Ca2+ entry was estimated using the integral of the rise in [Ca2+]i for 2.5 min after addition of OAG in a medium containing 1 mm Ca2+. Ca2+ entry was corrected by subtraction of the [Ca2+]i elevation due to leakage of the indicator or leak Ca2+ entry after the addition of DMSO (the vehicle of TG and OAG). Ca2+ release by TG was estimated using the integral of the rise in [Ca2+]i for 3 min after the addition of the agent (22López J.J. Camello-Almaraz C. Pariente J.A. Salido G.M. Rosado J.A. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Ca2+ entry and release are expressed as nm·s, as previously described (24Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—The immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were performed as described previously (15López J.J. Salido G.M. Pariente J.A. Rosado J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28254-28264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Briefly, 500-μl aliquots of platelet suspension (2 × 109 cell/ml) were lysed with an equal volume of RIPA buffer, pH 7.2, containing 316 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, 2 mm EGTA, 0.2% SDS, 2% sodium deoxycholate, 2% Triton X-100, 2 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 mm benzamidine. Aliquots of platelet lysates (1 ml) were immunoprecipitated by incubation with 2 μg of anti-Orai1 antibody and 25 μl of protein A-agarose overnight at 4 °C on a rocking platform. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes for subsequent probing. Blots were incubated overnight with 10% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) to block residual protein binding sites. Immunodetection of STIM1, hTRPC1, and Orai1 was achieved using the anti-STIM1 antibody diluted 1:250 in TBST for 2 h, the anti-hTRPC1 antibody diluted 1:200 in TBST for 1 h, and the anti-Orai1 antibody diluted 1:1000 in TBST for 1.5 h, respectively. The primary antibody was removed and blots were washed six times for 5 min each with TBST. To detect the primary antibody, blots were incubated for 45 min with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated ovine anti-mouse IgG antibody or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody diluted 1:10,000 in TBST and then exposed to enhanced chemiluminescence reagents for 4 min. Blots were then exposed to photographic films. The density of bands on the film was measured using scanning densitometry. Reversible Electroporation Procedure—The platelet suspension was transferred to an electroporation chamber containing antibodies at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml, and the antibodies were transjected according to published methods (15López J.J. Salido G.M. Pariente J.A. Rosado J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28254-28264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Reversible electropermeabilization was performed at 4 kV/cm at a setting of 25-microfarad capacitance and was achieved by 7 pulses using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser Xcell Electroporation System (Bio-Rad). Following electroporation, platelets were incubated with antibodies for an additional 60 min at 37 °C and centrifuged at 350 × g for 20 min and resuspended in HBS prior to the experiments. Statistical Analysis—Analysis of statistical significance was performed using Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered to be significant for a difference. Orai1 Co-immunoprecipitates with hTRPC1 and STIM1 in Human Platelets—Platelets have been shown to endogenously express hTRPC1 channel in the PM (5Rosado J.A. Brownlow S.L. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42157-42163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and a functional interaction between STIM1 in the Ca2+ stores and hTRPC1 has been reported to account for the activation of SOCE in these cells (15López J.J. Salido G.M. Pariente J.A. Rosado J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28254-28264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). We have now investigated the association between hTRPC1 and Orai1 by looking for co-immunoprecipitation from platelet lysates. Immunoprecipitation and subsequent SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were conducted using control platelets and platelets treated in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (100 μm EGTA was added to the medium) for different periods of time (from 10 to 60 s) with inhibitor of the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) TG (1 μm) plus a low concentration of ionomycin (50 nm), to induce extensive depletion of the intracellular stores in platelets (25Juska A. Redondo P.C. Rosado J.A. Salido G.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 334: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). After immunoprecipitation with anti-hTRPC1 or anti-Orai1 antibodies, Western blotting revealed the presence of Orai1 in samples from resting platelets. The specificity of the hTRPC1 antibody was tested with the anti-TRPC1 antibody T1E3, which has been shown to be a specific tool in the investigation of mammalian TRPC1 proteins (5Rosado J.A. Brownlow S.L. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42157-42163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 26Xu S.Z. Beech D.J. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). We found that treatment with TG + ionomycin increased the association between Orai1 and hTRPC1 in a time-dependent manner, reaching a maximal effect after 30 s of platelet stimulation (Fig. 1A, upper panel; n = 6). Similar results were observed when cells were stimulated with the physiological agonist thrombin (1 units/ml) in a Ca2+-free medium (100 μm EGTA was added at the time of experiment). Thrombin increased coimmunoprecipitation between Orai1 and hTRPC1 in a time-dependent manner, reaching a maximum after 10 s of stimulation with the agonist (Fig. 1B, upper panel; n = 6). Western blotting of the same membranes with the antibody used for immunoprecipitation confirmed similar protein content in all lanes (Fig. 1, lower panels). Furthermore, we have explored the association between STIM1 and Orai1 by looking for co-immunoprecipitation from platelet lysates. Immunoprecipitation and subsequent SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were conducted using control platelets and platelets treated in a Ca2+-free medium (100 μm EGTA added) for different periods of time (from 10 to 60 s) with TG (1 μm) and ionomycin (50 nm). Our results indicate that treatment with TG + ionomycin increased the association between Orai1 and STIM1 in a time-dependent manner, reaching a maximal effect after 10 s of platelet stimulation (Fig. 2A, upper panel; n = 6). Similar results were observed when cells were stimulated with thrombin, which increased co-immunoprecipitation between Orai1 and STIM1 in a time-dependent manner, reaching a maximum after 30 s of stimulation with the agonist (Fig. 2B, upper panel; n = 6). Western blotting of the same membranes with the antibody used for immunoprecipitation confirmed similar protein content in all lanes (Fig. 2, lower panels). Our observations, showing an enhanced association of Orai1 with hTRPC1 and STIM1 in response to depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ stores or the physiological agonist thrombin suggest that the STIM1-Orai1-hTRPC1 ternary complex might be important for the mediation of SOCE in these cells. Inhibition of Store Depletion-evoked Interaction between STIM1 and hTRPC1 by Electrotransjection with Anti-Orai1 C-terminal Antibody—The amino acid sequence 288–301 of human Orai1 recognized by the anti-Orai1 antibody used is located in the cytosolic COOH-terminal region of Orai1, which has been shown to be essential for the interaction of Orai1 with STIM1 (27Muik M. Frischauf I. Derler I. Fahrner M. Bergsmann J. Eder P. Schindl R. Hesch C. Polzinger B. Fritsch R. Kahr H. Madl J. Gruber H. Groschner K. Romanin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 8014-8022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Since Orai1 has been proposed to mediate the communication between STIM1 and hTRPC1 (21Liao Y. Erxleben C. Yildirim E. Abramowitz J. Armstrong D.L. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 4682-4687Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) we have investigated whether the anti-Orai1 antibody, which is directed to the COOH-terminal region, could block the interaction between STIM1 and hTRPC1. To assess this possibility the anti-Orai1 antibody was introduced into platelets using an electropermeabilization technique. Electroporation can be used successfully for transferring antibodies into cells while maintaining the physiological integrity of the cells (15López J.J. Salido G.M. Pariente J.A. Rosado J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28254-28264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 28Chakrabarti R. Wylie D.E. Schuster S.M. J. Biol.

Human platelets were reversibly electroporated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The presence of this antibody inside platelets was confirmed in samples from platelets electropermeabilized and incubated with 1 μg/ml of either anti-Orai1 antibody or rabbit IgG, of the same nature of the anti-Orai1 antibody used, by immunoprecipitation without adding any additional antibody and subsequent Western blotting with the anti-Orai1 antibody. As shown in Fig. 3A, Orai1 was clearly detected in cells that had been previously electropermeabilized and incubated with anti-Orai1 antibody and not in cells incubated with rabbit IgG. Electropermeabilization allowed the anti-Orai1 antibody to enter the cells and immunoprecipitate native Orai1, which was then detected by Western blotting. To further investigate whether reversible electroporation might induce loss of proteins of the size of Orai1 (∼45 kDa) (30Gwack Y. Srikanth S. Feske S. Cruz-Guilloty F. Oh-hora M. Neems D.S. Hogan P.G. Rao A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16232-16243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) we investigated the presence of actin (42 kDa) in electroporated and non-electroporated platelets. As shown in Fig. 3B, the amount of actin detected by Western blotting in electroporated platelets was not significantly smaller than that detected in non-electroporated platelets. Altogether, these findings confirm the efficacy of the electrotransjection and that the amount of Orai1 detected was not modified by treatment with TG + ionomycin for 30 s (Fig. 3A, top panel). As shown in Fig. 3C, interaction between STIM1 and hTRPC1 was abolished in platelets electrotransjected with 1 μg/ml anti-Orai1 antibody (upper panel, third and fourth lanes; p < 0.001; n = 6) compared with platelets electrotransjected with 1 μg/ml rabbit IgG, as detected by immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with the anti-STIM1 antibody followed by Western blotting with anti-hTRPC1 antibody. Reprobing of the same membranes with anti-STIM1 antibody confirmed a similar protein loading in all lanes (Fig. 3C, lower panel). We found that electrotransjection of the anti-Orai1 antibody inhibits TG + ionomycin-induced Orai1-STIM1 co-immunoprecipitation by performing immunoprecipitation with the transjected anti-Orai1 antibody (no additional antibodies were added for immunoprecipitation after transjection of anti-Orai1 antibody into cells) followed by Western blotting with the anti-STIM1 antibody (data not shown). These findings were not observed when platelets were electrotransjected with rabbit IgG (data not shown). These findings suggest that the amino acid sequence recognized by the anti-Orai1 antibody is essential for the interaction of STIM1 and hTRPC1, and blockade of this interaction might impair the function of the STIM1-Orai1-hTRPC1 ternary complex. Impairment of the Interaction between STIM1 and hTRPC1 Changes the Behavior of hTRPC1-forming Channels from Capacitative to Non-capacitative Channel—We have further investigated whether the anti-Orai1 antibody could affect SOCE in these cells. To assess this issue, the anti-Orai1 antibody was electrotransjected into platelets, followed by depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ stores using TG (200 nm) to activate SOCE. Before the measurement of [Ca2+]i platelets were maintained in a medium containing 200 μm CaCl2, to avoid premature depletion of the stores. At the time of the experiment 250 μm EGTA was added to perform the studies in a Ca2+-free medium. In platelets electrotransjected with rabbit IgG (Fig. 4A), TG evoked a prolonged elevation of [Ca2+]i, due to leakage of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (the integral for 3 min of the rise in [Ca2+]i after the addition of TG was 238 ± 73 nm·s; Fig. 4A, rabbit IgG: Control). Subsequent addition of Ca2+ (1 mm) to the external medium induced a sustained increase in [Ca2+]i, indicative of SOCE (the integral of the rise in [Ca2+]i after the addition of CaCl2 was 926 ± 137 nm·s; Fig. 4A, rabbit IgG: Control). To assess the involvement of hTRPC1 in TG-evoked SOCE we incubated cells for 30 min with 15"
https://openalex.org/W1979924782,"Activating mutations in genes of the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway occur in approximately 30% of all human cancers; however, mutation of Ras alone is rarely sufficient to induce tumour development. Scribble is a polarity regulator recently isolated from a Drosophila screen for events that cooperate with Ras mutation to promote tumour progression and cell invasion. In mammals, Scribble regulates directed cell migration and wound healing in vivo; however, no role has been identified for mammalian Scribble in oncogenic transformation. Here we show that in human epithelial cells expressing oncogenic Ras or Raf, loss of Scribble promotes invasion of cells through extracellular matrix in an organotypic culture system. Further, we show that the mechanism by which this occurs is in the regulation of MAPK signalling by Scribble. The suppression of MAPK signalling is a highly conserved function of Scribble as it also prevents Raf-mediated defects in Drosophila wing development. Our data identify Scribble as an important mediator of MAPK signalling and provide a molecular basis for the observation that Scribble expression is decreased in many invasive human cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2062848152,"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a flavivirus replicating in the cytoplasm of infected cells. The HCV genome is a single-stranded RNA encoding a polyprotein that is cleaved by cellular and viral proteases into 10 different products. While the structural proteins core protein, envelope protein 1 (E1) and E2 build up the virus particle, most nonstructural (NS) proteins are required for RNA replication. One of the least studied proteins is NS2, which is composed of a C-terminal cytosolic protease domain and a highly hydrophobic N-terminal domain. It is assumed that the latter is composed of three trans-membrane segments (TMS) that tightly attach NS2 to intracellular membranes. Taking advantage of a system to study HCV assembly in a hepatoma cell line, in this study we performed a detailed characterization of NS2 with respect to its role for virus particle assembly. In agreement with an earlier report ( Jones, C. T., Murray, C. L., Eastman, D. K., Tassello, J., and Rice, C. M. (2007) J. Virol. 81, 8374-8383 ), we demonstrate that the protease domain, but not its enzymatic activity, is required for infectious virus production. We also show that serine residue 168 in NS2, implicated in the phosphorylation and stability of this protein, is dispensable for virion formation. In addition, we determined the NMR structure of the first TMS of NS2 and show that the N-terminal segment (amino acids 3-11) forms a putative flexible helical element connected to a stable alpha-helix (amino acids 12-21) that includes an absolutely conserved helix side in genotype 1b. By using this structure as well as the amino acid conservation as a guide for a functional study, we determined the contribution of individual amino acid residues in TMS1 for HCV assembly. We identified several residues that are critical for virion formation, most notably a central glycine residue at position 10 of TMS1. Finally, we demonstrate that mutations in NS2 blocking HCV assembly can be rescued by trans-complementation."
https://openalex.org/W2006692046,"Background Female sex pheromones attracting mating partners over long distances are a major determinant of reproductive isolation and speciation in Lepidoptera. Males can also produce sex pheromones but their study, particularly in butterflies, has received little attention. A detailed comparison of sex pheromones in male butterflies with those of female moths would reveal patterns of conservation versus novelty in the associated behaviours, biosynthetic pathways, compounds, scent-releasing structures and receiving systems. Here we assess whether the African butterfly Bicyclus anynana, for which genetic, genomic, phylogenetic, ecological and ethological tools are available, represents a relevant model to contribute to such comparative studies. Methodology/Principal Findings Using a multidisciplinary approach, we determined the chemical composition of the male sex pheromone (MSP) in the African butterfly B. anynana, and demonstrated its behavioural activity. First, we identified three compounds forming the presumptive MSP, namely (Z)-9-tetradecenol (Z9-14:OH), hexadecanal (16:Ald ) and 6,10,14-trimethylpentadecan-2-ol (6,10,14-trime-15-2-ol), and produced by the male secondary sexual structures, the androconia. Second, we described the male courtship sequence and found that males with artificially reduced amounts of MSP have a reduced mating success in semi-field conditions. Finally, we could restore the mating success of these males by perfuming them with the synthetic MSP. Conclusions/Significance This study provides one of the first integrative analyses of a MSP in butterflies. The toolkit it has developed will enable the investigation of the type of information about male quality that is conveyed by the MSP in intraspecific communication. Interestingly, the chemical structure of B. anynana MSP is similar to some sex pheromones of female moths making a direct comparison of pheromone biosynthesis between male butterflies and female moths relevant to future research. Such a comparison will in turn contribute to understanding the evolution of sex pheromone production and reception in butterflies."

In the cytoplasm, folate-activated carbons are incorporated into the 2nd and 8th positions of the purine ring and are required for the conversion of uridylate to thymidylate and for the methylation of homocysteine to methionine. Methionine can be converted to a methyl donor through its adenosylation to S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), a required cofactor for the methylation of DNA, RNA, proteins, lipids, and numerous small molecules. Disruptions in folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism, resulting from nutritional deficiencies and/or common genetic variations, impair both DNA synthesis and chromatin methylation (1Stover P.J. Nutr.

Decreased rates of thymidylate synthesis result in increased rates of uracil misincorporation into DNA, whereas decreases in cellular methylation capacity affect both histone and cytosine methylation in chromatin.

Mitochondrial one-carbon metabolism generates formate, a single-carbon molecule, from the amino acids serine, glycine, sarcosine, and dimethylglycine (Fig. 1) (2Appling D.R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2645-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Formate effluxes to the cytoplasm where it is incorporated into the folate-activated one-carbon pool through the activity of 10-formyl-THF synthetase. Nuclear folate metabolism occurs through the small ubiquitin-related modifier-dependent translocation of the de novo thymidylate synthase pathway from the cytoplasm to the nucleus during S-phase (3Woeller C.F.

Lab. Med. 2007; 45: 1760-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). SHMT isozymes are present in each of these three compartments. Whereas mSHMT is expressed ubiquitously among mammalian cell types, cSHMT exhibits tissue-specific expression patterns (5Christensen K.E. MacKenzie R.E.

Gene (Amst.). 1998; 210: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). A definitive role for the essentiality of mitochondria in generating folate-activated single carbons for cytoplasmic metabolism has yet to be established. Although the genes that encode the mitochondrial pathway for the folate-dependent conversion of serine to glycine and formate are expressed in mammalian embryonic and tumor cells, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of 5,10-methylene-THF to 5,10-methenyl-THF has yet to be identified in differentiated, nontransformed cells (5Christensen K.E. MacKenzie R.E. BioEssays. 2006; 28: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been proposed that mitochondria and the mSHMT enzyme may function to generate serine from glycine for gluconeogenesis in adult cells, indicating that mitochondria may not serve as the source of formate for cytoplasmic one-carbon metabolism in all cell types. Although suggested, the ability of cSHMT to serve as a primary source of one-carbons for cytoplasmic one-carbon metabolism has never been investigated. Previous studies in cell cultures have indicated that cSHMT generates methylene-THF for dTMP synthesis through the compartmentation of de novo thymidylate synthesis in the nucleus and serves to inhibit homocysteine remethylation in the cytoplasm by sequestering 5-methyl-THF (9Herbig K. Chiang E.P. Lee L.R. Hills J. Shane B. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38381-38389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In this study, the metabolic role and essentiality of cSHMT in one-carbon metabolism was investigated in mice. Shmt1/loxβgeo Targeting Vector—The pKO Scrambler V907 plasmid (Lexicon Genetics, Inc.) was used to generate the targeting vector. First, two synthetic oligonucleotides containing loxP sites were cloned into the BglII/ClaI and BamHI/EcoRI sites of pKO Scrambler; only the BglII site was left intact. Genomic sequences from the Shmt1 gene were amplified by PCR using AB2.2-prime ES cell (Lexicon Genetics) DNA as the template. The 5′ homologous Shmt1 sequence corresponding to 970 bp of intron 6 was cloned into the HpaI and BglII sites of the pKO Scrambler plasmid. The 3′ homologous arm corresponding to 5.0 kb of sequence, including most of intron 7, exon 8, and intron 8, was cloned into the KpnI and SmaI sites, 3′ of the loxP sites of the plasmid. The Shmt1 sequence targeted for deletion was a 355-bp sequence, including 73 bp of intron 6, the 213 bp of exon 7, and 69 bp of intron 7. This fragment was cloned into the XhoI site located between the two loxP sites. Subsequently, the BglII/SalI fragment from the vector pGT1.8IresBgeo (10Mountford P. Zevnik B. Duwel A. Nichols J. Li M. Dani C. Robertson M. Chambers I. Smith A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4303-4307Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), which included the IRESβgeo cDNA, was flanked with AscI linkers then cloned into the AscI site of pKO Scrambler, placing the IRESβgeo cDNA between the loxP sites. Finally, the negative selection marker diphtheria toxin A was cloned as an RsrI fragment from the vector pKO SelectDT (Lexicon Genetics, Inc.) into the flanking RsrI site of the targeting vector. AB2.2 prime ES cells were cultured according to the instructions of The Mouse Kit™ (Lexicon Genetics, Inc.). The targeting vector was linearized with NotI, and 20 μg was electroporated into the ES cells, following the protocols (Lexicon Genetics, Inc.). The transfected ES cells were grown in selection media containing 175 μg/ml G418 for 13 days. Surviving clones were picked and screened for homologous recombination by PCR (Fig. 2A). ES cell DNA was purified according to the instructions of The Mouse Kit™. The forward primer was 5′-GCCTGCTTTGTTGTTTTGATTAGTC-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-AATTGATAACTTCGTATAGCATACATTATACGAAGTTATA-3′. The PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 45 s, 54 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 2 min. The forward primer corresponds to a sequence in intron 6 that is upstream of the sequence included in the targeting vector. The reverse primer corresponds to parts of the loxP oligonucleotide cloned 5′ of exon 7. The presence of a 1.5-kb PCR product indicated that homologous recombination had taken place between the Shmt1 gene and the targeting vector. Over 90% of the G418-resistant clones tested positive for homologous recombination. Generation of Shmt1flox/+ and Shmt1–/– Mice—A G418-resistant cell line that tested positive for homologous recombination of the targeting vector was injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts at the Cornell Core Transgenic Mouse Facility (Ithaca, NY). Six chimeric B6;129-Shmt1(flox)tm1Stov male founders (referred to as Shmt1flox/+ mice) were obtained. Shmt1flox/+ mice were genotyped by PCR using purified tail genomic DNA (Qiagen) as a template using the forward primer 5′-GACACTGTTCACATCCCTC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-ATGGTAGTGTCAAAGATCC-3′. Both primers correspond to intron 6 sequences that flank the loxP insertion (Fig. 2B). Disruption of the Shmt1 gene in the germ line was achieved by crossing Shmt1flox/+ mice with BALB/c-Tg(CMV-Cre)1Cgn/J (CMV-Cre; The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) mice. Mice with a disrupted Shmt1 allele (referred to as Shmt1–/+ mice) were genotyped using the same forward primer as above and the reverse primer 5′-CAAAACATTCGGGAGCCTC-3′. The reverse primer corresponds to an intron 7 sequence located downstream of the 3′ loxP site. Presence of the Cre allele was determined by PCR using the forward primers 5′-CTAGGCCACAGAATTGAAAGATCT-3′ (Il2 internal control) and 5′-ACCAGCCAGCTATCAACTCG-3′ (Cre) and the reverse primers 5′-GTAGGTGGAAATTCTAGCATCATCC-3′ (Il2 internal control) and 5′-TTACATTGGTCCAGCCACC-3′ (Cre) (The Jackson Laboratory). The Cre allele was removed from the germ line by crossing Shmt1–/+ mice with 129SvEv wild type mice; only Shmt1–/+ mice that lacked the Cre allele were chosen for subsequent use and backcrossing. Mice were killed by cervical dislocation. Blood was collected into heparin-coated tubes by cardiac puncture, and plasma was isolated by centrifugation. Tissues were immediately flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. All mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions in accordance with standard use protocols and animal welfare regulations. All study protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Cornell University and conform to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals from the National Institutes of Health. Diets—Mice were fed either a standard chow diet (Harlan Teklad LM-485), AIN93G (referred to as control diet), or AIN-93G diet lacking folic acid and choline (Dyets, Inc., Bethlehem, PA). For studies involving dietary folate deficiency, 129SvEv-Shmt1(N10) mice were randomly weaned at 3 weeks of age onto either the control (AIN-93G) diet or to the modified AIN-93G diet lacking folic acid and choline. The control diet contained 2 mg/kg folic acid and 2.5 g/kg choline bitartrate, and the folate/choline-deficient diet contained 0 mg/kg folic acid and choline bitartrate (Dyets, Inc.). Mice were maintained on the diet for 5, 22, or 32 weeks, as indicated. Immunoblotting—Total protein was extracted and quantified from tissue (11Bensadoun A. Weinstein D. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 70: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). Tissue lysis was achieved by sonication in lysis buffer (2% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 60 mm Tris (pH 6.8)). Proteins (40 μg/well) were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred at 4 °C to an Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.) using a Transblot apparatus (Bio-Rad). Following transfer, membranes were blocked in 5% (w/v) nonfat skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 h followed by overnight incubation in primary antibody at 4 °C. The membranes were washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated overnight with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The membranes were visualized using the SuperSignal® West Pico chemiluminescent substrate system (Pierce). For actin detection, polyclonal rabbit anti-actin antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Abcam) was diluted 1:40,000. For cSHMT detection, sheep anti-mouse cSHMT antibody (12Liu X. Szebenyi D.M. Anguera M.C. Thiel D.J. Stover P.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4932-4939Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) was diluted 1:10,000, and rabbit anti-sheep IgG secondary antibody (Pierce) was diluted 1:20,000. Mouse Embryonic Fibroblast Culture—Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were isolated from female 129SvEv-Shmt1–/+(N10) mice bred to male 129SvEv-Shmt1–/+(N10) mice at 10–14 days postcoitus. Briefly, embryos were dissected from the uterus into cold sterile PBS. The heads were taken for genotyping, and the eviscerated bodies were cut into 1–2-mm pieces and digested in 0.05% trypsin at 37 °C. Cells were cultured in α-minimal essential medium (Hyclone Laboratories) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories), 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. For AdoMet and S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) analysis in cells, confluent MEFs were washed twice with PBS and cultured for 4 h in defined minimal essential medium (Hyclone Laboratories) that lacked methionine, vitamin B6, and folic acid but supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (dialyzed and charcoal treated), 25 nm leucovorin, and 1 μg/ml pyridoxal phosphate (PLP). The absence of methionine from the culture medium ensures that AdoMet levels reflect homocysteine remethylation capacity and not exogenous methionine availability. The cells were harvested and cell pellets stored at –80 °C. Determination of AdoMet and AdoHcy Concentrations—The animal feeding cycle was synchronized prior to tissue harvest to ensure AdoMet levels reflected homocysteine remethylation capacity with minimal contributions from dietary methionine. Food was removed 24 h prior to killing the animals. After 12 h, each animal was given one food pellet, and the animals were killed 12 h later by cervical dislocation. Tissues were harvested and immediately flash-frozen and stored at –80 °C until analysis. Frozen tissues or cell pellets were sonicated in 500 μl of 0.1 m NaAcO buffer (pH 6), and protein was precipitated by adding 312 μl of 10% perchloric acid to each sample. After vortexing, samples were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. AdoMet and AdoHcy were determined as described previously (9Herbig K. Chiang E.P. Lee L.R. Hills J. Shane B. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38381-38389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). AdoMet and AdoHcy values were normalized to cellular protein content (11Bensadoun A. Weinstein D. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 70: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). Plasma and Tissue Folate Concentration—Folate concentration of plasma and tissues was quantified using the Lactobacillus casei microbiological assay as described previously (9Herbig K. Chiang E.P. Lee L.R. Hills J. Shane B. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38381-38389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Uracil Content in Nuclear DNA—Genomic DNA was extracted from 25 to 50 mg of tissue using DNeasy Tissue and Blood Kit (Qiagen), including an incubation with RNase A (Sigma) and RNase T1 (Ambion) for 30 min at 37 °C. 10 μg of DNA was treated with 1 unit of uracil DNA glycosylase (Epicenter) for 1 h at 37 °C. Immediately following incubation, 10 pg of [15N2]uracil (Cambridge Isotopes) was added to each sample as an internal standard, and the sample was dried completely in a speed vacuum. 50 μl of acetonitrile, 10 μl of triethylamine, and 1 μl of 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzyl bromide were added to each sample and incubated for 25 min at 30 °C with shaking at 500 rpm. 50 μl water followed by 100 μl of isooctane were added to each sample. Samples were vortexed and centrifuged. Organic extraction of derived uracil was completed by the removal of the aqueous phase and analysis of the organic phase. Analysis of uracil-3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzyl bromide was carried out on a Shimadzu QP2010. 1 μl of sample or standard was analyzed in the splitless mode with a purge activation time of 1 min and split vent flow of 50 ml/min with an injection port temperature of 280 °C. Ultrapurity helium gas was used as carrier gas with a linear velocity of 55 ml/min. Separation of derived uracil was obtained by using an XTI-5, 30 m, 0.25-mm inner diameter, 0.25-μm column (Restek), using the following temperature cycles for the oven: 100 °C for 1 min, ramping to 280 °C at 25 °C/min, holding for 5 min, ramping to 300 °C at 5 °C/min, and holding for 5 min. The interface temperature was held at 300 °C with an ion source temperature of 260 °C. Ionization was achieved using the NCI mode using methane as the reagent gas and monitoring for ions 337 m/z for uracil and 339 m/z for [15N2]uracil. Metabolite Profile from Plasma—Total homocysteine, cystathionine, total cysteine, methionine, glycine, serine, α-aminobutyric acid, N,N-dimethylglycine, and N-methylglycine were assayed in mouse plasma by stable isotope dilution capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as described previously (13Stabler S.P. Lindenbaum J. Savage D.G. Allen R.H. Blood. 1993; 81: 3404-3413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Allen R.H. Stabler S.P. Lindenbaum J. Metabolism. 1993; 42: 1448-1460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Statistical Analyses—Differences in genotype distribution were analyzed by the χ2 test. Differences between two groups were determined by Student's t test analysis. Differences among more than two genotypes were analyzed by two-way ANOVA and Dunnett's post hoc test using the wild type genotype as the control group. Diet × genotype effects were analyzed by two-way ANOVA and Tukey's HSD post hoc test. Groups were considered significantly different when the p value ≤ 0.05. All statistics were performed using JMP IN software, release 5.1.2. Shmt1 Null Mice Are Viable and Fertile—The targeting vector (Fig. 2A) was designed both to disrupt conditionally the production of functional cSHMT protein and to insert a reporter gene to enable detection of endogenous Shmt1 transcription. To achieve gene disruption, loxP sites were placed both 5′ and 3′ of mouse Shmt1 exon 7, which encodes the amino acid sequence for PLP binding, which is necessary for the activity of cSHMT enzyme (15Szebenyi D.M. Liu X. Kriksunov I.A. Stover P.J. Thiel D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13313-13323Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To detect endogenous Shmt1 transcriptional activity, a cassette containing the βgeo gene flanked by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and a polyadenylation (poly(A)) signal was inserted 5′ to the loxP site and 3′ to exon 7. The βgeo gene product is a fusion protein consisting of the neomycin resistance gene (neoR) and the lacZ gene, which allowed for G418 selection in transfected ES cells, and serves as the transcriptional reporter to quantify cSHMT transcription in cells. The presence of the IRES enables translation of βgeo following excision of intron 7. The poly(A) signal was placed 3′ of βgeo to enhance the stability of the spliced intron 7. Successful homologous recombination of the Shmt1/loxβgeo cassette into the Shmt1 gene was demonstrated by PCR-based genotyping. The presence of the Shmt1/loxβgeo (floxed) allele was confirmed by a 348-bp PCR product, whereas the wild type allele was confirmed by a 293-bp PCR product (Fig. 2B). Mice that are heterozygous and homozygous for the floxed allele (Shmt1flox/+ and Shmt1flox/flox) are viable and fertile. The Shmt1 allele was disrupted by crossing Shmt1flox/+ mice to CMV-Cre-expressing mice, which resulted in the deletion of exon 7 in the Shmt1 gene (Fig. 2B). PCR-based genotyping of the wild type Shmt1 allele results in the generation of a 740-bp PCR product, whereas the disrupted allele generates a 460-bp PCR product (Fig. 2B). To determine whether Shmt1–/– mice were viable, the Shmt1 genotype distribution was determined from Shmt1–/+ intercrosses (Table 1). A total of 452 pups from 84 litters were examined. The average litter size was 5.4 pups. We found that the Shmt1 genotypes were distributed as expected for Mendelian inheritance of the alleles. The respective ratios of Shmt1+/+, Shmt1–/+, and Shmt1–/– mice were 25.4:49.3:25.2. Both sexes were found at the expected frequency.TABLE 1Shmt1 null mice are viableGenotypeObserved genotype distributionExpected genotype distributionMaleFemaleTotalMaleFemaleTotalShmt1+/+635211556.556.5113Shmt1-/+110113223113113226Shmt1-/-625211456.556.5113Total235217452226226452 Open table in a new tab Fertility and maternal lethality of Shmt1 nullizygosity were determined. Shmt1–/– mice were intercrossed, and a total of 90 pups from 13 litters were generated (Table 2). Genotyping indicated that all pups were null for the Shmt1 gene. The expected ratio of male to female pups was observed. The mean litter size was 6.9, and both sexes were observed at the expected distribution. The difference in litter size between the two sets of matings was likely strain-dependent (heterozygous intercrosses are 129SvEv; homozygous intercrosses are on a mixed background of C57Bl/6, BALB/c, and 129SvEv). The data demonstrate that the loss of cSHMT does not affect fertility or result in embryonic lethality.TABLE 2Shmt1 null mice are fertile and do not demonstrate maternal lethalityGenotypeMaleFemaleTotalShmt1-/-414990Expected sex distribution454590 Open table in a new tab cSHMT Protein Expression in Shmt1flox/+ and Shmt1 Null Mice—The Shmt1flox/+ and Shmt1flox/flox mice demonstrate variable tissue-dependent hypomorphic cSHMT protein levels, as detected by immunoblotting. Liver and kidney tissues from Shmt1flox/+ and Shmt1flox/flox mice exhibit reductions in cSHMT protein levels compared with their Shmt1+/+ siblings, ranging from 0 to an approximate 25% reduction in protein (Fig. 3, A and C). The colon demonstrates the greatest reduction in cSHMT protein, which is reduced by ∼50% in Shmt1flox/+ and by 75–80% in Shmt1flox/flox mice relative to their wild type counterparts (Fig. 3B). The Shmt1–/+ and Shmt1–/– mice consistently exhibited a decrease or absence of cSHMT protein levels in all tissues examined, respectively (Fig. 3, A–C). The Shmt1–/+ mice exhibited a 50–80% decrease in cSHMT protein levels in kidney, liver, and colon. No truncated forms of the cSHMT protein were observed in any tissue examined. This indicates that if truncated protein is expressed, it is rapidly degraded because the antibody epitope is located on the amino terminus of the cSHMT protein. cSHMT Regulates the Remethylation of Homocysteine—Hepatic AdoMet and AdoHcy levels were determined in Shmt1–/– mice on a mixed strain background at ∼6 weeks of age fed the standard chow diet. Livers from Shmt1 wild type 129SvEv, C57Bl/6, and BALB/c mice were used for comparisons. Liver AdoMet levels were elevated 2-fold in the Shmt1–/– mice compared with wild type mice (1.02 versus 0.46 pmol of AdoMet/μg of protein; Table 3). AdoHcy was significantly decreased by 60% in Shmt1–/– mice compared with wild type mice (0.72 versus 1.92 pmol of AdoHcy/μg of protein; Table 3). The cellular methylation potential, represented as the AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio, was 4-fold higher in liver from Shmt1–/– mice than observed in wild type mice on a chow diet (1.50 versus 0.38 AdoMet/AdoHcy; Table 3).TABLE 3AdoMet, AdoHcy, and the AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio in the liver of Shmt1 null mice on an ad libitum chow dietStrainShmt1 genotypenAdoMetAdoHcyAdoMet/AdoHcypmol/μg proteinpmol/μg proteinC57Bl/6Shmt1+/+90.33 ± 0.070.51 ± 0.120.66 ± 0.08129SvEvShmt1+/+80.32 ± 0.072.64 ± 0.510.13 ± 0.03BALB/cShmt1+/+90.71 ± 0.162.70 ± 0.390.32 ± 0.07All strainsShmt1+/+260.46 ± 0.071.92 ± 0.290.38 ± 0.06129SvEv.

Both plasma and liver folate concentrations were significantly reduced in mice fed the folate/choline-deficient diet for 22 and 32 weeks (Table 4). The decrease in plasma and liver folate was independent of Shmt1 genotype except in the case of Shmt1–/+ mice, which demonstrated an increase in liver folate concentration in comparison with Shmt1 wild type mice at 32 weeks.TABLE 4Plasma and liver folate in Shmt1 null miceAge22 weeks32 weeksDietShmt1 genotypePlasmaLiverPlasmaLiverng/mlfmol/μg proteinng/mlfmol/μg proteinAIN-93GShmt1+/+42.27 ± 11.1560.85 ± 8.6035.72 ± 2.2646.00 ± 5.02Shmt1-/+26.53 ± 1.7156.43 ± 7.7235.29 ± 1.1757.49 ± 6.29Shmt1-/-31.35 ± 4.2551.11 ± 4.2140.85 ± 2.0441.87 ± 2.13AIN-93G minus folate and cholineShmt1+/+1.06 ± 0.6020.26 ± 4.791.15 ± 0.1012.82 ± 1.57Shmt1-/+2.25 ± 0.4829.27 ± 3.973.15 ± 0.1826.57 ± 5.23Shmt1-/-2.38 ± 0.2237.60 ± 2.911.02 ± 0.2221.28 ± 5.37p value, diet effect<0.0001<0.0001<0.0001<0.0001p value, genotype effectNSaNS means not significant.NSNS0.03bShmt1+/+ is significantly different from Shmt1-/+, p < 0.05, as analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Tukey's HSD post hoc test for genotype effect.p value, diet × genotype effectNSNSNSNSa NS means not significant.b Shmt1+/+ is significantly different from Shmt1-/+, p < 0.05, as analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Tukey's HSD post hoc test for genotype effect.

https://openalex.org/W2035138652,"Mechanistic understanding and defining novel therapeutic targets of diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) have been hampered by a lack of appropriate adult animal models. Here we describe a simple and highly reproducible adult fli-EGFP transgenic zebrafish model to study retinal angiogenesis. The retinal vasculature in the adult zebrafish is highly organized and hypoxia-induced neovascularization occurs in a predictable area of capillary plexuses. New retinal vessels and vascular sprouts can be accurately measured and quantified. Orally active anti-VEGF agents including sunitinib and ZM323881 effectively block hypoxia-induced retinal neovascularization. Intriguingly, blockage of the Notch signaling pathway by the inhibitor DAPT under hypoxia, results in a high density of arterial sprouting in all optical arteries. The Notch suppression-induced arterial sprouting is dependent on tissue hypoxia. However, in the presence of DAPT substantial endothelial tip cell formation was detected only in optic capillary plexuses under normoxia. These findings suggest that hypoxia shifts the vascular targets of Notch inhibitors. Our findings for the first time show a clinically relevant retinal angiogenesis model in adult zebrafish, which might serve as a platform for studying mechanisms of retinal angiogenesis, for defining novel therapeutic targets, and for screening of novel antiangiogenic drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2093922429,"Background The NLRP (Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, Leucine rich Repeat and Pyrin domain containing) family, also referred to as NALP family, is well known for its roles in apoptosis and inflammation. Several NLRPs have been indicated as being involved in reproduction as well. Methodology We studied, using the unique human gametes and embryo materials, the expression of the NLRP family in human gametes and preimplantation embryos at different developmental stages, and compared the expression levels between normal and abnormal embryos using real-time PCR. Principal Findings Among 14 members of the NLRP family, twelve were detected in human oocytes and preimplantation embryos, whereas seven were detected in spermatozoa. Eight NLRPs (NLRP4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, and 14) showed a similar expression pattern: their expression levels were high in oocytes and then decreased progressively in embryos, resulting in a very low level in day 5 embryos. However, NLRP2 and NLRP7 showed a different expression pattern: their expression decreased from oocytes to the lowest level by day 3, but increased again by day 5. The expression levels of NLRP5, 9, and 12 were lower in day 1 abnormal embryos but higher in day3 and day5 arrested embryos, when compared with normal embryos at the same stages.

Conclusions According to our results, different NLRPs possibly work in a stage-dependent manner during human preimplantation development."
https://openalex.org/W2003478746,"In a breast tumor xenograft model, the MCT-1 oncogene increases the in vivo tumorgenicity of MCF7 cells by promoting angiogenesis and inhibiting apoptosis. Increases in the tumor microvascular density are accompanied by a strong reduction in the levels of the angiogenesis inhibitor thrombospondin-1 (TSP1), but the mechanisms underlying this process are unknown. We show that TSP1 expression is controlled, at least in part, by post-transcriptional events. Using RNA interference to knock down the expression of the RNA-binding protein HuR in MCF7 cells as well as HuR overexpression, we demonstrate that HuR plays an important role in translation of the TSP1 mRNA. Furthermore, employing the RIP-Chip assay yielded 595 transcripts with significantly altered binding to HuR in the more tumorigenic breast cancer clones compared with the weakly tumorigenic clones. These mRNAs clustered in several pathways implicated in the transformed phenotype, such as the RAS pathway (involved in mitogenesis), the PI3K pathway (evasion of apoptosis) and pathways mediating angiogenesis and the cellular response to hypoxia. These findings demonstrate for the first time that global changes in HuR-bound mRNAs are implicated in the evolution to a more tumorigenic phenotype in an in vivo tumor model and underscore the role of global mRNA-protein interactions toward tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2014970076,"The functional capacity of the transcriptional regulatory CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-beta (C/EBPbeta) is governed by protein interactions and post-translational protein modifications. In a proteome-wide interaction screen, the histone-lysine N-methyltransferase, H3 lysine 9-specific 3 (G9a), was found to directly interact with the C/EBPbeta transactivation domain (TAD). Binding between G9a and C/EBPbeta was confirmed by glutathione S-transferase pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation. Metabolic labeling showed that C/EBPbeta is post-translationally modified by methylation in vivo. A conserved lysine residue in the C/EBPbeta TAD served as a substrate for G9a-mediated methylation. G9a, but not a methyltransferase-defective G9a mutant, abrogated the transactivation potential of wild type C/EBPbeta. A C/EBPbeta TAD mutant that contained a lysine-to-alanine exchange was resistant to G9a-mediated inhibition. Moreover, the same mutation conferred super-activation of a chromatin-embedded, endogenous C/EBPbeta target gene. Our data identify C/EBPbeta as a direct substrate of G9a-mediated post-translational modification that alters the functional properties of C/EBPbeta during gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2068981119,"Background The circadian system provides the basis to anticipate and cope with daily recurrent challenges to maintain the organisms' homeostasis. De-synchronization of circadian feedback oscillators in humans causes ‘jet lag’, likely contributes to sleep - , psychiatric - , metabolic disorders and even cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to the disintegration of tissue-specific clocks are complex and not well understood. Methodology/Principal Findings Based on their circadian expression and cell culture experiments, the basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) transcription factors SHARP-1(Dec2) and SHARP-2(Stra13/Dec1) were proposed as novel negative regulators of the molecular clock. To address their function in vivo, we generated Sharp-1 and Sharp-2 single and double mutant mice. Our experiments reveal critical roles for both factors in regulating period length, tissue-specific control of clock gene expression and entrainment to external cues. Light-pulse experiments and rapid delays of the light-dark cycle (experimental jet lag) unravel complementary functions for SHARP-1 and SHARP-2 in controlling activity phase resetting kinetics. Moreover, we show that SHARP-1 and 2 can serve dual functions as repressors and co-activators of mammalian clock gene expression in a context-specific manner. This correlates with increased amplitudes of Per2 expression in the cortex and liver and a decrease in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of double mutant mice. Conclusions/Significance The existence of separate mechanisms regulating phase of entrainment, rhythm amplitude and period length has been postulated before. The differential effects of Sharp-deficiency on rhythmicity and behavioral re-entrainment, coupled to tissue-dependent regulatory functions, provide a new mechanistic basis to further understand the complex process of clock synchronizations."
https://openalex.org/W2118164456,"A 50-fold variation in mRNA and protein levels of the mesoderm-specific transcript gene (Mest) in white fat of C57BL/6J (B6) mice fed an obesogenic diet is positively correlated with expansion of fat mass. MEST protein was detected only in adipocytes, in which its induction occurred with both unsaturated and saturated dietary fat. To test the hypothesis that MEST modulates fat mass expansion, its expression was compared to that of stearoyl CoA desaturase (Scd1) in B6 mice exposed to diets and environmental temperatures that generated conditions separating the effects of food intake and adiposity. Under a range of conditions, Mest expression was always associated with variations in adiposity, whereas Scd1 expression was associated with the amount of saturated fat in the diet. Mest mRNA was expressed at its highest levels during early postnatal growth at the onset of the most rapid phase of fat mass expansion. MEST is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi apparatus where its putative enzymatic properties as a lipase or acyltransferase, predicted from sequence homology with members of the alpha/beta fold hydrolase superfamily, can enable it to function in lipid accumulation under conditions of positive energy balance. Variations in adiposity and Mest expression in genetically identical mice also provides a model of epigenetic regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1994856122,"Mice lacking the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR7 are hypersensitive to convulsant drugs. But how does mGluR7 act to prevent seizures? Here the authors show that interfering with the interaction between mGluR7 and the intracellular adaptor protein PICK1 causes a phenotype in mice and rats that is reminiscent of human absence epilepsy. Absence epilepsy is a neurological disorder that causes a recurrent loss of consciousness and generalized spike-and-wave discharges on an electroencephalogram (EEG). The role of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and associated scaffolding proteins in absence epilepsy has been unclear to date. We investigated a possible role for these proteins in absence epilepsy, focusing on the mGluR7a receptor and its PDZ-interacting protein, protein interacting with C kinase 1 (PICK1), in rats and mice. Injection of a cell-permeant dominant-negative peptide or targeted mutation of the mGluR7a C terminus, both of which disrupt the interaction between the receptor and PDZ proteins, caused behavioral symptoms and EEG discharges that are characteristic of absence epilepsy. Inactivation of the Pick1 gene also facilitated pharmacological induction of the absence epilepsy phenotype. The cortex and thalamus, which are known to participate in absence epilepsy, were involved, but the hippocampus was not. Our results indicate that disruption of the mGluR7a-PICK1 complex is sufficient to induce absence epilepsy–like seizures in rats and mice, thus providing, to the best of our knowledge, the first animal model of metabotropic glutamate receptor–PDZ protein interaction in absence epilepsy."
https://openalex.org/W2121332924,"Visual working memory capacity is extremely limited and appears to be relatively immune to practice effects or the use of explicit strategies. The recent discovery that visual working memory tasks, like verbal working memory tasks, are subject to proactive interference, coupled with the fact that typical visual working memory tasks are particularly conducive to proactive interference, suggests that visual working memory capacity may be systematically under-estimated.Working memory capacity was probed behaviorally in adult humans both in laboratory settings and via the Internet. Several experiments show that although the effect of proactive interference on visual working memory is significant and can last over several trials, it only changes the capacity estimate by about 15%.This study further confirms the sharp limitations on visual working memory capacity, both in absolute terms and relative to verbal working memory. It is suggested that future research take these limitations into account in understanding differences across a variety of tasks between human adults, prelinguistic infants and nonlinguistic animals."
https://openalex.org/W2025980374,"Background Probiotic bacteria have been shown to modulate immune responses and could have therapeutic effects in allergic and inflammatory disorders. However, the signaling pathways engaged by probiotics are poorly understood. We have previously reported that a fermentation product from Bifidobacterium breve C50 (BbC50sn) could induce maturation, high IL-10 production and prolonged survival of DCs via a TLR2 pathway. We therefore studied the roles of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways on biological functions of human monocyte-derived DCs treated with BbC50sn. Methodology/Principal Findings DCs were differentiated from human monocytes with IL-4 and GM-CSF for 5 days and cultured with BbC50sn, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or Zymosan, with or without specific inhibitors of p38MAPK (SB203580), ERK (PD98059), PI3K (LY294002) and GSK3 (SB216763). We found that 1) the PI3K pathway was positively involved in the prolonged DC survival induced by BbC50sn, LPS and Zymosan in contrast to p38MAPK and GSK3 which negatively regulated DC survival; 2) p38MAPK and PI3K were positively involved in DC maturation, in contrast to ERK and GSK3 which negatively regulated DC maturation; 3) ERK and PI3K were positively involved in DC-IL-10 production, in contrast to GSK3 that was positively involved in DC-IL-12 production whereas p38MAPK was positively involved in both; 4) BbC50sn induced a PI3K/Akt phosphorylation similar to Zymosan and a p38MAPK phosphorylation similar to LPS. Conclusion/Significance We report for the first time that a fermentation product of a bifidobacteria can differentially activate MAPK, GSK3 and PI3K in order to modulate DC biological functions. These results give new insights on the fine-tuned balance between the maintenance of normal mucosal homeostasis to commensal and probiotic bacteria and the specific inflammatory immune responses to pathogen bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2059664914,"The lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor, LSR, is a multimeric protein complex in the liver that undergoes conformational changes upon binding of free fatty acids, thereby revealing a binding site (s) that recognizes both apoB and apoE. Complete inactivation of the LSR gene is embryonic lethal in mice. Here we show that removal of a single LSR allele (LSR-/+) caused statistically significant increases in both plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels, a 2-fold increase in plasma triglyceride changes during the post-prandial phase, and delayed clearance of lipid emulsions or a high fat meal. The longer postprandial lipoprotein clearance time observed in LSR-/+ mice was further increased in LSR-/+ mice lacking functional low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors. LSR-/+ mice placed on a Western-type diet displayed higher plasma triglycerides and cholesterol levels, increased triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and LDL, and increased aorta lipid content, as compared with control mice on the same diet. Furthermore, a direct correlation was observed between the hyperlipidemia and weight gain but only in the LSR-/+ mice. Knockdown of LSR expression by small interfering RNA in mouse Hepa1-6 cells led to decreased internalization of both DiI-labeled cyclohexanedione-LDL and very low density lipoprotein in the presence of oleate. These data led us to conclude that LSR contributes to the physiological clearance of atherogenic triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and LDL.

Both types of particles deliver their TG load to peripheral tissues through interactions with lipoprotein lipase (LpL) anchored to capillary endothelium heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) (1Havel R.J.

The residual cholesterol enriched inter-mediate density lipoprotein (IDL) and LDL for VLDL, and chylomicrons remnants are then removed from the circulation by hepatocytes. Clearance of these lipoproteins in the liver is a complex process through which the particles enter the space of Disse, bind to HSPGs, acquire apoE, and interact with hepatic lipase and LpL (2Mahley R.W. Huang Y. J. Clin. Investig. 2007; 117: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). After this, the residual particles are delivered to endocytic receptors for cellular internalization and degradation (3Sherrill B.C. Dietschy J.M. J. Biol.

The LDL receptor (LDL-R) accounts for most of LDL removal and contributes to part of the uptake of chylomicron remnants (4de Faria E. Fong L.G. Komaromy M. Cooper A.D. J.

This highly informative endocytic receptor prototype nevertheless leaves two unsolved issues regarding apoB-containing lipoprotein clearance. First, in the absence of functional LDL-R, the amount of LDL cleared daily is 2-fold greater than that of subjects with normal LDL-R activity (6Simons L.A. Reichl D. Myant N.B. Mancini M. Atherosclerosis. 1975; 21: 283-298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and has been shown to take place in the liver (7Attie A.D. Pittman R.C. Steinberg D. Hepatology. 1982; 2: 269-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Second, the clearance of intestinally derived chylomicron remnants proceeds at normal rates in human subjects and Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits with genetic lesions leading to complete impairment of LDL-R function (8Kita T. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Watanabe Y. Hornick C.A. Havel R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3623-3627Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 9Rubinsztein D.C. Cohen J.C.

Identification of the molecular mechanisms and, thus, of the receptor (s) that cooperates with the LDL-R for the liver's specific capture of chylomicrons and LDL remains controversial. The LDL receptor-related protein (LRP1) of the LDL-R family (10Herz J. Hamann U. Rogne S. Myklebost O. Gausepohl H. Stanley K.K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4119-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar) has been proposed as the primary candidate for the clearance of chylomicron remnants (11Rohlmann A. Gotthardt M. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). However, liver inactivation of LRP1 gene alone does not cause hyperlipidemia per se (11Rohlmann A. Gotthardt M. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). An accumulation of apoB48 lipoproteins is observed only if hepatic LRP1 is inactivated in mice lacking the LDL-R (11Rohlmann A. Gotthardt M. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), suggesting that LRP1 plays a supporting rather than a principal role in the clearance of remnants in the liver. Cell studies have shown that HSPGs are directly involved in internalization of apoE-enriched and lipase-associated lipoproteins (12Ji Z.S. Brecht W.J. Miranda R.D. Hussain M.M. Innerarity T.L.

Reduction of sulfation of hepatic heparan sulfate leads to a delayed clearance of both intestinally derived and hepatic apoB-containing lipoproteins independent of the LDL-R or LRP1, clearly demonstrating that the processing of the particles in the space of Disse involving cell surface proteoglycans is a critical and necessary step before endocytic uptake of the lipoprotein (14MacArthur J.M.

The final internalization step may be mediated by HSPGs themselves or by another as yet unidentified remnant receptor that would act downstream of HSPG-dependent lipolytic processing of lipoproteins. We have proposed an alternate mechanism for remnant lipoprotein clearance mediated by a receptor that in cell culture and liver membrane studies was shown to be activated by the products of lipolysis, free fatty acids (FFAs) (15Bihain B.E.

All animals were provided a normal rodent chow diet and water ad libitum in a room maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle with a mean temperature of 21 ± 2°C and relative humidity of 50 ± 20%. Animals were handled in accordance with French State Council guidelines for the use and care of laboratory animals.

Postprandial Lipemia and Intralipid Studies—Blood samples in EDTA were obtained at the indicated times by retroorbital puncture under light isofluorane anesthesia. After centrifugation at 4 °C (10,000 rpm, 5 min), the plasma fraction was then immediately analyzed or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for later analysis. For TG clearance studies, Intralipid was administered as a bolus injection in the tail vein (100 μl of a 2.6% solution in sterile physiological saline) at 9 a.m. in non-fasting animals. Pilot studies showed that the TG peak was achieved at 2 min. For induced postprandial lipemia experiments, overnight-fasted mice were gavaged with 300 μl of olive oil.

Lipoprotein Profiles—The plasma samples of 3 mice from the same group were pooled (210 μl total) and then added to 290 μl of 30 mm phosphate buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.02% sodium azide, pH 7.4. This was applied to a Superose 6 10-300 GL column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with the same buffer (0.2 ml/min). Fractions of 500 μl were collected and then analyzed for TC and TG content using the enzymatic kits described above. Preliminary runs with plasma obtained from C57Bl/6J control mice were performed with the same column under identical conditions to determine the location of the VLDL (fractions 1-7), LDL (fractions 8-14), and HDL (fractions 15-22) peaks. Aorta Staining—Tissue cryosections (8 μm) in OCT were prepared using a cryostat (Microm HM550), air-dried on gelatin-covered slides, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Slides were stained in 0.5% Oil Red O in propylene glycol followed by counterstaining in Harris' hematoxylin solution and then mounted in Gel/Mount (Microm). siRNA Studies—siRNA targeted toward LSR (Silencer® pre-designed siRNA, ID166924, Genbank™ NM_017405) and an siRNA negative control (Silencer® Negative Control #1) were obtained from Ambion (Applied Biosystems). siRNA were transfected into mouse hepatoma Hepa1-6 cells plated 48 h earlier on coverslips and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% glutamine and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Transfections were performed using Interferin® (Polyplus Transfection) according to the manufacturer's instructions. LDL and VLDL were isolated from pooled human plasma as described previously (18Yen F.T. Masson M. Clossais-Besnard N. Andre P. Grosset J.M. Bougueleret L. Dumas J.B. Guerassimenko O. Bihain B.E. J.

Lipoproteins were labeled with 1, 1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′, 3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) (30Innerarity T.L. Pitas R.E. Mahley R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 542-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and used within 1 week of their preparation. DiI-LDL preparations were treated with cyclohexanedione (CHD) (31Shepherd J. Packard C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 566-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and immediately used upon modification. Uptake studies using DiI-labeled lipoproteins were performed as previously described (18Yen F.T. Masson M. Clossais-Besnard N. Andre P. Grosset J.M. Bougueleret L. Dumas J.B. Guerassimenko O.

Briefly, siRNA-transfected Hepa1-6 cells were treated 30 min with 20 ng/ml recombinant mouse leptin (Sigma-Aldrich) (18Yen F.T. Masson M. Clossais-Besnard N. Andre P. Grosset J.M. Bougueleret L.

Cells were washed, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylin-dole to identify nuclei. Digital images were obtained using identical exposure times for cells treated with either control or LSR siRNA. Image analysis of DiI-labeled cells was then performed on the same number of cells (n = 20) in quadruplicate using the ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). All experiments were performed in duplicate. Western Blotting—Liver total and plasma membranes were prepared as described previously (22Mann C.J. Troussard A.A. Yen F.T. Hannouche N. Najib J.

Protein was solubilized directly in sample buffer, and identical amounts of protein (20-50 μg) (32Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Tolbert N.E. Bieber L.L. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 72: 296-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar) were applied to Novex 4-12% SDS-PAGE gels. For in vitro experiments, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing anti-proteases before separation by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, separated proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes for Western blotting as described previously (18Yen F.T. Masson M. Clossais-Besnard N. Andre P. Grosset J.M.

Loading was systematically verified using Ponceau Red staining. Bands were revealed by chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare) using a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and a chemiluminescence kit (GE Healthcare). Densitometric analysis of the autoradio-graphs was performed using a Versadoc imaging system (Bio-Rad). Genotyping—Tail genomic DNA was used for genotyping. PCR conditions and primers for wild-type LSR were used as previously described (25Mesli S. Javorschi S. Berard A.M. Landry M. Priddle H. Kivlichan D. Smith A.J. Yen F.T. Bihain B.E. Darmon M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 3103-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For the transgene, oligos used were forward primer, 5′-GCTTTTCTGGATTCATCGACTGT-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-TTACCCATTTTCTTATCCTCTCTTCC-3′, corresponding to intron 5 of LSR gene and the neomycin cassette, respectively. PCR conditions for the neo gene were 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 90 s for 32 cycles. For both wild-type and mutant cases, PCR cycles were preceded by 5 min at 94 °C and ended by 7 min at 72 °C. Real-time RT-PCR—Tissue or cell samples were stored in RNALater (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Lysates were prepared by homogenizing tissue in nucleic acid purification lysis solution (Applied Biosystems, 20-30 mg per 2 ml). Total RNA was purified using the 6100 Nucleic acid Prepstation system (Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was prepared from 250 ng of total RNA by RT-PCR and used for quantitation of mouse LSR, LDL-R, LRP1, and two reference genes (GAPDH and hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase) by real-time RT-PCR (see Table 1 for primer sequences used). LSR PCR primers were designed for the detection of all three forms of LSR, and primers for all genes were validated for identical efficiencies. cDNA equivalent to 15 ng of total RNA was added to SYBR Green JumpStart Taq ReadyMix (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 200 nm forward and reverse primers in a total of 25 μl, and real-time RT-PCR analysis was performed on an Applied 7500 system. Relative expression was then calculated as 2-ΔΔCT.TABLE 1Sequences of primers used for real-time PCRGenePrimerSequence (5′-3′)LocationAmplicon lengthbpLSRForwardCAGGAGAATCACCATCACAGGAAExon 277ReverseAGTAATACACTCCACTGTCTCCCCAGExon 3LDL-RForwardCTGGTGACCGAAAACATCCAGTExon 1176ReverseAATCAACCCAATAGAGACGGCCExon 12LRP1ForwardGTGTATGACGAGAGCATCCAGCTAGExon 33109ReverseAGGAGCGAGTCGTCTCTGATGTTExon 34GAPDHForwardCTCAACTACATGGTCTACATGTTCCAGExon 3150ReverseCTCACCCCATTTGATGTTAGTGGExon 3HPRTForwardTCAGACTGAAGAGCTACTGTAATGATCAExon 376ReverseAAAGTTGAGAGATCATCTCCACCAAExon 4 Open table in a new tab Statistical Analysis—All results are shown as the mean ± S.E. unless otherwise indicated. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test comparing LSR+/+ to LSR-/+ or paired t test as indicated; significance was considered as p < 0.05. Statistical analysis of real-time RT-PCR results were performed using the Relative Expression Software Tool-Multiple Condition Solver (REST-MCS©, Version 2). Areas under the curves of the postprandial lipemia data were calculated using the trapeze method. The method used to produce LSR-/+ mice was described previously (25Mesli S. Javorschi S. Berard A.M. Landry M. Priddle H. Kivlichan D. Smith A.J. Yen F.T. Bihain B.E. Darmon M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 3103-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These mice were crossbred into C57Bl/6J background for >4 generations. Real-time RT-PCR was performed in liver mRNA isolated from LSR-/+ and their LSR+/+ littermates to measure expression of LSR, LDL-R, and LRP1 relative to those of two reference genes, hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, and GAPDH. Results of Fig. 1A show that LSR mRNA, but not those of LDL-R or LRP1, was decreased in mice with a single functional LSR allele. Lower LSR gene expression led to decreased LSR protein in liver membrane preparations (Fig. 1B). The Sigma LSR affinity-purified antibody used revealed the β subunit (predicted molecular mass, 58.6 kDa) in liver total membranes (Fig. 1B, top panel), which was previously shown to be more abundant than the α and α′ subunits (18Yen F.T. Masson M. Clossais-Besnard N. Andre P. Grosset J.M. Bougueleret L. Dumas J.B. Guerassimenko O. Bihain B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13390-13398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Western blots were also performed on enriched protein fractions solubilized from liver plasma membranes using the anti-LSR-C-term antibody (Fig. 9B, bottom panel). Densitometric analysis revealed that the average signal of the sum of the 2 bands that correspond to α (apparent molecular mass, 63 kDa) and β (apparent molecular mass, 58 kDa) subunits were 0.74 ± 0.04 (LSR+/+, n = 4) and 0.26 ± 0.04 arbitrary units (LSR-/+, n = 4, p < 0.001), respectively. Thus, in LSR-/+ mice, both hepatic LSR mRNA and LSR protein were reduced by more than 50% relative to LSR+/+ with the same genetic background. Western blots were performed on the same liver total membrane preparations used in Fig. 1B, top panel, to determine whether LDL-R and LRP1 protein levels were modified. Neither expression of hepatic LDL-R nor that of LRP1 was significantly decreased in LSR-/+ animals (Fig. 1C). We first measured changes in plasma TG occurring during the physiological post-prandial phase in LSR-/+ and LSR+/+ mice on a normal chow diet. Blood was collected from 6-week-old mice at the beginning of the light cycle and then after 3 h with access only to water. The increase in plasma TG that occurred between these 2 time points was 2-fold and significantly (p < 0.04) greater in LSR-/+ mice (Fig. 2A). Fasting LSR-/+ and control mice were challenged with dietary lipid administered through gavage feeding, and plasma TG levels were recorded before and 1, 2, and 3 h after the lipid challenge. Fig. 2B shows that the lack of a single LSR allele caused a significant increase in postprandial TG levels most notably 2 h (p < 0.04) and 3 h (p < 0.03) after the meal. The area under the curve was 3.8-fold greater in LSR-/+ as compared with LSR+/+ mice. To rule out that these differences could result from changes in intestinal lipid absorption, two groups of mice were injected intravenously with a bolus of Intralipid followed by blood sampling at 2 and 30 min.

In vitro studies have demonstrated that Smad7 regulates transforming growth factor-β and BMP signals by inhibiting Smad pathways in chondrocytes. However, the in vivo roles of Smad7 during cartilage development are unknown. To investigate distinct effects of Smad7 at different stages during chondrocyte differentiation, we generated a series of conditional transgenic mice that overexpress Smad7 in chondrocytes at various steps of differentiation by using the Cre/loxP system. We generated Col11a2-lacZfloxed-Smad7 transgenic mice and mated them with three types of Cre transgenic mice to obtain Smad7Prx1, Smad711Enh, and Smad711Prom conditional transgenic mice. Smad7Prx1 mice overexpressing Smad7 in condensing mesenchymal cells showed disturbed mesenchymal condensation associated with decreased Sox9 expression, leading to poor cartilage formation. Smad711Enh mice overexpressing Smad7 in round chondrocytes showed decreased chondrocyte proliferation rates. Smad711Prom mice overexpressing Smad7 in flat chondrocytes showed inhibited maturation of chondrocytes toward hypertrophy. Micromass culture of mesenchymal cells showed that BMP-induced cartilaginous nodule formation was down-regulated by overexpression of Smad7, but not Smad6. Overexpression of Smad7, but not Smad6, down-regulated the phosphorylation of p38 MAPKs. Our data provide in vivo evidence for distinct effects of Smad7 at different stages during chondrocyte differentiation and suggest that Smad7 in prechondrogenic cells inhibits chondrocyte differentiation possibly by down-regulating BMP-activated p38 MAPK pathways.

This family includes three major subfamilies: TGFs-β, activins, and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). Signaling by members of the TGF-β superfamily is transduced through type I and II serine/threonine kinase receptors (1.Miyazono K. Kusanagi K. Inoue H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, type II receptors phosphorylate type I receptors. Next, type I receptors phosphorylate downstream targets. Receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads) are phosphorylated by type I receptors (2.Massague J. Seoane J. Wotton D. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2783-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1908) Google Scholar). Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 are R-Smads that transduce BMP signals, and Smad2 and Smad3 are R-Smads that transduce TGF-β and activin signals. Phosphorylated R-Smads form heteromers with Smad4, which is a common-partner Smad (referred to as Co-Smad), and translocate into the nucleus. There, they interact with transcription factors and activate gene transcription. Although the Smad pathway exists in most cell types and tissues, additional pathways are activated by BMP/TGF-β in certain cell types (3.Derynck R. Zhang Y.E. Nature. 2003; 425: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (4230) Google Scholar). BMP and TGF-β activate TAK1 (TGF-β-activated kinase 1), a member of the MAPK kinase kinase family. TAK1 is involved in the activation of several MAPKs, including JNK, p38, and ERK, which ultimately results in the activation of ATF2. TGF-β also activates Rho signaling pathways. Inhibitory Smads including Smad6 and Smad7 inhibit phosphorylation of R-Smads by competing with R-Smads for binding to phosphorylated type I receptors (2.Massague J. Seoane J. Wotton D. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2783-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1908) Google Scholar). Smad6 inhibits BMP signaling, whereas Smad7 inhibits both TGF-β and BMP signaling. Smad6 has narrow specificity in its interaction with receptors (4.Goto K. Kamiya Y. Imamura T. Miyazono K. Miyazawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20603-20611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Smad6 and Smad7 inhibit BMP-activated p38 MAPK pathways in neuronal cells (5.Yanagisawa M. Nakashima K. Takeda K. Ochiai W. Takizawa T. Ueno M. Takizawa M. Shibuya H. Taga T. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 1091-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Smad6 and Smad7 interact differently with TAK1 in PC12 cells. Smad6 and Smad7 are differentially expressed during development (6.Luukko K. Ylikorkala A. Makela T.P. Mech. Dev. 2001; 101: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Mice deficient in exon 1 of Smad7 have abnormal B-cell responses and are small (7.Li R. Rosendahl A. Brodin G. Cheng A.M. Ahgren A. Sundquist C. Kulkarni S. Pawson T. Heldin C.H. Heuchel R.L. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 6777-6784Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Data on skeletal tissues of these mice are not available. These mice have partial Smad7 function because N-terminally truncated forms of the Smad7 transcript may be produced (7.Li R. Rosendahl A. Brodin G. Cheng A.M. Ahgren A. Sundquist C. Kulkarni S. Pawson T. Heldin C.H. Heuchel R.L. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 6777-6784Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). During development, the limb skeleton is formed through endochondral bone formation, which consists of multiple steps of cellular differentiation (8.Kronenberg H.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2006; 1068: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 9.Olsen B.R. Reginato A.M. Wang W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 191-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Mesenchymal cells initially undergo condensation, which is followed by the differentiation of prechondrogenic cells within these condensations into round chondrocytes to form cartilage. Round chondrocytes in cartilage proliferate and produce cartilage extracellular matrix composed of collagen fibrils and proteoglycans. Proliferating chondrocytes in the central region of the cartilage then exit the cell cycle and differentiate into hypertrophic chondrocytes. The proliferating chondrocytes closest to the hypertrophic chondrocytes flatten out and form orderly columns of still proliferating flat chondrocytes. The zone of the hypertrophic chondrocytes is invaded by blood vessels along with osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and hematopoietic cells to form primary ossification centers. BMPs play critical roles at various stages in endochondral bone formation (10.Kobayashi T. Lyons K.M. McMahon A.P. Kronenberg H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18023-18027Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Cartilage formation is severely disturbed in mice lacking BMP receptors (11.Yoon B.S. Ovchinnikov D.A. Yoshii I. Mishina Y.

Res. 2002; 17: 898-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), in prechondrogenic cells; these results suggest that BMP signaling is necessary for cartilage formation. Smad7 is expressed in growth plate cartilage (13.Sakou T. Onishi T. Yamamoto T. Nagamine T. Sampath T. Ten Dijke P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 1145-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and osteoarthritic cartilage (14.Bauge C. Legendre F. Leclercq S. Elissalde J.M. Pujol J.P. Galera P. Boumediene K.

These in vitro studies have demonstrated down-regulation of R-Smad activation by Smad7 in chondrocytes. On the other hand, recent mouse genetic studies have revealed mild abnormalities in cartilage in mice lacking Smad4 (20.Zhang J. Tan X. Li W. Wang Y. Wang J. Cheng X. Yang X. Dev. Biol. 2005; 284: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and in mice overexpressing Smad6 (21.Horiki M. Imamura T. Okamoto M. Hayashi M. Murai J. Myoui A. Ochi T. Miyazono K. Yoshikawa H. Tsumaki N. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 433-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) in chondrocytes, raising the possibilities that non-Smad pathways may also mediate BMP-induced cartilage formation. In addition, conditional inactivation of the TGF-β type II receptor gene (Tgfbr2) in prechondrogenic cells and chondrocytes results in mice without any long bone defects, leading to the conclusion that TGF-β signaling is not needed in the limb endochondral process (22.Baffi M.O. Slattery E. Sohn P. Moses H.L. Chytil A. Serra R. Dev. Biol. 2004; 276: 124-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In vivo effects of Smad7 on cartilage development are unknown and thus are worth examining. To examine the effects of Smad7 during cartilage development, we generated a series of conditional transgenic mice that overexpress Smad7 in chondrocytes at various steps of differentiation by using the Cre/loxP system. Smad7 overexpression in prechondrogenic cells disturbed mesenchymal condensation, leading to poor cartilage formation. Smad7 overexpression in round chondrocytes inhibited cell proliferation, and Smad7 overexpression in flat chondrocytes delayed hypertrophy. Micromass cultures of mesenchymal cells revealed that Smad7 inhibited cartilaginous nodule formation possibly by down-regulating p38 MAPK pathways activated by BMP. Construction of the Transgene—The α2(XI) collagen gene (Col11a2)-based expression vector, p742lacZInt, contains the Col11a2 promoter (-742 to +380), an SV40 RNA splice site, the β-galactosidase reporter gene (lacZ), the SV40 polyadenylation signal, and 2.3 kb of the first intron sequence of Col11a2 as an enhancer (23.Tsumaki N. Kimura T. Matsui Y. Nakata K. Ochi T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To create a Col11a2-lacZfloxed-Smad7 transgene plasmid, a loxP sequence was inserted into the 5′-untranslated region of lacZ p742lacZInt, and the NotI sites at both ends of the lacZ segment were mutated and abolished. Next, a sequence consisting of an SV40 RNA splice site, a loxP sequence, a NotI site, and the SV40 polyadenylation signal was inserted into the 3′-end of the SV40 polyadenylation signal of the plasmid. Finally, mouse Smad7 cDNA tagged with NotI sites at both ends was inserted into the NotI site. To create the Col11a2prom-Cre-enh plasmid, the lacZ sequence in p742lacZInt was replaced with a NotI-tagged Cre sequence at the NotI sites. To create the Col11a2prom-Cre plasmid, the lacZ sequence in p742lacZ (23.Tsumaki N. Kimura T. Matsui Y. Nakata K. Ochi T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) was replaced with a NotI-tagged Cre sequence at NotI sites. Generation and Preparation of Transgenic Mice—The plasmids Col11a2-lacZfloxed-Smad7, Col11a2prom-Cre-enh, and Col11a2prom-Cre were digested with EcoRI and PstI to release the inserts. Transgenic mice were produced by microinjecting each of the inserts into the pronuclei of fertilized eggs from F1 hybrid mice (C57BL/6 × DBA) as described previously (23.Tsumaki N. Kimura T. Matsui Y. Nakata K. Ochi T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Transgenic embryos were identified by PCR assays of genomic DNA extracted from the placenta or skin. For Col11a2-lacZfloxed-Smad7 transgenic mice, primers derived from mouse Smad7 cDNA (5′-GGA TGG CGT GTG GGT TTA-3′) and from the SV40 poly(A) signal region (5′-GGT TTG TCC AAA CTC ATC AAT-3′) were used to amplify a 346-bp product. For Cre transgenic mice, primers derived from Cre (5′-CAA TTT ACT GAC CGT ACA CCA A-3′ and 5′-TCT TCA GGT TCT GCG GG-3′) were used to amplify a 187-bp product. Prx1-Cre transgenic mice were a kind gift from Dr. Malcolm Logan (24.Logan M. Martin J.F. Nagy A. Lobe C. Olson E.N. Tabin C.J. Genesis. 2002; 33: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Col11a2-lacZfloxed-Smad7 transgenic mice were mated with Prx1-Cre, Col11a2prom-Cre-enh, or Col11a2prom-Cre transgenic mice to obtain various Smad7 conditional transgenic mice. Conventional Col11a2-Smad6 transgenic mice were described previously (21.Horiki M. Imamura T. Okamoto M. Hayashi M. Murai J. Myoui A. Ochi T. Miyazono K. Yoshikawa H. Tsumaki N. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 433-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Staining of the Skeleton—Embryos were dissected, fixed in 100% ethanol overnight, and then stained with Alcian blue followed by alizarin red S solution according to standard protocols (25.Peters P.W.J. Neuberg H.J.M.D. Kwasigroch T.E. Methods in Prenatal Toxicology. Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, Germany1977: 153-154Google Scholar). Histological Analysis—Embryos were dissected with a stereomicroscope, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, processed, and embedded in paraffin. Serial sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin or with safranin O/fast green/iron hematoxylin. Immunohistochemistry was performed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against Smad7 (1:100 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Immune complexes were detected using streptavidin-peroxidase staining and Histofine SAB-PO kits (Nichirei, Tokyo, Japan). RNA in situ hybridization was performed using 35S-labeled antisense riboprobes as described previously (45.Pelton R.W. Dickinson M.E. Moses H.L. Hogan B.L. Development (Camb.). 1990; 110: 609-620PubMed Google Scholar). To detect proliferating cells in tissue sections, digoxigenin-11-UTP-labeled Hist2 (histone cluster 2) RNA probes were prepared (26.Muskhelishvili L. Latendresse J.R. Kodell R.L. Henderson E.B. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2003; 51: 1681-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Micromass Culture of Mesenchymal Cells—Micromass culture was performed according to previously described methods (27.Fujimaki R. Toyama Y. Hozumi N. Tezuka K. J. Bone Miner. Metab. 2006; 24: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The distal quarters of limb buds from 12.0-day postcoitus (dpc) wild-type and transgenic mouse embryos were dissected and digested with 0.1% collagenase (Sigma) and 0.1% trypsin (Sigma) for 45 min in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The dissociated cells were filtered through nylon mesh (40-μm pore size; Tokyo Screen, Tokyo) to generate a single cell suspension and were then adjusted to 2 × 107 cells/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell suspensions (20-ml drops) were placed in the center of each well of 12-well plates. After the cells were allowed to attach for 90 min in 10% CO2 at 37 °C, they were overlaid with 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The medium was replaced by fresh medium every other day. To induce cartilaginous nodule formation, medium containing 50 or 100 ng/ml recombinant human BMP2 (rhBMP2) (Astellas Pharma, Tokyo) in 10% fetal bovine serum was used unless specifically described otherwise. For infection with adenoviral vectors for Smad6 and Smad7 (18.Fujii M. Takeda K. Imamura T. Aoki H. Sampath T.K. Enomoto S. Kawabata M. Kato M. Ichijo H. Miyazono K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3801-3813Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), cells were infected 1 day after plating. For Alcian blue staining, micromass cultures 4 days after plating were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and stained overnight with 1% Alcian blue in 3% acetic acid at 37 °C. The cultures were then digitally photographed with a Nikon SMZ-U microscope. The size and number of nodules were measured using WinROOF software (Mitani Shoji, Fukui, Japan). For Western blot analysis, adenovirus-infected cells were starved for 16 h before replacement with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the presence or absence of rhBMP2. Cells were lysed 1 h after treatment with rhBMP2. For activation of MAPK pathways, 2 ng/ml anisomycin (Sigma) was added to the culture medium and used as a positive control. Total RNA extracted from micromass culture in the presence of 100 ng/ml rhBMP2 was digested with DNase to eliminate any contaminating genomic DNA before real-time quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Real-time RT-PCR was performed as described previously (21.Horiki M. Imamura T. Okamoto M. Hayashi M. Murai J. Myoui A. Ochi T. Miyazono K. Yoshikawa H. Tsumaki N. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 433-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The primer pair for Id1 was as follows: up, 5′-GCA TCT TGT GTC GCT GAG-3′; and down, 5′-TGG CTG CGG TAG TGT CTT-3′. The product size was 122 bp. ATDC5 Cell Culture—ATDC5 cells were a kind gift from Dr. Y. Hiraki. The cells were maintained at 20–80% confluency as described previously (28.Shukunami C. Shigeno C. Atsumi T. Ishizeki K. Suzuki F. Hiraki Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). After infection of ATDC5 cells with adenoviral vectors for LacZ, Smad6, Smad7, and constitutively active MKK3, the cells were washed and then starved for 16 h. The medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the presence or absence of rhBMP2. One hour after treatment with rhBMP2, the cells were lysed and subjected to Western blotting. For activation of MAPK pathways, 2 ng/ml anisomycin was added to the culture medium and used as a positive control. Western Blotting—Cells were cultured, lysed, subjected to SDS-PAGE, electroblotted, and immunostained. The antibodies used were anti-Smad7 antibody (1:200 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.); anti-Smad6 antibody (1:200 dilution; Zymed Laboratories Inc.), anti-Smad1 antibody (1:1000 dilution; Calbiochem); anti-phospho-Smad1/5/8 antibody (1:1000 dilution), anti-phospho-ATF2 antibody (1:1000 dilution), anti-ATF2 antibody (1:1000 dilution), anti-phospho-p38 MAPK antibody (1:1000 dilution), anti-p38 MAPK antibody (1:1000 dilution), anti-phospho-Smad2 antibody (1:1000 dilution), and anti-Smad2/3 antibody (1:1000 dilution) (Cell Signaling Technology). Proteins in the blots were visualized using an ECL Plus kit (Amersham Biosciences). Generation of Floxed lacZ-Smad7 Transgenic Mice—Because Smad7 inhibits various signaling pathways, we anticipated that its overexpression in chondrocytes might cause severe cartilage abnormalities in transgenic mice. To avoid lethality, we employed a conditional transgenic mouse system to express the Smad7 transgene. We first established floxed lacZ-Smad7 transgenic mouse lines bearing the Col11a2-lacZfloxed-Smad7 transgene (Fig. 1A). Col11a2 promoter/enhancer sequences direct expression to condensed mesenchymal cells and chondrocytes (23.Tsumaki N. Kimura T. Matsui Y. Nakata K. Ochi T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We expected that the mice bearing this construct would express lacZ but not Smad7 due to the poly(A) signal sequence that immediately follows the lacZ sequence. In the presence of Cre recombinase, the lacZ sequence would be deleted, and Smad7 would be expressed instead of lacZ under the control of the Col11a2 promoter/enhancer sequences. We obtained and analyzed two independent lines of Col11a2-lacZfloxed-Smad7 transgenic mice. Staining of transgenic embryos from one line with X-gal showed that lacZ was expressed in condensed mesenchyme at 12.5 dpc (Fig. 1B) and in primordial cartilage in limbs and ribs at 14.5 dpc (Fig. 1C). Histological analysis confirmed lacZ activities specifically in mesenchymal condensation at 12.5 dpc (Fig. 1D) and in chondrocytes at 14.5 dpc (Fig. 1E). lacZ activities were not recognized in cells in the perichondrium (Fig. 1F). Transgenic embryos from the other line showed a similar but weaker (Fig. 1G) pattern of lacZ activities than the first line (Fig. 1C) at 14.5 dpc. Both lines of mice developed normally. Generation of Cre Transgenic Mice—Next, we prepared three types of Cre transgenic mice. First, Prx1-Cre transgenic mice were obtained from Dr. Malcolm Logan (24.Logan M. Martin J.F. Nagy A. Lobe C. Olson E.N. Tabin C.J. Genesis. 2002; 33: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Second, we linked the Cre sequence to the Col11a2 promoter plus intron enhancer to prepare the transgene construct 11Enh-Cre (Fig. 2A). Third, we prepared Cre linked to the Col11a2 promoter without an intron enhancer to prepare the transgene construct 11Prom-Cre (Fig. 2A). We injected 11Enh-Cre and 11Prom-Cre into fertilized ova and established transgenic lines. We examined the expression patterns of Cre by mating CAGCATfloxed-lacZ reporter transgenic mice (29.Sakai K. Miyazaki J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) with these Cre transgenic mice. As reported previously (24.Logan M. Martin J.F. Nagy A. Lobe C. Olson E.N. Tabin C.J. Genesis. 2002; 33: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar), Prx1-Cre mice showed Cre recombinase activity throughout the early limb bud mesenchyme at 12.5 dpc. (Fig. 2B). 11Enh-Cre transgenic mice started to show very weak Cre activities in mesenchymal condensation in forelimb buds at 12.5 dpc (Fig. 2C). 11Prom-Cre transgenic mice showed no lacZ activities in limb buds at 12.5 dpc (Fig. 2D). Aberrant Cre activities were recognized in forebrains. At 14.5 dpc, 11Enh-Cre transgenic mice showed Cre-mediated recombination in all primordial cartilage of limbs and ribs (Fig. 2E). In contrast, 11Prom-Cre transgenic mice showed recombination in a limited part of each primordial cartilage (Fig. 2F). X-gal staining was absent in the epiphyseal part of each primordial cartilage. Histological analysis of the distal ulnas of 11Enh-Cre transgenic mice at 14.5 dpc showed recombinase activities in all chondrocytes, including round proliferative chondrocytes, flat proliferative chondrocytes, prehypertrophic chondrocytes, hypertrophic chondrocytes, and perichondrial cells (Fig. 2G). Histological analysis of the distal ulnas of 11Prom-Cre transgenic mice at 14.5 dpc showed recombinase activities in flat chondrocytes, prehypertrophic chondrocytes, and hypertrophic chondrocytes, but not in round chondrocytes located at the ends of each primordial cartilage (Fig. 2H). These results suggest that 11Enh-Cre induces recombination from the step of round proliferative chondrocytes and that 11Prom-Cre induces recombination from the step of flat proliferative chondrocytes. The recombination pattern of our 11Enh-Cre transgenic mice was consistent with that of previously reported Cre transgenic mice containing identical promoter/enhancer sequences (30.Fujimaki R. Hayashi K. Watanabe N. Yamada T. Toyama Y. Tezuka K. Hozumi N. J. Bone Miner. Metab. 2005; 23: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). None of the Cre transgenic mice showed detectable abnormalities. Skeletal Abnormalities in Smad7 Conditional Transgenic Mice—We mated Col11a2-lacZfloxed-Smad7 transgenic mice with Prx1-Cre, 11Enh-Cre, and 11Prom-Cre transgenic mice, respectively, and generated double transgenic pups as follows: pups bearing Col11a2-lacZfloxed-Smad7 and Prx1-Cre transgenes (Smad7Prx1), those bearing Col11a2-lacZfloxed-Smad7 and 11Enh-Cre transgenes (Smad711Enh), and those bearing Col11a2-lacZfloxed-Smad7 and 11Prom-Cre transgenes (Smad711Prom). We examined the skeletons of Smad7 conditional transgenic mice. Staining with Alcian blue and alizarin red S revealed that the Smad7Prx1 double transgenic mice had very hypoplastic limb skeletons (Fig. 3B) compared with Col11a2-lacZfloxed-Smad7 control mice (Fig. 3A) at 16.5 dpc. The Smad7Prx1 axial skeleton was relatively preserved because the Prx1-Cre transgene directs Cre expression mainly in limbs. Hind limb skeletons were less affected than forelimb skeletons. Smad711Enh mice had moderately hypoplastic skeletons (Fig. 3C) compared with Col11a2-lacZfloxed-Smad7 control mice (Fig. 3A). Mineralization indicated by alizarin red staining was reduced in Smad711Enh mice. The cartilaginous components of Smad711Prom mice were slightly small (Fig. 3D) compared with those of Col11a2-lacZfloxed-Smad7 control mice (Fig. 3A). Mineralization was reduced slightly in Smad711Prom mice. We also mated the other line of Col11a2-lacZfloxed-Smad7 mice with Prx1-Cre mice, and the resultant Smad7Prx1 transgenic pups showed similar but milder abnormalities in limb skeleton (Fig. 3E) than the Smad7Prx1 mice from the first line of Col11a2-lacZfloxed-Smad7 mice (Fig. 3B). Overall, the skeletal lengths in each type of double transgenic pups varied with regard to cartilage size and mineralization depending on the types of Cre transgenic mice used for mating (Fig. 3F). Cre-mediated Recombination in Each Type of Conditional Transgenic Mice—The scheme in Fig. 4A shows the expected recombination events in this experiment. In Smad7Prx1 mice, recombination occurs in mesenchymal cells in limb buds before the onset of mesenchymal condensation when Col11a2 promoter/enhancer sequences start to direct expression. Thus, the expression of the Smad7 transgene in Smad7Prx1 mouse limbs may be controlled by Col11a2 promoter/enhancer sequences in the Col11a2-lacZfloxed-Smad7 transgene, and the Smad7 transgene may be gradually expressed from the step of condensed mesenchyme. The expression pattern of the Smad7 transgene in Smad7Prx1 conditional transgenic mouse limbs is considered to be similar to the expression pattern of the transgene expression in conventional transgenic mice bearing the Col11a2 promoter/enhancer. In Smad711Enh mice, recombination occurs at the step of round proliferative chondrocytes when the amount of Cre protein may be increased enough to catalyze recombination. In Smad711Prom mice, recombination occurs at the step of flat proliferative chondrocytes. We examined Cre-catalyzed recombination by monitoring the disappearance of lacZ activities. Col11a2-lacZfloxed-Smad7 mice showed LacZ expression in condensed mesenchyme at 12.5 dpc (Fig. 4B). Smad7Prx1 double transgenic mice did not exhibit LacZ expression (Fig. 4C), indicating that Prx1-Cre transgene products induced recombination of the Col11a2-lacZfloxed-Smad7 transgene in limb buds. Both Smad711Enh mice and Smad711Prom mice showed LacZ expression in condensed mesenchyme (Fig. 4, D and E), as did Col11a2-lacZfloxed-Smad7 control mice (Fig. 4B), indicating that recombination did not occur at this stage. At 14.5 dpc, Col11a2-lacZfloxed-Smad7 control mice showed LacZ expression in all primordial cartilage (Fig. 4F). Smad7Prx1 mice showed LacZ expression in primordial cartilage in the ribs and spine, but not in the limbs (Fig. 4G). LacZ expression in Smad711Enh mice disappeared in primordial cartilage in trunk and proximal segments in the limbs. LacZ expression remained in paws, which dev"
https://openalex.org/W1992070409,"The canonical Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is a highly conserved signaling cascade that is involved in development and stem cell renewal. The deregulation of this pathway is often associated with increased cell growth and neoplasia. The small GTPase Rac has been shown to influence canonical Wnt signaling by regulating beta-catenin stability through an unknown mechanism. We report that DOCK4, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rac and a member of the CDM family of unconventional GEFs, mediates Wnt-induced Rac activation in the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. DOCK4 expression regulates cellular beta-catenin levels in response to the Wnt signal, in vitro. Biochemical studies demonstrate that DOCK4 interacts with the beta-catenin degradation complex, consisting of the proteins adenomatosis polyposis coli, Axin and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta). This molecular interaction enhances beta-catenin stability and Axin degradation. Furthermore, we observe that DOCK4 is phosphorylated by GSK3beta, which enhances Wnt-induced Rac activation. Using a T-cell factor reporter zebrafish we confirm that DOCK4 is required for Wnt/beta-catenin activity, in vivo. These results elucidate a novel intracellular signaling mechanism in which a Rac GEF, DOCK4 acts as a scaffold protein in the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1973492092,"Three reading frames called ccmFN1, ccmFN2, and ccmFc are found in the mitochondrial genome of Arabidopsis. These sequences are similar to regions of the bacterial gene ccmF involved in cytochrome c maturation. ccmF genes are always absent from animal and fungi genomes but are found in mitochondrial genomes of land plant and several evolutionary distant eukaryotes. In Arabidopsis, ccmFN2 despite the absence of a classical initiation codon is not a pseudo gene. The 3 ccmF genes of Arabidopsis are expressed at the protein level. Their products are integral proteins of the mitochondrial inner membrane with in total 11 to 13 predicted transmembrane helices. The conserved WWD domain of CcmFN2 is localized in the inter membrane space. The 3 CcmF proteins are all detected in a high molecular mass complex of 500 kDa by Blue Native PAGE. Direct interaction between CcmFN2 and both CcmFN1 and CcmFC is shown with the yeast two-hybrid split ubiquitin system, but no interaction is observed between CcmFN1 and CcmFC. Similarly, interaction is detected between CcmFN2 and apocytochrome c but also with apocytochrome c1. Finally, CcmFN1 and CcmFN2 both interact with CCMH previously shown to interact as well with cytochrome c. This strengthens the hypothesis that CcmF and CCMH make a complex that performs the assembly of heme with c-type apocytochromes in plant mitochondria.

This strengthens the hypothesis that CcmF and CCMH make a complex that performs the assembly of heme with c-type apocytochromes in plant mitochondria. Plant mitochondrial genomes differ from other mitochondrial genomes by their larger size (1Ward B.L. Anderson R.S. Bendich A.J. Cell. 1981; 26: 793-803Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (292) Google Scholar). However, even if plant mitochondrial genomes are at least 15 times larger than their animal counterparts, they do not encode many more genes, e.g. 31 protein coding genes in Arabidopsis (2Unseld M. Marienfeld J.R. Brandt P. Brennicke A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar) and 13 in human (3Anderson S. Bankier A.T. Barrell B.G. de Bruijn M.H. Coulson A.R. Drouin J. Eperon I.C. Nierlich D.P. Roe B.A. Sanger F. Schreier P.H. Smith A.J. Staden R. Young I.G. Nature. 1981; 290: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (7644) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial gene contents are highly conserved. The genes encoded include components of essential mitochondrial functions, i.e. subunits of respiratory complexes and components of the mitochondrial translation apparatus. A major difference in gene content between plant and animal mitochondria resides in the occurrence in plants of ribosomal protein genes (2Unseld M. Marienfeld J.R. Brandt P. Brennicke A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar) and of ccm genes (for cytochrome c maturation) (4Gonzalez D.H. Bonnard G. Grienenberger J.M. Curr. Genet. 1993; 21: 248-255Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 5Schuster W. Combettes B. Flieger K. Brennicke A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 239: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These genes are similar to bacterial sequences found to be involved in the biogenesis of c-type cytochromes by genetic studies (6Kranz R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 456-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, 8 ccm genes (ccmA–H) are encoded at 1 locus in a single operon (7Beckman D.L. Trawick D.R. Kranz R.G. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 268-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). On the contrary, in plants, ccm genes are encoded by both the nucleus and mitochondria. In Arabidopsis, CCMA, CCME, and CCMH genes are encoded in the nucleus (8Rayapuram N. Hagenmuller J. Grienenberger J.M. Giege P. Bonnard G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21015-21023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 9Meyer E.H. Giegé P. Gelhaye E. Rayapuram N. Ahuja U. Thony-Meyer L. Grienenberger J.M. Bonnard G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16113-16118Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), whereas ccmB, ccmC, ccmFN1, ccmFN2, and ccmFc are encoded in the mitochondrial genome, at 5 different loci (2Unseld M. Marienfeld J.R. Brandt P. Brennicke A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). The latter 3 sequences are similar to different domains of the bacterial ccmF. ccmFN2 is not an “open reading frame” because it lacks a classical ATG initiation codon. However, transcription has been established for all the ccm sequences encoded in Arabidopsis mitochondria (10Giegé P. Brennicke A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15324-15329Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 11Raczynska K.D. Le Ret M. Rurek M. Bonnard G. Augustyniak H. Gualberto J.M. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 5641-5646Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ccm transcripts have the highest RNA editing rate within the Arabidopsis mitochondrial transcriptome, with 26 editing sites/kb on average (10Giegé P. Brennicke A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15324-15329Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Notable features are that RNA editing shortens the reading frame of ccmFC by introducing a termination codon (12Giegé P. Rayapuram N. Meyer E.H. Grienenberger J.M. Bonnard G. FEBS Lett. 2004; 563: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and that RNA editing is necessary for the conservation of the WWD motif of CcmFN (4Gonzalez D.H. Bonnard G. Grienenberger J.M. Curr. Genet. 1993; 21: 248-255Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 5Schuster W. Combettes B. Flieger K. Brennicke A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 239: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cytochromes of c-type are ubiquitous electron transporters. They are defined by the covalent attachment of heme C prosthetic groups to apocytochromes via two thioether bonds between vinyl groups on the heme and conserved cysteines on the protein. In mitochondria, these proteins are essential components of the respiratory chain involved in the generation of cellular energy. Two forms of these key proteins co-exist. They are present as soluble proteins, i.e. cytochrome c in the mitochondrial inter-membrane space and also as membrane proteins, i.e. cytochrome c1 integrated into respiratory complex III, the cytochrome c reductase in the mitochondrial inner membrane. The term “cytochrome c maturation” refers to the processes leading to the covalent attachment of heme to the apocytochromes. Different pathways have been described for this maturation (13Kranz R. Lill R. Goldman B. Bonnard G. Merchant S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In yeast and animal mitochondria, a maturation process called “system III” has evolved. It involves one or two cytochrome c heme lyases (CCHL proteins) (14Dumont M.E. Ernst J.F. Hampsey D.M. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). “System I” is found in α, in most γ proteobacteria, and in some β proteobacteria, in deinococci and archaea (6Kranz R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 456-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Page M.D. Ferguson S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and in mitochondria of land plants and of some protists and algae (16Lang B.F. Burger G. O'Kelly C.J. Cedergren R.

Mitochondrion. 2008; 8: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The proteins used by cytochrome c maturation system I are termed Ccm proteins. Among them, in plants, CCMA and CcmB form an ABC transporter (8Rayapuram N. Hagenmuller J. Grienenberger J.M. Giege P. Bonnard G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21015-21023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), CCME is a heme chaperone that was proposed to bind heme covalently in the intermembrane space where its covalent attachment with apocytochromes takes place (18Spielewoy N. Schulz H. Grienenberger J.M. Thony-Meyer L. Bonnard G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5491-5497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Finally, CCMH interacts with apocytochrome c and can reduce cysteines of apocytochrome c that are required to be reduced for the ligation with heme to occur (9Meyer E.H. Giegé P. Gelhaye E. Rayapuram N. Ahuja U. Thony-Meyer L. Grienenberger J.M. Bonnard G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16113-16118Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In bacteria, CcmABCDE are involved in the delivery of heme to its site of assembly (19Goldman B.S. Beck D.L. Monika E.M. Kranz R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5003-5008Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 20Thöny-Meyer L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 21Ren Q. Thony-Meyer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32591-32596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments show direct associations between CcmC and CcmE and between CcmF and both CcmE and CcmH (21Ren Q. Thony-Meyer L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 7657-7663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a tryptophan-rich domain, called the WWD domain is found in both CcmC and CcmF (CcmC and CcmFN2 in Arabidopsis). This motif has been proposed to serve as a hydrophobic platform for heme binding (19Goldman B.S. Beck D.L. Monika E.M. Kranz R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5003-5008Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) but other studies in bacteria suggest that this motif is needed for the interaction between CcmC and CcmE (22Ren Q. Ahuja U. Thony-Meyer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7657-7663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 23Schulz H. Pellicioli E.C. Thöny-Meyer L. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 1379-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In both bacteria and plant mitochondria, CcmF is predicted to be the final player of cytochrome c maturation. It is believed to be the site where heme and c-type apocytochromes are bound. However, no interaction between CcmF and c-type cytochromes had been established. Moreover, no interaction had been detected between cytochrome c1 and any Ccm protein. Here, we describe the submitochondrial localization of the 3 Arabidopsis CcmF proteins. We find them in a 500-kDa complex and show that they can be in direct interaction. Furthermore, CcmFN1 and CcmFN2 can bind CCMH and CcmFN2 is able to interact with both apocytochrome c and apocytochrome c1. These results together with previous work enable to propose a mechanistic model for the maturation of c-type cytochromes. Phylogenic Analysis—CcmF protein sequences were aligned with the Muscle version 3.52 program (24Edgar R.C. BMC Bioinformatics. 2004; 5: 113Crossref PubMed Scopus (5985) Google Scholar).

Landsberg erecta suspension cultures were maintained in a Gamborg G0210 basal medium containing 1 mg/liter 2.4-Dichlorophenoxy acetic acid and 2% (w/v) sucrose (pH 5.8). Cell cultures of 100 ml were maintained in 250-ml conical flasks in the dark at 22 °C on a rotary shaker at 150 rpm. Every 7 days, 10 ml of the culture was subcultured into 100 ml of fresh media. Five-day-old cultures were used for the preparation of sub-cellular fractions as described previously (18Spielewoy N. Schulz H. Grienenberger J.M. Thony-Meyer L. Bonnard G. J. Biol.

The membrane fraction was subjected to alkaline treatment (0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 11.5, for 30 min at 4 °C) to extract peripheral proteins.

Protein complexes were solubilized with digitonin, 5/1 detergent/protein (w/w) for 30 min on ice, centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and 5% (v/v) Serva blue solution (750 mm ACA750 solution, 5% (w/v) Serva Blue G250) was added to the supernatant. For the first dimension, mitochondrial complexes were separated on 5–13% acrylamide (in 0.5 m amino dicaproic acid, 50 mm bis-Tris, pH 7.0, buffer) gradient gels, with 50 mm bis-Tris (pH 7.0) anode buffer and 50 mm Tricine, 15 mm bis-Tris, 0.02% (v/v) Serva Blue G-250 (pH 7.0) cathode buffer.

PCR products were recombined with linearized pMet-X-Cub-PLV, pX-NubG, and pNubG-X vectors also containing B1 and B2 sites (35Obrdlik P. El-Bakkoury M. Hamacher T. Cappellaro C. Vilarino C.

XCub constructs express a fusion between the protein of interest, the C-terminal domain of ubiquitin, and the chimeric transcription factor PLV consisting of protein A, LexA, and VP16 under control of the methionine repressible pMET25 promoter. XNub and NubX constructs express N-terminal and C-terminal fusions of the protein of interest with the N-terminal domain of ubiquitin (containing a point mutation that abolishes its ability to associate spontaneously with Cub) and the 3HA epitope, under the control of the pADH promoter. XCub constructs were transformed by heat shock in the haploid yeast strain AP4 (MATa), and XNub and NubX constructs in the haploid yeast strain AP5 (MATα) according to standard methods (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Transformation in yeast was controlled by the growth on –Leu and –Trp media (-LW). Protein interaction was monitored by the expression of the reporter genes ADE2, HIS3, and lacZ. The expression of ADE2 and HIS3 was visualized by the growth on –Ade–His media (-AH). The expression of lacZ was followed by measuring at OD420 the accumulation of the product metabolized by β-galactosidase with 2.2 mm 2-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) as substrate. Yeast Two-hybrid Assays—cDNA fragments representing domain 3 (residues 50–80) and domain 5 (residues 240–382) of CcmFN1, domain 2 of CcmFN2 (residues 40–165), and domain 6 of CcmFC (residues 262–409) were cloned in pGBKT7 and pGADT7 vectors (Clontech) to express proteins fused to the DNA-binding domain and the activation domain (AD) of GAL4. Interaction assays were performed as previously described (9Meyer E.H. Giegé P. Gelhaye E. Rayapuram N. Ahuja U. Thony-Meyer L. Grienenberger J.M. Bonnard G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16113-16118Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). ccmF in Mitochondrial Genomes—In plants, ccm genes were inherited from the α proteobacterial ancestor of mitochondria. Presently, some lineages have retained Ccm proteins, their genes are encoded in both mitochondria and the nucleus. Still, ccmF genes are only found in mitochondria. A high number of complete mitochondrial genomes covering the entire diversity of eukaryotic lineages have become available (37Gray M.W. Lang B.F. Burger G. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 477-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). We have searched mitochondrial genomes deposited in GOBASE (rel. 21, 2008) (gobase.bcm.umontreal.ca/) to try to understand the evolutionary history of ccmF genes among eukaryotes. ccmF, similar to all ccm genes has been lost from all holozoa (including animals) and from fungi. In viridiplantae, ccmF genes are absent from all the 10 mitochondrial genomes of chlorophytes available (including Mesostigma). In land plants including the bryophyte Marchantia polymorpha and the moss Physcomitrella patens fully sequenced to date (38Oda K. Kohchi T. Ohyama K. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1992; 56: 132-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 39Terasawa K. Odahara M. Kabeya Y. Kikugawa T. Sekine Y. Fujiwara M. Sato N. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2007; 24: 699-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), ccmF genes are always found. ccmF is also found in a wide array of other lineages: in charophytes, Rhodophytes, alveolates, Discicristata, and jako-bids (17Giegé P. Grienenberger J.M. Bonnard G. Mitochondrion. 2008; 8: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). For all these lineages, ccmF is found in some species but not in all of them. Altogether, the presence of ccmF genes in evolutionary distant lineages, in some mitochondrial genomes, but not in all of them in the respective lineages, suggest that ccmF genes were lost from mitochondrial genomes at several time points during the evolution of eukaryotes. In particular in viridiplantae, the sequence data available suggests that they were lost at least twice: at the separation between streptophytes and chlorophytes and during the evolution of charophytes. The Orthologue of Bacterial ccmF Is Encoded by Multiple Genes in Land Plants—In land plants, beyond the 16 fully sequenced mitochondrial genomes, ccmF genes are also found in all the incomplete genomic sequences available, in mitochondrial genomes of evolutionary distant organisms, such as e.g. Ginkgo or Amborella. Thus it appears to be strictly conserved in land plants. However, in this lineage, contrary to bacteria, ccmF is not encoded by single genes. ccmF has been split in multiple genes, each orthologue to different domains of the bacterial ccmF (Fig. 1B). This separation is differential according to species. In most plants, ccmF is split into 2 genes, e.g. in wheat (4Gonzalez D.H. Bonnard G. Grienenberger J.M. Curr. Genet. 1993; 21: 248-255Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 12Giegé P. Rayapuram N. Meyer E.H. Grienenberger J.M. Bonnard G. FEBS Lett. 2004; 563: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In M. polymorpha, the part encoding the C-terminal end of ccmF is further split in 2 genes (40Oda K. Yamato K. Ohta E. Nakamura Y. Takemura M. Nozato N. Akashi K. Ohyama K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3773-3777Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In Brasicacea such as Arabidopsis the part encoding the N-terminal end of ccmF is encoded by 2 genes (41Handa H. Bonnard G. Grienenberger J.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 292-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 42Menassa R. El-Rouby N. Brown G.G. Curr. Genet. 1997; 31: 70-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, the 3 Arabidopsis ccmF genes are named ccmFN1, ccmFN2, and ccmFC. ccmFN2 that encodes the highly conserved WWD domain does not start by an ATG initiation codon (2Unseld M. Marienfeld J.R. Brandt P. Brennicke A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). The 3 Arabidopsis ccmF sequences have an estimated 1027 codons, as compared with the 647 of ccmF in E. coli. This difference is explained by the presence of large insertions in plant between the regions of high sequence conservation between prokaryotes and eukaryotes (Fig. 1B). The Three Arabidopsis ccmF Genes Are Translated—Gene expression has been documented for ccmF genes for various plant mitochondrial genomes. In wheat, the translation of CcmFN and CcmFC has also been reported (4Gonzalez D.H. Bonnard G. Grienenberger J.M. Curr. Genet. 1993; 21: 248-255Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 12Giegé P. Rayapuram N. Meyer E.H. Grienenberger J.M. Bonnard G. FEBS Lett. 2004; 563: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis, the absence of the ATG initiation codon in ccmFN2 suggested that ccmFN2 could be a pseudo gene. However, transcription and RNA editing had been observed for the 3 Arabidopsis ccmF genes (10Giegé P. Brennicke A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15324-15329Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Still, in plant mitochondria, many sequences and reading frames are transcribed but not translated (44Giegé P. Hoffmann M. Binder S. Brennicke A. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 45Holec S. Lange H. Kuhn K. Alioua M. Borner T. Gagliardi D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2869-2876Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Similarly, RNA editing has been observed for pseudogene transcripts (46Giegé P. Knoop V. Brennicke A. Curr. Genet. 1998; 34: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A recent study where Arabidopsis mitochondrial transcript ends were mapped by circular reverse transcriptase-PCR shows that no ATG codon has been brought in 5′ of ccmFN2 by trans-splicing (47Forner J. Weber B. Thuss S. Wildum S. Binder S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 3676-3692Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), nor RNA editing (10Giegé P. Brennicke A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15324-15329Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Thus we had to test whether the 3 ccmF were indeed translated and that ccmFN2 was not a pseudo gene. Therefore, we raised antibodies against peptides representing the 3 CcmF. The antibodies were used to probe Arabidopsis cell fractions. Single bands were detected in the mitochondrial fractions only, at 42, 30, and 60 kDa for CcmFN1, CcmFN2, and CcmFC antibodies, respectively (supplementary Fig. S1A). These sizes correspond to the calculated sizes of the proteins, 382, 203, and 442 amino acids long, respectively. For the CcmFN2 reading frame, we calculated its predicted size starting from a GUG codon (see below). Thus, it confirms that the 3 CcmF proteins, including CcmFN2, are indeed translated. The quality of cell fractionation was assessed with antibodies directed against cytosolic, chloroplastic, and mitochondrial proteins. The exact position of CcmFN2 translation start, however, remains uncertain. A precise answer would be brought by the direct N-terminal sequencing of CcmFN2 purified from Arabidopsis mitochondria. The antibodies were also used with mitochondrial extracts from other plants. The CcmFN2 antibodies detect bands of 53 and 58 kDa for wheat mitochondria. The 58-kDa protein is only detected in a soluble protein fraction thus suggesting that it is not CcmFN, whereas the band of 53 kDa corresponds to the calculated size of wheat CcmFN and is mostly found in a membrane fraction. For CcmFC, as expected, a band of 60 kDa is detected in both wheat and Arabidopsis mitochondrial extracts. These results confirm at the protein level the differential organization of ccmF genes between wheat and Arabidopsis (supplementary Fig. S1B). Submitochondrial Localization and Topology of CcmF Proteins—The submitochondrial localization, the biochemical properties, and the topologies of the 3 Arabidopsis CcmF proteins were investigated to establish whether they correspond or not to the predicted function of CcmF. Mitochondria were fractionated into soluble and membrane fractions. The antibodies detected signals in the membrane fractions only for CcmFN1, CcmFN2, and CcmFC (Fig. 2A). Membrane proteins were further fractionated into peripheral and intrinsic membrane proteins by alkaline treatment. The 3 CcmF proteins were all found to be intrinsic membrane proteins. In bacteria, the topology of Rhodobacter CcmF was determined by fusing PhoA and LacZ to the predicted soluble domains of CcmF and by measuring the corresponding enzymatic activities (19Goldman B.S. Beck D.L. Monika E.M. Kranz R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5003-5008Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 48Rios-Velazquez C. Coller R. Donohue T.J. J.

Xia J.X. Kikuchi T. Satake M. Shimizu T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W390-W393Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) to build topology models for the 3 Arabidopsis CcmF proteins (Fig. 2B). CcmFN1 could have 3 to 5"

Relatively few studies, however, have examined whether the effects of early experience remain detectable in the aging animal. Here, we examined the effects of neonatal novelty exposure, an early stimulation procedure, on late senescent rats' ability to win in social competition. During the first 3 weeks of life, half of each litter received daily 3-min exposures to a novel environment while the other half stayed in the home cage. At 24 months of age, pairs of rats competed against each other for exclusive access to chocolate rewards. We found that novelty-exposed rats won more rewards than home-staying rats, indicating that early experience exerts a life-long effect on this aspect of social dominance. Furthermore, novelty-exposed but not home-staying rats exhibited habituation of corticosterone release across repeated days of social competition testing, suggesting that early experience permanently enhances plasticity of the stress response system. Finally, we report a surprising finding that across individual rat families, greater effects of neonatal novelty exposure on stress response plasticity were found among families whose dams provided more reliable, instead of a greater total quantity of, maternal care."

Bioactive sphingolipids also function as signaling molecules that regulate cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, and apoptosis. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) exploits a variety of cellular signaling pathways to promote its own replication. However, whether HCMV modulates lipid signaling pathways is an essentially unexplored area of research in virus-host cell interactions. In this study, we examined the accumulation of the bioactive sphingolipids and the enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis and degradation of these lipids. HCMV infection results in increased accumulation and activity of sphingosine kinase (SphK), the enzyme that generates sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and dihydrosphingosine 1-phosphate (dhS1P). We also utilized a mass spectrometry approach to generate a sphingolipidomic profile of HCMV-infected cells. We show that HCMV infection results in increased levels of dhS1P and ceramide at 24 h, suggesting an enhancement of de novo sphingolipid synthesis. Subsequently dihydrosphingosine and dhS1P decrease at 48 h consistent with attenuation of de novo sphingolipid synthesis. Finally, we present evidence that de novo sphingolipid synthesis and sphingosine kinase activity directly impact virus gene expression and virus growth. Together, these findings demonstrate that host cell sphingolipids are dynamically regulated upon infection with a herpes virus in a manner that impacts virus replication.

Many cell signaling pathways are also activated by virus infection. Binding of the HCMV glycoprotein B (gB) to the epidermal growth factor receptor and the αvβ3 integrin coreceptor during virus binding and entry (13Wang X. Huong S.M. Chiu M.L. Raab-Traub N.

Very early interactions of the virus with cellular receptors also results in activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), as well as cyclooxygenase-2, which are implicated in promoting expression of immediate early genes (17Rodems S.M.

Sphingolipids are present in membranes of all eukaryotic cells and, in recent years, have been shown to function as signaling molecules (reviewed in Ref. 23Spiegel S. Milstien S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar). Most work has focused on the bioactive sphingolipids sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and ceramide. Whereas S1P tends to promote cell survival and proliferation, ceramide has opposing effects often leading to cessation of cell proliferation and apoptosis (24Maceyka M. Payne S.G. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). S1P signals both intracellularly and through a family of G protein-coupled receptors termed S1PR1-5 to regulate diverse biological processes (25Spiegel S. Milstien S. Biochem. Soc.

Moreover, S1P impacts several key aspects of immunity including lymphocyte trafficking and chemotaxis, mast cell activity, and the activation and cytokine secretion profiles of T lymphocytes and dendritic cells (reviewed in Refs. 33Payne S.G.

Dihydrosphingosine 1-phosphate (dhS1P), also known as sphinganine 1-phosphate, lacks the trans double bond at the 4-position. dhS1P is an S1P receptor agonist and can therefore elicit many of the same biological processes as S1P (36Tamama K.

S1P is produced from the phosphorylation of sphingosine, which is created by the deacylation of ceramide within the sphingolipid degradatory pathway, by sphingosine kinases (SphK). Two SphK isoforms have been cloned, termed SphK1 and SphK2 (38Kohama T. Olivera A. Edsall L. Nagiec M.M. Dickson R. Spiegel S. J. Biol.

In some cellular contexts SphK2 is anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic (49Maceyka M. Sankala H. Hait N.C. Le Stunff H. Liu H. Toman R. Collier C. Zhang M. Satin L. Merrill Jr., A.H. Milstien S.

Because sphingolipid signaling impacts several fundamental physiological processes, we hypothesized that sphingolipid metabolism is regulated upon infection with viruses. Our results indicate that HCMV infection resulted in the dynamic regulation of both synthetic and degradative enzymes involved in sphingolipid metabolism at the transcriptional level. Additionally, SphK1 transcript abundance, protein levels, and activity were all elevated by HCMV infection. Analysis of the sphingolipid profile of HCMV-infected cells revealed an increase in the amount of dhS1P and ceramides at 24 h, coinciding with the up-regulation SphK1, and consistent with a stimulation of de novo sphingolipid synthesis. Interference with the de novo pathway led to reduced levels of virus replication. Later in infection, there was a decrease in dhS1P at 48 h that does not correlate with an increase in activity of degradative enzymes. Furthermore, small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of SphK1 results in reduced expression of the immediate early gene product, IE1, whereas SphK1 overexpression results in increased accumulation of IE1. Finally, treatment of cells with a drug inhibitor of SphK1 activity causes a delay in virus growth. To our knowledge, this is the first report of regulation of sphingolipid metabolism upon infection by a member of the Herpesviridae family. Cell Culture—U-373 MG glioma cell lines were obtained from ATCC. U-251 MG cells were provided by Dr. Allan Yates. Glioma cell lines were maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, non-essential amino acids, and sodium pyruvate (all media from Mediatech, Herndon, VA). MRC-5 human primary fibroblasts were obtained from ATCC and maintained in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1.7 mm sodium bicarbonate, 1.4 mm sodium chloride, essential and nonessential amino acids, vitamins, and sodium pyruvate at manufacturer-recommended concentrations (Sigma). Human foreskin-derived fibroblasts (HFF cells) were obtained from ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Telomerase-immortalized human foreskin fibroblasts, HFF-TEL, were the kind gift of Tom Shenk and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were isolated from vessels as previously described (51Sedmak D.D. Roberts W.H. Stephens R.E. Buesching W.J. Morgan L.A. Davis D.H. Waldman W.J. Transplantation. 1990; 49: 458-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and propagated in endothelial cell growth medium consisting of M-199 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 22.5 μg/ml bovine brain extract (BioWhitakker, Inc., Walkersville MD), 12 units/ml sodium heparin (Sigma), and 20 mm HEPES buffer. All growth surfaces for endothelial cells were pretreated with human fibronectin (25 μg/ml, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). Cells were passed weekly by brief trypsin digestion at a ratio of 1:4, and used in experiments at passage 5-7. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in 95% air, 5% CO2. Viruses—HCMV strain AD169 was purchased from ATCC and were propagated in MRC-5 cells. Virus titers were determined in MRC-5 cells by standard plaque assay (52Wentworth B.B. French L. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1970; 135: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). CMV strain VHL/E, originally isolated from duodenal biopsy material from a bone marrow transplant recipient (53Waldman W.J. Roberts W.H. Davis D.H. Williams M.V. Sedmak D.D. Stephens R.E. Arch. Virol. 1991; 117: 143-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), was propagated in human umbilical vein endothelial cells as detailed elsewhere (54Waldman W.J. Adams P.W. Orosz C.G. Sedmak D.D. Transplantation. 1992; 54: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) to preserve its natural endothelial cytopathogenicity. For UV inactivation of virus, virus stocks were subjected to 100 μ/J/cm2 UV irradiation in a Hoefer UVC 500 UV cross-linker for 5 min. The efficacy of UV treatment and optimal exposure time was measured by exposing virus to UV for increasing intervals of times. MRC-5 cells were then exposed to virus subjected to various irradiation times, and IE1 protein accumulation was measured in cell lysates harvested 16 h after infection by SDS-PAGE (see below) and immunoblot analysis (data not shown). Antibodies and Drug Inhibitors—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to SphK1 were made to a peptide (RNHARELVRSEELGRWD) near the N terminus representing residues 57-73 and affinity purified from serum by Quality Controlled Biochemicals (Hopkinton, MA). Antibody to serine palmitoyltransferase 1 (SPT) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse monoclonal antibody to the HCMV IE1 proteins were purchased from the Rumbaugh-Goodwin Institute. Antibodies to the HCMV pp150, UL44, and UL69 proteins were the gift of Bill Britt. Anti-glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was purchased from Chemicon. The SphK inhibitor, 2-(p-hydroxyanilino)-4-(p-chlorophenyl)thiazole HCl, (Calbiochem) was used at 1 μg/ml. HFF cells were exposed to SphK inhibitor or vehicle only (dimethyl sulfoxide) immediately after the virus inoculation period (0.5 pfu/cell). Combined cells and supernatant were assayed for virus by standard titration on MRC-5 cells at the times indicated under “Results.” Sphingosine Kinase Assay—Sphingosine kinase activity was measured by phosphorylation of sphingosine with [γ-32P]ATP and thin layer chromatography as described (48Van Brocklyn J.R. Jackson C.A. Pearl D.K. Kotur M.S. Snyder P.J. Prior T.W. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2005; 64: 695-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). S1P Degrading Enzyme Assay—S1P degrading activity due to SGPPs and SGPL was measured in lysates from mock- and HCMV-infected cells as described (55Maceyka M. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 434: 243-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, cells were lysed by sonication in Buffer A (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin) and lysates were centrifuged to remove unbroken cells. Equal amounts of protein from lysates were incubated with 10 μm [32P]S1P (100,000 cpm/sample) for 1 h at 37 °C. Lipids were extracted and resolved by TLC as for the SphK assay. Radioactive spots were scraped from TLC plates and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Activity was calculated as nanomole of S1P degraded per min/mg of protein in comparison to blank samples, without cell lysates, run in parallel. RNA Interference—Predesigned siRNA oligonucleotides to serine palmitoyltransferase 1 (SPT1), siRNA (ID code 11681), SPHK1 (ID code 1181), and random control siRNA (Silencer Negative control siRNA number 2, catalog number 4613) were purchased from Ambion. The negative control siRNA has no significant homology to known human, mouse, or rat genes. The sequence of the pre-designed siRNAs are as follows: SPHK1, sense 5′-GGCUGAAAUCUCCUUCACGtt-3′, antisense 5′-CGUGAAGGAGAUUUCAGCCtc-3′; SPT1, sense 5′-GCCACAAAACUGUGGUGAAtt-3′, antisense 5′-UUCACCACAGUUUUGUGGCtt-3′. The siRNA oligonucleotides were transfected into cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 4 h medium was changed to normal growth medium and cells were incubated for the times indicated under “Results.” SphK1 Expression Constructs and Nucleofection—The open reading frame of human SPHK1 was amplified from HEK293 cell RNA by reverse transcriptase-PCR using the following primers: 5′-GAGGAATTCTGGATCCAGCGGGCGGCCCC-3′; and 5′-GAGCTCGAGTCATAAGGGCTCTTCTGGCGGTGG-3′, containing EcoRI and XhoI linkers. The resulting PCR product was cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) in-frame with an N-terminal c-myc tag. The dominant negative G82D SPHK1 was generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions to change codon 82 from GGG to GAC. Mutagenic primers were as follows: 5′-GGTCATGTCTGGAGACGACCTGATGCACGAGG-3′ and 5′-CCTCGTGCATCAGGTCGTCTCCAGACATGACC-3′. Identity of clones was verified by sequencing MRC-5. For nucleofections, 1.5 × 106 MRC-5 cells were resuspended in 100 μl of basic nucleofector solution for primary fibroblasts with 3 μg of plasmid DNA and cells were nucleofected using the U23 program in the nucleofector device (Amaxa Biosystems). Preparation of Cell Lysates and Immunoblotting—Cells grown in 6-well plates were solubilized at the times indicated under “Results” after exposure to the AD169 strain of virus with or without treatment with interfering RNAs. Cells were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). After sonication, lysates were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min, and insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation. Equivalent amounts of protein from each lysate were separated by electrophoresis in SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose sheets (Amersham Biosciences). Sheets were reacted with primary antibodies indicated under “Results,” and subsequently to horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz). Bound antibodies were visualized using a chemiluminescent detection system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) and exposure to film. For SphK overexpression, cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, with a construct containing the human SPHK1 open reading frame cloned in-frame with a N-terminal c-MYC epitope tag as described above. Real Time Quantitative PCR—Real time PCR analysis was performed as previously described (48Van Brocklyn J.R. Jackson C.A. Pearl D.K. Kotur M.S. Snyder P.J. Prior T.W. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2005; 64: 695-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was extracted from cultured cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions, followed by treatment with DNaseI (Ambion, Austin, TX) for 20 min at 37 °C. cDNA was created using the Superscript II First Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. PCR were setup using TaqMan® Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Real time PCR analysis was performed using Applied Biosystems ABI PRISM® 7700 Sequence Detection System for 40 cycles. Data were obtained using Sequence Detection System 1.7a software and exported to Microsoft Excel worksheets for analysis. SPHK1, SPHK2, S1P phosphohydrolase 1 and 2 (SGPP1 and SGPP2), and S1P lyase (SGPL1) expression levels were normalized to mock-infected HFF SPHK1 expression at 12 h. S1P receptor (S1PR1-3) expression levels were normalized to mock-infected HFF S1PR1 expression. Expression was determined relative to 18S rRNA as an internal control using the ΔΔCt method as described (48Van Brocklyn J.R. Jackson C.A. Pearl D.K. Kotur M.S. Snyder P.J. Prior T.W. J. Neuropathol.

Primer sequences of Applied Biosystems Assays-on-Demand™ gene expression assays are proprietary, however, RefSeq accession numbers for genes, location of binding sites for fluorescent probes, and amplicons, ∼50-150 base pairs surrounding the probe location, are provided as follows: S1PR1 (catalog number HS00173499 m1) based on RefSeq NM 001400. Probe was located at base 83 in the exon 1/exon 2 boundary. S1PR2 (catalog number HS00244677 s1) based on RefSeq NM005226, probe location was 968. S1PR3 (catalog number Hs00245464 s1) based on RefSeq NM004230, probe location was 623; SPHK1 (catalog number Hs00184211 m1) based on RefSeq NM021972, probe location was exon 5/6 boundary, base 802; SPHK2 (catalog number Hs00219999 m1) based on RefSeq NM020126, probe location was the exon 3/4 boundary, base 875; SGPP1 (catalog number Hs00229266_m1) based on RefSeq NM030791, probe location at was the exon 1/2 boundary, base 782; SGPP2 (catalog number Hs00544786_m1) based on RefSeq NM152386, probe location was the exon 4/5 boundary, base 649; SGPL1 (catalog number Hs00187407_m1) based on RefSeq NM003901, probe location was the exon 8/9 boundary, base 915. Sphingolipid Quantitation—Quantitation of sphingolipids in mock- and CMV-infected cells was performed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC MS/MS) as previously described (57Merrill Jr., A.H. Sullards M.C. Allegood J.C. Kelly S. Wang E. Methods (Amst.). 2005; 36: 207-224Google Scholar) using the internal standard mixture from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). SphK Activity Is Elevated in HCMV-infected Cells—We first sought to investigate the effect of HCMV infection on SphK activity. U-373 MG glioma cells were exposed to 5 pfu/cell of the AD169 strain of HCMV and harvested 24, 48, and 72 h after infection. Cells were solubilized and cell lysates were then assayed for SphK activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in the top panel of Fig. 1A, higher levels of S1P were generated in in vitro kinase reactions from infected cell lysates relative to uninfected cell lysates. Quantitation of the S1P spots detected by thin layer chromatography was translated into SphK activity (middle panel, Fig. 1A) allowing us to compare the increase in activity in infected cells relative to uninfected cells (bottom panel, Fig. 1A). Higher levels of SphK activity were observed i"

https://openalex.org/W2097769598,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are zinc-dependent enzymes that play a role in the inflammatory response. These enzymes have been well studied in the context of cancer biology and inflammation. Recent studies, however, suggest that these enzymes also play roles in brain development and neurodegenerative disease. Select MMPs can target proteins critical to synaptic structure and neuronal survival, including integrins and cadherins. Here, we show that one member of the MMP family, MMP-7, which may be released from cells, including microglia, can target a protein critical to synaptic function. Through analysis of extracts from murine cortical slice preparations, we show that MMP-7 cleaves the NR1 subunit of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor to generate an N-terminal fragment of approximately 65 kDa. Moreover, studies with recombinant protein show that MMP-7-mediated cleavage of NR1 occurs at amino acid 517, which is extracellular and just distal to the first transmembrane domain. Data suggest that NR2A, which shares sequence homology with NR1, is also cleaved following treatment of slices with MMP-7, while select AMPA receptor subunits are not. Consistent with a potential effect of MMP-7 on ligand binding, additional experiments demonstrate that NMDA-mediated calcium flux is significantly diminished by MMP-7 pretreatment of cultures. In addition, the AMPA/NMDA ratio is increased by MMP-7 pretreatment. These data suggest that synaptic function may be altered in neurological conditions associated with increased levels of MMP-7."
https://openalex.org/W2054622827,The Working Group on Peer Review of the Advisory Committee to the Director of NIH has recommended that at least 4 reviewers should be used to assess each grant application. A sample size analysis of the number of reviewers needed to evaluate grant applications reveals that a substantially larger number of evaluators are required to provide the level of precision that is currently mandated. NIH should adjust their peer review system to account for the number of reviewers needed to provide adequate precision in their evaluations.
https://openalex.org/W1965668251,"In this report, we describe a novel method for culturing murine trachea epithelial cells on a native basement membrane at an air-liquid interface to produce a pseudostratified, differentiated airway epithelium composed of ciliated and nonciliated cells. This model was used to examine hyaluronan synthesis by the airway epithelial cells (AECs) in response to poly(I,C) and tunicamycin. The former induces a response similar to viral infection, and the latter is a bacterial toxin known to induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. We found significant accumulation of hyaluronan on the apical surface of the AECs in response to ER stress, but, unlike previously reported results with smooth muscle cells, no increase in hyaluronan was observed in response to poly(I,C). Monocytic U937 cells adhered at 4 degrees C to the apical surface of the AECs subjected to ER stress by a mechanism almost entirely mediated by hyaluronan. The U937 cells spontaneously released themselves from the abnormal hyaluronan matrix when their metabolism was restored by shifting the temperature from 4 to 37 degrees C in a custom-made flow chamber. Time lapse confocal microscopy permitted live imaging of this interaction between the U937 cells and the hyaluronan matrix and their subsequent response at 37 degrees C. Within 45 min, we observed dynamic protrusions of the U937 cell plasma membrane into nearby hyaluronan matrix, resulting in the degradation of this matrix. Simultaneously, we observed some reorganization of the hyaluronan matrix, from a generalized, apical distribution to localized regions around the AEC tight junctions. We discuss the implications these results might have for the airway epithelium and its relation to airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness associated with asthma and other airway diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2084311640,"Human ABCG2 is a plasma membrane glycoprotein working as a homodimer or homo-oligomer. The protein plays an important role in the protection/detoxification of various tissues and may also be responsible for the multidrug-resistant phenotype of cancer cells. In our previous study we found that the 5D3 monoclonal antibody shows a function-dependent reactivity to an extracellular epitope of the ABCG2 transporter. In the current experiments we have further characterized the 5D3-ABCG2 interaction. The effect of chemical cross-linking and the modulation of extracellular S-S bridges on the transporter function and 5D3 reactivity of ABCG2 were investigated in depth. We found that several protein cross-linkers greatly increased 5D3 labeling in ABCG2 expressing HEK cells; however, there was no correlation between covalent dimer formation, the inhibition of transport activity, and the increase in 5D3 binding. Dithiothreitol treatment, which reduced the extracellular S-S bridge-forming cysteines of ABCG2, had no effect on transport function but caused a significant decrease in 5D3 binding. When analyzing ABCG2 mutants carrying Cys-to-Ala changes in the extracellular loop, we found that the mutant C603A (lacking the intermolecular S-S bond) showed comparable transport activity and 5D3 reactivity to the wild-type ABCG2. However, disruption of the intramolecular S-S bridge (in C592A, C608A, or C592A/C608A mutants) in this loop abolished 5D3 binding, whereas the function of the protein was preserved. Based on these results and ab initio folding simulations, we propose a model for the large extracellular loop of the ABCG2 protein."
https://openalex.org/W2022666276,"The compartmentalization of somites along their anterior-posterior axis is crucial to the segmental organization of the vertebral column. Anterior-posterior somite polarity is generated in the anterior presomitic mesoderm by Mesp2 and Delta/Notch signaling and is further maintained by two transcriptional regulators, Uncx4.1 and Tbx18, acting in the posterior and anterior somite compartment, respectively. Here, we report that the paired box transcription factor Pax3 cooperates with the T-box protein Tbx18 in maintaining anterior somite half identity. Our findings that both genes are co-expressed in the anterior presomitic mesoderm and in early somites, that Pax3 and Tbx18 proteins physically interact, and that the loss of Pax3 gene function enhances the vertebral defects (i.e. the gain of vertebral elements derived from posterior somite halves in Tbx18 mutant mice) suggests that the two proteins cooperatively regulate the gene expression program necessary for maintaining anterior-posterior somite polarity. Genetic interaction of Pax3 with Tbx18 and the closely related T-box gene Tbx15 was also observed in the development of the scapula blade, indicating an additional cooperative function for these genes in the paraxial mesoderm.

Genetic interaction of Pax3 with Tbx18 and the closely related T-box gene Tbx15 was also observed in the development of the scapula blade, indicating an additional cooperative function for these genes in the paraxial mesoderm. The metameric organization of the vertebral column derives from the somites, segmentally repeated units in the paraxial mesoderm. Somites form in a highly periodic and synchronized fashion by condensation and subsequent epithelialization of groups of mesenchymal cells at the anterior end of the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) 3The abbreviations used are: PSMpresomitic mesodermaaamino acidsAPanterior-posteriorEnembryonic day nNLSnuclear localization sequenceGSTglutathione S-transferaseHAhemagglutinin. on both sides of the neural tube. Under the influence of signals from surrounding tissues, somites start to differentiate along their dorso-ventral axis. The ventral part undergoes an epithelial-mesenchymal transition to form the sclerotome, which contains precursors of the vertebral column and parts of the ribs. The dorsal part remains epithelial and generates the dermomyotome, from which skeletal muscles and the dermis of the skin will develop. In addition to differentiation along the dorso-ventral axis, somites become subdivided into distinct anterior and posterior compartments. Anterior-posterior (AP) polarization of somites underlies the segmental arrangement of the peripheral nervous system, since trajectories of neural crest and spinal nerves are confined to anterior somite halves. On the level of the sclerotome, the differential contribution of either compartment to the forming vertebra affects the structure of the axial skeleton. Vertebral bodies, laminae with the spinal processes, the rib heads, and the distal ribs derive from both somite halves, whereas pedicles with their transverse processes and proximal ribs derive from posterior somite halves only (1Goldstein R.S.

Establishment of somitic AP polarity is closely coupled to the segmentation process. Work from a variety of vertebrate model systems has shown that somite formation is governed by an oscillator known as the segmentation clock that operates in the PSM (4Aulehla A. Herrmann B.G. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2060-2067Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 5Saga Y. Dev. Dyn. 2007; 236: 1450-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It is now believed that synchronized oscillations of a number of signaling pathways, including Wnt, fibroblast growth factor, and Notch signaling, are involved in the mechanism of the segmentation clock. Gradients of secreted signaling molecules cooperatively define the segmentation border within the anterior PSM. In this region, Notch oscillation is stabilized to a narrow domain, in which cells with a high Notch pathway activity will constitute the posterior half of a newly forming somite. In an adjacent stripe of cells, Notch signaling is suppressed by the action of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Mesp2. The expression domain of Mesp2 thereby defines the anterior somite half, and its anterior limit demarcates the next segmental border to be formed (6Morimoto M. Takahashi Y. Endo M. Saga Y. Nature. 2005; 435: 354-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Correspondingly, loss of Mesp2 activity leads to posteriorization of somites, whereas loss of Delta-like1 (Dll1) gene function and Notch signaling results in somites that bear only features of anterior halves (7Barrantes I.B. Elia A.J. Wunsch K. Hrabe de Angelis M.H. Mak T.W. Rossant J. Conlon R.A. Gossler A. de la Pompa J.L. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 470-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Molecular players required for the further maintenance of somitic AP polarity have recently surfaced. Genetic evidence from both loss- and gain-of-function studies in the mouse suggest that this process is controlled by the combined action of a pair of transcription factors, the T-box (Tbx) protein Tbx18 and the paired type homeobox protein Uncx4.1, which are expressed in anterior and posterior somite halves, respectively (8Kraus F. Haenig B. Kispert A. Mech. Dev. 2001; 100: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 9Neidhardt L.M. Kispert A. Herrmann B.G. Dev. Genes Evol. 1997; 207: 330-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Uncx4.1 is specifically required for the development of pedicles and proximal ribs (10Leitges M. Neidhardt L. Haenig B. Herrmann B.G. Kispert A. Development. 2000; 127: 2259-2267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Mansouri A. Voss A.K. Thomas T. Yokota Y. Gruss P. Development. 2000; 127: 2251-2258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), elements exclusively derived from the posterior lateral sclerotome. In contrast, loss of Tbx18 function results in expansion of pedicles and proximal ribs in the cervical and thoracic region of the axial skeleton (12Bussen M. Petry M. Schuster-Gossler K. Leitges M. Gossler A. Kispert A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1209-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Notably, the forced misexpression of Tbx18 in posterior somite halves results in reduction of pedicles and proximal ribs (12Bussen M. Petry M. Schuster-Gossler K. Leitges M. Gossler A. Kispert A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1209-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), suggesting that Tbx18 is sufficient to specify anterior versus posterior somite fates. Opposing phenotypic consequences of loss of either factor are based on molecular cross-regulation. In Uncx4.1 mutants, Tbx18 expression is derepressed in posterior somite halves, whereas in Tbx18 mutants, expression of Uncx4.1 progressively expands in anterior somite halves (12Bussen M. Petry M. Schuster-Gossler K. Leitges M. Gossler A. Kispert A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1209-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). On the molecular level, Uncx4.1 may therefore act as transcriptional repressor of Tbx18, whereas Tbx18 may regulate Uncx4.1 indirectly by controlling expression of the Notch ligand Dll1 (13Farin H.F. Bussen M. Schmidt M.K. Singh M.K. Schuster-Gossler K. Kispert A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25748-25759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To get further insight into the molecular function of Tbx18, thus into the control of AP-somite compartmentalization, we sought to identify and characterize protein binding partners of Tbx18. This may also help to define transcriptional targets of Tbx18 and their molecular regulation. Here, we report on the identification of the paired box (Pax) transcription factor Pax3 as a protein binding partner of Tbx18. We characterize this interaction on the biochemical level and define genetically that both transcription factors synergize in the development of the paraxial mesoderm, including anterior-posterior somite compartmentalization and scapula development. Expression Constructs—Bacterial expression constructs were generated as N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fusions in pGEX-4T3 (GE Healthcare). Generation of GST-Tbx18 fusion proteins has been described (13Farin H.F. Bussen M. Schmidt M.K. Singh M.K. Schuster-Gossler K. Kispert A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25748-25759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and constructs covering the T-box region of mouse Tbx15 (aa 110–313), human TBX22 (aa 96–291), and mouse Brachyury (aa 41–225) were PCR-amplified from the cDNAs NM_009323, NM_016954, and NM_009309, respectively. For in vitro expression of proteins, cDNA fragments were cloned with C-terminal Myc or HA tags in the vector pSP64 (Promega) that was modified to contain a 5′-β-globin leader anda3′-β-globin trailer. Fragments encoding Pax3 partial (Fig. 1D) and full-length (aa 1–479) proteins were amplified from the mouse cDNA NM_008781. Expression plasmids of full-length Pax1 (aa 1–361), Pax7 (aa 1–503), and Pax9 (aa 1–342) were amplified from mouse cDNAs NM_008780, NM_011039, and NM_011041, respectively. For cytomegalovirus promoter/enhancer-driven expression in cells, the globin leader/cDNA/globin trailer cassette was shuttled into EcoRI and HindIII sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The expression vector for Tbx18ΔNLS has been described (13Farin H.F. Bussen M. Schmidt M.K. Singh M.K. Schuster-Gossler K. Kispert A. J. Biol.

All plasmids were sequenced; details on cloning strategies and primer sequences are available upon request. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—The construct for the generation of a fusion protein between the DNA binding domain of GAL4 and Tbx18 (aa 1–345) was cloned into pGBKT7 (Clontech). This bait vector was transformed into the yeast strain AH109 (Clontech), that was subsequently mated to the yeast strain Y187 that was pretransformed with a prey library of poly(T)-primed mouse embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) whole embryo cDNAs (Clontech) following the manufacturer's instructions. Clones were selected on plates lacking leucine, tryptophan, histidine, and alanine. After this selection step, prey plasmids were isolated, amplified in Escherichia coli, and sequenced. GST Pull-down, Immunofluorescence, and Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—These assays were performed as described (13Farin H.F. Bussen M. Schmidt M.K. Singh M.K. Schuster-Gossler K. Kispert A. J. Biol.

Gruss P. Development. 2001; 128: 1995-2000Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Tbx18 (Tbx18tm2Akis (12Bussen M. Petry M. Schuster-Gossler K. Leitges M. Gossler A. Kispert A.

Dev. 2005; 122: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) (synonym: Tbx15lacZ) were maintained on an outbred (NMRI) background. For the generation of compound mutants, double heterozygous mice were intercrossed. Genomic DNA prepared from yolk sacs or tail biopsies was used for genotyping by PCR (details on PCR strategies are available upon request). For timed pregnancies, vaginal plugs were checked in the morning after mating, and noon was taken as E0.5. Skeletal Preparations—Skeletal preparations of E14.5 embryos and newborns were prepared essentially as previously described (12Bussen M. Petry M. Schuster-Gossler K. Leitges M. Gossler A. Kispert A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1209-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Embryos were fixed in 95% ethanol overnight, and cartilaginous elements were then stained for 2 days in Alcian blue solution (150 mg/liter Alcian blue 8GX in 80% ethanol, 20% acetic acid). Embryos were transferred in methanol and cleared in benzylbenzoate/benzylalcohol (2:1). In Situ Hybridization Analysis—Whole mount in situ hybridization analysis was performed with digoxigenin-labeled antisense riboprobes following a standard procedure (16Wilkinson D.G. Nieto M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Stained specimens were transferred into 80% glycerol prior to documentation on a Leica M420 microscope with a Fujix digital camera HC-300Z. Images were processed in Adobe Photoshop CS. Details about probes are available upon request. T-box and Pax Proteins Interact in Vitro—In order to identify protein interaction partners of Tbx18, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen. We initially tested a number of fusion constructs of the GAL4-DNA-binding domain with subregions of Tbx18 protein for their quality as bait. A construct encoding a fusion protein with the N terminus and the T-domain of Tbx18, which was expressed and lacked autoactivation in yeast, was transformed into yeast, and the resulting bait strain was mated to a strain pretransformed with a mouse cDNA library from E11.5 whole embryos. One of the clones identified by the yeast two-hybrid screen harbored a partial cDNA for Pax3, a member of the gene family encoding paired box transcription factors (data not shown). To validate and further investigate the interaction between Tbx18 and Pax3, we performed a series of in vitro binding assays using bacterially expressed subregions of Tbx18 fused to GST and in vitro expressed HA-tagged Pax3 protein (Fig. 1, A and B). In GST pull-down assays, Pax3 was specifically bound to GST-Tbx18 fusion proteins harboring the N-terminal domain and the T-box region (GST-Tbx18(N+T)) and the T-box region alone (GST-Tbx18(T)), respectively. Binding was observed neither with GST nor with GST-Tbx18(N) or GST-Tbx18(C), indicating that the T-domain of Tbx18 mediated the binding to Pax3 (Fig. 1C). We next generated a series of deletion mutants of the Pax3 cDNA for expression in vitro as HA-tagged peptides to determine which region of Pax3 confers interaction with Tbx18 (Fig. 1, D and E). Pax proteins are characterized by the presence of a conserved N-terminal DNA-binding region, the paired domain. Some of the eight murine family members, including Pax3, additionally contain a homeodomain as a second DNA-binding region. Pax3 peptides containing the paired domain were efficiently bound to GST-Tbx18(N+T), whereas peptides containing the homeodomain only and/or the C terminus of Pax3 were not efficiently retained (Fig. 1E). In summary, our in vitro binding assays showed that binding of Tbx18 and Pax3 is mediated by the two conserved DNA binding regions, the T-domain and the paired domain. The interaction between Tbx18 and Pax3 was additionally validated in a mammalian cell system using a nuclear recruitment assay. Transfection of an expression construct for HA-tagged Pax3 revealed constitutive nuclear localization of Pax3. In contrast, Myc-tagged Tbx18 protein lacking the nuclear localization signal (Tbx18ΔNLS) (13Farin H.F. Bussen M. Schmidt M.K. Singh M.K. Schuster-Gossler K. Kispert A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25748-25759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) was excluded from the nucleus and localized to the cytoplasm. Upon co-transfection of constructs encoding HA-tagged Pax3 protein and Myc-tagged Tbx18ΔNLS protein, nuclear localization of Tbx18 was regained (Fig. 1F), suggesting that Tbx18ΔNLS in complex with Pax3 is shuttled to the nuclear environment. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed in HEK293 cells transfected with full-length constructs for Myc-tagged Tbx18 alone or in the presence of HA-tagged Pax3. In immunoprecipitates obtained with the HA antibody, an enrichment of Myc-tagged Tbx18 protein was detected only upon co-transfection of the Pax3 expression construct (Fig. 1G, left). Conversely, Pax3.HA protein was specifically coimmunoprecipitated with the anti-Myc antibody when Tbx18.Myc protein was present (Fig. 1G, right), providing further proof for complex formation of Tbx18 and Pax3 in a cellular system. T-box and Paired Box Interaction Is Promiscuous—We next investigated whether binding of Tbx18 to Pax3 is unique among T-box and Pax proteins or whether Tbx18 and Pax3 interact with additional members of the other family as well. In a GST pull-down assay, we found that, similar to Pax3, the closely related Pax7 and the more divergent proteins Pax1 and Pax9 exhibited binding to the T-domain of Tbx18 (Fig. 2A). This interaction was confirmed in the nuclear recruitment assay, where Tbx18ΔNLS was shuttled to the nucleus upon co-expression of HA-tagged Pax1 and Pax9 but not with unrelated nuclear proteins (data not shown). Conversely, we analyzed if Pax3 is able to bind to other members of the T-box protein family. Therefore, GST fusions of the T-box region of the closely related Tbx15, Tbx18, and Tbx22 proteins and the distant family member Brachyury (Fig. 2B) were expressed in bacteria, purified (Fig. 2C), and incubated with in vitro expressed Pax3 protein. Binding of Pax3 protein was detected to all T-box proteins analyzed; however, binding of Pax3 to Tbx18 was the strongest (Fig. 2D). Together, these findings suggest promiscuity of binding between T-box and paired box regions, but binding affinities between individual family members might differ substantially. Comparative Expression Analysis of Tbx15, Tbx18, Tbx22, and Pax3—The facts that we only detected Pax3 but not other Pax family member in our yeast two-hybrid screen and the high affinity binding of Tbx18 with Pax3 in the in vitro assays prompted us to analyze whether this interaction is functionally relevant in vivo. To determine in which tissues such a molecular interaction may occur, we compared the expression patterns of Pax3 and Tbx18 and the two closely related Tbx15 and Tbx22 genes using in situ hybridization analysis of E9.5 wild-type mouse embryos (Fig. 3). At this stage, Tbx15 expression was confined to the mesenchyme of the forelimb buds (Fig. 3A, arrow). Tbx18 was co-expressed with Tbx15 in this tissue (Fig. 3B, arrow) but showed additional expression domains in the sinus venosus, the proepicardial organ (Fig. 3B, white arrowhead), and the head mesenchyme (Fig. 3B, black arrowhead). In derivatives of the paraxial mesenchyme, Tbx18 expression was observed in the anterior halves of epithelial somites and additionally in two stripes representing the anterior halves of somites that were about to form (S0 and S-1) (Fig. 3E). With differentiation of somites, Tbx18 expression in anterior somite halves became restricted to the lateral sclerotome (Fig. 3E, arrow). Tbx15 expression was absent during somite development (Fig. 3A). However, the closely related Tbx22 gene was co-expressed with Tbx18 in anterior halves of somitomeres and early somites (S-1 to S1) (Fig. 3, C and F). Expression of Tbx22 in anterior somite halves was then rapidly down-regulated, but expression was reinitiated in forming myotomes (Fig. 3F, arrow). Pax3 was strongly expressed in the dorsal neural tube (Fig. 3D, arrow). Furthermore, Pax3 expression was found in the anterior PSM and in epithelial somites (Fig. 3, D and G). Expression was maintained in the dermomyotomal compartment (Fig. 3G, arrow) and in migrating precursors of the limb musculature (Fig. 3D, arrowhead) (17Schubert F.R. Tremblay P. Mansouri A. Faisst A.M. Kammandel B. Lumsden A. Gruss P. Dietrich S. Dev. Dyn. 2001; 222: 506-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Hence, Tbx18, Tbx22, and Pax3 are co-expressed in the PSM and undifferentiated somites, but expression domains segregate during the differentiation of the sclerotome, myotome, and dermomyotome. Tbx18 and Pax3 Cooperate in the Development of the Axial Skeleton—The observed physical interaction and the co-expression of Tbx18 (and Tbx22) with Pax3 during somitogenesis suggested that these factors also interact genetically during this process. We analyzed this possibility by generating embryos compound mutant for null alleles of Tbx18 (Tbx18GFP) and Pax3 (Pax3lacZ). On the outbred background on which we maintained these alleles, Pax3-/- embryos were viable at E14.5. This is in contrast to studies where lethality of Pax3-/- embryos was observed between E13.5 and E14.5 when the mutant allele was kept on an inbred background, such as a mix of C3H/101 and BA/Ca or C57Bl6 (17Schubert F.R. Tremblay P. Mansouri A. Faisst A.M. Kammandel B. Lumsden A. Gruss P. Dietrich S. Dev. Dyn. 2001; 222: 506-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Henderson D.J. Conway S.J. Copp A.J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 209: 143-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Tbx18-/- embryos died shortly after birth as reported before (12Bussen M. Petry M. Schuster-Gossler K. Leitges M. Gossler A. Kispert A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1209-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Mice double heterozygous for Tbx18GFP and Pax3lacZ mutant alleles were viable and fertile and were intercrossed to obtain all possible allelic combinations. We harvested embryos at E14.5 and analyzed the skeletons as a read-out of defects of somite patterning and differentiation. We noted that embryos double homozygous for Pax3 and Tbx18 null alleles were severely underrepresented at this stage. Of a total of 123 embryos harvested, we only obtained two double mutants (1.6%) instead of the expected eight (1 of 16; 6.3%). Similarly, the observed number of nine Tbx18-/-,Pax3+/- embryos (7.3%) displayed a reduction from the expected value (15 embryos; 1 of 8; 12.5%), suggesting that the removal of one or two copies of one wild-type allele in the mutant background of the other gene dramatically enhanced the severity of the embryonic defects. All other genotypes were found in the expected Mendelian frequencies (data not shown). In wild-type embryos of E14.5, the cartilagenous preskeleton was invested with a segmental array of orderly spaced ribs and vertebra (Fig. 4A). At the thoracic level, ribs were connected to vertebral pedicles (Fig. 4G, black arrowhead). Strikingly, in 12 of 30 embryos (40%) double heterozygous for both Tbx18 and Pax3 null alleles, we detected isolated expansions of proximal ribs (Fig. 4, B and H, white arrowhead), whereas these malformations were never observed in single heterozygous embryos. In Tbx18-/- embryos, pedicles and proximal ribs were expanded and formed contiguous cartilagenous bands in the vertebral column at the cervical and thoracic levels and the rib cage, respectively (Fig. 4, C (brackets) and I (arrowheads)) (12Bussen M. Petry M. Schuster-Gossler K. Leitges M. Gossler A. Kispert A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1209-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In all Tbx18-/-,Pax3+/- embryos analyzed (n = 9), expansions of proximal ribs were increased in frequency and extended more caudally (Fig. 4D, brackets) and medially (Fig. 4J, white arrowheads) compared with Tbx18-/- embryos. A further expansion of pedicles was not observed (Fig. 4J, black arrowhead). In mutants double homozygous for Tbx18 and Pax3 null alleles, the body axis was dramatically shortened (n = 2; Fig. 4E). The severity of the skeletal defects in cervical vertebrae was unchanged compared with Tbx18 mutant embryos. In contrast, the lateral parts of the vertebrae, neural arches and pedicles, were largely expanded at the thoracic and lumbar level (Fig. 4E, black arrowhead) and frequently misconnected to the vertebral bodies that were often split (Fig. 4E, asterisks and white arrow, respectively). Proximal parts of ribs constituted large contiguous plates of cartilage on both sides of the vertebral column (Fig. 4K, white arrowheads). In Pax3-/- embryos, defects of the axial skeleton, including fusions of neural arches of adjacent vertebrae, occurred mainly in the lumbosacral region (Fig. 4F, arrowhead), and rib fusions and bifurcations were apparent (Fig. 4F, arrow). However, skeletal defects were generally less severe than the ones described for Pax3 alleles maintained on inbred genetic backgrounds (17Schubert F.R. Tremblay P. Mansouri A. Faisst A.M. Kammandel B. Lumsden A. Gruss P. Dietrich S. Dev. Dyn. 2001; 222: 506-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Henderson D.J. Conway S.J. Copp A.J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 209: 143-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Notably, and in contrast to Tbx18 mutants, the proximal ribs were unaffected, and the pedicles were spaced regularly (Fig. 4L). Together, our results demonstrate genetic interaction of Pax3 and Tbx18 in the formation of the axial skeleton. Removal of Pax3 function enhances the phenotypic changes associated with the loss of Tbx18, namely the expansion of derivatives of the posterior lateral sclerotome, pedicles, and proximal ribs. Tbx18 and Pax3 Cooperate in the Maintenance of Anterior Somite Halves—Co-expression of Tbx18 and Pax3 in undifferentiated somites suggests that not only the lateral sclerotome but also other somitic compartments could be affected by the combined loss of Pax3 and Tbx18 functions. To determine patterning and differentiation of the somitic mesoderm into myotome and sclerotome more carefully, we analyzed expression of molecular markers at E10.5. Within the collected embryos at this stage (n = 221), all genotypes were found in the expected frequencies, indicating that lethality of Tbx18/Pax3 double mutant embryos occurred between E10.5 and E14.5. In the E10.5 wild-type embryo, Myogenin was expressed in the myotomes in a repeating metameric pattern (Fig. 5A) (19Edmondson D.G. Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 628-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). In Pax3-/- embryos, Myogenin was segmentally expressed in myotomes, but its hypaxial domain appeared truncated (Fig. 5C, arrowhead). This is in agreement with the known role of Pax3 as a regulator of migration and survival of myotomal cells (20Williams B.A. Ordahl C.P. Development. 1994; 120: 785-796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Bober E. Franz T. Arnold H.H. Gruss P. Tremblay P. Development. 1994; 120: 603-612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Daston G. Lamar E.

Development. 1999; 126: 1665-1674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Tbx18 mutant embryos, Myogenin expression was unchanged (Fig. 5B), and no increase of the Pax3-/- phenotype was observed in double mutants (Fig. 5D, arrowhead), indicating that both genes do not cooperate in the myogenic program. Next we analyzed Pax9 that is expressed in the ventro-lateral sclerotome compartment with a strong up-regulation in the posterior somite halves in wild-type embryos (Fig. 5E) (24Neubüser A. Koseki H. Balling R. Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 701-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In Pax3-/- embryos, polarized expression of Pax9 was maintained, whereas in Tbx18-/- mutant embryos, Pax9 expression became progressively homogenous with somite maturation (Fig. 5F). In Tbx18-/-,Pax3-/- embryos (n = 3), Pax9 expression was homogeneously strong in somites along the entire axial extension (Fig. 5H), suggesting that Pax3 cooperates with Tbx18 in AP-somite polarization. To further analyze AP-somite patterning in Tbx18/Pax3 compound mutant embryos, we used Uncx4.1 as a marker of the posterior somite half and the caudo-lateral sclerotome (Fig. 5I) (9Neidhardt L.M. Kispert A. Herrmann B.G. Dev. Genes Evol. 1997; 207: 330-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In Tbx18 mutant embryos, Uncx4.1 expression was progressively expanded, demonstrating the gain of posterior and the loss of anterior somite fates (Fig. 5J) (12Bussen M. Petry M. Schuster-Gossler K. Leitges M. Gossler A. Kispert A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1209-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In Pax3 mutant embryos (n = 2), the domain of Uncx4.1 was reduced in its dorso-ventral extension. However, AP polarization of expression was largely unaffected (Fig. 5K). In Pax3-/-,Tbx18-/- embryos (n = 2), up-regulation of Uncx4.1 expression was even enhanced compared with Tbx18-/- embryos, demonstrating a further expansion of posterior somitic identity (Fig. 5L). In embryos heterozygous mutant for Pax3 or Tbx18, Uncx4.1 expression was normal. In contrast, in 3 of 10 double heterozygous embryos, expansions of Uncx4.1 expression into anterior halves of differentiated somites were detect"

In Escherichia coli, the three components TatA, TatB, and TatC mediate this membrane passage. Here we demonstrate that TatA can assemble to form clusters of tube-like structures in vivo. While the presence of TatC is essential for their formation, TatB is not required. The TatA tubes have uniform outer and inner diameters of about 11.5 nm and 6.7 nm, respectively. They align to form a crystalline-like structure in which each tube is surrounded by six TatA tubes. The tube structures become easily detectable even at only a 15-fold overexpression of the tatABC genes. The TatA tubes could also be visualized by fluorescence when untagged TatA was mixed with low amounts of TatA-GFP. The structures were often found in contact with the cell poles. Because TatC is most likely polar in E. coli, as demonstrated by a RR-dependent targeting of translocation-incompatible Tat substrates to the cell poles, and because TatC is required for the formation of aligned TatA tubes, it is proposed that the TatA tubes are initiated at polarly localized TatC.

The mechanism of this transport is unknown but must be quite unusual, because the transported proteins can be even larger in diameter than the membrane they are transported across (2Sargent F. Berks B.C. Palmer T. Arch. Microbiol. 2002; 178: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The minimal Tat translocon is composed of two components, TatA and TatC (3Pop O. Martin U. Abel C.

Trends Microbiol. 2006; 14: 2-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Proteobacteria and thylakoids require a third component for efficient translocation, TatB, which associates with TatC to form a TatBC complex (1Müller M. Klösgen R.B. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2005; 22: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Because Tat substrates bind tightly only to TatBC complexes, and because a covalent cross-link to TatC still allows translocation, it is believed that TatC is the motor for the translocation process (5Gerard F. Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6130-6135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). TatA, however, also plays an essential role, most likely by allowing the membrane passage of the substrate, which is moved by TatC across the membrane (6Dabney-Smith C. Mori H. Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5476-5483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). TatA is also the most abundant Tat component in Escherichia coli (7Jack R.L. Sargent F. Berks B.C. Sawers G. Palmer T. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1801-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In the chloroplast system, the association of TatA with the TatBC complex occurs strictly after substrate binding (6Dabney-Smith C. Mori H. Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5476-5483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), whereas TatA of Gram-positive bacteria has been detected inside the cytoplasm, where it has a high affinity for Tat substrates that might be targeted by TatA to the membranes (8Schreiber S.

Barnett J.P. Byrne K.G. Bolhuis A. Robinson C. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It has been purified from detergent-solubilized membrane fractions of strains overexpressing the tatABC genes (12Gohlke U. Pullan L. McDevitt C.A. Porcelli I. de Leeuw E. Palmer T. Saibil H.R. Berks B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10482-10486Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The TatA complexes identified in that study varied in diameter and formed a ladder in blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) analyses. The variable sizes of these TatA complexes suggest the existence of some higher order homooligomeric TatA structure, which might have been disrupted by detergent treatment. We therefore analyzed strains overexpressing tatABC, tatAB, tatAC, or tatA by transmission electron microscopy after high pressure freeze-fixation/freeze-substitution to improve the preservation of ultrastructural details (13Moor H. Steinbrecht R.A. Zierold K. Cryotechniques in Biological Electron Microscopy. Springer, Berlin1987: 175-191Crossref Google Scholar, 14Müller D. Moor H. Revel J.P. Barnard T. Haggins G.H. Science of Biological Specimen Preparation. AMF O'Hare, Chicago1984: 131-138Google Scholar). We found that TatA is capable of forming homomultimeric tubes inside the cytoplasm, which can interact with one another in the presence of TatC to form quasi-crystalline structures. E. coli TatA has therefore a previously unrecognized capacity to extend in three dimensions. Because these associations can sediment with membranes simply due to their size, the proposed strict membrane integral localization of E. coli TatA has to be questioned. The Tat systems from Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria thus appear to be more similar than previously thought. twin-arginine translocation blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone high potential iron-sulfur protein high pressure freeze-fixation green fluorescent protein.

The bacteria were grown aerobically at 37 °C on LB medium (1% (w/v) tryptone, 1% (w/v) NaCl, 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract) in the presence of the appropriate antibiotics (100 μg/ml ampicillin, 12.5 μg/ml tetracycline, 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol). Plasmids and Genetic Methods—The tatABC genes were expressed from pABS-tatABC (17Berthelmann F. Brüser T. FEBS Lett. 2004; 569: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and selected tat genes were expressed from pABS-tatAC, pABS-tatAB, or pABS-tatA (18Behrendt J. Lindenstrauss U. Brüser T. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 4085-4090Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A tatA-gfp fusion was expressed from pBAD-tatA-gfp (17Berthelmann F. Brüser T. FEBS Lett. 2004; 569: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A lower expression level of the tatABC genes was achieved with the vector pRK-tatABC (19Brüser T. Yano T. Brune D.C. Daldal F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1211-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For analyses of subcellular targeting of Tat substrates, we used a high potential iron-sulfur protein (HiPIP) Tat signal peptide fusion to five unfolded FG repeats (FG5) from Nsp1p of yeast as expressed from the rhamnose-regulated vector pBW-R5 or its twin-lysine derivative pBW-R5-KK (20Richter S. Lindenstrauss U. Lucke C. Bayliss R. Brüser T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 33257-33264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To construct expression vectors for C-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions of RR-(FG5) or KK-(FG5), gfp was amplified using pTB-DG (17Berthelmann F. Brüser T. FEBS Lett. 2004; 569: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) as template and the primers gfp-SacII-F (5′-AGG GCC CGC GGG TAA AGG AGA AGA ACT TTT CAC-3′) and gfp-XhoI-R (5′-GTC TGC TCG AGT TAT TTG TAT AGT TCA TCC ATG CC-3′), the fragment was cut with SacII and XhoI and cloned into the corresponding sites of pBW-R5 or pBW-R5-KK, resulting in pBW-R5-gfp and pBW-R5-gfp-KK, respectively. The tatA expression vector pBW-tatA-H6 was constructed by amplification of tatA with pABS-tatABC as template, using the primers tatA-NdeI-F (5′-GAA CAC ATA TGG GTG GTA TCA GTA TTT GGC-3′) and tatA-BamHI-R (5′-AAC ACG GAT CCC ACC TGC TCT TTA TCG TGG-3′), restriction with NdeI/BamHI and ligation into the corresponding sites of pBW22 (21Wilms B. Hauck A. Reuss M. Syldatk C. Mattes R. Siemann M. Altenbuchner J. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2001; 73: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The vector pTB-DG-KK was derived from pTB-DG (17Berthelmann F. Brüser T. FEBS Lett. 2004; 569: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) by exchange of the two arginine codons in the signal sequence coding region by two lysine codons using the QuikChange method with the primer pair pTB-DG-gfp-KK-F (5′-GGC TGC TGA GGT GAG TAA GAA GGG TTT GGT AAA AAC GAC AGC-3′)/pTB-DG-gfp-KK-R (5′-GCT GTC GTT TTT ACC AAA CCC TTC TTA CTC ACC TCA GCA GCC-3′). Single amino acid exchanges in TatA were achieved by the same method, using the vector pABS-tatABC and the primer pairs TatA-D31G-F (5′-GCT CCA TCG GTT CCG GCC TTG GTG CGT CGA TC-3′)/TatA-D31G-R (5′-GAT CGA CGC ACC AAG GCC GGA ACC GAT GGA GC-3′), or TatA-G33S-F (5′-CCA TCG GTT CCG ATC TTA GTG CGT CGA TCA AAG G-3′)/TatA-G33S-R (5′-CCT TTG ATC GAC GCA CTA AGA TCG GAA CCG ATG G-3′), or TatA-F39A-F (5′-GTG CGT CGA TCA AAG GCG CTA AAA AAG CAA TGA GCG ATG-3′)/TatA-F39A-R (5′-CAT CGC TCA TTG CTT TTT TAG CGC CTT TGA TCG ACG CAC-3′), or TatA-F39K-F (5′-GGT GCG TCG ATC AAA GGC AAA AAA AAA GCA ATG AGC GAT GAT G-3′)/TatA-F39K-R (5′-CAT CAT CGC TCA TTG CTT TTT TTT TGC CTT TGA TCG ACG CAC C-3′). The authenticity of all constructs was confirmed by restriction analyses and DNA sequencing. Biochemical Methods—SDS-PAGE and protein estimations were carried out by standard methods (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar, 23Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subcellular fractionations, Western blotting, and blot developments were carried out as described previously (19Brüser T. Yano T. Brune D.C. Daldal F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1211-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Relative quantities of Tat components were determined by comparison of dilution series with samples containing wild-type Tat levels on the same blot. Antibodies were used against TatA, TatB (both donated by Tim Yahr, Iowa City, IA), TatC (donated by Matthias Müller, Freiburg, Germany), GFP (ABR-Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO), and the hexahistidine-tagged HiPIP (24Brüser T. Deutzmann R. Dahl C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 164: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Hexahistidine-tagged TatA was purified from membrane preparations without solubilization, as the large TatA structures sedimented with membrane fractions. For that, cells from 100-ml cultures of strain DADE/pBW-tatA-H6 were induced for 3 h with 0.1% rhamnose during exponential growth, harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 10 ml of ice-cold buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole). Cells were then disrupted by passage through a French pressure cell, followed by a low speed centrifugation step at 3,500 × g to separate cell debris, and a high speed centrifugation at 130,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The high speed sediment containing membranes and TatA was resuspended in 6 ml of the above mentioned buffer and loaded on a 1-ml nickel-chelate matrix column (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The column was washed with 15 volumes of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, and 10% glycerol, and TatA was subsequently eluted in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 250 mm imidazole. Electron Microscopy Methods—Bacteria growing in the exponential phase were concentrated by filtration, transferred into aluminum planchets (cavity 2-mm diameter, 0.3-mm depth) and frozen under high pressure with an HPM 010 apparatus (BAL-TEC, Liechtenstein). The cells were cryosubstituted with 0.25% (w/v) glutaraldehyde (Sigma) and 0.1% (w/v) uranyl acetate (Chemapol, Czech Republic) in acetone at –80 °C for 4 days using special cryosubstitution equipment (FSU, BAL-TEC). Thereafter, the temperature was increased up to –20 °C. Subsequently the samples were infiltrated stepwise with Lowicryl (HM20; Polysciences Europe, Eppelheim, Germany) and polymerized with UV light (24 h at –20 °C and 24 h hours without cooling). Ultrathin sections of 80-nm thickness were transferred onto nickel grids and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate in an EM-Stain apparatus (Leica, Bensheim, Germany). For immunogold labeling, ultrathin sections were treated with a polyclonal anti-TatA antibody and a secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with 10-nm gold particles (Clontech Takara Bio Europe, St. Germain, France) prior to staining. Negatively stained samples were prepared by spreading 10 μl of the dispersion onto a Cu grid coated with a Formvar-film. After 1 min of adsorption excess liquid was blotted off with filter paper and 5 μl of 1% aqueous uranyl acetate were placed on the grid, drained off after 1 min and dried. Both ultrathin sections and negatively stained samples were observed with an EM 900 transmission electron microscope (Carl Zeiss SMT, Oberkochen, Germany). Micrographs were taken with a Vario-speed SSCCD SM-1k-120 camera (TRS, Moorenweis, Germany). The software used for taking, storing, and analyzing the pictures (iTEM) was provided by Olympus Soft Imaging Solutions, Münster, Germany. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy—For microscopical analysis, exponentially growing cultures were analyzed in LB medium without concentration or dilution of the sample. Strains containing pBAD-derivatives were grown for 3 h in the presence of l-arabinose at the concentrations indicated. To immobilize cells, slides were thin-coated with 2% (w/v) agarose in LB medium. Laser scanning confocal data were acquired using a Zeiss LSM510 META mounted on an Axiovert 200 m with a Zeiss water immersion C-Apochromat objective lens (63×/NA1.2 W). Excitation was at 488 nm, and emission was detected between 505 nm and 530 nm. Cells were visualized by differential interference contrast (DIC), using Nomarski optics unless otherwise indicated. Micrographs were captured with Zeiss LSM software. E. coli TatA Can Form Ordered Tube Structures—TatA homologs are found in all known bacterial Tat systems (25Saier Jr., M.H. J. Membr. Biol. 2006; 214: 75-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). TatA is believed to function as a targeting factor in Gram-positive bacteria (8Schreiber S. Stengel R. Westermann M.

Solubilized TatA from E. coli membrane fractions migrates as a ladder of modular homomultimeric assemblies in BN-PAGE (11Oates J. Barrett C.M. Barnett J.P. Byrne K.G. Bolhuis A. Robinson C. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Purified, detergent-treated E. coli TatA has been shown to form ring-like structures, prompting the well-recognized hypothesis that TatA may form a channel for the passage of Tat substrates (12Gohlke U. Pullan L. McDevitt C.A. Porcelli I. de Leeuw E. Palmer T. Saibil H.R. Berks B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10482-10486Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). We considered the possibility that the multitude of different TatA complexes might result from disassembly or reorganization of much larger complexes that could possibly be detectable by electron microscopy of cells after high pressure freeze-fixation (HPF), a method that can preserve sensitive structures within the cells. As the previously analyzed TatA complexes were purified from strains highly overexpressing the tatABC genes, we started our analyses with a strain that overexpresses the tatABC genes about 60-fold from a p15 origin vector. The cells of this strain often contained remarkably large regions of parallel structures, which were tightly associated in a very ordered manner (Fig. 1, A1). These structures were readily detectable in about half of the cell population, even though we looked only at thin sections of 80 nm, which cannot visualize the complete cell interior. The data therefore suggested that the structures were present in most, if not all, cells. As shown below, the observed parallel lines (Fig. 1, A1) are caused by tube-like structures that are cut in the longitudinal direction (inset of Fig. 1, A1). Albeit less abundant, the same structures were also detectable with the low copy pRK-tatABC vector system that confers only a 15–20-fold increase in the amount of the Tat components (Fig. 1C). We also detected cross sections of these tube arrangements (Fig. 1, A2) in which a very regular assembly of tubes was observed with a central tube interacting with six surrounding tubes (inset of Fig. 1, A2). This 6-fold symmetry was observed in all detected tube assemblies, making it likely that the units that form these tubes exhibit a 6-fold symmetry, too. Notably, spike-like connections between the tubes were often visible, suggesting some direct interactions between the tubes (see arrows in Fig. 1, A2 and D). The tube structures could have been formed by either of the overproduced TatA, TatB, or TatC components. We therefore immunogold-labeled the thin sections using primary antibodies against TatA, TatB, or TatC. Only TatA was detectable in the structures (Fig. 1B). Because TatA seemed to be the main constituent of the tube structures, we considered that the presence of TatB or TatC might not be necessary at all for the formation of aligned tubes. We therefore analyzed cells that overproduced TatA only or in combination with either TatB or TatC in the complete absence of all other Tat components. When TatB was lacking, the tube structures were formed just as observed previously (Fig. 1, D and H). Obviously, TatB is not required for these structures to form. However, we noted that all tubes in the strain overproducing only TatA and TatC contained a single area of high electron density in their center (compare Fig. 1, H with G). Because the TatA tubes from strains co-overproducing TatA, TatB, and TatC were hollow, this suggests some influence of TatB on the tube structure. TatB may therefore either influence the conformation of TatA in the tubes, or prevent the inclusion of other proteins in these structures. To ascertain the size of the tubes we measured the inside and outside diameters of 114 and 145 tubes, respectively. The mean inner diameter was 6.7 ± 0.8 nm and the mean outer diameter was 11.5 ± 1.2 nm. In cells that were devoid of TatC, TatD, and TatE, but overproduced TatA and TatB (Fig. 1F), no ordered structures could be found. Instead, some shaded areas were present in these cells, indicating some sort of random aggregation. The same was observed with cells overproducing TatA only (Fig. 1E). It thus seems that TatA needs TatC to form detectable amounts of ordered structures. In one sample, a disrupted cell (Fig. 1, J2) offered us a unique glimpse of the tubes in a cell-free situation, showing that the structures indeed consist of individual tubes (Fig. 1, J1). Interactions between tubes were disrupted upon cell lysis, and therefore they seem not to be very strong. As the tubes were released from a cell that overexpressed tatA and tatC, the tubes contained a continuous central thread (arrowhead in Fig. 1, J1), which we believe corresponds to the central dot-like electron density visible in the cross sections described above (arrowhead in Fig. 1H). Fluorescence Microscopy Localization of the TatA Tubes—While electron microscopy is the technique of choice for obtaining high resolution pictures, it has the disadvantage of showing only a thin section of the cell. To find out more about the actual size and arrangement of the TatA tubes we attempted to visualize them by fluorescence microscopy using TatA fusions to the GFP. In the past we already analyzed the fluorescence in cells that produced only GFP-fused TatA together with native TatB and TatC, and we detected the fusion protein only at the periphery of the cell. This indicated that TatA is most likely membrane-associated, but not organized in larger cytoplasmic assemblies (17Berthelmann F. Brüser T. FEBS Lett. 2004; 569: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Apparently, the fused GFP inhibited the interactions that lead to the formation of aligned tubes. This is not surprising, considering the size of GFP (near 30 kDa), which is considerably larger than that of TatA (near 10 kDa). Most likely GFP sterically hinders tube formation or tube alignment. To circumvent this apparent inhibitory effect of GFP, we produced low amounts of TatA-GFP in a strain expressing the native tatABC genes from a compatible plasmid. To rule out any unspecific aggregation of the TatA-GFP fusion protein, we also analyzed a strain that produced TatA-GFP from the same arabinose-inducible vector in the complete absence of the other Tat components (Fig. 2A). TatA was located peripherally in or at the membrane, which confirms our previous results on TatA-GFP localization (17Berthelmann F. Brüser T. FEBS Lett. 2004; 569: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The fluorescence distribution changed dramatically as soon as we overexpressed the tatABC genes together with tatA-gfp. Not all cells showed fluorescence, but TatA-GFP was now detected in long fluorescent filaments that became visible in many cells (Fig. 2, B–E). Apparently, small amounts of TatA-GFP were incorporated into the TatA tubes. The fluorescent filaments often started at the cell poles, reaching far into the cell (Fig. 2, C and D). We even found very long structures that seemingly spanned the cell from one pole to the other (Fig. 2B). In all pictures the concentration of fluorescent TatA-GFP can be seen at the cell poles, whereas these polar dots were very rare in the negative control synthesizing TatA-GFP only (Fig. 2A). Targeting of a Tat Substrate to Tat Translocons at the Cell Poles—Another way of localizing the Tat translocon is to track the whereabouts of Tat substrates during transport. One problem of this approach is that Tat substrates diffuse freely within the periplasm after translocation and thus do not necessarily indicate the position of the translocon. We solved this problem by using a fusion protein consisting of the Tat signal peptide from HiPIP fused to five natively unfolded FG repeats of the Nsp1p yeast nuclear pore protein and a C-terminal GFP. The FG repeats of this construct, named RR-(FG5)-GFP, thus serve as an unstructured linker peptide which connects the signal peptide to a folded GFP domain. The RR-(FG5) construct without GFP has recently been demonstrated to be Tat-dependently translocated (20Richter S. Lindenstrauss U. Lucke C. Bayliss R. Brüser T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 33257-33264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We now found that an additional folded GFP domain at the C terminus completely blocked translocation (Fig. 2F). The block of translocation by the GFP fusion is similar to earlier observations with other linker-containing fusion proteins (27Cline K. McCaffery M. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3039-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We analyzed also a RR>KK variant of the substrate. This exchange within the twin-arginine motif has previously been shown to block Tat transport of HiPIP and an interaction of the Tat system with a HiPIP signal peptide-PhoA fusion protein (19Brüser T. Yano T. Brune D.C. Daldal F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1211-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 28Richter S. Brüser T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42723-42730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). As expected, the KK-(FG5)-GFP was not translocated. We detected precursor of RR-(FG5)-GFP and KK-(FG5)-GFP in the membrane fraction, which is due to the earlier reported Tat-independent membrane interaction of this and other signal peptides (19Brüser T. Yano T. Brune D.C. Daldal F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1211-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 29Shanmugham A. Wong Fong Sang H.W. Bollen Y.J. Lill H. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2243-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 30Hou B. Frielingsdorf S. Klösgen R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). When we compared the localization of RR-(FG5)-GFP with that of the KK-(FG5)-GFP negative control, we found small, distinct, and mainly polar spots with the RR-(FG5)-GFP construct (Fig. 2G), whereas we observed a uniform cytoplasmic distribution of (FG5)-GFP with the KK signal peptide (Fig. 2H). The fluorescent RR-(FG5)-GFP spots were not aggregates, as no inclusion bodies could be found by differential centrifugation (no sedimentation at 1.500 × g and 15.000 × g; Fig. 2K), by electron microscopy of cryo-fixed cells, or by fluorescence microscopy after cell disruption (data not shown). The fluorescent foci indicate the position of active substrate-binding translocons for three reasons: (1) They depend on the presence of the twin-arginines in the signal peptide; (2) we had to overexpress the tatABC genes in this experiment to increase translocon-bound substrate fluorescence to levels higher than the background produced by unbound substrate; and (3) strains that overexpress tatAC alone, and thus lack TatB for the formation of an active translocon, did not show RR-(FG5)-GFP foci (see supplemental Fig. S1). As the translocation is blocked with the substrate RR-(FG5)-GFP, it was possible that the fluorescent foci formed by this construct represent some stable translocation intermediate that accumulates in the membrane near the translocon. However, this is not the case. The spots are transient and clearly depend on the energy of the cells, as they disappear within 10 min of treatment with the uncoupler CCCP (Fig. 2-J). The spots vanish upon cell disruption and in vivo cross-linking approaches so far failed to trap this transient interaction, suggesting that the fluorescent RR-(FG5)-GFP foci are not the result of an accumulated transmembrane intermediate. Rather, the results suggest they derive from short-lived reversible substrate-translocon interactions that might involve actively transporting translocons because energy and Tat functionality are required for these foci to form. As long as the overall transport mechanism is unclear and the in vivo interactions to Tat systems cannot be identified by cross-links in the bacterial system, it remains unclear at which stage exactly the GFP fusion affects transport. Nonetheless, the data clearly show that under our experimental conditions there is a targeting of Tat substrates to a polar translocon component that recognizes the twin-arginine motif, which is TatC. A polarly localized TatC is also in full agreement with the polar origin of TatA structures described above, as TatC is essential for the formation of these structures.

The Tree of Life represents such diversification processes through the evolutionary relationships among the different taxa, and can be extended down to intra-specific relationships. Here we examine the topological properties of a large set of interspecific and intraspecific phylogenies and show that the branching patterns follow allometric rules conserved across the different levels in the Tree of Life, all significantly departing from those expected from the standard null models. The finding of non-random universal patterns of phylogenetic differentiation suggests that similar evolutionary forces drive diversification across the broad range of scales, from macro-evolutionary to micro-evolutionary processes, shaping the diversity of life on the planet."

In the study presented here, we analyzed the APP-transgenic mouse model APP23 using 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis technology in combination with DIGE and mass spectrometry. We investigated cortex and hippocampus of transgenic and wildtype mice at 1, 2, 7 and 15 months of age. Furthermore, cortices of 16 days old embryos were analyzed. When comparing the protein patterns of APP23 with wildtype mice, we detected a relatively large number of altered protein spots at all age stages and brain regions examined which largely preceded the occurrence of amyloid plaques. Interestingly, in hippocampus of adolescent, two-month old mice, a considerable peak in the number of protein changes was observed. Moreover, when protein patterns were compared longitudinally between age stages, we found that a large number of proteins were altered in wildtype mice. Those alterations were largely absent in hippocampus of APP23 mice at two months of age although not in other stages compared. Apparently, the large difference in the hippocampal protein patterns between two-month old APP23 and wildtype mice was caused by the absence of distinct developmental changes in the hippocampal proteome of APP23 mice. In summary, the absence of developmental proteome alterations as well as a down-regulation of proteins related to plasticity suggest the disturption of a normally occurring peak of hippocampal plasticity during adolescence in APP23 mice. Our findings are in line with the observation that AD is preceded by a clinically silent period of several years to decades. We also demonstrate that it is of utmost importance to analyze different brain regions and different age stages to obtain information about disease-causing mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1970229280,"ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are a large superfamily of proteins that mediate substrate translocation across biological membranes. Our goal was to define the intramolecular interactions that contribute to quaternary assembly of a eukaryotic ABC transporter and determine how the architecture of this protein influences its biogenesis within the secretory pathway. We used chemical cross-linking approaches to map interdomain interactions in the yeast ABC transporter, Yor1p, which functions as a pleiotropic drug pump at the plasma membrane. We have defined interactions between the two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) and between the NBDs and specific intracellular loops (ICLs) that are consistent with current structural models of bacterial ABC exporters. Furthermore, we detected relatively weak NBD-NBD and ICL-ICL interactions that may correspond to transient sites of cross-talk between domains required for coupling of ATP hydrolysis with substrate translocation. Mutation of a key residue in ICL2 caused misassembly of the altered protein, leading to increased sensitivity to the mitochondrial poison, oligomycin. We identified intragenic suppressing mutations that rescued the oligomycin resistance associated with this aberrant protein and demonstrated that the suppressing mutations restored multiple interdomain interfaces. Together, our biochemical and genetic approaches contribute to a greater understanding of the architecture of this important class of proteins and provide insight into the quality control surveillance that regulates their biogenesis and deployment within the eukaryotic cell."
https://openalex.org/W2126699442,"Unisexual all-female lizards of the genus Darevskia that are well adapted to various habitats are known to reproduce normally by true parthenogenesis. Although they consist of unisexual lineages and lack effective genetic recombination, they are characterized by some level of genetic polymorphism. To reveal the mutational contribution to overall genetic variability, the most straightforward and conclusive way is the direct detection of mutation events in pedigree genotyping. Earlier we selected from genomic library of D. unisexualis two polymorphic microsatellite containg loci Du281 and Du215. In this study, these two loci were analyzed to detect possible de novo mutations in 168 parthenogenetic offspring of 49 D. unisexualis mothers and in 147 offspring of 50 D. armeniaca mothers . No mutant alleles were detected in D. armeniaca offspring at both loci, and in D. unisexualis offspring at the Du215 locus. There were a total of seven mutational events in the germ lines of four of the 49 D. unisexualis mothers at the Du281 locus, yielding the mutation rate of 0.1428 events per germ line tissue. Sequencing of the mutant alleles has shown that most mutations occur via deletion or insertion of single microsatellite repeat being identical in all offspring of the family. This indicates that such mutations emerge at the early stages of embryogenesis. In this study we characterized single highly unstable (GATA)n containing locus in parthenogenetic lizard species D. unisexualis. Besides, we characterized various types of mutant alleles of this locus found in the D. unisexualis offspring of the first generation. Our data has shown that microsatellite mutations at highly unstable loci can make a significant contribution to population variability of parthenogenetic lizards."

In contrast to the ET via Tyr-21, formation of the W state results in generation of only the dark state conformation (even if the initial conformation is in the light state); this could explain why Trp-104-mediated ET deactivates the light-sensing yield and why the activity of W104A mutant is similar to that of the light-adapted native BLUF.

Braatsch S. Osterloh L. Klug G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12306-12311Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The photoactivation of the BLUF domain from Rhodobactor sphaeroides is mediated by a red shift intermediate state that mainly consists of FAD and Tyr-21 (2Kraft B.J. Masuda S. Kikuchi J. Dragnea V.

Via proton transfer (PT) from Y to (FAD⋅¯), the Y-W-(FAD⋅¯) state transforms into the charge-neutral Y·-W-FADH· state and finally decays to the ground state (3Gauden M. van Stokkum I.H.M. Key J.M.

Recent spectroscopic studies suggested that not only Tyr-21 but also Trp-104 act as electron donors in the charge separation process, where Tyr-21 is the functionally relevant charge state (i.e. the productive pathway in Ref. 4Gauden M. Grinstead J.S. Laan W. van Stokkum I.H.M. Avila-Perez M. Toh K.C. Boelens R. Kaptein R. van Grondelle R. Hellingwerf K.J. Kennis J.T.M.

Note that although FAD is the cofactor in the native BLUF domain (5Masuda S. Bauer C.E. Cell. 2002; 110: 613-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), the BLUF fragment contains a mixture of flavins (i.e. FMN (majority), FAD, and riboflavin) when expressed in Escherichia coli (6Laan W. van der Horst M.A. van Stokkum I.H.M. Hellingwerf K.J. Photochem. Photobiol. 2003; 78: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In fact, FMN is identified in the BLUF crystal structures from R. sphaeroides (7Anderson S. Dragnea V. Masuda S. Ybe J. Moffat K. Bauer C. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7998-8005Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 8Jung A. Reinstein J. Domratcheva T. Shoeman R.L. Schlichting I. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 717-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Currently, there are several points that need to be clarified for understanding the BLUF domain as described below. In the protein environment of the BLUF domain, the orientation of the key residue Gln-63 with respect to Tyr-21 is a matter of debate. From observations of the native BLUF crystal structure, Anderson et al. (7Anderson S. Dragnea V. Masuda S. Ybe J. Moffat K. Bauer C. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7998-8005Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) proposed that the –NH2 group of the Gln-63 side chain forms a hydrogen bond with Tyr-21 in the dark state and that the –CO group of the Gln-63 side chain forms a hydrogen bond with Tyr-21 in the light state (Fig. 1). In contrast, from observations of the C20S mutant crystal structure, Jung et al. (8Jung A. Reinstein J. Domratcheva T. Shoeman R.L. Schlichting I. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 717-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) assigned “dark” and “light” states that were opposite to those assigned by Anderson et al. (7Anderson S. Dragnea V. Masuda S. Ybe J. Moffat K. Bauer C. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7998-8005Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The majority of spectroscopic and mutational studies (9Masuda S. Hasegawa K. Ono T.-A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1215-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 10Kita A. Okajima K. Morimoto Y. Ikeuchi M. Miki K. J. Mol.

Soc. 2006; 128: 15066-15067Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) suggested the same assignment of the dark and light structures as that proposed by Anderson et al. (7Anderson S. Dragnea V. Masuda S. Ybe J. Moffat K. Bauer C. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7998-8005Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In the present study, I tentatively follow the definition of Anderson et al. (7Anderson S. Dragnea V. Masuda S. Ybe J. Moffat K. Bauer C. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7998-8005Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) if not otherwise specified (see Fig. 1 for the definition used in the present study). Another open question is the functionally relevant location of Trp-104 with respect to the FMN binding site. In the crystal structure of the native BLUF domain refined by Anderson et al. (7Anderson S. Dragnea V. Masuda S. Ybe J. Moffat K. Bauer C. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7998-8005Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), the indole nitrogen atom of the Trp-104 side chain is at a hydrogen-bonding distance from the carbonyl oxygen atom of the Gln-63 side chain (i.e. Win conformation; see Fig. 2a). On the other hand, in the crystal structures of the C20S mutant by Jung et al. (8Jung A. Reinstein J. Domratcheva T. Shoeman R.L. Schlichting I. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 717-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), Trp-104 is located on the protein surface and exposed to the bulk solvent (i.e. Wout conformation; see Fig. 2b). The Wout conformation is also identified in the BLUF domain from Thermosynechococcus elongatus (10Kita A. Okajima K. Morimoto Y. Ikeuchi M. Miki K. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Jung et al. (8Jung A. Reinstein J. Domratcheva T. Shoeman R.L. Schlichting I. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 717-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) argued that the Win conformation reported by Anderson et al. (7Anderson S. Dragnea V. Masuda S. Ybe J. Moffat K. Bauer C. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7998-8005Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) may be induced by the presence of detergent molecules. However, the Win conformation can be seen in most NMR solution structural models of the BLUF domain (13Grinstead J.S. Hsu S.-T. Laan W. Bonvin A.M. Hellingwerf K.J. Boelens R. Kaptein R. ChemBioChem. 2006; 7: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Recent spectroscopic studies suggested that Q63L and W104A mutants are insensitive to blue light, implying a functionally important role of a hydrogen bond between the two residues (that should exist only in the Win conformation) (14Masuda S. Tomida Y. Ohta H. Takamiya K. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 368: 1223-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It is known that photoactivation of the BLUF domain induces the rotation of the Gln-63 side chain (7Anderson S. Dragnea V. Masuda S. Ybe J. Moffat K. Bauer C. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7998-8005Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). However, the driving force of the Gln-63 rotation is yet unclear. It was proposed that proton movements (namely the PT from Y to the N5 atom of (FMN⋅¯)) underlie the rotation from the observed kinetic isotope effects (3Gauden M. van Stokkum I.H.M. Key J.M. Luhrs D.C. van Grondelle R. Hegemann P. Kennis J.T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 10895-10900Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). To clarify the functional relevance of these possible four conformers (i.e. dark-Wout and light-Wout (Protein Data Bank 2IYI and 2IYG, respectively) (Fig. 1) (8Jung A. Reinstein J. Domratcheva T. Shoeman R.L. Schlichting I. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 717-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), dark-Win (Protein Data Bank 1YRX) (7Anderson S. Dragnea V. Masuda S. Ybe J. Moffat K. Bauer C. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7998-8005Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and light-Win (no corresponding Protein Data Bank entry; see Fig. 3)), the values of the ET driving energy for each protein conformer that are yet experimentally unavailable need to be clarified. Recently, I calculated the redox (midpoint) potential (Em) of flavin (15Ishikita H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25240-25246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 16Ishikita H. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 4394-4402Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and redox-active tyrosine (17Ishikita H. Knapp E.W. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 3886-3896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) precisely by considering the protonation states of all titratable sites in the proteins. In this study, I present the (Em) of FMN for one-electron reduction (Em(FMN/(FMN⋅¯)), protonated tyrosine for one-electron oxidation (Em(Y/Y)), and tryptophan for one-electron oxidation (Em(W/W)) in the BLUF domain, by solving the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation for all atoms in the crystal structures. From the calculated Em, I obtain the driving energy of the ET in the charge separation process (via Tyr-21 and Trp-104) of the known four BLUF conformers. Then I evaluate (i) functional relevance of the conformers assigned by Anderson et al. (7Anderson S. Dragnea V. Masuda S. Ybe J. Moffat K. Bauer C. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7998-8005Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and Jung et al. (8Jung A. Reinstein J. Domratcheva T. Shoeman R.L. Schlichting I. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 717-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), (ii) difference of the ET energetics in the Win and Wout structures, and (iii) why the charge separation process involving Trp-104 does not lead to the light signaling state. Since the dark and light state structures are originally available only for the Wout structure (8Jung A. Reinstein J. Domratcheva T. Shoeman R.L. Schlichting I. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 717-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) (i.e. without performing the modeling of protein atomic coordinates), the computational results of the Wout structure (8Jung A. Reinstein J. Domratcheva T. Shoeman R.L. Schlichting I. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 717-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) are mainly presented if not otherwise specified. In particular, the results of Wout and Win were essentially the same in the ET via Tyr-21 but not in the ET via Trp-104. In the present study, I used the same conditions sufficiently evaluated in previous studies on proteins that contain flavin (15Ishikita H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25240-25246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 16Ishikita H.

In this study, the crystal structures with Protein Data Bank code 2IYI and 2IYG were regarded as dark and light state structures (i.e. dark-Wout and light-Wout), respectively (Fig. 1). This definition of the dark and light structures is the same as that proposed Anderson et al. (7Anderson S. Dragnea V. Masuda S. Ybe J. Moffat K. Bauer C. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7998-8005Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 9Masuda S. Hasegawa K. Ono T.-A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1215-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 10Kita A.

Soc. 2006; 128: 15066-15067Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). For the Win conformations, I used the crystal structure refined by Anderson et al. (7Anderson S. Dragnea V. Masuda S. Ybe J. Moffat K. Bauer C. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7998-8005Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) as the dark state structure (i.e. dark-Win). I modeled the light-Win structure by rotating the side chain –NH2 and –CO groups of Gln-63 by 180° along the Cγ-Cδ axis (Fig. 3). The obtained atomic coordinates of the Gln-63 side chain for the light-Win structure in the chargeneutral [Y-W-FMN] state are shown in Table S1. The positions of the hydrogen atoms were energetically optimized with CHARMM (18Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13969) Google Scholar) by using the CHARMM22 force field. During this procedure, the positions of all nonhydrogen atoms were fixed, and the standard charge states of all of the titratable groups were maintained (i.e. basic and acidic groups were considered to be protonated and deprotonated, respectively). All of the other atoms whose coordinates were available in the crystal structure were not geometrically optimized. Note that the protein atomic coordinates obtained after the energy optimization process revealed that Tyr-21 is a hydrogen bond donor to the –NH2 and –CO groups of the Gln-63 side chain in the dark and light structures, respectively, in agreement with what was observed in recent density functional theory studies (19Takahashi R. Okajima K. Suzuki H. Nakamura H. Ikeuchi M. Noguchi T. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 6459-6467Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Atomic partial charges of the amino acids were adopted from the all atom CHARMM22 (18Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13969) Google Scholar) parameter set. Atomic charges of the 5′-phosphate group of FMN quinone (–H3PO3, (−H2PO3−), and (−HPO32−)) were adopted from those of methylphosphate. The charges of FMN, (FMN⋅¯) and FMNH· were from a previous report on flavodoxin (15Ishikita H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25240-25246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The atomic charges for the redox-active tyrosine were adopted from Ref. 20Popovic D.M. Zmiric A. Zaric S.D. Knapp E.-W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 3775-3782Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar (protonated tyrosine with neutral charge (Y) and protonated tyrosine radical with positive charge Y in the redox pair Y/Y). The atomic charges for the redox-active tryptophan were adopted from Ref. 20Popovic D.M. Zmiric A. Zaric S.D. Knapp E.-W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 3775-3782Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar (protonated tryptophan with neutral charge (W) and protonated tryptophan radical with positive charge W in the redox pair W/W). Protonation Pattern, Redox Potential, and pKa—The present computation is based on the electrostatic continuum model created by solving the linear Poisson-Boltzmann equation with the MEAD program (21Bashford D. Karplus M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10219-10225Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). To facilitate a direct comparison with previous computational results, I uniformly used identical computational conditions and parameters, such as atomic partial charges and dielectric constants (e.g. see Refs. 15Ishikita H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25240-25246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 17Ishikita H. Knapp E.W. Biophys.

A. 2006; 103: 9855-9860Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To obtain the absolute Em values of the protein, we calculated the electrostatic energy difference between the two redox states in a reference model system using a known experimental Em value. The difference in the Em value of the protein relative to the reference system was added to the known Em value (see below). All of the other titratable sites, including the 5′-phosphate group, were fully equilibrated to the redox state of FMN during the titration. The ensemble of the protonation patterns was sampled by the Monte Carlo method with Karlsberg. 3Rabenstein, B., Ullmann, G. M., and Knapp, E.-W. (1998) Eur. Bophys. J. 27, 626–637. The dielectric constants were set to ϵp = 4 inside the protein and ϵw = 80 for water. All computations were performed at 300 K, pH 7.0, and an ionic strength of 100 mm. The linear Poisson-Boltzmann equation was solved using a three-step grid-focusing procedure at resolutions of 2.5, 1.0, and 0.3 Å. The Monte Carlo sampling yielded the probabilities [Aox] and [Ared] of the two redox states of molecule A. Em was evaluated using the Nernst equation. A bias potential was applied to obtain an equal amount of both redox states ([Aox] = [Ared]), thereby yielding the redox midpoint potential Em as the resulting bias potential. From this analogy, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, pKa can be calculated as the pH at which the concentrations of the protonated and deprotonated residue species are equal (Henderson-Hasselbalch pKa). For convenience, the computed Em value was given with mV accuracy, without implying that the last digit was significant. In general, an Em value of ∼10 mV is a sufficiently reproducible range for the computational method used (e.g. see Refs. 15Ishikita H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25240-25246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 17Ishikita H. Knapp E.W. Biophys.

The value of 8.6 (23Draper R.D. Ingraham L.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 125: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) was taken as the pKa(N5) value in the reference model system of (FMN⋅¯/FMNH⋅) equilibrium in aqueous solution. The value of 6.4 (24Kumler W.D. Eiler J.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1943; 65: 2355-2361Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar) was considered as the pKa value of the 5′-phosphate group of (−H2PO3−/−HPO32−). Note that the 5′-phosphate group was permanently deprotonated in the (−H3PO3−/−H2PO32−) equilibrium (pKa = 1.4 (24Kumler W.D. Eiler J.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1943; 65: 2355-2361Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar)) in all of the crystal structures that were investigated. Thus, in the present study, the (−H2PO3−/−HPO32−) equilibrium (pKa = 6.4 (24Kumler W.D. Eiler J.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1943; 65: 2355-2361Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar)) was investigated, unless otherwise specified. As a reference model system, the following values for Em versus the normal hydrogen electrode were used: Em(Y/Y) = +1380 mV (25Tommos C. Babcock G.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 199-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) and Em(W/W) = +1070 mV (26Tommos C. Skalicky J.J. Pilloud D.L. Wand A.J. Dutton P.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9495-9507Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) for one-electron oxidation in an aqueous solution. (Em(FMN/FMN⋅¯)) = -333 mV (15Ishikita H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25240-25246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) was used as the reference model system of (Em(FMN/FMN⋅¯)) in an aqueous solution (see further discussion in the supplemental materials). Driving Energy in the ET Involving Tyr-21—By calculating (Em(FMN/FMN⋅¯)) and Em(Y/Y), I obtained the driving energy (ΔG) of the ET between FMN and Y to be -156 and -317 meV for the dark and light state structures in the charge-separated Y-W-(FMN⋅¯) state, respectively (Table 1). I found that the calculated ΔG in the light state structure (-317 meV) is greater by 160 meV than that in the dark state structure (-156 meV; Table 1). This tendency essentially holds true for the chargeneutral [Y-W-FMN] state. Since the light state structure is energetically much favorable for the ET than the dark state structure in the present study, the charge separation process via Tyr-21 ([Y-W-FMN → Y-W-(FMN⋅¯) should complete with the light state structure (Fig. 1).TABLE 1Redox potentials and ET driving energies in mV and meV units, respectivelyStructureDarkaDark (light) state structure where the –NH2 (–CO) group of the Gln-63 side chain is a hydrogen-bonding partner of Tyr-21-WoutbWout (Win) conformation where Trp-104 is in (out of) the FMN binding pocket (2IYIcSee Ref. 8)LightaDark (light) state structure where the –NH2 (–CO) group of the Gln-63 side chain is a hydrogen-bonding partner of Tyr-21-WoutbWout (Win) conformation where Trp-104 is in (out of) the FMN binding pocket (2IYGcSee Ref. 8)DarkaDark (light) state structure where the –NH2 (–CO) group of the Gln-63 side chain is a hydrogen-bonding partner of Tyr-21-WinbWout (Win) conformation where Trp-104 is in (out of) the FMN binding pocket (1YRXdSee Ref. 7)LightaDark (light) state structure where the –NH2 (–CO) group of the Gln-63 side chain is a hydrogen-bonding partner of Tyr-21-WinbWout (Win) conformation where Trp-104 is in (out of) the FMN binding pocket (1YRXdSee Ref. 7 (modeled)eThe –NH2 and –CO groups of Gln-63 were rotated by 180° along the Cγ-Cδ axis, and their positions were energetically optimized with CHARMM (18))Em(FMN/(FMN⋅¯))[Y-W-FMN]fEm(FMN/(FMN⋅¯)), Em(Y/Y), and Em(W/W) were calculated in the charge-neutral (Y-W and W-FMN) states, respectively, by using the atomic coordinates of the ground [Y-W-FMN] conformer–564–587–556–549[Y-W-(FMN⋅¯)]gEm(FMN/(FMN⋅¯)) and Em(Y/Y) were calculated in the charge-neutral (Y-W and W-FMN) states, respectively, by using the atomic coordinates of the [Y-W-(FMN⋅¯)] conformer.

The integrins are heterodimeric cell adhesion molecules, each formed by an α and β subunit. Twenty-four specific pairs of integrins are expressed in humans. They serve as adhesion molecules and are bona fide signaling receptors.

The αLmCFP and β2mYFP expression constructs were reported previously (38Kim M. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Science. 2003; 301: 1720-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 39Vararattanavech A. Tang M.L. Li H.Y. Wong C.H. Law S.K. Torres J. Tan S.M. Biochem. J. 2007; 410: 495-502Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The αMmCFP, αMLmCFP, αML*mCFP constructs were generated using standard molecular biology procedures. All point mutations that introduce Cys into αM and β2 TMs were made using the QuikChange™ site directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with relevant primer pairs. All expression constructs were verified by sequencing (Research Biolabs sequencing service, Singapore).Cell Culture and Transfection—293T and K562 cells (ATCC) were maintained in either DMEM medium or RPMI1640 medium, respectively, each containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Hyclone, Logan, UT) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Transient transfection of 293T was performed by the calcium phosphate method (35Tang M.L. Kong L.S. Law S.K. Tan S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 348: 1184-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). 5 μg of plasmid was used for each indicated constructs unless otherwise stated. Transient transfection of K562 was performed by electroporation using the Amaxa Nucleofector device and reagents as recommended by the manufacturer (Amaxa Gmbh). αMLCFP and variants (3.5 μg each), αLCFP (3.5 μg), β2YFP and variants (3.5 μg each), HA-uPAR, and HA-D2D3 (2.7 μg each) were used unless otherwise indicated.Flow Cytometry and FRET Analyses—Flow cytometry analyses of transfectants were performed essentially as described (35Tang M.L. Kong L.S. Law S.K. Tan S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 348: 1184-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were stained with 20 μg/ml primary mAb followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (1:400 dilution) (Sigma). Stained cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur using the CellQuest software (BD Biosciences).Photobleach FRET was performed essentially as reported (39Vararattanavech A. Tang M.L. Li H.Y. Wong C.H. Law S.K. Torres J. Tan S.M. Biochem. J. 2007; 410: 495-502Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). K562 transfectants expressing the integrin α and β subunits with mCFP or mYFP fused to their cytoplasmic tails were spun onto poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides. Photobleach FRET was performed on a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope with an oil immersion 63× objective (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY). mCFP was excited with the 458=nm argon laser line, and the emission signal was detected with a BP 470–500-nm emission filter. mYFP was excited using the 514-nm argon laser line, and the emission signal was detected with a LP 530-nm emission filter. mCFP and mYFP were excited, and emission signals were detected for 10 time points. The time interval between each time point was 3 s, except that between the fifth and sixth time points, when photobleaching of mYFP was performed. For mYFP photobleach, the entire cell was scanned 20 times with the 514 argon laser line set at the maximum intensity. The duration of the photobleach was ∼60 s depending on the size of the cell that was scanned. For analysis, only the cell membrane was selected as the region of interest. Fluorescent signals that were detected in the perinuclear region of the cell (integrins in the Golgi) were not considered. The mCFP signals in the region of interest at the fifth time point (pre-mYFP photobleach) and sixth time point (post-mYFP photobleach) were acquired. FRET efficiency (EF) was calculated as a percentage based on the equation EF = (I6 - I5) × 100/I6, where In is the mCFP intensity at the nth time point. Similar analyses of cells that were not subjected to mYFP photobleach (referred to as unbleached) were included and plotted against samples that were subjected to photobleach. The mean noise computed as NF = (I5 - I4) × 100/I5 in which the mCFP signals at the fourth and fifth time points before the bleaching process was close to zero in all cases. For experiments involving uPA, transfectants were incubated in RPMI media containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 100 nm uPA for 45 min at 37 °C (35Tang M.L. Kong L.S. Law S.K. Tan S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 348: 1184-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Thereafter, unbound uPA was removed by centrifuging cells through a heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum cushion. Cells were later spun onto poly-l-lysine slides and subjected to FRET analyses.Cell Adhesion Assays—Adhesion of K562 transfectants to human fibrinogen (Sigma) was performed as reported (35Tang M.L. Kong L.S. Law S.K. Tan S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 348: 1184-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, Polysorb microtiter well (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) was coated with fibrinogen (250 μg/ml) in 50 mm bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.2, overnight at 4 °C. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 0.2% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone (Mr 10,000) (Sigma) in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells labeled with 2′7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6) carboxyfluorescein (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were allowed to adhere to the fibrinogencoated wells. The activating KIM185 and function-blocking IB4 mAbs were used at 10 μg/ml each. The fluorescence signal of adherent cells was measured on a FL600 fluorescent plate reader (Bio-Tek instruments, Winooski, VT).Cell Surface Protein Biotinylation, Immunoprecipitation, and Detection—Labeling of cell surface proteins with biotin was performed as described previously (39Vararattanavech A. Tang M.L. Li H.Y. Wong C.H. Law S.K. Torres J. Tan S.M. Biochem. J. 2007; 410: 495-502Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). 293T transfectants were washed twice in PBS and incubated in PBS containing 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) for 15 min at room temperature. The labeling reaction was terminated by washing the cells in PBS containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. For reporter mAb immunoprecipitation analysis, the labeled cells were incubated in DMEM medium containing 5% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 10 mm HEPES (DMEM-FH) with the relevant mAb (3 μg each) in the presence or absence of 2 mm MnCl2 (referred to as Mn2+ in main text) for 30 min at 37 °C. The unbound mAbs were removed by washing the cells twice in the DMEM-FH and lysed in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet-P 40) with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min at 4 °C. Integrins bound to the mAbs were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). Precipitated proteins were resolved on 7.5% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA), and probed with streptavidin-conjugated HRP (GE Healthcare). Protein bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) using the ECL kit (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions.For the cross-linking study, transfectants were incubated in PBS containing 0.5 mg/ml cross-linker 3,3′-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate) (DTSSP) (Pierce) for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was quenched by washing cells in PBS containing 1 mm Tris, pH 7.5. Cells were incubated in DMEM-FH with 3 μg each of control mouse IgG or KIM185 for 30 min at 37 °C. Unbound antibodies were removed by washing cells twice in DMEM-FH. Cells were lysed, and bound mAbs were precipitated as described above. Precipitated proteins were resolved on 6% SDS-PAGE under nonreducing (-dithiothreitol (-DTT) conditions or on 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing (+DTT) conditions. The HA-uPAR cross-linked to αMβ2 was detected by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody. Protein bands were detected using HRP-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG followed by ECL.For examining integrins with cysteine-lock TMs, transfectants were labeled with sulfo-NHS-biotin as described above. Instead of using reporter mAbs, 3 μg of mAb IB4 was added to cell lysate and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C to immunoprecipitate the integrins. Thereafter, proteins were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose and resolved on 6% SDS-PAGE under either nonreducing conditions or on 7.5% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions followed by ECL detection aforementioned. For HA-uPAR coimmunoprecipitation analyses, transfectants were incubated in DMEM-FH with the relevant mAb (3 μg each) for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing in DMEM-FH, cells were lysed in lysis buffer. The HA-uPAR-integrin complex was precipitated as described above and resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. To detect HA-uPAR that co-precipitated with the integrins, blots were probed with anti-HA antibody followed by HRP-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG. Protein bands were visualized by ECL.For the detection of actin in cell lysates of transfectants, lysates were immunoblotted with mouse anti-actin antibody followed by HRP-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG. Protein bands were visualized by ECL.RESULTSInteraction with uPAR Induces the Movement of the αMβ2 Hybrid Domain—The association of uPAR with αMβ2 has been reported (14Bohuslav J. Horejsi V.

https://openalex.org/W2010955606,"ClC-Kb and ClC-Ka are homologous chloride channels that facilitate chloride homeostasis in the kidney and inner ear. Disruption of ClC-Kb leads to Bartter's Syndrome, a kidney disease. A point mutation in ClC-Kb, R538P, linked to Bartter's Syndrome and located in the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain was hypothesized to alter electrophysiological properties due to its proximity to an important membrane-embedded helix.Two-electrode voltage clamp experiments were used to examine the electrophysiological properties of the mutation R538P in both ClC-Kb and ClC-Ka. R538P selectively abolishes extracellular calcium activation of ClC-Kb but not ClC-Ka. In attempting to determine the reason for this specificity, we hypothesized that the ClC-Kb C-terminal domain had either a different oligomeric status or dimerization interface than that of ClC-Ka, for which a crystal structure has been published. We purified a recombinant protein corresponding to the ClC-Kb C-terminal domain and used multi-angle light scattering together with a cysteine-crosslinking approach to show that the dimerization interface is conserved between the ClC-Kb and ClC-Ka C-terminal domains, despite the fact that there are several differences in the amino acids that occur at this interface.The R538P mutation in ClC-Kb, which leads to Bartter's Syndrome, abolishes calcium activation of the channel. This suggests that a significant conformational change--ranging from the cytoplasmic side of the protein to the extracellular side of the protein--is involved in the Ca(2+)-activation process for ClC-Kb, and shows that the cytoplasmic domain is important for the channel's electrophysiological properties. In the highly similar ClC-Ka (90% identical), the R538P mutation does not affect activation by extracellular Ca(2+). This selective outcome indicates that ClC-Ka and ClC-Kb differ in how conformational changes are translated to the extracellular domain, despite the fact that the cytoplasmic domains share the same quaternary structure."
https://openalex.org/W2000207027,"Researchers use a variety of behavioral tasks to analyze the effect of biological manipulations on memory function. This research will benefit from a systematic mathematical method for analyzing memory demands in behavioral tasks. In the framework of reinforcement learning theory, these tasks can be mathematically described as partially-observable Markov decision processes. While a wealth of evidence collected over the past 15 years relates the basal ganglia to the reinforcement learning framework, only recently has much attention been paid to including psychological concepts such as working memory or episodic memory in these models. This paper presents an analysis that provides a quantitative description of memory states sufficient for correct choices at specific decision points. Using information from the mathematical structure of the task descriptions, we derive measures that indicate whether working memory (for one or more cues) or episodic memory can provide strategically useful information to an agent. In particular, the analysis determines which observed states must be maintained in or retrieved from memory to perform these specific tasks. We demonstrate the analysis on three simplified tasks as well as eight more complex memory tasks drawn from the animal and human literature (two alternation tasks, two sequence disambiguation tasks, two non-matching tasks, the 2-back task, and the 1-2-AX task). The results of these analyses agree with results from quantitative simulations of the task reported in previous publications and provide simple indications of the memory demands of the tasks which can require far less computation than a full simulation of the task. This may provide a basis for a quantitative behavioral stoichiometry of memory tasks."
