https://openalex.org/W4307233008,"Abstract A hallmark of nervous system aging is a decline of white matter volume and function, but the underlying mechanisms leading to white matter pathology are unknown. In the present study, we found age-related alterations of oligodendrocyte cell state with a reduction in total oligodendrocyte density in aging murine white matter. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing, we identified interferon (IFN)-responsive oligodendrocytes, which localize in proximity to CD8 + T cells in aging white matter. Absence of functional lymphocytes decreased the number of IFN-responsive oligodendrocytes and rescued oligodendrocyte loss, whereas T-cell checkpoint inhibition worsened the aging response. In addition, we identified a subpopulation of lymphocyte-dependent, IFN-responsive microglia in the vicinity of the CD8 + T cells in aging white matter. In summary, we provide evidence that CD8 + T-cell-induced, IFN-responsive oligodendrocytes and microglia are important modifiers of white matter aging."
https://openalex.org/W4307228554,"Abstract Nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and its sequelae are growing health problems. We performed a genome-wide association study of NAFL, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, and integrated the findings with expression and proteomic data. For NAFL, we utilized 9,491 clinical cases and proton density fat fraction extracted from 36,116 liver magnetic resonance images. We identified 18 sequence variants associated with NAFL and 4 with cirrhosis, and found rare, protective, predicted loss-of-function variants in MTARC1 and GPAM , underscoring them as potential drug targets. We leveraged messenger RNA expression, splicing and predicted coding effects to identify 16 putative causal genes, of which many are implicated in lipid metabolism. We analyzed levels of 4,907 plasma proteins in 35,559 Icelanders and 1,459 proteins in 47,151 UK Biobank participants, identifying multiple proteins involved in disease pathogenesis. We show that proteomics can discriminate between NAFL and cirrhosis. The present study provides insights into the development of noninvasive evaluation of NAFL and new therapeutic options."
https://openalex.org/W4307228548,"Ferredoxins comprise a large family of iron–sulfur (Fe–S) proteins that shuttle electrons in diverse biological processes. Human mitochondria contain two isoforms of [2Fe-2S] ferredoxins, FDX1 (aka adrenodoxin) and FDX2, with known functions in cytochrome P450-dependent steroid transformations and Fe–S protein biogenesis. Here, we show that only FDX2, but not FDX1, is involved in Fe–S protein maturation. Vice versa, FDX1 is specific not only for steroidogenesis, but also for heme a and lipoyl cofactor biosyntheses. In the latter pathway, FDX1 provides electrons to kickstart the radical chain reaction catalyzed by lipoyl synthase. We also identified lipoylation as a target of the toxic antitumor copper ionophore elesclomol. Finally, the striking target specificity of each ferredoxin was assigned to small conserved sequence motifs. Swapping these motifs changed the target specificity of these electron donors. Together, our findings identify new biochemical tasks of mitochondrial ferredoxins and provide structural insights into their functional specificity. Mitochondrial ferredoxins FDX1 and FDX2 are assigned to specifically donate electrons to steroidogenesis, Fe–S protein biogenesis, heme a formation or lipoylation. The proteins’ functions can be swapped by mutually exchanging short peptide segments."
https://openalex.org/W4307167589,"Decisions that favor one's own interest versus the interest of another individual depend on context and the relationships between individuals. The neurobiology underlying selfish choices or choices that benefit others is not understood. We developed a two-choice social decision-making task in which mice can decide whether to share a reward with their conspecifics. Preference for altruistic choices was modulated by familiarity, sex, social contact, hunger, hierarchical status and emotional state matching. Fiber photometry recordings and chemogenetic manipulations demonstrated that basolateral amygdala (BLA) neurons are involved in the establishment of prosocial decisions. In particular, BLA neurons projecting to the prelimbic (PL) region of the prefrontal cortex mediated the development of a preference for altruistic choices, whereas PL projections to the BLA modulated self-interest motives for decision-making. This provides a neurobiological model of altruistic and selfish choices with relevance to pathologies associated with dysfunctions in social decision-making."
https://openalex.org/W4307232193,"Polygenic scores (PGSs) combine the effects of common genetic variants1,2 to predict risk or treatment strategies for complex diseases3-7. Adding rare variation to PGSs has largely unknown benefits and is methodically challenging. Here, we developed a method for constructing rare variant PGSs and applied it to calculate genetically modified hemoglobin A1C thresholds for type 2 diabetes (T2D) diagnosis7-10. The resultant rare variant PGS is highly polygenic (21,293 variants across 154 genes), depends on ultra-rare variants (72.7% observed in fewer than three people) and identifies significantly more undiagnosed T2D cases than expected by chance (odds ratio = 2.71; P = 1.51 × 10-6). A PGS combining common and rare variants is expected to identify 4.9 million misdiagnosed T2D cases in the United States-nearly 1.5-fold more than the common variant PGS alone. These results provide a method for constructing complex trait PGSs from rare variants and suggest that rare variants will augment common variants in precision medicine approaches for common disease."
https://openalex.org/W4307657653,"Abstract The canonical paradigm for converting genetic association to mechanism involves iteratively mapping individual associations to the proximal genes through which they act. In contrast, in the present study we demonstrate the feasibility of extracting biological insights from a very large region of the genome and leverage this strategy to study the genetic influences on autism. Using a new statistical approach, we identified the 33-Mb p-arm of chromosome 16 (16p) as harboring the greatest excess of autism’s common polygenic influences. The region also includes the mechanistically cryptic and autism-associated 16p11.2 copy number variant. Analysis of RNA-sequencing data revealed that both the common polygenic influences within 16p and the 16p11.2 deletion were associated with decreased average gene expression across 16p. The transcriptional effects of the rare deletion and diffuse common variation were correlated at the level of individual genes and analysis of Hi-C data revealed patterns of chromatin contact that may explain this transcriptional convergence. These results reflect a new approach for extracting biological insight from genetic association data and suggest convergence of common and rare genetic influences on autism at 16p."
https://openalex.org/W4307216470,"To understand patient experience of federal regulatory changes governing methadone and buprenorphine (MOUD) access in Arizona during the COVID-19 pandemic.This community-based participatory and action research study involved one-hour, audio-recorded field interviews conducted with 131 people who used methadone and/or buprenorphine to address opioid use disorder at some point during COVID (January 1, 2020- March 31, 2021) in Arizona. Transcribed data were analyzed using a priori codes focused on federally recommended flexibilities governing MOUD access. Data were quantitated to investigate associations with COVID risk and services access.Telehealth was reported by 71.0% of participants, but the majority were required to come to the clinic to attend video appointments with an offsite provider. Risk for severe COVID outcomes was reported by 40.5% of the sample. Thirty-eight percent of the sample and 39.7% of methadone patients were required to be at the clinic daily to get medication and 47.6% were at high risk for COVID severe outcomes. About half (54.2%) of methadone patients indicated that some form of multi-day take home dosing was offered at their clinic, and 45.8% were offered an extra day or two of multi-day doses; but no participants received the federally allowed 14- or 28-day methadone take-home doses for unstable and stable patients respectively. All participants expressed that daily clinic visits interrupted their work and home lives and desired more take-home dosing and home delivery options.MOUD patients in Arizona were not offered many of the federally allowed flexibilities for access that were designed to reduce their need to be at the clinic. To understand the impact of these recommended treatment changes in Arizona, and other states where they were not well implemented, federal and state regulators must mandate these changes and support MOUD providers to implement them."

We aimed to describe the spatial and temporal distribution of acquired syphilis (AS), in pregnancy (SP) and congenital syphilis (CS) in Brazilian municipalities in the arches border contexts. Methods An ecological, cross-sectional study was conducted from 2010 to 2020. The study was based on the cases of syphilis available in the Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN), and on the Primary Health Care Information System. The detection rates of AS and SP, and the incidence of CS were estimated, and the time series was analyzed. Data between the border arches were compared. Results In 2020, data showed 7,603 cases of AS (detection rate 64.8/100,000 inhabitants), 3,960 cases of SP (detection rate of 21.6/1,000 live births) and 836 cases of CS (incidence of 4.6/1,000 live births) in the border region. Between 2010 and 2020, the mean annual increase of detection rate of SP was 53.4% in Brazil, 48.0% in the border region, 59.6% in the North Arch, 28.8% in the Central and 67.2% in the South. Annual variation on the incidence of CS for the same period was 31.0% in Brazil 38.4% at the border, in the North and South Arcs 18.3% and 65.7% respectively. The Central Arch showed an increase only between 2010 and 2018 (62.7%). A total of 427 (72.6%) municipalities has primary health care coverage ≥ 95% of the population. In 2019, 538 (91.8%) municipalities reported using rapid tests for syphilis, which decreased to 492 (84%) in 2020. In 2019, 441 (75.3%) municipalities reported administering penicillin, and 422 (72%) in 2020. Conclusion Our data show syphilis reman problem at the Brazilian border, rates in pregnant are high. It was observed a reduction in the detection rates, SP and the incidence of CS between 2018 and 2020. Syphilis should be included on the agenda of all management levels, aiming at expanding access and quality care."
https://openalex.org/W4307240316,"The aim of the current paper is to summarize the results of the International CytoSorb Registry. Data were collected on patients of the intensive care unit. The primary endpoint was actual in-hospital mortality compared to the mortality predicted by APACHE II score. The main secondary endpoints were SOFA scores, inflammatory biomarkers and overall evaluation of the general condition. 1434 patients were enrolled. Indications for hemoadsorption were sepsis/septic shock (N = 936); cardiac surgery perioperatively (N = 172); cardiac surgery postoperatively (N = 67) and “other” reasons (N = 259). APACHE-II-predicted mortality was 62.0±24.8%, whereas observed hospital mortality was 50.1%. Overall SOFA scores did not change but cardiovascular and pulmonary SOFA scores decreased by 0.4 [-0.5;-0.3] and -0.2 [-0.3;-0.2] points, respectively. Serum procalcitonin and C-reactive protein levels showed significant reduction: -15.4 [-19.6;-11.17] ng/mL; -17,52 [-70;44] mg/L, respectively. In the septic cohort PCT and IL-6 also showed significant reduction: -18.2 [-23.6;-12.8] ng/mL; -2.6 [-3.0;-2.2] pg/mL, respectively. Evaluation of the overall effect: minimal improvement (22%), much improvement (22%) and very much improvement (10%), no change observed (30%) and deterioration (4%). There was no significant difference in the primary outcome of mortality, but there were improvements in cardiovascular and pulmonary SOFA scores and a reduction in PCT, CRP and IL-6 levels.

https://openalex.org/W4307171274,"Lens culinaris is a proteinaceous food crop that is consumed worldwide for protein requirements. Mutation breeding has been used to improve protein content, yield, and related traits, as well as to select highly desirable mutants that are economically significant. An investigation of genotypic variation in lentil germplasm was carried out using induced mutagenesis, with caffeine, ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS), lead nitrate, and cadmium nitrate as mutagens that resulted in 18 mutant lines in the M3 generation. For the present study, we analyzed the genetic diversity of lentil mutant lines using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and random amplified polymorphic DNA markers (RAPD). The heterozygosity of RAPD markers per primer ranged from 50.00-90.90% with an average of 71.04%. The genetic divergent analysis was performed using hierarchical clustering (UPGMA), exhibited that these mutant lines were classified mainly into five subpopulation or clusters. A close resemblance with highest genetic coefficient similarity (1.00) were observed between control and mutant H; between mutant M and E; between mutant Q and J2, while more divergent mutants were N2 with mutant B; and mutant R with mutant J1with least genetic coefficient similarity (0.22). Protein and mineral content (Fe, Zn and Cu) were increased significantly in some high yielding mutant lines concerning to the control plant, and showed polymorphic variations in polypeptide chains in terms of banding pattern. Stomatal morphology in high yielding mutants were perceived utilizing scanning electron microscopy (SEM), exhibiting variations in stomatal size, stomatal opening and number of stomata. The present study's promising mutant lines' biological, physiological, and molecular profiles provide a foundation for forthcoming preservation and consumption strategies to broaden the genetic diversity of the breeding population of lentil."
https://openalex.org/W4307171284,"Drug-target protein interaction (DTI) identification is fundamental for drug discovery and drug repositioning, because therapeutic drugs act on disease-causing proteins. However, the DTI identification process often requires expensive and time-consuming tasks, including biological experiments involving large numbers of candidate compounds. Thus, a variety of computation approaches have been developed. Of the many approaches available, chemo-genomics feature-based methods have attracted considerable attention. These methods compute the feature descriptors of drugs and proteins as the input data to train machine and deep learning models to enable accurate prediction of unknown DTIs. In addition, attention-based learning methods have been proposed to identify and interpret DTI mechanisms. However, improvements are needed for enhancing prediction performance and DTI mechanism elucidation. To address these problems, we developed an attention-based method designated the interpretable cross-attention network (ICAN), which predicts DTIs using the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System of drugs and amino acid sequences of target proteins. We optimized the attention mechanism architecture by exploring the cross-attention or self-attention, attention layer depth, and selection of the context matrixes from the attention mechanism. We found that a plain attention mechanism that decodes drug-related protein context features without any protein-related drug context features effectively achieved high performance. The ICAN outperformed state-of-the-art methods in several metrics on the DAVIS dataset and first revealed with statistical significance that some weighted sites in the cross-attention weight matrix represent experimental binding sites, thus demonstrating the high interpretability of the results. The program is freely available at https://github.com/kuratahiroyuki/ICAN."
https://openalex.org/W4307171408,"This paper proposes a compartment model (SVEIHRM model) based on a system of ordinary differential equations to simulate the pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).Emergence of mutant viruses gave rise to multiple peaks in the number of confirmed cases. Vaccine developers and WHO suggest individuals to receive multiple vaccinations (the primary and the secondary vaccinations and booster shots) to mitigate transmission of COVID-19. Taking this into account, we include compartments for multiple vaccinations and mutant viruses of COVID-19 in the model. In particular, our model considers breakthrough infection according to the antibody formation rate following multiple vaccinations. We obtain the effective reproduction numbers of the original virus, the Delta, and the Omicron variants by fitting this model to data in Korea. Additionally, we provide various simulations adjusting the daily vaccination rate and the timing of vaccination to investigate the effects of these two vaccine-related measures on the number of infected individuals. We also show that starting vaccinations early is the key to reduce the number of infected individuals. Delaying the start date requires increasing substantially the rate of vaccination to achieve similar target results. In the sensitivity analysis on the vaccination rate of Korean data, it is shown that a 10% increase (decrease) in vaccination rates can reduce (increase) the number of confirmed cases by 35.22% (82.82%), respectively."
https://openalex.org/W4307229092,"Glutamine synthetase (GS) activity is conserved from prokaryotes to humans, where the ATP-dependent production of glutamine from glutamate and ammonia is essential for neurotransmission and ammonia detoxification. Here, we show that mammalian GS uses glutamate and methylamine to produce a methylated glutamine analog, N5-methylglutamine. Untargeted metabolomics revealed that liver-specific GS deletion and its pharmacological inhibition in mice suppress hepatic and circulating levels of N5-methylglutamine. This alternative activity of GS was confirmed in human recombinant enzyme and cells, where a pathogenic mutation in the active site (R324C) promoted the synthesis of N5-methylglutamine over glutamine. N5-methylglutamine is detected in the circulation, and its levels are sustained by the microbiome, as demonstrated by using germ-free mice. Finally, we show that urine levels of N5-methylglutamine correlate with tumor burden and GS expression in a β-catenin-driven model of liver cancer, highlighting the translational potential of this uncharacterized metabolite."

https://openalex.org/W4307171295,"Ranked set sampling (RSS) has created a broad interest among researchers and it is still a unique research topic. It has at long last begun to find its way into practical applications beyond its initial horticultural based birth in the fundamental paper by McIntyre in the nineteenth century. One of the extensions of RSS is median ranked set sampling (MRSS). MRSS is a sampling procedure normally utilized when measuring the variable of interest is troublesome or expensive, whereas it might be easy to rank the units using an inexpensive sorting criterion. Several researchers introduced ratio, regression, exponential, and difference type estimators for mean estimation under the MRSS design. In this paper, we propose three new mean estimators under the MRSS scheme. Our idea is based on three-fold utilization of supplementary information. Specifically, we utilize the ranks and second raw moments of the supplementary information and the original values of the supplementary variable. The appropriateness of the proposed group of estimators is demonstrated in light of both real and artificial data sets based on the Monte-Carlo simulation. Additionally, the performance comparison is also conducted regarding the reviewed families of estimators. The results are empowered and the predominant execution of the proposed group of estimators is seen throughout the paper."
https://openalex.org/W4307240053,"The characterization of ancient DNA in fossil bones is providing invaluable information on the genetics of past human and other animal populations. These studies have been aided enormously by the discovery that ancient DNA is relatively well preserved in the petrous bone compared to most other bones. The reasons for this better preservation are however not well understood. Here we examine the hypothesis that one reason for better DNA preservation in the petrous bone is that fresh petrous bone contains more DNA than other bones. We therefore determined the concentrations of osteocyte cells occluded inside lacunae within the petrous bone and compared these concentrations to other bones from the domestic pig using high resolution microCT. We show that the concentrations of osteocyte lacunae in the inner layer of the pig petrous bone adjacent to the otic chamber are about three times higher (around 95,000 lacunae per mm 3 ) than in the mastoid of the temporal bone (around 28,000 lacunae per mm 3 ), as well as the cortical bone of the femur (around 27,000 lacunae per mm 3 ). The sizes and shapes of the lacuna in the inner layer of the petrous bone are similar to those in the femur. We also show that the pig petrous bone lacunae do contain osteocytes using a histological stain for DNA. We therefore confirm and significantly expand upon previous observations of osteocytic lacuna concentrations in the petrous bone, supporting the notion that one possible reason for better preservation of ancient DNA in the petrous bone is that this bone initially contains at least three times more DNA than other bones. Thus during diagenesis more DNA is likely to be preserved in the petrous bone compared to other bones."
https://openalex.org/W4307240449,"The use of high-throughput sequencing to recover short DNA reads of many species has been widely applied on biodiversity studies, either as amplicon metabarcoding or shotgun metagenomics. These reads are assigned to taxa using classifiers. However, for different reasons, the results often contain many false positives. Here we focus on the reduction of false positive species attributable to the classifiers. We benchmarked two popular classifiers, BLASTn followed by MEGAN6 (BM) and Kraken2 (K2), to analyse shotgun sequenced artificial single-species samples of insects. To reduce the number of misclassified reads, we combined the output of the two classifiers in two different ways: (1) by keeping only the reads that were attributed to the same species by both classifiers (intersection approach); and (2) by keeping the reads assigned to some species by any classifier (union approach). In addition, we applied an analytical detection limit to further reduce the number of false positives species. As expected, both metagenomic classifiers used with default parameters generated an unacceptably high number of misidentified species (tens with BM, hundreds with K2). The false positive species were not necessarily phylogenetically close, as some of them belonged to different orders of insects. The union approach failed to reduce the number of false positives, but the intersection approach got rid of most of them. The addition of an analytic detection limit of 0.001 further reduced the number to ca . 0.5 false positive species per sample. The misidentification of species by most classifiers hampers the confidence of the DNA-based methods for assessing the biodiversity of biological samples. Our approach to alleviate the problem is straightforward and significantly reduced the number of reported false positive species."

Work and workplaces have the potential to influence these outcomes given their ability to amplify minority stress, and their ability to influence social and economic wellbeing in this already marginalized population. This study aims to identify how sociodemographic characteristics and characteristics of work, including degree of precarity, industry and perceived workplace support for LGBTQ people, influence self-reported mental health among LGBTQ people in two Canadian cities.Self-identified LGBTQ workers ≥16 years of age (n = 531) in Sudbury and Windsor, Ontario, Canada were given an online survey between July 6 and December 2, 2018. Multivariate ordinal logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) to evaluate differences in gender identity, age, income, industry, social precarity, work environment, and substance use among workers who self-reported very poor, poor, or neutral mental health, compared with a referent group that self-reported good or very good mental health on a five-point Likert scale about general mental health.LGBTQ workers with poor or neutral mental health had greater odds of: being cisgender women or trans compared with being cisgender men; being aged <35 years compared with ≥35 years; working in low-wage service sectors compared with blue collar jobs; earning <$20,000/year compared with ≥$20,000/year; working in a non-standard work situation or being unemployed compared with working in full-time permanent employment; feeling often or always unable to schedule time with friends due to work; feeling unsure or negative about their work environment; and using substances to cope with work.Both precarious work and unsupportive work environments contribute to poor mental health among LGBTQ people. These factors are compounded for trans workers who face poorer mental health than cis-LGBQ workers in similar environments."
https://openalex.org/W4307171288,"Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a method for solving blind source separation problems. Because ICA only needs weak assumptions to estimate the unknown sources from only the observed signals, it is suitable for Electroencephalography (EEG) analysis. A serious disadvantage of the traditional ICA algorithms is that their results often fluctuate and do not converge to the unique and globally optimal solution at each run. It is because there are many local optima and permutation ambiguities. We have recently proposed a new ICA algorithm named the ordering ICA, a simple extension of Fast ICA. The ordering ICA is theoretically guaranteed to extract the independent components in the unique order and avoids the local optima in practice. This paper investigated the usefulness of the ordering ICA in EEG analysis. Experiments showed that the ordering ICA could give unique solutions for the signals with large non-Gaussianity, and the ease of parallelization could reduce computation time."

Although various studies and reviews have described sex differences in infectious diseases of humans, wildlife and laboratory animals, there has been little focus on biological sex as a risk factor for infectious and parasitic diseases of domestic animals. We aim to identify and synthesise evidence in dogs for the hypothesis that biological sex and gonadectomy status are determinants of occurrence and severity of disease across taxa of pathogens. This systematic review follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We will search Web of Science, Scopus and PubMed for peer-reviewed studies published in English from database inception through 2021. All study designs for infectious and parasitic diseases of dogs will be included. This review will include the outcomes prevalence or incidence of infection or disease; and severity of disease as measured by case-fatality, time to death or recovery, hospitalisation time, pathogen burden (e.g. viral load or parasitaemia) or relevant clinicopathological parameters. Two reviewers will jointly assess the first 500 records from all three databases. Subsequently, one reviewer will screen the remaining records, and then the second reviewer will verify all records excluded by the first reviewer. Full-texts of all included records will be retrieved and assessed for eligibility by the first review author, and then the second author will review those records excluded by the first author. The risk of bias in individual studies will be assessed using the Risk of Bias Assessment tool for Nonrandomized Studies. We will synthesise the information from the studies and present this as a narrative in the text. The findings will be presented by outcome type and also grouped by pathogen type. Evidence on sex-specific effects will expand our understanding of infectious disease pathogenesis and underlying mechanisms, and this may be of importance in implementation of disease control interventions."
https://openalex.org/W4307216180,"The reliable identification of the irritative zone (IZ) is a prerequisite for the correct clinical evaluation of medically refractory patients affected by epilepsy. Given the complexity of MEG data, visual analysis of epileptiform neurophysiological activity is highly time consuming and might leave clinically relevant information undetected. We recorded and analyzed the interictal activity from seven patients affected by epilepsy (Vectorview Neuromag), who successfully underwent epilepsy surgery (Engel > = II). We visually marked and localized characteristic epileptiform activity (VIS). We implemented a two-stage pipeline for the detection of interictal spikes and the delineation of the IZ. First, we detected candidate events from peaky ICA components, and then clustered events around spatio-temporal patterns identified by convolutional sparse coding. We used the average of clustered events to create IZ maps computed at the amplitude peak (PEAK), and at the 50% of the peak ascending slope (SLOPE). We validated our approach by computing the distance of the estimated IZ (VIS, SLOPE and PEAK) from the border of the surgically resected area (RA). We identified 25 spatiotemporal patterns mimicking the underlying interictal activity (3.6 clusters/patient). Each cluster was populated on average by 22.1 [15.0-31.0] spikes. The predicted IZ maps had an average distance from the resection margin of 8.4 ± 9.3 mm for visual analysis, 12.0 ± 16.5 mm for SLOPE and 22.7 ±. 16.4 mm for PEAK. The consideration of the source spread at the ascending slope provided an IZ closer to RA and resembled the analysis of an expert observer. We validated here the performance of a data-driven approach for the automated detection of interictal spikes and delineation of the IZ. This computational framework provides the basis for reproducible and bias-free analysis of MEG recordings in epilepsy."

The aim of the study was to evaluate the patient-related outcomes of a community pharmacy Minor Ailment Service (MAS) compared to usual pharmacist care (UC).A cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted over six months in community pharmacy in the province of Valencia (Spain). Patients seeking care or requesting a product for a minor ailments considered in the study (dermatological problems, gastrointestinal disturbance, pain and upper respiratory tract related symptoms) were included. The intervention consisted of a standardised pharmacist-patient consultation guided by a web-based program using co-developed management protocols and patients' educational material. Patients were followed up by phone ten days later. Primary clinical outcomes were appropriate medical referral and modification of direct product request. Secondary outcomes were symptom resolution and reconsultation rates.A total of 808 patients (323 MAS and 485 UC) were recruited in 27 pharmacies of 21 municipalities. Patients visiting MAS pharmacies had higher odds for being referred to a physician (OR = 2.343, CI95% = [1.146-4.792]) and higher reconsultation rates (OR = 1.833, CI95% = [1.151-2.919]) compared to UC. No significant differences between groups were observed for modification of direct product request and symptom resolution.The use of management protocols through the MAS strengthened the identification of referral criteria such as red flags in patients suffering minor ailments.

https://openalex.org/W4307216432,"Tuberculosis is one of the top ten causes of death globally and the leading cause of death from a single infectious agent. Eradicating the Tuberculosis epidemic by 2030 is one of the top United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Early diagnosis is essential to achieving this goal because it improves individual prognosis and reduces transmission rates of asymptomatic infected. We aim to support this goal by developing rapid and sensitive diagnostics using machine learning algorithms to minimize the need for expert intervention.A single molecule fluorescence immunosorbent assay was used to detect Tuberculosis biomarker lipoarabinomannan from a set of twenty clinical patient samples and a control set of spiked human urine. Tuberculosis status was separately confirmed by GeneXpert MTB/RIF and cell culture. Two machine learning algorithms, an automatic and a semiautomatic model, were developed and trained by the calibrated lipoarabinomannan titration assay data and then tested against the ground truth patient data. The semiautomatic model differed from the automatic model by an expert review step in the former, which calibrated the lower threshold to determine single molecules from background noise. The semiautomatic model was found to provide 88.89% clinical sensitivity, while the automatic model resulted in 77.78% clinical sensitivity.The semiautomatic model outperformed the automatic model in clinical sensitivity as a result of the expert intervention applied during calibration and both models vastly outperformed manual expert counting in terms of time-to-detection and completion of analysis. Meanwhile, the clinical sensitivity of the automatic model could be improved significantly with a larger training dataset. In short, semiautomatic, and automatic Gaussian Mixture Models have a place in supporting rapid detection of Tuberculosis in resource-limited settings without sacrificing clinical sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W4307216467,"Bangladesh has failed to meet the United Nations goal for reducing maternal mortality in the last decade. The high prevalence of unskilled birth attendant (UBA) delivery (47%) has resulted in negative consequences for the health of mothers and newborn babies in the country. Spatial variations in UBA delivery and its predictors are yet to be explored in Bangladesh, which could be very helpful in formulating cost-effective policies for reducing that. This study examines the spatial variations in UBA delivery and its predictors in Bangladesh.This study analyzed the characteristics of 672 clusters extracted from the 2017/18 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey, and healthcare facility data from the 2017 Bangladesh Health Facility Survey. These data were analyzed using descriptive and spatial analyses (hot spot analysis, Ordinary Least Squares Regression, and Geographically Weighted Regression) techniques.Statistically significant hot spots of UBA delivery were concentrated in parts of the Mymensingh, Sylhet, Barishal, and Rangpur regions, while Khulna was the safest region. Predictive strengths of the statistically significant predictors of spatial variation in UBA delivery were observed to vary considerably across the regions. Poorest household wealth status and less than four antenatal care contacts emerged as strong predictors of UBA delivery in all the aforementioned hot spot-stricken regions, except Barisal. Additionally, primiparity and all secondary education or higher were strong predictors of lower UBA delivery rates in Mymensingh and Sylhet, while poorer household wealth status was also a strong predictor of UBA delivery in Sylhet. Multiparity was an additional strong predictor of UBA delivery in Rangpur. In Barisal, only poorer household wealth status exerted a strong positive influence on UBA delivery.The remarkable spatial variations in UBA delivery and its predictors' strengths indicate that geographically-targeted interventions could be a cost-effective method for reducing the UBA delivery prevalence in Bangladesh, thereby improve maternal and child health."

https://openalex.org/W4307239986,"Previous research has indicated that neural crosstalk is asymmetric, with the dominant effector exerting a stronger influence on the non-dominant effector than vice versa. Recently, it has been hypothesized that this influence is more substantial for proximal than distal effectors. The current investigation was designed to determine the effects of distal ((First Dorsal Interosseous (FDI)) and proximal (triceps brachii (TBI)) muscle activation on neural crosstalk. Twelve right-limb dominant participants (mean age = 21.9) were required to rhythmically coordinate a 1:2 pattern of isometric force guided by Lissajous displays. Participants performed 10, 30 s trials with both distal and proximal effectors. Coherence between the two effector groups were calculated using EMG-EMG wavelet coherence. The results indicated that participants could effectively coordinate the goal coordination pattern regardless of the effectors used. However, spatiotemporal performance was more accurate when performing the task with distal than proximal effectors. Force distortion, quantified by harmonicity, indicated that more perturbations occurred in the non-dominant effector than in the dominant effector. The results also indicated significantly lower harmonicity for the non-dominant proximal effector compared to the distal effectors. The current results support the notion that neural crosstalk is asymmetric in nature and is greater for proximal than distal effectors. Additionally, the EMG-EMG coherence results indicated significant neural crosstalk was occurring in the Alpha bands (5-13 Hz), with higher values observed in the proximal condition. Significant coherence in the Alpha bands suggest that the influence of neural crosstalk is occurring at a subcortical level."
https://openalex.org/W4307240055,"Over 71 million people are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) worldwide, and approximately 400,000 global deaths result from complications of untreated chronic HCV. Pan-genomic direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) have recently become widely available and feature high cure rates in less than 12 weeks of treatment. The rollout of DAAs is reliant on diagnostic tests for HCV RNA to identify eligible patients with viremic HCV infections. Current PCR-based HCV RNA assays are restricted to well-resourced central laboratories, and there remains a prevailing clinical need for expanded access to decentralized HCV RNA testing to provide rapid chronic HCV diagnosis and linkage to DAAs in outpatient clinics. This paper reports a rapid, highly accurate, and minimally instrumented assay for HCV RNA detection using reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA). The assay detects all HCV genotypes with a limit of detection of 25 copies per reaction for genotype 1, the most prevalent in the United States and worldwide. The clinical sensitivity and specificity of the RT-RPA assay were both 100% when evaluated using 78 diverse clinical serum specimens. The accuracy, short runtime, and low heating demands of RT-RPA may enable implementation in a point-of-care HCV test to expand global access to effective treatment via rapid chronic HCV diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W4307240439,"The outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treatment have improved due to vaccination and the establishment of better treatment regimens. However, the emergence of variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, and the corresponding changes in the characteristics of the disease present new challenges in patient management. This study aimed to analyze predictors of COVID-19 severity caused by the delta and omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2.We retrospectively analyzed the data of patients who were admitted for COVID-19 at Yokohama City University Hospital from August 2021 to March 2022.A total of 141 patients were included in this study. Of these, 91 had moderate COVID-19, whereas 50 had severe COVID-19. There were significant differences in sex, vaccination status, dyspnea, sore throat symptoms, and body mass index (BMI) (p <0.0001, p <0.001, p <0.001, p = 0.02, p< 0.0001, respectively) between the moderate and severe COVID-19 groups. Regarding comorbidities, smoking habit and renal dysfunction were significantly different between the two groups (p = 0.007 and p = 0.01, respectively). Regarding laboratory data, only LDH level on the first day of hospitalization was significantly different between the two groups (p<0.001). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that time from the onset of COVID-19 to hospitalization, BMI, smoking habit, and LDH level were significantly different between the two groups (p<0.03, p = 0.039, p = 0.008, p<0.001, respectively). The cut-off value for the time from onset of COVID-19 to hospitalization was four days (sensitivity, 0.73; specificity, 0.70).Time from the onset of COVID-19 to hospitalization is the most important factor in the prevention of the aggravation of COVID-19 caused by the delta and omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants. Appropriate medical management within four days after the onset of COVID-19 is essential for preventing the progression of COVID-19, especially in patients with smoking habits."
https://openalex.org/W4307171430,"Resource allocation problem is one of key issues in the field of revenue management. The traditional models usually rely on some restrictive assumptions about demand information or arrival process, which is sometimes out of line with reality. To overcome this shortcoming, the method of competitive analysis of online algorithms, which eliminates the need for the assumptions on demand and arrivals, is adopted to deal with the quantity-based revenue management problem. The current model in this paper considers two downgrade compatible levels of resources. Given the capacities and fares of both levels of resources, the objective is to accept appropriate customers and assign them to appropriate resources so as to maximize revenues. Compared with the existing literature, this paper generalizes the concerned resource allocation problem by considering multiple fares for each level of resources. From the perspective of online algorithms and competitive analysis, both an upper bound and an optimal online strategy are derived in this paper."

Farmers who suffered drift-related losses in crop yield had to seek recovery in state courts. However, state courts varied in their approaches to drift lawsuits and remedies, if awarded, could include damage awards or injunctions. To demonstrate the need for a more transparent judicial process, this paper identifies three torts commonly advanced as causes of actions in drift cases and creates theoretic-game models to evaluate each tort's impact on farmers' decision-making and economic outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4307188431,"Prior research suggests that disruptive events, such as shocks induced by family instability, neighborhood violence, or relocation, tend to be detrimental for children’s educational outcomes, but findings are heterogeneous depending on the type of event. Limited evidence is available on how shocks resulting from immigration enforcement impact educational outcomes among targeted minority groups. This study contributes to the literature by assessing how a policy implementation in the US–Secure Communities–is related to the school district level achievement of Hispanic students. The Secure Communities program is a national level immigration enforcement policy that was rolled out on a county-by-county basis. The program has increased the risk of deportation and led to rising apprehension and insecurity among undocumented migrants and the wider Hispanic community. Using detailed information on the implementation of Secure Communities, data from the Stanford Education Data Archive, and the Current Population Survey, this study estimates dynamic difference in differences exploiting regional variation in the timing of the policy change to assess its impact on educational outcomes. Results show that the activation of Secure Communities is negatively associated with Hispanic students’ subsequent English language arts achievement, while white and black students’ achievement does not change. Findings further suggest that Hispanic students living in the South, rural areas, and areas with high proportions of likely undocumented migrants are disproportionately impacted by the program’s activation. Whereas, Hispanic students in sanctuary jurisdictions, which reduce the likelihood of deportation, are not impacted. These findings indicate that immigration enforcement can have negative consequences for educational and social inequalities in the United States."
https://openalex.org/W4307188491,"Grief is a normal psychological response in relatives after the loss of their loved ones, which has shown to be associated with psychological reactions like depression, anxiety, and significant stress that many relatives have to cope with. In Thailand, there are limited research studies on grief, especially in palliative settings. This study aims to examine grief reaction, depression, anxiety, and coping of relatives after palliative patients' death.A multi-method design was applied. The authors completed the demographic data questionnaire, and the participants finished other measures which included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Inventory of Complicated Grief (ICG), and the Brief-Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (Brief-COPE). The qualitative data from the focus group interview was analyzed with thematic analysis.From the quantitative study, the mean scores of HADS for anxiety and depression subscales were 5.05 and 6.34, respectively, which indicated no anxiety and depressive disorders. The mean score of ICG was 19.51 with highest score on acceptance coping subscale. In contrast, the lowest score was on dealing with the substance subscale. There were significant correlations between anxiety subscale from HADS and ICG (r = 0.73), depression subscale from HADS and ICG(r = 0.85), and anxiety and depression subscale from the HADS (r = 0.79). From the qualitative study, the factors associated with grief reaction could be thoroughly explained according to the perceived character of deceased, perceived character of relatives, relationship characteristics, disease, medical care, and support systems.The correlations among grief reaction, depression, and anxiety of relatives after palliative patients' death were high. The grief reaction was associated with many factors, including communication from medical personnel. This finding emphasized the importance of assessing the reactions after loss and associated factors in the relatives after palliative patients' death. Also, evaluating the ways that the relatives use to cope with their loss, expressing empathy, and supporting the relatives to cope with loss in an adaptive way were recommended."
https://openalex.org/W4307188497,"Background Genetic variants in apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1), a protein that protects humans from infection with African trypanosomes, explain a substantial proportion of the excess risk of chronic kidney disease affecting individuals with sub-Saharan ancestry. The mechanisms by which risk variants damage kidney cells remain incompletely understood. In preclinical models, APOL1 expressed in podocytes can lead to significant kidney injury. In humans, studies in kidney transplant suggest that the effects of APOL1 variants are predominantly driven by donor genotype. Less attention has been paid to a possible role for circulating APOL1 in kidney injury. Methods Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, the concentrations of APOL1 were measured in plasma and urine from participants in the Seattle Kidney Study. Asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation was used to evaluate the size of APOL1-containing lipoprotein particles in plasma. Transgenic mice that express wild-type or risk variant APOL1 from an albumin promoter were treated to cause kidney injury and evaluated for renal disease and pathology. Results In human participants, urine concentrations of APOL1 were correlated with plasma concentrations and reduced kidney function. Risk variant APOL1 was enriched in larger particles. In mice, circulating risk variant APOL1-G1 promoted kidney damage and reduced podocyte density without renal expression of APOL1. Conclusions These results suggest that plasma APOL1 is dynamic and contributes to the progression of kidney disease in humans, which may have implications for treatment of APOL1-associated kidney disease and for kidney transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W4307188504,"The transient electromagnetic method (TEM) is widely applied in coal hydrogeological exploration owing to its sensitivity to low-resistivity bodies. However, when a coal seam is buried deep, particularly if there are multiple electrical layers in the vertical direction of the overlying stratum, the results of the calculation using the late-channel empirical formula of the TEM may no longer reflect the actual situation. In this study, we evaluated the principle of the one-dimensional (1D) Occam algorithm and the steps for performing an inversion. We proposed various two-, three-, and four-layer electrical models for inversion using the 1D Occam algorithm. Our results are consistent with the electrical distribution of the models, thus indicating the effectiveness of the algorithm. A test project of large-depth transient electromagnetic exploration in the Datong Coalfield in Shanxi, China, was selected for experimental verification. The 1D Occam inversion was used to successfully identify various electrical strata overlying the coal seam."
https://openalex.org/W4307188505,"To study neoplasia in tissue culture, cell lines representing the evolution of normal cells to tumor cells are needed. To produce such cells, we developed the AGMK1-9T7 cell line, established cell banks at 10-passage intervals, and characterized their biological properties. Here we examine the evolution of chromosomal DNA copy-number aberrations and miRNA expression in this cell line from passage 1 to the acquisition of a tumorigenic phenotype at passage 40. We demonstrated the use of a human microarray platform for DNA copy-number profiling of AGMK1-9T7 cells using knowledge of synteny to ‘recode’ data from human chromosome coordinates to those of the African green monkey. This approach revealed the accumulation of DNA copy-number gains and losses in AGMK1-9T7 cells from passage 3 to passage 40, which spans the period in which neoplastic transformation occurred. These alterations occurred in the sequences of genes regulating DNA copy-number imbalance of several genes that regulate endothelial cell angiogenesis, survival, migration, and proliferation. Regarding miRNA expression, 195 miRNAs were up- or down-regulated at passage 1 at levels that appear to be biologically relevant (i.e., log2 fold change &gt;2.0 (q&lt;0.05)). At passage 10, the number of up/down-regulated miRNAs fell to 63; this number increased to 93 at passage 40. Principal-component analysis grouped these miRNAs into 3 clusters; miRNAs in sub-clusters of these groups could be correlated with initiation, promotion, and progression, stages that have been described for neoplastic development. Thirty-four of the AGMK1-9T7 miRNAs have been associated with these stages in human cancer. Based on these data, we propose that the evolution of AGMK1-9T7 cells represents a detailed model of neoplasia in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W4307216074,"OnkoNetwork is a patient navigation program established in the Moritz Kaposi General Hospital to improve the timeliness and completeness of cancer investigations and treatment. The H2020 SELFIE consortium selected OnkoNetwork as a promising integrated care initiative in Hungary and conducted a multicriteria decision analysis based on health, patient experience, and cost outcomes. In this paper, a more detailed analysis of clinical impacts is provided in the largest subgroup, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. A retrospective cohort study was conducted, enrolling new cancer suspect patients with subsequently confirmed NSCLC in two annual periods, before and after OnkoNetwork implementation (control and intervention cohorts, respectively). To control for selection bias and confounding, baseline balance was improved via propensity score weighting. Overall survival was analyzed in univariate and multivariate weighted Cox regression models and the effect was further characterized in a counterfactual analysis. Our analysis included 123 intervention and 173 control NSCLC patients from early to advanced stage, with significant between-cohort baseline differences. The propensity score-based weighting resulted in good baseline balance. A large survival benefit was observed in the intervention cohort, and intervention was an independent predictor of longer survival in a multivariate analysis when all baseline characteristics were included (HR = 0.63, p = 0.039). When post-baseline variables were included in the model, belonging to the intervention cohort was not an independent predictor of survival, but the survival benefit was explained by slightly better stage distribution and ECOG status at treatment initiation, together with trends for broader use of PET-CT and higher resectability rate. In conclusion, patient navigation is a valuable tool to improve cancer outcomes by facilitating more timely and complete cancer diagnostics. Contradictory evidence in the literature may be explained by common sources of bias, including the wait-time paradox and adjustment to intermediate outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4307216107,"To achieve homeostasis, the human biological system relies on the interaction between organs through the binding of ligands secreted from source organs to receptors located on destination organs. Currently, the changing roles that receptors perform in tissues are only partially understood. Recently, a methodology based on receptor co-expression patterns to classify their tissue-specific metabolic functions was suggested. Here we present an advanced framework to predict an additional class of inflammatory receptors that use a feature space of biological pathway enrichment analysis scores of co-expression networks and their eigengene correlations. These are fed into three machine learning classifiers–eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN). We applied our methodology to subcutaneous and visceral adipose gene expression datasets derived from the GTEx (Genotype-Tissue Expression) project and compared the predictions. The XGBoost model demonstrated the best performance in predicting the pre-labeled receptors, with an accuracy of 0.89/0.8 in subcutaneous/visceral adipose. We analyzed ~700 receptors to predict eight new metabolic and 15 new inflammatory functions of receptors and four new metabolic functions for known inflammatory receptors in both adipose tissues. We cross-referenced multiple predictions using the published literature. Our results establish a picture of the changing functions of receptors for two adipose tissues that can be beneficial for drug development."
https://openalex.org/W4307216118,"In addition to directly inducing physical and chemical defenses, herbivory experienced by plants in one generation can influence the expression of defensive traits in offspring. Plant defense phenotypes can be compromised by inbreeding, and there is some evidence that such adverse effects can extend to the transgenerational expression of induced resistance. We explored how the inbreeding status of maternal Solanum carolinense plants influenced the transgenerational effects of herbivory on the defensive traits and herbivore resistance of offspring. Manduca sexta caterpillars were used to damage inbred and outbred S . carolinense maternal plants and cross pollinations were performed to produced seeds from herbivore-damaged and undamaged, inbred and outbred maternal plants. Seeds were grown in the greenhouse to assess offspring defense-related traits (i.e., leaf trichomes, internode spines, volatile organic compounds) and resistance to herbivores. We found that feeding by M . sexta caterpillars on maternal plants had a positive influence on trichome and spine production in offspring and that caterpillar development on offspring of herbivore-damaged maternal plants was delayed relative to that on offspring of undamaged plants. Offspring of inbred maternal plants had reduced spine production, compared to those of outbred maternal plants, and caterpillars performed better on the offspring of inbred plants. Both herbivory and inbreeding in the maternal generation altered volatile emissions of offspring. In general, maternal plant inbreeding dampened transgenerational effects of herbivory on offspring defensive traits and herbivore resistance. Taken together, this study demonstrates that inducible defenses in S . carolinense can persist across generations and that inbreeding compromises transgenerational resistance in S . carolinense ."

Continuity is shown to reduce overall health service utilization among people with diabetes, however, evidence about how it relates to the utilization of outpatient specialist services in Norway is lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate continuity of GP care for people with T2D, and its association with the use of outpatient specialist health care services.We used e-mail questionnaire data obtained from members of The Norwegian Diabetes Association in 2018. Eligible for analyses were 494 respondents with T2D and at least one GP visit during the previous year. By descriptive statistics and logistic regressions, we studied usual provider continuity (UPC) and duration of the patient-GP relationship and associations of these measures with somatic outpatient specialist visits. Analyses were adjusted for gender, age, education, self-rated health, and diabetes duration.Mean age was 62.6 years and mean UPC was 0.85 (CI 0.83-0.87). Two thirds of the sample (66.0%) had made all visits to the regular GP during the previous year (full continuity). Among these, 48.1% had made one or more specialist visits during the previous year, compared to 65.2% among those without full continuity. The probability of outpatient specialist visits was significantly lower among participants with full continuity, compared to those without full continuity (Odds Ratio 0.53, Confidence Interval 0.35-0.80). The probability of visiting outpatient specialist services was not associated with duration of the patient-GP relationship.We conclude that continuity of care, as measured by Usual Provider Continuity, is high and associated with reduced use of somatic outpatient specialist services in people with T2D in Norway. Continuity and its benefits will become increasingly important as the number of older people with diabetes and other chronic diseases increases."

Meanwhile, to make the integrated learning model converge better and faster, the parameters of the integrated module are initialized, constraints are imposed, and a new activation function is designed for better integration of the sub-models. Finally, the integrated large model is distilled for knowledge distillation, which greatly reduces the number of model parameters and improves the model inference efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W4307216260,"Changes to hospital infrastructure are inevitable in ever-evolving healthcare systems. The redevelopment of hospitals and opening of new buildings can be a complex and challenging time for staff as they must find ways to deliver safe and high-quality care while navigating the complexities and uncertainties of change. This study explores the perspectives and experiences of staff and patients before and after the opening of a new hospital building as part of a large public hospital redevelopment in Sydney, Australia.The study comprised a longitudinal mixed methods case study design. Methods included two rounds of staff surveys (n = 292 participants), two rounds of staff interviews (n = 66), six rounds of patient surveys (n = 255), and analysis of hospital data at tri-monthly intervals over two years. Data were compared before (2019) and after (2020) a new hospital building opened at a publicly funded hospital in Sydney, Australia.Four key themes and perspectives emerged from the interviews including change uncertainty, communication effectiveness, staffing adequacy and staff resilience. Significant differences in staff perceptions of change readiness over time was identified. Specifically, perceptions that the organisational change was appropriate significantly decreased (2019: 15.93 ± 3.86; 2020: 14.13 ± 3.62; p < .001) and perceptions that staff could deal with the change significantly increased (2019: 17.30 ± 4.77; 2020: 19.16 ± 4.36; p = .001) after the building opened compared to before. Global satisfaction scores from patient survey data showed that patient experience significantly declined after the building opened compared to before (2020: 81.70 ± 21.52; 2019: 84.43 ± 18.46)), t(254) = -64.55, p < 0.05, and improved a few months after opening of the new facilities. This coincided with the improvement in staff perceptions in dealing with the change.Moving into a new hospital building can be a challenging time for staff and patients. Staff experienced uncertainty and stress, and displayed practices of resilience to deliver patient care during a difficult period of change. Policy makers, hospital managers, staff and patients must work together to minimise disruption to patient care and experience. Key recommendations for future hospital redevelopment projects outline the importance of supporting and informing staff and patients during the opening of a new hospital building."
https://openalex.org/W4307216416,"Osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are debilitating conditions, affecting millions of people. Both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis degrade the articular cartilage (AC) at the ends of long bones, resulting in weakened tissue prone to further damage. This degradation impairs the cartilage’s mechanical properties leading to areas of thinned cartilage and exposed bone which compromises the integrity of the joint. No preventative measures exist for joint destruction. Discovering a way to slow the degradation of AC or prevent it would slow the painful progression of the disease, allowing millions to live pain-free. Recently, that the articular injection of the polyphenol epigallocatechin-gallate (EGCG) slows AC damage in an arthritis rat model. It was suggested that EGCG crosslinks AC and makes it resistant to degradation. However, direct evidence that intraarticular injection of EGCG crosslinks cartilage collagen and changes its compressive properties are not known. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of intraarticular injection of EGCG induced biomechanical properties of AC. We hypothesize that in vivo exposure EGCG will bind and crosslink to AC collagen and alter its biomechanical properties. We developed a technique of nano-indentation to investigate articular cartilage properties by measuring cartilage compressive properties and quantifying differences due to EGCG exposure. In this study, the rat knee joint was subjected to a series of intraarticular injections of EGCG and contralateral knee joint was injected with saline. After the injections animals were sacrificed, and the knees were removed and tested in an anatomically relevant model of nanoindentation. All mechanical data was normalized to the measurements in the contralateral knee to better compare data between the animals. The data demonstrated significant increases for reduced elastic modulus (57.5%), hardness (83.2%), and stiffness (17.6%) in cartilage treated with injections of EGCG normalized to those treated with just saline solution when compared to baseline subjects without injections, with a significance level of alpha = 0.05. This data provides evidence that EGCG treated cartilage yields a strengthened cartilage matrix as compared to AC from the saline injected knees. These findings are significant because the increase in cartilage biomechanics will translate into resistance to degradation in arthritis. Furthermore, the data suggest for the first time that it is possible to strengthen the articular cartilage by intraarticular injections of polyphenols. Although this data is preliminary, it suggests that clinical applications of EGCG treated cartilage could yield strengthened tissue with the potential to resist or compensate for matrix degradation caused by arthritis."

https://openalex.org/W4307216457,"The elementary steps of transcription as catalyzed by E. coli RNA polymerase during one and two rounds of the nucleotide addition cycle (NAC) were resolved in rapid kinetic studies. Modelling of stopped-flow kinetic data of pyrophosphate release in a coupled enzyme assay during one round of the NAC indicates that the rate of pyrophosphate release is significantly less than that for nucleotide incorporation. Upon modelling of the stopped-flow kinetic data for pyrophosphate release during two rounds of the NAC, it was observed that the presence of the next nucleotide for incorporation increases the rate of release of the first pyrophosphate equivalent; incorrect nucleotides for incorporation had no effect on the rate of pyrophosphate release. Although the next nucleotide for incorporation increases the rate of pyrophosphate release, it is still significantly less than the rate of incorporation of the first nucleotide. The results from the stopped-flow kinetic studies were confirmed by using quench-flow followed by thin-layer chromatography (QF-TLC) with only the first nucleotide for incorporation labeled on the gamma phosphate with 32P to monitor pyrophosphate release. Collectively, the results are consistent with an NTP-driven model for the NAC in which the binding of the next cognate nucleotide for incorporation causes a synergistic conformational change in the enzyme that triggers the more rapid release of pyrophosphate, translocation of the enzyme along the DNA template strand and nucleotide incorporation."

Studies have shown that insecticide resistance affects vector competence (VC) of some mosquito species. This study evaluates the effect of resistance to lambda-cyhalothrin and kdr V1016I mutation genotypes on the VC of Ae . aegypti strains for DENV-2, ZIKV, and CHIKV. Three Ae . aegypti strains with gradual lambda-cyhalothrin resistance (susceptible, resistant, and highly resistant) were infected with DENV-2, ZIKV, and CHIKV. Individual mosquitoes were tested to detect virus infection in the abdomen and head-salivary glands, using RT-PCR, and genotypes for V1016I mutations using allele-specific PCR. Recorded VC variables were midgut infection rate (MIR), dissemination rate (DIR), and dissemination efficiency (DIE). Lambda-cyhalothrin resistance affects differentially VC variables for ZIKV, DENV-2, and CHIKV. For ZIKV, an apparent gradual increase in DIR and DIE with the increase in insecticide resistance was observed. For DENV-2 the MIR and DIE were higher in insecticide resistant strains. For CHIKV, only MIR could be evaluated, this variable was higher in insecticide resistance strains. The presence of kdr V1016I mutation on mosquito resistant strains did not affect VC variables for three study viruses."

We performed a prospective study of 87 MDS patients who were referred to a tertiary hematological center and of 11 bone marrow donors who were not related to the study cohort. A flow cytometry panel with 48 markers including checkpoint ligands and receptors was used to study lymphoid and myeloid subpopulations in the bone marrow aspirates. The study found that both the healthy donors and the MDS patients have a high proportion of lymphocytes with PD-1 expression (41±18% and 58±25% respectively) and a high proportion of myeloid cells with PD-1L expression (31±23% and 12±7% respectively), indicating a potential physiological role of checkpoint systems in BM. At the same time, complex alterations including PD-1, CTLA-4, LAG-3 and TIM3 pathways accompanied by an increased level of T-reg and myeloid derived suppressor cell populations were identified in the BM of MDS patients. Cluster analysis showed independent prognostic significance of the checkpoint profile for overall survival (HR 1.90, 95%CI 1.01-3.56, p = 0.0471). TIM3-postive NK and CD8 effector cells along with the blast count were the key subpopulations for prognosis.

To date, the neurological basis of attentional deficits has not been fully described according to the diagnostic criteria. ADHD may result from deficits in various attributes of attention. There is no specialist neuropsychological diagnostic method that allows reliable distinction between primary attention disorders in the etiology of ADHD and secondary problems that may arise due to co-morbidities. This protocol aims to systematically review the literature to evaluate patterns of attention common to school-age children either diagnosed with ADHD or at high risk of ADHD, as measured by the neuropsychological attention network test (ANT).Our search strategy will consist of electronic databases (PubMed, PsychInfo, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library) and hand searching. Both prospective cohort studies and prospective studies of intervention effects will be included, provided they used the ANT. The primary output variable will be attention deficits. Screening and eligibility will be done independently by two reviewers based on pre-specified eligibility criteria. Data extraction will be based on a pre-pilot data extraction form and conducted by two authors independently. The risk of bias will be assessed by two authors independently. The rating of the certainty of the entire body of evidence will be evaluated using the GRADE approach. Any discrepancies identified at any stage of the review will be resolved by discussion or/and consultation with another reviewer. We plan a narrative synthesis of findings and a quantitative meta-analysis if the data allow.The research will identify patterns of neuropsychological ANT results characteristic of both school-age children diagnosed with ADHD and those at high risk of having ADHD. Our results could be used to check whether the pattern of a child's performance in the ANT corresponds to the characteristic pattern of the results of children with ADHD. At present, the ANT is used only in research; the results of this review will serve as a useful benchmark. Hopefully, in the future, it will be possible to use the ANT in the wider diagnosis of ADHD.PROSPERO: CRD42021249768."
https://openalex.org/W4307240540,"Alcohol consumption is the main risk factor for death and disability in the world population between 15 to 49 years old, is related to more than 200 causes of death, and has an important economic impact on the health and social security systems. In 2016, three million deaths were attributable to alcohol worldwide and 131.4 million DALYs. In Brazil, alcohol consumption per inhabitant was 7.8 liters in 2016; and the prevalence of abusive consumption was 17.1% in 2019.Estimate the costs attributable of alcohol consumption in the Brazilian population 18 years-old and over, in the period 2010 to 2018.This is a prevalence-based cost-of-illness study, with a top-down and retrospective approach, including direct costs (hospital and outpatient) and indirect costs (absenteeism from work) related to alcohol consumption. A list of diseases and conditions for which alcohol is a risk factor was used, and the Population Attributable Risk (PAR) was calculated to estimate what portion of the cost of these diseases is attributable to alcohol consumption. Prevalence was calculated by sex and level of alcohol consumption, based on data from the 2019 National Health Survey. Relative risk data were identified by disease/injury and level of daily consumption obtained from the Global Burden Disease study in 2017. The cost data used are from the Brazilian Unified Health System and social security system. All costs were adjusted for inflation for the period and converted to purchasing power parity.Prevalence data revealed that 73.6% of the Brazilian population reported not consuming alcoholic beverages, which included 62.9% of men and 83.0% of women. The lowest values for the PAR were found at the consumption range of 60 grams per day. Although the 12 grams per day consumption category is the least in terms of the quantity of alcohol consumed, it is one of the main ones in terms of PAR, given the higher prevalence of consumption. The total cost attributable to alcohol between 2010 and 2018 was Int$ 1,487,417,115.43, of which Int$ 737,834,696.89 was for hospital expenses, Int$ 416,052,029.75 for outpatient care, and Int$ 333,530,388.79 due to absenteeism from work.Few comprehensive studies of alcohol-related costs have been developed, which suggests a knowledge gap in Brazil and worldwide and indicates the need for more research in this area. Understanding the economic impact of alcohol consumption is essential to help measure this public health problem in all its aspects and encourage implementation of public policies."
